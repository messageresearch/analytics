we'll get there um but I know it's some that he looked over the vanister time and probably just up there in heaven rejoicing uh watching how things went off on last weekend but uh everyone in their respective places I mean spirit and truth you all were all over the place amen from um praise the Lord um it was coordination of getting the church uh brother Troy uh found that venue for us and um

people coming here for the uh the homeg goinging service and uh when you have it like that the purpose that the people were coming was to uh celebrate the life of brother Wesker who has impacted most of our Lives amen but uh so we kind of talked some things over with the brothers and we just felt it would be appropriate to have the combined service with uh Rapture and Faith so that we didn't split keep Lo losing all right is it me y'all can hear me just I I I it just keep going in and out and I don't know if there's some interference somewhere uh but that's all right we'll get there but we

got to run one more time before the end of the year amen one more one more trip and I just solicit your prayers because um it is um it's not easy on the body amen when you when you when you when you do these things but uh we realize that the work of the Lord must be done and um one of the things I will say that um I mean I just thank God that he allows us to fulfill his Great Commission that's go into all the world and preach the gospel El amen and then it tells us that these signs uh shall follow them that believe we went there to Australia and uh one of the benefits of the meeting there is there were six people that got baptized while we were there in the meetings praise the Lord amen so it's always like brother Solomon saying earlier it's so good to see God transform Hearts uh you realize that your work is not in vain and I want to tell you something if there was only one person that came to the Lord through those meetings then it was worth all the time spent amen getting there and coming back home so uh we thank God that there's results that come forth from praise the Lord yeah take the paper off that's all yeah um we're going to be all right and let me tell you something

morning he deserves your best this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah he is worthy of your praise this morning is that right amen hallelujah you all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh sister if you don't mind if you could just uh play a little the chorus of that song Amen uh that you was playing earlier the blessing uh just want to want to just greet you all this morning precious name of Jesus Christ um I'm certainly blessed back there to hear the worship of the Saints and you know it's really hard to stay back there and be still when you guys are singing like that uh but as brother Jack was singing that song uh just want to read a scripture uh this wasn't plan but it just ministered to my heart in such a [Music] way and uh the scripture is in uh 2 Corinthians uh chapter 1 verse 20 and it reads for all the promises of God in him are yay in him amen unto the glory of God by us now what this means to me it was kind of personal because you realize when you have a need you have somebody that stands ready to answer and every promise that you read you can say Amen into it every promise in the word is your personal property every promise belongs to you so I want to thank God this morning for that and and you know uh as a as a minister of this message I'm very grateful uh to be before you and you know when you study uh to bring forth the word we we study a little different from the theologians and the scholars right uh we don't necessarily study to gain more knowledge but we studied to try to find a mind of God you see I believe the scripture says let this mind that was in Christ be in you and that's what we try to find the mind of God so that we can bring out a revelation and identity to his people so as we uh step into his word I I just pray that you all will gather with me to enter into his mind this morning that we may tap into the things that belong to us praise the Lord and so I just ask that you guys all turn with me to 1 Corinthians verse uh chapter 1 verse 22 we'll read a few verses there and we'll read a few other places all right say am man will you're there and while you guys turn there I I I Was preparing myself to say this but I'm going to say it any how uh my I was expecting my mother to be here this morning and I trust she's she'll still make it she may still be on her way all right uh but uh you know just thinking with her being here and I was saying I was thinking of my pastor and and how uh it's it's it's good to always give uh your mother her flowers and you don't have to wait until H something happens for you to say something good uh but I just want to want to just thank the Lord for my mother uh she's very precious to me the hardest working woman I know all right uh so I trust that if she won't be here today she'll come someday and and she'll be uh she'll be blessed of course am praise the Lord now it reads uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 22 amen it reads for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty praise the Lord let us also turn to Ephesians 1 verse 13 and 14 amen and it reads in whom ye also trusted after that that ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory praise the Lord now I want you to know Earnest is the very down payment of what you already possess praise the Lord and one more scripture in Ephesians Ians 4:30 we're all familiar with this scripture and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let us pray Heavenly Father Lord we count it a great honor and privilege this morning to be gathered before you father God our prayer this morning is that you would have your preeminence Lord have your way with us Lord speak to us father God as the scripture was read Lord we come to serve the Creator the creator of Heaven and Earth Lord God and Father you have gathered us here together because you have a purpose Lord You've gathered here this morning because you desire to inhabit in this place and Lord I pray that you would speak to every heart Lord circumcise my lips Lord circumcise the hearts of the people Lord and father I pray that Lord you would fulfill your promises once more Lord that you would pour out your spirit Lord upon us where we can see Great and Mighty things Lord may you open the understanding of our minds Lord to receive oh God and may your seed continue to flow in us oh God we pray for those even watching online Lord may they receive a word in due season oh God and Lord we pray that that you'll just have your way father we give you the praise the honor and the glory amen amen you all may have your seats may the Lord add a blessing to his reading amen praise the Lord so we read in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 um and uh the the scripture says the God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty so I want you to know this morning that if you are a chosen of God God has chosen you this morning and if you feel weak this morning I want you to know you are the weakness of God all right I want you to know that God can use you to defeat the things that are Mighty is that right you are the weakness of God praise the Lord now you may be called all kind of names but the prophet says who are you a fool to you're either a fool to the world or a fool to the God right I rather be a to God's kingdom amen so God has used a coolest things to confound the wise and we thank him this morning for that praise the Lord so as a title this morning I just want to just want to use uh sealed in restoration sealed in restoration and we certainly thank God for the for this theme of restoration and our pastor just giving us the series of getting back and step and and just finding ways and how I can uh uh step in the same channel and maybe God would inspire me and and and it's hard not to be inspired when you're receiving the word in that manner praise the Lord so I want to start off with this quote here the prophet speaks this in the Seal of Christ preached in 55 0312 he says the sign of the believer is the fruits of the spirit right and the fruits of the spirit is not seeing visions not Healing The Sick not speaking with tongues not shouting the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience amen that's the Seal of God and I want you know the word of God produces the fruit of the spirit in your life so there means there has to be a surrender to the word of God Amen somebody praise the Lord so this morning we want to talk about the Seal of God and what it means to be sealed we also want to connect that to being restored praise the Lord now a ceiling can be a signature a Bonafide statement a ceiling shows uh when when something's been sealed it shows there's no way in and there's no way out a ceiling shows that the product has been finished it shows that the product has reached a place of perfection it knows that it can stand a test amen now a ceiling also testifies that the product has reached a place of maturity right where it can handle a little bit more responsibility and it can stand the test praise the Lord a ceiling shows that the finished work cannot be compromised changed or undone yes M say it again a ceiling shows that the finished work cannot be compromised changed or undone amen now I'm reminded over 4,000 years ago death was a seal that was Final finished and complete but on that day of Calvary praise the Lord the seals of death was broken amen I believe brother Mark read that and he says this was uh one of the uh more prominent scriptures in Matthew 28 but when he rose up again that broke the seals of death am cuz he did something that never been done before amen praise the Lord and I want you to know that when he when he rose up again he he broke the seals of death but he also sealed something and we'll get into that a little later praise the Lord now a seal also is a mystery that unfolds it's a mystery that unfolds a seal is also to loose the ministry it's to loose the ministry praise the Lord to loose is to permit or authorize something by in an indisputable Authority I'm going say it again to lose is permitting or authorizing something by an indisputable Authority when something is indisputable it means there's no error there's no mistake there's no guilt there's no shame praise the Lord there's no questioning it it's finished praise the Lord amen in Colossians 2:9 it says for in him dwelleth the fullness of God of the godhead bodily deity and ye that means you are the are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power yes John 16:7 Jesus speaks this word here he says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient that I go away for if I go not away the comforter that's the indisputable Authority it's the comforter it's the Holy Ghost in you if I go not away then he will not come but it's expedient that I go away so that he can dwell where in you that's the indisputable dwelling in you praise the Lord hallelujah Christ saw that it was necessary for him to multiply himself in you that's right and the reason why that was necessary to loose the ministry wow the ministry of reconciliation the ministry of restoration it was able to be loosed in continuation in you amen praise the Lord right and by this indisputable Authority you have the right to claim your family you have the right to claim your loved ones you have the right to claim your healing you have the right to claim your Victory amen indisputable Authority praise the Lord glory amen now you guys all over the say all heard the saying you can lock the door throw away the keys what your ceiling Christ holds the door he holds the lock and he holds the keys he is the door and he is the lock and he is the keys to your salvation praise the Lord glj and lastly a seal forces a decision it forces the issue and we'll get into that a little later as well praise the Lord now I'm going to read a quote here in the message I am the resurrection and the life in paragraph 73 the prophet says he was a man when he cried up there at Calvary my God why hast Thou forsaken me he died like a man but on Easter morning he rose breaking the seals of death corruption rising to ascend to the to the father above showing that he was more than a man he was God in flesh believes thou this praise the Lord hallelujah and you know I I have a I have a a wonderful time with the Jehovah's Witness on this because they they seem to love my house they come and knock almost every morning and I almost expect him now and and sometimes I have to leave work just to speak to him but recently I spoke to him and I I told him you know very nice lady and I says ma'am I agree with almost everything you agree with in your word but you cannot take God and chop him up in three pieces all right and I told her that's the only one of the only things that I have fought have fought with is that you make God the father and God the son two separate entities and I was like you can't do that and then I just I was like I don't want to waste your time I don't want to waste my time uh but uh we can cut this very short because uh your partner one of your partners came some time ago and I showed him some things and he couldn't answer them right so I was like you know we we we'll we we'll do this another time all right so we thank God for that the revelation of his word Glory now God broke the seals of death he did he did this when he went to jer's daughter and he says jarus daughter is not dead but she's just sleeping amen so the seals of death was broken right there he broke the seals of death with Lazarus when he said Lazarus come forth right something that's never been done praise the Lord so we thank God for that now the prophet says here in the message The Works that I do uh bear witness of me he says remember little children I don't care what church you belong to or what you have done how well you've done this that or the other how much you've put into the collection plates or if you're a deacon preacher Pastor or lay member or whatever it is you'll never come into the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit has sealed you in the Kingdom by his Divine love that the whole Christian world is your brother and sister that's right the world sealed out and God is sealed in when you love one another truly with Divine Christian love that's right then you know the Holy Spirit really is working through you then that's right then by their fruits you shall know them amen praise the lord it's important to love your brothers and sisters believe brother Quinton says we thank God uh said this this morning in his prayer he said we thank God that we can just be called Christians when we go to work when we go to school the the the very fact that we have to bear the name of Christ puts us in a different category it makes us not only redeemable but we become we become um uh uh able to redeem others through the life that we live praise God sir Glory now I want to turn to acts uh chapter 3 here verse 19 and I want to talk a little bit about Peter uh now Peter was was was was a very unique individual uh he certainly had a bold a bold Faith uh but but he also got himself in trouble with that um but we want to look into a little bit of his life and we pick him up here in Acts 3: 19 and these are the words that that he spoke he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord yes sir and he shall stand uh and he shall send Jesus Christ which before you was preached unto to you whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began and I can tell you Church we've been experiencing the times of refreshing with this word with the inspiration that's been given to our pastor of getting back in Step it is the time of refreshing and when the time was refreshing is nigh don't let it pass you by Praise the Lord cuz God has a word for you yes sir amen and Peter goes on to say uh whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things so there's a time where there there's a restoration of all things uh not just a Redemption of your life but a restoration of the things that matter to you the things that God has purposed in your life the gifts the callings those things belong to you more importantly the gifts of the Spirit amen Belong To You Right amen amen and now just talking a little bit about Peter now Peter was one that uh I believe last time I went through his life when I was here I spoke on how he denied Christ three times and before doing so before doing so uh he he he he spoke on the table and he says uh when Christ says one of you will deny me Christ says I'll go to prison for you you right um I I that will not do no no such thing I he was so convinced that he would not deny him Christ says before morning even comes you will deny me three times you see now I appreciate Peter's Faith but there was a spoken word he could not speak that he could not go against um and it had to come to pass but you know going through that what God was allowing Peter to go through was not uh to experience a setback but it was really a setup all right God was setting Peter up for something greater than himself he was setting Peter up for something that he didn't even see or understand and because Peter did not understand this we pick him up in John 21 we find that Peter desire Peter is is is now Desiring to go back to what he used to do right you see uh we picked this up in John 21 verse one he says after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called dimus and Nathaniel of Canaan and Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples and Peter of course as the spokesman saith unto him to to them I go fishing they said unto him we also go with thee so shows you the kind of character Peter had the influence he had on those disciples I go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing so again Peter is trying to visit Old territory brother right but in order for God to enlarge Peter's territory he needed new territory praise the Lord was trying to go to Old territory but he needed new territory it reminds me of the parable Jesus gave in Luke 5 right Jesus spoke these words he says in Luke 5:36 he says no man put it a piece of new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new make it w and the peace that was taken out of the new ageeth not with the old and no man put it new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish but the new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved so Peter was trying to visit his old life but he was in a new day he was in a new age he was in a new message amen so God did not desire Peter to go back God desire did not desire Peter to get out of Step he desired Peter to get back in Step amen am man so Peter in this state praise the Lord Peter in this state I he feels ashamed he feels guilty he feels dis uh uh disappointed that he denied Christ three times praise the Lord but I remind you that go Peter uh God was not setting Peter up to fail he was setting Peter up to do great things Great and Mighty things so now we picked this up in chapter uh verse four it says but when the morning was now come Luke 5:4 when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find now they didn't know this was Jesus right but this whole time Jesus is looking at them getting on the ship going fishing Jesus steps say and asked them have ye any meat now I want to remind you Jesus knows just the question to ask you when you're going through something Jesus knows just when to step in in your darkest hour all right that's when he steps in right now we F we pick it up here um verse 6 and he said unto them cast a net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom Jesus loveed saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GT his fish's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea God knows how to use old territory to make it familiar territory to bring restoration right praise the Lord now was no doubt broken he was broken but he needed somebody to restore him praise the Lord now Psalms 51:1 17 David speaks this word after he himself was broken he says the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise so I want you to understand Peter was in a perfect condition to receive what God had prepared for him praise Lord so even when you find yourself in a broken situation God is Not setting up for failure God is setting you up for something greater praise the Lord and I'm reminded of the words that uh our pastor uh said on um on Saturday and and and I have to give our pastor credit for saying it but the the real credit goes to brother Wesco where he says you can make it on broken pieces amen so regardless of what situation you're in you can make naked unbroken pieces praise the Lord amen now we pick it up back in Mark 16 verse 5 praise the Lord and it says in entering into the seure they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long garment and they were AF frightened now this is what happened prior to getting on the ship and he saith unto them be not AF frighted ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter praise the Lord God made it personal to Peter right go tell your disciples and Peter that he goeth before you in Galilee there you shall see him and he said unto you right praise God so God knew exactly the condition that Peter would be in for him to be restored back to where he belonged praise the Lord amen Peter says this in second Peter 1:10 he says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling in election short for if you do these things ye shall never fail right you shall never fall now I just want to ask what things what things if you do you shall never fall now we picked this up in Acts chapter 4 verse 5 and I might not be able to read the whole thing because it's a lengthy uh read here but this is Peter when he is now filled with the Holy Ghost all right and it is really something to behold the boldness that the Believers had in this time in this day yes it didn't matter who they were up against it goes back to their indisputable Authority they had that right praise the Lord amen and you see they did something that was uh of of reproach to them in that day all right uh and they it was a man that received healing it was a miracle and people all over witnessed it all right praise the Lord and we can pick this up in Acts uh in verse 8 says Peter then filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him do this man stand here before you hold so Jes uh Peter is telling them exactly how this man received his healing exactly how this man was made whole right in verse 13 we read it says now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant man they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and you know sometimes you got to conduct yourself like you've been with Jesus you've got to carry yourself like you've been with Jesus where other people can see Jesus on the outside amen we continue here it says verse 14 and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the counsel they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable Miracle hath been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it praise God see there's certain things when God do for your life your enemies can't deny it the the naysayers can't deny it those that had to speak something against you can't deny it praise God verse 17 but that is spread no further among the people let a straight threaten them now this is their tactic that they speak henceforth to no man in his name and they call them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John praise the Lord Peter and John um praise the Lord Peter and John verse okay there we go uh but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you or to hearken unto God judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and have heard praise the Lord so when I say what things I ask you what have you seen and what have you heard all right praise God have you seen the god manifest himself in your midst have you have you heard the word of God in your ears so you must speak what you've seen you must speak what you've heard praise God cuz it belongs to you yes it's amen glory Peter says I cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard amen praise God Amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God Amen and when you receive Faith Peter tells us to add to your faith virtue right and add to your virtue to knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now I want you to understand Peter didn't say your virtue your knowledge your brotherly kindness but he did say your faith so you must have your faith and then when you have your faith it's connected to everything else praise the Lord your faith brings everything on the scene your faith your faith gives you what you need in the time that you need it hallelujah praise God now Peter was sealed with the Holy Spirit the scripture tells us he was in elect according to the foreign knowledge of God praise God now we all have been surrounded by the supernatural this this whole this whole journey has been Supernatural the the restoration of the word the the the the the the the the thought of getting back in Step it's it's all been Supernatural and no one is here by accident praise the Lord amen no one is here by accident amen the supernatural surrounds you and I'm I'm going to I'm going to bring a script a few thoughts of the scripture out to you to to help you see that you're surrounded by the supernatural I'm reminded of gazi you see gazi was surrounded by Chariots of angels but he didn't see it but it took God to open his eyes to realize he was surrounded by the supernatural praise God I'm reminded of the disciples that was on the boat right they were going somewhere but a storm came their way but there was somebody sleeping on the boat they were surrounded by the supernatural praise God and and the scripture says uh disciple says let us go wake Jesus you see so I encourage you this morning go wake up the supernatural go wake up the supernatural you need the supernatural for your finances the supernatural for your healing the supernatural for your Victory the supernatural wake up the supernatural this morning it belongs to you praise God praise God [Applause] GL we're surrounded by the supernatural now I want to turn to Jeremiah 25 as we continue the thought of sealed and restoration Jeremiah 25 verse 8 praise the Lord and it reads therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words Behold I will send and take all the families of the north sayeth the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them in astonishment in a hissing In Perpetual desolations moreover I will take from them the voice of MTH and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the sound of the millstones in the light of the candle verse 11 and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years praise the Lord now I want you to understand that in this in this time where God is revealing this word to Jeremiah the prophet uh Jeremiah in chapter 1 had already been told uh that God would use him to uh destroy to to pluck out to to to root out uh but he also says he would he would build and he would plant and in this this instance we realize that prophecy is going forth against the children of isra Israel because of their idolatry because of them serving false gods right and and and and we we see that there will be a desolation to their land for 70 years so they'll be in captivity for 70 years praise God and and and and God uh uh just like Peter had this word to them but God was never setting them up for failure God was setting them up for something that they would never they would not even understand in Jeremiah 29 we pick this up and this is another um another prophecy given to Jeremiah I like to call this God's love letter God's love letter to his people praise God now this letter to the Exiles verse four it says thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel unto all that are carried away captives whom I have called to be carried who caused I I who's I the Lord who he caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon build ye houses and dwell in them and plant Gardens and eat the fruit of them take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be be increased there and not be diminished and I thought this was very interesting because even in captivity the Lord still wants you to experience increase even in captivity the Lord still wants you to have praise the Lord still still desires for you to have increase even in captivity praise God God hallelujah verse 7 it says and seek the peace of the city whether I have caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto the Lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace so God wants you to experience increase and peace in captivity that that's the god that you serve which can use the foolish things of this world to confound the wise praise God glory and restoration um in Jeremiah 29 we continue this this scene in verse 10 and Jeremiah the prophet says for thus sayith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place that's it that's restoration praise God verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search from me with all your heart and if I be found of you sayi the Lord I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into this place whence I have caused you to be carried away captive praise God now I want you to understand that God knew this all along amen right but it was necessary for the people of God to receive chastisement right chastisement and correction is God's love to you praise God when you are chastised the Bible says you are not a bastard child when you can receive it praise God Amen now the people of God understood this and in Jeremiah 31:18 they said I have surely heard Ephraim children of Israel Bolding himself thus thou has chastised me and I was chastised as a bulock unaccustomed to the Yoke turn thou me and I shall be turned for the Lord the the Lord for thou art the Lord my God so the people are now recognizing the need for restoration and and and and what unlocks the restoration that belongs to you is when you can recognize your need for it when you when you can recognize that you yourself need to be restored praise God all right amen now in the message the true Easter seal in paragraph 53 the prophet says and then I was thinking that what I had in mind as a Easter seal then I wondered why that it was so rejected and how that people would refuse it why was it so condemned and I was thinking then that it's not always condemned and all people doesn't condemn it but God has so made a way that man has placed that man is placed into a position to where he's forced to make a decision man cannot live on earth without making a decision God forces the issue to him he must make some decision and there is a time when you have to make a decision praise the Lord and and and in the decision the Seal of God forces that upon you it forces you to make a decision we didn't talk about this but when you have to make a decision it's really between two things the Seal of God or the mark of the beast praise God all right you either receive the Seal of God or you are marked with the mark of the beast now the prophet says the mark of the beast is rejecting the word for your day rejecting the word that's been revealed to you the word of restoration praise the Lord amen so you must make a decision sir and when you are forced to make this decision you must understand the need to be sealed sealed now we read earlier in Ephesians chapter 1 where it says were sealed when you first believed now when did you believe when did you believe did you believe when the the word was revealed to you now or did you believe some other time praise God we're going to we're going to get into a little bit of that uh as as I continue praise the Lord God now as a recap um just some of the things that I know our pastor has has has uh has read uh in the message the restoration of the brid tree paragraph 122 it reads regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how Unholy we are how sick we are how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces the issue and says give it back amen if we could just think for that for a minute forces it regardless of the condition no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with his word praise the Lord amen so in Jeremiah 31 ver 19 we see the manifestation of restoration taking place it says surely after that I was turned after that I was restored uhhuh I repented all right and after that I was instructed I smoted upon my thigh I was ashamed yay even confounded because I did Bear the reproach of my youth but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayi the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and they will be and I will be their God and they shall be my people so who will write the law God will write his law in your inward Parts amen and we just read it here here the law it's the law of God by his Spirit the law of God is his word right and whatever the condition is it must obey the law of God praise the Lord yes sir in paragraph 136 in that same message the restoration of the Bride tree the prophet says that's the church might be a bunch of Holy Rollers so-called or whatever you want to call it but it's the authority it's the authority behind it that's what does it regardless of the conditions God's law works with his word now it won't work with your Creed it only work with the word yay it's just works with the word that's all regardless of the condition praise the Lord uh where's the water bottle amen praise the Lord so we want to turn into Jeremiah 32 Jeremiah 32 as we continue to unfold this thought of being sealed in restoration praise the Lord now in Jeremiah 32 uh this this was a time where what was spoken in Jeremiah 25 that we read earlier where we see the man the the the play out of that Prophecy of the the the the children of Israel going into captivity so in Jeremiah 32 we read verse one here it says the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the 10th year of zedekiah king of Judah um which was the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar for the king of babylon's army Bes Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison now I want you to see this um in in in this manner um we realize Jer prop the Prophet Jeremiah was in prison and as he was in prison the very land that he's occupying will also soon be in prison so now he's in a double prison all right right uh now that there's nowh anybody would want to be but this is where he was but the the word continues here uh Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the Prophet which was in the king of judah's house for zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him up saying wherefore dust thou prophesy and say thus sayith the Lord behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take it so Jeremiah had prophesied that this would take place that's right and zedekiah was mad about that you see the the word of the Lord is in the mouth of the prophet and it's never popular and zedekiah knew that now zedekiah also had an ought against the king of neb uh the king of Babylon which was king Nebuchadnezzar is that uh zedekiah rebelled against him you see so he on so he was in a twofold lose a losing side because he he Jeremiah said he was going to lose this this battle that uh the the the armies of Babylon would overtake them and he knew that once he comes uh uh face to face with King Nebuchadnezzar uh it wouldn't be too good for him so he knows all of this and he's he's he's he's sharing his anger towards Jeremiah which is why Jeremiah is now in this prison praise the Lord now in verse six we continue and as Jeremiah is in prison it says in Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold Hanam the son of Shalom thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying by thee my field that is in anot and anot was Jeremiah's Hometown come on brother Hanam was Jeremiah's cousin so God is God is telling Jeremiah that your cousin's going going to come to you and he's going to ask you to buy his field and now this is a time of captivity come on so now there's a a transaction that's getting ready to take place yes praise the Lord and it continues here uh it says behold Hamil the son of shalom shalom uh thine uncle's uh that Uncle uh shall uh come unto thee saying by my field uh that is an an an anop uh for the right of redemption is thine to buy it in verse eight so Hanam mine Uncle son come to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that is in anod which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine praise the Lord now Jeremiah saw a vision first and now he sees a direct manifestation of that Vision it has come to pass his cousin has come to him in the prison and has told him we are in this I know we're in this captivity I know we're being sieged by Babylon but um I'm I'm trying to sell this land right it's just like uh uh the market is getting ready to crash and uh your cousin come to you and says I need to sell this stock will you buy it I need to sell this house will you buy it praise God and you see Jeremiah he he based on the prophecy he goes on to say he says uh then I knew that this was the word of the Lord amen so because he knew it was the word of the Lord he had confidence in this transaction it didn't make sense for him to buy it because the the land would have meant nothing to him because it would have been uh under the Babylonian jurisdiction right brother but he had confidence in the word praise God in verse nine says enai brought the field of Hanam my uncle's son that was in anod and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver praise the Lord so this wasn't a favorable deal to a favor deal business transaction to Jeremiah but he he he he had something that was in him sir that that that he could receive confirmation by Praise the Lord right and I believe God wanted Jeremiah to have tomorrow's breaking news today because though they were in captivity God had plans of one day bringing restoration to the people of God in that land you see nobody knew it but the prophet right so the prophet on the scene brought a restoration message praise God and he was able to cond cond the transaction based on restoration and the reason he could do this is because the transaction was based on the right of redemption praise the Lord Jeremiah had a Redemption claim to the purchase of that land right brother praise God glory and Jeremiah had to be qualified to execute this transaction he had to be qualified because he was Kinsman to Hanah praise God glory praise the Lord now I want you to I want you to type this because 2,000 years ago there was a transaction that occurred on the cross right praise God it wasn't 17 pieces of of silver that was purchased uh that was brought to purchase the land but it was the blood of Jesus Christ amen the blood of Jesus Christ was shed to purchase amen your land this morning praise God praise God praise the Lord my God than now I want you to know what makes you qualified is not your relationship to God but his relationship to you all right that's what makes you qualified this morning it's his relationship to you which means it's not your business it's God's business it's not your purpose it's God's purpose it's what he's unfolding in you and through you yes sir praise the lordu so the prophet says uh in this message the seed shall not be air with the shut the prophet says uh God knew before the foundation of the world who would be saved and who would not be saved by predestination by for knowledge he saw every member put every name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the church began so God is speaking of you he saw you before you were even born praise God paragraph 48 says say um uh as I have often says you recognize that that's why you're here this morning while you're coming up out of all these organization and things there's something pulling you amen there's something pulling you now we continue this in Jeremiah 32:10 after Jeremiah has made this transaction he's he does something uh very particular here it says and I subscribed which mean he signed the evidence and sealed it and we talked about a seal is something that is signed subscribed he says I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took Witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so I took evidence the deed of the purchase right both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open wow and I gave the evidence of the purchase to Barack the son of uh Niah the son of Messiah and in the sight of Hanam my uncle son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribe the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison so Jeremiah went the full nine yards here in the spite of being in captivity Jeremiah is now purchased this land and he has purposed in his heart that I'm going to need proof that I purchased this land I'm going to need an I'm need something that shows that regardless of who takes this land captive this land belongs to me that's exactly right the spite of who comes what may what Le this land belongs to me so he takes this this deed and he seals it up and there's a the the this talks about uh the deed that was sealed and the deed that was open all right now I want you to understand was the same document the same the same uh um the same deed but one was sealed one was open and the purpose of the Open document was if at all it was ever tampered with if at all it was ever compromised they could go back to the sealed document and vindicate the false that may have been on the on the other document oh praise God Amen two do one was sealed one was open and I want you to understand that you here this morning in your Earthly vessel all right but the pro the Bible says that uh when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved there's one waiting up for you in glory and I want you to understand that that one is waiting for you in glory has already been sealed so you might have been compromised with sickness you might have been compromised with defeat you might have been compromised with failure but there's a sealed version of you that is perfect finished that has not been compromised praise God and God can use that to vindicate who you are this morning that's why the word had to be broken that's why the seals had to be broken so that you can understand who you are in Him Praise the Lord you see when God with Christ on the cross he broke the seals of death but he also sealed you with his holy spirit all right praise the Lord and when he sealed you amen amen praise God Amen Let Us continue it goes on to say in verse 13 and I charged Barack before them saying thus said the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences the Deeds the evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and the evidence which is open and put them in an earn vessel that they may continue many days when Christ died on the cross he put the when he sealed the Seal of Promise the Holy Ghost he put it in an earn vessel when we turn to 2 Corinthians 4:7 it says but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us praise God and if that if it be if the Earth vessel is Christ and you are in Christ this morning that mean the sealed evidence the sealed document that is in Christ is in you amen praise God Amen so you are sealed in restoration this morning you have a seal on the inside that cannot be compromised you have a seal on the inside that cannot be tampered with indisputable Authority praise God you have a seal on the inside that will stand the test that will defeat any devil any day any time no matter who no matter where it is a sealed document praise God Amen the prophet said many time before they can be a a a fake dollar they have to be a real one praise the Lord amen so you you you you are the imperfection of what already is that's good praise the Lord praise God in the message Revelation chap 5 uh part two preach 61 0618 paragraph 194 the prophet says now when Jeremiah wrote this book was sealed he's here's a good thing I want you to notice all of you that read it that them sealed book uh now remember he was going to be gone he had prophesied now he did not know it only only through a prophecy are you following me through prophecy he knew through the revelation of God that they was going to uh be away from that country for 70 years you remember him prophesying that he would be 70 years they'd be in captivity so he wanted to be sure that this seal that is his inheritance would be kept cuz he inherited his cousin's inheritance so he had it all wrote up legally and what did he do with it so it wouldn't rot or rust he put it in an Earthly vessel and put it away so it wouldn't rot or rust until them 70 years be expired glory to God I hoped you would catch it do you see what God did he never revealed it to the wise and prudent so they could fuss about it for all his time but he put in an Earthly vessel and he created himself his own son Christ Jesus and this last day now he's opening the seals and showing it to his church capped in an Earthly vessel so it wouldn't Rod or rust oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am you see but there it is it's been kept wrapped in the vessel of the earth that was redeemed out of the Earth come up on Easter morning where de seals could not hold him any longer but he BR the seals and Rose up and proing himself in this last day that he is alive he's in his church he's the same yesterday today and forever and that's been hid from seminaries it's been hid from organizations and in this last days he's revealing it by his own presence among his people he gets somebody that he can get the world out of them and the things out of them the churchianity out of them so he could speak through them and reveal and open the seals like this himself Hallelujah don't you love him my my my praise God you are a seal this morning and the Very fact of you being here as I mentioned is Not an Accident there was a seal in you that God had to break God broke the Seal of death through your life the Seal of sin the Seal of unbelief and he's placed his own seal upon you and now you can receive the re ation of Who You Are God the revelation of who he is in you praise God am now after you've been restored Jeremiah I want to want to turn Jeremiah 32 and I I just couldn't help but but add this in here on purpose and soon you'll see why Jeremiah chapter 32 verse 41 after you've been restored I like it praise the Lord I like it and it reads Glory yay I Will Rejoice over them thank Jes to do them good thank you Jesus and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul praise the Lord see God knows our needs this morning and he promised that he would plant us in a land assuredly amen we have been preaching restoration this entire year but now is the time to be sealed and when you are sealed God can plant you assuredly praise the Lord assuredly where you cannot be moved assuredly where you cannot be defeated praise God I know we're in a Schoolhouse but God is planting us assuredly praise God praise the Lord in Jeremiah Glory 33 verse 10 God this is after you've been sealed another promise of God to you Jeremiah 33:10 it reads thus sayith the Lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye shall say be desolate without man and without Beast even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without Beast he says ye shall be heard again in this place verse 11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord for I will cause to return the captiv it of the land at first sayeth the Lord God wants you to experience Joy gladness praise when you have been restored right there he's worthy for you to praise him after you have been restored praise the Lord praise God praise God praise Goden now I have uh I'm not good with timers I did not set a timer um I just like to go with the flow of things and I have a lot here how I'm doing on time I don't know praise the Lord I I don't want to hold you hostage praise God but you know all these different points of what it means to be sealed and what a seal is amen um I certainly wanted to touch on a few of them amen um so that we can understand uh what it means to be sealed and I think we understand that through being sealed through the word of God God in this hour it has uh loosed the ministry of restoration it has broken the mystery of who we are and what the word means to us right the seal has also made it so that we cannot be compromised once we have that identity once we have this Revelation right the no matter what sickness comes upon you no matter what sin no matter what disease whatever it is the the Bible says the gates of hell cannot Prevail against this Revelation praise the Lord and as I come to a close here I'm going to read a scripture in Revelation chapter 3 verse 20 praise God and it reads behold old I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne praise the Lord now God has given us instructions on what to do to receive him and in this age this only age where God is on the outside knocking in exactly right but God has placed us above this leodan agea and I believe the prophet says that the that that captivity in the book of Jeremiah was a type of the church ages and how we the the the body of Christ has been in captivity all this time but at the end God promises to bring restoration praise the Lord and he says to him that overcome he will set with him in his throne praise the Lord oh my and the message the faith that was once delivered to the Saints 1953 this was preaching West Palm Beach Florida right here in our hometown praise God in paragraph 297 the prophet says now to you to you believers who are standing here let us let us all stand let us all stand Glory you you now to you believers who are standing here seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm very grateful for you I'm grateful that what little Ministry the Lord has given me here has been effective and you believed it come on now praise God now you might not have been here but I say you were here you believed it God will surely bless you for it as a humble servant I've done all that I know how to represent my Lord and I say to you in the Name of Christ Jesus he's standing right here now and he will give each one of you the baptism of the Holy Spirit now the thing you have to do it's a gift it isn't a faith it's a gift you say well I believe I've got to I've got it that don't work it isn't that it's a gift unmerited gift God just gives it to you not because you believe it but because God gives it to you but you've come asking him for it blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be God will give you the Holy Spirit I want you open your heart and say father dear I'm a Believer a Believer I am your child your child I now want the Holy Spirit want the hly to come into my heart come into my heart I lay all the world on the altar lay all the world on the altar I lay everything on the altar everything on the altar now while you're standing here many of you weeping the tears rolling down your cheeks that's the Holy Spirit that's him on you right now just wanting to fill your life if the audience back there could only see the scen standing here young ladies young men elderly people the tears just rolling down their cheeks the holy spirit is hovered out here's the angel of the God standing here it isn't 5T above my head right now the Ang very angel on the picture standing here above him right now just ready to pour himself into every believer praise God and it goes on to say

your hands amen and say thank you thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus I'm so grateful that you give me the baptism of the Holy Spirit you feel the power of God serves through your body you'll be a

this whole thing that God gave us for this year of restoration um has been just mind opening and um and and I already know that I'm not going to be able to get all the sermons out that I still have before the year's over so it's going to be an overlap it's going to carry over amen into into the New Year Praise the Lord and uh and and and I'm looking I'm looking forward to this you know just I I never caught some of the things that he was sharing in scripture one was out of Jeremiah 29 and7 that even when you are in captivity I mean you you you spiritually bound you you you trying to figure your way out of this thing and and don't know you know and even you know so many he said even um when we're when we're dealing with the seal it forces the issue it it forces you to make decisions but even while you're in the process of trying to make a right decision God wants you to prosper and he wants you to be in peace you know and and I I'm like man God just love us so much when God ain't strugg this we the ones that's always struggling right he's a perfect God but when we're struggling he still wants us to prosper and be in peace when we won't even show him the love that he deserves he still wants us to prosper and be in peace what a mighty God we serve man I I tell you that this this this seal forcing the decision and forcing the issue uh I've been there I've been there Amen in my own spirit and and had to make decisions but uh I thank God that when you make your decision and and God always put you in a spot where um he let you be the one to decide he don't make the decision for you because you're a free moral agent but he let you be the one to decide and once you choose oh my God I'm reminded of Amen a quote from the prophet say this uh this is amen my choice this is my choosing and and because you made the right choice this in itself self will make and make and bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine when you make the right choice God has a way of vindicating what you're doing oh I just love the Lord Jesus we appreciate brother Jerry Amen on today wonderful wonderful wonderful amen Thoughts From God wonderful wonderful Thoughts From God I this
