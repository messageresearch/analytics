to share a little experience that I had yesterday before I get into this song I went to a memorial service of a man that I knew what known him most of my life and he was a man that loved life his always does his own way he he had no belief in God and he wasn't ashamed to proclaim that there's no God he everybody met he he he resisted any kind of conversation about the Christian walk our belief in God as a creator in any way whatsoever he used to come by our house over the years it was a brother of my brother-in-law so I knew him for a very very long time and and after I got married he was dropped by not necessarily to visit us but to visit the fruit trees that I heard baby come along and you see evidence that Jerry had been there but it was his memorial service yesterday that his children the informant it was a very sad thing very sad thing the different his talked about a lack of relationship with the dead they had nine he he had a lot of different women a lot of different babies from different women what happened didn't wasn't bothered to any of them but they loved him he was still dead none of his bodies sharing what had happened in the hospital as he was going he had had colon cancer I believe it was and as that progressed they had that force him to go to the hospital and in those last moments of his death his son one of his sons of minister he he had continually tried the witnesses that over the years and that would always say something ugly you know if that is God then I'll do this and see if I could live that's an ugly thing that was disturbing really terrible focus on heart but he still kept trying the witness to his dad and as they death began to approach they all sitting around and and he found he lost consciousness but he was in a state of being between life and death he wasn't communicating I have a niece was a nurse practitioner she happened to be in the room with them and she kept with the doctor about giving him something that would speed things up for him because they knew he wasn't going to me and he they did they gave me whatever this medication was and my niece told that the other kids said it won't be long and it just be two minutes in two minutes you'll be gone two minutes stretch down to ten minutes and a half hour or an hour and they said that their most of the day he hadn't communicated but as death began to approach him he started making sounds and the sounds of thinking eating eating they went on like that for close to an hour and Madison was the nurse she said that that doesn't happen usually two minutes the person is gone but he laid there and he suffered and he was tormented to the very end he was resistant and it was just so sad it just broke my heart we try witnessing to him so many tries but he it was Adam and he I think he got pried out of big rebellious in that way and at that last moment he had his own demons he had to face and it was a very pitiful situation I didn't know that the signal today it just didn't know what but when I woke up this morning this town dropped into my [Music] [Music] me maybe in their Savior me if piracy and say heeey Oh we know thank you [Music] amen the prize

with me amen up to the book of Ephesians I read these scriptures on last week and like I've told you my thoughts were a little mix so the Lord had us go in one direction but I want to come back and preach what was in my heart on today if we can and I'll read from Ephesians 6 they also read from numbers 31 a man as well on today don't forget also one of the other announcements don't forget we want to try to do another outreach and Okeechobee and we have some days set there in effect the second weekend in August we're gonna do it back to school outreach there so keep that in mind you know we'll give you more information as we have approached that but we want to continue our efforts there a man in Okeechobee Florida so here Ephesians 6 and then verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord a man and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil Amen these uh attacks from the enemy sometimes they they sneak attacks right or and in this particular instances esteems schemes you have to be able to be mindful of schemes that that was using a man and one at one of the schemes that the devil uses is sympathy you understand that sympathy is a scheme right that the devil likes to use and if you can just get you to empathize or sympathize a man with some things that you know you just be moved by your emotion right and and you know one another sermon a man that's in my bag I'm not gonna preach today but you know we we make decisions based on how we perceive something and and your perception might not be right all right but but we make decisions based on what we see it and and and you know people can look at situations and somebody might see you know one thing I might you know they tell me you know I look at somebody maybe can I pick on you brother Mia - okay for me to pick on him okay he said okay so you know he you know he came to church and somebody might say well yeah brother Nehemiah you know he was there with the the the checkered jacket right and that's that's what I saw but somebody else they know he was a brother dressed up with a jacket but also had sneakers on right and they're there based on what they see right and then they might keep rain I know he had a jacket but a little thing on their own you know so but people are looking at the same thing but see different things and you making decisions based on what you see that's not my sermon I'm reading for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rules of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with with all prayer and supplications in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints turn with me the numbers chapter 31 and as we had a prayer request own Wednesday night and we pray for sister Gabby I heard she was recently in the hospital but it's good to see in church and a man is born god bless you sister Gabby a man a man thing thank thank the Lord and I that's that little Testament my mama just gave by the man that's preacher material he does mmm-hmm what's gonna be your last words number 31 says in the Lord speaking to Moses saying avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy people and Moses spake unto the people saying ARM arm some of yourselves until the war and let them go against the myth the Midianites and avenge the lord of Midian amen the Lord at a blessing to rename is worthless pray father we thank you for the ability to read the word but we pray that the Spirit of the Lord will help us to a man dig into these things and get more out of what you allowed us to read we take every spirit to get your spirit underneath the control of the Holy Ghost and acts together to take control over the thought here today as we just try to present it to your people get glory in honor get praise Jesus thing we asked him amen god bless you you can be seated so we I wanted to hit this last week and I ended up changing the sermon the Father's Day but we'll we'll try to get to it today one more battle and man one more battle we want to just tap title at that amen on today how many know we are in about I don't know about you but I find that my Christian walk is that after I get out of one I walked right into another one right and and and it just goes to show that uh you know this is a you know no matter what we are in life it's going to be a battle it's gonna be a man of trial it's gonna be a man you know a test of our faith all of these things have to happen and and it's and it's all part of the shaping and molding process that we're going through as believers and God is bringing us to a place of perfection so I just want to kind of talk about this a matter a little bit this morning I'm gonna read a quote out of latency of church age just to get us started but uh you know there was a statement that the Prophet made it says we'll have trial after trial and we'll have test after test a man until the life of Christ is reflected in us so you know to try to run from our tests amen we are not we're not accomplishing much amen because as a believer you gonna go through some things a man and you have to be willing to go through some things a man God God will never put more you than you can bear and and if you know I feel kind of like George Washington a man this morning there was a time a man in the history of the US where the British were coming in and and and the British were trying to you know reclaim this territory and you know you had people like George Washington who was serving in the military at that time and and man he was a general of a depleted group right and and and and I was told that you know this army that he had they didn't have food you know they were one one meal I think they they had you know just I don't know like some beans with vinegar something you know it was it was a really really bad meal but this is all they had in order to to get strength and and not only that you know George Washington was facing a time where you know these guys in the army knew they time was up and he was trying to get them to read reenlist he said because you know if we just keep fighting we're gonna overcome these guys and and and have they not done what they did that America wouldn't be what it is today and what George Washington did in order to get the people to a spot to believe him George Washington jumped in the middle of bullets blind and he rode out there on this horse I was reading a little something that he had about three or four horses get shot but he didn't get shots and he's out down his horse trying to encourage me come on let's keep fighting right come on let's let let's keep let's keep taking this you know to the enemy don't retreat don't go back let's keep fighting you know and that's where I'm approaching this this morning I want to tell the church let's keep frightened we might have one more battle let's write that up a less cheap frightened don't give up now write that quick now whatever you do keep pressing the battle hi Mimi a man in the cuz joins Washington was able to encourage those soldiers to keep battling they overcame the enemy forces a man and by them overcoming we get to enjoy this land to freedom today because they can't fight now I mean I have to have my forefathers not fight what have what would have been our destiny and then if you're gonna keep fighting what's going to be your children's destiny right come on so and then they're dependent you generations are depending on you glory to God enough talking spiritually you've got to keep fighting I don't care what you come up against you've got to keep fighting don't you think about throwing in the towel right don't you think about putting down your sword not top pick up this rules if you brighten the enemy hey man I won't I want you to see something here let's just let me start here in this disarming Laodicean Church age and the Prophet is quoting a man from revelation in 321 he says this it says I'm at paragraph 360 - 1 he says revelation 3:20 went to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame in a set down with my father in his throne and this is key you know it is to him that overcometh so that means you got to have something over come amen listen hold glory let me tell you can't pick your trials right God knows exactly what to give you right so so is to him indifferent us you're gonna have to have some overcome so don't complain about it Amen thank God put the trial that you got especially designed a man to kick kick brownie out of your life this person is on just for you and God knows you can handle it that's why he's sitting in your direction your neighbor might not be able to handle it but you can handle this just help or your neighbor and said you got this you got this you got this come on let me let me go says now now what we what do we know overcome this that is them that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual fault of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical flip up it doesn't matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome listen now a quick look at those pictures which involved the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is dipped in of the devil he overcame the person some tasted the Satan by the word and by oh hold up hold up hold up hold up you ain't gonna overcome with emotion ya got overcome with feelings you've got an only only only overcome with the words and I can't help but inject this just hold it there for me for a second you know we were when we when we just went to Israel you know this this time we had an opportunity to go to mount temptation and I don't see that the first time I went but you know we were we were standing pretty much we didn't go up on top of but we were standing right in front of it and and I'm sitting and I'm looking at Mount temptation and I begin to think about you know Jesus up there in the wilderness and he's and how to devil for 40 days just bring in test after test after test you know and Jesus just sitting there and didn't use any supernatural power right but all he kept telling the devil it is written when the devil bring and this is why you got to know the word because when you fightin the devil the devil don't bring you the word y'all will get that you only get the devil will preach to you the word you wanna know who the first preacher in the Bible was the devil he took the word David Eve I am his own interpretation to it and should begin the video next right and if you're not careful don't allow the death to bring scripture to you you get confused and don't know what you feeling which high bar to go by the devil want to trick you with or he want to use your weapon against you but we were standing there you know this you know as we were standing and I'm just looking to have a little shop setup here for people to you know to buy things you know and everything and they got a little camel for everybody if you want to ride and it's little fella you had to be about ten years old and he he controlled the camera and and he and he he got the cab when man y'all should've saw sister cause she got it from that camera and she was riding it again fella say America Amen hallelujah you know any say say put your hands up and take your picture you know when we doing on this right you know right right near Mount temptation and you know and as I'm gonna sit there just looking I'm taking some of the pictures I'm just imagining in my mind Jesus on top of this mountain overcoming the devil without his supernatural power oh I don't know if y'all been asked this question but recently I was asked this question if you could have if you can have one supernatural power one if you could just have one which one would it be if you could have one Superman which one with it because you know everybody into these uh these superheroes right everybody I mean you want to be Superman you want to be Batman do you want to be who these little guys together huh [Music] who else see that we got us looking at their own things but let's keep my eyes on the work notice this notice this what he says it says he overcame the truth of this proposition in Matthew for wearing Jesus is tempted to the devil he overcame the personal temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only it says in each of these major trials that correspond it exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden these are major trials is that what everybody facing the lust of the flesh brother Jack I just can't overcome yes you can if you committed to God you can overcome right the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the proud of life these are three things that we that we have to overcome Jesus overcame by the word Eve fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell and direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail so you want to know if you overcome it let's see if you apply the word alright Amen not feeling any motion about I'm already telling you hear anybody talking to you and fill us any motions you already know they defeated they already know that and the only way you can get them back is you got to give them the word don't answer today the emotions they start crying you start crying right and you are you you knew does love but then we got you that that's where you wanted you right there right sometimes you got to have a what we call a face like flint right they crowded it there's no mean if you don't care is that you're not getting involved in emotional side of this because we can't let that devil trick us with our emotions we're the battle church right we have a real battle you know George Washington when you got the fellas that they say now I know the way he eliminated emotion they say he said look I'm gonna make sure that y'all didn't leave before it's time to leave if you if you travel II shot in the back and then if somebody's sitting around talking about leaving so you're gonna get lashes I mean it's gonna get a whipping grown man grown man right he had that he had the scare fear out of them now we ain't gonna do none of that y'all know that I got happen here but but what I am Telling is that we got to be ready for this one more battle and what I'm trying to do is get you prepared you know at a time of peace you need to prepare for war alright let me let me go a little further cuz I got to bring this in says uh now remember this church ok I'm actually I'm skipping to the next quote here this is revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 15 three it says now remember this says Christ in the church in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church now y'all gotta just y'all bear with me as I just take time to read these things I know we've read them many many times before but but where does the Antichrist character spirit come to the Spirit comes into the church right and this is why you got to be so careful because if you can't recognize a spirit the devil get you right the Antichrist spirit will come into the church amen and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless and expose this thing revealing us works tempted instruction of God's people and look at this and the discrediting of God's words now we have seen that as soon as you see somebody's trying to spit in the words you already know something wrong right here and it don't take a rocket scientist right you already know you're in a battle so if you are ok I got this one I got it and the first thing I would say I see you devil I see I see exactly what you trying to do I'm not even entertaining the conversation listen he say he said so so the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word look at this now now look at how long this gonna happen right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire so this battle that I'm trying to get you to see the devil don't keep fighting until he's cast into the lake of fire and I just say you'd be cast into the lake of fire but until he is cast into the lake of fire he gonna keep coming against you look at he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army listen if they get a true revelation of the to spirit and notice where the spears are notice well yeah that's two spirits within within the framework of the Christian Church and this what you'll need by God's Spirit discern in Winston oh it's one thing to discern it but it's a whole nother thing to a standard so this is why I'm reading you put on the whole arm of God right because you're going to need that to be able to withstand but the enemy is actually doing in this out amen oh god oh god oh god church you know you know as Jesus ministry was coming to a close his sermons got tougher and tougher read the book of John read the book of John you'll start seeing as this vicious guy did their mean he starts saying some things that they hadn't heard before you of your father the devil you know what they never heard words like that from any preacher in a pulpit but the things going to get tougher and tougher and as it you know for us as ministers we have to deal with spirits you know and and and my job man I'll tell you when I'm trying to encourage the people to keep fighting and it's now don't give in to this stuff I've one more battle one more one more all right let's keep going I got I got some things to say here all right since doubt spear disorder withstand amen the Antichrist spear Satan will be powerless before he will be definitely thought of today as when Christ was stood his every effort to gain power for him in the desert yes take the hates revelation but we love it we're true revelations in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now I took you to numbers 30 and I read this a man about Moses I just noticed something here first one says Lord spake unto Moses saying of hims the children of Israel of the Midianites afterwards shut down be gathered unto thy people now if I understand correctly Moses was you know about forty years a man raised up in Egypt forty years on the backside of the desert and then his last four he's used to bring the children visitor out so wrap roughly around 120 years old Moses is before he dies roughly 100 120 years old and if we notice the scripture it says now you know and we can focus on what happened with the meeting like this was when you know Balaam got introduced and all of that God didn't like that the way that got introduced to the amongst the people and he was telling Moses going to benjin but when I come here a man when I looked at it just before Moses died God said now you're going to be gathered to you people this mean that Moses is about to die but just before he dies God says I've instituted of Israel of the many nights afterward shalt thou be gathered unto that people what he said Moses get ready for one more battle and I read it in 20 right gets pitch yourself prepared not only you but give the people prepare for one more battle right now I know you're all Moses I know that you know you might be a you might be even a little sick in your body I don't know what's the conditions but I want you to get yourself prepared for one more battle all the way down to the Thompsons Manas get ready lead the earth he has to battle and what I'm trying to get you to see is that it's never gonna get easy but we have to we have to govern our minds we have to govern our spirit to note that we are enter into a battle desert in which there is dead let the spirit of the enemy and I wanna you know kind of talk about these battles here I wanna I want I want you to understand something that the devil don't fight there and the devil the devil's like I picked up something here in 1st 1st 17 17 I want y'all to look at this devil 1st Samuel 17 let's just follow him he don't fight fair and he is Elijah so anytime that the devil open his mouth you already know yes a lot you ain't gotta believe I don't care how much it sound like the truth it's a lie now let's just just follow me here first 17 the verse 8 through 10 this is a man of Goliath this is a big devil right and he's coming out against the children of Israel and notice what he says here in 1st Samuel 17 verse 8 he says up and he stood and crowd up to the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in array m9i of Philistine and ye servants of Saul choose your man that you would let him come down to me and if he'd be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants that this is the deal if he fights with me and he kills me then he said I'm representing the Philistines we're gonna become your servants listen said but if I prevail it gives him and kill him then you Shep then shall you be our servants and serve us and the pillars pound say I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together now hear the devil has made a deal he's making a pact then if y'all sent a warning out here the man fights with me and he defeats me then we Phyllis paths are going to be your service but I'm here to tell you that the devil is alive because David showed up David went about Venus latest David but I found over here second Samuel chapter 21 now I want to tell you something about this devil look at this look at this year and this is this is even you know I'm a regis step ii sent me to me when i'm starting at verse 15 you can't make no deal with the devil you can't sympathize with him he's not gonna keep his end of the bargain you know you want to know how bad this is I ought to give you know before we even get the second segment two and one could listen this is another battle but before we get there you know David David not only defeated this devil but David at one time in his life before he became king right David was running a man to actually serve with the Philistines and do you know the same fill spots that told him if they'll defeat I would challenge and if don't kill him will sort of you you know them save those times when David in the camp was dealing with scheming to actually go against the Israelites with David indicator that lets you know the devil will use you in a blue tune of the way he was done you can't trust no devil you can't sympathize with the devil because you know before you know it hear the same devil that promised him that we gonna serve you it's not as things that want to use them to go against his own people y'all get that all the lord have mercy that's a spirit oh that's the spirit look look at this just dis fun let's pile them in second Samuel 21 I'm just showing you how the devil's a light it's just all it's right there in the Bible look at this and I want y'all to catch some keywords in here in verse 15 says moreover the Philistines had yet war again that's a key word had yet working I thought I thought the deal was we weren't gonna have any more war I thought y'all gonna serve us but here had yet war again listen with Israel David went down their service with them and fought against the Philistines David wax Feng and ish Vietnam which was the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weight 300 seconds of brass and weight being he being girded with a noose war thought to have slain David listen and a beside the son of Sir Isaac or him and smoke the pillar style and killed him then the men of David swear unto him saying thou shalt not go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the fire the fight the lights of Israel look at verse 18 and it came to pass tonight I just finished this battle right they came to pass after this after they done defeated the field stop licking that there was again a battle another keyword right with who The Fearless times the same guys that promised that they would stop fighting this is the third paddle alright uh uh width of those fans at gob then a civic I the who should fight slew staff which was of the sons of the time just get something here list is good things Goliath had boys not only they have boys he had brothers right and their boy I saw their daddy go down so here they get a spirit on them they want to keep these walls going and notice the one I just read say he had a a noose wars he thought with his new sport that he can do something he didn't know who he was fighting and let me tell you that some people with a new sport today a new revelation a new understanding and they come in to kiss the bride but you meter people run more battles and even and see this is a good thing about it even David got tired on the battlefield it's good to know that you got some young warriors we need we need some young warriors see I'm getting to a certain age when I'm counting crustal we need some young man that'll rise up and say I'm ready to slay Goliath is this you already got the laughs I'll take that it's tough I'll take out his problem rain is heinous in me than he that's in the work we need you mean that Eliza can I keep reading here Oh glory to God look at this look at this verse 19 it says and now now now we not just in these few verses about seven verses of scriptures there's there's three or four battles and these verses with the same group of people the same ones that promise that we're not gonna fight no more will serve you so you don't don't let the devil make no deal with you because he's not going to keep it and you oh yeah the devil said he'll do it's not gonna happen I'm showing you a scripture that is not gonna happen so you can't make you can't make any agreements with the devil oh my god your job is to slay Devils all right let me go on I got more to read here this up in verse 19 and there was again a battle in gob with the Philistines where ll hain and the son of joram a Bethlem at slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a Weaver's beam over swimming money every time this devil come up we find in the same pattern the people of God are not being defeated let me go verse 20 and there was yet battle in gap here's another battle right ah where was a man of great stature that handled never had six fingers in and on every foot six toes for and 20 and number and he also was borne to the Giant and when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Samaria the brother of date David slew him these four were born to the Giant and Gath and failed by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants we found him roughly four to five battles just in these few scriptures shows you that the devil is a liar and he will not stop fighting he's gonna fight until he's cast into the lake of fire and since he's gonna fight I'm here to encourage the church get ready for one more battle and after you overcome this one you get really have to overcome another one and after you overcome that one you get ready to overcome another but it's not it's not it's about what you have to overcome it's how and you want to know how to overcome use the same word that you're using to beat the first temple that same word would defeat the nextel it is written it is written you don't need a superpower you just need the words you got more than enough when you got the word can I go in a little further look at this just I was I was looking at there and another another I won't read all of the scripture here but I'll just tell you the story you want to know somebody else later on the scripture that came in came up against the Philistines a saying Phyllis time's right that you know actually this was earlier early in scripture these same Phyllis times but at one time they fought Sampson had a fight with him and Samson you know he the Bible said that he slew 30 Philistines and took thirty changes of garments and this was after he pressed his wife to give them an answer to a riddle that they couldn't figure out and you know they pressured his wife and she got she got the ants out of Samson and she gave the answer to it to these men all right hallelujah now notice you know you got to watch things like this because a woman and the scripture represents the church hallelujah now first of all scepter should have been married to this particular woman right his dad even facto said not is there any other woman amongst to Phyllis I mean muster Israelites that you might want to marry why are you going down amongst these Phyllis times to try to marry one of them and he but she keys me daddy please just-just-just make it happen his daddy went on do you know what what he wanted and it got down there and its first encounter with this lady she done tricked him into something he married thought he was in love and he uh she'd come and get the secret from what you know why don't you tell me what what happened here you know and what's the real what's supposed to mean in this riddle so he gives her the secret and and next to another guy showed up on the seventh day and they had the answer to the riddle and they just bloody they they thought they did it Sampson got so upset he got up and he went and the Bible said he went and found 30min because he said I'm gonna give you thirty changes the garment if they'll get the riddle he went and found 30 pills times and killed them all took they took that garment and then gave them to the other Philistines well he didn't stay with his wife after this battle Sampson got up went back to his father's house and and the Bible said after some time he showed back up to his wife's house and when he got there this is why he was full to be down there messing with her in the first place what happened when he got there did that but daddy said I thought you was never coming back so I gave her to somebody else now you don't gave my wife away what are you doing came away what is this Samson got mad again look at what happened the Bible says this and it says he took Fox's tied their tails together and then he burned down all the fields of the Philistines now you know that messed up nesting up and I see and you know the field times got a little upset then food was destroyed so now you think they're gonna stop messing with Samson no guess what happened in the Bible the Bible said he wanted to retaliate and it states that when they came against a person you know from retaliating for for burning a fields the Bible says Samsung slew them with slew them hip and thigh with a great slaughter we don't know how many died but a lot of felis times died when Samson got upset I won't try to read this verse with me Genesis 15 11 just read this with me these Devils just won't stop and since they won't stop we not gonna stop we're gonna keep getting ready for battle so just 15 just read this bit me hey man I think I want to read I starting at verse 11 here if I can judges 15 11 the Bible says this then 3,000 men of Judah went to the top of the rock eat them and set the samson I think I might have the wrong script you let me just keep reading sister rock it and set the samson north style not that the Phils time to rules over us what is this that iris done it to us said them as they did unto me so have I done to them and they said unto Him we are come down to Bondi that we may deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines in the census that to them swear unto me that ye will not follow up unto yourselves and they spoke and they spake of damned stand no but we will bomb the fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cores and brought him up from the rock and when the and when he came unto Lee ha the Philistine shouted against him the spear Lord came mightily upon him and the core core is that were whereupon his arms became as flex that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed off from his hands and he found a new job own oven a stand put forth his hand and took it as food a thousand men therewith and Sampson stamped with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass having slain a thousand man now you think after Samson was going through this experience with these Philistines that this would be enough this one man justly 1000 men by his self and you would think that they would leave this fella alone you think the battle would be over I mean and I don't know I don't know about y'all but some of y'all made maybe you better might not be like Samson we don't slayed a thousand a Devils that I mean a thousand people at one time but a thousand don't make maybe you haven't done it but but there's some things that you have overcome there are some big things in your life that you have overcome and you would think that the devil would stop fightin happen it didn't happen and this is what I want you to know just because you get a victory don't mean it's over just for you you you go you're gonna get yourself you're gonna get some mighty features hallelujah God deliver you bringing out the hospital with you go get some great things I think but the devil gonna be right there with another battle oh my God my God my God look at this the next thing that happened to that is that the Samson is that he got tied up with the light and you know what I'm saying Devils come back around working with his wife now again his second wife Ellen catch that it was the second wife and he again he should not have been married to these women in the first place but here down here he should have learned from the first wife but now he'd come right back down and get married to a Delilah and now then his first wife give away the secret what you think the second wife of the Philistines going to do she gave away his secret of as to where his strength was and when them Devils got ahold of that information they took sensing put him and and and it was so bad church date they took his eyes out they plucked his eyes out the man ended up in a really really bad spot but you know here's a good thing that I find was Sam since that why he was dead he knew he was still in Bali he was in prison he had no more eyes and and maybe it looked like he didn't have any more strength but the one thing about Samson he had a he had a prayer in this state and his prayer was God let me be advanced you know of what the enemy has done to me and he cried out once more Lord hallelujah and what I'm saying sometime in the mists of your one more battle you might have to cry out once more Lord if you pout you do before then is a way to put you through again one small little whatever you do don't give up on the devil Andrus Ansip late that place at La Villita ah mrs. Willis Pam he was where he was going to say Phil Spector's that was his old job that was just that was his his reason for testing was to kill pilasters but hear you say Lord I will fill you so many times but I'm willing I'm willing I'm willing right now to die with these Philistines he acts a little boy should just lead me to the pills lead me to the pillars and they say when I get here to the pillars they say he said he's a loop once to have man where he wants to just to do pillars that's keeping a building structure up just leaking right down between everybody want over just laughing and giggling watching the weather what is this guy doing he knew exactly where to be and he prayed that prayer and put his hands on the pillars and when he prayed my god the strength began to come back in his body his hat begin the gruel again Oh somebody need their they spiritual hair the gorillas can and something they naturally had a girl again - as a sister you're not supposed to cut your hair you need your how to grow again hello somebody the virus they don't cut now the Bible tells sister not to cut the hair but it also tell the brothers you're half man not supposed to be walking around looking like a woman and a woman not supposed to be walk around looking like a man all right now somebody there's a difference in the sexes hey man God know what he talking about so woman not supposed to cut her hair and a man is supposed to cut is there if you don't cut your hair you might want to pray light sense once the lords and it began to pray and the strength they say since I say them them locks begin the girl here and the strength came back in the Samson he pushed a man them pillows down and and at his death more Fela Styles died at his death then those that died while he was living I can tell you right now you can kill Moe Devils when you're ready to die to yourself and why don't you kill him they got cousins they got brothers they got nephews they got nieces and they all coming right back to try to attack again but be ready for one more battle can I go on a little further this is something that I want to read a man about Abraham Oh glory to God look at this this is out of possessing the gifts that the enemy's gifts this is a about Abraham since God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises so Abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world would be blessed that he have a son and this son out of him should come forth the seed that would bless the whole earth and Abraham when the promise was given to him was 75 years old and staring his wife was 65 years old but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God and God time after time tested him but he come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen and that's what I want to kind of bring to your attention how do you know you're not at your final test and if you're there in just a couple questions if you're at your final test God is watching your actions and your reactions now once you understand when Abraham after his final test God asks him to do something that was just ridiculous if something that had never been done before right here God gave a promise now imma give you a child in Euro age he got the son and he said now through this board through his lineage you know the horse is going to be blessed Ruth used to promise them Isaac was now here the here the promise God tells him to take the same boy that he gave to him all for him as a sacrifice I want you to I want you to get this because this was something you know Abraham went through a tests that he thought he'd never seen before and I'm gonna tell you something today you all have gone through some tests that you thought you've never seen how many of when you look around saying our Lord I was not expecting nothing like that my family I wouldn't expect a nothing like that I Lord I wouldn't I mean you know maybe if it's if it's a sickness that hits but I wouldn't expect it nothing like that if it's a person that backs last I wasn't expecting that I thought for sure this one was strong I thought for sure you don't expect these things but it's just the test now my question is how do you know it's not the final test if it is the final test how are you gonna react how you gonna respond to it if it's the final test because I wonder if my question is if it's the final test you give up now but you persevere through this how do you know it's not the final test right I mean because you know you know I mean here here here God you know what will send something away to see whether you know sympathize or empathize with it are you gonna stay with his word Abraham had to prove that he was gonna stay with his word like my brother Jules say ain't no way Abraham told his wife what he was get ready to do he didn't get up that more say now Sarah this morning you know the Lord spoke to me and the Lord told me to take Isaac and offer him at this mountain he gonna show me the mountain to eat he'll show me where to go ain't no way Sara would have let abraham get out the house with a revelation like that so he couldn't tell her yeah and not only did he not tell her he didn't even tell his service what was giving happen but God was using that to test Abraham's faith now I want you to know Abraham publication Abraham persevered through that Abraham made it and because he made it look at this let's read this let's read this III got this in Genesis 22 verse 16 through 18 see I'm used to seeing different people backsliding and come back to the Lord I'm used to seeing new types of things I don't you know I backslidden you know and just and then the lord have to get my attention you know I've seen that happen but but but this is a different test this is a different trial right that this trial is not just backsliding but it's denouncing don't get that it's not just bad spot it's actually absolutely coming out and denouncing the faith I've never expected that how many I can say up oh I saw this coming you didn't see that coming when it happens can I just preach can I just talk to y'all because we all affected by some of your closest friends it happens to your family members it happens too but God is watching your reaction and the midst of it are you go simple fast are you gonna stay with the word cuz it's only one way to overcome not with a superpower don't all the way you can overcome is with word and you say well what work cuz that's why so you gotta know cuz they can use the same word it gives you and if you don't know if you don't know that you might have a just conversation sometimes sometimes you might not have the answer there's been times I've been in situations I just did not have the answer right then and since I don't have the answer you know mass is I get back to you when you're gonna get back to me when God give it to me I give it to you I get back to you but I'm not gonna stay here and go tit for tat with you hallelujah something about it so you got you got you know that you know sometimes your look is like you know well because it's everything change the conversation change everything changes now our dynamics change we can't talk about what we used to talk about anymore right we're gonna talk about the weather but when it comes to this word is different you might as well say man but when you look at all of this my question is is this the final test is this the final battle is this what is this what we come down to right and if we gotta overcome it's not gonna be through sympathy we can't sit and cry together about our hurts and pains look you ain't no only one been hurt all that's been hurt Oh Lord you don't hold me pull them into something now I was thinking this and the Holy Ghost disappears Jesus tears well they'll say we Christians not dead our plants they have to be pet it a pipe airplane you always got a worries but a real Christian air like that a Christian know how to encourage their self when everybody yes he's gonna get him you realize even even even in the dates of the murders fellas knew how to stand for Christ if it lived my life I'm giving up my life for this then I want a women that started babies put the back sorry babies put the death almost and police work and then back down in their face and we're people standing with testimonies like that god help us to stand in this hour we gotta face one more battle it might be the hardest when we have a face but don't you talk about right now something you've never seen before well I mean ten years ago we would have never even thought to even talk about things like this 20 years ago when we come into this message we no no no no we would never thought nothing like this that's why I said that the spirits are with him discern and whisk damn from within not only outside everybody you know we've always talked about well I'm not worried about denomination I'm not where we already knew what they had but we did not know what was happening on the inside people I mean you this close to go Touhou I mean when the meetings together you share a room together you know you know we eat together we we do you like my grandma say we sleep together I like about it it's a different time be careful it works like that but but we have you have so much expel ship right but but you know here here we get to this point where you know and and I'm gonna tell you I'm just I'm this is this is this is my feeling most of the people that get into this situation they've been hurt somewhere they've been hurt somewhere and that hurt the devil anoints it and when it gets there behind that heard he just forgive it just work and love anomaly how they been hurt but they refused they refused to allow God to heal the hurt how you know that because they're still talking about hurt that happen years ago the other person move alone but they still stuck they stuck and they refused to me and this is my people wheel you've got you got you got allowed God to heal you see the reason the reason you got to see it so he can prove to you that he's a healer the reason you got a little discouraged so he can come in just just just showed up next thing you show you how he kidding I'll walk with you see it's not just a summer walk with me Lord welcomes no no you have to actually experience that but because of hurt people make decisions people make they do things and and I'm looking at all of this you know just happen there right before something like that like I saw you when you start listening to the hurt watch it did you start the sympathize and they didn't want to you oh no and you're making a decision based on the information you have can I tell you about something else any story any story you hear is two sides to it and if you only listen to one side you're making the wrong decision and sometimes you know let me just put it this way you are not a mediator Jesus is so you don't need that well let me get these two together no no no no what you need to do is tell them if you got the Bible tell us what to do I'm trying to get us back to the river if we go I become we gotta overcome by the way if somebody's a pigeon what does the Bible tell you to do we posted we let everybody know that we offended right we do everything against the word and then we expect somehow to stake the work out I'm going to tell you something about your posts you can delete them you can but they already been they already been seen and the thing of it is is once it's been seen you can't delete that can I just talk a little bit to this woman lad on the pastor Pasteur was in town and doing a good job to the church and this lady lied and said the past is there something I knew that he didn't do the board called a past day and said we don't we got to get rid of your pastor got an accusation against him he had to get rid of me he said but it didn't happen well she said I said it didn't the past it didn't happen it didn't happen like that well she said say okay all right well we got to get rid of your pastor so start packing his stuff and all up working all the way putting this suitcase getting it all in this car taking his family and as he's you know getting ready to church that that woman that came up with that lie oh my she felt so guilty oh I didn't know it's gonna turn out like this you know my I'm so sorry and she she jumped up she ran to the pastor said pastor I want to repent I'm sorry I said there's ninety eight distant and I know that didn't happen and you know and I'm so sorry pastor I'm so sorry he said sister I forgive you I forgive you but if you don't mind follow me follow me he took a pillar out of the car and he walked up to the top of the of the roof of the other of the other church and they had a bail up there and you know a little opening and everything where they ringing the bell so he took the pillow and he said I got a knife and he sliced the pillow and his feathers all in the pillow and then he just he just he just it just let the fellas go out to the wind he said sister would you go pick up all them feathers and bring them back to me see pastor that's impossible so that's what your apology is you know spread all this stuff and it's what do people think about me you come back to me and see you sorry but the damage has already been done see the Bible tells us how to handle stuff if we'll follow biblical principles and I'm going to tell you this right now a lot of what we got going on is because full did not follow biblical principles then follow so we get ourselves up for one more panel it won't stop it won't stop til you die it's going to be battle after battle after battle can I just read about Abraham and I let it go I'm in Genesis 22 oh my god I have a question for you do you love God more than you love your friend do you love God more than you love your family do you love God more than anything else Genesis 22 verse 16 Abraham was stood as I said by myself I've sworn said the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son not only son he took him final test he took that boy up there to be offered and God made a way for Abraham he had a ram in the bush for Abraham and God said God is coming down down he's he said Abraham I by myself I have a sworn said the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son and only Son listen is that and blessing I will bless thee say I have the spot right there right after Abraham have proved his love to God and this is where you you this is where we are right now we have to prove our love to God look I love you I love you I love you and I love you but I love God so much more and after he proved his love to God notice this the Bible says and blessing I will bless thee and when I looked at that I said you know I'm not gonna worry about whether my job don't come through I'm not gonna worry about whether one of my family members gonna come through God is the one that promised to bless me after year prove themself in blessing I will bless thee listen says I will multiply that seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and this is the other part Abraham because you stood your seed vast eat shell possess the gate of his enemies you know what that tell me that in my one last battle I got a promise you know why because I'm a seed of Abraham and all of Abraham's seed is supposed to possess the gates of their enemies don't look at the trial don't look at the trouble don't look at the situation look at the promise you already know how this thing gonna work out that's why I can tell you that just in cursive um you got this you got this don't be afraid of this battle you got this it's gonna be all right it might be the last battle Church it might be one that we've never seen before it might be the last one but somehow this thing will work out and when I pray I pray that that statement out of Mother's Day for the prophecy is somehow majestic fingers will begin to untie all the night and that's what my friend Lord let majestic fingers come in and untie fall into every question that somebody might have let majestic fingers come in and untie the knots bring peace to the midst of the storm but I'd say what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna compromise I'm not gonna sympathize I'm gonna stand with this word I'm preparing myself but just one more battle let me finish reading that quote possessed it if the enemy's gates the prophets said it God time after time tested him but it comes to that final test before the blessing was going to happen and that's the way it is with all the seed of Abraham God gives us that final chest just before he gives the promise and if it was possible I'd like to see something in person but I would hold that that final test to see how you react upon it and when he give when he had gave Abraham this test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started are you still just as true as you were when you started see what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing will stand just as true as we did when we stood here and accepted it no matter what the doctor said stand just as true no matter what you're going through church stands just that's true I encourage you take on the whole armor fella that's the only way you don't be able to stand get you get your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace peace take the sword of the Spirit put on the breastplate of righteousness put on the helmet of salvation and when y'all leave here today get ready for battle this is not a picnic this is a war and I feel like David David had a another battle what would the Phyllis time you know when he was when he was going get ready to join up with the feel it's time to go fight you know the Phyllis Don said no no he's gonna turn in the battle and he's gonna probably join right back up with you know with the Israelites so we can't use him so they still him back you know what David went back he found that he doesn't left get ready to face the power you know he just left and went back home and found all his stuff was gone wife children everybody go when he got there he like Lord what is this and not only was he discouraged for the men that were with him got discouraged they got so discouraged a look that they've said maybe we don't kill this fellow what kind of leader is he we don't lost everything the Bible say David encouraged himself in the Lord and now was that David encouraged himself in the Lord David begin the pre any like he acts God should I pursue we need to stop an ex-con the same question should I pursue cuz some things you don't need assume he said should I pursue and and I don't let will I recover oh and God got responses they were say say pursue and thou shalt recover all church David went looking for his family and God's just so happened to happen one guy get got sick think he couldn't keep traveling with the army got haven't got away and thanks this man could not travel with the arm and honestly you know you just sew up dead weight to us we're gonna leave you here to
