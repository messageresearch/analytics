[35:25] [Music]
[35:29] we were made the way
[35:37] [Applause]
[35:41] thank you sister ma'am
[35:44] let's turn our feet and read the
[35:47] scripture to scriptures ma'am like like
[35:57] my god my god what a very familiar
[36:03] scriptures we read this last week and we
[36:05] want to continue I thought on Christ's
[36:07] faithful forerunner want to read from
[36:12] Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 and then
[36:18] also from Revelation chapter 10 and
[36:21] verse 7 as we just continue our thought
[36:26] and it was just to me it's a blessing
[36:30] that we get a chance to open the Bible
[36:34] and then actually understand what we're
[36:39] eating right I mean if I just read it to
[36:46] this congregation you all know what that
[36:49] means right I mean you already know what
[36:53] it means and and it's just to me it's a
[36:56] beautiful thing you know we here are the
[37:00] folk you know and see how the Fogo to
[37:02] church and then you want to the purpose
[37:05] what was the purpose behind people
[37:07] gathering all right and some just want
[37:10] to go for shout some wanna jump you know
[37:15] or something like that but we come a man
[37:19] because we want the Word of God that we
[37:21] can draw closer to God a man he told us
[37:24] that if we were drawing not to
[37:26] him then he would also draw nigh to us a
[37:29] man I'm trying to become more like Jesus
[37:33] a man I want to walk like him I want to
[37:36] talk like him I want to act like him I a
[37:39] man you you trying to be like Jesus yes
[37:42] yes I sure am a man that is my goal to
[37:47] be like Christ I want people to mistake
[37:49] me for Jesus name so a man we have
[37:58] purpose for what we're doing a man we
[38:00] thank God for all things but let's let's
[38:02] read amen these scriptures Malachi
[38:05] chapter 4 a man - and I like to say to
[38:09] message believers this is very familiar
[38:12] a man verse 5 it says behold I will send
[38:17] you Elijah the Prophet a man before the
[38:25] coming of the Great and dreadful day of
[38:29] the Lord a man and that's that's
[38:32] important is even before the coming of
[38:35] that greeting dreadful day of the Lord
[38:38] Elijah suppose have come and he shall
[38:41] turn the heart of the father's to the
[38:43] children and the heart of the children
[38:45] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[38:49] the earth with a curse
[38:52] Amen so before the Great and dreadful
[38:56] day of the Lord actually occurs
[38:59] somebody's heart would have already been
[39:03] changed amen had their heart not been
[39:06] changed God would have come and smooth
[39:09] the earth with a curse so if I could put
[39:12] it this way because you hear judgment
[39:15] hasn't struck a man not the real thing a
[39:21] man we what we see is just kind of you
[39:26] know I would our practice a man but we
[39:30] ain't seen nothing yet
[39:32] the whirling see nothing yet but that's
[39:33] because you're here a mandate the
[39:36] blessings of God is upon you and you
[39:40] holding up some judgment all right all
[39:43] right let's look over here in Revelation
[39:45] 10 and verse 7 it says this but in the
[39:51] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[39:55] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[40:01] of God should be finished as he hath
[40:03] declared to his servants the prophets
[40:07] amen the mystery of God should be
[40:09] finished as you have declared two
[40:11] servants the prophets let's pray over
[40:13] God's Word father we thank you once
[40:16] again for the word of the Lord that has
[40:18] been arraigned and God as we would just
[40:22] endeavor
[40:23] upon this thought of Christ's faithful
[40:25] forerunner we trust Lord that she would
[40:28] just bring clarity and understanding to
[40:30] us and Lord I know sometimes as a
[40:33] believers that have been walking in this
[40:35] way for such a while we may take for
[40:38] granted some of the things that we we
[40:40] hear the things we believe but there are
[40:42] people God that are watching this maybe
[40:45] for the first time and maybe just
[40:48] through this season Lord of this
[40:50] pandemic they they didn't know where to
[40:52] go and they decided to tune into to this
[40:56] stream they could have tuned in anywhere
[40:58] you don't make mistakes you don't you
[41:01] know do things haphazardly you work
[41:05] according to predestination and father
[41:07] we just believe through your
[41:09] foreknowledge you would have people to
[41:11] be tuned in you have different ones that
[41:13] would come into the church in this
[41:15] season just a visit and in life
[41:18] circumstances put them in a place where
[41:21] they have to be here now again you're
[41:23] not making mistakes when you do things
[41:25] like that so help us to take our
[41:27] responsibility as believers and Lord to
[41:30] share truth with people because we
[41:32] realize
[41:34] we don't have much longer here so the
[41:35] truth is what's gonna make us free so
[41:38] Lauren speak truth to each and every
[41:40] heart today and bring revelation
[41:41] understanding your prophet said if
[41:43] revelations beyond us look up and ask
[41:45] God for so we're asking you Father to
[41:48] bring revelation today in the name of
[41:50] Jesus we pray amen amen god bless you
[41:53] can be seated
[41:54] amen again we are just continuing a
[42:01] thought on Christ's faithful forerunner
[42:05] we started this last week and we were
[42:09] using a quote about the faithful
[42:14] forerunner and I used it from spoken
[42:16] words original see but this this this
[42:18] this this particular sermon will will
[42:21] start from permian church age and I want
[42:24] to start with paragraph 170 3-3 a man
[42:28] perfect me in church age 173 - 3 this is
[42:33] pretty much the same quote that I was
[42:35] using last week but in the church age
[42:38] book it has been modified a little bit
[42:41] and you know we had different people
[42:43] just kind of writing and helping shape
[42:46] the words that the Prophet was
[42:48] presenting and so we get it a little
[42:50] different than the church's book but
[42:51] nonetheless the message is still the
[42:52] same
[42:53] a man in the census then King John the
[42:59] Baptist's Christ faithful forerunner so
[43:02] that's where our title is Christ
[43:05] faithful forerunner the mighty prophet
[43:08] for his date now and that whole
[43:10] statement says dim came John the Baptist
[43:12] Christ faithful full running full Runner
[43:15] the mighty prophet for his day so we
[43:17] know that the forerunner or a forerunner
[43:20] was John the Baptist we realized that a
[43:23] man let's go up says the mighty prophet
[43:25] was day he
[43:27] did not go to his father's school nor
[43:29] the school of the Pharisees he went to
[43:32] no denomination but out to the
[43:35] wilderness called there by God there he
[43:38] stayed unto the Lord sent him out with
[43:40] the message crying the Messiah is at
[43:43] hand praise God when we were in our
[43:46] denominational churches we didn't even
[43:48] know God sent a prophet a man they
[43:51] couldn't pick these things up in
[43:53] Scripture and share this with us amen
[43:56] most people that actually came to the
[43:58] understanding of God sent a prophet our
[44:02] people that actually left somewhere
[44:04] hallelujah somebody people that might
[44:07] have left a denominational Church people
[44:09] that might have left the things of the
[44:11] world people that you know left
[44:12] somewhere to come into this you you you
[44:14] you ran into a place where you got sick
[44:17] and tired a manner just playing games in
[44:20] church glory to God you got sick and
[44:22] tired of maybe somebody preaching the
[44:24] exact same thing over and over again
[44:27] with no substance amen to it you know
[44:30] you got sick and tired of Amen people
[44:33] avoiding certain parts of the scripture
[44:35] you just got tired of this you were you
[44:37] knew there was more to this than what
[44:39] you were hearing he meant you had to
[44:40] leave somewhere to come to this
[44:44] let's see be the name of the Lord
[44:46] hallelujah so you know we thank God it
[44:48] was God dealing with us why we were
[44:50] there and he brought us to this truth
[44:51] amen for a reason now you know I want to
[44:54] just saw we're gonna go back and circle
[44:56] back around to Amen some things we said
[44:58] last week and then we're gonna go
[45:00] forward that that quote that I just read
[45:02] said then came John the Baptist now
[45:04] that's not brother branham writing I
[45:07] mean I'm saying that that is actually
[45:08] the angel of the Lord tellin brother
[45:11] Branham to sing that amen the Angels
[45:14] identifying that John the Baptist was
[45:17] Christ's peaceful forerunner and I got I
[45:20] got a a man I was asking the question
[45:22] here last week the angel said that he
[45:25] was a mighty prophet for his day
[45:27] now if the angel gives a description of
[45:30] John and calls him a mighty prophet yet
[45:33] when I look in the Bible John never
[45:36] worked one miracle nobody was raised
[45:39] from the dead
[45:40] nobody was healed in his meetings nobody
[45:43] gave testimonies like that but he had a
[45:45] message to call people to repentance
[45:47] amen and then an angel says his man I
[45:50] mean he was a mighty prophet in his day
[45:54] the angel cornet and when you go back
[45:56] and look at all the other prophets
[45:57] Isaiah and Ayinde your knee and heel and
[46:00] heel I Jenny like shut you know Moses
[46:03] all these are the prophets how could the
[46:05] angel describe John the Baptist amen as
[46:08] a mighty prophet in his day
[46:10] well the reason that the angel called
[46:12] him that is because John's ministry and
[46:15] John's amen
[46:17] is it what his responsibility was is to
[46:20] introduce the Messiah
[46:22] Amen what greater ministry could you
[46:25] have than to introduce the Messiah and
[46:27] my other question is his first coming he
[46:31] has somebody to introduce his first
[46:34] coming
[46:35] should he also have another forerunner
[46:37] to introduce his second coming Amen
[46:40] we're not living in the days of the
[46:42] first coming so we can look back in
[46:44] scripture see well John a man fit this
[46:47] in John the indented and jogged in this
[46:49] for me
[46:50] we can see all that but we got to see
[46:52] how does it apply now because we're
[46:54] ready for his second coming
[46:56] blessed be the name of shirts don't let
[46:59] nobody take these scriptures from you
[47:08] [Music]
[47:11] [Applause]
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:54] [Music]
[47:57] [Applause]
[48:27] we're not here by accident we're here
[48:30] because God promised that before the
[48:33] great and terrible day of the Lord we
[48:35] would be here
[48:36] he said somebody's heart was going to be
[48:37] turned he didn't put my name there but
[48:40] he put my condition there my heart
[48:43] needed to return Oh hallelujah man you
[48:46] just begin to think about how you got
[48:47] here some of the folk that brought you
[48:49] here where they act hey man hey man
[48:53] think about it glory to God but but you
[48:55] know you start losing now thank God for
[48:57] you being a conduit to bring me here
[49:00] Amen but I ain't going back now that now
[49:03] that I see what I see I'm not
[49:06] hallelujah all right now hallelujah
[49:10] glory glory glory glory glory all right
[49:14] so you know we were saying here if you
[49:18] were going to be a forerunner a man of
[49:20] the person said to take observation or
[49:23] act as a spy
[49:24] a scout a light armed soldier one who
[49:27] come in advance to a place where the
[49:30] rest are to follow there's so much there
[49:32] even a brother Brandon's ministry we see
[49:34] his ministry as Amen what we would call
[49:38] first fruit and the harvest amen
[49:41] he was a wave sheaf his ministry was
[49:43] wave sheaf ministry a man even in the
[49:46] manifestation of God in his life that he
[49:49] proven that Jesus Christ was the same
[49:52] yesterday today forever
[49:54] that was wave sheaf type ministry amen
[49:57] because now when we face a problem our
[49:59] God is not we seen he lived a man
[50:02] in brother Brandon's ministries which
[50:03] shows that he still lives today Amen so
[50:06] if we run into some situation we need
[50:08] healing from a sickness if we apply the
[50:10] same promises and we watch God manifests
[50:13] himself
[50:14] hallelujah wave sheaf a many he was a
[50:17] forerunner went before showing us where
[50:19] we were coming light-armed sure the one
[50:22] who comes in events a place where the
[50:24] risks are to follow all the way up to
[50:27] going over there going into across the
[50:30] the bed of time Amen and going to heaven
[50:33] describing what it was like that's why I
[50:36] say anybody on YouTube that come up with
[50:39] a video Tom but I went to heaven amen
[50:41] I'm that's not following everybody that
[50:43] was ever a man if it don't line up with
[50:46] what the Prophet said amen I'm not
[50:49] following I put no confidence in it I
[50:51] don't care how good it sound appropriate
[50:53] already scouted the land he told us what
[50:57] it was like
[51:00] hallelujah
[51:02] hey man chirps glory to God so you know
[51:05] I'm gonna go on a prophetic
[51:07] understanding of these things so now
[51:09] let's look a men another definition set
[51:12] of forerunners one who comes in advance
[51:14] to the place where the rest will follow
[51:16] not use ie miles and and cushy on and on
[51:20] last weekend the the rest of the
[51:22] soldiers were get ready to come back in
[51:24] and report to David what had happened
[51:27] a man there in the battle and and here
[51:29] ah Hamas want to take off running but he
[51:32] he didn't see anything he had no message
[51:34] he had nothing that he could share but
[51:36] yet he wanted to run anyway my but but
[51:39] who she had something that he saw
[51:41] enjoyed saying tell the King what you
[51:43] saw and when he got there even though he
[51:45] was the last one to get there he was the
[51:47] one that had something to say hallelujah
[51:50] kind of reminds me you know we would you
[51:53] know if you come from the type of church
[51:55] that I come from with a what a preacher
[51:57] oh Jesus I feel good yeah I mean he'd
[52:08] get the girl you know his sermons about
[52:10] to close I'm not too close John God told
[52:15] me and then uh the organ player get the
[52:18] corn in the piano man and everybody get
[52:20] on they feel you to start worshiping
[52:22] they have to wait for the preacher to
[52:24] settle up hallelujah glory to God so so
[52:27] so I come from an environment like that
[52:30] if I could just be honest so when I
[52:32] started listening to the Prophet it was
[52:34] a little hard for me because he never
[52:37] wound it up preach the gospel Jesus
[52:46] probably never went around holding this
[52:47] here
[52:51] because it's not coming for you you know
[53:20] hard to hear some of the things because
[53:23] he was so accustomed to listen to other
[53:28] things that I was missing the truth I
[53:31] was looking for the show missing the
[53:33] truth a man gotta put on a show for
[53:36] nobody a Mary just brings you truth so
[53:39] when you listen to the Prophet you like
[53:41] you ain't on getting no humming a man
[53:43] you don't get no singing you're just
[53:46] gonna get straight to glory to God
[53:49] that's what we want
[53:51] amen so here the statement was made and
[53:55] we see John the Baptist fulfilling
[53:57] Isaiah 40 and 3 says the force of him
[54:01] that crops in the will disrepair either
[54:02] way in the Lord make straight in the
[54:04] desert a highway for our God we see John
[54:07] the Baptist fulfilling Malachi 3 and
[54:10] verse 1 the whole I was seeing my
[54:13] messenger that's a forerunner I will
[54:15] send my messenger and he shall prepare
[54:17] the way before me and the Lord whom you
[54:20] seek shall suddenly come to his temple
[54:23] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[54:25] you delight in behold he shall come
[54:27] saith the Lord of hosts now you know I
[54:31] finished last week's sermon with this
[54:34] quote out of influence a man because the
[54:37] scripture tells us plainly that John the
[54:40] Baptist was the forerunner we got that
[54:42] there was there's no doubt about it
[54:44] Jesus himself identify
[54:46] that and we'll hit that a little bit
[54:48] later but but here I just wanna I want
[54:51] to say I'm not this week I'm not talking
[54:52] about John the Baptist I mean that was
[54:55] for his first coming this week I'm
[54:57] talking about William Mary and Brandon
[54:58] because that is for his second coming
[55:00] glory to God even if you can say Amen
[55:03] the John the Baptist then you got to say
[55:05] man to who God is sending a man in this
[55:08] day for the second coming of the Lord
[55:09] and I asked the question over and over
[55:12] again if William area Branham is not the
[55:14] one that fulfill these scriptures please
[55:16] show me who the one you don't wanna do
[55:19] you want to know why I asked that
[55:20] question because in the world I see that
[55:23] somebody was sent to me you understand
[55:27] this was a problem at home I said you
[55:30] know I've said this before and I'm gonna
[55:33] say it again you know God was being nice
[55:36] I was being inclusive when he said
[55:40] behold I send you because my
[55:43] interpretation of that verse is behold I
[55:47] sin
[55:49] he made me Elijah the Prophet before the
[55:52] coming of the great and terrible day
[55:54] Lord
[55:54] I believe God was talking to me
[55:56] personally
[55:57] hallelujah so so so what I'm asking is
[56:00] that you know I mean since it's a
[56:02] personal scripture to me you have to
[56:04] tell me who the messenger was if we're
[56:06] your man Branham was not the messenger
[56:08] hallelujah glory to God alright and that
[56:10] shouldn't just be my feeling that should
[56:12] be everybody's feeling behold I see you
[56:15] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gone I'm I'm
[56:21] trying to save something but I'm a humma
[56:23] I'm a glory to God glory to God glory to
[56:28] God let me see what I got here let me
[56:30] just see what I got here because I I
[56:33] might just need to change my my course
[56:36] yeah I'm gonna change it imma change my
[56:40] course praise the Lord I say you got to
[56:43] make that thing personal alright now we
[56:46] talk about a message and you know we
[56:52] just used a term so lightly a message
[56:54] the message the message the message and
[56:56] the senses you so lightly the quest
[56:59] and comes up at times from people that
[57:04] ain't gonna call them eight believers
[57:07] I'm gonna call them unbelievers i'ma
[57:10] call them confused and just need a man
[57:13] our supernatural fingers to unravel the
[57:17] knocks in their mind
[57:19] Amen so when they get a little knot in
[57:21] their mind they were asked you to
[57:23] question what is the message if I would
[57:27] suggest actually to raise your hand I
[57:29] can't see you online but if I just
[57:30] actually raise your hand I mean how many
[57:32] have been asked the question what is the
[57:35] message anybody been asked that question
[57:36] what is the message alright okay okay
[57:39] all right I'm glad she was honest amen
[57:41] so I'm gonna give you some answers to
[57:45] that particular question all today right
[57:47] amen and and what I did
[57:50] cuz this is if they want to know what is
[57:53] the message they can actually take the
[57:55] same program that you got on your
[57:57] telephone and they can actually put a
[58:00] little search criterion and say the
[58:03] message is this put that search criteria
[58:06] and then if you put the subscribe to you
[58:08] able to it would give you some things
[58:10] some quotes back to show you what the
[58:12] message is what did the prophets say
[58:15] that the message was now when I put in
[58:17] that search criteria I got 124 hits now
[58:24] you know what I can't read are 124
[58:26] quotes to you I mean this service would
[58:29] never eat so what I decided to do is
[58:32] just get 20 is that all right I broke it
[58:35] down from 120 fold to 20 can you handle
[58:38] that
[58:40] alright so anybody answer the question
[58:43] what the message is you gonna have a
[58:45] take that you can point them to say my
[58:48] pastor preach Christ amen faithful
[58:50] forerunner part two and he answered that
[58:52] question just for you
[58:54] hallelujah
[58:56] my pastor he didn't have enough time to
[59:00] actually get all 124 quotes but if you
[59:03] want to here is the table put this for
[59:06] your phone and just put it in the search
[59:08] the message is just put that it and read
[59:12] 124 and if you don't get an answer after
[59:15] that I'm not sure if the message was for
[59:20] you so I got my own answers I'm gonna
[59:26] give you my answers I got seven and then
[59:29] I'm gonna give you twenty from the
[59:30] Prophet a man so my answers the message
[59:32] is a message of change and then the
[59:37] message is a message of redemption Amen
[59:41] the message is a message of God's love
[59:44] man the message is a message of
[59:47] salvation glory the message generates
[59:51] worship Amen the message is a message
[1:00:11] the message that's just my definition
[1:00:16] let me give you the prophets definition
[1:00:17] he says the message is of Jesus Christ
[1:00:21] and his glory
[1:00:22] you want to know what the message is the
[1:00:24] message is of Jesus Christ and his glory
[1:00:28] another thing he says about the message
[1:00:30] says the message is not altogether right
[1:00:35] on the letter they say the message is
[1:00:43] not altogether right on the letter but
[1:00:48] it's between the lines if you want to
[1:00:52] know what the message is you have
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:57] because the message when between the
[1:01:00] message together write on the letter but
[1:01:26] it's between the lines
[1:01:28] the third thing the message is predicted
[1:01:32] to come for just exactly the way it is
[1:01:36] and before judgment strikes that's
[1:01:38] malachi for this message glory to god
[1:01:50] somebody another thing he says the
[1:01:52] message is so the message urgent we
[1:01:58] can't play games with we're gonna have
[1:02:00] to let people know what the truth is
[1:02:03] amen we happy to have people join us
[1:02:05] alive but the message is urgent
[1:02:08] hallelujah amen when when Locke was down
[1:02:12] there Amen in Sodom oh Jesus
[1:02:16] well I was in Sodom amen and the
[1:02:20] conditions were bad it was so bad that
[1:02:22] God was was coming to destroy brought
[1:02:26] himself into angels created bodies for
[1:02:29] himself and two angels they went down to
[1:02:31] visit Abraham and then they begin to
[1:02:34] reveal to Abraham what was getting ready
[1:02:36] to happen
[1:02:37] Abraham begin to enter soon you know
[1:03:07] just to be coming they were scouting out
[1:03:10] the land to see if what they heard was a
[1:03:12] bit about the wickedness and how evil it
[1:03:15] was talented in Sodom if it was time to
[1:03:17] destroy that place hallelujah when they
[1:03:20] saw the wickedness and here these men so
[1:03:23] fulfilling Minds a man that they want to
[1:03:28] get with lots lots visit us where the
[1:03:31] men that came in the sea we wanted we
[1:03:33] want them to come out we want to get to
[1:03:35] know them how wicked these men were
[1:03:37] right and we're not in those days again
[1:03:40] cuz Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:03:44] life so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:03:45] Son of Man so when Jesus comes again
[1:03:48] we're supposed to see wickedness like
[1:03:50] that in the land I ain't gonna even
[1:03:52] talking about politics but we know where
[1:03:55] certain political parties get into
[1:03:57] office more that it's promoted
[1:04:01] hallelujah it's the truth in it huh hey
[1:04:04] man it's all just a manifestation of
[1:04:08] Scripture I don't I don't have a problem
[1:04:09] I don't matter me what party you belong
[1:04:11] to the best part you can belong to it's
[1:04:13] the Christian party a man be a Christian

[1:07:07] organization but to God's children a
[1:07:10] brother asked me a question say how come
[1:07:13] they don't notice on TV and they don't
[1:07:15] want this on TBN and the message is to

[1:07:22] before swine they will trample on it can
[1:07:26] I go a little further tell you what the
[1:07:28] Prophet said now I'm only at number 9
[1:07:29] can I go further number 10 the message
[1:07:32] is revived again in the last days the
[1:07:36] message of who he is what he is
[1:07:39] Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same
[1:07:42] works that he did Marisa manifests
[1:07:44] himself through you the very same thing
[1:07:47] he did is the evening light it's English
[1:07:49] spoken of it's a hard way the message is
[1:07:53] heart oh that's one statement but here's
[1:07:56] another one
[1:07:57] the message is wonderful hallelujah Amen
[1:08:02] I got another one here amen the message
[1:08:04] is right that's why the prophecy I'm
[1:08:08] reading you cultural prophet amen
[1:08:10] the message is to you behold I said the
[1:08:15] message is to you
[1:08:17] glory to God the message he goes on the
[1:08:21] cities and now now we're looking at
[1:08:23] revelation 3 from this statement amen
[1:08:26] revelation one two and three
[1:08:27] we're looking at this he makes the stem
[1:08:29] say the message is address to the leader
[1:08:32] of the church that's a church age right
[1:08:35] the leader of the church god help that
[1:08:38] guy that'll pull away from that message
[1:08:42] amen but it was given to an angel and
[1:08:45] the angel was in his hand under his own
[1:08:49] control giving it thriving power from
[1:08:52] him from Christ right from his right
[1:08:54] hand there in his right hand that is
[1:08:58] there in supreme power wild
[1:09:00] here on the earth because they are the
[1:09:03] lights from him given the light to that
[1:09:05] church AC unto the Angel of the church
[1:09:08] addressed to the star of the age that is
[1:09:11] responsible the age of the church is
[1:09:14] responsible if he doesn't preach the
[1:09:17] word that's right and that angel will
[1:09:19] have to answer in the judgement so the
[1:09:23] message was given to the leader of the
[1:09:25] church you want to know what the message
[1:09:26] is that's what we're following what God
[1:09:28] gave the messenger for this age that's
[1:09:31] all this is God God said that in
[1:09:33] Revelation 1 2 and 3 these are not
[1:09:35] things that are outside the scripture
[1:09:37] here's another now you're gonna be
[1:09:39] you're gonna be kind of shocked at this
[1:09:41] one the message is over message is over
[1:09:49] and now we know that because revelation
[1:09:51] 10 told us but in the days of the voice
[1:09:54] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:09:55] to sound has been already so people get
[1:10:28] upset came to a prophet because the
[1:10:38] message is over alright now watch this
[1:10:41] well sis now I said the message is over
[1:10:45] if you ain't got spiritual understanding
[1:10:46] you're gonna miss everything I'm saying
[1:10:48] the message is over finished alright oh
[1:10:50] and then the number 16 the messages have
[1:10:52] been being poured into the church the
[1:10:56] message is over but it's also be
[1:10:59] important to the church because we keep
[1:11:00] preaching the same thing over and over
[1:11:01] again God ain't sending another message
[1:11:04] so when we say the message is over God
[1:11:06] has already called his messenger his
[1:11:08] forerunner has already come did his job
[1:11:10] and now he's gone praise the Lord
[1:11:14] so
[1:11:14] I'm not looking for no eighth messenger
[1:11:16] to rise up nobody so you know the Lord
[1:11:18] said this was no no no if it ain't with
[1:11:20] what the prophet already said you can
[1:11:22] forget about it you you I can just
[1:11:25] already tell you yeah
[1:11:26] the only I told you a few weeks ago if
[1:11:28] you want to get an amen for me always
[1:11:31] give me what the Bible say and give me
[1:11:33] what the prophecy you're gonna get an
[1:11:35] amen for me but you start moving a
[1:11:37] little bit away from that it's gonna be
[1:11:39] Tiffany it's gonna be tough hallelujah
[1:11:42] we already have some vindicated oh my
[1:11:45] all we got to just follow that so the
[1:11:47] message is still being poured in to the
[1:11:49] church glory to God the message is still
[1:11:53] ringing through the halls
[1:11:55] can I get a gig give him two more I mean
[1:11:58] three more the message is on tape if you
[1:12:01] want to know what the message is
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:13] cuz the message is on tape here's one
[1:12:20] other the message is according to the
[1:12:23] Word of God and it's scientifically
[1:12:25] proven the message I'm telling the
[1:12:30] message is typically hanging in
[1:12:36] Washington DC now Olivia maybe maybe
[1:12:40] your messenger that you following got
[1:12:42] some in Washington DC
[1:12:44] praise the Lord tell us about it glory
[1:12:48] to God alright so the message is
[1:12:51] according to the Word of God and
[1:12:53] scientifically proven now here's the
[1:12:57] last one that I wrote I tell you I've
[1:12:59] just got there's 124 I just pulled 20
[1:13:01] here's here's the 20th one the mat
[1:13:05] that's the way the message is you can't
[1:13:08] sympathize with it and say it's right
[1:13:11] but you got to take it to yourself and
[1:13:13] become part of it then you and the
[1:13:17] message become one then the anointest
[1:13:20] with you as it is with the others

[1:14:23] thing like that
[1:14:23] look I've been I've been holding to this
[1:14:25] word for a long time I don't see many
[1:14:27] come and many go but to know what I'm
[1:14:30] still standing in the same place I was
[1:14:32] standing before they left praise Allah
[1:14:35] I'm standing with this word hallelujah
[1:14:37] Church amen I become one with my message

[1:14:45] man some some call your brand of mics
[1:14:48] and all that you just got the wrong
[1:14:50] interpretation yes I do follow what
[1:14:51] brother Brandon talked Amen but I and I
[1:14:54] do believe the message but this message
[1:14:56] is Christ revealed in this day alright
[1:14:59] let's go a little further hallelujah
[1:15:02] hallelujah let's go back to a man this
[1:15:04] this just quote out of pergamene church
[1:15:06] eh now I'm going back and bringing a
[1:15:11] couple sermons all together just through
[1:15:13] these quotes this is out a paragraph 172
[1:15:15] 4 is what we'll start and and with with
[1:15:19] with understanding what the message is
[1:15:20] now you know you realized that even in
[1:15:25] the children of Israel's days they were
[1:15:27] going into the promise then they had a
[1:15:28] message that they were following a man
[1:15:31] to come out of Egypt they had to follow
[1:15:32] a message right so as they were going
[1:15:35] into the Promised Land there were
[1:15:36] certain scriptures that were a men
[1:15:38] predicted for them to go they were
[1:15:40] holding to that
[1:15:41] message what was said to Abraham now
[1:15:45] this is this is uh what the Prophet was
[1:15:47] told to write he says now let us stand
[1:15:50] like Joshua and Caleb our promised land
[1:15:55] is coming in sight even as theirs did
[1:16:01] now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he
[1:16:06] represents the end time leader that will
[1:16:09] come to the church even as Paul came as
[1:16:12] the original leader this is what the
[1:16:15] angel saying Caleb represents those that
[1:16:19] stay true with Joshua my God my God my
[1:16:24] God
[1:16:25] Caleb represents those that stay true
[1:16:28] with Joshua remember God had started
[1:16:32] Israel as a virgin with his word now you
[1:16:35] know if when you read your Bible when
[1:16:38] Joshua was called home there were still
[1:16:41] some others Amen that were left on the
[1:16:44] scene that was still holding to a Joshua
[1:16:46] and Caleb was was was was standing with
[1:16:48] right there was some others that what I
[1:16:52] would like to call elders in the camp
[1:16:54] and you know the children of Israel
[1:16:57] hallelujah
[1:16:58] they stay faithful as long as those
[1:17:02] elders were there as soon as the elders
[1:17:05] were taken off the scene they begin to
[1:17:08] grow in chaos and if we're not seeing
[1:17:10] the repeat of that that pain soon as the
[1:17:15] eldest left to see soon as they stop
[1:17:17] being able to hear us
[1:17:18] eyewitness testimonies they begin to
[1:17:22] succumb to the things of the world not
[1:17:25] me I'm not trying to hold hold on to
[1:17:26] this with everything I got how do I know
[1:17:29] you somebody listen it says Caleb
[1:17:32] represents those that stay true with
[1:17:33] Joshua remember God I started Israel as
[1:17:36] a virgin with this word but they wanted
[1:17:38] something different so did the last date
[1:17:42] church amen
[1:17:43] no that's how God did not move Israel or
[1:17:46] let her going to the promised land until
[1:17:48] it was its own appointed time
[1:17:50] the people might have put pressure on
[1:17:51] Joshua the leader says the land is ours
[1:17:54] let's go and take it just one you are
[1:17:56] all through you must have lost your
[1:17:59] commission you don't have the power you
[1:18:02] used to have you used to hear from God
[1:18:05] and know the will of God and act quickly
[1:18:06] something is wrong with you
[1:18:08] Amen I says but Joshua was a god-sent
[1:18:12] prophet and he knew the promises of God
[1:18:14] so he waited for them just take that
[1:18:18] down just for a second this testimony
[1:18:19] just kind of comes back to my spirit and
[1:18:21] I'll just share it we got an eyewitness
[1:18:24] a man that was living during the time of
[1:18:28] brother Branham experience
[1:18:30] the supernatural and it just so happened
[1:18:34] that during this time of even a pandemic
[1:18:36] I don't know how it happened but but
[1:18:38] they felt led to start releasing a whole
[1:18:41] bunch of videos from brother at Bisco
[1:18:42] and on YouTube they just got a whole
[1:18:45] bunch of our witness accounts he kind of
[1:18:47] refreshed the videos and and and made it
[1:18:50] more modern things like that same story
[1:18:52] same testimonies but it just made it
[1:18:53] more modern and you know as I've been
[1:18:55] just sitting listening to the videos my
[1:18:57] faith has just been reignited and I
[1:19:00] brother you know brother Brandon when we
[1:19:01] when we when we were listening to the
[1:19:03] message he's telling his own personal
[1:19:05] testimony different supernatural events
[1:19:07] that happened one of those supernatural
[1:19:08] events to happen was a God showed him he
[1:19:11] said I don't know whether it was a dream
[1:19:12] of whether was a vision he says when I
[1:19:14] go hunting I'm gonna get this animal
[1:19:15] I've never seen Adam before animal
[1:19:18] before but I saw hands in the vision and
[1:19:20] they measured the horns that animals 42
[1:19:22] inches I don't know what it is but I
[1:19:24] normally get that because God showed it
[1:19:25] to me he says no on top of that God said
[1:19:28] imma get a Silvertip grizzly bear in the
[1:19:30] same hunt so brother Brandon was sharing
[1:19:33] all this and brother had been so
[1:19:35] happened to be the brother you know in
[1:19:37] that was supposed to be taking brother
[1:19:39] branham hunting and and brother branham
[1:19:41] shared all these things with brother and
[1:19:42] he said now they're supposed to be a
[1:19:43] young man he said about 18 years old to
[1:19:47] go with us and it's gonna be his hands
[1:19:48] and division he said now they're
[1:19:51] smothering a man with a green checkered
[1:19:53] shirt my brother Eddie as soon as he
[1:19:54] said green checkered shirt for the Eddie
[1:19:56] said now I know I got a green checkered
[1:19:58] shirt it says but because my
[1:20:00] it had been getting torn so much my wife
[1:20:03] had passed it up too many times I told
[1:20:05] my wife throw this shirt away
[1:20:06] give me another shirt well his wife a
[1:20:09] man was was trying to get to the store
[1:20:12] to get him another shirt couldn't make
[1:20:13] it to the store so she sewed it up again
[1:20:15] put it back in his bag and she said you
[1:20:18] don't even realize why you'd be doing
[1:20:20] certain things even she had to sew it up
[1:20:23] because that green shirt
[1:20:25] could not be in the garbage the green
[1:20:27] shirt was a part of the fishing it was
[1:20:32] part of the vision amen so she had to
[1:20:35] put that shirt back inside that luggage
[1:20:37] and when brother Eddie winter where he
[1:20:40] got him to he fell into some water when
[1:20:43] he went to change his clothes he saw the
[1:20:44] shirt he was upset that the shirt was
[1:20:46] there didn't even realize that he was a
[1:20:50] part of the vision well they had to
[1:20:53] begin to share so you know sometimes he
[1:20:55] said to be happening you just don't even
[1:20:56] know it just it's it's just unreal so he
[1:21:00] said but brother branham was so sure
[1:21:01] that he was going to get this this
[1:21:02] animal and it was it was in a certain
[1:21:05] area say he said this is the area I
[1:21:06] believe it is and he just they couldn't
[1:21:08] find arms he say all of sudden looked up
[1:21:10] he said what's that over there
[1:21:11] say they went over and guide the animals
[1:21:13] come back he said now before I get down
[1:21:14] to that camp there's supposed to be a
[1:21:15] grizzly bear

[1:21:21] I'm sorry brother I don't mean to doubt
[1:21:23] you

[1:21:25] say it when God gives a vision it's
[1:21:28] gonna be exactly the way he said ain't
[1:21:30] nothin gonna stop it I got encouraged
[1:21:33] when I heard that because I know that
[1:21:34] angel has wrote a vision for the people
[1:21:37] in this day and I'm telling you right
[1:21:39] now ain't nothing gonna stop the vision
[1:21:43] you're singing gonna stop it your doubt
[1:21:46] ain't gonna stop it your unbelief angle

[1:21:53] God had a prophet pick up
[1:21:56] spin and write somebody goes step into
[1:22:00] this kitchen brother Eddie say you know

[1:22:12] being there he said not what happened
[1:22:14] he says we'd stop before we got back
[1:22:18] down to the camp and brother Branham
[1:22:20] kept looking around after where this

[1:23:13] said I've been look man I've been
[1:23:15] hunting with people for all my life
[1:23:17] ain't no way you can do it he said if
[1:23:20] you give me permission i'ma shoot to
[1:23:22] shoot this grizzly brother branham
[1:23:23] pulled his gun out shot the grizzly and
[1:23:26] brother buzz story is when the buzz when
[1:23:29] the grizzly got shot the grizzly came
[1:23:30] down the mountain after brother branham
[1:23:33] and brother bud but he got so far maybe
[1:23:36] to the back of the church he was coming
[1:23:38] and when he got to maybe to the back of
[1:23:40] church he just dropped dead right there
[1:23:43] see when God give a vision it's gonna be
[1:23:46] exactly the way said brother branham set
[1:23:48] there knowing that when nothing gonna
[1:23:50] happen to him because God had given him
[1:23:52] the vision that was his trophy
[1:23:55] hallelujah
[1:23:56] see that's why when I look at these
[1:23:57] these quotes here I'm preaching vision
[1:24:00] to the church and I and I'm just
[1:24:02] preaching what God has already called us
[1:24:04] to I'm just I'm all I'm doing this
[1:24:06] echoing what he said and this
[1:24:08] what we're gonna walk in I don't I'm not
[1:24:11] looking at this I'm not looking at that
[1:24:12] I'm looking at what God said in his word
[1:24:15] hallelujah the vision don't lie
[1:24:19] everything that he told those brothers
[1:24:22] came to pass with that we're getting
[1:24:25] that bad I mean getting to get in the
[1:24:26] Silvertip grizzly and getting the
[1:24:28] 42-inch caribou everything brother
[1:24:30] brother but son was supposed to go on
[1:24:33] the hunt and brother brother Eddie knew
[1:24:35] that this man was supposed to go in the
[1:24:36] hunt he was supposed to be somewhere
[1:24:37] else and it went down there to pick up
[1:24:39] brother blood and here comes the Sun
[1:24:40] walking out the house and brother
[1:24:42] brother Eddie said I thought you're
[1:24:43] supposed to be working so yeah they let
[1:24:44] me out for a couple days so I can come
[1:24:46] join the hunt
[1:24:46] and I brother brother Eddie just it just
[1:24:48] problems say how old are you young man
[1:24:51] how old are you you say wow I just need
[1:24:53] to know how old are you 18 that's
[1:24:57] exactly what the Prophet said a young
[1:24:58] man about 18 years old his hands would
[1:25:02] be there measuring the animal mmm god is
[1:25:07] good we not we're not we're not
[1:25:09] following a man a man to be following a
[1:25:12] man we following a man as he follows
[1:25:15] Christ can I feed can I keep reading
[1:25:17] this quote here I want to keep reading
[1:25:18] just a couple of things I want to share
[1:25:20] it says but Joshua was a godsend
[1:25:25] property and he knew the promise of God
[1:25:27] so he waited for them he waited for a
[1:25:29] clear-cut decision from God and when the
[1:25:31] time come to move God placed a full
[1:25:33] leadership in Johnson and now I was I
[1:25:36] was saying all that to say this brother
[1:25:38] brother Eddie Bisco said the vision took
[1:25:40] six hours to actually complete so you
[1:25:43] got to learn to be patient when you're
[1:25:46] dealing with a vision so as a pastime
[1:25:49] preaches but I got to be patient and
[1:25:51] wait for the people to come in line with
[1:25:53] what they what they hear so yeah you
[1:25:55] might be living here but I'm not gonna
[1:25:58] preach here i'ma preach here because
[1:26:01] that's gonna make you come up here glory
[1:26:03] to God hallelujah amen amen
[1:26:07] God see what you're doing God see it
[1:26:10] everybody else see it amen
[1:26:13] but we sit on preached here because
[1:26:15] you're a part of a vision all right
[1:26:17] listen
[1:26:17] he waited for a clear-cut decision from
[1:26:19] God and when the time come to move
[1:26:21] place the full leadership of Josh in
[1:26:22] Joshua's hands because he stayed with
[1:26:25] the word God could trust Joshua but not
[1:26:27] the others so will it repeat in this in
[1:26:29] this day same problem same precious
[1:26:31] people can't stay with the word they get
[1:26:33] ahead of the word get too excited and
[1:26:35] actually get ahead of the work we're
[1:26:36] gonna stay with the word let the word do
[1:26:38] the leading let the word do the leading
[1:26:41] amen no I'm gonna say that again we're
[1:26:45] gonna let the Word of God do the leading
[1:26:47] that means gifts will not do the leading
[1:26:50] the Word of God will do the leading amen
[1:26:54] all right Moses gift got him in trouble
[1:26:57] y'all ain't heard it Moses stop
[1:27:00] following the word and start following
[1:27:02] his gift the word said speak to the rock
[1:27:06] but the gift said hit the rock do you
[1:27:11] know what the gift got what it wanted
[1:27:17] but a miss miss what God had intended
[1:27:22] for it and he could even go to the
[1:27:24] promised land because he disobeyed the
[1:27:27] word all right now I'm reading the
[1:27:31] vision this is what the vision says
[1:27:33] right so look at this now same problem
[1:27:37] same pressures he says think is that
[1:27:42] what we see in Moses this mighty
[1:27:44] anointed prophet of God had a peculiar
[1:27:46] birth well really got being born at the
[1:27:48] right time for the deliverance of
[1:27:50] Abraham's seed from Egypt he never
[1:27:52] stayed in Egypt to argue Scripture with
[1:27:54] with them nor fussed at the priest he
[1:27:56] went to the witness until the people
[1:27:58] were ready to receive him God called
[1:28:00] Moses to the wilderness the waiting was
[1:28:04] not on Moses part but the part but
[1:28:07] because of the people who were not ready
[1:28:09] to receive him Moses thought the people
[1:28:12] would understand but they did not
[1:28:15] hallelujah glory to God let's go on now
[1:28:18] it's very easy for us to try to take
[1:28:21] these quotes and apply them to ourself
[1:28:22] but keep them keep them in context now
[1:28:24] he's talking about his ministry we talk
[1:28:25] about Christ's faithful forerunner and
[1:28:27] from what I know none of us have been
[1:28:29] called to be the forerunner can I say
[1:28:32] that again from what I know none of
[1:28:35] had been called to be the forerunner the
[1:28:37] forerunner has come and gone all right
[1:28:40] praise the Lord I told you we're not
[1:28:43] looking for our minds I'm gonna take off
[1:28:45] running
[1:28:45] you ain't got no message bro since you
[1:28:48] ain't got no message don't take off
[1:28:50] running nine and Joab total you ain't
[1:28:52] got nothing to say
[1:28:53] let me run anyway you ain't got nothing
[1:28:56] to say and when he got that to the king
[1:28:58] he just praise the Lord King live
[1:29:01] forever yeah you try to you know stroke
[1:29:05] his ego and it is thank you thank you
[1:29:08] for that
[1:29:08] my son Absalom anything you got any news
[1:29:12] about him I saw a pile of rocks but I
[1:29:15] didn't know what was behind the rocks
[1:29:16] stand in the kkona stand to the side we
[1:29:19] don't even need to hear any more you got
[1:29:21] to say we'll wait for cushy cushy could

[1:29:25] praise the Lord hey man we already had
[1:29:28] it we already got a cushy will your
[1:29:31] Marion Brandon he's already tell us what
[1:29:34] happens we got that we don't need
[1:29:36] nothing else glory all right now let's
[1:29:38] go on I'm going on it says then there is
[1:29:42] Elisha whom the word of the Lord came
[1:29:45] when he got through preaching the truth
[1:29:48] and that group back there that this that
[1:29:50] is the forerunner of American Jezebel
[1:29:52] group would not receive the word God
[1:29:55] called them off the field and plague
[1:29:57] that generation for rejecting the
[1:29:58] prophet and the messenger that God had
[1:30:00] given God called him to the wilderness
[1:30:02] and he would not come out even for the
[1:30:05] king those who tried to persuade him to
[1:30:07] do so died but God spoke to his faithful
[1:30:09] prophet by vision out of hiding he came
[1:30:12] and brought back brought back the word
[1:30:15] to Israel then came John the Baptist's
[1:30:19] Christ faithful forerunner the mighty
[1:30:22] prophet for his day he did not go to his
[1:30:27] father's school nor the school of the
[1:30:29] Pharisees he went to no denomination but
[1:30:31] out to the wilderness a man called there
[1:30:34] by God there he stayed until the Lord
[1:30:36] sent him out with the message crying the
[1:30:39] message is at hand
[1:30:40] now I just got
[1:30:41] a couple of statements that I want to
[1:30:43] make here I read a quote I don't know if
[1:30:45] I don't remember read this again but
[1:30:48] brother Branham just made the statement
[1:30:49] there was never a man born of woman like
[1:30:51] John like him or could compare with him
[1:30:54] until that time a man until that time
[1:30:57] now we got somebody can compare to John
[1:31:00] because his ministry is also called amen
[1:31:03] to introduce Christ at the second coming
[1:31:05] Amen now look at this I wrote this when
[1:31:08] the angel said take the example we see
[1:31:11] in Moses he was called to the wilderness
[1:31:14] and had to wait for the people that
[1:31:15] catch up with the vision amen
[1:31:18] the people did not understand that God
[1:31:21] was trying to fulfill his word of
[1:31:23] promise through the life of Moses do you
[1:31:25] know the same thing that's happened
[1:31:27] today Amen God has got to still wait for
[1:31:29] people to catch up with the vision of
[1:31:31] what he has already done through the
[1:31:33] Ministry of we American Brenham amen
[1:31:35] also says Elijah came on the scene with
[1:31:38] mighty supernatural vindications he
[1:31:41] called down fire he called for ring he
[1:31:45] outran a horse-drawn chariot and was
[1:31:48] commissioned to turn the hearts of the
[1:31:49] people back to God yet with all that
[1:31:52] supernatural the people still rejected
[1:31:54] this ministry and were plagued hey man
[1:31:57] brother Branham wrote was wrote the
[1:32:00] angel told him write about John the maps
[1:32:01] says Dave came John the Baptist Christ
[1:32:04] faithful full runner the mighty prophet
[1:32:07] for his day the angel described in his
[1:32:09] mighty even though he had a ministry
[1:32:11] that only lasted six months he never
[1:32:14] performed the miracle he only preached
[1:32:16] repent of parish and was considered the
[1:32:18] greatest prophet of all prophets he was
[1:32:21] Dean mighty according to the scripture
[1:32:24] and the reason he was given that title
[1:32:26] is because he introduced the Messiah
[1:32:29] where did he introduce the Messiah John
[1:32:31] 1:29 look at this John 1:29 he
[1:32:35] introduces the Messiah in this verse he
[1:32:38] says the next day John seeth Jesus
[1:32:42] coming unto Him where did John introduce
[1:32:48] the Messiah in water baptism
[1:33:00] why Joe was baptized Jesus comes to
[1:33:06] charm in the reason Jesus came to John
[1:33:09] is because the sacrifice had to be
[1:33:12] washed before it could be hurt and here
[1:33:16] comes Jesus out to John in the water at
[1:33:19] water baptism and John says a man jumped
[1:33:23] out the Bible say the next day John
[1:33:25] seeth Jesus coming unto him and said
[1:33:27] behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[1:33:30] the sin Jesus Christ faithful he was the
[1:34:09] supernatural Curt somebody in the same
[1:34:14] place that John was in the water
[1:34:16] turn turn introduced Messiah in the
[1:34:20] introduced Messiah and notice where they
[1:34:25] say your message your message you want
[1:34:29] to know the message is the message is an
[1:34:31] introduction to the Messiah
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:43] all right now I want to read a quote for
[1:34:48] you she does not air with a shucks even
[1:34:54] it's his his titles it's there was a
[1:34:57] message even in the title the seed is
[1:35:02] not air with the shucks
[1:35:03] look at this way to say just
[1:35:06] about six months after that I had my
[1:35:10] first baptism down here on the river
[1:35:12] when the light came down right here at
[1:35:16] Spring Street many of you people might
[1:35:19] want to go down and take a look at it at
[1:35:21] Spring Street and water now you know we
[1:35:27] take that down just for a second I just
[1:35:29] gotta I there was a recent video that
[1:35:32] come out where they they they criticize
[1:35:34] people for coming to Jeffersonville and
[1:35:36] just you know looking at prop of the
[1:35:37] prophet's grave and going to so many
[1:35:38] places that he talked about where these
[1:35:40] supernatural experience they like you
[1:35:41] know they they call us a cult for doing
[1:35:43] these things look when you know I've
[1:35:46] gone to England to John Wesley's house
[1:35:53] seen his pulpit seen his prayer room
[1:35:56] John Wesley who was the leader not
[1:36:00] really he just started a Methodist
[1:36:01] Church they started after him right
[1:36:03] but John Wesley now when I go to John
[1:36:05] Wesley's house you call me a cop
[1:36:09] no the supernatural was in his house in
[1:36:12] his prayer room brother Branham said he
[1:36:14] went there and he still felt the
[1:36:15] presence of the angel so when I go to
[1:36:20] follow that minister that God used in
[1:36:22] this hour now not when everybody go to
[1:36:25] Billy Graham's they not considered a
[1:36:28] cult but as when we go to William
[1:36:30] Branham that we consider the coat right
[1:36:32] a man no no something wrong
[1:36:34] the God God used this ministry in a very
[1:36:36] unique way right so you know there's
[1:36:39] been a lot of criticism you know that's
[1:36:41] been been coming up and everything but
[1:36:43] this is so quote was just saying here it
[1:36:47] says many of you people might want to go
[1:36:48] down and take a look at it now when it
[1:36:51] when you can leave it there so she could
[1:36:52] leave it there
[1:36:52] to say this real quick brother Mike a
[1:36:55] man a few years ago went down to this
[1:36:58] same spot a man while he was visiting in
[1:37:01] injection severe went down to Spring
[1:37:03] Street where where brother Brad was
[1:37:04] baptizing these people
[1:37:06] glory to God and brother Mike and and I
[1:37:08] think I can't remember the other young
[1:37:09] brothers name right now military they
[1:37:11] took a picture and the pillar of fire
[1:37:14] showed up on the picture I'll tell the
[1:37:19] people that live right here in West Palm
[1:37:21] Beach Amy they took a picture the pillar
[1:37:23] fire shut up in the in that same area
[1:37:26] where brother Brandon was baptizing
[1:37:27] years later the pillow-fight still
[1:37:29] showed up in there you want to tell me
[1:37:31] this ain't this ain't got hallelujah
[1:37:34] glory to God now I'm not saying it's
[1:37:36] gonna show up when you go I'm just
[1:37:38] saying
[1:37:38] praise the Lord he's still here he still
[1:37:41] vindicated his words glory to God and I
[1:37:44] might as well say like this when we
[1:37:47] share testimonies like that that isn't
[1:37:48] for everybody to believe it's for the
[1:37:50] believer it's just an encouragement to
[1:37:53] the believer everybody else to look at
[1:37:56] you like you're crazy but I believe
[1:37:57] accepts it they believe the believer
[1:37:59] beliefs glory to God let me finish
[1:38:02] reading this Pope now he says how many
[1:38:05] of you people might want to go down and
[1:38:07] take a look at it at Spring Street and
[1:38:10] water right at the riverfront and there
[1:38:13] is where the angel Lord appeared in
[1:38:14] public first and at two o'clock one
[1:38:17] afternoon and a voice came from it and
[1:38:19] said as john the baptist was sent to
[1:38:21] forerun the first coming of christ your
[1:38:24] message will forerun the second coming
[1:38:26] this is 30 years later and Here I am
[1:38:30] still tonight proclaiming that message
[1:38:33] and around the world is whipped and I'm
[1:38:36] glad to be back in my hometown tonight
[1:38:38] to represent this Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:38:41] I still love with all my heart each day
[1:38:43] he stood grow still sweeter than he was
[1:38:46] today before I've never changed one iota
[1:38:48] in my doctrine the first thing I started
[1:38:52] with I still believe the same thing
[1:38:55] tonight he's the same
[1:38:57] yesterday today forever now I have a
[1:38:59] message that I'm responsible for I like
[1:39:05] I like these statements that he makes I
[1:39:07] have a message that I'm responsible for
[1:39:10] a man I want to read another quote here
[1:39:13] out of I heard but now it's but now I
[1:39:15] see I have a message that I'm
[1:39:18] responsible I was just thank you say you
[1:39:20] know even when I was a lad there was a
[1:39:30] calling on my life yeah I'm gonna go a
[1:39:34] little further before I was born
[1:39:39] there was a calling on my life but I
[1:39:42] want to say it like this I'm glad that I
[1:39:46] did not come to the maturity of that
[1:39:48] calling until I actually come underneath
[1:39:52] the influence of the message otherwise
[1:39:58] I'd be standing you in my ear trying to
[1:40:04] work out look no I'm just gonna preach
[1:40:05] the word hallelujah Amen brother branham
[1:40:11] ordained brothers to preach the message
[1:40:13] so you told him say brother we are
[1:40:15] ordaining but we preaching a message
[1:40:17] we're preaching to met God is holding us
[1:40:20] accountable to a message to preach to
[1:40:21] the people we're not just we just not
[1:40:23] sitting preaches out do you want to
[1:40:25] preach the message
[1:40:27] amen he had that and the brother said
[1:40:29] yes that's what I want to do all right
[1:40:31] now will ordain you to preach the
[1:40:33] message you know you know in the in the
[1:40:36] Baptist Church they do ordain you to
[1:40:38] preach Baptist doctrine Oh y'all ain't
[1:40:41] heard
[1:40:42] that's why brother Branham ended up
[1:40:43] leaving the Baptist Church because he
[1:40:45] could support the doctrine it was
[1:40:47] against the word Pentecostals want you
[1:40:50] to preach Pentecostal doctrine
[1:40:53] Methodists want you to preach Methodist
[1:40:55] doctrine and this message we want you to
[1:40:58] preach the message all right any number
[1:41:04] the truth anyhow look if I wanna if I
[1:41:07] wanted that I just
[1:41:15] Amen it's the truth in it huh I want to
[1:41:18] hear the message that's what that's what
[1:41:20] I feed off of glory to God don't give me
[1:41:23] that hey man I've been there and done it
[1:41:25] I don't want no more that hallelujah no
[1:41:29] all it does is just satisfy your flesh
[1:41:31] hey man girl you want and if some I'm a
[1:41:35] preaching against no sin and nothing
[1:41:36] anything going to church your toes never
[1:41:39] get stepped on God loves you and you
[1:41:44] wake up like that sister that was in the
[1:41:46] hospital preacher told her you know it's
[1:41:49] all right he outside smoking cigarettes
[1:41:51] why he tell her it's all right you're
[1:41:52] gonna be all right there and then other
[1:41:54] son she saw she saw demons with chains
[1:41:57] coming to take away and she looked at
[1:41:59] the preacher he they say it's like she's
[1:42:01] going crazy no she was going crazy
[1:42:02] she said you preacher you lied to them
[1:42:05] and you lied to me now I'm lost I'm lost
[1:42:07] you lied to me she was on her way out of
[1:42:10] here going to hell nobody I told her the
[1:42:13] truth

[1:44:35] what it Adam Eve do we came right just

[1:44:42] start in Genesis we end up right if
[1:44:45] everybody go back to it if they'll go
[1:44:47] back but someone don't want to be led by
[1:44:49] the scripture so let me let me finish I
[1:44:51] want to read this I'm coming home this
[1:44:54] is not a message I've heard but now I
[1:44:56] see Oh Lord says now we're promised a
[1:45:04] church age to reformers and we've had
[1:45:07] them but but but he promised in Malachi
[1:45:09] 4 he keep his powder in the last days
[1:45:12] what would take place to turn the hearts
[1:45:15] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:45:18] apostolic father for that very purpose
[1:45:21] and the church is so broke up in
[1:45:24] denominations and isms this is why God
[1:45:27] had to send a forerunner a voice to call
[1:45:30] us out of denominationalism and call us
[1:45:33] back to the word the scripture says that
[1:45:34] our hearts would be turned back to the
[1:45:36] faith of the fathers which means our
[1:45:38] hearts were turned back to what God said
[1:45:40] in his word from Genesis all the way to
[1:45:42] Revelation we would believe a man so it
[1:45:46] says for that very purpose in the
[1:45:47] churches so broke up in denomination and
[1:45:49] isms it is so tore to pieces till it's
[1:45:52] dead it's been a carrier that means you
[1:45:54] were there you had some life but you had
[1:45:56] to come away from that amen and and then
[1:45:59] he promised and the hour of the 7 angels
[1:46:02] message revelation 10 7 and our the
[1:46:04] seventh angels message and let me also
[1:46:06] tell you revelation 10 7 is the
[1:46:08] fulfillment also of revelation 3:14
[1:46:11] alright
[1:46:12] glory to God it's the same angel since
[1:46:15] the ministries of God would be declared
[1:46:17] revelation 10 when the seventh angel
[1:46:20] begins to sound his message now look at
[1:46:23] this not the healing service the message
[1:46:27] that follows the healing service si si
[1:46:32] si si or Roberts had a healing service
[1:46:36] brother Branham had a healing service
[1:46:39] Jack Co had healing services a man there
[1:46:42] was many others during that time they
[1:46:44] all had healing services everybody had
[1:46:47] healing campaigns but the message was
[1:46:49] following the healing campaign it was a
[1:46:52] it was just not the sign of the healing
[1:46:54] services but it was the voice after the
[1:46:57] sign
[1:46:59] hallelujah do you know Jesus had a
[1:47:01] healing campaign Amen but then when he
[1:47:03] forgetting to preach his message unless
[1:47:06] you eat this flesh drink this you have
[1:47:09] no part of me
[1:47:10] when they begin to preach this message
[1:47:11] that's when people reject it and when
[1:47:13] brother Brandon begin to bring truth
[1:47:15] that's when people begin to walk away
[1:47:17] it's the same thing
[1:47:19] repeating itself today hallelujah but
[1:47:22] we're holding on to the message what
[1:47:24] what are these things that that was you
[1:47:26] know I'll just i'ma just say this Jesus
[1:47:28] himself identified John the Baptist
[1:47:32] ministry as the first forerunner amen
[1:47:36] Jesus identified it I'm gonna go back
[1:47:39] and just read this real quick Matthew
[1:47:41] Matthew 11 verse 10 and 11 I read this
[1:47:43] last week but I'll read it to you again
[1:47:45] this is Jesus identifying John's
[1:47:47] ministry and I got good news for you
[1:47:51] that same
[1:47:52] Jesus identified William branham's
[1:47:55] ministry hallelujah I told you the
[1:47:58] message is on tape
[1:47:59] all you gotta do is go and listen to the
[1:48:01] tapes read the books
[1:48:03] amen his messages his sermons you'll get
[1:48:05] everything that I'm giving you hey man
[1:48:07] here Jesus says Matthew 11 10 through 11
[1:48:09] for this is he of whom it is written
[1:48:11] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:48:14] face which shall prepare thy way before
[1:48:16] thee verily I say unto you among them
[1:48:19] that are born of women there have not
[1:48:20] risen a greater than John the Baptist
[1:48:22] notwithstanding he that is at least in
[1:48:24] the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
[1:48:26] and as I told you Jesus could say that
[1:48:29] because up until that time there had not
[1:48:32] been one born as great as John the
[1:48:33] Baptist and the reason John the Baptist
[1:48:35] minister was so great is because he
[1:48:37] introduced Messiah so if you have
[1:48:39] another person with the same spirit of
[1:48:40] Elijah on them introducing Messiah at
[1:48:43] his second coming or his message is
[1:48:45] introducing it in the side the second
[1:48:46] he's just as great as John the Baptist
[1:48:49] and Jesus eyes amen
[1:48:53] now I could tell you you got to read
[1:48:58] between the lines if you want to know
[1:49:01] the message now how do we know that it's
[1:49:04] just as great and Jesus asked I told you
[1:49:06] early in 1933 the angel the Lord was
[1:49:09] heard declaring as John the Baptist for
[1:49:11] ran my first coming your message will
[1:49:12] forerun my second coming amen another
[1:49:15] thing that happened when brother Branham
[1:49:17] preached revelation chapter 1 revelation
[1:49:20] chapter through 2 and Revelation chapter
[1:49:23] 3 1 1 2 and 3 he titled the sermon a man
[1:49:26] exposition of the seven Church Ages
[1:49:29] after brother Branham which we have this
[1:49:31] right here on the wall amen he preached
[1:49:33] he preached what the seven churches well
[1:49:36] he preached who the stars were the
[1:49:38] messengers he gave us the revelation of
[1:49:40] this in the scripture according to
[1:49:42] scripture and then he told us that the
[1:49:45] the timeline of the ages he gave us
[1:49:47] everything about it he preached it and
[1:49:49] that they preached it where most are to
[1:49:51] stay away from the book of Revelation we
[1:49:53] feast in we feast
[1:49:56] now and at the end of preaching after he
[1:50:00] wrote at this chart himself he wrote it
[1:50:02] out and then preached it and at
[1:50:04] in the preaching on the back wall of the
[1:50:07] church the angel the Lord's the same
[1:50:09] angel that came in Nebuchadnezzar's day
[1:50:11] and wrote on the wall the same manger
[1:50:14] came again and wrote the chart that we
[1:50:15] see right here on the back of the wall
[1:50:17] now you tell me who preaching the Book
[1:50:19] of Revelations and having an angel
[1:50:20] coming right on the wall and tell me
[1:50:21] that that's not God vindicating his word
[1:50:24] the same Jesus that vindicated John the
[1:50:27] Baptist same Jesus that was vindicated
[1:50:30] William and Brandon brother Branham when
[1:50:32] he preached before he preached the seven
[1:50:36] seals they're found in the Book of
[1:50:39] Revelations before he preached that
[1:50:42] supernaturally was of it was visited by
[1:50:44] seven angels who commissioned him and
[1:50:47] the angels had their picture taken they
[1:50:49] were in the form of a cloud mystery
[1:50:52] cloud they have a recorder in and I
[1:50:55] believe Life magazine they got a record
[1:50:56] at 1963 here this mystery clown there
[1:50:59] some have actually said it was a jet
[1:51:02] that formed this cloud but a prophet
[1:51:05] told us that it was not eject it was
[1:51:08] seven angels and he said now they see
[1:51:11] the picture one way but he did not go to
[1:51:13] them and tell them what to do with the
[1:51:15] picture he only came to us and he said
[1:51:19] turn the picture to the right you'll see
[1:51:21] is Jesus that was Jesus vindicating his
[1:51:27] prophet Christ faithful forerunner and I
[1:51:35] got one more for you
[1:51:37] doctor best in Houston was just upset by
[1:51:42] brother Branham preaching and people in
[1:51:44] his church being healed
[1:51:46] he said now this Saint this same true I
[1:51:48] know and say I will debate you on it
[1:51:50] for the RAM state no I'm not gonna argue
[1:51:52] over the scripture but brother Bosworth
[1:51:54] who lived in Miami but I'm saying look I
[1:51:57] take up the argument brother brother
[1:51:58] brother he say I'll take him to debate
[1:51:59] he says I just don't argue with him
[1:52:01] brother Bosworth they say no I want to
[1:52:02] argue with him I promise you I won't
[1:52:03] argue with him they say okay if you
[1:52:05] won't argue with my alleged I let you do
[1:52:07] it brother Bosworth walked out there you
[1:52:09] talk about a soldier in his 80s walking
[1:52:11] out there to the platform and had just
[1:52:13] one question doctor best we're here to
[1:52:15] talk about the word doctor bass they
[1:52:17] said yeah
[1:52:18] he said go get that go get that that
[1:52:19] healer I'll show them right now I show
[1:52:21] me he's just doing all kind of crazy
[1:52:22] things got his fist and brother Bosworth
[1:52:24] face and you know just do it and take a
[1:52:26] picture take a picture
[1:52:27] you know don't all kind of all kind of
[1:52:28] crazies brother Bosworth said I've just
[1:52:30] got one question are the seven compound
[1:52:34] names of Jehovah that's found in the Old
[1:52:36] Testament are they connected to the Lord
[1:52:39] Jesus Christ
[1:52:40] Bosworth knew right there he had him the
[1:52:42] man couldn't say nothing right because
[1:52:45] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:52:46] forever they got to be connected amen
[1:52:49] and Bosworth say he he gonna demand was
[1:52:51] done had all that feel theology all that
[1:52:54] schooling was was reduced down to one
[1:52:56] question is is the seven compound names
[1:53:01] of Jehovah that you read in the Old
[1:53:03] Testament are they connected to the Lord
[1:53:05] Jesus Christ because if they are then
[1:53:06] he's gonna be healing today just as he
[1:53:08] healed back then you say no just go get
[1:53:13] there go get the faith healer I don't
[1:53:15] need to talk to you say I mean you just
[1:53:16] alright this debate is over it's not
[1:53:19] even a debate it's done brother ran was
[1:53:21] sitting up in the top of the bleachers
[1:53:24] there and and and and and just so
[1:53:27] brother Bosworth said you know brother
[1:53:29] Branham is in the building if he want to
[1:53:30] come down and greet the audience he's
[1:53:32] certainly welcome to but this debate is
[1:53:33] over dr. bass had nothing to say so
[1:53:37] brother Branham got up and slowly walked
[1:53:39] on down in Houston Coliseum he walked
[1:53:42] down to the platform they got there to
[1:53:45] the platform and you know just thinking
[1:53:47] the brothers for you know how they
[1:53:48] handle things and everything and and
[1:53:50] there was a photographer that doctor
[1:53:52] best hired he hired right he was
[1:53:59] supposed to be on the enemy side so the
[1:54:02] photographer taking pictures just
[1:54:05] snapping off so so so so when brother
[1:54:08] Brando get up there the photographer
[1:54:09] taking pictures taking pictures went
[1:54:12] back to the after the service was over
[1:54:13] went back to Winnie where they process
[1:54:15] the pictures and all the ones he took a
[1:54:18] doctor bests nothing but the one he took
[1:54:23] a brother Brandon was taken and then
[1:54:26] there was a supernatural halo on the top
[1:54:29] of brother branham's hand and he looked
[1:54:31] at us and I
[1:54:32] this is kind of strange nobody saw the
[1:54:34] supernatural being in the audience but
[1:54:37] yet he showed up on the picture and when
[1:54:40] they when they certainly had to get that
[1:54:41] they wanted to get the like an FBI
[1:54:42] specialist to come in and look at this
[1:54:44] picture and you know and just kind of
[1:54:45] confirm and they they confirm and now
[1:54:47] it's hanging there in Washington DC
[1:54:50] what's the name of that place again
[1:54:53] Library of Congress hanging at Library
[1:54:56] of Congress in Washington DC and say say
[1:54:58] it's the only supernatural being
[1:55:00] actually record it on a picture like
[1:55:03] that now I would say this maybe into
[1:55:07] that time because when brother Quentin
[1:55:15] came here this church moving down from
[1:55:18] the Washington DC area he had a little
[1:55:21] video and we saw the pillar fire going
[1:55:24] in and out of the seats here praise the
[1:55:27] Lord he is the same yesterday today and
[1:55:30] forever now it's not that we got a new
[1:55:32] message it's because we're preaching the
[1:55:35] same message that the Prophet gave us
[1:55:36] that's why we're still seeing the
[1:55:37] supernatural see there's a supernatural
[1:55:41] element that remains despite the
[1:55:44] revelation oh I love the Lord Jesus God
[1:55:49] has had himself some faithful
[1:55:51] forerunners we don't have much longer
[1:55:53] just s oh I got to give you give you
[1:55:56] this last quote I'm sorry I got to give
[1:55:58] you this from this is not a program in
[1:55:59] church H 176 to run this and I will wind
[1:56:05] it up right here oh Jesus now this quote
[1:56:11] that I'm reading to you actually is the
[1:56:13] end of the the the right pick up your
[1:56:17] pen and write this just this portion
[1:56:19] that I'm reading to you is the end of
[1:56:20] where the angel told brother Brandon
[1:56:22] pick up his pen and write now I thought
[1:56:24] this would be appropriate to read now
[1:56:26] but it doesn't mean that we're at the
[1:56:28] end of step into the vision we got some
[1:56:30] other things we want to share but here I
[1:56:32] want to bring this I thought was very
[1:56:33] appropriate says the last day messenger
[1:56:36] will appear in God's appointed time it
[1:56:39] is the end time now as all know for
[1:56:41] Israel is in the homeland any time now
[1:56:44] he will come to
[1:56:45] come according to Malachi when we see
[1:56:48] him he would be dedicated to the word he
[1:56:51] will be he would he would be dedicated
[1:56:56] to where he would be indicated pointed
[1:56:58] out in the in the word revelation 10 7
[1:57:00] and God will vindicate his ministry he
[1:57:04] will preach the truth as did Elijah and
[1:57:06] be ready for the Mount Zion showdown
[1:57:09] many will misunderstand him because they
[1:57:12] have been taught scripture in a certain
[1:57:14] way which they consider truth don't mean
[1:57:18] it's the truth has just been taught that
[1:57:19] way right
[1:57:20] it says when it comes against that they
[1:57:22] will not believe even some true
[1:57:25] ministers will misunderstand the
[1:57:26] messenger because so much has been
[1:57:28] called God's truth by deceivers now this
[1:57:32] is the important thing right here
[1:57:34] but this prophet will come and as the
[1:57:37] forerunner of the first coming cry
[1:57:39] behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[1:57:43] the sin of the world even so will he no
[1:57:46] doubt cry out behold the lamb of God
[1:57:49] coming in glory he will do this for even
[1:57:53] as John was the messenger of truth to
[1:57:55] the elect so is this one the last
[1:57:58] messenger to the elect and were born
[1:58:03] bright he's not everybody's messenger
[1:58:08] but he is mine because the message was
[1:58:11] not to everybody but it was to me thank
[1:58:15] God for his faithful forerunner amen
[1:58:20] let's bow in a word of Prayer father how
[1:58:25] grateful we are for truth we would never
[1:58:30] be where we are had we not had this
[1:58:34] truth presented to us
[1:58:35] you called us out of something to bring
[1:58:40] us into this it's not my accident it's
[1:58:43] not my chance it's by for knowledge by
[1:58:46] predestination God that you would allow
[1:58:49] us to fellowship around this God our
[1:58:52] prayer in our desires that you would
[1:58:54] open up the understanding of each and
[1:58:57] every heart
[1:58:58] that they wouldn't miss what you were
[1:59:00] doing in this power people missed it in
[1:59:04] John's day people missed it and Jesus
[1:59:08] day God don't let him miss it today
[1:59:12] that's our sincere desire
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:17] God you had a faithful forerunner to
[1:59:19] come and and he's coming he's gone but
[1:59:22] Lord has left this message and in the
[1:59:25] form of books and tapes all we gotta do
[1:59:27] is listen to it all we got to do is here
[1:59:29] in God it would it will open up our
[1:59:32] understanding so Lord let us be faithful
[1:59:34] God as our prayer
[1:59:37] let us stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:59:40] standing against all the criticism and
[1:59:43] everything else and all the other evil
[1:59:45] reports let us stand guard with the
[1:59:48] truth that has been given to us in this
[1:59:49] hour we know it won't be long god you'll
[1:59:51] be coming for us some Jesus name
[1:59:56] that we pray
[1:59:59] amen amen amen
[2:00:14] praise the Lord but God's Word is right
[2:00:17] I know it's right amen and I tell you
