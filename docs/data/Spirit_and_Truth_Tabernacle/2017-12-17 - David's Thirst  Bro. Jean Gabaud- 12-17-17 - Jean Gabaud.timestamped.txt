[54:31] chapter 23 jump right into the word
[54:41] second Samuel chapter 23 verse 8 then
[54:50] we'll reverse a through 17 say man if
[54:55] you did all right these be the names of
[55:00] the mighty man whom David had the the
[55:05] Tecla night that sat in the seat chief
[55:07] among the captains the same was adeno
[55:10] the as night he lifts up his spear
[55:12] against eight hundred whom he slew at
[55:14] one time and after him was Eliezer the
[55:18] son of dodo delhi one of the three
[55:20] mighty men with David when they defied
[55:23] the Philistines that were there gathered
[55:25] together to battle and the man of Israel
[55:28] were gone away he arose and smote the
[55:30] Philistines until his hand was very
[55:32] and his hand Cleveland to the sword and
[55:34] the Lord brought a great victory that
[55:37] day and the people returned after him
[55:39] only to spoil and after I'm a Shama the
[55:42] son of a gay the horite and the
[55:44] Philistines were gathered together into
[55:46] a truth where was a piece of ground full
[55:49] of lentils and the people fled from the
[55:51] Philistines but he stood in the midst of
[55:54] the ground and defended it and slew the
[55:56] Philistines in the Lord Radha great
[55:57] victory and our concentration is on a
[56:00] common verse at verse 13 through 17 and
[56:03] three of the thirty chief went down and
[56:06] came to David in the harvest time and to
[56:09] the to the cave of Adela and the troop
[56:12] of the Philistines pitched in the valley
[56:13] of recommen and David was then in a hold
[56:16] in the garrison of the Philistines was
[56:19] then in Bethlehem and David long and
[56:22] said all that one would give me drink of
[56:24] the water of the well of Bethlehem which
[56:26] is by the gate and the three mighty men
[56:28] break through the host of the
[56:30] Philistines and drew order out of that
[56:33] well of Bethlehem that was by the gate
[56:35] and took it and brought it to David
[56:37] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[56:40] but poured it out unto the Lord and he
[56:42] said be it far from me O Lord that I
[56:44] should do this is not this the blood of
[56:47] the man that went in jeopardy of their
[56:48] lives therefore he would not drink it
[56:51] these things did these three mighty men
[56:53] a man made the Lord had his blessing so
[56:55] reading of the word you may be seated
[57:03] I'm not one for titles but if I was to
[57:06] give this one I'd like to title it
[57:08] David's thirst you're just about with me
[57:14] been a little bit under the weather but
[57:15] you know we're not gonna let the devil
[57:17] stop me from preaching the Word of God
[57:18] hey man so I'm just kind of a little
[57:23] thought here looking at David's thirst
[57:25] and I'll uh I like the story of david's
[57:30] mighty men because it talks about their
[57:34] bravery it talks about their their
[57:37] commitment their it talks about a lawyer
[57:40] there were two David and you know no
[57:44] matter how you know things
[57:46] were good sometimes and things were
[57:48] challenging sometimes but they remained
[57:52] faithful to David and you know these
[57:56] were not you know these were not your
[57:59] elite they were not your cream of the
[58:02] crop if you whoa the Bible talks about
[58:04] how in 1 Samuel 23 says in David
[58:08] therefore departed thence in the skate
[58:10] to the cave a Dunham and when his
[58:13] brethren in all his father's house heard
[58:17] it they were they went down thither to
[58:20] him and every one that is in distress
[58:23] and every one that was in debt and
[58:26] everyone that was discontented gathered
[58:29] themselves unto him and he became
[58:33] captain over them and there were with
[58:36] them 400 men so David didn't want any
[58:40] trouble in the kingdom so he parted ways
[58:43] with Saul and he found himself in the
[58:47] cave adela and in order to maintain
[58:50] peace you know that's where he was at
[58:53] and so his you know some men joined up
[58:57] with David and the Bible talks about how
[58:59] that these were men that were distressed
[59:01] these were man that were discontented
[59:04] and these were man that were in debt so
[59:07] they brought baggage they carry the load
[59:11] with them and my the burden must have
[59:14] been so heavy on them but David didn't
[59:17] discriminate he didn't discount
[59:20] he didn't discredit he welcomed those
[59:22] men he invited those men and he accepted
[59:25] those men for what they for what they
[59:28] were and what they brought to the table
[59:30] and they they joined up with David and
[59:34] you know they went through quite a bit
[59:37] of a journey and the thing about you
[59:40] know life and itself is that the journey
[59:43] you know you go through testing periods
[59:46] you go through trials and it's the time
[59:49] to make you that much stronger
[59:53] all of us I presume carry wound
[59:57] the scars of life's journey and the fact
[1:00:01] that you still heal that the fact that
[1:00:03] you still here this morning is only an
[1:00:05] indication that you're bigger than that
[1:00:07] that try to kill you because you know we
[1:00:12] have these trials we have these testings
[1:00:15] we have these obstacles that are put in
[1:00:18] front of us and it just makes us that
[1:00:21] much stronger it makes you as an
[1:00:23] individual stronger and make sure your
[1:00:26] family's stronger it makes your marriage
[1:00:29] stronger every aspect of your life is
[1:00:32] tested because god has confidence in you
[1:00:35] and when you don't have confidence in
[1:00:38] your stuff God has confidence in you but
[1:00:40] when you don't think you're gonna make
[1:00:42] it God already sees you on the other
[1:00:44] side when you say that you're defeated
[1:00:46] guys that you're victorious you know we
[1:00:49] have to look we'll have to look at
[1:00:50] ourselves the way God looks at us and
[1:00:54] and and I welcome these trials because
[1:00:57] you know it's no different in a child
[1:01:00] that's born into an unknown world they
[1:01:03] have to be exposed to the elements so
[1:01:05] that way they could build an immune
[1:01:07] system to withstand the the trials of
[1:01:11] life so when diseases come up upon the
[1:01:14] child that their immune system is is as
[1:01:17] such that it's strong to withstand those
[1:01:20] trials it could overcome those diseases
[1:01:23] and then so when that same disease tries
[1:01:25] to come back later on in life that that
[1:01:28] child's body has built an immune system
[1:01:31] that could resist those diseases and
[1:01:34] essentially debod the body is telling
[1:01:36] those diseases
[1:01:37] you gotta come better than this I've
[1:01:39] already went through this trial I've
[1:01:42] overcome this and that's the same thing
[1:01:44] that God has exposed to you and I we've
[1:01:47] been through some battles we've been
[1:01:49] through some trials we've been through
[1:01:52] some circumstances and so when the devil
[1:01:54] tries the same tactic that he did before
[1:01:56] it cannot work because it didn't work
[1:01:59] before it's not gonna work now he has to
[1:02:02] come
[1:02:02] better than that he has to come stronger
[1:02:04] than that and every time that God
[1:02:06] overcomes in your life you become
[1:02:09] stronger in the trials that Saint has
[1:02:11] put in you God is building these immune
[1:02:18] system to make you withstand the trials
[1:02:22] that you encounter in life so when the
[1:02:27] devil tries to the same tactic you could
[1:02:29] look the devil in the eye says you gotta
[1:02:31] come better than that I overcame that
[1:02:35] trial years ago
[1:02:37] you gotta come better than that and
[1:02:40] don't be dismayed when the devil knocks
[1:02:43] you down on your feet you get yourself
[1:02:45] right back up just take that dust out
[1:02:48] and you keep on marching and you let the
[1:02:50] devil know you didn't stop me then
[1:02:52] you're not gonna stop me now sure life's
[1:03:02] a journey it's a trial but God doesn't
[1:03:06] put more on you than what you're capable
[1:03:08] of doing and God is watching your
[1:03:13] journey the footsteps of the righteous
[1:03:16] are ordered of God and you know I think
[1:03:21] about this is David in his latter years
[1:03:25] and right before he cross over he's
[1:03:28] reflecting on these men and how that
[1:03:32] these men stood with David they were
[1:03:35] they went through thick and thin there
[1:03:39] were high moments there were low moments
[1:03:43] and God was with them every step of the
[1:03:46] way it was even at one point where
[1:03:50] David's men they they came back and the
[1:03:54] the Amalekites came and took the
[1:03:56] families of David and his men they came
[1:04:00] from they were I believe two Gilgal and
[1:04:03] the families were taken their men the
[1:04:06] mela kites took the women took the
[1:04:08] children and David in this man they were
[1:04:11] returning back from from battle
[1:04:15] I could see in the distance the the the
[1:04:18] cloud the smoke billowing in the village
[1:04:20] perhaps that they were in and they knew
[1:04:23] that something was wrong and so they
[1:04:26] arrived at the scene and there was in
[1:04:29] total chaos disarray
[1:04:31] family is at disarray and and in the
[1:04:35] women was taken the children and my
[1:04:37] those men the rage that built within
[1:04:41] them and the Bible says how that they
[1:04:44] grabbed a stone and then we're getting
[1:04:47] ready to stone David man can you just
[1:04:50] imagine they've been so loyal to him up
[1:04:53] unto this point but this time it was
[1:04:54] really personal cuz the wives were
[1:04:57] taking their children was taken to their
[1:04:59] home was ravaged and and everything was
[1:05:01] damaged and so they took stones the
[1:05:05] Bible says and then we're getting ready
[1:05:06] to stone David after so many things have
[1:05:08] gone through but this was kind of the
[1:05:10] tipping point and David you know that's
[1:05:13] that's that's what it means what it
[1:05:15] means to be a leader is not to be not to
[1:05:19] be moved by just emotions you gotta be
[1:05:23] steady when things aren't always perfect
[1:05:26] you gotta have such a foundation you
[1:05:29] know where you stand that when you're
[1:05:32] dealing with adversity when you're
[1:05:34] dealing with confusion you gotta know
[1:05:36] where you stand with God that is so
[1:05:38] important when you're the head of your
[1:05:40] family the head of a church a world if
[1:05:43] you're playing society you gotta know
[1:05:45] where you stand what your position is
[1:05:46] because if you don't stand for something
[1:05:48] you'll fall for anything and people
[1:05:52] watch your emotions your family's lunch
[1:05:54] emotions with things like an out of date
[1:05:56] they're chaotic but when you hold a
[1:06:00] steady hand and you're firm and what God
[1:06:03] has told has given to you no matter all
[1:06:06] the panic around you you know where you
[1:06:08] stand with God and these men that came
[1:06:13] with their stones and David could have
[1:06:14] shows a bit of reaction but David was
[1:06:16] steady his only response was man I need
[1:06:20] to go pray about this that's probably
[1:06:23] the least that they wanted to hear from
[1:06:25] David it's pretty obvious what they
[1:06:27] needed to do
[1:06:28] they're they're wise were taking the
[1:06:30] family was taken we just need to get our
[1:06:33] sword and let's go after the enemy that
[1:06:36] came in and swept through it caused
[1:06:38] chaos in the home but they was like no
[1:06:41] before we take any action no matter how
[1:06:45] justifiable it looks I need to go seek
[1:06:48] God and prayer yesterday's victory
[1:06:54] doesn't it doesn't guarantee today's
[1:06:56] victory I think God for the victories
[1:07:01] yesterday but I gotta get up in the
[1:07:03] morning and put my stuff on my knees and
[1:07:05] say Lord in order for me to have a
[1:07:07] repeat of yesterday I need to have you
[1:07:10] in my life today
[1:07:15] so David he didn't take God for granted
[1:07:19] he didn't just assume that it was the
[1:07:21] right thing to do he needed confirmation
[1:07:25] so he consulted the Urim and Thummim he
[1:07:30] consulted the priests and God says go up
[1:07:34] go after the Amalekites and I will
[1:07:38] restore unto you everything that was
[1:07:41] taken the difference between that action
[1:07:47] and what David then the action that
[1:07:50] David could have taken if he didn't pray
[1:07:52] was that David would have went up there
[1:07:55] presuming he would have went up there
[1:07:57] within his own justification by his all
[1:08:00] means of righteousness that would have
[1:08:03] that would have been his only difference
[1:08:04] and there's nothing guaranteed with that
[1:08:08] but-but-but-but-but retrospect Lee David
[1:08:12] begins to pray he consults God he has an
[1:08:16] answer from God and so he now knows that
[1:08:20] he's going up there victorious so it
[1:08:26] doesn't matter what others have to say
[1:08:29] he's confirmed it with God it's one
[1:08:34] thing for you to do something because it
[1:08:36] looks like it's the right thing to do
[1:08:37] it's an
[1:08:38] when you know God spoke to your hearts
[1:08:41] people may criticize your decision but
[1:08:44] God spoke to your heart
[1:08:45] people may criticize your actions but
[1:08:48] God spoke to your heart
[1:08:49] people may criticize the way you
[1:08:51] approach it but God spoke sweetheart if
[1:08:53] God speaks to my heart I don't know man
[1:08:56] no explanation because my actions is
[1:09:00] dictated by God my thoughts is dictated
[1:09:04] by God my decision is confirmed by the
[1:09:07] word and I'm obligated to one source and
[1:09:10] that's God alone and that's the reason
[1:09:17] why in my natural walk when I come back
[1:09:19] and I consult the Word of God you may
[1:09:21] not see it from my perspective but I
[1:09:24] know that God has convinced me in my
[1:09:25] heart and the Bible says all things work
[1:09:29] together for the good to them that I
[1:09:33] call on God because as long as I stay
[1:09:36] true to that word he'll come around God
[1:09:38] will show you the reason for my actions
[1:09:40] and there's just there's just a piece
[1:09:46] that overwhelms an individual when he
[1:09:50] knows that he's in the order of God he's
[1:09:54] under the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:09:57] and so therefore he's no longer acting
[1:10:00] out of whim he's not acting out of I
[1:10:03] hope so he's not acting out of maybe but
[1:10:07] he's got in the shirt yes
[1:10:09] he's gotten certainty but everything
[1:10:11] else is being certain of God are you
[1:10:15] certain of God or is he just as being
[1:10:20] that we come in we we fantasy him and we
[1:10:23] we worship Him in hopes that you know
[1:10:25] that this this being that we call God to
[1:10:28] connect with us lose a sense it's much
[1:10:30] more than a fantasy it's the reality of
[1:10:34] what I believe let me tell you I have
[1:10:36] sacrificed you have sacrificed a lot in
[1:10:39] your life I am NOT treating this Bible
[1:10:42] as a fairy tale Mauro's my soul rest
[1:10:45] the promises of God's words don't waste
[1:10:50] your time claim church if you ain't
[1:10:52] serious about this but I believe
[1:10:57] everything that's printed in this book
[1:11:02] and so David brought a victory and in
[1:11:06] the latter years David begins to reflect
[1:11:09] on the men that stood with him and he
[1:11:14] begins to recount some of these men
[1:11:18] because in the beginning chapter the
[1:11:20] Bible of that chapter I read the Bible
[1:11:21] says that God these were the last words
[1:11:23] of David the son of Jesse and he begins
[1:11:28] to talk about these men and just to kind
[1:11:31] of highlight some of these things you
[1:11:33] know the name of he begins to talk about
[1:11:36] the the names of the mighty man of David
[1:11:39] the tech my knight that sat in the seat
[1:11:42] chief among the captains the same was
[1:11:45] the Dino
[1:11:46] there's night he lifted up his spear
[1:11:49] eight hundred whom he slew at one time
[1:11:52] you know these men they were subject to
[1:11:58] the same anointing that David was they
[1:12:04] were they were they didn't catch his
[1:12:07] spirit they won't they won't twist
[1:12:08] you know twisting like they David
[1:12:10] twisted or twitch but they had the same
[1:12:12] anointing and I'm gonna explain what
[1:12:16] that means a little bit but these men
[1:12:18] they they saw how God delivered David in
[1:12:23] his life and how he walked a great
[1:12:26] things in how he was a strategist and
[1:12:30] how he was a a warrior and how he
[1:12:32] approached God and these men became
[1:12:36] subject they were they were anointed
[1:12:39] with the same spirit that David was and
[1:12:42] and we know that David is a type so so
[1:12:46] the same as these man that followed
[1:12:48] David saw you as disciples of Jesus
[1:12:52] Christ you're anointed with the same
[1:12:54] spirit that Christ had that that's the
[1:12:57] reason
[1:12:58] you act the way you do that's the reason
[1:13:00] why God has empowered you for certain
[1:13:03] tasks in your life and so the Bible
[1:13:07] talks about how one of them which stood
[1:13:10] 800 and it was one against 800 and
[1:13:15] that's the way God has always played it
[1:13:17] in the scripture is that his people was
[1:13:21] always the ones that were at odds it
[1:13:24] didn't always look favorable to them and
[1:13:28] but God that's what God comes along and
[1:13:30] that's what he demonstrated his grace
[1:13:35] because he didn't want you to think you
[1:13:38] could do it I want you to catch it he
[1:13:44] doesn't want you to think that you have
[1:13:46] the ability to do it yourself the
[1:13:50] biggest opportunity that all of us have
[1:13:53] is to remove the element of human
[1:13:56] ability and let God work in your life
[1:14:03] you might say brother Gina I'm a young
[1:14:06] student and I mean I'm in school and I
[1:14:08] need this I need to pass my grades I
[1:14:11] need to pass my tests take up the human
[1:14:13] ability and let God begin to come into
[1:14:16] your life and he begins to bring things
[1:14:18] into your remembrance when you're
[1:14:20] sitting there at the day of taking the
[1:14:22] test and you're able to find the answers
[1:14:24] that you thought you didn't know you
[1:14:26] knew you might say brother gene I'm
[1:14:30] looking for a job and I gotta have this
[1:14:32] interview I want to be able to say
[1:14:33] correctly if you pick out the human
[1:14:36] element and you let God into your life
[1:14:38] the Bible says he will be you will be
[1:14:41] brought before magistrates and you'll
[1:14:43] know exactly what to say it's not yours
[1:14:46] it's God's words in your lips you gotta
[1:14:52] take out the human element with same
[1:14:54] Seamster those are not savable when the
[1:14:57] probability doesn't look in your favor
[1:15:00] let me tell you well people that define
[1:15:02] all probability
[1:15:04] we defy all odds when they say it's not
[1:15:08] possible God looks at you say you are
[1:15:10] impossible
[1:15:11] I don't speak the devil's language when
[1:15:18] the devil says you can't do it I stood
[1:15:20] by God's grace I am more than able when
[1:15:24] the devil says you're not gonna make it
[1:15:26] I said by God's place I am gonna make it
[1:15:29] every time the devil tells you something
[1:15:31] you're gonna come and believe that it's
[1:15:33] the opposite of what the devil's out you
[1:15:41] won against 800 I've been in that
[1:15:46] situation several times work that the
[1:15:48] enemy in the land seem like Giants
[1:15:54] sometimes the task is a tall order and
[1:15:57] you don't know how you're gonna get
[1:16:00] through the day you don't know how
[1:16:01] you're gonna get through the week you
[1:16:03] don't know how you're gonna get through
[1:16:04] the conversations you don't know how
[1:16:06] you're gonna get through the bills in
[1:16:07] the mail I've been there and they seem
[1:16:12] like to keep piling on and they don't be
[1:16:16] the screen a date they're nice and
[1:16:17] bright so that way when you pulled out
[1:16:18] your mobile everybody sees that you got
[1:16:21] a late notice lime green or pink and I
[1:16:27] try to hang it with the rest of the
[1:16:28] envelopes without where people don't see
[1:16:30] me put my business all out there I'm
[1:16:32] gonna pay you when I'm but it lady sits
[1:16:38] there in the kitchen table and every day
[1:16:41] you're reminded of the trials of life
[1:16:43] you're burdened by things and then next
[1:16:46] thing you know you got to work overtime
[1:16:47] in order to try to you know just try to
[1:16:50] keep up with the payments and the devil
[1:16:52] knows he's doing that to you so that we
[1:16:54] need to warp I miss the service today if
[1:16:56] I miss the service tomorrow we gotta
[1:16:58] rise above the tactics that the devil
[1:17:02] if we give glory to God because he's the
[1:17:05] awesome power of the universe he could
[1:17:07] take care of any possible bill that sits
[1:17:10] on the kitchen table he's greater than
[1:17:12] any doctor that could diagnose you with
[1:17:14] the false diagnosis we defy odds we're
[1:17:25] not we're not a statistic I'm above a
[1:17:28] statistic
[1:17:29] they say statistically this will happen
[1:17:31] one time you reached a certain age or
[1:17:33] sister and race was this certain Gina
[1:17:35] Gina Thurston family we rise the bluff
[1:17:38] statistics we have to come to the point
[1:17:44] that we believe that your your chosen
[1:17:47] people a peculiar people think about
[1:17:52] that I want you to I want that to kind
[1:17:53] of meditate a little bit 7 billion
[1:17:55] people on planet Earth
[1:17:56] and God says I have chosen you if you
[1:18:04] were to count from 1/2 million
[1:18:07] just one - it will take you 11 days just
[1:18:12] to get to a million to count from 1 to
[1:18:15] billion
[1:18:16] they'll take you I think 30 to 34 years
[1:18:19] the point I'm bringing is 7 billion is a
[1:18:23] lot and yet God bypass Palaces bypass
[1:18:31] White House bypass mentions cathedrals
[1:18:36] and came to this little corner Church
[1:18:38] and decide to have his resting place
[1:18:41] here he decides to come and have Church
[1:18:45] with you he decide to come the Bible
[1:18:48] says that the Bible says that God
[1:18:50] inhabits the praises of his people they
[1:18:55] might make a lot of noise but I want God
[1:18:57] inside this house and we said praise the
[1:19:02] Lord the Bible also talks about Elly's
[1:19:07] or the son of though to the L high one
[1:19:10] of the three mighty men when they defy
[1:19:12] the full scenes that one was there with
[1:19:13] them gathers together
[1:19:14] and the man of Israel gone away he arose
[1:19:17] and smote the Philistines with his hand
[1:19:19] until his hand was weary and his hand
[1:19:23] clave unto the sword I don't know about
[1:19:30] you but sometimes I get tired a little
[1:19:32] bit sometimes I feel like a Christian
[1:19:36] sometimes maybe you're just there but
[1:19:41] for me it's still a battle sometimes
[1:19:47] there are Saints in the scripture that
[1:19:49] gets weary they get tired every day is a
[1:19:54] constant fight every day it's a back
[1:20:00] from the moment you get up saying this
[1:20:02] out the door just wait to test you from
[1:20:06] the morning traffic that you have to
[1:20:08] deal with when you're running late for
[1:20:09] work and you trying to be a patient as
[1:20:13] you care you come behind the slowest
[1:20:16] driver people cut in front of you and
[1:20:19] every line is red that devil is trying
[1:20:26] you and you try your best you put on a
[1:20:30] CD and you start singing some song but
[1:20:33] it's just not resonating does it so it's
[1:20:37] a fight you get to work and your boss
[1:20:41] says why are you late I see that you're
[1:20:43] late well you realize you're late soup
[1:20:45] with the mean the fact that you bring it
[1:20:47] to my assistant doesn't help me any
[1:20:48] better are you gonna have this report
[1:20:53] done by such-and-such time are you gonna
[1:20:55] be able to get this done by such as
[1:20:56] that's fine I need you to work overtime
[1:20:58] and it happens to be a special service
[1:21:00] week can we step raise the Lord
[1:21:08] and you were through the day you
[1:21:13] overwhelm us work you barely get a grab
[1:21:16] to eat and right before you get ready to
[1:21:19] head out your boss want to come in or
[1:21:21] your peer or someone wants to come in
[1:21:23] say hey can I have a conversation with
[1:21:25] you you have me for the entire day since
[1:21:30] eight o'clock this morning since nine
[1:21:32] o'clock if I was late since nine o'clock
[1:21:34] this morning you saw me we had coffee
[1:21:38] together you came to my office or my
[1:21:42] cubicle and you talked a little bit not
[1:21:43] one time did you bring up that issue and
[1:21:45] here it is right before I leave to go to
[1:21:48] the church you want to have a
[1:21:48] conversation about something let's do
[1:21:50] tomorrow that devil knows how to get
[1:21:53] ahold of you every day it's a fight then
[1:21:59] you gotta pick up the children from
[1:22:01] school then you gotta make sure that the
[1:22:04] family's taken care of with food on the
[1:22:06] table and so many obligations you gotta
[1:22:08] run to the grocery store you gotta do
[1:22:10] this you gotta do that you get
[1:22:12] unexpected phone call and this and that
[1:22:14] and you get so tired in your body you
[1:22:17] get so tired in your spirit but I think
[1:22:19] God then I got has built you to be more
[1:22:22] resilient than that then you can endure
[1:22:25] any challenges that comes across your
[1:22:27] way that with any negative thought that
[1:22:29] you would rather quit you say Lord I'm
[1:22:31] gonna hold on to this word because
[1:22:33] there's no other gospel that I could
[1:22:35] turn to you hold on no matter what
[1:22:41] happens you press on no matter what
[1:22:45] challenges you face you remain resilient
[1:22:48] the boss says I pressed towards the mark
[1:22:50] of the prize of the high calling it
[1:22:52] suppressing the violence is the kingdom
[1:22:58] of God comes by force and the violence
[1:23:00] taking it by force it's a fight but you
[1:23:06] remain resilient you remain committed
[1:23:08] and then when you get slapped up
[1:23:10] throughout the week you don't give up
[1:23:15] when you trip you don't give up
[1:23:19] you don't let the devil sow seeds of
[1:23:22] thought since she had by saying well a
[1:23:24] true Christian wouldn't do that
[1:23:26] a true Christian wouldn't say that you
[1:23:30] tell the devil you know what you're
[1:23:31] right I apologize let me go repent about
[1:23:33] that you take what the devil tell you
[1:23:37] switch it around you know you ain't
[1:23:39] supposed to do that you're never gonna
[1:23:41] make that right I appreciate you telling
[1:23:42] me that that was not his intentions but
[1:23:46] you caught him by surprise you gotta let
[1:23:49] the devil know that you're God's side
[1:23:55] and no matter how tired you get you when
[1:23:59] that church doors open let me tell you
[1:24:01] things you might be late I've been in
[1:24:02] that position before I'm weaving in and
[1:24:04] out of traffic I'm trying to get him
[1:24:05] because I want to be an example I may be
[1:24:07] late but thank God I'm here I made it to
[1:24:10] church I may just get a morsel of bread
[1:24:13] I got something that fed my soul I got
[1:24:16] something that's gonna nourish me I got
[1:24:18] something that's gonna encourage me for
[1:24:19] the battle we ought to be a group of
[1:24:26] people that every time we get up the
[1:24:27] devil doesn't know what to do with you
[1:24:30] he starts scratching his head he just
[1:24:32] doesn't know what to do with you praise
[1:24:37] the Lord
[1:24:38] and after I'm with Shama and then the
[1:24:42] Bible talks about how there was a piece
[1:24:44] of wood there was a piece of ground
[1:24:46] where the Philistines will come and and
[1:24:49] and and in the truth were there and they
[1:24:51] and the people of what would would flee
[1:24:55] but one day he said enough is enough and
[1:24:59] he stood his ground in the midst of the
[1:25:03] ground and he defended it is out to be
[1:25:07] your attitude where you say you know
[1:25:11] what enough s'en up and you hold your
[1:25:15] ground and you say you know what this
[1:25:18] day it's not a New Year's resolution
[1:25:19] resolution Saul my today you say I'm
[1:25:23] gonna make a difference
[1:25:24] I'm gonna faint differently I'm gonna
[1:25:27] act
[1:25:28] differently I'm gonna behave differently
[1:25:31] I'm gonna be an exemple if this is any
[1:25:32] truth to it and I wanna pour my soul
[1:25:35] into it and I want to be an example
[1:25:37] today I'm gonna be different today I'm
[1:25:41] gonna hold stand my ground and it's
[1:25:49] making more than just a declaration but
[1:25:53] make it action and the servant got tired
[1:25:59] of the Philistines year every year
[1:26:00] coming to take the land faces nine
[1:26:04] you've taken my family too much you've
[1:26:07] tortured them you've tortured my you
[1:26:10] you've tortured my my marriage you've
[1:26:12] tortured the church you've tortured no
[1:26:13] no more I'm gonna hold my ground stood
[1:26:17] his ground you stand with the word the
[1:26:20] word will stand with you you go visit
[1:26:24] the doctor the doctor tells you said
[1:26:26] something that just doesn't seem right
[1:26:27] you hold you guys that you know what
[1:26:29] today I'm gonna stick my ground I'm
[1:26:31] gonna believe what God says he's the
[1:26:32] great physician that could be touched by
[1:26:34] the feelings of my infirmities hold your
[1:26:37] ground
[1:26:39] and then the Bible talks about these
[1:26:42] three men these men were the Bible says
[1:26:51] that the three of the 33 of the
[1:26:54] thirty-eighth went down and came to
[1:26:56] David 3 out of 30 is 10% and God says in
[1:27:03] his word the tenth is holy unto me so
[1:27:06] these were holy men a type of the bride
[1:27:10] and it came to David in the harvest time
[1:27:14] in the cave of Adela now these were men
[1:27:20] that you know they weren't move by the
[1:27:25] dwelling place of where David was that
[1:27:28] because wherever the king is that that's
[1:27:31] where I want to be so then go to some
[1:27:35] great monastery some great cathedral
[1:27:38] some great church but they came into a
[1:27:40] cave
[1:27:41] and these men were not embarrassed so
[1:27:45] when people ask me where do you go to
[1:27:46] church I was telling my church where do
[1:27:48] you go to church is it that one big
[1:27:50] church over that like no is it that big
[1:27:52] treasure I'm like no it's like it's
[1:27:53] about a hundred of us in a little plaza
[1:27:56] area it's a really small church but made
[1:27:58] the fire of God falls in that church
[1:28:01] I'm not embarrassed I'm not ashamed to
[1:28:05] tell them when I go to church and what I
[1:28:08] believe in like I never heard of it I'm
[1:28:13] like I know I know a lot of people don't
[1:28:15] have a heard of the true teachings of
[1:28:16] Jesus Christ soon and the door opens up
[1:28:20] for me to begin to have a conversation
[1:28:23] so these men were not embarrassing
[1:28:26] either they were not afraid to culture
[1:28:28] the cave or dalam cuz that's what David
[1:28:30] was that and so as they pulled in the
[1:28:34] Bible talked about how David was in a
[1:28:36] hold of the garret and David was then in
[1:28:38] a hold in the garret and the garrison of
[1:28:41] the full scenes was been in Bethlehem
[1:28:44] and there was baby began to remark a
[1:28:48] little bit not what you follow this dog
[1:28:51] but Ram says this he says in the man
[1:28:53] that could turn the light David himself
[1:28:54] being born in the city he had to come to
[1:28:57] this little spot and it was called
[1:28:59] Bethlehem which means the house of God
[1:29:01] spread and he is the house of God's
[1:29:04] bride and David laying there on the hill
[1:29:06] that day he looked down and seeing the
[1:29:08] Philistines garrison around like that
[1:29:10] must have gone hot and thirsty and he
[1:29:14] said oh if I could just have a drink
[1:29:17] from that well once more and he says why
[1:29:20] the least of his thoughts was a command
[1:29:24] to them who loved him so David there was
[1:29:28] watching and in the distance he saw how
[1:29:30] the Philistines had gathered themselves
[1:29:32] around the city Bethlehem and he only
[1:29:35] just you know breathe a certain a word
[1:29:39] or phrase oh if I could drink from the
[1:29:42] well of Bethlehem keep in mind it was
[1:29:44] not a commandment he was given but it
[1:29:47] was just portraying his desire of what
[1:29:50] he wanted and so these men overheard
[1:29:54] David as
[1:29:55] looked into the distance and saw how
[1:29:57] that the Philistines were surrounding
[1:29:59] themselves surrounding themselves around
[1:30:01] the well and they overheard David and
[1:30:04] they were moved with compassion to
[1:30:08] fulfill David's desire so sometimes it's
[1:30:15] not a commandment but just fulfilling
[1:30:19] God's desire are we staying together
[1:30:26] sometimes it's just knowing what God
[1:30:29] expects of you and not a commandment
[1:30:34] don't don't treat this book don't treat
[1:30:40] the message as rules and regulations
[1:30:45] you're not bonded by this message you're
[1:30:48] not no you're not you're not you know
[1:30:50] against your will we're I have to do
[1:30:53] this I can't do that that's not how you
[1:30:55] should live your life you're going to be
[1:30:59] miserable if that's how you feel because
[1:31:03] every interaction with someone want I
[1:31:04] can't do this because my belief tells me
[1:31:07] to I can't go here and I can't say this
[1:31:10] and I can't wear that don't blame the
[1:31:12] message for how your personal life may
[1:31:15] be because you haven't been fully
[1:31:17] converted a little sister there but the
[1:31:24] moment you have a true born-again
[1:31:26] experience it transcends beyond the do's
[1:31:30] and don'ts you do not do things because
[1:31:33] you don't want to do it because you want
[1:31:35] to please God your love for God is far
[1:31:39] greater than anything that you could
[1:31:41] ever imagine so you don't do these
[1:31:44] things because of that you're true to
[1:31:48] your marriage because of the love that
[1:31:50] binds it's the same exact principle with
[1:31:54] God not do's and don'ts people say well
[1:31:59] I can't do this because imagine the
[1:32:01] message doesn't let me do it don't don't
[1:32:02] blame the message because then if
[1:32:06] there's that if there's that worldly
[1:32:08] desire
[1:32:08] a part of you still needs to die because
[1:32:16] there's some craving there but we live
[1:32:21] so freely well you could go because one
[1:32:26] says all things are expedient all things
[1:32:29] are lawful but not all things are
[1:32:31] expedient all things are lawful
[1:32:34] he says it's lawful for him to drink if
[1:32:38] he wanted to it's lawful for him to
[1:32:41] drink to smoke if you wanted to it's
[1:32:43] lawful for him to do all these things
[1:32:44] but it's not expedient as a Christian so
[1:32:50] we walk a different walk we talk a
[1:32:53] different talk we dress a different
[1:32:56] dress where we behave differently we act
[1:32:59] differently we think differently we
[1:33:01] interact differently we engage
[1:33:02] differently why because no one very few
[1:33:05] people my read the Bible but hundreds of
[1:33:08] people are reading your life the only
[1:33:11] thing that demo by Corinthians is how
[1:33:13] you interpret Corinthians through your
[1:33:15] life the only way there was nobody
[1:33:17] fishes is how you interpret interpret
[1:33:19] Ephesians through your life brother man
[1:33:21] says this he says the devil is not
[1:33:23] concerned about you believing this Bible
[1:33:27] the devil is not concerned about your
[1:33:30] reciting the Bible the devil's not
[1:33:33] concerned about you reading the message
[1:33:35] but the devil is concerned when you live
[1:33:37] the Bible it's one thing that you could
[1:33:42] quote all sixty-six page of the Bible
[1:33:44] but act like a devil when you're out
[1:33:46] there in the world let me tell you say
[1:33:51] stolen by any higher hey man go sing in
[1:33:56] the ire don't praise any higher than the
[1:33:59] ability for you to live this word cuz
[1:34:02] you might fool my brother you might fool
[1:34:04] my sister but you cannot fool God and we
[1:34:13] have trials in our life like I was
[1:34:14] saying before and use everybody now got
[1:34:16] no tries you gotta take take know whose
[1:34:18] side you're on
[1:34:20] because the devil don't got no time
[1:34:22] if you already out there acting like he
[1:34:24] is you're like brothers you not got no
[1:34:29] words well that's because you're on the
[1:34:30] wrong side but the moment you start
[1:34:34] living right
[1:34:35] the moment you start acting right the
[1:34:38] moment you start looking right the
[1:34:40] devil's don't point every gun and he'll
[1:34:42] towards you these are blood jeans I've
[1:34:45] been having trials I've been having
[1:34:47] problems I've been having smokin stands
[1:34:48] where you can set praise be to God
[1:34:50] at least you on the fighting winning
[1:34:52] side every time the Devils will try to
[1:34:58] take a smile away from you he's gonna
[1:35:00] try to take a joy away from you he's
[1:35:01] gonna try to take victory away from you
[1:35:05] because you know all those are promises
[1:35:07] that God has given unto you so these men
[1:35:12] they knew the desire of David they knew
[1:35:17] David's desire and they came together
[1:35:23] and perhaps they looked at the
[1:35:26] circumstance this this was not something
[1:35:30] they've done on the whim the three of
[1:35:34] them probably got together and just say
[1:35:35] they're looking at David that's there at
[1:35:38] the opening of the cave and just
[1:35:39] probably leaning against the side of the
[1:35:41] cave and reflecting as he looked into
[1:35:43] the distance and these men are just
[1:35:44] collecting their thoughts and saying one
[1:35:48] to another it's like our king he wants a
[1:35:54] fresh sip of water from the well and
[1:35:59] Bethlehem and so they began to take
[1:36:03] inventory and they looked at one another
[1:36:06] in the eyes and say who's with me
[1:36:10] because the Bible says upon the
[1:36:12] witnesses of two or three is the word
[1:36:13] established and they looked at one
[1:36:16] another says are you in are you in and
[1:36:18] they each drew out their sword they knew
[1:36:22] it was gonna be a battle because brother
[1:36:24] man says it was 14 miles from where
[1:36:26] they're at to the well and then we're
[1:36:29] gonna fight the enemy for fourteen miles
[1:36:36] 14 miles and no doubt that came together
[1:36:42] in the beginning the kind of perhaps
[1:36:44] maybe put a strategy together maybe the
[1:36:48] reason why it was threes is because
[1:36:49] there were in the shape of a pyramid
[1:36:52] where one could watch each other's back
[1:36:55] and they begins to make that journey
[1:37:00] they didn't tell David probably anything
[1:37:02] they just decided to fulfill David's
[1:37:05] desires and to kind of play on this a
[1:37:09] little bit relevance and so it is today
[1:37:10] the lease of Jesus thought so how about
[1:37:12] his word should be a command to we
[1:37:15] Gentiles who love Him for we know he's
[1:37:17] coming into power no matter how much
[1:37:18] he's rejected heavens and earth will
[1:37:20] pass away but this will still reign just
[1:37:24] the same when all heavens and earth is
[1:37:26] gone and we know he's coming into power
[1:37:28] because nothing will keep it from
[1:37:30] happening this is Christ a revelation of
[1:37:32] him and this is going to happen just the
[1:37:34] way the word says it it is because he's
[1:37:36] the word and the least of this
[1:37:38] commandment no matter how little it is
[1:37:40] if it's to be rebaptised or whatever it
[1:37:43] is we'll do it anyhow
[1:37:44] it's his command and the least of
[1:37:47] David's thoughts was a command to those
[1:37:49] Gentiles for a type of the Gentile
[1:37:51] church today
[1:37:52] Galion men those men stood by David were
[1:37:55] Gentiles but God but gallant man they
[1:37:59] were fearless they didn't know what fear
[1:38:02] was there were such under an anointing
[1:38:08] from David that when David faced Goliath
[1:38:13] and a host of army withdrew themselves
[1:38:17] and they were trying that they were
[1:38:18] puzzled trying to figure out how do we
[1:38:20] attack this this this discord regarding
[1:38:24] of a man called called called Goliath
[1:38:26] what are we going to do David comes
[1:38:29] along as I was wrong with you people he
[1:38:32] exhibited zero fear and they asked him
[1:38:36] well why you like that and this response
[1:38:39] was you know he says look I'm just a
[1:38:41] shepherd boy but I'll tell you one thing
[1:38:43] I watched my sheep real good and when
[1:38:47] the lion came in
[1:38:48] touch one of my sheep I ran after that
[1:38:50] line I wasn't scared and when the bear
[1:38:54] calm came to try to take one of my sheep
[1:38:56] I ran after that bear and I killed that
[1:38:58] bear I have no fear and thank God he's
[1:39:00] no different that devil is no different
[1:39:05] than the devil that's trying to bring
[1:39:06] you down before so David was fearless
[1:39:14] and when Goliath started charging
[1:39:16] towards David remember when Satan
[1:39:19] charges it's an intimidation tactic he
[1:39:23] intentionally throws things at you
[1:39:26] because he expects you to run he expects
[1:39:32] you to pack up your bags and go but that
[1:39:36] but the devil doesn't expect when you
[1:39:38] start running towards him - because I'm
[1:39:44] sore Goliath was charging really fast
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:48] well he had he has probably some pick up
[1:39:51] speed him and they was like well he
[1:39:54] think I'm gonna run so he picked up his
[1:39:56] sling David started running right
[1:40:00] towards Goliath let me say I'm sure
[1:40:03] Goliath fight it's a slow walk a little
[1:40:04] bit
[1:40:05] you gotta catch the devil by surprise
[1:40:08] you gotta let the devil know like
[1:40:09] greater is he that is with you then he
[1:40:12] that is in the world
[1:40:16] David charged right towards life not one
[1:40:19] ounce of fear inhabited him because he
[1:40:22] knew what God had instilled within him
[1:40:26] Goliath was probably running at 80 miles
[1:40:28] an hour than the top - 70 60 50 40 30
[1:40:35] and when David let that walk flew he was
[1:40:38] running at 20 that was a proper the last
[1:40:41] thing you remember
[1:40:47] David was fearless when the lies was
[1:40:51] laying there flat they were like I ain't
[1:40:54] done with this he picked up Goliath
[1:40:56] sword
[1:40:58] never know how to wield it before he's
[1:41:00] like if God started the job God's gonna
[1:41:02] finish the job I gotta make sure that
[1:41:06] that demon is dead just in case that
[1:41:09] prayer didn't do it I'm gonna add a
[1:41:10] little bit fasting to it so he pulled
[1:41:14] out that sword
[1:41:15] this one must have been heavy but David
[1:41:17] knew that he had to finish the job
[1:41:19] the Bible says he that I've begun a good
[1:41:21] work in you will finish it
[1:41:24] they probably went back this way and he
[1:41:27] came flat down blood splattered
[1:41:32] everywhere cuz there's a this you gotta
[1:41:34] get dirty you're in a battle you're not
[1:41:38] gonna look girl you're not always gonna
[1:41:39] look there Sunday's best let me tell you
[1:41:43] when I go through the week and find it
[1:41:44] comes around I don't look like I don't
[1:41:45] look like something's best I've been
[1:41:47] through a battle I love my Fridays David
[1:41:53] picked up the head he is sure he showed
[1:41:56] it to two groups of people he showed it
[1:41:59] to the Philistines this is what my God
[1:42:01] did to your man then he showed it to
[1:42:06] Israel this is what your God did to your
[1:42:09] enemy the Bible says that Jesus has
[1:42:12] triumphant has made openly of public
[1:42:16] sustaining his enemy and his enemies he
[1:42:19] has overcome these things for you and I
[1:42:22] made a show of them openly so David's
[1:42:28] men they were anointed with David
[1:42:33] David's anointing and they begin to make
[1:42:37] that journey now think about this here
[1:42:41] you had it the Philistines you know
[1:42:44] going back to the element of surprise
[1:42:46] the Philistines will probably just
[1:42:48] sitting there you know just you know
[1:42:50] very careless learn about their daily
[1:42:53] duties because you know who's gonna
[1:42:56] really attack them and so in the
[1:42:59] distance from one of them keeping guard
[1:43:01] and in the distance they saw kinda like
[1:43:03] a little dust just kind of flying up and
[1:43:05] this all silhouette of some what appears
[1:43:08] to be a couple of people
[1:43:10] so one guy Bobby looked real good didn't
[1:43:15] know how to react to it right because
[1:43:17] you've never been unexpected attack so
[1:43:21] he's probably looking real good
[1:43:23] he probably is the only one noticing it
[1:43:25] then he looks like hey Bob do you see
[1:43:28] that - Chris y'all see that and those
[1:43:36] men they were running at top speed they
[1:43:38] charge your choice the camp and they're
[1:43:40] looking how many do you think there is I
[1:43:45] don't know I made maybe 300 maybe 400
[1:43:49] 500 maybe don't look that many to me and
[1:43:54] those men were running and that
[1:43:56] silhouette becomes a little bit clearer
[1:43:58] and clearer and clearer and these men
[1:44:03] they're just watching it like well one
[1:44:05] two three one two how many did you count
[1:44:10] Bob cuz the devil don't expect you when
[1:44:17] is when the devil doesn't expect you to
[1:44:19] come to church but here in your car
[1:44:21] you're coming to church the devil
[1:44:24] doesn't expect you to get on your knees
[1:44:25] and pray but here you are just piling
[1:44:27] down people when the devil doesn't
[1:44:30] expect it that's when you gotta do it
[1:44:34] when you least expect it and the
[1:44:37] watching from a distance if they don't
[1:44:41] know whether I pull out the sword of
[1:44:42] what well it's only there's only three
[1:44:44] of them so we show you think we should
[1:44:46] report it then well let's call a couple
[1:44:49] more guys's that's we could easily stop
[1:44:51] this these three men were chased no
[1:44:55] coming straight towards them they
[1:44:57] weren't deviating a little cutting then
[1:44:59] what coming straight towards the promise
[1:45:00] and I can only imagine that their focus
[1:45:03] was only for that promise and was was
[1:45:08] what was repeating in their mind was
[1:45:10] what David said oh if I could have a
[1:45:12] drink from Bethlehem oh if I could have
[1:45:16] a sip of water from Bethlehem
[1:45:19] and those men were charging and next
[1:45:23] thing you know those guys pull out the
[1:45:25] sword did they don't know what to do
[1:45:27] they've never seen this before this like
[1:45:29] this is crazy I mean these guys don't
[1:45:31] have their hair together you gotta catch
[1:45:34] the devil by surprise and next thing you
[1:45:38] know they come running right through the
[1:45:41] garrison they probably take one guy out
[1:45:44] that least expected it didn't take out a
[1:45:46] sword fast enough and they start
[1:45:49] penetrating their way through 14 miles
[1:45:52] of Philistines and they're probably
[1:45:57] spinning around watching each other's
[1:46:01] back supporting each other and if one of
[1:46:06] them goes down the other two are there
[1:46:08] to pick them up because they're in the
[1:46:10] battle together they came in it together
[1:46:14] they could have come out of it together
[1:46:16] so they fought the way they fought the
[1:46:19] way and here they are they're spinning
[1:46:21] around it's probably chaos that's what
[1:46:23] the Bible talks about that don't look at
[1:46:24] the Battle of the Warriors with much
[1:46:26] blood and confusion that's what the
[1:46:27] Bible says in Isaiah and so they're
[1:46:29] spinning around and the fighting in
[1:46:30] blood ends is mingled and in this man
[1:46:33] it's a mess but their only purpose is to
[1:46:38] get to that well and they're watching
[1:46:41] each other's back these gallant men and
[1:46:46] the only thing that they could think of
[1:46:47] in the middle of the battle is a verse a
[1:46:50] scripture that saying of their King I
[1:46:54] don't know when a conversation I'll go
[1:46:56] well with my boss and I I got to think
[1:46:57] of a verse I need a scripture I started
[1:47:02] hemming a song yeah but I know that
[1:47:06] every conversation goes well in the job
[1:47:07] but I need something to sustain me
[1:47:10] something to say your son of God you're
[1:47:13] big you're bigger than the conversation
[1:47:14] that you just had when people look at
[1:47:18] you funny when people say they might say
[1:47:21] something like it's the tone that they
[1:47:23] say it they know the devil knows how to
[1:47:27] get under your skin remember when when
[1:47:29] when when when Pharaoh went after Israel
[1:47:31] the Bible says he appointed
[1:47:33] shariats to go after them so there were
[1:47:35] demons that were appointed to go after
[1:47:38] certain group of people the devil knows
[1:47:42] exactly your weakness each of you still
[1:47:48] say Amen but we're gonna get to it each
[1:47:49] of you have your own secret demons that
[1:47:53] you fight your wife don't know your
[1:47:58] husband don't know your children don't
[1:48:01] know the parents don't know now by
[1:48:06] getting quiet I still say that all of us
[1:48:11] have some demons you might as well ask
[1:48:14] why I'm not quick to criticize a brother
[1:48:16] how come he can't overcome this
[1:48:18] meanwhile you got a telephone pole in
[1:48:19] your eyes how come she won't overcome
[1:48:25] that you got at your battles that you
[1:48:27] got a war through did we say praise the
[1:48:32] Lord
[1:48:32] we each have own demons that pic that
[1:48:35] keeps taunting us Paul had that he says
[1:48:39] he it was a it was the way I phrase I
[1:48:42] mean I praise the great it was the thing
[1:48:44] that always professed him it was a
[1:48:45] weakness that he had and he had to
[1:48:47] consult God constantly for it that's the
[1:48:51] reason why we need to pray one for the
[1:48:53] other encourage one another uplift one
[1:48:59] another
[1:49:00] edify one another and if you can't say
[1:49:03] nothing at all then be quiet and just
[1:49:05] spray can we say praise the Lord so
[1:49:12] these three men I Miguel for that a
[1:49:13] little bit so these three men they were
[1:49:15] warring their way through the garrison
[1:49:18] of the Philistines and can you just
[1:49:22] imagine now here's the thing they didn't
[1:49:25] fight the same Philistine again cuz once
[1:49:31] they kill one that was it
[1:49:32] you don't always fight the same demon
[1:49:34] once you deal with that and God
[1:49:35] overcomes in your life you got another
[1:49:37] one that said that you got to fight so
[1:49:39] he's Faso they they they work their way
[1:49:41] through and they get to the well and I'm
[1:49:45] sure to talk through this for me why the
[1:49:47] first
[1:49:47] probably still making their way two of
[1:49:49] them are probably fighting while the
[1:49:51] other one is grabbing a picture of water
[1:49:54] and then when one gets tired they switch
[1:49:58] when you can't go no more I'm gonna
[1:50:00] continue to pray for you
[1:50:02] because there's gonna be a time where I
[1:50:03] can't go no more I want you to pray for
[1:50:05] me
[1:50:08] download the story about the Eagles when
[1:50:10] they mope yeah so when the Eagles are
[1:50:12] moping in if they're in the low period
[1:50:14] and they're just stirred their distress
[1:50:16] and they're there they're sad and
[1:50:18] they're depressed in these Eagles they
[1:50:21] come around and they drop morsels of
[1:50:23] food into the valley of this of these
[1:50:25] Eagles that's moping and trying to give
[1:50:28] them strength
[1:50:29] so I way they could nourish themselves
[1:50:30] on way that could become stronger and
[1:50:32] those Eagles that that's moping and
[1:50:34] that's in depression they give the
[1:50:35] little morsel food and they eat and
[1:50:37] those Eagles that's flying around they
[1:50:39] keep dropping down and they drop a
[1:50:41] morsel food you know why those Eagles do
[1:50:43] that because that was once them that was
[1:50:45] in the valley at one time and there were
[1:50:48] other Eagles that came by and dropped
[1:50:50] muscles of food to encourage them in the
[1:50:52] battle your victories sometimes are not
[1:50:59] because of you you may barely pray one
[1:51:02] minute a prayer a week and meanwhile the
[1:51:05] sister the brother that doesn't say a
[1:51:07] thing in church that's quiet in there
[1:51:09] but in the home the prayer warriors and
[1:51:12] the praying for you and the victory that
[1:51:14] you experience is because of their
[1:51:16] prayers and you're walking around with
[1:51:20] your chest all puffed up saying I made
[1:51:22] it through the week it's not because of
[1:51:24] you but because of a prayer warrior they
[1:51:28] may not say one word they may not shout
[1:51:30] them and ice cream they may not you know
[1:51:32] holler but when they're in that closet
[1:51:34] throughout the week they say Lord keep
[1:51:36] the church strong keep my pastor strong
[1:51:38] keep the saints of God strong watch and
[1:51:40] protect them I remember this prayer I
[1:51:43] remember this cry and it's because of
[1:51:45] that humble prayer that's how you were
[1:51:47] able to get it through the week
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:55] so they get to the the well and their
[1:52:00] warring off the enemy the battle shifts
[1:52:04] the battle shifts because it was one
[1:52:07] aspect to make the journey to go get
[1:52:13] water that was one piece of it and they
[1:52:18] had to fight the way through had to
[1:52:24] fight the way through now they had to go
[1:52:28] back home that's that's what we're at
[1:52:33] now
[1:52:34] we're going back home so they realize
[1:52:40] that when they got the order if they
[1:52:46] didn't return back with the water then
[1:52:48] everything would have been in vain it
[1:52:52] wouldn't have been worth it
[1:52:54] so they had to protect the source of
[1:52:58] life are we staying together perhaps
[1:53:05] maybe in the journey they could be
[1:53:06] careless with how they fought they could
[1:53:09] swing the sword and they can say
[1:53:11] anything and you're gonna go to hell
[1:53:13] Lord is that the other and they may be
[1:53:15] they may not have been using some wisdom
[1:53:18] because all they need they need to get
[1:53:20] to that source cuz I was like that was a
[1:53:24] young Christian where I condemned
[1:53:25] everybody to hell well I was just loose
[1:53:28] off the tongue boy I was and you don't
[1:53:31] want to come across me I preach that
[1:53:34] word as piercing as I can no wisdom but
[1:53:40] now I've received eternal life I
[1:53:43] received a baptism I now carry life so I
[1:53:52] realize it's much bigger than just me
[1:53:55] now it's about that life
[1:53:58] it's about protecting that water so when
[1:54:03] they got the water the only the only
[1:54:07] inspiration the only focus was to make
[1:54:11] it back to David and they knew that they
[1:54:15] were through 14 miles of pure battle
[1:54:21] wars they got the wounds and the scars
[1:54:24] to show it and now they got to go back
[1:54:27] through that same journey straight and
[1:54:32] narrows the way and few there be that
[1:54:34] find it
[1:54:35] so they looked at one another perhaps
[1:54:38] and then they recalled amongst
[1:54:41] themselves remember what we talked about
[1:54:44] if you fall we're gonna continue if you
[1:54:50] follow you continue because we're all in
[1:54:53] this together the sole objective is to
[1:54:56] bring that life back but we're gonna
[1:55:00] stay in this together so they picked up
[1:55:05] the water and they realized that this is
[1:55:09] serious now and this was not about them
[1:55:14] this is not about you per se it's about
[1:55:18] the life that you carry that's what this
[1:55:22] is all about from the very beginning not
[1:55:26] going to walk you through this from the
[1:55:27] very beginning Saints been jealous of
[1:55:29] the life that God has given to you so
[1:55:36] these men they grab the bucket and the
[1:55:43] only thing that's probably replaying in
[1:55:45] their mind in the midst of the battle
[1:55:47] was what David says oh if I could have a
[1:55:51] drink from the water from the well of
[1:55:55] Bethlehem that was their inspiration so
[1:56:01] when things get difficult for you what
[1:56:05] do you draw from
[1:56:09] would you pull into your remembrance
[1:56:12] what scripture comes to mind what verse
[1:56:18] opens up what quote awakens you
[1:56:25] something has to be a motivation for you
[1:56:29] that's why I love that something because
[1:56:31] he lives I can face tomorrow
[1:56:34] Belgrad talks about how that every
[1:56:36] religion could port can point towards a
[1:56:39] tune where their founder lays from Hindu
[1:56:42] to to Muslim soup you name it but
[1:56:45] Christianity we could point to an empty
[1:56:49] tomb that proves that our Savior lives
[1:56:54] and because he lives I can face tomorrow
[1:56:58] I can make it through today and they
[1:57:06] took that bucket of water and with that
[1:57:09] same inspiration that same gumption that
[1:57:14] same desire that same strength that's
[1:57:19] there that's word that was that's the
[1:57:21] type of Caleb who says look I've been in
[1:57:24] this battle for 80 years Moses made me a
[1:57:27] promise he says that I'm supposed to
[1:57:29] have this piece of the mountain he just
[1:57:31] give me my mountain he says I'm just as
[1:57:34] strong now as I was back then I don't
[1:57:39] know if we have five years I don't know
[1:57:42] if we have ten years it could be
[1:57:44] tomorrow but I want to have a strength
[1:57:47] that's so resounding then I will got to
[1:57:50] go when he looks at me that he sees that
[1:57:52] there's a son who is committed to this
[1:57:54] word all the way to the end in the
[1:58:01] changing world so these men begin to
[1:58:06] work the way back to David they were
[1:58:10] going back home they came empty handed
[1:58:13] sometimes you come to church just empty
[1:58:16] but you're gonna leave for
[1:58:19] and that's why the devil doesn't want
[1:58:22] you to come to church because he's
[1:58:24] afraid that you're gonna hear something
[1:58:25] that might change your life
[1:58:28] you're gonna react to something that
[1:58:30] might cause you to say Amen you're gonna
[1:58:33] agree to something that he doesn't like
[1:58:35] I'm why he doesn't want you to come to
[1:58:37] church you're gonna dance like you've
[1:58:39] never danced before
[1:58:40] leave the shout like you've never
[1:58:42] shouted before David was Hakeem but when
[1:58:46] he saw the aren't returning he was
[1:58:48] outside dancing in his pajamas he didn't
[1:58:50] care who was looking he saw the promise
[1:58:53] coming back home I don't care who's
[1:58:58] looking I want to serve God so these men
[1:59:04] they Ward their way back to David in the
[1:59:10] same paddle the same war program says
[1:59:14] this he says in the least and I'll wipe
[1:59:18] out pretty quickly and the least of
[1:59:20] David's thoughts was a command to those
[1:59:21] Gentiles a type of the church they
[1:59:23] gallant man those men who stood by David
[1:59:25] with Gentiles but gallant they were
[1:59:27] fearless they didn't know what fear was
[1:59:28] one then took a sword and killed 800 men
[1:59:32] and armed and them all around him what a
[1:59:35] man that was there was an Egyptian
[1:59:37] warrior run up a long spirit he only had
[1:59:39] a stick in his hand he took the stick
[1:59:41] and locked the spear out of his and took
[1:59:43] the spirit killed him himself
[1:59:45] one of the Giants had 14-inch fingers
[1:59:47] like that your fingers just as long as
[1:59:49] sure your hand closed opened them open
[1:59:52] that up that would be 28 inches and he
[1:59:55] jumped right in there and killed him see
[1:59:57] he was a gallant man the gents are
[1:59:59] looking upon anointed a gents are
[2:00:01] looking upon anointed one that he knowed
[2:00:03] was coming into power and did you notice
[2:00:07] them being so gallant to David when
[2:00:10] David finally came in power he made them
[2:00:12] rulers over cities then jesus promised
[2:00:14] the same thing the same thing make them
[2:00:17] rulers then and there and when David's
[2:00:19] desire was to have a fresh drink he
[2:00:21] probably had some old warm stagnant
[2:00:23] water up there he was drinking but he
[2:00:25] happened to drink of that fresh water
[2:00:27] down there at Bethlehem the house of
[2:00:29] God's bread and he said if I only
[2:00:31] a drink from that well and those men
[2:00:33] pulled their sword and fought 40 miles
[2:00:36] of Philistines not because he asked him
[2:00:38] to but because they know he wanted it
[2:00:46] how many times have you done something
[2:00:48] because somebody would have been blessed
[2:00:50] by it how many times you've done
[2:00:54] something because God would have honored
[2:00:56] it I think I used the story before it's
[2:01:03] just you know I have these examples that
[2:01:04] just I keep going back to when I worked
[2:01:07] for the bank I was really hungry so I
[2:01:09] went to I went I had a lunch break so I
[2:01:13] had about ten dollars in my pocket and
[2:01:17] there was a Chinese restaurant down the
[2:01:19] street so I went down down there to the
[2:01:22] Chinese restaurant because I was
[2:01:23] thinking about our chicken Romanian or
[2:01:25] fried chicken fry rice or egg rolls I
[2:01:27] was really hungry and I went down there
[2:01:30] and it was a packed place - it's a small
[2:01:32] little place but it was packed people
[2:01:34] lined up so I'm in line and I'm just
[2:01:36] waiting the only thing I could think of
[2:01:37] was just eating a good lunch so I get up
[2:01:40] to the ticket counter
[2:01:41] I put in my order and man I was excited
[2:01:46] so the lanes like well you're it's about
[2:01:48] eight dollars and so so change they're
[2:01:50] like okay so I give up my ten dollars my
[2:01:51] last ten dollars for that week and it's
[2:01:54] hard to part ways with money because if
[2:01:55] my money cannot talk the only thing
[2:01:56] whatever says goodbye so I gave up I
[2:02:00] gave her ten dollars and she looked away
[2:02:03] for a moment to call it into order and
[2:02:07] that she's doing that she's pulled out a
[2:02:10] $20 bill and it slowly makes its way
[2:02:13] towards me in that moment when
[2:02:17] everything was going so fast everything
[2:02:19] froze and that $20 bill was coming
[2:02:26] towards me just as slow as possible a
[2:02:30] lot of thoughts went through my mind my
[2:02:32] pastor wasn't there the deacon wasn't
[2:02:37] there I was there by myself
[2:02:40] no one would have known a thing and if I
[2:02:43] looked through it carefully the face of
[2:02:45] the dollar winked at me
[2:02:49] that $20.00 sale or any other devil star
[2:02:53] puts thoughts into your head I said what
[2:02:54] praise be to God I gave ten dollars and
[2:02:59] I'm getting double the blessing back
[2:03:02] the Bible says walls and them that call
[2:03:05] evil good and good evil there was no one
[2:03:10] to rebuke me no one to preach to me no
[2:03:13] one is saying that me it's just me God
[2:03:16] in the devil now what some of you would
[2:03:20] it does that money make that one ounce
[2:03:24] means way towards me and I couldn't it's
[2:03:26] like I just I couldn't move I couldn't
[2:03:28] help myself
[2:03:29] my hand was following the same rhythm
[2:03:34] and voices we're talking to my ear so
[2:03:38] they say you're a son of God you have to
[2:03:41] have a testimony you have to be greater
[2:03:44] than that it may sound cheesy to the
[2:03:46] world but that's what that's the
[2:03:48] principles that I stand on and the devil
[2:03:53] is still working with you soldier like I
[2:03:54] whispered something because I want to
[2:03:58] justify my son what she didn't hear me
[2:04:02] you can't fool God and you care for the
[2:04:05] devil and I knew that she didn't hear me
[2:04:09] cuz she's been back there calling out
[2:04:11] something and she's exchanging and that
[2:04:14] was distracted and stuff for me and that
[2:04:16] twenty dollar bill we're having a
[2:04:17] conversation and I'm trying to get her
[2:04:20] attention so I I projected my voice a
[2:04:22] little bit louder excuse me it didn't
[2:04:27] work if something says that's not good
[2:04:29] enough
[2:04:31] finally I mustered enough courtesy ma'am
[2:04:35] she spun around I'm like you giving me
[2:04:39] too much pain they're giving me too much
[2:04:43] change back she looked stunned surprised
[2:04:53] that people still exercise honesty
[2:04:57] integrity these are basic virtues basic
[2:05:02] principles that's what word that's what
[2:05:06] we're Bob that's what the bride is
[2:05:08] because I could have taken that $20
[2:05:11] she could have win him try to balance
[2:05:14] her register it would have been off ten
[2:05:16] bucks they would have looked to her she
[2:05:19] could have been on one notice away from
[2:05:21] being fired that could have been it she
[2:05:23] could have been a single mom you see the
[2:05:25] trickling effect now she's without a job
[2:05:27] all this happened because of a decision
[2:05:30] that you made because you see it in that
[2:05:35] moment but not realizing the cascading
[2:05:37] effect so you gotta be mindful of your
[2:05:43] actions when you're by yourself doing
[2:05:46] God's will when the pastor's not there
[2:05:51] saying no no no when the Deacons not
[2:05:54] they're saying you know better cuz God's
[2:05:57] there watching you the Devils they're
[2:05:59] watching you and you're conscious bears
[2:06:02] witness so finally and I'll wrap up with
[2:06:09] this they get back and here they are
[2:06:13] they get to David
[2:06:15] they're probably tired out of breath and
[2:06:19] they take that bucket and they they they
[2:06:23] offer it to David and so we got you some
[2:06:27] water from the well of Bethlehem
[2:06:32] can you move God's so much like that
[2:06:35] that David took a step back and
[2:06:38] recognize the sacrifice of those men and
[2:06:42] he said be it far from me O Lord that I
[2:06:44] should do this is this not the blood of
[2:06:47] the man that went in jeopardy of their
[2:06:50] lives no doubt they have battle wounds
[2:06:54] and scars but yet the desire to fulfill
[2:06:59] David's desires was far greater than
[2:07:01] that and David took the water
[2:07:06] he poured as a drink offering unto the
[2:07:08] Lord because he could not find himself
[2:07:11] worthy to drink that water let's all
[2:07:14] stand so I feel as I read this last
[2:07:15] quote well Gramps is this and father
[2:07:22] while we're here in this battle of life
[2:07:26] let us be strong and courageous knowing
[2:07:32] that just across the water
[2:07:34] yonder lays eternal life and help us to
[2:07:39] come at that day as great warriors with
[2:07:43] battle scars all over us showing the
[2:07:48] results of a battle you're gonna make it
[2:07:54] to the other side with trials that
[2:07:58] you've gone through circumstances you
[2:08:00] will endure situations you encounter
[2:08:04] it's testing time and let me tell you
[2:08:07] things as you close out this year and
[2:08:10] whatever format you do next year is
[2:08:13] gonna be even harder than this year
[2:08:15] every day is harder than the previous
[2:08:18] day every week every month saying
[2:08:23] there's a great marketing scheme he's a
[2:08:27] great market here he knows how to market
[2:08:29] to you he knows how to appeal to your
[2:08:31] taste buds your interests and things
[2:08:34] that distract you that's the reason why
[2:08:37] we're coming to a time when we gotta be
[2:08:40] completely sold out to this word that
[2:08:45] you can't wait for the church doors to
[2:08:46] open to come in and to come and just
[2:08:48] rejoice you may not feel like it but you
[2:08:50] gotta show the devil whose side you are
[2:08:53] on
[2:08:53] you may not feel like reading the
[2:08:56] scripture you gotta show the devil whose
[2:08:58] side you want the Bible says I'm not
[2:09:00] gonna prolong you the Bible says redeem
[2:09:02] the time for the day's evil redeem the
[2:09:05] time one example of that just for me it
[2:09:07] takes me about 30 minutes to drive to
[2:09:10] work 30 to 45 minutes prior to that I
[2:09:13] used to listen to the radio not used to
[2:09:16] listen to the news station and and then
[2:09:18] I find that I feel
[2:09:19] myself in the morning being bombarded
[2:09:21] with chaos across the country and this
[2:09:24] happening and this happening then that
[2:09:27] doesn't set the right tone for the day
[2:09:28] for me especially after I've offered a
[2:09:31] few words of Prayer I get in my car and
[2:09:33] I listen to the news radio and then I'm
[2:09:35] driving I'm hearing that a bombing took
[2:09:37] place in and in this country and and
[2:09:39] this happened and and this happened and
[2:09:41] this happened by this time you know you
[2:09:44] started your morning with well intent
[2:09:45] and and now you you're you're you're
[2:09:48] you're taking that purification of where
[2:09:50] you're you're bombarding it with all
[2:09:51] kinds of information that's not helpful
[2:09:54] or beneficial so I started to listen to
[2:09:58] the words of the Prophet so I'll plug my
[2:10:04] earphones on got my phone right here and
[2:10:08] I'm listening to the message takes me 40
[2:10:10] minutes every day one one trip 40
[2:10:15] minutes of another trip 40 minutes back
[2:10:16] so how long is that an hour in 20
[2:10:19] minutes I'm listening to message I start
[2:10:24] my day strong because spirits are all
[2:10:28] around you I'm redeeming the time so I'm
[2:10:32] feeding myself I could tell you I mean
[2:10:34] it's just there's just I've been doing
[2:10:36] this for the last year now and just a
[2:10:38] host of messages I've been able to go
[2:10:40] back and relisted to and once I haven't
[2:10:43] listened to before because I've been
[2:10:44] redeeming the time maximizing the time
[2:10:46] most of your time you're spent in your
[2:10:49] car what are you listening to how you're
[2:10:53] maximizing it and sometimes if you if
[2:10:57] you hardly read a scripture you know I'm
[2:11:00] not trying I'm just attacking the
[2:11:01] spirits things you may be already doing
[2:11:03] this if you hardly read the Bible read
[2:11:05] the message no wonder when you come to
[2:11:06] church you sit there confused when the
[2:11:08] pastor's reading it's just preaching at
[2:11:10] you and he's quoting things even though
[2:11:12] he may not be saying brother BAM said
[2:11:13] he's taking it from what brother
[2:11:14] Bromstad and you're looking at I'm kind
[2:11:16] of puzzled or you're you're not fighting
[2:11:21] anything but if you could lay the seed
[2:11:25] in you you may not know what it means
[2:11:29] the Prophet would say something and drop
[2:11:31] some lines like I don't know what that
[2:11:33] I believe it anyway but I'm just gonna
[2:11:35] keep on and hear a visiting minister or
[2:11:38] the pastor himself could stand behind
[2:11:39] the pulpit and he begins to preach the
[2:11:42] word and he goes off the beaten path on
[2:11:46] his notes and now he's ministering
[2:11:48] personally to you the see that's already
[2:11:52] laying there and he begins to say
[2:11:56] something that for everyone else that
[2:11:59] didn't have that experience like you did
[2:12:01] it's meaningless but for you you're
[2:12:03] nearly getting ready to do backflips
[2:12:05] because God is speaking directly to you
[2:12:08] and what you didn't understand becomes a
[2:12:12] revelation for you your eyes begin to
[2:12:16] open up there's such joy that's all that
[2:12:19] that's that's unspeakable that you begin
[2:12:22] to experience because God speaking
[2:12:25] directly to you because you took the
[2:12:31] opportunity to store up food so I
[2:12:36] encourage you during the course of the
[2:12:38] week store up food read a message listen
[2:12:43] to it there during the year before they
[2:12:49] have this the Bible of audio where it's
[2:12:53] kind of it's a dramatic version of it
[2:12:55] where it's in keychains but they they
[2:12:57] dramatize it spent the whole year read
[2:13:00] listen to the whole Bible from Genesis
[2:13:02] to Revelation and when I got home I go
[2:13:04] back and like how Wow I go back and I go
[2:13:07] back and I read certain things that I
[2:13:08] listen to on the drive to work or from
[2:13:10] work I'm like oh man that's really stuck
[2:13:12] stood out I'm trying to redeem the time
[2:13:16] because if you don't redeem the time the
[2:13:19] devil will fill it in for you now I
[2:13:23] don't know why I threw that at the last
[2:13:24] minute but I want to encourage y'all
[2:13:27] because the days are drawing nearer and
[2:13:30] nearer the battle is becoming more and
[2:13:33] more difficult people are falling Saints
[2:13:38] are falling to the left into the right
[2:13:40] the Bible says there will be an hour of
[2:13:42] shaking and anything that could be
[2:13:44] shaken will be shaken but if
[2:13:46] you have a foundation that you're
[2:13:49] standing on then you can't be shaken
[2:13:53] Amen let's just bow hearts we're turning
[2:13:55] back over to you soldiers that's about
[2:13:57] hearts Heavenly Father it's been a while
[2:14:01] since I've gone down this path like this
[2:14:04] just to really exhort that way dear Lord
[2:14:06] but I just felt really strong in my
[2:14:08] spirit just to call out some things and
[2:14:10] just to press it upon the people here
[2:14:13] the Lord how late the hour is and how
[2:14:15] important it is just to be in tune with
[2:14:16] your word father the Lord as your
[2:14:20] prophet said and the message that I've
[2:14:22] been listening to this week he says it's
[2:14:24] the reason why he preached so hard is
[2:14:26] because he loves the people and he used
[2:14:29] the example saying that if any of them
[2:14:31] were to see him driving really fast and
[2:14:33] there was a sharp bend someone would
[2:14:35] call out be careful not for his own
[2:14:38] detriment but because they love him and
[2:14:40] that's what he's been doing is preaching
[2:14:42] out so strong just because he knows that
[2:14:44] the hour is late and that there's a call
[2:14:49] there Lord for us to be careful to pick
[2:14:53] up this word and to meditate upon a day
[2:14:55] and night to feast upon it father bless
[2:14:59] your people here no doubt the Lord the
[2:15:02] same anointing that David's men
[2:15:04] experienced this is the same anointing
[2:15:06] that your bride experienced a fearless
[2:15:09] anointing that they could confront the
[2:15:12] wiles of the devil and know that you
[2:15:14] stand with them that no matter what bad
[2:15:17] news may come their way our God is far
[2:15:20] greater bless everyone here the Lord
[2:15:24] bless their sacrifice perhaps I've taken
[2:15:27] an extra minute or two the Lord but
[2:15:30] father I just wanted to just expound the
[2:15:31] word in a way that they could receive it
[2:15:34] bless your people now bless the pastor
[2:15:37] here who's loyal faithful remember him
[2:15:41] and his family father the Lord am i
[2:15:44] broken up ways to try to bring this
[2:15:46] forward if there's anything that I may
[2:15:47] have fallen short of the Lord
[2:15:49] may you connect the dots for your people
[2:15:51] may you bring that revelation of that
[2:15:52] word to them bless your people now and
[2:15:56] Jesus Christ then we pray god bless you
