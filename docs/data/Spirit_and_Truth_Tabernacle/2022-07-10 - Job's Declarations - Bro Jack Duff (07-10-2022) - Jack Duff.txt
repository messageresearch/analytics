thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after rain amen look like he's losing his eyesight in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble tremble and the strong men shall bow down themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out the windows be dark so not only is he blind he's losing his teeth adria said man amen and the door shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up and the voice of the bird and all the daughters of music shall be brought low now he's losing his hearing also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and the fear shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and the desire shall fail because man goes to his long home and the mourners come about the streets forever or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the picture be broken at the fountain then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return to unto god who gave it vanity of vanity saith the preacher all is vanity in verse 13

spirit and truth 2.0 uh but we we just enjoyed ourselves there at uh at the restaurant and uh just just wonderful wonderful fellowship there so god bless you and i know uh brother simba and sister ruth announced some of the new things that we're doing for our youth and one of the things that happened my um i was i recently traveled out to canada and i spoke that sunday morning at services then on sunday afternoon the pastor wanted me to speak to the young people and uh so you know they had i mean they got a nice church i was just sitting there you know you don't want to be um covetous but uh i'm like lord if you can do this for them and you know what they told me to testify there was a buddhist temple and um and and the buddhists you know church that was there they wanted to put up a bigger buddha they wanted a big buddha you know statue that that they wanted to put on the property and the the township said no y'all can't put that big buddha up on that property you're gonna have to buy other property put a big buddha up so they say well we'll buy other property and the church came up for sale and these brothers bought it and went in there and redid everything and they got a main sanctuary then another sanctuary just for the young people i say lord jesus yes lord so uh you know we we went to that that's that sanctuary and i did the little you know devotion with the young people and i really enjoyed it and they just hit me and said if i'm doing this out here in canada i need to be doing this back at home and um so you know i was just kind of talking some things over my wife and then i had to uh take my car to the shop to be repaired my daughter picked me up and when she got in the car she started talking i said when i got in the car she started saying daddy you know we need to do them youth devotions like you used to do that really helped helped us when we were young people so you just confirmed what i just told your mama i said can we go so we're going to do it and um so we were setting this up amen i used to get with the younger ones teenagers and things that nature young adults and we would just sit down and talk about different things and uh so i'm gonna make myself available uh to our young people that's in this uh season and uh so we're we're getting these things started i mentioned brother uh uh simba and sister ruth that just in my heart so we got something on calendar and we're gonna make it happen and i'm just trusting all of our young people to be able to get involved uh in in these things that we're trying to do i think it'll be a big encouragement a man a big strength uh to you especially as you're going through uh the school year i think it'll be a big help to you so just join us on that y'all heard these things one of the other announcements that i didn't see up there uh or didn't hear there is another men's meeting that's going to be happening uh september 23rd through 24th uh in tennessee brother brother barry is going to be doing that again last year me brother marquise and brother josue went and uh you know if we had some other brothers that would like to go this year i think it'd be a real blessing but they're gonna be doing that and they asked me to be a speaker again this year so uh just keep us in prayer and uh i always tell brother bears you know you know brother when you do this you do this this is a really bad weekend for me it's one of the probably one of the worst weekends of the year and i said it's because it's the weekend of my wife's birthday brother and you're asking me to to leave home and and come and to brother you're going to get me in trouble you know i and i said i i'ma pray about it but i also have to get permission [Laughter] i'ma just be honest brother i'm praying that god will touch my heart so so i told i told about it she said okay this year you can go but next year just might as well tell brother barry no no no next year big year amen next year my wife and i will be celebrating 30 years of marriage amen and praise the lord glory to god and um and next year should be celebrating her 50th birthday so next year we're gonna have some big plans amen and i'm letting everybody know ahead of time we taking ourselves a big trip we're gonna be going for a lot of days a lot of things and and i have to say she deserve it uh sister jamima asked us a question last night you know and and uh she's like well where did y'all go for y'all honeymoon she wanted to know where all the brothers went for the honeymoon where y'all took your wife y'all honeymoon [Music] uh we we went to a city called avon park like what we know where it was either but it was close to disney world and it was a only place they had available at that time my parents had a time share and they gave us that timeshare for a week and it was in avon park florida so one day y'all gonna be driving and y'all gonna go right through avon park this way y'all can get that's exactly where we were that's the way things was but now 30 years later i think i can take a little bit beyond avon park [Applause] so my wife done already she said if she had to do it all over again and we had a a place that she could go for a honeymoon and she said she want to go to greece so i say praise the lord we're going to try to make that happen amen we're going to make it happen so uh i don't know when i don't know uh what the dates are but next year it will happen amen and uh by the grace of god we're gonna make it happen so we're looking forward to that uh all right um i don't think i got anything else that i need to make mention of i think i think i got it all uh yeah i i heard uh we had a couple little situations sister um melissa wasn't feeling well and i said we want to pray for her brother jerry text early say i don't think i'm gonna make a disservice because uh my wife's not feeling well i'm gonna stay stay home but then they text back say i'm on my way i'm gonna be late and then i got a call we were in prayer and i got this my phone started ringing while i'm praying like my people know i'm praying i looked down and said brother smile listen i know you wouldn't call me like this i stepped outside say pastor brother jack i ain't gonna make it today i said what did he say last night we left the fellowship with the couples and we got an accident on our way home he said i think i hit like a a wolf or something i said i said i said why i said hit my car and i just all kind of damaged and i made it home and i said i come on this morning but as i got to indian town again it just seemed like the car wasn't acting right they say so i'm gonna have to turn around and go back and then he texts me back and say i'm gonna be late but i'm gonna be there say so we just expect them to come at any any moment now and we we thank god for just the press amen the saints pressing through um the circumstances and as we were teaching amen out of the book of ephesians you got to be able to live above your circumstances and man don't allow the enemy to get victory in some of these areas in your life so i thank god for the press and i believe there's a blessing in pressing amen so we want to remember these things in prayer uh i will read a scripture here amen and we'll get into the word of god musicians thank you all so much we really really appreciate you all amen god bless you uh amen and uh certainly thank the lord for uh all the specials that went for so if you could just stand with me we'll read two passages of scripture amen and then we will move on in our thought here for today i want to read from the book of job chapter 9 my brother solomon was reading out of ecclesiastes and i think he started quoting a little bit out of job and while he was praying there i'm like lord look at that confirmation amen coming right through the song service there so appreciate that this this little thought that i'm gonna have i'm i'm i'm gonna say it like this i'm kind of stepping in some uh uncharted territory uh but i heard brother eugene braun earlier this week just kind of shared a little something it was strange i wasn't even on the call but brother clinton's brother a man called me says did you hear uh them talk about this on something i'm like no i want them to call i didn't hear so i went back and listened to the recording and they said that that that word that word that he spoke that just really got me stirred up i said well let me go look at this word and when i looked at that word i said yeah that got me stirred up too brother and uh so the lord just kind of led us down a certain path and and uh but this thought is is driven from something that brother eugene braun was bringing to our attention on our early morning call uh there starting studying the book of revelation so here um this is job chapter 9 verse 1 says then job answered and said i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and have prospered who hath hardened himself against him and have prospered right yeah that's impossible you don't harden yourself against god and think you're going to prosper right who would hurt yourself against him and hath prospered which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger uh which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof tremble which commandeth the sun and it riseth not um rises not and seals up the stars which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea which maketh arcturus orion pleiades and the chambers of the south amen which doeth great things past finding out yay and wonders without number amen turn with me to revelation 8. and verse 1 praise the lord revelation 8 and verse 1 and it says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen let's pray lord jesus we are grateful for the uh privilege we have to be able to read the word of god but we know it takes the holy spirit to reveal to us what it is that we've actually read we pray that the spirit of god would come now lord and just open up our understanding and well not that it would just be head knowledge but lord it be something that would draw our hearts closer to you uh we actually take control over this portion of the service we want to thank you for touching sister capers and allowing her to be back in the house of god we want to remember sister melissa that you would touch her god this morning and that you would let her come back into the house also lord uh thank you for watching over brother smiley and sister smiling last night as they were on the way home it could have been much worse than what it was but god you kept them and we thank you for that uh father we just asked that you would just bless amen uh all uh that would happen lord in the remainder of this service and just ask that you get all the glory all the honor and all the praises in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen uh also i i forgot to announce um i know that we are um our uh both sister brown and sister virginia trying to make sure that sister capers family is is welcomed a man while their sister sister wayson's family is welcome amen while they're here and i know that on tomorrow night uh sis virginia wanted to just invite all the saints whoever would want to come she's going to host a dinner at her house a man for sister wayson's family and we thank god for that so anyone that would like to come and be a part of that free food amen uh you can you can come to sister uh virginia's is it seven o'clock yes seven o'clock and if you need the address just please see sister uh virginia praise the lord amen amen colin greens and cornbread spaghetti spit all right praise the lord amen amen but we thank the lord so if you don't have anything to do um tomorrow night amen uh the the invitation is there and everybody is welcome amen praise the lord so um i want to just take for a uh thought today job's declarations amen uh job's declarations just start our thought here from this quote out of the greatest battle ever fault the goss prophet makes this statement says i said but you know brother wood according to science in that dipper the little dipper the big dipper those stars don't look over about two inches apart and they are farther away from each other than we are from them amen it says if they would uh start to this earth it would take a thousand miles an hour it would take hundreds and hundreds of years for them to reach the earth amen and i said in all this great vast system here and yet they tell us that they look through glasses can see a hundred and twenty million years of light time way out in there and they're still moons and stars and yet god made every one of them and he sets in the midst of them now watch this he says it said i said i said somewhere in there i had pointed out to me one time in an observatory the zodiac it says beginning with the virgin coming over through the cancer age and on down until the last was the lion leo the lion he says the first coming of christ that's the virgin all right uh by the virgin the second coming by the lion of the tribe of judah and i said i've tried my best to see that zodiac and i can't see it it says but yet is there oh my i just love this i love this amen uh it it it will just go further than this but he said he says i tried like looking in the observatory he said they look up at them stars and they're trying to look at the zodiac amen and he says he tried to see it but he just couldn't this is what the prophet said he says he says i tried to see it but i can't see it but yet it's there and it says those who are trained know it's there those who are trained they know it's there and then he says this job saw it hallelujah says job saw it man used to look at it it was a bible at one day but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years god sits in the midst of all of it and he looks down paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down whoa jesus amen she said paul's in there my mother's in there uh any any one of our relatives they're in there looking down think about it church glory to god all right so i just want to just one little point that i want to make make a reference to those who are trained no is there job saw it those who are trained they know it's there job sign all right now let me uh pick up another little thought here out of the evening messenger amen praise the lord hallelujah uh amen so here uh in this quote it says that's the messenger of the last days the evening light is first find that church where they will believe the message find that church hunt it find that church where they will believe the message hunted can you read what i'm talking about hunt where that church is that'll even let you come in that won't close the door in your face amen and then when you do do there then you found character now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed she's got to be clothed stand still see if if she could get it oh my now watch this it goes on he says look at little rebecca listening to every word her little heart was beating uh he was telling her now you sweated it out where will i go until i find the character now uh you know he's just kind of jumping into a story here and i'm kind of catching this quote midstream but um uh you know abraham's faithful servant uh went down there to find a wife for isaac and as he was there you know going to find a wife he said a prayer is like lord let the young lady that comes and not just offer me water but the one that will offer my camel's water as well let that be the one that's supposed to be the wife amen to isaac and uh and after he prayed you know after he said amen just prayer here comes rebecca amen walking up to the well and she says hey here you know let me get you some water but also let me offer some water to your camels and this was not a light job amen this was not just a cup of water amen this was gallons and gallons of water i believe he had 10 camels and and i forget what the numbers are but those camels drink gallons of water and if i recall correctly she had to go and get 200 gallons of water amen in order to give that to amen these camels hallelujah it showed that she was a woman that was not afraid to work oh come on somebody amen she wasn't afraid to work right now now there are there are times we understand in life where maybe the wife might not work amen she's there raising the kids and we understand that but then there's other times in life but you know what uh it may be necessary for her to go to work glory to god and we got to find a balance and all of that but but here rebecca showed a man in her character that she was not afraid to work hallelujah glory to god but here so let's kind of pick this thought up uh you know as he's going it says until i find character then when i find the character then make us stand still long enough to get her ready to go to meet him oh my what a striking thing wish we had a little more time on that ready to go meet him says get her ready stand still to listen to his message of him eliezer wasn't speaking of himself but he was speaking of the one he was sent from and he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him amen he went he wanted to clothe her with these things glory to god you know how he fixed her up if i could just get her to wash a face glory amen he said i just felt checked on that so i better keep still anyhow i said enough you know what i'm talking about now listen just stand still now look at this he goes and says notice the end time messenger his job will be to get the saints ready the bride ready for the bridegroom that will be his message now you want to learn abc's so you can study algebra later when those other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to them now watch this amen when those when these other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to themselves talk about the seals that are in the scripture okay the seven seals will only be revealed to the bride other people will have the same bible that you have and not understand the things that you understand amen it will only be revealed to all them stay with me glory glory glory i love to say this amen i said it this morning i was teaching i said this message that we believe is not an alternative to another denominational church amen this is not just an alternative that's not what god sent the message for amen this message was to bring us back to truth this message was to bring us back amen to amen the uh what god was looking for out of his word uh when jesus had the conversation with the woman at the well he says he says uh the lord god is seeking for those that will worship him in spirit and in truth hallelujah and we finally come to a spot because we receive the revelation of the truth we can truly worship god in that place not the name of a church but there's a special place that you can come to in god where you are worshiping him in spirit and in truth hallelujah not just the name of a church but a special place in god now which he says this it says when these other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to them that's right learn abc first what does abc always believe christ not to creed amen christ see believe what he says not what somebody else says if it's contrary look at this if a man tells you it's all right for you to cut your hair women you know he's lying amen the bible says it's wrong if he says you can be a deacon and still have four or five wives he's lying amen that's contrary to the word see all these other things that we speak of call it to the word and see if it's the word right all right all right so you know as he was saying this those other seals on the back of the book open they'll only be revealed to them uh i wanted to just make a statement uh there are things that only the bride will know and others will never know let me say it again there are things that only the bride will know that others will never know the bride will be able to put a man this mysterious scripture puzzle back together i want to say it again the bride will be able to put this mysterious scripture puzzle back together amen she will understand serpency it won't be a mystery to her it'll be the truth to her amen what really happened in the garden of eden she i mean when she hears it because she was told praise god that they they ate an apple she was told that they ate an apricot and when she was told that in sunday school i mean just getting out of the gate in genesis when she was told that it never registered with her she could never agree with that statement an apple caused all of this a apple calls every funeral a apple praise god amen calls every visit to the hospital and apple calls every sickness i apple caused every pain an apple did this it did not make sense to her but when she was told that no adultery took place in the garden of heat she said hey wait a minute now that sounds like something no no no no no what you say and then she start tracing that thing because you look in genesis you see these two different lineages why we got the lineage of adam going this way and then the lineage of kane going another way what is going on then she come to find out that the bible said that uh cain was of that wicked one which mean cain was not of adam because adam was the son of god so where did cain come from there was a relationship that happened between the serpents amen and eve and now we gotta understand the serpent because cause now now i'm not in a serpent a snake that's not no no no no you missed it you missed it the serpent was cursed and put on his belly so before he was cursing out on his belly he stood on two feet it began to make sense to her say this is what i'm talking about this mystery is being put back together and if i can get that out of genesis then by the time i get to revelation but i get uh not known to us as the thunders yet so the actions question it says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about right the thunders was to reveal the seals amen the thunders came to reveal the seals unfortunately had people coming to this mess and trying to make it so mysterious know the thunders the seven when people actually you believe the seven thunders yes of course i do because they reveal the seals they reveal the seals right it says uh um uh the seven thunders that utter their voices and no one can make out what it was john knew what it was now let me just um let me just read this let me make a statement but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sound and the seven mysteries of the seven thunders will be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh church age now that's just a quick answer he said the thumbs were revealed in the seals now uh let me just let me just drop something off here real quick there's there you're gonna run into people that are gonna tell you say well now brother branham when he preached that um he found material from other people they're gonna say found it from larkin they found it from some other guy russell i think or something like that and and some of these guys in i'm talking about in early uh 17 18 1900's whatever these guys had actually uh stumbled across some things in scripture and they actually came to some light right but i think even even this guy russell called himself being the messenger for that day or something like that you know but but here it is my my question on any of this did god vindicated no no no no no doubt people are going to stumble on things in the scripture yeah they're going to get the truth in that but did god vindicate it right because when god sent his prophet in this day he vindicated him from his birth all the way to his death he was vindicating his prophets praise the lord so i'm watching for the vindications amen in these things and i realized brother adam said yes i did look into some of this and i was able to just put all the pieces together glory glory glory glory he brought he brought out you know the white horse rider and the red horse ride and the pale horse rider it was all symbolic the black horse rider all that was symbolic in scripture but then he actually broke it down and told us what it all meant amen and when those things were being revealed that was the thunders out in their voices now who connected that did russell connect that that the thunders were other than their voices revealing the seals praise the lord all right give him let me give you another one this out of later seeing church age and i had to give you a very specific search on that uh so just put that in and you'll be able to pull it up it says this now this messenger of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 and i'm hitting highlights here because you have to go back and read your bible and see exactly what he's saying malachi 4 is a promise that god's going to send elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the lord and we are fellowshipping under the ministry of that manifestation all right revelation 10 7 is going to do two things he says this one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals amen it will be these divinely mystery truths that literally turn the heart of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so this is what we're fellowshipping under this is what this is why we believe this message all right so just stay with me i just want to drop those things off now i'm going to um i want to get back to abraham's covenant confirm y'all just bear with me we're going we're going to make our journey through this and and i think you'll see some things amen remember only the bride gonna recognize it amen and um uh uh just like you say you gotta you gotta be trained to see certain things hey he said job saw it so i was looking at that zodiac and i was trying to i couldn't see it but a train i always sees it job saw it all right watch this abraham's covenant confirm he says i want to say something here i'm afraid to says is it all right brother says now you have to watch when you're especially with people they misunderstand now i believe there i believe the threes a trinity is in one as we know now i believe that god has three god had three bibles if you'll watch now the first bible he wrote was in the heavens the zodiac now i know you can get off on the deep ends of that and you get off on deep ends of anything else but truly if you notice the zodiac how did it start it starts the first in the zodiac is the virgin the last in the zodiac is leo the lion the first coming and the second coming of christ once through the virgin next as the lion of the tribe of judah you catch that you catch the cross vicious scene that's the cancer age that we're going through everything in the skies declares god everything in the skies declares god certainly does watch this he says and god's people is to look up realizing that god is not on the earth but he's in heaven he wrote the first bible oh glory glory glory now the second thing he wrote enoch in the times of the pyramid now yesterday we were sitting out there fellowshipping and with the couples and brother marquise happened to say something about the pyramid i did not internet conversation i said he doesn't step right into my sermon that's glory to god so brother marquise this is for you the second thing he wrote enoch in the times of the pyramid down in egypt i've been there and perhaps many men and here women has been there you notice those pyramids we we couldn't reproduce them they're too great too gigantic they're so geographically in the center of the earth no matter where the sun is there's never shade around them and they got tons and tons and tons of boulders up there and that they argued about that once we used to debate it in school how they built it well the fella the fellow of my point said they rolled it up now i want to say they still debating today as to how those things got built they cannot agree with how these things were built amen uh just take that down just for a second amen i was just kind of looking at uh just a little bit uh a little video here and there uh youtube and one scientist is saying this another scientist saying that and they just they just kind of just their mind just going all over the place maybe it's like this and they they got material that they study in they say they've never found any other material like this on the earth they have no idea how these these things get like this what material did they use how did they put this together now here's what i like to say i'm in in the furtherance of this quote uh the the thing i'd like to say we would if we would be willing to listen to a prophet and connect our scientific theories to what a prophet has spoken it might unlock some mysteries because we heard what a prophet said about what happened in the garden of eden listen listen listen listen if you can believe that there was an adam and eve based on what you read in scripture you need to understand the way you believe in that is because you believed a prophet what prophet did you believe moses moses wrote genesis and he was not there in order to believe genesis you have to believe a prophet so if a prophet if the prophet moses could tell us what happened in genesis then a prophet william branham can also tell us what happened at the fall [Music] here a prophet is going to give us something if we want to know how these things got together how did they put this pyramid together how did they do that one of the great wonders of the world these pyramids are like one of the seven women's of the world oh there's a lot here to say listen let me just let me just read this and then i'm gonna go a little further look at what he's saying it says uh they debated in school how they built it what a fella of my point said they rolled it up they rolled the roll roll they rolled each stone up into place well i said why they couldn't i know you can't take a box car and unload it and set it out on a rail car railroad track and put enough men around it to push it it it ain't unloaded you you can't do it i've seen it tried too many times you can only put one line of men the next line has to push against the next man's back right so you got man after man after man stacking and they trying to push something up they say that that don't make sense that ain't gonna work it'll never be like that so it says this now how you gonna push a boulder up yonder a half a city block in the air that will weigh a thousand tons so it just don't make sense now look at what the price here's the answer what they had then was the atomic power just like they got now and they built it let me finish reading the quote though okay let me finish reading um and that's what they shook the world out of its orbit because away from the sun thrown it sideways and brought the reigns and destroyed the world by water this time they're going to throw the same thing right straight back into the sun and burn it up again just as perfect as it can be now you know when i ran across that quote they say they used atomic power i said i went to my my my the smart people in my family because i ain't smart but my wife and my daughter they some of the smartest people walking the earth and i said i said i said look y'all i'ma need some help brother branham said that they use atomic power in order to build the pyramids i say what is this what is atomic power and they say now i guess we have to go back and look at i mean what just asks google what is atomic power and when we did that atomic power they said it's nuclear power and nuclear power is used to produce electricity so here i began to think so now if brother branham said they use atomic power and atomic power is nuclear power and nuclear power is used to produce electricity then maybe they use electricity in that time because it ain't new and i was already thinking that my daughter said she said she said see there's nothing new under the sun i said that's exactly right that was my thought pattern there's nothing new under the sun so they had that in their generation they had atomic power they had nuclear power they had electricity but it was lost it was lost and i and i love this because you know i don't know if i have let me let me i'm just let me let me let me calm down recently my wife and i had a a visit to noah's ark i can't remember the city but i know it's in kentucky they have a replica of noah's ark there uh in kentucky and um so we we wanted to go by and see this there uh back in may early may so we we drove down there and we it's like man it's a huge boat wow we were just blown away but they had a they showed that the noah's ark was uh that actually the titanic was three times as large as the noah's ark now here man has achieved this titanic but he also uh made this comment that he's got a ship that won't sink and in the very first voyage it was done in the first forge but here god has a man and he tells them pitch it in and pitch it out right and and when he built this how's this gonna make it but it's still standing or i believe they say it's in turkey somewhere but uh but but here you know uh god built something that would last forever glory to god has a testament that all we gotta do is follow god's word stand on the word of god we'll last forever right but but but here you know uh you know we were going through and just observing it's just amazing some of the things if you ever got a chance to go see this place just the way that um they fed the animals the way they clean the animals the system that they had in place is i mean it was it was beyond something we would even think about today right but uh but it just i mean they were very very wise people during that time uh brother branham say that that that that uh civilization was even more more advanced than our civilization so as i was talking my wife and my daughter said you know it's possible they had computers it's possible they had cell phones it's possible they had all this but god had to destroy it right because of all the sin that they got involved in and you know what we are we're headed towards another destruction look there's nothing new nothing new i don't care what device they come up with nothing new so you know this this this lady you know she saw us there and just observing everything she and she asked the question she said do you think the pyramids we on the ark do you think the pyramids were built before the flood or after the flood and how my wife start conversing and i'm sitting there saying before before now i can't i can only tell you by prophetic understanding it was before and here brother adam said glory to god and i i i didn't i i he said that enoch built the pyramids and he says he put a bible in it now not like this but just symbols because he understood the zodiac certain people understood they studied these things they understood so he can put that in the pyramids and said but now we got this written bible that we carry oh hallelujah y'all stay with me stay with me glory to god here we see i said i said it was it was it was it was written amen before and as i thought about it said maybe the reason why these scientists can't understand why the material is the way it is on the pyramids and they can't they can't figure out we we've never found material like this anywhere else in the earth remember the reason because the pyramids was covered underwater and that did something to the material and this is why you can't figure out why it don't look like nothing else don't feel it because it all disconnected through what a prophet said and if you just take what a prophet said it might unlock some mysteries if we take what the prophet said it'll unlock mysteries in scripture all right now i'm going to read a little statement out of the statue of a perfect man actually you know what let me read the scripture ecclesiastes 1 verse 9 through 11 let me read that for you then we'll go to the statue of perfect man the bible says this the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done that which is done is that which shall be done the thing that hath been is that which shall be see ain't nothing new under the sun you ain't doing nothing no different than what other people did before you and what you doing right now people gonna come behind you and do the same thing come on look at look at the animal life look at animal life look at look at uh uh dogs still do what dogs do they bark they've been barking for years they're still doing the same cats do the same thing cats do they meow ain't nothing change and the next cat born he got me out and the next cat born he got me out come on the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything wherever it may be said see this is new it has been already of old time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those things that shall come after nothing new nothing new thank god we just take what a prophet said we'll be all right now listen let me just go a little further two more quotes and i want to break into something here statue of a perfect man then after that i'll go right into blasphemous names now look at this he says this please let it be known on the tape and wherever more i'm not teaching this as a doctrine as i'm going through this i'm not teaching this as a doctrine not pyramid doctrine right it says what i'm going to say now but i just want to show you that by the help of god what it really is that the first bible that god ever wrote was the zodiac in the sky it starts off with the virgin it ends up with leo the lion and when i get into that sixth and seventh seal now i read a scripture out of revelation eight one about the seventh seal when it opened the seventh seal there was silence all right now watch it says and when i get into that sixth and seventh hill you'll find out when that other seal was opened the zodiac mark of that place was canceled across fish it says and that's the cancer age we're living in now reveal and the next thing the seal tore off it revealed leo the lion the second coming of christ he come first to the virgin he comes next leo the lion it'll bring uh i'll bring this uh he says now i don't know whether i'm gonna have time this morning i'm gonna do the best i can to show you that these steps are in the pyramids just exactly the second bible god wrote enoch wrote them and put them in the pyramid and the third god is always perfected in the third then he made himself his word which is what we're carrying now watch it watch it just stay with me and i don't want y'all to uh uh uh check out on me well jack what is this i'm just showing you god has been here all alone covering all of uh god is vast we serve a big god stop limiting this god that we serve i mean a god that created universes not only that the bible say he created worlds worlds right so so so we gotta we gotta we gotta we gotta see how big our god is i wanna expand your thinking this morning praise god even when we read scripture amen why did job write that job is the oldest book in the bible and why would job write this what was job looking at hey i'm gonna just get i'm gonna go ahead of myself and just say this joe saw seals but it was typed in stars so job could look all the way down to this day and and and put it in a word that we we just read right over the word never really looked at what the word really meant but i'll get there so let me just let me just keep reading all right blasphemous names watch this watch this now notice on this that christ god wrote three bibles the first bible was in the in the sky now we're not making a doctrine of this just kind of sharing something with the church that's all this is we're not going to be coming up here you know every week talk about the three bibles and trying to break down it no no no we ain't doing all of that just a little thought for the church amen notice on this that christ god wrote three bibles the first bible's in the sky called the zodiac now if you don't know the book of job look at it if you don't know the book of job just forget about it because because job is the one explains it job explain what job is the one explains it how that he looked up and he named those things in the sky job looked up and he named those things in the sky we just read and i'm gonna go back and read it for you again just just bear with me job named the things in the sky and god writing his bible in the sky god writing his bible amen through enoch enoch was a prophet and he sticks he puts it inside the pyramid and then god gives us his written word he makes it sure that we don't miss this it says notice in the zodiac what did it start off the first thing in the zodiac is the virgin last thing in the zodiac leo the line the first coming of christ through the virgin the second coming leo the lion the lion of the tribe of judah now let's look at some of joe's declarations just watch this follow me here all right first of all joe was a man that faced many tragedies i mean my god uh any of us had to go through some of the things job with i don't went through i don't know if we still behold to know all right glory to god but joe was a man that faced many tragedies and and here's what i like his response or his attitude in the midst of his tragedy is what really speaks to the believers today how this man responded to tragedy amen one of the things said that the sabians came and and stole his oxen and his donkeys and they killed most of the servants that were watching over those animals and only one servant escaped to tell the story so he lost his servants he lost his oxen he lost his donkeys and that servant rises up running into jobs i said job you're not gonna believe it amen but guess what just happened you just lost your and you just lost all your donkeys and you lost all the servants that were watching and it's just just sitting there like wow i can't believe that and while he's listening to listen and tap listening to that amen lighten him struck and burned up the sheep and most of servants that were watching the sheep my god only one servant escaped to come and tell the story went running to the house and job i don't know what you i don't know what you just heard but i got some really bad news for you you just lost all the sheep and the servants that were watching the sheep and i'm the only one escaped said my god i lost my ox and lost my donkeys now my sheep job it ain't over yet the child ins a man come and took his camels and killed all but one of his servants who were watching over the camels and only one escape to tell the story come running into the house job you just lost all your cameras and all the people that were watching the camels wait a minute i lost my donkeys i locked my ox and i lost my sheep i lost my camels lord i don't know if i can take too much of this then they said a storm came destroyed the house where his children were partying amen and during this storm he lost all of his children somebody come and tell joe the store job i hate to tell you this but you just lost your wait a minute wait a minute i just lost my oxen i just lost my donkeys i just lost my sheep i just lost my camels and now you're telling me all my kids right joe's declaration look at joe's declaration after losing all this job one verse 20 praise god through 22 this is one of joe's declarations i want you to catch him here he says the bible says this oh i love i just love job i can't wait to get to the other side to shake his hand joe said this says them job of rose after all these people come in with all this this bad news then joba rose rent his mantle shaved his head fell down upon the ground i love this and worshipped so i tell you i mean i preached this before the appropriate response response when you're going through great trials is to worship job worship now verse 21 says and said naked came out out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return this look at this job's declaration the lord gave oh my and the lord have taken away blessed be the name of the lord one of job's declarations was to praise god in the midst of everything he was going through now i love verse 22 it says in all this everything job went through and all this job sin not nor short nor charged god foolishly job's declarations job after you had all this bad news the next thing happened to job is that he started going through in his own flesh and satan was given some boundaries said now you can you can take this you can take that you can do this but you can't take his life i want to let you know this morning the devil got boundaries when it come to dealing with you he can only go so far and while job was going through i like this because another one of his declarations amen job was a little questioning about death and and he you know man as you face death what's going to happen here what's going to happen that job 14 14 you made a declaration says if a man die shall he live again i love this all the days of my appointed time will i wait until my change comes amen so no matter what i'm going through i'ma just wait on god i'm not going to get discouraged while i'm waiting because i i know he gonna come through at some point in time i'ma just learn to wait on the lord job's declarations amen another one amen while job was under attacking his health amen we pick him up over here in job 19. praise god verse 25 through 27 job says this for i know that my redeemer liveth glory and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body and brother adam say the worm that's going to destroy you is already living on the inside of you glory to god to those after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall be holding out another though my reigns be consumed within me job declaring that he's going to see god even though the the devil's attacking his flesh i'ma still see god in my flesh job got a a glimpse of the resurrection brother branham said that job also saw some other things he's the one that explained these things that he saw in the sky he began to declare even in the midst of what he was going through let's go back and pick him up in job chapter 9 verse 1 through 10 job is declaring some things hallelujah the bible says then job answered and remember now job had a couple friends that came to visit him while he was going through and let me tell you something if you're going to go visit somebody while they're going through try to encourage them but joe's friends came to just let him know that they thought he was a secret sinner and i mean evidently they must have got together because all three of them were just sitting there just letting job have it and job joe made his statements he said i'm not inferior to you i ain't got i there's no sin in my life i know even job's wife came to him and said why don't you uh curse god and die he so notice you speak like a foolish woman but he didn't call a fool so you're just talking like a foolish woman saying no no no no i can learn how to praise god in the midst even when i don't have i can praise them and when i do have i can praise them watch this job while he's talking to his friends he makes this comment and job 90 says then jose jobe answered and said i know it so the truth but how should man be just with god says if he would contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise and heart mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and have prospered how are you gonna harden yourself against god i don't believe in god how are you gonna prosper it says which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger which shaketh the earth out of a place and the pillars thereof tremble which commandeth the sun and a rise of night and sealeth up the stars oh glory which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea which maketh now watch this job is the one that names them which maketh arcturus orion pleiades and the chambers of the south which do with great things past finding out yay and wonders without number now you know when i had to go and look up some of these words what does arcturus mean arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the sky and they say it's in the brightest in the constellation of boots it is they call it an orange giant and they said uh also i'm looking at this uh definition the key to the bible it's a brilliant star near the northern constellation of ursa major and they call it the great bear and i like this the fourth brightest star arcturus because god is found in the number four amen he was the fourth man in the fire come on church amen lazarus was gone four days when he came back i mean god that number four is the number of deliverance and here oh my job can see his deliverance in arcturus orion he names it amen and orion is a brilliant constellation of about 80 stars in the southern hemisphere so looking at the northern hemisphere he can see god he's looking at the southern hemisphere and he can still see god oh let me go a little further i want to talk about pleiades but before i get into that let me just make a little comment [Music] joe 38 we're gonna pick up something here job had gone through all this with his friends and joe going through in his body job lost his animals but you know at the end of the story joe got everything back double he got double for his trouble see satan should have took me through that i'm about to get double i'm about to get double hey hallelujah somebody but but but here in job 38 what happened is that god has to come down and he begins to make some comments to job and he asks him some questions he says where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth he says and what are the foundations even fastened to right it says who laid the cornerstone of it job right and then he asked job of question where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy and the morning stars began to sing together it says god just began to ask some questions and then in job 38 verse 31 and 32 let's pick it up oh he asked job a question cans thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or lose the bands of orion can style bring forth mazeroth in his season or cast thou god arcturus with his sons so god has this same a level a man of understanding that job has and he asks for these questions about pleiades and arcturus and orion oh i love it i love it watch this play these was a constellation of seven stars amos picks it up as a prophet and talks about it let me just read it for you amos 5 8. abrams 5 8 look at it just follow me follow me please was a constellation of seven stars amos 5 8 says this seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion i mean that's the one that we want to be pursuing after the one that made the seven stars and orion can i tell you there was one that actually had seven stars in his hand glory to god and in his absence those seven stars would be reflected light on the earth seven messengers seek him that maketh the seven stars and the rhyme and turn of the shadow of death into the morning and make it the day dark with night that calling for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name the lord jesus christ [Applause] job 38 31 can cast thou bind this is god asking job a question can thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades these seven stars the sweet influence of these seven stars man i'm fellowshipping under the influence of the star listen those who are trained to see it they'll see it and when those other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to them remember that now now here's another definition about pleiades that i want you to catch so uh a a a definition from the the astronomy dictionary if i can put it that way amen just and it says this pleiades is a well-known open cluster of stars in the constellation taurus now watch this six stars are visible to the naked eye six so there's it's a constellation of seven stars but six are visible to the naked eye what about the seventh amendment six and here's job looking at and then calling that guy he said he said and he talked about a tourist and orion and plenty he's the one naming it name it and he said now c6 for the seventh one what about that seventh and when it opened the seventh seal there was silence see when you go back and read the bible in revelation uh six seven and eight you'll see that the first six seals white horse rider red horse rider a pale horse rider amen black horse rider souls under the altar you see interruption nature you see all these things in the first sixties but when it got to the seventh silence at the seventh and it was spoken of in pleiades oh glory to god hey the first bible ties to the second bible i mean the third bible proving that i mean it's god all filling all this space and time it was god in job's day and it's still god today job looked in the sky named it saw seven stars it's i know it's seven there because god ain't m6 that's the number of man it's seven that's that's the number of of completion and they named it player these constellation of seven stars but but here in the the the uh astronomy dictionary they say six of them are visible i said my god i went to the key to the bible this little book that sister michelle gave me years ago and i it says that this pleiades meant it's a cluster of seven stars appearing in the constellation of taurus and it says their sweet influences indicate they're appearing at the opening of the season of spring in april april they're sweet influences this i'm just reading i'm reading definitions they're sweet influences indicate they're appearing at the opening of the season of spring in april now remember remember this remember when these other seals on the back open they'll only be revealed to them you want to know when the seals was opened [Applause] solomon springtime springtime and actually springtime actually come it came in the month of march at the end of march when brother branham preached the seals in 1963. flowing right into april and we are fellowshipping underneath the sweet influences of pleiades that only brian gonna understand language like that only bride gonna get that other people read that same bible and see nothing but that no there's so much in there that first bible that job in the zodiac is looking at and he calls it out he calls them out we're fellowshipping underneath this all right and we're underneath this third bible god put it all right there in scripture i i couldn't read it all i'm just giving you highlights tell you what you keep coming to church you'll find out what this is all about but i just had to go and go to you know because there was this the the the astronomic the the dictionary of astronomy they said six of them are visible but the seventh one wasn't i said oh my that taught right about themselves because when it opened the seventh seal they were silenced so let me go ahead and read to you out of the seventh seal the sweet influences of pleiades i could have actually just titled it that but i knew that might have been too much so i just made it job's declarations the seventh seal the brother adam makes this and and i want y'all to remember when before he even preached the seals this is what i mean by the supernatural before he preached it no matter what people say remember them seven angels came down and made the face of christ and sent him back to the east in order to preach it so so no matter what people have come before and actually come up and say you know they might have some understanding on the white horse ride to be amen the antichrist and just four different phases of the antichrist that's all those horse riders were right but uh he says uh uh i said no no matter who might have stumbled across that first did god vindicate it were there seven angels that came down make the face of christ that we can look at and say okay now this is the time that this is to be released and now we're fellowshipping on these sweet influences and we we know this god sent a prophet and vindicated his own prophet we don't have to vindicate him god already did that we just believe it that's right let me he preached and god sent him back with those the visitation of seven angels go back and preach the seals and every day he walked out to preach uh angel would visit him and give him the revelation of the word for that day he said he was going back to some of his old notes and god was showing no no no not that it just unfold the word of god to them every day supernaturally brought to us these revelations and there some of them will tie to what others have said because he's just tying up the loose ends seven seals he made this comment oh my god now there's some reason god let the seven voices be thundered remember the thunders are the revelations in the seals the sweet influence of plenties there was some reason that god let the seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it the seventh seal a hidden mystery no one knows it remember that seven star was hidden no one could see it no one knows it the seven still no one knows it all right but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming the seventh seal the reason there was a half-hour silence because that that's connected to the coming of the lord and if he would reveal any more he would reveal his coming see some of us want to live a life if we knew the exact day that jesus was coming if we knew the exact day exact time that's when we would make things right we would live like devils until that day and then all of a sudden was lying in glory lord i love you god know you living like that and that's why he gonna surprise you like a thief in the night nobody know when a thief is coming however if you're the bride you are not of the night so it's not a mystery to you you live ready all the time all right listen we find that the christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the sentence but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it's right along what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about his seven thunder mystery so you see it's connected together that much we have an understanding of it today because the rest of it is all unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room i heard this or not heard it rather but seen it unfold to the seven thunders now that's as far as we can go right there and now i trust that each and every one of you will serve god and do that which is right and love him all your life and serve him and god will take care of the rest of it even in this watch this now and i'm gonna read a little bit more even in this having this understanding should not cause us to live um these ridiculous like i said be a sane christian don't go around i mean you know just come on you don't have to pray about what toothpaste to buy you don't have to do that get the one on sale and just just just just move on but don't don't be that type of christian you know lord i just need you to lead me god oh god come on y'all i mean some things god just wants you to just do god don't even want you to cry no more he wants you to speak right so so so it's time to grow up and be a mature christian and and don't get so high and mighty got all these revelations but you're so deep in your revelation that nobody can fellowship with you you can't even fellowship with yourself you don't even get along with your own self that's bad nobody and nobody understand you no no no no no no no that's not true brother branham gave us very clear instructions be sane christians this day don't make it don't don't cause our heads to get puffed up and and now we can't even just be normal people hallelujah this is just a little food for the bride when you go back and you read about pleiades now it makes sense to you job named it job looked and saw in the north and saw our tourists looked over in the south and saw uh orion then he looked again and saw pleiades and then god come and ask him said cam now what about fellowship and under sweet influences of plenties i told you brother eugene had me he stopped talking about this i said my god brother eugene i never looked at the scripture like that but this bible become a new bible especially brother branham said that when the seals opened the bible became a new book to him i can tie the seventh seal to job god did that he just opened it up so we could see it and the oldest book of the bible seven seals was right there but written in the zodiac and six of them were visible but the seventh one wasn't oh that's in our bible too let me keep reading now we have in the completion here now by the grace of god all the mysteries of the six seals has been sealed up and we understand and know here that the seventh seal is look at this look at this the seventh seal is not to be known to the uh oh that i think i said something about that earlier right that only uh when these other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to them the bride not to the public the bride now his coming and the hour of his coming when the destruction of the earth you know he said here what would be the sign of his coming in the end of the world in matthew 24 there where they asked him the question he went down to that he told about israel being gathered as a nation in the 31st verse of matthew 24 31 but when he started off on parable seed then you see there learn a parable the fig tree when you see it put them forth as buds why you know it's spring nigh you know you know spring is not and then when you see this coming to pass then you know the time is nigh see israel's gathering in his own homeland but you notice he omitted the revelation of the seventh seal that's jesus speaking in matthew 24 he never spoke of the seventh seal can i say six stars of pleiades were revealed in matthew 24 but the seventh was not visible right amen that's right amen he says see israel's gathering its own homeland but you notice he admitted the revelation of seventh hill and here when the seven seal when he opened it he also omitted it again so when brother branham's out there preaching it he has he's the holy spirit actually says no stop right there don't go any further than that all you can talk about is these seven thumbs that connects to these seals and just show that they're connected together and it's also connected to the coming of the lord we're living in the coming right now now we might not know the very date of the hour and look it's no need for us to be searching this out i mean i know we got people that they try to get the exact day and oftentimes they miss it they tell us this day and then they change it and then they tell us again then they check stop searching for that right god ain't gonna reveal that to nobody if his prophet didn't share it you can't share it you admitted the revelation of the seven still just oh my and here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also admitted again see so we see that it's completely a mystery it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for these mysteries to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that jesus appears on earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let us just all pray and live good straight christian lives looking forward for his coming i couldn't i i could i think we couldn't find any better advice yes we got all of this god has revealed it but just live good christian lives until jesus comes again church i'll tell you i'm blessed and looking at some of job's declarations and looking at how prophet ties it all together just helps us see the scripture in a different line like i said i'm in uncharted territory but i should enjoy swimming out here like this with y'all god richly bless you [Applause] amen uh i'm gonna have a word of prayer brother smile i'm gonna have you come and close us out for today amen father we just thank you for your your word your truth lord uh we we can just see you in scripture the oldest book in the bible the book of job god all the way to the book of revelation you're there you're filling all space and time the lord the most important place that you want to feel is our hearts god our our desire and i hope lord that um god we would just come to a place where we fall more in love with you and songs they fall in love with jesus is the best thing i ever done oh in his arms i feel protected his arms um never disconnected father we just thank you lord for what you are doing in our midst and just thank you lord brother eugene just kind of sharing a little bit and then uh uh brother harvey giving me a call brother clinton's brother he heard it he's like did you hear this and just bringing it back to my attention and lord just to hear that you had something there for our church god we can we can we're just so blessed we're so privileged to be able to hear the word of god to see the things that we see god [Music] lord we love you we praise you and we thank you let us leave here god with a deeper desire lord i want to please you and i want to love you more realize how important this message is that you've sent to us my nobody else would be able to capture these things but lord it's right there it's right there in the scripture thank you that you reveal it to us god it's in jesus name we pray amen let's give the lord a hand to praise amen now um this does something happen this week that something happened [Music] something happened something big happened i i congratulations on something big happening praise the lord amen god bless you all god bless you but smiley want you to come amen and close the saudi man on today praise the lord hey man let's go to heaven and praise man i tell you what we're not a masterpiece this morning amen the enemy tried to derail me from making it this morning we had a wonderful time on uh last night with the couples and on our way home i don't know what what i tell you the devil's still alive uh something ran out in front of us and uh kind of messed up the bottom of my car and this morning i said well i think i still could make it i started out and i got on the outskirts of town and uh it's just something was scrubbing it was the the inner part of the bottom part of my car ah i'm not gonna make it to church and i turned around and sent that brother jack a message i called him he said man i ain't gonna be able to make it and uh but you know my mind started working and i said if i could get rid of this little piece right here so i went home and i got me some slips and i cut that little plastic off i say i'm on my way i say i'm already dressed ain't no sense of staying home so i said well they they sing sometime for a little minute so i say i think i got time and by the time i pulled up in the parking lot brother troy called me and uh brother jack was up and i said well i'm right on time i get the end time and i don't know about y'all but i'm happy to be here this morning i'm gonna get out the way but but i will say this this is the reason why uh it's important never to put a period behind what you believe because the moment the moment you put a period behind what you believe there's there's where the revelation of god stops for you right this thing will be unfolding way on the other side things that things that you know even even i've been preaching close to 30 years now and i still realize sometimes man i'm on the surface but i tell you what he took us out into the deep this morning all right well i tell you i'm sitting back there man like like those guys with the grapes that they had and took from kanan and the little grape juice all around my mouth and everything else i could see brother solomon like wow that's all right i tell you what i appreciate brother jacket and his ministry boy he be coming up with some things so so whatever we do just never put a period there just always keep a calm up because god i believe that in this season god's got just so much for us just to understand i'm glad to be a part of a special group of people right and you are you all too too to know that that you're special that god chose you before the foundation of the world let's try this little song and we'll we'll have a dismissal but we appreciate um sister wayson's family uh this morning it's good to be able to be here and be able to visit with him you know i i often think about sister wayson uh she she was just a real champion for jesus christ and uh um i you know with some of the old timers brothers escape it's good to see them this morning i don't think i would have been able to make it all of those years without them working beside me and pulling and encouraging me for all of those years amen and uh we i think we're all looking forward to that time to where we'll get a chance to all come together and fellowship where there won't be no goodbyes we'll be able to we'll be able to you know uh fellowship for a thousand years and it'll be like nothing and i'll go see brother capers sister capers and i'll pop over here to this one and you know i get over here to sister lewis y'all i'll tell you what y'all to make me feel good but but i'm looking forward to that time but we we got to stay in the fight i feel like let's [Music] i feel like gold going on though trials come [Music] i feel like going on though trials come on every [Music] my way [Music] it get hard sometimes i feel like hallelujah [Applause] [Music] feel like pressing as they pray that self-religious about heads heavenly father we just thank you this morning we appreciate amen all that's been done today we appreciate your servant this morning getting himself out of the way and you know i i'm glad to be a part of a group that that can see that can understand we could see the mighty god unveil before us this morning so much in what he preached and like he said and and i and i believe it he was just kind of hitting the highlight of some things to just be a blessing and encouragement to us and if he'll go back and dig down there's there's even more and and if you dig down and go back there's even more it's just something that's constantly unfolding we appreciate him lord we pray that you just continue to uh bless him and give him strength lord and and polish up these these nuggets lord god that we could feed in this hour and get strength and encouragement on the journey that we own we appreciate you we appreciate sister wayson's family being in our midst this morning and uh we just pray to just continue to encourage us obtain a touch sister capers body brother capers getting
