church app and we had released it and we were working with it and we started noticing that the the scriptures were not what we were accustomed to and come to realize they were not using King James version of the Bible they were using some you know other form and and for me I'm just I like to use the same Bible that the prophet used uh because sometimes these other Bibles they actually taken the meaning away from the scripture rather than actually supporting it so I um I said no we can't use that we got to go back to our old one well we just found out this week that they are they they do have the King James version for the new app and we'll let you all know uh when we'll be kind of moving over to that but I don't know if they did it just for us because we were whole doubts we weren't moving off the platform until we got King James version and uh so we thank the Lord forward but um uh so keep that Church website as we'll be streaming from john423.org Brothers will be virtual prayer

are here Lord Jesus the angel of the Lord himself is here father take your rightful position and Lord manifest Your Glory to God be the glory for great things you've done amen amen God bless you we thank the Lord for this day he's given to us we glorify his name let's read our scriptures so that we can take our series okay let's go to as a career and we can have the slides we just want to speak on a give me the first slide please on the new birth living a life by Divine understanding or the New Birth living by Divine understanding so we want to read something from the career chapter three we're gonna read the whole chapter about 10 verses the book of the career chapter 3. and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him so the Lord is showing Joshua standing before the angel of the Lord himself and then Satan stand at the right hand what is the right and the power of God and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuked the O Satan even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is this no Branch plugged out of the fire so who is Jerusalem is God city of Peace it's Mrs Jesus Christ that if only before the foundation of the world and is that the branch that is plucked from the fire what is the branch the branch is you amen and what fire is he talking about is it a wildfire that happened in Hawaii no it's the pillar of Fire amen you came from the pillar of Fire you were God before the foundation of the world and we're going to understand why we're putting this flesh why we became Sinners and then why why the Lord has to go allow us to go through all these processes and then bring it bring us back to who we are verse three now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garment from him and unto him he said behold have caused by an iniquity to pass from thee and I'll clothe thee with change of Remnant change of Remedies the Holy Ghost baptism transformation of heart and I said let them set a friend meter upon his head what is the meters King James English that was used is it's like the the chef's Hearts it's a headrest that the priest used to wear to symbolize uh the power that they have the authority amen that is their Glory that is the deity that they used to kind of it's a crown that was given soon for the priest so they said a fair meter and we are not talking about physical Crown here the crown that the Lord gives you is the holy ghost in your heart so they set a frame meter up on his head and clothed him with the Garment and the angel of the lost two by six and the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua saying Protestant means said unto Joshua that is King James English that says the Lord of hosts if thou will walk in my ways and if that will keep my charge then thou shall also judge my house so God is going to make you a ruler But first you need to be changed amen and shall keep my courts and I'll give thee places to walk among these that standby here now oh Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wandered at who are those men it's a five-fold Ministry is you a man for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch what is God doing what is all this about he wants to bring out Christ Jesus the branch out of your flesh amen for behold the stone that I've laid before Joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes Behold our engrave The Grieving thereof said the Lord of hosts and I'll remove the iniquity of the land in one day now what is the stone stone is revelation and that is the revelation God gave to you and the stone was what it brings out seven eyes that is seven Messengers but then it's good to engrave and multiply amen and after we're going to see the one who was behind the serving Messengers that is the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen without the Lord the servant is not complete the Lord makes it complete it becomes eight and it becomes one amen in that day it says the Lord of fools shall I call every man his neighbor and that and under under the vine and another Victory the vine and the future is your talking is the peace that the Lord has given to you we may take our seed God bless you Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so we want to talk about the new birth living by Divine understanding amen you want to look at what is the new birth what does it entail to say that somebody is born again the new birth is also the same as the Holy Ghost baptism it's just different terms for the self same thing Glory Hallelujah to the Lord and I was listening to brother Troy singing he was singing how sweet to hold a new newborn baby and I say praise the Lord the Lord is confirming the title amen is that this child can can what can face you know sometimes I write I can't read my own handwriting this I read a doctor's handwriting this child can face uncertain uh this right because he lives he can face tomorrow amen and we are talking about new breath a newborn baby that is Born Into the world to face all the uncertainties of the world but with the Holy Ghost baptism this child can face every uncertainty of Life Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so we want to look at the new New Birth Concept in the Old Testament if you look at the Old Testament you don't really see new birth in the Old Testament they used to wash parts but then the Lord lead all the new birth in symbols and the shadows in the Old Testament but the new birth is a new term that was introduced by the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you go through from the Old Testament they didn't that concept wasn't there just like before Noah there wasn't nothing like cloud cloud was something that was the Lord introduced under the dispensation of no one because the Lord is always doing new things in our lives amen so the new birth Was A New Concept so let's look at another scripture let's go to uh the second scripture um yeah that's it now Jesus met this Pharisee who was a teacher give me one second thank you God bless you you just want to be a little loose he said so John Jesus made this Pharisee nicodemos who was a teacher and then he was asking he knew there was something in Jesus and he came to Jesus to ask him a question and Jesus said that you shall you must be born again and he said how can I be born again I'm old maybe past 50. do I go into my mother's room and be born again and say no you must be born of water and the blood and the spirit amen so let's read a little bit and he said let's read a little bit about that scripture he said there was a man of Pharisee Francis named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that our teacher come from God for no man can do this Miracles that doest except God be in him or God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily as very verily I say unto thee except a man be born born again he cannot see the kingdom of God see means understand he cannot be conceived the concept of the of the of the new birth the kingdom of God the government said unto me how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen and let's go to the next slide please go to the next one out where I was defining the New Birth the next one please amen yes so that is it we want to look at some few definitions of what is the New Birth the new birth actually defined your human being your very substance and the essence of your life is defined by the new birth the new bed also defined Your Existence which is both terrestrial which is your Earthly being and your Celestial existence without the new birth you might be born have parents grow go to college get money get a career marry wife have children or married husband have children have grandchildren have great grandchildren but you don't really know why you are here on this planet because your very essence of your life is not defined you're only going through the routine that everybody goes through as a human being but the celestial purpose of your life is not known to you until the Lord gives you the new birth and then even Define your purpose on this life Moses had a purpose he knew he was a savior intellectually but without the Revelation from the pillar of Fire he went about committing murder so even the good thing that we wanted to do Adolf Hitler had a good reason because Martin Luther wrote that the Jews were Antichrist and Adolf Hitler picked that concept and run wild with it and in his Motif anything Antichrist has to be exterminated so that the rest will be Christ but we know what Adolf Hitler did killed two million plus Jews and even blacks as well but he didn't fulfill their purpose the Eternal purpose for his life so the new birth actually reveal your function your functionality on this planet amen It Will Reveal Your Existence which is your if it's recording biology is your your Anatomy your very being and then your physiology how you function the new birth defines that for you and the new birth is nothing that the Holy Ghost baptism is Christ in you the seed God planted in you as we read from the scripture that Joshua the high priest was standing before the angel of the Lord and that and and Satan was resisting him in every human being is in him to do something good but there's Satan standing at the right hand to resist you from doing what is the purpose of God Amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and I was looking at this picture about the mother holding the baby and I was listening to brother Troy how sweet to hold a newborn baby how glorious when we are born into the hands of God that the almighty hold you in his arms it is pressure just as we human beings when a baby is born into the family we rejoice and are happy and have festivities God the Kingdom of Heaven rejoices when a baby is born into the house of the Lord amen so the new birth is everything to the Lord and it's everything to you amen is is simply one of the simple concept of the Bible of our Christian life but it is the most important in your life because you can go and go and go and do so many things but without a new birth we are just sitting at the same place we are not doing nothing so we need a holy ghost baptism every man on this planet regardless of your age you need to be born again because a new birth will let you know where you came from what you are doing on this Earth and when you live this flesh where you go to so it's something that each and every individual has to examine his life or her life to make Assurance doubly or triply sure that I quickly is born again that you you can put your name there I have Christ in me amen you can have all the achievement you want you can invent you can be a billionaire you can be a president you can be a pastor a prophet a whatever but without Christ on the inside your purpose is not defined and that's why we cannot underestimate or over emphasize the essence of the Holy Ghost baptism Glory Hallelujah [Applause] our Lord is a living Christ let's just look at the quotes that the prophet talk about I think let's go the previous one that I didn't thank you that is a crisis the mystery of God revealed 63 paragraph 233 say Luke Christ in you make him make him Christ the center of life of the revelation Christ in you so without Christ in you Christ is not the center of Revelation I want you to just absolve and soak this in your heart say Christ in you makes him the center of life of of the revelation so if all the Revelation that Christ has had if he you you he's not in you he doesn't make he doesn't become the center of it see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible complete revelation of Christ which has been accomplished by Christ in you now makes you not him makes you the complete Revelation not only the Revelation but of the whole thing the terrestrial the Earthly existence and the selection existence so Christ in you is the most important thing in this life amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord say what is God trying to do he's trying to put Christ in you and in me amen all that Christ is doing death on Calvary sending Prophet sending the rain having trees giving you a house giving you a job give you a family is to trying to put himself in you amen so that he'll become the center of the of the revelation of the Bible so that you become the center of the whole thing the revelation of the whole thing Christ in you amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's go to the next uh quotation what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is a spirit it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is a new birth just like the natural birth let's say for example children a person a man marries a wife it's just a man and his wife but then they unite together and then they conceive a child you don't see the child thank God for science we can have x-rays and we can see the baby moving and things like that but yes the baby is not in this place it's part of the mother's body but when the baby is born into this Earth she becomes or he becomes part of this Earth the same thing that when you are born into the kingdom of God you become part of the kingdom of God because the body of the child is part of his father and his mother the James is part of his father and his mother the same thing you your very life was ordained to be part of Christ and the Earth amen Christ Celestia is the husband man and the Earth is his wife and God as you choose your wife and your husband God also make choices there's the bulk of the Earth but God chose you sister Embrace to be missing Jesus Christ God chose you sister Virginia to be the wife of Jesus Christ God chose you better Keepers to be the words of Jesus Christ God choose brother Jack and every one of you to be Mrs Jesus Christ amen that is the love of God for you amen the Earth you are wearing maybe the clay or the the mountain in Colorado is more glorious but God didn't choose to live in the mountains of Colorado God didn't choose to live in the mountains of Kilimanjaro in Africa God didn't choose to live in the mountains of Everest but God chose to dwell in you Glory Hallelujah so he said what is the Holy Spirit what is the baptism with the Holy Spirit is the spirit baptizing you to the body of Christ it is a new breath so the prophet is in the Holy Ghost baptism and the new birth is the same thing it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you've repented so you have to repent you have to forsake yourself having heard his word and being baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God then you are now a candidate to receive the Holy Ghost baptism glory to the Lord let's go to the next slide the Lord he's good yes two three four same message Christ is the ministry of God revealed what is the new birth you say well but Abraham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and I want you to underline the word personally I remember when we were taught in school pharmacy school when the professor said I hold you responsible for this this is very important so you have to know this is coming in exams so they are certain keyword that give you cues and clues as to what the professor is talking about and so the Lord is giving you a cue of what the new birth is it's not about the past I know it's not about the ministry it's not about your mother it's not about your husband and your wife it is about you individual so when it comes to the New Birth use your thumb and point it to yourself it's about me not my brother there's a son that goes like it's me it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not my brother not my sister it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's meaning the Holy Ghost nobody Troy nobody's smiling not not my sisters over here it's me it's you personally and if you make it personally because you got to be sincere and when God knows that you are sincere then God is obligated to give you the Holy Ghost baptism because God wants to give it to you more than you are ready to receive it but we are not sincere we don't even call for it we don't Yen for it we don't hang out for it we hang out for everything under the planet we hunger for money which is just by dead president have you seen American dollar the dollar bills it's got Lincoln's Washington's uh Andrew Andrew Jackson's you get them and they just disappear out of out of within a short time because a dead president you can't Bank your Hope on that President regardless of how much you get people have the millions of them and they focal away money is a lover it doesn't stay so you can't Bank your Hope on American dollars or not even gold not diamonds not a pound sterling not the Euro not your houses so I don't know if you watch the news about what happened in Hawaii recently is it Ireland right thank you the Bushfire no Bush sorry not Bushfire but unknown fire whatever however I started destroy houses and lives and people were fleeing to the ocean and these are scriptures being fulfilled not that they were not bad people but whatever happened if you read future home the devil Ram said that the devil has power in creation he can bring thunderstorm hurricanes he can twist and turn the elements of this Earth and create disaster by you like Joshua the high priest the Lord has said an angel of the Lord and we're going to bed about when you finish reading about who is the Angel of the Lord amen he's got your ministers with a flame of fire that Speak Life to protect you amen to walk around you the word that you hear is not the worst of a man but is the Lord speaking and when you receive it into your heart that would become lives it becomes your protection it becomes a barrier which separates you from distraction sudden sickness could have killed you you've now gone with Corona Coronavirus but the Lord didn't allow Corona virus to take you down and you're still here you could have gone with whatever infection that you had car accident wrecks depression some people get depression and the next is what commit suicide but there's something in you you get depressed sometimes you get sick sometimes but there's an uncle a control tower the Holy Ghost baptism the pillar of Fire that holds your heart from committing suicide that heals you from depression that even protected from depression and suppression of the enemy amen said I am the Lord that heals all your sickness and afflictions amen that's how much you are blessed so is that Revelation it is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promise to leave a a good a code of rules but Christ the Bible so Christ is the Bible he's the way that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place is Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be is Christ in you amen that is a revelation that the church was built upon and that's the Revelation that is the church is being built upon now Amen brother cannot live in you I cannot live in you your husband or your wife cannot live in you we can live with you but there's only one person that can incarnate himself in you that is the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen Glory Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord that is what the Lord is trying to do amen amen you want to put his very life in you that you become him that he will become the center of of the Bible through you amen glory to the Lord let's go to the next scripture where is the kingdom of God located where can we locate the kingdom of God just ask Nicole the most came to Jesus Christ he was fishing and hunting for the kingdom of God but he couldn't see the kingdom of God though the kingdom of God was standing right before him if the Lord doesn't give you the spiritual ears and eyes to see the word the word will go through these years and pass through the other year but when the Holy Ghost there's something in you the control tower there's a magnet that can that can magnetize The Onion the metal in you when the word is preached the control tower that captures the word and processes the word by the way of the New Birth by the way of a life that you don't live the old life anymore now your life that you live is a Divine Life of Jesus Christ so Luke 17 20 21 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come remember they didn't ask where but they said when because man is a time being he's always looking for time if I know something's going to happen I want to get ready for it but if nothing is going on let's drink let's have fun let's party everything is just as it used to be but then when he was demanded when the kingdom of God should come he answered and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall he say low here low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you just like Jesus had a question wrong he had the answer wrong now let's see uh the the Francis or whoever asked the question was asking when I want the time to give me the date that year 2022 or year of Our Lord ad 2054 or year 3056 but then Jesus said the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation but the kingdom of God is within you you don't have to worry about time but worry about the source when you get a source everything will congeal into the same thing amen don't worry about when this is going to happen when California is going to sing when it's going to happen that is not Essence but get the kingdom of God in your heart you won't worry about California you're gonna be like Abraham you'll be sitting in a city called Shalom what is the city in in Egypt where the Jews were were living Goshen thank you you'll be living in Goshen and you wouldn't worry about what is going on in Egypt amen Egypt is not your promise God took you from Egypt and planted you in Goshen and taking you to the promised land Canaan Canaan is the Holy Ghost baptism where you can plan when you can take a sword and kill every amalachite every anger every fornication every adultery Every Lie every spirit that is ungodly which is standing on your ground on your land you can take the sword of prayer and of the word and you can consume that Spirit out of your life amen any spirit that has captivated your loved one your children your husband your wife your family your nephew you can take the sword of the word of the word and destroy the amalakad and the jebusite and plant what you want to plant amen because the Lord has made you God like Moses he said Moses I'm going to make you God unto the people and and Aaron will be your Prophet so now the Lord has Moses was born a prophet but the Lord has elevated Moses for me the prophet word to God and Joshua sorry and Aaron who was the high priest to be a prophet and when called you you're a human being but God Elevate you to be a son of the Living God to be a daughter of the Living God to be a Celestial being that can create that can speak into creation and speak out of creation you've got the power and authority to speak two more and Cancers out of creation and you've got their power and authority to speak health and goodness and love and faith and blessing and prosperity and Glory into the lives of people amen that power is laying right on the inside of you but it is the Holy Ghost baptism to bring that power into effect without the Holy Ghost baptism just as Joshua the high priest standing before the Lord and Satan on the right side the power the right side the right hand signifies power the power has been hindered he couldn't manifest you can do all you want but you won't amount to nothing but when the Holy Ghost comes in you don't see Satan sitting on the right side did you see the Lord we begin Satan you don't have to do nothing the Lord has rebuked Satan out of your life and now you go and set others free amen glory to the Lord so the kingdom of God does not come with observation it doesn't come with sin but it comes it's an eternal manifestation of Christ in you as the word is being preached to you and you see the word the word forms is a life form and I'm going to switch here to the ministry amen what God ordained to bring you the kingdom of God let's go to the next scripture if we miss Psalm 104 1-5 say Bless the Lord O My Soul O Lord my God Thou Art very great thou art clothed with Anna and Majesty who covers thyself with light as with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain who lay the beams of his Chambers in Waters who makes the clouds his childhood how can the club be child who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh his angels Spirit his ministers a flaming fire who led the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for forever amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord we can I mean digress on this one but we just want to go to the fourth verse who makes his angels Spirit his ministry ministers a flaming fire what is a fire is the pillar of Fire before the foundation of the world God also then you pastors Apostles Prophet teachers and evangelists to bring you the hand is the object that can touch something and bring it to the head the foot cannot touch the head but the hand can go down and grab the shoe and grab whatever and bring it to whatever to the Head now the hand is the process is the ministry it's the ministering spirit that God has told him for you to take you from your Earthly Dimension and bring you to the celestial dimension that is your faithful Ministry let's clap for the fifo ministry amen [Applause] God bless you over the Jack but I try but I Smiley but uh but uh all of all of you amen by the Jerry brother Clinton and everyone that ministers in songs and in everything amen everybody is very important amen not only the fight for Ministry but every one of you the son the children everyone mothers sisters your prayers is very very very important your prayers go to anoint the FIFA Ministry to do what they're supposed to do without your prayers without Aaron and Joshua holding the hands of Moses Moses was weak and tired Moses couldn't achieve much but when Joshua and Moses held the hand of Aaron held the hand of Moses Israel had a victory and if you hold the hands of your ministers Amen in prayers in whatever support that your pastor your ministers need then you see Victory all around that camp glory to the Lord amen and when we are here when the fivefold ministry is preaching you might not see physically but they are angels around if the Lord will open your Supernatural eyes you see that all these places Angel of the Lord angels of the Lord is around the Bible said that the angels of the Lord and Camp around them that fear his name that call upon his name for forfeiting your you could have taken this time to take your family to the park to go to restaurant if you go to restaurant people are eating and eating and eating and eating right we can that's the only time you have off but for you coming here not not grudgingly but from your own desire your own heart to come and hear the word of the Lord the Lord will recompense you with blessing amen and the Lord does that through the ministry amen the Lord could have chosen their son to preach the word the Lord could have used the moon and the mountains and the stars but the Lord chose weak men to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ men who are just like you amen men that they don't qualify but God calls them and qualifies them there's nobody who qualifies to be a preacher there's nobody qualified to be a prophet God calls them in their unqualified way and God said that this is your certificate go and do my work Moses wasn't qualified he was a murderer Paul was a murderer from his own word he said I'm the least of the Apostles because I wasted wasted means I I persecuted and and killed and chasing the the Disciples of God but he said by Grace I am what I am and I've even worked harder than more than Peter you know he didn't need to see Jesus Christ physically only by Revelation but he said I've worked even more than Peter and Cole who slept with Jesus Christ who done with him so it doesn't matter where you're coming from it doesn't matter your background it doesn't matter the fingers that point at you God those doesn't see those fingers he sees you amen it doesn't matter your accuses amen sister doesn't matter whatever circumstance you are in God doesn't look at the circumstance he looks at your heart and your desires amen he looks at what you are trying to achieve for him trying to raise your children in the fear of the Lord maybe God is going to use your children to to be ministers to be women of God to stand for the Lord Jesus Christ God is looking at that amen it doesn't look at it doesn't look at your bank account you must be as broke as a mouse broke as a cat it doesn't matter you might be living man to month and day by day you might be struggling and hustling to make make ends meet but it doesn't matter to God he's looking at the cut of Jesus Christ in you and sometimes the Lord put us in that situation for purpose it's not the devil no the Lord can drain your pocket drink your wallet drain your prayers so you'll be looking for the coins I need these coins to buy something not for the kids you know but you yourself to buy something you know sometimes get a question to the kids to buy candy no this one mother or Daddy needs the coins they add up you need the cities you know you need a I mentioned city city currency in Ghana sorry you need a dollar bill one dollars to add up to buy something to buy gas to pay some bills to put in a bank account to add up to pay the rent to pay the mortgage God does it for a purpose and he wants you to Rejoice even in that situation [Applause] [Music] don't worry about the devil no the devil is just an executor when you go to court right who give the Judgment the judge who is the one who takes the the what do you call it um who the one who is guilty who taken to jail is it come on Defender thank you what is the defendant if he's found guilty to jail the police the sheriff by Sheriff is just acting on orders of the judge so don't be annoyed with the police or the sheriff don't be annoyed with the Devil that's what I'm trying to arrive at leave the devil alone he's just doing his job that's all he's supposed to do don't worry about the devil leave him alone he's just ordained to do that for you his father is a blessing to you you won't believe him the Devil is a blessing yes without the devil nothing will come out of you you won't grow you're gonna be stagnant and static so the devil has to has to I mean bombard you with all the trials just like the police handcuff you change your clothing give you prisoner clothing but I know that is for a purpose know that you are innocent you never committed any crime you have been put in jail to preach to somebody in jail so Paul was put in jail is that right what came out of it the New Testament or admit majority of the New Testament was written by Paul when he was in jail he was comfortably right in the New Testament and when Mary or James visit just give it to them go give it to church probably you never thought he was going to be a Bible he only knew it was letter to Corinthians the lord gave you something radish to Corinthians the galinians the ephesal church the Hebrew church and so on and so forth and then he didn't know God doesn't show you everything all at once he gives you and shows you what you need at this moment so don't try to use this guy here your little brain to try to figure out what is going to happen tomorrow you just want to give yourself migraine and end up taking pills for them you don't need those migraines just thank God Lord thank you for today thank you for this day when tomorrow comes you take it off tomorrow so he gave me the many things to minister unto you the word of the Lord and when they stand here brother Smiley was ordained before the foundation of the world but I try was ordained before the world began but that threat was so dim before the world began and all those of you Minister and different manners when they stand here the angel of the Lord is with them to minister to you they are the ministering Spirit they are the angel of the Lord to speak angel means a messenger someone sent by God to give a message to you because you are so special you are the Queen of Heaven though you live in this flesh you are the Queen of Heaven you are in the mind of God just think about it don't look at your circumstance amen one time was it a give you a look at the circumstance he said if the Lord is with us then why why are his wonders why are we broke why do we have to plant our corn and have to wake up in the night to go through the corn because of this amalakas and midianites that was the policeman the sheriff who arrested Gideon to bring Gideon to who he was he never have an idea he was a judge no he didn't qualify to be a judge but when the right right time came the Lord showed up and said Gideon go in this might you know God the Lord shed his glory with his children yes he did he said said the sword of Gideon and of the Lord it is they said the sword of the Lord and he gives the sword or jagdav and of the Lord the sort of Keepers and of the Lord the sort of uh uh uh I can't even think now the sort of every one of you put your name there and the Lord amen because Jack capez is Christ the form that he chose to manifest he chose a form to manifest in you Simba before the foundation of the world it doesn't matter what you're going through the Lord allows he puts you in situation to go through that look at Jesus almighty God who can just blink his eyes and millions of angels will come he became a poor person arrested in in a court of uh what's the name no Pharaoh The Herald pilate thank you and being questioned and this is the man who created this man how can the creature question his creator sometimes the Lord lets you go through certain Affliction you understand your job you could be the manager but the Lord will let somebody down there he'll be nagging you and making life stressful for you making you whip tears but you created her and him the Christ in you but the Lord allows it for purpose to bring Divine love out of your heart that you can still pray for the person and forgive them you can still love them just like Jesus love is enemies without that you can show Divine love divine love was planting you before the foundation of the world but they take the trials it takes somebody to hate you without their cause for you to pray for him Without a Cause with love amen and that is where the Lord is bringing us to that way you can laugh even those who don't deserve you can pray for them those who don't deserve to be prayed for you can pray for the small cat on the street you can pray for drug addict you can allow the drug addict you don't condemn them you condemn their sin around them but they are God's creation and you love them with all of your heart and you pray for them and you wish them you a Creator you create them in your heart I don't want to see him on the street drinking and doing drugs when I drive by I pray for those people Lord take him from the streets and bless him with eternal life and bless him with a home and give him a family that is what is in you to do amen the Lord has given every attribute in you and we have to manifest all the attributes amen glory let's go to the next slide it's a weird slide amen spontaneous aiming versus cos amen glory to the Lord amen glory to our Lord we're talking about amines that comes spontaneously from the heart and the aiming that is correct so let's just break it down a little bit when it says spontaneous is something comes as a result of a certain impulse without premeditation without apparent external cause or impulse it's not me telling you that hey you got to say Amen no but out of his heart when the word cookies is hot the aiming comes from his heart and that's what pleases the Lord and then let's look at coercion practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats question involves compelling a party to act in an involutely involuntary involuntary right I miss my British with English reduce the involuntary Americans will say what involuntary help thank you a voluntary manner by the use of threats including threat to use a force against the party it involves a set of forceful action which violate the Free Will of an individual in order to induce a desired response now another sister word is Cooks gently persuading or flattering someone I'll hold hold off to the story of Duncan I'll give that one later amen now when you talk about spontaneous something that comes from your heart that place is the Lord the lord loves spontaneous amen the Lord doesn't want us to force you to say Amen if you don't need to see me don't say it but if it comes let it come from your heart and we the minister so we don't want to force people to say Amen because then you are pleasing if I ask you to say Amen the amen is not unto me it's unto the Lord it's unto the word of the Lord coming to you amen and I'll go a little bit further so let's go to the next slide I'll use parabraham for example glory to the Lord oh okay let's read the scriptures the same scripture in Hebrews was in Psalms and of the angels He said who make it is Angels prayed and his ministers a flame of fire but unto their son is said thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a skepter of righteousness it's a skepta of the of that Kingdom so the angels of the Lord everything is pointing to Jesus Christ the amen is not coming to the minister he's coming to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I'll give you some instances let's go to the slide and I'm not going to read everything I'm I'll just now read a story Abraham was talking about he was in a convention there was this Catholic priest Reverend John S Stanley OSD and I was what is OSD who is this order of Saint Dominic is one of the Catholic branches anyway so this man was at the meeting and everyone was thinking this one is disagreeing with everything that I'm preaching that was in the brahm's mind because the man was just looking at him up and down shaking his head and he was wondering what's going on what's going on in the mind of this man so in William Brown's mind this man was rejecting everything he was preaching let me read a little a little here and on this scripture what caused me to form My Eyes Upon This was something that happened just recently in Phoenix Arizona it was the last day of the service that I was to speak at the International Convention of the four gospel businessman and in this convention there was a visitor with us which was a Catholic bishop which is of the Chaldean rights of the apostolic Catholic Church the most Reverend John S Stanley other of since Dominic he's the Archbishop of Metro Metropolitan United States in a Catholic Church this happened to be his card and his address okay let's go on and so let me read that let me just jump to the the red side and as I was speaking he kept watching me and I thought this that man suddenly is disagreeing with everything that I see and you know you could just see him he would keep his eyes his head up and down but I didn't know what was just exactly working on him let's go to 31. okay 31 you have 31. oh it's at the bottom okay okay let's go oh here we go and then okay and then thinking this man had disagreed with me so much when I raised when I raise up to speak this message I turn in my Bible to find a page let's go further you can read the rest later but let's go to the next slide okay and this Catholic priest got up out of his seat from about 100 clergy men sitting on the platform walk over close to me with all his ropes and gowns and crosses and so forth and godric and got right up close to me and he said my son Be steady God is fixing to move the Catholic priest that he thought he was disagreeing with him when Abraham is why I bought him a Bible his old Bible was torn apart and the wife gave him a a birthday or something Bible but the Bible Pages it was once all the pages were put together and they couldn't start together they couldn't open them and he called brother Jack Moore and he said I think the scripture is in this such and such John 16 but yeah but that's what I'm reading but in a Catholic priest went to himself son God is facing to fix him to speak and and the same service the sister of the Catholic priest spoke in tongues and this Catholic priest if you read further I don't have I didn't bring all the quotes he caught it releases I got it why don't why don't depends because I guided he said I got it and he started jubilating and praising the Lord but Ram told he was disagreeing with everything and it happened to be the preachers sometimes we coerce amens because we think the people are not listening or they are disagreeing but no it's not always so and it's a it's a I would call it tradition that we Heritage in a message that when preaching you have to I demand you amen you guys are not saying amen and I'll give a lot of examples but sometimes you drop something from your heart is the first time people have heard it and they need to be quiet to soak it down in you might be preaching this amen amen Pastor Amen brother and you drop something dead silence all you guys you know you don't agree with me no they need to soak it in their spirit and the Lord want them to soak it in and we have to let them soak it in don't let out coerce aiming from them because if you quest amen you're gonna get that fisher amen it's just like request a woman to love you that love is not love you can cook said to love you with money with Mansions one day she's gonna leave you alone because she didn't love you to begin with you were just coaxing it with money and if you cook the wife of Christ with your with force and threat you're gonna get that feature amen but it doesn't please the Lord the Lord wants us to do everything from our heart just as we the the the congregation don't tell us what we preach they believe that God is dealing with us and we should believe in them that God is dealing with them and we should let the aiming come naturally come spontaneously and that place is the Lord amen and I give an example there was a preacher friend of my pastor and he was preaching one day I think Friday's service preaching and drop it under until funny and amen glory hallelujah amen and he dropped something and it was dead silence he said you guys froze on me he dropped his mic and close the service so after we're taking right together and said but a quick what do you think as a person you froze on yourself they didn't freeze on you because what you drop the Holy Ghost was planted in their Spirit but because we are used to aiming aiming we demand it from the people you felt they froze on you but you froze on them and he said I said I didn't know so we need to do don't don't let us not demand aiming from the people don't let us induce it but let the Holy Ghost because this is the Eternal destination this is whether they hear they're here to be at the other side it is eternal way that God ordained with the preachers to pray to them and it's more important for them to soak it in than saying amen and let me use myself for example sometimes somebody will be preaching one of the minister we're preaching and I'm standing at the back and I just the Lord is dropping things in my others say Amen but I'm listening I want to soak everything because it's aligning even with something I'm going to preach and I want to soak it in so the fact that somebody is not saying amen doesn't Israel means he's disagreeing and the father he said he says amen doesn't mean he or she's understanding right when the seats were open the whole place was like a thunderstorm amen and hallelujahs and glorious and everything and after the service program I think Billy Paul was driving by Brown he said Billy how was the services was fantastic wonderful was awesome you know all the adjectives he could describe and said Billy did you understand he said yes his abilities as the second time has a way of asking you he'll just stare at you and say did you understand say oh my heart sank I said no I think the people understood and said no I can count there are more people just about a couple of them because the assists were not even meant to reveal at that time it was for you and I wow they had it there was a time around was so disappointed after the Seas were open she asked questions and answers and her sister asked Ram can you color your hair I was like we're talking about his suits and coloring he said well sister it's okay he said I don't have any Scripture against that you can if you want to color it depends on your motive he was so disappointed like we're talking about this Dimension breaking and you want to color your hair blue green what has it got to do with it they were saying everybody just pass on top of them even I I know some people that were there when they say preachers and even the preachers they went and they were wet to their home and fight among the preachers themselves they were fighting they went back to the same old Pentecostal preaching that they were preaching it wasn't all the time yet until the right time came that the Lord raised some men and women and began to break the Thunders their seals and all those Revelations to the people of God so when we preach we have to give the people time to soak it in to allow the Holy Ghost to bring it to their heart because something will drop that is their Eternal destination it's a revelation the aiming is not important the law of the Lord is watching them he's standing around watching but they want to soaking their husband and understand because they're going to use that Revelation to live their life something will happen to them they're gonna need that Revelation and so it has to be imbibed in their spirit so that when the time comes God will bring it out and help them in certain situations but then if you get so much enthused with amen I want my amen you didn't say Amen you didn't agree with me then we're gonna prevent them from understanding or soaking the word of God in their heart so let's not let's I think we should get that tradition which was I think it's been a message I was in a funeral where a preacher was upset because a brief person didn't say Amen to his word someone who has lost a family and he was preaching on the Sunday after the barrier this preacher was demanding his amen and this was a senior preacher because that tradition has been the message among the preachers that when you preach and you don't say Amen it means you disagree so a brief person should say Amen somebody was mourning so sometimes we ministers can also be immature we all grow so sometimes let's allow The Sovereign Lord to do what he does it's up to me it's up to reject all the minister to preach what the brothers do and she said that's between them and the Lord Jesus Christ that is not my way to go and see how our sister Jemima is living the the word it's not my it's not my duty just as he doesn't come and see my house how brother is living the life we all have faith in God that God is helping brother Troy but I Smiley brother Jack sister Liz and every one of you brother Jimmy the Lord is helping us so let allow the word of the Lord to be planted in the heart of the people because it's not about brother it's not about brother Jack it's about the Lord Jesus Christ and we see Jesus Christ amen let's look at Moses sometimes Moses got in trouble when the children of Israel even did wrong don't play with anybody's wife even if the man is annoyed with his wife Let It Be him not you remember when Moses God told Moses to speak to the Rock and he got his anger got a better part of him and he strived a rock and the Lord said come here Moses because he was mad with the wife of Christ because of their conduct we are servant just like a European or a son to go and deliver a letter you delivered a letter don't wait for them to open up and tell them read for them that is up to them you were just to serve them later okay ma'am this is a letter from their court or from wherever Bank whatever God bless you goodbye adios go your way so ours is to deliver the message to the people and we trust the Lord who gave us the message it's on the other side connecting them with a message amen Glory Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord let me tell you of the story of the donkey I wrote a donkey me and brother Jimmy have a story about donkey God bless you my pleasure brother that's nowhere now there was a donkey you know the donkey in the Bible who carried Jesus Christ on the Passover before he was crucified right so this donkey it is a story there's no donkeys don't speak so this donkey did what uh did what they did carry Jesus Christ fulfilling scriptures and after that he was standing under a tree very sad and sorrowful and another donkey was passing by saying my friend why are you why are you sad I said well remember what happened to me right I said yes you saw what the women you know when Jesus when I was carrying Jesus majestically and the women were laying their clothes for I mean for me to walk upon this same woman that passing by they don't even say hello to me they despised me they don't look at my face they pretend they don't even know me and the other donkey said no come on just get beside yourself let's go chew some grass he said it wasn't about you [Music] the woman didn't lay their clothes for you you just happened to carry Jesus they laid their clothes for Jesus Christ so come on let's go do our duty let's go get some grass so it's not about me it's not about you it's about the Lord Jesus Christ it means another by the preacher though it looks like it comes to the preacher because you are standing for the Lord Jesus Christ but it's good to the Lord Jesus Christ they are aiming in the world they are not eminent they are aiming the word of the Lord amen so let's put Christ at the center of everything that we do in the preaching in the receiving of the word in our homes in our jobs in our lives in going to bed and in waking up and that will change everything if you make the Lord Jesus Christ the center of everything even in your trials you see the Lord Jesus Christ in the trials and let me use Jesus for example when he was a Pilates Court police said yeah I have the power to release you he said you don't have no power for me if God God was a Christ in him if the purifier in me doesn't allow you to do this this was ordained to be done you don't have no power Jesus didn't accuse pilate he didn't was mad he didn't accuse the devil even he called Judas my friend to do it so the trust that comes our way our ordained of the Lord nothing will happen to a child of God if it did happen to you God ordin it for you to be to happen whether good or bad to bring something out of you regardless of what whatever happened and when you get that understanding the Divine understanding that God has ordained your life and he said I will never forsake you I'll be with you Even In You by the Holy Ghost baptism until the end of the world what world you might die before this Cosmos word get destroyed end of your world your world everybody is a world of his own of her own and a lot has programmed your life and when we get that understanding that whatever God puts you in he does it for a purpose whether Financial family he allow your children to go Wayward because he's made you like an Esther you've got the power to deliver you've got the power to save Esther wasn't just a queen wasn't just to marry the king and become popular and get all the goodies but she was supposed to be a queen the first lady and also a savior to Israel and you God has given the token if Esther who was a natural Queen was able to deliver Israel you are the supernatural Israel and the supernatural Queen you see Jesus Christ and if you see our position in the Lord you can do the greater things that that is written in the Bible God wants us to know who we are he doesn't always want to carry us we want us to just watch us our sons and others he's still in you just like Moses there was that merciful the Lord wasn't with them because you look at circumstances and the Lord in him came and said Moses why cry speak and go forward in your trials if you can worship if you can sing if you can pray if you can rejoice and give thanks to God the trust are no trials you quickly defeat the trials but if you let it weigh on you then the circles that weigh on you then begin to accuse the devil but he's an Executor he's a sheriff and he's doing his word so shall we raise up and offer word of Prayer

vitamins so much we could take from it just even a little uh situation there brother Branham teaching on the seals and he gets a question from a sister about hair and attending her hair and those that was important to her but God at a time like that it might not have been appropriate because of what you were doing in revealing the the the Revelation that you were bringing to the people and father sometimes we miss you because we're doing things that are inappropriate father and we trust Lord that you would help us father to tune in and amen to be on the in on the same page is that that you're on and in the same channel that you're in God that we would always remember from from a Pulpit to the back door God when we're whatever we're doing when it's singing when it's uh praying when it's preaching Lord when it's just sitting in worship Hallelujah God that it's all about you you are the center of all of this and Lord we don't ever want to put the attention on ourselves we want to

done in us and through us and father you will always deserve the glory so father we thank you for the word that we heard here today and God we don't want to be like that donkey sitting around moping
