and as Believers uh we were told God by uh your Prophet that if the people would just believe not even cancer that's what the angel of the Lord specifically called the disease cancer out said not even cancer but stand in the way of the prayer so Lord as Believers we're taking a hold to that same promise that you gave the prophet Lord believing that that was for us oh God so we we placed that promise on our sister Sandra right right now in the name of Jesus and God in between her and her condition we place the blood of the Lord Jesus believing that you were wounded for her transgressions

see the chains are are broken that's uh that's all right brother am wonderful wonderful wonderful appreciate our young people amen thank y'all um we're we we'll go into the word of the Lord for tonight uh I um just um had in my heart just a little something that I wanted to share uh with our young people and one of the things that um uh I want to just say is you know the the Lord certainly has given us uh opportunities to go different places and and preach um to young people and um my uh my thought is that um uh we thank God for that but we also thank God for preaching to the young people at home amen because uh you all are are very very important to me and it's very easy you know for me to uh we got so I I I hate to say it like this but we we have a number of ministers in the church now we used to didn't have nobody but me and uh now we have a number of ministers in the church um and and it's very easy for me just to kind of pull away and just let somebody else kind of take it uh which I enjoy doing it but every once in a while the Lord will inspire me to say something to the young people and uh and I want to do that amen by the grace of God tonight uh so I'm going to just read a scripture uh and um then we will um just just take it from there I want to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 23 Hebrews 11 uh verse 23 uh reads as follows says by faith Moses uh when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season uh verse 26 says esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible amen let's just bow in a word of prayer father we thank you for uh the opportunity to read the scripture Lord and we pray that the Holy Ghost will come and uh make it relevant for where we are right now speak to every heart that as present those that are uh joined online may they receive Lord tonight as well and those that would listen to the uh recording later may they receive as well father from the word is our prayer it's in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you can be seated uh in the presence of the Lord we want to just take amen our title tonight esteeming the reproach of Christ amen esteeming the reproach of Christ and just a little statement here in this um first quote that I want to read out of why are we not a denomination it's a statement that brother brandham makes there and um and and this is really an encouragement to the parents I want to thank the parents for a couple things one is bringing your children to youth service amen and then there are other parents that might not have kids here but you still come and support support amen Our Youth and it makes a big difference amen and um you know the I guess the little uh subtopic that I'm kind of talking uh tonight is on choices and you know when I was coming up we as a young man and and in in church uh for our young people when I was coming up we had uh a choice to make on Friday night uh our pastor established services on Wednesday night Friday night uh Sunday morning and then we we also had Sunday night service amen we had four four Services a week but Friday night was always a little challenge especially when I became a teenager because uh we had to either go to church the choice was either go to church or go to a football game or a basketball game amen whatever sport they were doing at school at the time we have the choice to try to choose which one that we were going to go to and uh I lived in a house where uh my parents made made it a little easy for us to make that choice amen it was uh we knew it was going to church and uh you know and we got to a point where actually uh we it didn't bother us that we were not going to the football game anymore amen I I used to be a football player and and it didn't bother me I didn't play football anymore I was I was okay I was satisfied serving the lord amen I I reached a point in my life where that was I realized that was what I was born to do is to serve the Lord so amen I want to encourage you young people you know the next generation is coming up and y'all have to come to the same same same spot where you realize that serving the lord is everything sir amen it means more than anything this life could ever bring anything you can accomplish if you don't have Christ in the midst of it then it really don't mean much amen so you know we want to encourage you to esteem the reproach of Christ esteem the reproach of Christ this statement here out of the message why are we not a denomination brother brandom is um is is talking to a brother it says it's certainly good brother Jeff to get to shake uh your hand back here and also to hear your boy sing that song and you play I kind of like that the Father and Son don't you like that bring up a child in the way that it should go that's right Mr Gunther uh you know that's what's right both of you look at this statement says bring up a child in the way that it should go now this is important parents have to this is a parents uh responsibility to bring up the child in the way that it should go amen if my parents would have been taking me to the football game rather than taking me to church what are they actually bringing me up in hello right I mean the parents got to be one to make the decision first they got to make the choice which is more important for that child right so my parents didn't take me to the game they brought me to church right bring up a child in the way that he that it should go and when he gets old look at this it'll not depart and that's true there may be some times that he may depart from it amen and and and some of some of some of the older parents here that got uh young adults we see there there may be a time that our children may depart from it but we know what we did when we were younger and when our children was younger we brought them up in the ways of God so there may be there may come times where they may depart from it but it won't depart from him I'm so happy about that when we bring y'all into environments like this I mean you may depart from it someday but this will not depart from you you going to remember these moments that's right and it's it's up to us as parents that create these type of moments for you to remember I love it when we get together in my family we just start talking about church things we did in church remember went to this service we went we went to that and remember brother so and so did this and sister so so did remember I mean that's all we talk about it's it keeps the presence of God around the house Hallelujah bring them up in the way that they should go now they might depart but it won't depart from them and at some point in time that thing will wrestle them and bring them right back to where they need to be Hallelujah brother random said at early training whatever he's been brought up to do it'll certainly stay with him oh my all right all right uh on on Wednesday night brother Quinton Jr did a wonderful job speaking to us expectations and Perfection and uh he made a statement there and you know uh while he was Ministry says weaknesses um the the weakness that we have is the ability to make choices H uh the the weakness that that that's inside all of us is that ability to actually make a choice you actually might think that's a strength but it's a weakness and the reason it's a weakness is because Satan can use that against you Yes actually making the wrong choice and Satan can use that against you making the wrong choice can actually be set you for years it can mess up your life or delay certain things in your life when you make the wrong choice right but he he also made the statement says when we make our choice for God it becomes a strength choice no longer becomes a weakness because we got God in front of us amen and now that Choice becomes a strength now I want to just read a a quote it' be somewhat lengthy here but I think it'll be a blessing to us brother brandom says something to a side of the sermon the choosing of a bride I will read and then I may inject a little bit here and there as we go along and the young people stay with me tonight we're talking about esteeming the reproach of Christ it's a choice to esteem the reproach of Christ Moses made that choice now look at this he says in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself uh is a choice if we have a right to make our own way choose our own way uh that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we're not going to be educated now you know I I've I've I I get the opportunity to uh to work with young people I've worked with them for a number of years and given advice to different ones and you you know and when it comes to education one of the things I like to say especially you you young people living right here in Florida this is one of the most expensive places that you could ever live in the world Florida south Florida right is one of the most expensive places that you could ever live and and often times amen you got to understand that the education is is is is when you when you go get the education what that is it's putting you in position to compete with other people that are going for the same job that you're going for and and when people are going through their resumees you you fill out an application they fill out an application and when they when they when they go through the application they look to see what level of Education different people have and then they start weeding them out well this one got a bachelor okay they going to go the yes P this one don't have a bachelor they go to no power this one got this degree they go in the yes pile this one got this that go in the no pile I was a boss I had to do it that way you have to justify why you making that decision why to hire certain person so sometimes education is what's used to put you in a position so you can compete with other people hallelujah glory to God now I understand School may not be for everybody it may not be but if school is not for you get a trade that's right right but you got to do something to make money right you got to do something to take care of your family right so so School may not be for everybody but you got to find what's right for you and do it to the best of your ability all right all right he goes on to say this he says that choice that we have right and wrong is a choice every man every woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right now brother brandom's son his his his his son Billy Paul just went home to be with the Lord but Billy Paul was a teenager at one time and uh and when he was a teenager he was really getting into some rough things he was getting his daddy was the prophet and yet he find himself getting into things and that I give the parents a little little encouragement right I mean yes your child can go through brother Billy Paul went through I mean he was lying to his daddy about smoking I believe right he's lying lying to him about smoking and his daddy is a prophet and when his daddy son you've been smoking no that son I saw you I saw you out there smoking right I mean so so so no no sist him trying to uh lie about it but but brother brother brother Brandon when he say say Billy I see you doing this I see you doing that now brother brother brandom could not save his son that's right brother Brandon could only pray for his son brother Brandon could do nothing but try to teach his son and one day he told his son stretch your arms out like this yes yes yes it says when he stretch said now look look to look look to to the left he said if you go left you're leaving God you go right you're going the right way you're going towards God he said the further you go left is the further you got to come back right so so you don't want to you when you stretch out like that watch how far you go in this direction because it's going to take that much more to come back in this direction so while you're standing there at the crossroads of life always try to make the right choice make the choice that's going to lead you in the right direction Goden he says this every man woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right esteem and the reproach of Christ esteem and the reproach he says um it's a choice choice is a great thing your Eternal destination is a choice I like that your Eternal dation you got you have to choose whether you're going to serve God or not serve God it's not just because Mama serves God or daddy serves God you have to choose whether you're going to serve God or not serve God it's your choice it's your choice look he says um your Eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you'll spend eternity before this service Ends Tonight there will be one that if you turn God down uh many times there'll be one time that you'll turn them down the last time and when brother Brandon makes that statement my mind goes to this young lady that sat in church she was a Deacon's daughter and um and as she sat in church um brother Brandon was making an altar call and he says you know I just feel like somebody need to come and make their uh make a uh just repent and and make things right with God you know and I he like I I don't want to go further in the service I just think somebody need to come and and he just kept saying kept saying they say sister I think God is dealing with you to come and the the young lady say um I'm not going up there to the altar I'm not doing that you know and and and said have you to know I'm a Deacon's daughter you don't you don't embarrass me like that in front of everybody don't do that to me so she didn't come to the altar well a year later brother Brandon goes through that same city and he's um and he's walking down the street and guess who's on the street that same young lady this time she's not in church this time time she actually walking down the street with a bottle in her hand drinking liquor my God and and and her her she was so bad off that she looked at brother BR say hey preach that's what she call him hey preach say hey preach you like he like uh how can I help you say you remember that night in church that you asked me to come up to the altar yeah I remember say he she he say she say I should have came that night but I didn't want to come I was too embarrassed to come say you want something to drink preach here this young lady that was telling the prophet not to call up that now she's so bad off she's offering the prophet something to drink but brother brandom said don't you know I'm a man of God don't offer me anything like that she's like she's like well preacher I need to tell you something you know that night I should have came to the altar but I didn't and uh and now that I didn't uh you know I'm so bad off my heart is so cold towards God see she made the wrong choice she's way out here now it's hard for her to come back and she got that way and left Le than a year she became that hard in less than a year well here she uh she said my heart is so hard towards God God that I could see my own Mother's Soul frying in hell like a pancake and I would laugh at that brother brandom say sis you shouldn't be you know you you you you you shouldn't be like that she could not find a way to repent to make her make her way back to this this path that she should have been going on she made the wrong choice One Night in church it changed her Eternal destination one time you'll turn God down many times but there'll be one time that you turn them down for the last time there there's a there's a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for man or woman boy or girl to step across that line for there's no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it might be the same it might be it might be the time that many will make their decision where they'll spend the endless eternity let's go on a little further uh brother brandham you know says this in his sermon he said there's another choice that we have in life he says that's that is a life's companion right so we decide on the person that we're going to marry uh we have we have the choice nobody makes you marry nobody it it's it's a choice that you make right he he says a young man or a young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman young young young sisters I want you to always remember that you have the power to make that choice amen I don't care what a young man tells you you don't have to make a choice to get married to him if you if you feel like there's some red flags don't you step into that you wait till them red flags get cleared up amen right but uh but but don't step in and don't feel like you got to make a choice don't feel so sorry for somebody that you got to marry him hello hello don't feel that sorry for him that you got to marry him amen that's not love right so so don't don't get yourself in a situation like that amen you have a right to make a choice a young man has a right young man don't let don't let no young lady force you into to marrying her amen don't don't don't oh you this you remember the story of Samson Delilah she just kept doing all kind of things to get his strength and there young ladies do all kind of stuff to get that boy to put a ring on their finger don't fall for that young man that's right amen praise the Lord right just wait on the Lord sir you all have a choice amen that you can make the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept it or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both men and wom they have a right to Choice also you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here in America so far that you can go to now this is a very good one you get a choice to choose what church you want to go to now brother brand going to help us with something here you know it uh sometimes people don't don't don't don't want to go to a church that preach against their sin right they don't want to go to a church like that they or they want to go to a church that might be a little bit more laxed in other areas Hallelujah right I mean May the pastor ain't going to say nothing against the sisters cutting their hair there or putting on makeup maybe the pastor a going so I I I feel a little bit more comfortable here right but you got to watch that brother B I'm going to say something here amen that helps us out with this because uh uh uh here you know uh he says he says what he says um you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here here in America so far that you can go to that is your own American privilege to choose any church you want to belong to that's that is a choice you don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to it's a choice but if you want if you want to change from Methodist to Baptist or Catholic to Pro Protestant or so forth there is nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church that's that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion and that is a great thing God help us to keep it as long as we can now watch this you have a you also have a choice as to whether uh when you choose this church you can choose whether you you're in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination here is the criteria amen for when you're choosing a church it's not whether they let you do this or that amen will this church help you get to your Eternal destination yes sir I remember brother Mike when he first came to this church years ago he says Pastor don't teach me how to sin I know how to do that already right says I want a church that's going to tell me what's wrong and tell me what's right because I'm trying to make it to Heaven see you need a church that's going to help you get to your Eternal destination are they preaching the word amen amen amen if they're not preaching the word you better run for your life amen all right all right you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or the other church has their Creed and then there then there is the word of God you have a choice of you have to make your choice there's an unwritten law Among Us of choosen I believe it was Elijah one time upon Mount Carmel after the showdown in a great hour of Crisis that we're just about to come to right now perhaps it may be to you or I tonight that we make a choice like the mount carel experience frankly I think it's going on worldwide now but there will soon come a time where that you have to make a choice and I'm not carel the choice was given to children of Israel choose ye this day uh uh uh I mean uh if God if God is God serve him but if baale be God serve him right and they had to come they had to make a choice that which God they were going to follow and and and and Eli just say the god that answered by fire just let him be God and they actually accepted they accepted amen his his his um challenge they accepted it the god that answer about fire kid that's going to be the god well God answer by fire and I don't think the hell to their word they let go of that God later on we all got to make a choice as to whether we're going to follow or not follow there's some things that you can't choose one is you can't choose your family you can't choose your family you were born into a particular family God or orchestrated and ordained that and ain't no sense you getting mad at God about what family you was born into God knows what where where where where the place you can't choose your family you can't choose your height nothing you can do to get taller than what you are amen amen sisters might try to wear heels to get up there but once you take your heels off you're going right back to the same height that you were you can't choose your height you can't choose your height can't choose how many hairs you're going to have in your head and God knows every number of hairs that you got in your head and see you can't choose it you can't choose your genetic makeup amen you are who you are yes sir you can't choose it God God actually planned it for you to be that way you can't say I wish I was I would no no no no no no no you you I wish you were satisfied with who God made you some of the things that you can choose you can choose your friends you can choose who you're going to hang with and who you're not going to hang with right you can choose your church like brother Rand said you can choose your spouse who you're going to get married to you can choose to lie or not to lie yes sir it's a choice uh you can choose to uh you can choose to say yes or no to trouble and you see trouble when it's coming you have a you have a choice where you can say yes to that or no to that yes sir you can choose to serve God or not serve him you can choose to follow God or not follow him these are choices that you can make here we read a scripture and I want you to notice something we read in Hebrews chapter 11 uh we'll go back and and read uh this again Hebrews 11 and I want you to notice a couple things there there's choices been made all through this scripture verse 23 says by faith Moses when he was born was hid 3 months of his parents now the Bible say by faith Moses but we realize it was and Moses making the choice to be hidden it was his parents that made the choice of what to do with Moses in order to hide him from pharaoh who want to kill all the children right so you got to have parents that'll help you make the right choice right by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were they were they were not afraid of the king's commandments so it was moses' parents that decided to put him in the Nile River and send him down the river not knowing what was going to happen with their decision watch this watch this by faith Moses when he was come to years this is a choice that he made I like this when he from when he when when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter so now uh just in between those two verses there's a lot that happened in Moses life right one of the things that happens is that when his parents release him into the River somehow God orchestrated that that basket would end up right in Pharaoh's Court Pharaoh's daughter got hold his basket and took Moses as her own child went looking for a a a a nurse to raise his child and hired Moses's mother as the nurse to raise the child in Pharaoh's heart I house I like this that Pharaoh I mean Moses mama got paid to raise her own child that's right God know how to do things she made the right choice as she's raising Moses and teaching him the things of God she has this ability to seow certain seeds in Moses as he's coming up and she's telling him what his true identity is that he's not a son of pharaoh but I'm your real mother right and and and your father's amram but but you we had to we had to do this because of the Edict of the king that they were going to kill all the B this is why we had to do this but Moses God is in control it's okay well here Moses gets to a point of life and he's raised as Pharaoh's son Moses is next in line to become the next Pharaoh he he has he has everything that the world can offer him it is in his hands but Moses makes a choice sir by faith of Moses when he come to years maybe as a teenager he refuses to be called the son of a Pharaoh's daughter Moses makes this Choice I'm I'm not Pharaoh's da I mean I'm not I'm not you're this is you're not the mom but this is my mother over here I am a Hebrew I'm not an Egyptian I'm a Hebrew and as as young people you got to come to a spot where you realize I'm not in this world all right I'm not I'm I'm not I'm not like them I'm a Christian and it's not my mama's a Christian or my dad's no I'm a Christian right and the reason I don't do this I don't do that is because I'm a Christian not because my mama said don't do it and my daddy said don't do it and my pastor said don't no I'm a Christian that's why I don't do these things you have to you have to esteem the reproach of Christ look at this the next verse amen verse 25 says choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and I think I I I mentioned this early when you come to Christ actually things get harder not easier but you have to make the choice that I'm going to follow Jesus amen no matter what it looks like no matter what it feels like no matter what comes against me I'm still going to follow Jesus sir and sometimes God allows you to go through certain things in your life because all of us think that it's supposed to be a flower bed of ease as Christians that's not true if Jesus had to go to a cross what you think we going to have to go through verse 20 26 I'm sorry uh yeah yeah verse 26 notice the the verse here EST steeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for you have respect to the recompense of the reward and just bear with me just for a moment here two esteem is to respect or to admire I want you to get this to admire the reproach of Christ I I you know young people sometimes we admire the wrong things we admire other kids that are in the world and some of the things that they're getting and and some of the things they're we admire that we admire that young lady that's getting all that attention or that young boy getting all that attention we admire that but we admire the wrong things we're supposed to admire the sufferings of Christ yes sir the reproach of Christ we're supposed to admire that yes sir look at this reproach is is scoffs for the sake of Christ or that means to be picked on to be picked at not accepted by the world sometimes not accepted by your friends and sometimes not even accepted by your family Moses chose to be not accepted by everybody else in order to be accepted by Christ yes sir and young people you have to choose to to be not accepted by others in order to be accepted by Christ that's true amen we esteem the reproach of Christ watch the words here though the Bible says esteeming the reproach of Christ and here's the the the the thing about this Christ was not even born at the time Moses was born Moses was on the earth well before Jesus Christ ever came to the Earth right but yet the scripture says that he esteemed the reproach of Christ in Moses day when he was making his choice when he chose not to follow the ways of Egypt that I'm I'm not Pharaoh's uh daughter's son I am I'm amram and yosh's son I am a child of God I'm an Israelite I'm not an Egyptian when Moses made that choice he was saying he was he was esteeming the reproach of Christ even though Christ had not been born at that time the reason that he can the the Bible can say this because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and every choice that was being made in the Old Testament by different followers they were esteeming the reproach of Christ and let me tell you something when we make a choice to follow Christ in this day we're also doing the same thing mes mes did we esteem the reproach of Christ I'm not talking about serving God because your mama served God or your daddy served God or your pastor serve God I'm talking about you having your own personal relationship with God and it don't matter how old you are how young you are you can have a personal relationship with God am amen here we look at uh just a few examples in scriptures and you know it wasn't just Moses here I like I like this brother random just made a statement way back in Moses time it was still Christ that scripture it was still Christ that's why the bible say that but uh Adam and Eve when they made a choice to eat from the the Tree of Life they had the choice to either eat from the Tree of Life or the tree of knowledge good and evil God told them not to eat from that tree but they had the choice and uh if they M if they ate from that tree of knowledge good and evil then it would bring death into you know and and and and we're all experiencing that now but uh when they had the ability to eat from the Tree of Life that was actually eating from Christ they had the ability to eat from Christ and always have I mean just you talk about having life and life more abundantly it's only when you serve God that you get that type of life I've seen many many in my day that have uh left the Lord and and they thought they was doing good on their own for a good while it seemed like they was going very well but you talk I'm going tell you something that the scripture says the way of a transgressor is hard somebody going against the word of God life will it may seem like it's going good but somewhere that scripture going to catch up with you it might take years but that scripture going to catch up with you and and the way of transgressor going to become really really hard you're going to be trying to figure out what is going on is right there in the word you transgressing against God's word now life has to be hard for you can't make ends meet amen look Adam and Eve had to make a choice Abraham when he chose to to leave the land of ER and dwell in the plains of mam he made a choice and that choice was for Christ you see we can say that because lot had to make a Cho choice at that time too and lot made a choice where he like I ain't dwelling here in the plains of mam I want to go down here to the city of Sodom I want to go to gamorra and lot looked at the lights of the city he thought oh man this is so great but did not realize the impact it would have on his family later on young people the choices that you're making right now are going to have impact on your family later on you seow seeds for what's going to come up after you oh yes sir that's right and now now when lot went down there and and I don't know the Bible does not tell us this we don't know whether lot had children when he went down into Sodom we don't know that but what we do I mean him and his wife went down there that's all that we probably got but but we don't know about him having children maybe the children were born in Sodom and they were born in a certain condition they were B born in a certain situation and when the children been born like that in that situation it impacted them they had some real problems yes sir and in their house but it was because a daddy made the wrong choice it affected his wife his wife was so bad you know brother brandom actually said that lot had grandchildren that died in Sodom Lord and I was trying to figure out how do he have grandchildren where where you know and and and and but when you go back you read the scripture because we know that the the angel got lied out and his and his two daughters came out and um uh but the wife she actually turned and looked back and when she turned and looked back she turned into salt right so how did how did he have grandchildren well the Bible actually say the angel went down there and uh uh to lot to try to get lot out and it says do you have here Sons and Daughters now why would the angel ask about Sons if he only knew he had daughters but the angel asked do you have sons and do you have daughters so lot has some sons that didn't come out oh they made the wrong choice you see it's all about esteeming the reproach of Christ you know what you might be picked at you might be picked on but that's actually a blessing when that happens to you that that actually you know according to the scrip this definition I just read you you know we're supposed to admire that not be ashamed of it we're oh I got picked on for being a Christian Christian Glory that's right amen I mean you so you should C you you know what happened to me today they picked on me for being a Christian yes sir that's something you should get excited about brother you know not picked on you because you did something crazy but picked on you for being I'm a Christian they see me as a Christian you're supposed to admire that yes sir when you look back in scripture I mean the fellas in the new test that was in jail Paul Silas Peter all them went to jail for being Christians you in good company when people picking at you when you're esteeming the reproach of Christ Joshua when he told the people choose you this day whom you'll serve they he was esteeming the reproach of Christ when Elijah challenged the children of Israel to remain just to stop uh being halted between two opinions uh choose between God and baale when he he was he was being he was esteemed for the reproach of Christ Ruth when she chose to go with Naomi Ruth was esteeming the reproach of Christ I love Ruth's decision Ruth was Ruth was come along with another daughter-in-law had they had the same testimony up to a certain point yes sir you married an Israelite we're both moabites you married an Israelite I married an Israelite your husband died my husband died they had the same testimony up to a certain point right and when it's time to make a decision about going back into Israel this is where Ora showed that she was not part of it true but Ruth when when neom said why don't you just leave I can't have no more children to have you get married to nobody I I mean I'm I'm too old just just leave go back to your parents just like no no no no no where you go I'll go your people going to be my people and and I like the the the the real click the real uh Clincher your God will be my God and I'm going tell you young people I'm going to tell you something what really makes your parents proud is when you come to your to to that decision in your own life where you can tell Mom and Daddy you're God oh my it's going to be my God hallelujah I'm going to serve him the way that you serving him I'm going to live for him the way that you're living for him you ain't going to have to make me do this no more I do this because I love him and I know he loves me Jesus chose to suffer the afflictions when he went to a cross here um oh my I want to just line up this uh I think quote out of leadership yes leadership let me just read two things for you young people I want to encourage you I I was I had the privilege the other night to just kind of share uh we we went out for a little fellowship and all of us are just sitting around sharing our testimonies of how we came to the Lord and um and I was telling them that you know I've been raised in church for uh really long time pretty much all my life but I never really come to a spot where I was had given my heart to the Lord Jesus and um I remember going to church one night and we watched a film called The Burning hell and they were just showing what hell was going to be like and I looked at that that that that movie and I said oh I don't want to go there I don't want to go there I went to the altar that night and I called myself getting saved I thought I was I was scared so I went up there and prayed prayer that they told me to pray but I still left the church went out doing the exact same sins I was doing before I went to the altar still struggling in my life well one night I was at work I was working for Publix at the time and uh and while I was working at Publix we had to take uh groceries out to the car you know for some of the different you know customers that would come there was always this one lady that would come through and all of us would avoid taking her groceries out we knew that lady was going to witness to us if if we went out took her groceries out and she I remember she was elderly lady probably in her 80s worked for uh Salvation Army and uh and that night there were no other bad boys but me and here she comes to the line and I can't Dodge her now I just got to take her groceries out so I I got her groceries bagged them took them out and uh she always had a little quarter that she was going to give you you know as a little tip take this little quarter thank you I can't buy nothing with this quarter but thank you anyway but uh but she would take us she would she she would go out but when I went out there that night she says uh young man do you do you know the Lord Jesus as your savior I said um um no ma'am but I do go to church she says no I'm not talking about going to church do you have a relationship with the Lord Jesus and young people this is my question to you do you have a genuine relationship with the Lord Jesus I'm not talking about going to church do you have a genuine relationship with the Lord Jesus she asked me that question I said no ma'am I she said she said but I can introduce you to Jesus right here I said um I said she said you want to be introduced to him I said I said no ma'am I'm okay she says I want you to know something you don't have to wait till you go to church to give your heart to the Lord you can give it to give your heart to the Lord right here in this parking lot yes ma'am thank you put our groceries in the car I went on back inside the store and when I finished um you know putting the groceries in what she said to me just kept ringing just kept ringing kept ringing you can give your heart to the Lord right here you ain't got to wait till you get home get to the church you can give your heart right here and I went I I I I I just couldn't get her get her her words out of my mind so I decided I'm going to go out here and get some carts and when I went out there to round up some carts I went out there I was let I was pretty much let them know I'm going to get carts but in my heart I was going up there to talk to the Lord Jesus and I went out there to that parking lot and I got them carts and I asked the Lord Jesus to come into my heart forgive me of all my sins and Lord wash me from that and just give me a desire I want to serve you I want to live for you I want to I want to do all I can for you and I I can I can go back to that moment and say this is when I know Jesus came into my heart young people I want to I want to you have to come to a spot where you've made a choice it's not Mama's decision it's not daddy's decision not nobody making you do it but as you come into the spot where I want to serve him myself your God will be my god brother random says this in the message leadership he says you know when it got big no hold on one second that's not what I let me just see something here that's not the um I'm sorry I I I missed uh I misplaced something that I had here um I'll just have to quote it from the top of my head it's one that I love reading but I just have to quote it from the top of my head brother random says because of choices that you make even tonight 5 years from now a choice that you make to either serve God or not serve God would affect your life 5 years from now 5 years from now you could you could be in a bar he says you can be in a bar cleaning astres he could use the word spatoon SP p i t t o o NS I believe uh he says you can be there cleaning spatoon 5 years from now it says or you can be the greatest uh blessing to the body of Christ Christ because you made a choice let me tell y'all young people something you know you you look here tonight just a few of us but from this few from this few the world can be changed amen amen TR the world can absolutely be changed one night there was a a preacher went to church he wanted to have a Revival this lady wanted to have a Revival in the city she say yeah I need a preacher to come and have a Revival in the city and she brought this preacher in and they gave out Flyers all over the city but when they went to church only one fell showed up to church one the preacher got up there and preached that there was a house full of people and at the end of the sermon he invited he opened up the Altar and the one fell came up to the Altar and gave his heart to the Lord that preacher had no idea who that young man was cuz later on that young man because of the decision he made that one night in church that young man amen has has turn the world upside down and y'all turn on the radio sometime and y'all listen to Moody Bible Institute well that man's name was Dwight Moody he was the one that came to church the only one showed up in church one night one person can change the whole world you all have no idea where God will take y'all from here you don't know where God will take you you want to be ready for where God want to take you and it all come from making the right choice some of you all I I've watched uh here in our church I mean I'm I'm blessed I was telling one of the sisters you know um we I I we we I'll say some of these things um I know Sister teres has given been given a platform to just kind of sing before uh people in in the choir and with that platform is it goes all over the world all the way down and in

Brother Joseph oh that brother's a real blessing to me you don't know who you're blessing and it's just a few of us but the world is being changed by what happens right here we got to take what we're doing seriously esteem the reproach of Christ let me tell you something since the world is being changed you know the devil don't like you and the devil's going to try to do something in your life to to to disrupt and upset the plan of God because if you go down it causes other people oh yes to go down oh yes yes sir a Sting the reproach of Christ brother random was in a meeting one time this brother was so inspired by what brother random preached that night and he said I just got to go and compliment him and when he went to shake brother brandom's head say and said that could have been like the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation now it's only 22 chapters there but he was just trying to make a compliment and when he open his mouth to make this compliment all of a sudden the man took off in unknown tongues when he did there was three L three people there lady and think two other men and they come say that's not unknown tongue that's perfect French well he didn't know French Danny Henry Henry didn't know French he said that's perfect French he brother R said okay okay you write down what he said you write down what he said you write down what he said all three of them came back together and gave brother random the note of what the man said without talking to each other it was exact on all three occasions and this what was said to brother Brandon and I leave this with you because thou has has chosen the harder way I like this this is the precise and correct way because it's my way what a glorious decision you've made because of this because of this because of this decision that you made a large portion of Heaven awaits you and this in itself is that which will make and bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine brother brandom had to make hard choices he chose to leave a church that he was ordained at and they told him he have to ordain a woman preaching say I can't do that that's against the word of God and he had to make a choice to stand for the word or go with the p has to say he had to make a choice he left and God said because you made that choice yes it was hard you had to leave a lot of friends you had to forsake a lot of people but you esteem the reproach of Christ greater than anything else that hard way you know what God said that's my way and because you choose my way the hard way this in itself is what's going to bring and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine you people I encourage you esteem the reproach of Christ I want to pray I want to pray I want to pray I want to pray just bow your heads and um I I do want to just offer this if there's any of my young people that would want to just come and stand here with me tonight and say brother Jack I heard the word I I want to make my choice

the enemy um doesn't like them his job is to steal kill and destroy but Lord our job amen is just present Christ to them that they would make choice to serve you and to follow you all the days of your life realize that they are some are in situations that they can't control it wasn't their choice that put them where they are but Lord what they can't control is how they respond and react to where they are my prayer father that you would give them power and strength to overcome the enemy realizing that you have designed every trial because you know Lord that we will overcome you'll never give us more than we can bear I trust oh God that young people these young people doesn't matter how few or how many Lord each one is so important to you that you would want a sermon like this preached to

we praise you we thank you it's in Jesus name we pray pray amen amen esteeming the reproach of Christ amen we just say God bless you uh young people let me just read you one scripture musicians can make their way forward uh turn with me to Deuteronomy 30 [Music] um I'll just start at verse 11 here children of Israel also had to make a choice it says this it is not in heaven that thou should us say who should go up for us to heaven and Deuteronomy 30 and verse 11 I'm sorry I was at verse 12 all right for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far from neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should us say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it see I have set before thee this day life in good death and evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it but if thine heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away in worship of gods and serve them I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that you shall not prolong your days upon the land whether thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it verse 19 is a very important verse I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God that thou mayest obey his voice that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land
