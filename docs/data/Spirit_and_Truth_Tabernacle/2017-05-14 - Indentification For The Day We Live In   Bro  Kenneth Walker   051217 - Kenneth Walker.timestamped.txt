[37:01] more healing and I do salvation that's
[37:03] the truth God's word cannot
[37:05] change we're living in a day and hour
[37:08] when the powers of Darkness everywhere
[37:11] is around the children of God we're like
[37:13] the IND dangered species tonight the
[37:16] devil's out trying to put all your light
[37:17] out trying to put you to the ground
[37:20] that's right but that's not God's plan
[37:22] for you now they got a little church
[37:25] next door but they don't know what you
[37:27] know
[37:28] huh they don't know what you know and
[37:31] they can't know what you know and except
[37:33] God reveals it to them is that right but
[37:36] we're going to look to the word of God
[37:38] tonight just good to be here and I just
[37:40] thank God that brother Jack has asked me
[37:42] to come by this way again and I'm here
[37:45] for one
[37:46] purpose I just leave Le it out and tell
[37:49] it like it
[37:50] is not trying to win no popularity
[37:54] contest amen we come to church it's life
[37:57] and death amen we when we come what we
[38:01] hear what we do with
[38:03] it you're going to be held responsible
[38:05] for it amen and so that's the way it is
[38:08] but if you got your Bibles turn with me
[38:10] this real familiar scripture to Matthew
[38:13] the
[38:14] 16th
[38:16] chapter and I got a little something
[38:18] here tonight just want to try to get
[38:20] along to people and get us to understand
[38:23] something maybe a little bit deeper than
[38:25] what you would think it is
[38:27] and so God uh we're in there when the
[38:30] mysteries of God has been made
[38:32] known there is not everybody can even
[38:36] preach
[38:37] it anybody would hear God's voice in day
[38:40] that we're living in be hearing the same
[38:42] thing you're
[38:43] hearing but because they turn down God's
[38:46] voice God's Prophet they cannot hear
[38:48] what we're saying in this hour Matthew
[38:51] 16 let's look at the 13th verse down
[38:55] through 20
[38:58] when
[38:59] Jesus came unto the coast of cesary of
[39:02] Philippi he asked his disciples
[39:05] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[39:09] man
[39:10] am they
[39:12] said some say that there are John the
[39:15] Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah
[39:19] or one of the
[39:21] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[39:24] ye that I am in other words they they're
[39:27] guessing about this thing they're just
[39:29] wonder who you
[39:31] are huh he said but whom say you that I
[39:36] am what do you
[39:38] think who do you think I
[39:41] am and Simon Peter and said there are to
[39:44] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[39:48] answered and said to him blessed are
[39:51] thou Simon bar for flesh and blood has
[39:54] not revealed it unto thee but my father
[39:57] which is in heaven he could Peter could
[40:00] not have known
[40:03] him except it was revealed to him by
[40:09] revelation God gave him a revelation of
[40:12] who he was
[40:15] amen now let me just say it like this
[40:18] Jesus could be right among

[40:36] now but I say unto thee that thou art
[40:40] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[40:44] church and the gates of hell should not
[40:46] Prevail against
[40:48] it now and I will give unto thee the
[40:51] keys to the kingdom of

[1:00:26] your faith or your Revelation faith is a
[1:00:30] revelation fail you

[1:00:38] the pressure comes down huh regardless
[1:00:42] of what comes amen your faith cannot pay
[1:00:46] you God has prayed for you amen that
[1:00:49] that revelation of who you are huh now
[1:00:55] watch this
[1:00:56] amen and when the day of Pentecost come
[1:00:59] and they were waiting for the promise of
[1:01:01] the father in The Upper Room amen and
[1:01:04] the Holy Ghost fell
[1:01:07] amen Peter stepped up fire and having
[1:01:10] the keys to the
[1:01:12] kingdom and he said
[1:01:14] hey I'm going identify what this
[1:01:17] is this is what the prophet joah spoke
[1:01:21] about that how in the last days God pour
[1:01:23] their Spirit oh men uh dreamed dreams
[1:01:26] and young men see visions and these
[1:01:28] things in other words this is what it is
[1:01:31] now listen he is a dentify the
[1:01:34] scriptures that joah had talked about it
[1:01:37] might been hundreds of years but there
[1:01:40] was a certain
[1:01:42] people that was in a certain position
[1:01:45] that was going to receive the word of
[1:01:47] God Amen can you say Amen there are
[1:01:51] things that people could not do listen
[1:01:54] the church there was people could not do
[1:01:56] the same thing today if we went back to
[1:02:00] Luther he could only come so far Wesley
[1:02:03] could only come so far Pentecost could
[1:02:05] only come so far but the people of that
[1:02:08] day were identified with the move of God
[1:02:11] for that day but God was calling for
[1:02:14] something else amen because the Catholic
[1:02:17] church has got them away from being uh
[1:02:20] of the casting out devils and healing
[1:02:22] the sicks amen they had got them way to
[1:02:24] just having a form in a fashion but
[1:02:27] brother God had to restore back that
[1:02:30] church can't start one way and end some
[1:02:33] way amen they were all of One mind and
[1:02:36] one Accord when the church started and
[1:02:38] they all had all things in common hey
[1:02:41] but when Peter and John went by the gate
[1:02:43] called Beautiful after they had received
[1:02:46] the Holy Ghost they were be identified
[1:02:48] as somebody else that lame man that lame

[1:03:22] in me and you yes amen God's not on a
[1:03:25] journey God just waiting for us to come

[1:10:03] wasn't I know why y'all laughing you
[1:10:06] mind not tried what I tried but you

[1:10:16] Denver was going to try to play Hopalong
[1:10:19] Cassy something with a loaded gun
[1:10:22] instead of that he's going to be a
[1:10:24] Chester the rest life he shot his
[1:10:26] kneecap off there you
[1:10:29] are they're trying to find something to
[1:10:32] identify thems with and the reason
[1:10:34] they're doing it is because there's
[1:10:36] something in them that God made them
[1:10:38] that way listen but God made them to be
[1:10:42] example to be identified with and that
[1:10:45] was when he made Jesus Christ to become
[1:10:48] Our Savior there's the example that's
[1:10:52] what people should want to be as a
[1:10:55] identify g with Jesus to be like him to
[1:10:59] be have that kind of
[1:11:02] identification anybody can be a
[1:11:04] churchgoer that's anybody can claim
[1:11:08] anything but there just a few that can
[1:11:10] produce the life of Jesus
[1:11:14] Christ hallelujah
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:18] now let me let me skip this because I
[1:11:21] want cut down a little bit on something
[1:11:23] but I want hit you with this in here
[1:11:26] because it's just it's so
[1:11:30] plain in Christ is a mystery of God
[1:11:33] reveal brother Ram said the new
[1:11:37] birth is Christ it's a revelation amen
[1:11:42] now I want to tell you what the prophet
[1:11:45] said he say you ought to pray for
[1:11:47] Revelation more than you pray for
[1:11:50] anything
[1:11:51] else and if I ask you to show uh how
[1:11:55] many pray for Revelation today would
[1:11:57] hold your hand up I wonder how many else
[1:12:00] hold up her hand but he said you ought
[1:12:02] to pray for that more than you pray for
[1:12:04] anything
[1:12:06] else huh
[1:12:09] okay that's just a little smack huh on
[1:12:12] the hands for all of
[1:12:16] us huh we either going to do it or not
[1:12:19] do it that's right brother Bram
[1:12:22] said there Rapture in faith in this
[1:12:26] message
[1:12:28] huh something put you out of
[1:12:31] here you want to be identified with this
[1:12:34] brother this is going to take you out of
[1:12:37] here now it's a revel God has revealed
[1:12:40] you this great mystery and that's a new
[1:12:43] birth now what are you going to do when
[1:12:45] you get all that group together where
[1:12:46] the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony
[1:12:49] and God expressed it through his word
[1:12:51] but the same action the same thing that
[1:12:54] he did make the word manifest oh if the
[1:12:57] church only knew his
[1:13:00] position it will one day then the W will
[1:13:03] go when it knows what it is yes and he
[1:13:07] says here you know now you see there's
[1:13:10] therefore there's no school no
[1:13:12] Theologian no teaching of the Bible
[1:13:14] among any school that know anything
[1:13:15] about it they cannot know nothing about
[1:13:18] it it's impossible for them to know
[1:13:19] anything about it God has hid the senses
[1:13:23] of knowing it from ever elected teachers
[1:13:26] and everything else it's a personal
[1:13:28] individual prayer with that person that
[1:13:31] Christ has revealed to them and if you
[1:13:35] say he has been revealed to me in the
[1:13:38] life of Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ produced here in that Bible the
[1:13:43] same life was in him doesn't produce
[1:13:46] itself in you in you then you got the
[1:13:49] wrong Revelation all right all right
[1:13:53] amen God's word can out fa brothers and
[1:13:56] sisters amen what kind of appetite we
[1:14:01] got those in hunger and thirst after God

[1:17:52] stay here
[1:17:57] if it's that way now what's it going to
[1:17:59] be
[1:18:00] tomorrow go God said years ago he said
[1:18:03] this thing going to raply get worse and
[1:18:05] worse and worse he said it and we're
[1:18:08] living right now in what he
[1:18:13] said you
[1:18:16] know I'll tell you how great this
[1:18:20] is you know your identification
[1:18:26] as a star from
[1:18:29] Heaven did you know you're identified as
[1:18:31] a star praise the Lord
[1:18:34] huh
[1:18:35] absolutely and you know that star is
[1:18:38] identified on Earth in
[1:18:41] you ask about Joe Where Were You Joe huh
[1:18:45] when the sons of God shouted for Joy huh
[1:18:48] in the morning St who are we we're a
[1:18:52] star from heaven
[1:18:55] don't want to be don't be be Elvis
[1:18:58] Presley cuz I think he's looking up from
[1:19:00] being down but hey man we're up looking
[1:19:04] down huh all right because we'
[1:19:08] represented in heaven now you said well
[1:19:10] this is strange yeah it's a mystery it
[1:19:12] was to be revealed where I came from
[1:19:14] where you came from and if I know where
[1:19:17] I came from then I know where I'm going
[1:19:19] back
[1:19:20] to w we well
[1:19:24] we're being identified in this day and
[1:19:26] there for sure you
[1:19:27] know and
[1:19:30] so brother B said in every Church age
[1:19:33] the people were identified with the
[1:19:35] messenger and his
[1:19:38] message now look at Paul he's brought
[1:19:43] under G camea educated know the law from
[1:19:46] A to
[1:19:48] Z but when he when that pill were far
[1:19:52] come to him the God spoke to him
[1:19:55] brother Paul said you
[1:19:59] know I count it all
[1:20:02] done he's brought up G all all that
[1:20:06] education I got all that what good has
[1:20:08] it done me and I just count as a bunch
[1:20:11] of dung that I might know
[1:20:17] Christ so he was willing to give it up
[1:20:20] what he
[1:20:21] knew didn't mean nothing to him he
[1:20:24] wanted to know Jesus Christ
[1:20:27] amen amen
[1:20:30] so even the people in that day would
[1:20:34] have plucked out their eyeballs and give
[1:20:36] it to him he was so much like Jesus
[1:20:40] Christ huh and look here what happened
[1:20:44] in our day people thought brother Brown
[1:20:47] was Jesus Christ because of the life
[1:20:50] that he
[1:20:51] manifested they seen that life that a
[1:20:54] identification that was in them and they
[1:20:57] know that identification only God could
[1:21:01] do those things can you say
[1:21:03] Amen now we are supposed to be
[1:21:06] identified with that same God living in
[1:21:09] us we're not prophets or anything but
[1:21:11] the same life should be in US Lord
[1:21:16] instead of letting the devil trample on
[1:21:18] us we order be trampling on the devil a
[1:21:20] little
[1:21:21] bit amen now
[1:21:26] we find here Revelation 3 and and 20
[1:21:31] said Jesus said behold I stand at the
[1:21:34] door and
[1:21:35] knock If any man this is to the age now
[1:21:39] they were Rich had need of
[1:21:45] nothing but if any man hear my voice and
[1:21:48] open the door I will come into him and
[1:21:53] will SE with him and he with me to him
[1:21:57] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:21:59] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[1:22:03] and have sat down with my father in his
[1:22:05] throne now talking about
[1:22:08] overcoming brother Bram said that God
[1:22:11] overcomes for you all right all right
[1:22:15] now what to go when I was talk about the
[1:22:17] three
[1:22:18] crucifixions I never La I never
[1:22:20] mentioned the last crucifixion
[1:22:25] but there's three
[1:22:27] crucifixions amen when When They
[1:22:30] Crucified the word of God when the
[1:22:32] opening of the
[1:22:34] seals where's the last crucifixion that
[1:22:36] brother
[1:22:37] W in me and you right because it's a
[1:22:41] word that's going to be crucified all
[1:22:43] right now huh you know I hate to be
[1:22:47] tough on you
[1:22:49] but it's you know right they of your own
[1:22:53] households you enemy is what the Bible
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:22:59] says how many of of a family you know
[1:23:04] how many you know you might had a family
[1:23:06] of 20 25 you know but how many of that
[1:23:09] family that knows anything about what
[1:23:12] you know
[1:23:13] about what makes you
[1:23:16] different
[1:23:18] huh and what they'll do now I know you
[1:23:22] get F them but what they do
[1:23:25] I'm down the road tooo I'm in the same
[1:23:27] same
[1:23:29] thing they don't like to get around
[1:23:33] you because they don't hear what you got
[1:23:35] to say come on now because if you're
[1:23:37] children of light and they of Darkness
[1:23:41] huh they don't want that light to show
[1:23:43] in where they're living at right exactly

[1:57:51] it's so important we as Believers uh
[1:57:54] begin to recognize who we are uh in in
[1:57:57] Christ one of the things he says that
[1:57:59] when we realize who we are it makes the
[1:58:01] devil mad right makes the devil mad I
[1:58:04] think uh Satan is always trying to put
[1:58:07] blinders on us uh from just just
[1:58:10] recognize the power and authority uh
[1:58:13] that actually dwells already in US
[1:58:15] quoted that quote from the church ages
[1:58:17] don't fear Little Flock all my power is
[1:58:19] yours and I just begin to just really
[1:58:22] meditate on that sometimes it's so good
[1:58:24] you hear things like that just sit back
[1:58:25] and think about what what what was the
[1:58:27] power that was in Jesus uh what were the
[1:58:29] things that he did while he was on the
[1:58:31] earth and you know if all that power was
[1:58:34] in him is now in us and church what we
[1:58:36] worried about right amen like like like
[1:58:39] like God told Moses don't cry speak
[1:58:43] that's all you do you don't cry you
[1:58:45] speak because all my power uh is yours
[1:58:48] amen it dwells on the inside of you
[1:58:50] right I thank God for that I I really
[1:58:53] really thank God for that uh so many
