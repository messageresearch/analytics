[25:24] scriptures say the kingdom of God
[25:25] suffered the violence and the violent
[25:27] take it by force they were saying the
[25:29] reason that it was such a you know a

[25:44] of God was suffering violence and I said

[29:12] is still working on me
[29:15] Amen names who you notice just double
[29:22] always fighting him this is a kind of a
[29:26] different type of battle that I'm not
[29:31] quite used to so you know pressure I've
[29:34] never been one to be nervous not too
[29:37] much in front of people but uh I know
[29:41] when you're bringing the word for his
[29:43] bride it's a little different you know
[29:45] you taking a look very serious so it's a
[29:50] different kind of pressure so I
[29:53] definitely solicit your prayers and the
[29:57] devil is constantly fighting and giving
[30:02] you my best room one time I didn't know
[30:04] what the ministers to be referring to
[30:08] what I cannot know it's a it's a battle
[30:13] amen so I just pray that uh something to
[30:17] be said to encourage your hearts
[30:24] to strengthen you a man that we may see
[30:31] the hour in which we're living in and
[30:34] have a better understanding of a man him
[30:40] in this hour
[30:41] just leave encouraged and uh am I ready
[30:45] to do battle it's ready to do battle you
[30:48] know so we definitely live in a time you
[30:52] know we're in a in a great battle a man
[30:55] the Satan desired to be to hinder and to
[31:04] confuse people and it lifts up himself
[31:09] anything that above above God a man and
[31:15] that's that's what he's trying to do
[31:16] when a men and and we're doing just the
[31:19] opposite so there's always been a great
[31:23] contention a man and we just want to be
[31:29] able to a man be encouraged to just
[31:36] fight on it maybe we're not going to
[31:38] sink into mo we will go straight to the
[31:42] word I to open your Bibles I'm gonna
[31:47] take my time a man tonight if that's
[31:51] alright because I don't want to feel too
[31:55] rushed
[31:56] I feel like I'm among family and friends
[31:59] so I can try to just relax myself and
[32:04] compose myself and just deliver what was
[32:08] on what's on my heart and tell you what
[32:11] if I can deliver it the way I received
[32:13] it and it would be a real blessing to
[32:16] you I'm sure a man was gonna take it
[32:19] from the last time from Matthew 11
[32:25] chapter in eleventh and twelfth verse
[32:27] and we're going to go to Luke 16:16
[32:30] and we're going to just go from there
[32:53] I'm trying to make all this fit you see
[32:55] I'm I'm not quite as a few later so I
[32:59] don't have my tablet now that I got old
[33:02] school and I brought my big Bible this
[33:04] time so you know so I can see so I'm
[33:08] just trying to feed everything up here
[33:10] on the platform on me man
[33:11] Matthew 11:11 there's barely I say unto
[33:15] you among them that are born of woman
[33:20] there have not risen a greater than John
[33:23] the Baptist
[33:25] notwithstanding that he is least in the
[33:28] kingdom of heaven is greater than he and
[33:31] from that day of John the Baptist until
[33:36] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[33:38] violence and the violent take it by
[33:41] force command if we just go over to Luke
[33:45] 16:16
[34:07] amen Matthew Luke seeing the same saying
[34:14] the same thing just saved a different
[34:16] way to say the law and the prophets were
[34:19] untrue
[34:20] John since that time the kingdom of God
[34:25] is preached and every man presses into
[34:32] it for is easier for heaven and earth to
[34:36] pass away than one tittle of the law to
[34:40] fail a man may the Lord had a blessing
[34:43] to the reading of his word now let us
[34:47] pray most gracious Heavenly Father dear
[34:52] God we just come before you
[34:54] Lord God just ask you to just have your
[34:56] way Lord God Lord you know the needs
[35:00] upon the heart Lord of the people of
[35:03] Lord Lord you know Lord God the need or
[35:07] father God that's before us in this our
[35:12] Lord Lord just looking at how the
[35:14] inspiration and things have been going
[35:18] on father God it just Lord God may I
[35:21] just fall right into that channel Lord
[35:24] God Lord God use my lips Lord my voice
[35:30] Lord for your glory Lord and you hide me
[35:34] behind the cross Lord Lord I'm reminded
[35:38] your prophets say that the gift is to
[35:40] get out of the way the Lord is not I but
[35:44] he that dwelleth on the inside and Jesus
[35:48] precious name Amen
[35:51] you may be seated man so we find a man
[35:59] that this passage of Scripture that I
[36:02] read that that that the kingdom of God a
[36:06] man a minute there's going to be
[36:11] resistance that there's something that
[36:14] this battle started long before we got
[36:18] here
[36:18] amen this battle started in in heaven
[36:22] amen and Lucifer was was kicked out of
[36:27] heaven amen and God had a will for man
[36:30] on the earth and the battle just came
[36:33] down to earth and just continued a man
[36:35] so this is not new this this battle has
[36:38] been going on this battle is going to
[36:40] continue and after we leave here amen so
[36:45] we have to choose this day whom we going
[36:50] to serve we have to be willing a man to
[36:57] to fight in this out we have to be
[37:01] willing to give up something this this
[37:06] walk is not a flowery bed of these amen
[37:11] we put it one way that we talked last
[37:16] week about you being enlisted into an
[37:18] army and man how the government they
[37:26] call the military people GIS amen and
[37:31] how this day God
[37:35] urg is for God a man of government
[37:40] issues but we are God issue amen
[37:43] so we're definitely in a battle but we
[37:48] have chose to be on the winning side on
[37:51] the lower side amen the kingdom of God
[37:58] amen you see that uh it's always been
[38:02] God's desire and his will to rule and
[38:07] reign a man as King a man ever since the
[38:13] fall in the Garden of Eden a man his
[38:17] desire was to dwell in his people a man
[38:23] so the question is the kingdom of God
[38:28] the Bible says that
[38:30] kingdom of God is within you a man
[38:34] so his desire is to to rule and reign in
[38:38] your heart I believe God is looking for
[38:42] people today that is totally sold out to
[38:48] him Amen that that it we're living at a
[38:53] time that when when Jesus was here amen
[38:58] and and and and and and he died on
[39:02] Calvary Amen that we may have a chance
[39:08] at eternal life because he there was a
[39:11] time us being as Gentiles a man was not
[39:15] privy they meant to - there's good news
[39:20] a man we we were we were on the outside
[39:23] but because of what happened at Calvary
[39:27] amen we now have this opportunity amen
[39:33] we we might call it this dispensation of
[39:36] grace amen and I thank God for this time
[39:42] that he allowed us a man to be grafted
[39:48] in today men that we may do his will
[39:54] that we may manifest him again you know
[40:01] I look around and I look and I am and I
[40:05] wonder you know will change his brother
[40:09] branham left you know you had the great
[40:13] revival was going on and amen there were
[40:16] tent revivals and people filled up
[40:19] churches by the hundreds if not the
[40:23] thousands but now we see that what
[40:29] happened to the love God the people are
[40:33] so lost in this hour
[40:35] I believe what they need to see is God
[40:39] manifested once again the Bible talks
[40:43] about how the whole world is groaning
[40:47] and travailing for the manifestation of
[40:51] the sons of God
[40:53] hey man but you see we have to be tested
[41:01] we have to go through something he has
[41:04] to know that he can trust us with his
[41:08] work he has to know that we have faith
[41:13] amen
[41:14] now in order for them it meant to be a
[41:18] kingdom a man there must be a king
[41:21] you know crisis that came a man when we
[41:26] know that he is in his word a man y'all
[41:31] Bear Whitman now amen there are things
[41:38] that we're going to have to be willing
[41:40] to go through to press means to a force
[41:46] against in opposition and the violent
[41:52] means those who oppose all opposition
[41:56] and force who will seize and press their
[42:01] way into the kingdom of God at any cost
[42:08] violence me free that again are those
[42:12] who will oppose all opposition and force
[42:18] who were seized and press their way into
[42:23] the kingdom of God at any cost
[42:27] amen amen
[42:30] the title of the message is confronting
[42:34] the opposition amen so I want to just
[42:37] keep that in mind that we're pressing
[42:41] our way into the kingdom and in doing so
[42:44] we are confronting the opposition
[42:49] insinuating that there's a battle going
[42:51] on all the time the Prophet talking
[42:54] about the Battle of the the place of
[42:59] battle is in our mind amen
[43:03] we always are going to be that's where
[43:07] the devil meets our saying that's where
[43:10] the war starts so is the battle is
[43:14] within us amen
[43:18] Jesus gave us all kind of examples and
[43:21] we'll go through those example of how we
[43:23] fight a man he says that this is not a
[43:28] battle against flesh and blood but
[43:32] against principalities and spiritual
[43:34] wickedness in high places
[43:36] amen amen let us saw Ephesians 6 shot
[43:44] that a tenth verse a man and I trust
[43:55] when we we get here it'll be encouraging
[43:59] I'm gonna take my time and I'm gonna get
[44:01] there amen Ephesians the sixth chapter
[44:06] the tenth verse amen and finally my
[44:11] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[44:17] the power of his might put on the whole
[44:21] armour of God that ye may be able to
[44:24] stand the wiles of the devil
[44:27] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[44:31] blood but against principalities against
[44:36] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[44:40] this world against spiritual wickedness
[44:44] in high places and now we see we're not
[44:51] fighting your brother and sister our
[44:55] battle is not not against
[44:58] a flesh-and-blood a man but it's the
[45:03] Word of God and those that would oppose
[45:06] the Word of God amen so we're
[45:09] confronting the opposition that Christ
[45:13] may rule and reign amen the general in
[45:19] an army a man he he's not going down and
[45:23] battling for himself he has soldiers and
[45:26] men that he sent out on the battlefield
[45:28] a man he he must train them a man he
[45:33] take the time to train his soldiers he
[45:37] take the time to make sure that his
[45:39] soldiers are fully prepared that they
[45:43] have everything that they need that they
[45:46] have enough ammunition that they have
[45:51] their boots that they have their helmet
[45:56] that they have a bulletproof vests and
[46:00] Men everything that they will need while
[46:04] they are on the battlefield and man that
[46:06] we see here God says to put on the whole
[46:10] armor of God a man that we are ready for
[46:16] the battle because we end up we in the
[46:19] battlefield amen amen but again like I
[46:23] say the place of battle is in your mind
[46:26] amen many times you will see that the
[46:32] Lord will be speaking to a person's
[46:35] heart Amen through the preaching of the
[46:38] gospel amen and immediately you feel
[46:43] that tug in your heart and immediately
[46:46] Satan to come to your mind and and and
[46:50] start bombarding your mind with all kind
[46:52] of salts these people looking at me from
[46:57] all kind of crazy things he'll put you
[47:01] your children on your mind it'll put the
[47:04] job on your mind anything that he can to
[47:08] distract you
[47:09] from God target on your heart amen let's
[47:14] go over here to acts the second chapter
[47:18] Amen leave me Holy Ghost amen
[47:23] acts the second chapter and we're gonna
[47:30] read here from the 21st verse and it
[47:39] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[47:44] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[47:48] saved
[47:50] ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus
[47:53] of Nazareth a man approved of God among
[47:56] you by miracles and wonders and signs
[48:01] which God did by him in the midst of you
[48:05] as ye yourself also know him being
[48:12] delivered by the determinate counsel did
[48:18] that by the determinate counsel and the
[48:22] foreknowledge of God he have taken and
[48:26] by wicked hands crucified and slain whom
[48:32] God has raised up having loosed the
[48:34] pains of death because it was not
[48:39] possible that he should be holding of it
[48:44] and I will go down here to the 37th
[48:48] verse now when they heard this they were
[49:01] pricked in their heart and said unto
[49:04] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[49:07] and brethren what shall we do then Peter
[49:15] said unto them repent and be baptized
[49:19] every one of you for the remission Viva
[49:22] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[49:25] Christ for the remission of your sins
[49:27] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[49:30] Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you
[49:34] and to your children and to all that are
[49:38] far off and as many as the LORD thy God
[49:43] shall call now I want to refer you back
[49:48] to the 21st verse and it shall come to
[49:52] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[49:56] name of the Lord shall be saved and he
[49:59] said here in the 3rd of 9 that this
[50:01] promises unto you and as many as the
[50:05] LORD thy God shall call I'm reminded to
[50:08] probably say that you can't come until
[50:11] he called you amen
[50:14] you can't come until he called you so as
[50:18] many as the LORD thy God shall call
[50:23] Peter and the brethren the Apostle stood
[50:29] up and preached the gospel and we see
[50:33] that the preaching of the gospel the
[50:37] hearts was stirred by the preaching of
[50:42] the gospel and they wanted to tell what
[50:45] must we do what must we do and we can
[50:51] have this eternal life amen he said
[50:55] repent see when their heart was free the
[51:01] prophets taught us that a godly sorrow
[51:04] worketh repentance it has to be a godly
[51:10] sorry you can't just say something like
[51:13] your mouth or not meaning it has to be
[51:16] from the heart
[51:19] amen and their hearts were pre their
[51:23] hearts were troubled and he said what
[51:26] must I do be the laid it out to him
[51:30] repent every one of you
[51:34] in the name of the Jesus Christ for the
[51:37] remission of your sins a man who says
[51:41] and you shall receive the gift of the
[51:42] Holy Ghost with his promises unto you
[51:44] and to your children and to all that
[51:47] afar off even as many as a Lord that God
[51:51] shall call a man and with many other
[51:57] words did he testify and exhort saying
[51:59] save good save yourselves from this
[52:03] untoward this generation amen
[52:06] so we see that the heart was stirred
[52:09] amen but the minute that their hearts
[52:13] were stirred you know here comes the
[52:17] enemy starts speaking to your mind the
[52:21] greatest battle ever fought the Prophet
[52:24] told her that that was a mistake that
[52:27] evening that she just stopped for a
[52:31] little while and began to reason with
[52:35] the devil see he came to her and she
[52:40] began to have conversation with him and
[52:46] and and and and he got in the head she
[52:52] began to reason in our mind you shall
[52:56] not surely die and and the Prophet
[53:01] brought out how this man this beast he
[53:06] was a beautiful fellow he wasn't no ugly
[53:10] fellow he had six-pack ABS big masculine
[53:21] gentleman spoke smooth probably had a
[53:29] look sway in his walk and spokes him you
[53:35] shall not surely die
[53:37] amen and that's how the double do today
[53:42] he's not gonna see he he was the most
[53:45] beautiful angel so he knows you see the
[53:51] devil is really a one-trick pony
[53:54] he's really a one tree party once you
[53:57] once you figure out his best moves you
[54:01] got him figured I cuz he gonna come the
[54:04] same way every time he gonna come with
[54:09] the same tricks every time and you know
[54:12] I've the beautiful thing about it it's
[54:15] the same thing that defeat him every
[54:17] time the Word of God the same thing that
[54:22] defeated every time but see what he
[54:25] tries to doing this hour is he's the
[54:28] author of confusion if he can take one
[54:32] word and twist it it's powerless he'll
[54:41] take it and tell you the days of
[54:43] miracles are in pants
[54:46] God is not doing that anymore
[54:49] oh it don't take all of that you can
[54:57] come to church as you are you can God is
[55:01] concerned about what's on the inside so
[55:03] you can dress how your water these are
[55:09] the things that oh my Satan is poisoning
[55:16] the people taking their weapons from him
[55:21] I think you can't stand you know got
[55:25] nothing to stand on
[55:27] it's like you're going into battle God
[55:30] gave you swore it Sean and it's got a
[55:35] good balance to it and you keep chopping
[55:38] away at that school

[55:43] battle with a kitchen knife
[55:45] cause you know you don't you don't took
[55:48] away from it and took away from it
[55:51] now you got to get all up on the enemy
[55:54] to try to do damage when he gave you
[55:58] swore that a reach way into eternity
[56:02] then every swayin little pass anything
[56:07] that kind of just swing and swing and
[56:10] you kill thousands of Philistines Oh

[56:21] way in his own right he was called a man
[56:26] to kill that was his whole purpose
[56:29] Philistines but he allowed himself for
[56:35] his allowed his weapon to be cut same

[1:01:17] the heart might be pretty well what is
[1:01:20] it about you have an opportunity to take
[1:01:24] your word and give the government good
[1:01:26] whack give the devil is good way amen
[1:01:32] amen amen
[1:01:33] confront the opposition a man turn with
[1:01:39] me to Luke 4 Luke the fourth chapter and
[1:01:44] there we're going to see a man our
[1:01:49] perfect example how Christ confronted
[1:01:54] the opposition a man
[1:02:02] Luke the fourth chapter and starting at
[1:02:07] the first verse and Jesus being full of
[1:02:13] the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and
[1:02:16] was led by the spirit into the
[1:02:20] wilderness being forty days tempted of
[1:02:27] the devil and in those days he did eat
[1:02:34] nothing and when they were ended he
[1:02:41] afterward hunger amen and the devil said
[1:02:50] unto him if thou be the Son of God
[1:02:55] command these stones that it be made
[1:03:00] bread and jesus answered him saying it
[1:03:07] is not written it is written that man
[1:03:12] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:03:16] every word of God amen now we see that
[1:03:24] Christ a man was being tested a man just
[1:03:33] like we have to be tested a man he went
[1:03:39] through the same things a man that we
[1:03:41] would go through a man we see that a man
[1:03:50] the devil Satan tempted him a man to
[1:03:56] turn a man the stones to bread a man for
[1:04:03] he hungered after fasting for forty days
[1:04:07] no doubt he was extremely hungry and no
[1:04:11] doubt that it may have been tempted
[1:04:15] a man but Jesus confronted him with the
[1:04:19] Word of God it is written a man that man
[1:04:24] should not live by bread alone that test
[1:04:31] a man is to prove a man that a man you
[1:04:38] have to have faith in God a man being a
[1:04:46] man the man Christ Jesus he in his
[1:04:54] mortal body now he couldn't take on the
[1:04:59] test as God because he could have just
[1:05:05] destroyed scene but him being Christ
[1:05:08] Jesus the man he had to fight as a man
[1:05:14] as a man would fight so he fought with
[1:05:20] the word he had to have faith that my
[1:05:27] God shall supply all my needs according
[1:05:32] to his riches in glory I don't need you
[1:05:37] Satan to give me anything
[1:05:43] consider the fowl of the air he doesn't
[1:05:48] hunt
[1:05:48] neither does he gather but he eat every
[1:05:53] day a man my God will provide for me so
[1:06:01] what is he looking for faith your faith
[1:06:06] is being tested yeah I'll turn these
[1:06:10] stones to bread no my daughter supply
[1:06:15] I'm gonna stand on the word I'm not
[1:06:19] going to go down hidden rob the stove
[1:06:23] I'm not going to cause I want it's cause
[1:06:26] I'm hungry I'm not gonna go and do
[1:06:32] something I know that's wrong I'm gonna
[1:06:34] stand on the Word of God I may not have
[1:06:38] any groceries in the house I may be
[1:06:41] hungry but I'm not gonna break god's
[1:06:44] word to feed this flesh gotta supply my
[1:06:51] knees see that was the test
[1:06:54] well you trust God oh my he had to be
[1:06:59] tested the same tests that we're going
[1:07:02] through hey man
[1:07:04] a man will you have faith in God Hebrews
[1:07:10] keep the finger there Hebrews the
[1:07:14] twelfth chapter says no chastening for
[1:07:19] the present seemeth joyous but Grievous
[1:07:24] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:07:29] peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:07:32] now listen unto them which are exercised
[1:07:38] thereby see your faith has to be
[1:07:43] exercised your faith has to be
[1:07:48] challenged
[1:07:49] and see when your faith is challenged
[1:07:54] and you stand on the Word of God you
[1:07:59] come out just a little bit stronger you
[1:08:02] trust just a little bit more if my wife
[1:08:07] asked me to do something and I do it
[1:08:11] well what does that do it increases of
[1:08:15] confidence in me that well I asked him
[1:08:19] to do this this time and he did it and I
[1:08:23] actually will do that the next time and
[1:08:25] he came through so what all coffee
[1:08:28] you have no problem coming to me saying
[1:08:30] honey I need you to do this for me cuz
[1:08:34] she got confidence that he came through
[1:08:38] before that he'll come through again our
[1:08:42] faith has to be exercised has to be
[1:08:46] tried and tested a man stick Whitman we
[1:08:51] going somewhere a man the second test
[1:08:55] the devil taking him unto the high
[1:08:59] mountain showed him all the kingdoms of
[1:09:04] the world in a moment of time and the
[1:09:09] devil said unto him all this power will
[1:09:15] I give thee and the glory of them for
[1:09:22] that is delivered unto me and to whom so
[1:09:27] ever I will give it if thou therefore
[1:09:32] will worship me all shall be thine and
[1:09:40] jesus answered and said get thee behind
[1:09:43] me Satan for it is written thou shalt
[1:09:49] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:09:54] shall I serve amen the second test a man
[1:10:02] we realize that your motive and
[1:10:10] objection
[1:10:12] have to be right see what the devil was
[1:10:17] trying to do was test Christ you want to
[1:10:23] be king I give you Kingdom I'll give you
[1:10:29] all the riches of the world if you just
[1:10:34] worship me he'll give it
[1:10:38] not a proper book the kingdom of this
[1:10:41] world they are his they all here is the
[1:10:46] guild yes sir but why would you give me
[1:10:54] something that I'm just going to take
[1:10:57] later see your motive and your objection
[1:11:05] have to be right if he was a man that
[1:11:09] was power-hungry a man wanted esteem
[1:11:19] more than wanting the wheel of God and
[1:11:25] may seem pretty tempting but he attacked
[1:11:30] him with the Word of God you see so many
[1:11:34] times today that preachers won't preach
[1:11:40] the Word of God because of the fear of
[1:11:45] losing membership you can't tell me they
[1:11:49] don't see this stuff in the word you see
[1:11:54] everything else but you looked at it in
[1:11:59] the congregation other people and they
[1:12:03] look just like Jezebel you afraid you
[1:12:11] afraid that you will lose your
[1:12:14] membership means that you won't tell the
[1:12:18] people the truth
[1:12:21] you won't confront the opposition
[1:12:24] because you agreed the love of money the
[1:12:33] love of power of prestige my god that
[1:12:40] Jezebel spirit
[1:12:43] that great hall and her daughter's again
[1:12:48] we go back to Samson son took his locks
[1:12:53] he's powerless and I'm puff his eyes out
[1:12:59] he can't even see anymore
[1:13:01] hey man but what's milord
[1:13:05] a man so a man a son or daughter God as
[1:13:10] they just lead me to the pillows young
[1:13:15] man you say that though everybody's here
[1:13:20] the Prophet brought out and that was
[1:13:22] just a cruel celebration it was Satan
[1:13:28] celebrating victory over God
[1:13:33] the Philistines threw off party
[1:13:38] celebrating a victory over God how sad
[1:13:45] how ignorant is he say they were
[1:13:50] celebrating and drinking and reveling
[1:13:53] and going on say they fail to see Samson
[1:13:59] tears streaming and those kept these
[1:14:02] suckers from where dad poked his eyes
[1:14:04] out him over their lips moving praying
[1:14:10] to himself Lord God I'm so sorry forgive
[1:14:15] me Lord if you just give me one more
[1:14:20] chance I'll be willing to die with the
[1:14:25] Philistines see we have to be willing to
[1:14:32] die we have to be willing to fight at
[1:14:36] all costs a good soldier on the
[1:14:39] battlefield is willing to give up his
[1:14:42] life knowing he may not make it back
[1:14:46] home but he has to fight anyway Oh
[1:14:51] Samson just said if you just leave it to
[1:14:54] those pillows
[1:14:56] and lord I just feel the strength coming
[1:15:01] back and by just you just push those
[1:15:05] pillars down and killed moe Philistines
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:10] but he died himself with the Philistines
[1:15:15] amen I'm reminded that in these tests in
[1:15:18] order to be promoted you have to go
[1:15:24] through the battle we have an uncle as
[1:15:28] they didn't know that it's pretty hide
[1:15:30] in the military and I remember that a
[1:15:35] few promotions ago he had the education
[1:15:42] he had everything he passed the tests
[1:15:48] but he couldn't be promoted so he said
[1:15:51] you haven't been in battle
[1:15:54] you haven't been in battle so him being
[1:16:00] having favor with God they put him in a
[1:16:04] battle they sent him to Jamaica now I
[1:16:06] don't know what battle was over in
[1:16:08] Jamaica that sounded like a vacation
[1:16:11] more than a battle but from what I
[1:16:15] thought they said was the uprising in
[1:16:17] Jamaica and you had he had to go that
[1:16:20] should make this quilt is uprising so he
[1:16:23] put on his guild had a helmet all
[1:16:25] grabbed his gun and went into battle
[1:16:28] maybe took a cruise ship back I don't
[1:16:31] know but he had to go in the battle he
[1:16:34] had to have battle tested on his resume
[1:16:38] to get this next promotion amen and what
[1:16:42] I'm trying to say is we have to be
[1:16:44] battle tested each time we go through a
[1:16:48] battle and we come out on the other side
[1:16:51] victorious we promote it just a little
[1:16:56] high
[1:16:56] what is it your faith is your badge
[1:17:00] yo stripes is your faith Amen of the
[1:17:06] general no doubt now you see him he's
[1:17:09] got patches pins everywhere son of God
[1:17:15] that's the bit through the battle
[1:17:19] Purple Heart sleeve showing that he's
[1:17:25] been through some and he come out
[1:17:28] victorious that this person is that have
[1:17:33] we proven that they can stand the test a
[1:17:36] real soldier
[1:17:38] and man is ranked higher you say to that
[1:17:41] person
[1:17:41] you kick yes her that's her I see you've
[1:17:46] been through something and you're still
[1:17:49] holding up the blood-stained banner a
[1:17:51] man what a mighty warrior four-car
[1:17:55] seeing uh Hebrews
[1:18:10] I'm sorry
[1:18:17] mmm
[1:18:27] thank you Lord a scripture I'm looking
[1:18:34] for here man
[1:18:42] I could quote it but I would rather read
[1:18:45] it a man who just blessed my soul man
[1:18:50] and I thought I wrote it down and I
[1:18:53] probably did
[1:19:04] they didn't have their with me
[1:19:12] it made you love the Lord a man try not
[1:19:19] to feed before you too long but I ain't
[1:19:21] gonna let the devil this is just too
[1:19:23] rich it's just too rich and I just
[1:19:26] appreciate any man
[1:19:35] Amen Hebrews 11 thank you Jesus 24 amen
[1:19:42] Hebrews 11 24
[1:19:54] says our faith Moses when he was come to
[1:20:01] years refused to be called the five the
[1:20:10] Pharaoh's daughter choosing now he had a
[1:20:18] choice but he chose rather to suffer the
[1:20:29] afflictions with the people of God than
[1:20:35] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:20:41] season I want to stop right there I want
[1:20:47] to just say one thing the pleasures of
[1:20:51] sin
[1:20:55] make no mistake about it seeing its
[1:20:58] pleasurable sin is pleasurable why
[1:21:07] because there's no opposition there's no
[1:21:11] resistance you just travel with the
[1:21:15] masses lost in the crowd going with the
[1:21:19] flow
[1:21:23] Amen but Moses chose chose to suffer
[1:21:31] suffer the affliction of God's people
[1:21:37] it's like fish swimming upstream there's
[1:21:43] gonna be some resistance chose the
[1:21:47] harder way why because he loved the Lord
[1:21:53] it's hard something in him wouldn't let
[1:21:59] it so he made a conscious choice and
[1:22:02] esteem the reproach of Christ greater
[1:22:06] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[1:22:17] he had respect unto the recompense of
[1:22:21] the reward see motive and objection Amen
[1:22:32] Christ here and loo was not concerned
[1:22:36] about the money a man he was more
[1:22:40] concerned a man about the Word of God
[1:22:44] being manifested in that hour he
[1:22:49] understood a man who he was and what he
[1:22:54] was to do and what he was therefore a
[1:23:00] man let's go back to Luke 4
[1:23:04] a man the third test and he brought him
[1:23:14] to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle
[1:23:17] of the temple and said unto him if thou
[1:23:19] be the Son of God cast ourselves down
[1:23:25] from hence for it is written now his
[1:23:31] Satan quoting the word well it is
[1:23:34] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:23:37] over thee to keep thee and in their
[1:23:44] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:23:49] any time thou dash thy foot against the
[1:23:52] stone
[1:23:53] and jesus answered and said unto Him it
[1:23:58] is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD
[1:24:03] thy God
[1:24:07] now again Christ Jesus the man now Satan
[1:24:16] know who he were he just said it he know
[1:24:19] who he was he knew the angel bongo
[1:24:22] letter but the man being an example for
[1:24:26] us limiting you trust God and have faith
[1:24:34] in God you don't test God I will do this
[1:24:41] just to see what you do thou shalt not
[1:24:48] tempt the LORD thy God he tests us you
[1:24:52] don't test me when you fail to trust God
[1:25:02] you are questioning the authority and
[1:25:06] the plan of God you're telling God wait
[1:25:10] a minute I have doubt
[1:25:12] wanna see if your stand by your word
[1:25:15] that's my face that's not faith
[1:25:23] anybody cuz that's what science does
[1:25:25] sang it's through tests they do tests
[1:25:29] and we say okay this test happened and
[1:25:32] every time we did does this happen we
[1:25:34] did this again and the same thing
[1:25:36] happened so we want to say that that's
[1:25:38] what happened but tell me how a virgin
[1:25:41] can see if every time it happened one
[1:25:44] time blows your sight inside an award
[1:25:48] tell me how it rain science they had all
[1:25:52] kind of scientifical gadget if there
[1:25:54] were rainbows oh no you must be brought
[1:25:58] one wrong with you it never rain they
[1:26:03] never rain before the science said it
[1:26:06] won't happen but it happened amen
[1:26:11] they the water God you can't test God
[1:26:15] he's the tester a man Deuteronomy the
[1:26:24] 8th chapter
[1:26:36] a man in the second verse and Dow shall
[1:26:43] remember all the way which the LORD thy
[1:26:48] God led thee before the years in the
[1:26:51] wilderness to do what to Humble thee and
[1:26:57] to prove thee to know that what was in
[1:27:03] that heart whether that would keep his
[1:27:08] commandment or no that's the whole
[1:27:13] reason for the test to know what's in
[1:27:16] your heart what's in your heart whether
[1:27:21] you would keep his commandment and I or
[1:27:24] whether you would go off and do your own
[1:27:25] thing
[1:27:27] amen turn the heat on Hebrews the
[1:27:30] twelfth chapter hey man I know we're
[1:27:33] doing a lot of flipping but the only way
[1:27:37] I know how to do Amen once I'm done
[1:27:42] getting one of them fancy slide things
[1:27:45] and I'd be quick about it
[1:27:47] a man Hebrews
[1:28:02] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:28:05] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:28:09] let us lay aside every weight and sin
[1:28:13] which so easily beset us and let us run
[1:28:17] this race with the patient that is set
[1:28:19] before us looking unto Jesus who was the
[1:28:22] author and the finisher of our faith who
[1:28:25] for the joy that was set before him
[1:28:30] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:28:35] and is set down at the right hand of
[1:28:39] throne of God
[1:28:40] for considering him that endured such
[1:28:42] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:28:45] lest she be weird and faint in your
[1:28:49] minds you have not yet resisted unto
[1:28:55] blood striving against sin and ye have
[1:28:59] forgotten the exhortation that speaketh
[1:29:03] unto you as unto the children my son
[1:29:06] despise not thou chastening of the Lord
[1:29:09] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[1:29:14] for whom the Lord loveth he chasing and
[1:29:19] scourge every son whom he received if he
[1:29:25] endure chastening God dealeth with you
[1:29:28] as with sons for what son is he whom the
[1:29:35] father chases not but if you be without
[1:29:39] chastisement where for all are partakers
[1:29:44] there are ye bastards and not sons
[1:29:49] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:29:54] flesh which corrected us and we give
[1:29:58] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:30:02] be in subjection unto the father of the
[1:30:05] spirit and live for verily for a few
[1:30:10] days chasing us after their own pleasure
[1:30:15] but he for our profit that we might be
[1:30:19] partakers of his holiness now no
[1:30:23] chastisement for the present seemeth to
[1:30:26] be joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[1:30:28] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:30:29] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:30:32] are exercised amen but we see anything
[1:30:35] that that that the chest Heisman and the
[1:30:38] test a man unnecessary for us a man in
[1:30:45] the battle now I read earlier in X when
[1:30:49] they repent and was baptized with the
[1:30:53] Holy Ghost amen
[1:30:54] I'm I'm sorry with a baptized and repent
[1:30:57] and man that was the induction ceremony
[1:31:00] into the army okay now he had to go
[1:31:05] through training had to go through the
[1:31:08] training of being tested tempted proven
[1:31:13] and made a true soldier of God amen amen

[1:31:46] the first chat I'm in the fourth chapter
[1:31:58] let no man so account of us as of the
[1:32:05] ministers of Christ and stewards of the
[1:32:11] mystery of God moreover it is required
[1:32:16] in stewards that a man be found faithful
[1:32:26] now we are to be stewards over what the
[1:32:31] mysteries of God
[1:32:35] I remember we confront in the opposition
[1:32:40] and remember it is God's desire to rule
[1:32:45] and to reign and to have complete
[1:32:50] control of our lives amen our thoughts
[1:32:55] our desires but it's going to be a
[1:33:00] battle a man now a command man is forced
[1:33:05] to be stewards over the mysteries of God

[1:33:45] be ye followers of Christ he said be ye
[1:33:50] followers of me not is Paul talking Paul
[1:33:59] had a revelation of who he was
[1:34:08] remember we talked about that that was a
[1:34:10] dispensation of change that we were no
[1:34:14] longer under the Covenant of the law but
[1:34:16] we were in the dispensation of grace and
[1:34:19] he said until many Alcon come it to many
[1:34:23] of the Lord thy God shall call not just
[1:34:27] Israel as many as the LORD thy God shall
[1:34:32] call see he told them it was unto you
[1:34:37] and your children till another far off
[1:34:39] then he said that so many as the LORD
[1:34:42] thy God shall call speaking of the
[1:34:47] Gentiles but Paul said I beseech you be
[1:34:52] ye followers of me hey man
[1:34:56] now it says in first Corinthians the
[1:35:00] 11th chapter amen Paul kind of broke it
[1:35:06] down for him a little bit so that

[1:35:17] Christ see same thing Moses saying

[1:36:08] have to tell people God's in a prophet
[1:36:10] folks and God sent a prophet this is why
[1:36:16] you're so confused around here
[1:36:20] worshipping that woman Jezebel being
[1:36:26] partakers of her sin come out from a
[1:36:28] bona goddess and a prophet to what show
[1:36:34] us how to be good stewards over the

[1:37:16] which he has purposed in himself that in
[1:37:20] the dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:37:23] he might gather together in all he might

[1:37:29] Christ both are in heaven and which are
[1:37:34] on earth even in him amen

[1:46:05] realize that the battle isn't your man
[1:46:08] that the belt is ax is a fight and he's
[1:46:11] always constantly bombarding your mind
[1:46:14] with all kind of crazy thoughts all kind
[1:46:16] of crazy ideas but your love for him how
[1:46:20] ways amen the battle that's going on in
[1:46:24] your mind that's the test and that you

[1:46:32] so now after you go through all of this
[1:46:35] he says for as many a live by the Spirit
[1:46:39] of God they are the sons of God for he
[1:46:43] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:46:46] again to fear see when the children of
[1:46:51] Israel came out of Egypt a man they came
[1:46:54] out of bondage they were in bondage and
[1:46:59] they got out there in the wilderness and
[1:47:02] they had to go through the same tests
[1:47:04] they got hungry and they started
[1:47:07] murmuring and complaining
[1:47:09] and so we we were better off eating the
[1:47:12] garlic pizza vegan this we have some
[1:47:16] meat but they would think I would rather
[1:47:19] be in bondage then maybe I have
[1:47:23] suffering reflections of suffering with
[1:47:24] you so they couldn't enter into that
[1:47:27] race because of the murmuring Amen but
[1:47:32] you see Christ amen he showed us be an
[1:47:36] hour out the first part taken that we
[1:47:39] fight with the Word of God that we
[1:47:42] overcome and after the overcoming that's
[1:47:46] this is one react today for Azrael a by
[1:47:50] the Spirit of God amen to be led by the
[1:47:54] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:47:56] but we have not given over to the spirit
[1:47:59] of receipt have not received a spirit
[1:48:01] about it again that's a fear like the
[1:48:04] children of Israel
[1:48:05] oh man a man for for as many a lay-by
[1:48:12] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:48:13] God for not received the spirit of
[1:48:15] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:48:18] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:48:20] we cry Abba Father my god that's what it
[1:48:26] mean my god the spirit itself bears
[1:48:29] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:48:33] children of God and the children then
[1:48:36] heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[1:48:40] in so we that we suffer with him that we
[1:48:46] may be glorified together for I reckon
[1:48:50] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:48:52] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:48:56] glory that shall be revealed in us amen
[1:49:00] amen let us stand to our feet glory to
[1:49:05] God amen
[1:49:12] musicians if you come a man confronting
[1:49:18] the opposition a man that we be good
[1:49:23] stewards over the mysteries of his will
[1:49:30] his real is that we are led see the
[1:49:35] kingdom suffers violence and the kingdom
[1:49:40] of God is pressed unto the kingdom the
[1:49:47] must have a king that he ruled and
[1:49:50] reigned in our hearts that we do his
[1:49:56] will though that are led by God they are
[1:50:00] the sons of God but we must go through
[1:50:04] our faith must be exercised let us not
[1:50:08] get weary and well done I think I show
[1:50:11] by different scriptures and different
[1:50:14] examples a man that we are to fight the
[1:50:19] good fight of faith a man and continue
[1:50:24] all and a man until we have the full
[1:50:28] manifestation of the sons of God in this
[1:50:34] last and evil days amen for this is this
[1:50:37] is what the world needs to see a man

[1:50:48] God how I just thank you Lord God for
[1:50:52] allowing me Lord God to just a man just
[1:50:56] my own broken up way Lord God to just
[1:51:00] deliver this message Lord God Lord how
[1:51:07] it's going to be a battle and we're in
[1:51:10] the midst of a battle the Lord like
[1:51:14] Moses Lord we choose to suffer with the
[1:51:18] afflictions of God's people
[1:51:21] rather than to dwell in the house of
[1:51:26] Pharaoh's daughter where there's no
[1:51:30] doubt many wonderful riches the
[1:51:36] pleasures of sin we denounce that we
[1:51:40] turn our back on it Lord to follow you
[1:51:44] knowing Lord God that is not popular
[1:51:49] Lord but we would have that your word be
[1:51:54] glorified Lord God and that you rule and
[1:51:58] reign in human flesh once again Oh God
[1:52:03] Lord God just like Lord and the body of
[1:52:07] Christ Lord to just rule and reign in

[1:52:51] [Applause]
[1:53:11] let's give the Lord of another hand to
[1:53:14] praise brother Troy a man I certainly
[1:53:20] just appreciate that that felt tonight
[1:53:24] of confronting a man the opposition and
[1:53:28] there was a lot being said in there you
[1:53:32] know it's been spoken probably the last
[1:53:37] few weeks
[1:53:38] different ones I've said it and at
[1:53:41] different times I heard beliefs just the
[1:53:43] burgers I think I heard sister wisdom
[1:53:46] just talk about the attack that's on the
[1:53:48] message and you know oftentimes when you
[1:53:53] see different different brothers that
[1:53:56] are let down standards it's because of
[1:54:01] you know they didn't confront the
[1:54:04] opposition right there maybe maybe what
[1:54:09] I've what I found just in my own
[1:54:12] observation oftentimes somebody's
[1:54:15] desiring something in the world right
[1:54:18] they won't address like the world he
[1:54:19] want to look like the world you know all
[1:54:22] of these things I remember talking with
[1:54:24] somebody and it was all about being able
[1:54:27] to drink alcohol that that's really what
[1:54:30] that's what it brought out to you know
[1:54:31] being able to drink alcohol and because
[1:54:34] the message has a standard right that we
[1:54:36] live people are not able to confront
[1:54:39] that right and just really look you got
[1:54:42] a spirit on you you need to be delivered
[1:54:43] right and and it's just you know it's
[1:54:47] there's there's no other way around and
[1:54:48] I think people trying to sell me that
[1:54:50] that Jesus drank I know he turned water
[1:54:54] into wine but you didn't see him drink
[1:54:55] the wine well why did the Bible call him
[1:54:57] I want a blue they also call him you
[1:54:59] know Beelzebub right so what do you
[1:55:02] believe you know about the Lord Jesus so
[1:55:05] you know but but people got to be able
[1:55:06] to confront the opposition and I'm very
[1:55:09] grateful so so appreciative of that
[1:55:11] thought tonight and we just thank God a
[1:55:13] man for that he was talking about
[1:55:15] science and and I just heard a little
[1:55:17] something yesterday I was listening to
[1:55:19] sermons brother whisper preach and he
[1:55:22] was bringing out a point
[1:55:24] there was a scientist that wanted to
[1:55:27] prove that the cloud was not really the
[1:55:31] clown
[1:55:32] it wasn't supernatural and the
[1:55:34] scientists just he what he went through
[1:55:36] great limbs he said he was gonna give
[1:55:38] his life to proving that that was not
[1:55:40] you know a supernatural he went through
[1:55:43] so many things trying to prove whether
[1:55:44] it was uh you know when that moved you
[1:55:47] know uh you know move something over
[1:55:50] into that area if a jet flew or you know
[1:55:53] they said a rocket went off in the
[1:55:55] rocket went off about five hundred miles
[1:55:56] from where the cloud you know appeared
[1:55:58] and he was just going through great
[1:55:59] extremes the man went up to so many
[1:56:03] extremes that before he died he actually
[1:56:05] could not prove you know that the that
[1:56:08] it wasn't supernatural and and went for
[1:56:11] my understanding the way demand of
[1:56:12] diamonds he tried to commit suicide once
[1:56:14] was not successful and then later on his
[1:56:18] life he committed suicide and was
[1:56:20] successful you know and all of his
[1:56:22] efforts just to to disprove you know the
[1:56:26] word he lost his life in shame and and
[1:56:29] what you find is people doing the same
[1:56:31] thing you know trying to disprove this
[1:56:33] word you it's just easy to accept it
[1:56:35] it's so much easier just say Lord I
[1:56:37] believed and I'm gonna walk in and the
[1:56:39] things that I don't understand I still
[1:56:40] believe right it's so much easy to live
[1:56:43] that way than to sit here and try to you
[1:56:44] know try to go through and disprove what
[1:56:47] you know what God sent through his
[1:56:48] prophet but church we're just an hour we
[1:56:51] got to confront the opposition you know
[1:56:53] each one of us or in that and Amen we
[1:56:55] won't be afraid a man will stand up and
[1:56:57] do everything that God has called us to

[1:59:44] the opposition certainly we are in
[1:59:47] another time things are changed and we
[1:59:50] can we can feel the pressure all around
[1:59:52] as it was just spoken sent me that the
[1:59:56] Gentiles are rejecting the word and as
[1:59:59] they're rejecting it is opening up the
[2:00:01] door for the the Jews to come back in
[2:00:04] and God during this this this time of
[2:00:07] change there will be tremendous
[2:00:09] opposition but God help us to stand true
[2:00:13] on the word and not to compromise which
[2:00:17] sin and all these other things Lord that
[2:00:19] people presenting sometime this may be a
[2:00:23] man is compromising because of the way
[2:00:24] his wife wants to dress maybe a woman is
[2:00:27] compromising because the way husband
[2:00:29] wants to sin but God we we got it we got
[2:00:32] to confront the opposition we got to
[2:00:34] stand on the truth no matter what a man
[2:00:38] will fight in this battle at at every

[2:00:44] that anybody that would compromise a
[2:00:47] little bit with this word is our enemy
[2:00:50] no matter who they are if they're gonna
[2:00:52] compromise with its word they are our
[2:00:55] enemy so lord help us got to recognize
[2:00:57] that and lord suggests to have the same
[2:01:00] love that you have Lord but not to Lord
