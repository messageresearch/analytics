[54:09] know that you have uh uh assembled us
[54:12] together with purpose and uh with uh
[54:15] with a plan no one is here by accident
[54:18] but each one was predestinated before
[54:20] the foundational world to be here and uh
[54:23] God we ask that you would Minister to
[54:25] every heart to every need bring healing
[54:28] to those that need it bring Deliverance
[54:31] to those that need it bring Salvation to
[54:34] those that need it father God uh bring

[54:48] according uh to uh to your lord your
[54:51] great uh uh provision and we ask Lord
[54:54] that you would just take control of
[54:56] everything thought God every thought
[54:58] received and every thought thought
[55:00] presented may you have control and may
[55:02] you get all the glory and all the honor
[55:04] and every spirit that is against the
[55:06] spirit of God we take underneath control
[55:08] of the Holy Spirit even right now so in
[55:10] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[55:14] you you can be
[55:16] seated
[55:17] amen
[55:20] um we continue our
[55:23] journey uh through this inspiration that
[55:27] the Lord has given us for this year of
[55:30] uh get back in Step amen and um the the
[55:36] quote that I shared with the church uh
[55:40] early in the year of where we got that
[55:42] from was brother random talking about
[55:45] the uh bride he had a vision of the
[55:48] Bride she come in uh View and uh and
[55:53] when he saw you know the alphab Bri walk
[55:57] um he was just impressed by what he was
[56:01] looking at and then after he saw the
[56:03] alpab bride uh walking and she was
[56:06] merching to the beat of the Gospel uh
[56:09] this was uh what the what the walking
[56:11] she was walking according to the word
[56:15] amen had herself lined up with the word
[56:18] and you know it's you realize now um it
[56:21] is your individual
[56:23] responsibility to align yourself s with
[56:27] the word of God it's not the pastor's
[56:29] job he preaches the word the other
[56:31] ministers come and preach the word but
[56:32] you have to accept the word and then you
[56:35] have to align yourself with that uh the
[56:37] scripture actually says uh his wife hath
[56:41] made herself ready right so this is
[56:45] something that you have to do and um and
[56:48] and in doing that you're going to have
[56:49] to say no to some things in the world
[56:52] hello somebody and and and and preparing
[56:55] yourself you got to say yes to the word
[56:57] of God and no to the things of the world
[57:00] and uh and it's and it's a personal walk
[57:02] with Christ but brother random said he
[57:05] saw this this first group and they were
[57:07] you know they were just marching uh to
[57:09] own with Christian Soldiers M marching
[57:12] on to war with the cross of Jesus going
[57:14] on before and he was um impressed but
[57:17] after that he saw another group come and
[57:20] he says that the way that they were
[57:21] dressed uh he really couldn't even um he
[57:25] couldn't even state it you know in the
[57:26] Pulpit he just couldn't tell you how bad
[57:29] this was and and marching to the beat of
[57:31] rock and roll amen this is this is what
[57:34] he told us and and as brother brandham
[57:36] looked at this group you know he begin
[57:39] to cry he begin to worry he begin to be
[57:43] concerned and he he began to talk to the
[57:45] Lord he says Lord is this all with all
[57:48] the preaching that we've done and gone
[57:51] seven times across the world around the
[57:54] world with the gospel and says this all
[57:57] that we could produce for you he was so
[58:00] disappointed in what he saw in the
[58:03] church because the second group was not
[58:06] the bride but this group was the church
[58:09] the question is this morning which group
[58:12] do you want to be a part of which one do
[58:15] you want to identify yourself with do
[58:17] you want to be bride or do you want to
[58:19] be Church well the bride dresses a
[58:21] certain way the bride carries herself a
[58:25] certain way the bride looks a certain
[58:27] way and not just on the outside the
[58:29] bride looks like that on the inside
[58:32] because what's on the inside will
[58:33] reflect itself on the
[58:35] outside hallelujah amen notice the the
[58:39] the the the church was religious the
[58:41] church had you know music that they were
[58:43] marched to but it was the wrong music
[58:46] right and uh and even you know brother
[58:47] Bram looked at it's just it just really
[58:49] really discouraged him so you know then
[58:51] he said you know uh the angel said but
[58:53] the bride is going to come back in view
[58:55] again and this was the Omega bride and
[58:58] as uh as he saw this bride coming uh he
[59:02] was a little bit more encouraged but you
[59:04] know as he was looking at this bride he
[59:06] noticed a little something amen this
[59:09] bride began to get out of step and
[59:14] brother brandham said he was about to
[59:16] say something to this bride but before
[59:19] he could say something somehow she
[59:22] shuffled her feet and she got back in
[59:25] step with the word
[59:26] Hallelujah and what I what I believe is
[59:28] happening here amen from uh from from
[59:31] that Vision literally I believe the the
[59:33] bride is aligning herself with the word
[59:36] of God again oh hallelujah amen so this
[59:41] get back in Step has come back uh uh we
[59:44] just been uh taking this but the
[59:45] inspiration underneath all of that was I
[59:48] will restore saith the Lord amen and
[59:52] this is God's job to do the restoration
[59:54] it's not anybody else's job it's not my
[59:57] job it's not your job it it wasn't even
[59:59] the prophet's job amen but it was God's
[1:00:01] job to do the restoration and I'm
[1:00:04] telling you God is doing a great work
[1:00:05] and he's doing a good work in our midst
[1:00:09] this restoration goes amen uh very very
[1:00:12] deep from from from from you know um
[1:00:15] when we look at it I mentioned to you
[1:00:17] all at the beginning the theologians
[1:00:20] when they look at Joel 1:4 they look at
[1:00:22] Joel 225 the theologians say we don't
[1:00:24] know what this really means
[1:00:26] we we're not really sure you know what
[1:00:28] this is all about and and for
[1:00:30] theologians to give us that type of
[1:00:32] definition and then people would go to
[1:00:33] the pull pit and preach these scriptures
[1:00:35] and say we we don't really know what
[1:00:36] this all about well
[1:00:39] um um I I don't want to be uh let's see
[1:00:46] I got to use the right word I don't want
[1:00:48] to be too bold but I think it is uh it
[1:00:51] comes to a point where we begin to
[1:00:52] recognize who we are according to
[1:00:54] scriptures so if I can just say it like
[1:00:57] this and hopefully y'all won't be
[1:00:58] offended if the theologians amen don't
[1:01:01] know uh what this actually means I a I
[1:01:05] would ask the theologians to come and
[1:01:07] just take a
[1:01:08] picture of this group of people and then
[1:01:12] you can say this is the group that is
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:16] restoration oh Hallelujah and and and as
[1:01:19] I said before when when when when they
[1:01:21] went looking for uh the Revival there in
[1:01:24] in in in England amen the wells rev the
[1:01:27] Welsh Revival they asked the police
[1:01:30] officer sir can you tell me where is the
[1:01:35] Welsh Revival if there was anybody that
[1:01:37] should have knew how to get around the
[1:01:39] city it should have been that police
[1:01:42] officer come on somebody and they
[1:01:44] thought they were looking for an
[1:01:47] address praise God but the police
[1:01:50] officer had a revelation that the Welsh
[1:01:53] revivor is not found at an address if
[1:01:56] you're looking for the wealth Revival
[1:01:58] you have found it for I am the weal
[1:02:02] Revival amen it becomes
[1:02:05] personal sir and if somebody looking for
[1:02:08] the restoration they don't have to look
[1:02:09] any further look at you because you are
[1:02:12] part of the restoration that scripture
[1:02:15] was written about
[1:02:17] you our restore sayith the Lord that's

[1:03:00] restored back into the
[1:03:02] church hello and the final thing that
[1:03:04] came was the word glory to God that was
[1:03:07] restored back into the church so you

[1:04:32] would be happening in the church and and
[1:04:34] a lot of this uh from the days of Jesus
[1:04:37] all the way to now when you go through
[1:04:38] the seven Church ages the church just
[1:04:40] completely left the word they left the
[1:04:42] word God had to send a prophet to bring
[1:04:45] us back to the word and he's already
[1:04:47] done that amen he's already done that

[1:07:01] in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[1:07:03] Lord have said and in the remnant whom
[1:07:05] the Lord shall call now you know as uh
[1:07:09] we were here a few weeks ago the the
[1:07:12] Lord just did some mighty things
[1:07:14] wonderful things in our midst um the
[1:07:18] like the scripture say he would do
[1:07:19] wonderously with us and God came down
[1:07:21] and and dealt wondrously with his church
[1:07:24] especially with us going through through
[1:07:26] this this this this this Series this
[1:07:28] year uh which we watch God come and
[1:07:30] manifest himself right here in our midst
[1:07:34] amen amen amen uh and and if you notice
[1:07:39] there in verse 28 it said a couple
[1:07:41] things would happen it said that um he
[1:07:44] would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:07:46] it said that your sons and your
[1:07:48] daughters shall prophesy right and um
[1:07:51] and then it also said your old men shall
[1:07:53] dream dreams your young men shall see
[1:07:56] Visions glory to God let me just give
[1:07:59] you a really quick um uh quote brother
[1:08:04] Solomon sent this to me this week and
[1:08:06] and I thought it'd be very very uh
[1:08:07] helpful for us this is out of the sermon
[1:08:10] brother brandom preaches what Visions
[1:08:12] are Amen brother brandom actually
[1:08:14] telling us what Visions are now I want
[1:08:17] to just kind of testify just for a few
[1:08:19] minutes before I I preach there but it
[1:08:21] says in this in the sermon what Visions
[1:08:23] are it says but a
[1:08:26] vision is God by a word of
[1:08:32] knowledge dropping to the person to
[1:08:36] foresee or forsee something tell
[1:08:39] something that has been or something
[1:08:43] that will be now now now now what
[1:08:45] they're supposed to do is tell something
[1:08:47] that has been praise God or something
[1:08:52] that will be it says a vision a vision
[1:08:56] now according amen uh to what we just
[1:08:59] read here in Joel 2 that the um the uh
[1:09:04] uh the the the sons and daughters would
[1:09:06] prophesy the old men would dream dreams
[1:09:09] and the young men would see Visions now
[1:09:12] in uh the two weeks ago in our church
[1:09:16] three of those things manifested right
[1:09:19] here in front of us old men dream dreams
[1:09:23] I knew amen before I even came to church
[1:09:25] brother brother um uh Quinton Jr had
[1:09:29] come on that Wednesday night before we
[1:09:31] come on that Sunday he come on that
[1:09:33] Wednesday night and he was preaching
[1:09:34] about you know the gifts and he got to
[1:09:36] talking about dreams specifically and uh
[1:09:39] and I completely forgot but that morning
[1:09:42] uh I had a dream that uh and he said now
[1:09:45] you got to share it with people so it
[1:09:47] can be judged so I said oh my so I
[1:09:49] shared it with a couple people of the
[1:09:51] dream that the lord gave me and and I
[1:09:52] just didn't think too much of it right
[1:09:54] but you know kind of saw what was in the
[1:09:56] dream and and all of us kind of talked
[1:09:58] about it like okay we'll just let that
[1:10:00] be but as we come to the service on
[1:10:02] Sunday amen the scripture said that the
[1:10:06] uh uh Sons and Daughters would prophesy
[1:10:08] the tongues went forth in Prophecy amen
[1:10:12] a daughter of God released tongues and
[1:10:14] that was going forth in Prophecy and
[1:10:16] notice what the scripture says after
[1:10:18] that it says that your young man hello
[1:10:22] somebody would see visions
[1:10:26] and and and and what was told to me is
[1:10:28] that uh we as as the prophecy went forth
[1:10:31] and it was all done in
[1:10:34] decency and in order it was at the end
[1:10:37] of the service while we were worshiping
[1:10:39] this is I mean the word is already gone
[1:10:40] forth the other thing I want you to
[1:10:42] catch that that that it said there in
[1:10:43] the scripture in in in verse 32 it says
[1:10:46] uh those it says uhu uh whosoever shall
[1:10:50] call the name of the Lord shall be
[1:10:51] delivered there was Souls that came to
[1:10:54] the altar
[1:10:55] on that Sunday and they were not
[1:10:58] interrupted while they were at the altar
[1:11:00] God was dealing with his
[1:11:03] people I'm talking about backsliders
[1:11:06] coming back to God and I know how the
[1:11:08] devil like to fight backsliders but I'm
[1:11:11] here to tell the devil you are a liar
[1:11:14] God made a promise I will restore says
[1:11:18] the Lord and there is nothing the devil
[1:11:21] can do to stop the restoration
[1:11:24] Hallelujah
[1:11:26] amen if God made a promise it's got to
[1:11:28] come to pass in somebody's life has got
[1:11:31] to be manifested true so we watch Souls
[1:11:35] come and and and and after the souls
[1:11:37] come and went back to their seat and and
[1:11:39] the Lord just dealing with people then
[1:11:40] the tongues went forth and as we sat
[1:11:43] here we just waited on the Lord you know
[1:11:46] we we we we waited because we know that
[1:11:48] when you know brother bam had told us
[1:11:49] and I read it he said he told the sister
[1:11:51] said now sister she spoken tongues
[1:11:53] before he preached the word word he say
[1:11:56] sister I know it was on you it was on me
[1:11:58] too he says but it was just the wrong
[1:11:59] time he says but if he'll come back on
[1:12:02] you after the word has been preached he
[1:12:04] says I
[1:12:06] guarantee that there will be an
[1:12:08] interpretation to those
[1:12:10] tongues so we knew we had a guarantee
[1:12:12] because we had it lined up just right so
[1:12:15] you know I come out and I just begin to
[1:12:17] pray that's all I knew how to do is just
[1:12:18] pray and I said Lord um you told us
[1:12:22] through your Prophet that there's a
[1:12:23] guarantee that there would be an
[1:12:24] interpretation
[1:12:25] cuz everything is done just right I said
[1:12:27] Lord uh I say Lord we thank you Lord we
[1:12:30] thank you Lord we thank you something
[1:12:31] like that and you know I forget
[1:12:33] everything that I said you have to go
[1:12:34] back and look at the at the but I said
[1:12:36] something three times and then I said
[1:12:38] something else three times and then I
[1:12:40] said I bind the spirit of
[1:12:43] fear in the name of Jesus and and and
[1:12:46] one of the young men here in our church
[1:12:50] he said uh he heard a voice telling him
[1:12:54] what the interpretation was and he was
[1:12:55] sitting there praying Lord send the
[1:12:58] interpretation Lord send the
[1:12:59] interpretation and then he started
[1:13:01] praying Lord I don't think you giv me
[1:13:03] the
[1:13:04] interpretation no not me Lord but send
[1:13:07] it to somebody else Lord not me Lord and
[1:13:11] say he heard a voice and then before you
[1:13:14] know it amen it went from a voice to a
[1:13:16] vision and he actually saw the
[1:13:19] words he saw the word so he just read
[1:13:22] what he saw and he and he said that to
[1:13:24] the people and why did he have to do it
[1:13:27] that way because Joel
[1:13:30] said your young men will see
[1:13:39] Visions it happened right here yes sir
[1:13:43] well I just read the quote that brother
[1:13:45] Solomon gave me a vision is God by a
[1:13:48] word of knowledge and I notice that word
[1:13:51] of knowledge is actually one of the
[1:13:52] gifts one of the non-spiritual gifts a
[1:13:55] Vision amen is God by word of knowledge
[1:13:58] dropping to the person Amen to
[1:14:03] foresee or forsee something or tell
[1:14:06] something that has
[1:14:10] been or something that will be so it can
[1:14:13] be either one now yes sir we're not
[1:14:15] limiting
[1:14:17] God so the
[1:14:19] interpretation Amen on uh uh October
[1:14:23] 20th 2024
[1:14:25] after the tongues went forth the
[1:14:27] interpretation was and this is what our
[1:14:28] brother saw he just read it he read it
[1:14:31] from a vision have not I told
[1:14:35] you that's something that has been have
[1:14:38] not I told you that I am the Lord that
[1:14:44] speaketh I will do what I
[1:14:48] said I am the Lord that speaketh unto
[1:14:52] thee have not I spoken to
[1:14:55] you Hallelujah says I am the Lord that
[1:14:58] speaketh unto thee hearken unto my voice
[1:15:02] and I will speak unto
[1:15:04] thee so here we have you know the Lord
[1:15:07] telling us what he's got what he I've
[1:15:09] given you my promise it's right here
[1:15:10] I've been reading it all year long I've
[1:15:13] been reading it the entire year have not
[1:15:14] I spoken to you and and here's the thing
[1:15:16] he said he say hearken unto me he says
[1:15:19] hearken and I will speak that mean God
[1:15:21] ain't done
[1:15:23] yet TR am Hallelujah if we would align
[1:15:27] ourselves with the word of God we'll see
[1:15:30] God manifest himself I I told you church
[1:15:32] that I believe justification supposed to
[1:15:35] be in the church I believe
[1:15:36] sanctification because these are part of
[1:15:39] the restoration the gifts of the Spirit
[1:15:41] are supposed to be in the church I just
[1:15:43] believe Pentecost got it wrong but I
[1:15:46] believe Pentecost should see the right
[1:15:47] way to do it
[1:15:50] here amen we don't run from gifts we
[1:15:53] accept them because they're according to
[1:15:55] the scripture Amen Let me uh catch a
[1:15:58] quote now former and latter rain brother
[1:16:00] brandom gives us
[1:16:03] something Foreman L rain is the sermon
[1:16:06] that he is
[1:16:07] preaching amen and and just from the
[1:16:10] title
[1:16:13] um I didn't read verse 23 of Joel 2 but
[1:16:17] this is where you
[1:16:18] see this promise be glad then you
[1:16:20] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[1:16:22] your God for he has given you the former
[1:16:24] reign moderately and he will cause to
[1:16:27] come down for you the the rain the
[1:16:28] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:16:30] first month so this is a promise from
[1:16:32] almighty god brother brandom picks up
[1:16:34] this scripture and preaches a sermon for
[1:16:36] a sermon former and latter Reign he says
[1:16:39] this says watch the
[1:16:41] ministry of the Holy Ghost watch it
[1:16:44] today when it comes back it says the
[1:16:47] church has gradually been coming down
[1:16:50] the First Reformation was Luther we had
[1:16:53] a great big WI
[1:16:55] Place amen justification by faith the
[1:16:59] church was shook then come along Wesley
[1:17:02] the second Big Revival he says it shook
[1:17:06] it down to
[1:17:07] sanctification the church become in a
[1:17:10] minority greatly in the minority then
[1:17:12] after that come Pentecost the
[1:17:14] restoration of the gifts it shook it
[1:17:17] down now to just a little thing like a
[1:17:20] pyramid coming up but right at the end
[1:17:23] time before or the Capstone can come to
[1:17:27] the pyramid he says what about it what
[1:17:29] is it says then the church is really in
[1:17:31] the
[1:17:32] minority as it was in the days of Noah
[1:17:35] so will it be in the coming of the son
[1:17:37] of man where eight Souls were saved by
[1:17:39] water now it goes and says now the
[1:17:41] coming of the son of man what is it the
[1:17:44] church come from
[1:17:45] justification
[1:17:46] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:17:49] Spirit and now I like this now so it
[1:17:52] come from justification said that was
[1:17:54] was part of the restoration process the
[1:17:56] four life Messengers it says it come
[1:17:58] from justification sanctification
[1:18:01] baptism of the Holy Spirit and now
[1:18:05] Hallelujah now both former and latter
[1:18:09] rain come in amen amen after
[1:18:11] justification after sanctification after

[1:23:56] ain't saying it's coming I'm telling you
[1:23:59] it's
[1:24:02] here sir here brother brandom tells us
[1:24:05] in the message God keeps his word it
[1:24:08] says now the only
[1:24:10] thing that the Pentecostal he says I
[1:24:14] mean the real Pentecostal now now now
[1:24:16] now because here's the problem a lot of
[1:24:19] people have not been able to properly
[1:24:21] separate
[1:24:25] um the Pentecostal
[1:24:27] denomination from what really happened
[1:24:30] in the
[1:24:31] Bible when when brother Rand said a real
[1:24:33] Pentecost he going back to acts that
[1:24:36] that's Pentecostal but the Pentecostal
[1:24:38] denomination that's not I mean they were
[1:24:40] part of the restoration but they W in
[1:24:41] the finish of it they weren the Complete
[1:24:43] because they went into denomination that
[1:24:45] let you know something was wrong with it
[1:24:47] soon as they went to denomination
[1:24:48] something went wrong and many of us come
[1:24:50] out of that Hallelujah we thank God for
[1:24:53] the experience that we had back there I
[1:24:55] mean it was real y'all it was it was
[1:24:57] real I I had a grandma that was real she
[1:25:00] didn't play games with
[1:25:01] this amen they they live right and and
[1:25:05] you didn't go to church any kind of way
[1:25:08] glory to God they would pick up that sin
[1:25:10] in your life and once they pick it up
[1:25:12] they would take you to the Altar and
[1:25:14] pray you
[1:25:17] through hello somebody sisters gather
[1:25:20] around you hands on
[1:25:22] you they going to pray you through make
[1:25:25] sure that devil get off
[1:25:27] you they will not allow you to leave
[1:25:30] church to stay where you came you walked
[1:25:33] in there you was you was done
[1:25:36] for bottom line you w go I don't care
[1:25:39] how much you want to go back out and
[1:25:40] keep living that life not in theend not
[1:25:42] in the the original churches now
[1:25:44] nowadays it's it's it's it's I'll just
[1:25:47] say
[1:25:49] nonsense amen amen amen but uh but here
[1:25:53] the prophet is telling us these things
[1:25:54] now now he says but the real Pentecostal
[1:25:57] message the real one now the real
[1:25:59] Pentecostal message is nothing but a
[1:26:04] restoration of the same thing that went
[1:26:07] into the ground that's been packed that
[1:26:11] means it's been carried
[1:26:13] hallelujah it's been carried through
[1:26:16] Lutheran it's been carried through
[1:26:19] Methodist it's been carried through
[1:26:22] Baptist it's been carried through
[1:26:24] Presbyterian and I say even through the
[1:26:27] Pentecostal organization it's been
[1:26:29] carried yes sir yes sir oh there was
[1:26:32] life in it now it had to be carried
[1:26:35] through that if you came out of the
[1:26:36] Methodist or the Catholic or the Baptist
[1:26:39] or whatever Church you come out of to
[1:26:40] this message it was carrying
[1:26:44] you it was all part of the process don't
[1:26:46] let me just finish reading the quotes
[1:26:48] let me finish reading the quote he he
[1:26:49] says something here that that that that
[1:26:52] I think would just help us just a little
[1:26:53] bit watch it watch he says this he
[1:26:57] says it's the same thing that went into
[1:26:59] the ground that's been packed through
[1:27:00] the Lutheran Methodist Baptist
[1:27:03] Presbyterian now just comes to an
[1:27:06] ear watch it now now it says as bad as I
[1:27:09] hate to make this statement there has
[1:27:12] been some
[1:27:13] fungus growing on it and eup Farmers
[1:27:16] know what that is is something that
[1:27:20] imitates the ear now that's what we're
[1:27:24] wanting to cut out cut at tonight
[1:27:26] because if you don't pull it off your
[1:27:28] corn it'll cause the whole patch to go
[1:27:33] bad my God my God my God my God now now
[1:27:37] I want you to understand something about
[1:27:38] when brother V talk about the the ear um
[1:27:41] so when you look at corn you have this
[1:27:44] this shuck on the outside and that's
[1:27:48] protecting the ear on the inside
[1:27:52] Hallelujah right that's what protects
[1:27:55] the ear he said but there's fungus
[1:27:56] growing on that outside and if we if we
[1:27:59] let that fungus stay there it's going to
[1:28:00] mess up everything so he said but we got
[1:28:02] to address that fungus get that fungus
[1:28:04] out of there because we want real corn
[1:28:07] yes sir Amen brother when you got a good
[1:28:10] batch of
[1:28:12] corn sweet
[1:28:14] corn ain't nothing like it you can I
[1:28:18] mean some boil it some roast
[1:28:22] it some fry it some eat it
[1:28:29] raw
[1:28:31] butter my God it ain't nothing like a
[1:28:34] real good corn
[1:28:37] right some of I mean you go to the fair
[1:28:40] they take it all off of you and put it
[1:28:41] in a cup my God is some of the best
[1:28:44] eating you ever had but but but but here
[1:28:47] you know brother brand trying to trying
[1:28:49] to share you know just tell us how this
[1:28:51] process is going because when you were
[1:28:53] in your denomination chur is you were in
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:56] shook now now let me help you understand
[1:28:59] you need the shook to protect the corn
[1:29:02] on the
[1:29:04] inside but I can't eat
[1:29:08] shuck I needed the shook but I can't eat
[1:29:12] shook that's not why when I go pull that
[1:29:15] corn I'm pulling a shuck off so I can
[1:29:18] get down to the real
[1:29:22] corn Hallelujah and I don't think none
[1:29:25] of y'all eat corn cob do y'all that's
[1:29:27] inside the corn that's a little cob
[1:29:29] inside the corn I hope y'all ain't doing
[1:29:30] that right but but it it but you can
[1:29:32] tell when you done ate the corn because
[1:29:34] you look at the cob the cob look a
[1:29:36] little
[1:29:39] different let me uh let me go on let me
[1:29:42] go on let me go on he says so that is
[1:29:45] one thing I wish to make
[1:29:48] clear that the people of all
[1:29:51] denominational churches as they have
[1:29:54] come up through great times yes they did
[1:29:58] I the scripture actually said we read it
[1:30:01] here you can leave the quote there but
[1:30:03] the the the scripture said that the rain
[1:30:05] would come down
[1:30:07] moderately so they had great times right
[1:30:11] he says this he says it's it's it it's
[1:30:13] been the
[1:30:15] maturing glory to God we thank God for
[1:30:17] the great times but now it's been the
[1:30:19] maturing and now the church is in the
[1:30:22] seed and it's got to bring forth the
[1:30:24] same thing that went into the ground the
[1:30:26] the Shu won't reproduce itself but
[1:30:29] brother the corn kernel it'll reproduce
[1:30:32] itself Oh My My My unless you take that
[1:30:36] corn of Wheat and go on the ground and
[1:30:38] die and
[1:30:40] rot say then then it'll bring forth
[1:30:42] it'll bring forth more right and this
[1:30:44] what we're looking for he he says this
[1:30:46] he says um it's um it says now the
[1:30:49] church is in the seed and it's go it's
[1:30:51] got to bring forth the same thing that
[1:30:52] went into the ground so it's just a
[1:30:55] fully mature church that we're living in
[1:30:59] can I just I want to make it clear of
[1:31:02] what I'm saying and why I'm reading this
[1:31:04] when we saw how God manifested himself
[1:31:08] in our midst of couple weeks ago that
[1:31:11] showed that the church had come to a
[1:31:13] place of full maturity the gifts knew
[1:31:16] how to conduct themselves yes sir and
[1:31:19] and and and let let me let me let me
[1:31:20] help you to understand there was an
[1:31:22] anointing from the song servant
[1:31:25] in that service from the song service
[1:31:27] for there was a an anointing where
[1:31:29] easily tongues could have went forth but
[1:31:32] it took
[1:31:33] control self-control even from when at
[1:31:37] the end of the service where you know uh
[1:31:39] the the Altera been made there was still
[1:31:41] a great anointing even during the
[1:31:42] preaching a great anointing but it took
[1:31:45] self-control yes
[1:31:47] sir and when we M when we're fully
[1:31:50] matured we got the self-control then we
[1:31:53] can see God manifest himself the way
[1:31:55] that he wants to man now it's up to God
[1:31:57] to do these things we don't we don't
[1:31:58] come in here and try to make something
[1:32:00] happen okay let's try to do the same
[1:32:01] thing we did two weeks AG no no no no no
[1:32:03] no that's not what I'm talking about I
[1:32:05] am saying that I am saying that we're
[1:32:08] not afraid of God if he want to do that
[1:32:10] now now now let me also help you help
[1:32:12] you understand something
[1:32:13] else every city that the prophet went to
[1:32:17] the supernatural showed up yes sir all
[1:32:20] right yes sir brother brandom could be
[1:32:22] in Jeffersonville the supernatural show
[1:32:24] up he can go to videlia Illinois the
[1:32:27] supernatural showed up he can go all the
[1:32:29] way down to deran South Africa the
[1:32:31] supernatural showed up he can come here
[1:32:33] to West Palm Beach the supernatural
[1:32:35] showed up wherever the prophet went the
[1:32:38] supernatural was following him praise
[1:32:40] the Lord so so if if he had the
[1:32:42] supernatural everywhere he
[1:32:45] went why why should we expect
[1:32:50] less exactly right so every time I come
[1:32:52] I expect God to do something
[1:32:54] something even I told y'all even when we
[1:32:57] go to the New Jerusalem uh the the the
[1:33:00] trees are going to be planted along the
[1:33:02] the the the River of Life and as those
[1:33:04] trees are planted say they will bear
[1:33:05] fruit every
[1:33:07] month praise God so God planted a tree
[1:33:10] at Pentecost and why can't that tree
[1:33:12] bear every month sir all right just just
[1:33:17] laying it out there all right he says so
[1:33:20] it's just a fully matur church that
[1:33:22] we're living in
[1:33:24] and one part cannot say thus to the
[1:33:26] other part for they live good in their
[1:33:31] day and they were the corn patch in
[1:33:35] God's
[1:33:36] sight so we do not wish
[1:33:41] to the prophet says we do not wish to
[1:33:46] belittle anyone what is he saying what
[1:33:48] is he say I'm not belittling my
[1:33:50] experience in my Methodist Church I'm
[1:33:54] not belittling my experience in my
[1:33:56] Pentecostal church I'm not belittling my
[1:33:59] experience in my Baptist Church I'm not
[1:34:02] belittling my experience in my Catholic
[1:34:04] church amen don't let anybody belittle
[1:34:07] your experience in those places that's
[1:34:09] that was just part of your
[1:34:11] journey amen amen amen oh I come to find
[1:34:15] out something that the steps of the
[1:34:17] righteous are ordered of the Lord so
[1:34:20] every step that I took God wanted me to
[1:34:22] take can I go a little further I'm not
[1:34:25] even belit my experience in some of the
[1:34:27] message
[1:34:28] churches that I've been a part
[1:34:31] of some of the message experiences that
[1:34:34] I had so I mean some of the stuff that
[1:34:37] we done went through it would cause some
[1:34:39] people to go right back out into the
[1:34:40] world but something got a hold of me
[1:34:43] something keep holding me that I knew
[1:34:45] that this message was right maybe the
[1:34:48] people weren't right but the message is
[1:34:52] Right amen and it was enough to hold me
[1:34:55] to keep me no matter what people were
[1:34:56] saying and doing glory to God so I'm not
[1:35:00] belittling any of my
[1:35:03] experiences I thank God for it all but
[1:35:06] we're just coming to a place of
[1:35:08] maturity you know even when you're going
[1:35:11] through life and your place and you're
[1:35:12] coming to maturity there's little things
[1:35:13] you got to go through in life in order
[1:35:15] to get there that's what helps you come
[1:35:17] to maturity when you endure some of
[1:35:19] those trials now here uh Mark Mark 4 28-
[1:35:24] 29 let's just read that really
[1:35:26] quick glory to God I I have um told you
[1:35:31] a lot
[1:35:33] of lot of hay on the fork and I know I
[1:35:36] can't get it all off but I I I come to
[1:35:39] realize that even though you know I
[1:35:41] preaching to you know the congregation
[1:35:43] that's here there's so many different
[1:35:45] people watching our this this our
[1:35:47] service that uh I have to make sure that
[1:35:50] they they're getting what we're trying
[1:35:51] to say right the church has has come to
[1:35:54] a place of maturity if if if if anybody
[1:35:57] been a part of church you you've seen
[1:35:58] the change in church and how it's not
[1:36:01] what it used to be I'm talking about
[1:36:04] denominational churches it is not what
[1:36:06] it you you know that there's been a
[1:36:08] complete change a big drop off big drop
[1:36:11] off like I remember when I was a little
[1:36:13] girl church was like this they don't
[1:36:14] have that no more none of those things
[1:36:16] in place anymore and and and it's
[1:36:18] because the the the Palmer worm the
[1:36:21] cankerworm the Locust the caterpillar C
[1:36:23] and ate the life out of the
[1:36:26] church but the restoration happened
[1:36:28] because there was a little life left in
[1:36:30] the root of the
[1:36:31] tree oh my God we're experiencing that
[1:36:35] restoration we're living it right now
[1:36:37] this is this is what this is all about
[1:36:39] and I'm going to I'm going to show in
[1:36:40] scripture I'm going to show in scripture
[1:36:43] how all of this kind of ties in just
[1:36:44] give me a little chance to get there and
[1:36:46] I might not get it all today but I get
[1:36:48] to some of it amen Mark 4: 28-29 brother
[1:36:52] Brandon was you know in this previous
[1:36:54] quote was talking about amen the
[1:36:58] uh it it's coming to an ear and I just
[1:37:00] want to throw the scripture there with
[1:37:02] it Mark 4:28 through 29 for the Earth
[1:37:05] bringeth forth fruit of
[1:37:08] herself first the
[1:37:10] blade then the ear and after that the
[1:37:13] full corn in the ear the full corn in
[1:37:18] the ear he says but when the when the
[1:37:20] fruit is brought forth immediately he
[1:37:23] putteth in the sickle because the
[1:37:26] Harvest is come and see we this and I'm
[1:37:29] setting you up for another quote this is
[1:37:31] the season of the Harvest
[1:37:35] amall uh last time I I I spoke uh and
[1:37:40] I'm my next quote I'm going to
[1:37:41] Exposition exposition of seven Church
[1:37:43] ages but last time I spoke I read the
[1:37:45] quotes to you all of brother brandom's
[1:37:48] prophecy we
[1:37:50] are this this room that we're sitting in
[1:37:54] is a room where people come to
[1:37:58] vote and this week there would be a lot
[1:38:02] of folk that would go in and out of this
[1:38:03] room and voting not even knowing what
[1:38:06] they're
[1:38:08] doing we have the
[1:38:11] benefit of having a prophet that told us
[1:38:15] things that would happen before the
[1:38:17] coming of the Lord so let me just let me
[1:38:19] make it very clear it don't matter to me
[1:38:21] which way the election go
[1:38:24] I'm looking at the
[1:38:26] prophecy and and what I see in the
[1:38:28] prophecy what I read to you all he said
[1:38:31] that there would either be a woman vice
[1:38:34] president or president
[1:38:36] well there is a current woman vice
[1:38:39] president and that tells me that the
[1:38:42] prophecy in my book has already been
[1:38:46] fulfilled if she happens to become
[1:38:49] president the prophecy has already been
[1:38:52] fulfilled
[1:38:55] but the last Vision
[1:38:57] said praise God don't stop at the sixth
[1:39:01] Vision the last Vision said there would
[1:39:04] be
[1:39:05] debris all over the land of America sir
[1:39:10] now I don't know about
[1:39:12] you but my expectation is that I won't
[1:39:17] be here to see debris

[1:39:26] amen you looking for debris not
[1:39:31] me I can just tell you that if all these
[1:39:33] other things have come to pass this also
[1:39:36] will come to pass now now brother Jack
[1:39:39] where are you placing yourself I'm
[1:39:40] placing myself in the same place as
[1:39:44] actually Abraham but praise God Abraham
[1:39:49] had a nephew by the name of
[1:39:52] lot and Before Destruction could strike
[1:39:56] Sodom and

[1:40:16] could call lot out and he wasn't even a
[1:40:18] True Believer hello somebody if he can
[1:40:21] call lot out I believe he's going to
[1:40:23] call his bride out before the breis all

[1:43:17] stage why was Pentecost not the complete
[1:43:21] restoration yes they had to give yes we
[1:43:23] thank God for it and I believe they
[1:43:24] should be in the church but that was not
[1:43:27] the end of
[1:43:29] it that was not the end of it and this
[1:43:31] is why this is why we're can say
[1:43:33] Pentecost was not the complete
[1:43:34] restoration but I can tell you you are
[1:43:37] sir you are the complete restoration now
[1:43:39] watch what what the prophet says here in
[1:43:41] the message exp exposition of the seven
[1:43:43] Church ages and as coming out of the
[1:43:46] section A resum of the age he says but
[1:43:48] what about the true
[1:43:50] seed it will happen just as we have said
[1:43:55] the people of God are being made ready
[1:43:57] by the word of Truth now we're being
[1:44:00] made ready by the word of truth from the
[1:44:02] messenger to this age now I I I just
[1:44:05] need to make sure people understand look
[1:44:08] I know some some people say I don't

[1:44:15] like he quote brother brandom more than
[1:44:17] he quote
[1:44:19] Jesus that's not what's really going on
[1:44:21] that's what the devil trying to show you
[1:44:23] that's right that's not what the devil
[1:44:24] showing but the only way you're going to
[1:44:26] be made ready for Jesus Second
[1:44:29] Coming Hallelujah I'm going to have to
[1:44:31] tell you what the prophet

[1:45:43] order to give the respect of the people
[1:45:46] hello somebody cuz they knew they

[1:48:12] to
[1:48:13] mention here in this
[1:48:18] quote but what about the true SE they
[1:48:21] will happen just as we've said the

[1:48:35] be the
[1:48:37] fullness of
[1:48:39] Pentecost it's going to be here church
[1:48:42] and ain't nothing anybody can do to stop
[1:48:43] it you can't preach this out of the
[1:48:45] church when the prophet preached in amen
[1:48:49] hallelujah now we know about fanaticism
[1:48:51] we realize that but we not talk about
[1:48:53] finessing we talk about a fully mature
[1:48:55] Church praise God it says in
[1:48:58] her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:49:02] for the spirit for the spirit will bring
[1:49:06] the people right back to where they were
[1:49:09] at the
[1:49:10] beginning the spirit going to do it yes
[1:49:14] sir and look at what he said that
[1:49:18] is thus saith the Lord amen
[1:49:23] amen it says it is thus sayith the Lord
[1:49:26] for that is what Joel 223 through 26
[1:49:31] says and he's reading the verse now be
[1:49:34] glad then ye children of Zion and
[1:49:36] rejoice in the Lord your God for he have
[1:49:38] given you the former rain moderately and
[1:49:41] he will cause to come down for you the
[1:49:43] rain the former rain and the latter rain
[1:49:44] in the first month and the floor shall
[1:49:46] be full of Wheat and the fat shall
[1:49:48] overflow with wine and oil stimulation
[1:49:50] of Revelation says in our rest to you
[1:49:53] the years that the Locust ha eaten the
[1:49:54] korm the caterpillar and the pal my
[1:49:56] great Army which I sent among you and ye
[1:49:58] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[1:50:01] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:50:02] that have dealt wondrously with you and
[1:50:04] my people should never be ashamed now it
[1:50:06] says God is going to restore the
[1:50:10] Lutheran age did not restore the church
[1:50:13] praise God it started a Reformation the
[1:50:17] Wesleyan age did not
[1:50:20] restore the Pentecostal age age which
[1:50:23] which released the gifts but it did not
[1:50:27] restore Hallelujah but God has to
[1:50:30] restore for he cannot deny his word this
[1:50:33] is not the resurrection of the church it
[1:50:37] is the
[1:50:39] restoration amen it says God will take
[1:50:42] the church right back to Pentecost of
[1:50:47] the beginning what we see in the book of
[1:50:49] Acts we will see in the church today yes
[1:50:53] sir but this group won't be like the
[1:50:55] Corinthians that's why we had to go back
[1:50:57] and read Corinthians cuz Paul said now
[1:50:59] now when when tongues come in Among Us
[1:51:01] he says uh two or at Mo at most three
[1:51:08] yes sir that mean you can't get it out
[1:51:09] of order and have four five six seven
[1:51:11] people going off with tongues no you
[1:51:13] hear two people don't went off and you
[1:51:16] the third one the fourth one may be
[1:51:17] feeling the spirit like oh I feel it I
[1:51:19] feel it self-control yes
[1:51:23] sir hopefully you feel that
[1:51:27] too cuz you're going to need it we going
[1:51:30] we this going to be according to
[1:51:31] scripture amen hello amen all right
[1:51:35] that's what Paul that's why Paul had to
[1:51:36] get the Corinthians back in line two or
[1:51:38] at most three yes sir amen see Pentecost
[1:51:43] is just they they way out there I they
[1:51:45] 15 20 305 everybody in the church
[1:51:48] they're going to make speaking tongues
[1:51:50] no do all have the gift of tongues Paul
[1:51:53] asked the question do all have it no we
[1:51:56] all don't have it do all have interpret
[1:51:59] everybody might not hear a voice and
[1:52:01] then see a
[1:52:02] vision everybody might not have that but
[1:52:05] I know that in every church God has
[1:52:07] people with the gifts I know that much
[1:52:11] and all we got to do is get them aligned
[1:52:13] properly and encourage people in the
[1:52:15] proper
[1:52:16] way like brother Seth told us don't
[1:52:19] don't don't don't don't criticize it
[1:52:21] rally around
[1:52:23] it rally around it amen let let's let's
[1:52:26] let's let's let's let's let's go on he
[1:52:27] says this the Lutheran AG did not
[1:52:30] restore the church it started
[1:52:32] Reformation the westling age did not
[1:52:33] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[1:52:34] restore but God has to restore for he
[1:52:36] cannot deny his word this is not the
[1:52:39] resurrection of the church it is the
[1:52:42] restoration God will take the church
[1:52:45] right back to Pentecost of the beginning
[1:52:49] now notice in verse 25 it says it tells
[1:52:52] why we need restoration this is why we
[1:52:54] need it he says the Locust the
[1:52:56] cankerworm caterpillar and Palmer worm
[1:53:00] have eaten all but the root and a small
[1:53:04] bit of the stem now we are told that all
[1:53:07] these insects are all one and the same
[1:53:09] in different stages that is right they
[1:53:12] are the Antichrist Spirit manifested
[1:53:15] where is it man where where do we see
[1:53:16] that in Christ spirit is manifested in
[1:53:19] organization denomination and Doctrine
[1:53:23] Through the Ages this why you can't take
[1:53:25] me back to organization the Antichrist
[1:53:28] spirit is there I don't care how
[1:53:30] religious they are I don't care how big

[1:57:27] brother random says
[1:57:29] this the Antichrist Spirit they are the
[1:57:31] Antichrist Spirit manifest in
[1:57:33] organization denomination false Doctrine
[1:57:36] Through the Ages and the poor little
[1:57:38] root and stalk is going to be restored
[1:57:40] watch it now God isn't going to plant a
[1:57:42] new church but it's going to bring his
[1:57:44] original planting back to original seed
[1:57:47] and look at what it says he is doing it
[1:57:49] as stated in verse 23 by the
[1:57:52] teaching or former rain next will come
[1:57:57] Harvest rain amen or rapturing faith so
[1:58:02] former rain and latter rain coming
[1:58:03] together and brother brandham called
[1:58:05] that latter ring he had a harvest rain
[1:58:08] he said also Rapture in faith that's why
[1:58:11] I'm not looking for
[1:58:16] debris I'm looking for a quick change of
[1:58:18] the
[1:58:19] body and we shall be changed in the
[1:58:22] moment in the twinkling of an eye try to
[1:58:25] twinkle your eye faster than that we'll
[1:58:28] be
[1:58:31] gone it says thus at this very
[1:58:35] moment we are in the complete
[1:58:37] fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much
[1:58:40] that if it were possible they shall
[1:58:42] deceive the very leg and who is that
[1:58:45] shall attempt to deceive the very leg
[1:58:47] who is it while the spirit of antichrist
[1:58:50] and the false anointed ones of the LA of
[1:58:52] this last day these false ones have
[1:58:54] already come in jesus' name claiming
[1:58:56] that they have been anointed of God for
[1:58:58] the last day they are false
[1:59:01] Messiahs anointed ones they claim that
[1:59:04] they are
[1:59:07] prophets but are they one with a word
[1:59:09] now this is very important I I I got to
[1:59:11] drop you know because you got a lot of
[1:59:12] people rising up and they I've seen
[1:59:15] people get offended that we we quote

[1:59:31] quote God's Vindicated Prophet right and
[1:59:34] uh and and they get offended by that and
[1:59:36] and and they don't realize that even in
[1:59:38] the days of Jeremiah there's a whole
[1:59:40] bunch of prophets yes there's a lot of
[1:59:43] them right one guy come

[2:00:05] bondage and you here with this great um
[2:00:09] theatrical uh yoke that you done broke
[2:00:11] and trying to say that the and you done
[2:00:13] lie to the people but but Jeremiah
[2:00:15] didn't even correct them in front of
[2:00:17] everybody you know what Jeremiah said
[2:00:19] after that man gave that false prophecy
[2:00:23] Jeremiah and the Bible said it Jeremiah
[2:00:25] said
[2:00:29] amen I can just see it Jeremiah amen
[2:00:33] glory
[2:00:35] amen but after church you went in there
[2:00:38] and prophesied that lie you going to die
[2:00:40] without seeing it and within a year that
[2:00:42] man was dead sir now which prophet was
[2:00:48] right Lord y'all just don't get me it's
[2:00:51] all what kind of prophecies going on
[2:00:53] about the
[2:00:54] election prophecies yes
[2:00:57] sir Church world just just just just
[2:00:59] enamored by it one one of my friends
[2:01:01] just to calling me just giving me all
[2:01:02] these prophets I
[2:01:06] said God sent us a
[2:01:08] prophet and I know what he said I only
[2:01:12] trust what he said now look I'mma tell
[2:01:14] you what he said then already come to
[2:01:17] pass for me that that's just me but but
[2:01:19] but if if something else happen happened
[2:01:22] in this election that just mean a triple
[2:01:24] fulfillment of the
[2:01:25] prophecy you know what he said because
[2:01:27] he said that um uh the the first
[2:01:30] fulfillment of he says that a woman
[2:01:32] would win the popular vote Hillary
[2:01:35] Clinton won the popular vote the the
[2:01:38] first time that that she lost to uh to
[2:01:41] Trump she won the popular vote that was
[2:01:43] a fulfillment of the of the prophecy
[2:01:46] well then it come back we get a vice
[2:01:47] president and now my my daughter sent me
[2:01:51] the little clip sent to my wife my wife
[2:01:52] sent to me there
[2:01:54] was about an hour or two of Joe Biden's
[2:01:58] term that he had to go on inury and KLA
[2:02:02] Harris was President for about two hours
[2:02:05] another fulfillment of the prophecy I
[2:02:07] don't need no
[2:02:08] more I don't need no more I'm I'm I'm
[2:02:11] done with it debris but I ain't looking
[2:02:14] for
[2:02:16] it there's a Rapture here
[2:02:19] somewhere between here and there
[2:02:22] is a
[2:02:25] Rapture and that's what I'm looking for
[2:02:28] that's what I got my eyes on a changing
[2:02:31] of the
[2:02:32] body yes
[2:02:34] sir I'm I'm I'm coming
[2:02:40] home uh these false ones have already
[2:02:43] come in jesus' name claiming that they
[2:02:45] have been
[2:02:47] anointed of God for the last day they
[2:02:49] are false Messiah anointed ones they
[2:02:50] claim that they are prophets but they
[2:02:52] are are they one with a
[2:02:54] word never it says they have added to it
[2:02:58] or taken from it no one denies that the
[2:03:01] spirit of God uh spirit of God
[2:03:03] manifesting in gifts is upon them now
[2:03:05] I'm going to tell you something that add
[2:03:06] into it and take it from it sometimes
[2:03:08] these new translations of the scripture
[2:03:11] be careful with them I only use the
[2:03:14] translations that the prophet
[2:03:17] used amen I I don't use these these
[2:03:21] other transl
[2:03:22] especially I used to somebody bought me
[2:03:25] um the um amplifier I stopped using it
[2:03:29] and the only reason I stopped using is
[2:03:30] because when I you you can go to the
[2:03:32] front of your Bible and see how that
[2:03:33] Bible was created the Amplified Bible
[2:03:35] was created by a very smart
[2:03:38] woman they they said man she studied she
[2:03:40] studied she studied so theologians got
[2:03:42] behind her supported her and said let
[2:03:44] her write the Bible based on how she
[2:03:45] studyed now if a woman can't
[2:03:49] preach how can a woman write the Bible
[2:03:53] hello church so I don't quote from that
[2:03:56] amen and and if you talk about well I
[2:03:58] need something just just a little more
[2:04:00] my term so I can read I we had a prophet
[2:04:04] with
[2:04:05] a seventh grade education and if he
[2:04:09] ain't speaking on your
[2:04:16] level just say what the prophet said all
[2:04:19] right I'm going further I I got to I got
[2:04:21] to go I'm leaving I on my time I say 5
[2:04:24] minutes I got to say something before I
[2:04:25] get get get get out of here let me let
[2:04:27] me let me read this um claiming that
[2:04:29] they uh have been anointed of God for
[2:04:31] the last day they are the false
[2:04:33] messiah's anointed ones that claim that
[2:04:34] they are the prophets but are are they
[2:04:37] one with word never they have added to
[2:04:39] it or taken from it no one denies that
[2:04:42] the spirit of God manifested in gifts is
[2:04:44] upon them but like balum they all have
[2:04:48] their programs make their appeal for
[2:04:49] money exercise gifts but deny the word
[2:04:53] or bypass it for fear that a controversy
[2:04:57] might diminish their chances for greater
[2:04:59] gain we not denying this word that's the
[2:05:02] fourth stage of the restoration yet they
[2:05:05] preach salvation and deliverance through
[2:05:07] the power of God just like
[2:05:11] Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ
[2:05:14] what you got a Judas had a Ministry that
[2:05:16] was given to him by Jesus and Jesus knew
[2:05:19] that he wouldn't handle the ministry
[2:05:20] right
[2:05:23] you better make sure you following the
[2:05:25] church that's on the word yes sir but
[2:05:27] because they are wrong the wrong seed
[2:05:30] consequently they would have a wrong
[2:05:32] Spirit motivating them
[2:05:35] religious oh my look at this now they
[2:05:37] outshine the elect in effort and Zeal
[2:05:40] but in but is it is laid the sin not of
[2:05:43] Christ watch now for it looks for big
[2:05:47] crowds big
[2:05:49] programs and startling signs amongst
[2:05:52] them they preach the second coming of
[2:05:55] Christ but watch this but
[2:05:58] deny the Advent of the Prophet
[2:06:02] messenger now now let me just give you
[2:06:05] because I've read this quote many times
[2:06:06] but I never stopped to look up the word
[2:06:08] Advent you know what Advent means the
[2:06:12] arrival of a notable person thing or
[2:06:16] event so they deny the
[2:06:19] arrival of God's prophet
[2:06:22] not only have they denied their arrival
[2:06:24] if you can't accept that he came you
[2:06:26] certainly you know ain't going to see
[2:06:27] that he came left and now all you ain't
[2:06:29] going to see nothing right but we
[2:06:31] telling you he's come he's gone and and
[2:06:33] he was promised to come according to
[2:06:35] scriptures now I can say what I want to
[2:06:37] see now let me finish this right that
[2:06:39] they preached the second coming of
[2:06:40] Christ but Deni the Advent of the
[2:06:42] Prophet messenger though in power and in
[2:06:44] signs and in true Revelation he eclipses
[2:06:47] them all ah yes the this false spirit
[2:06:50] that in the last days is so close to the
[2:06:52] real can be distinguished only by its
[2:06:55] deviation from the word and whenever it
[2:06:57] is caught in being anti- it falls back
[2:07:00] on one
[2:07:01] argument we have already shown to be
[2:07:04] false they only have one argument and
[2:07:06] this is the argument we get results
[2:07:09] don't
[2:07:11] we and since we get
[2:07:13] results we have to be of God well the
[2:07:18] church minority will actually say m i
[2:07:21] don't care care what results you get it
[2:07:24] don't mean it's of God if it deviates
[2:07:27] from the
[2:07:28] word it is not from God it is
[2:07:36] Antichrist I'mma just say this last
[2:07:38] thing and and here's here's what I'm GNA
[2:07:40] do I'mma say it and then I'm I'mma leave
[2:07:43] you in a spot where if you want to hear
[2:07:45] the rest of it you either got to come
[2:07:47] back or you got to tune
[2:07:50] in they deny the
[2:07:56] Advent of the Prophet
[2:08:00] messenger according to
[2:08:02] scripture God told us that he was going
[2:08:06] to send Elijah the prophet before the
[2:08:09] great and terrible day of the Lord just
[2:08:11] pull that up really quick Malachi 4:5
[2:08:13] and6 the very last verse of scripture in
[2:08:17] the Old
[2:08:18] Testament God prophesies right here that
[2:08:22] behold I will send you who is
[2:08:26] you me I will send and if you want to
[2:08:30] put yourself there then God was talking
[2:08:32] to you behold I will send you
[2:08:34] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[2:08:38] the great and ter and Dreadful day of
[2:08:40] the Lord It also says in verse six and
[2:08:43] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:08:46] to the children and the Heart of the
[2:08:48] children to their fathers lest I come
[2:08:51] and SM Mite the Earth with a curse very
[2:08:53] last two verses of the Old Testament God
[2:08:58] promised that he was going to do this
[2:08:59] now I
[2:09:05] have 10 other
[2:09:07] scriptures that I need to read but I
[2:09:10] don't have time today that actually
[2:09:12] identifies that brother Brandon was
[2:09:14] promised according to scripture to come
[2:09:17] 10
[2:09:19] more 10 and I'm going to take my time
[2:09:22] and read them all for you but on this
[2:09:24] one that I just read I need you to
[2:09:26] understand something my time was getting
[2:09:27] ready to go off so let me just stop it
[2:09:29] real quick and I'm I'm I'm coming home I
[2:09:31] need to see now I said behold I send you
[2:09:33] Elijah the prophet that was verse five
[2:09:35] here's the other thing that you need to
[2:09:36] understand do you realize that the
[2:09:39] spirit of Elijah was promised to be used
[2:09:43] five
[2:09:46] times sir five times in the Bible God
[2:09:50] was using the spirit Elijah it came in
[2:09:53] Elijah and I and I I I I'm going read it
[2:09:56] I ain't got time today I promise you
[2:09:58] I'll read it it came in Elijah you read
[2:10:01] his story in First Kings 17 and and
[2:10:03] there's a very a very uh specific spot
[2:10:06] in First Kings 18 verse 36-37 that you
[2:10:10] read in those verses uh Elijah's
[2:10:13] Ministry was a
[2:10:14] restoration
[2:10:17] Ministry Hallelujah so so at first time
[2:10:20] the spirit of Elijah come comes it comes
[2:10:21] in Elijah himself where he had a a
[2:10:26] little
[2:10:28] Protegé that was following him by the
[2:10:30] name of
[2:10:32] Elisha how did how did he even get the

[2:11:18] your
[2:11:19] spirit he he say now you don't ask a big
[2:11:22] thing Elisha but nevertheless if you see
[2:11:26] me when I go you can have a double
[2:11:29] portion of my spirit and brother when
[2:11:32] them chairs of fire come down and they
[2:11:35] separate Elijah from Elisha carrying
[2:11:37] Elish Elijah away Elisha say oh my
[2:11:41] father my father he threw that Ro back
[2:11:43] down yes sir Elisha grab the Rob my God
[2:11:47] WRA it around himself and walk down to
[2:11:49] the same Jordan River he

[2:12:05] results you asked me a question where I
[2:12:07] am I'm right here and soon as the
[2:12:09] waterers part he walked and and walked
[2:12:11] across on dry land and then it was the
[2:12:13] the the the the prophets the school of
[2:12:15] the Prophet
[2:12:16] say uh the spirit of elishah is with uh
[2:12:20] Elisha that spirit is with him he's
[2:12:22] Anointed with that they they could tell
[2:12:24] that was the second time it came the
[2:12:26] third time and I I'll read I promise you
[2:12:29] I'm just quoting it now but I'll read it
[2:12:30] for you you got to tune in and you got
[2:12:33] to come the third time the spirit of
[2:12:35] Elijah was promised was in John the
[2:12:37] Baptist according to Malachi 3 as well
[2:12:40] as according to Malachi 4 what I just
[2:12:42] read John the Baptist ministry was a
[2:12:44] part of
[2:12:46] that the fourth
[2:12:48] one was in William Mary and brandham if
[2:12:51] I can call Elijah's name and I can call
[2:12:54] Elisha's name and you don't get offended
[2:12:57] hello and I can call John the Baptist
[2:12:58] name and you don't get offended don't
[2:13:00] you get offended when I say William Mary
[2:13:02] and Brandon that's right
[2:13:04] brother because all this is in the
[2:13:09] scripture
[2:13:11] hello and see we living in this
[2:13:14] forthcoming of Elijah which is under the
[2:13:16] ministry of William Brandon William
[2:13:18] Mariam Brandon which was a restoration
[2:13:20] Ministry yes sir and the last time that
[2:13:23] Elijah himself comes is as one of the
[2:13:26] two witnesses according to Revelation 11
[2:13:29] five times God uses that Spirit on this
[2:13:32] Earth yes sir five times it's in your
[2:13:37] Bible So when you say why y'all be
[2:13:39] quoting the
[2:13:42] prophet because I got to do it the same
[2:13:44] way Joshua did it yes sir and and notice
[2:13:47] what in Joshua 1 says Moses my servant
[2:13:50] is dead
[2:13:51] you know what William Mary and
[2:13:53] brandom is
[2:13:56] dead but what he
[2:13:58] said is still
[2:14:01] living because what he said was what God
[2:14:05] Said and it was Vindicated by almighty
[2:14:08] God from City to City town to Town
[2:14:12] Country to Country
[2:14:14] Vindicated sir seven times around the
[2:14:16] world Vindicated so I'm going to keep
[2:14:19] quoting it just that's the way Joshua
[2:14:21] quoted
[2:14:23] Moses and you know what Joshua took the
[2:14:25] people into the promised land sir and
[2:14:27] the Holy Ghost has taken us into a
[2:14:29] Promised Land
[2:14:32] [Applause]
[2:14:34] Hallelujah I'm watching all the signs of
[2:14:36] the time I'm watching everything
[2:14:37] happening all around me but I'm watching
[2:14:39] these prophecies and they've been
[2:14:41] fulfilled one you know even uh they said
[2:14:44] in scripture when Jesus went to the
[2:14:45] Cross how many scriptures will fulfilled
[2:14:48] in a matter of hours yes sir hours
[2:14:51] things that you thought would man that
[2:14:52] was gon to take no no and within hours
[2:14:54] all these scriptures was
[2:14:55] fulfilled that's the same thing happen
[2:14:58] in our day you see all I thought the
[2:15:00] prophet said yeah he did and all this is
[2:15:02] just lined up just like that I'm I got
[2:15:05] my eyes on Christ nothing else nothing
[2:15:07] else but Christ I can't take no more of
[2:15:10] this world I I really can't I I'm tired
[2:15:13] I'm tired I I I do know this if one
[2:15:16] party get in if one party make it in the
[2:15:19] homosexual gender get to
[2:15:23] go it's it's enough already but I will
[2:15:26] tell you this
[2:15:28] though it's a
[2:15:31] scripture that refers to brother
[2:15:33] Brandon's
[2:15:35] coming St Luke
[2:15:38] 17 as it
[2:15:40] was in the days of
[2:15:42] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[2:15:46] son of man however you need to watch
[2:15:48] everything that happened in the days of
[2:15:50] lot yes homosexuality was off the off
[2:15:53] the charts it was so bad God had to
[2:15:56] destroy debris yes
[2:16:01] sir yes sir but but lot was out when
[2:16:06] that was when that happened amen church
[2:16:08] I'm closing I'm I'm leaving I'm promise
[2:16:10] you I'm
[2:16:13] leaving but you know what
[2:16:16] before before the place was destroyed
[2:16:22] God sent a
[2:16:24] prophet well
[2:16:26] actually I was let me put it this
[2:16:28] different way because he had a prophet
[2:16:29] on the earth you know you know who the
[2:16:31] prophet was at the time of
[2:16:33] lot
[2:16:35] Abraham but let so let me put it this
[2:16:38] way the word of the
[2:16:39] Lord came to the prophet yes
[2:16:44] sir the word of the Lord came to the
[2:16:46] prophet God said shall I hide from
[2:16:48] Abraham the things that I'm about to
[2:16:52] do and he began to tell him and and when
[2:16:54] Abraham realized that Sodom and gomorra
[2:16:56] is about to be be destroyed he said oh
[2:16:58] my goodness I got a nephew down there
[2:17:01] now Abraham never
[2:17:03] specifically prayed for
[2:17:06] lot but in a roundabout way he says per
[2:17:09] Adventure there
[2:17:11] be
[2:17:12] 50 would you
[2:17:15] destroy no Abraham I give you a promise
[2:17:17] I won't destroy if I can find 50
[2:17:19] righteous now don't get upset with me
[2:17:22] Lord what if it's lacking 10 and it's
[2:17:25] only 40 of them down there would you
[2:17:28] still destroy Abraham I give you another
[2:17:31] promise if it's 40 righteous I won't
[2:17:36] destroy uh I know I've asked you this
[2:17:38] before musicians y'all come on I got to
[2:17:41] leave what if it's only
[2:17:45] 30 uh Abraham I give you a third promise
[2:17:49] if it's lacking
[2:17:51] lacking another 10 I I won't destroy
[2:17:54] it
[2:17:56] h h
[2:17:59] Lord what what what what if it's uh what
[2:18:03] if it's uh what if what about 25 if it's
[2:18:06] 25 I won't destroy it
[2:18:09] 20 if it's 20 I won't
[2:18:15] destroy one more
[2:18:18] question I know you're tired of me
[2:18:20] praying
[2:18:21] but
[2:18:22] God and and and and see God knew what he
[2:18:25] was really trying to say when he got got
[2:18:28] numbers all the way down he's said what
[2:18:30] if it's 10 cuz he said now I know lot
[2:18:33] and his wife is two he got kids he got
[2:18:38] grandkids what if it's 10
[2:18:43] righteous if it's 10 I won't destroy all
[2:18:49] right God went down there and couldn't
[2:18:51] even find
[2:18:52] 10 but he sent the two investigating
[2:18:56] angels of judgment to go in before he
[2:18:59] came
[2:18:59] in come on y'all I I let me get out of
[2:19:03] here cuz I I feel I feel like preaching
[2:19:05] some more
[2:19:07] but when I come back to it we'll we'll
[2:19:09] get into all that but but all I'm saying
[2:19:11] is that when he when he got there there
[2:19:13] was a a the the word of the Lord came to
[2:19:16] the prophet and the prophet had an
[2:19:18] opportunity to pray to try to change
[2:19:20] some things
[2:19:21] but God knew no no I ain't going to even
[2:19:22] find 10 but what I will do you didn't
[2:19:24] even ask me for this Abraham but what I
[2:19:26] will do I'll go knock on lot's
[2:19:28] door and I'll tell him and what his
[2:19:31] family tell him and his family what's
[2:19:32] getting ready to happen and I'll invite
[2:19:34] them to come out not only invite him to
[2:19:36] come out I will force them
[2:19:41] out you got some loved
[2:19:44] ones in some really bad situations but
[2:19:48] God has a way of forcing them
[2:19:56] out God will force them out you just
[2:19:59] leave it in God's hands he'll create
[2:20:02] some situations he'll create some
[2:20:04] circumstances and he'll force them
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:11] out and if lot the make
[2:20:14] believer can get that type of attention
[2:20:17] from God that's why I can say
[2:20:21] I ain't looking for debris prophecy will
[2:20:24] be manifest but not while hopefully not
[2:20:26] while I'm here I'm not even looking to
[2:20:28] be here while while California go down
