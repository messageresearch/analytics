[32:51] see your grace and mercy your grace and
[33:00] mercy brought me through praise Lord you
[33:14] may have you cease we have one more
[33:15] special thing I just believe today in
[33:49] Sunday school we were talking about
[33:50] waiting on the Lord and just not moving
[33:55] ahead of him making sure that when you
[33:57] pray and you believe that you trust in
[34:00] him regardless of how much it seems like
[34:05] something needs to happen right now like
[34:07] you're at the verge of something
[34:08] happening and you feel like you need to
[34:10] move right now
[34:12] God's will is for us to wait and to
[34:16] trust in Him and to just believe in his
[34:18] will and believe that his timing is
[34:20] everything this song just talks about
[34:23] I've sung it many times but it's coming
[34:27] alive you know it talks about the three
[34:30] Hebrew boys about to be thrown into the
[34:33] fire it seemed like God needed to move
[34:36] right then but he waited until they were
[34:39] actually in the fire before he actually
[34:41] stepped on the scene the children of
[34:44] Israel you know Oh God delivered us you
[34:46] know and they end up at the Red Sea and
[34:49] they have no way to get over it no way
[34:51] to get around it God waited until they
[34:54] got right to that situation that seems
[34:56] hopeless before he opened up the way for
[34:58] them
[34:59] in the last verse it's just a personal
[35:01] story of how sometimes it seems like
[35:06] this situation for me is different so
[35:08] God's gonna have to act differently but
[35:11] God's never changed the way he moves he
[35:14] always makes sure that just in time he's
[35:17] there you know so regardless of what
[35:20] this situation looks like oh it looks
[35:22] bigger than last time it looks different
[35:23] than last time either way regardless of
[35:26] the situation God is able God is more
[35:29] than able so all he asks is that we
[35:32] simply believe and that we trust in him
[35:37] [Music]
[36:00] standing at the Red Sea with no hope of
[36:04] victory they didn't know what to do
[36:11] hoping that somehow someway their God
[36:14] would come and make a way they put their
[36:18] trust to you could their God get them
[36:24] off the shore they hadn't seen this
[36:27] before but they just
[36:30] [Music]
[36:34] then he just
[36:36] [Music]
[36:42] standing before the king with all the
[36:45] others worshiping they knew what they
[36:49] had to do hoping that somehow someway
[36:55] their God will come and save the day
[36:59] they put their trust in could their God
[37:04] save them from the sword they hadn't
[37:09] seen this before
[37:10] but they just
[37:12] [Music]
[37:16] they just
[37:18] [Music]
[37:23] so how could I disbelieve after all
[37:30] you've done for me how can I give up on
[37:38] you knowing you're able to see what to
[38:00] do
[38:05] [Music]
[38:13] can my god rescue me once more I haven't
[38:19] seen this before but I just really

[1:04:42] to protective people that you would keep
[1:04:44] the people during this tremendous time

[1:04:50] of some believers there in Russia
[1:04:53] there's something getting ready to
[1:04:54] happen tomorrow a decision that will be
[1:04:57] made where they'll be looking to ban the
[1:05:00] message of the hour from coming into the
[1:05:02] land of Russia they call it here is see
[1:05:05] and God we just pray that you would just
[1:05:08] move on the scene if if the law passes
[1:05:11] this that the believers will have to go
[1:05:13] on hiding and God we pray that you just
[1:05:16] make a way for the people that you would
[1:05:18] open up doors that they can't see touch
[1:05:21] those that are leadership of God's to

[1:06:15] amen we certainly appreciate it and it's
[1:06:19] so good just to be back in the house of
[1:06:21] God a man you know David made a
[1:06:24] statement he said I was glad when they
[1:06:29] said unto me let us go to the house of
[1:06:32] the Lord come in the church ought to be
[1:06:35] a joyous occasion hey man it ought to
[1:06:40] always be joyous to get to the house of
[1:06:42] God and a man if if somehow the devil
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:50] you know if something happens and he
[1:06:53] takes some of your happiness right he
[1:06:56] can't take your joy right he is
[1:06:59] sometimes he messes with your happiness
[1:07:01] you know sometimes something has to
[1:07:03] happen for you to get happy hey man but
[1:07:06] but joy is just always there no matter
[1:07:09] what your what's your face it no matter

[1:07:13] joy there's a song that says I still got
[1:07:16] joy after all not some not not some not

[1:07:24] been through I still got joy still got
[1:07:28] joy go over to God amen so we just we
[1:07:31] just thank the Lord for all things I'm a
[1:07:33] read one scripture a man and I will let
[1:07:37] you have your seats Amen thank y'all for
[1:07:39] standing in
[1:07:41] and everything that will let you be
[1:07:43] seated praise Lord up just John four and
[1:07:47] I want to read a man of Scripture that
[1:07:50] all of us amen are very familiar with it
[1:07:57] says God is a spirit and they that
[1:08:01] worship Him must and then there's no
[1:08:05] other way around it if you're gonna
[1:08:08] worship Him you but you must worship Him
[1:08:10] in spirit and in truth the Lord had a
[1:08:15] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:08:17] may be seated the Lord I want to just
[1:08:26] use for our topic today ritual rather
[1:08:34] than relationship in man ritual rather
[1:08:39] than relationship a man
[1:08:44] I draw my my thought a man from just
[1:08:50] observing a little something on my
[1:08:52] journey a man a few weeks ago as I was
[1:08:55] traveling to Israel something that I
[1:09:00] noticed I was and I had a I had a nice
[1:09:05] layover and I went from Miami to Detroit
[1:09:10] had an eight hour layover in Detroit
[1:09:12] from Detroit to New York and had a about
[1:09:15] an hour hour and a half way over there
[1:09:17] and then my flight left New York about
[1:09:20] 11 o'clock that night I started out
[1:09:21] eight o'clock that morning in Miami and
[1:09:23] and when I got to New York we got on
[1:09:26] playing this loaded with people and you
[1:09:30] know but when you get to New York
[1:09:32] sometimes you see things that you don't
[1:09:34] typically see you know too much around
[1:09:37] you know here but but when we got to New
[1:09:39] York we just a lot of people you know
[1:09:42] getting on the plane and I saw all the
[1:09:45] the the Jewish men and they were they
[1:09:49] were dressed in their garb
[1:09:50] and they had their their hats on and you
[1:09:53] know the ones that you know kind of
[1:09:55] where the long beers and things like
[1:09:56] that and I saw them I believe they're
[1:09:58] called of Orthodox I'm not really sure
[1:10:01] but they they hold true to some things
[1:10:04] and you know and and I come to find that
[1:10:06] there's divisions even amongst them you
[1:10:08] know there there's some of them where
[1:10:11] their hair a certain way or they might
[1:10:13] wear a certain kind of cap the Hat might
[1:10:18] look a little different one might be
[1:10:20] more round or one might be square and
[1:10:23] and they're actually from two different
[1:10:25] groups a man and and and the reason that
[1:10:29] they might wear one way or a square hat
[1:10:31] and one wear a hat the reason that
[1:10:35] separates them is simply because the
[1:10:38] rabbi said so a man and and people do
[1:10:44] things because the rabbi said so
[1:10:47] oftentimes people do things because the
[1:10:50] bishop said so
[1:10:52] a man or they do it because the pastor
[1:10:55] said so but it's not based on what the
[1:10:58] bishop says or what the rabbi says or
[1:11:01] what the pastor says but it's based on
[1:11:03] what God says and then we do things
[1:11:06] because God said so amen
[1:11:09] but you know as I as I looked at these
[1:11:11] men you know with a very long flight but
[1:11:14] you know I noticed that they're all
[1:11:15] dressed up in mandate you know they you
[1:11:17] know you know who they are based on how
[1:11:19] they dress a man and I think that's good
[1:11:22] right because Christians should be known
[1:11:25] for who they are by the way that they
[1:11:28] dress a man we ought to be known in the
[1:11:32] streets that we Christians praise the
[1:11:34] Lord we it shouldn't be a compromise
[1:11:37] when we leave Church hallelujah a man it
[1:11:41] should be a compromise because we have
[1:11:43] some other presents some where a man we
[1:11:45] Christians all the time a man just
[1:11:48] because of some event we say we don't
[1:11:50] stop becoming Christians actually at the
[1:11:53] event
[1:11:53] it's that greatest time to shine as
[1:11:55] Christians that's where people need to
[1:11:57] see something different inside of us
[1:11:59] come on somebody
[1:12:01] Hey
[1:12:03] hallelujah that that I mean you know a
[1:12:05] wedding is the best time to shine as a
[1:12:08] Christian because of you know typically
[1:12:10] I mean when people come to weddings they
[1:12:12] especially presented church that come
[1:12:15] there to a situation like that but they
[1:12:17] won't come to church on Sunday morning
[1:12:18] so you got a really great opportunity
[1:12:21] and then to let your light shine before
[1:12:23] men when you're doing something like
[1:12:25] that funeral is a great time to shine
[1:12:29] right there opportunity God give us what
[1:12:31] we can really shine it's not a time to
[1:12:33] shrink back but it's a time to step up
[1:12:36] right and be who God has called you to
[1:12:39] be out I'm not just gonna be a Christian
[1:12:41] on Sunday mornings
[1:12:43] praise the Lord somebody right so you
[1:12:46] know I was looking at these men and I
[1:12:48] was admiring them I was admiring them I
[1:12:51] said man look at these guys where they
[1:12:53] dressed and everybody know who they are
[1:12:55] right you ain't gotta ask no questions
[1:12:57] you know exactly where they come from
[1:12:59] where they're going you know you know
[1:13:00] everything about them just by the way
[1:13:02] that they dress I say boy that's
[1:13:04] something and you know and adds up you
[1:13:06] know I'm there on the on the plane and
[1:13:07] you know getting a little sleeping and I
[1:13:09] think it must have been about a 10 or 12
[1:13:11] hour type of trip but you had a certain
[1:13:14] time amen on the plane right these
[1:13:16] fellows got up man and see that the
[1:13:19] thing of it is they don't crush their
[1:13:20] hat don't put your stuff on their hat
[1:13:23] they put that hat in a certain place and
[1:13:25] the dunk not just up there wait to
[1:13:26] everybody get that stuff but then they
[1:13:28] kind of put their hats up there at the
[1:13:29] top don't mess up my hat right you know
[1:13:32] they were very meticulous about what
[1:13:34] they was doing right so so at a certain
[1:13:36] time I saw I mean I woke up and you know
[1:13:38] and I was sleeping I woke up and I see
[1:13:40] these fellows they they like that now
[1:13:41] they got they pressure on zone they got
[1:13:44] their hats on because when these men we
[1:13:45] pray they could not pray with their
[1:13:47] heads uncovered they had to make sure
[1:13:49] that they were covered right so they put
[1:13:50] these hats on they begin the prayin and
[1:13:52] write down the plane they got a book
[1:13:54] that they read and they just you know
[1:13:55] when they praying Oh God I'm gonna just
[1:13:59] talk a little bit but but when these
[1:14:01] brothers praying you know they praying
[1:14:04] right Amen they saying some words they
[1:14:07] uttering some things you know I know
[1:14:09] sometimes we you know as believers we
[1:14:12] don't want to pray out loud
[1:14:13] I know I know I know we a little shy to
[1:14:18] pray out loud you know you know when you
[1:14:20] find people praying out loud when they
[1:14:22] really going through you ain't got you
[1:14:27] ain't got you got no problem opening
[1:14:29] your mouth when you really go through
[1:14:31] right I mean when when you ain't got no
[1:14:33] troubles what you say you know you ain't
[1:14:43] going through nothing but you let
[1:14:44] somebody call you some bad news by one
[1:14:46] of the children I won't agree to do
[1:14:48] something like that
[1:14:49] lord help me help my family God ain't
[1:14:53] got no problem print out loud then why
[1:14:56] is it while you got to wait to you in
[1:14:57] desperation to call on God these fellas
[1:15:00] weren't waiting for desperation the
[1:15:02] plane was going down plane was going
[1:15:05] down it was it was a part I hate I'm
[1:15:07] happy to put it this way but it's a part
[1:15:08] of their ritual it was part of a ritual
[1:15:12] they get up at a certain time they don't
[1:15:15] care who looking they don't care who's
[1:15:17] around they don't care who hear them
[1:15:20] they don't care who see them they don't
[1:15:22] care anything about that it was time for
[1:15:25] them fellas to pray hallelujah amen when
[1:15:30] I would I what I liked about it is that
[1:15:32] you know they weren't embarrassed of who
[1:15:35] they were but I think sometimes as
[1:15:37] Christians we become embarrassed we
[1:15:39] don't need to be embarrassed
[1:15:41] God has done way too much for me to be
[1:15:47] quiet
[1:15:47] a man what he did was in public why
[1:15:51] can't I do something in public I can at
[1:15:54] least live right in public come on
[1:15:57] somebody but I watched him you don't let
[1:16:00] nothing fellows begin you know and every
[1:16:02] night I'm talking about they pray you
[1:16:03] know they praying you know Oh God cuz
[1:16:06] sometimes we don't know whether you
[1:16:07] praying or not hello somebody really
[1:16:11] stopped to pray fifoota no mom I don't
[1:16:16] want nobody to see it some people if you
[1:16:17] get into a restaurant they hold hands
[1:16:19] you know what they're doing all right if
[1:16:21] suddenly just kind of bow their head
[1:16:23] right but it means pray you know they're
[1:16:25] not no looking straight ahead
[1:16:30] well when did you pray when I was
[1:16:32] looking straight ahead I know no stop
[1:16:34] and pray and thank God stop and stop and
[1:16:40] pray don't be ashamed to pray Oh glory
[1:16:46] even you young people in school you
[1:16:49] ain't got to be ashamed to pray with
[1:16:50] your lunch you ought to thank God for
[1:16:53] that lunch that you just was given right
[1:16:57] but but don't be ashamed to pray I
[1:16:59] watched these men I was I was so
[1:17:01] impressed by you know but I'm not just
[1:17:03] maybe not be not worried about who's on
[1:17:05] the outside looking they knew who they
[1:17:07] were they knew who they were so now we
[1:17:10] don't you know it's time to pray about
[1:17:12] four or five and just get up and stand
[1:17:14] in the island and when they pray they
[1:17:16] they rock you know they're getting into
[1:17:23] it you know they just
[1:17:26] I'm not talk about sit down quiet no no

[1:21:27] you dress and we saying the same thing
[1:21:34] this this is a holy place watch the way
[1:21:37] you dress see I'm trying to get a mentor
[1:21:43] spot we got to understand we've not come
[1:21:45] to church under rituals it's not a
[1:21:49] ritual it's not just something we
[1:21:51] commonly do this has got to go beyond
[1:21:53] the ritual it has become a relationship
[1:21:57] see every time I open up my Bible I'm
[1:21:59] getting closer to him every time I come
[1:22:02] to church I'm getting closer to him
[1:22:03] right
[1:22:04] I mean it's relationship not just a
[1:22:06] ritual but you know as I went down there
[1:22:07] towards the wall and and they said the
[1:22:09] glory to Lord never depart say the
[1:22:10] present Lord is always here and I walked
[1:22:13] I said well if the president waters
[1:22:14] always here I want to get here next to
[1:22:15] the president Lord and you start walking
[1:22:18] and you trying to find yourself a little
[1:22:20] spot just to get in because people got
[1:22:21] the wall covered I think that's good
[1:22:24] wouldn't it be such a blessing that
[1:22:27] every seat was filled with people
[1:22:31] praying that you got to look for a spot
[1:22:35] to get into jest so that you can get
[1:22:38] some time in prayer right I mean you
[1:22:42] know I mean by here you know you got to
[1:22:44] try to find a spot and then and and the
[1:22:47] way that they get it you got some guys
[1:22:48] sitting on a bench right there they
[1:22:50] don't plan on leaving
[1:22:55] see yeah we coming we got we got set you
[1:23:01] got an alarm clock for your plan as to
[1:23:03] win your fare don't stop Lord I ain't
[1:23:09] got but a few minutes
[1:23:13] you know you talking to you you ain't
[1:23:16] got but a few minutes as we were there I
[1:23:21] just do not started I walk night I went
[1:23:23] down to one little area see I can't get
[1:23:25] in there see I'm going over here I can't
[1:23:27] get in there and you you know what you
[1:23:28] don't want to stand back man I'm at the
[1:23:31] western wall and you and we told us take
[1:23:35] a request and put it inside the wall and
[1:23:37] pray over it and just stick it in the
[1:23:39] crevice of the wall so I carried the
[1:23:42] burdens of the church and stuck it in
[1:23:44] the crevice of the wall and I now reach
[1:23:47] way up so people can get up there and I
[1:23:49] reached I stood on my tippy-toes not
[1:23:51] stuck it and I just lifted my hands and
[1:23:58] I just began to just praying and man the
[1:24:02] presence of God that was in that place
[1:24:06] for something so special and I said lord
[1:24:10] I see why they say the presence of God
[1:24:12] never leave and and and it was it was it
[1:24:15] was it was it was it was a very unique
[1:24:17] you know thing and Here I am the same
[1:24:20] guys that I see on the plane that's
[1:24:21] praying now I'm there in the midst of
[1:24:23] some of these guys and I'm praying at
[1:24:25] this western wall it's a man that says
[1:24:27] this is beautiful but a title's ritual
[1:24:35] rather than relationship because I saw
[1:24:41] something else with these these men that
[1:24:44] that that that that that were praying on
[1:24:47] the plane I saw that they dressed apart
[1:24:52] they look the part
[1:24:54] they they they created atmospheres you
[1:24:59] know they did all these things but but
[1:25:01] but but when we were getting off the
[1:25:02] plane and and and and you know how on
[1:25:05] the plane before you get on
[1:25:07] you have to check in your duty-free if
[1:25:09] you have some if you already travel I'll
[1:25:13] tell you what duty-free year's duty-free
[1:25:17] typically typically is liquor right it's
[1:25:21] liquor or it might be cigarettes or
[1:25:23] something like that that you carry in
[1:25:24] you know and and so I'm looking at these
[1:25:27] men and what they hatch so with all of
[1:25:29] this and I'm seeing carrying a carton
[1:25:31] cigarettes and carrying liquor now I
[1:25:35] don't know if they're gonna use it if
[1:25:36] they don't sell it well what are they
[1:25:37] doing whatever they're doing it shows a
[1:25:39] very bad testimony and this is why I
[1:25:43] begin to see doubt now now see what God
[1:25:45] is calling for is relationship not
[1:25:47] ritual and ritual it just becomes
[1:25:50] routine but nothing ever really happens
[1:25:52] in your heart if you're gonna come to
[1:25:55] prayer meeting and not allow God to do
[1:25:57] something inside your heart then you're
[1:25:58] wasting your time if you're gonna come
[1:26:01] to church and not allow God to do
[1:26:03] something inside your heart you are
[1:26:05] wasting your time if you say I believe
[1:26:07] the message but the message and change
[1:26:09] your heart you are wasting your time God
[1:26:13] God don't want just reach the wall it's
[1:26:18] not what he's looking for
[1:26:19] so yeah you know I watched this one
[1:26:22] brother you know and I you know when you
[1:26:26] get there for the first time it's kind
[1:26:28] of hard to come out that presence when I
[1:26:30] watch this one brother that was with us
[1:26:31] and man he got there holding that wall
[1:26:33] and he was just praying and we ought to
[1:26:36] stop him but he's still praying and he
[1:26:38] stopped for a little bit and he go back
[1:26:39] to praying again and he stopping and go
[1:26:40] back to praying again and you know and
[1:26:42] finally one the brother say we gotta go
[1:26:45] you're gonna have to go get him and I
[1:26:46] have to walk back down cover that head
[1:26:48] walk back down on inside of there find
[1:26:51] the brothers down there on the west wall
[1:26:53] I just have to touch them a little bit
[1:26:54] cuz see you don't want to be interrupted
[1:26:56] when you're praying right and I just
[1:26:58] don't just touch a little bit but that
[1:26:59] but but but what I went out without what
[1:27:01] I gather from that is that I wish that
[1:27:04] we can get so locked in with God that
[1:27:09] somebody have to come touch you
[1:27:13] alright I might have to come get you out
[1:27:15] of here all right I mean cuz you don't
[1:27:17] got so locked in with God that I ain't
[1:27:19] going no
[1:27:20] you you find yourself like John Ryan you
[1:27:22] gonna file a found a pile of dead bones
[1:27:25] if you don't do something funny see I
[1:27:28] mean when we got true relationship
[1:27:30] that's the way we approach God it's not
[1:27:32] it's not just ritual oh my god it's Oh
[1:27:38] God
[1:27:39] you know I you know this this form of
[1:27:42] worship that we got for some of us it's
[1:27:46] Sunday morning only but some of us it's
[1:27:51] Sunday morning only worship that that's
[1:27:55] all we got for God sund'ys I took
[1:28:00] suddenly off Lord so I could come
[1:28:01] worship you like you did God a fever and
[1:28:08] I got I got I got Sunday morning I do
[1:28:11] got more time but I'm only gonna do this
[1:28:14] on Sunday morning and what up what I'm
[1:28:16] here to tell you this morning even
[1:28:19] though I was impressed by all their men
[1:28:21] was talking those first time I saw it
[1:28:23] I don't think God wants can I say some
[1:28:28] oh all right I mean sometimes I might be
[1:28:32] impressed by the church being full on
[1:28:33] Sunday but maybe God not you know why
[1:28:38] and one of the reasons why God not
[1:28:40] impressed it's our approach it's the way
[1:28:45] we come in the church it's the way we're
[1:28:49] doing things
[1:28:49] I mean this thing has become so practice
[1:28:53] you know exactly what time to leave home
[1:28:57] right you know what what if you go get
[1:29:00] caught by this lighter that like you got
[1:29:01] this thing time okay and I want to get
[1:29:03] there just about now and Oh like you
[1:29:10] don't did something right I mean look we
[1:29:14] have we have to break rich the wall
[1:29:17] you're coming to church is not because
[1:29:20] mom and them used to do this then of
[1:29:22] them did this something that we don't
[1:29:24] done all our life we just go to church
[1:29:25] that's what we do also it's got to go
[1:29:28] beyond dance
[1:29:30] it's got to really become Laura I just I
[1:29:33] just love being in your presence you see
[1:29:39] they're not so oftentimes we're not
[1:29:40] coming in to add nothing to the service
[1:29:42] we're just coming to take everything
[1:29:44] from it that's why we don't get here
[1:29:47] early to pre you know the Prophet talked
[1:29:51] about being in the church 30 minutes
[1:29:52] early to pray yeah it is for you to
[1:29:54] create an atmosphere and then you're
[1:29:57] gonna say in brother solomon then say
[1:29:59] your favorite song you got man you ain't
[1:30:03] got none because if you had one you
[1:30:05] would've been singing it all week long
[1:30:06] and you too coming here to help create
[1:30:08] an atmosphere right here amen you come
[1:30:11] on our approach has got to be different
[1:30:14] if you know you're going to church on
[1:30:17] Sunday morning you can't be out all
[1:30:19] types of night on Saturday night your
[1:30:22] your mind is not being prepared your
[1:30:25] spirit is not getting ready for what's
[1:30:28] getting ready to happen yeah I mean so
[1:30:32] you have to change your approach you got
[1:30:34] I mean you really you really gotta look
[1:30:36] at how you how you coming into the
[1:30:38] presence of the Lord and sometime the
[1:30:41] reason we don't get nothing cuz we ain't
[1:30:44] gave nothing let's look at a scripture
[1:30:53] let's look at a scripture turn with me
[1:30:55] to Luke 18
[1:31:01] I was I was impressed but I don't think
[1:31:04] God was it was it had become ritualistic
[1:31:07] but it was rock and they looked good
[1:31:09] while I was pending at the western wall
[1:31:11] and and you know I'm looking at these
[1:31:13] fellows some gap I mean they get they
[1:31:15] got what they call phylacteries the
[1:31:18] other family of y'all Bible but they
[1:31:20] have these phylacteries that they just
[1:31:22] tie around they they are and in their
[1:31:24] tie around and then they have some
[1:31:26] things they have that they're holding in
[1:31:27] their hand
[1:31:28] it's like scriptures and things like
[1:31:29] that they hold a hand and then sometimes
[1:31:30] if I just put across their head and they
[1:31:32] just stand there they just sitting there
[1:31:33] just from the phylacteries just praying
[1:31:35] their sleeves rolled up and they just
[1:31:37] got this stuff I mean they they look
[1:31:39] spiritual but I saw one rocking like
[1:31:42] this I mean first you know first he
[1:31:45] started out you know like that then when
[1:31:49] he really got into it you saw him going
[1:31:53] he hadn't he don't you know he didn't
[1:31:55] got herself right but as they're doing
[1:31:57] that I see another one just talking to
[1:31:59] him while he's praying and he just
[1:32:02] talking and giggling and laughing and
[1:32:04] everything I say Lawrence now wait a
[1:32:05] minute
[1:32:05] this thing this thing right just to
[1:32:08] Westar law I realized it had become a
[1:32:11] ritual but but but when my brother went
[1:32:17] down there he won the ritual for him he
[1:32:19] had a relationship and he was a lock
[1:32:21] then we had to go come on brother we got
[1:32:22] to bring you out of here time to go if
[1:32:24] he could have stayed right there he
[1:32:26] would be right there right now all glory
[1:32:29] scene and I wish that our approach to
[1:32:32] God would be the Lord Oh hallelujah I
[1:32:36] wish I wish that I approach to God would
[1:32:39] be that you know Lord I'm going to
[1:32:40] church and I ain't got nothing else on
[1:32:42] my schedule today I ain't got nothing
[1:32:48] else on my schedule because you know
[1:32:50] sometimes we come in and especially last
[1:32:52] weekend brother Reggie might appreciate
[1:32:54] a couple hours but he did a wonderful
[1:32:55] job and by the way brother brother Jerry
[1:32:59] did a wonderful job too Friday night I
[1:33:02] certainly appreciate brother Jerry did
[1:33:05] an awesome job but but but brother go go
[1:33:09] for about two hours and
[1:33:12] I would be late why did you plan that
[1:33:16] on Sunday why did you do that a Sunday
[1:33:21] used to be the Lord's Day it used to be
[1:33:26] that way why are you planning the work
[1:33:28] on Sunday now I'm not talking about if
[1:33:31] you're ox falling a ditch that you can't
[1:33:34] get to get it out the ditch but I'll
[1:33:36] talk about your plan I'm talking about
[1:33:39] your plan that I have yes you did some
[1:33:42] other time you could have got that done
[1:33:43] honor God
[1:33:47] army of every week every day honor God
[1:33:51] don't make it a ritual make this about a
[1:33:55] relationship
[1:33:58] do you even even in a husband and wife
[1:34:01] relationship you know it can't just be
[1:34:03] ritualistic if it become that way then
[1:34:06] you know nobody appreciate nothing if
[1:34:09] every day he walk in you know doing it I
[1:34:12] mean you know he'd never do nothing
[1:34:14] different nothing but just well how do I
[1:34:16] know it's because it's just a ritual for
[1:34:18] you how do I know your heart is in this
[1:34:21] it you've got to do something do
[1:34:24] something just stop doing the same thing
[1:34:26] you do something not not just not just
[1:34:28] here Church when you leave church do
[1:34:31] something different brother branham say
[1:34:34] worship I read the quote on Wednesday I
[1:34:36] can't be today you say worship is not
[1:34:38] just when we come and sing songs in
[1:34:40] church
[1:34:40] he said but when you leave church and
[1:34:43] you see something out of your job doing
[1:34:44] something wrong the sense I'm gonna say
[1:34:46] something to them he said then you
[1:34:49] worshiping God encourage somebody
[1:34:53] witness to somebody you know when you
[1:34:57] get to heaven if there's somebody to
[1:34:58] witness to you had an impact of their
[1:35:01] making it brother branham's there to be
[1:35:02] a halo hanging over their head and
[1:35:04] you'll see that halo hanging realizing
[1:35:06] that you you had something to do with
[1:35:08] them get in there when I said we got we
[1:35:10] to Revelator I'm just be honest we to
[1:35:14] Revelator you know you know what I
[1:35:16] revelation is if they go they see they
[1:35:19] see they're gonna come things you know
[1:35:22] if you would just open up your mouth and
[1:35:25] let God you
[1:35:26] you maybe you can help somebody Amen
[1:35:31] right but we just to ritualistic I'm
[1:35:37] looking at them but I'm also looking at
[1:35:39] us we went with two ritualistic God
[1:35:44] don't want ritual worship
[1:35:46] if you don't worship Him you gotta
[1:35:49] worship Him in in two ways in spirit and
[1:35:51] in truth that's what God wants let's
[1:35:56] look at this it's a condition of the
[1:35:58] heart you know we've been working with
[1:36:01] this in Sunday school ah I won't read
[1:36:03] the whole thing I started with verse 1
[1:36:06] through 8 y'all can go back and read
[1:36:07] that those y'all that do not attend
[1:36:09] Sunday school hey man I might as well
[1:36:15] just say it why not why what else you
[1:36:19] doing on Sunday morning what you doing
[1:36:21] what time you go to work open up your
[1:36:26] mouth and talk to me what time some of
[1:36:28] y'all go to work just highlight what

[1:36:50] Lord and we got service cool at 9:30
[1:36:53] you can't come but you can show get to
[1:36:56] that job four hours earlier than Sunday
[1:37:02] school you can get there and be smiling
[1:37:05] when you get there I heard people say
[1:37:09] they want to come to Center school
[1:37:10] because they want to do no homework this
[1:37:18] ritual worship that we got going on I'm
[1:37:21] just trying to point it out that y'all
[1:37:22] you know in fact things become so
[1:37:24] ritualistic that we lose the heart I'm
[1:37:28] talking about I'm talking real good
[1:37:29] right when we've been doing pinnacle
[1:37:32] pawns for years and when we first
[1:37:34] started boy everybody's going so
[1:37:36] inspired and singing and doing
[1:37:38] you'd be surprised that when I go
[1:37:40] through they have to give a song ritual
[1:37:46] it's not from the heart and when we're
[1:37:49] doing things and it's not from the heart
[1:37:51] it's not being accepted I'm gonna just
[1:37:54] be honest with you I mean we will
[1:37:57] approach it just like these these these
[1:37:59] Jews we had we get we look the part we
[1:38:02] dress right we're doing all this but man
[1:38:04] our heart is messed up I can tell
[1:38:07] because out of the abundance of the
[1:38:10] heart the mouth speaketh and I don't let
[1:38:11] that the actions that come from your
[1:38:14] outside reflects what's on the inside
[1:38:17] let's look at this man you know Luke 18
[1:38:22] when you go back and read it there was
[1:38:24] at first the first eight verses is
[1:38:26] talked about a judge that had a really
[1:38:28] bad heart towards God but because he had
[1:38:30] a woman that just kept pestering him
[1:38:33] pestering him he's even though I own
[1:38:35] regard God you know I'm gonna just give
[1:38:37] it to her because I'm tired of what she
[1:38:38] said his heart changed because of her
[1:38:40] actions his heart changed because of her
[1:38:44] actions you know if you want to see
[1:38:46] people in your family's heart change
[1:38:48] maybe your actions need to change that
[1:38:52] right oh I know I'm talking good I know
[1:38:56] that and you know I'm telling I just you
[1:38:59] know when you when you're going you see
[1:39:00] things just start observes they Lord
[1:39:02] look at this we approach the same the
[1:39:03] same way
[1:39:04] lord have mercy it's is it really from
[1:39:07] the heart y'all just extra stuff a
[1:39:11] question there was a time that you were
[1:39:12] really happy about your salvation but I
[1:39:15] want to ask have you lost that fervor
[1:39:17] have you lost that zeal if so what do
[1:39:21] you need to do to get it back you want
[1:39:25] the favorite sermon reach or something I
[1:39:26] mean that don't work that way you got to
[1:39:30] put some time in and when you put in
[1:39:32] time and it's not like brother Troy yet
[1:39:35] when you study in the Word of God you're
[1:39:37] not studying for head knowledge its life
[1:39:41] to you his word is life right I mean and
[1:39:46] when you spend time with God that that's
[1:39:47] best
[1:39:48] Oh God I'm trying to get here I remember
[1:39:51] you know we go to church at some time
[1:39:53] and I pass it accident how many here
[1:39:54] read a book this week and stay down how
[1:39:59] many how many how many listen to the
[1:40:01] prophets tape this week all right
[1:40:03] so what we do is go put on a tape so if
[1:40:08] he acts that question the king now you
[1:40:11] see not by me approaching it that way
[1:40:14] and get nothing I ain't getting because
[1:40:17] I'm not coming to him with relationship
[1:40:20] I'm developing a ritual so I don't have
[1:40:23] to be asked that question we don't want
[1:40:29] to approach God that way we got to
[1:40:30] change what we doing look at these look
[1:40:33] at this here and Luke 8 verse 9 and it
[1:40:37] says any spake this parable unto certain
[1:40:40] which trusted in themselves that they
[1:40:42] were righteous and despised others they
[1:40:45] trusted you we trust in ourselves that's
[1:40:50] what we do we trust in ourselves and you
[1:40:52] know you don't you don't realize ain't
[1:40:54] none but grease that got you where you
[1:40:56] are and don't you ever forget that
[1:40:58] grease I mean we just
[1:41:00] oh we just think me somebody yeah and
[1:41:04] i'ma tell you this you are somebody and
[1:41:06] you're not somebody it's all as long the
[1:41:10] way that you present yourself all right
[1:41:12] he spake this parable to certain which
[1:41:14] trusted in themselves that they were
[1:41:16] righteous and despised others look at
[1:41:20] this two men went up into the temple to
[1:41:24] pray
[1:41:25] see it's all about the approach look the
[1:41:28] one a Pharisee and the other a publican
[1:41:32] these two men going to the same church
[1:41:35] to pray two men going to the western
[1:41:37] wall to pray right I mean one
[1:41:40] approaching it this way one approach
[1:41:41] that we look at and say the Pharisee
[1:41:43] stood and prayed now they've both
[1:41:44] praying but look at this man's prayer
[1:41:46] the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[1:41:49] himself god I thank thee and he sounds
[1:41:53] so holy so righteous God I think thee
[1:41:57] what you're thinking of that I am NOT
[1:42:01] as other men are extortioners unjust
[1:42:05] adulterers or even as this publican I
[1:42:12] mean he saw me now why he going to free
[1:42:15] what he praying for I mean lord I'm glad
[1:42:19] I'm not like him he don't even know the
[1:42:20] man but look at look at him say he say I
[1:42:23] fast twice in the week looking at me
[1:42:27] telling god what did I give time of all
[1:42:32] that I possess not think someone's just
[1:42:33] so happy that we can pay times we feel
[1:42:37] like that's well Lord you blessed me
[1:42:39] with this right here but just pay
[1:42:40] sometimes patting satisfying guard no
[1:42:44] you know what you know what times does
[1:42:45] it blesses you it don't bless God do you
[1:42:49] understand that ties do not bless God
[1:42:51] times bless you
[1:42:53] a man tithe actually is what keeps the
[1:42:58] devil at your house you understand time
[1:43:01] went because he say say when you pair
[1:43:03] say I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:43:05] sake ties is what puts the promise
[1:43:08] around you it's not about it's not about
[1:43:13] being a blessing of God God got
[1:43:15] everything he owns at all so don't think
[1:43:17] you doing something God God blessed you
[1:43:19] with a last job you paid something great
[1:43:20] great great but they ain't all got
[1:43:22] looking for this what this man said I
[1:43:25] paid my tires I fast twice a week I paid
[1:43:27] my times with everything I possessed but
[1:43:29] look at this verse 13 saying the public
[1:43:30] and standing afar off would not lift up
[1:43:34] so much as his eyes unto heaven but
[1:43:37] smote upon his breast saying God be
[1:43:38] merciful to me a sinner
[1:43:41] this man was ready to enter into
[1:43:43] relationship it wasn't just a ritual for
[1:43:46] him it was relationship he says he said
[1:43:47] I tell you this man Jesus says this I
[1:43:50] tell you this man went down to his house
[1:43:52] justified rather rather than the other
[1:43:56] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[1:44:00] be abased and he that humbleth himself
[1:44:01] shall be exalted Jesus was looking at
[1:44:05] the condition of this man's heart well
[1:44:07] both of them going to pray but their
[1:44:09] hearts are different the way that
[1:44:10] they're approaching God well we're
[1:44:11] coming here what is our hearts
[1:44:13] what is it like right I mean I I want to
[1:44:17] just read a couple of things here and
[1:44:19] then we'll go on as I looked at these
[1:44:22] men it really it drew attention to just
[1:44:25] my heart my kitchen condition of my
[1:44:27] heart Lord how am i approaching you is
[1:44:29] it just a ritual is it just a ritual do
[1:44:31] we just do that that's what we do on
[1:44:33] Sunday right
[1:44:34] and after we leave here we go we eat
[1:44:36] that's what we do all the time it's just
[1:44:38] a ritual it's not a real relationship
[1:44:41] I'll tell you when we when we really get
[1:44:43] into a relationship it's something that
[1:44:46] you long for it's something that that's
[1:44:48] why I said earlier when David said I was
[1:44:50] glad when they sent him to me it's
[1:44:52] something that he longed for if you're
[1:44:55] in a spot where you're not longing to
[1:44:56] get the church something wrong with you
[1:44:59] you know brother branham say we are you
[1:45:01] know we ought to be in a situation where
[1:45:03] we can't wait for the church doors to
[1:45:05] open but now we got plans on church
[1:45:09] night it's the truth
[1:45:14] we put plans on church night knowing has
[1:45:17] come well God understands he understand
[1:45:22] you need to repent he gotta hing down
[1:45:26] across for you to be talked about he
[1:45:28] understands you got to give got motive
[1:45:31] that all right let's let's go on a
[1:45:36] little further I've know y'all all right
[1:45:38] I know y'all listening any time to get
[1:45:41] quiet people listening praise God I want
[1:45:44] this to go deep because I ain't going
[1:45:45] through the motions why I sit here
[1:45:47] underneath all this word you know people
[1:45:50] can sit here and still go to hell come
[1:45:53] to church every week coming to church
[1:45:56] every week and miss heaven miss the
[1:46:00] rapture ain't worth it it ain't worth it
[1:46:02] y'all alright let me go on
[1:46:04] amen don't worry you know some of y'all
[1:46:07] I was thinking God that many of stuff
[1:46:09] mean how they just enjoyed that sermon
[1:46:10] or no fear this is a good one here too
[1:46:15] and I thank God for it
[1:46:17] Amen all right let me don't worry I got
[1:46:19] more for y'all I'm just telling y'all
[1:46:21] the start of the trip
[1:46:23] I got mo for you keep coming back I got
[1:46:28] I got some mo for you yeah hey man but
[1:46:31] we gotta get we got to get started right
[1:46:32] and then we can't even enter into it
[1:46:35] well tell me all about it well what is
[1:46:37] it gonna do for you a man I don't want
[1:46:42] y'all looking just dressing the part all
[1:46:45] of us we just dressed the part no no no
[1:46:46] we get this thing got to be real and
[1:46:48] spirit and truth worshiping in spirit
[1:46:50] and truth is not just because that's the
[1:46:52] name of this church that's not what
[1:46:54] Jesus talking about we can we can name
[1:46:57] it whatever name we want to name it but
[1:46:58] that's not what you're talking you talk
[1:46:59] about a condition of the heart glory to
[1:47:03] God
[1:47:03] see I mean the other thing about those
[1:47:05] fellas they they worship in the Spirit
[1:47:07] of God may be there but they don't have
[1:47:08] all the truth they reject in Christ as a
[1:47:11] messiah right they reject him truth so
[1:47:13] so they don't have all of that and I
[1:47:14] don't not only them that was just that
[1:47:16] was just with the the Jews on Friday I
[1:47:21] was leaving I'm preparing to leave and I
[1:47:24] was in I was walking along that western
[1:47:26] wall again there was a because they have
[1:47:29] a thing where above the on the top of
[1:47:32] the wall there's a Muslim temple up
[1:47:34] there and up there with that Muslim
[1:47:36] tipple no Jews can go in that area
[1:47:38] no Gentiles I mean it's got our
[1:47:42] Christians I should say you got to be a
[1:47:45] Muslim to be up there so so they have it
[1:47:48] where no Jews better be caught up there
[1:47:50] it might be some trouble so underneath
[1:47:53] the wall the Jews can walk underneath
[1:47:56] underground they can go they can go all
[1:47:58] up underneath there and there's a little
[1:48:00] spot that you get to underneath while
[1:48:01] you're walking along the wall and they
[1:48:03] say on the other side of that that spot
[1:48:05] there's where the holders of Holies
[1:48:06] would have been so many people there
[1:48:08] they're coming to get to that spot and
[1:48:10] they stop and they start rocking again
[1:48:11] they start praying right then that area
[1:48:13] cuz I mean yes if you had a like you
[1:48:16] know a serious condition you went to
[1:48:18] that spot and that's where you got your
[1:48:20] prayer through because they felt it was
[1:48:21] gonna get it through to God that's what
[1:48:23] that's the way people approached it when
[1:48:25] we come out from underneath that walking
[1:48:27] underneath the ground we come out and we
[1:48:28] come out on the other side and this is
[1:48:30] where the Muslims live right but you can
[1:48:34] come on down
[1:48:35] but as we were coming down the hill as
[1:48:37] of Friday City shut down we're coming
[1:48:40] down the hill and lord have mercy coming
[1:48:43] up the hill you should have saw the
[1:48:45] people um it was service started at
[1:48:50] twelve o'clock for them I was coming out
[1:48:53] at eleven thousands of people coming to
[1:48:56] church at eleven Muslims a hour before
[1:49:02] service Muslims y'all hearing me
[1:49:06] Muslims were coming to church a hour
[1:49:09] before service y'all Christians and you
[1:49:13] come ten minutes fifteen minutes thirty
[1:49:18] minutes hour after the service has
[1:49:21] started and Jesus died for your sins
[1:49:33] that's how you approach it but I'm
[1:49:39] telling people that don't even know
[1:49:40] Jesus hour before I'm I seen men on
[1:49:43] canes walking up the hill little kids in
[1:49:49] everybody knew it wasn't no complaining
[1:49:51] what I don't want to go to church
[1:49:54] everybody knew it they're supposed to be
[1:49:56] doing and they was doing it with
[1:49:57] everything they had but see even that
[1:49:59] was rich long even that was ritual but
[1:50:03] when we come to relationship church
[1:50:04] these things will they'll just become
[1:50:07] part of our of who we are and we do it
[1:50:10] out of love
[1:50:11] alright let me I was going somewhere I
[1:50:13] was gonna read something the Prophet
[1:50:16] said worship is to express yourself to
[1:50:19] him that's what worship is all about
[1:50:20] worship goes beyond our intellect our
[1:50:23] knowledge of God it's a true condition
[1:50:25] of the heart worshiping in spirit and
[1:50:29] truth goes beyond the name of our church
[1:50:30] a man it must become reality and our
[1:50:34] life now let me say something let me say
[1:50:36] this ritualistic worship will sit home
[1:50:40] and string when one is capable of rising
[1:50:46] and going to church
[1:50:49] but when it's become ritualistic we
[1:50:51] don't have no problem
[1:50:52] Oh Lord you know people just I'll just
[1:50:56] reading the service you couldn't do that
[1:50:59] in Jesus day you had to be there are you
[1:51:04] gonna miss everything
[1:51:06] but now we just so it's so common right
[1:51:09] we don't let Church become so so calming
[1:51:12] it oh yeah I'll just go back and watch
[1:51:14] the video so that type of attitude make
[1:51:16] us want to take every video down but the
[1:51:20] reason we leave without that's because
[1:51:21] there's some people that cannot come to
[1:51:23] church I'm not I'm telling that there's
[1:51:26] some condition that doesn't allow them
[1:51:28] to get here so they want to watch but
[1:51:31] others they can get there but you know
[1:51:33] they choose not to I was reading a quote
[1:51:35] for the Branham said that uh we oughta
[1:51:38] we ought to just be so grateful for the
[1:51:39] Lord Jesus that he stands at the door
[1:51:41] and he knocks oh you just keep knocking
[1:51:42] trying to come in he said you know if I
[1:51:44] came to your house and I knocked on your
[1:51:46] door and I saw you peep out the window
[1:51:49] look at me and then decide not to let me
[1:51:55] in send me on my way he said I'll tell
[1:51:58] you what the prophets say he said if it
[1:51:59] was me it'd probably be the last time I
[1:52:02] came to your house he say if you came to
[1:52:05] my house and I did you the same way
[1:52:07] that'll probably be the last time you
[1:52:08] came to my house you say but not Jesus
[1:52:10] he's standing at me keep knocking but I
[1:52:13] seen people do that I'm actually seems
[1:52:15] to go to the house knocking come to see
[1:52:18] about him trying to figure out what's
[1:52:20] going on with him I see you I see the
[1:52:23] window shade moving back and forth and
[1:52:25] everything I I know you there
[1:52:29] nitin drove our Iowa in the tree God
[1:52:35] like that but I stream and when they
[1:52:39] stream they know they know what's going
[1:52:41] on in every church can tell you what's
[1:52:43] happening on that church it's gone why
[1:52:46] you know they're not gonna have service
[1:52:48] on that day because well how you know
[1:52:49] all these things
[1:52:50] streaming you're not even here and you
[1:52:52] know everything if you're gonna be that
[1:52:55] connected why not just come on and sit
[1:52:56] on the side well we forget description
[1:53:01] for sake not to Assembly excels together
[1:53:04] as you see the Day approaching anybody
[1:53:06] leave we living in last day
[1:53:07] well we supposed to be in church more
[1:53:09] now than we ever was all right I was I
[1:53:18] was reading something here okay
[1:53:19] ritualistic worship was sitting home and
[1:53:21] stream when one is capable of rising of
[1:53:23] rising and going to church Saints know
[1:53:26] everything happening in every church but
[1:53:27] do not attend anywhere it's become a
[1:53:32] ritual it's no longer relationship there
[1:53:35] used to be a time in a person's life you
[1:53:36] couldn't keep him out of church couldn't
[1:53:37] keep him I mean just just couldn't keep
[1:53:39] him and and and and and you know it's
[1:53:42] beyond the head knowledge can we read
[1:53:43] about this woman in John 4 because you
[1:53:46] know this lady had had knowledge I was
[1:53:49] just you know I was I was trying to go a
[1:53:52] different direction the day I had him I
[1:53:54] in my heart to go a different way in and
[1:53:56] I had talking to one brother and I was
[1:54:00] telling him about you know my experience
[1:54:01] on the plane or what I saw and as I was
[1:54:03] just explained to him on the phone he
[1:54:05] like brother you gotta preach that
[1:54:06] Sunday I'm like now I got something else
[1:54:07] on three you know I got something else
[1:54:09] he's no no you got a preset on Sunday
[1:54:10] okay all right I'll see and then I left
[1:54:13] that conversation I found this this man
[1:54:16] that you know that I know he was
[1:54:18] standing out here on the corner we
[1:54:20] walked over to Publix and got some fruit
[1:54:21] together and and when I was sitting down
[1:54:23] with him and talking he was telling me
[1:54:25] that he he had this little thought in
[1:54:27] his heart about the heart of worship I
[1:54:29] say okay go ahead and work with me tell
[1:54:31] me what you got and he said I think
[1:54:33] people are getting you know their their
[1:54:35] hearts are not right and when it comes
[1:54:37] to worship they don't they don't really
[1:54:38] they're not approaching the right way
[1:54:39] and he start talking a little bit I said
[1:54:41] okay okay okay work with that and then
[1:54:43] as they start talking I begin to think
[1:54:46] about you know this woman and and and
[1:54:48] and John four and then he say like the
[1:54:50] woman in John 4 I say oh okay so that's
[1:54:53] that's a confirmation I say you know
[1:54:55] I've been thinking about this little
[1:54:56] worship thing and say I'm gonna just
[1:54:57] stay right there I'm gonna stay right
[1:54:59] there with this because when I say it's
[1:55:01] not intellect if you would look at this
[1:55:03] woman's condition if you look at the
[1:55:06] conversation that she's having with gee
[1:55:08] what I want on what I want you to
[1:55:10] understand is that this lady could go
[1:55:11] toe-to-toe with Jesus y'all in here this
[1:55:16] lady was able to quote scripture this
[1:55:19] lady was able to lay down the quotes and
[1:55:21] and say we worship here and we do this
[1:55:23] and we do it this way and y'all have
[1:55:24] been saying it this way for a long time
[1:55:26] but we do it this way because it is our
[1:55:28] Father dis I mean she just she just go
[1:55:31] and talk but toe with Jesus you got
[1:55:36] people the same way today before they
[1:55:38] can tell you the quotes they can tell
[1:55:41] you the Bible verses but you ask them to
[1:55:43] living they can't do it but they know it
[1:55:48] I mean intellect this lady had this
[1:55:51] thing down pat I just you know let's
[1:55:56] look at her a little bit let's look at
[1:55:59] her verse 4 John 4:4 and he must needs
[1:56:04] go through Samaria then cometh he to a
[1:56:07] city of Samaria which is called Sychar
[1:56:09] near to the parcel ground that Jacob
[1:56:11] gave to son Joseph now Jacob's Well was
[1:56:14] there Jesus therefore being wearied with
[1:56:16] his journey set us on the well it was
[1:56:18] about the 6:00 hour there cometh a woman
[1:56:21] of Samaria to draw water jesus saith
[1:56:28] unto her give me to drink those
[1:56:30] disciples were going away into the city
[1:56:32] to buy meat then said the woman of
[1:56:34] Samaria to him how is it that thou being
[1:56:36] a Jew ask a drink of me when am a woman
[1:56:40] of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:56:42] with the Samaritans jesus answered and
[1:56:46] said unto her if thou knewest the gift
[1:56:47] of God and who it is that saith to thee
[1:56:51] give me to drink thou wouldest have
[1:56:53] asked of him and he would have given
[1:56:56] thee living water and and the woman said
[1:57:00] unto him Sir thou has nothing to draw
[1:57:05] she just you can just kind of maybe he
[1:57:07] kind of getting underneath her her skin
[1:57:09] now to talk about drawing something and
[1:57:12] the other thing about her she doesn't
[1:57:14] her doll to pick up knives
[1:57:17] she didn't hurt her mom she got a
[1:57:20] certain attitude because she'd been a
[1:57:22] cheater I had a rough life all right I
[1:57:24] mean she don't her dance I hit go
[1:57:25] another pick-up line if I knew who I was
[1:57:29] talking to I be asking for some that
[1:57:31] shrink and she can look down sir that
[1:57:38] has nothing to draw and even gotten in a
[1:57:39] draw with and the well is deep from
[1:57:43] whence then hast thou that living water
[1:57:45] art thou greater than our Father Jacob
[1:57:48] so see this she getting into some
[1:57:49] worship now she know he's she know he's
[1:57:52] he's Jewish right it actually I can't
[1:57:55] call Jesus Jewish because he won of
[1:57:57] Jewish blood he was the blood of God but
[1:57:59] she knows that he's of the Jews
[1:58:01] right so he said aren't that great and
[1:58:03] our Father Jacob which gave us the well
[1:58:05] and drank thereof himself and his
[1:58:07] children and his cattle she's going all
[1:58:08] the way back you know Jacobs day we get
[1:58:11] we got this well from Jacob so since
[1:58:13] jesus answered and said unto her
[1:58:14] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:58:16] thirst again I said but whosoever
[1:58:18] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[1:58:19] him shall never thirst oh my god said by
[1:58:23] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:58:25] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:58:27] everlasting life and it goes on to say
[1:58:30] the woman saith unto him Sir give me
[1:58:32] this water that I thirst not neither
[1:58:34] come hither to draw she goes on jesus
[1:58:38] said in her and see this before she can
[1:58:40] get the water he had to deal with
[1:58:41] something oh I like I like I like this I
[1:58:51] just I like you know when when he's
[1:58:54] dealing with the sin issue here now
[1:58:56] before we deal with this I wanted to
[1:58:58] tell you this lady from a intellectual
[1:59:01] purse and point she knew who she was
[1:59:04] intellectually but from a heart
[1:59:07] standpoint she was far from what God
[1:59:10] needed her to be and when Jesus began to
[1:59:13] deal with her Jesus he broke rock he'd
[1:59:16] get cut right to the chase
[1:59:18] no longer we gonna sit here and talk
[1:59:20] intellect right we not not talk Jewish
[1:59:22] that the way the Jewish people worship
[1:59:24] because they were in Jerusalem and where
[1:59:25] the Samaritans work it worship is in
[1:59:27] Samaria we not we're not going to talk
[1:59:28] about that we're gonna talk about you
[1:59:30] what what really God is looking for when
[1:59:33] we talk about worshiping in spirit and
[1:59:34] truth it's got to come from the heart oh
[1:59:37] my I cannot just be honest with you if
[1:59:42] you ain't gonna give God your heart it's
[1:59:48] not gonna be accepted i'ma say it again
[1:59:53] if you are not going to give God your
[1:59:55] heart it will not be accepted
[2:00:00] you know when I'm going I'm gonna go
[2:00:03] further in Scripture
[2:00:04] you know folk come to church with no
[2:00:05] sería motives you know that I mean
[2:00:10] sometimes you can get fokin Church now
[2:00:12] at some time foot will come they got
[2:00:14] they got one reason I know why I'm here
[2:00:16] in this church I don't know exactly why
[2:00:18] but God get a hold a heart and change
[2:00:19] that reason now I'm gonna tell you two
[2:00:22] things is they come with ulterior
[2:00:24] motives and the person that's inviting
[2:00:26] now is invite the with ulterior motives
[2:00:30] it ain't about the it ain't about no
[2:00:33] relationship with God it's that's
[2:00:34] hopefully I might as well see it and I'm
[2:00:43] so glad God can get in the mix of your
[2:00:45] hopefully and taste some things around
[2:00:48] but you know and God know you got
[2:00:51] ulterior motives
[2:00:52] someone's invite certain people I was
[2:00:56] witnessing really how come that's the
[2:01:00] only person we seen come to church with
[2:01:02] you I'm talking I get me on the ritual
[2:01:09] I'm telling going deep into relationship
[2:01:12] with God all right can we go further
[2:01:15] look at the lady she says the woman
[2:01:19] saith unto him Sir give me verse 15 give
[2:01:21] me this water that first not neither
[2:01:23] come hither to draw jesus said in her go
[2:01:26] call thy husband and come hither the
[2:01:29] woman answered and said I have no
[2:01:31] husband jesus said unto her thou has
[2:01:32] well said I have no husband thou has had
[2:01:36] five husbands and he whom thou now hast
[2:01:39] is not thy husband and that's and that
[2:01:42] says thou truly
[2:01:44] the one that said unto him sir I foresee
[2:01:45] that thou art a prophet again this lady
[2:01:47] was spiritual intellectual she actually
[2:01:49] she understood certain things right and
[2:01:51] and she can see this gift that was in
[2:01:54] Jesus life sir I perceive that just a
[2:01:57] little conversation and I perceive you a
[2:01:59] prophet something wrong something
[2:02:01] different about you I perceived out of
[2:02:03] profit and then she goes on to say our
[2:02:05] fathers worshiped in this mountain see I
[2:02:06] mean going toe to toe with Jesus our
[2:02:09] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[2:02:10] ye say that in Jerusalem is the place
[2:02:13] where men ought to worship jesus said
[2:02:16] unto her woman believe me the hour
[2:02:18] cometh and and I like this because I saw
[2:02:22] these men on the plane going to
[2:02:23] Jerusalem because that's that's where
[2:02:25] they thought that you're going to that
[2:02:27] Western Wall that's what I thought
[2:02:28] that's not where God is looking for us
[2:02:30] to go to get a man that to get through
[2:02:33] to us what God is looking for a
[2:02:34] condition of our heart then he can get
[2:02:37] through to us listen jesus said unto her
[2:02:40] woman believe me that the hour cometh
[2:02:42] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[2:02:44] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father
[2:02:49] ye worship you know not what we know
[2:02:52] what we worship for salvation is of the
[2:02:54] Jews but the hour cometh and now is when
[2:02:59] the true worshipers glory to God shall
[2:03:04] worship the father in spirit and in
[2:03:07] truth for the father seeketh such to
[2:03:09] worship Him if you're gonna worship and
[2:03:12] please give me a heart don't don't be
[2:03:15] ritualistic about it don't do that don't
[2:03:17] please don't
[2:03:19] it's not being accepted I don't know
[2:03:22] what other way to put it I you know I I
[2:03:25] wish that I could just a man just tell
[2:03:29] you that oh God just loves you in and he
[2:03:31] doesn't care he he just won't know it
[2:03:34] God cares you know God was not even God
[2:03:41] in the beginning till he created
[2:03:43] something to worship that God the word
[2:03:47] God it actually means object of worship
[2:03:51] and so when God created angels they
[2:03:54] worshiped him God had Adam and Eve in
[2:03:55] the garden they worship
[2:03:57] they did all that and until sin kind of
[2:03:59] came in then they stopped going to
[2:04:00] church is that the truth the reason they
[2:04:06] didn't come to church because sin was
[2:04:08] there and you know so I mean that that's
[2:04:10] what's the question that you have to
[2:04:12] actually become even in church well you
[2:04:14] all right yeah I'm good
[2:04:15] well why you ain't in church and when we
[2:04:19] get so comfortable we go years years I'm
[2:04:25] gonna tell you something you never meant
[2:04:27] for it to go this far you never meant
[2:04:31] for it to go this far but it has and
[2:04:35] somebody got to get in your face and
[2:04:38] tell you it's far enough you thought it
[2:04:45] just gonna be one week maybe two weeks
[2:04:46] and the devil don't put you off to two
[2:04:48] or three years and that don't even
[2:04:50] involve you I got another message that
[2:04:52] I'm gonna preach it's come I'm gonna tie
[2:04:53] it's gonna be called conviction cuz we
[2:04:58] ain't got it no more we don't lost
[2:05:02] conviction it used to bother us now it
[2:05:06] don't even God understand you know God
[2:05:11] knows I mean you know you keep taking
[2:05:18] that attitude you're gonna miss the
[2:05:20] rapture you're gonna miss the rapture
[2:05:22] I'm gonna tell you and we live in a
[2:05:24] rapture conditions right now hey man
[2:05:27] Church it's just become too much of a
[2:05:30] ritual I'm trying to get into some some
[2:05:32] things here but but I got a stopped
[2:05:34] church I looked at these men I look at
[2:05:37] and I was impressed and sometimes you
[2:05:40] think other people impressed by what
[2:05:41] you're doing God not God not I mean it
[2:05:45] goes beyond just paying tithes and
[2:05:47] offering God wants your heart see Samson
[2:05:52] gave God his strength but it didn't give
[2:05:54] God his heart God wants your heart and
[2:05:57] when God got your heart there's no
[2:06:00] ulterior motives
[2:06:01] well Lord if I serve you not do this to
[2:06:04] maybe know
[2:06:06] you ain't I said you don't serve God on
[2:06:08] them let's make a deal platform he's
[2:06:12] already made the deal seal the deal when
[2:06:16] he died at Calvary now he just walked
[2:06:19] somebody to give him that God wants
[2:06:21] undivided ticked he wants your heart
[2:06:22] please don't come just dressing the part
[2:06:24] don't do that go further and whatever
[2:06:27] you do for God give everything you've
[2:06:29] got do it with all your heart whatever
[2:06:34] you do for the Lord do it with all your
[2:06:36] heart amen God is a spirit day that
[2:06:38] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[2:06:43] and in truth
[2:06:45] there is no other way around it brother
[2:06:48] Branham said there's a way to worship a
[2:06:50] right way and a wrong way to worship
[2:06:52] said I'm not just trying to tell you
[2:06:54] which way you to worship but I'm telling
[2:06:56] you there is a way you have to approach
[2:06:57] God and if you don't come that provided
[2:06:59] way you certainly can't find God alright
[2:07:03] let me go a little further here the just
[2:07:10] talking about this woman he met the
[2:07:12] woman at the well and even though she
[2:07:13] thought she had the correct form of
[2:07:15] worship she realized that she was
[2:07:17] lacking something and quickly turned
[2:07:18] from her wicked ways to offer worship in
[2:07:20] spirit and in truth she had head
[2:07:23] knowledge she could hold her own in a
[2:07:26] conversation with Jesus she was well
[2:07:28] taught but she could not live what she
[2:07:31] was told
[2:07:32] it is it is more to it than just looking
[2:07:35] like a Christian we have to truly have
[2:07:38] Christ in our hearts daily pleasing him
[2:07:40] is what we should desire and and the
[2:07:43] other thing is Jesus was trying to get
[2:07:46] the woman at the well to realize that
[2:07:47] worship wasn't limited to a specific
[2:07:49] place like Mount Gerizim
[2:07:51] and Samaria or in Jerusalem worship was
[2:07:54] a condition of the heart and it could
[2:07:56] only be expressed after a true encounter
[2:07:59] with Jesus Christ
[2:08:00] and the other thing I like about this
[2:08:02] the Bible says through her testimony you
[2:08:05] know others begin to believe now now I
[2:08:07] think I got that that was verse 41 is
[2:08:11] that right yeah
[2:08:15] I said and many more believed because of
[2:08:21] his own word and said unto the woman now
[2:08:24] we believe not because of thy Singh but
[2:08:27] we have heard him ourselves and know
[2:08:29] that this is indeed the Christ the
[2:08:31] Saviour of the world now I was just
[2:08:32] thinking on that she they say not
[2:08:34] because of I sing I think the life that
[2:08:36] she was living was so shabby there were
[2:08:41] nobody no I don't care how much hit
[2:08:43] knowledge she had her life is so shabby
[2:08:45] they would not have believed brother
[2:08:47] Branham said that your life speaks so
[2:08:49] loud that we cannot hear your voice
[2:08:55] i'ma say it again your life is speaking
[2:08:59] so loud that we are not able to hear
[2:09:01] your voice and what we want to do is get
[2:09:03] your life align with your voice and the
[2:09:07] only way gonna do that you gotta have a
[2:09:08] change in the heart I'm not talking
[2:09:11] about you know it's got to happen in the
[2:09:13] heart cuz when it happened in the heart
[2:09:15] you know what ain't nobody gonna be able
[2:09:17] to keep you out of church
[2:09:18] ain't no no no no snow situation no snow
[2:09:21] snow circumstance gonna be able to keep
[2:09:23] you we got to we got to pick this thing
[2:09:25] up I'm just under I don't want to look
[2:09:28] like that I don't want to like the
[2:09:29] fellas I got dressed up got my hat got
[2:09:32] me this is I'm approaching but and all
[2:09:34] along in my heart I got something else
[2:09:36] going home all right let me uh this
[2:09:43] displace what I what I noticed the same
[2:09:45] place where the western wall is and
[2:09:47] they're doing all this you know praying
[2:09:49] in that same area was it's also where
[2:09:53] the temple is and a temple that they
[2:09:56] were telling say this is the same temple
[2:09:57] where Jesus beat people out of the
[2:10:00] temple because it became a ritual and
[2:10:03] when it became a ritual rather than men
[2:10:06] coming and offering their best sacrifice
[2:10:08] to God they began to now buy lamps they
[2:10:11] begin to buy you know offerings that
[2:10:12] they could they could give to the
[2:10:13] pre-staged they stopped raised to the
[2:10:15] own animals now they want to just buy
[2:10:17] it's become merchandise Jesus beat them
[2:10:19] folk out of that temple now imitate
[2:10:22] brother Rama say you know what that same
[2:10:24] loving Jesus sometimes you know he'll
[2:10:27] have to give you a message to kind of
[2:10:28] beat you in line
[2:10:30] that's the lovin Jesus yeah if they gave
[2:10:34] you something to get you back in line
[2:10:35] cuz we get an understand all right
[2:10:39] all right let me go on and I'll bring it
[2:10:44] to a close here those men after they
[2:10:47] after Jesus kind of beat them you know
[2:10:50] out of the temple
[2:10:52] you look even years later they still
[2:10:55] selling their not selling offerings and
[2:10:57] things of that nature but they're still
[2:10:58] selling right then Saint Mary it shows
[2:11:00] that it became a ritual so many of the
[2:11:04] people it became a ritual
[2:11:06] don't let this gospel that God's given
[2:11:09] us become ritual let it be relationship
[2:11:12] let it be relationship I was I was
[2:11:15] impressed by the brother a man that was
[2:11:19] when we got down there both him and his
[2:11:22] wife because I told you they separate
[2:11:24] the men from the women that brother got
[2:11:25] there to pray and we could not get him
[2:11:27] out of there he got locked in so he went
[2:11:30] that brother I had to touch up on the
[2:11:31] side like brother we got there we got
[2:11:33] there we got to keep going and he like
[2:11:36] man I really don't want to go and they
[2:11:37] went and got his wife and they come out
[2:11:39] there they just they just volunteers
[2:11:41] from this place because of the presence
[2:11:43] of the Lord and I thought about it I
[2:11:45] said I want to be like him when I'm
[2:11:47] going to church I wanted to be like a
[2:11:51] magnet and they all ever had two magnets
[2:11:55] that she was working with and you get it
[2:11:58] you get two magnets and maybe got one
[2:12:00] you know place somewhere but the other
[2:12:03] magnet you you you see how far you can
[2:12:07] pull away before it actually begins to
[2:12:09] draw your back right and sometimes the
[2:12:12] magnets just big enough and you start
[2:12:14] playing with them man that that Mack the
[2:12:16] strength of that little magnet will pull
[2:12:19] your body you know and you're just
[2:12:21] trying to keep it away you know you you
[2:12:23] trying to separate but but the strength
[2:12:25] of it just just it just locks in that's
[2:12:29] the way I want to be that I can't I
[2:12:31] can't separate myself from the presence
[2:12:33] of God I can't separate separate myself
[2:12:36] from the house of God I mean I want to
[2:12:39] be mad
[2:12:41] but let me tell you something in order
[2:12:42] to be magnetized you gotta have
[2:12:44] something on the inside of you to allow
[2:12:47] you to be magnetized that brother was so
[2:12:52] connected in prayer we had to go get him
[2:12:54] they were magnetized to the atmosphere
[2:12:56] we want to be magnetized to prayer
[2:12:59] service we want to be magnetized to
[2:13:01] church we want to be magnetized to the
[2:13:03] things of God they used to sing a song
[2:13:06] only what you do for Christ will last
[2:13:11] only what you do for him will be counted
[2:13:13] in the end only what you do for Christ
[2:13:17] will last
[2:13:18] and if you're gonna do it for Christ do
[2:13:21] it with all your heart because he's
[2:13:25] seeking people to worship them but they
[2:13:27] that worship Him must no rap with no way
[2:13:31] around it get all the up tear your
[2:13:33] motives out of the way and you're gonna
[2:13:35] have to do this in spirit and in truth
[2:13:37] spirit because you understand how God
[2:13:39] wants to be approached you know he's not
[2:13:42] three gods right you have the right you
[2:13:44] have the right revelation of it you know
[2:13:46] but I mean that's the truth part but
[2:13:48] also but also in spheres like my heart
[2:13:50] has got to be right which way am i
[2:13:53] approaching God is it just gonna be
[2:13:54] ritual you ain't hurt nobody but
[2:13:57] yourself but if you're gonna get real
[2:14:00] with God now's the time get real give
[2:14:04] him everything because that's what he's
[2:14:06] asking for I'm telling ya I I know God
[2:14:14] wasn't accept accepting what I was
[2:14:15] seeing
[2:14:16] and I know that uh if he went accepting
[2:14:19] that it went a little further I know
[2:14:20] you're not accepting some of the stuff
[2:14:21] that we're doing either let me read a
[2:14:23] quote here and I'm a close I stand at
[2:14:26] the door and not look at this
[2:14:34] some time ago a man was on his road to
[2:14:41] the seaside he was going over there for
[2:14:42] arrests he wanted to refresh himself
[2:14:44] because he thought he would like to hear
[2:14:48] the seagulls as they flew over another
[2:14:51] quote he was saying this man had never
[2:14:52] even been to the sea before so he heard
[2:14:54] about him he said man I want to go hear
[2:14:56] these seagulls I want to I want to hear
[2:14:58] the waves just kind of beat the shore I
[2:15:00] want to hear that I never I've read
[2:15:02] about it but I want to hear it I want to
[2:15:03] experience it myself this is what the
[2:15:05] man said he thought thought thought he
[2:15:07] would like to hear the seagulls as they
[2:15:09] flew over the water to skip down by the
[2:15:11] great white tip waves as they roared him
[2:15:13] bursting in the air and he wanted to
[2:15:15] smell the Sun where it said it would be
[2:15:18] such a rest to live by the seashore for
[2:15:20] a while I just want to rest I want to
[2:15:22] live by the seashore
[2:15:23] to see all the things the sea has to
[2:15:26] offer the blue sky as it reflects from
[2:15:28] the sky to the water how that the foam
[2:15:31] of the salt water will boil up in the
[2:15:32] great wave strike and roll and they said
[2:15:34] if I can stand and look at that and hear
[2:15:37] the scream of the goal and on this road
[2:15:39] down to the seashore he met a man coming
[2:15:41] and he was no salt and an old seller
[2:15:44] from the sea he said we're going down he
[2:15:45] said I go down to the seashore to enjoy
[2:15:48] the goodness of the sea and the old
[2:15:50] sunset I don't see nothing strange about
[2:15:52] it the waters are just waters the sky is
[2:15:56] just the sky the goal is just another
[2:16:00] bird you see he had seen seen it so much
[2:16:03] until it become common to him it wasn't
[2:16:08] thrilling to him and I'ma tell you
[2:16:12] church has become common to many of us
[2:16:15] it's no longer thrilling to us and
[2:16:20] actually what lost earth Rilke is used
[2:16:23] to add some thrill and what you used to
[2:16:26] do it add it three all but since we lost
[2:16:29] that the thrill is gone all right hey
[2:16:34] man and that's what's the matter with
[2:16:36] you people you've seen the goodness and
[2:16:38] the miracles and divine things of God
[2:16:40] moving and working until it becomes
[2:16:42] common to you you don't notice it no
[2:16:45] more and the meters I've noticed
[2:16:47] where the Lord on this discernment will
[2:16:49] speak right out in the audience just as
[2:16:50] he did when he walked in Galilee just as
[2:16:53] promised that he said he would do and
[2:16:55] people the first time they said oh did
[2:16:57] it ever
[2:16:57] oh that's that's got to be the Lord and
[2:16:59] the next time it's well become after and
[2:17:03] after a while well it's just it's just
[2:17:05] another thing it's common it's passed
[2:17:07] over you don't notice it your eyes of
[2:17:09] understanding your heart becomes close
[2:17:11] to it the thrill the blessedness of
[2:17:14] knowing the risen Lord Jesus standing
[2:17:16] our Michos send every sort of Heights
[2:17:18] for y'all anything this world could
[2:17:19] thrill it should do something to you it
[2:17:22] should shake your faith till you open up
[2:17:24] every door faith in every everything
[2:17:27] else they Lord Jesus take full
[2:17:29] possession of me now take me into your
[2:17:31] caring here come here come into my heart
[2:17:34] take my selfishness away take my
[2:17:37] misunderstandings away take my doubts
[2:17:40] away open my eyes Lord and let me see
[2:17:43] and take all of me and be my lord
[2:17:47] till the church does that we're walking
[2:17:50] and blindness Jesus is knocking at the
[2:17:55] door and we're leaving him outside don't
[2:18:02] let the devil make your relationship
[2:18:05] with Christ just common ritual let it be
[2:18:10] real if you've lost that thrill you need
[2:18:17] to go pick up Jesus with you where you
[2:18:18] found them I mean where you lost a man
[2:18:21] search back in your own life Lord I
[2:18:25] don't know I don't know why I lost it I
[2:18:27] don't know what happened but you need to
[2:18:28] search back and you need to go find
[2:18:30] Jesus where you left it's it's we're
[2:18:36] gonna get into some things I believe by
[2:18:38] the grace of God we'll get there but
[2:18:40] what use would it be to just share some
[2:18:43] of these things and it not do nothing
[2:18:45] for your heart I'm not here preaching to
[2:18:49] your head ain't no sense in me preaching
[2:18:52] to your head um I believe there's gonna
[2:18:54] be a rapture and I believe we're gonna
[2:18:56] be a part of it but I also believe that
[2:18:58] we got to get our hearts right with God
[2:19:01] we can't just keep the treating out any
[2:19:03] kind of way a man Church don't let it be
[2:19:09] ritual let it be relationship let's pray
[2:19:16] lord I know for a fact that you allowed
[2:19:22] me to see some of the things I saw
[2:19:25] because you wanted to challenge me as
[2:19:29] well as everyone else here
[2:19:33] god it's so easy as I just looked at
[2:19:37] those men and watching them here they
[2:19:41] are carrying I'm in there they're there
[2:19:44] the little Bibles and they're reading
[2:19:47] they're on the plane and they're they're
[2:19:49] worshiping and they're praying and
[2:19:51] they're doing all these things the Lord
[2:19:55] even after they did all of that then I
[2:19:58] noticed the same man were carrying
[2:20:01] packages that they shouldn't have been
[2:20:04] carrying what about us Lord come to
[2:20:09] church we we played a we played a part
[2:20:13] but in our hearts God there is
[2:20:16] wickedness we still have hatred
[2:20:19] bitterness and so much more that's there
[2:20:23] that we really cannot get beyond the
[2:20:26] ritual you want to take us deeper you
[2:20:30] want to take us further than where we
[2:20:32] are right now and God my prayer is that
[2:20:35] that each one of us would be willing to
[2:20:37] go I can only speak these things
[2:20:43] as you have shown them to me and God I
[2:20:48] know that you speak because we all have
[2:20:50] need to hear this my prayer is that it
[2:20:56] won't just go in one ear and out the
[2:20:58] other don't don't let us come I mean
[2:21:00] there's a quote that for the Rando
[2:21:01] saying that we were so busy God loves to
[2:21:04] have fellowship he wants to fellowship
[2:21:05] with us but we're so busy that he can't
[2:21:08] even get the time in and fellowship with
[2:21:10] us the way he desires don't let us be
[2:21:15] that way let us let us start freeing up
[2:21:18] our Sundays where we're not putting
[2:21:21] things in place and and plans in place
[2:21:23] where if you decided to just hold us
[2:21:26] just for a little bit that we'd be
[2:21:29] looking at our watches wondering what
[2:21:30] time was gonna get out of here god
[2:21:32] that's that's not the way you want us
[2:21:33] approaching you and if we're doing
[2:21:39] things just because that's what we do
[2:21:42] we're missing the point
[2:21:43] we don't come to prayer because that's
[2:21:45] what we do we don't we don't we don't
[2:21:47] come on Wednesday night because that's
[2:21:49] what we do a Friday night know Lord that
[2:21:51] we come because we want to draw closer
[2:21:53] to you you say if you draw nigh to me
[2:21:56] then I was drawn out of you so god I
[2:21:59] pray that we would all just do a
[2:22:03] inventory we would just just really
[2:22:07] begin to look at where we are as we're
[2:22:12] going to this Thanksgiving season help
[2:22:13] us really to look at where we are or God
[2:22:16] just to really begin to just process and
[2:22:20] if we're not what we need to be help us
[2:22:24] throw it to make things right with you
[2:22:25] that we can get where we need to be we
[2:22:28] have to realign our priorities and and
[2:22:30] all kind of things that we have we've
[2:22:32] put so much in front of you but now God
[2:22:35] let us reset
[2:22:37] keep you first we don't want this thing
[2:22:41] to be ritual you you you you don't you
[2:22:44] don't appreciate that that the scripture
[2:22:47] you know says people draw near with a
[2:22:49] mouth but their hearts are far from you
[2:22:51] we want our hearts to be close to you
[2:22:56] other times in Scripture Lord where
[2:22:58] there are many of you said that they did
[2:23:02] this and they did that and they did it
[2:23:04] all in your name but they did it with
[2:23:06] the wrong heart and because they did was
[2:23:10] wrong a heart you told them depart from
[2:23:12] me you worker of iniquity I don't even
[2:23:14] know you so it's not about how much we
[2:23:18] do it's the heart in which we're doing
[2:23:21] it in help us God help us Lord Jesus
[2:23:27] don't let us shout over this but let us
[2:23:30] really meditate and think about what's
[2:23:34] in our heart God I pray
[2:23:41] afraid that you do the work that only
[2:23:44] you could do
[2:23:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen
[2:23:57] thank you Jesus can we sing of course
[2:24:04] that a song I surrender all
[2:24:05] a man will sing that and just give me
[2:24:10] those words please church I want you to
[2:24:13] just just really Amen think think on
[2:24:20] where you are it's just one of the
[2:24:25] little notes that the Lord gave me so
[2:24:26] you can be doing a lot of things for God
[2:24:28] without the right heart and doing it but
[2:24:31] you'll find at the end of the road God
[2:24:33] was not accepting it and when you
[2:24:36] Matthew 7:21 through 23 said not
[2:24:40] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[2:24:41] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[2:24:43] but he that doeth the will of my father
[2:24:45] which is in heaven many will say to me
[2:24:47] in that day Lord Lord have them have not
[2:24:50] we prophesied my name and in thy name
[2:24:51] have cast out that was the main done
[2:24:54] many wonderful works then I then will I
[2:24:56] profess unto them I never knew you
[2:24:58] depart from me ye that work iniquity and
[2:25:00] what I gained from that church is it's
[2:25:02] all about what's in our heart is not
[2:25:04] doing a whole bunch of stuff of God if
[2:25:05] our heart is not right in what we're
[2:25:07] doing it's not being accepted we really
[2:25:10] want to don't make it a ritual make it
[2:25:12] relationship a man as we just sang a few
[2:25:16] courses of this song amen I surrender
[2:25:18] all I surrender on
[2:25:25] I surrender all to him my free leading I
[2:25:43] will ever love and trust him in his

[2:29:57] the name of Charlie is actually in the
[2:30:01] hospital now with leave his terminal

[2:30:18] everything like that brother the wisdom
[2:30:20] used to work with Charlie and and he
[2:30:23] just did a lot of these things just out
[2:30:24] of the kindness of his heart didn't
[2:30:26] charges anything and and and I know what
[2:30:30] we can do for him is certainly offer
[2:30:31] prayer on his behalf this morning
[2:30:35] brother Steven had mentioned as we just
[2:30:37] you know we was just giving God a thanks
[2:30:41] for some of the things that he's done
[2:30:42] for us this year and one of the great
[2:30:44] things is we saw God but heal cancer two
[2:30:47] times two times in our myths sister Sam
[2:30:51] and man this was healed my sister Tanya
[2:30:55] and God been good to us

[2:31:12] to go a man on back on his behalf and
[2:31:15] stand in the gap for the wisdom to be
[2:31:17] going down to pray with them a little a
[2:31:19] little later today and just pray that
[2:31:21] God would just even give brother wisdom
[2:31:22] the right words a man the sharing in his
[2:31:25] prayer but we want to go believe in God
[2:31:27] we know what God is able to do in and
[2:31:29] and that has been so kind to the bride
[2:31:31] of Jesus right we just were asking God
[2:31:34] just to kind of give him a man you know

[2:33:18] preach there was a brother from England
[2:33:21] I can't thank Chico see he came on a
[2:33:25] Wednesday night he preached when he did
[2:33:26] a wonderful job and I brother Westco
[2:33:28] brought the believers over and and I was
[2:33:30] so happy to see the Saints from from the
[2:33:32] West Coast Church here but what I was
[2:33:34] sad to see is that
[2:33:35] we had less things of our own that
[2:33:39] attended than the sanction brother let's
[2:33:41] go to church it shouldn't be that way if
[2:33:43] you if you hosting a get-together
[2:33:47] shouldn't you be home huh if you hosted
[2:33:52] it shouldn't you be at the house phrase

[2:33:58] that on your calendar December 6 get
[2:34:00] your schedules of range so you can be in
[2:34:02] church amen on that night and and if you
[2:34:06] and I'm sure if you get your schedules
[2:34:07] around you can get to church on December

[2:34:38] us every time we walk through these
[2:34:43] church doors we see what this man is
[2:34:47] done
[2:34:50] god he did it from his heart out of his
[2:34:55] own money it was his way of just just
[2:34:57] giving to your people Lord he really
[2:35:01] didn't know us but because he knew
[2:35:02] brother wisdom God the man gave us favor
[2:35:08] Charlie needs you God Charlie is in need
