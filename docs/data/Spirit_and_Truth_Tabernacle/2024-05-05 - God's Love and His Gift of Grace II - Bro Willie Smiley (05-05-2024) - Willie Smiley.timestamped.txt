[57:06] started growing up and I'm still trying
[57:09] to get over the fact that they not they
[57:12] not babies and let letting go is is been
[57:16] been difficult for me as a father
[57:20] protector and all of that trying to let
[57:22] go and uh let them them uh take their
[57:26] wings and fly that ain't
[57:29] easy but it's I guess it's just
[57:31] something that you have to learn to do
[57:34] amen as as a as a dad uh Romans chapter

[57:41] verses now y'all pray for me and uh
[57:45] we'll we'll just see how God directs us
[57:48] this morning it says therefore uh being
[57:51] justified by faith we have peace with

[58:01] to this Grace wherein we stand and

[58:13] patience and patience work with
[58:16] experience and experience
[58:18] hope and hope make it not ashamed
[58:21] because the love of God is shed abroad
[58:23] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[58:26] is given unto us for when we were yet
[58:29] without strength and Due Time Christ had
[58:32] died for the
[58:33] ungodly uh for scarcely for a righteous
[58:36] man will one die yet pre adventure for a
[58:39] good man some would even dare to die but
[58:43] God commended his love towards us in
[58:47] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[58:50] died for us much more than uh being now
[58:55] just as ified by his blood we shall be
[58:59] saved from the Wrath through him for if
[59:02] when we were enemies we were reconciled
[59:05] to God by the death of his son much more
[59:09] being reconciled we shall be saved by
[59:12] his life and not only so but we also joy
[59:16] in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[59:19] whom we have no uh we have now received
[59:23] the atonement let us bow our heads Grace
[59:26] father we just come to give thanks and
[59:28] praise this morning for allowing us this
[59:31] opportunity to be here Lord and uh we
[59:34] just trust that you could take control
[59:36] of uh uh our thoughts and help us to say
[59:40] something that'll be uh edifying and
[59:43] encouraging oh God this morning Lord
[59:46] we're just trusting and depending on you
[59:49] oh God and we just be so careful to give
[59:51] you praise in Jesus name amen amen you
[59:53] may be seated praise the Lord uh we just
[59:56] like to use a uh as a topic the um God's
[1:00:00] love and this is the topic that we used
[1:00:03] on Easter
[1:00:05] Sunday um morning and uh I told us
[1:00:08] during that time that it's just so much
[1:00:12] and and I'm going try to do my best this
[1:00:14] morning but uh uh when when we look at
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:18] scriptures uh the scriptures constantly
[1:00:21] unfold right you know even uh the
[1:00:24] brothers they understand you know you
[1:00:26] preaching sir I just want to also make
[1:00:28] mention I we appreciate brother Mark on
[1:00:30] Wednesday
[1:00:31] night
[1:00:33] amen I really I really enjoy the the
[1:00:37] young brothers and listening to what God
[1:00:40] gives them he's always real encouraging
[1:00:42] and preaching on the seven compound
[1:00:44] names and just really really encouraging
[1:00:48] and building our faith but um um uh as
[1:00:52] as ministers we we we realize you preach
[1:00:55] a sermon and then you go home and the
[1:00:57] sermon it it opens up and you preach a
[1:01:00] little bit more and it constantly
[1:01:02] constantly unfold right uh there's times
[1:01:05] uh even the prophet he made reference he
[1:01:08] said you know he goes from Genesis to
[1:01:10] Revelations and back and forth and and
[1:01:13] just W watches all the the shadows and
[1:01:16] types of the scripture yes sir and and
[1:01:19] also as as I was thinking about uh this
[1:01:22] Romans chapter 5 I thought to myself
[1:01:25] this is a good uh fundamental scripture
[1:01:29] for uh new converts and non-believers
[1:01:32] and things of that nature that that
[1:01:34] it'll help us uh in our experiences with
[1:01:38] God right uh one of the things I you
[1:01:41] know uh thoughts come as you as you
[1:01:44] studying and I was thinking you know uh
[1:01:47] when when we come to the world there's
[1:01:50] there's things that we don't even really
[1:01:52] consider especially at the early stages
[1:01:55] of Our Lives as as human
[1:01:58] beings um we don't really have many
[1:02:02] questions about things and and just as
[1:02:05] as we grow and and as we
[1:02:07] mature we we start starts to we start to
[1:02:11] look at life from a a a different
[1:02:14] perspective right questions start coming
[1:02:17] that that we need answering answers to
[1:02:22] in order to settle us amen as as uh
[1:02:27] individuals right even even before our
[1:02:30] conversions that's this questions start
[1:02:33] to pop up in our minds you know that we
[1:02:36] you could go on for years and you never
[1:02:39] consider you know I I can recall uh
[1:02:42] being a younger uh guy and and you know
[1:02:45] things just you you just you just come
[1:02:47] up and you grow up and and you might
[1:02:49] learn your uh family pedigree and and
[1:02:53] who your parents are and and you know
[1:02:55] your surroundings but then you're still
[1:02:58] you know you still realize there's an
[1:03:00] emptiness you
[1:03:02] know what what causes all of this what
[1:03:06] what's behind all of this and and that
[1:03:09] may not come for years like I say you
[1:03:12] know it wasn't until I got a little bit
[1:03:14] older uh cuz you know we grow up in
[1:03:17] church I went to Sunday school probably
[1:03:19] like all other kids did this morning uh
[1:03:22] I went to Sunday school but at at that
[1:03:25] time the questions really really wasn't
[1:03:28] there but then you know after being con
[1:03:32] converted you start you start to realize
[1:03:36] certain things right about our existence
[1:03:40] right right and and why we here and and
[1:03:44] what what brought us here in this
[1:03:47] condition where where we got to fight we
[1:03:50] got to struggle we we got to battle what
[1:03:54] what what what
[1:03:56] caused all of this yeah right amen what
[1:04:00] what caused all of this why why am I
[1:04:03] struggling so hard why why life is so so
[1:04:07] difficult on is that right somebody
[1:04:09] ought to say Amen this morning right wh
[1:04:12] why why is it such a a a a struggle
[1:04:16] every day there's there's a struggle
[1:04:18] there's there's mind battles and there
[1:04:21] you know some of us going through this
[1:04:22] morning physical battles and you know
[1:04:26] we've matured now we're we're we're in
[1:04:29] Christ and we we have some of the
[1:04:31] answers to our questions but you know uh
[1:04:36] just take for for instance some of these
[1:04:38] younger guys who who may not have
[1:04:41] gravitated to that spot where they have
[1:04:44] the kind of questions as yet but they're
[1:04:47] going to come to it now right but you
[1:04:50] know if there's a Bible question there's
[1:04:52] got to be a Bible answer if if any at
[1:04:56] any time that's
[1:04:58] questions God is obligated by his word
[1:05:02] to answer the questions that we have in
[1:05:05] our heart that's right is that right
[1:05:08] amen because when we look at scripture
[1:05:11] initially amen you go back to Genesis
[1:05:14] which is the seed chapter of the Bible
[1:05:17] we we we look at that and we and we we
[1:05:20] we realize amen that everything that God
[1:05:23] did was perfect
[1:05:27] right everything was good he was able to
[1:05:30] look and see my you know if if that's
[1:05:33] how he talked back then I guess that's
[1:05:36] how I talk all right but uh to to look
[1:05:39] back at at what he had did and seeing
[1:05:43] the the the order of the things and my
[1:05:46] this is this is wonderful yeah this is
[1:05:49] great setting a pattern right setting
[1:05:53] setting an order set setting Something
[1:05:57] In Motion even having the knowledge
[1:06:00] being infinite that that that would be a
[1:06:04] fault right but but God established an
[1:06:08] order
[1:06:10] right God's establ I got to say God I
[1:06:14] got to put it cuz what we find today is
[1:06:17] we find start to find the order of God
[1:06:21] and the principles of God uh is starting
[1:06:24] to be broken right that's right right
[1:06:27] but I mean we still got religion and we
[1:06:29] still got churchianity but you know you
[1:06:32] goad it's certain things that I find is
[1:06:35] missing
[1:06:36] right right and anytime we find that
[1:06:39] anything start to get out of its place
[1:06:42] right is it's it's kind of becomes
[1:06:46] chaotic right right it it kind of
[1:06:50] becomes a little bit deformed uh it be
[1:06:54] kind of becomes a freak
[1:06:56] HH right so I this is why I just kind of
[1:07:00] appreciate my understanding personally
[1:07:04] of of what Redemption is is that right
[1:07:07] right you know looking back at before
[1:07:10] the fall and so on Easter what we was
[1:07:14] just trying to show that you know God
[1:07:17] what God did but then show us also what
[1:07:21] the
[1:07:22] church what what the individuals did did
[1:07:26] right in in Breaking the word right
[1:07:31] right come on yeah glory to God because
[1:07:35] God gave them a mandate you know there's
[1:07:38] a tree here and there's something here
[1:07:41] and that day you eat thereof that day
[1:07:44] you die right yeah that was just so
[1:07:47] simple right right that that was very
[1:07:50] very simple uh but but then you know we
[1:07:55] know Satan had a plan yeah right amen
[1:08:00] Satan wanted to produce a family after
[1:08:04] his kind he Satan had
[1:08:07] Ambitions come on glory to God Satan had
[1:08:10] Ambitions right to to exalt himself
[1:08:14] right to be exalted to build a bigger
[1:08:18] and much better amen Kingdom than
[1:08:22] Michael ah right he he brought deception
[1:08:26] we know amen all the way back in heaven
[1:08:30] but then there was a war and he was
[1:08:32] kicked out he found himself eastn Eden
[1:08:36] uhhuh right he found God's Masterpiece
[1:08:41] right then then he found the woman he
[1:08:43] found the church however you want to
[1:08:45] place it it's all there right right and
[1:08:48] then he brought her he brought her amen
[1:08:53] a thought uhhuh right
[1:08:56] right they had discussion biblically yes
[1:08:59] come on see if we look back if we look
[1:09:02] back to Genesis he wasn't talking to her
[1:09:05] about drinking liquor he wasn't talking
[1:09:07] to her about smoking weed he wasn't
[1:09:10] talking see those things are just the
[1:09:13] attributes of sin come on now right his
[1:09:18] objective was to get her amen off of the
[1:09:21] word of
[1:09:23] God get her away from the standard of
[1:09:27] God that's it is that right get out get
[1:09:31] out from behind the amen The Fortress
[1:09:34] from behind her protection come on is
[1:09:37] that right Amen to to to just bring her
[1:09:41] to a place you know the Bible says she
[1:09:43] was she was deceived uhhuh yeah right
[1:09:47] that's scripture how many read that in
[1:09:49] the Bible there come on she was deceived
[1:09:53] yeah the Bible don't say no way where
[1:09:55] Adam was deceived right right right the
[1:09:59] woman was
[1:10:00] deceived yeah is that right glory to God
[1:10:04] Amen the B PL up but just thank God that
[1:10:08] God had a plan in the back part of his
[1:10:11] mind is that right but it it was be it
[1:10:15] was because of it was because of of this
[1:10:21] this
[1:10:23] deception right that that that that
[1:10:26] caused all of what we going through come
[1:10:28] on come on is that right my God glory to
[1:10:32] God but I want to read us some quotes

[1:11:04] challenge me on it when I get
[1:11:06] done uh but you're fine I'm in there so
[1:11:10] but this morning but this morning I felt
[1:11:13] like uh doing it doing it this way
[1:11:16] because I want I just want to break out
[1:11:19] I want to bring out some things so that
[1:11:21] you know somebody sometimes people you
[1:11:23] know uh uh you know brother SM ain't
[1:11:26] read no quotes I ain't had to read no
[1:11:30] quotes I was quoting the whole time all
[1:11:32] right all right all right amen come on
[1:11:36] brother all right but but I I want to
[1:11:39] read us this this some this this
[1:11:41] quotation now where it's from I I I got
[1:11:45] too much stuff up here I'm glad when we
[1:11:48] get delivered of this place so we can
[1:11:49] get a real pull pit back in the place
[1:11:53] you know so I could put some of this
[1:11:55] stuff up here come on brother you know
[1:11:57] come on if nothing else I want to
[1:12:00] deliver is try to preach and you got
[1:12:02] this little spot I have and cuz I'm a
[1:12:05] little old school too I have stuff on
[1:12:08] this tablet and paper and I'm trying to
[1:12:11] get used to the computer but but I want
[1:12:13] to read this quote uh uh he says but but
[1:12:19] uh now this is this quote is just
[1:12:23] dealing with after the fall uh right
[1:12:26] after after uh uh uh the fall and God
[1:12:32] comes down and things of that nature he
[1:12:34] says but then uh when I see when this
[1:12:37] poor little Eve looked over in the face
[1:12:40] of Adam poor little Eve come on
[1:12:44] right amen and know that she was the
[1:12:47] cause of the fall of the human
[1:12:50] race
[1:12:52] right she threw her arms around
[1:12:55] and Adam was not deceived uhuh the Bible
[1:12:59] said he walked out with both eyes open
[1:13:03] oh my right Adam at no time was deceived
[1:13:06] yeah right amen but Eve was deceived
[1:13:10] because Eve was the one having the
[1:13:12] discussion with the serpent it don't the
[1:13:14] Bible don't say nowhere where Adam and
[1:13:17] the serpent was having this this uh
[1:13:19] dialogue yeah right but it does say that
[1:13:22] Eve and the serpent right amen yeah uh
[1:13:28] uh cuz once they had to fall and and God
[1:13:31] comes down and and was bringing judgment
[1:13:34] and Adam said a
[1:13:36] woman and then watch he didn't say Adam
[1:13:41] she said the
[1:13:42] serpent right the serpent begal me right
[1:13:45] right right glory to God but he says uh
[1:13:49] he I'm just trying to use this to get to
[1:13:51] a little point because we we're we're
[1:13:53] talking about the love of God
[1:13:55] right yes and and one of the things that
[1:13:59] I want to bring out this morning is to
[1:14:01] show us just how how great the love of
[1:14:05] God is amen right the the love of God is
[1:14:09] just so great that that it didn't just
[1:14:13] it didn't just focus on the mistake oh
[1:14:18] my right it it right love love
[1:14:21] superseded all of that that's real good
[1:14:24] love love was so because because if it
[1:14:28] wasn't he would have brought
[1:14:31] judgment glory to God because now listen
[1:14:34] he he did tell him the day you eat
[1:14:37] thereof that day you die so he by right
[1:14:42] by right he could have judged them but
[1:14:45] then where things would have gone from
[1:14:47] there right glory to God but
[1:14:51] but in his mind a lamb was slain before
[1:14:54] the foundation of the world is that
[1:14:56] right amen amen amen you know I said all
[1:15:01] that to say you know sometimes uh even
[1:15:05] me more more now in this season you know
[1:15:09] when you start to talk about
[1:15:11] love we we we might need to
[1:15:15] really ponder it come on now ponder it
[1:15:19] really think about it based
[1:15:22] upon uh the love of God
[1:15:26] to see if it's if it's what kind of love
[1:15:29] it actually is
[1:15:31] right it can be a love yeah right but is
[1:15:35] it is is it an agop of Love based upon
[1:15:39] scripture huh right or it's ailio love
[1:15:45] based upon feelings and conditions and
[1:15:48] things of that nature right yeah glory
[1:15:50] to God oh my y'all don't get quiet come
[1:15:53] on come on
[1:15:55] I'm just getting started come on but he
[1:15:57] says and Adam was not deceived the Bible
[1:16:00] said he walked out with both eyes open
[1:16:03] Eve was
[1:16:04] deceived so he walked
[1:16:07] out I mean that's
[1:16:10] love right right amen uh uh he walked
[1:16:16] out with both eyes open Eve was deceived
[1:16:20] so he walked out he seeing that he
[1:16:23] wasn't deceived so his wife was
[1:16:27] turned right yeah he put his arms around
[1:16:30] her and listen I could hear them as they
[1:16:33] they uh start going out Clump Clump now
[1:16:38] now this was after God had clothed them
[1:16:42] uhhuh right right we unring but God was
[1:16:45] clothing God is always God is clothing
[1:16:49] amen huh amen amen he said what is it
[1:16:53] bloody sheep skin beating against the
[1:16:57] lead the go God that whole universe I
[1:17:01] can see it begin to come down like in a
[1:17:04] funnel and I like this come down to this
[1:17:08] little one thing four letters love l e
[1:17:12] he just couldn't see them oh my wow
[1:17:16] right wow he loved them so well that he
[1:17:20] couldn't see them go amen right uhuh he
[1:17:24] L's let's be realistic God didn't want
[1:17:27] to see them go from the place that he
[1:17:32] provided a place a place of security a a
[1:17:36] place of health and things God didn't
[1:17:39] want to do it sometimes as parents you
[1:17:42] don't want to do what you got to do but
[1:17:44] you got to do what you got to do Brother
[1:17:47] come on cuz sometimes you know one kid
[1:17:50] could be very detrimental to the rest of
[1:17:52] the kids all right and and in in in your
[1:17:56] heart you still love that person right
[1:18:00] right you know as a youngster I used to
[1:18:02] think my mama did not love
[1:18:05] me but then when I grew up she told me
[1:18:08] that that wasn't it she said you know
[1:18:10] what I wanted to make you a man so so I
[1:18:14] didn't I didn't cuddle you cuddle yeah
[1:18:17] yeah yeah I put responsibility on you
[1:18:22] right I I treated you a certain way
[1:18:25] right so so that you could
[1:18:28] Excel but but you know uh I took that as
[1:18:32] she didn't love me I could imagine the
[1:18:34] Eagles in in its nest when the mama walk
[1:18:37] in there and go crazy yes yes come on
[1:18:41] get the taking everything out the nest
[1:18:44] she F she F to kick y' you know the
[1:18:47] morning day time kick you to the curb a
[1:18:49] little bit all right cuz cuz if she
[1:18:51] don't you'll never come to a place of
[1:18:54] maturity
[1:18:55] so when you think she's
[1:18:58] insane right amen you you start
[1:19:02] realizing if she had not have done it I
[1:19:06] could have never expressed the
[1:19:09] attributes of an
[1:19:12] ego right she done made this thing tight
[1:19:16] tough and everything else right but but
[1:19:21] love uh was the thing that allowed ow
[1:19:25] her to do
[1:19:26] it right glory to God so so you put the
[1:19:30] quote back up God God didn't God did it
[1:19:33] didn't do it because he didn't love them
[1:19:36] uhhuh right glory to God okay uh so he
[1:19:41] loved them so well that he couldn't see
[1:19:44] them go and he said he put IM enity this
[1:19:49] where he gives them a promise between
[1:19:51] her seed and the serpent seed

[1:19:57] that and that same clumping of the

[1:22:31] when God looked down and he seen that
[1:22:33] love of now this is powerful though he
[1:22:37] said when God saw the love of human
[1:22:39] beings it was so great that he couldn't
[1:22:43] stand it
[1:22:44] himself right he said I'll come and go
[1:22:48] two see and I'll put eny between them
[1:22:52] right but but
[1:22:55] it it it was because of a choice is
[1:22:59] powerful we can take that down I'm done
[1:23:01] with that we Choice it was because of
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:06] choice uh of Adam right that that caused
[1:23:12] all of this right be because had not
[1:23:16] there been a fall we understanding what
[1:23:19] we've been taught through amen a prophet
[1:23:23] that we would have came by the
[1:23:26] word right but after the fall the second
[1:23:30] Covenant was given right so we had to
[1:23:34] come by
[1:23:35] sex yeah right now if I'm off brother
[1:23:39] Jack correct come on right right yeah
[1:23:44] amen so
[1:23:47] so that's that's just God's order right
[1:23:51] yeah we we we come we come we come by
[1:23:54] say
[1:23:55] yes but it it was because of the Cho
[1:23:58] choice is
[1:23:59] powerful right and
[1:24:01] and church I I I'll say this you know
[1:24:05] and I'm 61 and I'm still
[1:24:07] learning I'm still growing I'm still
[1:24:09] maturing and in my thinking sometimes
[1:24:11] even of late I I I I talk to God and
[1:24:15] it's
[1:24:16] like it's if if it was for the Holy
[1:24:19] Ghost I would get discouraged a little
[1:24:21] bit all right um but you know God does
[1:24:25] things at his own time amen right G God
[1:24:29] gives us what he gives us at at his own
[1:24:32] at his own appointed time amen and
[1:24:35] sometimes you you you look back and and
[1:24:37] I tell you what as a younger generation
[1:24:40] it it's important for y'all to take the
[1:24:44] advantage of of the knowledge and the
[1:24:46] wisdom that's afforded you uh in this
[1:24:52] season right because I can say you know
[1:24:56] uh from my own personal now this just me
[1:24:59] from my own personal experience there's
[1:25:01] a lot of things that I did not obtain
[1:25:05] uhuh and wasn't accessible and even even
[1:25:09] in
[1:25:10] Ministry uh uh looking back they didn't
[1:25:14] have what I needed to help me as a young
[1:25:17] man all right all right come on Church
[1:25:20] yeah cuz cuz you know I I appreciate you
[1:25:23] know and we must get the baptism of the
[1:25:26] Holy Ghost you must be born again but
[1:25:29] but you know one thing I realize now you
[1:25:31] know after the birth after we get them
[1:25:34] born again what we going to do with them
[1:25:36] where we going to take them what what
[1:25:38] are they going to gravitate to right
[1:25:42] right and and life
[1:25:44] goes uh Beyond these four
[1:25:47] walls right amen life life goes beyond
[1:25:52] CHR Christian Life
[1:25:54] right devs into our
[1:25:58] entire uh
[1:26:00] existence that's beyond just shouting
[1:26:03] that's beyond just cuz uh you can't you
[1:26:07] can't just shout when you face with a
[1:26:10] trial you might be able to shout in the
[1:26:13] trial all right but sometimes you can't
[1:26:16] shout your way out of it right you have
[1:26:18] to have some knowledge some wisdom some
[1:26:22] some some understanding yes right glory
[1:26:26] to God some some
[1:26:28] communion with with God right where God
[1:26:31] can speak to you where God can direct
[1:26:34] you is that right and and and I and I'll
[1:26:38] say this because I've been around for a
[1:26:40] while now uh uh you you younger
[1:26:45] generation y'all in the best season
[1:26:49] ever oh my come on I I just wish that
[1:26:53] that you know I could have sat up under
[1:26:57] uh the kind of ministry that y'all are
[1:26:59] given the opportunity to sit up under in
[1:27:02] this hour because it's it's more it's
[1:27:06] more understanding it's more resources
[1:27:09] it's more things that's that's out here
[1:27:13] right right right that that all we got
[1:27:16] was was was the Holy Ghost yeah quoting
[1:27:20] and and and little pet doctrines and and
[1:27:24] that caused divisions amongst us and and
[1:27:28] and and just all sorts of things that
[1:27:31] were were not biblical and I'm I'm
[1:27:34] saying that the the attitudes and the
[1:27:37] different things that those things
[1:27:38] produce it was an indication that those
[1:27:41] things were not amen biblical because
[1:27:45] it's not God's objective to separate but

[1:28:52] was to bring together yes right to bring
[1:28:56] to bring the the family to bring the
[1:28:59] church back to a place amen where they
[1:29:02] could fellowship with

[1:29:14] Amen he walked out with his wife yes he
[1:29:18] lost everything is that
[1:29:22] right but God wasn't willing for that to

[1:29:27] space right amen glory to God God God
[1:29:31] started to work in on the Masterpiece is
[1:29:34] that right glory glory to his wonderful
[1:29:36] name but uh I'm I'm trying to go how
[1:29:39] much time I
[1:29:40] got uh I I was saying to myself I want
[1:29:44] to just labor on this first part then
[1:29:46] get to my my text for
[1:29:48] today uh our subtitle will be uh we must
[1:29:53] see the the benefits of
[1:29:55] believing uh but give give me another
[1:29:58] two or three minutes on on on this this
[1:30:00] one part it was it was because of one
[1:30:03] one man's
[1:30:05] choice that that uh we find ourself in
[1:30:10] this position where we we bypassed our
[1:30:13] theophany we we you know we we come on
[1:30:18] the earth to be tested and tried right
[1:30:21] is that right glory to God and and and
[1:30:24] proven uh uh but then but then uh the
[1:30:30] choice of one man right which is Christ
[1:30:36] the choice that he
[1:30:37] made uh to to die right to die to to it
[1:30:44] was his choice to die it was his choice
[1:30:47] to give us the free gift amen right
[1:30:51] glory to God which which
[1:30:54] is is
[1:30:57] greater right when when we think about
[1:31:00] biblical principles when we think about
[1:31:03] restoration when we think about what God
[1:31:06] has done for
[1:31:09] us what God does for us supersedes
[1:31:13] everything amen supersedes all of our
[1:31:16] failures supersedes all of our our
[1:31:20] disappointments it it it catapults us
[1:31:24] yeah yeah is that right yes glory to God
[1:31:30] right when we place it on the scale cuz
[1:31:33] sometimes as individuals we hard on
[1:31:35] ourselves on and and we we have this
[1:31:39] tendency of of uh you know and and I'm
[1:31:42] guilty too sometimes of of um just poor
[1:31:47] me and why me and and come on come on
[1:31:53] self
[1:31:54] self-pity right and and and all of that
[1:31:57] and and they got this and I don't have
[1:32:00] it and you know and y'all ought to talk
[1:32:02] to me somebody uh and and it just it's
[1:32:06] an indication that that we're failing to
[1:32:10] understand what our faith and belief in
[1:32:14] God actually should be meaning to us all
[1:32:19] right all right all right what what it
[1:32:22] affords us right

[1:33:17] what Paul Paul relating to uh this this
[1:33:22] Roman Roman Church church and and you

[1:33:28] Bible the opening of the word is to
[1:33:31] Anchor us
[1:33:33] Amen to to bring
[1:33:36] stability right yes can we say Amen
[1:33:40] today the the opening of the word has
[1:33:43] never been about arguing and fussing I
[1:33:46] can't I I can't hard understand all that
[1:33:49] right amen but to bring Clarity to bring
[1:33:55] stability right glory to God to give us
[1:33:59] what it takes to be able to overcome in
[1:34:01] this age of of overcoming yes right
[1:34:05] because we got to overcome according to
[1:34:07] the Book of Revelations right but watch
[1:34:10] watch watch this he says therefore being
[1:34:13] justified by
[1:34:15] faith all right glory to God fa faith is
[1:34:20] a revelation right faith is a revelation
[1:34:23] of of of the will of God faith is is is
[1:34:27] an understanding of what God's plan for
[1:34:33] the church has been all about all right
[1:34:36] come on glory to God this hasn't been
[1:34:39] something that's been random yeah right
[1:34:43] right right amen sometimes you listen
[1:34:46] you listen to people and it's like that
[1:34:48] their comments and their statements and
[1:34:51] it's like you just don't really
[1:34:53] understand the plan of God right because
[1:34:57] because God people see you know they
[1:34:59] question God if if there's a god well
[1:35:02] why he allow this and why he allow that
[1:35:05] and why he allow this you you only
[1:35:08] seeing one facet uhhuh and and you're
[1:35:11] not really
[1:35:14] understanding just the the sovereignty
[1:35:17] and the love of God right amen is that
[1:35:21] right and and and what God is doing
[1:35:24] by what he's allowing amen right like
[1:35:28] the critic said one time um um a God
[1:35:31] that would just kind of sit back and
[1:35:33] allow mothers but then you know a man
[1:35:36] with understanding comes on the scene
[1:35:39] and and he sees where it had to be that
[1:35:43] seed had to fall into the ground and die
[1:35:47] right right it had right right see and
[1:35:51] in order for the next stage to come
[1:35:55] about amen we know that in planting
[1:35:58] anything that seed falls into the ground
[1:36:01] and die uhhuh right and and it's it goes
[1:36:05] through a process and through that
[1:36:07] process brings forth another
[1:36:11] stage and then another stage and then
[1:36:14] another stage and another stage to it
[1:36:17] bring forth you know a full grain of
[1:36:20] corn amen amen amen amen right amen amen
[1:36:24] glory to his wonderful name but he says
[1:36:28] uh uh therefore being justified by
[1:36:34] faith
[1:36:37] right we have peace with God yeah
[1:36:41] amen glory to God and and listen apart
[1:36:45] from
[1:36:47] that right apart from I belief and faith

[1:37:02] God and then you know this
[1:37:05] doesn't negate the fact that you goingon

[1:37:15] through yeah you can go home and go to
[1:37:18] bed and go to sleep amen

[1:41:01] matter what anybody say so many critics
[1:41:03] so many Skeptics of the Bible that ain't

[1:41:28] right faith is a powerful thing amen
[1:41:31] it's it's simple you just got to be

[1:42:07] access right amen something that's
[1:42:13] permanent right cuz he here's here's
[1:42:16] here's sometimes our understanding of of

[1:42:23] oh I made a
[1:42:26] mistake then then we're we're kind of
[1:42:29] fearful yeah you know and God don't
[1:42:33] operate like that come on now we operate
[1:42:36] like that come on God don't operate like

[1:43:30] right that's exactly right that's a man
[1:43:32] or he allow he a prophet allow somebody
[1:43:36] else to talk him into something that God

[2:16:29] God and uh how we just appreciate his
[2:16:32] love that's been uh given to us I just
[2:16:35] love the the scripture while we were yet
[2:16:39] sinners Christ already
[2:16:41] died and uh God had a plan from the very
[2:16:44] beginning when he saw Adam and Eve make
[2:16:48] the decision God it didn't catch God by
[2:16:51] surprised uh God knew these things were
[2:16:53] going to happen but this was a way for
[2:16:55] him to express his love to us and uh you
[2:16:58] know it's just it's just beautiful i i i
[2:17:02] i as brother smile was just kind of
[2:17:04] going through uh the sermon then uh so
[2:17:07] much I just saw you know uh in the in
[2:17:10] the way that he painted the picture for
[2:17:11] us uh on today but uh I I really
[2:17:14] appreciate that thought of how when
[2:17:16] we're going through great trials and we
[2:17:18] realize the love of God that is given to
[2:17:20] us we're going through great trials
[2:17:23] distresses you might be going through
[2:17:25] right now but I'm going to tell you
[2:17:26] something don't you go home and be up
[2:17:29] all
[2:17:31] night the Bible says in the Book of
[2:17:34] Psalms that he gives his beloved
[2:17:37] sleep God God give you sleep it's it's
[2:17:41] only the devil trying to take your sleep
[2:17:44] from you I don't care if your bill ain't

[2:17:56] sleep God going to take care of it amen
[2:18:00] especially if you are a faithful tithe
[2:18:03] payer then there is a promise in the
[2:18:06] scripture that says I will now this is
[2:18:10] not your job but this is God's job I
[2:18:12] will rebuke the devour for your sake
[2:18:17] that's just the first part of it but
[2:18:18] there's another part to that promise is
[2:18:20] then I'm we going to open up the windows
[2:18:22] of heaven and pour you out blessings
[2:18:25] where you have room not enough to
[2:18:27] receive and when you get blessings where
[2:18:29] there's room not enough to receive you
[2:18:30] know it's easy to go to sleep

[2:20:39] Smiler was saying even this morning we
[2:20:41] uh our are when we were coming up uh it
[2:20:45] was a lot of infighting in this message
[2:20:49] it's a lot of infighting if if you
[2:20:51] didn't believe a certain thing you were
[2:20:53] out the circle was drawn and you were
[2:20:56] drawn out and uh and and you know it had
[2:20:59] churches all over you know but you
[2:21:01] couldn't fellowship with nobody because
[2:21:03] they didn't believe exactly what you
[2:21:04] believe and we had so much of that and
[2:21:07] and and all the sermons were designed to
[2:21:09] do is prove a point really it was the
[2:21:13] same thing being preached every time
[2:21:16] just a different
[2:21:17] title y'all go back and listen to the
[2:21:19] tapes it was the same thing being
[2:21:22] preached every time just a different
[2:21:24] title but here you know as God has
[2:21:27] matured us we realize there's more to
[2:21:29] this word than than that and even
[2:21:31] brother Brandon himself never went to
[2:21:33] seed don't know one thing he he he he
[2:21:36] shared all of it with us right so we
[2:21:38] thank God for this and and I just thank

[2:21:42] of get themselves out way all the way

[2:32:57] music uh they began to try to create an
[2:33:00] anointing around their mom and um and
[2:33:04] them girls got so anointed they each one
[2:33:06] taking turns praying over mama and
[2:33:10] speaking in tongues and everything I'm

[2:33:30] everything I just sat there and just
[2:33:32] patiently waited for them to finish and
[2:33:34] you know and um and uh and so I went
[2:33:36] over next door and told him said I just
[2:33:38] love to have a quick word of prayer with
[2:33:39] your mom um I'm I'm also a pastor and
[2:33:43] would just love to just offer a word of
[2:33:44] prayer so quickly offer the word of
[2:33:46] prayer because the nurses were waiting
[2:33:48] for us to get out of there
[2:33:50] uh but uh but it was just a blessing and
[2:33:52] and I think you know when we saw that it
[2:33:54] gave us a a confidence gave us a peace
[2:33:58] it let us be able to sleep God was in
[2:34:01] control God was in control he even
[2:34:04] control what what neighbor he would have
[2:34:07] in the bed and just how they would just
[2:34:10] create that atmosphere like that so it
[2:34:12] was real it was just a blessing God has
[2:34:14] a way of just giving you peace like that
[2:34:16] with whatever you're going through
[2:34:18] sometimes all you got to find is a the
[2:34:19] cloud the size of a man's hand and when
