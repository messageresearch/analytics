[4:05] we'll read verses 1 to 15.
[4:09] [Music]
[4:19] praise lord philippians 2 reads
[4:22] if there be therefore any consolation in
[4:24] christ
[4:25] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[4:28] of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[4:32] fulfill ye my joy that ye may be
[4:35] like-minded having the same love being
[4:37] of one accord
[4:39] of one mind
[4:40] let nothing be done through strife or
[4:42] vain glory but in lowliness of mind
[4:45] let each esteem other better than
[4:47] themselves
[4:48] look not every man on his own things but
[4:51] every man also on the things of others
[4:54] let this mind be in you which was also
[4:56] in christ jesus
[4:58] who being in the form of god thought it
[5:00] not robbery to be equal with god
[5:03] but made himself of no reputation and
[5:06] took upon him the form of a servant and
[5:08] was made in the likeness of men
[5:11] and being found in fashion as a man he
[5:13] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[5:16] death even the death of the cross
[5:19] wherefore god has
[5:21] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[5:24] him and given him a name which is above
[5:27] every name
[5:28] that at the name of jesus every knee
[5:30] shall bow of things in heaven and things
[5:33] in the earth and things under the earth
[5:35] and that every tongue should confess to
[5:37] jesus christ as lord to the glory of god
[5:40] the father
[5:41] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[5:44] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[5:47] now much more in my absence
[5:49] work out your own salvation with fear
[5:51] and trembling
[5:53] for it is god which worketh in you both
[5:55] to will and to do his good pleasure
[5:58] do all things without murmurings and
[6:00] disputings that ye may be blameless and
[6:03] harmless the sons of god without rebuke
[6:06] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[6:08] nation among whom ye shine as lights in
[6:11] the world

[44:26] and just you got to catch the words as
[44:28] well i expect the impossible
[44:33] hey
[44:35] expecting god to do things that only god
[44:37] can do
[44:38] [Applause]

[45:10] [Applause]
[45:16] oh
[45:16] thank you jesus
[45:19] amen
[45:20] you know i was uh we we were just on the
[45:23] expectation um i think some of you all
[45:26] were here a few wednesdays ago and just
[45:29] just i just felt like it was just god
[45:31] just just speaking
[45:34] through our brother steve coming all the
[45:35] way from london england and
[45:37] preaching on the influence of the spoken
[45:39] word
[45:40] and um
[45:42] and as he was just preaching that and
[45:43] just just the way the lord was just
[45:45] lining up things there
[45:46] i i just knew i'm like this is god
[45:49] and he just began to
[45:51] read a a quote about a
[45:54] prophecy that was given years ago
[45:57] amen to a man a doctor that was looking
[45:59] for a building
[46:00] and um
[46:02] and as he was a you know looking for the
[46:04] building he had a specific spot in mind
[46:08] and then the prophet said now forget
[46:10] about that spot
[46:11] because god is giving you this spot over
[46:13] here
[46:15] and uh he said wait a minute it's just
[46:17] almost impossible for me to get that
[46:19] that's locked up by for 25 years ain't
[46:22] no way i can get it
[46:23] he says i don't care what they say about
[46:25] it being locked up god gave it to you
[46:28] and he said uh he called the prophet the
[46:30] next day he said you know i'm i'm
[46:32] freezing
[46:34] and now you got to read between the
[46:35] lines and what he's saying about he
[46:36] frees him because there's a statement
[46:38] that people make
[46:40] amen
[46:42] it's a statement that people make about
[46:44] hell freezing over
[46:46] before
[46:47] something come to pass and that they say
[46:49] i'm freezing
[46:50] right and that's right god will make you
[46:52] eat your
[46:54] words and i love god he overrides your
[46:57] unbelief
[46:59] hey
[47:00] i love god
[47:02] even if you doubt it god god will
[47:04] override your unbelief
[47:06] and still bring it to pass and make you
[47:09] eat your words in the process
[47:13] you ain't dealing with man you're
[47:14] dealing with god
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:19] but he told the process he said i'm
[47:21] freezing
[47:22] he see they had a special meeting last
[47:25] night and they changed everything and
[47:27] the adam bought the building already
[47:29] this morning
[47:30] praise the lord
[47:34] and as he was reading that you know just
[47:36] his whole sermon the foe lepers and you
[47:38] know we had the very next day uh playing
[47:40] for four brothers to go see a piece of
[47:42] property and
[47:43] um and and we were on our way and i say
[47:47] well i think god is all in this and when
[47:49] he got to the quote talk about the the
[47:51] the color of the building and and it's
[47:54] on the corners i told him everything
[47:56] that everything that was in the court
[47:57] was about this building that we were
[47:59] looking at and uh so church we are
[48:01] expecting a miracle
[48:05] every day
[48:07] god will make a way
[48:09] out of nowhere
[48:12] and you know i'm just be honest we
[48:13] called about it we went looked at it on
[48:16] saturday i mean thursday and then uh
[48:18] friday well i think few a few days later
[48:21] we'd be called about it and they said
[48:23] you know y'all came thursday but friday
[48:25] somebody put in a cash offer
[48:27] i said okay
[48:28] [Music]
[48:31] now i i was you beat me to it uh and i'm
[48:34] glad you said it like that sister
[48:36] cicinelli because sister nelly went
[48:38] through the exact same thing
[48:39] sometimes people have to share their
[48:41] testimonies you know what god has
[48:42] already done and i just begin to remind
[48:44] god say god you did it for sister nelly
[48:46] and brother calvin
[48:48] and you the same god today i don't care
[48:51] what they say if you've given it to us
[48:53] then you've given it to us
[48:55] praise god
[48:58] maybe god got something else for
[49:00] somebody else but i know what he got for
[49:02] me
[49:02] and what god has for me
[49:05] it is for me
[49:06] [Applause]
[49:09] so i just refuse to doubt
[49:12] i expect a miracle
[49:15] every day
[49:17] god will make a way
[49:19] out of nowhere
[49:23] hey you don't scare me i don't heard i
[49:25] don't heard about him you can't scare me
[49:26] with that now you you can't scare me
[49:28] with a testimony like that
[49:31] hallelujah
[49:33] glory to god
[49:35] hey
[49:36] so i i i want to say this um i thank god
[49:40] for amen um
[49:42] i don't want to just call him sister
[49:43] brown family i'ma say the family my
[49:44] family my family
[49:46] i'm so happy to see y'all this morning
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:50] amen and
[49:52] um you know it's just it's
[49:54] you know sometimes we we we go through
[49:56] seasons and life and
[49:58] and um you know people may look at this
[50:01] season
[50:02] of what we're going through
[50:04] and you may sometimes uh when when
[50:06] people go through i think i put a quote
[50:08] out there
[50:10] on social media where sometimes when job
[50:12] was going through
[50:14] man just seemed like uh he was just
[50:16] man like like god one with him anymore
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] all right but no that's a purge in time
[50:24] and during the purging time what god is
[50:26] doing is getting ready to produce more
[50:28] fruit
[50:29] and the other thing that that i found
[50:31] out is that you don't doubt god in the
[50:33] midst of what you're going through
[50:35] because when you doubt god you frustrate
[50:37] god
[50:38] actually you provoke god you make god
[50:41] mad
[50:42] when you doubt him when you're going
[50:44] through something i think this is just
[50:46] part of my testimony part of my story
[50:49] glory to god
[50:51] and and i'm happy i'm gonna be happy to
[50:54] uh to write this chapter
[50:56] come on somebody i'm gonna be happy to
[50:58] write this chapter but i know this
[51:00] chapter gonna turn to another chapter
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:04] and i'm under expectation
[51:06] so we thank god for all things uh as it
[51:09] was said brother and sister robles have
[51:11] returned home and
[51:13] amen we're so happy to have them
[51:15] back in florida
[51:17] the lord sent them a a buyer for the
[51:21] house and brother let's say the man came
[51:23] and bought his house and his car
[51:31] so he had to come here and buy himself a
[51:33] new car
[51:34] but god is good that's that's the god
[51:36] that we serve right

[52:29] actually have the the surgery on
[52:30] thursday i heard it's been rescheduled
[52:32] until this wednesday
[52:34] we want to remember to keep
[52:37] god's servant in prayer at 80 years old
[52:40] and you know going under surgery it's
[52:41] not not easy you know i mean i'm i'm in
[52:44] my 50s and i'm realizing that just
[52:47] little things that i used to do
[52:49] and i would heal just like that
[52:52] nah
[52:54] it seemed like it's taking forever for
[52:56] healing to manifest itself but but we
[52:59] want to remember amen our precious
[53:01] brother west go in prayer amen uh
[53:03] remember that just put on your calendar

[53:15] with with no problems i also got a
[53:17] praise report from
[53:19] um
[53:21] sister irma she had called and wanted
[53:23] prayer for her son he had to go to the
[53:24] hospital but she sent me a text this

[54:05] amen
[54:06] as um
[54:07] [Music]
[54:09] they are coming just wanted to mention
[54:12] just a a a couple of scriptures here
[54:14] that i want to read
[54:15] uh luke 18
[54:18] uh verse
[54:20] 15 through 17.
[54:22] amen
[54:27] because
[54:31] it says they brought
[54:33] unto him also infants
[54:36] that he would touch them
[54:38] but when his disciples saw it they
[54:40] rebuked them
[54:42] but jesus called them unto him and said
[54:44] suffer little children to come unto me
[54:47] and forbid them not
[54:50] for such is the kingdom of god
[54:53] it says verily i say unto you whosoever
[54:55] shall not receive the the kingdom of god
[54:57] as a little child
[54:59] shall in no wise enter
[55:02] therein amen so we don't um that's
[55:05] believe here in baptizing babies
[55:09] we dedicate them back to the lord

[1:12:56] daughters of god are found the gospel
[1:12:58] will reach them amen that's why we are
[1:13:00] here

[1:14:25] in this they have to go and chase them
[1:14:27] and give them their food majority of
[1:14:29] them come to downtown but some of them
[1:14:31] they have to go to even their workplaces
[1:14:33] on the street corners traffic light
[1:14:35] homes and give them food
[1:14:37] but one thing that i love about those
[1:14:39] people is that their heart
[1:14:41] is so open for the word of the lord
[1:14:44] they don't just go for the food you
[1:14:46] don't just they give their food they
[1:14:47] want to hear the word of the lord and as
[1:14:49] long as you want to tell them they are
[1:14:51] ready to listen
[1:14:52] so
[1:14:53] brother
[1:14:54] gabriel
[1:14:55] a witness and he's got 35 people out of
[1:14:58] their food pantry out of their
[1:15:00] food pantry so he's got a special
[1:15:02] service for them
[1:15:04] and uh because they are new people they
[1:15:05] are newbies so monday i think it's got
[1:15:08] about three or four days that he
[1:15:10] ministers to them in their homes they
[1:15:12] gather
[1:15:13] and then teach them and the lord is
[1:15:15] doing wonderful things in the armies and
[1:15:16] i'll share some peculiar testimonies
[1:15:18] with you let's go to the next slide
[1:15:22] this is uh people that work in recycling
[1:15:25] plants they're about together they're
[1:15:26] about 20. so we go there and give them
[1:15:29] their food and then we share just before
[1:15:31] you get there they're already in the
[1:15:32] front of the door waiting for the word
[1:15:34] of the lord they hear the word and it
[1:15:37] doesn't matter they were working
[1:15:38] they hear the word as long as we are
[1:15:40] preaching they will hear the word and
[1:15:43] the manager is in tune with it
[1:15:45] it's just wonderful so that was
[1:15:48] a recycling plan people some of them are
[1:15:50] immigrant from venezuela who migrated to
[1:15:53] colombia and some some are colombians
[1:15:56] let's go to
[1:15:57] the fed the next slide yeah the same
[1:15:59] people so we took a picture with them
[1:16:01] let's go to the next one i met this
[1:16:03] young man go to the next slide and
[1:16:06] yes this uh two young men
[1:16:09] i met this one this is david he's about
[1:16:12] 18 years old
[1:16:13] when i saw him go back to the previous
[1:16:16] slide
[1:16:17] his countenance looked very sad and i
[1:16:19] discerned that there was something
[1:16:22] not going on well with him so i greeted
[1:16:23] him and asked him for if you like some
[1:16:25] food and he said he doesn't need food
[1:16:28] and i said can we pray for you he says
[1:16:31] so we pray for for him
[1:16:33] and right after the prayers he was
[1:16:35] smiling from the inside out
[1:16:37] prayers changed everything
[1:16:40] i didn't ask him what was going on
[1:16:42] but i know
[1:16:43] things were things were not going on
[1:16:45] with him he's an immigrant a young man
[1:16:47] he's learning a trade
[1:16:49] he's from venezuela but because of
[1:16:51] economic crisis political crisis he has
[1:16:54] to move to another country probably
[1:16:56] where his parents are not there just 18
[1:16:57] years old and he's starting life on his
[1:17:00] own
[1:17:01] you never know how much you bless
[1:17:03] until you see some of those situations
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:06] let's go to the next slide please
[1:17:08] yes that's uh david these are the people
[1:17:10] in downtown i think that day we had
[1:17:12] about a saturdays
[1:17:13] we had about 150 people so we
[1:17:16] to begin with we went to we came to
[1:17:18] downtown and they were waiting for us
[1:17:20] and i said wow early morning they were
[1:17:22] waiting to get their food and hear the
[1:17:24] word of the lord and be prayed for
[1:17:27] and these are the street people and i
[1:17:29] will tell you more
[1:17:30] so we went to distribute food to people
[1:17:33] in their homes traffic lights and when
[1:17:35] we came about 150 people i said brother
[1:17:37] do we have food for them
[1:17:39] i mean i don't want us to people come
[1:17:42] and wait and you don't have separate
[1:17:43] that we have more than
[1:17:44] food for about 400 people so they are
[1:17:46] good that's okay glory hallelujah
[1:17:48] and all of them want praise
[1:17:51] they want to be prayed for
[1:17:52] i hadn't prayed like that after the
[1:17:54] prayers i felt like a paper
[1:17:56] i was feeling very light
[1:17:59] and by the gibberish the testimonies of
[1:18:01] that is so surprising it rains but it
[1:18:04] never rained when we are having a
[1:18:06] community table
[1:18:08] he gave that testimony before we left uh
[1:18:11] for the food pantry
[1:18:13] and right after we left we pray for them
[1:18:15] some of them are
[1:18:16] in colombia we have people who are color
[1:18:18] people just like us a lot of them
[1:18:21] i mean indigenous people and they come
[1:18:23] in
[1:18:24] they want to hear the word and you pray
[1:18:26] for them so right give us a brother
[1:18:28] there are more more people to pray for
[1:18:30] so cut is shorter let's move on
[1:18:32] so you pray and keep on and they want to
[1:18:34] hear the word and they want to hear and
[1:18:36] what i was doing was that i took their
[1:18:38] numbers those who have got whatsapp i
[1:18:40] took their numbers and gave it to
[1:18:41] brother gabriel i said you don't catch a
[1:18:43] fish and throw the fish back into the
[1:18:44] river you catch it and eat a fish so we
[1:18:47] don't want to just give them food and
[1:18:49] pray for them and let it be a one-day
[1:18:51] wonder we want to track them and see
[1:18:53] what the lord has for them eternally
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:57] let's move to the next slide please
[1:18:59] yes this has the same place downtown
[1:19:02] this is i want to share testimony about
[1:19:04] these two little girls
[1:19:06] luciana 11 year old and a little sister
[1:19:09] mariana nine years old
[1:19:11] and this before the appearance but
[1:19:13] gabriel's wife this is brother camilo
[1:19:15] and his wife go to the next slide i
[1:19:16] think i have the picture of the wife yes
[1:19:18] this is the myra
[1:19:20] then go back now this people were strict
[1:19:22] people in colombia one of the commonest
[1:19:25] issue is drugs
[1:19:27] children
[1:19:28] young elderly people drug is
[1:19:31] common
[1:19:32] i was in mexico one time and i didn't i
[1:19:34] didn't know spanish so the brother that
[1:19:35] went with me
[1:19:37] and his wife were
[1:19:38] going to walmart to buy he wanted to buy
[1:19:41] something for his dad so
[1:19:43] they were in the ken i was around the
[1:19:45] vehicle outside and this guy came on a
[1:19:46] bicycle and he said droga and i didn't
[1:19:49] understand i said maybe he's talking
[1:19:50] about truck maybe he thinks i need a cab
[1:19:52] a taxi
[1:19:53] so but david was laughing said do you
[1:19:55] understand what he meant said no he said
[1:19:57] you want you want you to know do you
[1:19:58] want cocaine if you want to buy cocaine
[1:20:00] he's got something for you i said wow
[1:20:02] that's amazing
[1:20:03] so cocaine is not they don't arrest
[1:20:05] nobody for possessing cocaine the police
[1:20:07] don't waste that time chasing people
[1:20:09] cocaine is everywhere
[1:20:11] it's not a it's not it's common even
[1:20:13] more common than than cigarette
[1:20:16] it's everywhere cocaine is nothing kids
[1:20:19] they're dealing cocaine so one of the
[1:20:20] problems is drugs
[1:20:23] people are addicted so people are on the
[1:20:25] streets and god knows his children
[1:20:28] regardless of where they are the lord
[1:20:29] can allow the enemy to create a contrast
[1:20:32] take them to the deepest of hell
[1:20:34] put whatever spread drugs prostitution
[1:20:37] god will bring them back
[1:20:38] because he's the one who created lucifer
[1:20:41] just to create those contrasts
[1:20:43] so this
[1:20:44] brother and his wife uh separated and
[1:20:46] the brother went this way
[1:20:49] and the wife and the kids went another
[1:20:50] way but these two little girls lucy um
[1:20:53] luciana 11 year old girl
[1:20:56] took upon herself to fast the whole day
[1:20:59] with a younger sister
[1:21:00] so they fasted
[1:21:02] prayed without food with our water
[1:21:04] and praying their lord
[1:21:06] bring our father and our mother together
[1:21:10] 11 year old and 9 years
[1:21:13] who told you god cannot use children
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:18] and they prayed and the lord gave those
[1:21:20] kids the desires of their heart
[1:21:22] their father came back
[1:21:24] and then when he came back brother
[1:21:25] gabriel met them on the streets and give
[1:21:27] the word to them they receive the word
[1:21:29] they've got baptized in fact they
[1:21:31] rededicate their marriage just a couple
[1:21:33] of weeks ago
[1:21:34] and luciana wanted to be baptized and a
[1:21:37] little girl no they all that all that
[1:21:38] want to be baptized
[1:21:40] so two girls pray stood in the gap
[1:21:42] and the lord restored their parents back
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:52] glory hallelujah let's go to the next
[1:21:54] slide
[1:21:56] yes that is brother and those brothers
[1:21:58] and this is a service on the sunday and
[1:22:01] these people are all the people that
[1:22:03] they got from the streets and they do
[1:22:04] have home services and we had a prayer
[1:22:07] that was not a sunday that was the
[1:22:09] monday we had a prayer sorry questions
[1:22:12] and answers
[1:22:13] and i was just marveling how little kids
[1:22:15] could ask spiritual questions it was
[1:22:17] just amazing let's go to the next slide
[1:22:20] please
[1:22:21] this is brother gabriel
[1:22:23] his wife sister carolina and his father
[1:22:25] we call him a grandpa archangel he said
[1:22:28] he's archangel gabriel you know i'll
[1:22:30] share his testimony this is 88 birthday
[1:22:33] and the first time i went that was the
[1:22:35] same of this the last december
[1:22:38] his father is a staunch catholic and
[1:22:41] he's a jewish white if you know the
[1:22:42] jesuit is one of the highest order of
[1:22:43] the catholic they are more like the
[1:22:45] freemasons
[1:22:46] so gabriel said when i received a
[1:22:48] message my dad said i have two sons and
[1:22:50] one of the worst thing that happened to
[1:22:52] me is one of my children has become my
[1:22:54] son has become a christian and we mostly
[1:22:57] a minister
[1:22:58] so his father has got nothing to do with
[1:23:00] the gospel but when i went last time
[1:23:03] he speaks english he speaks german
[1:23:05] he's lived in the u.s and germany before
[1:23:08] so we chat and one thing i realized that
[1:23:11] some time many people when you're
[1:23:13] witnessing
[1:23:14] don't just go straight to the gospel
[1:23:16] be a human being
[1:23:20] find common grounds things that you
[1:23:22] relate to as human beings
[1:23:24] and then the pillar of fire will move
[1:23:26] away for you
[1:23:27] so when jesus christ met the lady at the
[1:23:30] same area on the other well
[1:23:32] he didn't just talk about the gospel he
[1:23:34] didn't first talk about the gospel he
[1:23:35] said give me water
[1:23:37] you know that's an easy thing to do give
[1:23:38] me water because you're in the world and
[1:23:40] through that he was descending the holy
[1:23:41] ghost was paving away
[1:23:43] and hoping the lady began to talk and as
[1:23:45] they were talking
[1:23:46] the lord the peel of fire open the door
[1:23:49] where jesus christ could channel in and
[1:23:50] give the gospel
[1:23:52] so be a human face don't just bombard
[1:23:54] people with repent the coming of the
[1:23:56] lord is here change your life repent no
[1:23:59] sometimes it doesn't work
[1:24:01] you push them away just be a human being
[1:24:04] greet them talk to them and you'll find
[1:24:06] a common grounds
[1:24:08] and it works well even in interview when
[1:24:10] you go for interviewing don't be nervous
[1:24:12] just look at common grounds
[1:24:15] sometimes people have talked to the
[1:24:16] people before you when they've talked to
[1:24:18] people they are bored so they don't want
[1:24:19] to hear about you or sometimes your long
[1:24:21] resume and stuff like that
[1:24:23] look at something that you find in
[1:24:24] common
[1:24:25] maybe you've lived in certain places
[1:24:27] before oh i used to live in new york
[1:24:28] really i was in new york i'm an athlete
[1:24:31] i run you run too amazing it's no longer
[1:24:33] interviewing now you take control over
[1:24:35] the interview
[1:24:36] so sometime what i do is that you talk
[1:24:38] and open a channel open it away and they
[1:24:40] go there and now you detect the
[1:24:42] interview they don't interview you
[1:24:44] anymore they just you know what
[1:24:46] we want you here
[1:24:48] so
[1:24:49] so in giving the gospel be a human first
[1:24:52] and then the lord will pave the way
[1:24:54] don't go on the emotion and just bombard
[1:24:56] people with repent repent repent
[1:24:58] sometime it doesn't work sometime it
[1:25:00] works sometimes it doesn't
[1:25:02] let's go to the next um oh so back to
[1:25:04] you by the gabriel's father
[1:25:06] sorry see right there when i went last
[1:25:09] time so he spoke a new only and only one
[1:25:11] word in germany good morgan which is
[1:25:13] good morning that's all i know so we
[1:25:16] talked german we talk english and we
[1:25:18] chat
[1:25:19] and uh but gabriel was in the room he
[1:25:21] translated the message from english to
[1:25:23] spanish so he's working in i was talking
[1:25:25] to his dad we were chatting and i asked
[1:25:26] him can i pray for you he said sure
[1:25:29] we prayed and then he was giving double
[1:25:31] and triple a mean amen amen i mean i
[1:25:33] mean glory are yours and but the
[1:25:35] gibberish said brother quick what did
[1:25:37] you do to my dad
[1:25:39] i said this one is a jesuit he doesn't
[1:25:41] like
[1:25:42] nothing for the gospel he doesn't hear
[1:25:44] it
[1:25:45] so this time again we went and
[1:25:48] give him the word we chat on the gospel
[1:25:50] pray for him but the greatest brother i
[1:25:52] think if you if you stay there for too
[1:25:54] long my dad is going to get converted
[1:25:58] and as i said we believe that so that
[1:26:00] was his father the lord loves you our
[1:26:02] loved ones
[1:26:03] the lord do not let you pray for
[1:26:04] somebody to be converted preach and then
[1:26:07] your loved ones will go to the origin of
[1:26:09] the lost no
[1:26:10] the lord before you you thought about
[1:26:12] praying for your loved ones he already
[1:26:14] thought about them before
[1:26:16] he's just
[1:26:18] meandering through you and doing the
[1:26:19] works of salvation amen let's go to the
[1:26:22] next place
[1:26:24] yes this is another city from fusagasu
[1:26:27] that's where by the gabriel is we went
[1:26:29] to
[1:26:30] this place is called santa mal santa
[1:26:32] marta which which means saint martha
[1:26:35] and that is a dominant colored people so
[1:26:37] this is brother franklin but a gabriel
[1:26:40] and a new believer brother lewis we went
[1:26:41] to the hotel we got around
[1:26:43] 12 midnight
[1:26:45] and we we we sat at a hotel lobby and
[1:26:48] fellowship for three and a half hours
[1:26:51] it was just
[1:26:53] the lord in the missing speaking and
[1:26:55] doing things and testimony the brothers
[1:26:57] were crying and and give us we need to
[1:27:00] go and sleep we've got to start
[1:27:03] the word of the lord tomorrow and just
[1:27:05] restart another topic and just talking
[1:27:06] about the lord so 3am and i remember i
[1:27:09] went to bed around 5 a.m got up around
[1:27:11] 9.
[1:27:13] just keep going
[1:27:14] so it was wonderful and this place they
[1:27:16] don't really have a message church
[1:27:18] and so this brother has got a
[1:27:20] congregation brother franklin in his
[1:27:21] house
[1:27:22] and we're telling that brother i think
[1:27:23] it's high time you have to make it a
[1:27:25] full-blown church because the lord is
[1:27:26] using you let's go to the next
[1:27:29] slide
[1:27:30] this is santa marta beach so you may ask
[1:27:33] preacher man what were you doing at the
[1:27:35] beach
[1:27:37] well
[1:27:38] what's your mission at the beach all
[1:27:39] right i'll tell you hold your breath
[1:27:44] glory hallelujah so the brothers were
[1:27:46] telling us that they have nice
[1:27:48] around so they want to take us there so
[1:27:49] okay that works you know after preaching
[1:27:51] we need to just you know release tension
[1:27:54] and get all the stress out you know be
[1:27:55] human being so we went
[1:27:58] but the lord had a greater purpose than
[1:27:59] what we were thinking
[1:28:00] so we went and i was exhausted tiredness
[1:28:03] was wasn't it i just like want to lay
[1:28:05] down and sleep that was
[1:28:07] i was surrounded i was exhausted so we
[1:28:09] were there and you know and me and
[1:28:11] brother gabriel they put us there and
[1:28:13] they went back and then we're there
[1:28:15] walking around and by the gabriel we
[1:28:17] found two ladies they were talking
[1:28:19] giving testimony and we went to sit down
[1:28:21] around them
[1:28:22] and then they were talking about the
[1:28:23] gabriel listen and they were listening
[1:28:25] and i was actually sitting
[1:28:27] on the floor
[1:28:29] just leaning against the street because
[1:28:31] i was so
[1:28:32] tired
[1:28:33] so we were listening to them and i was
[1:28:35] not even paying too much attention
[1:28:37] and i the sister was giving some
[1:28:39] testimony very powerful testimony to her
[1:28:41] friend
[1:28:42] and she had a disabled son so we're
[1:28:44] talking and
[1:28:45] we're chipping in their conversation and
[1:28:47] started talking to them
[1:28:49] and we prayed with them and they
[1:28:51] received the word of the lord i to their
[1:28:53] numbers i connect them with but gabriel
[1:28:55] in fact i started there about three
[1:28:57] months ago about prayers with
[1:28:59] the hispanic people in some of them from
[1:29:01] mexico colombia bolivia
[1:29:04] ecuador paraguay in different countries
[1:29:07] and they have joined in and i've sent a
[1:29:09] church book
[1:29:11] word document form to them brother
[1:29:13] gabriel
[1:29:14] i'm in connected with them and invite
[1:29:16] them for their services in fact they
[1:29:17] believe their word and the lord is
[1:29:19] working in them so we are praying that
[1:29:21] the brother will set a check that those
[1:29:22] two sisters can go to church actually
[1:29:25] so so let's let's say the lord will put
[1:29:28] you a place that you didn't want to go
[1:29:30] the lord let the prophet took a seek a
[1:29:32] cigarette is a cigarette right
[1:29:34] right just to have a same one uh thank
[1:29:36] thinking mass
[1:29:38] falter
[1:29:39] right let's go to the next slide
[1:29:42] yeah so i'm going to give you a little
[1:29:43] prelude before this uh brother quentin
[1:29:46] junior where you are god bless my
[1:29:48] brother when sister vegeta invited us

[1:29:56] places is it is it the lord call you to
[1:29:59] do or you just love to go there and say
[1:30:01] brother you are taking my sermon
[1:30:04] i'm gonna i'm to call on you to preach
[1:30:05] if i tell you why
[1:30:08] god bless you by the quentin junior so
[1:30:10] i was in there let me go back to the uh
[1:30:12] the story i was working in walgreen 2009
[1:30:16] and then there were a lot of puerto
[1:30:18] rican elderly ladies there they speak
[1:30:21] perfect english but then when they come
[1:30:23] to pick their prescription they they ask
[1:30:25] me can i speak to somebody who speaks
[1:30:27] spanish
[1:30:28] and most of my hispanic co-workers used
[1:30:30] to work in the morning at a pharmacy and
[1:30:32] they go to their second job so in the
[1:30:34] afternoon when they come to
[1:30:36] pick their prescription there was nobody
[1:30:37] there to translate spanish
[1:30:40] and then so i was i have to call my
[1:30:41] manager and
[1:30:43] call them sometimes it takes like five
[1:30:44] minutes so i decided to know what i need
[1:30:46] to learn some spanish so i asked but i
[1:30:49] will say the first spanish i learned was
[1:30:51] su medicina esta estella listed manana
[1:30:54] your education will be ready tomorrow
[1:30:58] so so i pick one and then i it made my
[1:31:00] job a little easy so i decided you know
[1:31:02] what i think i have to go further to get
[1:31:04] a book and learn so i went to barnes and
[1:31:06] noble and bought me this book
[1:31:08] five minutes in spanish
[1:31:10] and so i bought this book with a cd and
[1:31:12] i came out of the
[1:31:14] the bookshop and i was just flipping
[1:31:16] through the books and a voice a strong
[1:31:18] voice came you will be dealing with
[1:31:21] hispanic people someday
[1:31:23] i said well lord if it's you it will
[1:31:24] happen if it's not you it's just a voice
[1:31:27] so i just continue my life
[1:31:29] and then i landed in san antonio texas
[1:31:32] 2010
[1:31:34] that is when the whole thing began to
[1:31:35] unravel
[1:31:36] a lot san antonio is about 65 percent
[1:31:39] hispanics mexican because they share
[1:31:41] they are closely about el paso and
[1:31:44] ego pass and warehouse and in nuevo
[1:31:47] laredo
[1:31:48] laurel texas they are bordered to mexico
[1:31:51] in fact most of the lands are mexican
[1:31:53] land yes body from mexico
[1:31:55] so there was a time the lord put upon my
[1:31:57] heart to pray
[1:31:59] what i was praying about and why i was
[1:32:00] praying brother smiley i didn't know
[1:32:03] a thing why i was praying it was about a
[1:32:06] span of about two months
[1:32:07] all i do was go to comanche park after
[1:32:10] work even sundays after first service we
[1:32:12] used to have two services in between the
[1:32:14] first and second service i go to the
[1:32:16] park and go and pray and pray and pray
[1:32:19] it's all of my heart why i didn't know
[1:32:21] i'll just pray
[1:32:23] so right after that
[1:32:24] a brother approached me one time said
[1:32:26] brother i feel it in my heart to invite
[1:32:28] you to mexico to preach i said well
[1:32:29] let's pray and if it's the will of the
[1:32:31] lord so we prayed and i go with her
[1:32:33] brother to the same word to pray command
[1:32:36] checkpoint comanche is a
[1:32:38] word from the old indians means enemy go
[1:32:41] to the enemy grounds and possess your
[1:32:43] inheritance
[1:32:44] so
[1:32:45] i went to the brother and he goes to one
[1:32:47] side and i go to one side we pray
[1:32:49] whoever finish first we have a trail
[1:32:51] come and wait for me here so we prayed
[1:32:53] and now the lord put upon my heart so
[1:32:55] strongly to go so my first trip we went
[1:32:57] to a mexico
[1:32:59] and before then i remember one of the
[1:33:01] prayers the lord told me that he was
[1:33:03] going to do something supernatural in
[1:33:05] mexico my very first trip so i remember
[1:33:08] my co-worker said a friend never we
[1:33:10] couldn't go out there i was born in
[1:33:12] mexico but i will never even get to the
[1:33:14] border let alone going to mexico because
[1:33:17] it's very bad out there some of my
[1:33:19] co-workers were crying even some
[1:33:20] believers say brother your color and the
[1:33:23] car you are going with
[1:33:24] the cartels that's what they want i said
[1:33:26] well if the lord put something on your
[1:33:27] head it's a different story amen
[1:33:30] not that i was a brave person but when
[1:33:32] the lord imbibed something in your heart
[1:33:34] it's just you can't help it it's not you
[1:33:36] it's the lord
[1:33:37] so the first trip i went
[1:33:40] let's go to the next scripture please
[1:33:43] the first trip i went
[1:33:45] i met this
[1:33:46] elderly man is called pastor pedro he's
[1:33:48] going to be with the lord i think he was
[1:33:50] 85 but when i met him 2011 he was 77
[1:33:54] and i was my house in ghana number is
[1:33:56] 877
[1:33:58] and when i was going one brother gave me
[1:34:00] an offering he went to he got married to
[1:34:02] a mexican and he went to minister in a
[1:34:05] they called san luis potosi they gave
[1:34:06] him an offer of 77 pesos said brother
[1:34:09] i'm not going to use this money in the
[1:34:10] u.s so go and want to go give it to the
[1:34:13] minister so i had 77 pesos with me
[1:34:16] pastor pedro was 77
[1:34:18] and i was
[1:34:19] my house in ghana was 877 so
[1:34:22] when i went the pastor said i think it
[1:34:24] was friday said brother you're not going
[1:34:26] to preach tonight
[1:34:27] we're going to share testimonies so all
[1:34:29] the almost all the church came to his
[1:34:30] house and said brother
[1:34:32] i think a couple so many years ago i
[1:34:35] told the law that i wanted him to send
[1:34:37] one of my colleague brothers from
[1:34:39] us forever to come in i mean visit me
[1:34:42] but i'm a poor man i'll never be able to
[1:34:44] i don't speak english
[1:34:45] and i'll never be able to go to us to
[1:34:48] see
[1:34:48] my colored brothers or to africa but i
[1:34:50] want a lot to send me
[1:34:52] a minister before i leave this earth he
[1:34:54] said i prayed for many years i think
[1:34:55] brother joseph brahma and
[1:34:58] billie paul abraham went there they gave
[1:35:00] him contact to many ministers said
[1:35:01] brother i contacted them and never went
[1:35:03] nobody visited but two weeks before you
[1:35:06] came he goes to mountains to pray those
[1:35:08] plain monterey they call the city of
[1:35:09] mountains and ramos arrested just closed
[1:35:12] there and he said i go to the mountains
[1:35:14] to pray
[1:35:15] and it's a very he was a very spiritual
[1:35:17] man the lord showed him vision said i
[1:35:19] saw you exactly two weeks ago your face
[1:35:21] and everything the lord revealed you to
[1:35:23] me i knew you two weeks before you came
[1:35:25] here
[1:35:27] and you are the uh the answer to my
[1:35:29] question and he shared with me a lot of
[1:35:31] things so
[1:35:33] we prayed for that we did prayer and we
[1:35:35] ministered i think his wife had a broken
[1:35:37] arm we prayed for him just the evening
[1:35:39] she was sitting at the back
[1:35:41] praising the lord
[1:35:42] so i prayed sorry i ministered and then
[1:35:45] me and brother david this is his
[1:35:47] son-in-law it's called juan flores and
[1:35:49] then i we came back to us
[1:35:51] about a month and a half one brother
[1:35:54] he's called he's a voice of god
[1:35:55] representative called francisco uh
[1:35:58] francisco vera montes he came to become
[1:36:00] a very good friend of mine so he came to
[1:36:02] san antonio and said brother i want to
[1:36:04] show you something when you came to
[1:36:06] ramos a respite to preach
[1:36:08] one brother ricardo took a picture with
[1:36:10] his cell phone
[1:36:11] and this is what
[1:36:13] was on the surface go to the next slide
[1:36:14] please
[1:36:16] is that this is what appeared on the
[1:36:17] cell phone a fire coming from your mouth
[1:36:20] and a light on your chest and i could
[1:36:22] remember that the lord showed me that
[1:36:24] in san antonio before i went
[1:36:27] so the lord is here with us amen
[1:36:30] the same god that was with our our
[1:36:33] eldest of old the prophet the women of
[1:36:36] god william abraham paul
[1:36:39] hannah sarah mary the same pill of fire
[1:36:42] is in you amen glory hallelujah and i've
[1:36:46] seen the simple of fire
[1:36:48] in me one night in san antonio in a
[1:36:50] dream
[1:36:51] a demon was coming to attack me at a
[1:36:53] very high velocity and before i could
[1:36:55] wake up and pray i saw a roundish ball
[1:36:57] of fire coming out of my chest
[1:37:00] going to father spirit i didn't have to
[1:37:01] wake up i didn't pray i didn't call
[1:37:03] jesus
[1:37:04] and that was it
[1:37:06] and i've seen in ghana where i was born
[1:37:09] i used to pray we used to go to hospital
[1:37:11] when i was in cali to go to the hospital
[1:37:12] pray for the sick and one night i
[1:37:14] designed a spirit on a lady and i caught
[1:37:16] and spread out and the lord told me that
[1:37:18] you're gonna have an attack
[1:37:19] so i knew i went back to my campus
[1:37:21] and a spirit came speaking in in a
[1:37:24] language clear english i am going to
[1:37:26] kill you
[1:37:27] and i was fast asleep and i saw another
[1:37:30] being
[1:37:31] coming from me at an angle of 45 degrees
[1:37:34] saying how can i die and desperate that
[1:37:36] being
[1:37:37] the true you amen
[1:37:39] you might not see physically with this
[1:37:40] eyes
[1:37:41] but there's a being in you
[1:37:43] and that being is the lord jesus christ
[1:37:47] he's the captain of who's that fight
[1:37:48] your battle amen do you know some people
[1:37:51] die in their sleep
[1:37:52] and you never know they knew that battle
[1:37:54] they went through
[1:37:56] desperate the demons attacked people in
[1:37:58] the night demons even attacked children
[1:38:00] sometimes children will cry and cry and
[1:38:03] nothing could pacify them
[1:38:05] food mother's breast smoke nothing it's
[1:38:07] a spiritual attack and you have to pray
[1:38:09] for the child
[1:38:10] so the devil comes in different forms to
[1:38:12] attack that is his duty to to steal your
[1:38:15] joy to steal what we plant to steal your
[1:38:18] virtues to steal your peace and to
[1:38:21] destroy and to kill you
[1:38:23] but thank god jesus christ came to give
[1:38:25] what
[1:38:26] life eternal and give it an abundance
[1:38:29] amen glory hallelujah
[1:38:32] so now let's go to
[1:38:34] i think i made some okay
[1:38:36] let's go to the next one yes now let's i
[1:38:39] want to pick the main salmon and i trust
[1:38:41] you just round it
[1:38:46] we won't keep it long amen
[1:38:48] we want to we're speaking on restoration
[1:38:51] by transformation and want to start with
[1:38:54] dimensional analysis
[1:38:56] i think some of you might be engineers
[1:38:57] and computer
[1:38:59] scientists are you going to teach
[1:39:01] is it in science in calculus no
[1:39:05] the natura is a top of the spiritual
[1:39:07] amen we want to analyze the
[1:39:10] dimension we want to have a basis of
[1:39:13] restoration all right
[1:39:15] if you want to restore something then
[1:39:17] there's something sure
[1:39:18] what you want to research you have been
[1:39:20] in a position
[1:39:21] where it's not there at this time so
[1:39:23] before we could be restored we have to
[1:39:25] find out where we were before
[1:39:27] and what this launch is to our current
[1:39:29] position and how can we be restored amen
[1:39:33] so
[1:39:35] let's look at quickly i analyze the
[1:39:37] dimension the realms that we are living
[1:39:39] in what is the dimension
[1:39:43] the physical atmosphere that we see here
[1:39:44] is a dimension let's go back to the
[1:39:46] slide oh sorry
[1:39:49] the physical atmosphere is the space
[1:39:51] that we live in
[1:39:53] the universe
[1:39:54] you can travel go beyond the earth go to
[1:39:56] moon go to the stars they are universe
[1:39:59] beyond what you can imagine
[1:40:01] so that is the first dimension we call
[1:40:03] it a
[1:40:04] space universe is the dimension of
[1:40:06] occupancy place of existence
[1:40:09] so the volume that we occupy is the
[1:40:11] first dimension because the lord
[1:40:14] wants to teach us from break things down
[1:40:16] when you go to medical school they do
[1:40:19] dissection they dissect even human
[1:40:21] beings dissect animals now before they
[1:40:24] started the guinea pig it was a whole
[1:40:26] guinea pig one
[1:40:27] but for you to study and to know the
[1:40:29] intricacies of the
[1:40:30] anatomy of of the of the guinea pig they
[1:40:33] have to break it down amen
[1:40:35] god bless you
[1:40:36] you are right there in the channel
[1:40:38] the frequency break it down to learn it
[1:40:41] but when you when you finish you're not
[1:40:42] going to treat them in isolation you're
[1:40:44] going to treat a human being
[1:40:45] and i remember where i work in
[1:40:49] uh wellington hospital the doctors tell
[1:40:52] the junior doctors that when you go to
[1:40:53] the patient is that some of you are
[1:40:55] trained in a computer age so you don't
[1:40:57] admit you don't use your mind
[1:40:59] look at the patient
[1:41:00] it's going to give you a clue don't just
[1:41:02] look at numbers and his potassium and
[1:41:04] numbers look at the whole patients look
[1:41:07] at how he looks like you're gonna see a
[1:41:09] picture of what is going on and then you
[1:41:11] start from there don't look at not don't
[1:41:13] use computer don't be a computer doctor
[1:41:15] so now you want to be a reductase and
[1:41:18] see what the problem came in so the
[1:41:19] first dimension is peace second
[1:41:21] dimension is what the matter the earth
[1:41:24] the terrestrial that we live in whatever
[1:41:25] you can touch your human body the
[1:41:27] building the concrete
[1:41:29] is air gas is solid they are all part of
[1:41:32] the second dimension the third dimension
[1:41:34] is time as we know now we have two types
[1:41:37] of time we have eternal manifestation of
[1:41:40] god and then we have uh tempera
[1:41:43] attributes be manifested in time
[1:41:46] so time is what we are living in now we
[1:41:48] are preaching so we are in eterna time
[1:41:50] now eternal manifestation somebody's on
[1:41:52] drugs somebody's fighting somebody's
[1:41:55] chasing somebody's again what's going on
[1:41:57] isn't a temper attribute he's also in
[1:41:59] time but not an eternal attribute
[1:42:01] attribute he's living in temporary
[1:42:03] attributes
[1:42:04] then the fourth dimension is
[1:42:06] communication or science what the ether
[1:42:08] was the computers that we use the
[1:42:10] broadband the internet the radio
[1:42:13] worldwide
[1:42:14] whatever web and what have you they are
[1:42:17] all part of the fourth dimension it's a
[1:42:19] dimension where the the lord uses it
[1:42:22] the devil uses it human beings uses it
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:27] michael jackson used microphone
[1:42:29] to project what was in him
[1:42:31] ever specially used microphone to
[1:42:33] project what is him but a jagdaff uses
[1:42:36] microphone to project a christ in him
[1:42:38] but using microphone to project what is
[1:42:41] in him so is a christ in you that makes
[1:42:44] a difference
[1:42:45] amen we use science we use science it's
[1:42:47] all over
[1:42:48] people are listening in online is true
[1:42:50] science is the fourth dimension but we
[1:42:53] are using it for eternal manifestation
[1:42:55] eternal benefit
[1:42:56] amen
[1:42:57] now let's look at the dimension of
[1:42:59] contrast the fifth dimension that is
[1:43:02] where it all began amen that is satan we
[1:43:05] can call it satan lucifer dimension of
[1:43:08] contrast is the fountain of all
[1:43:10] temporary thoughts it's death it's hell
[1:43:13] demons where the origin of the laws
[1:43:15] agony suffering disease was please
[1:43:18] cancer was
[1:43:20] just name it it's just dimension of evil
[1:43:24] torment unbelief doubt is death grief
[1:43:28] i mean you can go on and describe it and
[1:43:31] that is this dimension don't live in
[1:43:32] isolation they live in human beings
[1:43:37] and the the the other diamond let's go
[1:43:39] on the sixth dimension is the celestial
[1:43:41] dimension
[1:43:42] it's a dimension of peace
[1:43:45] it's heaven
[1:43:46] it's where the saints live
[1:43:48] is the logos
[1:43:49] is the theophany is the angels where the
[1:43:51] origin where the angels are is the
[1:43:53] origin of the redeemed is where you are
[1:43:55] now sins of god
[1:43:57] is the pill of fire is the pillar of
[1:43:59] light is the lake of fire the look of
[1:44:01] fire is just the holy ghost
[1:44:03] one is consuming the devil we call the
[1:44:05] lake of fire what else can consume the
[1:44:07] devil is the lord himself
[1:44:10] is the same holy ghost that consumed the
[1:44:11] devil in me and consumed the devil in
[1:44:13] you that is destroying the enemy satan
[1:44:16] that he will never exist no more
[1:44:19] amen then the seventh dimension is
[1:44:22] elohim
[1:44:23] we say god himself
[1:44:25] christ with his eternal attribute in him
[1:44:27] they thought their mind realm their
[1:44:29] thought ram before he began to even
[1:44:31] express their such dimension it was a
[1:44:34] thought and the thought of god is not
[1:44:36] like my thought and your thought the
[1:44:38] thought of god is real
[1:44:40] that's why when job was going through
[1:44:41] the trials he was going through amnesia
[1:44:44] and the lord tried to remind him job
[1:44:46] where were you
[1:44:47] when the sons and daughters of god sunk
[1:44:49] in glory
[1:44:50] so before you came to his mother's room
[1:44:52] god god blessed were the jack for your
[1:44:54] scriptures
[1:44:55] jeremiah before i formed you i know you
[1:44:58] baby josue before you were formed the
[1:45:00] almighty knew you and ordained you to be
[1:45:02] a prophet to be a preacher amen before
[1:45:05] you were born before even you knew what
[1:45:07] is causing
[1:45:08] you existed you didn't exist with gray
[1:45:10] hairs no you didn't exist as a baby but
[1:45:13] you resisted between like age of 18 to
[1:45:15] 22.
[1:45:17] young beautiful young men beautiful
[1:45:18] young lady your teeth white as crystal
[1:45:21] your eyes shining like the sun and that
[1:45:24] was a brilliancy of christ
[1:45:26] but now for us to experience redemption
[1:45:28] they needed to be this con the fifth
[1:45:30] dimension to bring their contrast
[1:45:33] amen
[1:45:34] the lord manifested this attribute okay
[1:45:36] i have another name finished the eighth
[1:45:38] dimension say where did you get it from
[1:45:40] eight dimension
[1:45:42] that is a good old pentecostal music

[1:46:21] to give the pentecostal people credit
[1:46:23] for one good thing many of them there's
[1:46:26] one good thing is those real good
[1:46:28] old-fashioned songs it just takes you
[1:46:31] out somewhere in fourth fifth sixth
[1:46:35] seventh and eighth dimensions somewhere
[1:46:37] wherever it is out where god lives amen
[1:46:41] and this morning we went to the eight
[1:46:43] dimension uh brother brother capes and
[1:46:45] sister sister tina and the singers and
[1:46:48] the instrumentalists you two guessed
[1:46:50] those dimension

[1:46:53] eternity in us eternity in manifestation
[1:46:57] glory hallelujah
[1:47:01] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[1:47:03] go back
[1:47:10] our lord is marvelous
[1:47:13] glory to the lord so back to
[1:47:15] go back to uh back to the dimension
[1:47:18] now the lord had his eternal attribute
[1:47:20] in him want to just within two or five
[1:47:22] minutes
[1:47:23] find out where we were before
[1:47:25] and how we ended here
[1:47:28] how sin came in and why sin came in
[1:47:30] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:32] we were in the mind of god the man of
[1:47:34] god is not a human mind
[1:47:36] the mind of god is real in other words
[1:47:38] it's a real existence of real human
[1:47:41] beings but not human beings with with a
[1:47:44] blood system but human beings with the
[1:47:47] holy ghost amen
[1:47:49] when you live here you're going to still
[1:47:50] be a human being you're not going to be
[1:47:52] an angels with wings no you're still
[1:47:54] going to maintain your human form
[1:47:56] your human shape your nose your eyes
[1:47:59] you're not going to have gray hairs no
[1:48:01] you're not going to be a baby you're
[1:48:02] going to be like 18 years to 20 years
[1:48:05] old but that's that was what you were
[1:48:07] before the foundation of the world but
[1:48:09] without an earthly experience
[1:48:12] you didn't know what sin was no
[1:48:14] sickness
[1:48:16] child having a fever and headache he
[1:48:17] never existed
[1:48:19] so we needed to come to earth
[1:48:21] to manifest those temper
[1:48:24] eternal attributes and for us to
[1:48:26] manifest those eternal attribute the
[1:48:28] lord
[1:48:29] had to bring a contrast
[1:48:31] and that contrast was lucifer
[1:48:34] he was created as one of the angels
[1:48:36] and he had all the power and the glory
[1:48:38] of the lord
[1:48:39] but in him was coded all the tempera
[1:48:42] thought of the lord in him was to bring
[1:48:44] forth sin remember sin is what srn satan
[1:48:48] in your nature
[1:48:49] in him was we're supposed to come with
[1:48:51] the spoken word of the lord come just
[1:48:53] like jesus come like adam
[1:48:56] be born by the word as people have been
[1:48:58] born this morning but now for the
[1:48:59] contrast
[1:49:01] contrasting satan came in to bring
[1:49:04] birth through what sex
[1:49:06] scx satan if cross that is what satan
[1:49:11] introduced to the human race and the
[1:49:13] lord permitted it that's what is called
[1:49:14] the permissive will of god
[1:49:17] god permitted for 46 000 7 000 years but
[1:49:21] is so not eternal purpose of god
[1:49:24] that's why human beings are born a
[1:49:25] certain time and we die a certain time
[1:49:28] because it's still the temperature of
[1:49:30] god it's not a tenor but then before the
[1:49:33] himala midakuda was created there was a
[1:49:36] human being who cannot die
[1:49:38] who couldn't die
[1:49:40] and he's the one that we are being
[1:49:41] restored to right now amen
[1:49:44] they say being in you there's a
[1:49:46] supernatural being in you beside your
[1:49:48] earthly realm that is the true you and
[1:49:50] that is where the lord wants us to
[1:49:52] operate from
[1:49:53] many times we will pray from the human
[1:49:54] spirit the human realm when there's a
[1:49:57] situation we quickly look at the
[1:49:59] situation we're going to cry like jack
[1:50:01] said that we're going to doubt the lord
[1:50:02] but the lord overrides our own belief
[1:50:04] and doubts and he goes forward to what
[1:50:06] manifests what he's ordained to manifest
[1:50:09] amen because you know the fragility of
[1:50:11] your human frame that you're a human
[1:50:13] being amen so you override our own
[1:50:16] beliefs and our doubts and our thoughts
[1:50:18] and our limitations and he goes on to
[1:50:20] manifest his word elaborate i said we
[1:50:22] eat our weight back amen the lord will
[1:50:25] let you know that he's god
[1:50:27] and he has you in his hands nothing can
[1:50:29] take you from his hands amen and you
[1:50:32] cannot even take yourself out of the
[1:50:33] hands of the lord
[1:50:35] it doesn't matter how far you can go
[1:50:37] your name is written in the palms of his
[1:50:40] hands
[1:50:40] [Applause]
[1:50:42] it doesn't matter how far the word will
[1:50:44] take you to
[1:50:45] the code the genetic code eternal code
[1:50:47] is in you
[1:50:49] you can go sing so low to the deepest of
[1:50:51] hell there you hear the voice of god
[1:50:54] sounding
[1:50:55] amen glory hallelujah to the lord so a
[1:50:58] child of god is a child of god so the
[1:51:00] contrast came in
[1:51:02] to bring the loss we came into sin and
[1:51:05] quickly the law became a redeemer in
[1:51:07] fact before the lord descended adam
[1:51:10] begin to exhibit the attribute of
[1:51:12] redemption
[1:51:13] he tried to clothe himself and his wife
[1:51:16] with what with fig leaves that was a
[1:51:18] type of christ clothing you an eye with
[1:51:21] the holy ghost baptism amen he did in
[1:51:24] the natural which couldn't do it
[1:51:26] your human mind cannot do it but you
[1:51:28] need the holy ghost baptism jesus
[1:51:30] preaches someone ye
[1:51:33] must be born again
[1:51:36] the new breath
[1:51:37] takes away delete the fifth dimension
[1:51:40] out of your frame
[1:51:42] and i begin to operate all the
[1:51:44] dimensions are part of you
[1:51:46] but this one is not the eternal part of
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:49] we got we inherited that because we were
[1:51:51] born through sex because we came through
[1:51:53] the civilization of satan
[1:51:55] but god for knew you before the
[1:51:57] foundation of the world we came through
[1:51:58] amnesia where we forgot our identity but
[1:52:01] the pillar of fire didn't forget you and
[1:52:04] the right time at appointed time he
[1:52:06] calls you by by your name amen and
[1:52:09] brings you back to who you are
[1:52:11] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:52:18] the lord he is good
[1:52:24] when adam
[1:52:26] and his wife
[1:52:28] were lost and they couldn't save
[1:52:29] themselves the lord himself came
[1:52:31] killed the lamp to type christ jesus
[1:52:34] because the lord has got only one mind
[1:52:37] that is christ jesus
[1:52:39] eternity has got only one mind
[1:52:41] them that are in christ
[1:52:43] nothing can separate them from those
[1:52:45] that are in christ
[1:52:47] so he doesn't look at your condition
[1:52:48] that you are in
[1:52:49] when the lord met
[1:52:51] gideon and gideon was looking at
[1:52:53] circumstances how the media knights have
[1:52:56] overcome them and they plant their corn
[1:52:58] and wheat and they have to go in the
[1:52:59] night and with the sacks and go and
[1:53:02] harvest
[1:53:03] the corn per adventure they will
[1:53:05] encounter the midianites and the
[1:53:06] malachites
[1:53:07] and then here is gideon talking to the
[1:53:10] lord himself
[1:53:11] and he came as a human being
[1:53:13] and said lord we heard about your
[1:53:14] promises what you did in the past
[1:53:17] you did wonders in egypt but lord you
[1:53:19] have sowed us into the hand of the
[1:53:21] egyptians sorry in the hand of the
[1:53:22] midianites because of because of our sin
[1:53:25] and the lord said the almighty man of
[1:53:27] valor
[1:53:28] he didn't look at the mighty man of
[1:53:29] allah he looked like a defeated person
[1:53:32] but the lord was not looking at the
[1:53:33] circumstance of gideon he was looking at
[1:53:35] what is in gideon
[1:53:37] amen
[1:53:38] on the outside you might be as wretched
[1:53:40] as richard can be
[1:53:41] you might be as lost as lost can be but
[1:53:44] the lord is looking at the seed
[1:53:46] and the poor water and sunshine of the
[1:53:47] seed and the seed will come out of you
[1:53:50] and overtake the outward circumstances
[1:53:53] glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord
[1:53:55] was preaching to gideon the inner man
[1:53:57] gideon remember there was a time
[1:54:00] that when the law started before before
[1:54:02] man came to earth
[1:54:04] the lord had the attribute of worship
[1:54:06] in fact before the man came to earth the
[1:54:08] angels were worshipping him so that
[1:54:10] attribute was manifested but there was
[1:54:12] another attribute of redemption that was
[1:54:14] not manifested yet and the law said that
[1:54:17] who will go and open the redemption
[1:54:19] story and adam and eve says adam said
[1:54:21] lord here we are send us
[1:54:25] and they step in earth step insisting
[1:54:27] element put flesh around them and begin
[1:54:30] to manifest and we know how their sin
[1:54:32] came in their blast system and now
[1:54:34] quickly the lord began the redemption
[1:54:36] story
[1:54:37] amen there's nothing out of kitten
[1:54:38] before the lord
[1:54:40] there's nothing i can overtake the lord
[1:54:42] that the lord doesn't know that happened
[1:54:43] to you
[1:54:44] is this sickness
[1:54:46] the lord can heal it amen is it cancer
[1:54:49] yes it will be a dread to the doctors
[1:54:51] but the pill of fire can consume that
[1:54:53] crap that demon out of your life
[1:54:56] whatever sickness is in you whatever
[1:54:58] plague and woe
[1:54:59] the lord jesus christ can set you free
[1:55:02] right now
[1:55:03] only believe all things are possible
[1:55:06] just give it all to the lord amen
[1:55:08] believe in him and receive your healing
[1:55:10] don't look at your circumstance the lord
[1:55:12] doesn't see you as a sinner he's you as
[1:55:14] his daughter and as a son
[1:55:16] and when you yield yourself to him he
[1:55:18] takes away the sin out of your life
[1:55:21] amen
[1:55:22] things that you cannot do he will do it
[1:55:24] for you amen
[1:55:25] habits that you cannot overcome he
[1:55:27] overcome them for you
[1:55:29] it doesn't matter the lord jesus christ
[1:55:31] will do it for you amen glory hallelujah
[1:55:34] only believe all things are possible
[1:55:38] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:43] and that was happening in time of gideon
[1:55:45] they planted their corn that was a type
[1:55:47] of what is happening now you give birth
[1:55:49] to your child you plant the word of the
[1:55:51] lord in your children and they go to
[1:55:53] school
[1:55:54] and they uproot everything from them and
[1:55:56] they teach them to be a woman should
[1:55:58] marry a woman a man should marry a woman
[1:56:00] they teach them all kind of evil they
[1:56:02] teach them how to have sex how to test
[1:56:04] their sexuality and all kind of evil and
[1:56:06] that was what was happening in time of
[1:56:08] time of gideon but the lord jesus christ
[1:56:11] came
[1:56:12] because gideon and the sons of children
[1:56:14] of israel were
[1:56:16] were ordained to be god's children god
[1:56:18] came and defeated the amalekite and the
[1:56:21] jebusite and all the other sin it
[1:56:24] doesn't matter the demons yes we know
[1:56:27] millions of demons are on the earth and
[1:56:29] those demons are living in people trying
[1:56:32] to captivate young old babies whoever
[1:56:34] they can captivate but there's a pill of
[1:56:36] fire that is welling around glory
[1:56:39] hallelujah
[1:56:40] like a magnet that is absorbing catching
[1:56:43] his children even whilst their bodies
[1:56:45] are not falling asleep in other words
[1:56:47] before you die not when you are dead in
[1:56:49] the grief side but when you are living
[1:56:51] in your sisting element the lord is
[1:56:53] calling you speaking to your heart my
[1:56:55] daughter my son where are thou
[1:56:58] this is not where you were before the
[1:56:59] foundation of the world
[1:57:01] you to me son and daughter
[1:57:03] give your holy note to my heart to me
[1:57:05] and i'll change your heart amen and we
[1:57:08] know when gideon if you read uh judges
[1:57:11] chapter six gideon was a defeated person
[1:57:13] but judges seven
[1:57:15] gideon was fully restored and argued
[1:57:17] wasn't speaking like a defeated person
[1:57:19] anymore he wasn't look talking to
[1:57:21] circumstance but he was talking to the
[1:57:23] people that i'm going to blow trumpet
[1:57:25] and you blow after me and tell see that
[1:57:28] the sword of the lord and the sword of
[1:57:30] gideon
[1:57:31] why they saw that the lord gideon has
[1:57:33] realized
[1:57:34] christ in him juva god is his portion so
[1:57:38] there's the jehovah who was distanced
[1:57:40] from him now has become married to him
[1:57:43] he's become mr jehovah and you are
[1:57:45] message jesus christ
[1:57:46] by the holy ghost baptism do you know
[1:57:48] what is the most important thing in your
[1:57:50] life
[1:57:51] is the new breath
[1:57:52] that's why the enemy will do everything
[1:57:54] to keep you away from it you occupy you
[1:57:55] with the things of the world the devil
[1:57:57] doesn't care if you come to church it
[1:57:58] doesn't care if we're a preacher it
[1:58:00] doesn't care if we're a pastor it
[1:58:01] doesn't care if we're a prophet
[1:58:03] if we're not born again
[1:58:05] he so overcome you
[1:58:07] he can use you
[1:58:08] and that's why we have to teach the
[1:58:10] children
[1:58:11] you must be born again
[1:58:13] don't stop baptizing the name of the
[1:58:15] lord jesus christ is good and dandy but
[1:58:17] that will not do their job what to do
[1:58:19] the job is the new breath and what is
[1:58:21] the new breath is deleting the third
[1:58:23] dimension
[1:58:25] the consuming fire of god consume the
[1:58:27] nature of satan in you consume the devil
[1:58:30] literally out of you supernaturally and
[1:58:32] then they'll see that is a new pillow
[1:58:34] fire jesus christ taken over your flesh
[1:58:37] and you can see that the life that i
[1:58:38] live
[1:58:39] is no longer but that's smiley it's no
[1:58:41] longer about a jack it's no longer about
[1:58:42] a cuicu it's no longer sterica it's no
[1:58:45] longer starting now this is the cat but
[1:58:46] it is jesus christ living in you
[1:58:49] bringing his life out of me glory
[1:58:51] hallelujah and jesus christ is not
[1:58:53] limited he can raise the dead amen
[1:58:57] i've seen him raise the dead once in
[1:58:58] mexico in my own little ministry the
[1:59:00] lord is not there's nothing he can do
[1:59:03] amen
[1:59:04] i saw 18 year old boy preach
[1:59:06] in the morning i didn't have a
[1:59:07] translator so i said the pastor has so
[1:59:10] much he said brother preach and we can
[1:59:12] ask the discipline because the lord can
[1:59:14] let you you preach in english we can
[1:59:15] hear in spanish
[1:59:16] but his faith his faith was way high
[1:59:18] here and my faith was now here so i said
[1:59:20] okay let brother israel preach the young
[1:59:23] brother preached and after that the
[1:59:24] pastor's mother and father invited us to
[1:59:26] their home to give us uh we're eating
[1:59:29] dinner or lunch or something and the
[1:59:31] brother just fell
[1:59:33] see what the devil can do
[1:59:35] with food in my mouth i said what's
[1:59:37] going on here
[1:59:38] the person saw what was going on in this
[1:59:40] sea so i went to just get the food out
[1:59:41] of my mouth in the sink
[1:59:43] and
[1:59:44] the brother we started praying for the
[1:59:46] brother he called the family about 15
[1:59:48] sisters
[1:59:49] they came praying for 15 minutes
[1:59:51] he was gone the sisters stopped praying
[1:59:54] and they were crying like
[1:59:55] so bitter like never seen people crying
[1:59:57] like that before
[1:59:58] and they were sitting there they they
[2:00:00] were not even praying anymore and their
[2:00:01] brother's head was on my lap
[2:00:03] and the pastor's mother the pastor was
[2:00:05] trying to massage his chest to get some
[2:00:08] oxygen and blood into his brain and the
[2:00:09] process mother was shocking him with tao
[2:00:12] israel israel no response
[2:00:15] and i was thinking lord if it is time to
[2:00:17] go he said son of god is preaching he's
[2:00:18] a young minister he's preaching simon
[2:00:20] but if it's not it's time to go i call
[2:00:22] it spread back into him
[2:00:24] and right away the brother open his eyes
[2:00:26] and begin to look here looking at the
[2:00:28] sisters crying and mourning
[2:00:32] and he came back and we told him what
[2:00:35] what went on he didn't know what went on
[2:00:39] [Applause]
[2:00:43] the lord has given that power in you
[2:00:46] all that we need to realize it the devil
[2:00:48] is just a scared crew he's defeated but
[2:00:51] when we know our position that you are a
[2:00:53] daughter of jesus christ you are jesus
[2:00:55] christ in flesh
[2:00:56] you are message jesus christ amen and
[2:00:59] when you speak your word is not your
[2:01:01] word it's your husband speaking

[2:01:07] solomon speaking when's his terrica
[2:01:09] speech but brother jack speaking and
[2:01:11] that is the word amen and when you speak
[2:01:13] the word your husband the enforcer will
[2:01:16] enforce the word amen
[2:01:19] like esther and king are
[2:01:21] even an earthly king he wasn't a
[2:01:23] believer
[2:01:24] but the lord put upon his heart to love
[2:01:26] his people and he said esther why are
[2:01:29] you sad what is you even half of the
[2:01:31] kingdom i'll give it to you
[2:01:33] and he granted him the sword
[2:01:35] of kin ahesaros the lord is this our
[2:01:38] giving you he's already given it to you
[2:01:40] the sword of the lord and put your name
[2:01:42] there and brother solomon amen the sort
[2:01:45] of the lord and sister jemima the son of
[2:01:48] the lord and brother robles they saw
[2:01:50] that the lord and brother quentin amen
[2:01:53] and go in that might my brother my
[2:01:56] sister nothing can stand before you
[2:01:58] because you don't fight by your strength
[2:01:59] but it's he that is in you he's the one
[2:02:01] doing the fight glory hallelujah to the
[2:02:04] lord blessed be the name of the lord
[2:02:06] just like i gave a testimony in my
[2:02:08] rotation wellington were doing rounds
[2:02:11] and a lady about 70 something to 80
[2:02:13] years old was declared hopeless stage 4
[2:02:16] cancer in the in the lungs
[2:02:18] and something to me told me that
[2:02:21] no she's not her place
[2:02:22] so that the team went to the next room
[2:02:24] we were standing in front of the door
[2:02:26] and she was sleeping looking at the wall
[2:02:27] facing the wall
[2:02:29] i see there was a divine appointment
[2:02:31] when they left
[2:02:32] i pulled off my mask
[2:02:34] and she looked at me
[2:02:35] and i couldn't i didn't speak a word
[2:02:38] but he that is in me
[2:02:40] amen he that is in you
[2:02:42] i transferred the healing i transferred
[2:02:45] the power of the almighty me to the lady
[2:02:48] and she smiled we didn't have to speak i
[2:02:50] didn't have to see a word but there was
[2:02:52] a frequency that the lord channels said
[2:02:54] in that frequency the frequency of the
[2:02:56] holy ghost
[2:02:57] where all things are possible whereby
[2:02:59] they thought amen just think about it
[2:03:02] and believe it and speak it and it will
[2:03:05] be done amen
[2:03:07] glory hallelujah to the kingdom of kings
[2:03:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:03:12] that is the thought there's a coming of
[2:03:14] time as brother jack was in the squeeze
[2:03:16] even here we are being squeezed isn't it
[2:03:18] the squeeze is helping us we already
[2:03:20] have the hair returns if you are too
[2:03:22] comfortable you're going to stay here
[2:03:24] forever
[2:03:25] but when we get uncomfortable we already
[2:03:27] have our church building we have the
[2:03:29] school we have whatever we need
[2:03:32] the lord gave it to us before the
[2:03:33] foundation of the world
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:39] amen
[2:03:40] and when the lord is about to do
[2:03:41] something
[2:03:43] he created condition uncomfortable
[2:03:45] condition
[2:03:48] thank you brother
[2:03:50] uncomfortable condition for you to go
[2:03:52] into your inheritance amen
[2:03:54] remember israel they were scattered all
[2:03:57] over the world
[2:03:58] but their homeland was jerusalem
[2:04:00] naturally speaking
[2:04:01] and the lord wanted them to return to
[2:04:03] their homeland what did the lord do
[2:04:05] brought out of hitler
[2:04:07] brought a stalin brought a is what the
[2:04:10] other one are for india and all those
[2:04:11] detectives
[2:04:12] and they killed slaughtered israel and
[2:04:15] then they were forced to go back to
[2:04:16] their homeland because jews like dinero
[2:04:20] money
[2:04:21] so what will bring them it has to take
[2:04:23] something to put them back to where they
[2:04:25] belong to amen as long as they see their
[2:04:27] money they will stay with money go to
[2:04:29] wall street but the lord wanted them to
[2:04:31] take to their homeland so the lord
[2:04:33] creates uncomfortable situation in your
[2:04:35] family
[2:04:36] that there's something in you that you
[2:04:38] have not exercised
[2:04:40] there's a virtue in you that you have
[2:04:41] not put to practice just like you don't
[2:04:43] gideon never knew he was
[2:04:45] a judge he didn't know anything like
[2:04:46] being a judge he only needed trying to
[2:04:48] be a family man trying to provide for
[2:04:50] his family but it was more than just
[2:04:51] providing for his family he needed to
[2:04:53] provide for the whole israel
[2:04:55] and the lord met him at a crossroad
[2:04:58] where things were tight where he has to
[2:05:00] go in the night and when harvest the
[2:05:02] corn that he planted himself in his own
[2:05:04] land
[2:05:05] go and steal his own crops and bring it
[2:05:07] back home and feed his family
[2:05:09] and when it gets tight that is when he
[2:05:11] that is in you comes to this comes comes
[2:05:13] on display amen the holy ghost is in you
[2:05:16] amen is there all the time but then when
[2:05:19] the situation arise then the holy ghost
[2:05:21] will manifest the attributes for that
[2:05:23] day glory hallelujah
[2:05:26] let's go to the next um
[2:05:29] well let's go to the
[2:05:31] next thank you that is um fat abraham
[2:05:35] the father of faith
[2:05:37] he was restored
[2:05:38] he was abraham an adult worshipper in
[2:05:41] one of the babylonian countries
[2:05:43] but he didn't know anything about god he
[2:05:45] knew his father's idols he didn't know
[2:05:47] he was a prophet
[2:05:48] but the lord ordained him like jeremiah
[2:05:50] to be a prophet unto the nations
[2:05:53] and when the time come the lord said
[2:05:54] abraham leave your kindred and go to the
[2:05:56] land of our should not even tell him
[2:05:58] where he was going to
[2:05:59] and sometimes the lord let you let us
[2:06:01] walk by faith
[2:06:02] we may not have all the money for the
[2:06:03] building you may not have all the money
[2:06:05] that you need but you go by faith amen
[2:06:08] you speak into creation amen
[2:06:11] who created the purpose that was used to
[2:06:13] make money the trees that was used to
[2:06:15] make the dead president
[2:06:17] the dollars
[2:06:18] the lord created their trees
[2:06:20] so
[2:06:21] who created the gold the coins the lord
[2:06:23] created the metals
[2:06:26] so the lord can give you money amen if
[2:06:28] he has to renee from heaven he can do it
[2:06:30] if he has to test somebody to give it
[2:06:32] you can do it
[2:06:34] he can give you exactly what you need
[2:06:36] he can give you more than what you need
[2:06:38] and abram said that when you ask the
[2:06:40] lord something he gives you always gives
[2:06:43] you more than what you ask for
[2:06:45] [Applause]
[2:06:51] because when we measure our height we
[2:06:52] measure only our hard i'm 5 8 5 11 6
[2:06:55] foot but the lord is looking something
[2:06:57] beyond that
[2:06:58] amen you look at your finance what you
[2:07:00] have in your bank to make budget but the
[2:07:03] law doesn't look at your bank statement
[2:07:05] there's a bank statement in heaven
[2:07:07] that doesn't run dry
[2:07:09] it's like just like the ocean it's just
[2:07:11] like a little fishy drinking from the
[2:07:12] ocean
[2:07:14] it's not it's infinite smile it's not
[2:07:16] even you can't even measure you have
[2:07:17] taken nothing out of the out of the out
[2:07:19] of there out of the ocean if the lord
[2:07:21] gives you one billion it's nothing bank
[2:07:23] of heaven is the bank of heaven amen if
[2:07:26] the lord gives you ten houses it's
[2:07:28] nothing the law doesn't like the brother
[2:07:30] preacher doesn't is his company doesn't
[2:07:32] go bankrupt
[2:07:34] it's always this abundance for us
[2:07:36] and we have to ask big ask more than
[2:07:39] your job before
[2:07:40] amen
[2:07:41] if you're a son of god and you have said
[2:07:43] the lord like abraham if you are a
[2:07:45] daughter of god and you have given your
[2:07:46] life to the lord like sarah then ask for
[2:07:49] not only celestial blessing but ask for
[2:07:51] treasure blessing amen because they have
[2:07:54] all of them are for you
[2:07:55] the lord gave our father abraham he came
[2:07:57] himself when abraham you know what
[2:08:00] should always show forgiveness and
[2:08:02] she'll laugh
[2:08:04] one of the secret to god blessing is
[2:08:05] forgive it doesn't matter how somebody
[2:08:07] has hurt you your family
[2:08:10] god can let somebody closest to you hate
[2:08:12] you so bad
[2:08:13] your children your parents your pastor
[2:08:15] your minister the lord can let it happen
[2:08:18] to test what is in you
[2:08:21] are you going to leave a chat because
[2:08:22] because i step on you on your toes or by
[2:08:24] just step on your toes
[2:08:26] no you have to show forgiveness amen
[2:08:29] and when you show forgiveness that is
[2:08:31] when the big blessings come to you
[2:08:36] the lord abraham forgive his nephew
[2:08:39] what's the name lot
[2:08:40] because his blessing lord took his
[2:08:42] blessing
[2:08:44] but when lord was in trouble abraham
[2:08:46] wasn't the military man
[2:08:48] his seventh were not trained soldiers
[2:08:50] but he picked sword i don't know
[2:08:51] whatever sword that they picked but he
[2:08:53] went in the strength of elohim
[2:08:55] and went to deliver his nephew lord who
[2:08:57] has despised him
[2:08:59] and the king of sodom and brought them
[2:09:01] back and let's see who came to welcome
[2:09:03] abraham
[2:09:04] when you forgive
[2:09:05] and you leave things to the lord say
[2:09:07] brother i can't forgive let me show you
[2:09:09] how you can forgive stop praying for the
[2:09:12] person
[2:09:14] [Applause]
[2:09:18] you can never hate someone that you pray
[2:09:20] for
[2:09:23] [Applause]
[2:09:26] whatever the temptation the devil put on
[2:09:28] you preface
[2:09:30] even if we're a thief a robber
[2:09:32] who robbed with guns
[2:09:34] if i'm going to rob pray
[2:09:36] lord i'm going to rob the bank i'm going
[2:09:38] to rob chase bank or wells fargo when
[2:09:40] you pray the lord will anoint your heart
[2:09:43] and go and tell the word of the lord to
[2:09:45] wells fargo that i plan to rob you but i
[2:09:47] love you i don't want to do that
[2:09:51] the lord will change your heart
[2:09:53] amen praise changes everything
[2:09:56] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[2:09:58] the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:10:04] abraham was always praying for lot
[2:10:06] regardless of how lord treated him he
[2:10:09] loved him
[2:10:10] he wasn't looking at what allah did he
[2:10:11] was looking at his promises
[2:10:13] because he saw himself as elohim he was
[2:10:15] represented elohim on the earth
[2:10:18] as job was representing lord on the
[2:10:20] earth
[2:10:22] so he went to fight and guess who met
[2:10:24] him
[2:10:25] the lord hadn't done that before
[2:10:27] the first time the lord placed himself
[2:10:29] in flesh
[2:10:31] puts his element on him
[2:10:33] and he called two angels
[2:10:34] they drop into existing element
[2:10:37] and brother that is the power that is in
[2:10:38] you
[2:10:39] we are four i believe you have
[2:10:40] experienced the thought
[2:10:42] in one point in our time there are
[2:10:44] certain times that you don't have to you
[2:10:45] don't even have the opportunity to pray
[2:10:47] but what you desire it comes from the
[2:10:49] inner man the holy ghost in you and
[2:10:52] enforce your mind and you project it to
[2:10:54] whatever you need projected to the
[2:10:56] situation i've seen at one time i saw
[2:10:58] two people fighting
[2:11:00] and i felt like
[2:11:01] it wasn't them i was looking at it
[2:11:02] dimensionally i said it's not them
[2:11:04] fighting it's the devil trying to
[2:11:05] destroy them and i couldn't go to
[2:11:07] separate them but i projected peace
[2:11:09] let them stop fighting and why did they
[2:11:11] stop fighting
[2:11:12] i didn't have to go separate them tell
[2:11:14] them that i don't fight but he that is
[2:11:16] in you let that thought project it from
[2:11:19] your heart is the same as the spoken
[2:11:21] word and it will manifest to the glory
[2:11:23] of the lord amen
[2:11:25] and that's what abraham did
[2:11:28] he wasn't a military he wasn't like a a
[2:11:31] military trained person he didn't have
[2:11:32] ak-47 but the thought of delivering a
[2:11:36] lot his nephew
[2:11:37] filled his heart and the pillow of fire
[2:11:39] in him
[2:11:40] defeated those people that were fighting
[2:11:42] against that had already captured a
[2:11:45] lot
[2:11:46] and brought them back and the lord he
[2:11:48] said mercy the king of salem brought
[2:11:50] forth bread and wine and he was a priest
[2:11:53] of the most high god which i love the
[2:11:55] verse 19 and 20. and he blessed him in
[2:11:58] other words the lord blessed abraham
[2:12:01] and said blessed be abram you know by
[2:12:03] then he hasn't changed yet
[2:12:05] when you forgive the lord will bring
[2:12:06] your your desire to come to pass blessed
[2:12:09] be abraham of the messiah
[2:12:11] possessor of heaven and what and earth
[2:12:14] so is earth your inheritance yes
[2:12:17] you may not need a white house but
[2:12:18] whatever you need the lord gives it to
[2:12:20] you for the glory of his name for you
[2:12:23] serving him for you giving your life to
[2:12:25] him the lord will give you the desires
[2:12:26] of your heart amen and he said he
[2:12:29] blessed and he said blessed be the
[2:12:31] messiah which are delivered thine
[2:12:33] enemies into the hand and he gave him
[2:12:35] tithe of all now the lord blessed
[2:12:37] himself
[2:12:38] in abraham
[2:12:40] blessed be the messiah when you do
[2:12:42] something that pleases the lord don't
[2:12:44] think that you know we always look at
[2:12:45] the lord as supernatural he's like this
[2:12:47] pillow of fire
[2:12:49] and he doesn't have a human feeling no
[2:12:51] the bible said that jesus christ is what
[2:12:53] is a high priest who can be touched
[2:12:56] by what by the feeling of our
[2:12:58] infirmities and i want you to keep the
[2:13:00] ascription in your heart jesus christ is
[2:13:02] rule the high priest who can be what
[2:13:05] touched by what by the feeling
[2:13:08] of our infirmity
[2:13:10] so when you are sick don't imagine god
[2:13:13] far away our human senses sometimes
[2:13:15] limit us
[2:13:17] but see him in you
[2:13:18] that lord this is the flesh that you use
[2:13:20] to preach this is a flesh that you used
[2:13:23] to wear long skirts to display your
[2:13:25] attribute of holiness this is the flesh
[2:13:26] that you use to pray for people now this
[2:13:28] flesh is not feeling good this flesh is
[2:13:31] down this face has got blood pressure
[2:13:33] this place has got arthritis this
[2:13:35] pressure has got whatever it is headache
[2:13:38] and you just name it migraines and let
[2:13:41] the pillow fire in you heal you from
[2:13:43] within out
[2:13:45] let the consuming fire consume the demon
[2:13:47] of headache the
[2:13:49] whatever
[2:13:50] diabetes blood pressure let that pillow
[2:13:53] fight in you consume those demons
[2:13:56] consume those irregularities in their
[2:13:57] body and line their body up amen and
[2:14:00] when you speak those things will line up
[2:14:02] for you
[2:14:03] there was a time back in ghana a
[2:14:05] minister pastor invited me to go and
[2:14:07] preach and i was sick
[2:14:09] i was coughing sneezing and everything

[2:14:29] give the introduction
[2:14:31] i felt like something running through my
[2:14:32] body

[2:14:36] the sneezing
[2:14:38] whatever i just named it everything the
[2:14:40] fever was gone

[2:15:14] to let you know that hey i've got this
[2:15:16] ready ring here sisters am i lying
[2:15:19] it's true
[2:15:21] in the natural types of spiritual
[2:15:23] if a natural woman is happy so happy
[2:15:25] with the husband she wants to display
[2:15:26] that hey i'm a sister and so
[2:15:29] what about the lord jesus christ
[2:15:31] when you are walking display the holy
[2:15:32] ghost that i'm wearing i may see jesus
[2:15:35] christ and i've got a wedding ring not

[2:16:10] faith is a substance this is the very
[2:16:11] first message that abraham recorded
[2:16:13] 1947. so now the pentecostal restoration
[2:16:16] of the divine healing of divine healing
[2:16:18] now pentecost people have been praying
[2:16:20] for the last 30 or 40 years for a gift
[2:16:23] of healing
[2:16:24] we are living in the days when we've got
[2:16:26] the best medical science we ever had we
[2:16:28] got the best hospitals we ever had we
[2:16:30] got the best doctors we ever had we got
[2:16:32] the best drugs we ever practiced with
[2:16:34] and we got more sickness than we ever
[2:16:37] had
[2:16:38] there's thousands and hundreds of
[2:16:40] thousands of precious sins of god
[2:16:43] suffering tonight and i'll say this
[2:16:45] after this afternoon
[2:16:46] there are god sins that are suffering of
[2:16:49] sickness and they are crying and crying
[2:16:51] and cried for years for god to restore
[2:16:54] the gift of divine healing to the church
[2:16:56] and when god moved the orbit i love this
[2:16:58] one to me my best bible is the zodiac
[2:17:00] god bless you by the jack for this
[2:17:02] zodiac teaching because the zodiac is
[2:17:03] what the lord himself wrote with the
[2:17:05] paper bible humans can interfere we can
[2:17:07] have king james version we can have this
[2:17:09] version but with the zodiac and the
[2:17:11] pyramid nobody can can interfere with it
[2:17:14] it's god's own bible amen he said god
[2:17:17] moved the orbits 37 years ago look at
[2:17:19] where 1947. abram was born in 1909
[2:17:24] so he was talking about when he was born
[2:17:26] that's when the lord chained the orbit
[2:17:28] he was born under the
[2:17:30] uh the star of aerys he was a ram just
[2:17:33] like the lord jesus christ
[2:17:34] and he came for give one of the greatest
[2:17:36] divine healing even more than what jesus
[2:17:38] did on earth it wasn't willie abraham no
[2:17:41] it was jesus christ hiding in the flesh
[2:17:44] of abraham manifesting divine healing
[2:17:46] upon the earth
[2:17:47] amen he said hendries even now god's
[2:17:50] children are sick he said and when the
[2:17:52] and when god and when god moved the
[2:17:54] orbit 37 years ago in other words when
[2:17:56] he was born
[2:17:57] and fought ordained and sending many
[2:17:58] hundreds of gods people are passing by
[2:18:00] without recognizing their friends but
[2:18:02] you have recognizing it recognizes that
[2:18:05] healing is you
[2:18:07] it's part of you it's just a bread and
[2:18:09] butter you take an eat believe don't
[2:18:11] worry about time don't look to the
[2:18:13] circumstance tell yourself i'm healed
[2:18:16] tell your family and he's healed tell
[2:18:18] your children they are saved tell your
[2:18:20] loved ones that they are covered they
[2:18:22] are full to the holy ghost don't look at
[2:18:24] them when they are doing drugs don't see
[2:18:25] them as drug dealers don't look at them
[2:18:28] as
[2:18:29] us as sinners don't look at them as
[2:18:31] fornicators but look at them as sins
[2:18:34] worshiping the lord and you place the
[2:18:36] token on them and let the thought in
[2:18:37] your heart
[2:18:38] project to them and they will follow
[2:18:40] right now don't worry about time
[2:18:42] when it doesn't matter the lord will
[2:18:44] take about when and how your says what
[2:18:47] believe
[2:18:48] think about it speak it and it will come
[2:18:50] to pass glory hallelujah to the lord
[2:18:53] [Applause]
[2:18:58] is there any more scripture i think
[2:18:59] probably the last one i guess any more
[2:19:01] quotes
[2:19:02] the church of the living god wow that's
[2:19:03] more than i thought i don't have it here
[2:19:05] god bless you
[2:19:07] let me see yes this is where we need to
[2:19:09] exercise some patience he said when you
[2:19:10] sow a seed you don't dig it up every
[2:19:13] morning to see the seeds come to pass
[2:19:16] if you do that your seed will never come
[2:19:17] up oh lord i pray for my heard they
[2:19:19] cannot have the headache do you even
[2:19:21] exist i pray for my children and my
[2:19:23] children are even doing worse it's a
[2:19:25] good sign that they are saved
[2:19:27] remember that the man that
[2:19:29] prayed for a blind man and was so blind
[2:19:32] and the man said but abraham i don't see
[2:19:34] you pronounce me hill but i'm not here
[2:19:35] that i so can't see he said what has it
[2:19:37] got to do with it
[2:19:39] because he's looking at the sixth
[2:19:40] dimension
[2:19:42] and he's seen a man with eyes open
[2:19:45] and the man is looking at the
[2:19:46] circumstance that i cannot see
[2:19:47] now this one has to have the faith
[2:19:49] to bring the diversion of him
[2:19:52] that sees from the sixth dimension to
[2:19:55] the second first second third and fourth
[2:19:57] dimension
[2:19:58] and what you pray for look at the
[2:19:59] dimension
[2:20:00] there's sometimes only the the feet that
[2:20:02] means they'll not allow the barrier so
[2:20:04] that you can what practice your faith
[2:20:07] because it's put something in you as a
[2:20:09] daughter of god that you have to bring
[2:20:11] it to pass
[2:20:12] he's not going to do it he's already in
[2:20:13] you that's why when moses was crying the
[2:20:15] lord came up from him and said moses why
[2:20:17] christ speak because he was hiding the
[2:20:19] moses
[2:20:20] just do i'm the one do moses don't cry
[2:20:22] don't look at yourself don't look at it
[2:20:24] people the military don't look at the
[2:20:25] two thousand people you are leading look
[2:20:27] at me in you
[2:20:28] and then moses came to himself and then
[2:20:30] said he pointed to the red sea and the
[2:20:32] rest he gave way and that's what we have
[2:20:34] to what restoration is coming to our
[2:20:37] self
[2:20:38] restoring our mind back to where we are
[2:20:40] let's let's really quickly what did i
[2:20:42] get to he said it's it's it's up to
[2:20:45] nature god so god is nature to water it
[2:20:48] and to see that it produces is that
[2:20:49] right is that true so that's the way you
[2:20:51] do it the word of the lord accept it in
[2:20:53] a good heart
[2:20:54] already fertilized
[2:20:56] and all the creepers and the rocky
[2:20:58] places and the stony doubts taken away
[2:21:01] and in good rich soil of what faith
[2:21:04] glory and believe it committed to the
[2:21:07] lord and walk away what do you say walk
[2:21:10] away another one one
[2:21:11] don't get yourself bothered with it just
[2:21:13] walk away speak it and walk away
[2:21:16] amen oh my goodness but i give them the
[2:21:19] offer that we have and we walk away
[2:21:22] let them battle with it amen
[2:21:25] [Applause]
[2:21:29] and walk away testifying that you've
[2:21:31] received what god has promised you
[2:21:34] and he's the high priest of your
[2:21:35] confession because he has got feeling in
[2:21:38] him
[2:21:39] just like your mother to make right
[2:21:41] anything that you confess that he has
[2:21:43] done that that's the gospel now the
[2:21:45] gospel isn't only the word could you
[2:21:48] imagine people freezing to death and
[2:21:49] i'll paint
[2:21:50] i'll paint them a picture of fire
[2:21:53] and i'll say look at this fire burning
[2:21:55] isn't it warm look at the people
[2:21:56] standing around warming but that's the
[2:21:58] only picture of something that has been
[2:22:00] you freeze you freeze just the same
[2:22:03] looking at the picture what it takes is
[2:22:05] that the fire to be reproduced again for
[2:22:07] your warmth
[2:22:08] the gospel fire and the gospel that was
[2:22:11] in that day it's written in the word as
[2:22:14] a history all that we read from the
[2:22:16] bible is a history that was recorded now
[2:22:18] he said a painted fire of what was
[2:22:21] so if you only look to the old examples
[2:22:23] in the bible then it's going to be just
[2:22:25] a painted fire that's why people read
[2:22:26] the same king james in many puppets but
[2:22:29] they don't see an ounce of supernatural
[2:22:32] in in their lives
[2:22:34] but look at this see the penis accept
[2:22:36] the same seed
[2:22:37] that they accepted and it will be a
[2:22:39] living reality in you that will bring
[2:22:41] you into the same experience that they
[2:22:43] had amen
[2:22:45] and i just don't want to go further
[2:22:46] let's go to the next next scripture
[2:22:51] i love this one roko in heaven god is
[2:22:53] calling names now
[2:22:55] put your name there amen
[2:22:57] it's not me i may not even know your
[2:22:58] name but god is calling you right now
[2:23:01] to who you are amen and this was the
[2:23:03] same one preaching that seven churches
[2:23:05] he said i'll confess his name before my
[2:23:07] father and his angels wrote call in
[2:23:09] heaven if a man die shall he leave again
[2:23:12] all the days of my appointed time will i
[2:23:15] wait so my change come thou shall call
[2:23:18] and i will answer thee thou will have a
[2:23:20] desire to their works for their hand
[2:23:21] this way i love it the great shepherd is
[2:23:23] calling his sheep by name the creative
[2:23:26] voice of god is calling them from
[2:23:28] forth from the dust or changing their
[2:23:31] atoms even though they have not fallen
[2:23:33] asleep it is the rapture there's a great
[2:23:35] marriage supper of the lamp and it's
[2:23:37] bright amen the lord doesn't wait for
[2:23:40] you to die to call your name no
[2:23:43] he's changing your atoms
[2:23:45] by the holy ghost baptism
[2:23:47] remember brother stephen's testimony
[2:23:49] that when he went to the other side he
[2:23:51] saw even the same one that his pastor
[2:23:53] preached he saw that someone that he
[2:23:54] preached
[2:23:56] is what we are doing here is not brother
[2:23:58] jack it's not better quicker it's not
[2:24:00] that smiley it's not bad
[2:24:01] but but jerry is not brother troy it's
[2:24:04] not a solomon it's not any of us as a
[2:24:06] human being

[2:24:12] wanted to be a doctor or i wanted to be
[2:24:14] a scientist and discover things that was
[2:24:16] what i wanted to do but my father above
[2:24:18] chose this for me before the foundation
[2:24:20] of the world and he took me from amnesia

[2:25:24] eternity jesus christ and the angels

[2:25:32] old saints leave their life they live a
[2:25:34] fearless life they were daniel was put

[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:44] you know he said uh it was his desire to
[2:30:46] go to school and become a doctor
[2:30:48] [Music]
[2:30:49] and the lord just kind of changed things
[2:30:52] but i tell you when he approaches his
[2:30:53] word he comes
[2:30:55] like a doctor
[2:30:57] and uh just just just just wonderful
[2:30:59] testimonies from uh going there to
[2:31:02] colombia
[2:31:04] and um you know just he entered into so
[2:31:07] many things there today just picking up
[2:31:09] where he left off but i i love this um
[2:31:12] uh this little um
[2:31:15] challenge
[2:31:16] he went there to the hospital
[2:31:19] and he didn't have the the
[2:31:22] right to just stop and pray for the lady
[2:31:25] because he was you know going on his
[2:31:26] realms
[2:31:27] but he pulled his mask down and just
[2:31:29] projected a thought
[2:31:31] and
[2:31:32] you know i was thinking on that as you
[2:31:33] know
[2:31:34] we were told a couple things that we
[2:31:36] were told one was that we were told that
[2:31:38] our thoughts
[2:31:40] are heard louder in heaven
[2:31:42] than our words are on earth
[2:31:44] and another thing
[2:31:46] i love the scripture says
[2:31:50] what several things are lovely
[2:31:52] what several things are just
[2:31:54] what sort of things of good report
[2:31:57] the bible says think on these things
[2:32:00] right and uh and i believe that's
[2:32:02] exactly what he was exercising
[2:32:03] underneath that authority and the power
[2:32:05] that god has given us a man according to
[2:32:07] his word so we just appreciate amen the
[2:32:10] word of the lord today let's sing the
[2:32:12] song of worship
[2:32:13] before we prepare to leave it says lord
[2:32:16] you are so precious to me
