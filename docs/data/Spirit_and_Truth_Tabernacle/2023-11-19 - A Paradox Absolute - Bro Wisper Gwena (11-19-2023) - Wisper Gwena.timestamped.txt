[51:09] wonderful that's great thank you
[51:12] sir in the Book of
[51:15] Joshua Joshua chapter
[51:19] 4 starting from verse one and it came to
[51:23] pass when all the people wake clean
[51:25] pasted over Jordan that the Lord spake
[51:27] unto Joshua saying take you 12 men out
[51:30] of the people out of every tribe a man
[51:34] and command ye them
[51:36] saying take your hands out of the midst
[51:39] of Jordan out of the place where the
[51:41] priest fits stood fir 12 Stones and he
[51:44] shall carry them over with you and leave
[51:47] them in the lodging place where you
[51:48] shall Lodge this night then Joshua
[51:51] called the 12 men whom he had prepared
[51:54] of the children of Israel out of every
[51:57] tribe a man and Joshua said unto them
[52:00] pass over before the Ark of the Lord
[52:02] your God into the midst of Jordan and
[52:05] take ye up every man of us Stone upon
[52:08] his shoulder and according unto the
[52:11] number of the tribes of the children of
[52:13] Israel that this may be a sign among you
[52:16] that when your children ask their
[52:18] fathers in time to come saying what mean
[52:22] ye by these
[52:24] stones then he shall answer them that
[52:27] the Waters of Jordan were cut off before
[52:29] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when
[52:31] it passed over Jordan the Waters of
[52:34] Jordan were cut off and the stones shall
[52:37] be for a memorial unto the children of
[52:41] Israel
[52:43] forever amen then another portion of
[52:46] scripture The Book of John chapter
[52:49] 1 in the beginning was the word and the
[52:53] Word was with God and the Word was God
[52:57] the same was in the beginning with God
[53:00] all things were made by him and without
[53:03] him was not anything mad that was mad
[53:07] and then in verse 14 and the Word was
[53:11] made flesh and dwelt amongst us verse 10
[53:15] and he was in the world and the world
[53:17] was made by him and the world knew him
[53:21] not may God Ed his Blessing to the
[53:24] reading of his word we may be
[53:28] seated as we just bow our heads for a
[53:31] word of
[53:32] prayer Mighty and eternal heavenly
[53:36] father father we are so grateful for the
[53:40] opportunity to come into your house for
[53:43] the opportunity to read your word for
[53:46] the opportunity to Fellowship around the
[53:48] same father but we realize that as men
[53:52] we cannot handle the word Lord father
[53:55] this takes you and you alone Lord I
[53:59] therefore confess my inabilities Lord
[54:02] and I ask you great Jehovah that you can
[54:04] step in at this time father we pray that
[54:08] you can have your own way we pray that
[54:11] you can take over the service from hence
[54:13] forth Lord I pray that you can be Lord

[54:24] Christ Jesus father we are surrendering
[54:27] all things from hence forth even into
[54:29] thy hands increase Lord as we all
[54:33] decrease in Jesus Christ's namej amen
[54:37] amen praise the Lord God bless you allow
[54:40] me to just take off my
[54:53] jacket praise the Lord L how many are
[54:57] under expectation am the prophet says
[55:01] you get according to what you expect
[55:04] Hallelujah hey God bless you Brother
[55:06] Joseph good to see you sir how you
[55:10] doing praise the
[55:12] Lord he is a real blessing this young
[55:15] man amen and good to see brother Johnson
[55:19] together with a wife amen we the're
[55:22] regulars now of London right
[55:27] praise the Lord amen by God's grace I I
[55:31] want to take a title and the title that
[55:34] I want to speak on is a paradox absolute
[55:38] right
[55:40] amen the Lord was um you know just
[55:43] leading me to this and uh you know as a
[55:46] preacher you preach all the time and you
[55:48] wonder so what am I going to preach um
[55:53] now that I have to preach here right and
[55:56] uh you just don't know which way to go
[55:58] yes sir and um I um was just trying to
[56:02] find the direction of the Lord and I
[56:05] knew as well that I had to bring a baby
[56:09] dedication uh and then something kind of
[56:12] like excited
[56:14] me um when I looked at um you know the
[56:19] prophet dedicating his um
[56:21] grandson how many know what seron that
[56:24] was was
[56:27] in it was in the seron
[56:33] Paradox so I said okay so I think I'm on
[56:37] the right
[56:38] track I'd already been looking at a
[56:41] paradox so by God's grace I I want to
[56:45] look at this title a paradox absolute
[56:49] right uh a bit of a strange title but I
[56:52] hope that it will make sense as as we
[56:54] are going along the way now we know that
[56:57] when the prophet preached um he actually
[57:00] preached on these two words um something
[57:03] has disappeared right uh he preached on
[57:06] on these two words a paradox um it was
[57:11] um a seron in its own right and then he
[57:15] preached on an absolute again it was a
[57:18] seron in its own right and um I'm taking
[57:22] this two words and I'm coming up with
[57:25] this title and it is a paradox absolute
[57:30] amen now it looks as if I'm just taking
[57:34] two words here that the prophet preached
[57:37] on and I'm coming up with something uh
[57:40] you know that maybe just taking two
[57:41] semmons but I want to say that there's
[57:45] actually a meaning to
[57:47] this amen there's actually a meaning to
[57:51] that title when we look at it is a
[57:53] paradox
[57:55] absolute amen how do you mean Preacher
[57:58] Man that there is a meaning to it when
[58:00] the prophet preached these two messages
[58:03] he actually started by giving a
[58:05] definition of those two words and we
[58:08] know he went right back to the
[58:09] dictionary and that's where he picked um
[58:12] the the definitions of these two words
[58:15] the prophet of God says in the message
[58:17] absolute he says according to Webster's
[58:20] Dictionary says it's perfect in itself
[58:23] Unlimited in power primarily an ultimate
[58:29] right that's an absolute so it's an
[58:34] ultimate amen amen then he took the
[58:38] definition of a paradox and the
[58:40] definition of a paradox according to uh
[58:44] the dictionary he says in the Webster
[58:46] dictionary it says that a paradox means
[58:49] something that's incredible but
[58:52] true that is a paradox something that's
[58:55] almost completely out of
[58:58] Reason couldn't be so but yet it
[59:03] is that's a
[59:06] paradox I like that
[59:08] bit couldn't be so right but yet it
[59:14] is I really like that part glory amen
[59:18] because it it tells us then what a
[59:20] paradox really is it looks like it can
[59:23] be so but yet it is amen amen now
[59:29] bringing these two words together a
[59:31] paradox absolute amen an absolute is
[59:35] something that is an ultimate a paradox
[59:38] is something that couldn't be so but yet
[59:41] it is so I'm talking about an absolute
[59:45] an ultimate that looks like it couldn't
[59:48] be so but yet it is hallelujah so it's a
[59:53] paradox absolute
[59:55] looks like it can be an
[59:58] absolute but yet it
[1:00:01] is are you with me yes amen and for a
[1:00:05] subject I want to be looking at from an
[1:00:07] absolute to a paradox making an
[1:00:14] absolute Hallelujah that's why it looks
[1:00:17] like it couldn't be so but yet it is all
[1:00:22] right amen praise the Lord amen now we'
[1:00:26] have already read amen what the
[1:00:28] definition of these words are amen and
[1:00:31] we understand that an absolute is
[1:00:33] something that is perfect in itself
[1:00:35] something Unlimited in power primarily
[1:00:38] in Ultimate but the prophet then also
[1:00:41] gave us further definitions of this and
[1:00:43] he says in the message absolute and
[1:00:46] absolute it's used many times it's the
[1:00:48] last word it's the amen you hear people
[1:00:52] say absolutely the that's it that's the
[1:00:56] last thing it's ultimate it's unlimited
[1:01:00] sorry that takes from here on there's
[1:01:03] nothing else in its way it's the Supreme
[1:01:06] hallelujah it's an ultimate and an
[1:01:09] ultimate is whenn primarily in Ultimate
[1:01:12] because you have reached the end Glory
[1:01:15] it's the
[1:01:16] amen that's
[1:01:17] Allelujah that's an absolute amen and
[1:01:21] the prophet of God then says and
[1:01:23] therefore I think that everybody should
[1:01:26] have an ultimate yes sir and every great
[1:01:30] achievement that's ever been achieved
[1:01:32] there's been an absolute behind it no
[1:01:34] matter what it was is had an absolute
[1:01:37] behind it and every person in order to
[1:01:40] achieve something has to First have the
[1:01:43] absolute all right I like that right and
[1:01:47] that's the final wine back through this
[1:01:50] that back through the other till you
[1:01:52] come to that absolute or that I that
[1:01:55] amen or that
[1:01:57] ultimate watch this every person that
[1:02:00] has ever achieved something first
[1:02:02] they've had to have an absolute amen and
[1:02:05] the prophet says everybody must have an
[1:02:08] ultimate Hallelujah then he goes on and
[1:02:11] he says you got something you have to
[1:02:13] tie to in other words It's the final
[1:02:16] tying post to every achievement it's
[1:02:19] somewhere it might wind through many
[1:02:22] different things till it gets to the
[1:02:25] typos but there is the amen to all of it
[1:02:29] there must be such a thing you cannot go
[1:02:32] through life without having one that's
[1:02:36] right that's right amen that's right or
[1:02:38] do me a favor and tell your neighbor you
[1:02:40] cannot go through life without having an
[1:02:44] absolute
[1:02:47] amen hallelujah it's impossible to go
[1:02:49] through life without having an
[1:02:52] absolute amen something that is supreme
[1:02:55] something that is in Ultimate something
[1:02:58] that overrules your thinking something
[1:03:00] that overrules your feeling something
[1:03:03] that overrules your entire perceptions
[1:03:06] Hallelujah and your entire
[1:03:08] perspectives something that overuse it
[1:03:11] that's an absolute yes it is where the
[1:03:14] arguments end can you say Amen that when
[1:03:18] there are difference in opinions when
[1:03:20] there are difference in perceptions when
[1:03:22] you come to an absolute the absolute
[1:03:24] should silence everything should bring a
[1:03:26] finality to whatever the argument is
[1:03:29] that's an
[1:03:30] ultimate and the prophet of God then
[1:03:33] tells us but God's absolute is his
[1:03:37] word he gives it and heavens and earth
[1:03:40] will pass away but it shall never pass
[1:03:43] away and the prophet says I like
[1:03:46] that and I like that too God's word is
[1:03:50] he absolute can you say amen amen God's
[1:03:54] word why does it become an absolute
[1:03:56] because it is unchanging Glory
[1:03:59] everything else in life can change amen
[1:04:02] but when we come to an absolute It's the
[1:04:05] final right we have come to the end
[1:04:07] there is no more change right amen so
[1:04:10] God's word is an absolute it is the
[1:04:13] tying post it is the unending amen the
[1:04:17] final of everything we have come to the
[1:04:19] amen hallelujah are you with me yes sir
[1:04:23] that becomes a Time post praise be to
[1:04:26] God now then when you have the word of
[1:04:28] God as your tying post as your final as
[1:04:31] your absolute then you can go through
[1:04:34] life why can you go through life because
[1:04:37] life is very
[1:04:39] fluid life is always
[1:04:41] Changing Times change environments
[1:04:44] change the way we think changes the way
[1:04:47] we look at things changes and as these
[1:04:49] things change we also change amen you
[1:04:53] change I change change depends on what
[1:04:55] side of the bed I wake up on if you wake
[1:04:58] up on the wrong side of the bed you're
[1:05:00] completely going south isn't it because
[1:05:03] you are a changing being you need
[1:05:06] something that doesn't change that when
[1:05:08] you wake up on the wrong side of the bed
[1:05:10] there is something that brings you on
[1:05:12] the right path and that becomes the
[1:05:15] absolute Oh Glory to God hallu
[1:05:18] hallelujah can you say amen amen so you
[1:05:22] need that absolute that you can tie
[1:05:24] yourself to that when life begins to
[1:05:27] change around you you have something
[1:05:29] that anchors you and the word of God the
[1:05:33] prophet tells us that it's an absolute
[1:05:35] amen and when you take that word as your
[1:05:38] absolute then you are tied to something
[1:05:40] that is not changing even if you have
[1:05:43] differences you can come to the absolute
[1:05:45] of the word and you can resolve your
[1:05:47] differences on the word but in order to
[1:05:50] use the word of God as an absolute it
[1:05:53] means the part is that are involved they
[1:05:55] all have to have the same
[1:05:58] absolute amen is that right because
[1:06:01] unless you believe in the same absolute
[1:06:04] you can never resolve your issues is
[1:06:06] that right that's why the Bible says in
[1:06:09] the book of amamos can two walk together
[1:06:12] except they be
[1:06:14] agreed so before two start to walk
[1:06:17] together there's got to be an agreement
[1:06:19] on an
[1:06:20] absolute that when my perceptions go
[1:06:22] this way and your perception go that way
[1:06:25] we can be brought to a Reconciliation by
[1:06:27] an absolute can two walk together unless
[1:06:32] there is an absolute am amen is that
[1:06:34] right Church the Bible also tells us in
[1:06:37] the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 6 it
[1:06:40] says be not unequally yed together with
[1:06:45] unbelievers why is the Bible teaching us
[1:06:48] this because they then is no absolute
[1:06:51] right brother you you don't have
[1:06:53] something that is in that is in common
[1:06:56] and you can never have a Reconciliation
[1:06:59] when there are arguments that come along
[1:07:00] the way and this principle applies right
[1:07:04] through life it applies in marriage that
[1:07:08] you can't have two people getting
[1:07:09] married amen unless they have the same
[1:07:13] absolute you got to have the same
[1:07:15] absolute Because unless you have the
[1:07:17] same absolute marriage is not an easy
[1:07:21] walk amen you difference in opinions you
[1:07:26] have one mind that is thinking another
[1:07:28] way another mind that is thinking
[1:07:29] another way but when you have an
[1:07:31] absolute praise be to God you can be
[1:07:33] brought together to something Hallelujah
[1:07:36] that can reconcile
[1:07:38] you that's why the prophet of God says
[1:07:41] and no believer should ever marry an
[1:07:43] unbeliever under no
[1:07:47] circumstances is that right Church why
[1:07:50] because then you will have the same
[1:07:52] absolute and it's important to have that
[1:07:55] same absolute otherwise how are you
[1:07:58] going to reconcile that marriage how are
[1:08:00] you going to go through that marriage we
[1:08:03] need an absolute in every marriage we
[1:08:05] need an absolute in every church we need
[1:08:08] an absolute in every home whatever the
[1:08:11] situation is you need to come to that
[1:08:13] ultimate where you can say here we rest
[1:08:16] our
[1:08:18] case Oh Glory to God am now not only
[1:08:23] must the word become an absolute in
[1:08:26] times of conflict but the word must
[1:08:29] become an absolute in every aspects of
[1:08:32] our
[1:08:33] lives are you with
[1:08:35] me when you have the word is an absolute
[1:08:38] in every aspect of your life then it
[1:08:41] does not matter what is changing in your
[1:08:43] life Oh Glory to God because you have
[1:08:47] something that is tying you something
[1:08:50] that is
[1:08:51] unchanging circumstances change
[1:08:54] environments change but the word remains
[1:08:58] unmovable Hallelujah your life
[1:09:01] situations are ever changing but the
[1:09:03] word remains
[1:09:05] unmovable life throws some negatives to
[1:09:08] you and when life throws some negatives
[1:09:11] I'm so glad that when you have the word
[1:09:13] as your absolute the word remains a
[1:09:16] positive that when life throws a
[1:09:18] negative at you there is still a
[1:09:20] positive that is anchored deep within
[1:09:23] your soul where you can say it does not
[1:09:26] matter what is going on it does not
[1:09:28] matter what is changing there but I got
[1:09:31] something that is
[1:09:33] positive Hall that when negative news
[1:09:36] comes your way you have a positive of
[1:09:39] the word hallelujah you have a different
[1:09:42] opinion Oh Glory to God in the highest
[1:09:46] then it does not matter what you have
[1:09:47] for what you don't have because when you
[1:09:49] have the word the word is a creative
[1:09:52] absolute
[1:09:54] H then what you don't have does not
[1:09:57] matter Hallelujah why because you can
[1:10:01] bring it to a creative absolute and that
[1:10:04] creative absolute it can produce a
[1:10:08] phoenix something coming out of nothing
[1:10:11] that when there is nothing Hallelujah
[1:10:13] the word can produce
[1:10:16] something I'm reminded of brother Tony
[1:10:19] zabel he was a deacon in brother
[1:10:21] branham's church then the went for I
[1:10:24] think it was the second set of squirel
[1:10:26] that he went hunting then when he went
[1:10:28] hunting and you know he killed the
[1:10:30] fourth squirel and the prophet of God
[1:10:32] says it kind of like felt it fell in a
[1:10:35] stamp how many know that c it fell in a
[1:10:39] stamp and the prophet says he went to
[1:10:41] look for that squirrel and he couldn't
[1:10:42] find it but he had spoken the squirrel
[1:10:45] into existence so when he came back to
[1:10:48] Camp amen then he started telling the
[1:10:50] people of the testimony of how God has
[1:10:53] created this
[1:10:54] squirrel then he said he couldn't find
[1:10:57] that other one then brother Ton's Bell
[1:11:00] when he was now praying he was asked to
[1:11:02] close in prayer for the night so the
[1:11:04] people could go and sleep then brother
[1:11:06] Tony zel started to pray and brother
[1:11:08] Tony said Lord we pray that when
[1:11:12] tomorrow brother Branham goes back into
[1:11:14] the hood that he finds that squirel that
[1:11:17] we might know that he's saying the
[1:11:21] truth and that really bothered the
[1:11:24] prophet and the prophet started getting
[1:11:27] concerned to say so what this really
[1:11:29] means is if I don't get the squir
[1:11:32] brother ton Isel is going to believe I
[1:11:34] was
[1:11:35] lying and I'm a prophet of God now found
[1:11:39] to be lying before the people and it
[1:11:42] really bothered the prophet and the
[1:11:44] prophet was so wound in that whole thing
[1:11:47] but God wanted to teach the prophet a
[1:11:49] lesson then is the prophet was so wound
[1:11:52] in that whole thing
[1:11:54] then God started to speak to him and the
[1:11:56] prophet then says and something say to
[1:11:58] me if it isn't there or if it is in
[1:12:02] there what makes the
[1:12:05] difference are you forgetting this
[1:12:07] church God is saying to the prophet
[1:12:10] whether you find the squirrel there or
[1:12:13] you don't find the squirrel there what
[1:12:15] difference does it make it doesn't make
[1:12:18] a difference and the prophet said I said
[1:12:21] he wouldn't believe me he prayed and
[1:12:23] said if we find the squirrel you will
[1:12:25] know that our brother has told us the
[1:12:27] truth and that anointing came amen and
[1:12:31] the great anointing come and it says
[1:12:33] just say the squir will be there and you
[1:12:37] will get
[1:12:38] him what was God teaching the prophet
[1:12:41] that the circumstances they don't matter
[1:12:44] whether it is there or is not there it
[1:12:47] does not matter what matters is the
[1:12:49] absolute inside of you is an absolute so
[1:12:53] speak the
[1:12:55] word just say it will be there and when
[1:12:59] you get there you will find it there oh
[1:13:02] come on Church of the Living God your
[1:13:04] circumstances don't matter what matters
[1:13:07] is the absolute that is in you if there
[1:13:09] is an absolute in you then you speak the
[1:13:11] word and that word is what is going to
[1:13:14] change
[1:13:15] circumstances can you say Amen somebody
[1:13:18] can you say Amen somebody oh let me say
[1:13:21] your situation is not got the final say
[1:13:24] s Hallelujah you have the final say s
[1:13:29] what happens in life does not have the
[1:13:30] final say so because it's not an
[1:13:33] absolute the absolute is the word of the
[1:13:35] Living God so you got to wait for the
[1:13:38] word when the word speaks the word is
[1:13:41] the final say so I'm beginning to feel
[1:13:44] religious right now glory to God in the
[1:13:48] highest Hallelujah the absolute is what
[1:13:51] made us Church what the doctor says does
[1:13:54] not matter what the doctor tells you
[1:13:57] does not matter he might tell you a
[1:13:59] whole long story but I'm here to tell
[1:14:01] you that does not matter what matters is
[1:14:04] what the absolute says the absolute says
[1:14:07] by his stripes you are healed so the
[1:14:11] doctor's testimony is of no
[1:14:14] consequence come on
[1:14:16] somebody say Amen somebody hallelujah
[1:14:21] what the boss at work says it does not
[1:14:23] matter because the boss does not have an
[1:14:26] absolute you can change the mind of the
[1:14:29] boss and we can change it in church you
[1:14:33] can change decisions that have been made
[1:14:36] somewhere else because what they say is
[1:14:38] not an absolute What God Says is what is
[1:14:41] in absolute can you say Amen somebody
[1:14:45] can you say Amen praise be to God in the
[1:14:48] highest everything else can
[1:14:52] change
[1:14:54] is that
[1:14:55] right sickness can
[1:14:58] change in fact you once were not sick
[1:15:01] that's right Hallelujah you once never
[1:15:03] used to have sugar diabetes you once
[1:15:05] never used to have blood pressure but it
[1:15:08] came somewhere along the way so
[1:15:10] something changed and by the same token
[1:15:13] I want to say it can also
[1:15:15] change back to a healing again it does
[1:15:19] not matter what the devil is trying to
[1:15:22] throw your away What God Says is what
[1:15:25] matters say Amen somebody glory to God
[1:15:29] in the highest when the absolute speaks
[1:15:33] it is what matters and the prophet of
[1:15:36] God tells us oh you know sometime when
[1:15:39] you take an absolute an absolute will
[1:15:42] lead you to a
[1:15:46] paradox oh how many are looking for a
[1:15:49] paradox something
[1:15:51] unbelievable something that looks like
[1:15:53] it is not so when you take the word the
[1:15:57] word will lead you to an
[1:16:00] absolute are you with me church that's
[1:16:04] right yes a paradox is something that's
[1:16:07] real but can be explained it's an
[1:16:11] absolute when you take the word the word
[1:16:14] will lead you to a paradox what is the
[1:16:18] prophet telling us here that what in
[1:16:20] absolute does in absolute POS the
[1:16:23] situation Hallelujah and it brings it to
[1:16:25] the environment of the absolute it does
[1:16:28] not matter what the situation was but
[1:16:31] it's got to comply with the environment
[1:16:33] of the
[1:16:34] absolute an absolute will panit the
[1:16:37] situation it will change the situation
[1:16:40] it will Forge the situation until it
[1:16:43] complies with the
[1:16:45] absolute I don't even care what you're
[1:16:47] going through right now but I got good
[1:16:50] news for you that the absolute of the
[1:16:52] word will turn your situation it will
[1:16:55] force your situation it will change your
[1:16:58] circumstances are you with me but if
[1:17:01] there is a sick body God pulls that sick
[1:17:04] body and brings it to the environment of
[1:17:07] the word and in the environment of the
[1:17:09] word there is no
[1:17:11] Sickness by his stripes you are healed
[1:17:16] if you are poor then the Bible says he
[1:17:19] raises the poor Out of the Dust of the
[1:17:21] earth so the word Bo you from your
[1:17:24] poverty and places you into the
[1:17:27] environment of the
[1:17:28] word and then in the environment of the
[1:17:31] word the word then says change your
[1:17:33] confession let the weak
[1:17:36] say let the poor say that's the word
[1:17:40] environment and as you begin to confess
[1:17:42] that it changes your circumstances if
[1:17:45] God causes your body to obey your
[1:17:49] confession oh say Amen someone glory to
[1:17:53] God in the highest so the absolute is
[1:17:56] what matters and God's word is the
[1:18:01] absolute and an absolute is something
[1:18:04] amen that is the
[1:18:08] anchor but a paradox is something that
[1:18:11] looks like it can be so but yet it
[1:18:15] is and the prophet also tells us a
[1:18:18] paradox is something that seems
[1:18:20] incredible but it's true therefore a
[1:18:23] paradox would be the same as a
[1:18:27] miracle are you with me he says a
[1:18:30] paradox is a miracle something that
[1:18:32] cannot be explained all right all right
[1:18:35] it could not be
[1:18:36] explained how that a quiro that was not
[1:18:39] in existence when the prophet spoke and
[1:18:41] he says let there be a squero
[1:18:44] existed are you with me now it means
[1:18:47] you're dwelling in a world of no
[1:18:50] difference that no matter what happens
[1:18:52] in your life
[1:18:53] just say it will be there and it will be
[1:18:57] there oh church I wish we can believe
[1:19:00] the word J I wish we can come to a place
[1:19:03] where we know how to take the the
[1:19:05] absolute until it produces a paradox in
[1:19:08] our
[1:19:09] lives Abraham one time he took that
[1:19:12] absolute all right God say to Father
[1:19:15] Abraham go and sacrifice your only son
[1:19:18] Abraham said yes Lord I know how to take
[1:19:21] an absolute he went to mount Mariah with
[1:19:25] his son going ready to go and sacrifice
[1:19:27] that boy sir and the prophet of God says
[1:19:31] he knew amen that if God had given him
[1:19:34] is almost from the dead the same God was
[1:19:37] able to raise him from the
[1:19:39] dead so he says if I kill him God can
[1:19:42] resurrect him so Abraham took his only
[1:19:45] son he raised up the knife ready to slay
[1:19:48] his own son taking the absolute but no
[1:19:51] sooner than he had now stretched his
[1:19:53] hand then God's voice came and he says
[1:19:57] Abraham Hallelujah glory to God
[1:20:00] hallelujah I see now that you believe me
[1:20:03] turn around and when he turned around
[1:20:06] then he saw a ram that was caught in a
[1:20:08] ticket that's right where did the r come
[1:20:11] from when he took the absolute It
[1:20:14] produced a
[1:20:15] paradox so when you take an absolute it
[1:20:18] leads you to a paradox is that right I
[1:20:22] read shadra mesek and abedo Shadrach mik
[1:20:26] and abedo they took the absolute of the
[1:20:28] word and when they took the absolute of
[1:20:31] the word they said oh King we are not
[1:20:33] careful to answer you in this but our
[1:20:35] God who we serve is able to deliver us
[1:20:39] the king had said who is able to deliver
[1:20:42] you from my hands he says we are not
[1:20:44] careful to answer you in this but our
[1:20:46] God who we serve is more than able oh
[1:20:50] Church you got to know what your God is
[1:20:52] able to do you got to know that he's
[1:20:55] able to take you out of every situation
[1:20:58] they said yes our God is able they took
[1:21:01] him amen as an absolute they said oh
[1:21:03] King you are not an
[1:21:05] absolute right he said I've heated the
[1:21:08] furnace seven times who is it that can
[1:21:10] take you out of my they said oh King you
[1:21:13] are not an absolute there's one that
[1:21:15] rules above all things when they were
[1:21:17] thrown in the fire they took that
[1:21:20] absolute and the absolute produced a
[1:21:22] Paradox and what was that Paradox a
[1:21:25] forth man in the fire Hallelujah is that
[1:21:28] right Church yes sir David when he
[1:21:30] looked at Goliad amen everyone was
[1:21:33] afraid of that golad but David says God
[1:21:37] you told me to be circumcised I'm in
[1:21:40] Israel circumcised on the eighth day and
[1:21:43] this Philistine is an uncircumcised
[1:21:47] Philistine and he went and he looked at
[1:21:49] him and he said you come to me with a
[1:21:51] spear and a sword but I come to you in
[1:21:54] the name of the Lord God of host who you
[1:21:57] have defied he said today golad your
[1:22:00] head is coming off he was taking an
[1:22:04] absolute he was not looking at the size
[1:22:06] of Goliath so was looking at the size of
[1:22:09] golad and he thought golad was an
[1:22:11] absolute but David says uhuh the
[1:22:13] absolute is the word all right yes sir
[1:22:16] God has already spoken about this and
[1:22:18] I'm taking the absolute of the word is
[1:22:21] the righteous whenever an absolute is
[1:22:25] taken it leads us to a
[1:22:28] paradox but let me move on as I come to
[1:22:32] my title amen amen I said my title is a
[1:22:37] paradox absolute all right and I said my
[1:22:40] subject is from a par from an absolute
[1:22:42] to a paradox producing an
[1:22:46] absolute now we've already seen that
[1:22:48] when you take an absolute it leads you
[1:22:50] to a paradox is that right yes
[1:22:53] now the prophet of God says oh you know
[1:22:56] sometime when you take an absolute an
[1:23:00] absolute will lead you to a paradox now
[1:23:03] when you go through the message in
[1:23:06] absolute this becomes quite
[1:23:09] clear and I know many years ago I
[1:23:12] preached on this just taking it from
[1:23:14] there when you take an absolute an
[1:23:16] absolute will lead you to a paradox is
[1:23:19] that right yes and we've done run
[1:23:21] through the scripture
[1:23:23] so we can have a loop right there that
[1:23:25] when you take an absolute an absolute
[1:23:27] will lead you to a paradox brother are
[1:23:31] you with me sir right right and that's
[1:23:34] quite clear when you read the message
[1:23:36] yes sir but I wonder how many of you
[1:23:40] have also picked the other part that the
[1:23:42] prophet of God pro brought I had never
[1:23:45] heard it myself until one of the days
[1:23:48] when I was listening to the message yes
[1:23:50] sir the prophet of God says in the
[1:23:51] message and absolute he says it's a
[1:23:54] paradox certainly do you believe in a
[1:23:56] paradox and that Paradox if it's
[1:23:59] according to the word of God it can be
[1:24:02] your
[1:24:05] absolute
[1:24:06] hello wow amen so the prophet says when
[1:24:11] you take an absolute it will lead you to
[1:24:13] a paradox but now he's turning around
[1:24:16] and he's saying that Paradox if it's
[1:24:19] according to the word of God it can
[1:24:21] become your absolute
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:25] hallelujah oh glory to God oh
[1:24:30] Hallelujah and when I heard that that
[1:24:32] struck me real good brother Jack I said
[1:24:35] my thank God for the
[1:24:37] prophet Hallelujah in other words what
[1:24:41] the prophet of God is telling us here is
[1:24:43] that we can look back amen my when you
[1:24:47] take an absolute it leads you to a
[1:24:50] paradox but that paradox if it's
[1:24:52] according to the word of God it can
[1:24:54] become your
[1:24:57] absolute so it can Loop us right back oh
[1:25:02] that's deep Saints hallelujah how does
[1:25:06] this work out Preacher Man let's get
[1:25:08] into the word now the Bible says in the
[1:25:11] Book of Joshua which is the scripture
[1:25:13] that we read and the Lord said unto
[1:25:15] Joshua this day will I begin to magnify
[1:25:19] thee in the sight of all Israel that
[1:25:21] they may know that as I was with Moses
[1:25:24] so I will be with you yes sir yes sir
[1:25:27] let me just say right here that there
[1:25:29] comes an hour when God says I will begin
[1:25:31] to magnify
[1:25:33] you you might have gone through life and
[1:25:35] life has treated you bad you might have
[1:25:37] gone through life and life has not
[1:25:39] elevated you but there comes an hour
[1:25:42] where God says from
[1:25:43] today I'll begin to magnify you oh let
[1:25:47] me just prophesy right in here and say
[1:25:49] from today somebody's lying
[1:25:53] God is going to begin to magnify it I
[1:25:55] don't know who can say Amen to it who
[1:25:58] can say that is my
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:02] portion
[1:26:03] Hallelujah but God says to Joshua how am
[1:26:07] I going to magnify you he says to Joshua
[1:26:09] the way I'm going to magnify you is I'm
[1:26:12] going to let you take the word so you
[1:26:14] take the
[1:26:16] ark and thou shalt command the priest
[1:26:18] that bear the Ark of the Covenant right
[1:26:21] saying when you come to the brink of the
[1:26:23] water of Jordan you shall stand still in
[1:26:26] Jordan right is that right right so the
[1:26:29] way God is going to magnify is by you
[1:26:32] taking an
[1:26:34] absolute because the ark is representing
[1:26:36] the word isn't it so you take the word
[1:26:39] Joshua get the priest to go with the
[1:26:41] word into the water so put the word
[1:26:44] ahead of you and as you put the word
[1:26:46] ahead of you the word will produce a
[1:26:49] paradox and the Paradox is what is going
[1:26:52] to magnify you yes sir
[1:26:55] hallelujah oh glory to God so right here
[1:26:59] I can as well say when God is about to
[1:27:01] magnify you he causes a paradox to come
[1:27:04] in your life and the Paradox is what
[1:27:07] magnifies you when people have said
[1:27:10] where is his God where is your God but
[1:27:14] when God answers with the power when God
[1:27:16] answers with a paradox when God shows
[1:27:20] that I am with you that par
[1:27:22] will begin to magnify you oh glory to
[1:27:26] God God send some paradoxes into the
[1:27:30] Church of the Living God that the people
[1:27:32] might know that there is a God in spirit
[1:27:35] and Truth
[1:27:36] Tabernacle we need the power of God uh
[1:27:40] to show us that there is a God that
[1:27:42] moves around us uh when the Paradox
[1:27:44] happens the Paradox magnifies you can
[1:27:48] you say Amen oh can we believe that the
[1:27:51] season of magnification is here today
[1:27:55] can we believe that the season of
[1:27:57] paradoxes is here today or you can have
[1:28:00] it if you believe it you can accept it
[1:28:03] and say yes I believe it and God will
[1:28:06] bring it your way Hallelujah so when
[1:28:08] they took the absolute they went over
[1:28:10] Jordan and they started to cross over
[1:28:13] Jordan they stepped into the water and
[1:28:15] the Waters of Jordan they parted that's
[1:28:18] right so the Ark produced a paradox
[1:28:21] right is that right right so taking the
[1:28:24] absolute it led them to a paradox but
[1:28:27] the scripture does not stop there then
[1:28:30] the scripture goes on and it
[1:28:33] says in Joshua chapter
[1:28:36] 1 and it came to pass when all the
[1:28:39] people were clean pasted over Jordan
[1:28:42] that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying
[1:28:45] take you 12 men out of the people out of
[1:28:48] every tribe and command ye them saying
[1:28:51] take your hands out of the midst of
[1:28:53] Jordan out of the place where the priest
[1:28:55] fit stood fam 12 Stones and you shall
[1:28:58] carry them over with you and leave them
[1:29:00] in the lodging place where you shall
[1:29:02] Lodge this
[1:29:04] night so God says to Joshua Now command
[1:29:09] that you get C out of every tribe let
[1:29:12] them get 12 Stones from the midst of the
[1:29:15] Jordan in other words whilst the Paradox
[1:29:18] is in session whilst the Waters of
[1:29:21] Jordan have departed whilst the people
[1:29:23] are standing on dry ground now you
[1:29:26] command these leaders of these tribes to
[1:29:29] go into the River Jordan let them pick
[1:29:32] up some Stones now these are not just
[1:29:34] Stones because he says Peck them on your
[1:29:37] shoulder the strongest part of a man so
[1:29:40] these were real big borders is that
[1:29:43] right so God says command them let them
[1:29:46] go into the midst of the River Jordan
[1:29:48] and let them take the stones and let
[1:29:50] them carry them to the place where you
[1:29:52] shall lodge tonight but why are they
[1:29:55] doing this verse number six that this
[1:29:59] may be a sign among you that when your
[1:30:02] children ask their fathers in the time
[1:30:05] to come saying what mean ye by these
[1:30:07] stores then you shall answer them that
[1:30:10] the Waters of Jordan were cut off before
[1:30:13] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when
[1:30:15] it passed over Jordan the Waters of
[1:30:17] Jordan were cut off and these Stones
[1:30:19] shall be a memorial for a memorial and
[1:30:21] to the children of Israel
[1:30:24] forever now let me just explain the
[1:30:27] Saints so Joshua is commanded you take
[1:30:30] 12 Stones out of there you took the word
[1:30:34] and you let the the absolute lead the
[1:30:36] way and the absolute produced a paradox
[1:30:40] now whilst the Paradox is in ination now
[1:30:43] you take stones from the Paradox because
[1:30:47] a few moments after that the Paradox is
[1:30:50] going to close River Jordan shall flood
[1:30:53] again but when it floods you have had
[1:30:57] evidence Oh Glory to
[1:30:59] God that you passed on dry ground now
[1:31:03] you keep that evidence and you take that
[1:31:06] praise be to God and go ah and put it in
[1:31:08] the camp where you are now going to stay
[1:31:11] overnight why are you doing it then God
[1:31:13] says that it might be for a memorial
[1:31:17] that when your children shall ask you
[1:31:19] you can say to them we walked over dry
[1:31:22] ground across the river Jordan praise be
[1:31:25] to God in the high so what was God
[1:31:28] saying God was saying right when the
[1:31:30] Paradox is in session now you take these
[1:31:33] stones and bring them into the camp let
[1:31:36] your children ask you in the future
[1:31:38] bring them back to these
[1:31:40] stones and say son you look at these
[1:31:43] Stones Oh Glory to God these Stones they
[1:31:47] were not here before they came from the
[1:31:50] midst of the River Jordan
[1:31:52] when we pass through the River Jordan so
[1:31:54] the god that parted the River Jordan is
[1:31:57] a living God because by this
[1:32:01] evidence I can tell you that we passed
[1:32:03] over the river
[1:32:04] Jordan and as they begin to tell them
[1:32:07] about those stones Hallelujah the stones
[1:32:10] Hallelujah will begin to raise the faith
[1:32:12] in the children so the stones will begin
[1:32:15] to preach a message even unto the
[1:32:18] children uh the Bible says faith cometh
[1:32:21] by hearing hearing by the word but now
[1:32:24] Faith is coming by
[1:32:27] looking so in other words when you're
[1:32:29] looking at the stones the stones are
[1:32:31] going to preach a silent message and the
[1:32:35] silent message is the god that ped the
[1:32:37] River Jordan he's a living God then you
[1:32:41] can say where is the god of Joshua where
[1:32:44] is the god that ped the River Jordan so
[1:32:47] the stones will become preachers
[1:32:50] Hallelujah
[1:32:53] they will preach a message it can be
[1:32:55] done they will preach a message River
[1:32:58] Jordan is crossable they will preach a
[1:33:01] message Hallelujah so yes you parted the
[1:33:04] River Jordan It produced an absolute but
[1:33:07] that absolute now it must become a
[1:33:11] manifested
[1:33:12] absolute this was an absolute word but
[1:33:16] the absolute word then changes to become
[1:33:18] a manifested
[1:33:20] absolute
[1:33:22] Hallelujah and I like it when we come to
[1:33:24] a manifested absolute because now we are
[1:33:27] not talking Theory we are now talking
[1:33:30] evidence to say God said but this is
[1:33:35] that which the Lord God spoke
[1:33:40] about Oh Glory to
[1:33:42] God this here is
[1:33:47] that that God spoke about Oh Glory to
[1:33:51] God in the highest this is now a
[1:33:54] manifested attribute a manifested
[1:33:57] absolute rather that was the word the
[1:34:00] word told us to go through the River
[1:34:01] Jordan but this year is the evidence
[1:34:05] that the word came to pass yes oh
[1:34:08] brother when you come to this is that
[1:34:10] that is the highest form of the word of
[1:34:12] God can you say Amen because in the
[1:34:15] Bible the book in the book of Acts
[1:34:17] chapter 2 the Bible tells us of the
[1:34:19] story of Joel that Peter is courting it
[1:34:22] says Joel said and it shall come to pass
[1:34:25] in the last days sayth the Lord I'll
[1:34:28] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:34:30] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:34:31] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:34:33] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:34:35] dreams but in ex chapter 2: 16 Peter
[1:34:39] said this is
[1:34:43] that this was prophesy here but what you
[1:34:47] are looking at now oh glory to God this
[1:34:52] is that oh Hallelujah in other words the
[1:34:56] word has become
[1:34:59] flesh the word has
[1:35:01] materialized the word has manifested
[1:35:04] itself glory to God in the highest so
[1:35:07] the word church is got to come to a
[1:35:10] place where it becomes the manifested
[1:35:13] word are you with me and when it becomes
[1:35:16] a manifested word that becomes your
[1:35:20] absolute amen amen amen so now we can go
[1:35:23] back to our
[1:35:24] Loop we have an absolute it leads you to
[1:35:28] a paradox but the Paradox takes you back
[1:35:32] and the the Paradox takes you back to
[1:35:35] becom an absolute and we can run this
[1:35:38] pattern right through the
[1:35:39] Bible amen because we can look at even
[1:35:43] the children of Israel sir God had given
[1:35:46] a prophecy in the Book of Genesis that
[1:35:48] the Seed of Abraham shall so Jour in a
[1:35:51] strength land for 400 years and God says
[1:35:54] after 400 years I will come down and I
[1:35:57] will deliver them amen so we had the
[1:36:00] word then hallelujah and that word gave
[1:36:03] a promise this children of Israel will
[1:36:06] be in Egypt for 400 years but after 400
[1:36:09] years I'll deliver them with a mighty
[1:36:11] hand is the word
[1:36:13] prophesying is that right is the
[1:36:15] absolute that is spoken yes sir is that
[1:36:18] right but when the hour of the
[1:36:20] Deliverance came then what did God do
[1:36:23] then God comes in Exodus chapter number
[1:36:25] three praise the Lord and he meets Moses
[1:36:28] by a bing Bush yes and he says I've
[1:36:31] heard the crowning of my people and I've
[1:36:33] come down to deliver them now you go and
[1:36:36] take them out of the land of Egypt so
[1:36:38] Moses sees now a paradox right is that
[1:36:42] right yes sir but what was that Paradox
[1:36:45] it was in the form of a Benning
[1:36:47] Bush all right is that right yes sir
[1:36:50] because the promise produced a paradox
[1:36:52] and the Paradox was God stepping down
[1:36:55] from Glory coming upon Mount HB
[1:36:58] Hallelujah in a burning bush glory and
[1:37:01] he saw a bush that was burning but the
[1:37:03] Bush was not getting consumed a paradox
[1:37:06] right brother and he says there is a
[1:37:08] paradox here let me stop and see the
[1:37:10] Paradox is that right and when he
[1:37:13] stopped to see the Paradox then out of
[1:37:15] the Paradox came a
[1:37:17] voice yes sir so the Paradox changes to
[1:37:20] become a word all
[1:37:22] right oh glory to God the voice came out
[1:37:26] of the Paradox and when the voice came
[1:37:28] out of the Paradox the Paradox became a
[1:37:31] word can you say amen I have seen the
[1:37:34] Affliction of my people and I've come
[1:37:36] down to deliver them the word coming out
[1:37:39] of the pillar of fire the Paradox that
[1:37:42] Moses was looking at Hallelujah Glory
[1:37:45] then the prophet of God says Moses
[1:37:48] hidden absolute when he met that burning
[1:37:50] bush that was an absolute to him
[1:37:54] right so what became the absolute the
[1:37:57] burning bush right right amen not the
[1:38:01] word but the burning bush so the burning
[1:38:05] bush became an absolute Hallelujah so
[1:38:09] the word had given a promise the promise
[1:38:12] produced a paradox but the Paradox which
[1:38:14] was in a burning bush it became an
[1:38:16] absolute to Moses and the prophet says
[1:38:19] that became an absolute that's right not
[1:38:22] only did it become an absolute in the
[1:38:23] burning bush but the very same God then
[1:38:25] spoke to Moses and he says I'm giving
[1:38:28] you this as a token right you shall come
[1:38:31] back onto this mountain and you shall
[1:38:33] save me on this mountain it became a
[1:38:36] token unto Moses the absolute Hallelujah
[1:38:40] it became Hal the Paradox became an
[1:38:42] absolute to lead Moses back to
[1:38:46] it so it looks right back is that right
[1:38:50] let me let me give you another
[1:38:52] example how do does God Speak To His
[1:38:55] prophets he speaks to His prophets
[1:38:57] through Visions is that right Numbers
[1:39:00] chapter 12 and he said hear now my words
[1:39:02] if there be a prophet among you I the
[1:39:04] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[1:39:06] a vision and will speak unto him in a
[1:39:08] dream is that right amen so God when he
[1:39:12] has his word his word amen it becomes a
[1:39:16] vision and the vision itself leads to a
[1:39:18] paradox right is that right
[1:39:21] so when the prophet sees a vision which
[1:39:24] is the word of God that Vision becomes a
[1:39:26] paradox when it becomes manifested is
[1:39:29] that right amen right that's why you
[1:39:31] find a man a prophet is able to talk
[1:39:34] about what is going to happen in the
[1:39:35] future and is's able to go back to what
[1:39:37] happened in the past and produces a
[1:39:40] paradox right in front of
[1:39:42] you why he's catching a vision which is
[1:39:44] the word of God and is producing a
[1:39:47] paradox by the power of that Vision true
[1:39:50] and that's why why amen the prophet of
[1:39:52] God hallelujah he could stand on those
[1:39:55] Visions yes sir but now I want to say
[1:39:58] when Visions amen have happened so many
[1:40:01] times until they repeat and repeat until
[1:40:05] you know that these Visions come from
[1:40:07] God that's right then the Visions will
[1:40:09] become an
[1:40:10] absolute Oh Glory to
[1:40:13] godj and that's what happened with the
[1:40:15] prophet isn't it he got to a place where
[1:40:17] he knew that if God gives him a vision
[1:40:20] that Vision will God
[1:40:22] speaking it was the same as in absolute
[1:40:25] that's why when the prophet saw the
[1:40:26] vision of that Silver Tip grizzly bear
[1:40:29] come on as he was going towards where
[1:40:31] the other people were he said before we
[1:40:34] get to that place we are going to kill a
[1:40:37] silver tip grizzly bear and the prophet
[1:40:39] of God says in that land there was
[1:40:41] nothing that was higher than about that
[1:40:43] height
[1:40:45] right everything was less than a
[1:40:48] feet amen amen glory
[1:40:51] less than a foot tall everything and
[1:40:53] they could see right all the way across
[1:40:55] to where brother biscow and them were
[1:40:58] and this man that was walking with the
[1:41:00] prophet he started to speak to brother
[1:41:02] Branham and he said brother Branham did
[1:41:03] you say before we get to that place from
[1:41:06] here where we can see everything we are
[1:41:09] going to kill a silver tip grizzly bear
[1:41:12] and brother Bram said I say so because
[1:41:15] the vision say so and the man says but I
[1:41:18] can see nothing here brother Bram we can
[1:41:21] see where they are we can see where we
[1:41:23] are and there is no Silver Tip here and
[1:41:25] brother Bram turned to that brother and
[1:41:27] he says brother are you doubting the
[1:41:29] word all right come on come on glory to
[1:41:34] God what was the prophet basing his
[1:41:36] faith on that the vision was in
[1:41:39] absolute if there is no Silver Tip there
[1:41:42] the vision is able to create one and the
[1:41:46] vision can place him right there that's
[1:41:48] right amen and he says before we get
[1:41:51] there we are going to kill one yes sir
[1:41:53] and they started walking by and he says
[1:41:55] brother branam we we only just about so
[1:41:57] many meters away from there now you say
[1:42:00] there's going to be a silver te he says
[1:42:02] hey are you doubting it Hallelujah and
[1:42:04] no sooner than the prophet has say that
[1:42:07] then he says what is
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:10] that out of nowhere stood a silver tip
[1:42:14] grizzly bear and the prophet shot it and
[1:42:17] he killed it where did it come from
[1:42:20] taking in absolute producing a paradox
[1:42:24] glory to God in the
[1:42:26] highest the prophet of God tells us of
[1:42:28] another story of a sister that was
[1:42:30] called sister nma right all right she
[1:42:33] had a girl that had gone mental amen and
[1:42:37] she wanted brother Bram to come and pray
[1:42:39] for this child then brother Bram the
[1:42:41] doctor would not allow brother Bram to
[1:42:43] come in and pray for this girl but
[1:42:45] brother Brenham ended up you know
[1:42:46] getting to be like a friend and they
[1:42:48] said a friend is coming in to see this
[1:42:50] girl and the doctor then allowed it
[1:42:52] because he wouldn't allow the prophet to
[1:42:54] come in so he walked in as a friend and
[1:42:57] as he was praying for this girl then a
[1:42:59] vision broke and the prophet announced
[1:43:01] that a vision is just broke no sooner
[1:43:04] than the prophet announced that that
[1:43:06] sister Nom grabbed the Prophet by the
[1:43:08] legs and sister Noma screamed it has
[1:43:11] never
[1:43:12] failed amen as far as she was concerned
[1:43:16] it was
[1:43:18] done yes just by the vision and the
[1:43:22] prophet of God says now what was it that
[1:43:25] little lady used that Vision as an
[1:43:30] absolute an
[1:43:32] ultimate so it gets to a place where the
[1:43:35] vision can become your
[1:43:38] absolute is that right church so we
[1:43:41] bring it back to the
[1:43:42] loop Hallelujah the vision now becomes
[1:43:46] an absolute Hallelujah give God a end of
[1:43:49] Praise somebody
[1:43:52] Hallelujah but let me come to the
[1:43:55] greatest
[1:43:56] Absolut
[1:43:57] Hallelujah the greatest Paradox that we
[1:44:01] find written in the pages of the Bible
[1:44:04] my Bible says in the Book of John
[1:44:06] chapter one in the beginning was the
[1:44:08] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:44:11] Word was God what was in the beginning
[1:44:14] the
[1:44:15] absolute right the same was in the
[1:44:18] beginning with God all things were made
[1:44:20] by him and without him was not anything
[1:44:23] made that was made what is the Bible
[1:44:25] telling us that that absolute amen was
[1:44:28] the source of all creation everything
[1:44:31] that was created it came out of that
[1:44:33] absolute is that right church so we are
[1:44:36] starting from the word and we're
[1:44:38] starting from the word and we are moving
[1:44:40] from that word which is an absolute and
[1:44:42] that absolute then becomes a creative
[1:44:44] absolute and that creative absolute then
[1:44:47] it starts creating a world is that right
[1:44:50] now when something comes out of nothing
[1:44:54] then stands a
[1:44:55] paradox because when God said let there
[1:44:58] be glory to God when there was nothing
[1:45:01] then there was something that is an
[1:45:03] absolute amen creating a paradox so the
[1:45:07] word hallelujah is the scripture says
[1:45:09] all things were made by
[1:45:13] him without him was not anything made
[1:45:16] that was made so the word is the source
[1:45:19] of all creation
[1:45:21] is that right so in the beginning amen
[1:45:24] we heard the absolute which was the
[1:45:27] logos praise be to God and that absolute
[1:45:30] that was the logos amen was the creative
[1:45:33] absolute and out of it he said let there
[1:45:35] be and there was a creation and the
[1:45:38] creation was a paradox because it came
[1:45:41] out of nothing is that right yes sir but
[1:45:43] that was not the greatest Paradox amen
[1:45:46] the greatest Paradox was when that very
[1:45:48] word became flesh
[1:45:51] because the Bible then says in John 1:4
[1:45:54] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:45:57] amongst us that's it that's it amen am
[1:46:01] he was in the world and the world was
[1:46:03] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:46:07] church that is a
[1:46:09] paradox how the god of creation how the
[1:46:13] god that created all can step into his
[1:46:16] own creation yes sir let me give you an
[1:46:19] example there is a guy that made that
[1:46:21] computer right computers can do very
[1:46:23] powerful things these days yes sir
[1:46:25] especially with artificial intelligence
[1:46:27] and everything they can do a whole lot
[1:46:30] of things these days but I give you to
[1:46:32] understand the guy that made that
[1:46:33] computer is not inside of that
[1:46:37] computer he's above and beyond that
[1:46:39] computer he cannot be in that computer
[1:46:42] because to make that computer he has to
[1:46:44] be outside of that computer but think
[1:46:47] about it that the guy that makes the
[1:46:50] computer computer changes himself to
[1:46:52] become a chip all right and he becomes
[1:46:56] part of the computer moving the elements
[1:46:59] inside of the
[1:47:01] computer and then he says and he became
[1:47:04] part of the computer and he was a chip
[1:47:07] in the computer right all things were
[1:47:09] made by him all right and yet they did
[1:47:13] not realize that he was part of
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:16] them the god of creation oh my yes he
[1:47:21] created all things but he stepped down
[1:47:23] from his glory to become part of the
[1:47:26] creation and we did not know him what a
[1:47:29] paradox that was so the greatest Paradox
[1:47:33] that ever existed Hallelujah it is when
[1:47:36] God became flesh when the word was made
[1:47:40] flesh when the god of creation became a
[1:47:43] creation and stepped into his own
[1:47:45] creation what a paradox that was yes sir
[1:47:49] amen but when that Paradox was now in
[1:47:51] flesh then as he was walking in the sins
[1:47:54] of Galilee think about it Church the god
[1:47:57] of Heaven Come On The God Who created
[1:48:00] the sins come on he's walking on top of
[1:48:02] the sints Oh Glory to God right he
[1:48:06] stepped down from his glory to become
[1:48:09] part of that creation but one day as
[1:48:12] he's walking on those SS then he opens
[1:48:14] his
[1:48:16] mouth and he says a s went out to S yeah
[1:48:20] Oh Glory to God that Paradox is changing
[1:48:24] form to become the
[1:48:27] words because when he begins to speak
[1:48:29] what is proceeding out of his mouth is
[1:48:32] no longer the Paradox but it is now the
[1:48:34] absolute all right all right
[1:48:37] amen unless you eat my flesh and drink
[1:48:41] my blood you have no part in me that
[1:48:43] became the word of the Living God the
[1:48:46] Paradox spoke and the Paradox changed to
[1:48:49] become the
[1:48:52] Absolut so we can Loop it back and we
[1:48:54] can say that Paradox he became the word
[1:48:58] and the word became our
[1:49:00] absolute now we can read back the
[1:49:02] prophet and the prophet says the word of
[1:49:04] God is our absolute give God a end of
[1:49:08] Praise right
[1:49:09] [Applause]
[1:49:11] there so we look
[1:49:14] back from a paradox to an
[1:49:17] absolute but that's not how the story
[1:49:19] ends
[1:49:20] right oh glory to God because when he
[1:49:24] was walking here praise be to God then
[1:49:27] one day in John chapter 16 he says
[1:49:30] nevertheless I tell you it is expedient
[1:49:32] for you that I go away for if I go not
[1:49:36] away the comforter will not come unto
[1:49:39] you Hallelujah so the absolute spoke and
[1:49:43] he says yeah it is needful that I go
[1:49:45] away because if I don't I will not come
[1:49:48] back unto you so now now we have a
[1:49:50] promise what is the promise that the
[1:49:53] comfort is going to come inside you and
[1:49:56] I oh glory to God that God who is an
[1:50:00] absolute is going to step back and come
[1:50:03] in your flesh and in my flesh why that
[1:50:06] Colossians chapter 1:27 might be
[1:50:09] fulfilled to whom God would make known
[1:50:12] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:50:14] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:50:16] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:50:20] Christ in you the hope of glory this is
[1:50:24] the promise of the absolute stepping
[1:50:27] down from Glory coming inside the Flesh
[1:50:30] of an individual the same one that said
[1:50:32] let there be coming inside of your flesh
[1:50:35] and my flesh the very God Of Heaven not
[1:50:38] another that's it are you hearing me to
[1:50:42] say are you hearing me church not
[1:50:45] another but the very same God the god of
[1:50:49] creation stepping down from Glory
[1:50:52] stepping into your flesh stepping into
[1:50:55] my flesh changing us to become
[1:50:59] paradoxes Christ in you the hope of
[1:51:03] glory Christ in you your converter to
[1:51:07] become a
[1:51:08] paradox and the prophet of God says for
[1:51:10] instance I believe that every Born Again
[1:51:13] member of the body of Christ is a
[1:51:15] paradox in themselves amen because
[1:51:18] something happened to you that Chang
[1:51:20] your whole being anyone could look at
[1:51:22] that and know what a paradox is is a
[1:51:25] miracle unless that happens you cannot
[1:51:28] be a Christian there must be a paradox
[1:51:31] for you to become a Christian so when
[1:51:33] you become a Christian when you are
[1:51:35] converted you have become a paradox oh
[1:51:38] let me say I'm looking at paradoxes
[1:51:41] Hallelujah do I have some Born Again
[1:51:43] Believers here lift up your hands if
[1:51:46] you're born again then I want to say you
[1:51:48] are a paradox you are a
[1:51:51] miracle Hallelujah you looking for
[1:51:54] miracles you are looking at Miracles
[1:51:56] right now you're looking out where is a
[1:51:58] miracle I a
[1:52:00] miracle you are a miracle because if you
[1:52:04] are a son of God then you are a miracle
[1:52:07] and let me tell you once a miracle
[1:52:09] always a
[1:52:10] miracle Miracles will always come to you
[1:52:14] you will attract Miracles because your
[1:52:16] name is Miracle your second nature is
[1:52:19] Miracle
[1:52:20] miracles happen by you all the time
[1:52:24] that's who you are praise be to God in
[1:52:27] the highest so Miracles are not going to
[1:52:29] happen somewhere else Miracles will
[1:52:31] happen in the bride Miracles will happen
[1:52:34] in those that have been born again can
[1:52:37] you say amen amen so we take the word of
[1:52:40] God and as we take the word of God the
[1:52:43] word comes to the bride and what happens
[1:52:45] when the word comes to the bride it
[1:52:48] produces a paradox the bride becomes a
[1:52:51] paradox are you with me this afternoon
[1:52:54] you are God's Paradox when God is inside
[1:52:58] of you you are a performer of Miracles
[1:53:01] yes oh glory to God Miracles follow you
[1:53:06] Hallelujah therefore let me say healing
[1:53:08] is yours let me say restoration is yours
[1:53:12] let me say salvation is yours let me say
[1:53:14] your heart's desire is yours oh it's
[1:53:17] already inside of you it's going to come
[1:53:20] from somewhere it's already in you even
[1:53:24] as I'm speaking right now it's already
[1:53:26] resident in you it's not going to come
[1:53:29] from Glory it's already inside of you
[1:53:32] believer th this when mother egole came
[1:53:35] down Mama igle did not come to convert
[1:53:38] that little iglet to become an egole
[1:53:41] Mama egole came to awaken the little
[1:53:43] iglet he says you are not a chicken you
[1:53:47] are an eagle and he says me the way I
[1:53:50] look he says look carefully the way you
[1:53:52] look you don't look like the world you
[1:53:55] are different from the world there is a
[1:53:57] power inside of you that can rise above
[1:54:00] the storms I don't know who I'm speaking
[1:54:02] to this afternoon but you are not a
[1:54:04] chicken you are bound for the highs you
[1:54:07] are bound for the skies you are bound
[1:54:10] above the storms you can rise High even
[1:54:13] this very afternoon uh you can rise
[1:54:16] above your situation uh can you say amen
[1:54:19] amen you are a paradox therefore expect
[1:54:23] paradoxes to happen in your life I don't
[1:54:26] know who said what to you but I'm saying
[1:54:29] forget that listen to what God is saying
[1:54:31] to you God is about to change your life
[1:54:35] God is going to change your
[1:54:36] circumstances God is going to bring you
[1:54:38] to what he wants you to be God is going
[1:54:40] to change you to what he wants you to
[1:54:43] come to give God a hand of
[1:54:46] praise and somebody says how is it going
[1:54:48] to happen I don't know but I can only
[1:54:51] say
[1:54:53] paradoxically he's going to do it by a
[1:54:56] paradox
[1:54:58] unbelievable but yet it is so looks like
[1:55:01] it can be but yet it will be so oh give
[1:55:05] God a hand of Praise oh I love the word
[1:55:08] of the Living God Amen then the Bible
[1:55:12] says how be it when he the spirit of
[1:55:16] Truth is come he will guide you into Old
[1:55:22] truth now watch what is happening here
[1:55:24] when the spirit of truth that makes you
[1:55:27] a paradox when it comes in you he will
[1:55:30] guide you into all truth what is truth I
[1:55:34] am the way the truth and the life what
[1:55:36] is truth sanctify them through the truth
[1:55:39] Thy word is the truth yes sir yes sir
[1:55:43] what is the truth the truth is the word
[1:55:45] so when the absolute amen becomes a
[1:55:48] paradox in you you then the Paradox in
[1:55:51] you leads you into truth so now inside
[1:55:54] of you comes a
[1:55:57] truth yes sir Oh Glory to God when we
[1:56:01] eat the words we are being converted yes
[1:56:04] sir from being
[1:56:06] paradoxes to being
[1:56:08] absolutes
[1:56:11] Hallelujah are you hearing me church
[1:56:14] when you eat the word you have already
[1:56:16] become a paradox by the Holy Ghost but
[1:56:19] now are eating the word why are you
[1:56:21] eating the word to become the
[1:56:24] word and when you become the word what
[1:56:27] is the word is an absolute so when the
[1:56:30] bride is the word then the bride becomes
[1:56:33] an
[1:56:34] absolute looks like it can be but yet it
[1:56:37] is so I'm looking at an absolute now the
[1:56:41] Church of the Living God the Bride of
[1:56:44] Jesus Christ it can be an absolute looks
[1:56:47] like it can be but yet is s
[1:56:51] Hallelujah that's why it's a paradox
[1:56:54] absolute because it looks like it can be
[1:56:57] but yet it is so oh glory to God oh
[1:57:02] glory to God I'm looking at now living
[1:57:07] absolute why do I say so because I hear
[1:57:10] the prophet of God say in Christ The
[1:57:12] Mystery of God he says notice being
[1:57:15] personally identified by the original
[1:57:18] headship we have the answer to the
[1:57:22] devil's
[1:57:24] question amen how can we be an answer to
[1:57:28] the devil's question unless we have the
[1:57:30] word amen unless we become the word the
[1:57:33] only answer to the devil is the word
[1:57:36] when the devil came to the Lord Jesus
[1:57:38] Christ how did he defeat him it is
[1:57:41] written it is written it is written how
[1:57:45] can you become an answer to the devil
[1:57:47] when you speak it is written when you
[1:57:49] become the word then you are an answer
[1:57:52] to the devil's question oh I have a
[1:57:55] question for you can this word leave
[1:57:58] again yes it can inside of you and I can
[1:58:03] paradoxes happen again yes they can
[1:58:07] inside the Church of the Living God can
[1:58:09] the sick still get healed yes they are
[1:58:12] getting healed can someone receive the
[1:58:14] Holy Ghost yes they can still receive
[1:58:16] the Holy Ghost can Miracle still happen
[1:58:19] yes they are happening every day every
[1:58:22] hour among the Church of the Living God
[1:58:25] the bride has become a paradox glory and
[1:58:30] from the Paradox they are the answer to
[1:58:32] the devil's question Oh Glory to God in
[1:58:36] the highest and when you become the
[1:58:38] answer to the devil's question now you
[1:58:40] can finish the work amen Christ in you
[1:58:43] the hope of glory Christ in you that
[1:58:46] makes you a paradox and you become the
[1:58:48] word and when you become the word then
[1:58:50] you can speak to
[1:58:52] situations now Romans chapter 8 can be
[1:58:55] fulfilled the manifestation of the sons
[1:58:57] of God now Mark 11:23 can be fulfilled
[1:59:01] if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:59:04] removed it is not you that is saying it
[1:59:07] but it is Christ in you the hope of
[1:59:09] glory Christ in you oh come on Church of
[1:59:12] the Living God how many says yes I've
[1:59:14] got Christ inside of me and when you
[1:59:16] have Christ inside of you that's the H
[1:59:18] of Glory
[1:59:19] Christ in you that speaks the word Let
[1:59:23] There Be and they shall be I'm going to
[1:59:27] give you 5 Seconds to speak what you
[1:59:29] will whatever it is that has been your
[1:59:31] desire you can open your mouth and let
[1:59:34] that word that is inside of you speak

[1:59:39] salvation of your children speak out the
[1:59:42] salvation of your parents uh speak out
[1:59:44] the healing of your body speak out the
[1:59:46] restoration that you need in your own
[1:59:48] life uh speak out whatever it is that

[1:59:57] hallelujah hallelujah as we are getting
[2:00:00] ready to close now let somebody move
[2:00:03] from a paradox to an
[2:00:07] absolute let somebody move from whatever
[2:00:11] situation to becoming an
[2:00:13] absolute
[2:00:15] hallelujah oh praise be to God whatever
[2:00:18] it is God can bring it your way whatever
[2:00:21] it is church God Can Make It Happen even
[2:00:25] this
[2:00:26] afternoon let me say to you Church of
[2:00:28] the Living God when God gives you a
[2:00:31] paradox God wants you to capture that
[2:00:35] moment I'm getting ready to
[2:00:38] close when God gives you a paradox God
[2:00:42] wants you to capture that moment why
[2:00:45] does God want you to capture that moment
[2:00:47] because evil days can come yes and when
[2:00:50] evil days come the devil will tell you
[2:00:52] God is not with you the devil will tell
[2:00:55] you God has already left you you were
[2:00:57] never a daughter of God anyhow but
[2:00:59] brother if you capture the moment of a
[2:01:01] paradox it's like those stones you can
[2:01:04] go back to them and say where is the God
[2:01:08] of this miracle where is the God of this
[2:01:12] situation so God wants you to capture
[2:01:14] those moments are you with me the Bible
[2:01:17] tells me of Jacob when he was called to
[2:01:20] go to partner Aram Amen to go look for a
[2:01:22] wife he passed through a place that was
[2:01:24] called L is that right yes sir when he
[2:01:27] got to that place he slept at that place
[2:01:29] and he took a rock for a for a pillow
[2:01:32] and as he slept on that rock then he saw
[2:01:34] a lad that was connected to Heaven
[2:01:37] Angels ascending and descending from
[2:01:39] that lad and then Abra sorry Jacob said
[2:01:43] surely this is the Gate of
[2:01:46] Heaven and when he woke up then what did
[2:01:49] he do he took that same stone that was a
[2:01:52] pillow and he turned into a pillar right
[2:01:55] yeah and he set it up there and he
[2:01:57] poured oil on it he has captured the
[2:02:01] moment he has a memorial for the moment
[2:02:05] then he goes up for many years to the
[2:02:07] place of Laban and after many years then
[2:02:09] he comes back he meets God AEL yes then
[2:02:13] God leads him back amen he stays in
[2:02:15] another place for a while but I believe
[2:02:17] it's in EX in in in in Genesis chter 35
[2:02:20] then the Bible says God spoke to Jacob
[2:02:23] and he says arise and go to battle that
[2:02:27] place where I met
[2:02:29] you where you put up that pillar for a
[2:02:32] stone arise and go back to that place go
[2:02:36] to that moment that you captured go to
[2:02:38] that place where you knew that God is a
[2:02:41] reality go to that place where you knew
[2:02:44] that the miracle working God is a living
[2:02:47] God I want to say to you to somebody
[2:02:49] here have you ever had a
[2:02:52] miracle how many have ever had a miracle
[2:02:54] in their lives I want you to capture
[2:02:57] that moment when the devil Rises up in
[2:02:59] your life take him back there and say
[2:03:02] Satan who is
[2:03:05] it Hallelujah if you have a photo go
[2:03:08] take your
[2:03:09] photo if you wrote it in a diary go pick
[2:03:12] up your diary and say Satan let's read
[2:03:15] my diary who is it that came here who is
[2:03:19] it that was in this situation who is it
[2:03:22] that came in this situation who is it
[2:03:24] that came in my child when I prayed on
[2:03:27] that day who is it that came in that
[2:03:29] church when the preacher preached that
[2:03:31] sermon who is it that spoke to my heart
[2:03:34] brother as you carry on like that Satan
[2:03:36] will flee away from you resist the devil
[2:03:40] and he will flee away from you can you
[2:03:43] say Amen so God wants those paradoxes to
[2:03:47] become your absolute so I'll ask again
[2:03:50] how many have ever had a
[2:03:52] miracle if you have ever had a miracle
[2:03:54] that can become your absolute the god of
[2:03:57] that Miracle can be the god of another
[2:04:00] situation the god of that Miracle he can
[2:04:03] produce himself here again if God gave
[2:04:06] you the Holy Ghost he can give you again
[2:04:09] if God once healed you he can heal you
[2:04:11] again if God wants redeemed you he can
[2:04:14] redeem you again if God wants restor the
[2:04:17] situation he can restore again
[2:04:19] so let there be a
[2:04:21] paradox let there be a paradox how many
[2:04:24] have ever believed in a paradox the god
[2:04:27] of a miracle can wake it again the devil
[2:04:30] is a liar whatever he stole from you we
[2:04:33] giving it back to you even this very
[2:04:36] afternoon yes God can
[2:04:39] deliver yes God can restore yes God can
[2:04:43] redeem yes God can heal give God a hand

[2:06:12] you see we we receive a Word of Promise
[2:06:15] amen that word is our absolute and it
[2:06:18] leads us to our Paradox and then from
[2:06:21] our Paradox we go right back to the word

[2:06:26] Miracle after Miracle after Miracle

[2:06:56] and you know really and sometimes it's
[2:06:58] hard for us to believe this but the
[2:07:00] greatest amen um uh Paradox is what God
[2:07:04] has done in your
[2:07:06] life amen we were born in sin we were we
[2:07:10] were we we were shaped in iniquity come
[2:07:12] into the world speaking lies but what
[2:07:14] God has done in our life is a great
[2:07:17] paradox Paradox is so great and I just
[2:07:20] like it I mean he he started how uh with
[2:07:23] that testimony of um brother Tony that

[2:07:36] him find it brother Brandon was under
[2:07:38] the under pressure what do I do the
[2:07:40] brother they not going to believe me if
[2:07:42] it don't find God said what is that to

[2:08:15] to speak the spirit and the bride s come

[2:14:47] remember the person that wrote that song
[2:14:49] but you know
[2:14:52] um only
[2:14:55] Believers can tap into a realm like that
[2:14:58] where it's not just a song but it
[2:15:00] becomes a manifested
[2:15:03] absolute right um you know and they
[2:15:06] people see different scriptures they
[2:15:07] might get inspired by but when it
[2:15:09] becomes manifested when it comes amen uh
[2:15:12] made real in your life right then it's
[2:15:15] then it's reality and and only the
[2:15:18] Believers can take a song like that and

[2:15:25] spoke
[2:15:28] sir I'm I'm going to have it and and and
[2:15:30] and it's it's a you you you actually
[2:15:33] with you being the absolute you have a
[2:15:35] absolute faith that there is nothing the
[2:15:39] devil can
[2:15:41] do to stop you from getting what God has
[2:15:45] promised
[2:15:46] you that's the ain't nothing the devil
[2:15:50] can do ain't nothing a doctor can
[2:15:53] say
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:15:59] right we we we we we went last night to
[2:16:02] pray for a a
[2:16:05] sister and when we went to the house you
[2:16:08] know we we we looked at our our sister
[2:16:11] and and um you know just the enemy just
[2:16:14] attacking a body with cancer and and um
[2:16:18] you know I I was I was going in and went
[2:16:21] with uh three other brothers and and and
[2:16:25] and as we were just there and just
[2:16:26] ministering to her and and you know the
[2:16:29] the doctors have told her um they don't
[2:16:31] give her much time and anytime doctors
[2:16:33] say that we know that they have reached
[2:16:35] their their
[2:16:36] limit uh but
[2:16:39] God don't have a
[2:16:42] limit and we uh we just read some
[2:16:46] scriptures over her and and we we prayed
[2:16:48] over her and you know just felt the real
[2:16:50] anointing just kind of come into the
[2:16:51] room and and uh you know even we just
[2:16:54] remember the scripture that even Abraham
[2:16:57] when he was against
[2:16:58] hope the Bible says he still believed in
[2:17:02] Hope amen and uh you know that means
[2:17:04] Abraham had an
[2:17:06] absolute right and and as Believers
[2:17:08] that's what we got to have sometime no
[2:17:10] matter what we're going through an
[2:17:11] Absolut is what the word of God tells us
[2:17:14] and I was just quoting over her you know
[2:17:16] just scriptures and I said your husband
[2:17:17] reached out to us and and wanted us to
[2:17:19] you know to to he he didn't and he
[2:17:21] didn't say come he just said pray for my
[2:17:23] my my wife well what that meant to me
[2:17:25] please come by and pray that's what I
[2:17:28] interpreted and he told his wife he he
[2:17:30] say he say anytime I call they come this
[2:17:32] is genuine Christianity right here and
[2:17:35] uh and we went in just with the brothers
[2:17:37] and you know and I said you know the
[2:17:38] scripture just tells us we all we got to
[2:17:40] do is come um you know and lay hands on
[2:17:43] the sick we anoint you with oil in the
[2:17:46] name of the Lord and his name name is
[2:17:48] Jesus Christ we anoint you in the name
[2:17:50] of the Lord and and the Bible say the
[2:17:51] prayer of faith will save the sick and
[2:17:54] the Lord will raise up the God didn't
[2:17:55] say what the condition had to
[2:17:57] be he he didn't put stipulations in the
[2:18:01] contract right amen he just say just
[2:18:03] just just just you pray for him and let
[2:18:05] the prayer of faith say pray over the
[2:18:07] sick say and the Lord
[2:18:10] will raise them up I said that's what
[2:18:13] God promised us we're going to do
[2:18:14] exactly what God told us to do and after
[2:18:16] I finish praying looked around I said oh
[2:18:18] my I said you know it's it's four of us
[2:18:21] that come I didn't catch that before but

[2:21:57] absolute God just the promise itself is

[2:22:02] devil can do to stop a promise from
[2:22:03] coming to pass my God lord I I just was
