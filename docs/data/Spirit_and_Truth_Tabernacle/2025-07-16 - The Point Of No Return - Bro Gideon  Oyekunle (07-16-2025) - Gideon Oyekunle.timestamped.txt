[6:52] &gt;&gt; Right. We read John chapter 6 from verse
[6:55] 66.
[6:58] John 6 from verse 66.
[7:06] From that time many of his disciples
[7:10] went back and walked no more with him.
[7:14] Then said Jesus unto the 12, "Will ye
[7:18] also go away?" Then Simon Peter answered
[7:23] him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou
[7:27] has the words of eternal life. And we
[7:31] believe and assure that thou art that
[7:34] Christ, the son of the living God. Amen.
[7:40] Revelation 10.
[7:46] I read
[7:49] verse seven.
[7:56] Revelation 10:7 says,
[7:59] "But in the days of the voice of the
[8:01] seventh angel, when it shall begin to
[8:05] sound, the mystery of God shall be
[8:08] finished as he had declared to his
[8:10] servants the prophet." Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you and may the Lord
[8:16] bless the reading of his holy word.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[8:25] All right. So this evening we want to
[8:28] speak on the subject uh that I title
[8:31] here the point of no return.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The point of no return.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] Now we find out you know from the holy
[8:42] scripture that we have read and they
[8:45] taking you know the entire scripture you
[8:47] know the ministry of our lord Jesus
[8:49] Christ.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; We find out that when Jesus Christ
[8:53] started his ministry he was healing the
[8:56] sick.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; He was raising the dead. He was feeding
[8:59] the poor. And the Bible said that his
[9:02] fame went throughout all the regions and
[9:06] even abroad, even down unto Syria until
[9:10] the Bible said, you know, that Jesus
[9:13] fame in Matthew 4:23
[9:16] to 25. The Bible said that Jesus fame,
[9:20] you know, went all over everywhere. So
[9:23] he was so popular
[9:25] miracles and the signs and the wonders
[9:29] are taking place in the ministry of our
[9:31] Lord Jesus Christ and the people loved
[9:34] him.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Not because of who he was but because of
[9:39] what they will benefit from him
[9:42] &gt;&gt; and that was why you know they love him
[9:44] and the great miracles you know were
[9:47] taking place. signs and wonder were
[9:49] taking place until in the book of Mark
[9:52] chapter 2 verse12 the Bible says you
[9:56] know that they said that we have never
[9:59] saw it on this version
[10:02] &gt;&gt; it was peculiar it was special the
[10:06] ministry of Christ was completely
[10:09] different from all other ministries
[10:11] they've not seen it in that version
[10:15] &gt;&gt; they have seen a lot of Pharisees and
[10:18] Sadducees and the scribes and the
[10:20] Herodians and the different
[10:22] organizations and the churches.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; They have had a lot of preacher preach.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; They have seen a lot of doctors of the
[10:32] law, you know, ministering preaching
[10:35] everywhere.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Churches, synagogues everywhere. But
[10:40] brother when Jesus started his ministry
[10:44] it was completely different from all
[10:47] other ministry they have never seen it
[10:51] in this version.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; It was completely different. It was
[10:56] unique. Hallelujah. Because it was a
[11:00] ministry sent of God.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; God ordained ministry. And the brothers
[11:07] I want you to put into your heart
[11:09] tonight because Jesus Christ is the same
[11:13] yesterday, today and forever. What he
[11:17] was yesterday, he is now and he will be
[11:21] forever. His nature has never changed.
[11:24] We are serving unchangeable God. We are
[11:27] serving God. Hallelujah. Who has the
[11:30] power. Hallelujah. Over everything. And
[11:34] his action and reaction is the same.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[11:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; What a glorious time that we are living
[11:44] in. So in this evening, church of God,
[11:48] I'm not just talking about the ministry
[11:49] of Jesus Christ yesterday.
[11:52] I'm talking about the present tense
[11:55] ministry of Jesus Christ. I'm talking
[11:59] about the ministry of Christ today.
[12:01] Hallelujah.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; They wanted him everywhere.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; In their churches,
[12:07] &gt;&gt; they wanted him everywhere. Everywhere
[12:10] they were calling for him,
[12:12] &gt;&gt; everywhere they wanted him to preach.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Until home and abroad. He has a lot of
[12:22] invitations.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; So many of them. And he has to place
[12:27] them before the father in order to make
[12:29] a decision because there were too many
[12:33] invitations.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; And Jesus the Bible said he can do
[12:37] nothing
[12:39] &gt;&gt; until the father show him. Hallelujah.
[12:41] And brother Abraham said when those
[12:43] invitation comes I pull them before God
[12:46] and I pray over them and regardless if
[12:49] it's a small church or big church it
[12:51] does not matter
[12:53] &gt;&gt; but let God do the leading
[12:56] &gt;&gt; and show him the place to go and the
[12:58] where to go and the what to say and the
[13:01] work to do. Hallelujah. Who will be in
[13:04] the mailing?
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; What will be their problem?
[13:08] &gt;&gt; The number of their house. Hallelujah.
[13:11] And the type of clo that they are going
[13:13] to wear. And the angel of the Lord will
[13:15] have to come from the right hand side of
[13:18] the altar.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And begin to say something
[13:21] about the people that were present in
[13:23] the meeting.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Before it ever happened,
[13:28] &gt;&gt; God show him.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; John 5:1 19 says, "He can do nothing
[13:34] &gt;&gt; until the father show him."
[13:37] &gt;&gt; So he show him. Yes.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; He was being shown. Amen. What is going
[13:43] to happen in the milling?
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; And brothers, the ministry was so
[13:48] popular, people wanted him everywhere
[13:51] &gt;&gt; until even Dr. Simon the Pharisee
[13:55] invited him.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was trying to do? He
[14:02] was trying to gain popularity.
[14:05] using the ministry of Jesus Christ to be
[14:07] popular.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; And then we have the same thing,
[14:10] brothers and sisters, that many of them,
[14:12] you know, invited him in order to be
[14:15] popular, in order to build their
[14:17] ministry, in order to ride on him,
[14:21] &gt;&gt; in order, hallelujah, to get the crowd
[14:24] so that when you know the poster, Amen.
[14:27] and the invitation were sent out. Then
[14:30] they can put his picture there and they
[14:33] can let the people know that Jesus
[14:36] Christ, Amen, is coming to the city.
[14:39] Yes, sir.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; And the many people will come to the
[14:42] meeting and they will buy the ticket.
[14:44] Hallelujah. And the hotel's
[14:47] reservations, you know, will be
[14:49] completely booked. Amen. And there will
[14:52] be no room. Amen. To contain the paper.
[14:55] Why? because it was a special ministry.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; I hope somebody you are with me.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[15:08] Oh, praise the Lord. Why? Because he was
[15:11] doing great thing.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; That ministry was becoming great. But
[15:15] brothers, they were doing those things.
[15:17] Amen. In order to get the crowd,
[15:20] &gt;&gt; in order to, you know, get their
[15:22] ministry to be popular. It was a spirit
[15:26] that was in them. And let me tell you
[15:29] this brothers, if you want to be popular
[15:31] is a spirit that is upon you.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; And that spirit is called pride.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; That was the spirit that was upon Simon
[15:40] the Pharisee.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; It's pride.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Pride. Hallelujah. And the a Pharisee is
[15:48] an actor. He's a proud guy. Amen. He was
[15:52] not inspired. Amen. Of God. But brother,
[15:56] he was in spy of the devil.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; That's it. The Bible says over there in
[16:02] the book of Isaiah in chapter 14:12, he
[16:06] said, "Oh Lucifer,
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because thou has said in thy
[16:11] heart,
[16:12] &gt;&gt; bride."
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same spirit of Lucifer.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; That spirit has never departed this
[16:20] earth. For Satan take his man but not
[16:24] his spirit. And the God take his man but
[16:27] not his spirit. God spirit are here
[16:30] working. They are working tonight. They
[16:33] are working everywhere. The spirit of
[16:35] pride. The spirit of the devil is
[16:38] working on her today.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] and they look at it
[16:47] trying to gain popularity
[16:49] &gt;&gt; right
[16:50] &gt;&gt; through the ministry of Jesus Christ my
[16:53] my
[16:53] &gt;&gt; pride
[16:54] &gt;&gt; right
[16:56] &gt;&gt; they just want to be big
[16:59] &gt;&gt; want the people to know them
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[17:01] &gt;&gt; and because they don't have what he had
[17:04] &gt;&gt; then they have to invite him
[17:07] &gt;&gt; and ride on his back
[17:08] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[17:10] &gt;&gt; yes sir my
[17:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah Right.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Is the spirit of the devil
[17:17] &gt;&gt; pride.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Everywhere today,
[17:21] &gt;&gt; you know, big crowd everywhere.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; You see what they did? They were doing
[17:27] those things there
[17:28] &gt;&gt; not because of who he was.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; But because of the benefit,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; what they're going to benefit from him.
[17:38] Yes sir.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; They were doing those things just
[17:40] because of that. In order to get the
[17:43] crowd,
[17:44] &gt;&gt; in order to get the crowd so they got to
[17:47] ride on him.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Pride.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; They cannot humble themselves.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; To line behind that ministry
[17:57] &gt;&gt; to support that ministry to keep on
[17:59] going with that ministry.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; They have to start something different
[18:02] you know from that ministry.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Use his name.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Wow. is a spirit
[18:10] &gt;&gt; and sometime you know people don't know
[18:11] that they are being worked on by those
[18:13] spirit
[18:16] &gt;&gt; my god brother
[18:17] &gt;&gt; because you can do nothing without an
[18:19] anointing
[18:21] &gt;&gt; so spirit has got to drive you

[18:26] there's a spirit that is driving you
[18:27] tonight there's a spirit that drove you
[18:30] here tonight there's a spirit that is
[18:32] driving every one of us tonight we are
[18:34] perfectly helpless and hopeless bless
[18:37] without the influence by the spirit.

[18:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Some spirits.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Must be driving you on.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; And that spirit
[18:54] was driving them was pride.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Pharisee.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Actor.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Brothers, that was what happened, you
[19:03] know, to Simon. The Pharisees was
[19:06] trying, you know, to get the name of
[19:08] Jesus better class of people like
[19:11] Lucifer.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham said, you know, God
[19:14] want to bless people and he want people
[19:16] that he can bless and the more he
[19:19] blesses you, the more humble you can
[19:21] become.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; And may I tell you brothers and sister,
[19:27] we are looking for the top. The prophet
[19:29] said that we know we do great things for
[19:32] us in our midst. And brother Abraham
[19:34] said that the topple will be manifested
[19:36] in our midst by humility. And that we
[19:40] got to humble ourselves in order to see
[19:42] God moving on the scene because the
[19:44] topple is not going to be you. It's not
[19:46] going to be me in action. It will be God
[19:49] in action.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; It will be super anointing in action.
[19:53] And the brother we must be perfectly
[19:56] humble. And the when we can become so
[19:58] humble, then God can reveal himself. For
[20:02] whosoever exalted himself, God will
[20:06] bring a base.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; And the way Lucifer
[20:12] exalted himself, you know, God brought
[20:14] him down to the size of the pit.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; All right.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; And the brothers, if you don't want God
[20:21] to bring you down, humble yourself.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; All right? and thou will be exalted in
[20:28] due season.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; And if you want promotion tonight,
[20:33] you've got to humble yourself.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you are working for a
[20:39] boss, the prophet of God said the more
[20:42] lawyer you are, then the boss, you know,
[20:45] can recommend you for promotion.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; So, brother, humble yourself.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Be loyal to the boss. Be loyal to God.
[20:55] Be loyal to the word of God. And him we
[20:58] are loyal to God to his word. Then God
[21:01] will have confidence in us and empower
[21:04] us. Hallelujah. And bless us the more
[21:07] and raise us up the more and lift us up
[21:10] the more.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; For the way down is up.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; And the way down I mean the way up is
[21:21] down. Right.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, church. We find out here that
[21:29] the invitations were growing and they
[21:32] kept on piling up much more. Amen. And
[21:36] he has to pull them before the father to
[21:39] decide which one to attend.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Whether a big one or a small one, it
[21:44] does not matter.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Why would the
[21:49] invitation keep coming? because they can
[21:52] see something in him.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; You know, that was completely different
[21:56] from all others.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; He fed the 4,000 there were leftover. He
[22:02] fed 5,000 there were leftovers.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; And the next time they wanted to make
[22:09] him king, the Bible said by force.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; John 6 chapter 15.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Verse 15.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; 6:15. Uh-huh.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they wanted to make
[22:22] him king by force.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; My God.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; They wanted them to be their king by
[22:28] force.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the brothers,
[22:34] remember, I'm talking about something
[22:38] that's peculiar.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Jesus Christ the same.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, today, and forever. How many
[22:48] of you believe with me?
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the ministry of this
[22:52] day.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said, he said, "And he is
[22:56] supposed to according to the scriptures
[22:59] return to us in this last day,
[23:03] &gt;&gt; right?"
[23:04] &gt;&gt; In the message one in a million,
[23:06] &gt;&gt; in this type of ministry,
[23:08] &gt;&gt; right,
[23:09] &gt;&gt; that will be after the baptism of the
[23:12] spirit
[23:13] &gt;&gt; and speaking in tongues and divine
[23:15] healings and so forth. These things the
[23:19] carping of the Pentecostal message is
[23:23] what we are speaking of today.
[23:27] This ministry
[23:29] &gt;&gt; of the Christ himself impersonated
[23:34] among his people
[23:35] &gt;&gt; with the very same things
[23:38] &gt;&gt; that he did when he was here on earth in
[23:42] his body the bride
[23:44] &gt;&gt; which is part of him
[23:46] &gt;&gt; doing the same thing
[23:49] &gt;&gt; as husband and wife and king and queen
[23:53] just before the marriage ceremony. Amen.
[23:57] Amen.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; The same ministry
[24:00] &gt;&gt; of Christ
[24:01] &gt;&gt; impersonated.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; So what are we talking about brothers
[24:09] and sister? It's not the ministry of a
[24:11] man. It's not the ministry of spirit and
[24:14] life tabernacle.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; West Palm Beach is not the ministry of
[24:19] Jagdov. It's not the ministry of Gideon
[24:21] or Yakul. It's not the ministry of any
[24:24] other.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of William.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the ministry of
[24:31] Jesus Christ himself
[24:33] &gt;&gt; impersonated among his people.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; From the message souls in prison now.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; In prag 116
[24:45] &gt;&gt; he said and I quote, he said the
[24:48] ministries
[24:50] must be the same.
[24:53] The ministries
[24:55] must be the same.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; In so much that he said, I see some of
[25:01] you writing scriptures down. St. John
[25:04] 14:12,
[25:06] he that believeth on me, the works that
[25:08] I do shall he do also. See the works,
[25:11] preaching to the lost, healing the sick,
[25:14] and then to the impossible to ever be
[25:18] saved.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[25:20] See the work went on just the same. Yes
[25:25] sir.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; So this has been
[25:29] has this been
[25:31] &gt;&gt; may I pour like this
[25:36] &gt;&gt; the ministry of Jesus Christ
[25:39] reincarnated
[25:41] &gt;&gt; in his church
[25:43] &gt;&gt; in this last day.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; That's what many of us believe. I
[25:48] believe with you the prophecy.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; I believe this.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; If I didn't believe it, I will do
[25:54] something else about it.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; All right?
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Because after all, this is me that is
[26:00] concerned in here.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God be in you, you
[26:06] are concerned about the people.
[26:07] Hallelujah.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. That's just for
[26:14] a little background tonight.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; That that is the ministry of Christ.
[26:19] Yes, sir.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of a man.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; It's not the ministry of a church.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; It's not another organization.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; But God has not sent me to build an
[26:34] organization or a denomination into a
[26:37] great organization. is able to build
[26:40] each an individual of you into the
[26:43] statue of a perfect man.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; The likeness of Christ.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; The images of Christ
[26:54] &gt;&gt; is the ministry of Christ.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Reincarnated.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Amongst his people.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. God.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. and brothers
[27:07] at that time when the people begin to
[27:09] look and they saw
[27:10] &gt;&gt; that there was something special
[27:14] &gt;&gt; and they were attracted
[27:16] &gt;&gt; yes
[27:17] &gt;&gt; at that ministry
[27:19] &gt;&gt; then what happened they said we will
[27:22] make him king
[27:24] &gt;&gt; we wanted them to be with us but brother
[27:27] that was just the first pool that was
[27:30] just the second pool and then you know
[27:33] everybody you know they They attracted
[27:34] they wanted to make him king because you
[27:38] know it was so special to them.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; But brothers he escaped. The Bible said
[27:44] John chap 6 verse1 15.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Let's see what the Bible says. John 6:15
[27:53] when Jesus therefore perceived that they
[27:56] would have come and take him by force to
[28:01] make him a king. He departed again into
[28:06] a mountain himself alone.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; My lord,
[28:10] &gt;&gt; my God,
[28:13] &gt;&gt; he departed himself alone
[28:16] &gt;&gt; into the mountain. And when he went to
[28:19] the mountain, the father begin to show
[28:22] him.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; What we become of the ministry.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; The father show him.
[28:31] The father show him that those crowd
[28:36] will begin to live.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; When he shall begin to sound.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Remember this John chapter 6, right?
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; And brothers, quickly listen to this.
[28:53] He went to the mountain and he was there
[28:56] on the mountain and the father begin to
[28:58] show him that look very soon this people
[29:01] will begin to depart.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Listen listen he said these things in
[29:07] the seventh seal
[29:09] quickly in the seventh seal.
[29:13] He said these things in paragraph 320 of
[29:16] the seventh seal. Are you here with me?
[29:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; He said what am I trying to say this for
[29:21] friends? is to show you we are the end
[29:24] time. Now if them or others is perfectly
[29:28] on the dot with the word so is this
[29:31] perfectly on the dot and with the word
[29:33] we are here we are at the hands friends.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Soon it shall be time run out. Millions
[29:39] will lose their lives. Millions will be
[29:42] that now believe that they are saved
[29:45] will be counted
[29:47] &gt;&gt; further for the atomic age. Wow.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing that?
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Millions will be that now believe that
[29:59] they are saved
[30:02] &gt;&gt; will be counted further for the atomic
[30:06] age. We are living at the last hour
[30:10] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God by his help to his
[30:13] people that they might look forward to
[30:16] the soon appearing of Christ. How long
[30:18] were Abraham? Maybe 20 years. Maybe in
[30:22] 50 years. Maybe in 100 years. I don't
[30:26] know. And maybe in the morning, maybe
[30:30] yet tonight. I don't know.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; And anybody says they do know they are
[30:37] wrong.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; See, they don't know. God only knows.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] The seventh seal,
[30:49] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord. Yes, sir.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; The hour when the coming of the Lord
[30:54] will be completed.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Completed.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Only God knows.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you it's going to be 1977.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you that
[31:11] &gt;&gt; because I don't know.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[31:15] which you know has become a serious
[31:17] matter today and the people are picking
[31:20] him up on God. Are you here? Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said I don't know
[31:27] &gt;&gt; only God knows what he said.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; What he said brother?
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; He told us that I can mix that 20 years
[31:37] 7 year 100 years. I don't know.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Only God knows. Amen. Amen. Praise God.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Noise.
[31:49] So help me by God. I tell the truth that
[31:55] these are spiritually designed to me
[31:57] designed by the Holy Spirit and by every
[32:00] one of them I identify it place in the
[32:03] Bible. Now what this great secret is
[32:07] that lays beneath the seal. I do not
[32:10] know. I don't know it. I couldn't make
[32:12] it out. I couldn't tell it just what he
[32:15] said, but I know that it was them seven
[32:20] thunders altering themselves right close
[32:22] together, just banging seven different
[32:25] times and it unfolded into something
[32:28] else that I seen. Then when I seen that,
[32:31] I looked for the interpretation.
[32:34] It flew across there and I couldn't make
[32:37] it out. That's exactly right. See, the
[32:41] hour isn't quite yet for it. Glory to
[32:45] God.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; But it's moving.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Into that cycle,
[32:50] &gt;&gt; see it's coming up close.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; So the thing for you to do is to
[32:55] remember that I speak to you in the name
[32:58] of the Lord. Be prepared.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; You don't know what time something can
[33:05] happen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. That's right. Glory.
[33:09] Hallelujah.
[33:11] Amen.
[33:14] My my my
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Now when that get on tape,
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[33:21] &gt;&gt; which it is,
[33:24] they will probably
[33:26] send 10,000 of my friends away from me.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Glory. Same thing, brother. Yes, sir.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Because
[33:43] they are going to say that brother
[33:45] Abraham is trying to put himself and
[33:47] make himself a servant or a prophet or
[33:49] something before God. Let me tell you my
[33:52] brethren, that is an error.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; I'm only telling you what I seen
[34:01] &gt;&gt; and what has been taught to me.
[34:05] And now you do whatever you want to. I
[34:09] don't know who is going who what is
[34:12] going to take place. I do not know. I
[34:15] just know that those seven thunders old
[34:18] that mystery
[34:19] &gt;&gt; the heaven was quiet. Everybody
[34:22] understand. Amen. It may be time. It may
[34:26] be the hour now that this great person
[34:29] that we are expecting to rise on the
[34:31] scene may arise on the scene. Maybe this
[34:35] ministry that I have tried to take
[34:38] people back to the word has laid a
[34:41] foundation. And if it has, I'll believe
[34:45] in you for good.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be two of us here at the
[34:48] same time.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; See, if it is, it will increase. I will
[34:53] decrease. I don't know but I have been
[34:57] privileged by God to look and see what
[35:02] it was see unfold to that much now that
[35:08] is the truth
[35:09] &gt;&gt; wonderful
[35:11] &gt;&gt; brothers that sounds like somebody else
[35:14] is coming after the prophet of God
[35:16] &gt;&gt; come on now
[35:18] &gt;&gt; come on preach
[35:21] &gt;&gt; it sounds like somebody else is coming
[35:24] after the prophet of God.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; But I sure want to tell you tonight
[35:29] &gt;&gt; that brother Abraham told us
[35:30] categorically in the message Christ is
[35:33] revealing his own word. He said there
[35:36] won't be further advancement than what
[35:40] is going on now.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He said there won't be
[35:50] further advancement than what is going
[35:54] on now.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; What father said that this message that
[36:01] I am preaching is the true message and
[36:04] the last message of this day.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:15] And that is the message
[36:17] that the father has shown to the prophet
[36:20] of God and said look is going to send
[36:24] 10,000
[36:26] &gt;&gt; of your friends away.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes brother.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; It's going to turn a lot of people that
[36:33] are not thinking or believing that they
[36:35] are saved.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; They will become
[36:38] &gt;&gt; cannon. coming father
[36:42] &gt;&gt; for the atomic age. Amen. Yes, sir.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; The father saw him all these things.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; For the first pool was healing signs and
[36:54] wonder and the second pool was the
[36:56] discernment and the prophecy. But the
[36:59] third pool was the opening of the word.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; And when the word was open, that was
[37:06] when it began to sound. Lord have mercy.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; The first pool and second pool, those
[37:16] were not the sounding of the seven
[37:19] angels message.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly right.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Those are the preliminaries.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; And that is what the first climax was
[37:28] all about. And that's why a lot of them,
[37:31] you know, they gather and they were
[37:33] sitting on the field and they were
[37:35] enjoying that message until, you know,
[37:37] they become tired
[37:40] &gt;&gt; and they started looking for biscuit
[37:45] &gt;&gt; substitute
[37:46] &gt;&gt; to the bread of life
[37:50] &gt;&gt; until the evening light begin to fall.
[37:52] until the evening shadow begin to fall
[37:55] and the evening light begin to shine and
[37:57] the intellect of God return back you
[38:00] know to the message of the dead to
[38:03] fellowship around the article of eternal
[38:07] life the things that have been hidden
[38:09] before the foundation of the world
[38:11] &gt;&gt; right amen right
[38:14] &gt;&gt; that's right
[38:15] &gt;&gt; that we give dynamics
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen
[38:18] &gt;&gt; to the mechanics of the bride
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen
[38:21] &gt;&gt; for the rapture Right.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Brothers,
[38:23] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; When it shall begin to sound, it won't
[38:29] be so many. It will be very few.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Not so many, but very few. Quickly, we
[38:37] are going to read few more quotations
[38:40] from the prophet and then we shall
[38:42] close. From the unveiling of God.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to what my prophet say.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. In prog 22 of the message, the
[38:51] unveiling of God.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. He said this and I quote, he
[38:59] said, "Now my subject this morning, I
[39:02] trust that God will reveal this and each
[39:05] time if you take the tapes and listen, I
[39:08] hope and trust that you have had a
[39:10] spiritual understanding of what that God
[39:12] has been trying to get over to the
[39:15] church without saying it right out." See
[39:18] is a thing sometime we have to say
[39:20] things in such a way that it might f
[39:23] down the crowd.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It might bring down bring some to
[39:27] go out, some to leave, some to ponder.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "But that's done purposely."
[39:34] &gt;&gt; It might it must be done that way.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some will say,
[39:39] "You mean God will purposely do a thing
[39:41] like that?" He certainly did.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; It does. Yet. He said one day when he
[39:48] had thousands around them, he said,
[39:50] "Except you eat of the flesh of the son
[39:53] of God or son of man and drink his
[39:55] blood, you have no life in your." What
[39:58] kind of a statement do you think that a
[39:59] medical or a nurse a medical doctor or a
[40:02] nurse or any fine intellectual person
[40:05] will think of a statement like that
[40:09] for a man that had a ministry like that
[40:13] like he had? Why? He will say he the
[40:16] flesh that's cannibal to drink human
[40:19] blood that is a vampire. He said in
[40:22] other words he want us to be cannibals
[40:24] and vampires. He said and the whole
[40:27] audience walked away from him.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And there was a minister ministerial
[40:36] association with him of 70
[40:39] &gt;&gt; that have been chosen. and he turned to
[40:41] them and he said, "What will you think
[40:43] when you see the son of man ascending up
[40:46] from where he come from or he came
[40:49] from?" Now, he didn't explain that. He
[40:51] never explained how Paul did that later
[40:54] on. He just said it and then went next.
[40:58] He said, "What will you say to this
[41:01] minister 17? When will you see when you
[41:04] see the son of man ascending from where
[41:06] he come from?" Now no doubt them men
[41:10] said now just a moment. Oh we he with
[41:14] him we fish with him. We sleep with him
[41:17] and we know where he was burned. He
[41:20] saying that we seen the cradle that he
[41:24] was rocking and how does this man this
[41:27] is a hard saying
[41:30] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said they didn't walk with
[41:32] him anymore.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; They left him. Then he had 12. He had
[41:38] chosen 12 and one of them was a devil.
[41:42] He said so he turned to them to them and
[41:45] there's no one could explain what he had
[41:48] just said. How are they going to heal
[41:50] his flesh and drink his blood and how
[41:51] did he came down when he was born right
[41:55] here on earth. See they couldn't
[41:58] understand.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And then he turned to the apostles and
[42:02] said do you want to go also? Come on
[42:05] now.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; And that's when Apostle Peter made that
[42:08] great statement.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, to whom shall we go?
[42:13] &gt;&gt; See, for we are satisfied.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; We know assuredly that you and you alone
[42:21] have the word of life of this hour.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[42:31] today, and forever. And so may we say
[42:35] tonight and we to whom shall we go?
[42:39] &gt;&gt; For we know
[42:41] &gt;&gt; assuredly
[42:42] &gt;&gt; that thou and thou alone have the word
[42:46] of life for this hour.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; The word of life of this hour.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And we are satisfied of that.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; So they could not explain it. You can't
[43:01] explain faith
[43:03] &gt;&gt; is something that you believe
[43:05] &gt;&gt; and is so solid that there is nothing
[43:08] else will take his place.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Therefore, they know that the word that
[43:13] was written for that age that they were
[43:16] living in the mine the meic age
[43:20] &gt;&gt; that it fit that place exactly.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. And what could they do
[43:26] to go back in them quote former churches
[43:30] that they had come out of said where
[43:33] will we go to?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; See we are fully persuaded we are
[43:37] &gt;&gt; that you have the word of life.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; See and they couldn't explain it
[43:42] &gt;&gt; but they believe it.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; See and Jesus said that
[43:48] to weed down his crowd.
[43:51] see till he could get the group together
[43:55] and out of all those people they only 11
[43:59] of them then understood actually who he
[44:04] was.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; They know that he was God and God alone.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters,
[44:15] and we can stand on that tonight.
[44:22] that we are confused
[44:25] and that's why we are concerned and that
[44:27] is why we can say it. Amen. That the
[44:30] ministry of Jesus Christ is the same
[44:34] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. The
[44:38] ministry, are you hearing me? For if
[44:40] Jesus Christ is the same, his ministry
[44:42] is the same.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And that ministry produces three kinds
[44:45] of believers. It produces the real
[44:48] believers, the unbelievers and the
[44:50] makebelievers. And the real believers
[44:52] are the 11 and the make believer that
[44:56] was Judas and the unbelievers the 70
[44:59] preachers
[45:01] &gt;&gt; and many time we are looking for the
[45:03] unbelievers on the house side not
[45:06] knowing that the unbelievers they are on
[45:07] the hill side.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; For the ministry gather all kinds.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen. We just don't. Oh
[45:16] brothers, forget about the people out
[45:19] there.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; You focus on the ministry
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and that's what the ministry has
[45:24] produced. The make believers and the
[45:27] home believers and the real believers
[45:30] are inside the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[45:34] And he was the one that ordained them
[45:37] into his ministry. My Lord, my Lord, my
[45:39] Lord, my Lord, my Lord.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; And they started to go back
[45:44] &gt;&gt; back to the God of their beginning, back
[45:47] to where they came out out of. Amen.
[45:51] Every one of them, they were going back,
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; They went back to the very very
[45:59] beginning that they came from,
[46:01] &gt;&gt; brothers.
[46:03] And the prophet of God said
[46:06] that when people move back, they turn
[46:09] their back on this glorious message in
[46:11] paragraph 185
[46:14] of three kinds of believer.
[46:17] 185
[46:18] three kinds of believers. The prophet of
[46:21] the almighty God says you are numbed
[46:25] &gt;&gt; by the power of Satan.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; You are beyond hope. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; 185. Three kinds of believers. He said,
[46:37] "Nome
[46:40] &gt;&gt; by the power
[46:43] &gt;&gt; of Satan."
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[46:48] &gt;&gt; It said you are beyond hope.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. He said this message
[46:56] of the hour that we are enjoying the
[47:00] presence of God
[47:04] in these last days.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; This message
[47:09] &gt;&gt; is the presence of God.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; He said for a man to walk out on that
[47:17] &gt;&gt; is normed
[47:19] &gt;&gt; by the power
[47:21] &gt;&gt; of Satan.
[47:23] He is beyond hope.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Let's quickly read
[47:31] that. He said and this message of the
[47:33] hour that we are now enjoying
[47:36] the presence of God the latter day the
[47:40] evening time when the light are shining
[47:44] and the things has been opened up and
[47:46] the word vindicated and proved to be the
[47:49] truth both prophesy comes to pass are
[47:52] all through scientific and everything
[47:55] &gt;&gt; proved that it is Jesus Christ
[47:59] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday
[48:02] and today and forever. And a man walk
[48:06] out on that
[48:08] is an unbeliever.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; He's beyond hopes
[48:14] &gt;&gt; is normed by the power of Satan. So
[48:18] there's no ops for him. He is beyond
[48:23] ops.
[48:28] We want to stop there, brothers,
[48:29] sisters,
[48:32] &gt;&gt; because
[48:34] we saw that these same people that
[48:37] wanted to make him king
[48:41] in John 6:15,
[48:45] they were the same people
[48:48] that turn him down
[48:51] &gt;&gt; and walk away from him.
[48:55] The same people
[48:58] that wanted him and wanted them in their
[49:01] church, wanted them, you know, to be
[49:03] with them, wanted to use his name, you
[49:06] know, to build their organization, to
[49:08] build their denominations, to build
[49:10] their ministry. The same people
[49:14] &gt;&gt; turn their back on him
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and walk away from him. the same people.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; My God.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said
[49:27] for a man to come to that condition,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; he said that man is numbed by the power
[49:34] of Satan.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Is beyond hope.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; There's no hope. Jesus.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Go back
[49:46] to John 6:66.
[49:51] John 666. Are you hearing me?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? What did it says there?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; From that time.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And from that time,
[50:00] many of his disciples
[50:03] went back and walked no more. Wait,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; wait,
[50:09] &gt;&gt; wait,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; wait. Yeah.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; John
[50:14] 6 66.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; 666.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; They took the mark of the beast.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Number by the power of Satan.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Beyond hopes
[50:37] &gt;&gt; God.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; No hope. The prophet said no hope for
[50:40] him
[50:42] &gt;&gt; because he has taken the mark of the
[50:44] beast
[50:45] &gt;&gt; and there's no redemption
[50:49] &gt;&gt; for you when you take the mark of the
[50:51] beast.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing church that this story
[50:56] that we are talking about tonight it was
[50:58] only John that recorded it in those four
[51:03] gospels.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; John talked about it.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Others they couldn't see that.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Matthew,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Mark and Luke, they cannot see it. Are
[51:18] you with me?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; But John can see it.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Because John was an eagle.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He was an eagle.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And he can look and he can see
[51:30] &gt;&gt; and John look like this. And he saw
[51:32] there taking the mark of the beast,
[51:36] departing from the faith, departing from
[51:39] the message, departing from the
[51:41] messenger. And the John saw them that
[51:44] they were taking the mark of the beast.
[51:47] Oh my God. My God.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; The same John that was the scribe of the
[51:55] book of Revelation.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; The same John that saw the lamb. Uh-huh.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Taking the book
[52:03] &gt;&gt; from the eternal one that was sitting on
[52:04] the throne
[52:06] &gt;&gt; and loose the seals and reveal it to the
[52:09] messenger of the egg. And the same John
[52:12] saw his own name. Hallelujah.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; In the book and scream and shouted. And
[52:18] at Jubilee, oh my God,
[52:21] &gt;&gt; this same John, he saw what people can
[52:24] do that will make them take the mark of
[52:27] the beast.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. Real good.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You are looking for the mark of the
[52:36] beast to be a tattoo.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a tattoo sir.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Mark of the beast is departed.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; From the word,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; sir.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Rejecting from the word,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; rejecting the message of your age.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; That's the mark of the beast.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was well perfectly located
[53:00] in the scripture.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; In John
[53:03] &gt;&gt; 66 66.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Exactly right, brother. Yes,
[53:07] sir.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; That's amazing.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[53:13] &gt;&gt; But brothers, look at you know Peter and
[53:19] the rest of them in verse 68 68

[53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; From the days of man, from the ministry
[53:44] of man unto eternity, unto the Holy
[53:48] Ghost, unto the token. Peter can say,
[53:51] answered and said, Lord, to whom shall
[53:53] we go? Thou as the word of eternal life.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; That's it, brother. Hallelujah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; 668.
[54:02] [Laughter]
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Eternal life.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody tonight.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, I can see Peter say,
[54:12] Lord, to whom shall we go?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We have entered into
[54:29] eternity.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; We cannot go back again because we
[54:35] already in eternity. And the we are in
[54:37] eternity. We don't want to go back.
[54:39] Amen. So we have stepped into eternity.
[54:42] I believe you step into eternity
[54:44] tonight. And the brothers, we cannot go
[54:48] back.
[54:50] Oh, glory. Glory to God.
[54:55] [Applause]
[54:58] &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Eternity is a circle.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. Is a circle.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; We have raised a brother.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've got my mind mirror
[55:17] &gt;&gt; and I won't turn back.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see my Jesus someday.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Go by word.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Go by mark of the beast. Go by the days
[55:28] of man. Go by
[55:31] go by.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've made up my mind
[55:36] &gt;&gt; to go God's way all the rest of my life.

[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Eternity. Yes.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; We have reached
[55:48] &gt;&gt; the point of no return.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; For it is Christ in us.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; But Abraham in Chicago, he preached a
[56:00] message that God had explained.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And after the service, Dr. Tommy Hicks
[56:07] took the pulpit and he said
[56:11] Christ,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; that's exactly
[56:13] &gt;&gt; in
[56:14] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Are you here with me?
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He said Christ
[56:19] &gt;&gt; in us
[56:20] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; He said we have reached the point of no
[56:26] return.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And brothers, that's exactly what it is.
[56:32] This message is Christ in us, the hope
[56:36] of glory. We have reached the point of
[56:40] no return. How many of you believe with
[56:42] me tonight
[56:43] &gt;&gt; that it is Christ in us, the hope of
[56:45] glory? We have reached the point of no
[56:48] return. Hallelujah, somebody.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Why, church? Because you know the
[56:54] ministry of Christ is revealing God to
[56:58] us. Are you hearing me? And that's the
[57:01] reason why the message of the hour is
[57:04] Christ. The mystery of God revealed.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? For God was in
[57:09] Christ revealing himself reconciling the
[57:14] word back to himself. God in Christ. And
[57:18] today, brother, Christ is in the church.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[57:25] the church. You and I, we are the
[57:28] mystery of Christ revealed.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, Christ in me the hope of
[57:37] glory.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; We have reached the point of no return.
[57:42] Is our life is our foundation.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Is our hope is our rock. Is everything
[57:49] is everything. We can't go back. How can
[57:52] I go back? The songwriter says to the
[57:55] word and do the things that I used to
[57:57] do. Hallelujah. Oh, how can I go back? I
[58:01] cannot go back. Amen. Amen. Do you know
[58:05] one day
[58:07] a woman as we stop here tonight, a woman
[58:13] was returning home
[58:16] from Moab.
[58:19] And this woman's name was Naomi.
[58:24] And this woman,
[58:26] the husband has died. The two sons died
[58:30] and said, "I'm going back home. Enough
[58:35] is enough. I can no longer do this
[58:38] anymore." And immediately the two
[58:41] daughters-in-law, they said, "We are
[58:43] going to go with you." Then the woman
[58:45] turned around and he told them the
[58:47] statement of fact.
[58:51] He said, "Why will you go with me? I
[58:54] have no other child that you should
[58:57] marry. And if you should wait that I
[59:02] give back today, will you be able to
[59:04] wait, you know, for him?" Because you
[59:06] are you are hold. Go back to your God.
[59:11] Go back to your people. Go back. Oh my.
[59:16] The prophet said the gospel preacher,
[59:20] he will lay it on your lap.
[59:23] He say decision time, decision making
[59:26] time. And the hopper, that sounds good.
[59:30] And the hopper kissed the mother-in-law
[59:33] goodbye
[59:35] and went back
[59:37] to the God of her beginning.
[59:41] And when she went back, her name
[59:46] was removed from the book of life.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; She was never mentioned again.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says roots
[59:57] &gt;&gt; cliff unto her.
[1:00:01] And when the mother-in-law continually
[1:00:04] persistently, you know, tell me Ruth
[1:00:08] to go back. Ruth said in chapter one, he
[1:00:14] said in verse 15, he said, "Entreat me
[1:00:17] not to leave you."
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; For
[1:00:24] where thou goest, I will go. Where thou
[1:00:29] lost, I will lodge.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Thy people shall be my people.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Thy God shall be my God.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; May God do so unto me. If nothing but
[1:00:44] death separates you and me.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, I have reached the point
[1:00:52] of no return.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not going back anymore. I'm
[1:00:57] satisfied
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; with this glorious truth. I'm satisfied
[1:01:01] with this message. I'm not going back. I
[1:01:04] have reached the point of no return. Let
[1:01:07] other people go back. Let whoever want
[1:01:10] to go back go back. But brothers, I have
[1:01:13] reached the point of no return.
[1:01:16] Hallelujah. And the brothers and sister
[1:01:19] upon the decision that Ruth made, oh
[1:01:22] hallelujah. Ruth became the mother.
[1:01:27] Oh my. Hallelujah. You love him tonight.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Ruth became the mother of Oed. And the
[1:01:34] Hob begat Jesse. And Jesse begat David.
[1:01:37] And David
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; begat Jesus. You hallelujah. Oh, what a
[1:01:43] glorious decision.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision. And the
[1:01:47] prophet of the Almighty God made such a
[1:01:49] glorious decision one day
[1:01:52] until heaven
[1:01:55] witnessed to it and said,
[1:02:01] "Because thou
[1:02:06] has walk
[1:02:08] in thy own chosen
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and it is my way.
[1:02:17] What a glorious decision that thou has
[1:02:20] made.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And this in itself is that which shall
[1:02:25] bring to pass
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; the tremendous victory
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; in the love divine.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Brothers, we are waiting for that time.
[1:02:33] And the friends, if you want to be part
[1:02:35] of that glorious time, then you got to
[1:02:38] walk in your own chosen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So many thing to distract you, so many
[1:02:42] thing to take you back. But brothers,
[1:02:45] you got to be like Elisha following
[1:02:48] Elijah. And he refused to be
[1:02:51] discouraged. He refused to be
[1:02:53] distracted. He said, "No, don't tell me
[1:02:57] to go back." Hallelujah. I will follow
[1:03:01] on. Hallelujah. And brothers, we are
[1:03:04] following on tonight. We are not going
[1:03:06] to go back. But Abraham said, you take
[1:03:09] everything. He said, but don't take this
[1:03:11] one away from us. It is our life. It is
[1:03:15] our joy. Is our sunshine. Is our breath.
[1:03:18] Hallelujah. Don't take it away. And I
[1:03:22] tell you, young brothers, young sister,
[1:03:24] father, mother, you stay, Hallelujah. on
[1:03:28] the firing line. Stay with the word of
[1:03:30] God. Stay with the truth. Stay right
[1:03:33] here. We have reached the point of no
[1:03:36] return. Don't let anything distract you.
[1:03:39] We are going home. God bless you all.
[1:03:42] Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:46] Thank you. God bless you, brother Jack.
[1:03:49] Oh, what a wonderful God. Thank you.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:00] What a wonderful
[1:04:03] sermon.
[1:04:05] And um I was just sitting here thinking
[1:04:10] um this is the last Wednesday night
[1:04:15] sermon that we'll hear in this place.
[1:04:19] And the title of the last Wednesday
[1:04:21] night sermon is that we have reached a
[1:04:24] point.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; This God is just too perfect.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's just this just just just
[1:04:41] hits right on the spot. And I mean, we
[1:04:43] we'd simply say amen to what we heard
[1:04:45] tonight because um as as brother Gideon
[1:04:49] was just tracing it through the
[1:04:50] scripture and I knew he had to come back
[1:04:53] and bring Peter in. And um uh when when
[1:04:57] they asked Peter, you know, um I'm I'm
[1:05:01] sure many of the buddies asked him,
[1:05:02] "You're going to leave too cuz we all
[1:05:04] leaving. We gone. We can't take no more
[1:05:06] of this. We don't understand what he's
[1:05:08] talking about." Right? And he said, "No,
[1:05:10] no, I don't understand it. I can't
[1:05:12] explain it. I ain't never heard these
[1:05:14] things myself, but I can't go nowhere."
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And then even Jesus himself
[1:05:21] asked, "Do you want will you also go?"
[1:05:24] Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Will you leave, too? I mean, y'all,
[1:05:26] you're free to leave because Jesus
[1:05:28] didn't try to stop nobody.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Let them all go. Just God bless you. See
[1:05:32] you. God bless you. He knew exactly what
[1:05:34] they was going to do.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And will you will you go?
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:05:39] what 668?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Only you have the words of eternal life.
[1:05:51] And that's the way I feel about this
[1:05:53] message.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Where where we going to go?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; I I've come out of Pentecost. I come out
[1:05:59] of Baptist. I've seen the way that
[1:06:02] works.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And I know what this message produces.
[1:06:05] So, it's no going back for me.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I am I'm lock, stock, and barrel.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Right. There's a song
[1:06:14] There's a song they used to sing back in
[1:06:16] the old day. I'm tied up,
[1:06:20] wrapped up, tied up,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; tangled up. When When you get When you
[1:06:25] get wrapped up, tied up, tangled up,
[1:06:27] ain't no getting out of it.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I thank God for this. I
[1:06:32] I I thank God. Thank you, brother
[1:06:34] Gideon. Thank you. Thank you for
[1:06:38] blessing our hearts. God bless you. God

[1:10:43] um
[1:10:46] that we will
[1:11:03] God bless you saints. Um I wanted to
[1:11:06] thank the Lord. Um, since moving here,
[1:11:10] we don't drive back and forth every
[1:11:12] week, uh, up and down the road. So, I
[1:11:15] don't check my vehicle like I should. I
[1:11:18] haven't been lately.
[1:11:20] And, um, Monday, I was driving back from
[1:11:22] Palm Bay and it was it was raining real
[1:11:25] bad. And, uh, as I was driving,
[1:11:29] the car began to slide from the third
[1:11:32] lane to the first lane. So, I slowed
[1:11:34] down a lot. And by the time I got to
[1:11:38] Blue Heron, the traffic had already
[1:11:40] built up. So I was getting off on Blue
[1:11:42] Heron and I was in line. All the
[1:11:44] vehicles was stopped. The car in front
[1:11:46] of me, all the traffic began to move and
[1:11:48] the car in front of me just stayed
[1:11:49] still. Then it moved about 10 ft real
[1:11:52] fast and slammed on brakes, but I was
[1:11:55] moving too and I slammed on brakes and I
[1:11:57] started sliding again.
[1:11:59] So by the time I got through that
[1:12:02] traffic, got on uh Okchobee, getting
[1:12:04] ready to turn on Sansbury and I was
[1:12:08] waiting to turn, some vehicles were
[1:12:10] coming and I tried to take off and tire
[1:12:12] started spinning.
[1:12:14] So it gained traction and then it
[1:12:17] started sliding off the road and the
[1:12:20] Lord kept me from three accidents.
[1:12:23] So Tuesday morning, I got up, I went and
[1:12:27] I looked at my tire and I was like, "Oh
[1:12:29] man, this front tire on the right, it's
[1:12:32] looking very bad. It's going ball." So
[1:12:36] my wife, she had to go ahead and drive
[1:12:38] to work and I went in um after praying
[1:12:42] and everything and I was sitting uh at
[1:12:45] my computer and then a brother text me
[1:12:48] and he said, "Uh, Brother Solomon, do
[1:12:53] you need uh help with some tires?"
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I was like I I sat there for a little
[1:13:02] while and just scratched my head. I
[1:13:03] said, "Yeah, I just went out and I was
[1:13:06] looking at my tires and yes, I do."
[1:13:11] And we kept communicating and um
[1:13:16] the brother he he bought me four new
[1:13:19] tires.
[1:13:27] Yeah,
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; the Lord he he kept me and and then he
[1:13:32] took care of me.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to thank the Lord.
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless. Um I guess two
[1:13:48] things. I want to um thank the church
[1:13:50] for uh keeping Ashley in prayer. um
[1:13:53] through her sickness. Um she's feeling
[1:13:56] better, but still not herself. Um and
[1:13:59] she's hoping to um to recover and be
[1:14:02] able to come home uh on next weekend. So
[1:14:05] continue to keep her in prayer. And also
[1:14:08] I have a um testimony. I had two sisters
[1:14:11] that were not speaking to each other and
[1:14:13] over a year they they were they fell out
[1:14:16] and they weren't speaking to each other,
[1:14:17] but they of course both were still
[1:14:19] talking to me. And um this morning they
[1:14:24] both called me and said, "Sis, we've
[1:14:26] reconciled and we've um made, you know,
[1:14:30] peace with our differences." And they
[1:14:32] were both so happy and I of course I was
[1:14:34] overjoyed because it was really
[1:14:35] bothering me and not only me, you know,
[1:14:38] other family members as well. So it was
[1:14:40] such a relief and I thank God for
[1:14:42] restoration and looking forward to more
[1:14:44] restoration in my family.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] God bless. I'm requesting prayer this
[1:14:58] weekend. I'm going to a family reunion
[1:15:01] and some of my family members to South
[1:15:04] Carolina. So, we're asking for traveling
[1:15:07] mercy for us and other family members
[1:15:10] that will be traveling as well.
[1:15:25] God bless you church. I just want to
[1:15:28] share uh two testimonies and a prayer
[1:15:30] request. Uh the first testimony is just
[1:15:34] want to thank the Lord for uh meeting a
[1:15:36] financial need that I had
[1:15:38] uh this month. uh just felt like I was
[1:15:42] uh really bombarded with a lot of uh
[1:15:45] different financial responsibilities.
[1:15:47] Uh but the Lord just uh you know showed
[1:15:50] himself strong and faithful um and and
[1:15:52] he met that need for us. Um so encourage
[1:15:55] anyone that's uh maybe feeling the same
[1:15:57] that God is faithful. Um the uh other
[1:16:01] testimony is uh just forgot to share
[1:16:04] this last last uh two Wednesdays ago. Uh
[1:16:07] but uh uh I have an older sister. We've
[1:16:10] prayed for her before. Um she's the the
[1:16:14] sister of mine that has eight boys. Um
[1:16:18] her second oldest passed away last year
[1:16:21] uh in a in a tragic car accident on his
[1:16:23] birthday. and uh his uh her older son
[1:16:27] was also in some um law situation,
[1:16:30] unlawful situation. But anyhow, the
[1:16:32] testimony is um while her second uh son
[1:16:37] passed
[1:16:38] uh we had funeral arrangements uh many
[1:16:41] things that we were doing um around that
[1:16:44] time. and she has eight boys uh for a
[1:16:49] reason and she's always uh desired to
[1:16:53] have a daughter and I guess just that
[1:16:56] wasn't the Lord's plans. Um but we uh
[1:16:59] came to find out that around the time
[1:17:02] that her second son was uh passed and we
[1:17:06] were making the arrangements for the
[1:17:08] funeral, she was actually um uh pregnant
[1:17:12] and she just gave birth to a baby girl a
[1:17:14] few weeks ago. Uh so we just thank the
[1:17:17] Lord for that.
[1:17:19] We just thought that you know
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:26] and the prayer request as unspoken uh
[1:17:29] just a need and a situation that came up
[1:17:32] and just trusting that the Lord will
[1:17:34] show uh show us favor. God bless you.
[1:17:43] I just have um I put it in a brother's
[1:17:45] chat the other day. Um, my baby brother
[1:17:48] and his wife are having their first
[1:17:50] child. Um, I think she's 37 weeks. Uh,
[1:17:53] her blood pressure is high, so they're
[1:17:54] inducing her. Um, I just I just uh pray
[1:17:58] just just ask to keep her in prayer. Um,
[1:18:01] but I know the Lord will bring her
[1:18:02] through as we we me and my wife went
[1:18:05] through the same thing. So, I know God
[1:18:06] is faithfully the same yesterday, today,
[1:18:08] and forever. Amen.
[1:18:27] All right, let's take uh this request
[1:18:29] before the Lord.
[1:18:31] Uh right. Father, we're grateful for
[1:18:35] your provision and just all that you
[1:18:38] have done to show that you're concerned
[1:18:41] about every need that we have and that
[1:18:44] you meet every need. Uh thank you for
[1:18:47] restoration in this family. We knew that
[1:18:50] this was the season for it. So to start
[1:18:53] hearing um these testimonies of
[1:18:55] restoration, God, we it certainly
[1:18:57] ignites our faith to believe for the
[1:18:59] impossible even uh during these
[1:19:01] meetings. Uh we uh thank you for
[1:19:04] touching Ashley and uh Lord allowing her
[1:19:07] to come out of the hospital and she
[1:19:09] wants to be back home next weekend. We
[1:19:11] believe Lord that you will make a way
[1:19:13] for her to be here and uh to be well uh
[1:19:16] as she comes home, God. So ask that you
[1:19:19] would move uh in her situation. Thank
[1:19:21] you for your protection for brother
[1:19:23] Solomon and just uh providing the need
[1:19:26] uh that he had uh and his family. Lord,
[1:19:29] we just appreciate all that you do. Ask
[1:19:31] prayer for sister Brown as they prepare
[1:19:33] for family union traveling mercies to
[1:19:35] her and all the other family members
[1:19:38] that will be on the road. um, Brother
[1:19:40] Jerry's sister, God, that um, she lost a
[1:19:45] child but gained one. And, um, God, we
[1:19:48] we just thank you for just giving her
[1:19:50] the desires of her heart. And, uh, we
[1:19:53] ask, God, that you just continue to
[1:19:54] strengthen uh, that family. Uh, thank
[1:19:57] you for meeting the uh, financial need
[1:19:59] that Brother Jerry had, and now there's
[1:20:01] another need that's come. Uh it's
[1:20:03] unspoken, but we we know that you know
[1:20:06] all about it and that God if you did it
[1:20:08] before, you can do it again. Brother
[1:20:10] Maris is asking prayer for his um
[1:20:13] sister-in-law
[1:20:15] um her blood pressure being high and and
[1:20:18] preparing to deliver a baby. But God,
[1:20:21] you you already prove that uh because
[1:20:24] you watched over Sister Jamaima with the
[1:20:26] same condition and uh it's a testimony
[1:20:29] that can go forth to that um uh to that
[1:20:33] relative to let them know what God can
[1:20:35] do. So Lord, I pray that as
[1:20:37] opportunities are presented that Father,
[1:20:39] they'll be taken and maybe this will be
[1:20:40] an opportunity someone can draw closer
[1:20:42] to you because they hear um that you are
[1:20:45] the same. That God that you you you move
[1:20:48] uh through prayer and um and God that
[1:20:50] you uh you answer prayer. So Lord, we
[1:20:53] just ask that you would just intervene
[1:20:54] that you just be with them being their
[1:20:56] first baby. Uh let everything go well uh
[1:21:00] uh uh for this couple. We trust, oh God,
[1:21:02] that as we prepare to leave this place
[1:21:05] that you would go with us. And we thank
[1:21:07] you for uh this wonderful send off uh
[1:21:11] the point of no return. Thank you for
[1:21:13] your servant, brother Gideon, just
[1:21:15] coming and being led of the Lord to
[1:21:17] speak, Father, uh this sermon here at
[1:21:20] this place. And again, so much is
[1:21:22] happening, Father, in our final days.
[1:21:24] Things uh that we won't forget. Uh but
[1:21:26] we just appreciate, Father, just hearing
[1:21:28] you speak to us. We're so uh convinced
[1:21:32] that Father, what this what you've sent
[1:21:34] to us through the revealed word, God is
[1:21:37] all we need to make it. So uh very
[1:21:39] grateful that you've given us eyes to
[1:21:41] see and ears to hear what the spirit is
[1:21:43] speaking in this hour. I pray your
[1:21:45] blessings upon your people as they leave
[1:21:47] this place, but not your presence. Bring
[1:21:48] us back at the appointed time on Sunday.
[1:21:52] And father, may you meet us in a very
[1:21:54] special way. It's in Jesus name we pray.
[1:21:58] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you.

[1:22:03] Have the brothers come uh to dismiss us.
[1:22:06] God bless you.
