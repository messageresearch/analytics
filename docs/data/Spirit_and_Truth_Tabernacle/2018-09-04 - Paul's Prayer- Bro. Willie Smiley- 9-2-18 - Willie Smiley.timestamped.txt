[1:01:47] just want to give thanks and praise this
[1:01:49] morning we're just trusting and
[1:01:51] dependent on you we just want to get the
[1:01:54] human part pushed to one side so that

[1:02:18] morning and not trusted in any human
[1:02:20] ability that we possess but we're just
[1:02:23] trusting in the gift of God and we
[1:02:25] understand that's the ability to get
[1:02:27] ourselves out of the way we asked that
[1:02:30] Lord God that you just used brother Jack
[1:02:33] this morning to break the bread of life
[1:02:34] in the Lima area Lord God and just give
[1:02:39] him safe passage back home we just thank
[1:02:42] you and praise you for all things this
[1:02:44] morning in Jesus name Amen amen amen
[1:02:47] maybe see we we want to use as a topic
[1:02:57] the paulus Prayer and now I've preached
[1:03:04] this at home and I've kind of did it in
[1:03:07] a couple of services but we we want to
[1:03:10] we want to maybe see how far we can go
[1:03:14] and then brother Jack I pick it up if he
[1:03:17] like to but we trust that we could say
[1:03:20] something that a bless us this morning
[1:03:24] about a grace of God now one of the
[1:03:28] things we know if you look at the
[1:03:30] beginning of the third chapter Paul was
[1:03:36] was working with the the Ephesians
[1:03:40] church and
[1:03:41] he was telling them that you know Paul
[1:03:43] was in prison that's just kind of the
[1:03:47] backdrop of what's going on here Paul
[1:03:50] was in prison and he was talking about
[1:03:51] it in the beginning of the chapter about
[1:03:53] being a a prisoner of Jesus Christ he
[1:03:56] was he wasn't he wasn't a prisoner
[1:04:00] because he was doing something that was
[1:04:04] evil he wasn't an evildoer he was in
[1:04:09] prison for the sake of the gospel right
[1:04:13] but not as evildoer
[1:04:17] and and you know Paul being the the
[1:04:21] messenger of the age and I guess you
[1:04:25] know more or less like a father figure
[1:04:28] to a lot of folk Timothy and the
[1:04:30] different ones you know his absence
[1:04:36] sometimes tribulation causes people a
[1:04:41] lot of times to get faint-hearted and
[1:04:45] Paul Paul was saying say I desire that G
[1:04:50] faint not right let's lose courage you
[1:04:56] know when people are going through
[1:05:00] something or when people see other folk
[1:05:03] going through something a lot of times
[1:05:07] we we we get discouraged especially
[1:05:13] especially around church when when we
[1:05:16] see Church and church folk going through
[1:05:18] things it tries to bring the spirit of
[1:05:22] discouragement you know the devil wants
[1:05:28] nothing more for us to be discouraged he
[1:05:31] wants nothing more for us to be down he
[1:05:35] wants nothing more for the spirit of
[1:05:37] depression and oppression
[1:05:40] and I think sometimes when when we were
[1:05:44] going through things we begin to lose
[1:05:48] sight on our very existence in why God
[1:05:52] called us said right we get caught up in
[1:05:56] what we're going through the problems
[1:05:59] that we're going through and the
[1:06:01] situations that's upon us and and we
[1:06:05] lose sight on why God called us and and
[1:06:09] one of the things I realized and
[1:06:11] studying the scripture Paul was telling
[1:06:14] the dispensation of the gospel was given
[1:06:17] to him he was given he was under mandate
[1:06:20] from God to preach to the unsearchable
[1:06:23] riches of Jesus Christ to bring the
[1:06:25] gospel to the Gentiles is that right and
[1:06:28] and one of the things imprisonment and
[1:06:32] all the things that that Paul went
[1:06:35] through it didn't change that right but
[1:06:40] present didn't change God eternal
[1:06:43] purpose right that look one thing I
[1:06:47] realize I'm a priest this morning one
[1:06:50] thing I realized no matter what we're
[1:06:53] going through and what we will go
[1:06:55] through it does not and it will not
[1:06:57] change God's eternal purpose and why God
[1:07:01] called us God called us to be the church
[1:07:05] God called us to be the bride God calls
[1:07:09] us called us to be victorious God called
[1:07:12] us to be on top is there right and one
[1:07:17] thing I realize what you are going
[1:07:19] through will not change that tribulation
[1:07:24] will not change what God has called you
[1:07:27] for prison prison did change them the
[1:07:32] right amen God called Paul to preach the
[1:07:39] gospel and because he was in prison
[1:07:42] Paul still wrote four books on the Bible
[1:07:45] in prison that prison didn't stop the
[1:07:49] panel God
[1:07:52] tribulation and what we might be going
[1:07:55] through will not stop the pipe well I'm
[1:07:58] going through and it will not stop y'all
[1:08:05] lot of pre holdin it will not stop God
[1:08:09] not at all not at all it will not stop
[1:08:12] stop the program of God see we got to
[1:08:16] understand something I wanna I want to
[1:08:20] maybe stop here for a second
[1:08:26] the prophet makes a statement hearing
[1:08:30] the message called unpardonable sin
[1:08:33] it's just now when you get unsettled
[1:08:38] foundationally right but what is what is
[1:08:48] what the quote is alluding to is the
[1:08:52] church being a settled and the church
[1:08:55] being taught properly a lot of times we
[1:08:59] think with ministry well they're upset
[1:09:02] with us well brother Jack just don't
[1:09:06] want us to do anything well brother jack
[1:09:10] jessee's know i could say it like that
[1:09:12] because i've been pastor in 20 years
[1:09:14] brother Jack don't want us to go
[1:09:16] anywhere and we and listen to the fact
[1:09:20] and we can't do anything and we can't go
[1:09:24] anywhere and we can't wear what we want
[1:09:27] to wear it's not that you gotta be
[1:09:32] fundamentally taught fundamentally sound
[1:09:36] in order to be able to fulfill the
[1:09:41] purpose of God in your life
[1:09:45] understood see we can't be Christians on
[1:09:48] our own accord with our own mind and our
[1:09:51] own thoughts you gotta come
[1:09:54] God's provided way when you become a
[1:09:56] Christian you leave your thoughts on the
[1:09:59] outs
[1:10:01] you're feeling on the outside you you
[1:10:04] come here to be taught right so that you
[1:10:07] can understand what what's what's the
[1:10:10] mind of God right
[1:10:12] what's the characteristics about what's
[1:10:14] the nature of God they're right in order
[1:10:17] to be able to fulfill an eternal purpose
[1:10:21] you have got to have understanding right
[1:10:25] a lot of folks won't religion a lot of
[1:10:28] folk like you know just going to church
[1:10:31] and have it being identified but that
[1:10:34] God don't call you for that God called
[1:10:37] you and have something for you to do in
[1:10:40] mind and then all of us to be able to do
[1:10:44] it properly we gotta be trained properly
[1:10:49] right we have got to be trained properly
[1:10:54] right from from the onset see folk love
[1:10:58] shopping we love having a good time but
[1:11:02] that's fine and I'd love to do that I
[1:11:04] like to have I love to have a good time
[1:11:07] well but but I think we're missing it is
[1:11:12] that people aren't understanding the
[1:11:15] purpose of the ministry and the why God
[1:11:20] has a ministry and what the objective of
[1:11:23] the ministry if it's if it's
[1:11:26] fundamentally sound it has the that the
[1:11:29] mind of God in you and in you you know
[1:11:32] as a church at heart right
[1:11:36] see if it's somebody that's just trying
[1:11:40] to build a kingdom and make themselves
[1:11:42] something and make a big name for
[1:11:45] themselves then they're not going to do
[1:11:47] it properly they got to purposely leave
[1:11:49] out something because that's something
[1:11:53] that they leave out is the thing that
[1:11:55] maybe else exposed them right right but
[1:11:59] but when you don't have an agenda when
[1:12:03] you realize God
[1:12:04] for purpose you approached the ministry
[1:12:08] realizing that you're going to be
[1:12:10] responsible right you want to be
[1:12:12] responsible for the souls that you see
[1:12:16] every time I get in the pulpit I don't
[1:12:19] know anybody I don't see you till we get
[1:12:21] outside I joke what you did but in here
[1:12:25] you know I don't jump I don't play right
[1:12:28] because I realized that I'm gonna be
[1:12:30] held accountable and that it's important
[1:12:34] that we be taught right in order to
[1:12:36] fulfill God's eternal plan and purpose
[1:12:39] for our lives is that right if you're
[1:12:42] coming to church for any other reason
[1:12:43] you coming for the wrong reason right
[1:12:47] well they got a great climb I just like
[1:12:51] the way you know the pastor move is he
[1:12:53] it's the wrong reason right
[1:12:57] you know the past is phony that's the
[1:13:00] wrong reason you're looking at the wrong
[1:13:02] thing see you you've got to be
[1:13:05] fundamentally talk right and see Paul
[1:13:11] was Paul was trying to make sure that
[1:13:15] the church was fundamentally tunnel my
[1:13:18] skipper here in just a minute in
[1:13:19] something else that I was preaching it
[1:13:21] at my church this week I'm gonna move
[1:13:25] back and forth because I've been kind of
[1:13:26] working with this for a couple of weeks
[1:13:32] it's something that I was trying to
[1:13:34] share with with the church there is that
[1:13:40] Paul Paul in the fourth chapter was
[1:13:43] bringing thanks right
[1:13:46] a man could see differences and I think
[1:13:51] in the things that nature has nothing to
[1:13:54] do with it right
[1:13:56] what anchors the church is its facts
[1:14:01] we've got to have the facts not feelings
[1:14:05] not emotions not well I think what your
[1:14:09] thought has nothing to do with it
[1:14:11] because it
[1:14:13] you can't think higher than go and see
[1:14:16] what we gotta keep in mind God was his
[1:14:19] own counsel that was an uncounseled God
[1:14:25] didn't give a group of men and put him
[1:14:27] together so watch out bank right he was
[1:14:33] his own counsel right he he had his own
[1:14:38] plan laid out before the foundation of
[1:14:41] the world when we will just attribute in
[1:14:44] the mind of God God had a plan I had a
[1:14:48] plan before Eve ever coming to existence
[1:14:53] being infinite knowing that they will
[1:14:56] fall knowing that it was like mistake he
[1:14:58] slay them laughs that's a fact and what
[1:15:04] we need is facts in that we got so much
[1:15:07] feelings and emotions in church you can
[1:15:10] hardly work with folk no mo
[1:15:11] if I said please both smiling y'all
[1:15:14] gonna have to blame your pastor when you
[1:15:16] get back huh but but this is what we
[1:15:20] need we need to remove our feelings that
[1:15:24] I emotions and get the facts because the
[1:15:28] facts of God don't change see people
[1:15:33] change people decide that well the folk
[1:15:37] one day we in the next day we ain't one
[1:15:43] day I'm going on the way just to see him
[1:15:45] and the next day we sippin liquor on the
[1:15:47] corner somewhere
[1:15:49] now I want to talk to me up in y'all
[1:15:52] believe it alone in a minute get over
[1:15:53] some you all right what but you we need
[1:15:59] to be fundamentally trial see because
[1:16:04] you're not going in the glory amen
[1:16:08] side of the word of God stay right seek
[1:16:12] it takes the Word of God because uh uh
[1:16:16] faith has got to have a place for your

[1:39:29] did he come back not and void is that
[1:39:33] right
[1:39:34] come on after he interpreted it the king
[1:39:37] sitting round the teens sitting around
[1:39:39] looking like well what we ought to do
[1:39:42] only Joseph had the revelation i what to
[1:39:49] do in that time he would look like uh
[1:39:53] well can't realize listen thank you
[1:39:57] nobody around here can get this job done
[1:40:01] cuz come nobody tell me what was going
[1:40:03] on and so nobody can nobody had the
[1:40:07] answers to the problems but Joseph

[1:40:18] Amen give up hope though to me you got
[1:40:22] too many opinions
[1:40:24] right amen two men see that's right you
[1:40:28] know the problem we have around church
[1:40:30] folk listen to too many folk in church
[1:40:34] instead of coming God to right away and
[1:40:37] listening to the pastor we listen to the
[1:40:40] parking lot preachers we listen to a
[1:40:42] whole lot of folk but we and then we
[1:40:46] turn death ear to the pastor why because
[1:40:51] he here Michael you know why they were
[1:40:55] mad with Michael because he never
[1:40:58] promised I'd mangoo first day was
[1:41:03] concerned Michael only prophesied it
[1:41:07] could only prophesy what God had given
[1:41:10] them the prophesied and when you don't
[1:41:12] say things that people want to hear they
[1:41:15] get upset with you huh they're good
[1:41:19] upset with you he always this no we tell
[1:41:22] my god now we took my serving God
[1:41:25] well should be God just fool us to
[1:41:28] worship God in vain right well you may
[1:41:34] attend we can worship God yes jesus said
[1:41:37] in vain do you love him teaching for
[1:41:40] doctrines the commandments of man right
[1:41:43] see then infidel he was a washable but
[1:41:50] he worship wrong
[1:41:52] see you got to find out what God is
[1:41:56] doing for the day and our two children
[1:41:57] living in it right when Jesus came on
[1:42:02] the scene and started talking to the
[1:42:05] woman at the well she was trying to talk
[1:42:07] about Abraham and in a position of in
[1:42:11] place in Jesus tones and it's coming a
[1:42:14] time and now he is that the true
[1:42:16] worshipers are worship it mean spirited
[1:42:19] until we faint worshiping upon their
[1:42:21] mountain right they think worship
[1:42:25] bringing it back down to the Word of God
[1:42:28] right bring you back to Joseph Joseph
[1:42:32] had
[1:42:33] the answers to stow up right to store in
[1:42:39] the years of plenty right so in the
[1:42:43] years of famine a man will be stored up
[1:42:48] right and see they start up right they
[1:42:55] start up but then who else around had
[1:42:59] that revelation brief with me now who
[1:43:03] else
[1:43:03] what what other churches had that
[1:43:06] revelation to spoil in the land of
[1:43:09] plenty huh what are the communities what
[1:43:14] are the people around them Joseph's
[1:43:17] family didn't have a revelation right
[1:43:22] they weren't identified with Joseph they
[1:43:26] didn't had a revelation so the land of
[1:43:29] plenty they did like everybody else
[1:43:32] around them right didn't the famine came
[1:43:36] see but Joseph's and the people around
[1:43:39] Joseph a man in the land of plenty had
[1:43:43] than right see did outside had to come
[1:43:52] to Joseph right because chosen now was
[1:43:57] seated in a position of power and
[1:44:00] authority see Joseph throughout all the
[1:44:06] tribulation that Joseph went through it
[1:44:08] was only moving them into an eternal
[1:44:10] purpose and God right Joseph I would
[1:44:17] jump to this right quick before I get to
[1:44:18] it this is why when the brother came and
[1:44:21] they thought Joseph was going to kill
[1:44:23] him Joseph said no I couldn't do it I
[1:44:25] can't do it right God was in control
[1:44:30] man widening control gods were see you
[1:44:35] saying what I was one
[1:44:39] but see one guy performing his work
[1:44:42] you can't tell god what to do well I
[1:44:47] want my children to come in but then we
[1:44:51] get in the way with God stop snapping
[1:44:55] them all up making their life manual
[1:44:57] don't do that why not
[1:45:02] god knows what we've been praying about
[1:45:05] all kind of stuff helpers and wives and
[1:45:08] all that but then we all like how God
[1:45:10] does things see Joseph said he did like
[1:45:18] he said he did it for me he to jail the
[1:45:27] things he went through in part of the
[1:45:28] house and all of that was only to get
[1:45:32] him to the position in the police that
[1:45:34] he was in see in the season questions in
[1:45:40] the season of famine if he hadn't have
[1:45:43] been in that place they all would have
[1:45:45] perished huh they already perished right
[1:45:50] they all want to perish everything would
[1:45:53] have perished around Joseph in the
[1:45:55] season of famine and she witnessed oh
[1:45:58] y'all are people see we the seasonal
[1:46:01] back but Joseph got the goods see tells
[1:46:08] me see they brought in money and job to
[1:46:10] say lo here in seed for you
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:16] right in a time of famine the scripture
[1:46:20] says this is a time of famine not for me
[1:46:25] but to see Joseph has seen in the season
[1:46:31] of famine right - so for ration for body
[1:46:38] change
[1:46:38] Joseph have see low is seen were you go
[1:46:42] back to the Bible
[1:46:43] right amen
[1:46:54] you know that you know this is you know
[1:47:52] [Applause]
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:58] right yeah praise the Lord for the
[1:48:02] regulation that he'd given me right this
[1:48:07] is this is the hardest time a man went
[1:48:12] went when there's a famine there there
[1:48:14] see right there see we can eat come on
[1:48:19] preach y'all get my pot on me huh in a
[1:48:24] famine we can eat just about how many
[1:48:27] many Bible in the time of famine we can
[1:48:32] see when when it's just a bunch of
[1:48:35] cliches and all that kind of stuff
[1:48:37] we could see some an uncle
[1:48:40] a full seven-course meal amen we tweekin
[1:48:47] we can go to the book of Revelation and
[1:48:50] realize this is the children's playing
[1:48:53] when it's our preachers fear roaches
[1:48:58] wondering we know what the White Horse
[1:49:01] rather you we know what the black horse
[1:49:03] the Red Horse the pale horse
[1:49:05] right we understand a man what's going
[1:49:09] on man we can see that at the Medical
[1:49:12] Council because without without
[1:49:17] knowledge everything is going worship
[1:49:20] the Beast whose name is not written in
[1:49:22] the lab book of life before the
[1:49:23] foundation in the world and the only
[1:49:25] reason we don't because we understand
[1:49:27] what the Beast eels right
[1:49:32] so you can see all what I'm gonna sound
[1:49:36] like I huh
[1:49:38] you can understand how with Revelation
[1:49:42] in truth with facts to tell them blue
[1:49:45] don't faint

[2:20:26] right amen
[2:20:28] God came down in love he saw the real
[2:20:33] love right
[2:20:35] the real love of a family was displayed
[2:20:37] in Genesis in in the list of a fault and
[2:20:42] failure there was you saw Jin because
[2:20:45] it's easy that's the easiest thing to do
[2:20:49] is walk out but a lot of time we walk
[2:20:52] out and don't know the detriment of what
[2:20:54] we're doing right see hey man you know
[2:21:01] what I'm determined man I've taken a
[2:21:03] stand for this word for 30 years right

[2:21:30] those things like that right frustrated
[2:21:32] a little bit yeah right but I know God
[2:21:37] knows the plans he has for me huh
[2:21:42] godliness before I knew it
[2:21:45] you God knew it before it happened but
[2:21:50] that ain't the end of the story huh tell
[2:21:54] you labor ain't the end of the story
[2:21:57] no matter what you go through it's not

[2:22:07] you know you know we used to say it over
[2:22:11] Turner I did a fat lady say when it
[2:22:18] ain't over cuz she ain't saying she
[2:22:21] won't be singing as far as I'm concerned
[2:22:24] I hope you want to do the same I don't
[2:22:29] think the one doing the praising when it
[2:22:31] all come for supper the Critias miles be
[2:22:34] no I'm very smiley a smile I'm
[2:22:39] saying I'm the same angle change hey

[2:22:50] brought you to it he'll bring it through
[2:22:52] it huh God is bringing me through it
[2:22:58] from day one
[2:23:00] right it's a process overcoming you know
[2:23:05] our biggest problem is us I realized
[2:23:10] that church I big astrak-- we don't
[2:23:14] realize as Christians how much of us got
[2:23:18] to die huh how much of how much we rely
[2:23:25] on us and our abilities and our
[2:23:29] safeguards and all of this this got to
[2:23:32] die you there yet brush my nope not yet
[2:23:35] be real with hey but I'm trying to get
[2:23:39] there because because God presents
[2:23:42] things and show you thing and all you
[2:23:44] could say is Lord
[2:23:45] like Paul strengthen me give me
[2:23:50] strengthen inside to overcome the
[2:23:54] outside
[2:23:55] see I'm glad I said inside work right
[2:23:59] God has to deal with deal with us you
[2:24:02] think with Joe God knew what was really
[2:24:05] in joke he say he was perfect enough
[2:24:07] right right a minute
[2:24:09] but God looted there was something in
[2:24:11] joke he still needed to deal with right
[2:24:14] God knows God places us in situation
[2:24:17] with music uh-uh-uh-uh
[2:24:22] God knows there's something in us that
[2:24:24] he has to deal with right god no I know
[2:24:28] we put a good Christian wait for the
[2:24:32] good people we present know how to do it
[2:24:34] glory to God
[2:24:36] we got it all down pat we got to learn
[2:24:38] heard sisters and we got the look you
[2:24:41] know that in our behavior that's nice
[2:24:52] but real Christianity is where you can
[2:24:55] overcome yourself which self say go
[2:25:01] right you go left
[2:25:03] yeah cuz the words say go left
[2:25:06] flesh said don't you go that way the
[2:25:09] words say for me to go this way
[2:25:14] born-again really been a change in me
[2:25:21] born-again just like Jesus see I've got
[2:25:26] a saying cause later positions come
[2:25:28] born-again is all because of Calvary so
[2:25:35] glad so glad I've been born again
