[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] Lord once
[0:10] again amen uh tonight uh we will uh be
[0:15] having brother Quenton speaking for us
[0:19] and uh so we'll just do things a little
[0:21] different I want to read a scripture uh
[0:23] just to open the Service uh from uh
[0:27] Romans chapter 8 amen Romans chapter
[0:32] 8 praise the
[0:35] Lord Romans
[0:37] 8 and I want to start at Verse 18 amen
[0:42] of Romans
[0:43] 8 uh it just says for I reckon that the
[0:47] sufferings of this present time are not
[0:50] worthy to be compared with the glory
[0:52] which shall be revealed in us for the
[0:55] earnest expectation of the creature
[0:58] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:00] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:03] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:06] reason of him who have subjected the
[1:09] same in Hope because the creature itself
[1:12] also shall be delivered from uh the
[1:16] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[1:18] Liberty of the children of God for we
[1:21] know that uh the whole creation grown up
[1:24] and and travaileth in pain together
[1:26] until now and not only they but uh
[1:29] ourselves also which have the first
[1:31] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:33] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:35] adoption to Wi the Redemption of our
[1:38] body for we are saved by hope but hope
[1:41] that is seen is not hope for what a man
[1:43] seeth what doth he yet hope for but if
[1:47] we hope for that we see not then do we
[1:51] with patience wait for it uh likewise
[1:55] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[1:56] for we know not what we should pray for
[2:00] as we ought but the spirit maketh
[2:02] intercession uh for us with groanings
[2:04] which cannot be uttered and he that
[2:07] searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
[2:09] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[2:12] intercession for the Saints according to
[2:14] the will of God and uh this last verse
[2:17] and we know that all things uh work
[2:19] together for good to them that love God
[2:22] to them who are the called according to
[2:25] his purpose amen thank the Lord for his
[2:29] word let's just have a brief word of
[2:30] prayer father we thank you for being

[9:26] high mountain apart and was transfigured
[9:28] before them and his face did shine as
[9:30] the sun and his reignment was as white
[9:32] as the light and behold there appeared
[9:34] unto them Moses and Elias talking with
[9:37] him and then Peter said unto Jesus Lord
[9:40] it is good for us to be here if thou
[9:43] Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles
[9:46] one for thee and one for Moses and one
[9:48] for Elias while he yet spake Behold a
[9:51] bright Cloud overshadowed them and

[9:54] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[9:58] well pleased hear ye him amen you may be
[10:01] uh take your seats now as we uh say a
[10:04] quick
[10:05] prayer oh Lord Jesus we come before your
[10:08] Tabernacle oh Lord God knowing oh Lord
[10:12] God that it's from here oh Lord Jesus
[10:14] Christ that we receive uh word from you
[10:17] oh Lord God we receive instruction oh
[10:19] Lord God we receive correction oh Lord
[10:21] God we receive blessings oh Lord God we
[10:24] receive healing from you oh Lord God oh
[10:27] Lord you created man oh Lord in your
[10:29] image oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord to
[10:32] worship with you oh Lord Jesus Christ to
[10:34] look to you oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[10:36] God to look like you to dress like you
[10:38] to talk like you oh Lord God to live
[10:41] like you oh Lord God to work like you
[10:43] did oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you
[10:45] brought us to this building on a
[10:47] Wednesday night where other people in
[10:49] the world oh Lord are doing different
[10:51] things with the carnal mind oh Lord God
[10:53] but Lord you prepared us oh Lord God
[10:55] before the foundation of the world to be
[10:57] in this setting oh Lord for us to give
[10:59] our time to you oh Lord Jesus Christ oh
[11:02] Lord you want to restore us back oh Lord
[11:05] Jesus Christ Lord you don't just want to
[11:07] heal us oh Lord God and so that we could
[11:10] be healthy and just keep living life on
[11:12] oh Lord God or just have good finances
[11:14] oh Lord God but Lord you're trying to
[11:16] restore back that relationship that we
[11:19] had with you oh Lord before the
[11:21] foundation of the world oh Lord God Lord
[11:24] help us oh Lord God to awaken our
[11:27] spiritual eyes and ears Lord to
[11:30] understand Lord Jesus Christ that your
[11:32] love oh Lord is greater than finances
[11:34] it's greater than health oh Lord God
[11:36] it's greater than blessings oh Lord God
[11:39] to be able to say I'm a Child of God I'm
[11:41] a I'm a Son of God and walk right up to
[11:44] the presence of God knowing full well
[11:46] Lord Jesus Christ that love engulfs us
[11:49] oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord you built a
[11:51] tabernacle once oh Lord and and certain
[11:53] people couldn't come to it oh Lord Jesus
[11:55] Christ but that wasn't the end goal for
[11:58] you oh Lord God Lord you wanted all of
[12:00] us to have access to you oh Lord God
[12:02] Lord God there's a lot of needs here
[12:05] tonight that on people's hearts oh Lord
[12:07] God Lord I'm just a man I'm just a
[12:09] vessel Lord God I feel as least oh Lord
[12:12] God amongst any I don't have a gift of
[12:14] dis serment or anything like that Lord
[12:16] Jesus but you're still the great Jehovah
[12:18] oh Lord God lord there are a lot of here
[12:21] that have been hanging on on to to a
[12:23] word you gave them for years for months
[12:25] for weeks oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[12:28] they're here oh Lord God just to show
[12:30] lord they're faithful to you and that
[12:32] they still believe you oh Lord Jesus
[12:34] Christ Lord answer our prayers oh Lord
[12:36] God according to your riches and to your
[12:38] will oh Lord in the Blessed name of
[12:40] Jesus Christ
[12:43] amen amen so the title of the message
[12:46] that um the lord gave me tonight was
[12:49] hear ye him uh and this is actually a
[12:52] message that the prophet had preached
[12:54] before um and
[12:57] so restoration is the focal point of the
[13:00] Bible and that's something that you have
[13:02] to realize as a Believer is that
[13:05] whatever you get from God was already
[13:07] given to you right you're not trying to
[13:10] come and receive something that is uh
[13:12] outside of that like so if you've if
[13:14] you've lost the leg God's not going to
[13:16] give you uh three arms right and know
[13:20] and I've seen videos of of people that
[13:22] have lost their eyesight and science
[13:25] have scientists have said that you know
[13:27] another sense would en so that they
[13:29] would have enhanced uh hearing but
[13:32] that's not what we're looking for we
[13:34] want our sight back all right all right
[13:37] we want our blessings back we want our
[13:39] love back we want our peace back we want
[13:42] our our our longsuffering back we want
[13:44] our finances back everything that God
[13:47] gave to us we want it back right and the
[13:50] Beautiful Thing of having something that
[13:52] God gave to you you know that there's no
[13:55] ill will in it and then it comes with
[13:57] peace it comes with love so we're
[13:58] looking for God to restor us back these
[14:00] things right so the Bible um the prophet
[14:04] said uh the word here actually doesn't
[14:07] mean just to listen right here means to
[14:09] receive something right so receiving is
[14:12] an important point along the path of
[14:14] restoration when you want to get
[14:15] something back right amen right the
[14:17] prophet uh uh told us that right in
[14:19] order to receive something we first must
[14:22] know what are we receiving and from whom
[14:25] are we receiving you have to ask these
[14:27] questions because
[14:29] uh um you have to understand what what
[14:32] God has allotted to you right and then
[14:35] the voice that comes behind it because a
[14:36] lot of people a lot of times people
[14:38] receive things right that aren't theirs
[14:41] now it's not that it's uh the thing is a
[14:44] wrong thing because a lot of times a
[14:46] perfect example would be king Ahab he
[14:48] went in a Vineyard and there's nothing
[14:50] wrong with the vineyard that Vineyard
[14:52] just didn't belong to him right that
[14:55] Vineyard didn't belong to him so God
[14:57] couldn't be behind some something like
[14:59] that right so the voice that was telling
[15:01] him to get that Vineyard did not come
[15:03] from God so we always got to be careful
[15:06] about what we're asking to be received
[15:08] and uh recognizing the voice behind it
[15:11] and you'll see that's a focal point in
[15:13] the Bible right because it's the voice
[15:16] that gives us the confidence in order to
[15:18] go and get it amen amen so we're going
[15:20] to uh start our journey in first Samuel
[15:23] 17 we're probably going to be doing a
[15:25] lot of scripture reading today but you
[15:27] know there there's nothing wrong with
[15:28] reading about
[15:29] amen all right so we're going to start
[15:31] from 1st Samuel
[15:33] 17:
[15:36] 1-3 and I can start reading
[15:39] it it says now the Philistines gathered
[15:42] together their armies to battle and were
[15:46] gathered together at shoka which
[15:48] belongeth to Judah and pitched between
[15:50] shoka and Aika and esid Damon and Saul
[15:54] and the men of Israel were gathered
[15:56] together and pitched by the valley of
[15:57] ela and set the battle in Array against
[16:00] the Philistines and the Philistines
[16:02] stood on a mountain on one side and
[16:03] Israel stood on the mountain on the
[16:05] other side and there was a valley in
[16:07] between them right so I I like this cuz
[16:11] we cuz this year our theme is
[16:13] restoration and this is a beautiful
[16:15] example of the children of Israel having
[16:18] lost uh uh this land that God had given
[16:21] them you could say that the Philistines
[16:23] were squatting on their land and uh now
[16:27] uh Israel has pitched up T
[16:29] because now they want to go and get it
[16:30] back as brother Jack cat said when you
[16:33] want to get your restoration you have to
[16:35] go on the offense you can't go on the
[16:38] defense you can't stand around and sit
[16:40] around and expect the uh the blessing to
[16:42] come back to you you have to come up
[16:44] with a battle strategy to say all right
[16:46] we're going over to take what is ours
[16:49] amen and I love how the scriptures um
[16:53] this land that was taken from them I
[16:55] love how the scripture says that it
[16:57] belonged to Judah right because Judah is
[16:59] an important tribe to know the Bible and
[17:02] as as I've been going and reading
[17:03] through my uh um I I do a Bible study
[17:06] every single morning and I was going
[17:08] through and I was reading about Judah
[17:09] and uh his name and with this tribe and
[17:12] the the importance of it right because
[17:14] out of Judah comes a great restoration
[17:17] right brother amen out of Judah comes a
[17:19] great restoration and so they had lost
[17:22] this land that had very important
[17:24] significance to the Christian race as a
[17:27] whole right right so there's this
[17:29] website that I um that I found online
[17:32] that uh gave some facts about Judah that
[17:34] I want to kind of go through just to
[17:36] show the importance of of of this tribe
[17:39] yes sir so one of the facts facts says
[17:41] it was prophesied the Messiah would come
[17:44] from the tribe of Judah right right the
[17:46] Messiah which we know is Christ the
[17:48] promise right and also says when Israel
[17:51] entered the promised land Judah receive
[17:53] extensive lands as recorded in the Book
[17:55] of Joshua so God loved this particular
[17:58] particular tribe and had to give him
[18:00] some blessings right and it also says
[18:03] here that um David was from the tribe of
[18:07] Judah right David has important meaning
[18:09] as we're going and reading this uh uh
[18:11] Bible verse with David in it and it says
[18:13] after David and Solomon's death Judah
[18:15] was the only tribe that remained loyal
[18:17] to the memory and the ways of David now
[18:19] both of the kingdoms they're talking
[18:21] about which was Israel and Judah they
[18:23] both had issues but Judah tend to stay
[18:26] with the word all right Judah tend to
[18:28] stay with the word right and that's very
[18:31] very important there was actually a time
[18:32] when the prophet had came down and had
[18:35] told the king of Israel he said I
[18:36] wouldn't even be sitting here if Judah
[18:39] wasn't here because Judah was faithful
[18:41] to the word right and when you're
[18:43] faithful to the word God has to keep his
[18:46] eyes on you and we'll see that see that
[18:49] being typed as we keep going keep going
[18:51] through right so another fact says just
[18:54] as the line of Judah was continued
[18:55] through children Judah had uh also
[18:58] children he it says here that he would U
[19:00] marry someone outside their culture that
[19:02] also included uh Boaz who married rof
[19:04] and that's important because uh uh the
[19:07] Christ of this day also has a gentile
[19:09] bride right right so we have so it's
[19:12] important that we uh uh find ourselves
[19:14] uh uh in this because we are also a part
[19:16] of the tribe the tribe of Judah through
[19:18] marriage of Christ amen right says the
[19:20] tribe of Judah over time came to be
[19:22] represented through a lion um and a
[19:25] beautiful beautiful fact here which was
[19:27] the last one say say Jesus fulfills the
[19:30] prophecy and blessings given to Judah at
[19:33] its Inception even in Revelation Jesus
[19:35] is referred to as the one who fulfilled
[19:37] those prophecies Prophet promises and it
[19:40] says here we know Revelation 55 and one
[19:42] of the elders said to me weep no more
[19:44] behold the line of the troo of Judah the
[19:48] root of David has conquered so that he
[19:51] can open the scroll and its Seven Seals
[19:54] and I want I want you I want you to know
[19:56] right now those Seven Seals in the
[19:58] opening of the book is important to
[20:00] Restoration praise
[20:02] God the opening of the seals and the and
[20:05] the opening of the book is very very
[20:08] very important if you're wanting a
[20:09] restoration right right and and there
[20:12] was only one person that could do it now
[20:16] John was the one that had the vision and
[20:19] even though John was God's agent of love
[20:23] he still wasn't worthy enough to open
[20:25] the book that's right we love God but
[20:28] it's going to take more than that in
[20:31] order for us to get our Restorations
[20:33] back it's going to take more than our
[20:35] love for God it's going to take him to
[20:37] do it himself because he is the one who
[20:39] is worthy amen amen we couldn't redeem
[20:42] oursel Adam couldn't redeem himself we
[20:45] needed someone to come and restore us
[20:47] back Glory all right so we're going to
[20:49] we're going to keep uh uh continuing on
[20:51] with this thought of uh the children of
[20:53] Israel right now that we kind of
[20:55] explained and show the significance of
[20:57] Judah being a uh being a representation
[21:00] of Christ right so they had lost this
[21:03] land this important land that had an
[21:05] important uh uh place in the Bible right
[21:08] and uh and and and we're trying this the
[21:11] ultimate goal that we're trying to get
[21:13] back to because when you want to have
[21:15] blessings when you want to have your
[21:16] finances increased when you want to have
[21:18] healing in your body when you want to
[21:20] have God turn around your situation it's
[21:22] important to first have your s restored
[21:26] right and you get that by restoring your
[21:29] communion with the tree of life or Jesus
[21:32] Christ or what we know as the baptism of
[21:34] the holy spirit so before you pray for
[21:37] your blessings before you pray for your
[21:39] healing say Lord Give Me Back My Joy
[21:41] Glory give me back my love give me back
[21:44] my peace because if you were to go
[21:47] through a trial where you were sick and
[21:49] you're asking God to heal you and you
[21:51] don't have joy you won't make it through
[21:53] you won't trust in God until the end of
[21:56] the process no you need that joy in
[21:59] order for the the finances to come for a
[22:01] church building to come you need the
[22:03] longsuffering right you can't or or else
[22:06] you'd crack you'd give up on God so you
[22:09] need to have these things restored to
[22:11] you first right so we're looking to get
[22:14] back our our restoration to this tree of
[22:17] life that we lost to in the beginning
[22:18] right so and that's why we have a
[22:21] problem with this scene where we have
[22:23] Israel has pitched up their tents and
[22:25] now they're looking to go to battle
[22:27] towards uh the Philistines we have a
[22:30] problem because their attitude towards
[22:32] it now shows uh uh something that's a
[22:35] little bit off right so in 1st Samuel 17
[22:39] uh uh chapter 17: 10- 11 I'll go through
[22:42] and read that 10 through 11 it says and
[22:46] the Philistines said I defy the armies
[22:49] of Israel this day while he's on their
[22:52] land he says give me a man that we may
[22:54] fight together the Bible said when Saul
[22:57] and all is Israel heard those words of
[22:59] the Philistine they were dismayed and
[23:01] greatly
[23:03] afraid dismayed and greatly afraid
[23:06] someone standing on something that was
[23:08] theirs and boasting and they're fearing
[23:11] they didn't give the land to themselves
[23:14] God gave it to them but yet they're
[23:16] still afraid to go and get
[23:19] it something doesn't line up here right
[23:22] so not only did they need a restoration
[23:24] to this land they needed a restoration
[23:27] to their own selves to remember who they
[23:31] were right but we thank God right
[23:34] because he always sends a message before
[23:37] a restoration right and that's the title
[23:40] of the message hear ye him you got to
[23:42] receive something first before you get
[23:45] the strength to go and fight right so so
[23:48] it and it's not God doesn't just send a
[23:50] message or words like a lot of
[23:52] theologians they'll give smart words and
[23:54] talks and uh uh beautiful speeches and
[23:57] stuff but we need a manifestation behind
[24:00] that word in order to revive the fire in
[24:03] our hearts for us to go and get back our
[24:06] restoration or else you'd be afraid to
[24:08] do it right so now before we get to the
[24:12] um the next Bible verses uh and we
[24:16] continue on with that message of where
[24:17] the message is coming through like I
[24:19] said before it's important to realize
[24:22] the source of where the message comes
[24:24] and how it's selected it's very very
[24:27] important to remember that because
[24:29] there's a lot of messages out there
[24:31] there's a lot of words out there there's
[24:32] a lot of people out there there's a lot
[24:34] of great men out there but we want
[24:36] something that's going to give us
[24:37] confidence we want something where we
[24:39] don't have to uh uh uh be second
[24:42] guessing uh will it work will it not
[24:44] work there's a lot of treatments in the
[24:45] medical world today and and and you go
[24:48] online and it's well it might work well
[24:50] it it may work under this uh
[24:52] circumstance it may not work on this
[24:53] circumstance it worked for this person
[24:55] it didn't work for that person so it's
[24:56] just they're giving them a cure a cure
[25:00] but they're still giving them questions
[25:02] about it right and God doesn't like to
[25:04] see his children in a situation where
[25:06] they're constantly wondering question am
[25:09] I on or am I off right so this is what
[25:11] this message does it comes to settle you
[25:13] right amen now we all know that the
[25:16] messenger for that for that time and
[25:18] that situation was David right so let's
[25:22] kind of backtrack and and see how he got
[25:24] to this position and how he was selected
[25:27] in order to deliver this to to deliver
[25:29] this message
[25:30] now before David Saul was Israel's first
[25:35] king yes he was Israel's first king and
[25:38] it's important to know that he was
[25:39] chosen by the people right he was chosen
[25:42] by the people and when and you'll read
[25:45] further on when he had his talk with
[25:47] Samuel during that time uh the prophet
[25:50] Samuel told Saul God Gave You authority
[25:53] over all the tribes of Israel including
[25:56] Judah so Saul was in a position where
[25:59] God was God had some confidence in him
[26:03] even though he wasn't God's choice the
[26:06] people wanted uh Saul to be king So Saul
[26:09] so God said okay Saul's your king God
[26:11] anointed him God gave him the authority
[26:13] over the tribes but when Saul disobeyed
[26:16] the word god rejected Saul as king
[26:19] that's right God rejected Saul as king
[26:22] and it's important to remember this God
[26:25] rejected Saul as king but he didn't
[26:27] reject him as a
[26:29] son a lot of people you read the message
[26:31] and a lot of people cuz Saul tends to
[26:34] get a lot of slack when we talk about
[26:36] him and when people preach about him and
[26:38] speak about him and someone even tried
[26:40] to tell the prophet in the message they
[26:42] said that Saul was lost that's right
[26:44] Prophet said Saul was not lost what he
[26:46] said a lot of people try to say that he
[26:48] killed himself and Prophet said the
[26:50] prophet said Saul was wheat right Saul
[26:54] was wheat Saul was a real seed of God
[26:57] right so Saul didn't so Saul was not
[27:00] lost as a son God just he just lost his
[27:04] position so now when we see these
[27:06] children of Israel and they're at this
[27:09] they're at this Junction where they're
[27:10] trying to get their land back but
[27:13] they're afraid to go and take back what
[27:15] God gave them it shows you the state of
[27:18] having lost your position but not losing
[27:21] your status as a son will do to you
[27:24] because God was still with them they had
[27:26] the word they had they had God's
[27:29] promises they had uh uh they knew Moses
[27:32] was the one that took them from Egypt
[27:34] they knew Joshua was the one that gave
[27:36] them all the land they had the word
[27:38] there was still a prophet uh in the land
[27:41] during that time but they were still
[27:43] afraid to go and get this land that was
[27:45] given back to them right and I like how
[27:48] it says Saul and Israel because Saul was
[27:52] the person as a head it's important to
[27:54] know who your head
[27:56] is it's important important to know that
[27:58] who is your head saying that you can go
[28:01] forth and do things in Authority because
[28:03] if your head has been rejected by God
[28:05] and there's fear you'll follow suit
[28:08] that's why it's important as you know if
[28:10] you're a husband right uh uh it's
[28:12] important that when you say you believe
[28:15] something you really have to believe it
[28:17] because your family's going to be
[28:18] looking to you if you're not certain
[28:20] where you stand I guarantee your
[28:22] family's not going to be certain either
[28:24] because they're looking to you as the
[28:26] head they're looking to you to take some
[28:28] kind of action and they'll follow suit
[28:30] that's why Christ when he says follow me
[28:33] he's not saying it because he wants to
[28:34] bully you or he wants to show you who's
[28:36] in charge he says no I know exactly what
[28:40] uh uh you need in this journey follow me
[28:43] you'll have confidence amen you'll have
[28:46] confidence with that because you'll know
[28:47] your position right so um they had the
[28:52] word but they just needed the word to be
[28:55] quickened right they needed the word
[28:57] word to be Quicken meaning they needed a
[28:59] word from an appointed individual at an
[29:02] appointed time it's very important to
[29:04] understand that a message for your time
[29:07] and your day is of the utmost important
[29:10] you can't depend upon what someone what
[29:13] something uh what something was done in
[29:15] the past and you can't re and you you
[29:18] can put your faith in what's going to be
[29:19] done in the future but you need
[29:21] something for your day and your specific
[29:23] time so it makes the word real to you so
[29:26] that's why when people can't believe
[29:28] that God sent a messenger in our day uh
[29:32] uh to restore us back to God how can you
[29:35] believe in a restoration in your current
[29:37] situation if you can't even believe that
[29:40] God works in specific times all righten
[29:44] right so as you're going through a
[29:45] situation and you're needing to hold on
[29:47] God for some healing or something like
[29:49] that God's going to send you a word or a
[29:52] message for that specific time for you
[29:54] to receive in order for you to get your
[29:55] deliverance and if you can't believe
[29:57] believe that God can send a messenger
[29:59] for a specific time on Earth how can you
[30:03] get restored back right right how can
[30:05] you get restored back that's why
[30:07] believing all of these things is a
[30:09] purpose behind it right it's a purpose
[30:12] uh behind it because God has a plan and
[30:14] a way of doing things and he can't
[30:15] change that right so we're going to
[30:19] rewind back uh um and I know I talk I
[30:22] tend to talk a lot about the garden uh
[30:25] um but I the the Prophet said that the
[30:28] enemy there's two things enemy hates he
[30:30] hates Genesis and he hates Revelation so
[30:33] I'm going to keep talking about it if he
[30:35] hates it amen amen right so let's rewind
[30:38] back to the time in the garden where uh
[30:41] we have Adam which was God's uh
[30:44] manifested word spoken son the first one
[30:47] on the face of the Earth and in that
[30:49] position he had full authority over
[30:51] everything like we like I I had preached
[30:53] before there was a serpent in the garden
[30:55] Adam had full control over over all of
[30:57] that right now when the fall came Adam
[31:01] willingly disobeyed the word of God yes
[31:04] and then he tried to uh fix things up
[31:07] himself uh as he tried to put a covering
[31:09] on for as a as a man-made religion and
[31:11] when God came looking for Adam and asked
[31:13] what happened Adam passed the blame off
[31:15] to the woman that's right right and so
[31:18] when Saul when God told Saul to go down
[31:21] and take over this Kingdom and he said
[31:23] utterly destroy
[31:25] everything Saul did disobeyed God
[31:28] willingly disobeyed God came back with
[31:30] the stuff and the prophet Samuel heard
[31:32] about these things and it was Samuel
[31:36] looking for Saul now and when he asked
[31:38] Saul hey what happened here you know I
[31:42] hear the bleeding I hear the bleeding of
[31:44] the ghost what was going what was going
[31:45] on here Saul said well the
[31:50] people the people yes brother the people
[31:53] right yes so he's he he's putting on
[31:56] this same garment that Adam wore wow not
[32:00] knowing god had rejected it wow God had
[32:04] rejected it right so so now God's got to
[32:09] do what God's got to do he's got to step
[32:12] in remember Adam was given a choice Saul
[32:15] was given a choice but they but uh but
[32:19] their their choice and their solution
[32:20] ended ended up having them to lose their
[32:23] position right so when Adam made a
[32:26] choice and Saul made a choice and it
[32:27] both failed God said now I need to make
[32:30] a choice and God will allow you to go
[32:33] through life with your choices and your
[32:35] choices until you fail right and then
[32:37] say all right can I have a say so now
[32:40] can I make a choice can I send someone
[32:44] right God allows that to happen in order
[32:46] to show his glory So Adam lost the
[32:48] inheritance which was the right to the
[32:50] Tree of Life God said you can eat of all
[32:52] the trees uh uh and uh the Tree of Life
[32:54] which was Jesus Christ they he had lost
[32:57] that access to the tree of life and
[32:59] Israel had now now we're seeing Israel
[33:01] lose this little land that belonged to
[33:04] Judah which also represented Christ so
[33:08] when God had to restore things back the
[33:11] way he uh uh restore things back he does
[33:13] it how he does it uh uh how he always
[33:16] does it and that's he sends a message
[33:19] all right he sends a message right a
[33:22] message to be received by the people
[33:25] amen right and so that's why people get
[33:27] things twisted up when they talk about
[33:29] the message like oh yeah I'm a part of
[33:31] the message I'm a part of the message
[33:32] the message is not a denomination amen
[33:35] the message is not an idea the message
[33:38] is you right the message is you right
[33:42] right because you'll notice that when
[33:45] God when God elected you and showed you
[33:47] this message and showed you the light of
[33:49] it it wasn't just to show you who you
[33:52] were but now you have the ability to
[33:54] affect somebody else God can send you on
[33:57] the scene to help somebody else God can
[33:59] send you to pray to somebody else and
[34:01] that's why brother Jack uh uh uh brother
[34:03] Jack you know he'll say you know if
[34:05] there's someone out there that's sick oh
[34:06] well let me go call the pastor you don't
[34:08] need to call the pastor you have enough
[34:11] power with inside of you not only that
[34:13] you have the confidence of God to say
[34:16] the right word in order for you to bring
[34:19] a change in the situation right the the
[34:22] one time the prophet was looking to pray
[34:23] for a b uh pray for a baby and he was
[34:25] like you know I'm just I'm just what
[34:27] God's going to do I want to see what
[34:28] God's going to do and the voice came
[34:29] back and said I want to see what you're
[34:31] going to do right he had the confidence
[34:34] of God inside of him to speak the word
[34:37] and it would happen right amen so that's
[34:41] why we're not we're not following uh uh
[34:43] we're not following a denomination and I
[34:45] can say as my own testimony I remember
[34:47] one time I had caught covid and um it
[34:50] was Wednesday and I couldn't make it to
[34:51] church because I was just feeling so
[34:53] sick and I remember I was watching the
[34:55] stream and I had told my my dad I told
[34:58] my dad yeah I'm feeling sick you know
[34:59] and so I'm I'm watching we're going
[35:01] through churches at the end of church
[35:03] you know I'm hoping like hey is is
[35:04] anyone going to talk about me and uh
[35:06] pray for me and you know and say
[35:08] something to me and no one said nothing
[35:10] and I was like oh
[35:12] man ain't no one think about
[35:15] me and then some Sundays passed and a
[35:18] brother from Sarasota came down and he
[35:21] made a statement and he said he said he
[35:23] said something along the lines he was
[35:24] like you that has Co saying no one pray
[35:27] for me pray for yourself and it let me
[35:31] know and it was a rebuke to me and it
[35:34] let me know that I'm not here to follow
[35:37] we're not here to follow a church all
[35:39] right the word is in us and God is
[35:42] looking for us to have the confidence to
[35:45] speak it and that's not just for me it's
[35:48] for anybody that has received Christ you
[35:52] have the word you have the confidence I
[35:54] I I don't think we I don't think we
[35:55] stress that enough we have the
[35:57] confidence of God that before something
[36:00] happens he doesn't have to come and okay
[36:02] well let's sit down and talk about how I
[36:03] want this thing to go no do you realize
[36:06] in the Bible that Adam when he spoke
[36:08] mountains and moved rivers and moved
[36:10] flowers and stuff like that there was no
[36:12] meeting with God to do that God trusted
[36:15] Adam to make the right choice and that's
[36:18] what God is trying to restore us back to
[36:22] so he doesn't want us looking looking at
[36:24] a church and the church is good right he
[36:27] doesn't want us looking at some
[36:28] individual individuals are good but God
[36:30] wants to get his his spirit inside of us
[36:33] to give us confidence to believe his
[36:36] word so that we can speak a word in any
[36:39] situation because you won't always be a
[36:41] church right right great people won't
[36:44] always be there there were there there
[36:46] there was times uh the prophet couldn't
[36:48] always be there I I would read stories
[36:50] about the prophet how he would be in the
[36:52] prayer line and how after the prayer
[36:54] line would be finished he would be so
[36:55] tired he'd be cuz he'd be moving between
[36:57] Realms he gets so tired that he had to
[36:59] go and sleep but that doesn't mean God's
[37:01] still
[37:02] sleeping and so you have to catch the
[37:05] Revelation that it's not a man it's the
[37:07] spirit of God trying to get inside you
[37:10] so that you can speak the word in your
[37:11] situation and God can show up on the
[37:14] scene amen right so we're not a
[37:17] denomination so David was the message
[37:19] for his day right and the reason why I
[37:23] can say he was the message the prophet
[37:25] said that David T
[37:27] Christ and Christ was the message for
[37:29] his day in this situation so God had
[37:32] handpicked and trained this young lad
[37:35] and I want you to realize that this
[37:37] choice in David uh was 100% God's
[37:42] choosing right when God told the prophet
[37:45] to go and anointed king for Israel right
[37:47] now Jesse which was David's father was a
[37:50] righteous man and did not have
[37:53] confidence in David you can't trust
[37:56] righteous
[37:57] men job tried to put his faith I I I I
[38:01] can if we could kind of dramatize you
[38:03] know job was going through some time he
[38:05] said you know what let me call up the
[38:07] brothers from church I need someone to
[38:09] come and encourage me I need some
[38:10] encouraging so he set his house up he's
[38:12] going through his wife had done forsaken
[38:15] him is up in the up in the bedroom the
[38:16] door slammed and locked right and he's
[38:19] just dealing with stuff so he prepare at
[38:20] the house he prepared some food and some
[38:23] and some water and he invited them in
[38:25] and they came inside they and and the
[38:27] Bible says that they rent and they
[38:28] prayed and all that kind of stuff and in
[38:29] one just kind of scratched his b and
[38:31] said what' you
[38:33] do what sin did you do job and job was
[38:37] like what I called you guys here to
[38:39] encourage me right right the Bible says
[38:42] they were people from his church they
[38:44] were his friends right so you can't
[38:46] trust in righteous men all right right
[38:49] you can't trust in righteous men the
[38:51] prophet that was ordained for that day
[38:53] which was Samuel when he went into the
[38:55] house he saw the first son and said
[38:57] indeed this is the king and God said no
[39:01] that's right and that was God's prophet
[39:03] of the day no this choice and and every
[39:08] choice and that's why God wants us to
[39:10] fully look to him every choice has to be
[39:14] 100% God's word it can't be mixed in
[39:17] with nothing else it can't be mixed in
[39:20] with nothing else it's got to be 100%
[39:24] God in order for you to have have
[39:27] confidence right and so when David's
[39:29] training was done you know uh he sent
[39:32] them away so we're going to go and read
[39:34] uh First Samuels uh chapter
[39:36] 17 uh
[39:38] 32-40 because we're going to see how um
[39:41] after David uh received his training
[39:44] we're going to see how things transpire
[39:47] down make sure
[39:50] check all right and so it says here and
[39:54] David said to Saul let no man 's heart
[39:56] fell because of him thy servant will go
[39:59] and fight this Philistine I want you to
[40:01] know that that was the message for the
[40:04] time that was the message from the for
[40:07] that time because they were cing away uh
[40:10] Goliath was making his boast they were
[40:12] cing away and David came up here he saw
[40:13] this he said oh hold on a second no this
[40:16] this you guys may believe in that but I
[40:20] have a word from God and David told uh
[40:23] Saul let no man heart fail because of
[40:25] him thy servant go and fight that was
[40:27] the message now look at Saul's reply and
[40:30] Saul said to David Thou Art not able to
[40:32] go against this Philistine to fight with
[40:35] him for thou art but a youth and he is a
[40:38] man of war from his youth I want to tell
[40:41] you right now if you're in a position
[40:43] where God has you've left your position
[40:46] I want I want you to understand that God
[40:49] rejected Saul as king but really it was
[40:52] Saul rejecting himself as King by not
[40:55] keeping the word wow and so when you
[40:58] reject the word you you're still a son
[41:01] right God can't God can't he That's my
[41:04] boy he has to say That's my boy but
[41:06] you'll lose your position and you see
[41:09] the you see the attitude of Saul when
[41:11] the message came instead of saying amen
[41:14] he argued with it
[41:17] wow you can't believe the message and
[41:19] not be in position right you can't be in
[41:22] the in the message by not and not be in
[41:24] position which means that you have to be
[41:25] obeying the word of God right and so
[41:28] Saul and so of course David being who he
[41:31] was cuz David even still David still
[41:33] knew that Saul was righteous and David
[41:36] said unto Saul thy servant kept his
[41:38] father's sheep and there came a lion and
[41:39] a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[41:41] and I went out after him and smote him
[41:43] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[41:45] when he arose against me I caught him by
[41:47] a bear and smote him and slew him so now
[41:49] David is explaining how he um he's given
[41:51] his testimony now because the word
[41:54] wasn't enough and some times you know
[41:57] and and and I like how brother brandom
[41:59] uh typed this uh um typed a statement uh
[42:02] to today how um when uh Thomas when
[42:06] Jesus Christ had been resurrected and
[42:09] was standing before them Thomas said I
[42:11] won't believe it until I see the scars
[42:13] on your hand and Jesus said okay here
[42:16] are the scars let you I'll let you put
[42:18] your put your fingers through them and
[42:20] then he believed and brother brandom
[42:21] typed that to how some people won't
[42:23] receive the Holy Ghost without sensation
[42:26] and God will do it for him he'll give
[42:28] them the Holy Ghost with a sensation
[42:31] just because they're his child right so
[42:35] sometimes it it some for some people the
[42:37] word comes it should be enough and
[42:39] that's why and that's why Jesus said it
[42:42] great it's greater to have faith without
[42:45] seeing any evidence without having any
[42:47] evidence without seeing anything
[42:49] standing but just to take the word and
[42:51] receive the word it's greater right so
[42:54] Saul should have just took the word but
[42:56] now he got a testimony right and now he
[42:58] uhh he believes so we're going to go
[42:59] down to uh verse 37 and David said
[43:02] moreover the Lord that delivered me out
[43:03] of the Paul of the lion and out of the
[43:05] Paul of the bear he would deliver me out
[43:06] of the hand of this Philistine and Saul
[43:09] said unto David go and the Lord be with
[43:11] you so now he
[43:12] believes but you know when you've lost
[43:16] your position and and and and you know
[43:19] how it you know how it is when you're
[43:20] trying to to witness or not witness but
[43:23] talk about the message of people that
[43:24] have backslid or people that may have
[43:27] not understand the message you give them
[43:29] an answer that should be enough but it's
[43:32] not enough come on trth but it's not
[43:36] enough you answered their question but
[43:38] it's not enough for them right so now we
[43:41] have so now Saul said said unto David go
[43:44] and the Lord be with thee and Saul
[43:46] armored David with his armor and put a
[43:49] helmet of brass upon his head and also
[43:51] he armed him with a coat of male so now
[43:53] Saul is trying to interject his idea
[43:56] into this right and David went along
[44:00] with it David GED the sword his sword
[44:02] upon his armor in verse 39 and he is say
[44:04] to go for he had not proved it and David
[44:07] said unto Saul I cannot go with these
[44:09] and I'm telling you right now when
[44:10] you've received the baptism of the Holy
[44:12] Spirit you won't be able to listen to No
[44:15] Other
[44:16] Voices praise God it is against your
[44:19] nature that's right you know how it is
[44:21] when a person tries to touch fire no one
[44:24] out there is trying to touch fire unless
[44:26] they're insane because it goes against
[44:29] their nature and I'm telling you when
[44:31] when you have the baptism of the Holy
[44:32] Spirit when someone tries to give you
[44:34] something that's not word even even if
[44:37] even in your mind when you're struggling
[44:38] with it you're rejected that's right
[44:41] brother right because this thing that
[44:43] was placed inside you before the
[44:46] foundation of the world was God's choice
[44:49] 100% amen and it wasn't your choice
[44:52] right amen so David said in the song I
[44:56] cannot go with these for I have not
[44:58] proved them right these these these
[45:00] things that now I want to tell you right
[45:02] now Saul had victories with that armor
[45:06] Saul had victories with that armor Saul
[45:08] Saul killed the enemy and protected them
[45:11] but this was a new day wow wow this was
[45:16] a new day and God wanted to do something
[45:19] new God wanted to expound upon those
[45:22] victories right and that's why uh uh uh
[45:25] they after this Victory you'll notice
[45:27] when they danc they said Saul killed so
[45:29] and so but David killed
[45:31] more right David killed more the pro the
[45:34] prophet said that God can do more with
[45:37] you in one year than you can do in 50
[45:39] years yourself in your
[45:42] life amen right so he said I cannot go
[45:45] with these I have not proved them and
[45:47] David put them to the side and he took
[45:49] his staff and found five smooth Stones
[45:52] because he knew that this worked and I
[45:54] can imagine in heaven
[45:56] right that before the scene is happening
[45:59] because God was watching over David and
[46:01] I can see an angel and and and God was
[46:03] also watching over the camp of the
[46:05] Israelites and I could see God see
[46:07] Goliath just boasting and the and the
[46:09] children of Israel just cowering he's
[46:11] just like man you have to understand
[46:14] that when God has chosen you his name is
[46:17] attached to you which is why when you
[46:20] find yourself in certain situations that
[46:22] are not pleasing to God he's got to say
[46:25] something and he's not proud because his
[46:28] it's not about how good you are and
[46:30] that's why a lot of people get it wrong
[46:32] it's not about how good you are it's
[46:34] about God's grace before the foundation
[46:36] of the world right the Bible says while
[46:38] we were yet sinners Christ loved us he
[46:42] still loved you your name was still
[46:44] attached to him prise God right and so
[46:47] he had found these uh so he found these
[46:50] uh five Stones he had and I can and as I
[46:52] was saying as I could see uh let's say a
[46:56] uh a scene in heaven where an angel came
[46:59] to God's watching Goliath and the angel
[47:01] came up to uh came up to the Lord and
[47:03] said and God was like hey how's how's my
[47:06] servant David doing man David he slew a
[47:09] lion he slew the Bear right and I'm
[47:12] telling you right now he had 500 sheep
[47:14] to watch over and he didn't lose not one
[47:18] standing on your word and God said
[47:20] That's my boy now he's ready now he said
[47:24] go and anoint Jesse to send him some
[47:26] food to go to the scene over here and
[47:28] the Angel's like wait you're not going
[47:29] to prepare David for what he's walking
[47:31] into I don't need to he's ready am he's
[47:35] on the word now I'm telling you right
[47:36] now that when you get to a point where
[47:38] God has his confidence inside of you it
[47:41] doesn't matter what situation you walk
[47:42] into you don't need to be prepared oh oh
[47:45] well let me just hold up I need to pray
[47:46] about oh I need to start studying my
[47:48] scriptures no when you have the word
[47:50] when the word has come to you and you
[47:52] have the word the Bible says speak amen
[47:55] that's what we're being back that's what
[47:57] we're being restored back to just speak
[47:59] the word and God had confidence in David
[48:02] that when he went to the scene without
[48:04] without knowing nothing he was ready
[48:07] Hallelujah I'm telling you we've
[48:09] received the same Spirit right now and I
[48:11] don't know what you're going through
[48:12] right now but you can just speak
[48:15] Hallelujah you can just speak thank you
[48:17] Jesus speak the word there's nothing
[48:20] greater than the word amen right and so
[48:22] and and so we know we know we know how
[48:24] the rest of the story goes
[48:26] and um eventually eventually uh David
[48:29] slew slew the uh slew Goliath and but I
[48:33] want you to know that what happened
[48:35] afterwards is that action because
[48:38] remember David David was a type of
[48:40] Christ and when Israel saw this little
[48:43] little kid go up there no armor on
[48:46] meaning he wasn't mixed in with
[48:47] denominational thinking or any man's
[48:50] idea he came out there with just a h h
[48:52] some stones and a little skinny guy
[48:55] right the enemy even confessed you're
[48:58] not much before but when David who was
[49:01] standing on the word of God swung his
[49:04] little uh slingshot the Bible says the
[49:06] the stone sunk into Goliath didn't just
[49:09] tap him it sunk into him right because
[49:11] there was an anointing behind it and he
[49:13] fell everybody's eyes popped open the
[49:17] enemy's eyes popped open oh uh the
[49:19] israelit eyes popped open and when David
[49:21] slew the head and lifted it up and and
[49:24] they saw the Philistines begin to run it
[49:27] gave the children of Israel courage to
[49:29] go get their restoration back glory to
[49:33] God it gave them the courage to go get
[49:36] their restoration back and I'm telling
[49:37] you right now Jesus is in heaven right
[49:40] now with death's head and he's hanging
[49:42] it he's already defeated what is
[49:47] fear what is there to
[49:50] fear what is there to fear cancer
[49:54] poverty it's all already been defeated
[49:57] glory to God it's already been defeated
[50:00] we should have the same exact fire that
[50:03] these children Israel and I want to tell
[50:04] you that the Bible says when they went
[50:06] back to go get their land the the the
[50:09] tents of the Philistines were in there
[50:11] and it says not only did they get their
[50:13] land back but they got The Spoils of
[50:16] what the Philistines had they got more
[50:18] than what they lost
[50:22] back God doesn't change Hallelujah
[50:26] God doesn't change some people may not
[50:28] believe the Old Testament I'll believe
[50:30] it God does not change that's right
[50:34] God Amen all right and so and so that is
[50:39] just a little that's that's that's a
[50:40] little bit of um what we have in the Old
[50:44] Testament because we want to we always
[50:46] kind of want to end it with Christ
[50:47] everything has got to point back to
[50:49] Christ right and so as we've been
[50:51] reading in our opening scripture of um
[50:54] with Matthew 17
[50:56] uh and how we see this beautiful moment
[50:58] where Jesus is being glorified and Peter
[51:01] is seeing it it was a preview of what
[51:03] was to come and what the prophet said
[51:06] was that was the adoption of of Christ
[51:09] God was adopting his son now he was
[51:11] always a son and that's what you got to
[51:14] always remember it's always a son and
[51:16] Christ didn't lose anything CH we it was
[51:20] us that lost things it was Adam that
[51:22] lost right that's why even though Adam
[51:24] was the direct spoken word of God he
[51:27] couldn't die for you so that's why you
[51:29] can't put your faith in a man right some
[51:32] people want to worship prophets some
[51:34] people want to worship men if Adam
[51:36] himself which was a direct spoken word
[51:39] of God not born of sex or anything still
[51:43] couldn't die on a Christ because he
[51:44] failed to keep the word how much more a
[51:47] man that you may uh that we may have
[51:49] high regard for it's got to be Christ
[51:53] right Christ was the second Adam and so
[51:55] now here's Christ being adopted and it
[51:58] was a preview God was adopting his son
[52:00] and what people don't understand is
[52:02] adopting doesn't mean that you're just
[52:03] come you're just going into some uh some
[52:06] house or some CER to go and adopt a kid
[52:09] no Christ was always his son but he had
[52:12] confidence in him because he had gone
[52:15] and done his will he had confidence in
[52:17] him and the Bible says that Moses and
[52:19] Elijah were there the law Justice Peter
[52:22] James and John Faith Love and Hope were
[52:24] there as a witness to show he's ready
[52:28] right he's ready so now this glorified
[52:30] State uh uh uh that that they saw Jesus
[52:33] in what is the end result of what
[52:36] restoration is which means God wants to
[52:39] have confidence in you to go and speak
[52:41] the word right and so God is not when
[52:44] you read the Bible and that's this is
[52:45] one thing I love about reading the Bible
[52:47] is God it's not just
[52:49] stories if you read the Bible as just a
[52:51] story you'll miss it God's Not Looking
[52:54] Just for Jesus to to be in that state
[52:56] but he's looking for me and you to be
[52:58] there too amen he's looking for me and
[53:00] you to be there too as well right so um
[53:04] just to go over a couple of things when
[53:07] when um when they were in this uh
[53:10] beautiful moment and I think the Bible
[53:12] says that it was a vision it says that
[53:15] Jesus was talking with Moses and Elijah
[53:18] right it doesn't say he was arguing with
[53:20] them it doesn't say he was arguing the
[53:22] Bible says how can two walk unless they
[53:25] agree right he was conversating about
[53:27] his position in the word with them uh
[53:30] and if you can turn to if uh you don't
[53:31] have to turn but I can just read it in
[53:33] Luke 9 9:
[53:37] 30-31 uh it says here and behold there
[53:41] talked with him two men which were Moses
[53:44] and Elias who appeared in glory and
[53:46] spake of his decease which he should
[53:48] accomplish at Jerusalem so they were
[53:51] speaking and conversing about God's uh
[53:53] position in the scripture cuz we know
[53:55] that he would have to go and be
[53:56] crucified in Jerusalem which by the way
[54:00] was in Judah right amen which was in
[54:03] Judah so I remember the pastor had made
[54:06] a comment before how some people don't
[54:08] believe in the Old Testament and they
[54:09] say and you'll see a lot of people a lot
[54:12] of uh uh uh spiritual people too say
[54:14] well the old testament's done and gone
[54:15] away we don't have to follow that but no
[54:18] Jesus was in this Vision talking with
[54:20] Moses he wanted to hear what Moses had
[54:23] to say right can you imagine if God
[54:26] himself said you know what I'm finished
[54:28] with the Old Testament now there's a
[54:31] phenomenon in nature that we see that
[54:33] after a rain comes a rainbow and and and
[54:37] what people don't understand about this
[54:40] is this rainbow because a lot of times
[54:41] people look at it from a carnal
[54:43] standpoint you know they'll say oh they
[54:45] put rainbows on stickers and on t-shirts
[54:47] and they'll take pictures and say oh
[54:48] this rainbow is a beautiful thing right
[54:51] but there's a lot of death behind that
[54:53] rainbow and that rainbow was actually a
[54:56] testament to God that I won't do
[54:58] something it's a promise that God looks
[55:01] at every time he sees because God didn't
[55:03] just send the flood because he wanted to
[55:05] send the flood man man man's sin in the
[55:08] imagination of man's heart caused God to
[55:11] flood and destroy everything so God said
[55:14] you know what I will never do this again
[55:16] I'll make a covenant every time you see
[55:18] a rainbow I promise I'll never flood the
[55:20] word the world again so no God still
[55:23] believes the Old Testament if God can
[55:25] keep the Old Testament so can
[55:28] we so can
[55:31] we
[55:32] amen and and and so and so we and we and
[55:36] we can't just we can't just we can't
[55:37] just look at Moses because we got Elijah
[55:39] over here and people have a problem with
[55:41] Elijah too right people have a problem
[55:44] with Elijah too and when we go down
[55:46] further in the scriptures for uh
[55:49] Matthew and um and um the the disciples
[55:54] asked a very good good question in
[55:56] reference uh to Elijah um Let me let me
[56:01] uh uh let me just pull this up here and
[56:04] and it says here in uh verse 10 uh it
[56:07] says and his disciples asked him saying
[56:10] why then say the scribes that Elias must
[56:13] first come right and so because they're
[56:16] caught in a vision and they're looking
[56:18] at Elijah they see his hair color they
[56:20] see his his height they see his shoes
[56:22] they see his his his his teeth and all
[56:25] him talking and stuff like that right
[56:27] and and they see Elias but they don't
[56:30] see Elias and so it's important for you
[56:33] to have Revelation right and um and and
[56:39] they had it wrong where they had it
[56:42] wrong is when they said why then say the
[56:45] scribes cuz now you're putting it back
[56:47] on men right and men can't give you re
[56:50] can't give you Revelation I want to tell
[56:51] you right now the message that we have
[56:53] today can't be explained by men men you
[56:58] can't have a man to explain this thing
[57:00] to you right the message is not
[57:02] confusing but it's written in a way to
[57:06] confuse right so that some people see it
[57:08] and some people don't right so you can't
[57:11] look at it from a man's standpoint or
[57:14] you'll miss it right so when they said
[57:18] the scribes they were putting their
[57:19] Revelation on men right then and there
[57:22] you can tell that they missed it right
[57:24] they're putting it back on a
[57:25] denomination right but I love the word
[57:28] because he broke it down to them right
[57:31] he broke things he broke things down to
[57:32] him and Jesus and so in verse 11 it says
[57:35] and Jesus answered and said unto them El
[57:37] Li truly first truly shall come shall
[57:41] first come and to do what restore
[57:44] restore all things how can you have a
[57:47] restoration without recognizing
[57:49] Elijah I don't know how you're going to
[57:51] get
[57:52] it right but I say unto you that Elias
[57:55] is all is come already and they knew him
[57:58] not but have done unto him whatsoever
[58:00] they listed likewise also shall also the
[58:03] son of man uh uh Al shall also the son
[58:06] of man suffer of them then it says and
[58:09] this is the key point then the disciples
[58:11] understood that he spake unto them of
[58:14] who John the Baptist now they saw Elijah
[58:18] before they were looking at Elijah in
[58:20] the Old Testament and a lot of times
[58:22] people look in the Bible they're looking
[58:23] for they're looking at figures from an
[58:25] old time but this Elijah Spirit would
[58:29] become would come five times it was
[58:32] Elijah it was Elisha John the Baptist
[58:36] brother brandham and then the spirit
[58:38] will come again also to the Jews and it
[58:41] takes Christ to help see who that Elijah
[58:45] is for the day so when those people in
[58:47] uh and and those Jews you can and that's
[58:50] why you can be a prophet I mean not a
[58:52] prophet but you can prophesy I guarantee
[58:55] you right then and now the only way
[58:56] those Jews are going to be able to see
[58:58] Elijah uh Elijah is through Christ it's
[59:01] not going to be a seminary it's not
[59:02] going to be a man it's not going to be
[59:04] some idea it's not going to be some
[59:06] schooling it's just going to be the
[59:08] simple explanation of God saying that's
[59:11] him right and so that's why we stress
[59:13] the importance of the baptism holy of
[59:15] the holy spirit because he does the same
[59:18] exact thing that he always does in that
[59:21] time he pointed them to Elijah and when
[59:23] you receive the baptism Holy Spirit and
[59:26] don't see Elijah that's not Christ all
[59:29] right that's not Christ spirit because
[59:33] Christ will always point to Elijah and
[59:35] the Elijah for the day amen amen the
[59:38] Elijah for the day right they missed it
[59:43] but Christ was there to give it to them
[59:44] right so we're going to navigate and and
[59:47] this is an important place because we're
[59:48] going to kind of go through and navigate
[59:49] through some more things because um the
[59:52] reason why these guys could see it uh
[59:55] and I think brother Jack had made a
[59:56] statement is restoration is
[59:59] predestination right meaning Grace plays
[1:00:02] a huge role in all of this you can't
[1:00:05] explain these things that's the
[1:00:06] beautiful thing about Grace is you just
[1:00:08] can't explain it right it's not enough
[1:00:10] being born in a message church it's not
[1:00:13] enough going to a message events and
[1:00:16] things like that no before the
[1:00:18] foundation of the world you had to have
[1:00:20] had something placed inside of you for
[1:00:22] you to see it and it has to be 100%
[1:00:26] God's desire inside of you to be able to
[1:00:28] see it it can't be mixed in with
[1:00:30] anything else so Grace and the thing
[1:00:34] that Grace does is it humbles you
[1:00:36] because it makes you realize you were
[1:00:38] never in control to begin with amen you
[1:00:42] never had a choice in it to begin with
[1:00:44] right a lot a lot of times people uh you
[1:00:48] know and all of us were that way all of
[1:00:50] us were this way uh the story we talked
[1:00:53] about this before the story that was in
[1:00:54] the uh of the women that was in the bar
[1:00:56] that brother brandham had went to and
[1:00:58] this is
[1:00:59] why and this is why you can have a
[1:01:02] message church but if there's nobody
[1:01:05] inside the message to receive receive
[1:01:08] the message it's it's in vain that woman
[1:01:11] that was in the bar that brother Brandon
[1:01:13] was trying to go down and tear the place
[1:01:16] down he wanted God to burn it up God
[1:01:18] wanted to have
[1:01:20] church in a
[1:01:22] bar with a bunch of people wasn't
[1:01:25] Christians because there was someone on
[1:01:27] the inside that had something on the
[1:01:29] inside of them that could receive the
[1:01:31] word that's what church is right and it
[1:01:34] was through predestination uh that she
[1:01:36] that that that she received that right
[1:01:39] so now uh as I said before um you know
[1:01:43] um pred uh restoration is predestination
[1:01:46] and meaning Grace plays a huge role in
[1:01:48] it so when Jesus Took Peter John and
[1:01:50] James to be transfigured that was Grace
[1:01:53] picking them out of all the people that
[1:01:55] were there right that was Grace picking
[1:01:57] them to to be able to see a preview of
[1:02:00] what he was expecting of them and he
[1:02:02] ended it with a hear ye himym right so
[1:02:06] that was Grace that did that for that so
[1:02:08] in order to be saved you have to be
[1:02:09] restored with an end goal of glor of of
[1:02:11] being glorified right so Romans 8 uh
[1:02:14] Romans 8:30 tells us moreover whom he
[1:02:17] did predestinate them he also called and
[1:02:21] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:02:24] and whom he justified them he also
[1:02:27] glorified restoration the end goal is
[1:02:29] for us to be glorified with the glory of
[1:02:33] the Lord right with the glory of the
[1:02:37] Lord right so
[1:02:39] um it's it's it's uh uh it's it's Grace
[1:02:43] that does the work and it's and it's
[1:02:45] it's the reason why God says follow thou
[1:02:47] me it's the reason why God says I don't
[1:02:50] want your thinking God has dealt with
[1:02:52] man's thinking for so long
[1:02:54] and it's always failed him it's always
[1:02:57] caused issues it always caused division
[1:03:00] to the point where God is now at a space
[1:03:02] and time where he says it has to be 100%
[1:03:05] the word or not the word right in order
[1:03:07] for it to uh uh to accomplish something
[1:03:10] right so when we're praying for a
[1:03:12] restoration when we're looking for a
[1:03:14] restoration when we're looking for a
[1:03:15] healing when we're looking for a
[1:03:16] Deliverance when we're looking for a
[1:03:17] blessing let's make sure that we've
[1:03:20] received the confidence to get it let's
[1:03:23] make sure that we receive the confidence
[1:03:25] to get it which comes through Christ
[1:03:27] amen so we'll end this in a
[1:03:31] prayer Lord Jesus Lord we' spoke your
[1:03:35] word oh Lord
[1:03:36] God Lord this isn't the ideas of man

[1:03:56] want to go down that route but Lord you
[1:03:59] are the one that made the choice it was

[1:05:50] shared there and and uh hear ye him I I
[1:05:55] I I thank God for that thank God when he
[1:05:57] started off say restoration focal point
[1:05:59] of the Bible I had no idea he was going
[1:06:01] to take that into the story of David and
[1:06:04] Goliath
[1:06:07] wow but a a real real wonderful thought
[1:06:10] and and I guess I never looked at this
[1:06:14] armor that Saul was giving
[1:06:16] David um Saul had seen many victories in
[1:06:20] that
[1:06:21] Army but it was a new season

[1:06:50] of the other beautiful things in in all
[1:06:52] the the the uh when you think about
[1:06:55] Saul's life um he just seems like a
[1:06:59] complete failure rejected by God uh as a
[1:07:05] king but could not be
[1:07:08] rejected as a
[1:07:11] son that's that's that's that's powerful

[1:12:11] app is dollar sign spirit and Truth tzel
[1:12:14] giving John 423 and PayPal is the same
[1:12:17] giving at John 423 org and our mailing
[1:12:19] address is at the bottom of the screen I
[1:12:21] don't think I've mentioned this on
[1:12:23] stream but uh those that have our church
[1:12:27] app we are going through some transition
[1:12:30] with this app um the company that we
[1:12:33] were using has decided not to support
[1:12:35] the platform anymore and they were
[1:12:38] trying to move us to a new platform
[1:12:39] which we introduced to you a couple
[1:12:41] years ago but on that new platform they
[1:12:43] would not give us the King James version
[1:12:45] of the Bible and um and I know that's
[1:12:49] the version that brother brandom use
[1:12:50] amen so I like to just stay with that uh
[1:12:53] I know there's a lot of new versions out
[1:12:56] there a lot of them and some of them
[1:12:58] actually have taken certain scriptures
[1:13:00] out uh so you actually miss some of the
[1:13:03] meaning and uh you know there there's
[1:13:05] another very popular that one person
[1:13:07] introduced me to was the Amplified
[1:13:10] version and um I'll tell you the reason
[1:13:13] that I didn't use the Amplified and I
[1:13:15] don't use it too much anymore what
[1:13:17] happened with the Amplified version
[1:13:18] there was a a very smart lady uh that
[1:13:22] these uh uh um uh different Publishers
[1:13:26] got behind her and said that uh since
[1:13:29] she's so smart she studied so much about
[1:13:31] the Bible we want her to kind of put her
[1:13:33] Bible together and we'll support her and
[1:13:36] uh we'll make it the Amplified version
[1:13:38] and uh I just say hey something wrong
[1:13:40] with that the woman not even supposed to
[1:13:43] preach right so something wrong here and
[1:13:46] and I said I I I don't think I'm going
[1:13:48] to read this one uh too much there's
[1:13:50] certain ones I look at and I m m m
[1:13:53] sometime you be missing the meaning uh
[1:13:55] because people try they got one even
[1:13:57] called The Message Bible that you got to
[1:13:59] be careful with right they call it the
[1:14:02] message and you look at the we follow
[1:14:04] them at no no this man that wrote The
[1:14:06] Message Bible just wrote a Bible so his
[1:14:08] Grand grandkids could understand well
[1:14:11] it's going to like the brother say it's
[1:14:12] going to take Revelation from God for
[1:14:14] these things but you don't you don't
[1:14:15] dumb
[1:14:23] with a seventh grade education explain
[1:14:25] the Bible to Us Praise the Lord so just
[1:14:28] be careful you know and I so I'm very
[1:14:30] very um um um uh committed to the King
[1:14:35] James version uh of the Bible amen so we
[1:14:39] are working on getting a a new app up
[1:14:41] and running uh for you all and and we'll
[1:14:44] let you know once that is ready to go
[1:14:47] amen and like I mentioned if um I'm
[1:14:49] still doing the the one-year Bible
[1:14:51] reading plan and if if you would like to
[1:14:53] still join me on the journey I can send

[1:16:15] hearts on this sermon of hear ye hym and
[1:16:18] um God just um so much that was shared
[1:16:23] even um I know Lord just even some of
[1:16:26] the things that I want to get to on

[1:16:33] very very grateful how the holy spirit
[1:16:36] is just kind of putting us all in this
[1:16:38] Channel and uh Lord we're we're looking
[1:16:41] for uh so much and I I think it's so
[1:16:44] important as he said the restoration is
[1:16:46] not just the the the uh the physical
[1:16:49] things but it's the spiritual things
[1:16:51] that we must really catch because the
[1:16:53] spirit of things are Eternal things so
[1:16:57] Lord we uh pray that you would just help
[1:16:58] us Lord to meditate on the things that
[1:17:00] we've heard prayer request has come
[1:17:02] tonight for little hos the enemy
[1:17:06] attacking his body and um Lord I the
[1:17:11] parents told me a wonderful testimony of
[1:17:14] how you kept him from danger uh recently
[1:17:17] Lord and now hear the devil coming
[1:17:19] attacking him again and uh we just pray
[1:17:22] that you would just just touch him and
[1:17:24] God that you bring healing to his body
[1:17:26] and that whatever it is that it will not
[1:17:30] spread through that house but Lord it
[1:17:32] will stop lord right there with brother
[1:17:34] hos and leave his body so father we pray
[1:17:38] that you would touch him even right now
[1:17:39] and in between him and whatever the
[1:17:41] condition is we place the blood of the
[1:17:44] Lord Jesus knowing that you were wounded
[1:17:46] for his transgressions bruised for his
[1:17:48] iniquities the chastisement of his peace
[1:17:51] is upon you with your stripes we declare
[1:17:54] healing God we ask that you look upon
[1:17:56] the Saints as they prepare to leave this
[1:17:58] place but not your presence go with us
