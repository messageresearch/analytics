Uh we want to um again thank the Lord to have all the saints from Tucson, Arizona. Amazing Grace Temple. Thank God for their pastor, Brother Caleb. uh been a friend of mine for a number of years. And as he was saying on um Friday night, how you know you got a good friend is that when you are disconnected just for a little bit, when you get reconnected, you just pick up right where you left off. And uh that's just the way it's been. And you know for for for some reason um typically brother Caleb is always connected when we make a move. When we were in Green Acres the first time he come to preach for us and we were uh in the process of thinking about relocating somewhere else and and in the middle of his sermon he just stopped. They said, "Brother Jack, you are uh the Lord said you're leaning in a particular direction. Just go ahead and go in that direction. He's with you." And I was I was leaning because, you know, we were moving from uh paying, you know, one um thing for rent, but it was going to double and our congregation had not doubled. Uh so it was a little stressful to kind of make a decision like that. And um you know it was you know just just I didn't know which way to go but that word just encouraged me and we went forward and uh the Lord took us to that other place and and we we were able to sustain for roughly 13 years uh there and uh God was good to us and then when it was time for us to leave that place brother Caleb was the one that preached the last sermon in that place and he preached and we packed up and had to move out on that day and we went to a school, you know, for a a season roughly about 4 years and it's been 4 years since he's been here with us. Uh and um so we we were there at the school and you know we you know I was telling brother Jesse last night just there's a number of things that were happening during that season and we we felt that we were in position to purchase and that we have something but the Lord had not opened that door yet. And uh so this came available to us and we got here in July July 30th of this year. So, uh, at the same time, Brother Caleb was calling me saying, "Brother, I I just got y'all on my heart. I just got y'all on my heart." Said, "Brother, I don't know why you happen to call all the time around when we moving and everything, but uh, I'm so happy to have him." Amen. I I appreciate appreciate them. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We We have a lot of history. We We've come from the same grounds. Amen. And uh so we got a lot of history. We go way back. Uh so we we just thank God, you know, for for all that he has done throughout the years and and all the saints that have come. Amen. To join uh brother brother Caleb. 22 saints uh from Arizona. What a blessing. Y'all, y'all done put some pressure on the saints in Spirit and Truth Tabernacle cuz uh I I know they wouldn't want me to show up in Arizona by myself and we done I mean some some saints say I drove all the way over there. &gt;&gt; 32-hour drive to get here. Say I know brother Jack ain't going to show up by itself. So I'm going to try to make sure we put some time to give everybody opportunity to go out to Tucson with us. Amen. for uh for some services. Amen. We thank God. I wanted to also just um uh mention I got a a card here that says with gratitude and um says for your for you and your thoughtfulness, blessings uh abundantly. And this is from uh Auntie Judy Johnson. Um she just wanted to express her thanks. She also sent a a love offering to the church uh for uh the way that you all supported the family uh during this time. We just want to say thank you uh to each and everyone. The sisters got in and just did what Spirit and Truth does. Amen. And and and I I heard it was done with such such excellence that um there was um some um some people uh saying, "Do y'all got do y'all have business cards? They want to hire you." You know, and I said, "Yeah, that's that that means you're doing things with excellence." And and that's that that's a real blessing. So, thank you all the sisters that that fixed something, that gave money towards it, that uh serve the family, just just everything. I really appreciate you all uh doing that. Um Sister Tina tried to get everybody together and and everybody responds to uh very well. So, thank you all so much. Thank you, Sister Tina, for making all of that happen. It was a real blessing. Amen. We uh we supporting Amen. um brother Troy, my sister Trina, and the loss of the uncle from uh his mother's side. And now we got another uncle from daddy's side. Amen. That we have to bury in a couple weeks. And um you know, but but I wanted to just also say uh brother Troy did a wonderful job. Amen. And the sermon on yesterday leadership and uh I was just very very blessed. Amen. and to see how the Lord just used him to walk right through that sermon. I think people left there with something to think about. Amen. And and and I just I was just very very blessed. Amen. Just to see how God used him. Uh so we we just we just thank God. It's it's something about uh he was talking about that mantle responsibility and um you know we we feel that you know we are uh getting close to 60 and um so we realize you know uh hey we don't know how much time we got so we got to make sure we're passing on that mental responsibility to the next generation. Right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime people don't want to step up and get underneath the load. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you got to carry something. Jesus carried a cross and you got to take up your cross and follow Jesus. Yes, there's some responsibility here, but somebody got to carry it. Every generation got to have somebody willing to step up and carry the responsibility. Amen. Appreciate you, brother Troy. God bless you. God bless you. All right. Oh, let me also say this. musicians. This is what I'm talking about. Y'all, y'all got it. Thank y'all. Thumbs up. Thumbs up. I was just sharing some something with them, but this there there's I'm going to mention this and I'm going to let brother Keith come. So, there's a there's um um a gift is is is a beautiful thing to have, but discipline with the gift is actually a whole another level &gt;&gt; because I I know a lot of gifted people, but they're not disciplined, &gt;&gt; right? And and and they just do a lot of things that can actually disrupt the service rather than actually help the service. And uh and and I mean I this band getting together, they excited, you know, and I'm excited to have them together, but I just want them when they when when they get into other environments be disciplined and know how to handle themselves in every environment. And so I just had a little talk with them on Friday night and I see how they done adjusted. So I'm going to give them a thumbs up. This is what I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about. Man, I appreciate each and every one of them. Boy, I tell you this is this is this is this is I'm about ready to say spirit and truth 3.0. But but I thank God. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. What? What do we Okay. All right. Let's stand to our feet. Amen. Let's welcome uh brother Caleb Duron. And again, we thank God for his precious wife, Sister Ann, his precious daughter. Amen. Uh being with us, Naen. Like many of y'all have been waiting to see Naen for a long time. You finally got a chance to see her. 14 years in the making, but she's here. Praise the Lord. God bless you. God bless you. Let's sing this song. I was [Music] But now [Music] I was blind. Was blind. Now I see. Come on everybody with your hands raise. Amazing grace. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] We [Music] hallelujah. Give the Lord a hand of praise and worship. We can do better than that. Come on, we can worship. If nobody else can worship, we know we can worship. If nobody else is happy, we know we're happy. If people don't have the joy of the Lord, we know we've got the joy of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God be praised and praise be to God. Glad to be back in the house of the Lord. We had a wonderful time of fellowship yesterday. Uh all of us, we got to meet with brother Jack a little bit and we all, you know, uh in Arizona, they don't have water. There's no such thing as water. Ocean water that is. And so, uh when we get to see ocean water, that right, Brother Samuel, is that right? So when we get a chance to see ocean water, we're like, "Wow." You know, but y'all are you all It's be like us in the Grand Canyon. We've seen it. It's a hole in the ground. It's beautiful. But you all would be like, "Wow, look at this hole in the ground." &gt;&gt; You know, look at all this desert. Well, what about it? Uh and it it hardly ever rains in Tucson. And so it it raining every day here for an hour or less. It doesn't matter. It rained and we're excited to have rain. So, uh, but we're I appreciate it all the fellowship. Now, brother Jack said something there. Brother Jesse, my assistant pastor in Amazing Grace Temple. He and I talked about having arrange making arrangements to have different ones come out in December. Well, y'all may be seated. Go ahead. That's all right. If y'all want to go, it's okay. Y'all like you wanted to stop. I told the drummer he's supposed to get excited when Jack did said all that. He's supposed to go. He was scared. Uh, I said, "Let me have that stick." He said, "No, no, brothers. That's all right." Uh, and uh, but he said something about, we were talking about having you all come and, uh, he actually said, "Can we do January?" So, we could probably make that work even with the other brother. Might make it work for him, too. You know, we don't want to miss Santa Claus. So, and so, uh, but when he just said that we we stepped it up a notch, uh, I will go ahead and say this. You're all welcome to come when he comes. We'd like to have every single one of you. It's been I don't know how many years, Brother Jeff. How long has it been since we had them all at your house? &gt;&gt; 16 years. It's been that long, too. Okay. All right. It's I think it might be just a little bit longer. But I remember we'd never left that neighborhood. We lived in the same because here come Jeff in his van. And all they did was sing and sing and sing. And then we decided we'd walk down to church. And here's about Oh, I don't that neighborhood's never seen that many black people in that neighborhood ever. Plus all of us. And everybody's walking to church singing up and down Zion's glory. So I just thought it was wonderful. So you're welcome to come. We'd love to have you. And brother Smiley, come on back out. I didn't know that was Brother Smiley. I thought Brother Jeff was standing next to me. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Smiley. Brother Jeff, can y'all get by each other right quick? Go stand by. Was the y'all Go ahead. Look at this. I'm not Look at this. Look, twins. I know. I know people say y'all look alike, but you really y'all look this. That would be considered rude, but this time it's true. And my brother in the front, you could be like their little brother. So, I don't know if it's the head or the white hair. I don't know. But God bless you, brother Smile. Leave it up to somebody when you're trying to lose weight and look good. Leave it up to somebody who hasn't seen you in a few years to say, "Man, you're getting fat. I said, "Brother Smiley, you should have seen me 20 pounds ago." He goes, "Really?" He couldn't believe that. Like, that's this suit didn't fit. This suit didn't fit two months ago. All right. But anyway, God bless you. It's good to have friends. Good to be back in the house of God. And yeah, being brother Jack, we go back a long time. Brother Jack, what's the mystery? You see, Caleb is the one who said, "We're more than able to take the land." So, I think it's fitting that I call you every time it's time for you to take another piece of property. [Applause] I'm just [Music] &gt;&gt; that just kind of came out there. &gt;&gt; I don't know if that must have been the Lord cuz I was sitting there going, "Why is it so mysterious? This is what I'm supposed to be doing. &gt;&gt; Take the land. &gt;&gt; If it's time for you to take another piece of property, if Joshua or Caleb don't call you, don't take it. It's not yours." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was saying that as a joke. Lord, I'm sorry. That was serious. &gt;&gt; He knows what he's saying, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; All right, keep me on the time. We don't have to take too much time. The Lord willing, we'll be in and out. We know how it is here and we want to make sure we stay faithful to the time. So, would you open your Bibles to Genesis chapter 18 and verse 10? And I hope and pray that you all are able to come uh this evening. It'd be nice to have more support, especially for brother G. really appreciate, brother Jean. Uh, Brother Jean's always been very welcoming to myself. Uh, and I don't think there's ever been a time that you've introduced us, uh, Brother Jack, that I haven't come out here that he need to have me preach. &gt;&gt; So, I really appreciate his hospitality. Plus, I don't know, they came out a while back. You came when they came, didn't you? Yeah. That was that time that we all went to Sabino Canyon and it rained all the way up the hike and all the way down the hike. And we got up, well, it started to rain. We got about halfway up uh to the different places and I shouted down. I said, "This is not going to stop. Do y'all want to just turn around?" And all them Haitian brothers says, "We didn't come to leave, brother. Let's keep on going." And so here's Caleb again on the mountain taking people into the storm. I said, "Man, I don't know if this is going to be good." But, uh, we made it back down. We were soaked and it was a funny story and we had a good time with it. So, it's a memory we won't soon forget. Uh, and that's one of the rare times it rains. They kept saying, "It's supposed to rain. It's supposed to rain. Ah, it never rains in Tucson. And wouldn't you know it, it rained in Tucson that day. So, if you would read it together, let's read it together. 18 and verse 10. Oh, I guess I better get it. Hold on one second here. All right. And it reads like this. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him her him. Yeah. May God add a blessing to the reading of his words. Let's pray. Father, we love you. Ask you to bless the remainder of this service as you have already. We know you're here. So, I won't make you more welcome than you are. Lord, you're welcome to stay and to feed our souls. Get me out of the way. I pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask. For there is no other name greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. All right. Now, I use that scripture as an opener there. Uh and then I want to take you over to another place real quick if we could to John chapter 1. Amen. John chapter 1 and I want to say it's going to be um verse 47 and you'll see what I mean here in just a little bit. Verse 47. John chapter 1 verse 47. Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile. Nathaniel saith unto him, "Whence thouest whence knowest thou me?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee." Amen. We know what the scripture says then. He knew who he was. All right. Now, let me get this coat off real quick if you don't mind. &gt;&gt; You don't mind, do you? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Well, Jack, this is a nice place, &gt;&gt; but you know, none of this none of it none of it belongs to any of us, right? &gt;&gt; Even our church, it's ours, but it's not ours. And uh because I say that because everything belongs to the government, but everything belongs to the meek. So, I don't know how to weigh that out for you. &gt;&gt; But the meek do inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; Sorry, Mr. Trump. You're going to have to move out of one of your towers when I come back. I'm just saying build me one on the ocean. Oh, there is one on the ocean front. Marlargo is ours. [Music] &gt;&gt; This kind of talk could get me thrown in prison now, huh? I might get me in some good trouble. It belongs to us. Please treat it nice. &gt;&gt; Keep it sanctified and holy. Will you get all them riffraff out of there? &gt;&gt; Including your No, I'm just All right. All right. I stopped. I stopped. &gt;&gt; I stopped. You know, I I'll say this. Because of what Let me Let me give you my real thoughts on President Trump. You want to hear it? It's real good. No, it's good. Because of what he did for Jerusalem, I do believe he'll be there. I'm that serious. because there'll be people there that brother Brandon said, I don't know if he'll be bright or if he's going to be. I don't know what what the order of things going to be. But because he made Jerusalem the capital of Israel, something that had to have been done years and years ago because he did that one thing, I do believe that God is going to keep him alive. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to I'm going to go on to say this. He's not going to even know why he's alive. Because you see, the Bible does say, and brother Jesse got up one time and he preached, "When the trump of God shall sound, when the last trump sounds." And brother Jesse got up and goes, "You realize he can't be president no more. This is the last time Trump is going to sound." &gt;&gt; And I said, you know, there there's stuff too there. And then you got the uh the Jews, what they the the Israelites, they put that coin together. They have King Cyrus on one side and the profile of President Trump on the other side. And I said, "That's not a that's not a joke to them. I mean, Trump did what Cyrus did, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And on the reverse side, there's a third temple. Now, I know we joke around this, that, like him, different, black, white, and different. Don't matter. Obama, not Obama. It doesn't matter. This stuff is silly. This world's not my home. I'm voting for King Jesus. &gt;&gt; My allegiance stands there. &gt;&gt; It's not on any one man. White, black, brown, I don't care. I don't care if a if a Hispanic gets in office. It's not going to do me any world of good. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Except that every day would be Cinco de Mayo. I mean, that's about all. Make siestas legal. You know, &gt;&gt; the peso might get a little bit stronger. Just forget it. All right. But I want you to see something here. A while back when I was preaching the tabernacle, the Lord put on my heart uh when there was this anniversary of the seven seals being revealed. And the Lord put in my heart, it happened to me that one time, brother uh uh Jack, where everything fell in sequence. And when a meeting was on Monday, it was on Monday, Tuesday. Remember that when it happened a while back? And so, uh, I set out to read each sermon at the same time, at the same day that he did on purpose. And I think brother Alzer, you and I did that. You did that with me, didn't you? He got himself a seal book, went in my office at the house where I was living at the time where y'all stayed with us. And um, and we sat there and we went through each service. And uh, brother, the Lord put on my heart to to find what else is there. What else is there? Because people uh and I got nothing against this. Everybody wants to talk about the horse rider and uh what this means and what that means. And that's fine. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. But let me explain something real quick. The horse rider the horse rider is a is a is an authority on an a power on an authority. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And the rider changes horses. It changes colors and different things. In other words, different powers, different authorities, but the same person does all of them. You understand that? But here's what I want you to understand here. Those things would happen whether or not you and I knew about it or not. &gt;&gt; Whether it was revealed or not, it would still take place. &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord allowed brother Brandon to reveal those things to us so we wouldn't be in ignorance. We would be uh spiritually intelligent, if you will. Uh we would know the time, season, and so forth. We talked about that a little bit last night. But I got to thinking, and I don't mean this disrespectful. It's going to kind of sound that way, but my mindset was big deal &gt;&gt; because we know it now. The world knows it. Everybody knows it. So, what what defines bride and what defines people who know what we know? &gt;&gt; Because this is now common knowledge. This is not this is not something uh by the way, you know, the pale color in there is green. Correct? &gt;&gt; It's a shade of green. Y'all know that. &gt;&gt; Did you? Well, it is. And now, if you didn't know it, now you know it. But did you ever wonder that all the countries that surround Israel, did you ever notice the similarities of their flag colors? &gt;&gt; They're all black, white, red, and green, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For horse riders, powers, and they're all out there to seek and destroy Israel. And if we happen to get caught up in the mix, we'll get knocked out, too. Now, so what does that mean to you? Well, I'm saying this. I wanted to find out what else did brother Brandham say. Now, I'm going to need some interactions with some amens. If you got if you got them, if you got a bag, amens, throw them out here. All right. &gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you something. Now, did did brother Brandham when he got up and he preached. Now, if you pay attention to the seals when brother Brandham got up for uh and began to talk now, he said these things. He said the angel of the Lord came in the same night and wrote that down. Write this, write that, write this. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. So, Brother Brandham knew what the seal was &gt;&gt; before he got there. &gt;&gt; So, then why did he take so long to get there? &gt;&gt; Wow. Did you ever watch if you're listening to the first seal, it's this, it's that, it's this, it's reference to this, and let's go here and let's look there. Let's turn to this page here. Let's go to this book here. Let's go to that Bible scripture. And then at the end, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, boom, and there's your first seal. And he's excited. It's all over with. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Why'd he do it like that? If he knew it, why not just, you know, 10 minutes, I'm done. &gt;&gt; Prayer line time, right? &gt;&gt; No, there had to be something else going on. And so I talked to Brother Green like that. said, I said, "Brother Green," he goes, "Well," he said, "Caleb, Brother Brandham did say, he said that, I know there's something going on here, but I can count on my hand how many of you are catching up what's going on." That's right. &gt;&gt; He also said there was people sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting for thus revelations, and excusing, not even How many times you hear him say, "Write this down. If you want to write that down, if you want to write this down, but they weren't writing that stuff down. They were they were waiting for what's the seal." &gt;&gt; Right? So I started listening to it and I realized something that the revelation of the first seal begins at paragraph one okay &gt;&gt; of the first seal and ends at the last paragraph of the first seal. &gt;&gt; The revelation of se the second seal begins at paragraph 1 and it ends at the end of the second seal. The par the revelation of 3 4 5 6 and 7 each at the very beginning and at the end. In other words, every word that the prophet utters out of his mouth in this seal is the revelation of the entire first, second, third seal. You get it? &gt;&gt; The problem with all of us is that we're sitting here trying to dress ourselves with a horse ride of revelation, but that's like half a shoe on the wrong foot. There is more to this than that. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; There are things in there that he said that I thought to me holds more truth, Brother Smiley, than knowing who the horse rider is. There's stuff in there that means more to me as a person. In other words, what I have to do to prepare myself to get from here to there. &gt;&gt; Now, I did say prepare myself because the Bible said the wife has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Nobody gets the bride dressed. You all, you sisters have been married. You go in there and you got an outfit on. You might have a few people help you here and there, but the man don't see you, the husband don't see you, the best man don't see you, the minister don't see you, your dad don't see you. You're in there by yourself getting prepared for a wedding. &gt;&gt; And the same approach is with the groom. Is that right? We're all trying to keep the best man whose job is to try to keep the group from running out the side door. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, watch this. So, I went through this and I started to comb through the seals here and I started to find things that say, you know what, that registers something to me. That means something to me. And I find out that there is a mystery within a mystery within a mystery tied into these seven seals. And if you go back, I want to just kind of wet your your lips a little bit. And hopefully you'll go back. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And you'll begin to read the seals. &gt;&gt; And if you don't got a seal book, you should. If you don't, go order yourself one. &gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the voice of God's got an influx of seal orders. I wonder wherever I'm going preaching this because I'm curious about it. But go and start reading through it. &gt;&gt; All right? And instead of finding what I've showed you or what this one shows you, say, "Lord, show something to me that is scriptural and is backed up by the verse of God or by the scripture of God, by the spirit of God, and shows me this is what you need to do to understand who you are." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, would you like to hear one? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear one? &gt;&gt; So, I found one in here, and I thought it was very interesting. I said, you know, I've heard this before and I've read this before in the book of First John and uh chapter 1, chapter 2, and so forth, but I want to read this here. There's something strange that that just stuck that struck my heart when I read it the first time uh over and over again. It still gets me now. This is in the first seal. All right. He begins to call now in the seals. He officially calls his bride in the seals. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, he's done said it before and he said it many times after. But in the seals is when he says, "I'm no longer going to call you church. I'm going to call you bride." &gt;&gt; Right? And even he goes back and forth saying church a couple of times. Are you with me now this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hurry now. Let me relax. All right. Okay. And he goes here. He says, "And Christ and the church, the bride, not the church. The bride and the church. &gt;&gt; Christ and the queen." Uhoh. Now he's put it somewhere else. All right. &gt;&gt; Christ and the bride stood there. Stood where? We're standing in a place of judgment. Not being judged, but judging the earth. &gt;&gt; This is one of the first times I realized that I don't have to be judged. I'm not going to be judged because I'm going through my judgment right here, right now in this lifetime. &gt;&gt; Now, for those of you who for those of us who fear the white throne judgment, you don't have to fear the white throne judgment anymore. &gt;&gt; All right? That's right. &gt;&gt; You do not stand before God as a judge. You are standing next to God as a judge. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, now, now, how do you know you're going to be a judge? Because however you give people grace today, that's how you're going to pertain yourself or that's how you're going to conduct yourself when you're on the side of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If you're a judgmental individual here, most likely you will not be a judge over there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you are a gracious and merciful person here, most likely you're going to be a judge over there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that are full of mercy, grace, and justice. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; Sometimes justice is harsh. Sometimes justice is pure. It should be always pure. I meant to say or is merciful, but it should always be pure. Whatsoever things you say, whatsoever things you do, whatsoever things you believe in, whatsoever things you are talking about, whatsoever things you're living for, let it be truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry about building other people up and reputations of others. Build up your own reputation, but not just yours, but Christ and him crucified inside of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're too busy building up other platforms for other people. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. See, now you misunderstood. You think I mean that people sitting around, you know, building my platform for Amazing Grace Temple. &gt;&gt; No, no. I mean, you're building up an Instagram platform. You're building up a a a Telegram platform. I believe in that now. I guess you're building up a a a Tik Tok platform. You're building up a following. All these influencers. And here's the thing. You got to understand something. They're influencers. They're there to influence you. That does not mean that they live the way you think they do. &gt;&gt; Their life could be just as fraudulent as yours, if not more so. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because there's a platform we call church. &gt;&gt; And we try to build an image of who we are at church. &gt;&gt; But you see, here is just like a a social media. You could be here and you're doing all hallelujah and all this and when you get home you ain't that hallelujah person at all. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; If you're going to build a following, stop following people to follow you. Follow Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; All right, you with me now? Now, brother Brown didn't say any of that in the seals, &gt;&gt; but see those little statements there prompt all that there. &gt;&gt; I'll go on here. He said, uh, he said, "If they heard the truth, truth." Okay. Okay. He says, "And if they heard the truth and rejected the truth, when, uh, then what's going to be said when the big thing is spread across the canvas." I like this. When even your own thoughts will be there. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Wow. &gt;&gt; I need God's grace, don't you? &gt;&gt; The wonder of the angel of the Lord said, "Tell the people to be careful how they think." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being up there and you don't make it and your wife goes, "I didn't know you thought that way about me." [Music] &gt;&gt; You see how careful we have to be this day and age? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I hope we do. All right, &gt;&gt; let me do this. All right. And uh says here uh uh because how are you going to escape it? And right there on the canvas of the skies and God's great television there, it's your own thoughts rebelling again. Oh my god. Your own thoughts rebelling. Your own thoughts will speak against you in that hour. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Can you be condemned by your own thoughts? &gt;&gt; I got the young people looking kind of scared all of a sudden. But you see, you already forgot. I said something a minute ago. If you're judging, if you are in Christ, you're not going to be judged. You will be judging. &gt;&gt; I just got this rebound, so it's a little tight still. &gt;&gt; I I couldn't get rid of my old book, Brother Jack. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, I had it customized. &gt;&gt; I got some ribbons put on this bad boy. Seven of them. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; But now it's all tight now. But now, I got you all afraid of the judgment. Now, see, but let me show you something. Here's what I want to get to. What do you have to be purified from when you are perfectly in Christ? &gt;&gt; Sinless. &gt;&gt; Now, the room got quiet and didn't understand what I just said. I'm saying to you that we are talking about people who are going to stand in front of Jesus Christ and the queen and whom I hope you believe that you are a part of &gt;&gt; because you are now sinless. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it now? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; All right. You're sinless now. All this where'd you get this, Caleb? I got this in the first seal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what does that got to do with the horse rider? Nothing. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to tell you. At the end of this, when everybody's waiting for the cra for the punch line, my punch line was barely onethird of the way through. I found out that I was not full of sin. That when I accepted Jesus, I became sinless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; First John began to live for a Christian, for a believer who who is in Christ, who is in Jesus, does not sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Perfectly sinless. How? He said, "How? What's the judgment for it?" But it's it's that sleeping bunch and them people that can't make it out. Are you with me now? So, he shows us here that we are perfectly sinless in Christ Jesus. I hope you got that. I hope that was good for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not done. I got a few more here. If you don't mind, I'm going to sit this over here. All right. Now, I got some more. You want some more? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Did you know And do you realize that people are looking for a book? People are looking for a lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; They're looking for a book of life. Brother Smiley, I don't mean to hit knock you or Brother Jack as you all preachers or any other preacher in the room, but I I mean to tell you if you don't know, look this look this up for yourself. There is actually, in my opinion, and if there is a literal book, a literal book, I have no no problem with that. But I do not believe it's a literal book. &gt;&gt; I'm going explain it to you here in a little bit. It says in the Bible, I will meet you in the volume of the book. Oh man, there's so many mysteries tied up right then and there. You're trying to figure this whole thing out. Like, where is this at? Then where is my name written? And how is it not removed? How is it this and how is it that? Well, didn't Paul say that you are written epistles read of all men? &gt;&gt; Then doesn't that make you a book? Doesn't that make you a chapter in the book of God? &gt;&gt; Now, how do you get your name in there, though? How do you how do you get your name? Don't you think that God knows exactly who you are? &gt;&gt; How are How are you able to be written out of the book of life, but not in the lamb's book of life, which you always are in? See, &gt;&gt; now, let me let me just kind of get here to this, brother Jack. I might be done 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; I want to hit it, &gt;&gt; but I don't like the way the devil's trying to hinder things. I can feel his spirit kind of uneasy and it ain't you and it's not me, it's him and he's getting scared cuz he has to leave and he doesn't like leaving. &gt;&gt; But it's like the brother up here said earlier, I know who I am &gt;&gt; and and and and even though you know who you are, he's not going to leave you alone. I wish he'd get a revelation and figure it out, but he's not going to. &gt;&gt; But see, I've been invited to the Lord's house to eat. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; the devil's never been invited. &gt;&gt; He's not going to be invited. He says here, "Did you know?" Brother Brown said, "Now, this is a nugget that I pulled out of the second seal." Now, this one is really exciting and it gets me every single time because it finds out it made me find out that I know who I am and I'm going to always I've turns out I've always known who I am. I want you to listen very close. &gt;&gt; Are you ready now? He said, "Did you know we had false leaders &gt;&gt; raised up false messiahs before Christ come?" Sure. Didn't they? Yes. the teacher of that day, that mighty teacher, Galia, he go he goes on the question, get up about beating these men and so forth. I'm going to read it to get you to where I got to go. Let them alone. If it's of God, why? You'll be f you'll be fined fighting against God. But if it isn't God, didn't a man raise up not long ago, take, what did he say? He said, take 400 into the wilderness and so forth. We had those things. What was it? He said, the forerunning of the real thing. That's all it is. When you see something fake, there's something real coming along. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say something kind of harsh. When you see all these false revivals around a certain kind of idea and a certain kind of thought, then you see their leader pass away. Then all of a sudden that all kind of fizzles out. It was just a a it was just a false before the real thing is about to hit. [Music] &gt;&gt; When somebody's work does not continue, it's not the person who left fault. It's the people who put their faith and their belief in the person that started the work and didn't have the uncction to carry the work on in the right manner with the right inspiration with the right Holy Ghost with the right following with the right feeling with the right sealment with the right understanding. If you don't have revelation you got no business preaching what somebody else preached. &gt;&gt; That goes for brother Brandham too. And I mean this if you don't have a revelation of what brother Brandham said you shouldn't be quoting it then. [Applause] That's where false doctrines come out of. &gt;&gt; See, they start right. Well, brother Brandham have said this and brother, oh, I got this idea right here. Yeah, but you don't even know what he meant by that. Well, you do. I prayed about it. I studied it. God showed it to me. Found out where it fits in the scripture. It has to fit from point A to point B. It can't just be your own idea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here. He said, "Satan rises raises those up." He said, "Watch." I like this word. Ro, watch. Watch. Watch the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Satan, we're here. This is the second seal now. See, it's not a horse rider, but I'm showing you a nugget that's been there the whole time. &gt;&gt; Huh? He said, "Satan, we're unfolding him right here. were stripping him down by the scriptures and letting him see who and letting you see who he is. &gt;&gt; My brother, it's this. Not only did the the seals came to do three things. One, to show us Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Two, to show us the queen. &gt;&gt; And three, to show us who the enemy is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, the seals ain't about Satan." Oh, it's very much about Satan. &gt;&gt; The seals ain't about us. Oh, it's very much about us. &gt;&gt; The seals are revealing who I am. &gt;&gt; Who you are, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb, you're stalling. Yeah, just a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to build your anticipation. Go with me right quick. Oh, I know. I'm going to stop right in the middle of that seal. Go to Go with me to Second Timothy verse 2, chapter 19. Second Timothy, verse two, and chapter 19. I like these things here I got from one of the preachers back home. Kind of threw this into my little my little mix right here. Oh, brother Jack, we're going to start at verse 16. We're going to start at verse 16. All right. So, it's chapter 2, verse 16. And read, let's read this. Look here. It says, "But shun profane and vain babblings." In other words, what I just said, somebody don't know what they're talking about. &gt;&gt; It sounds good, but it's not good. &gt;&gt; Everybody else is standing and you're looking around going, "Why are they doing that?" We went to a service one time and uh we're watching. Never mind. We We were at a service. You got what I'm doing, what I said. And we're sitting there, and Sister Ann sitting there next to me, and uh she come from a church uh Jeffersonville that was a a woman pastor. Nice lady. Nice lady. She got on to be with the Lord. now. But she would say a bunch of stuff. I was like, "What is she talking about?" And she she knew, but then later on when she read the supernaturals and found out who Brother Brandon was, now that she goes back, you're probably just confused as I was. All of a sudden, you're like, "What are you what are they talking about?" Right? What do they mean? What's a love chariot? What is, you know, what is the Song of Solomon? I don't get what y'all are talking about. It's crazy stuff. So, we go to this other church. She's a message believer now. And we're sitting there and uh this brother's saying this and he's saying that and he's saying this and everybody's standing, everybody's clapping. And all of a sudden he says, "Why?" Because the white horse rider and boom boom boom boom. He went all the way down the line and everybody's clapping, "Amen. Amen." And when it got quiet and they sat down, she didn't time it perfectly enough. She goes, "What did he just say?" And I was like, "I'll try to explain it to you later." Of course, everybody clapped and kind of looked at her like, "Oh, huddy." You know, but it was vain babble. He's like, "What do you just sput out a bunch of stuff, brother? We don't even know what you're talking about." Exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; You We need to have the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; come back in the room &gt;&gt; and tell us the truth of the matter. &gt;&gt; All right. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It says, "So, but but son profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto ungodliness." &gt;&gt; Okay. 17. And their word and and their word will eat us do uh uh eat as canker as a canker. In other words, it'll just take the very life from you, &gt;&gt; right? Of whom is &gt;&gt; well, he named two brothers, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Heranius and Philippus. You can't even say their names, so don't try to quote them if you can't even say their names. All right. &gt;&gt; Verse 18. who concerning the truth have errors, saying that the resurrection is passed already. [Music] &gt;&gt; Does this sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Huh? Has passed already and overthrow and and overthrow the faith of uh uh of some. In other words, it's passed. And he was right. It did pass. There was a resurrection, but there's going to be another resurrection and then another resurrection. Are you with me now? So there was a coming and there's going to be a coming and there'll be another coming. Are you with me now? So there was a bride and she was put away and there was a bride and she but this Eve shall never fail. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You get how it happens? There's always God always does things in threes. If you miss the first one, don't worry. There's another one coming. If you miss that one, that's the one you need to worry about because if you're on this one, you'll be here for that one. Just hang on. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Look here. And then in 19 it says this. Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure. Having this seal. &gt;&gt; You didn't catch it. Having this seal, &gt;&gt; right? The Lord knoweth them that are his. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to get a kick out of this. I'm going to just keep on going. Don't knowing them that are his. All right. All right. All right. I'm too excited. Calm down. And let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. &gt;&gt; Now, I like this. Our brother, one of our brothers back home taught us this. I'm I'm going to borrow it from him. And whether he likes it or not, I'm going to tell him there's nothing new under the sun, brother. So, be quiet. But in good but in a great house there are not only uh vessels of go of of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some of honor and some of dishonor. It's going to happen in every work. &gt;&gt; If a man therefore puh purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and meat for the master's use. and prepared unto every good work. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All right. God knows who are his. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Watch the shrew. Going back to this here. Watch the shrewdness of this fellow. &gt;&gt; We're we are we're talking about here Satan. We're unfold where we're unfolding him right here. just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is. That's what that is what's supposed to be done. Oh my. And you remember he has not tried to go in as a communist. Satan hasn't. He is an antichrist. &gt;&gt; So close that he would deceive the very elected. Then he stops right there. You guys got this on the board. &gt;&gt; Oh, go on. Oh, good for you. Okay, then he stops right there. He said the elected and we all know what the rest of it would deceive the very elected if it were &gt;&gt; possible. &gt;&gt; So that means that it is not &gt;&gt; but if it were &gt;&gt; possible &gt;&gt; but it's not &gt;&gt; possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says this, "And that's the ones big O." The ones who &gt;&gt; the ones who &gt;&gt; Okay. The ones that has hid down in those seals. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Uhhuh. Uhuh. You didn't get it. Those are the ones whose hid down in those seals, whose names are on the book since the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Are you sure you got this? &gt;&gt; Where was it written? &gt;&gt; Show me Revelation chapter 6 and show me where your name's at. &gt;&gt; Show me chapter 7. Where's your name? Show me chapter 8. Where's your name at? Your name's not in there. &gt;&gt; Your name's not in there. But according to brother Bowen, I found this nugget in the seals here. He said, "Your name was written in the second seal before the foundation of the world, and it was hid there." Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham didn't say it like this, but I'm going to tell you, it's not G. It's not a seal like a scroll up. When when Jesus revealed the seals to the brother of Brandham, when the angels of God came down and said, "This one and this one and this one." Do you understand that it was Jesus Christ pulling one tab off and another tab off and another tab off? It was Jesus revealing Jesus in seven parts to the prophet of this age. &gt;&gt; When your name was written on the last book of life, your name was written on his heart. Your name has been written there and and hidden since before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; I'm a little confused at why everybody else is not as happy as I was when I read that. &gt;&gt; Your name has what? What's your name, lady? &gt;&gt; Oh, we got two Abigails. How many? Let me see. All the Abigails stand up. All the Abigail stand up. Okay, that's a Don and that's a &gt;&gt; a what? Say like you're proud girl. &gt;&gt; All right. You got this one and that one. And both these Abigails whose names were hidden since before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We got a Jack Duff right here. And his name was written in the seals before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We got a Jeff Smith over here. And there's a lot of Smiths. Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; There's some white ones, some black ones, and I'm pretty sure there's an Asian Smith someplace. There's got to be there's got to be an Asian Puerto Rican Smith someplace, right? But Jeff Smith's name was written on the seals and hidden there before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Caleb, when did it get revealed? When when Jesus Christ broke open them seals, when polar bear broke over the seals, your name was released and it still did not find its mark to the day you went goooo gaga wah wah. When your name was Caleb Don then God said that's one of my that's one of my that's one of my &gt;&gt; Come on. Glory. And it's been there &gt;&gt; hidden &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; in those seals. &gt;&gt; And if you Oh, I love the mystery of it. Go ahead and read all the Revelation 6,7 and 8. You won't see your name anywhere, &gt;&gt; but it was there. &gt;&gt; It was there &gt;&gt; the whole time. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because you were with him the whole time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; He knows who are sealed. &gt;&gt; He knows whose are his. &gt;&gt; So why are you sitting here all tossed about? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; When I told you that I know who I am, I know who I am because I saw that in the second seal. &gt;&gt; The second seal opened up to me and it told me who I was. &gt;&gt; Well, in the second seal, well, it's all through the seals, brother. I don't know what part of it you got released, but I'm pretty sure I came out when the seventh seal was opened up. Here I here come my part. I don't know when it was, but your names were written there anyhow. &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote here. &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm already done. I'm not even playing with you. I didn't come to I didn't come here to put up a Caleb show. I came here to give you God's word and walk off. &gt;&gt; Your name is in those seals. When brother who would have thought, let me get you this. Let me ask you this one. When you were sitting there and you heard how many when you heard the seals for the first time, do you ever actually hear your name come out? &gt;&gt; No. Did you realize it though? You don't have to give me a show of hands, but I almost can promise you how many of you have never really read that before. &gt;&gt; You've read over it. You've read through it, but you never stopped and said, "You know what? Do you want to know what never was revealed to me, Brother Jack? When I was sitting there preaching, my my folks will tell you I was preaching. I say, "Hold on. Give me a second. Wait, give me one minute." And I was reading again. I go, "I just want to make sure I read this the right way." &gt;&gt; And then I read it and we just had an we just had a field day with it. &gt;&gt; Because we had ne I had never seen that before. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, in a different message, Christ the mystery of God revealed, he says here, he says here, he says, "Now you see those seals when he's in his meditational work back there redeeming, but someday he comes forth to get this book." What book? His bride book. &gt;&gt; It's not a book like this is a book or that's a book. It's we are the book. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He comes back to get this book that he's redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard uh Brother Randy, Brother Randy, Brother Randy said the other day, he said, "Now, I'm going to say something kind of plain, and I hope you're not offended." He said, "But there's Adam in the Garden of Eden and his wife." He said, "They're walking this before they fell." This before they fell now. And he said, "Here they are." The Bible said they were not clothed. They were naked. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, was Adam walking around naked with a book under his arm? &gt;&gt; I know it sounds crude, but it's a question. Right? &gt;&gt; Because the Bible, brother Brown said that Adam had that book. &gt;&gt; So where'd he keep that book at? &gt;&gt; It wasn't a book. He was the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; He lost the title deed &gt;&gt; because he had to. And then that was forfeited and Jesus became the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? It went back to the father till Jesus was born. And when Jesus was born, he took back the title deed and the book of redemption. And before he could claim it, he had to go back to where he's at now. Do the meditational uh uh medial &gt;&gt; thank you work that he has to do. And then when the rap the body change happens, the resurrection and the rapture forth that he comes back to take back the book that he had redeemed already. &gt;&gt; It's not coming back for a book under his arm, brothers. He's coming back for you and for me. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Come back for the book he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. So he's coming back for himself. Yes, he's coming back for himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, it gets better. [Music] So you mean to So brother Caleb, you're telling me that when my name was released, when my man my name was hidden in the seals? Let me let me get this straight. My name was hidden in the seals. Yes. And Jesus name was Jesus was in the seals. Yes. Jesus is the seals. Yes. And my name was there. Yes. Then that makes me the seals. Yes. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me that the bride and Jesus are the seven seals? Yes. [Applause] and he's coming back for that book. That's every part of himself. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hey, so you see how now I say I know that I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; This is not a walk by faith, brother Jack. This is a walk that I know that I know that I know I'm going to make it. I am that book of redemption. I've been redeemed because I'm in there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't stop the fire now. &gt;&gt; You can't stop it now. &gt;&gt; I am the book &gt;&gt; because he is the book. &gt;&gt; If he's coming back for himself, he's coming back for me. And that means that Jesus cannot leave without me, &gt;&gt; without you, without amazing grace temple, without spirit of truth. He cannot leave without any part that belongs to himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm done. &gt;&gt; Let me finish this here. All and all that's in the book would be him. For that's the believer. The words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that. He come forth for the book of redemption whose names are written on that book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you mean he had said this before? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, he said it right after. He said in the seals, he says, "In Christ, the mystery of God revealed." He continues to hold to that revelation &gt;&gt; that those names were already there in the seals. &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, how have we all missed this all this time? Right? &gt;&gt; That don't make you any less of a preacher or a pastor &gt;&gt; or me. It don't make me any greater of a pastor or a leader. What it means that it's been hidden &gt;&gt; and kept a mystery until this time &gt;&gt; when his words come back to me and say, "I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." &gt;&gt; And the bride is going to give forth another life. &gt;&gt; What life is that? It's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble. &gt;&gt; It's the life behind the name that causes proud hearts to humble. It was Christ who devised the plan that in all ways as a man that he would live so he could give give us the life behind the name. &gt;&gt; Now, I know they said there was a bunch of there was a lot of people named Jesus before Jesus was born. I don't find any history of that. There may been, there may not have been, but I know since then there's been plenty of Jesus walking around, &gt;&gt; right? And some basketball players that got the nerve to be called Jesus, &gt;&gt; named Jesus, call himself King of Kings. They need then then they wonder why they got a knee injury or a tendon tear and they can't play no more. &gt;&gt; You know, God will share his glory with nobody. &gt;&gt; You can't give nobody credit for getting you to Jesus. Someone say, "Well, I I I I'll always be supportive for brother Caleb Don because he got me to the Lord." No. The spirit of God got you to the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The man didn't do nothing. I'm just a vessel. I'm just a tool. But I didn't lead you to Christ. Christ led you to Christ. &gt;&gt; You watch any famous speaker. You watching, they're trying to try to try to build their kingdom around themselves and what they've done. You watch how quickly they fall. &gt;&gt; Look at all these guys. Cleo, what's his name? Cle what's it? What's his name? &gt;&gt; Cre low dollar. Like so like like cleave to a dollar. That's what it sounds like. Why anybody would trust a preacher named Dollar. I have no idea. I wouldn't trust him if he was a real estate agent, let alone a preacher. Who's your real estate guy? Dollar. Oh no. No. No. Find me somebody that says cent or something. You know, he going to charge me cents on the dollar, not dollar on the dollar. Come on. Why you want to Why Why you want to go Joel Ostein? He retired. How you going to retire at 45? What's the matter with you? &gt;&gt; Cuz they got money. &gt;&gt; They're They're not That's not That's not a That's not a Well, you know, Brother Jack, it's kind of hard to say this being preachers cuz we don't have a whole lot of it. But having money doesn't make you successful. &gt;&gt; I've had brothers say they're going to win the lottery for me. &gt;&gt; I said, "Okay, well, that's all right. If you get all your bills paid, Brother Green told me that wasn't gambling." He said, "That's just exchanging one worthless piece of paper for another worthless piece of paper. He said, "If you can afford to waste one piece of paper on another piece of paper, you go right ahead." But here's the problem I had. I said, "If we win, I mean, if you all win and you give it to me and word gets out, well then I'm rich because somebody played the lottery." &gt;&gt; I built my church because someone gave me money from a lottery. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Where's the glory in that? &gt;&gt; So I tell the brothers, don't play too big, fellas. Don't come at me with billions. Come at me with a few thousand. It'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Keep it humble. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying the success you cannot point to any man. &gt;&gt; God will share his glory with nobody. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not going to Jesus will not be outshined by anybody. &gt;&gt; Even his queen will not outshine Jesus. But the light that the queen has belongs to Jesus Christ anyhow. It's the life behind the name. &gt;&gt; He said, "And here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there. She can't recognize another headship." That's what he said. &gt;&gt; You wonder why these big men and dignitaries, why their movements don't last or why their ministries kind of fizzle out because they're sharing their headship or excuse me, because she is claiming them as their head as as her head. And you can't have that. &gt;&gt; God won't let you have another head. You have one head, and that's Christ. There's no bishop. There's no nothing. She recognizes one headship. That's Christ. And Christ is the word. He said, "I love that." Yes, sir. Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; Now listen. He said, "Fallen angels." What kind of angels? &gt;&gt; He said, "Let uh Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the angels did." I think this is strange. He calls them angels. I think it's strange to me how he does it. He said, "What have they done?" He said, "Lucifer, the main the main hold of Na. And what have they done? Organized a great economical council associated ministers behind them." Now, he didn't call them false angels. as he goes on, an image like unto the beast and a building a c a Christian economy that'll close the doors of this church and others like it. In other words, this that the ministries were fine but the organiz organizations around it became as a fallen angel just like Lucifer. &gt;&gt; What happened? They sold out their headship. Wow. &gt;&gt; He says here, what do they do in paragraph 552? Sold out to reasonings and wisdoms and education &gt;&gt; like Eve did. Fallen angels did that. &gt;&gt; Wesley was a man of God. But what followed him? Fallen angels got into it. What was the angels first? Creative beings of God, but fell for Lucifer's wisdom. &gt;&gt; Right. Right? &gt;&gt; You got these people standing up and and I don't have a problem with it, but they're trying to get people to Christ. But you're not going to get people to Christ because of your wisdom &gt;&gt; because you can outsmart somebody, because you're educated or anything like this. You're going to do it by a life. You We can talk. We need to be witnesses. How many needs to be a witness? &gt;&gt; We need to introduce people to Jesus. Is that right? But don't outdo them with your words. Don't try to win them over with your with your wisdom and with your knowledge. You win them over by your kindness and the love that is in your heart that God has put there. &gt;&gt; I think I'm I'm gonna stop there. That's enough. We don't want to be a fallen angel. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to follow after these footsteps. Brother Jack, the reason why you and I pick up the way we do when we do is because we got the same spirit ticking inside of us. &gt;&gt; Did I ever tell you, I don't know, brother Jack ever told you the story how we met? When we met, we had never seen each other. Ain't that right? And we had met uh through brother Trevor via email. I think it was like a blog or something like this, some kind of chat that we had. Uh yeah, you remember that message? Two message ministers, Nathan and Trevor. &gt;&gt; And uh somehow I was saying something saying something and all of a sudden this name pops up, Jack Dove. And I didn't have internet and I mean uh websites and all that stuff. So I didn't look him up or nothing. I just saw his name and God bless you, brother Caleb. I don't know you, but duh. And did you ever see what brother Brad said this? Like who was this guy? Oh yeah. Oh, that's good. Okay. Yeah. Hey. Well, did you see what he said? We established a little relationship. And then one day he comes out. Was he with brother Smiley? Okay. One day he comes out to uh Brother Musa's church, I think, via Brother Israel's invitation. And I walked in the doors and looked at Brother Jack and he looked at me. I go, "Brother Jack," he goes, "Brother Caleb, &gt;&gt; we had never seen each other before." &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Well, you never seen each other before? No, not ever. But somewhere before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; when the sons of God danced before the stars in heaven, &gt;&gt; or was it the stars dance before the sons of God? Whoever it was before he formed you, I knew you. &gt;&gt; How can you doubt that your names were on the lamb's book of life? &gt;&gt; How can you doubt that your names were hidden in the seals when he says, "Before I formed you, I knew you." All right. &gt;&gt; Thus say the Lord God to Israel, I called you by name. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He has known you before you knew you. &gt;&gt; What about that song we sing? He knew me. &gt;&gt; And yet he loves me. &gt;&gt; He whose name alone outshine the sun. Huh? God did that for you and I. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was going to go on saying I was unworthy, but I'm not unworthy because he who the son of man is made worthy is worthy indeed. &gt;&gt; He who the son of man is made free is free indeed. He who the son of man is made clean is clean indeed. He who the son of man is saved is saved indeed. He who the son of man is purified, sanctified, justified is sanctified, justified, and purified indeed. He who the son of man is found to be the truth is truth and the witness of all truth. And the only truth there is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Never forget your name were written there and hidden before the foundation of the world. God bless you, brother Jack. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. Hallelujah. Come on. Somebody give God praise. And I mean give him praise. I was known. I was there. My name is hidden. I'm in the seals. My name when the seals were broke, my name was Jet Luke. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a favor though. Could I have him sing that song one more time? Come on up here, brother. I know who I am. Take a look at me. Take a look at me. Take a look. How'd you do it? Huh? I said, "You I was trying to get Take a look at me. Take a look." I was like, "Take a look at me. Take a look at me." I know. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; That's all I got. That's what I got. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. That's perfect, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Come on, put your hands on. [Music] We are a chosen generation [Music] to show his excellence. All I require for life God has given me. I know who I am. Sing it like me. We are a chosen generation called to show his excellence. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We are a chosen generation show. Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] I know everybody. [Applause] I know. [Music] Heat up here. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. [Music] My God. [Music] Brother, we uh we appreciate that, brother Caleb. Um, &gt;&gt; you know, it's I I think everyone should feel challenged to go back and just start listening to the seals. I love the the thought that he uh brought because when you when you listen to the seals and for years we've listened um brother Brandham takes a really really good amount of time before he actually begins to reveal the seal &gt;&gt; and and then the the next night he'll come and he'll do a a recap, &gt;&gt; right? And in the recap, the revelation of what the seal was was only about five minutes long, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. Really about 5 minutes. So the the the revelation of what the what the seal was, what it meant was only about 5 minutes. But what else was he trying to tell us? &gt;&gt; If it only took 5 minutes to tell you what the seal was, what what else was he trying to tell us? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh I I think you it causes you to listen to it just a little differently uh when you go back and and and and hear it and and and I'll I'll put a plug here. Um if you can't get the seal books from um Voice of God, then I know also brother George Smith, &gt;&gt; he produces a sealed book and he he does in a little different format. What brother George likes to do is when when a scripture is called out, he actually highlights the scripture a little bit better in in the book so you can see exactly where brother Random's getting this from. He didn't make this up. He went right back to the scripture and brought these things forward to us, right? But uh but just what a what a what a blessing. &gt;&gt; You you mean to tell me you were revealed in the seal? And and and another quote that came to mind is um brother Random said, you know, when when he says our names was in the book and brother Gibson, not a physical book, not like this. &gt;&gt; And and here's the thing. When when when you see your name &gt;&gt; there &gt;&gt; in the book, &gt;&gt; it actually creates a different response from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and and if you if you go looking for a physical book like this, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; But brother Random say your name was in the book. He says, "And when when you see your name, you hear your name called out of that book," he says it's not like you would see Jack Duff &gt;&gt; or Caleb Duron or or Man Neville, right? He said it wouldn't be like that. He says, "But as the revelation is being revealed to you, then you being identified with the revelation causes you to be able to see your name." &gt;&gt; So when he was unfolding the seals, we were seeing our name revealed in that book, the Lamb's Book of Life. I tell you the truth. I'm so happy that God has allowed me to be identified with this message. This is this is like heaven to me. This is like heaven to me. I was just I was just absolutely blessed. And brother Caleb had been telling me about this sermon uh as we've been in fellowship. But it it's something about when you actually hear it preached uh underneath the anointing. It's just a real a real blessing. We appreciate the Lord. Amen. And all that he's done here today. Um so you you you you went under time. You could have kept preaching, but I know you got another one tonight. So that that's perfectly fine. I'm going to ask uh brother Jesse just to come and close us in a word of prayer. we were fellowshipping on yesterday and and he made a a statement to me um that just just blessed me because um um we've been talking about a few things you know and the the second coming and the third coming of the Lord that was a part of our ministers meeting and um and he brought out a scripture said you know Malachi 4 says that um he would send Elijah to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and uh Um you know that coming of Malachi was actually for the second coming of the Lord. So brother Brandham's ministry is completely connected to the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He did reveal what the third coming would be but he his ministry in itself was connected to the second coming of the Lord. As John the Baptist for my first coming, your message will for my second coming. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I was just blessed when he was sharing that. So I want brother Jesse to just come and Amen. and he can greet you and then also just say a word of prayer. Amen. For you as we prepare to dismiss. God bless you, brother Jesse. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, he he wouldn't want me to say this. Uh but this is uh brother Perry Green's grandson. [Applause] [Music] God bless you, brother Jack. I appreciate the opportunity. Um, can we just get John 15:15 up real quick, please, brother? I promise I won't take long. Um, I appreciate all you. I'm glad to see brother Jack. It's really encouraging when you have We traveled here about four years ago. Um, our oldest was still a baby and you guys greeted me and I got up here and I was so excited from all the preach from all the praise and worship that I think I talked faster here than I do back home. And back in Arizona, we talk pretty fast. &gt;&gt; So, I promise I won't take that much time. I promise. &gt;&gt; But I've been in prayer ever since I've been here and I was talking to my wife last night and I just want to share this with you for just a moment because it goes right along with what brother Caleb said on Friday night. It says, "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I have called you friends, &gt;&gt; for all things I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you." &gt;&gt; He called them friends, &gt;&gt; if he's calling you bride, &gt;&gt; how much more is he going to reveal to you? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I wanted to share that with you that if you're called the bride of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; has anyone ever liked anyone before? Ever had a crush on anyone before? &gt;&gt; All right. Yes. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of married couples. I hope you get your hands up cuz not we're going have to have marriage counseling here. I I'm not I'm not here to do marriage counseling. &gt;&gt; But if you've ever liked someone before, you investigate. You find out where they what they like, what who they like, what clothes they like, what the attitude. You want to know everything about them, right? &gt;&gt; You want to know who they are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus already knows who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if it just takes this last trip as we try to back east now to come visit you? What if it takes that last trip for someone to get up and say, "Jesus is just waiting for you to find out who he is." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we can all get out of here. &gt;&gt; What if it's just that last we're getting our garments on. We're preparing for Jesus come. What if he's like, "I just need you to know just a little bit more about me &gt;&gt; so that when we get back to dinner, &gt;&gt; the dinner of dinners, &gt;&gt; the feast, &gt;&gt; he's going to have that plate set for you because he knows who you are." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give you that little bit of nugget saying, &gt;&gt; "God bless you. We love you. Glory." &gt;&gt; And I really hope when you come visit us, it is in January. &gt;&gt; Don't come there in July and August. Don't don't come there. All right. As you can tell, I experienced your son. You don't want to experience that desert heat over there. &gt;&gt; But we love you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Sincerely, it's encouraging to come back and see the churches growing and to see those that I saw last time, you're still pressing on. &gt;&gt; That encourages a young Christian like me. Amen. Go ahead. Amen. To have a song special saying to us, God bless you, sisters. That was a blessing. I think I shook your hand. I did not shake your hand, but it was a blessing to see the youth get up here, not even know, not even know, not even need to know the words on a phone, but just be able to sing it from your heart. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's encouraging &gt;&gt; to see that you're still pressing on. &gt;&gt; You're still believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it be, Lord. Let it be. &gt;&gt; When you recognize his presence, you'll just take a minute. I know he's here right now. So, let me just stop talking and let's just talk to the Lord for a moment. So, heavenly father, thank you for this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord with those of light, precious faith, Lord, an encouragement to speak to them, Lord, tonight and to hear their words again, &gt;&gt; Lord, to see those that are still pressing on to find out who you are. &gt;&gt; You tell us who we are, &gt;&gt; but Lord, I want to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Father, when you come and get us back and oh, it could be very soon. It could be today. It could be right now. It could be tonight. Lord, I pray that we take that time. We take this seriously to find out, Father, just how much more you have planned for us. And Lord, only the eyes have not seen, ears have heard, but has been revealed to those through your spirit. Lord, I know the brothers and sisters here. And though we haven't met in person, Lord, the same spirit as in me is in the brothers and sisters here, my brothers and sisters of precious faith. So, Father, as you as we thank you for this wonderful service and all the song specials, Lord, and the words that were spoken, I pray, Lord, that you be with us again tonight, Lord, you give us a double portion of your Holy Spirit, Lord. And though we depart out of this building, Lord, don't let us ever, ever depart from your presence, Lord. Let it be so familiar that know if we get up in the morning, Lord, and we don't feel your presence, Lord, don't let our feet touch the ground. Don't let us roll out of bed, Lord. Don't let us continue our our our human business, Lord, until we have the spiritual in our hearts, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, Lord, let's wake up in the morning saying, "Father, what can I do for you this day? For, Father, you deserve all the honor and all the glory. For Father, without you, I am nothing &gt;&gt; and because of you, Father, I am still standing and breathing &gt;&gt; and I know who I am." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm adopted son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm standing amongst the fellow believers, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, thank you, Father, for this opportunity. Please bless this congregation, Lord. Let them find a home, Lord, that they can praise and worship you. Stomp their feet, clap their hands. Lord, &gt;&gt; I spoke it last night with a with a pastor here, Lord, by your inspiration. Lord, I know they'll be moving soon to a new location. &gt;&gt; So granted, Father, as you've already made it known, I pray you'd be with us again this night and this day through your son's name, Jesus Christ. We give you all our glory. Just want to say, "Father, I love you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can be seated. Amen. Um just wanted to say brother Samuel so good to have you with us. Uh brother Steven had sent me the um asked me for the address and and I didn't let him know that uh a little bit of Arizona would be here today with you. Amen. and so happy that it all worked out for you to to come. Amen. On today, the Lord bless you. Also, uh just real quick, brother, um Jesse had just ran an idea by me and I want to just throw this out to you all. He say, "Brother, look for some abandoned buildings." He says, "Look for some abandoned buildings. you might see grass growing all up all around the place and and just look to see cuz then start investigating and see if you can get that building at a really good discount and then you know that's just something that he shared. &gt;&gt; I can't see all abandoned buildings by myself. So I'm throwing that out to the church. Look for some abandoned buildings. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
