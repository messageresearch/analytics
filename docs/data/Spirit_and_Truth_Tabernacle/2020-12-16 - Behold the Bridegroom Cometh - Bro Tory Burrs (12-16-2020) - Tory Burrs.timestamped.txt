[6:43] in jesus name we pray
[6:46] amen amen
[6:50] amen i would like to come before you uh
[6:52] we're going to read a scripture but
[6:54] start from genesis
[6:57] uh i'll do the best i can hear it
[7:03] you know i'm really not
[7:07] good
[7:11] at arguments
[7:14] time i'm not a good debater
[7:19] my thoughts get all over the place i
[7:22] just
[7:23] i quit sometimes my wife and i are going
[7:27] through some things yeah sometime we
[7:28] we argue we go back and forth and she's
[7:31] very good at staying on point
[7:34] and i'm all over the place and i just
[7:37] get whooped
[7:40] because i can't keep a free thought for
[7:42] nothing let my emotions get all
[7:45] involved walking around the house out
[7:48] the door
[7:49] and she just standing there why can't we
[7:52] just talk
[7:55] i thought that what i was doing
[7:57] [Laughter]
[7:59] why can't you just see it my way
[8:03] but you know what love prevails
[8:06] amen so uh
[8:10] we'll read this this this scripture here
[8:12] and i'll try to keep my thoughts
[8:15] besides i'll do the best i can amen
[8:18] maybe that's just the way the lord made
[8:20] me i just
[8:21] i'm just not good at it sometimes now
[8:24] but may love prevail
[8:26] amen so we're taking this from genesis
[8:30] 24
[8:33] amen will be begin i was going to start
[8:35] from the 12th
[8:39] verse but i i feel maybe i should
[8:43] start it from the seventh amen and it
[8:46] says
[8:48] the lord god of heaven which took me
[8:50] from my father's house
[8:54] from the land of my kindred and which
[8:56] spake unto me
[8:58] and that swear unto me saying unto thy
[9:00] seed i will give
[9:02] this land he shall send his angel before
[9:06] thee
[9:07] and shall take a wife unto thy
[9:12] unto my son from this
[9:16] and if the woman will not be willing to
[9:19] follow thee
[9:21] then thou shalt be clear
[9:24] from this my oath only bring not my son
[9:27] vither again and the servant put his
[9:32] hand
[9:32] under the thigh of abraham his master
[9:36] and under abraham his master and swear
[9:40] to him
[9:40] concerning that matter and the servant
[9:44] took
[9:45] ten camels of the camels
[9:48] of the master and departed
[9:52] for all the goods of his master were in
[9:55] his hand and he arose and went
[10:00] to mesopotamia unto the city
[10:04] of nehar and he made
[10:08] his camels to kneel down
[10:11] uh without the city by the whale
[10:14] of water at the time of the evening
[10:18] now i want you to notice there that they
[10:21] are at the well of water in the evening
[10:24] time that's very significant
[10:27] even the time that the woman go
[10:31] out to draw water
[10:34] in the evening time
[10:38] and he said oh lord god of my master
[10:42] abraham
[10:44] i pray thee send me good speed
[10:48] this day and show kindness
[10:51] unto my master abraham behold i
[10:54] stand here by the well of water
[10:58] and the daughters of the men of the city
[11:01] come
[11:01] out to draw water and let it come to
[11:04] pass that the damsel
[11:07] to whom i shall say let down thy picture
[11:10] i pray thee that me that i may drink
[11:15] and she shall say drink and
[11:18] i will give thy camel's drink also
[11:23] let the same be that she
[11:27] thou has appointed
[11:30] for thy servant isaac
[11:34] now i want you to notice that's very
[11:35] significant to say let the same be
[11:38] she that thou has appointed
[11:43] for thy servant isaac and thereby
[11:46] shall i know that thou
[11:49] has showed kindness to my master
[11:53] amen if you can turn in your bibles you
[11:55] may be seated
[11:56] we'll turn in our bibles there to
[11:58] revelation
[12:00] the 21st
[12:03] chapter and we'll read
[12:10] from the ninth verse
[12:15] revelation 21
[12:19] and the ninth verse and there came
[12:23] unto me one of the seven angels
[12:27] which had the seven vows full of
[12:30] the seven last plagues and talked
[12:34] with me saying come hither i will
[12:38] show thee the bride
[12:42] the lamb's wife
[12:45] amen if you will
[12:48] again turn in your bibles with me we're
[12:51] going to go to

[13:01] chapter
[13:04] we'll begin reading at the sixth verse
[13:08] and go down
[13:11] say to the tenth verse
[13:17] and at midnight there was a cry made
[13:21] behold the bridegroom cometh
[13:28] amen behold the bridegroom cometh
[13:32] go ye out to meet him
[13:36] amen then all those virgins arose
[13:41] and trimmed their lamps
[13:46] and the foolish said
[13:49] unto the wise give us your oar
[13:52] for our lamps are gone out
[13:56] but the wise answer saying
[13:59] not so lest there be not
[14:03] enough for us and you
[14:08] but go ye rather than to them that buy
[14:12] for yourselves and while they
[14:16] went to buy the bridegroom came
[14:20] and they that were ready
[14:23] went in with him
[14:27] to the marriage and the door
[14:31] was shut the lord had a blessing to the
[14:35] reading
[14:36] i want us to focus here just briefly
[14:39] on the sixth verse for my title this
[14:44] evening behold the bridegroom
[14:48] coming
[14:51] and we we we're we're in a time
[14:57] now uh there's a wise man
[15:00] once told me he said to me
[15:05] he say you know when you're ministering
[15:09] and you're
[15:10] coming up with a title he told me he
[15:13] said
[15:15] tell him what you're gonna tell him
[15:19] then he say tell him then he say
[15:23] tell him what you told him so
[15:26] i'm telling you all right behold
[15:30] the bridegroom cometh right
[15:33] amen we we we
[15:37] we are living in a time
[15:41] that that that a critical time
[15:47] and and the crab went out behold the
[15:50] bridegroom cometh
[15:54] last week i attempted
[15:59] to bring a few things out one of the
[16:02] things that i
[16:03] that that i was discussing that i
[16:05] brought out was
[16:08] we we are living in a
[16:12] and under under an an eagle
[16:15] anointing
[16:18] they talk about through the seven church
[16:21] ages no i don't for the sake of time i
[16:24] promise you i won't hold you as long as
[16:26] i did last week
[16:28] i promise you i won't do that
[16:31] i was trying to get through some things
[16:33] and i still ain't getting that
[16:35] and it may seem a little discombo but
[16:37] hopefully tonight i'll bring it all
[16:39] and and and tie it all together in one
[16:41] nice little package here
[16:44] so uh uh uh uh uh uh we lit that was
[16:47] through four no four anointings
[16:50] to to get the the for through these
[16:53] seven
[16:53] church ages to to
[16:56] give the people strength
[17:00] courage to deal with
[17:03] what they were going to have to deal
[17:05] with at that
[17:06] particular time frame of
[17:10] the the the the building of
[17:13] the body right or the gathering
[17:16] oh my god of the people right to form
[17:21] uh uh his bride uh
[17:24] different different different ones uh
[17:27] had to go through different things
[17:28] but we at this end time i want you to
[17:32] notice we go back there
[17:34] uh to genesis the 24th is
[17:37] eliezer was going out to find
[17:41] a a bride uh or he was commissioned
[17:46] by abraham to find a
[17:50] wife for isaac
[17:53] he was commissioned to go out of and
[17:56] what
[17:56] what a what a responsibility what
[18:00] a task no wonder he prayed lord
[18:05] you do this pray say lord
[18:11] you uh choose this this damsel
[18:15] amen this this young lady amen this
[18:18] this virgin amen uh
[18:22] to to i can present amen
[18:25] to abraham for isaac
[18:29] to be wed amen
[18:34] so we see we're living
[18:40] eloheesa was up under that eagle
[18:43] anointed
[18:45] he his job was to go out and
[18:49] and find a wife
[18:53] for the son of abraham
[18:57] and under that eagle anointing let me
[19:00] tell you something my brothers and
[19:01] sisters
[19:03] we're not looking
[19:07] for church members right we're not
[19:10] looking
[19:11] for uh large
[19:15] congregations we're not looking for
[19:19] to be recorded now we don't we don't
[19:21] need
[19:22] a large audience or television man we
[19:25] don't need all of the pop
[19:27] and circumstance we
[19:30] are living under an eagle anointing
[19:35] to carve out a bride
[19:39] for the son of god amen
[19:44] so i will our our messages
[19:48] may come uh uh uh
[19:51] uh uh our approach may be different
[19:54] right
[19:55] our our our our
[19:58] requirements space may seem a little bit
[20:01] stringent
[20:02] right but
[20:05] do you realize the gravity of the
[20:09] responsibility that
[20:10] has been put in our hands we're not
[20:14] just coming here we're not
[20:17] just seeking anybody
[20:21] we're not just just saying oh come
[20:24] anyone who wants to come no we are
[20:27] looking for a specific
[20:30] type of people right
[20:35] and these people if we go back here to
[20:39] genesis 24.
[20:53] it says there in genesis 24
[20:57] to 14 it says
[21:00] let the same be she
[21:04] that thou has appointed
[21:08] for thy servant right so we're not doing
[21:12] the choosing now
[21:15] just like eliza at least god has already
[21:18] done the appointing
[21:20] right amen
[21:26] we're just saying behold the bridegroom
[21:29] coming
[21:34] it's time it's time
[21:38] rebecca to make yourself ready
[21:43] it's time to put away
[21:47] those things that that that that azure
[21:50] look
[21:52] growing up i find
[21:57] that one of the most difficult
[21:59] transitions
[22:01] is going from an adolescent
[22:05] young adult over into adulthood
[22:09] some people never cross over that's
[22:10] right that's right
[22:12] okay just being honest some people don't
[22:14] ever get there
[22:16] but that is a critical juncture
[22:20] when you're crossing over from that
[22:23] point of being
[22:24] under your uh under your your parents
[22:28] leadership and tutelage hand holding and
[22:33] taking care of crossing over until
[22:36] full responsibility right
[22:42] it is a time when the devil pounces
[22:46] because he know uh uh you
[22:50] you haven't quite been through a lot of
[22:53] battles you don't you you really
[22:54] you you you're a young pup
[22:59] stepping out for the first time
[23:02] so a lot of times the devil fights you
[23:05] and
[23:06] with all sorts of thoughts
[23:09] well i'm finally old enough to do
[23:13] whatever it is
[23:16] comes to my mind to do
[23:20] usually those those years of college
[23:25] right i'm out of my parents house i
[23:28] don't have the curfew anymore i don't
[23:30] have the rules anymore
[23:33] but you have to be able to have
[23:37] something now guide you on the inside
[23:42] and we find that that critical juncture
[23:45] is where
[23:46] a lot of people make their mistakes
[23:49] right
[23:51] they make horrible mistakes that
[23:54] a lot of times follow them throughout
[23:57] the rest of their lives
[24:01] amen if you go with me here
[24:06] to the message choosing of a bride
[24:11] this message was preached in 1965.
[24:17] amen uh 04
[24:22] 29 if you can finance this and pull that
[24:25] up for me
[24:28] we'll be reading from uh the 51st
[24:32] chapter
[24:36] and the prophet there was was saying
[24:40] uh he said if we would study what we're
[24:43] doing
[24:45] when we go to get married
[24:49] he said when we choose our wife
[24:53] our husband if we
[24:56] study it over a man
[24:59] should pray earnestly
[25:03] for he could ruin his entire
[25:08] life now i want
[25:11] to remind you that uh if
[25:14] you can you find this sister there uh
[25:17] choose another bride
[25:20] 65 04 29 evening
[25:23] amen now we found that he said he said
[25:26] uh if you pray honestly for he could
[25:29] ruin his
[25:30] entire life remember the
[25:33] vow is until death
[25:36] do we part until
[25:40] death do we part now i know many people
[25:43] don't
[25:45] live by that no more but that's still
[25:47] bible
[25:48] right that's still bible right amen
[25:52] now and he could ruin his
[25:56] life by making a wrong
[25:59] choice i remember
[26:02] revelation 24
[26:05] eliezer is going out to find a wife
[26:08] for isaac i mean i'm sorry genesis
[26:12] yes genesis 24 he's going out to find a
[26:16] wife
[26:17] now
[26:20] but if he knows what he's making a wrong
[26:23] choice and he marry a woman
[26:25] that isn't fit to be his wife
[26:31] and he does it anyway
[26:34] then it's his fault
[26:37] if a woman takes a husband
[26:40] and knows that he's not fit to be
[26:44] a husband to you then that's your
[26:48] own fault after you
[26:52] know what's right and wrong
[26:55] so you shouldn't do it until you
[26:59] thoroughly thoroughly
[27:02] pray through now i want you to pay
[27:06] close attention right here he says
[27:10] the same applies
[27:14] to choosing a church
[27:21] because he your pastor is your spiritual
[27:32] husband
[27:34] your spiritual husband
[27:38] not wife
[27:41] husband amen
[27:47] now
[27:50] you must pray over the church
[27:54] that you are fellowshipping in
[28:00] you must pray over
[28:03] the church that you
[28:06] are fellowshipping in
[28:11] churches carry
[28:19] [Music]
[28:23] you must pray over
[28:27] the mate that you choose right
[28:31] you choose the wrong one
[28:34] you're gonna have to deal with that
[28:37] spirit
[28:41] until death do you part
[28:48] now i go back to restoration of the
[28:51] bride tree
[28:53] you don't have to pull it up
[28:56] he was saying that the same way
[29:01] that the insect
[29:06] the devouring insect
[29:09] that changes its characters and changes
[29:12] its form
[29:15] the same way he attacks the individual
[29:19] is the same way he attacks the church
[29:26] am i okay am i loud enough okay thank
[29:28] you my brother let me know
[29:30] sometimes i tend to pull away and they
[29:32] can't they can't hear me too good on the
[29:34] stream so uh
[29:39] we have to understand that
[29:42] that that that when choosing
[29:45] a bride when uh
[29:49] a a a a a woman don't choose a husband
[29:52] she submits to right okay
[29:55] so so so even in your submittal you must
[29:59] be
[30:00] wary of what you submitting to
[30:03] yeah right
[30:06] my point here is you have to really
[30:09] honestly seek god
[30:12] now first you have to ask yourself what
[30:16] are you looking for
[30:19] what are you looking for in a mate
[30:23] you're looking for good looks
[30:26] hello you're looking for someone
[30:29] who merely makes a lot of money hello
[30:34] you see we we we're we're we're back to
[30:37] that bride tree again
[30:40] we we we it says that that tree
[30:43] you'll know that tree by the fruit that
[30:46] it bears
[30:49] eliezer he was not necessarily looking
[30:52] for
[30:53] the most beautiful damsel
[30:57] he say the one who are asked to drink
[31:00] and she is kind enough
[31:03] to not only give me a drink
[31:07] but she also gave my camels
[31:10] right
[31:13] she said wow what a spirit she has on
[31:17] her
[31:18] yeah he was looking at her
[31:21] character
[31:26] he he wasn't he wasn't concerned about
[31:29] nothing else
[31:33] he didn't choose a well the one that
[31:36] come out
[31:37] and and got the shortest skirt on
[31:42] the one that come out and battle eyes
[31:46] and show me all 32 all right
[31:51] no the one
[31:55] that came out amen and was able to be
[31:58] a servant yeah
[32:01] [Music]
[32:04] meek lowly and humble
[32:09] god amen
[32:12] not some wild staring eye
[32:16] all right prophet told a story about
[32:19] going out picking the the uh
[32:22] heifer for the bull and he would look
[32:25] that bull in the face
[32:27] right in the eye and he said nope
[32:30] that ain't the one say why cause she got
[32:33] that wild stare
[32:34] she'll never be a good mother to your
[32:36] cheering
[32:40] and we see that so much today
[32:43] so getting back to to our topic here
[32:48] choosing of a bride if you could pull
[32:49] that back up he says now i don't
[32:52] want to be critical but i realize that
[32:54] i'm an old man
[32:55] and i gotta leave here one of these days
[32:59] and i've got to answer one day for the
[33:02] judd uh answer one day of the judgment
[33:06] for what i say tonight or
[33:10] any other time and i therefore i've
[33:14] got to be dead earnest and truthful
[33:19] truly convicted
[33:22] but you go into a church
[33:25] and if you'll watch the behavior
[33:29] of that church you just watch the pastor
[33:32] a while
[33:34] and you'll usually find that the church
[33:37] acts like the pastor sometimes
[33:40] i wonder if we just don't get one
[33:44] another spirit instead of the holy
[33:46] spirit
[33:48] you get to a place
[33:53] where the pastor is real
[33:56] radical and carrying on
[34:00] you find out the congregation
[34:03] is the same way i'll bring you to a
[34:07] church where i see a pastor stand and
[34:10] jerk his head back and forth
[34:12] you watch the congregation they're doing
[34:14] the same thing
[34:16] you take a pastor just gulp down
[34:19] anything
[34:22] usually the church would do the same
[34:25] thing
[34:27] so if i was choosing a church
[34:32] i would choose a genuine
[34:37] fundamental full
[34:40] gospel bible
[34:43] church one to
[34:47] put my family in
[34:50] amen one to put my family in that's it
[34:53] sister stop right there
[34:55] i would choose a fundamental
[34:59] full gospel church now we were speaking
[35:02] uh earlier
[35:03] a couple of weeks ago i was talking
[35:06] about
[35:07] how i mean in the in the
[35:10] that's four stage insect the devouring
[35:14] insect and the things that
[35:18] that that he does and he he wants to um
[35:21] um
[35:21] separate he wants to divide he wants to
[35:25] he wants to to ruin the fellowship
[35:29] the tree the the the the the tree comes
[35:32] up
[35:32] the leaves and from the leaves the bread
[35:35] the branches and then the leaves and
[35:36] then the fruit
[35:38] fruit is the character of the person i
[35:40] mean the leaves of the fellowship of the
[35:42] people
[35:43] amen the bark is the covering and and
[35:46] all of that comes from the life that's
[35:48] in the tree amen to push
[35:52] all of these things out so we find that
[35:55] the devil wants to do what
[35:56] when the tree is sick because it the
[35:58] first thing it begins to lose is its
[36:00] leaves
[36:03] leaves are falling there's something
[36:05] wrong
[36:07] there's something that has gotten into
[36:09] that tree that is causing it
[36:11] amen to be just a little sick the life
[36:14] is not
[36:15] quite it's not pushing forth anymore
[36:19] so we find
[36:22] that the prophet said if your pastor
[36:26] leaves the word or refuse
[36:30] to preach the full gospel
[36:33] you lead the pastor
[36:38] a lot of times what we're looking for
[36:41] is some uh what's the word i had
[36:48] oh god a social
[36:53] butterfly a lot of times
[36:57] you you you if if your pastor if your
[37:00] pastor is
[37:02] if preaching and the word of god may
[37:06] make it he don't call me enough
[37:11] or he don't he don't shake now he'll
[37:13] smile in my
[37:14] face and love and he don't come he ain't
[37:17] ca
[37:18] god ain't choosing this man to be your
[37:20] personal uh
[37:22] uh a feel good button
[37:27] he is there to preach the gospel
[37:31] he is there under an eagle anointing
[37:34] amen to we're searching for a damsel to
[37:38] present
[37:39] to isaac
[37:43] so he's not he he's not he's not
[37:46] a social charmer right
[37:50] he's not there to be your social charmer
[37:53] look i ain't gonna say that i almost
[37:55] said little gold crew sitting there
[37:57] drinking it
[37:59] but i said somebody's brother's got gold
[38:01] t so i don't want to offend you
[38:04] but but i mean he's not you you're
[38:08] looking for the wrong thing
[38:11] you're looking for someone to oh smash
[38:14] oh this guy no i'm looking for somebody
[38:18] who's going to
[38:19] preach to me the gospel who's going to
[38:22] prepare
[38:22] me who's going to preach the word of god
[38:25] to me
[38:26] tell me what my husband would have me to
[38:29] do
[38:29] so that when i am presented to him i can
[38:33] be
[38:33] fully rest and dressed and ready to meet
[38:36] him
[38:37] tell me about this isaac
[38:42] tell me amen how i must carry myself
[38:46] educate me on what pleases him yes
[38:50] amen amen how can i be a good wife
[38:54] to him for some
[38:58] well he ain't hanging out he ain't
[39:00] preaching what i want
[39:04] pray about the
[39:07] church that you set up under
[39:12] it's the same as choosing a pride
[39:15] it is more critical
[39:19] than choosing a natural mate
[39:23] you will get in some of these places and
[39:26] take on a spirit
[39:29] [Music]
[39:30] that you have trouble shaking
[39:33] all your life
[39:40] denominational traditions
[39:48] amen turn to john
[39:52] 16th chapter 12th verse
[39:57] john 16 chapter 12 verse this is very
[40:01] important my brothers and sisters as i
[40:03] said before we are up under an eagle
[40:06] anointing
[40:09] this anointing does what an
[40:12] eagle flies high
[40:15] he flies high i would i i i laid in
[40:18] last week revelation 3 18
[40:23] they buy a i counsel thee
[40:26] to buy of me gold
[40:29] amen that that may have the i said
[40:33] what i said to to to to vision
[40:37] is important at this stage
[40:40] that's why the eagle was chosen as the
[40:44] anointing
[40:45] for this age because see the eagle has a
[40:48] keen
[40:48] vision the higher he goes the more
[40:54] focused his vision becomes the big
[40:57] he can fly higher than any other bird
[41:01] i was reading the thing about how uh
[41:05] the crow would get on the eagle's back
[41:09] and peck at its neck
[41:12] the eagle don't even swat
[41:15] at the crow don't pay him no attention
[41:19] whatsoever
[41:20] what does he do he begin to spread his
[41:24] wings and take flight
[41:27] the higher he go after a while the
[41:30] air gets so thin that crow cannot handle
[41:34] it and he just falls off that's right
[41:38] amen so when you're you're that you're
[41:41] you're
[41:42] crawl sometimes get on your back
[41:45] get on your little nerves just get
[41:48] higher
[41:49] hallelujah just fly higher under the
[41:52] anointing
[41:55] they'll fall away they can't follow you
[41:59] there
[42:00] you're up under an eagle anointing
[42:04] under that eagle anointing we're calling
[42:06] out
[42:07] a bride under that eagle anointing
[42:13] amen because we have a vision
[42:16] amen john 16
[42:21] 12 verse it says
[42:26] i have yet many things to say to you
[42:31] but ye cannot bear them now
[42:34] how be it when he the spirit
[42:39] of truth is come he will guide you
[42:44] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[42:47] will
[42:47] guide you into all truth for he shall
[42:51] not
[42:51] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[42:54] hear that shall he speak and he will
[42:58] show you things to come amen that's that
[43:02] eagle anointing
[43:04] showing you things to come
[43:07] is a prophetic gift right
[43:12] first john go to first john
[43:16] first john the fourth chapter the sixth
[43:20] verse
[43:21] it reads on this wise we are of god
[43:25] he that knoweth god heareth
[43:29] us i'ma read that again
[43:34] we are of god
[43:37] he that knoweth god heareth
[43:41] us he that is not
[43:44] of god heareth not us
[43:48] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[43:53] and the spirit of era
[43:58] if you have the spirit of truth dwelling
[44:02] in you which is the holy spirit
[44:05] then the evidence of that according to
[44:08] john was that you would be
[44:12] able to hear and understand
[44:15] the word of truth that they were
[44:17] speaking of
[44:18] for that day glory to god that was the
[44:21] evidence
[44:22] that the spirit of truth about it
[44:26] in you because it would lead you
[44:30] to the truth
[44:34] that is the evidence that you got it
[44:37] right that the spit if this
[44:40] spirit that raised christ
[44:44] from the dead dwells in you
[44:48] it would quicken
[44:52] your mortal body amen
[44:57] amen glory the evidence
[45:02] the evidence that that
[45:06] spirit lies within you is that
[45:09] you have an ear to hear
[45:12] i hear my master call
[45:16] amen
[45:23] let's go to matthew 24.
[45:26] matthew 24. i'm gonna try to be quick
[45:32] but of that day and the hour
[45:35] north no man not the angels of heaven
[45:39] but my father only jesus is referring
[45:42] here to the future time
[45:45] of his second coming but as it was in
[45:48] the days of noah
[45:51] where so shall also
[45:55] the coming of the son of man be i want
[45:57] you to notice carefully
[45:59] as it was in the days of noah what was
[46:02] happening
[46:03] you could take that down what was
[46:05] happening
[46:07] in the days of noah life before the
[46:09] flood
[46:11] for many years prior to the flood
[46:15] noah in his group were preparing the ark
[46:20] in other words the coming
[46:24] of the son of man was taking place
[46:29] during the preparation
[46:33] of the ark
[46:36] the entering into the ark was yes the
[46:39] final step
[46:43] they had to gather
[46:46] oh oh geez they had to
[46:50] first gather the material
[46:54] to build the ark and under the
[46:58] leadership of a prophet
[47:01] under the holy spirit the anointing for
[47:05] that time
[47:08] under the inspiration of that hour
[47:12] they were moved amen to build an
[47:16] ark a certain way
[47:20] so what was that that was
[47:25] the preparing for
[47:28] the time the rain would come
[47:32] they didn't wait to the rain come to
[47:35] start building the ark
[47:40] so after the ark was prepared they had
[47:43] to gather
[47:45] the animals two by two
[47:48] and all those and get them into the ark
[47:51] of safety
[47:54] still no rain fail
[47:59] the going into the yard was just the
[48:03] final stage
[48:05] the call went out during the preparation
[48:08] of the yard
[48:11] the call as it was in the days of noah
[48:14] so shall it be
[48:18] so the call is going out now
[48:22] everybody is looking for
[48:25] a big bang moment no
[48:29] he'll come like a thief
[48:32] in the night i tell you
[48:38] let me go on
[48:43] amen go to if you will
[48:47] because i said last week i wanted to
[48:48] bring this out luke 17
[48:50] 35.
[48:55] luke 17 luke 17 35
[49:00] it says two women shall be grinding
[49:02] together
[49:04] one shall be taken and the other left
[49:07] two men shall be in the field
[49:11] and the two men shall be in the field
[49:14] the other one shall be taken
[49:18] and the other left and they answered and
[49:21] said unto him
[49:22] where lord and he said unto them
[49:26] whatsoever the body is
[49:29] feather will the eagles
[49:33] be gathered together
[49:37] he didn't say ego they're the egos
[49:40] plural
[49:41] will be gathered together this will
[49:44] take place during the age
[49:48] at the eagle anointing
[49:51] under an eagle anointing when a prophet
[49:55] amen is on the scene
[49:58] amen and the people are being gathered
[50:01] together
[50:02] by this prophet's message
[50:07] being gathered together by this prophets
[50:12] message and the message
[50:16] christ identified the same
[50:20] he says here this message preached in
[50:22] 1964.
[50:24] and now we find that in that in each one
[50:28] of those ages usually people don't want
[50:30] to believe it
[50:33] and just like today usually people don't
[50:35] want to believe it but we're going to
[50:36] get into something watch this
[50:38] because they're already set in their way
[50:42] didn't i tell you what's real important
[50:46] what church you choose
[50:49] let me read here he says
[50:54] he says you they're already setting
[50:56] their way
[50:57] you're turning a corner
[51:00] you're building a building and then
[51:03] get to a corner and everybody is just
[51:06] running this way and they don't want to
[51:09] turn the corner
[51:10] but the building goes that way if the
[51:13] word
[51:14] says it goes that way see there's
[51:17] where we get those junctions of time
[51:21] there's where it's hard that's where men
[51:25] has to sweat it out what happened
[51:30] they get caught up under tradition
[51:36] you're building
[51:39] a building you're building a wall at
[51:42] some point
[51:44] for it to be a building
[51:48] you have to make a turn
[51:51] if you never make a turn all you're
[51:53] doing is building a long wall
[51:55] right so uh uh uh we're
[51:59] in the gospel we're building a building
[52:03] we're building a
[52:04] person we're building a temple right
[52:08] i tried to bring that out last week
[52:10] couple weeks ago
[52:12] with the building of solomon's temple i
[52:15] took from
[52:16] the message on dedication
[52:19] and how the material
[52:23] the material to build the temple was
[52:26] gathered
[52:26] from all over the place each
[52:30] component was special
[52:34] in its own way one wood was called
[52:38] stink wood now maybe no one had
[52:42] anything for that purpose of what it's
[52:46] even in its name it it why would we use
[52:49] this maybe oh
[52:53] no one wanted wants to use but see god
[52:56] has prepared
[52:58] you specifically
[53:03] in your makeup and your your
[53:06] motives and your twerks and everything
[53:09] about you
[53:10] he has designed it specifically to fit
[53:13] joint perfectly in that building
[53:19] allow god to perfectly
[53:22] place you where he wants you to be
[53:26] a lot of times we find we're trying to
[53:29] force ourselves in the places where god
[53:32] never wanted us to be
[53:33] right trying to
[53:37] force yourself i've i find many of you
[53:40] i got no business out here to the club i
[53:43] don't even fit in with these people
[53:45] right but you try to take on their
[53:47] spirit you try to do like them you try
[53:49] and not talk no one you are getting in
[53:54] trouble
[53:56] you trying to fit in and let me tell you
[53:58] something it's
[53:59] obvious when you're trying to fit in
[54:02] they know it everybody else know it the
[54:05] only person don't see it is you
[54:07] that's right when you just trying
[54:10] to fit in
[54:13] be who god made you to be
[54:18] you'll find joy and peace in that
[54:23] trying to do something else trying to be
[54:25] someone else for somebody else
[54:27] it ain't never gonna work
[54:32] he will you are made chosen selected
[54:37] all of your ways and quirks and
[54:40] different things
[54:42] heat's put up now that's exactly right
[54:45] why defeatly
[54:48] put you as a part of this building this
[54:52] temple
[54:56] but remember i said a lot of times we
[54:58] find ourselves in the
[55:00] under the rome in the hands of the wrong
[55:02] contractor
[55:04] under the tutelage amen of a man who
[55:08] says he's a builder
[55:10] but he's not following the blueprint
[55:13] solomon followed the blueprint for that
[55:16] temple
[55:17] amen to build it just like the way
[55:20] moses saw it in heaven
[55:25] amen and you were chosen specifically
[55:29] the materials amen uh uh uh for that
[55:33] you were chosen as part of the material
[55:35] for that building
[55:37] says here now solomon notice solomon
[55:39] never vary one bit from that pattern
[55:41] moses saw it on mount sinai in heaven
[55:46] moses when he returned from his vision
[55:48] under an eagle anointing
[55:50] pitched a tent and made it just exactly
[55:54] the way he saw it in heaven
[55:56] and when solomon built the temple he
[55:58] made it just exactly the way
[56:00] he's seeing the pattern that type moses
[56:04] pitched
[56:05] oh what a full fundamental gospel church
[56:08] that'll stay with the word build it just
[56:12] never get off of the pack build it
[56:16] trust in him amen of his craftsmanship
[56:19] his leadership to able to build this
[56:23] temple hey man
[56:26] for the master to dwell in
[56:30] amen sister if you will turn to john 2.
[56:35] john 2. i won't be before you alone
[56:39] john 2.
[56:45] oh hallelujah
[56:53] now the same temple
[56:56] amen
[57:04] john 2 13 this same temple
[57:07] jesus came to this temple now solomon
[57:10] had built this temple and it was perfect
[57:13] amen jesus came and and blessed it
[57:17] the house was filled with the presence
[57:20] of god
[57:21] and all this temple was was was was
[57:25] looked upon
[57:26] down through the ages but what happened
[57:31] jesus come along
[57:36] and the jews that passover was at hand
[57:38] and found
[57:40] the the jews passover was at hand and
[57:43] jesus went
[57:44] up to jerusalem and found in the temple
[57:49] those that sold oxen and
[57:52] sheep and doves and the changes
[57:57] of money sitting and when he had
[58:01] made a scourge of small cords
[58:05] he drove them out of the temple
[58:08] and the sheep and the oxen
[58:13] and poured out the changes of money
[58:16] and overthrew the tables and
[58:19] said unto them that soul doves
[58:22] take these things hence make not
[58:26] my father's house a house of
[58:29] merchandise and
[58:33] his disciples remembered
[58:36] that it was written the zeal of the time
[58:40] of thine house has eaten me up
[58:43] now i wanna i wanna i wanna i wanna
[58:45] focus on that
[58:47] he came into that temple and seen that
[58:49] that temple had been
[58:50] defiled so we see what the word the word
[58:57] jesus christ
[59:00] drove those spirits out of the temple
[59:07] now let's go back to the restoration of
[59:08] the bride tree
[59:11] the same way the devil will attack a
[59:14] trade attack individual
[59:18] jesus drove those spirits
[59:21] out of the temple
[59:24] look at the man called legion
[59:29] no doubt don't record what he'd been
[59:33] through
[59:33] how he got those demons
[59:38] but jesus drove those
[59:42] spirits out
[59:46] sometimes we have things in us that need
[59:50] to be driven
[59:51] out because we are the temple
[59:56] amen that he wants to dwell in the
[1:00:00] church
[1:00:01] the temple made up of the people the
[1:00:04] pride
[1:00:06] that his spirit wants to dwell in
[1:00:09] so sometimes we have to make sure
[1:00:12] amen that we drive out
[1:00:15] those spirits
[1:00:20] remember behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:00:25] and he cometh to find that his bride
[1:00:29] has made herself ready
[1:00:33] that she's clothed with the right
[1:00:36] character she's clothed
[1:00:39] with righteousness she's clothed with
[1:00:42] righteousness
[1:00:43] i want keeping that in mind i want you
[1:00:46] to go to the message
[1:00:47] total deliverance i want to read
[1:00:49] something here 1959. this francis was
[1:00:52] preached
[1:00:53] in july 1959
[1:00:57] by william branham
[1:01:00] amen paragraph 94
[1:01:04] i have it all written near believe and
[1:01:07] the disciples
[1:01:09] had total deliverance absolutely total
[1:01:12] deliverance why
[1:01:13] because they were completely and totally
[1:01:16] filled
[1:01:17] with the holy ghost see
[1:01:20] when when you just a church
[1:01:24] member and shook the pastor's hand
[1:01:27] or some had some kind of little
[1:01:31] experience of
[1:01:32] jumping shouting or speaking in tongues
[1:01:34] or something
[1:01:35] another and still have
[1:01:39] malice in your heart strange acts
[1:01:44] telling lies smoking
[1:01:48] cigarettes lusting after women and
[1:01:51] there something hasn't happened yet
[1:01:56] these things are still in the temple
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:04] something hasn't happened yet there's
[1:02:06] something wrong
[1:02:08] for he that loves the world and the
[1:02:11] things of the world the love of god
[1:02:14] is not in him you've been
[1:02:18] mis
[1:02:25] you've been misled
[1:02:29] now i started out by saying how
[1:02:30] important it is
[1:02:33] and how honestly you should pray when
[1:02:36] choosing
[1:02:36] it's not just something that you
[1:02:38] haphazardly do oh i want to go here
[1:02:40] cause they got a good debate here
[1:02:42] that ain't how you choose a church
[1:02:45] i want to go here because the people
[1:02:47] seem so nice
[1:02:55] you have been misled by the fruits you
[1:02:59] shall know them
[1:03:00] we are we all want to be
[1:03:04] unified together
[1:03:08] with the holy spirit every member
[1:03:11] should be unified one with
[1:03:15] the other the love of god is
[1:03:18] shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[1:03:22] ghost
[1:03:22] it cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[1:03:26] and all unrighteousness we are delivered
[1:03:30] from the things of the world jesus said
[1:03:33] this will all men know that you're my
[1:03:37] disciples
[1:03:38] when you got love one for the other
[1:03:43] when one member loves other members so
[1:03:46] much
[1:03:48] that it would die for it that's heaven
[1:03:54] when one evil thing starts the outside
[1:03:58] world some women come along and say now
[1:04:01] look
[1:04:01] dear it would be better for you
[1:04:05] if you did this or do that
[1:04:08] wore this or did that done
[1:04:12] this and got away from that bunch of
[1:04:15] holy rollers or
[1:04:17] and so forth like that we are so
[1:04:20] unified with god
[1:04:23] you say brother branham it's an awful
[1:04:26] temptation
[1:04:27] but christ died for that purpose
[1:04:32] my god the devil is defeated
[1:04:36] we want total deliverance we
[1:04:39] want a church that is pure clean
[1:04:43] and unadulterated washed in the blood of
[1:04:46] the lamb
[1:04:46] filled with the holy spirit signs
[1:04:49] wonders and miracles
[1:04:51] total delivery everyone
[1:04:58] everyone that's our goal
[1:05:04] to present a bride
[1:05:07] we're we're only responsible for this
[1:05:10] local church
[1:05:12] now see this is this is this is preached
[1:05:14] on two dimensions
[1:05:15] personally and locally
[1:05:21] where i was talking about the gathering
[1:05:22] of together what binds us
[1:05:25] the mortar boundary what is that the
[1:05:26] love of god
[1:05:29] a bonding agent has been placed between
[1:05:32] us what the love of god that binds us
[1:05:36] together
[1:05:37] under the holy spirit that if you begin
[1:05:41] to pull away
[1:05:42] you can't go because we're bonded so
[1:05:45] tightly
[1:05:46] when you struggle i struggle when you
[1:05:49] sway
[1:05:50] the winds of turmoil may blow on the
[1:05:53] wall
[1:05:54] bling ball in the building we all work
[1:05:56] in unison and move together
[1:05:58] praise god but it don't break us
[1:06:02] cause we have been bonded together
[1:06:06] through real christian love
[1:06:09] under the holy spirit
[1:06:12] amen that is preparing the temple
[1:06:17] man of christ to present to him a blo
[1:06:20] a bride without a spot without a blemish
[1:06:25] without one spot without one wrinkle
[1:06:27] who's clothed and ready to meet
[1:06:30] her isaac amen
[1:06:34] now we see here where the devil comes to
[1:06:36] pervert
[1:06:38] amen and and it shows here in in the
[1:06:41] message oneness
[1:06:43] of unity how you know satan is putting
[1:06:46] together
[1:06:46] he's he's he's doing some work too he's
[1:06:50] he's he wants to be he's a perverter
[1:06:53] of righteousness he can't create
[1:06:57] so what he does is try to mimic what he
[1:06:59] see god doing
[1:07:01] amen we are
[1:07:05] and and there's a term
[1:07:09] called homeostasis
[1:07:14] i was i called my wife and i said hey
[1:07:16] what what
[1:07:18] tell me about this i remember her
[1:07:19] talking about it and going through
[1:07:21] medical classes and stuff
[1:07:24] i looked it up after she explained to me
[1:07:28] all about it
[1:07:30] in biology the term homeostasis refers
[1:07:32] to the ability
[1:07:34] for the body to maintain stable
[1:07:37] internal environment despite the changes
[1:07:41] of
[1:07:42] its external conditions
[1:07:47] the stability or balance
[1:07:52] that is attained is called a dynamic
[1:07:55] equilibrium
[1:07:58] that is as change occur
[1:08:01] the body works to maintain
[1:08:04] relatively uniform conditions
[1:08:12] homeostasis
[1:08:17] we don't want to be too cold
[1:08:21] the body operates
[1:08:25] at a certain temperature if we our body
[1:08:29] gets
[1:08:30] sick
[1:08:34] are we in tune with our body man that's
[1:08:37] what brother quaker was talking about we
[1:08:39] must be in tune
[1:08:41] we must be in tune with our body to know
[1:08:45] when we are
[1:08:46] out of homeostasis something
[1:08:50] ain't right i'm talking to the church
[1:08:56] i'm talking to the individual
[1:09:00] you should know something ain't right i
[1:09:03] don't
[1:09:04] feel quite right

[1:09:50] and indifferent well if you're running a
[1:09:53] little cold and indifferent
[1:09:55] well there's the problem you know
[1:09:59] your body has to operate at a certain
[1:10:02] temperature
[1:10:03] when you get when the body temperature
[1:10:06] drops
[1:10:07] and it's not operating at that certain
[1:10:09] temperature
[1:10:10] amen you find yourself a little sluggish
[1:10:14] you find yourself you just don't feel
[1:10:17] like praising the lord
[1:10:19] what you got to do is you got to get
[1:10:21] amongst the saints cigar
[1:10:23] amen you got to allow yourself to get
[1:10:26] built back up to a certain temperature
[1:10:29] amen to where you back in homeostasis
[1:10:32] sometimes you get a little cold and get
[1:10:35] a little different i don't want to come
[1:10:36] to church
[1:10:38] i don't know those people uh
[1:10:41] trying to look malice and the devil and
[1:10:44] see that ain't nothing but that insect
[1:10:45] watch that insect he coming planting
[1:10:47] them
[1:10:48] seeds come planting them eggs in your
[1:10:51] mind
[1:10:51] and you begin to think on these things
[1:10:53] but get a little cold you don't want to
[1:10:55] worship no more
[1:10:56] you don't stand and sing the songs of
[1:10:59] zion hey man you don't feel the warmth
[1:11:01] amen of the sun you can't get
[1:11:03] warmed by a painted fire yeah
[1:11:06] you got to come and you got to get in
[1:11:08] the presence of the sun
[1:11:10] amen and and and and getting the right
[1:11:12] temperature
[1:11:14] for that egg to hatch it has to sit up
[1:11:17] under
[1:11:18] amen the chicken and it has to be kept
[1:11:20] at the right
[1:11:21] temperature
[1:11:24] it can't hatch when it's too cold
[1:11:29] we don't want to be lukewarm neither
[1:11:32] the bible say he look long he said i
[1:11:35] spilled you out my mouth
[1:11:39] the analogy of the frog in the
[1:11:42] in in the water those spirits
[1:11:46] that frog are getting that lukewarm
[1:11:48] water and he get comfortable
[1:11:50] if you're lukewarm he'll stay right
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:54] amen and it can stay that high
[1:11:57] that frog in your lukewarm condition
[1:12:02] sitting there in the lukewarm condition
[1:12:05] smiling shaking hands but in your heart
[1:12:08] you're being critical
[1:12:11] frog in that lukewarm condition
[1:12:18] you want to maintain
[1:12:21] a balance 98.7
[1:12:26] i believe it is i want to maintain
[1:12:30] a good temperature
[1:12:33] and you know what happened when chains
[1:12:36] enter into the body and there's an
[1:12:38] infection oh that temperature rises
[1:12:42] what does that mean that this blood
[1:12:45] cells are going to where that
[1:12:48] infection is that and those blood cells
[1:12:51] are
[1:12:51] sacrificing their life to kill
[1:12:55] that infection to keep the body
[1:12:58] in homeostasis
[1:13:03] there's a battle going on so the
[1:13:06] temperature raises
[1:13:08] oh there's something wrong i need help
[1:13:11] so what it does it calls a solemn prayer
[1:13:14] meeting
[1:13:15] saints all come together praying for
[1:13:18] sister such and such
[1:13:19] there's a battle going on
[1:13:23] the temperature gets a little hotter
[1:13:24] everybody raised up a little bit
[1:13:28] why cause there's a battle going on
[1:13:32] it might be down in my pinky toe
[1:13:35] but my head knows it my heart knows it
[1:13:38] my hand knows it my foot
[1:13:39] knows it if i stump my pinky toe you
[1:13:43] know what
[1:13:44] everything in my body compensates for
[1:13:46] that
[1:13:48] my hands immediately go down to comfort
[1:13:50] my toe
[1:13:53] if i walk with a limp my hip are making
[1:13:56] adjustments to
[1:13:57] to balance things out my knees might
[1:14:00] make a compensation on how i walk
[1:14:02] just from my pinky toe
[1:14:09] we are the body of christ
[1:14:14] we're a bride

[1:15:10] 2020 under a prophetic
[1:15:15] anointing a vision

[1:15:26] make no mistake about it it was not an
[1:15:30] attack
[1:15:32] against the united states russia
[1:15:36] china it was an attack against the bride
[1:15:39] of jesus christ
[1:15:43] these are demonic spirits
[1:15:46] that came from the pits of the
[1:15:48] bottomless pit
[1:15:50] to do what to divide
[1:15:53] and cause turmoil amongst the body
[1:15:57] but shall the temperature be raised
[1:16:01] and we come together united in love
[1:16:05] amen pray one for the other amen so that

[1:19:18] uh certainly thank god for everyone
[1:19:21] joining us online tonight and

[1:19:26] thought that brother
[1:19:27] troy brought to us tonight on behold the
[1:19:30] bridegroom cometh
[1:19:32] that thought on homeostasis um
[1:19:36] i hope we're catching spiritually what
[1:19:39] he is
[1:19:40] uh telling us that he read the
[1:19:42] definition there
[1:19:43] uh internally we're trying to fight
[1:19:47] the things that are coming at us
[1:19:49] externally
[1:19:50] and uh and there's so much in 2020 that
[1:19:53] has been thrown
[1:19:54] at the body of christ externally and if
[1:19:58] you're not
[1:19:58] spiritual you will miss
[1:20:02] what god is actually doing you know in
[1:20:04] this hour so
[1:20:05] we can't have our attention on all the
[1:20:08] news and
[1:20:10] uh everything that's happening on
[1:20:12] facebook or
[1:20:13] you know everything that's happening in
[1:20:15] social media
[1:20:16] all of that is nonsense amen we got to
[1:20:19] keep our attention on what the lord is
[1:20:21] doing him
[1:20:22] and uh and and just a mere title said
[1:20:24] behold the break room cometh
[1:20:26] you know and when when the brock rooms
[1:20:28] come in those virgins had to be in a
[1:20:30] certain place
[1:20:31] and ready praise god they had to have
[1:20:34] oil in their lamps the holy ghost
[1:20:37] and uh you know so that this is a thing
[1:20:39] where we want to make sure that we're
[1:20:41] we're we're prepared we're ready for
[1:20:43] what the lord is doing in this hour
[1:20:45] uh i believe that the coming of the lord
[1:20:48] is closer than it has
[1:20:50] ever been and uh and one thing i want to
[1:20:53] do is keep my eyes on christ so i want
[1:20:55] to encourage you to do that
[1:20:57] i i thank god for the word of the lord
[1:20:59] tonight
[1:21:00] and just just so much was shared there
[1:21:03] so much was shared that i know it was
[1:21:05] the lord speaking to his people
[1:21:07] uh i wanted to just quickly mention a
[1:21:09] couple things i noted at the beginning
[1:21:11] of our
[1:21:14] stream tonight and we talk about the
[1:21:17] virtual streaming here
[1:21:19] through periscope and facebook
[1:21:23] periscope just announced i believe
[1:21:25] yesterday
[1:21:26] that they are going to be stopping
[1:21:28] streaming
[1:21:29] they're not going to be doing that i
[1:21:31] think as of uh march or something like
[1:21:33] that of 2021
[1:21:35] so if you try to use periscope you may
[1:21:38] get an
[1:21:39] error i know that happened tonight

[1:22:39] uh welcoming everyone back a man to the
[1:22:41] house of god and
[1:22:43] uh i have um i had the opportunity last
[1:22:47] week in the government visit
[1:22:48] with brother uh steaming and amen the
[1:22:51] church there and
[1:22:52] we had some wonderful services and and i
[1:22:54] was telling them there are certain
[1:22:55] things that happen
[1:22:57] in church when we all come together
[1:23:01] that will not happen while you're at
[1:23:02] home streaming
[1:23:04] and uh you know what happens is that we
[1:23:06] come and we're elevated to
[1:23:08] heavenly places the word of god actually
[1:23:10] elevates us
[1:23:11] as we're saying a man to the word and
[1:23:13] responding to the word
[1:23:15] it's taking us places that we won't get
[1:23:17] at home you know
[1:23:19] and so when we come here and you know uh
[1:23:21] we we we just experienced this
[1:23:23] one of the most powerful services that
[1:23:26] we
[1:23:27] ever had in this church occurred in 2020
[1:23:30] praise the lord amen where the devil
[1:23:32] trying to divide us god gave us one of
[1:23:34] the most powerful services we ever had
[1:23:37] and if there's anything that should be
[1:23:38] happening now our our
[1:23:40] expectations should actually rise
[1:23:43] look if god could do it before then i
[1:23:46] know he can do it again
[1:23:48] if we come with the right expectations
[1:23:50] so you know i
[1:23:51] i i was just you know sharing a few
[1:23:54] things there sharing a testimony over
[1:23:55] there with
[1:23:56] uh brother brother steaming them and and
[1:23:58] as we were
[1:23:59] coming towards the end of the service on
[1:24:01] sunday morning
[1:24:03] i read a quote that i read here at the
[1:24:04] church uh where brother random say i
[1:24:07] defy
[1:24:07] sickness i defy disease i defy
[1:24:10] i defy homeostasis right i defy it and
[1:24:14] and as uh and you know and we were we
[1:24:16] preached a sermon on
[1:24:18] uh built up in the faith for this hour
[1:24:20] you know and i remember when we preached
[1:24:22] that
[1:24:22] uh we read that quote and how the holy
[1:24:25] spirit destructs us to rachel and stuck
[1:24:27] struck sister liz and they just began to
[1:24:29] shout
[1:24:30] and and and the lord just had us take
[1:24:32] that same
[1:24:33] sermon over the uh uh to sarasota and i
[1:24:36] hit that same quote and my god how do
[1:24:39] saints begin to run around the church
[1:24:41] now you know i can't see you running
[1:24:43] around your living room
[1:24:44] praise god amen and most of us not
[1:24:47] running around the living room because
[1:24:49] the anointing is not there the way that
[1:24:51] you would find it here
[1:24:52] praise god so that's why that's why it's
[1:24:54] so important that we get
[1:24:56] what brother trump was trying to share
[1:24:57] with us you know don't let the devil eat
[1:25:00] away
[1:25:00] at the fellowship it's the devil
[1:25:04] amen it's the devil covert is a devil
[1:25:08] it's just got a name right but it's a
[1:25:10] devil any sickness
[1:25:12] is a devil that is attacking the people
[1:25:14] so don't be afraid of these things
[1:25:16] let's not walk in fear let's walk in
[1:25:18] faith god wants us to walk in faith in
[1:25:21] and we're going to have to have faith in
[1:25:22] this hour we're going to have to have
[1:25:25] faith we're not talking about being
[1:25:26] foolish but we got to have some faith
[1:25:29] praise the lord amen amen
[1:25:32] amen i i i'm one and i'll just be honest
[1:25:36] i
[1:25:36] i think what has been released is here
[1:25:38] to stay

[1:25:51] to stay you know so so we have to learn
[1:25:54] how to work around and we just need

[1:29:25] was actually appointed eliezer knew that
[1:29:30] this

[1:29:32] said lord you had already
[1:29:33] shaped this particular young lady you
[1:29:35] have formed her you have made her so
[1:29:38] once she heard the testimony of eleazar
[1:29:41] then she would uh come underneath that
[1:29:44] eagle anointing praise god amen
[1:29:47] she would begin to prepare herself
[1:29:50] because as eliezer was coming to her
[1:29:52] underneath the
[1:29:53] eagle anointing what the prophet abraham
[1:29:56] had shared with him now he's coming to
[1:29:57] her
[1:29:58] and lord she was already prepared to
[1:30:00] subject herself
[1:30:02] lord to the eagle anointed father you
[1:30:04] have people today
[1:30:05] that are ready to subject himself to an
[1:30:08] eagle anointing
[1:30:09] hallelujah what uh we know that you sent
[1:30:11] us a prophet in this hour according to
[1:30:14] malachi 4
[1:30:15] according to revelation 10 according to
[1:30:18] luke 17
[1:30:19] scriptures that are in the bible you
[1:30:21] promised certain things what happened in
[1:30:23] this
[1:30:23] in this last day god the other thing
[1:30:25] that we heard here tonight
[1:30:27] is that where the carcass is the egos
[1:30:31] will gather not just ego but egos will
[1:30:34] gather so look father let the eagles
[1:30:36] come
[1:30:37] and feed on the word of god get strength
