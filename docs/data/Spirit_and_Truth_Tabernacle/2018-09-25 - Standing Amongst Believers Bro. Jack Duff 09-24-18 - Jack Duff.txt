thank you for your anointing that it's been in the house your spirit or that is so real to us thank you for the songs of Zion that have gone forth to bring us into an atmosphere where we can receive something from you and Lord we just trust that you would take control over this portion of the service every spirit that is against the Spirit of God we we we bring it under subjection we act so God that you would just take control of every thought as we just prepare to present the word of the Lord father just help us Lord to receive from heaven on this day so the name of Jesus we pray amen amen amen god bless you while you're standing it's okay I think we're just making adjustments got a new system and Amen I keep cutting out on my mic here so if we can just try to find that while you're standing on your feet turn with me to John chapter 6 I do want to thank the Lord for all the specials that went forth a man just wonderful in knowing to know some of y'all was able to get John's step in this morning hey man if you didn't you missed a good opportunity a man to cut your step but we we just we thank the Lord for his presence a man and his spirit for also why you getting John 6 though that are preparing to go to Tucson and November we're gonna be going up to Tucson and those of you that they haven't gotten your tickets and all that just Dave maybe I have to service I'll share with you some information that I that I got they man regard the tickets and also I did put on the board for hotel information I put a little note there a telephone number you can call email address you can write if you to get your hotel reserved there for that weekend so so keep that in mind amen that is on the board there praise the Lord amen John chapter six and I am reading from verse 60 man the presence of the Lord is here fill it in the atmosphere a man and it's always good to come to church and feel the presence of God a man here in John chapter 6 starting at verse 60 it reads as follows says many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it you said unto them doth this offend you what if ye shall see the Son of man to stand up where he was before it is a spirit that quickeneth and the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life in other words if I could just use modern-day terminology if you can shadow the song you can also shout over the word the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life [Music] but there are some of you notice Jesus talking to this crowd of people but there are some of you that mean they were in church they this one the first time they work visitors these were regular churchgoers right they went to church all the time and Jesus makes this statement in his own church says but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and and i want to kind of you just clarify and that one verse there were actually let me put it this way and in that one verse three groups of believers were identified all right three three groups one that just believed anything and everything jesus said the others that believe not that's what we would call unbelievers but then there was a one that would betray him that's what we call make believers reign a man from this text from these scriptures brother Branham drew the the thought of three kinds of believers let's keep on reading it says and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto Him of my father from that time after that service many of his disciples I'm talk about people you thought was believed us many of his disciples people that used to follow him that that that that that was suck their denominational background too except what Jesus was teaching says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twelve now this is tough after seeing all these people go look at what Jesus does then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe in and I love this we believe we believe and are sure I love Peter he always found himself in trouble a lot of times but but but but he just said remarkable things at the right time right he said say we believe them and and and we are we are sure this extra question are you sure about this thing are you sure about the message of the hour are you sure God sent a prophet are you sure huh glory to God glory to God amen I want to bring it into today's turn so since they said we believe in our sure that thou art that Christ not just not cuz because Christ being anointed one right there's there's there's even many false Christ's but but we need to know who is that Christ that thou art that Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered and after this powerful revelation from Peter powerful statement jesus answered them have not I chosen I mean I specifically picked you out have not I chosen you twelve and one of you I picked you want to use a devil he spake of judas iscariot and he didn't identify them but you know now you know see john could pick this up after Judas did what he did Oh Lord y'all y'all that one went right over y'all here John picked it up after Judas did what he did and some things you ain't gonna be able to pick up until certain things are done all right let me let me just read the rest of this and I'm gonna let y'all be seated he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated there's a there's a lot in here that we hope to address if if the Lord would allow us I want to use for our subject today standing amongst believers man believers that that's just that's where I feel like I am I you know we could see just by reading that Scripture and I told you brother branham used this particular passage of Scripture when he preached the sermon three kinds of believers and and notice I mean he's using I mean just a title of sermon there are believers right but there's there's three kinds of them he says there's their true believer a man there is the make believer and there's the unbeliever now they all were here a man in service on this day they all had experience you know just the mighty move of the Spirit of God they all rejoiced they all shouted you know even some of these folk at some point in time underneath the influence of Jesus ministry cast out devils right I mean they cast out devils and and come back rejoicing hi Devils were subject to them and this this this is the reason Jesus had to stop them in the midst of their rejoicing because unbelievers was casting out Devils right made believers was casting out Devils but Jesus had to stop them saying I don't rejoice because Devils are subject to you and and I love that I love that because what he's trying to get us to see is that you know it's one thing a man to see a manifestation of God but it's a whole nother thing to be able to take the Word of God oh and oftentimes we get caught up because if we see a manifestation they must be of God but Jesus stopped and said don't rejoice because Devils are subject to you but it's a rejoice because your name is actually written in the Lamb's Book of Life right and see what I ought to bring you amen a true joy amen a true shout it's when you see your name Amen that that better I'm not not when you hear your favorite song Amen that just moves your emotion but then you see your name Amen in the book then that should bring joy unspeakable and full of glory here we have this because you know we didn't read the scriptures Amen before this and I know many of you are Bible readers you already know what happened but for those that maybe have not heard the story before let me just explain Jesus teaching amen and he was saying some really really hard things a man some really really hard things and I need y'all to understand that the things that he was saying where it's actually intentional that might shake a few people but but these things were intentional in order to shake down the church to see who really was believers and who was not believers cannot cannot can I tell you something hallelujah you may look around the audience today you might you might look at a bit believer a man based on they dress and you might find out that you absolutely wrong because some folk know how to dress the park huh some people know they know they like they they know just how to do things in church to make it seem like they believers but sometimes God will do things intentionally to shake down the crowd to see you gonna be holding on at the end when the dust settles right I'm not win the time we go we gonna do something throw some dust up in the air but wouldn't the dust paddles we go see who's still stand-in let me put it this way when the trial is over when the tests test a man has reached its final point we're gonna see who still standing then because we don't realize it but we're heading into the final test right now some of us are experiencing it but we don't see you it was a real believer I was you know there's just this little quote that the Prophet you know made in and I don't I won't read it but he was making a statement about joke and he says how Joe the trial that Joe had wasn't just losing his family losing his animals and losing a lot of things that he owned that that won the real thing but what the real trial was it was the devil trying to convince Joe that God was punishing him for what he did that was a real trial it was the devil trying to convince you know you got you gotta catch this because the way he tried to convince joke is he used job's friends the ones that was closest to him Oh y'all in Whitley but the ones that was closest to him he was using dimly try to convince joke that God had forsaken him because something Joe had did but when John had overcome in power where is to realize that this didn't come from God this is coming from the devil and when he caught the revelation on my mind that's why you can say things like you know though we don't though though these skin warms skin worms destroy my flesh he say yet in this same flesh I shall see God huh he caught a revelation of his God in the midst of the trial and you gonna need to catch a revelation of your God in the midst of your trial Jesus told them don't rejoice you know because of the the mighty me should expect it but don't just stop there rejoice don't rejoice because it's your favorite song but we're just because your name is written now you know what happened here in this service if I could just you always just bear with me I want to read just a little bit for you we can kind of catch up a man what happened here in this church service this day here in John sticks amen hallelujah verse 44 let's pick it up there Jesus makes this come and says no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that had heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of God he hath seen the father says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life and look at the words of Jesus a I I am I am that bread of life these are powerful words that he's speaking of man stemming the earth and saying these things I am that bread of life and it goes a little further make sure they get an understanding your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead right it says but this is the bread which cometh down from heaven and that a man may eat thereof and not die he says I am that living grant which came down from heaven Jesus has identified himself in a way that no man has ever identified himself amongst atchoo sand and you can imagine hearing a sermon like this for the first time they struggled with this who is this man that would say something like this you are the bread of life you and the bread that came down from duck how could you make comments like this and notice that says I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this print he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world oh my god amen now notice he said any man eat of this bread just can't eat whatever you want to eat and think you're gonna have life can I go a little further with that statement you just can't go to any denominational Church and thank you gosh I'm like you gotta eat this bread praise praise praise God you gotta eat this bread Jesus said hey man can you see God loves everybody he's certainly assessed he survived that's why he bring truth to him he loved him so much he brings truth I'm gonna let he'd get me even level a little bit more he put free moral agency God's love bit that his level I'll shoot a choose otherwise he can make you love them but let me like let me just help you understand if a man is married to one man gotta make the woman love him that ain't a real relationship hi if a woman is married to a man if the if the woman has to two things to make the male love huh that is not a revelation I mean a true relationship you can't do enough to make another person love you you can't do enough to make God love you be love to because because he just does nothing about eleven stop hey you're bad it's my based on your good is based on its little you see we have to you know Jesus has given them some things you got to read your Bible you got to read between the lines when you read your box yes right I mean Jesus gave very specific words unless you eat this right I mean there was other doctrines around yes but the Pharisees have a doctrine beside you see they also had a doctrine they they didn't believe in the resurrection right that's why they're sad you see [Music] yes they did believe in the resurrection that was their doctrine and whatever the Pharisees believed that was their doctrine but jesus said unless you eat this brain if I can just yes they have back to suggest they have Pentecostal yes I think yes they have Episcopalian but except you eat this way let you eat this bread you won't have eternal life now we don't talk spiritual I mean it's okay we meet natural blessings but we're gonna turn this tank spiritual I said if you're willing to still away all the unbelief of this hour you can be if you still away man I'm talking my auntie she wrote hate on the see things of God each random light for what this is you can be things and we leave we leave there and we go right here to John sticks and we pick up Jesus being the bread of life are you with me alright I'm depending on you I got a lot of quotes that I can read but you know I step out now look the congregation oh ok law what you want to say here today yeah cuz you know we need that we need them we need that we need to hear from the Lord that y'all a question I mean I was here but in a clock here about ten o'clock a phrase what is he about 10:45 I'm gonna say about 11 come on man I mean he was scared by 11:30 early breach denominational preacher this week and he says so out I really liked them share with y'all this lady was sick she was she was I mean she was going through you know the body and Ito to say ma'am I'm afraid please say but I'm sorry you want me to come to church what kind of man of God are you said they just had a breakthrough in medicine you would not be telling the doctor that I can't get out my you will finds what to get to that doctor it's your faith in what they got that's producing your healing and if you had the same kind of faith when it came to the things of God we will see different results you want some from God you got to do something let me go a little further I will come back to my son we have 7:00 a.m. prayer here at this church every Sunday morning 7:00 a.m. Sunday mornings at 9:30 we have Sunday school for the adults it started out being young adults but adults start coming

Thank You Holy Ghost anybody got 7 a.m. classes what all I'm trying to get you to see is that you had to get up in order to be on time for work or to be on time for school why can't you do the same thing when it comes to church what you are demonstrating is that the things that God has blessed you get are more important than the God that gave it to you [Music] [Music] services I'm coming here have some I used to do and uh break it down as we preach it I wanted to get you know to a long when you see that I'll let you know ahead of time let's read this verse 51 I on the little bread which came down from heaven any man eat up this brick and I'm putting emphasis on that you can't just eat whatever bread you want deep and thank you you got either this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said to him barely barely I said to you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drinking his blood he have no life in you right and if this is the heart heart sing he goes I'm sick whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day but my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he didn't eat my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him and as the living father have sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this it is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dead neither eat up this mystery right [Music] [Music] that's good [Music] [Music] even in the temple in the most holy place there was some hidden manna right but jesus said did you see many great men of God and healing campaigns [Music] [Music] right what shake just people that believe the following that's what I'm coming back uh-huh it says but in the midst of all of it the river age never probably that have been or would be there's going to be a certain amount of people that's the main message yeah look at this those ignore the crops those see the bleed was making for the crops they ignore the criticism of the ugly we grow crops and we ignore they don't ignore the crowds they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they have no argument with me [Music] [Music] [Music] some better things all right we have now just help us to see that in the days of Noah there were believers believers right the believers was actually on the boat inside of the boom and when God shut the door to the ark and then they were already inside where the world can no longer get yes we need people for the world and the things of the world can no longer amen and your relationship right you don't you up you up action overcame those things in a relationship you have no situation not that you went looking for but we have to face that the situation you don't get overcome I think that you stole they were speaking that they can any based on Association why do I believe or make believer the that they could get into they are based on Association right they start because they know no one is a is a very time thing we got here like this open up the door and let us get him no no I work with giving the text and because of my association to Noah I know that I'll be able to get it I'm gonna end on the outside but women I just feel one I'm sorry if I feel one proper aid come out and we don't be alright because I have no base from there so she some people think they gonna make a rapture based on their association I want to know the same water that state no no I think no would have tried to open up to go here's the problem North didn't close we go oh no one closes it was God that closed the door and so you playing games about when you reject him and his message rejected God see unless you get Jesus said unless you eat this pray that I put it this way unless you get in this car huh I mean this this is very cool right I mean it's not oh you can do this you can do that no no no no unless you do a more like and let's take out an Noah's Ark they were not going to survive read the books no rapture oh brother Jack that's just too far okay try it [Music] Braves alone amen amen amen all right so let me let me go in a little further I got some things I need to read now so we had unbelievers in those days they thought no was a fanatic crazy lost his mind they criticized him all the time you had to make believe our borderline believing that was thinking it could get in the arc by association Amen are through the kindness of North but you also had to believe it that was already inside the arc and not only was believers in your God had animals animals that believe starts in animals two by two don't mean if it was me I'm just saying if it's my backyard - elephant - lying till she and you see him going to know his boat you all you see all these everyone's going north Oh something out of click that God a man could be so concerned about animals that he would send animals to get in the boat but humans his greatest creation refused his message they just thought that I sleeping with you you want to know how many people want to get saved after California going we're watching the movie yeah I've seen the movie they got it from prophecy let me tell you some of these guys that's writing these movies they're actually on the voice of God Mellon list they are reading brother branham's books listening to his tapes do y'all know Tupac's your cool used to listen to brother branham the man rap prophecy now I didn't listen to it I just read but there other people out in the world studying a prophet and we talked about we don't want the problem so we believe this believe they prophesy all right let me go on I'm trying to get somewhere I'm trying to get something here here here's the thing and days are know we had all of this you know it should have been something to awaken the people but no matter what God does for some reason people just don't hey thanks Lee I'm putting it in your terms so you can understand it you better get mochi God Simha prophet you better get wool all right let me go a little further here Jesus in the days of life Jesus said as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now and I'm 5 passed a lot there's a scripture sacred 17 you find it all there let's go to sacred 17 seeing everything everything don't forget these things so even in here verse 26 and the days know what so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man [Music] they did eat they drank they married wives now I'm gonna tell you something Jesus addressed these things and the Lord just has been dealing with me I'm coming soon coming soon to the church need you I'm gonna take a series a man on the family and you know it's not gonna be I doubt it's gonna be a shot with jumpin preaching you know type time we gotta learn some stuff right because I think we misunderstand you or even how God wants to be involved in relationships amen right so we have to just take time and go through that right brother branham you know there was things that people did before they heard marriage and divorce and brother branham say now now now say God forgive you for that you say but teach your children never to do nothing like that right so we got to teach we got to take tough if Jesus took time and talked about it Paul took time and talked about it where the random took time to talk about it we're gonna take time and talk about it not just in questions and answers it's gonna come from this pulpit because the closest thing to heaven on earth when you trying to hear the voice of God comes from the fool kids hate divorce God does not like it amen and I know if someone say well not if depend on the condition no no I'm gonna show you in Scripture it wasn't so I gotta show these things right because it changes our thought process all right you don't want to come back for a church that's without spot or wrinkle so I'm coming to a church near you I'm just letting you know these things ahead of time that way you know if you decide not to see I set you up but it's certainly like this today hello because after Jesus brought a certain word guess what happened a certain people they dropped off a man I don't get don't get all tits all right let me keep going first one said they did eat they drank they married wives so that that was a marriage and divorce problem in the church because they noticed nothing their own wife they had wives they had two wives three wives for one right they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all so they were they continued in this lifestyle until they were actually destroyed all right likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it so those are those are telltale signs that you're in the end time when he's still out of building all right that's a telltale sign that you in the end time I mean you walk by you drive by a little lot ain't nothing on next thing no God next week everything clearing and something coming up that's a sign that you in the end time right oh my god he says he said but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed and that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in fear let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife let me there's a couple of statements here about that time Abraham was the elected believer in that day and the elect a believer he lived outside a sign can I tell you something Abraham won in Sodom witnessing no he stood on the outside prayed but he did not go down inside him witnessing I think I can win some people certain parties you should not be in certain environments who should not be as I believe Abraham you knew it was God in the flesh and went when these three visitors came up Abraham said my lord lot saw two and lot said my Lords lot had the wrong rep if you ever searched and they preached in three gods you know you're in the wrong term can I go on a little further Abraham has to believe the heck got revealed the secret things to him lot had no idea destruction was on his way and to the Angels got down there and told him but Abraham was in the outside knowing exactly what was given half an asylum and when he heard about it what David him do as a believer yeah uit abraham did not skip the premium until I believe us believers go to prayer meetings you can't make it to the 7:00 a.m. prayer meeting on Sunday morning guess what guess what every other Tuesday set with rooster breath since you can't make it 7:00 a.m. we did 7:30 p.m. the end iodate Sun going down that's when God met Abraham the coolness of the Eve I mean a Adam in the coolest of the even he want to meet you every other Tuesday same time same place right hey mr. t brothers pray one to Z sister pretty other Tuesday believers get involved in something huh believe was realized that time is winding up we got the break oh you want somebody to pray your family through you'll pray your own family through secret things revealed to believe this lot was the make believer he was vexed with the stand down the Sodom but he continued to live in the situation oh yeah bobbin oh I don't like the lifestyle but he lived in do you know what happens if you keep living in the situation you become desensitized and since he was so desensitized a lot didn't do anything and he went to church heard sermons but he never left the situation until angels visited that's when life got it got it got it hurt after he had a supernatural visitation for angels and then he still was delayed hurry get your stuff and get out of here so you like made some bad decisions and one of the bad decisions that lot made was even go down into Sodom and Gomorrah he thought the grass was greener down there that decision impacted his family you know some people make bad decisions and they lose their life in the midst of the decision lot then loses life but his show lost his wife and that's why the Bible says remember Lot's wife well I wonder how many Lots Weiss are even in the church today thinking about thinking about going back you should need to let the front cross your mind you know God brought you to this work you know God revealed it to you when you were just in I mean and your sphere was an uproar you couldn't get enough in the center when God brought you here thanks settle for you and now you're gonna let a devil come and anoint you define something wrong Don them tell you the life and it became explaining it stop trying to I just believe you believe then I know that will make no sense to you sometime it don't make sense to me but that's what I'm called to believe it I'm sorry that's all I see I'm sorry are you open to you know act like they are but they not open make believe was not open so what I have to be [Music] hey yourself in position so when he got so he he made a decision of no Solomon impact to his family he then was right but it showed further lost his wife ever see the sodomites down there were no matter what your Angels Ryan talking to have a visit from I ain't doing that do something you won't bring the angles I will do something with you [Music] y'all know why the being didn't walk the women round because the man has saw so much of the woman's flesh then it didn't turn them on no you think when you win short now preach the word and we retire oh yeah appealing to a man yeah no that's actually turning them all rich let's pray here they won't see it I've seen too much [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] killing somebody because because you have to have great support still want me to do something phrases that you want me to wear to show on this sub are a lion track I can't put this on shown on your support because soon as I put it on somebody gonna take a picture of me [Applause] your conviction so that stopped you from achieving then you have a conviction right listen Richard stop from the Hebrew boys [Music] 262 notice the very thing when this message or not when they start sewing but when he begins to declare his message see first for healing second full of promise time third quarter open the other words the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word and practice but the only the profit can be vindicated by the word so that's that's the key statement I just believe right right [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] right revelation understand dead first movie love second pole props on third floor the only the word mister was revealed no more there's no no no hi afforded to be given to the Congress but only the only way the profit can be benefit was about work remember the third course of opening of seven series the third and seven seas whoops opening of themselves to reveal the truth that's been stealing the word do you see it it is been in that day when this thing is to take place - Janice of Danvers Brian person makers will appear if you do bring in subjection to the work and we got some we work right all right all right it is then if that favor this thing will take you Lake Jefferson dentist impersonation will appear again just like they did with most of the people the original work to see they exactly [Music] this is it I want you to listen real close Mountain Pose three things remember three things have been fulfilled three things lays before you right now first the world is in a solid condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion our women trying to act like me I'm busy lowdown devil possessed yeah Wow the Bible said that would happen and that's where is that secondly is in there now according to the scripture here that Janus in jamberry some Pierce right [Music] right the genesis of damn experiences come up but they also have somebody trying to keep you between them right oh one last thing that I was she kind of investments remembers three things right the rest of them to walk out could explain it all but he said I'm staying right here and even after you made that statement there is still one more person in the church there I believe is the second brother Raymond Carver said he was it Jesus or today and he called along believing they walked out soon as Jesus preached that sermon that was a lasting super sister they told us you belong and now we see that you really know and I know I mean I know about alright alright alright so those were the leaders religious leaders in that day they were non-believers but it eventually was still in church after that yeah to make a little money all forget Association all the associates so Jesus Judas to make one less for investors there's three things that I always do is grease we know that he's protected in threes remember the days of nor they went ending up and then the days of Sodom Jesus is speaking of these two days of Sodom they went out ceasing and the date of no thing with India and the days of Sodom they went out for some time without him saw this time and they go look you have to either this time yes go in go out go up see that's what we need now we need a going up affair we even going up from these things and one of the things that's got us so bound down I like this Daniel wasn't going to the found ourselves watch he was going to keep that word in the place where did it go through the word what it do is sit down an angel to protect this like he didn't Mars see believers don't get marked with other things in the world no matter what the law I mean if they've changed the law when the Hebrew boys came along playing that music in you right here and you're cooking he said but but if he choose not to we want it to be reaping your books [Music] because the corners are scripted his struggles maybe just they got close to the fire they died right these bearing strong me bones that refused to be defined right come on out get that instant you know what believers do whoa you're working only working speak to us only working challenges all your work and help us just a little thought that you just split my heart to share with the church them to be Mourning the message has been delivered that without bringing the fruit running there's one that was thinking about walking away I'm freaked out too restrictive and curse their hearts they wouldn't do it they would stay with me even something like Mike Peabody could explain what Jesus it just reached no way I might tell everybody everything about it but God I believe hold on to me let us have that type of coach they think failure Jesus we rehash that you would help those that have got me so out of step or let them get themselves back this time the only way they could do is they got to hear the voice and Gus private you said a prophet that Noah state multiple prophecy amen there was a prophet there in live state as Abraham was the prophet of that day you even confessed it you told the king that had Sarah say that when Abraham live say let him pray for you because he is my proxy but every day who had prophets even today you would have a problem help us stay here in the voice [Music] not rejected receive I believe Lord Ofsted in the mystical nurse we're going through lives still endure many trials and many tribulations and distress if I get got will hold to your promises knowing that it's nothing that we did wrong to produce this but old gods it just seems to be coming at us with the trial that he's been allowed to present but even in the midst of trial it brings greatness alamos we're grateful bless us now God is my prayer every heart that has heard the word bless them to get a minister to every needs so Jesus thing then I pray amen amen brother song just close the zone few songs god bless you church let's give the Lord a
