[Applause] [Music] praise the lord amen my god my god can i just get a little bit more uh sound in my monotonous here tonight my brother just um just telling sister rebecca that i just wrote a little list of songs of things that i wanted to do to open the service and one of the songs well actually the song she's playing was the first song on my list uh without me ever telling her that uh that that's what i wanted to sing then i showed her the list and uh the second song that i had on my list was the second song she had on her list uh so the holy spirit is already here amen is already here and and i'm i'm i'm convinced that his word tells us that wherever two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst of him so you know i'd rather have jesus here than have anybody else here i'd rather be in his presence than anybody else's presence so amen i know that he's here and amen let's just enter in tonight as we sing and we get our minds wrapped on easter and what our lord did for us some 2000 years ago when he died on that cross but he didn't stay on the cross he got up out of a grave amen and because he lives we live also amen amen let's sing this with all of our hearts above all powers above all kings above all powers above all kings above all nature and all creative things above all wisdom and all the ways of man oh you were here before the world began above all kingdoms above all thrones above all wonders the world has ever and treasures of the earth lord there's trampled on the ground you took the fall and thought of and lay behind the stone oh [Music] on the ground above all yes above all nature and all created things above all wisdom and all the ways yes above all thrones and above all wonders the world has ever known all above all wealth and treasures of the earth lord there's no way to measure what your word will you were rejected you were like a rose one more time you were hallelujah glory to your name jesus hallelujah you took the fall you thought of us above all gods hallelujah thank you jesus and all the agony all the pain [Music] the nails everything he did that just because of you many did it just because of me and we're grateful for that tonight i'm selfish enough to believe that uh if there was nobody else in the world that was willing to receive what christ did he still would have did it just for me he would have did it just for me god we love you tonight we love you tonight jesus amen let's just open amen by reading a scripture here out of uh psalm 22 just a few verses out of psalm 22. hallelujah [Music] you took the phone you thought of me you took the phone and you thought of me yes you took the phone [Music] psalm 22 verse 1 says my god [Applause] my god why hast thou forsaken me you want to get in your mind here as i was just reading this [Music] that uh it would have been a thursday night like this that they would have put him on the cross because um the way the the way that the days go with the jewish calendar set up to some down uh is considered a day you know the next day starts when the sun down you know occurs i believe uh so uh here it would have been a thursday night thursday evening like this that he would have that he would have been been there so here you just think about that thursday that he was going through carrying that cross and just get just get the whole image in your mind as to what he was doing just for you you were you were on his mind when when he was going through all of that the shame the disgrace uh brother branham said he was stripped naked it was embarrassing but he went through all of that just for us and i don't know who wouldn't want to serve a god like this a god that would leave his throne in glory and come and bring us redemption story who wouldn't want to serve a god like this says my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my god i cry in the day time but thou hearst not in in the night season and and not silent thou art holy oh thou that inhabits the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou dis delivered them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despise with the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted him and remember how they were uh uh just criticizing him say if you know if he's calling for elias he's calling for elijah you know says no no no they didn't know what he was doing on the cross they say but you know if if he's the son of god let him come down now let him do this they were they were just just mocking him but he stayed on that cross for a reason stayed there for a reason he could have come down but he stayed there for a reason amen i'm the reason you're the reason that he stayed there amen he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou art he that took me out of the womb now this make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mother's belly be not far from me for trouble is near for there's none to help the lord had a blessing to the reading his word tonight let us just bow in in a word of prayer father our minds uh just go back tonight on what you did for us uh roughly 2 000 years ago but we know god before the foundational world you were this the lamb that was already slain and you just came here to earth or to act it all out and lord as we just get in our mind that that thursday evening and all standing before pilate and being falsely accused and lord all the things that occurred on that day and god the sun going down in darkness uh lord and just so much happening uh that our lord and savior was was placed on a cross my satan thought it was done he thought he had he got him he thought it was all over uh but all it was really just beginning and father we thank you that we're part of this story lord we pray tonight as we become and lord don't let it just be just another service god but let us really get you in our hearts and in our minds and lord and may you just speak to us tonight and draw our hearts closer to your father the bible tells us if we draw nigh to you then you would draw nigh to us so god we pray that you do just that tonight take control over the service have thy no way god in in this place and

deliverance to those that need deliverance bring salvation to those that need salvation uh bring the holy ghost to those that are looking for a feeling of the holy ghost god whatever the needs of the people are we ask that you will meet the need according to your riches in glory it's in jesus name we pray amen can we give them another handclap of praise mercy rewrote my life so glad that mercy yes it did re-ruin my you life i should have fallen my soul cast down but thank god mercy yes it is we say mercy yes it rewrote my life oh thank you lord i know your mercy yes it rewrote my life

little further here tonight um i just wanted to mention to the church that um we had our terry service on uh tuesday night and uh it was our first time that we ever came together to do um anything like that just trying to do things the way that the scripture tells us the way that the prophet taught us and um you know when we came here um i'm just happy to report that the lord met us amen the lord met us in a very very special way man there was there was tongues and interpretations uh that went forth and you know i i i we weren't i'll say i wasn't even prepared uh for what the lord was doing and you know i realized uh later on in the you know in the service that what i have to do is record what god gives us and uh you know and just try to take that and just try to uh keep that before the church but one one one of the things that we heard uh is that the the spirit of the lord is here and he just wants us to yield to him uh he really he wants us to yield to him and and uh you know and all these he says i'm here i'm here i just want you just just just yield to me let go and just yield to me and uh and then another thing that we we heard from the lord is that uh um there is a spirit of liberty freedom uh that is that is here and we're expecting this weekend somebody to go free right we're expecting that i mean every mine battle is broken right we heard that that it was it's broken and and that the holy spirit is here you know to to to to set the caps free so uh uh we're encouraged and uh we're just just so so appreciative of god just meeting us here just getting quiet before the lord and and just just watching him just come in amen he just he just came in so uh we're i'm coming with an expectation uh as we start this weekend off i'm coming with an expectation just believing god to do the impossible if the the sick can be healed uh you know you can be whatever it is the the bound can be set free and i i'm taking the limits off of god uh i just believe god

amen amen there was a time where we had nobody but me right and then you know over the years god has given us a few here and there and you know and it's just been good just to help out uh and then as you know uh you know the years get go on and i remember brother anderson praying a prayer he says lord i need help and i say i'm gonna pray that same prayer i say lord i need help and god sent some help he raised up some help and sent some help here and we're grateful for all these gifts that god has given us and amen i'm happy that each one has an opportunity to speak this weekend i'm so happy

minister for us i'm going to have him preach on a friday night as well as on a sunday morning we'll have brother solomon hoffman ministering for us and um i did i don't have this on the calendar but it is in my heart i want us to be able to do a church picnic in the next couple months if we can get a facility to be able to do it at uh but i would love to to do that and if there's anybody that would like to kind of work on a committee to make that happen uh just make sure you see me or text me or something let me know but we want to try to get something i told y'all we're going to be intentional about fellowship and uh you know and i'm looking forward to that so we want to try to get something i was thinking about the month of may but i understand there's a lot of things already on people's schedules so we might have to push it to june but uh but let's we'll get something uh on the schedule and get it out there for you so you'll know all about it amen praise the lord our giving uh everyone here in the sanctuary has the opportunity to give we have a wooden box on the table there that you can put your your offering or tithing in those that are joining us online you have two way three ways actually that you can give one is you could use paypal and uh that just choose the option of donate to a friend or family member or you can do uh uh and make sure you send it send

happy hill road suite 109 west palm beach florida 33417 recently i had a a couple people um some saints that i i can't say that that i know them personally i saw some names that i guess people are tuning in and they send an offering and love offerings to church and we just want to say thank you you know we we really we appreciate it we really appreciate it sometimes the saints don't see what happens behind the scenes but you know you pick up your phone and an email comes in and say somebody just said something like what who is that lord you know the lord knows who they are and uh and i believe god will bless them for blessing us amen their offerings is what keep the lights on amen hallelujah let us let us feel comfortable with the ac running you know a few few a few weeks ago we walked in here on the wednesday night and the ac was out gone gone so we had to call a company to come out and fix it and and um you know and and and the guy came out said y'all need a whole new there's a compressor yeah y'all need a whole new compressor we're like oh lord so how much is that gonna be he's like well um we happen to have one at our shop that we use so it's a used one y'all can get that one and if y'all have problems just call us up let us know okay we'll take it and you know they it was a tremendous saving i think cost us 900 rather than about 1800 but the good thing about is that i was able to just sit down and sign a check [Music] and not not be like uh you know didn't have to come and ask for a special offer from the church the money was already there that's what god has been doing right hallelujah church amen and that happens because of the saints that give and give freely from the heart we just we really appreciate it the lord bless you amen so let's pray over our giving tonight and then um we'll move on into service father i thank you for the opportunity we have to give as you have given to us may you use this for the furnace of your kingdom here on earth god we thank you for each and every one that does lord just take of their their resources and they contribute to this ministry those here present those that join us online we're grateful for each and every one we pray god that you would bless and return the the blessing a hundredfold to him oh god may they all realize you can never beat god's given no matter how hard you try so i trust o god that you would just get glory even in our giving it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen praise the lord so um tonight we uh i guess the well yeah we we have uh our precious brother troy and our deacon here at spirit and truth tabernacle and um and he's a deacon uh could i put it this way a deacon for real i'm gonna put it like that can i for real uh early this week he gave me a call and and um he was telling me that um sister wayson they she had her procedure and and they needed to get her up the stairs and and um in a wheelchair get her back to her place and he called me and i was trying to get some things navigated and worked out and and uh and i think he finally got a hold of brother caleb and brother caleb say i'll meet you there i'll meet you there we went over and and they got sister wasting up the stairs and into you know her apartment and and i i was thinking i'd say brother that's that's a deacon there right the pastor don't have to be trying you know to find this one to find that one deacon just taking taking control of it right um you know i appreciate that um you know he had a another situation where a friend of his needed uh some work done on a car and uh the friends uh mechanic just didn't show up you know and they couldn't get through to him and all that so brother troy made a phone call to brother frankie and brother frankie say i'll be there you know and brother frankie come and and diagnosed the issue and and uh and it just ministered to the man that that that that the body was connected enough amen to be able to minister to his knees so you know again brother troy just behind the scenes just handling that and and i just appreciate him and you know when we when we asked him uh to pray about you know the deacon and everything one of the things that we uh we told him that we want to do is exactly what the prophet said he said a deacon should be apt to teach that's what the prophet said and he put it in in in the church bylaws of of uh branham tabernacle i said well we want to set our bylaws up the same way and and brother troy has stepped into that role and has done it with excellence and and i just appreciate him so tonight he'll be coming and just sharing what the lord has placed on his heart and i believe we're gonna hear from heaven amen i believe we're gonna hear from heaven so let's stand to our feet and let's welcome our

something he be like he been preaching since he was born but uh you know i i i i i didn't i've always kind of pushed off elbowed off i said look man i support you i support you amen but when when when god calls hey man you you all you just uh you got to step into the game hey man we sit there on the on the bench and you and one thing about it is you're sitting on the sideline but you got to be ready all right that's the key you got to be always ready when your number is called up right hey man you may have an owner on a football team or whatever you may have a have a main quarterback and then you may have another quarterback something here over there with attitude sitting over talking about well why don't i get to play why don't i get to play and all of a sudden his number is called he can't find his helmet he ain't ready so you got to just stay ready amen and in order to stay ready you got to stay engaged amen you got to stay prayed up amen you got to stay focused on what's going on amen i'm excited about because see uh i was teasing uh brother quaker a couple of weeks ago i say brother quaker i tell you what you was right there miss i've been studying this message for a few weeks now the lord just been laying this thing on my heart and me taking me to certain scriptures and certain quotes and i just been listening to certain messages and everything and here you come you get right in there i say man i said the lord told me said well y'all just fishing in the same pond right and then the next week brother willie come back and he all i say oh lord what am i going to preach brother willie all in my message and everything so i went and i t by the will i say brother willie for the quaker and i was fishing the same pond but you just taking fish out my bucket you just taking fish right out of my bucket so i was home and i was meditating now i was in my study and the lord said it's the same two fish it's the same two fish we feeding the people with so we believe the lord is here tonight amen to continue to feed the multitude amen by different ministers that's taking it out feeding the people with the same two fish amen amen amen amen do i believe we're really under expectation amen the lord has really shown himself mighty among us i tell you what man oh man oh man i i i don't i'mma leave that to the pastor to get into but we had a time brother i mean lord have mercy the supernatural power of god if you were ever ever excited about a time now is the time don't get slapped now you're about to see some things happen that will blow your mind my mind is already blown my mind is already blown if we can just keep the devil out see we have to now just keep the devil out and the way we keep the devil out is we get closer together amen we get closer together brother willie was talking about the oneness in the seven junction see we eating on the same two fish now the one that's in the seven junction amen and today i want to come and talk to you about the grace of god all right but see we always talk about the grace of god when when when brother jack came to me and he said uh uh do you have a message your house up i said yeah well i got something on my heart and i've been working on everything does it pertain to uh uh easter and i say well i thought about it i said well well yeah yeah it can pertain to easter i throw the cross in there i thought across it now but you know i was having some work done to him at my house and and and and uh they put in the shower and and and the guy putting in the shower pin and he got the drain there in the middle amen and he putting the shower pan in and i'm watching him as he do this and he got to slope everything towards the pan he got the slope the left side towards the pan he got a slope the right side towards the center of the drain he got a sloping from the back he got a sloping from the front so that all the water go down the drain see calvary's in the drain that's where when scenes of water was washed away amen and i would say they had having the water goes down the drain so from the old testament to the new testament amen it all goes back to calvary if you preach a message and you can't take it back to calvary you need to check what you're preaching if you can't put calvary in there and find grace in the blood of jesus christ and what you're preaching you need to check it a little bit more because it all flows right back to count amen and it has to be pitched perfectly because if it's not pitched perfectly i had to go back and i tested i said i wait till everything get dry and i went and i turned the water on and me and my wife standing there and we looking is it draining i said yes baby it's draining everything is going everything is going ain't no puddling nowhere where the water's getting cold because see if you get to a place where the water can't go what you got to do you got to hone it down a little bit more hey man you got to hold down your revelation because see something is wrong you're starting to puddle amen and you'll never make it to the drain [Music] oh my i tell you what i'm preaching a message of grace let us stand to our feet amen glory glory hallelujah amen this little uh scripture we're going to go to isaiah 53 isaiah 53 we're going to read from there then you can have your seat i have some other scriptures isaiah 53 jeremiah 31 uh micah 7. but i want to just read this one here and then you can have your seat hey man try not to be before you too long i know it's a thursday night everybody worked today and would like to go home and get some rest i had the day off and i got tomorrow off so i ain't in no hurry but i'm thinking about you amen isaiah 53 starting at verse one it says who hath believed our report and to whom the arm of the lord is revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he has no form no calmliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him now listen he is despised now this is isaiah saying this he is despised and rejected is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him my god he was despised and was us and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted you may be seated you may be seated now everybody go to verse 5 because he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by every stripes we heal but i want you to really take a good look at all of that scripture what all that stuff he took to the cross with him amen our griefs our sorrows amen our oppressions everything that we go through he came down clothed himself in humanity he took our sickness he took our pain he took all of that amen he took our grief he took our sorrows he took our oppression the depression people walk away from god because see that you got to understand the tricks of the enemy you got to understand the tricks of the enemy god took all of that all you have to do is have faith and believe now listen isaiah spoke this long before the cross have existed but see i'm going to take you somewhere we will be we've been we've been in us we've been in a cycle brother jack came out and he started preaching about the junctions of time amen brother willie just got right under the same anointing we started preaching about the junctions of time amen brother paul came he started talking about that clock he started talking about the wrist watch but i'm here to let you know tonight amen that what we're going to and what we come from is back to eternity amen right now we're in these junctions we're in a junction of time let me read something from the message perfection amen preached in 1956 06 10 27 all right you catch up with me when you can sister now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space amen time came because of sin amen that threw us into these junctions amen but we are not time creatures amen we are creatures of eternity that's why we this time thing just don't work for us i'm not mad at you sometime when all the time the clock go off this that nothing you know what cause we are not creatures of time we have to learn how to overcome you know time is a prison time is a prison we are imprisoned by time amen now sometimes some people are in prison and some people are in solitary confinement that's a prison in a prison all right now talk about it a prison and a prison not only are they in a time prison but then they're in another prison because they don't know who they are when you get into solitary confinement you lose your mind amen you begin to get so isolated amen from other people that your but mind begin to play tricks on you don't know who you are anymore amen but by the grace of god he came and took us out of solitary confinement amen we in general population amen ready to walk out the gates at any time [Music] out of time see when they give you when they give you punishment and put you in prison they give you time they give you time you got a certain amount of time you are imprisoned by the time but you are free you are free in christ jesus you are creatures of eternity you were born to be free you were born to sow like eagles amen amen amen now he says here he say the uh uh let us see this perfect circle he called it a perfect circle forever and ever and then all once sin drop and put a little he says his wife call it a little hickey just this little this little hickey here amen and in that little hickey is seven junctions amen but see he had to do that amen so that he can display his attributes [Music] he had to put us in that prison so he could come and be our lawyer he had to put us in that prison so he can be our advocate because unless we was in their prison amen we never have known the grace of god we would never know just how good he is the prophet said and who is this melchizedek we bypassed our people amen to come here amen in a flesh body amen to be tried and tested what's undetached by brothers and sisters our faith is on the test our faith is being tried and tested but by the revelation of almighty god if we can ever see a man into the unseen realm not looking with the natural eyes but look through the word of god amen we will see amen that god has already taken us into eternity amen bear with me amen amen he says here now time now is a little loop it loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and came through here in order to sink start in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with god again for all eternity you see it right that's all time is then god amen god when it started here at the end of the little king in the perfect circle that made it a little king when god started here he was perfected everything he said was perfect everything he does is perfect so then the bible said that jesus christ the lamb was slain from the beginning of the little kink slain from the beginning of the little king so amen if if if he carried my sorrows to the cross he carried them before the king all right all right they were all see listen in the brother willie hit this thing i was telling him lord you're taking the fish out my butt in the mind of god you are already perfect that's right you were perfectly whole you were made whole there was no sin the the the the god has a sea of forgetfulness now when i was beginning to study this message i wanted to say now how can a god who's all perfect know all things forget good question how can he forget and the prophet began to explain the thing he said man can't forget but god he can forget he can forget because see what happened you know he took our sorrows i just read it here he took those things and he carried them to the cross and took them to hell and the bible says in revelation i believe it's revelation 20 i got it written here revelation 20 verse 5 that death and hell are be cast into the lake of fire amen and if you go back and read the scripture he said it would burn would find brimstone forever and ever that's not eternity it will have an end and when it's in amen it'll be from the memory of god so my sorrows your sorrows he carried the hell hell will be thrown into the lake of fire my transgressions your transgressions my wrongs your wrongs my faults your faults are be thrown in to the lake of the fire with the devil and his false prophets amen and to be gone annihilated god don't see it you've never done it it don't exist we're freeing him this week so what happened you got these memories the devil tried to bring these things up try to bring these things up but you were all ready already free amen because he was a lamb slain amen before the foundation of the world he carried your sorrows carried your grace amen your disappointments all of those things now that's something you have to do absolutely that's something you have to do the prophet was talking about here i believe in uh what message here message perfection oh lord god he says paragraph 46 now before he ever put the printed word this is the mind of god here it is talking about the word this is the mind of god that he thought before the foundation of the world and the world was before the world was ever laid it is that's the reason amen that's the reason he could put it on printed word and say that would be because he saw it before the foundation of the world and knew just what it would be and spoke it out and then he handed it down his knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it out and year by year and century by century we see it come to pass just exactly god giving a shadow of the old and a shadow of the new the drain on one side and the drain on the other side and we see it word by word amen being fulfilled with a faith we ought to have established in god with what a faith amen that we ought to have established in god amen now we see a man that in order in order look look in order to have faith true faith in god a lot of people can say you have faith i have faith we believe we have faith but unless you have a revelation unless you know listen the the the the woman with the issue of blood amen she had faith the bible said she had faith he said your faith made you whole but she saw duke jesus was coming she had spent all her money she had she had exhausted all of her resources she hadn't she had a problem she had a problem that the doctors couldn't solve she had a problem amen that the lawyer could solve all right and she heard that jesus was passing amen now no doubt weak in a body right sick from a loss of blood you lose blood you get weak little frail lady but she pressed her way out oh man to be in the presence of god she said if i can just i don't have to get his attention i just need to be in the presence now i hope y'all reading between the lines if i don't even have to get i just if i could just be in and get close enough so she had to fight her way amen through a crowd of people that's it she had to oh and the message in the message i got it right here in the message uh desperation yeah the prophet said you have to press into it you can't sit back and be slow for you can't sit back and be nonchalant amen he wants to give it to you he wants to give you everything that you stand in need of he wants to bless you beyond measure but he has to see a man that you really wanted he has to see some desperation out of you amen this woman with the issue with blood because she had the desperation and she pressed her way through the crowd she see that she couldn't get no closer to him amen no doubt there was big men amen bodyguarding trying to keep people away from him and protecting him and the people pressing just trying to touch him all the people touching him she said i just got to get down on my knees she get down on her knees and she just reached and touched the hem of his government and he said virtue left me he said strength left from my body why because it wasn't a physical touch it was a faith touch and see if your faith can touch listen we are given five senses and in these five senses he's given them to us to contact in this dimension of time yes see touch taste feel here hey man and we we have we have learned to rely on these five senses we have learned to rely on these five senses now we we we we we need them here i couldn't i couldn't read without it amen thank god for it thank god for giving us these five senses but i can't throw away the six amen i can't throw away a six amen if i was blind and couldn't see out of my natural eyes i would have to rely on somebody to lead me i would have to have faith that they are going to lead me into the right place amen at the right time you see but we are some we we hear amen so we we we have these eyes a man so but but but we can't see we have to be able to look into the unseen yeah we have to be able to look amen into the mind of god amen because see the i'm i'll give you listen here i call brother josue a few weeks ago and i he he had hurt his back i just called i just called to check on your brother see how you doing he said listen now he said my back is hurting but my back is a lie he said i feel pain in my back but the pain is a lie amen because the word of god is more real than the pain that i'm feeling i almost break i'm driving in the car whoa lord have mercy what hallelujah the word of god is more real to me than the pain that i'm feeling thank you lord that's the place we have to get to my brothers and sisters that's the place we have to get to and i'm talking about the scene and about the grace of god it was the grace of god amen that that that that saw you amen in his mind and a slam slain before you ever existed now the bible says that faith is the substance and he said the prophet brought out that we live on that substance before the foundation of the world before this world was ever created before there was dirt before there were trees before there was anything before there was even a molecule amen now our bodies are derived of 16 elements but before those 16 elements came to be a man that he formed your body out of the lamb was already slain amen and faith amen already is the substance amen before there was a substance there was faith and it was the substance amen that brought this all into reality so faith in order to have faith you have to have you have to be able to go into the mind of christ amen you have to be able to see yourself as he sees you as he see you because see this time thing amen is just a testing ground we we are walking through amen we must walk by faith now in order to walk a walking is a reference a man of fellowship amen it is a reference to fellowship amen because how can two walk together except there unless they agree amen so when when he talks about walking it's about fellowshipping with god on the roads and man that two men walk and jesus came and walked with them they were fellowshipping amen enoch walked amen and as he was walking he began to talk with god amen and he began to be revealed so much of who god was and who he was his faith transferred him to another dimension his faith got so high until it just transferred him to another dimension and i got the quote here prophet said that's what's happening right now we are being transferred we our faith is being anointed our faith has taken us elevating us into another dimension even as we speak why because our thinking has changed we are not creatures of time we are not creatures of this world we are not earthly creep we're not earthly bound amen we are eagles soul among the heavens amen now we come down amen because we have to come go to work just like that eagle do that eagle come down now he could come down the hunt he come now get his food and then he gets right back up there in the heavenlies amen now we're talking about grace he shows such love and perfection amen that he would come now amen uh uh that he would that he would that he would make such preparation praise god for you and i amen before the world even began amen and he came and he laid everything out and he pitched the pan just perfect yes sir with you in his mind all along he's with pitch the pan and he said i can't have any lobs in it i i got to have it just perfect so this person won't be lost they won't get caught in the puddle amen not to get caught in the portal but they'll make it all the way to calvary amen amen make it all the way to calvary and leave all of your sorrows there amen the mind of god let me read a couple of quotes here amen to bring you along the prophet said amen he became the poorest amen from the most from the from the richest to the poorest from the most blessed to the most horrible suffering and then besides that we went down into the lower steps of hell bearing our sins and got to the end of the stream and he in and the end of the rope from the kink there lifted it up in the resurrection and connected it with the other part of eternity and made a highway of holiness that the unclean can come and be cleansed through the fountain through the blood drawn from emmanuel's vein where sinners plunged released the flood lose all the guilty stains he said come on to the highway and someday he who was at the beginning of time shall stand at the ancient of time and will pull the great gospel cord and all that was on that highway from the beginning of time to the ancient of time to the end of time shall be lifted up as he draws time out of existence as he draws time out of existence into an eternity you see it there it is the only true potentate the king of kings the lord of lords how did he do it by foreknowledge that he was the lamb slain then if he was 4 000 years later it come into time run out he was born they done to him they what he said they he they done to him what he said they would do 4 000 years later and then he was crucified and slain but correctly he was slain before the world began the for god for god foreshadowed him and said that he would take place and when god speak it has to be you get it oh my god foreshadow christ and it was to be that that's why it was already finished when god said the word that finished it there is a re there is the reason he was actually prefigured slain when god spoke the word before the world before the world notice now not only christ was slain to take away our sins but your name was written in the book of life before the world god wrote your name associated with his before the foundation of the world amen amen do you believe it amen amen no wonder sickness peril death nothing can separate us from the love of god this is christ because the foundation of the world he put us on a great old highway climbed up the horizontal rainbow went into the pinnacle of the beginning of time again hold the rope in his hand and someday say come on up we which are alive and remain to the come of the lord shall shall not prevent them which are died in the highway because the trump of god shall sound amen and sound and the dead in christ shall rise and shall be caught up together to meet him and meet him as the chain is lifted back into the cycle of eternity and then the ages roll on and his praises will sing when this mortal ding there that's here in the earth this mortal ding that's here in the earth we shall be separated from it it'll be cast to the outside of the chain of eternity it'll be cast to the outside of the chain of eternity it'll be on the outside of the gulf which no man can cross over cross or ever did ever will and when this link down here was lifted up was lifted to that part that's the paved holy highway that god has in the beginning where there was nothing to defile there is nothing to destroy sin caused the loop and when the loop continued right down through here and bring out the delegates and and when she is pulled up together to meet each end eternity rolls on and that's the redeem shall walk in you get it that's when the redeemed shall walk in amen now we we we we i was i was looking at this amen and uh i began to think on the song amen amazing grace yes and uh uh uh the the the the the word amen amazing as you think on the grace of god amen you know as i think on the grace of god it was okay that he i i i i appreciate that he woke me up this morning amen i appreciate that he gave me food to eat that's that's definitely the grace of god amen i appreciate that i got close to wearing a roof over my head that is definitely the grace of god amen i appreciate you know that i got a car to drive and i got a job to go through and all of those kind of things that is definitely the grace of god amen but when you when you really think about that the amazing grace of god the amazing grace of god is when he come down amen and he took all my sorrows amen when a perfect god amen that come down and he bore all of my sins and transgressions amen and when a perfect god came down amen and he took all of my sins washed them in his blood amen and washed them in the drain of forgetfulness amen that's the perfect god what an amazing grace grace is amazing i began to think about that amazing i say who would have thought of that uh uh word to put in front of the grace to describe how great it is i looked up the word amazing and it gave some different meanings and you could have said awesome grace it could have said he had a a a a wonderful grace it said wonderful it said awesome it said uh stupendous it said miraculous all right and then at the end it said unbelievable so my mind went to paradox unbelievable but true it was unbelievable but it's true so i went to the message paradox and in the message paradox he said they were baptized repented baptized and they come out to walk in a new life and a new land in a newness of journey among the people in the hand of god was upon them but finally they come to a place in this walk talking about the children of israel let me just add that and they said they were not satisfied with their walk of grace and they had to come to uh come to something that they could do themselves see that's our problem that's our problem now we're gonna get somewhere with that we always looking that we have to do why because we got these little crazy dollar mission we think we smart all right because we got a mind and we gotta we we can see and we can we can we can we can we can we can dissect we can navigate we can reason you know we can do all of these kind of thing so you know so we thinking what is something you got to do same mistake the children of israel made all right he said now uh uh that's where people think today of divine healing or something any other works of grace of god that there is something that that you have to do but there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe god and they if they would have continued on this promise wasn't given to them under the law the promise was given before the law without any conditions to it i have given you this land go on over into it but before they got to the promised land they decided that there was something they must do themselves and that's where we still find that among human beings we're prone to be the same way to be that way there is something that we've got to do amen we feel that we have got to have something into it also you do have you do have something into it right that's your surrender of your will your own ideas the will and idea of to the will and idea of almighty god and it's finished that's that's all there just take his promise don't think of nothing else whereby it and god does the rest of it and god does the rest of it now we we we we we we have to my brothers and sisters get our thinking i was i was i was so excited about this thing and uh i was going through the drive through to get something to eat and i told a young man at the drive-thru and said brother we got the elevator i think i ain't had nobody preached too so i figured i'd preach to the man at the drive to i said brother we got to elevate i think and he said back to me amen he said i was just telling this dude right now we got to think higher i say well i'm glad i said you're right he said we're just telling them in here man we got to think higher we got to start figuring out we got to stop thinking better man we better than this we got to start doing that say man you got to think outside of this you got to think outside of these 16 elements you got to think you you could see your mind has been so conditioned amen to this to like the chickens eating whatever they give you but the bible say man should not live by by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen and without a revelation without a true revelation amen what are you feeding on in order for healing to take place sometime if there's a wound my wife is a woman she's a wound care expert and if the wound is to a place where the vessels and things are cauterizing you have to scrape away the dead tissue see so sometimes when you come to church god gotta scrape away the dead tissue gotta scrape away the dead tissue she say it has to do that until you can get fresh blood it has to do that's till you get fresh blood and then what they do is they have to put it together and from there god does the work see but you have to be willing to sit there and they and and and they scrape and it's painful and it hurt but once we get fresh blood healing can take place oh man healing can't take place until you scrape off the old dead tissue the old dead beliefs in your mind we have to get to the fresh bleeding blood of the word i'm not talking about that stagnant stuff amen those old beliefs those old ideas amen that you don't have a revelation of what they mean anyway but i'm talking about the bleeding fresh blooded word of god amen so that the healing can take place i'm not just talking about healing of your body i'm talking about the healing of the body of god amen amen hallelujah let me read something in the message desperation he said i believe the reason that we don't have desperation is because of a lack of love amen because of a lack of love of a lack of love god love but like god the love of god i think that the love of god causes desperation if god is in you the token inside of you will and they're talking inside of you and you see the conditions of the time and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation he said i believe it will now the world plainly states if you want to put this down and go the word i'm sorry the word plainly states if you want to put this down he says in galatians 5 6 that faith worketh by love faith worketh by love the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is love's incentive amen and center that's exactly what faith is it is the incentive to love now you if you don't have love you can't have faith if you don't have love you can't have faith how can you have faith he gave him he's given an example here about you well how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's the feeling uh now how about in the agape to god how can it be if you don't love god if you said you love your wife and you never tell her and you never sat down and and made love to her express it to her kiss her and hug her and tell her that she's the best cook in the country all the things uh that you know and you uh she's pretty she's this and how you how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you don't do if you don't love her if you don't express it amen that's the way that's the that's that's the way we do to god when we love him we tell him about it we sit down and we adore him we worship him and see love drives us to that now what if something has got to be done for your wife why it throws you into desperation to get it done why if somebody says i'm gonna hear this later if somebody says your wife got cancer and if somebody says your wife got tb and she is fixing to die and you'll do anything see it'll throw you into desperation amen i'm a witness and that's the same thing that it is we must have love before we can have faith and faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith to the battlefront now i'm gonna skip down here and i'm gonna read something amen you get the gist there down here on uh paragraph uh 76 notice the bible said here also in james 16 5 16 if we confess our faults get if getting right making ready for it confess our faults one to another having no faults ask people to pray for you confess your faults one to another praying one for the other there you are when love with love love that i got confidence i can confess to you my wrong and you can confess to me you're wrong and i love you well enough that i will pray for you and you pray for me and we will and will stay with it with the effectual fervent prayer until it's answered that's desperation that's what we should have all the time amen that's what we should have all the time and you know what that is that is amazing grace unbelievable but true how can a people have love like that one for another it's unbelievable but true and i went on and i began to think about the song now amazing grace and the songwriter said how sweet the sound what does grace sound like i say what does grace sound like that is so sweet you want to know the sweetness that grace sound like when i walk into the sanctuary and i hear the songs of joy and when i hear the people are really into it in the worship you hear the worship and the people adoring god amazing grace how sweet the sound amen the word of god that proceedeth out of the mouth of the minister amen that ministers to my soul amen this is a sweet sound to my ears amazing grace how sweet the sound amen that saved a wretch like me it says i once was lost but now i'm fine i was blind but now i see i was blind with good eyes blind with good eyes amen because we're not talking about being able to see amen in this dispensation we're not talking about being able to see in this prison of dispensation of time we're talking about being able to look beyond the veil we're talking about being able to look into the unseen and seeing what god has already done for you because see what you see in the mind of god amen that he had already thought the thoughts of you amen thoughts of perfection amen thoughts that you were already healed amen i remember not too long ago amen when joe underwood was here and he was talking about how god blessed him and giving the testimony about the little baby and everything excuse me and i think i went home and i shared with my wife and i said the lord was just dealing with me while he was giving a testimony see see see he he different people told him to do different things to see the baby was already coming right and he gave the testimony that he came into the prayer line and he had to walk he was ready to go back to his seat here and he had to walk all the way through see but it was deeper than that that first of all is obedience not offending the lord amen but see the the the the the baby was already coming he just didn't know it but if you could see faith already saw that the baby was coming all he had to do was continue to believe and keep walking walk into the manifestation he had to just keep walking walk into the manifestation of it when you believe amen when you have faith that it's already done amen that god has always already done it before the foundation of the world he already saw me whole amen before the foundation of the world he already saw me perfect and man whatever situation he already took my sorrows in greece i don't care if i'm going through a divorce i don't care whatever the case may be you go take that thing to god amen he carried all of your sorrows amen if you got children that's backslid children that's going away with it willie was given the thing about he said he said uh uh when we was coming up we were that little perfect little family my wife always dressed us up like little baby dolls amen put us on the same thing and everything and got us all looking like look at them look like the little fan family and we come in and then he said he said that yeah but they grow up we still the fan family brother will it amen because in the mind of god he saw it was perfect amen and you know what's beautiful about it the mind of god is coming back and connecting to the body and when the mind of god comes back and connects to the body what happened your thinking is elevated amen your thinking is elevated back to the beginning amen out of these junctions of time out of what these eyes can see but we start looking through the eyes of faith amen of perfect faith amen unto the mind of god amen and we start seeing ourselves as he see us we see each other as god sees about the person amen he talked about how amen if you offend the least of them amen it's better that you take a meal stone and care and throw yourself in the lake amen but there must be some people amen that'll make eternal life just for being good to the bride you know what they did they found grace they found grace let me read this quote see if i can find it i can quote it but i can find it he said in the message he said in the message show us the father it would suffice he said there's four ways that to take you into the presence of the god he said man has always longed to see god now i just said we have to see him by faith but man has always longed to see god there's four ways you can see god amen in his universe amen you can see god in the universe you see god in nature you can see god in nature you see god in his word you see god in his word and you see god in his people that's right that's right that's right you see god in his people look to the left of you look to the right of you and say hello mr and mrs grace because grace is sitting right next to you the grace of god is sitting right next to you you are the grace of god understand that the way god sees you the same way he see your brother and sister that's how we can have love that's how we can how to love when that one come in and confess they false amen and we pray each other through amen the devil will come but if we can bind that much closer together in love amen we'll keep the devil out see what happened he says that the sins will be cast into the sea of forgetfulness i believe it's in micah he said to the he said that uh uh uh michael the seventh seventh chapter eighteenth verse cast all of our sins into the lake of fire and remember them no more see memory the devil defeats you a lot of times with your memory now see your memory he says that when he said that god can forget but man can't forget we can't forget we have a memory and what does that memory do create mind battles and that's where the memory comes from your mind satan is always in your mind bringing back the memories bringing what what you used to be talking about you did this and you did that but see what i did was i stood in the shower amen and i was washed clean by the blood amen and all of those faults all of those sins washed down the drain at calvary amen and i stand perfect before you i know you don't understand it but you're not looking through the eyes that i'm looking through amen because of the perfect before the foundation of the world i was perfect in the mind of god amen and the mind of god has come back and connect with the body amen and i made whole amen because we're back where we come to back to eternity again amen [Applause] we're in a junction of time we're in the seventh junction but let's not get stuck in the junctions of time time is a prison let's elevate our thinking elevate our faith beyond the junctions of time amen we are eternal creatures of god amen we were never made to live in time amen but we come to be tried our faith try shall we walk by faith amen which is contacts the other dimension amen over into eternity amen where everything was perfect in the mind of god see the headstone is coming back and connecting with the body connecting with the body to do what turn our hearts back the prophet came we turn on turn our hearts back to give us a revelation of who we are to give us a revelation of of of of who he is and who we are and where we're at in christ jesus amen so that we can
