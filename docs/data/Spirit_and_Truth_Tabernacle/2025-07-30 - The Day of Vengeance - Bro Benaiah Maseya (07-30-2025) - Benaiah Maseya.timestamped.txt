[2:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We bend in the house of the Lord.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we just bow our heads and
[2:20] just commit this to the Lord? Amen.
[2:24] Heavenly Father, dear Lord God,
[2:28] I approach that throne of mercy, Father,
[2:30] this evening, thanking me Lord for your
[2:33] loving kindness, amazing grace, how
[2:36] sweet it sounds.
[2:38] It saved a wretch such as I. And I can
[2:42] sing a song that angels know nothing
[2:44] about. It's because of that amazing
[2:46] grace. Father, you've given us this
[2:49] opportunity to be here gathered
[2:51] according to your will and your purpose.
[2:54] I pray, Father, that you can meet with
[2:56] us in a special way like no other.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Giving you all the glory and all the
[3:01] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:03] Christ.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated for a second.
[3:12] Amen. Um, I just want to say thank you,
[3:15] brother Jack, for this wonderful honor.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. To stand before the purchase of
[3:21] his blood. I don't take this lightly.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Come here.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um, my name is Brother Banaya.
[3:29] Some of you may know me, some may not,
[3:31] but um, I'm here with my wife and my
[3:34] family.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just came for the meetings and
[3:38] uh before we went back uh brother Jack
[3:40] just said
[3:42] &gt;&gt; uh you know
[3:43] &gt;&gt; can you take a service for us and you
[3:46] feel like saying no but
[3:50] &gt;&gt; it's one of those things that you know
[3:51] you can't run away from.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray that you know you may just
[3:56] keep me in your prayers.
[3:58] Amen. It's it's a tremendous honor to
[4:00] stand behind this sacred desk and to be
[4:03] given the confidence by the pastor is
[4:05] not a light thing.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um
[4:09] without uh wasting too much of your
[4:11] time, we can get straight into the word.
[4:13] Amen.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; I just want to ask if they received the
[4:16] email that I sent with. Okay. God bless
[4:20] you. Um may we rise to our feet as we
[4:24] just um
[4:26] read the word.
[4:28] If we can open our Bibles to um Isaiah
[4:31] chapter 61.
[4:37] Amen. Um verse one, the Bible says, "The
[4:42] spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[4:46] because the Lord had anointed me to
[4:48] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[4:52] had sent me to bind up the
[4:53] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
[4:56] the captives, and the opening of the
[4:59] prison to them that abound,
[5:01] &gt;&gt; to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[5:04] Lord, and the day of vengeance unto our
[5:07] God.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; To comfort all that mourn.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And opening again to Hebrews
[5:14] 10:30, the Bible says, "For we know him
[5:18] that hath said, vengeance belongth unto
[5:22] me,
[5:23] I will recompense, say the Lord, and
[5:26] again the Lord shall judge his people."
[5:29] Let us close our eyes again as we commit
[5:32] this reading to the Lord. Amen.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we have opened the
[5:37] word. Any able-bodied person can do the
[5:40] same, but only you can interpret what's
[5:43] written therein. Father, I pray that
[5:46] Lord, you may bring an interpretation to
[5:49] this word.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Father, I'm unable, but you are able.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; I'm unworthy, but you are worthy.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Father, I cannot say anything to satisfy
[6:00] the hearts of your people, but I know
[6:01] that just one word from you can satisfy
[6:05] the hearings.
[6:07] Father, projecting the cross and the
[6:10] cross alone,
[6:11] hiding myself behind that cross that
[6:13] only Christ can be seen before the
[6:15] people,
[6:17] &gt;&gt; giving you all the glory and all the
[6:18] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:20] Christ. Needing you now more than ever,
[6:22] I pray believing. Amen and amen.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Um I just want to take a
[6:29] subject which is um the day of
[6:33] vengeance.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you may take your seats. Amen.
[6:36] It's the day of vengeance. I spoke on
[6:40] this subject um probably about a month
[6:43] ago back uh when I was in England, but I
[6:46] thought maybe uh it's something that I
[6:49] can bring tonight.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; And and I hope that um God will help me
[6:55] deliver this in the way that is desired.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be in the house
[6:59] of the Lord?
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be in his
[7:02] presence?
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:05] You know, the prophet teaches us that we
[7:07] come to church under expectation,
[7:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[7:10] &gt;&gt; That God will meet with us,
[7:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Can I see who's under expectation
[7:14] tonight?
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're under expectation,
[7:17] then anything can happen.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Anything can take place.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see uh uh saints of old in the
[7:25] Bible. Those who were under expectation,
[7:28] God came down to meet with them.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can even remember the Hebrew
[7:32] boys. Amen. faced with this difficult
[7:35] situation,
[7:36] &gt;&gt; they were told, "Bow down of going to
[7:38] the fire,
[7:40] &gt;&gt; but because they expected that at any
[7:42] point God would deliver them."
[7:44] &gt;&gt; They faced the obstacle head on and they
[7:47] went straight into the fire.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; You could be between a rock and a hard
[7:51] place tonight.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; But if you're under expectation,
[7:55] &gt;&gt; if you're under expectation,
[7:57] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. If you're under
[7:59] expectation, then God can meet with you
[8:02] at that point.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; When you don't know what to do. Amen.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Moses under expectation. He just held
[8:08] that rod over the Red Sea.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; And the the the waters parted. Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "I believe it's in
[8:15] redemption by completeness.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire went, it was a go
[8:20] between
[8:21] &gt;&gt; between death, which was Pharaoh, and
[8:24] them." So the pillar of fire was a go
[8:26] between. Tonight, there can be a go
[8:28] between, amen, between you and that
[8:31] devil.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; As long as you're under expectations.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Daniel in the Bible, he was faced with a
[8:37] lion's den, but he expected that God
[8:40] would deliver him.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; If you think about this church, Amen.
[8:48] Being in church is an opportunity
[8:51] &gt;&gt; for God to consider your case.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[8:57] Coming to church
[8:58] &gt;&gt; is an opportunity
[9:00] &gt;&gt; for God to consider your situation.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever you may be going through, this
[9:05] is an opportunity to present your case
[9:08] before God.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; And your case can be reconsidered,
[9:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Just like Hezekiah in the Bible. Amen.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; He had been told that put your house in
[9:18] order,
[9:19] &gt;&gt; you are going to die.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; But because he was under expectation,
[9:23] God reconsidered his case. That's right.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; And the same prophet that brought
[9:27] judgment is the same one that came back
[9:30] to say, "God has given you more time."
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Are we under expectation tonight?
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet says, "God will
[9:39] consider your case."
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will speak back.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; God can consider your case tonight and
[9:47] he will speak back to you.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; He will speak back to you.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; He may go to somewhere on that corner
[9:53] and he will speak to you. Amen.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Directly as you want it spoken, he can
[9:58] go to you and to you and to you as long
[10:01] as you're under expectation.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; We know there was a Mrs. Weber in the B
[10:05] in in the time of the prophet. Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; She had been told, Amen. The angel of
[10:10] the Lord, Amen. went to the prophet and
[10:12] said, "Mrs. Weber, you should get things
[10:15] ready." Amen. If you show me the next
[10:17] one. Amen. Mr. Weber was told, "Get
[10:20] things ready for your wife is going."
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; But Mrs. Weber, what did you do?
[10:27] &gt;&gt; She defended the prophet.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was when when those
[10:31] people were talking wrong about the
[10:33] prophet. She said, "I know, Bill.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; I've seen him from when he was growing
[10:37] up
[10:38] &gt;&gt; and I just want to pray for me.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; And what did the angel of the Lord say?"
[10:42] The same angel came back,
[10:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[10:45] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[10:46] &gt;&gt; "Tell her I heard her."
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And tell her that I heard what she
[10:51] said. Yeah,
[10:52] &gt;&gt; she just said amen to the word and her
[10:55] case was reconsidered.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; You can say amen tonight.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; If you say amen tonight,
[11:01] &gt;&gt; amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; If you say hallelujah tonight,
[11:04] &gt;&gt; if you say glory be to God tonight, the
[11:07] angel will come back with a message to
[11:10] say, tell this brother, tell this sister
[11:13] that I heard them say amen.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; And God can consider your case. Anyone
[11:18] can place their situation before God
[11:20] tonight.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; I was just doing a sound check.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, people that seen they
[11:28] do, you know, mic one, two, three,
[11:30] check. I was just doing the same.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to start speaking.
[11:35] Hallelujah.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I said I'm speaking about the day
[11:42] of vengeance.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[11:45] just looking at a definition from the
[11:48] Miriam Webster dictionary of vengeance
[11:51] and what it means. Amen. It says that
[11:53] vengeance it's a punishment that's
[11:56] inflicted in retaliation of an injury or
[12:00] offense. Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a retribution.
[12:04] Amen. It's it's a forceful payback.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Keep that in mind. It's a severe
[12:10] forceful payback
[12:12] &gt;&gt; of what has been done
[12:14] &gt;&gt; and that's vengeance.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um we also understand that the
[12:20] word vengeance. Amen. It speaks of
[12:22] judgment.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; It speaks of wrath. Considering Romans
[12:26] chapter 12, Amen. Verse 19, the Bible
[12:28] says,
[12:30] "Dearly beloved,
[12:32] avenge not yourselves,
[12:35] but rather
[12:37] &gt;&gt; give place unto wrath."
[12:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's saying that don't
[12:42] avenge yourself.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Give place, leave the way open for the
[12:46] wrath of God to take place.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. For it is written, vengeance is
[12:51] mine.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; I will repay, sayeth the Lord. Yes sir.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; And and the opening I read Hebrews 30 uh
[13:01] Hebrews 10:30. Now if you look at the
[13:03] preceding verses to verse 13 here the
[13:06] Bible um writes that he that despised
[13:10] Moses law died without mercy under two
[13:14] or three witnesses.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Of how much sorrow punishment suppose he
[13:19] shall he be thought worthy who have
[13:21] troted underfoot the son of God? Amen.
[13:24] and counted the blood of the covenant
[13:27] wherein he is uh he was sanctified an
[13:30] unholy thing and done despite unto the
[13:33] spirit of grace. Amen. And then verse 30
[13:36] then says for we know him that had said
[13:40] vengeance belongth unto me. In other
[13:42] words uh the
[13:47] Amen. Amen. In other words, the Bible
[13:50] was saying that um to those who have who
[13:54] have taken amen the the the the the
[13:57] grace of God and trotten it underfoot,
[14:00] the Bible says, "For we know him that
[14:03] said, "Vengeance belongth unto me. I
[14:05] will recompense, say the Lord." The Lord
[14:08] shall judge his people. The scripture is
[14:11] showing us that the word vengeance,
[14:13] Amen, it refers to God's judgment.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Stay with me. Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Vengeance,
[14:21] &gt;&gt; we understand it refers to God's
[14:24] judgment.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; But if you're a Bible reader, Amen. as
[14:30] you've been told that there's no word in
[14:32] the Bible that um is for not. Everything
[14:35] has its place.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're supposed to look at the
[14:39] Bible and be able to take something
[14:42] &gt;&gt; precept upon precept. Amen. Scripture
[14:44] upon scripture, here a little, there a
[14:47] little. what's written in one place.
[14:50] Amen. In another place, it will give
[14:52] more understanding of what else is
[14:53] written.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; And according to that, amen.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; When I looked at 2 Corinthians chapter
[14:59] 10:6,
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Paul here is speaking, he says,
[15:04] &gt;&gt; "And having a readiness to revenge, oh
[15:08] disobedience,
[15:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[15:10] &gt;&gt; When what? Your obedience is fulfilled."
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we took the words avenge and
[15:17] revenge. Now these these two words all
[15:20] result in vengeance.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; The only difference is that um avenging
[15:24] is taking vengeance on behalf of another
[15:27] person.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's impersonal or it's
[15:30] objective.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But revenge, Amen, is seeking
[15:34] vengeance for yourself.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it's personal and subjective.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; So we looked at the two words in two
[15:41] different verses. One was saying avenge
[15:43] and another was saying revenge but all
[15:46] of them they were speaking of vengeance
[15:49] &gt;&gt; and I said I'm speaking about the day of
[15:51] vengeance. Amen.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Now if you look at verse 6 of 2
[15:56] Corinthians 10
[15:59] &gt;&gt; look at the verse properly. Disobedience
[16:01] what is it? It's an evil thing.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; And obedience is a good thing.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when Paul says
[16:12] &gt;&gt; revenge all disobedience
[16:15] &gt;&gt; yes
[16:15] &gt;&gt; with obedienceh
[16:17] &gt;&gt; revenge your disobedience when your
[16:19] obedience is fulfilled.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[16:21] &gt;&gt; In other words
[16:24] &gt;&gt; take severe action
[16:26] &gt;&gt; forceful action
[16:28] &gt;&gt; retaliatory action to do what?
[16:31] &gt;&gt; To remove or to eradicate all the evil
[16:35] that has been done.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. In other words, when you revenge
[16:40] or disobedience with obedience,
[16:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[16:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, when vengeance has been
[16:45] taken.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; To replace disobedience with obedience.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; It's a complete reversal.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; It's a complete reversal,
[16:56] &gt;&gt; of all evil that has been done.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; It's reversing all the evil that has
[17:01] taken place
[17:02] &gt;&gt; with good.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; It's reversing every bad thing that has
[17:07] been done.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; With good.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; That's what 2 Corinthians 10 is telling
[17:12] us.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; That revenging disobedience with
[17:16] obedience. In other words, vengeance is
[17:18] taking place
[17:19] &gt;&gt; to take away all the evil that has been
[17:22] done.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Replacing it with good.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's being done
[17:27] forcefully.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's paying back all the
[17:32] evil
[17:33] &gt;&gt; with something good.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Severely.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop this reversal.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; So in other words, Paul is saying that
[17:44] vengeance must take place. In other
[17:46] words, reversal of everything evil with
[17:49] something good.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; When you break down the scripture and
[17:52] you analyze this, that's what that's
[17:54] what Paul is talking about.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just tell your brother, your
[17:59] sister, say, "The day of vengeance."
[18:03] &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Now, if you look further again,
[18:14] &gt;&gt; it's not within human beings to stop
[18:18] disobedience or wickedness.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; In the natural state, a human being can
[18:22] never stop that. Once they start
[18:24] cascading down this path, there's
[18:26] nothing within a human being to be able
[18:29] to carry out this action.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; It's far beyond you and I.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. To stop disobedience or
[18:35] wickedness.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; There's nothing within us that can make
[18:38] us take this action.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone. Amen.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Coming into the heart of a human being
[18:46] through the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[18:49] &gt;&gt; to turn this life around
[18:51] &gt;&gt; to stop this disobedience. Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; To reverse this evil with good, it takes
[18:56] God and God alone.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; So when Paul is saying that avenge your
[19:00] disobedience with obedience, in other
[19:02] words, he's saying that this is an act
[19:04] of God.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; This is God and God alone.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; That is performing this reversal.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; That's why scripture and scripture says
[19:15] vengeance is mine, say the Lord. I can
[19:18] totally understand it.
[19:20] There's nothing within you that can make
[19:22] you stop your disobedience.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; There's nothing within you that can stop
[19:26] wickedness.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone to perform
[19:30] this reversal.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; It takes God and God alone to bring this
[19:35] vengeance. Amen. Eradicating evil with
[19:38] good.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; I think I think you you are getting me
[19:46] right.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let me let me proceed by
[19:50] saying this. Amen.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Uh sorry how how much time do we have?
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[19:59] So we now understand amen that there's
[20:03] another aspect of God's vengeance or his
[20:06] judgment according to the explanation we
[20:09] looked at. There's another aspect of his
[20:11] judgment. Amen. Which is a reversal of
[20:15] all evil. Amen. It's a reverser of evil
[20:18] with good if you take the context of 2
[20:21] Corinthians 10. So when the Bible says
[20:24] vengeance is mine, amen, it's pointing
[20:27] to God's judgment. But we just look at
[20:29] an aspect of this which this process, it
[20:33] reverses every evil thing.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; With something that's good to take its
[20:38] place.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Are we still together?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Having built that concept. Amen. Let's
[20:45] then turn to Isaiah 61. I'm not going to
[20:47] take your time. Amen. It's a midweek
[20:49] service. Amen. So I understand you know
[20:51] the complexities of life. Amen. So
[20:55] Isaiah 61. The Bible says now
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that's not
[20:58] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord God is upon it
[21:01] picks up voices
[21:02] &gt;&gt; because the Lord has anointed me to
[21:04] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[21:08] had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
[21:11] to proclaim liberty to the captives and
[21:14] the opening of the prisons to them that
[21:16] are bound.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Bible says to
[21:19] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[21:23] &gt;&gt; and
[21:25] the day of what?
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Vengeance.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; The day of vengeance
[21:30] &gt;&gt; of our God to comfort all that mourn.
[21:33] Hallelujah. Now with scripture. Amen.
[21:35] You're supposed to to look at scripture
[21:38] and seek and an and understanding of
[21:40] what is being said. Amen. Now, we know
[21:43] that the Lord Jesus Christ when um there
[21:46] was one time he he went into the
[21:48] synagogue. Amen. And he went into the
[21:50] temple and what happened? He was handed
[21:52] a scroll. Amen. And then he opened the
[21:55] book of Isaiah to this very portion. And
[21:57] what does it say? If you look even in
[22:00] Luke chapter 4, it speaks about this.
[22:02] Amen. I highlight this in red to show
[22:04] that this is the Lord speaking to you so
[22:06] you can get it.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when you open the book,
[22:10] Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Because he has anointed me to preach the
[22:17] gospel to the poor.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; He has sent me to heal the
[22:20] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[22:23] the captives and recovering of sight to
[22:26] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[22:29] are bruised. Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; To preach the acceptable year of the
[22:32] Lord.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible goes on and it says,
[22:35] "And he closed the book
[22:37] &gt;&gt; as if he was seemingly ignoring verse
[22:39] two." Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; He read verse one and at the end of
[22:43] verse one, he closed the book and then
[22:45] he handed it back. Hallelujah.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; As if he was ignoring the latter part of
[22:49] the verses which which we read. Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says he gave it again
[22:54] to the minister and he sat down.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And all eyes, all the eyes of all
[23:00] of them that were in the scene of God
[23:02] were fasted upon him.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on Christ at all times.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; And he began to say unto them,
[23:13] &gt;&gt; this day,
[23:14] &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled in your
[23:16] eyes.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; So when he goes into the temple, he
[23:18] opened Isaiah 61,
[23:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:20] &gt;&gt; And then he started reading and then he
[23:22] stopped where it says, "Amen." um to
[23:26] preach the acceptance of the Lord and
[23:29] then he closed the book and he handed it
[23:30] back.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Now we can only understand this not of
[23:34] our own understanding
[23:36] &gt;&gt; but by referring to the prophet of
[23:37] Malachi 4.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; He is the only one. Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; That can help us understand this.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Glory glory to God.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Now looking at this day this scripture
[23:50] is fulfilled.
[23:52] Paragraph 44, the prophet says, "How
[23:56] accurate is the scripture?" If you
[23:58] notice this in in Isaiah 61:1-2
[24:01] is where our Lord was reading from. But
[24:04] in the middle of the second verse of
[24:06] Isaiah 61, uh he stopped where it said,
[24:09] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me to
[24:12] preach the acceptable year." Then he
[24:14] stopped. Why? The other part to bring
[24:19] judgment, which is that day of
[24:21] vengeance, Amen.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; The other part to bring judgment, it
[24:25] didn't apply to
[29:32] Oh, glory be to God. You may have
[29:35] thought that I I received a small
[29:37] blessing. Maybe that's my lot. But in
[29:40] the day of vengeance, the Bible says
[29:42] they shall possess double
[29:46] a double for your shame. And then God
[29:49] says, because this is what happens in
[29:51] the day of judgment, God says, I the
[29:54] Lord, I love judgment. Because in the
[29:57] day of vengeance, my business is to
[29:59] reverse evil with good for my people.
[30:02] And God loves it. Somebody may have
[30:05] robbed you all along. And that devil is
[30:09] seeking to rob. He's seeking to destroy.
[30:12] He's seeking to take away all your
[30:13] dreams. But God says in the day of
[30:16] vengeance, I'm going to repay the
[30:19] wrongdoer.
[30:20] I'm going to repay the wrongdoer. Do you
[30:23] love him tonight? God can do it for you.
[30:27] Hallelujah. In the valley of the dry
[30:29] bones, all the bones were scattered. All
[30:32] the bones were destroyed. But because
[30:34] God says, "I'll give you beautiful
[30:36] ashes." He went into the valley of the
[30:39] dry bones and then he took a bone that
[30:42] was meant to go to the other bone. He
[30:44] took the leg that was meant to connect
[30:46] to the right hip. It wasn't it was not
[30:49] haphazard. He took the very problem. He
[30:52] took the very situation rather that the
[30:55] devil had destroyed and he put it back
[30:57] piece by piece, piece by piece, piece by
[31:00] piece. West Palm Beach. God is going to
[31:03] collect all your dreams that had been
[31:06] shattered and he's going to put them
[31:08] together. But then what does he say? He
[31:11] doesn't prophesy. He say, "Son of man,
[31:15] can these dry bones leave?" He's saying,
[31:18] "Where's Palm Beach? Can the dry bones
[31:20] leave? Can the dry bones leave?" You may
[31:24] be looking at the valley of your dreams
[31:26] shattered and broken. But he's asking
[31:29] you tonight, can your hopes and dreams
[31:31] resurrect?
[31:33] Can your hopes and dreams resurrect?
[31:35] He's asking you. He's asking you to do
[31:38] the prophesying. So I'm going to allow
[31:40] you to prophesy tonight. Come, somebody
[31:43] say resurrect.
[31:45] Resurrect. Resurrect. Job. Job.
[31:50] Resurrect. Children, come back to the
[31:53] home. Family, you can apply the token.
[31:57] You may have a family member that does
[31:58] not want to get into the message, but
[32:01] God is asking you to prophesy.
[32:04] God is asking you to prophesy. God is
[32:07] not doing the prophesying. He's saying
[32:09] that you prophesy.
[32:11] You prophesy and your situation will
[32:14] resurrect. Your situation will
[32:17] resurrect. Your situation, hallelujah,
[32:20] it will walk into your home. Your
[32:22] situation will take two steps. It will
[32:25] it will knock on your door just like the
[32:28] alligators of Florida. It will come to
[32:30] your front door. Amen. Your hopes, they
[32:34] will resurrect. They will come
[32:35] scratching at the door saying, "Open the
[32:38] door for me." Oh, hallelujah.
[32:41] Son of man, West Palm Beach. West Palm
[32:45] Beach. Can your dry bones resurrect?
[32:48] Yes, sir.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; You do the prophesying. This is your
[32:51] chance to prophesy.
[32:55] The day of vengeance, it's a complete
[32:58] reversal of evil with good.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's a complete
[33:03] restoration
[33:05] of everything.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; In 2 Kings chapter 8, Amen. There was a
[33:10] w woman. She had been told to leave the
[33:13] land because of famine. She is the one
[33:16] whose son had been resurrected by the
[33:17] prophet Elisha. But one time the king
[33:20] wanted to know the good things that had
[33:22] been done by the prophet. Hallelujah.
[33:24] And the book was opened and then and and
[33:26] then it came to a portion where it spoke
[33:29] about this widow. But remember she had
[33:31] left the land because of famine for
[33:33] seven years. And then while she was in
[33:35] the court somewhere, Gaz pointed her out
[33:38] to the king saying, "This is the woman
[33:41] whose son was resurrected." What did the
[33:43] king do? Hallelujah. The king said he
[33:46] appointed a certain officer. Hallelujah.
[33:49] To go and restore everything
[33:52] to restore what? All the years that had
[33:55] been lost. In other words, it was a
[33:57] complete reversal of everything that had
[34:00] been done that was evil. double for your
[34:03] possession. Oh, glory be to God. Now,
[34:06] watch this. Watch the scriptures. The
[34:09] Bible says the king is the one who
[34:11] appointed this officer. The king is the
[34:14] only one who can pass judgment. So, King
[34:17] Jesus this evening, King Jesus this
[34:20] evening, he's passing judgment on your
[34:23] behalf. And he's appointing a certain
[34:26] officer. Who is this officer? Amen.
[34:29] That's going to give you the
[34:30] restoration. It's none other but the
[34:32] Holy Ghost. It's none other but him. The
[34:35] Holy Ghost. He's coming over there. He's
[34:38] going to go to your bosses at work to
[34:40] say, "Release my daughter. Release my
[34:43] son." You've been causing them trouble
[34:45] all this time. But this is a total
[34:48] restoration. Release her. Release him.
[34:51] Release him. It's a restoration. Not for
[34:55] one year, not for 2 years, not for 3
[34:58] years, but all the years.
[35:03] Start looking back in your life. It may
[35:05] be 20 years for you. I don't know. But
[35:08] the scripture says all the years. God is
[35:11] going to bring it back unto you. Oh,
[35:14] glory be to God. Glory be to God. All
[35:18] the years. Not in part, but in full.
[35:22] It's a complete reversal.
[35:24] Believe yourself this tonight.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Now, as we've laid the context, I think
[35:34] you know what this day of vengeance is.
[35:35] Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Let's carry on.
[35:43] Now um
[35:46] we know that the prophet says according
[35:47] to um the quote he says that day of
[35:51] vengeance amen it applied to his second
[35:54] coming.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; We've always got to stay in scriptures.
[35:57] Amen.
[35:58] Now if you open uh Daniel chapter 7
[36:02] verse 9 the Bible says and I beheld the
[36:05] thrones were cast down and the ancient
[36:08] of days did sit whose garment was as
[36:11] white as snow and the hair of his head
[36:14] like pure wool his throne was like the
[36:16] fiery flame and his wheels as burning
[36:19] fire. Amen. a fiery. Now, it's talking
[36:23] about this setting that the prophet
[36:25] referred to as his second coming is
[36:28] speaking of the judgment, which is that
[36:30] day of vengeance. Now, we find this in
[36:32] Daniel 7 is it's talking about the
[36:34] ancient of days sitting upon a throne.
[36:36] Amen. And a fiery stream issued and came
[36:40] forth from before him. Thousands
[36:43] thousands ministered unto him and 10,000
[36:47] times 10,000 stood before him. The
[36:49] judgment was set. Amen. And the books
[36:53] were opened. Hallelujah. Now in another
[36:56] place, the prophet says that the 10
[36:58] thousands times thousands that
[36:59] ministered with him, they were the
[37:01] bride. So you and I were sitting with
[37:03] him with him upon that throne. Amen.
[37:06] This this is the judgment throne. Amen.
[37:08] Of Revelation 20.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; But I brought this in so we can stay
[37:13] with scriptures. Amen. But now give give
[37:16] me your attention when I say this. When
[37:18] I say this now, this judgment which is
[37:22] referred to by the prophet, Amen.
[37:25] If you take it in the context of the day
[37:27] of judgment or the day of vengeance, you
[37:30] can automatically cast your um your mind
[37:33] to the setting of Daniel 7, which amen
[37:36] is the conclusion
[37:39] the conclusion of the whole picture. In
[37:41] other words, is the culmination of the
[37:44] whole picture. the ancient of days
[37:46] sitting upon the throne passing
[37:47] judgment. So if you just look at that
[37:50] quotation in its isolation remember I
[37:52] said to you precept is upon precept line
[37:56] gives you understanding of another line.
[37:58] If you just take it in isolation you'll
[38:00] think amen the day of judgment is the
[38:03] one referred to in Daniel 7 or
[38:04] revelation 20.
[38:07] But this is the conclusion of the whole
[38:10] picture. It's the culmination of his
[38:13] second coming.
[38:15] Oh, hallelujah. This is when I get
[38:17] excited. Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; This is when I get really excited.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; But then what is the second coming of
[38:24] the Lord?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] What is the second coming of the Lord
[38:29] Jesus Christ? You can only see it in in
[38:32] scriptures. Amen. I love preaching from
[38:34] the Bible.
[38:36] Now, 1 Thessalonians 4, the Bible says,
[38:39] "For the Lord himself
[38:42] shall descend from heaven." In our, in
[38:45] other words, this is the second coming
[38:47] of the Lord.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; He shall descend from heaven
[38:53] &gt;&gt; with a shout, with the voice of the
[38:55] archangel, and with the trump of God,
[38:58] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[39:01] In other words, Daniel 7, Revelation 20,
[39:04] is the culmination of the whole picture.
[39:08] But the second coming of the Lord, we
[39:10] find it in First Thessalonians 20. Oh,
[39:13] sorry. First Thessalonians 4:16. When he
[39:16] shall descend, he comes with a shout,
[39:19] with the voice of the archangel, with
[39:22] the trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[39:24] shall rise first. Oh, hallelujah.
[39:28] Now, in the message, the rapture. Amen.
[39:31] The prophet says that
[39:34] three things happens.
[39:36] A voice, a shout, um a voice, a trumpet
[39:41] has to happen before Jesus appears. Now
[39:44] Jesus does all three of them.
[39:47] Hallelujah. So his second coming, we
[39:50] start seeing it in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[39:53] Jesus himself who the prophet says the
[39:56] day of vengeance was referring to his
[39:58] second coming. his second coming. Amen.
[40:01] It's done in these stages. He does all
[40:04] three of them according to the prophet.
[40:06] A shout. What is the shout?
[40:10] What is the shout? Oh, hallelujah. West
[40:13] Palm Beach, what is the shout?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; What is the beginning of the second
[40:17] coming of the Lord? What is it, West
[40:18] Palm Beach?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; What is the shout? It's the message
[40:22] going forth. Hallelujah.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; The living bread of life bringing what?
[40:28] The bride.
[40:30] The bride. A shout is going forth
[40:33] saying, "Arise and trim your lambs. The
[40:35] bridegroom is coming." What is it? The
[40:38] when the Lord shall descend, he shall
[40:40] descend with a shout, the voice of the
[40:43] archangel, the trump of God. This is all
[40:46] his second coming.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Now, as as we've understood, Amen.
[40:53] According to Isaiah 6:12, Amen. We
[40:56] understand that the day of vengeance,
[40:58] it's God's judgment. The day of God's
[41:00] judgment. And then we've seen, amen,
[41:03] that there's a culmination of the
[41:04] judgment. But but then I want to say
[41:07] that the beginning of this judgment, the
[41:10] beginning of the day of vengeance. It
[41:13] starts when the Lord starts to descend.
[41:16] And Jesus does all three things. He
[41:19] begins with the shout. So when you start
[41:22] hearing the shout automatically you know
[41:24] that the day of vengeance is upon us. Oh
[41:28] glory be to God.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Oh glory be to God. What does it say the
[41:33] other part to bring judgment? It comes
[41:36] with his second coming. And what did we
[41:38] say about judgment? It's the day of
[41:40] vengeance. And what is this? Is to
[41:43] reverse
[41:44] is to reverse all evil.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; All evil with good. Are you ready, West
[41:51] Palm Beach? Are you ready? Amen. The
[41:54] Lord comes down with a shout. The Lord
[41:57] comes down with a shout. Amen. If you
[41:59] show me the next picture. Amen. If you
[42:01] go to the next picture, what happened in
[42:03] 1963?
[42:04] The Lord descended. Amen. I listen. If
[42:09] people talk about this cloud, that's for
[42:10] them. But for you and me, I know that
[42:14] when he descended, he was showing that
[42:16] he started his descent. He started his
[42:19] second coming.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus doing all three himself.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; He came down to proclaim that the shout
[42:26] is now in force.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And when you saw that cloud,
[42:29] automatically you know that now is the
[42:31] day of vengeance. So you can start
[42:34] buckling up somebody. You can start
[42:36] buckling up somebody because you're in
[42:38] the message. Are you happy you're in the
[42:41] message? Are you glad you're in the
[42:43] message? Now we can start saying that
[42:45] every evil thing that has been done to
[42:48] you, Amen, it's going to be reversed.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to be reversed.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Every evil thing that has been done in
[42:56] your life, it's going to be reversed.
[42:59] Amen. It's a total restoration.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to be done
[43:04] forcefully.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without stopping it. Nothing is
[43:09] going to stop it. Nothing is going to
[43:11] stand in its way. Amen. Now if we go to
[43:14] Luke chapter 18, the Bible says,
[43:18] "And he spake a parable unto them to
[43:20] this end that men ought to always pray
[43:24] and not to faint, saying,
[43:27] There was in a city a judge which feared
[43:30] not God, neither regarded men." And
[43:34] there was a widow in that city, and she
[43:36] came up unto him, saying, "Avenge me of
[43:39] my adversary." And he would not for a
[43:42] while. But afterward he said within
[43:43] himself, though I fear not God, nor
[43:47] regard men, yet because this widow
[43:50] troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
[43:53] her continual coming she weary me." And
[43:56] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[43:58] judge saith." Now the Lord turns around
[44:00] and he says, "And shall not God avenge
[44:03] his own elect which cried day and night
[44:06] unto him, though he be long with them? I
[44:10] tell you that he will avenge them
[44:12] speedily.
[44:14] Nevertheless, when the Son of man
[44:16] cometh, shall he find faith upon the
[44:18] earth. West Palm Beach, God is going to
[44:21] avenge you speedily. God is going to do
[44:24] it with speed. Amen. He's going to take
[44:27] your situation. He's going to turn it
[44:29] around with speed. Hallelujah. I don't
[44:31] care what is tending in your way, but
[44:33] he's going to do it with speed. I don't
[44:35] know what is blocking you, but he's
[44:37] going to do it with speed. I don't care
[44:40] what devil is standing in front of you,
[44:42] but God is coming with speed.
[44:44] Hallelujah. He's coming with a force
[44:46] that cannot be stopped because he's
[44:48] raising an army in this last day. You
[44:50] are part of that army.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; You are part of the bride. Hallelujah.
[44:55] You are part of the army of God and
[44:56] nothing can stand in your way. Now look,
[44:59] now look at this. Amen. The shout it is
[45:03] the message. What is it? is the Lord
[45:06] Jesus himself descending. Hallelujah.
[45:10] Now I just want you to look at this.
[45:13] David when he went to Ziglag. Amen. And
[45:17] then he found that everything had been
[45:18] taken. He found that everything has had
[45:21] been destroyed. He knew that vengeance
[45:24] could could not be done by him. So what
[45:26] did he do? He went to the Lord God.
[45:28] Amen. He sought after God to say, "What
[45:31] can I do? My home has been destroyed. My
[45:34] children have been taken away. So what
[45:36] shall I do? He went to him who vengeth
[45:40] belongth. And God said in verse 30,
[45:42] "Amen."
[45:44] And David inquired at the Lord, saying,
[45:46] "Shall I pursue after this troop, and
[45:49] shall I overtake them?" And God
[45:51] answered, saying, "Pursue, for you shall
[45:53] overtake them, and without fail you
[45:56] shall recover all."
[45:58] &gt;&gt; West Palm Beach, tonight it's time to
[46:01] recover. Oh, West Palm Beach tonight.
[46:05] It's time to recover. Oh, it's time to
[46:07] recover everything completely. It's time
[46:11] to recover everything. I don't know what
[46:13] is going on or miss, but tonight in
[46:16] service, if you are in service, this is
[46:18] your lucky day. If you're in service
[46:20] tonight, this is the day to recover. Oh,
[46:23] it's time to start an operation
[46:25] recovery. Oh, this is the time. This is
[46:28] the season. It's a new season. It's a
[46:31] new day to start recovering. Oh, I don't
[46:35] care what has happened to you. I'm
[46:36] fixing to close, but this is the time to
[46:38] recover everything. It's time to recover
[46:41] everything. All the children that have
[46:44] gone astray, you shall recover them. All
[46:47] the marriages that may have broken up,
[46:49] you shall recover them. You may have had
[46:52] a sickness, amen, that has been
[46:54] troubling you, but this time, this
[46:56] evening, you shall recover your health.
[46:58] This is the time to recover all the
[47:00] empty pockets that the devil had tried
[47:02] to put in you. Amen. But you shall
[47:05] recover everything. Riches come from
[47:07] above. Promotion cometh not from the
[47:10] east or the west, but promotion comes
[47:12] from above. Let me start prophesying
[47:14] here before I go back to London.
[47:17] Somebody's going to get promoted because
[47:20] you shall recover everything all the
[47:22] years that Satan has been stepping down
[47:25] on you. This is the season to recover
[47:28] everything. I didn't come from London to
[47:31] play games with Satan. I'm coming to
[47:34] tell you, amen, that you shall recover
[47:36] everything. You shall recover
[47:38] everything. Now, somewhere between the
[47:42] meetings in July and today, Brother
[47:44] Jack, somewhere between the weekend and
[47:47] Wednesday evening, something has
[47:49] happened. That something is called
[47:52] operation. Recover all things. Somewhere
[47:56] between here and there, there is a
[47:58] recovery. There's a recovery of all
[48:01] things. Oh, glory be to God. You at the
[48:05] back. You at the back. God is going to
[48:07] recover for you. God is going to take
[48:10] back. Satan, give it back. Satan, give
[48:14] it back. You're going to the enemy's
[48:17] camp. You shall recover everything
[48:20] because our God is faithful. Our God is
[48:23] faithful because you're in the message.
[48:26] God is going to recover everything for
[48:28] you, for you and for everybody. Oh,
[48:31] glory be to God because you have
[48:33] believed the prophet messenger. The word
[48:36] of the prophet can travel. The word of
[48:38] God can travel to any continent. You may
[48:41] have a desire tonight that you think can
[48:44] never be be claimed, but tonight it
[48:47] shall be recovered. Tonight it shall be
[48:49] recovered. You've just got to say,
[48:51] "Amen." Say, "Hallelujah, somebody." And
[48:54] the angel of the Lord, the angel of the
[48:57] Lord will come with a message saying, "I
[49:00] heard them in West Palm Beach." They
[49:02] were saying, "Amen." They were saying,
[49:04] "Hallelujah." And for that reason, I
[49:07] shall recover everything. I shall
[49:10] recover everything. Now, God loves this
[49:13] noise. Amen. God loves this shouting.
[49:17] God loves this shouting because the
[49:19] shout is the message. The shout is the
[49:22] Lord himself. Remember what happened at
[49:24] the walls of Jero. Amen. The scripture
[49:27] says the instruction there was a captain
[49:29] of the host. His back was to Jericho.
[49:32] Now, let me ask you something. If you're
[49:34] in war with somebody and you turn your
[49:36] back to them, it means you've got total
[49:38] control of the situation. He gave them
[49:41] an instruction and he said on the first
[49:43] day, what do you do? You go around what?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; The walls of Jero. What was the
[49:49] instruction for the second day?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; You walk around. What was the
[49:53] instruction on the third day?
[49:55] &gt;&gt; You walk around. But what was the
[49:57] instruction on the seventh day?
[50:00] On the seventh day, you go around the
[50:02] walls. And when you go around the walls
[50:04] the seventh time, what do you do? What
[50:07] do you do? What do you do? Now, let me
[50:10] leave this with you. Amen. Paul sounded
[50:13] his message. Paul blew the trumpet.
[50:16] Remember the the Bible says on the first
[50:18] day you blow your trumpets, but then you
[50:21] go back to the camp. Paul blew his
[50:23] trumpet and the bride you went back to
[50:25] your camp. Iranians blew his trumpet and
[50:28] they went back to the camp. But on the
[50:31] seventh day when the seventh messenger
[50:34] when he began to sound his message, you
[50:36] were given an instruction to give a
[50:39] shout because the manifestation of the
[50:42] shout which is the Lord himself who gave
[50:45] the shout who gave the shout. It was the
[50:48] children. It was you and me. We are the
[50:52] ones that have been told to give the
[50:53] shout. So, somebody in West Palm Beach,
[50:57] according to the instruction, God says
[50:59] you should give a shout of praise. God
[51:02] says you should say amen. God says you
[51:05] should say hallelujah. And as you say,
[51:07] hallelujah. The walls of Jericho, they
[51:11] are crumbling down. That situation, that
[51:14] devil, he's crumbling down. Whatever
[51:17] stood in front of you because you are
[51:19] giving this shout, it's coming down. is
[51:23] coming down by force. It's coming down
[51:25] by order proclaiming the spirit of
[51:28] Christ to go and fight for you. The
[51:31] Bible says you you shall not need to
[51:34] fight in this battle because I the Lord,
[51:38] he is the one who does the fighting for
[51:39] you. So I'm going to give you the next
[51:41] minute to start giving a shout of
[51:43] praise. Somebody start saying
[51:45] hallelujah. Because in the seventh day,
[51:49] in the seventh day, you are meant to
[51:51] give a shout. Christ in you, the hope of
[51:55] glory. Christ in you. He is the shout.
[51:59] But then is manifested in the bride. The
[52:02] shout is manifested in you and me. The
[52:05] shout is manifested in you and me. So as
[52:09] you were told, this is the time to
[52:11] finish everything. This is the time to
[52:14] finish the devil. Don't play games with
[52:17] Satan. Don't be like Pharaoh who said,
[52:20] "I want the flies to go tomorrow." The
[52:22] devil should go now.
[52:25] Right now. The moment you walk out of
[52:27] there when you go to the car park to get
[52:29] your car. The devil should have left
[52:31] your home. Brother Jack will come to
[52:34] your home one day and then he will find
[52:36] you shaking the sheets looking for the
[52:38] goer which will have fallen off. You'll
[52:41] be looking for the problem that had been
[52:43] troubling you. You'll be shaking those
[52:45] papers from those court summons. You'll
[52:48] be shaking that regret letter that told
[52:50] you that you can't have this job. You
[52:52] are not good enough. You are not the
[52:54] right caliber. You're not the right
[52:56] person. But in the seventh day, you can
[52:59] give a shout of praise. In the seventh
[53:02] message, in the seventh age, you can
[53:04] give a shout of praise. God and God
[53:07] alone. He will bring down the walls of
[53:09] Jericho. They will come tumbling down.
[53:12] Oh, glory be to God. Believe us now
[53:15] this. Somebody say hallelujah. Somebody
[53:18] say glory be to God. God bless you
[53:21] church. As I return to Lantern, return
[53:24] knowing that we are in the day of
[53:26] vengeance. And God in the day of
[53:28] vengeance, he shall recover everything
[53:31] for you. He shall reverse every evil
[53:34] with what? with good, every evil with
[53:37] what?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; If you didn't have a job, you've got to
[53:41] start saying that that job is what? It's
[53:43] mine.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; The job is what? It is mine because God
[53:48] is faithful. If you didn't have your
[53:50] healing, start proclaiming that because
[53:53] of the day of vengeance, there's going
[53:55] to be a reversal and God will give you
[53:57] my help. Somebody praise the Lord
[53:59] tonight. God bless you as I return to
[54:02] London. Over to you, sir. Hallelujah.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Come on and give God praise.
[54:24] My Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[54:32] Oh my God. My God. My God.
[54:38] I I don't think I ever heard it this way
[54:40] before.
[54:42] Amen. That That was just right on time.
[54:46] Right on time. This the day of vengeance
[54:49] is God reversing everything.
[54:52] Turning all the evil into good. I just
[54:54] love the way he brought out that
[54:56] scripture there in Isaiah 61. When you
[54:58] go back and you just read all of those
[55:00] things, take your time and I mean
[55:02] underline it. Oh, he's changing the
[55:05] whole situation. It's the day of
[55:06] vengeance. We always looked at as
[55:08] something negative, but no, this is
[55:10] something positive for the believer.
[55:13] Everything is changing for the believer.
[55:15] Everything is shifting. Beauty for
[55:18] ashes, right? Joy in the time of
[55:21] mourning. Everybody else is mourning for
[55:23] vengeance, but you got joy. Something
[55:25] something has changed for you. And I
[55:28] just love the way that brother brought
[55:29] that. He say God going to do it
[55:31] speedily.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; See, avenge is when somebody fights for
[55:36] you,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; but revenge is when you fight for
[55:39] yourself. But when you read the
[55:41] scripture said that God will avenge,
[55:43] that mean God is fighting on your
[55:45] behalf.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And I've never seen him lose not one
[55:50] battle. He's never lost a battle. And he
[55:54] does it quickly.
[55:56] Praise God. Man, I needed I needed that
[56:00] tonight.
[56:04] We we we we we came right out of the
[56:07] meetings and um you know um the devil
[56:11] just had to start with something and uh
[56:14] and as as we were you know come coming
[56:17] into the meetings, we start having
[56:19] problems with our AC and we got guests
[56:21] at the house and fans going and people
[56:24] sweating while the fans He's like,
[56:27] "Lord, we got trouble here." So, he's
[56:29] calling for the AC guy and he comes out
[56:31] and he says, "I don't see anything
[56:33] wrong." U you know, and he does a little
[56:35] something and charges $125. Okay, no
[56:38] problem. All right. We thought it was
[56:39] good, but we still sweating. We still
[56:42] sweating. We called him back out. He
[56:44] come right before the meet. He says,
[56:45] "Well, you know, I think you got a part
[56:48] that's broken and I can't find it. It
[56:51] take me four days to find this thing." I
[56:53] said, "Okay. All right. Well, we just
[56:54] got to wait until you find it." So he
[56:55] comes back on the day after the meeting
[56:57] say I got the part say all right great.
[56:59] He comes and just installs it but didn't
[57:01] tell us how much it was going to cost
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and then at the end after it's all done
[57:07] and and feeling real cool in the house
[57:08] he dropped $2500 on us. I say well
[57:11] praise God. Hallelujah. Don't don't the
[57:14] devil know how to fight? But this
[57:17] brother say God going to avenge
[57:20] &gt;&gt; speedily.

[1:03:54] God for blessing me with a new car. Um
[1:03:58] 2025 Lincoln Conser.
[1:04:02] Um I thank God for my son-in-law. Um he
[1:04:06] went down and he did everything and um
[1:04:10] he he once we decided on that car, he
[1:04:14] found the car, he found where it was. He
[1:04:16] did all the um the talking back and
[1:04:19] forth, all the negotiating, everything
[1:04:21] for me. Um my car was just it was bad.
[1:04:26] Um I was going somewhere and I was
[1:04:30] slowing down and uh it just cut off. it
[1:04:34] just it just stopped and I just say, you
[1:04:36] know, God, I thank you for protecting
[1:04:38] me. Um that it be because it could have
[1:04:41] been worse and I was literally in
[1:04:43] traffic when it happened. Um so at that
[1:04:46] point, my family was like, "No, you're
[1:04:47] done. Um you need a car." So, um, we
[1:04:52] went down, um, and started looking at
[1:04:54] the cars and and once we got there,
[1:04:57] before I got out of my car, um, he told
[1:05:00] me, he said, "Look, I'm going tell you
[1:05:01] now that it's going to get a little
[1:05:04] ugly, but you going to get this car."
[1:05:06] And I said, "Okay, all right." So, we
[1:05:09] went and sat down to the um to the um to
[1:05:12] the desk and Stephen did all the the
[1:05:15] talking. I'm sitting over in the corner
[1:05:16] playing on my phone, you know, and he's
[1:05:19] doing all the talking and going back and
[1:05:21] forth and they pushing papers back and
[1:05:23] forth and um um the salesman gave him
[1:05:28] one price and he was like, "No, no, your
[1:05:30] math ain't math. No, no, no." And I kind
[1:05:33] of looked up and I was like, "Okay." And
[1:05:35] I'm still playing on my phone and then
[1:05:38] um he went, "Oh, I got to talk to my
[1:05:40] manager." And went and talked to the
[1:05:41] manager, came back, gave him another
[1:05:43] number. Stephen said, "No." And then he
[1:05:46] looked at the man and he said, "Who can
[1:05:48] I thank for wasting my time for coming
[1:05:51] down here?" And I was like, "Who can't?"
[1:05:55] So, so I playing on my phone. And then
[1:05:58] the um the person was like, "Hold on,
[1:06:00] hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on." And
[1:06:02] then um they went back and forth and I'm
[1:06:04] really engrossed in what I'm doing,
[1:06:07] which is not paying attention to them.
[1:06:10] And so he said, "Uh, ma," I said,
[1:06:12] "Yeah." He said, "Look," I said, "Is it
[1:06:15] good?" He said, "Yeah." I said, "Do I
[1:06:17] sign?" And he said, "Yeah, you go ahead
[1:06:19] on and sign." I said, "Okay, I'mma sign
[1:06:21] it." And it was the payment was actually
[1:06:25] less than what I wanted.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for putting him in the
[1:06:30] in in the place where even when they
[1:06:33] were leaving, they actually missed their
[1:06:35] flight. Well, their flight was cancelled
[1:06:37] because of weather. So, they had to come
[1:06:40] back and we were able to do all of that
[1:06:42] work while he was here. So, I just thank
[1:06:45] God I have a car. It's not going to put
[1:06:48] me down and it's brand new and it's got
[1:06:51] the brand new smell to it and
[1:06:52] everything. God bless you.
[1:06:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:59] Thank God for that blessing.
[1:07:03] Amen.
[1:07:04] See, you hear testimonies like that and
[1:07:07] somebody say, "I'm next." You know, the
[1:07:10] angel trouble in the water. So, praise
[1:07:12] God. Anybody else want to share a
[1:07:15] testimony? Come on up. Come on up.
[1:07:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. It's not just for
[1:07:20] our church, some of our visitor, if
[1:07:22] y'all got testimonies to share to be a
[1:07:23] blessing, come on, share them. Amen. God
[1:07:26] bless you, Sister Virginia.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to come up, but I do want
[1:07:30] to share test my testimony. Um, I just
[1:07:33] give God thanks and praise for Ashley.
[1:07:36] If you all know that she was really sick
[1:07:39] um about a week or so ago out in Texas
[1:07:42] um where she could barely hold her head
[1:07:43] up um but she had a desire to be at the
[1:07:46] meetings. So um and then for her to get
[1:07:50] to the meeting, she need to be well
[1:07:51] enough to travel. She traveled from LA
[1:07:54] to um Dallas and she said with the
[1:07:57] pressure her ears drums just felt like
[1:08:00] they were going to burst. She had a lot
[1:08:01] of fluid um in her ear and some other
[1:08:04] things going on. But um I think by
[1:08:07] Wednesday night, she was here by 10:00
[1:08:11] Wednesday night and she was able to be
[1:08:13] in the meeting on Friday. Um she had
[1:08:16] said, "Well, I'm only going to go to the
[1:08:18] service on Sunday, Sunday morning. I'm
[1:08:20] not going to go to the meetings on
[1:08:22] Saturday." I think they had some of the
[1:08:23] things planned for Saturday, but she was
[1:08:26] only planning to come to this um Sunday
[1:08:28] morning meeting. And then Sunday evening
[1:08:31] call uh after they went out to eat um
[1:08:33] Gyrus's sister called and they well they
[1:08:35] said um we don't have time to come back
[1:08:37] and get my shoes. Bring my shoes and and
[1:08:40] we'll meet you at the church. So I said
[1:08:43] okay. She calling for a shouting shoes.
[1:08:45] We we we going back tonight. So and her
[1:08:48] mom was like she's going back. I was
[1:08:50] like yeah. She said bring her shouting
[1:08:52] shoes. Bring her shoes. And she coming
[1:08:53] back. I call her shouting shoes but she
[1:08:55] said bring her tennis shoes. And she was
[1:08:57] going back. Um, in the service doing the
[1:09:00] singing, Ashley got really sick again
[1:09:03] and um, she went up for prayer and next
[1:09:05] thing I know she was in the bathroom.
[1:09:07] They went and checked on her and she was
[1:09:09] in there just throwing up, just throwing
[1:09:11] up. So, we decided to go ahead and leave
[1:09:13] so that she could go home. Um, and she
[1:09:16] was like, well, she really didn't want
[1:09:18] to go. She felt like, you know, she
[1:09:19] would be okay, but she was just just a
[1:09:21] mess and she didn't want to be throwing
[1:09:23] up while everybody was coming out. So,
[1:09:25] we left out a little early before
[1:09:27] everyone else. And we went to the car
[1:09:30] again. She was just throwing up while we
[1:09:32] were in the car. We had to stop in the
[1:09:34] parking lot and everything. And Brother
[1:09:36] Whisper came out. So, I got him to pray
[1:09:38] for her. He prayed for her in the car
[1:09:40] and I said, "Well, I'll go go ahead and
[1:09:43] take her home and I'll go get something
[1:09:44] to drink, Gatorade or ginger ale or
[1:09:47] something like that." So, while we were
[1:09:49] in the store getting her something to
[1:09:50] drink, she called. She said, "Mama, I'm
[1:09:52] healed. I'm fine." She said, "I don't
[1:09:54] want you to be worried about me. I feel
[1:09:55] good. I I'm fine. I don't have any more
[1:09:57] problems." So, and as you all can see,
[1:10:00] she decided to give her testimony on
[1:10:02] Facebook and sing. And that's that's to
[1:10:05] me that's the greatest testimony that I
[1:10:07] haven't heard her sing in a long time.
[1:10:09] And that was a real blessing to me.
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that was what was she
[1:10:20] sung? Um he he touched me. Yeah, he
[1:10:24] touched me. Uh yeah, that's that went
[1:10:27] back. But uh she was Yeah, she sure let
[1:10:29] that one loose. Uh but she had sent me a
[1:10:32] text on Monday morning said that after
[1:10:35] brother Gwyn had prayed for her. Um I
[1:10:38] think she she regurgit regurgitated one
[1:10:41] more time, but it relieved all the
[1:10:42] pressure that she had in her brain and
[1:10:44] and that's when she knew she was healed.
[1:10:46] And uh so so God did some mighty things
[1:10:48] there in our midst. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:50] Anybody else want to share? Okay, come
[1:10:52] on. Come on. I I saw Sister Zion. Did I?

[1:13:21] while. And to be a service like this
[1:13:24] where vengeance is mine, says the Lord
[1:13:26] is the most important thing to me cuz
[1:13:28] I'm expecting God to move speedily in
[1:13:30] order to renew everything that I got
[1:13:33] tooken from me.
[1:13:35] So, I'm just thankful that he's opened
[1:13:38] the door for me to be able to I got a

[1:13:46] I'm like, "Well, I explained the
[1:13:48] situation, everything." And I was told,

[1:14:05] I got off work that night, it mean the
[1:14:07] text came late, but it was like,
[1:14:08] "Listen, we're going to go get you a
[1:14:09] rental car tomorrow." So, I got a rental
[1:14:13] car for a month. So, hopefully within
[1:14:15] that time frame, my whole case will be
[1:14:17] done, but I'm grateful that I was able

[1:15:13] thing.
[1:15:15] So, while I was up front, I was crying
[1:15:17] out
[1:15:19] uh about a few things, but my main thing
[1:15:23] was for my children to receive the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost.
[1:15:27] And as I was crying out about these
[1:15:29] things, my hands raised and I turned
[1:15:31] around and went back to my seat.
[1:15:34] And I got ready to raise my hand to
[1:15:36] continue on. And brother Troy, he he
[1:15:39] grabbed me on my shoulder.
[1:15:41] And I looked at him. He had this look on
[1:15:43] his face and I was like, "What's wrong,
[1:15:45] brother?"

[1:16:27] it. She said, "I got two boys. One just
[1:16:30] received the Holy Ghost. One is still
[1:16:33] battling with the world." And I told
[1:16:35] her, "Restoration is a process.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; It's a process." But he'll be back.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He actually came home. So he he's with
[1:16:44] us now.

[1:18:36] I've been having trouble with AT&T
[1:18:40] for the past couple of weeks where they
[1:18:42] shut off my phone, spoke, we was
[1:18:44] literally me and my husband been on the
[1:18:46] phone with different representative and
[1:18:47] it was seemed like nothing was working.
[1:18:51] Uh, f last week, I believe it was
[1:18:54] Wednesday or Thursday. Um, I said,
[1:18:57] "I'mma call AT&T." And he's like, "Okay,
[1:19:00] go call them." I called them, was on the
[1:19:03] phone for hours with one person, and
[1:19:05] he's like, "Well, you you need to pay
[1:19:08] this, this, this." And I'm like, "Okay."
[1:19:10] But I spoke to someone. He was just very
[1:19:12] rude on the phone. So, he transferred me
[1:19:14] to someone else and got on the phone
[1:19:16] with that guy. That guy was trying to
[1:19:19] fix the situation, but when he realized
[1:19:22] it was too big for him to fix, he just
[1:19:25] was he was like, "Um, I don't know,
[1:19:27] ma'am. Uh, I don't see what else I could
[1:19:29] do." So, I hand the phone to my husband
[1:19:31] and he said, "I don't know what
[1:19:34] happened. I walked away after this
[1:19:35] point, but keep in mind I've been
[1:19:37] praying because I'm like, I can't walk
[1:19:39] around here without a phone." And uh
[1:19:42] I've been praying. So, I let I walked
[1:19:44] out of the room and let him somehow he
[1:19:47] end up on the phone with the manager.
[1:19:49] And I don't know towards the end of I
[1:19:52] don't know the whole conversation, but
[1:19:53] towards the end, the lady was like,
[1:19:55] "Well, we'll give you guys a credit of
[1:19:57] $600.
[1:19:59] We don't know where the credit is going
[1:20:01] to go towards your towards the phone or
[1:20:04] towards your bill, but either way,
[1:20:06] you'll have to wait until Monday to
[1:20:09] figure out when the where the credit
[1:20:11] went. So, we both was talking. We just
[1:20:14] was like, "Well, the meeting is coming.
[1:20:16] We're going to pray over this whole
[1:20:17] situation." At the end of the day, I
[1:20:20] said, "It's already done. It's going to
[1:20:21] go towards the phone." I looked at him.
[1:20:23] I'm like, "It's going to go towards the
[1:20:24] bill. They're going to pay my phone. is
[1:20:26] gonna be paid off and I'm not going to
[1:20:28] worry about it. Well, I got a text
[1:20:30] message today um saying to restore your
[1:20:33] phone, you have to pay $91. And keep in
[1:20:37] mind, the bill was really high all
[1:20:39] because of some messed up team AT&T did
[1:20:43] where the bill was super high and all we
[1:20:46] had to pay was $91. And I I called
[1:20:50] Maris. I'm like, they said we all have
[1:20:52] to pay $91. And he talking about that's
[1:20:54] it. We knew God was gonna do it. So, he
[1:20:56] paid it and my phone is on. I mean,
[1:21:02] so, um, before the meetings, we had like
[1:21:05] a lot of a lot more stuff. I'm still
[1:21:07] waiting. Um, I know it's all going to
[1:21:08] come in due time. So, you'll see me
[1:21:10] again. God bless you.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's all right. Prophesying that there
[1:21:18] will be another testimony.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. All right. Anybody
[1:21:24] else want to testify? Anybody else? All
[1:21:27] right.
[1:21:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. On um was it
[1:21:36] yesterday? I think it was yesterday. Um
[1:21:38] I had to go rent a tool from uh Home
[1:21:42] Depot to uh do some yard work. So, I go
[1:21:46] and rent the tool and I'm trying to rush
[1:21:49] back. Now, mind you, I caught myself
[1:21:51] getting up early. I had to I went to one
[1:21:52] Home Depot and rented the tool. Got back
[1:21:54] to the house to use the tool and uh uh
[1:21:58] it wasn't working. So, I took it back to
[1:22:00] that Home Depot. I went to another Home
[1:22:01] Depot to rent the tool and I got it from
[1:22:04] there. I'm trying to rush back cuz I'm
[1:22:05] trying to beat the heat.
[1:22:07] Okay. So I'm on my way back and actually
[1:22:10] coming up that hill there on job near
[1:22:14] Jacob and I'm coming around and I'm
[1:22:18] trying to get over into the left lane
[1:22:21] and there was another vehicle come up to
[1:22:23] block me.
[1:22:25] So I waited.
[1:22:28] This lady came up and she said some
[1:22:30] choice words to me and I said well you
[1:22:33] either you going to go what are you
[1:22:34] going to do? So she didn't go anywhere.
[1:22:37] So, I sped up and I had room to get over
[1:22:41] and as I'm getting over, clip the side
[1:22:44] of my car in the back fender.
[1:22:48] The car swerve coming down that hill.
[1:22:52] Thank be to God,
[1:22:54] he was able to get it back in control.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Ended up going down the hill, called the
[1:23:00] police. Whole thing happened. They said,
[1:23:02] "Sir, we're going to have to charge you
[1:23:03] with the accident." I said, "Watch me."
[1:23:05] She sped up. Well, we can't prove she
[1:23:08] sped up. I said, "Well, thank God that's
[1:23:10] why I got insurance." But I just thank
[1:23:12] God that I didn't totally lose control
[1:23:14] and roll that car going down that hill.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So, thanks be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And I got home, got
[1:23:25] the tool, used the tool, got the work
[1:23:27] done, and took it back. Amen.
[1:23:31] So
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; this this who got my
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Jerry. Before we do
[1:23:37] this,
[1:23:52] God bless you, church.
[1:23:55] These meetings were
[1:23:58] certainly life-changing. Um
[1:24:01] this testimony is a little bit of some
[1:24:04] of the things that happened throughout
[1:24:05] the meeting and even after um throughout
[1:24:09] the meeting uh in the weekend uh just
[1:24:13] the atmosphere was just was just you you
[1:24:17] know the presence of the Lord was there
[1:24:20] and it didn't hit me until um I got home
[1:24:24] and I believe this was Saturday night
[1:24:27] Uh,
[1:24:29] and we're getting ready to
[1:24:33] put the bed or put the kids to bed. And
[1:24:36] I've never seen this like this in my
[1:24:38] children, but I just saw a shift and it
[1:24:43] started with my son Jeremiah and he uh
[1:24:47] just just saw him getting the mic and we
[1:24:50] we have different toy mics and and all
[1:24:53] he wanted to do is is is pretty much
[1:24:57] have service.
[1:24:59] Um he would take we have the phone and
[1:25:02] he would start playing quiet music and
[1:25:05] I'm like what what are we
[1:25:08] and he would take the mic and he would
[1:25:10] start trying to either sing or something
[1:25:13] or or I mean my wife even looked at him
[1:25:15] and says is he preaching
[1:25:18] and and and and I've just saw this shift
[1:25:21] in them and my daughter and and and and
[1:25:24] all of them. And I was it was at that
[1:25:27] moment it hit me. I was like, "Oh my,
[1:25:30] they recognize something. They recognize
[1:25:33] the presence of the Lord."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Um, and ever since I've seen the same uh
[1:25:39] the same uh attitude in them. So, I just
[1:25:42] want to thank God for that.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And uh my uh throughout the meetings is
[1:25:47] uh different ones that I invited. I
[1:25:49] wanted a lot of uh people that uh family
[1:25:52] uh to be there. Um, I want to thank God
[1:25:55] that my mother got the chance to make
[1:25:56] it.
[1:25:58] Um, growing up, uh, I I I I thank my
[1:26:02] mother for, uh, showing me, you know,
[1:26:06] how to be to be committed to going to
[1:26:08] church. Uh, but when we had the chance
[1:26:11] to, uh, sit right next to each other,
[1:26:13] um, I I just saw how how she was saying
[1:26:17] amen to the revealed word.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for that. She called me
[1:26:21] right after service. She says, "I've
[1:26:22] never I've never seen, you know, the
[1:26:25] Lord moving that way."
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And and she says she says she was so
[1:26:30] blessed.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So, I want to thank God for that. And I
[1:26:33] have a a older sister that I haven't
[1:26:36] seen in years. And she moved back into
[1:26:40] Palm Beach County. And I had a chance to
[1:26:42] invite her on Friday. and she she came
[1:26:46] and after the service we spoke and she
[1:26:49] says, "I've been looking for a place to
[1:26:51] fellowship and I would like to I'd
[1:26:54] definitely like to come back because I
[1:26:56] see the spirit of the Lord moving here."
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And the last one I want to mention is I
[1:27:01] have another sister, my younger one,
[1:27:03] that I wanted to be there as well. She
[1:27:06] gave me her commitment, her word that
[1:27:08] she was going to be there on Friday. Uh
[1:27:10] but things happened and it didn't work
[1:27:12] out. Um, and she reached out to me on
[1:27:15] Monday, uh, Monday morning. Um, and she
[1:27:18] told me, you know, she felt so bad that
[1:27:20] she didn't make it. She was, she was
[1:27:22] saying, "I'm sorry." And then she
[1:27:24] started asking me questions, uh, like,
[1:27:26] "Why does God allow this to happen or
[1:27:29] that to happen?" Uh, but I began just
[1:27:31] sharing some scriptures with her. And,
[1:27:34] you know, um, she I I I believe God is
[1:27:39] on his way of restoring her back. Um, I
[1:27:42] I see that her heart is tender and and I
[1:27:45] see that she she she realizes where she
[1:27:47] is and she knows that this next turn is
[1:27:51] got to be God. So, I'm I'm claiming, you
[1:27:54] know, that her testimony that she's been
[1:27:56] restored
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; um and that she'll be back in the house
[1:27:58] of the Lord.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all.
[1:28:06] [Applause]
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um earlier today
[1:28:13] when we were setting up, brother Jack
[1:28:16] was letting know we can't set up the
[1:28:18] camera. We're trying to set things up to
[1:28:20] get the best shot. We can can't do it
[1:28:22] here and there and this that and the
[1:28:23] other because going across there is a
[1:28:26] trip hazard.
[1:28:28] And um so brother Maris,
[1:28:32] come on up. This was already something
[1:28:36] not done for your birthday.
[1:28:39] Let brother Maris take it from here.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Um well, first just to add a little more
[1:28:48] context. Um
[1:28:50] uh well, I'm a testimony from my wife.
[1:28:52] Um we are one, so that's our testimony.
[1:28:55] Um
[1:28:57] they uh AT&T had changed a plan on our
[1:29:00] phone um where they switched the numbers
[1:29:04] to the phone and added the line and they
[1:29:06] locked it and told us in order for us to
[1:29:09] undo it we had to cancel both and pay
[1:29:11] like $1,000
[1:29:13] and um I told my wife said no way I'm
[1:29:15] paying $1,000 for a phone. There's no
[1:29:17] way just for the bill that wasn't you
[1:29:19] know um so like she said she I she said
[1:29:22] oh yeah I said just call them. She
[1:29:24] called, she gave me the phone, she
[1:29:25] walked away. I said, "Um, we've been
[1:29:28] trying to figure this out for a while.
[1:29:30] You know what? Can I just talk to your
[1:29:31] supervisor?" Excuse me. Um, so, um, they
[1:29:34] called the supervisor I talked to. I
[1:29:36] said, "Ma'am, I don't know what's going
[1:29:38] on, but this this just ain't this ain't
[1:29:40] right." I was like, I I was like, "I
[1:29:42] don't mind, you know, a phone bill. I
[1:29:44] want the service, but I would not pay
[1:29:45] $1,000 for just a phone to be on when it
[1:29:48] was something done without our consent."
[1:29:50] Um, well, she said, "Sir, that was one
[1:29:53] of our retailers that wasn't AT&T, even
[1:29:56] though it said AT&T on the building."
[1:29:58] Um, so I just I said, "Ma'am,
[1:30:01] just something got to change." And as I
[1:30:03] said it to her, I hear clicking in the
[1:30:05] background. And she said, "Well, sir,
[1:30:09] I'm going to post a $600 credit to your
[1:30:12] account, and I don't know which way it's
[1:30:14] going to go on Monday. You'll see." And
[1:30:16] that's my wife said, she walked away. I
[1:30:18] said, "Okay." I already told her right
[1:30:20] then and I said it's going to be all
[1:30:22] right by next week. Don't worry about
[1:30:23] it. And it happened and like I said, she
[1:30:25] said she got an email was 97 $91. That's
[1:30:28] it. All right. Pay it and phone
[1:30:31] restored.
[1:30:33] Amen. Um that that was just um but these
[1:30:37] these um as brother brother Troy said
[1:30:40] earlier, he brother Troy looked at me
[1:30:42] say, "Yeah, don't like don't your job
[1:30:44] make carpets?" And um God bless you,
[1:30:47] brother Simba. We've been working on
[1:30:48] this for a while. Um, so it they
[1:30:51] actually just came in Monday when we
[1:30:53] were setting up uh taking everything out
[1:30:55] of uh Palm Beach Gardens. Um, I remember
[1:30:58] pastor saying that the church started at
[1:31:00] his home. So I wanted to make sure I got
[1:31:03] a carpet that represented
[1:31:06] here and I want another carpet to
[1:31:09] represent there cuz somewhere between
[1:31:11] here and there
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:26] I bless you, brother Jack. And we
[1:31:28] preparing for our new home.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:31:38] praise the Lord.
[1:31:40] You do this.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. That that's that's one of them
[1:31:44] carpets where you want to tell people
[1:31:46] don't step on that now.
[1:31:50] Walk around that. Don't step on that.
[1:31:53] Thank y'all brothers. My god. What that
[1:31:56] is that is awesome. My what a wonderful
[1:31:59] surprise.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much.
[1:32:07] My Amen. Amen.
[1:32:11] Um,
[1:32:12] I I I I thought we'd have at least one
[1:32:15] more testimony and I don't know if the
[1:32:16] brother want to give a testimony.
[1:32:19] Uh, Brother Steve, you got anything you
[1:32:21] want to say tonight? Anything.
[1:32:26] Yeah, I thought so. I thought so.
[1:32:29] Yeah, you can. Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; He's my fishing buddy.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I use my body when we go out
[1:32:40] for fishing.
[1:32:42] Oh, God bless you, saints. God bless
[1:32:43] you.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to be here. The devil was
[1:32:47] trying to, you know, distract our way
[1:32:50] when we're coming here. We actually got
[1:32:53] here and we told turn here. I said,
[1:32:54] "There's no turning here." Then I
[1:32:57] proceeded along. Then he told me to go
[1:32:59] and make a U-turn until brother Solomon
[1:33:02] came to our rescue and said, "No, just
[1:33:04] stand there." And here we are by forced
[1:33:07] order.
[1:33:08] Uh, I'm not new here. This is this is
[1:33:13] home to me, so to speak.
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I don't want to start to go into
[1:33:23] scriptures and and the like because we
[1:33:26] might spend the other night here. But uh
[1:33:30] all I want to say is you are thou art at
[1:33:33] favored
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; because uh the arm of the Lord is upon
[1:33:39] this church and uh it was always my
[1:33:43] desire
[1:33:44] uh to see such a gathering in an
[1:33:46] environment where they are not pressed
[1:33:49] for time
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and where you can do all your things
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; according to your will. All I'm saying
[1:33:57] is I've just come to put my hand on the
[1:34:00] plow as well.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; And we are going to soldier on together.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; God is not a God of distance.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Despite that I live in England, but when
[1:34:10] we trigger on some prayers, I know the
[1:34:13] gentleman who is none other than the
[1:34:16] Holy Ghost will direct that holy that
[1:34:19] plea and everything will come to
[1:34:21] fruition.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I want to say God bless you so much. I
[1:34:25] love you as you know all the time
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm saying I'm part of this church.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Who knows?
[1:34:36] God bless you.
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:43] I I I really appreciate uh brother
[1:34:46] Steve. He's a very humble brother, but
[1:34:48] he he took it personally.
[1:34:51] Um
[1:34:53] I believe it was it once a week or once
[1:34:55] a month? Once a month. Um and I want to
[1:34:59] say it's probably been at least a year.
[1:35:02] Uh once a month he would fast for the
[1:35:05] church and he would fast that uh God
[1:35:09] would open up a door for us. So he comes
[1:35:13] in this season to actually see God open
[1:35:16] the door.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Uh so his fasting was not in vain.
[1:35:22] And this is, like I said, it's just part
[1:35:24] of the journey. It's part of the
[1:35:26] journey. But we we we're grateful.
[1:35:28] Brother Tee uh told us that eventually
[1:35:31] them bombs gun go off.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And when one bomb go off, it sets
[1:35:36] another bomb. It sets off another bomb
[1:35:38] and it sets off another bomb where we're
[1:35:40] starting to see the bombs go off.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Right. So we uh we we're we're under
[1:35:45] Amen. Great expectation for all that God
[1:35:47] has in store. Uh so good to be here. I'm
[1:35:50] going to have brother teach come and
[1:35:51] close us uh in a word of prayer. And um
[1:35:55] uh brother Jonathan, do you want to say
[1:35:56] anything? You you got anything you want
[1:35:58] to say? I'm sure you do. I know you do.
[1:36:01] Come on. Come on. Amen. I got all these
[1:36:04] preachers in the house. Amen. If you
[1:36:08] don't say nothing but God bless you, say
[1:36:09] something.
[1:36:18] I know brother Jack knows better than to
[1:36:20] hand a mic to a preacher. Supposed to
[1:36:23] leave his thing on a stand, you know,
[1:36:26] but God bless you. Spirit and Truth
[1:36:29] Tabernacle,
[1:36:31] I cannot tell you how much we feel at
[1:36:33] home here. We love y'all. And uh
[1:36:38] I'll give a a quick testimony. So for
[1:36:42] the uh past Well, let me just back up.
[1:36:47] All of y'all know I'm a general
[1:36:48] contractor, I think. And uh so year of
[1:36:52] co 2020, we had like a phenomenal year.
[1:36:57] It was about this time uh yeah, 2020 had
[1:37:00] a phenomenal year. 2021 had a really
[1:37:03] good year with the business. We moved
[1:37:05] from one house to another house thinking
[1:37:07] we were going to remodel the house that
[1:37:08] we were moving into. And we were really
[1:37:10] planning on on using this place if if
[1:37:12] believers came in, it gave them a place
[1:37:14] to stay and and and that sort of thing.
[1:37:16] and uh 22 hit and um this was shortly
[1:37:20] after I was I was ordained and and
[1:37:22] started ministering. But uh Satan
[1:37:25] started attacking and I mean the our
[1:37:28] decline on the business I mean it
[1:37:30] started hitting hard by the time 23 hit
[1:37:33] like I had no work and I mean we were
[1:37:36] trying to figure out how to hold on to
[1:37:38] the house that we had just bought. Um,
[1:37:41] this moved right on into 24. And when I
[1:37:44] tell you, I mean, we were downsizing our
[1:37:47] cars. I mean, we were doing everything
[1:37:49] we could do to get rid of payments on
[1:37:51] things just so we could hold on. And it
[1:37:54] was like, I mean, I I was on my knees
[1:37:58] constantly, you know, just like, Lord,
[1:38:00] if I'm doing something wrong, if I did
[1:38:02] something wrong, you know, show me what
[1:38:04] it is so we can fix it, whatever. And
[1:38:06] and and
[1:38:08] this is a long story, but I'm going to
[1:38:09] make it short. I mean even to the point
[1:38:11] where my wife where she was working in
[1:38:13] three days I mean three times in one day
[1:38:16] the Lord told her to quit her job and I
[1:38:19] mean he would not allow her to work uh
[1:38:22] you know we we went for you know several
[1:38:24] months and she was like well maybe well
[1:38:26] maybe you needed to just to switch jobs
[1:38:28] so try to go back to work and I mean the
[1:38:31] he would just stop it immediately. I
[1:38:33] mean, her mom went in the hospital one
[1:38:34] time, right? I think it was the day she
[1:38:36] was supposed to start, you know, would
[1:38:38] not allow her to work. I couldn't get
[1:38:40] work. And it was like, what in the
[1:38:42] world's going on here? Just kept
[1:38:44] praying, praying, praying. And he would
[1:38:47] just give us just enough money to pay
[1:38:50] the bills. Just enough to pay the bills.
[1:38:53] So, we just kept, you know, and and of
[1:38:56] course, you know, it's causing stress
[1:38:58] here, but we just kept kept going. Kept
[1:39:00] going. And uh but this uh this past year
[1:39:07] 2025 hits.
[1:39:10] At first it started with her. She gets a
[1:39:13] phone call from a school um where she
[1:39:15] had gotten um um a lady that could not
[1:39:19] stand her at her old job. Could not
[1:39:22] stand her. Gave her a referral to
[1:39:25] another school. That school calls her.
[1:39:28] We didn't call them. They called her.
[1:39:31] And the Lord just opened that door up.
[1:39:32] More money, better hours. Boom. She got
[1:39:35] a job. And then all of a sudden, my work
[1:39:38] just started coming. And it started
[1:39:41] coming. I mean, I'm like booked all the
[1:39:43] way to the end of this year at this
[1:39:45] point, you know.
[1:39:49] And I was I was telling brother Jack and
[1:39:51] I think I told brother Jimmy, I was
[1:39:52] like, you know, when Job went through
[1:39:54] his trial
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; when he came out the other side.
[1:39:59] He didn't just get what he lost. He got
[1:40:04] double.
[1:40:06] So, as his brother was saying, I was
[1:40:08] prophesying, I'm getting double. I'm
[1:40:11] waiting for my double portion.
[1:40:14] So, I just want to thank the Lord for
[1:40:15] what he's doing for us and and we're
[1:40:17] we're working on our house now. So,
[1:40:20] hopefully in a a few months, you know,
[1:40:22] you guys want to come, come on, we'll
[1:40:24] have a room for you. God bless you.
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad he he caught
[1:40:33] that cuz I was thinking the same thing
[1:40:34] while brother Ben was preaching that Job
[1:40:36] got double and he he man that scripture
[1:40:40] that he read there out of Isaiah 61.
[1:40:42] I'll never look at that scripture the
[1:40:43] same way again. My brother teach, we're
[1:40:47] going to let you close us out in a word
[1:40:49] of prayer. And if you got something to
[1:40:50] say, say it, brother. Say it. Amen. But
[1:40:53] you can come and close us out tonight.
[1:41:02] God bless you. I greet you in the name
[1:41:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh the
[1:41:07] preacher has already preached. The
[1:41:09] testimony have already been said. So I
[1:41:12] will not hold you any longer. I will not
[1:41:15] be like Pharaoh. So I'll let you people
[1:41:18] I'll let the people of God go. Amen.
[1:41:22] So I have to bless you. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:26] Believe in the power of prayer.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] The the the prophet behind the pit has
[1:41:33] already prophesied. You know
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; he said the Lord is going to bless you.
[1:41:37] Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; God is not a man that he should lie.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Everything he said in his word, he's
[1:41:43] going to do it.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Just not to testify. Some of us we my
[1:41:49] name my name is Shaedi. So my second
[1:41:52] name is say which is a which is a Muslim
[1:41:55] name. So because my father my people
[1:41:58] they died Muslims. So we are pro light
[1:42:02] to the Islam you know we believe this
[1:42:04] message. Not only did we change to be
[1:42:06] Christian, but to be a message believer.
[1:42:09] So we've seen God move in our lives.
[1:42:12] We've seen the power of the God. We've
[1:42:14] seen the power of the Holy Ghost. We've
[1:42:16] seen so many wonders that the Lord has
[1:42:19] done. So I just want to say if he has
[1:42:21] done it for anyone else, he will do it
[1:42:23] for you.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Shall we just bow our heads and pray?

[1:42:46] Christians. Father, it is because of the
[1:42:49] power of the blood. Father we thank you
[1:42:51] for a precious prayer the banayiah
[1:42:53] father whom you have used tonight father
[1:42:55] to come and echo the words of eternal
