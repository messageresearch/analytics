of hand and praise this morning [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen you know the way that was going I thought it was going to be one of them good old-fashioned Pentecostal Services you know I don't know if y'all ever been in one of those service where the Holy Ghost just have his way and I would have just let him I would have just went back home with this little thought on my heart hey amen but I tell you what we appreciate brother Troy and his diversity and uh what what he brings to the body of Jesus Christ now I'm gonna try to sing this little song and if I just mess it up well it's gonna be all right amen but uh it's the little song that I've been it's been on my heart and I'm gonna sing what I know of it I've had some good days I've had some heels to climb I've had some weary days [Music] but when I when I look around no I think things over all of my good days I'll win my bad days I I won't complain sometimes the clouds hang low things I can hardly see the road I've asked the question Lord Lord why so much pain foreign but he knows knows what's best for me although my weary eyes [Music] sometimes the clouds hang low I can hardly see the road I'll ask the question Lord Lord why so much pain but he knows what's best for me he's been good to me I'll say thank you Lord foreign [Music] let's just get our Bibles out this morning it's good to be in the service of the Living God this morning it's just good to be back um home we're going to read from a couple of places in the scripture uh uh Genesis chapter 8 and then also Philippians chapter four we want to remember brother Jack and the saints that went up to Virginia to uh be a part of the ceremony there with Jack's uncle being the president of Hampton University so remember them in prayer I remember Uh Kevin in prayer he'll be traveling his first little trip uh by itself he went to Las Vegas and uh just remember him in prayer I just I've been having a real tough time so y'all just continue to keep me in prayer and you know you you know your children gonna grow up and uh you I guess you want them to stay young where you kind of you know keep them and like he told me we got to talking and he said well Dad you just you just want to just keep everybody in a little box you know it's like I don't really want to keep you in a box but I just like to see folks doing things a certain way and uh but you know as they get older you kind of lose that grip that control and you just kind of have to let them spread their wings even and it makes you do a lot of praying I tell you that you might miss a meal you might miss some sleep you know in the process because you know uh uh they don't they don't they don't perceive things on the same level that you perceive from being a parent I am a parent I'm not I'm not a child so you know and being a minister and being in the streets I just I just don't look at things the same way a lot of times that everybody else looks at things y'all bear with me a minute uh but uh I told him I said you know what I just pray that I'm I'm around when all of y'all have children you know so I could sit back on the wall and just watch how y'all raise y'all children you know I hope uh that they do a better job than I did I'm put up my quotes right uh because it's a lot that goes along um uh with raising children and and for one thing I have to say you know I'm a Christian parent I'm a Christian parent and so I'ma definitely do things uh from a Biblical standpoint and if people may not like it I don't care as as long as I know where I'm standing at in the world you know what people's thoughts and what how people perceive things it don't even bother me at this stage let me move on from that I didn't come to say that I do have a message this morning but y'all just pray for for my little brood and trust that uh God will get everybody on track amen Genesis chapter 4 but let's remember brother Jack he's he's been real busy and we bring greetings from uh South Carolina on last week uh we preached for brother Simmons and brother blue had a had a just a real wonderful outing and uh just remembers and prayer at the end of the month we supposed to be going to Georgia so uh just keep us in prayer if you don't see me I ain't backsliding I ain't quit if I do I y'all gonna be the first people I let know but as of now I'm still in the fight amen uh we still still pressing our battles uh Genesis chapter 8 we want to read the 20th verse there uh from the 20th verse if you have it say amen and Noah building an altar unto the Lord and took every every clean beast and every clean foul and offered burnt offerings uh uh on the altar and the Lord smelled a sweet a sweet Savior and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's Hearts is evil uh from his youth neither will I again Smite any more everything living as I have done while the Earth remained in seed time and harvest and cold and and heat and summer and winter and the day and night should not cease now let us look at another place in the book of Philippians just like to say we've we've appreciated the sermons that we've been hearing from our ministering Brothers uh uh we we missed the young Brothers and I had to go online to to get the sermons but I appreciate amen hearing the the younger group of ministers ministers uh Philippians chapter 4 verse 19 it says but my God shall have to apply all your needs according to his riches and in Glory by Jesus Christ amen let us buy our heads gracious father we just thank you this morning for your Amazing Grace and and how you brought us the thus far this morning and we just trust and depend on you this morning to see us through help us to just yield ourselves to the holy spirit that he could use the vessel I'm a man I'm full of uh uh weakness but Lord I'm strong in you we pray that you just have your way bless the Saints as they uh travel wherever they might be Virginia and my son on his way home from Vegas and uh just continue to have your way in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated um I would like to just use that as a little subject this morning as we just get settled uh the purpose of the crushing the purpose of the crushing um I just maybe want to start with a little side note this morning uh as as we we think about purpose for just a second as we just kind of build this morning uh I'd just like for us to understand some of the purpose of humanity and the purpose of God is totally totally different right and a lot of times you know you hear from people that's supposed to be uh worshiping and serving God you know to people a lot of times things in God don't matter right but but one of the things that that um I realize if if God has it in his word it's for a reason and it's it's it's I think it's essential things aren't something that we could push to one side and and just kind of and and I think that's what got the the world in in the condition that is in the religious world or the church world is we we we cultivate we we bring our own or we inject the word with our own personal theologies and meanings and things of that nature especially in the day that we're living in right you you could you could just see a deviation from from almost scripture all together uh we we I'm reminded that when Jesus Christ came on the scene uh the son of man Ministry uh one of the big rebukes he had was that it was just so much traditions and things that weren't even biblical that weren't that weren't even biblical that showed how the people had drifted we could we could see it we could see it down through the history of the church how the church drifted away from you know Christ which Christ is the word is that right and so I appreciate this morning God sending us a messenger to uh get us back to what's what's reality was was normal back to the precepts of God is that right Oh Glory to his wonderful name so you know um when when when when God implements something or God put something in play it's necessary it's necessary that you got a carburetor uh fuel injection in your car right amen those those things are necessary so this morning you know you you place little things in the into just the the heart and minds of people as as we cut continue to grow and mature in the things of God and and we hear the ministry we're here you know I I Shepherd uh make reference to things don't discount these things it's nothing because it's it's all necessary y'all keep that word it's it's all necessary and and it and it's all for a purpose to to fulfill God's purpose see I'm here this morning and you're here this morning to fulfill the purpose of God something that that's greater than all of our our Ambitions and different things that that you know we imagine and all of you know we go to school and we do all the types of things that we do but fulfilling to per the purpose of God man that that's on a greater scale right to think that you know what I was called out of the world and into Christ redemption in two places you just don't come out you got to go in somewhere right are you gonna be left out of where you're supposed to be going right you got it you gotta get in Christ not not just religion we don't just preach We Don't Preach the message as a religion or or some denominational something right we we preach the word of God to try to make sure that you're you're in in Jesus Christ and that and that's got to be the thing is that right amen you gotta get in Christ I believe that that's the thing that you know our Prophet uh was trying to do because if our approach is is just you know I'm identified with a certain church and I go here and I go there and I'm not in Christ you're not gonna make no Rapture like that is that right so when when we think about y'all just pray for me but when we think about the message of the hour right we we've got to keep in mind what what it what what's its purpose what is purpose has been I'm gonna move on for this in a minute but I'm just trying to get out out the way what is purpose has has meant to us as as uh believers right not to just be identified with just a random group of people but it's been a call out amen of the world and to get us into Christ now this is I guess kind of a Prelude because we know Easter is coming up and uh uh so I thought this a pre-easter Easter uh message to just kind of uh get out thinking uh going to a certain uh spot right now the the word the word crushing right is is rejection spiritual uh Devastation to squeeze or to force by pressure so as to alter or criticize him and and I want to I want to say something here too as I get started crushing is necessary right Crossing crushing crushing has value sometimes sometimes I think we we misunderstand we misunderstand God we we we don't fully understand the the process of growth right we think gross is just growth is just about you know just a happy good luck I wish it was that way Church but but sometimes we encounter devastating situations right uh uh spiritual altering situation naturally altered being being squeezed sometimes being rejected right but it's necessary because one of the things I'm reminded of brother Branham say character is a victory is that right amen glory to God so so you know sometimes a man it God watch this God sees a certain thing is necessary if I look at my life sometimes and I have been right I just sit back and I'm like what's this all about why why why you know but Bob say don't think it's strange but but sometimes when when you look at your life and you look at where you're at and you you look at your trials and the things that you you you go through you you gotta keep in mind right the purpose of God and God's seeing what you're going through as necessary because I'm quite sure you know Joe we know scripturally job was doing good job was wealthy job had a big name right Joe could walk through the community you know with his and then all of a sudden right his world was turned upside down and I'm quite sure from an intellectual standpoint even looking at his life right he probably figured like what you know when this one coming in with this report and this one coming in with this reporting desperately I'm quite sure he felt overwhelmed right and I'm quite I know for a certain of certainty he wasn't there in the conversation when when when God turned the devil loose on him because he would have been waited wait a way to wait a way to wait a waiter wait a wait a minute is there anybody else come on y'all know what I'm talking about we all haven't been there you know we didn't all had that why me moments y'all are preached with me I'm gonna have to put off my jacket I see now Y'all Gonna Make Me work cause y'all look like y'all gonna stare but I ain't gonna let you stare at me this morning for for an hour Y'all Gonna even preach so y'all gonna take it on the chin right not just a sense of humor okay I'm getting a little warm with that Jay you know you know you get to preaching you start getting nervous right but I'm just quite I'm quite sure you know with with the things that he was facing in his mind you know and I say this church don't think just because somebody's going through you know this this is our thing around church he must have did something she must have did some job didn't do anything but God saw it necessary to crush him right God that's powerful statement God saw that it was necessary to crush him right to to bring out something that was was was in him so it the crushing is necessary right see that that that's a benefit right come on Church when when we look at our life right and and and you know we see where where we're going right and and we we're going through things and we feel like you know you're being rejected right you you your place you're placed in these positions and places where you're being criticized and and and the pressure that we feel know that it's it's it's beneficial to you right amen and sometimes it just takes God to reveal to you why he's allowing you to go through this but it is necessary the flesh might say it's not necessary you know y'all know you you know how folk folk when they think about Christianity and how bad things happen to good people it is it ain't nobody good right that's none of us that good come on church I know y'all looking good this morning you probably fix yourself up but but at the core apart from God ain't none of us all that good right what what makes us what we are is that Christ lives in US because you know what if you take if you take the God out of us we'll do things that we wouldn't even want nobody to even know we'll do things in the shadows that we wouldn't even want nobody to know is that right glory to God come on church and probably we'd undone things that man we don't want nobody to know right so so you know it ain't it ain't our goodness it's not our righteousness it's Christ right it's Christ it's Christ alone it's Christ that makes us who we are right uh let's let's kind of uh continue to move move along right one of one of the things we we got to keep in mind um we we know that God brought the world forth in in a perfection right everything was in a Harmony everything was in a Oneness everything was in divine order boy I tell you whoa we don't hardly know nothing about that because our eyes a lot of time is chaotic and and no order and it just takes the Holy Spirit to uh balance this out that's I don't care who you are and how long you've been serving whether you're a preacher things of that nature it still takes the Holy Spirit to bring balance is that right listen to church this is just a gift y'all don't I mean you paid me some mind but you don't pay me no mind right because I'm a human being right and and my gift is just to express something that that'll help us on the journey that we on right but but you know what I understand the crushing this morning I'm not just preaching y'all an intellectual level we're gonna go somewhere this morning right I ain't got there I don't want to get ahead of myself but but we know it went from this masterpiece this perf uh perfect State this the state of innocent to to uh a state of of Chaos right uh uh uh I mean let's look at the Scripture it had got so bad now this is bad to where God just wanted to wipe the whole thing out for which God repents that he ever made man that's pretty rough we talked we talking about a sovereign God uh an infinite God that that that uh knew all things right that's the thing that makes an innocent that he knew the condition that it would get in but when it got in that condition he looked at it like man I made that Glory I can't I created no he didn't I mean what he created in the beginning it was Perfection but after the fall and the second Covenant uh uh through through you know uh man and woman coming together and that was Connor but you know it all had a purpose to fulfill the word of God is that right amen but you know God God started out this way but then because of the the cruelty of sin sin is cruel all right when when we look at let's you know sometimes I think we we got to take the blinders off we we get we become Christians and we walk around with blinders on right because because we're a Christian just as some of us may not have been as bad as others but but just sometimes uh just look at the sin that still in our life God just God just don't there's a blood bumper there right come on Church y'all don't quit on me I know y'all like shout messages but uh I'm gonna let you shot in a minute somewhere I guess right uh I just like the I like realist realistic type preaching now I like the faith and I like all of that but I I'm just a senior now I'm a senior so I do things a little bit different okay so y'all just have to like Paul said bear with me and all of my Folly and all of that kind of stuff but I'm not here to hurt us let's keep that in mind but I I I got a message this morning I'm trying to get to okay uh uh but the crushing it's the crushing it is so necessary right it's it's we we all I believe need we all need a little bit of crushing because some of us egotistical uh some of us we we got so much going on me brother smiley Go kids yourself right one of the things that I'm learning in life is to to uh look at yourself and face yourself in the mirror and and just say this is who I am right now I'm I'm not defined by this but but this this is maybe who I I was this is maybe where I am but you also you got to see yourself on on a journey right uh going to a place of perfection never be defined by your present state right never be defined by and this this is a good statement for our younger generation right never allow your mistakes to Define you never allow your mistakes let me break it down a little bit further for them uh to say this is who you are your mistake is just what it is it's a mistake it's not something that uh you willfully do sometimes it's just something that you know uh by being a little bit immature and not so much developed even us 50 year olds and 60 year olds too but I'll leave that alone um but never allow yourself to be defined by by the things that you you may do that you know sometimes maybe your parents don't agree with or the pastor may not agree with or something of that nature but but understand something that you're you're you're on your way to a place of maturity you're you're developing is that right so so you know uh the cruelty of sin because of this the fall the fall amen brought forth Sin Sin crew right sin is crew and but there has to be a a price paid to rinse it right that they had to watch I like I I really enjoyed looking at the sovereignty of God and the Mystery of God constantly unfolding itself through scripture it was it was necessary right it was necessary that God's came down and veiled himself in in human skin is that right because you know after the fall you know God dressed the church a certain way and all of that but it was a temporarily something that he did the the under the laws and things of that nature you know bulls and goats it just kind of covered over it never would have brought back a perfection right and and you know I I like him staying uh Redemption when we think about Redemption Redemption is taking us back to the beginning back to an original state is that right back to a perfection right back to uh uh original place that we stood in right like Adam having having dominion and things of that nature the abstract he could speak he could say I don't sometimes I don't even know if we fully understand what has has already taken place in US life Endeavors in the power of a is that right and sometimes we we speak a lot of things and we we give life to it by our voice by what we say right glory to God uh but let's all be realistic we gotta keep in mind that that we in this house and that's where our war is because we flash we you know we try our own beings and things that are in the flesh there's a war that we had a contest this morning is that right come on Church we're in a contest and as much as we want to speak the word of God that that's a that's a real battle and there's a real war that's going on in this inside of us that that causes us sometimes to speak you know the devil's language instead of speaking faith that I gate right what what we see those things don't even matter as it relates to faith in the word faith in the promise what's been given to us I'm starting to feel good now but see amen you know God God knew that it was necessary right glory to God God knew that it was necessary that he come down to perform the work of redemption right because let's I'm gonna tell you something we needed blood we we need it we need it something to to to wash the individual that would wash because the second work of Grace right happened at Calvary Oh Glory to God right go back to Future home where brother Brandon talked you know those three stages of Grace right amen it showed him spilling his blood right as the second stage of grace to the Natural Earth it's got another stage that's coming it won't be warned uh but fire next time right just to read the whole thing is that right right but listen um in the sovereignty of God it took something to read set right because up on the bulls and goats they will make those offerings every year and then they would go back and they would have to come back right and they would listen under the blood of of sheeps and Bulls and all that that was no real change right there was no real change in the individual anything to really speak about the thing was just covered so that they didn't get wiped out as long as they didn't do the same thing before the next you know uh time of offering is that right glory to God Amen but but God's amen uh wanted to come forth to to make an offering once and for all right one time to make a difference right to to bring about uh a change is that right Oh Glory to his wonderful name I got some quotes here I'm gonna read them in a minute but I'm feeling good I feel I'm feeling good this morning right because of the cruelty right and sin has been cruel and and I don't know about you this morning but I thank God for being under the blood of Jesus Christ I thank God for being a Christian this ain't this is not uh a mistake or anything I'm here this morning by the grace of God I was telling brother Troy this morning it's just something about Sunday morning man I just can't hardly wait for the church doors to open brother Capers they be laughing at me because I'd be zooming past them on my way to church try just trying to get here I can't say I all the time be feeling good but there's something way deep down on the inside of the inside of the inside that it just it just propels me it put it pushes me I can't rest I can't sleep some of y'all y'all like to rest and sleep you know I just yeah I just I just can't hardly do it when it's time to go to church it's time to go to church because I'm a needy person I just need whatever God's got for me whatever kind of word that God has for me like I say if it's one of these young fellas or whatever it might be I just need to eat is that right I I need I need to eat I don't know about y'all but I need to eat it ain't there well Jesus no I need to eat I need to eat something bloody right like one of the brothers said in Canada one time we went over there kill any eight some bloody is that right something that's gonna give me that something to help me to uh uh press forward right but in in the mind of God in the purpose of God Calvary was so necessary right it it was so necessary watch this because of the scripture and I read a subscription I know they seem like they randomly they're not random right because God promised and and we we look at this scripture and and we think it just relates to tangible things well some of y'all millionaires and y'all don't need money I thought I'd get a laugh about y'all something hey I know some of y'all some of y'all got plenty of money in the bank you know y'all good you know plenty of steaks in the freezer you know somebody gotta eat some chop steak you know some bugger and some of some of us got big t-bones and and and them big uh what what's them not a real big Quarter House and and it's a bigger one in the quarter house it's it's a it's that real big big one boy and Walmart cost by thirty dollars I tried that once or twice boy that thing were good too that's just one of the moments where God blessed me bless me bless me y'all gonna make me have trust by myself up in here this morning yeah yeah like I told her saying something wrong I said y'all just got to ride with me when I ride when I when I say y'all got to start rocking y'all so relaxing praise the Lord y'all got a rock with a preacher now I'm not brother Andrew you know I can't do all that spinning around and all that copy the toast up by the socket I'm already hunting but y'all just like y'all know I'm a racist Virginia said Virginia turned 60. right we you know sometimes we we gotta you know I'll be I'll be so I'll be like Lord God I'm embarrassed I'll be in the restaurant sometime I gotta turn a certain way and rock and push but I'd be like well I'm getting it grocery but it's hurting it hurt they need to make them towels a little bit higher or something I see y'all bouncing off them chairs all I can do is give and praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm in chess Jesus y'all be up jumping and shouting and with that praise the Lord because I get up I need to stay up for a minute because if I go down I ain't getting right back up y'all like little yo-yos right here I remember those days I remember them days but Troy but praise the Lord hey man I'm gonna find something that's gonna help me out to give me that right now I'm annoying it so ain't no telling what I might do right right amen but let's look at let's look at the crud it was it was so necessary that he crushed him I I got a maybe a quote I'm gonna read this like a preach this message without reading but uh I'ma do it this way right uh brother Brown said he said he was he was just talking about the incident that he had where uh the sickness came you know through town and it took out it took out um his wife his first wife and his baby girl right and and God allows his service to go through some stuff now believe me God God allowed her and especially you know especially when when you you're disobedient to the word of God don't think that because you're a preacher and we exempt now ain't no exemption right no God will allow you to go through different things but but also God God knowing what kind of ministry that he was going to have just like Paul Paul said you know a messenger uh was given to him to Buffet him because of the abundance of Revelation I'm gonna make us real strong statement because we like to be excited about the revelation but what what we don't realize what goes along with the revelation right so sometimes we think God is like I got to keep you down here because if I don't you get lifted up and you'll get out of place and you'll do more damage with the revelation is that right because you know you'll be fussing and arguing and thinking you all smart right but God God allows things to happen to keep you in a spot where he could deal with you where he can use you right God knew what he was going he was going to give this this Prophet um this ministry right but he had to be in the right state come on Church the condition at the right the right kind of character had to be on display in order for God to be able right because God don't change and the thing that you know brother Branham makes this reference to is that he he was looking back at Paul and what Paul taught he taught right and then under this Eagle anointing he had to realize God having to do certain things because it was a whole lot of Revelation that he was going to receive not for himself but for the amen this portion of the head part of the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right and so you know uh the prophet was told of the kind of ministry that he was going to have and how he was going to you know pray for Pope takes him monarchs and just great people right but then his daddy-in-law talk came in and told look well you ain't gonna take my if you take my daughter and you ain't gonna do that that's why I'm gonna tell you something his parents you just need to be careful right when it comes to spiritual things just just be especially when your kids is growing up spiritual you'd be supportive because it's just like you know Joseph in the scripture when he brought the dream to his parents they were looking at him in front of that oh and his brother and them oh he think he's something y'all know how we do we still do the same thing right we still do it's like oh he think he's so no it was just he couldn't help that God had a matter of purpose for his life is that right amen and that he would be in a position to be a blessing for his parents but they thought that he was just trying to be a man a spot at it right but but you know here brother Brown he he's talking about the situation that happened he said he said I had done everything that I know he he said he said I took a gun and tried to commit suicide what that was the human part right that was the crushing God had the crush his servant right oh glory to God he felt like committing suicide he says I was in such a time and it was at that hour in that little room up there on my knees the heavens because at one point he said it seemed like God had pulled the shade down God wasn't hearing it but now at this point he said it felt like having that opened up but that makes a difference if you ever been that way you feel like God don't hear you it makes a difference knowing that God hears your prayer Oh Glory to God maybe I'm the only one that been there oh Hallelujah but he said the whole the heavens opened back and he said I saw her standing there in the Splendor immortality it was in that hour that I felt her arms come around my shoulders said bill you don't have you you don't understand we're in a much better off than you he said it takes watch this it takes a crucifixion right it takes a crushing of the flower to bring the perfume see the question brings out something so the Crescent is necessary it's not just that God is doing something randomly no the crushing is necessary right is it you know uh some of us probably got on cologne or perfume this morning right nobody okay don't be scared praise the Lord what's well in order to get that something had to be crushed right something had to be crushed to make the thing that we spray or we rub in or the the essential oils these things come from something right it comes from materials that could be crushed and made into something that we could walk around and somebody say girl you smelling good s with me come on I'm gonna go somewhere with that statement now right it see let me keep on of this and then I get on to that right um he said uh it takes the crushing of the flower to bring perfume from it it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of out of that right there is see God has to sometimes crush us because God knows what's in there right and God knew that it was it was necessary is that right for you to be crushed in order to get what's in there out that was there's no other way is that right there's no other way glory to God see the crushing of a life the crushing of a life right hell digs everything that we needed was in Christ right come on church but Christ had to be crushed say that again Christ had to be crushed so the thief that was in Christ could be released we still preaching this morning see it was no good just being in Christ like that he had to be crushed for a purpose we still working I ain't gonna let y'all in on it all at one time yet but I'm still feeling good right so so it's it's you know we we could we could be be cuddled or we could be spiritual we could look at our situations present tense and and assess these these states commonly Are Spiritual right we we could see because we always say that devil the devil but we give the devil too much credit right amen a lot of times we don't see God in things see the screws say it pleased God to to bruise to crush his son I was pleased see y'all thank God be somewhere in the cut crying cause you being crushed no God be looking at that situation you know what when it's all said and done he's gonna be on a whole nother level she's gonna be on a whole nother level right glory to God glory to God I mean I know as human beings we have a tendency of feeling sorry for one another that's a good thing right that's a good thing and we supposed to be compassionate you know but but you know I sometimes you you look at yourself and you realize it was necessary not unless you're not in your right mind come on because because a lot of times right we think more highly of ourselves than we ought to come on church can I get one witness lights preach with me huh this is the truth right sometimes we feel like we're we're better individuals and we're better Christians than we really are we easily lie to ourselves come on Church well I'm gonna give this mic to somebody because y'all y'all ain't ready for this y'all ain't ready for this it's the truth sometimes you just got to bring us right down to reality right it's the truth Church amen why wha watch watch our lives a lot of times come on like preach with me watch our lives watch our conversations watch what we do watch how we handle one another come on church and then then we we come in and we act we act holier than loud praise God ah it's the truth amen we we act we act a certain we act a certain way is that right glory to God and then we come and we shout the building down we we shout over things and God say you know what I gotta crush them just a little bit more to get them to this place amen of perfection this place of maturity glory to God it's not for evil but God God I'm gonna make a statement it's gonna be a strong God wants us to be realistic in this season that we in realistic with ourself come on realistic with ourself right because it's easy to shout over a whole lot of stuff right but these messages like this ain't hard it is hard to shout over this you got to be you got to be a real Christian to say Amen is that right come on but I'm not saying it to be be ill I'm just on a thought it don't even you know right but but I know where I am right as as a person and I realize how the crushing is necessary right the question is the crushing is so necessary for your state for your elevation for the way that we think as Christians I'm not dealing with the world I'm talking about Christianity right because listen you know we're God's mouthpiece we're God's voice we're salt we're we're the light we're supposed to be all of this right that's a part of the plan of God but we got to be that in the right state right come on Church your co-workers can't see you acting one way come on you going off for everybody on the job huh you misusing words and everything yeah well I've gone on I thought they said they probably be Christian that the first thing you know what drunks don't even go to church and everything else but they can tell you what what they know what a Christian's supposed to be when they see us acting up and acting out your children too come on preach with me parents your children have something she jumping around he jumping around not even when the pastor preached glory to God I'm trying to go somewhere I need more time Oh Glory to God amen so he says it takes a question of your life to get the bad think about that to get the best out of it that there is God wants to get the very best that there is out of us see God ain't into halfway anything right God wants to get the very best out of us right so sometimes God has to crush us right amen bring us to that place and keep that in mind that's the there's a reason God saw that it was necessary right all I can say is just keep praying for me I'll keep praying for you right because if you're going through something God saw that it was necessary for you to go through that is that right glory to God amen that's just God's provided way amen so he says the reason Jesus had to be Jesus had to be and if Jesus had to be we have got to be also crushed right Amen to bring forth what he was he could not uh he could not stand before the cruises fixing to say all power is in heaven and earth is given unto my hand but after the crucifixion power with our wish we know he was he was the epitome of all character but but God thought that it was the appropriate thing right to allow him to go see even when when Peter Peter was like boy ain't letting you go through that you can't stop it this is necessary it's it's it's necessary for for the people that that will come on the scene this Gentile church it was Nest it was necessary for the Old Testament Church but it was also knowing that we were coming right and and what what we would need and what we would need it was necessary right I ain't I ain't gonna ain't gonna hold y'all long I know y'all got me up here a little late but I ain't gonna hold y'all okay I know you can't stop it brother but Jack said don't stop the singing so you know so can I preach about two more hours don't stop the preaching either no just give it give me about 10-15 minutes that'll be okay I was like I was sitting there like Chuck give me that mic right now you y'all would change the songs and then bring me up bring me up on a song that's jumping that's what future future reference don't change it when it's jumping bring me out on the Jump part don't let me happen to start over like hey you bring me in with it no it didn't do it drop it into a bit now that in his fault I understand brother be having a good time okay so he says but what what it did it taken a crucifixion fiction first is taking the crushing and the a disappointing pointing of the Apostles they had seen their savior the the one they had loved they seen him even raise up from the dead from the grave they had seen him do that and then to think think it was necessary it was so necessary that that they they were part of that see that was a part of their transformation right glory to God Amen it was what God had a lot see the shepherd was smitten the Sheep took off right that's why you got to pray for a shepherd right because because unfortunately we won't be who we are apart from a shepherd it's so necessary I don't need no Pastor oh yes you do don't tell that lie and you you need you need a pastor and a building that you could go to not unless you physically unable you know I know I know I thank God for technology don't don't misunderstand me but I think technology has made people lazy and and it just really shows maybe maybe what we thought was a birth maybe it wasn't a bird because brother bear said when a person get the baptismal they can't hardly wait to go sit up in the living room on the couch um come on Church now it's good for you know we got elderly people we got such addiction and some of the ones that's the you know you have to you has go all Sister Sister Capers she's been going through but she's never missed a beat right man I I remember a couple of months ago when we went to Carolina to brother Fred and I heard I ain't tell them this I'll say another when they said they were going out like oh God they going to South Carolina right but I got to realize who I'm talking about I'm telling my brother and sister capers right but I mean you know just on the heels of you know her going through but I'm like well if she got a favor to go to him but Perry praise the Lord and they beat me there and they were shouting having a good time you know come on see that that's a if if anybody got a right to sit home on the couch it would be somebody like sister Capers with all of the physical ailments but she take them physical ailments and walk them right into church [Applause] bring them right here into the presence of God realize that one day all of them Elmer's got to go I'm Gonna Keep I'm gonna keep taking all of this right into the presence of God right glory to God he says watch this um in the cruelty of sin and the penalty is is the quote 1953 I think it's called eight he said God made every individual here go home tonight with this on their mind thinking of what a sacrifice what did it cost to redeem I'll tell you what that that'll do something to your spirit what did what did it cost God it never cost us nothing because we didn't have what it we didn't have what it took the redeem us only he could redeem us come on somebody but it cost God his son it cost God the greatest Price it cost Christ his life what he was the Rose of Sharon but to get the perfume out the rose you had to crush it his beautiful life was crushed out of young man of 33 years old right but but because of of a need being met and and the precepts and the ordinance of God God knew and and listen brother Brandon makes a statement in Christ the mystery he says if you cannot see Christ in every line everywhere in the scripture she said go back and read it again because you don't miss something is that right and see listen God God knew right I got a quote in here that we were we were smelly we were stinky that's what the quotes read right and we needed amen a perfume right if if we think about you know uh the Old Testament and and how things were done you know uh uh uh you walking through you know Dusty dirt with your little sandals on and you get to somebody's house you knew that that you were you were welcome because they would have a foot wash flunking standing at the door to take what was crushed huh yeah to take what to take what was crushed and utilize that to make you welcome a fellowship amen glory to God to make you work this this says you welcome see there was Christ at one time was was given an invitation to come to a man of Fellowship but he got there and he wasn't made welcome now y'all gonna preach with me he wasn't made welcome but but in the sovereignty of God didn't ordain a potent tank he didn't oppressed with it uh just a prostitute huh amen a prostitute somebody who understood what it was like to be crushed did her status probably was talking about the women wouldn't wash with her foreign she understood the crushing being rejected huh the glory to God feeling feeling the squeeze of society and and knows is being turned up when you know your press is coming people crossing over yeah you know glory to God but she saw amen the king of kings and the Lord of Lord she saw the savior unwelcome and everybody people Point takes and everything was made welcome but he was in a position a place where he wasn't welcome he was bought there for for a joke right amen and and she took her earnings that that she had earned you know for a living the way that she earned it y'all know the story went and got an alabaster box look she ain't gonna get no sheep she went and got some real expensive amen uh uh cologne something that had went through a well praise the Lord somebody something that why [Applause] Why Y'all Gonna Make Me preach up in here she was crushed he was crushed it was Crush huh for the work of redemption that's a whole lot of crushing ain't it that's a whole lot of question he had to be crushed because of what he was see he represented himself amen as the Rose of Sharon and and to get the perfume out right it had to be crushed to get to get those these oils they something has to be crushed and mix right look in the Old Testament with with when God set up the priesthood order which is a type of Christ right God had it standard and ordinances right for you know they had to be a appropriate way is that right that that had been made for Aaron to be able to go into the presence of God come on well I tell you what God's provided where it's up man amen he went in with Christ all over him and representation right the Rose of Sharon right now or it was poured see you gotta see you can't go into the presence of God any old kind of way you got to go in anointed all right that high priest went in anointed right oh I'll just huh oh glory to God kings were anointed something had to be crushed though to produce what was necessary right I like you know you even think about the story of David if something happened to been crushed right amen he he wouldn't have been anointed that was just God's provided way right so the crushing was necessary because in Christ was everything that's necessary is that right amen because you know y'all y'all know y'all don't like folk around y'all smelling let's be real Let It Be Real let it be real because if a bump come out here and he you know I've been way way back in the day and and Okeechobee this this fell on or whatever happened to him brother came from no I'm talking about he used to come he was a hobo he will come through and Lord Jesus Hallelujah glory to God that man used to be like and he come in and you see full scooting over you couldn't hardly blame him because you couldn't hardly take the smell that man smelled like Outdoors a thousand days with no baths right but he was a good good-hearted good nature got over right but man I tell you who you just want to bathe just bathe get in the water and let me just pour all this on you huh but that's but but we don't realize that's what God has done for us is that right because sometimes sometimes we don't smell ourselves but God does God does God smell us so we thank God for the anointing one more comment I'm gonna get out of here right especially especially in the age and hour that we're living in right we're living in and we kind of I've been making little references here and there this is the age of anxiety right and and like we said a while back a lot of this anxiety is is self-inflicted because uh some of it is because folks be smoking that stuff with all this Tac in it come on eating all these Edibles and all of this stuff that's altering their their mental state glory to God this stuff is dangerous this this stuff is you know y'all know what I'm talking about some of y'all used to smoke weed back in the day yeah I know I wasn't the only one praise the Lord I ain't gonna look up Jesus all right all we did was want to go laugh and eat huh let me eat oh we got the munches we want we everything was funny and we wanted to go some get some chips and soda knee-high sodas and Candy just munch and laugh now this stuff be having these folk like zombies huh you smoke something you just sit there you can't move who wants something foolishness like that but it's a I mean it's some good in this stuff now and Tac and some of this stuff is good I ain't gonna say it's all bad I guess if it's regulated by a doctor I'll say that I I don't want none of that but you know you you don't want to take it off the shelf if it's if it's necessary because people have cancers people have got extreme pains that sometimes they they you know I'll leave that alone I ain't gonna tell y'all what to do just I'll tell you to be lay to God I want y'all looking at me funny now I ain't scared yeah I'm not really scared but it's the truth anyhow right if if you get severe enough pains they they might prescribe some of that now that's up to you I ain't gonna tell nobody I ain't giving nobody no open door to smoke nothing I just stop right there and leave that alone I'll let the pastor deal with that right if he choose not to but I'm going somewhere with this right because he's the Liliana Valley right and and brother bam said it's it's like an opium all right and we get some of this stuff in pain medication now come on don't think y'all just be feeling good to be feeling now it's something that that you don't took that make you feel good come on it's it's these these leaves that's been crushed that's been placed in there so that you don't feel nothing all right so you can feel good y'all had operations y'all got Mr feel good for when these people come they're cutting carved on you you need something to ease the pain right come on Church amen the ease it something to put you to sleep see that these things on a spiritual note was represented in Christ right in his crushing and how necessary when when the the people in this state living in such fear such anxiety you know people don't know what to do caught up in politics all of this stuff is just making people crazy weird uneasy right but you get in Christ right you the the opium that gives you rest right I don't know about y'all I know what it's like not to be able to go to sleep huh worried about this and you worry about that if you if you're a parent you know what I'm talking about you don't know what you don't know what your children are you don't know what they're doing come on Church amen glory to God you don't know if you're gonna have a job tomorrow if it puts you in a state where you you feel a little bit on edge and like they say well I just need to be able to take the edge off see come on well I take the edge off right when I come in here I'm coming in here to get the opium I'm coming in here to get the dope I'm a dope fiend huh I'm a dope fee and I and I need something to take the edge off cause I don't want to go crazy I Don't Wanna Lose My Mind I need my little mind I need I need something to take the edge off right glory to God so that I come to church amen and I get my little dope and I going on to the house what about smiling going to the house he didn't got he done got what he needed he going on to the house he'll be back on Wednesday to get another fix by Sunday he'll need another fix y'all might know what I'm talking about I come here to get my fix I'm a dope addict and I'm happy about it I'll tell the world I'm a dope addict this different dope dope I don't want that that I used to have I like this kind of drug it keep me calm because if it wasn't for it I'd be a crazy man right about now glory to God you look at your life sometimes you just throw your hands up yeah you don't have not one answer Lord and I stopped trying to even figure it out because God got a plan God got a plan God always had a plan you know I said it God knew back in 1997 when I took over the oak uh the barbecue Tabernacle God already knew the day of the hour that that Locker be turned on that door for the last time he knew the very minute the very date of every hour that that motorcycles would be up in the building huh glorious God knew that knew that even before I even knew it God God knew it it wasn't by chance but to fulfill a purpose God saw that it was necessary God started just maybe brother Smiley needed a little question is that right to get him in a place where he becomes more anointed more powerful demons tremble when they see him come in the building right is that right glory to God glory to God amen see I might look I might have looked at it one way but then but then you know having opportunity and time to just meditate and and think on my ways it it opens up to me a real reality is that right a real reality church and I'll say this and I'm gonna get ready to go you know I you start you start looking at yourself even from your roles I started realizing some some things over over the last few months and stuff like but it's a whole lot that goes along with with uh manhood marriage parenting and I'm gonna tell you something you got to be on your A-game you can't be on your C game come on yo d game no it ain't gonna work uh you you folk folk I look back on my life and and I look back and I was like well I was a real naive fella I I didn't really have a clue I'm telling you can I be real about five minutes and I'm saying this for the young fellas that ain't married yet and the younger ones that he is married yet you gotta constantly educate yourself right and and and and a whole lot more than just scripture I'm telling you charge because you can go in that same thing if I Holy Ghost feel fine about ties right it's the same way brother Branham makes a statement by y'all a nice group but he ain't gonna let you stay stay that way you can start out good but he trying not to let you stay that way is that right you I I learned so I just sitting back you know looking at things and and having time to meditate and look at the Holy Spirit I started realizing you know what my approach to to marriage I didn't know what I was doing really I I didn't know I didn't even have a clue of the road that I was traveling right I couldn't see the journey I couldn't see where I was going at in the thing right I'm crushed for the purpose of somebody else purpose right because let's face it we're starting to see more divorces around the message than we ever have come on everywhere you turn somebody's going through something somebody this is somebody's death right and just maybe God allow you know me to go through different things just to be able to help somebody else down the road because when all they told us is that but get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost well there was a whole lot more that we needed once we did get the Holy Ghost as a man as women right glory to God glory to God we needed something that when the devil started attacking that we were on a level mentally spiritually to overcome to lead to lead to lead to be a leader something deeper than just being able to put five quotes together and come stand in the Pulpit you need a whole lot more than that when the devil start walking in your house when the devil say it's your fault yeah I would say it's your fault and that's as a man I'm gonna tell you something it's going to be your fault because God hold you responsible no matter what no matter she could be wrong it's two left shoes she gonna be just as guilty she could be just as wrong as two left shoe God is going to look at you and say boy you should have known what you were doing now I'm just I'm just on the surface right now this boy I got a whole lot huh I got a whole lot I ain't the difference I ain't the same person I was amen two years ago I ain't the same person I was six months ago is that right glory to God you you you you you gotta get on a level mentally you gotta understand some stuff being be in a place that you could stand at the door and say I'm the God here and and you know what nothing has access into this house that ain't God sometimes you got to take the you got to take the wrong amen for the right being a man you could be right as right and left shoes but you might sometimes have to take the wrong like two left shoes y'all know two left shoes is wrong is wrong wrong put on y'all know you see little kids around there the shoes on the wrong feet and all that you'd be like really okay and that's something so tell us what it's got to be well I tell you what church you know we we we're at a place uh sister Brothers can make your way uh we had a place I got a whole lot I kind of bunched this up a little bit I just I got a lot ball up inside of me you know a lot that I want a lot that a lot that I I I want to relate right uh but because it's the truth it's it's a lot a lot going on and it's it's more people going through struggles and things of that nature and I'm gonna tell you something folk need somebody with some skills right something more than a message of uh you need the Holy Ghost I remember my kids were home and they would go to youth meetings and they used to come home and they should be Dad we Tyler just we're just tired of hearing they probably they probably didn't have what they thought they had but that's another another something but we we need we need something more than just you know the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost we need information [Music] we need real real information that's going to help us to grow up to be real adults in Christ so when we come in contact with people we got something to talk about [Music] right amen you know it's a real tough job I'm telling you church and and sometimes you know being a pastor you you you you you could preach a sermon and preach sermons and you could get so caught up in in church and church folk and you realize man my family just went so lacking because you put everything into trying to keep the church going trying to keep everybody else in life and your family is falling completely apart completely apart one thing I could say I was faithful I was there I did the very best I can but sometimes I look I put too much energy in the in the church and church folk and everything else is that right I don't think I ever passed again and but if I do it'll be a lot of changing because I believe that that I've grown up my children are grown but you know I got a grandbaby coming amen and and I still got children I got three boys at home and and uh you know just taking the opportunities to because your children they can always be your children they're gonna always be needy and I just want to be able to have what they need the information to be able to sit down and have real conversation real adult conversation not well you know you out there smoking that weed they know they smoking weed they'll need you to tell them that every time you see them but you still getting hot yeah they're getting high you know that and they know that but they don't they need something more from you than a criticism right and sometimes that's why they don't come because they know that's all they're gonna get is the criticism why are you doing it you still doing that what is this instead of instead of us being uh open and in spiritual and on a level to learn how to communicate I'm learning how to communicate with my with my with my adult children it's hard but I tell you what one thing and I'm gonna go one thing that makes it easy for me easier it ain't easy easy but it's easier I have to look back and realize boy what were you doing when you were 17. what were you doing when you were 20 21 and 22 how are you acting how did you conduct yourself and somebody else house what were you doing with your finances I had to I have to think I'll keep all of these things into consideration and when I
