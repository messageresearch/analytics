amen it's a it's it's it's this song is the is the Christians Anthem and I'm pretty sure that as all of us can look back in our lives we can see that it was nothing but Grace uh not how good you were not how much you knew uh there's a lot of people in the world that that know a lot about the Bible they know a lot about the message uh they know a lot about the things of God but it's uh it's Grace to know God to have a relationship with him right and the only reason that God can come down and have a relationship with you see I like to look as God not as a god he's a prideful not pride in the in the sense of being like a negative Pride but he only respects himself so the only way he could have a relationship with me and you is if we were in him before the foundation of the world so we're not just walking on this Earth as human beings right God has his eyes on us all right so I kind of glad we sang that song because it kind of fits into the message of today um I previously preached on the um uh this expectation series that I've been uh we've been having and this is a closing message to that so we've gone through the valley uh we've got our expectations in the battle and uh the title that the Lord lord gave me today was uh expectations in Perfection and so you always have to end things with perfection because that is the plan in the mind of God Amen so we're going to go right to the scripture readings for this uh our first scripture reading is going to come out of Matthew 5 verse 48 and just say Amen when you get there amen and it reads be ye therefore perfect even as your father which in heaven is perfect and I love this Bible verse it's very very very uh uh uh I like how it's it's instructing someone right because uh uh Perfection is an expectation of God and God loves to be around things that are perfect nothing else will suffice so here God is giving instructions of course this Jesus Christ giving instructions he said be therefore perfect even as your father so there we find that our Perfection we have identity in the father and he saidh he wasn't just a father from any place he said he was from Heaven all right amen so we have identity through this Father which is in heaven who is perfect and that's where our Perfection lies on we're not just living down on Earth trying to be good people or be good Christians or say that we've uh uh we've done all these things for the Lord no we are perfect and if our if we are to be perfect as our heavenly father as perfect it means that we've already been perfect amen no matter what we're going through all right we're going to read our second Bible verse in uh The Book of Proverbs it's going to be uh chapter 24 verse 16 and we're just going to read the uh this uh statement until about the middle of it it says for just man falleth seven times and riseth up again and we know that the prophet also had said uh uh that a righteous man falls seven times uh but Rises up again and we know that the righteousness is not based off of us but of God you may take your seats it's based off of God's righteousness right amen so it's kind of it's kind of funny to see this statement uh because we know that the word of God was God's word and it was his word before the foundation of the world where he was telling us to be perfect but here he's saying that a just man falls seven times so how can you be perfect and fall all right how can you be perfect and fall all right right uh uh and there lies a mystery of what Perfection is so Perfection is the ultimate goal in a Christian's life uh it's the state that we're trying to get back to we've gone through the expectations in the battle we've gone through the expectations in the valley uh and and that's all just for us to see to understand and to appreciate what Perfection is right so our first expectation of perfection is just that to understand what it is and it's not through a conceptual thought or some theology or some fancy words but your Perfection will come through your life and what you've lived and that will allow you to appreciate it right because people get perfection stumbled up as if it's something that you have to do right so you have a lot of people that join church because oh well I want to get to heaven oh I have to be a good person I can't lie I can't steal I can't cheat I got to wear a long skirt I got to do all these things and though those things are signs of perfection it's not Perfection itself amen it is not Perfection itself you see Perfection isn't something that you're necessarily trying to get really Perfection is something to be appreciated because you haven't gained Perfection you've already had it but now God wants you to appreciate what it is that's why I love the song uh growing up with my um when I was growing up with me and my little sister and we would go over our dad's he would play the CD by uh sister Brenda Lewis and there was a song on there that said you've already made it that's something that kind of uh I I still have remember the lyrics to it amen and and and I like how she was able to catch the anointing of God to know that Perfection is is is is happening now it's and it's always been and it's and it's not something that you've you've uh uh you've gained through being good or or or a service for God but because God loved you before the foundation of the world which is why we sing Amazing Grace amen so now we're going to read from the message Perfection um and you have to go when you talk about perfection Perfection you have to go back to see what the prophet said about it so we're going to see his message in 5661 0 and it's going to be paragraphs 25 through 27 is what we're going to read all right I just start reading it now so it says here the prophet says now beginning again now with the first verse let's go back last Saturday we thought we'd get to the subject of perfection so here is the prophet in his mind in his plan he's he's he's okay we're going to talk about perfection let's see what he says but then God moved us back and got for knowledge showing us where that before the world was ever formed how many was here last Sunday let's see your hand did you get it before the world was ever form we were placed in Christ think of it so you can't talk about perfection without forn knowledge for knowledge means that God knew you amen amen God knew your characteristics God knew your strengths God knew your weaknesses the prophet said he said I still love you amen right that is real Perfection it's not you trying to obtain anything so as we continue reading it says God being infinite who cannot lie cannot speak anything contrary knows everything just as perfect at the beginning as he is at as he is at the ending and just as perfect at the end as he was the beginning God is endless like eternity you can never find the corner of a perfect circle you could run and run through ages in eternity and there never never be an end to it and there there's and that's the way God is so I love the way he describes this circle of Eternity because it shows that uh you can run through all the ages and you can run your life from situation and from day to day but you can never outrun God if you came from God right it means that every single decision that you make you think you're making it in yourself but God before the foundation of the world had a had a path laid out for you and predestinated you to walk in this path whether you like like it or not which is a beautiful thing right because it also shows love right so we're going to continue reading and there never never an end to it he's talking about eternity and that's the way God is and when he be first was God which always was he was infinite perfect to begin with and he'll always be the same he never can change he is perfectly the same and that gives us faith that no matter what we deal with in life God will always love us and that is the that is the foundation of Christianity not that I'm trying to be good but because God fornew me and called me uh uh and saved me that no matter what I'm going through what no matter what I've gone through no matter what I'm currently going through and no matter what I'll go through God is God's opinion of me or my or or his thought of me will never change so that's why he had to say in the Bible that he's not a god of the past or God of the future he said I I am the god I am right now meaning currently in your situation what what you're going through he's still the same and his thoughts for you have not changed amen so and we read in uh this 27th paragraph it says now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space time came because of sin let's draw a picture of time let's see A Perfect Circle forever forever forever and then all at once sin dropped in and put a little as my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop in the chain so it comes down eternity comes Contin on but it's not in its perfect condition here's a little Gap comes down breaks over this way goes out this way God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to the space of time for the trying and perfecting and for the purging uh of the lost that God by a Sovereign Grace might someday lift that little hickey or Gap back into the perfect circle then she rolls on just the same you see it amen so I like this because um I'm going to have I'm going to say a statement here that's going to have uh going we're going to focus on that word appreciation for a moment uh and so before the foundation of the world we couldn't appreciate what Perfection was all right and when God created the garden it it we also we didn't also appreciate what Perfection was still even in the garden so we have this appreciation and uh I've said twice and there's a context context behind both of the meetings that will help us to understand so before the foundation of the world we couldn't appreciate Perfection because there wasn't a contrast all right there was nothing to show us really what Perfection was right so before the foundation of the world God said I'm a Healer and we jumped up and said we believe you God said I'm a deliverer I'm a mighty conqueror I'm the Prince of Peace and we jumped up with joy God had a smile on his face we all had a smile on our face we said God we believe you God we believe you God said I am perfect and you are my children and you are perfect too no matter what I always love you we jumped up and shouted for joy we said we believe you God it's why uh uh in the Bible when job was going through his trials God told job where were you before the foundation of the world was the sons of God jump for joy see we were already worshiping God for who he was before this thing started right but it's a um but that there was something in the back of the mind of God and also in the back of of our minds where there was there was an anticipation there was an anticipation because we were already in a perfect State as the prophet said the circle was just uh uh going round and round and round and there were no Hicks inside of it so we there was an anticipation in the backside of the mind of God and also our in our mind to see the manifestation of what was said right in order and and what that means is just to um to appreciate the words uh of what was being said said because since there was no contrast the opposite of Love is hate and so we didn't know what hate was because you have to understand that when we talk about where God was perfect so before he became God he was just the self-existing one right and we were already inside of him there was no such thing as hate there was no such thing as sickness so there was no contrast to show uh uh the love of God right there was no contrast to show the love of God and God wanted us to appreciate who he was uh in these things so um I went online and I looked at the um looked into this uh dictionary called the Oxford language to look at what the definition of appreciate means and appreciate we have three meanings here that they gave us it says to recognize the full worth of to understand a situation fully and I like how it says full yes so it's not part right we're not we're not trying to uh uh un understand God and part cuz a lot of times we walk on our Christian like and we don't ever want to get sick right we want to believe he's a Healer but we don't never want to get sick but that's not recognizing the full worth of God amen amen no God wants you to appreciate every aspect of him and that's why you have to go through what you go through that's right amen praise God so we have the next we have the next definition which is to be grateful for something all right all right and we couldn't be grateful for the love of God while we were sitting up there in Perfection because there was no challenge in that domain there was nothing to challenge the love all right and God and and Not only was God A Healer but God was a conqueror which means that it was in him to uh uh confront a challenge but we were there and he couldn't challenge us because we were the same as him right so uh God had written the Bible a Bible verse because we have to understand that everything God wrote in the Bible was written before the foundation of the world and there was a Bible verse that God WR that said that God wrote that said faith without works is dead right faith without works is dead so when God spoke those words before the foundation of the world that he was a Healer and that he loved us and we believed him he now had to prove it because it was Faith what is faith faith is just God's word it's not something that's uh uh so so hard for people understand faith is God's word and when he says his word that's it you just believe it because it's going to happen right you don't have to do anything but just get yourself out the way right so you see the valleys and the battles that we go through in life it's something that we already agreed to it's something that we already agreed to in the beginning and my dad my dad told me that one time he was saying you accepted this fight you accepted these things and I can so I can see if we could put a dramatization on on brother Moses as he went to the Red Sea and it was closed up and the children of Israel were on his back and they was Moses we should we would have been better off in Egypt and Moses was just frustrated and crying out to God you see God had made a covenant before the foundation of the world before Moses went through what he went through and if you notice anybody if we could take some drama uh add some drama to that situation I can see while Moses is down there crying I can see uh God open up a file cabinet and pull out Moses's file right and maybe put some glasses on and go down and and it said I will believe you for the opening of a red sea and right next to it was Moses name signed and God and so that's why a lot of times when you're going through your battles God can't look at what your flesh is saying God can't look at what your flesh is saying because before the foundation of the world you signed a contract and agreed with God that you would go through what you're going through so a lot of time so when you're on that when you're on that that bed of Affliction right and you're facing something that seems impossible remember there was a contract that was written not just for your sake to remember that you have a part to play but also remember that God is constantly checking those files to make sure that he can fulfill what he said because it wasn't just your signature on it it was God signature there uh too as well hallelujah amen so our second appreciation as I said before is that when we even got into the when we got into the garden it showed that we didn't appreciate it so God created the uh Garden of Eden in the beginning and it was also perfect it was also perfect right uh uh but man wanted something else man wanted something else and God allowed it to be that way it wasn't like you know when brother brandom talks about the circle being broke with that hickey coming down and breaking the circle you know you could see it as if you're driving on the road and your uh uh and your car hits a hits a rock and Pops the tire and all of a sudden you're like oh wow you're surprised that these Hicks that happened didn't surprise God God knew it would happen and needed it to happen in order for us to appreciate the Perfection that we had in the beginning right so he had to make us in a in a weaker formed than what we were right in order for him to prove himself to us because when we were in that domain where it was a self-existing one we were looking at God eye to eye because God wasn't a god of worship during that time right and so we were God with God right and when we came down into the uh into the garden then you see that then you see that Adam began to worship God uh uh and Adam and Eve began to worship God on the cool of evening but I could even still see you know Adam just looking God right in the face saying Hey Dad how how' your day go how's everything going right but God needed to be a a a champion for Davis I mean for for Adam so he had to make Adam look up so he had to make him in a way where he could come down and be weaker to look up to God because he was looking at God face to face but God couldn't show he was a conqueror or he was uh someone that uh could be Dependable while God while Adam who was perfect was the same as God so we still couldn't appreciate uh uh uh the attributes of God uh um in the garden so God gave us a weakness and the weakness that God gave us was the ability to make choices and so you see it today when you watch the news you go on Instagram on social media man makes choices and the world is just in chaos choice is a weakness to a man choice is a weakness to a man but when a man puts his choice in God it then becomes a strength it then becomes something that's perfect which is why even though we have medicine the way that we do and we think our doctors for the sacrifice that they make and the knowledge and wisdom that God has given them but even in uh uh that decision um it's still not perfect it's still not a a a perfection because now they've created uh antibiotics for bacteria but now with the uh with those antibiotics it's it's created super bugs now right so you see even though man is striving to uh uh to overcome and to win it's still shows that we're not looking at all the variables but when you place your faith in God God has everything lined up and imp plan for you and you don't have to worry about a thing right so he gave us this weakness and that weakness was the ability to make choices wow so God allowed sin uh to have a purpose in Breaking the Chain of perfection because when sin broke that chain all it did was open up a door for God to step into and put on a roll put on a hat right to prove that we were perfect and we could appreciate it you see when Eve sinned it opened up doors of opportunity yes we know that it was sin yes we know that she shouldn't have done it but it opened up doors of opportunity and the first uh door of opportunity was Adam because Adam got to Eve first before God and Adam saw Eve in that state and he could have just put her away right but you remember Adam was perfect in himself right and he chose to eat the fruit of course we know the ACT he did with Eve and he did that because he loved her and he knew that if he wouldn't have done that God would have came and put her away and so we can already see now in that m mistake and that situation where other people would have kind of looked down on it we can already see God turn their mistake into a foreshadow of what was to come right right it wasn't them being perfect as a a standing necessarily uh standing up to the word of God but it was God being able to come down and turn their situation around amen so there's situation uh uh even though we know it was sin uh uh the act the what they did after the fact it prophesied of the coming Christ all right and I'm here to tell you today that the situations that you go through and the mistakes that you go through a lot of times we feel like uh uh God is not with us God is not here but God has a way of turning your choices to glorify him and we see that throughout the whole entire Bible so that's why Paul could Paul could Paul could say these things neither height neither depth nothing can say separated from the love of God because even in our weakness our weaknesses Still Point to God and give him glory right it still gives him glory so the next opportunity that we see is uh after God had passed judgment to the serpent into the eve and God couldn't pass judgment to Adam because he was perfect so he cursed the ground right the Bible says he killed a lamb and he wrapped it around them and you see uh actions your actions can uh uh have a language in their own self right and so my dad I remember when I was younger and my dad uh I thought I could get a little bit smart and so I wouldn't say nothing back to my dad when he would say something but so then when he would say something IID just throw some body language and I still get hit and I'll be like Dad why' you hit me I didn't say nothing he said you're right your body say something your body language say something amen so your actions uh uh uh not only do your actions speak to your parents but your actions also are speaking to Christ amen just as Christ's actions are speaking to you he may not say much but he's going to do something he'll do something in your life right so when God sacrificed this lamb and then he told uh he told Adam and Eve to come and he wrapped this lamb around him I could see the language being passed uh to Adam and Eve uh God speaking to his children I told you I love you no matter what now God wasn't smiling this time because it was a serious situation but the Covenant still stayed the same and as Adam and Eve were leading leaving the garden they were now in a in a in a state of fearfulness because they didn't know what was going to happen because theyd never seen sin before they never seen sickness before they never seen uh uh family troubles before they never had these things so there was an uncertainty on them a dark cloud that was on them but I could see through the depths of their soul when God wrapped that lamb around them to give them some confidence to show that I always love you I could see them saying we believe you Daddy even though this even though they weren't smiling and jumping for joy like they were in the beginning of the word uh uh beginning before the foundation of the world but now they could appreciate this side of love because before in Perfection it was all jumping in joy and shouting but this side of love was God wasn't smiling anymore but still loved him am he still love them because of the Covenant that he made for them you can only be you have to be perfect in order for God to look at you and your mistakes and say that he loves you right it's not you keeping yourself but it's God keeping us right their circum their their circumstances didn't change God's mind right it only f further proved his love for them right that should give us confident when we fall and make mistakes that even though I know I did wrong I know Daddy's going to turn it around somehow God Amen so we want to look at our second expectation uh imperfection and that is the way God designed you has a role in your path to appreciate your Perfection and we're going to prove it by the scriptures we're going to turn to Psalm 37 and we're going to read verses 23- 24 four and just tell say Amen once you get there all right so it reads it reads the good steps or the right steps or the correct steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord it does not say that it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord a lot of times we think that it's only God is only with us when we're doing good or when we're uh uh uh living according to his word and to his standards but the Bible says the steps of a good man and that good man and the righteous man is God's righteousness on you which is how he's how he's viewing you which was before the foundation of the L of the of the world so it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand amenallah you going to fall you're going to fall God prophesied it and you can't go against his word God prophesied that you would fall but the thing that he want you to do is to come back that's the key step is to come back you see when that woman um when that woman came to Jesus and they were all accusing her of being a prostitute and Christ had come down uh uh in perfect love uh uh and we know that the Bible verses before that is when when Whenever there was someone caught in adultery or something like that they were to Stone her and Jesus just ignored everything that was being said and he wrote in the ground and he said he who was without sin cast the first stone and of course everyone had to everyone had to go away and it said from the old to the young meaning that you're going to make mistakes whether you're young whether you're old a lot of times we try to look at people and say oh well they've been in church for a s so and so long they're still making mistakes everybody is making mistakes and so when they left her Jesus told her where are thy accusers but the key thing that he said next was neither do I judge you go and sin no more right there was an expectation that yeah I see that you fell but don't get back up and do the same thing again amen right and that's how you know the steps of a righteous man are order by the Lord we no longer have the desire to sin anymore right so we're going to dig a little deep into this expectation uh because the Bible says that God designed and made you the way that you are and we're going to go back into the garden because what a lot of people don't realize and and why it it and it's and it's the reason why the prophet had to um God had to take the mind of a prophet in order to show us what the truth was because Eve the a lot of times the prophet he said when he saw people uh paint pictures of Eve Eve and stuff like that they showed her as this ugly cavewoman or something like that the prophet described that as the ignorance or the carnal mind of man the Bible says Eve was beautiful Prophet said that Eve was beautiful and God made her that way and she knew she was beautiful so when when God makes you a certain way you have to use the way that God Made You to glorify God because if you don't that's good brother if you don't it'll cause you to make a choice right that'll cause a fall in your life wow that'll cause a fall in your life so it's not that people are um it's not that people are bad in themselves God Made You and in fact we're going to continue on reading this right because um you know a lot of times parents uh um they have an idea of what they want for their kids you know they want to they want them to be smart or they want them to be preaching or they want them to be presidents or scientists and all that they want to be upstanding citizens they want them to be in church all their lives and those are good things because it shows that you're trying to reflect God's characters but God has a mind outside of us right and so we're going to read uh uh in Jeremiah uh 1 14-5 uh just to kind of see uh what God's uh plan was when uh he designed us so just say Amen once you get there we're going to see that uh it's God that does the designing even though you're a parent and you bring the child into the world God designs that child uh uh uh uh specifically for his purpose amen all right so it reads here it says then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I like that because it it it proves that God is the one that created our personalities our characteristics amen uh uh anything any any any type of thing we look at as a weakness or a strength God did all of it that's right right and next he says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and I love it when he he he he ends it with I knew thee because it was before you were formed yes before the foundation of the world there was some for knowledge or knowing or some Perfection so he wanted him to rest just on that just you got a little semic there just to take a little pause right it's important to do that because that should settle you right that should settle you that hold on a second God Made Me The Way I Am A lot of times people look at their characteristics and they Wonder like man why am I this way you ain't make yourself that way God Made You yourself that way I noticed there's something there's some things in my life where it's uh uh for for example it can be hard for me to forgive people because I feel embarrassed about it and I always look at that as a weakness like man why am I always why am I always making mistakes I just don't want to forget but I love the opportunity because it's an opportunity for God to step down in the flesh overcome the weakness and through me forgive so then I can say ah okay now I see Lord you don't want me just to be forgiven just to say I'm forgiven you want to come in me and do it so then it is a perfect forgiveness because a lot of times people forgive but they not forgiven they're not really forgiving you right and it says and before thou camest forth out the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so God uh um God makes you uh uh the way that you are we're also going to read uh 1 Samuel uh because this is the attitude that we should have uh and this is just kind of a Sidetrack just off of this expectation right here this is the kind of attitude that have we should have you know when you're raising kids and stuff like that and also when you're um working with youth and things like that or you're working with someone that may be younger than you uh so we're going to read from 1st Samuel uh 1: 10-1 and this is just a uh this is just a story of Hannah where uh the Bible says that God has shut up her womb for her not to have a kid um and we'll see that that was a blessing right that was a blessing in disguise and it says here and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore so sometimes your weaknesses right your weaknesses will calls you to look to God and that's the greatest thing that you could do because what it what what it's doing is it's showing the grace and for knowledge of God right it's shown his forn knowledge of you where he's now forfeiting your decision and your choice because it's a weakness in itself and if he would allowed you to choose something it wouldn't have been perfect right and so it says and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou Wilt indeed look on the afflictions of thy handmade and remember me and not forget thy handmate but will give unto thine handmade a Manchild right she was specific in this prayer then I'll give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor uh come upon his head so I love I love this Bible verse because it's important for us as Elders as people that are are that are older when we're looking at the youth Lord what did you make this child to be amen what do you have what do you have for this child not what I want for him a lot of times parents Parents try to make choices for their kids and ends up scarring them in the future right and the kids don't understand why they're going through what they're going through but I loved Hannah Hannah got desperate into a situation and said Lord if you give me a child I'm giving him right back to you and that was a perfect choice right because it produced Samuel a prophet that we know did a perfect work for the Lord amen um so God makes us all different and some of us have one Talent some of us have two talents many talents right and we all have different personalities and characteristics and Perfection is also tied to your work on Earth which is based off the way God designed you that's why it says when you're in the will of God you are perfectly safe when you're in the will of God you are perfectly safe and you are walking perfect when you're outside the will of God hallelujah you don't know what can happen amen so Perfection is tied to your work on on Earth because it keeps you safe on God's word right so we want to take a look at uh um brother Jonah when we look about personalities and stuff so Jonah had the personality of I want to do things my way right Jonah had that personality where he he wanted his idea and ways of doing things and we've all been in the workplace before I was talking to pastor about uh as you begin to work with people you'll begin to see people's characteristics and then some people you know you have a group of people at your job where you can just tell them what to do they go and get it done no problem but then you got another group over here of people where you tell them what to do you come back 10 minutes later and they're doing their own thing right and so you can't get you you really can't get mad at them right you can get mad at the ACT but don't get mad at the way that they were designed and how their mind works because you have to understand that those two types of group have pros and cons to them yes brother have pros and cons to them this group over here that you can tell them to do whatever they want you tell them anything and they'll just do whatever do whatever you got to be careful with that because you got to make sure that you're doing the right thing right you got to make sure that you're doing the right thing and this group over here uh they just kind of want to do whatever they want to do it can you can look at that as a negative but there's a thing in the world called group think and group think is when you're with a group you're working with a group and all of the people are agreeing with the same agreeing with the same idea and if you go against that that that'll make them upset but if you're doing the wrong thing within that group you need someone to come and challenge you need someone to come in there and say hold on a second now y'all not thinking right so these are just personalities it's how Christ was when he came with the pH Pharisees and Sadducees they all had group thinking we're agreeing with the same thing but Christ came in there and said well hold on a second this isn't right right so we see Jonah here he had the uh he had a personality of he wanted to do what he wanted to do and of course we know how the story goes God told Jonah to do something and he went the opposite way right and you would think that his decision was a bad one and yes it was badow but the thing is God needed Jonah in the belly of a fish and God knew that see God knows that if he tells you to do something how many people would agree to go inside of a fish's belly for three days and three nights how many people will willingly say oh Lord send me right not many people would want to brother right so God had to design Jonah in a way that even though this was a characteristics where he liked to do things his way which can be used as a positive there had to be a con to it in Jonah's own choice right so when Jonah chose to go against what God Said and was on the board and when they were on the boat we know the story he was on the ship and the winds were going crazy and people were like what is going on and Jonah said it's me it's me I made the wrong choice throw me over the ship amen and all this thing will stop and they threw him over the ship and the Bible says the storm stopped that's right and God sent a fish right a a a fish that was created before the foundation of the world to come and pick Jonah up that's right and his troubles didn't stop there because Jonah was in the fish begging for the mercy of God and I can see that maybe Jonah at one point thought it was over or thought it was too late but the Perfection that was inside of Jonah that God had placed in him said if I just look up to the temple and ask God for Mercy he'll give it to me right and when he said that the Bible says the uh God told the fish to throw Jonah up out of his mouth that's right and when they threw him out of his mouth we know that the people that uh he was sent to go and deliver this message to were fish worshippers so when they seen a man come out of the belly of a fish God knew they would have to listen God always sends you a sign to catch your attention amen right so even though Jonah had made a wrong choice Jonah's wrong choice still pointed to Christ right because now Jonah had a message and not just a message over hey come repent just come and repent and God and go and God will take away your sins no Jonah came in there with a testimony behind this message which I believe a testimony in a message is more powerful because it shows you that I overcame this thing and so it gave it also gave Christ the courage because he said as Jonah was in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights so must I have go down right and it was God showing that hey I've got to go through and show that this antidote works because the prophet said that modern day scientists love to test their antidotes and the vaccines on animals but not themselves so Jonah had to go through this experience in order to test it on himself that even though he was in a situation and we're not talking about some Pinocchio where you got a A Memory Foam couch and a big belly of a whale with Netflix going on and some fire going on no the Bible said that Jonah described his situation as hell wow he described his situation as hell which meant no hope no God but yet that Perfection on the inside of him had to cry out to God and so God and so Jonah came with a message to the people that says I know some of you guys are hopeless but I'm here to tell you even in Hell God sees you which is which uhuh God had to then prophesy and put that word over David and say oh even though I laid my bed in hell thou with me and that gave Christ I believe that go gave Christ he looked to that word as he was on the cross and he and and and as death began to uh uh to to crawl on him because he was a man he was God but he also was a man and the prophet described that situation as the enemy uh was whispering into Christ's ears you know you're about to die and you know you have sin on your lives right and and that's why we can look back to the situ ation that Adam and Eve their situation was now a mirror of what Christ was doing because Christ now had put on the sins of his bride right and the Judgment was death and I can see God hear those things in his ear as a man but then he remembered Jonah and said hold on a second no no no God delivered Jonah out of his situation I'll be the same right so even though Jonah had made this great mistake it still gave God glory amen that is that is that is that is that is some beautiful Perfection because now when we're going through our situations right and think about it a man that was that man that did opposite of God we can look to him in our situations today and say hold on a second I have confidence in God that if God Did It for Jonah he'll do it for my situation glory and that was a situation where he went against God and you can still quote that verse now today and what you're going through and God will deliver you am amenallah oh my gosh talk about perfection it's not nothing that you do it's God's T it's the tender hand of je Jehovah over your head guiding you through your life making everything just perfect as it needs to be right we can look at Peter uh as uh begin to uh begin to close up a little bit we can look at Peter and Peter was a guy that was a very very interesting guy he was the best friend of Jesus Christ and and Peter is what I I guess you could call an extremist he was all over the place in one in one sense in one and one time you see Peter cutting the ear off saying God ain't gonna let him take you but then you fast forward and he's denying Christ three times he's just all over the place and you know those kind of people you know if uh you know let's say you're going to the restaurant you're going to Z uh Applebees or something you get up to the parking lot and then that that person you know what I want to go to this place you're like huh huh just all over the place it's it's the way God made Peter though all right because after after Peter had after Jesus had uh was washing their feet uh uh and uh uh Jesus was washing Peter's feet uh he said uh Peter had said a second he said Lord Lord don't don't don't wash my feet and God Jesus was telling him hey if I don't do this you have no life with you have no no no you have no life no part in life with me then he said well not only my feet all of me and Jesus said no I just need to do this so we see uh uh even through God's personalities and characteristics of God of Peter standing for God and then denying God before the foundational World God said I love you Peter God saw his personality God saw his characteristics and still loved him and had to show Peter that so that's why Peter had to make the decisions that he did now Peter represented faith and you'll notice with extreme people they're very extreme but I believe that Peter was the type of guy that when he made a decision he was committed to it which is why he cut the ear off of that person he wasn't there to play he wasn't there to play he literally cut his ear off right and the Bible said that uh the three of them Peter James and John they were God Peter was uh um John was go U God's agency of Love James was God's agent agency of Hope and Peter was God's agency of Faith right once Peter got committed to something there was no backing out there was no backing out and God needed that characteristics in Peter to the point that a man could stand in the shadow of Peter and be healed by his faith because of the way God made him right because of the way that God had made him God and the prophet has said that Peter didn't have the love that James uh that John had and we see that in uh uh in in the way that Peter handled that situation with Simon when Simon thought that he could buy the gift of God and Peter said look go talk to God just to see even if he would forgive you right the bluntness and that's how Peter was because a lot of us would have said you know hey brother this is not how the gospel works you know God loves you and made you the way you are and you know we should learn to appreciate God but Peter wasn't built that way amen amen Peter wasn't built that way God designed him to be a certain way uh uh to fulfill a certain role amen and in closing our last expectation that we want to talk about is you can't choose your path to Perfection you cannot choose your path to Perfection a lot of us want to live good lives but nowhere in Jonah's mind would did he ever think he'd be in belly of a fish nowhere in Peter's mind did he ever think that he would deny Christ so when bad things happen it's not that you would it's not that nowh in your mind you're not planning to do those things right right so it's our Perfection our path to Perfection God has even ordained those steps and I like to look at these um these two sisters in the Bible which is a beautiful uh uh uh typing together of Mary and Mary right so Mary um was set aside uh uh for a service for God and of course she was a virgin and she had a work to do with God so God had to make sure that her life she couldn't look at no boys she couldn't look at no guys the Holy Spirit would come down and say Mary turn your head Mary turn your head she she she thought that she was going to go and talk to some guy God said uhuh no that's not happening maybe sent a chicken in there cause a disruptance in order to get that thing separated because God had a specific path for uh uh for Mary and that was to be the incubator for our Lord Jesus Christ and her work was perfect but then you see another Mary and her life wasn't as virtuous right her life was not as virtuous she made a lot of bad decisions uh uh uh and I can see that maybe one point one uh uh in her life uh uh she begun to look in the mirror or self-examine herself and not feel worthy right and not feel like uh uh she was you she was useful for anything anything and then she heard about Christ and of course we know the story as Christ went to the party with the Pharisees he wasn't invited I mean he was invited but they didn't they didn't treat him any way they didn't greet him or nothing and he kind of sat down um sat down on the seat and I could see Mary as she began to uh approach Christ and go and go see Christ I can see the emotions uh uh in her life swell up as she realizes that this man is a perfect man and she didn't have any and she didn't have anything to give she had wasted away her life and her virtues and all of those things and felt like she didn't have much to give but as she got to him all she could do was cry on his feet and then begin to wipe her hair W wipe her feet with her hair and I love it because a a sacrifice had to be anointed and clean before work and so Mary had to be in a position where she felt cuz you think about it who's going to who's going to go and cry on someone's feet and then wash their hair with with it who's going to do that Mary had to be put into a position her choices the way God designed her and made her to make her choices she had to be put into a position where she could be broken down to recognize this perfect sacrifice clean it up before it was put to service it may have not been she may have not lived a virtuous life as Mary the other Mary had but she still had a path to perfection am amen amen and I would like and and I and and I would like to end it end it with this thing is that you know we are also uh uh the bride we all share the name of the bride of Christ amen but our path to Perfection we will not determin it we can hope for good things in our life and that's always good but God has a plan God has a plan and the song says some through the waters some through the floods some through great trials but all through the blood so our Perfection is not what we try to do in this life our Perfection is not the choice is not necessarily the choices choices that we try to make or the uh the goodness that we try to live within ourselves right because God will allow us to be in a position where we make the wrong choice and and it causes us to fall down but God said that a just man will fall God prophesied that you will fall brother brandom explained this he said man was born into a world a sinner you didn't have a choice in it but the most important thing is what you do next all right and the most important thing that this Mary could do though she had send though she had given away her virtue and stuff like that the next choice she made was to recognize the righteousness of Christ and realize that her life needed cleaning up and in that God could use her circumstances uh uh to glorify him amen there's your Perfection you've already been perfected you've already been perfected before the foundation of the world and you're already walking into this Perfection the most important thing is just to yield to God to uh to thank God as Perfection because it's it's it's nothing that you could do on yourself and that's why uh uh you know the Pharisees and sadut live good lives spotless spotless lives but it but but but but there was no uh but sometimes God needs you to be broken Bren down sometimes God needs you to go through a bed of Affliction sometimes God needs you to be sick right so that in those circumstances you can still call on him and he can then he can prove that he is a Healer if you were never sick how would God how could God Be A Healer if you were never sick and that's why God doesn't like it when we go through our trials and we're going through our situations and We complain right God just pulls that contract back out with your name on it saying you signed up for this you signed up for this right and it's to show that uh uh uh um the Perfection that God ha has given us before the foundation of the world it's just an appreciation God wants to show us uh that he loves us and this is the reason why and what we Face through in our lives Amen Let Us bow our heads Lord Jesus Christ we thank you oh Lord God for for your uhh forn knowledge oh Lord God and predestination oh Lord Jesus Christ we know Lord God that it's no works of ourselves oh Lord God you've given us the secrets of your word oh Lord God and the way that you work oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord you did it oh Lord God so that we would know your will oh Lord God and that when we are going through our trials oh Lord God that we wouldn't blame you oh Lord God because a lot of times people go through this world and bad things happen and they want to blame God why does God allow bad things to happen well sometimes he just wants to show you that he loves you sometimes he wants to show you that he's a Healer that he that he brings peace so he'll put you in a situation where there's no peace but you are the peace in that situation and all you have to do is just appreciate it there nothing that we put on on it's nothing that we're putting on that we're trying to obtain them but it's just something we're trying to appreciate while we're in the midst of our trial oh Lord God you designed us you formed us you knew us you knew every characteristic you know all the personalities we would have you know all the mistakes we would make you know our strengths oh Lord God you saw all of our weaknesses oh Lord you saw that we would fall short of the word Lord Jesus Christ but the Bible says that there was a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that was the Covenant oh Lord that you gave us oh Lord God that we could have confidence in oh Lord Jesus Christ I can see Jonah in the belly of that well Lord Jesus Christ look at that Temple that Temple reflected the Lamb's sacrifice before the foundation of the world to find Grace in his situation oh Lord God we just want to say we love you oh Lord God we thank you oh Lord God continue perfecting us oh Lord God lord we know we're going to fail you tomorrow we're going to know we know we're going to fail you the next day the prophet said that we sin daily and if we say we have no sin we make God a liar oh Lord we don't want to make you a liar oh Lord God lord we are unworthy oh Lord God lord we fail you all the time oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord we know that you have made Provisions for us to come back oh Lord Jesus Christ and we'll stand like Jonah and just focus on the sacrifice in the midst of what we're going through oh Lord Jesus Christ because we know Lord God that you will come and you will uh fulfill your word which was the love that you promised us before the foundation of the world in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen bless youate praise the Lord ah food for your soul uh certainly appreciate brother Quinton uh on tonight and just um many many nutrients there that he was um just bringing now uh the the the the story of Mary I think that's something I'm going to have to start using myself uh but her her characteristics were in such a way that it um and God designed her that way uh it allowed um just God's grace just to be expressed in such a way and not only that um for the sacrifice to be washed uh before it was offered she had to be in such a condition that she knew that this was her only hope and I don't think she planned it that way but she just realized how much she needed him and and she had a chance to be at his feet so just just a really really wonderful wonderful uh thought and and and um the one point that he made the way God designed you has a role in your path to Perfection um that statement is um is is is lifegiving um it's one that will set you free if you really understand it uh because you know and when we talk about perfection brother Brandon makes a statement he says you know it's not Perfection um the way that you think I should be made perfect and you need to stop this and you still doing that and you well I'm measuring up to your standard of perfection right but it's not based on what you you think think it's based on what God thinks and and the other thing is God design me with certain characteristics brother Brandon made a statement he says uh there are um there were things in him that his conversion did not take out now if that was in the prophet and his conversion didn't take it out guess what there are certain things in all of us that even your conversion will not take out God actually designed you to be that way so we can't strive for other people's Perfection but this is all about God and what he's doing in and through us and we yield to that wonderful word from the Lord tonight amen wonderful amen I I I I I appreciate it being in church tonight let me have um the announcements we will uh um um go through that um don't this this Sunday morning um we'll have prayer 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and then service at 10:30 and um the Lord has blessed us uh brother Gwenna happen to be passing through so

amen up in Michigan area and um they came down for a little conference there for work and unfortunately got some really bad weather this time so but it's good to have you brother Joe God bless you and God bless you amen before we leave tonight uh anybody have a prayer request or praise report that they want to make mention of before we leave tonight right okay just one just want to thank God for grace and mercy for a beautiful vacation traveling mercies uh his Divine protection over us while we were away and also asking prayer for my brother-in-law David Tate uh he's has kidney failure gets on the kidney machine and um just being in prayer for he's looking for a live Kidney donor um you know because his health is he's been in and out and my sister's all stressed out so just keep him in prayer okay we sure will amen all right anybody else uh praise report prayer requests okay um I did want to thank God for something that I heard this week that uh just really was a blessing to me um brother qu who had shared with me and also with the brothers on last night uh he felt led to send one of the sermons um recent sermons over to Sister Tatiana and uh sister brother brother Leo and sister Tatiana they were coming during covid with their three kids we're in the other uh building they were they were coming uh quite frequently you know to our services and um and I also had an opportunity to sit down and just have a a real good conversation about some things that you know U they had questions about so we had dinner and and I was able to you know just just kind of break break some things down and um so they um um they were you know brother brother quu felt led to share Sunday service with her and then said you know what I had send the previous Sunday to her so let me let me send that to her and uh so she was there listening to the uh sermons in her house and and when she heard the sermon I don't look like what I've been through she responded to brother quu she say this is a now word and she capitalized now you know she this is a now word you know and and and I I needed this you know and on that um on while she was watching you know the service you can tell people watch the whole service not just part she listened to the announcements and in the announcements she heard there sister's prayer meeting and she said brother qu who can I be a part of that prayer meeting because uh you know and and the reason that she was drawn to the prayer meeting is and this is the thing that really blessed me she say one day she came to the pantry um she was going through something in her life she came to the pantry she ran into sister Michelle and um and somehow Michelle talked to her a little bit and made sure that she was all situated with the food from the pantry and uh and and through that process she say sister Michelle prayed for her and her husband uh who was in the hospital at the time and she she prayed for her and she say um if sisters going to be on the prayer line praying the way sister Michelle prayed for me I need to learn how to pray like that and I want to be on the prayer line with them amen so little things go a long way and and and for me that that that means a lot because you know we when with the with the pantry it's um uh it's not just giving out the food right that that sometimes you typically uh you never know when a person has a real need but when they have a real need the greatest thing they could ever receive amen is is is a word of prayer or just introduction to Jesus Christ so we look for opportunities I mean it's a Ministry the pantry is a Ministry uh when we were when we were uh praying about um uh we had lost our opportunity to go to um Pinnacle Palms they closed up because of um uh because of covid but when they when they close that door we start praying Lord where do you want us to go next where do you want us what do you want us to do God put the Pantry in our lap and there people passing through all the time so we look for those opportunities where we can say a word of prayer for them right it means so much so when I heard that and and how the sister was just blessed by that now she wants to be a part of the prayer so y'all going to see a new face you know your sister's a new face so and just through this who knows we'll start winning our sister am we'll start winning her and her family right on into right on into the faith not only that she um uh she had some neighbors that that lived next to her and they they happened to move they relocated I think somewhere in this area and she told her neighbors they're from Uruguay and uh she told him said well I know a couple churches that you could probably try out and uh they said Okay and she said this church St predominately you know English but this one over here is predominantly Spanish and being from Uruguay you know they probably prer a Spanish speaking Church well the wife and this and this couple she heard the name of our church she said all she heard it was the name of the church and when she heard the name ofur said I know they other Spanish speaking but spirit and Truth Tabernacle I want to go there so we're looking for these Saints to show up any day now right uh but sister Tatiana recommended our church to them and so you know if she's recommending then you know she got to be part of of it too right so so y'all be praying for her and praying with her and you know I just believe God's going to use this amen for his glory and for his honor and you know another little quick testimony I'll share my wife shared it with me and I want I I say this because I think we all need to be sensitive to this but she was telling me how uh one of her um she volunteers and one of the other ladies that worked there was going through something with her husband and uh she knew my wife's life so she she said you know Erica would you just please just pray for me just pray for my husband just pray for me so you know commment responses sure I'll pray for you later on right and uh so my wife uh was just listening to her and she says you know what let's stop right now and let's pray right now and uh she stopped right where she was and had a word of prayer with that lady and she would just just Overjoyed uh that sister Erica would have prayer you know with her and and uh we never know when we going to have opportunities to be Jesus for somebody am amen amen so I mean we we we we ought to look for these these opportunities and and when God put simple for us let's let's let's take advantage that happened to me just the other day I went to visit one of the clients and and um the the the client's daughter they they are um I'm not sure if they're practicing uh Jews but I know that they of Jewish descent and uh but the daughter heard that I was a Pastor said I heard I heard I know you're a pastor would you pray for my daddy yes the man is of Jewish descent well you know I have no problem praying for him uh if if there's if any sick let him call for the Elders of the church so we prayed right there right there in the nursing home or wherever they was and uh but you know God God wants to wants us to be his hands and his feet and now we ought to look for these opportunities church so let's let's be aware amen let's let's be ready uh to do what God's called us to do amen the name again is David Tate David
