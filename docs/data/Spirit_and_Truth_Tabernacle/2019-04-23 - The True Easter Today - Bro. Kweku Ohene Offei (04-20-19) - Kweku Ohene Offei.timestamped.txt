[2:34] world thought it was over at the cross
[2:38] there was something going on and a man
[2:41] there in hell and he was setting some
[2:44] captives free praise the Lord for that a
[2:48] man and not only did he set captives
[2:50] free and hail but till still today he
[2:53] still said in captives free and and

[41:33] whatever you got on your list right now
[41:35] put a handle
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] hallelujah God can do that plus plus
[41:44] plus a man so we just state the Lord and
[41:47] tonight we're we're happy to be able to
[41:50] welcome a man a brother Queen cou to the
[41:54] pulpit he's one that the Lord has sent a
[41:58] man as helping and and a couple things
[42:01] that I appreciated about brother quick
[42:04] ooh is the first time when he came here
[42:08] he never told nobody that he was a
[42:10] minister they didn't say anything to
[42:12] anybody the man used to pass the church
[42:14] and he just sent here to say a Mantid
[42:17] word and I think the first service that
[42:19] I saw him cuz he come I wasn't here the
[42:21] first service but the second when I got
[42:23] back the Quaker was sitting in the back
[42:25] I think the brothers you know put him in
[42:27] the back and as he come visa no no no I
[42:30] make his way to the front you know and
[42:32] he and he said Danny hold that down and
[42:34] he was sitting there just so home when
[42:36] just you know never never really saying
[42:37] anything and I found out that he was a
[42:39] minister I said brother we woman we want
[42:41] to use you you know and and and things
[42:43] of that nature and I said I'm if you
[42:46] don't mind we got us preacher for New
[42:48] Year's Eve service but if you can just
[42:50] come and maybe get 15 minutes of an
[42:52] exhortation or something you know just
[42:54] just share something and then let the
[42:56] preacher come and that's always a test
[42:58] for a minister right I mean if you get
[43:04] the the mic and you can't stay within
[43:05] the 15 minutes that's that's a problem
[43:08] that's the truth I had to go through the
[43:11] same train and I went to a church one
[43:13] time and they'd wanted everybody to talk
[43:15] for seven minutes they had about seven
[43:16] speakers everybody get seven minutes
[43:18] well I went up and I think I spoke four

[49:51] are not elected you to stand here where
[49:52] you are right now you put you here in
[49:55] West Palm Beach to be his glory to miss
[49:57] Anna
[49:58] so all of eternity is within you and is
[50:01] behind you amen
[50:03] the Lord is we died when Adam died but
[50:07] Allah begin to resurrect us a little to
[50:10] call a Monisha and then bring us to who
[50:13] you were before the foundation of the
[50:14] world because you as sons and daughters
[50:17] of God or did unto good works and the
[50:20] Lord is bringing it to pass amen
[50:22] shall we grab our Bible if you can let's
[50:32] read a couple of scriptures from John
[50:34] chapter 12 verse 24 John 12:24
[50:49] John 12:24 verily verily I say unto you
[50:53] except a corn of wheat falls into the
[50:56] ground and dies it abides alone but if
[50:59] it dies it brings forth much fruit amen
[51:02] and if you want to read the 25 he that
[51:05] loves his life shall lose it and he that
[51:08] eateth his life in this world shall keep
[51:11] it unto eternal life and let's jump to
[51:14] 1st Corinthians chapter 15 1st
[51:20] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 22 23 first
[51:31] Corinthians 15 22 23 1 Corinthians 15 22
[51:41] 23 but now in but now is Christ risen
[51:44] from the dead and become the firstfruits
[51:46] of them that slept 21 for since by man
[51:50] came death by man came also the
[51:53] resurrection of the dead 22 for as in
[51:57] Adam all die even so in Christ shall all
[52:00] be made alive and we have been made
[52:03] alive at the new bed 23 by every man in
[52:06] his own order Christ the firstfruits
[52:08] afterward they that are Christ's at his
[52:11] coming then cometh the end when he shall
[52:14] deliver deliver up the kingdom of God
[52:16] even the father when he shall have put
[52:18] down all rule and all authority and the
[52:21] power amen god bless you shall we be
[52:24] seated
[52:27] we want to pick east as rain east are
[52:30] going to pick a little scripture on a
[52:31] lot of thought on Easter what is Easter
[52:35] weekend we know about Easter we know it
[52:37] is relation of the Dead is about death
[52:40] burial and resurrection so we want to
[52:43] caption our Simon the truth is that
[52:45] today the truth is that today amen
[52:51] today when you go to different part of
[52:52] the world probably the time might be a
[52:54] little different in different parts they
[52:56] already into Sunday between the
[52:59] Philippine in
[53:00] they are really celebrating Easter I
[53:02] mean Sunday some actuality are certain
[53:05] countries that they kind of imitate
[53:07] Christianity we have people across and
[53:10] they whip them just like they did to
[53:12] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago
[53:14] I think if in southern countries people
[53:16] sacrificed himself to be killed but what
[53:19] is the truth is that today because that
[53:22] is not Easter weeping somebody killing
[53:24] somebody putting a cross on somebody
[53:27] like Jesus in a Roman cow enemy teaches
[53:30] something 2,000 years ago it's just a
[53:33] painted fire if you paint me if I'm cold
[53:37] I'm freezing and you paint me and fire
[53:39] on the wall which you know is like a
[53:41] flame it's not gonna warm me up I need a
[53:43] live fire so imitation of Easter 2,000
[53:49] years ago is not Easter but it's an
[53:51] e-stop going on right now because every
[53:54] scripture has got compound meeting a
[53:56] compiled revelation amen now in star
[53:59] 2,000 years ago when Adam was planted on
[54:02] this earth he came by the spoken word of
[54:04] God so the Lord wanted him to speak his
[54:07] offspring into creation to populate the
[54:10] earth with the spoken word of God but an
[54:13] instead of Adam doing that Adam showed
[54:15] all of us into death by the sexual bathe
[54:19] as we know sittin Eve cross or serpent
[54:22] Eve cross that brought all mankind in
[54:25] creation into death but the movement are
[54:28] implanted into that death Christ Jesus
[54:30] Elohim begin to crittendon's from death
[54:32] back to life
[54:34] amen because the program was the program
[54:37] program of God to bring the attributes
[54:39] of redemption
[54:40] amen so without a death there could not
[54:43] be resurrection without Adam being
[54:46] platanus into death sickness and
[54:47] problems God cannot bring us back into
[54:51] resurrection Redemption and into glory
[54:53] so the Lord had to have Adam to do the
[54:56] contrast by planting all creation into
[54:59] death so the scriptures say that in Adam
[55:01] or dies but in Christ or shall live EMEA
[55:06] because as a master plan there's Christ
[55:09] himself behind the scene so now in
[55:13] time the lobby need to bring
[55:15] justification upon the earth because
[55:18] this earth is gas own heart God has got
[55:22] different planets other universe Jupiter
[55:26] Mercury but if mankind right on earth
[55:29] and if I'm right is the third planet
[55:31] three is the number of perfection so God
[55:34] water to marry the earth and you choose
[55:36] out of the planet the planet earth to
[55:39] bring forth his wife on this planet amen
[55:42] this is where God put us we are not
[55:45] going to live in Jupiter no we are not
[55:47] going to believe in mercury science is
[55:49] trying to go to mass in 2234 I was in
[55:52] Houston I think 2023 sorry 2012 and we
[55:56] were talking about the were actually
[55:57] prophesying about going to mass around
[56:00] 2035 getting ready to put man on mass
[56:03] but that is not a program of God the
[56:06] program of God is right here on this
[56:07] element God will raise his sons and his
[56:10] daughters from this element so the Lord
[56:12] brought no one on earth and no one when
[56:16] Noah was on earth there were two
[56:17] prophets Enoch was on earth but God does
[56:21] not deal with to make a profit at the
[56:22] same time so no I was having his eyes on
[56:25] Enoch who was his adding a great
[56:28] grandfather because Noah came from
[56:30] Lamech Lamech him from Methuselah
[56:32] Methuselah came from Enoch so if I'm
[56:34] right he was the fourth generation very
[56:37] long so you can see your grid probably
[56:39] great-great-grandparents
[56:40] cause the way they were sown well I
[56:42] found it before they go marry Adam was
[56:44] 130 something so it wasn't like our time
[56:47] we're probably wanna see your
[56:49] great-grandparents so sorry I said Adam
[56:53] no one had his eye on Enoch and he knew
[56:57] that as soon as you know leave the earth
[56:59] it was time to begin his ministry amen
[57:03] just like Elijah and Elijah Elijah never
[57:06] kept his eyes on Elijah he kept his eyes
[57:09] on Elijah all the time he didn't think
[57:10] it's like off the nationís
[57:12] God raptured Elijah Elijah began his
[57:15] ministry and as soon as God ruptured
[57:17] Enoch and Noah begin his ministry
[57:20] and that's not a rupture Alijah of Rd
[57:23] the Minister of the wife began and God
[57:30] before he not left God made and not to
[57:33] build a pyramid the pyramid what the
[57:36] first Bible God wrote was the zodiac the
[57:39] skies let me just backtrack a little bit
[57:41] now before we had this paper Bible and
[57:44] electronic Bible and what we have I
[57:46] didn't have a Bible to use computers
[57:51] from self who know Adam had a Bible
[57:54] which was the sky the zodiac was very
[57:58] simple right his Bible was the Sun the
[58:01] Moon the Stars and all the glories of
[58:03] the heavenly now when you go to the
[58:05] zodiac the Sun depict Christ s UN s Co
[58:10] and son of God the moon is the wife of
[58:13] Christ so when the Sun does his wake and
[58:16] go to sleep then he put his power
[58:18] authority over the moon to these pleased
[58:21] attributes in the night amen
[58:23] just like when a man travels out of whom
[58:26] he has fathered a wife and the kids that
[58:28] when I'm not here honey let my children
[58:30] free let him go to sleep at this time
[58:32] because the woman is the coming of the
[58:36] man amen the bride is a revolution of
[58:39] the husband the wife is the ministry of
[58:42] the husband amen
[58:44] so God put all those stars and moons
[58:46] there now they're stars we have 12 the
[58:49] first Bible had 12 characters or figures
[58:52] they call it the houses of the zodiac as
[58:57] we have 12 months all of us were born in
[58:59] one month or the other so those were the
[59:01] 12 characters major characters you can
[59:04] name them we know that the Aries Christ
[59:06] was born in Aries because it was a
[59:07] sacrifice on to the world and whatever
[59:10] please are you a born you have that
[59:12] nature is new amen
[59:14] I was born in Libra and that is my
[59:16] husband each other as a Libra is in the
[59:19] natural inner spiritual so God ordained
[59:22] you before the foundation of the world
[59:23] now all the stuff that we see in the
[59:26] atmosphere they represent
[59:28] sons and daughters of God India
[59:30] attributes amen
[59:33] every star in the atmosphere is talking
[59:35] about you and I amen we don't worship
[59:38] them but then they depict our glory on
[59:40] earth so the provinces are before God
[59:43] even does something on the upon the
[59:44] earth he reveals it in the heavens amen
[59:47] and we have three kinds of heavens
[59:49] we have eternity since dimension we have
[59:52] the atmosphere the skies and the church
[59:54] is heaven amen
[59:55] the church is not a Foursquare Bolton
[59:57] the chess is you and you are having
[1:00:00] buddy-buddy goose baptism so when a
[1:00:03] demacia he read us that that Bible that
[1:00:06] was his Bible now God oh did not end up
[1:00:10] to to read a second Bible the first
[1:00:12] Bible God rooted himself now the second
[1:00:14] Bobby knock where profit was a profit
[1:00:16] and profit have got ability to speak
[1:00:19] things into creation and to speak things
[1:00:21] out of creation amen when Adam went go
[1:00:24] let's go back to other sorry Abraham
[1:00:26] when God spoke a ram into creation for
[1:00:30] Abraham to sacrifice the next moment
[1:00:33] Abraham took the RAM out of creation but
[1:00:35] but up from creation but out of this
[1:00:38] creation
[1:00:39] amen prophet can speak things into
[1:00:42] creation they can't speak cancer out of
[1:00:44] creation this can speak healing into you
[1:00:47] and what our prophet don't look at
[1:00:49] Jeremiah Isaiah Jesus Christ yes they
[1:00:53] were Prophet William Brown by you a
[1:00:55] prophet if God only listen you amen you
[1:00:58] may not travel around the world seven
[1:01:00] times but you can travel in your home
[1:01:01] seven times
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:09] maybe mono go to Europe or your life but
[1:01:12] in your home and your loved ones you can
[1:01:14] stab little random seven times and below
[1:01:16] the power is in you because price is you
[1:01:22] you are not less than God you are Christ
[1:01:24] in an attribute in a manifestation so if
[1:01:27] you've got Christ to you by the Holy
[1:01:29] Ghost baptism
[1:01:29] what about Christ can do whatever the
[1:01:32] Prophet can do you can do it all the
[1:01:39] creation everything going on here they
[1:01:41] are doing according to the Word of God
[1:01:43] Christ in you all of them consists
[1:01:47] because of Christ and if Christ is in
[1:01:49] you the creasing consists because of you
[1:01:52] so when a knock spoon scientists are
[1:01:55] trying to find out how they build a
[1:01:56] pyramid in Egypt there's a kind of found
[1:01:59] out hard critic as turns rock Wayne at
[1:02:02] Haun's 20,000 tons are putting put in
[1:02:04] the atmosphere it wasn't a fiscal humor
[1:02:07] me but there was a creative power of God
[1:02:08] because it not has to live a symbol of
[1:02:11] justification so enough body primate by
[1:02:15] speaking into creation as a symbol that
[1:02:17] God has justified the earth God wasn't
[1:02:20] going to destroy the earth is was going
[1:02:22] to redeem the eighth so when he was
[1:02:24] raptured quickly and Noah went to wake
[1:02:26] we don't know what know about the act
[1:02:28] and now in those times they had a
[1:02:31] scientists who a more advanced than what
[1:02:33] we have now and they can shoot atoms
[1:02:37] into the skies we can do things and so
[1:02:39] trillion the Rhydian things they did it
[1:02:42] they kind of they kind of dislodged the
[1:02:44] earth induce time before Adam like I
[1:02:47] said I hardly didn't read this vibe
[1:02:49] would hurt the skies didn't even have
[1:02:51] Klaus clouds begin to form when Noah
[1:02:56] came into the air
[1:02:57] amen Noah was a critter because he was
[1:03:00] part of Christ and the Klaus will also
[1:03:03] be part of the Bible we're going to talk
[1:03:05] about Jesus coming in Klaus soon as you
[1:03:08] meet Klaus for Jesus to come in so their
[1:03:10] prophet a prophet Noah has to bring crap
[1:03:13] clouds into creation so that Jesus can
[1:03:16] come in cloud they may 1963 they a class
[1:03:21] of glory not only the natural class but
[1:03:23] a few funnies you and I were they in 63
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:29] we went our Father Jesus Christ our
[1:03:31] husband Jesus Christ to reveal our self
[1:03:34] that we are a tenor and we live here
[1:03:36] gloriously eternal amen
[1:03:39] so now in the pyramid that not a sorry
[1:03:43] Noah built the prophet has got seven
[1:03:45] steps like the zodiac has got twelve
[1:03:49] houses it has got Christ who is God on
[1:03:52] the Sun the moon with the wife of Christ
[1:03:54] twelve stars who added boost up with the
[1:03:58] twelve tribes of Israel and all the
[1:04:00] stars that represents you and I and all
[1:04:02] the sons of God from Adam on to the last
[1:04:05] one everyone is represented in the Klaus
[1:04:07] now the pyramid has got seven steps
[1:04:10] which were to foreshadow the seven
[1:04:12] church ages seven messengers that will
[1:04:14] come now when you go to the permit every
[1:04:17] prophet has to have a piece the base is
[1:04:19] the Alpha you come bought a house in the
[1:04:22] skies you have to have a foundation so
[1:04:24] the foundation was the Alpha that was
[1:04:26] Jesus Christ who laid the cornerstone
[1:04:28] for us then he bought seven Church ages
[1:04:31] out of the seven Church ages who was
[1:04:33] going to marry from the seven through
[1:04:34] the seven steps from Paul up to brown up
[1:04:37] to Elijah now they were all body of one
[1:04:40] wife the wife is no mean is one but we
[1:04:42] are many it has a matter of billions or
[1:04:44] trillions we are members of the one wife
[1:04:46] of Christ
[1:04:48] we don't believe in Trinity we believe
[1:04:50] in one Christ and Christ has one wife
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:54] glory hallelujah now when you plug the
[1:04:57] parameter first step to the service that
[1:04:59] before you go to they have a capstone
[1:05:00] that's really good keys
[1:05:02] Simba now when you get to the seventh
[1:05:04] step there's a there's an there's a
[1:05:06] messenger who is standing there a strong
[1:05:09] messenger that if you want to go to the
[1:05:11] King's Chamber want to marry to the king
[1:05:13] they can ask goddess orders through the
[1:05:15] messenger now you have to strip yourself
[1:05:17] as brother I was preaching yesterday we
[1:05:19] have to come and strip ourself not
[1:05:22] naturally but spiritually naturally one
[1:05:24] can strip yourself or a husband but a

[1:11:38] message from God hiding in simplicity
[1:11:40] then revealing himself in the same 1963
[1:11:46] God hiding yourself in simplicity and
[1:11:49] revealing himself in the same paragraph
[1:11:51] 3 7 9 it's talking about resurrection is
[1:11:56] that and when they say their griefs who
[1:11:57] open how is the graves
[1:11:59] going to open well when I haven't got a
[1:12:02] time to get into this what I wanted to
[1:12:05] I'm going to have to take this see just
[1:12:07] to show you the simplicity of God and
[1:12:10] that calcium put potage and everything
[1:12:13] everything that is in you of materials
[1:12:15] only mix a spoonful their flesh when you
[1:12:19] burn it is just a spoonful that's right
[1:12:21] and what that does it breathe back into
[1:12:24] that spirit and life God speaks and the
[1:12:27] rapture will come it ain't going out
[1:12:29] there and NGOs come down and shovel up
[1:12:32] the graves and get up get out and old
[1:12:35] dead carcass here what is this it was
[1:12:37] born in sin paragraph paragraph 161
[1:12:42] cities sorry
[1:12:44] let me read further down but now a new
[1:12:46] one made in his likeness you know if you
[1:12:49] have this if you have this flesh will
[1:12:52] die again see the graves will open the
[1:12:55] dead shall rise that might be true but
[1:12:57] not open the way you say open scene so
[1:13:00] let's pause here the Prophet is an
[1:13:03] aggressive book in the Dead will rise
[1:13:05] thou be true but not the way you say
[1:13:07] open so we have to find out a way you
[1:13:09] and I say open how do we say open we
[1:13:13] think that one day God is going to come
[1:13:15] go to I don't know where the cemeteries
[1:13:17] are I think there's one close to Palm
[1:13:18] Beach and God when Ray's dead bodies
[1:13:21] angels will come and she'll go and get a
[1:13:23] caucus no that is not that is not
[1:13:25] resurrection and that is nobody day and
[1:13:27] he said now even if you bring that one
[1:13:29] out just like Lazarus you should go back
[1:13:31] to the dust amen
[1:13:33] but then he said not not the way you say
[1:13:37] open it will be that way now when is God
[1:13:40] opens God comes by the spoking wait
[1:13:42] gas grill opening is what we came to
[1:13:44] this earth through
[1:13:45] death of Adam by in our graveyard the F
[1:13:49] sin was the graveyard we were buried
[1:13:51] into my all in the tombstone of sin and
[1:13:53] unbelief because we were born wrong when
[1:13:57] Obama is cooking with just life but at
[1:13:58] Troy towards that drinking smoking is
[1:14:02] nice and I just attribute arson but sin
[1:14:04] is unbelief what is unbelief Satan
[1:14:08] Lucifer Satan
[1:14:10] if Crossan was contrary to what God
[1:14:13] wanted so now what is sin and that was
[1:14:16] how we came by so we came as dead people
[1:14:19] do we were strong and working in crying
[1:14:21] as babies but we're dead in sin and
[1:14:23] iniquity so Christ comes by the Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost baptism and come and resurrect us
[1:14:28] by the voice of resurrection what is
[1:14:30] that voice voice coming from the
[1:14:32] ministry speaking the word into creation
[1:14:34] just like God speak his children from
[1:14:37] his hat and mouth amen
[1:14:39] God is an echo echo has got the greatest
[1:14:42] scene of all the animals or the best and
[1:14:45] animals and God can speak and his peace
[1:14:48] his children by the spoken word into
[1:14:51] creation it's a supernatural creation
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:54] as we are speaking are discrete in sons
[1:14:56] and daughters Albert a job preaches
[1:14:57] critten sons and daughters but you
[1:14:59] cannot see it physically just like Ruth
[1:15:01] you can take your child children are
[1:15:03] growing you can buy a post I will not
[1:15:06] let you sleep for three weeks you will
[1:15:08] see how to grow your hair is growing you
[1:15:12] can keep watching it for this and this
[1:15:13] without even if you don't wanna sleep
[1:15:15] you never find out it's a mystery in
[1:15:17] Supernatural the symptom is the Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost baptism it doesn't come like and
[1:15:23] now a baby being born but now it's a
[1:15:25] supernatural creation as we were here
[1:15:27] there's another dimension that is going
[1:15:30] on right here but it's a faster
[1:15:33] dimension as we are here people are
[1:15:35] going through hell before drinking
[1:15:37] fornicating smoking is a demon which
[1:15:41] lives in man the devil and he manifests
[1:15:43] himself now Christ is here on earth in
[1:15:46] you and he is manifesting himself by the
[1:15:49] attribute that is in him now on the
[1:15:51] system ation there are angels right here
[1:15:54] the Astrid right here the aspect of God
[1:15:57] Holy Ghost yet
[1:15:59] this year is you and I we have got
[1:16:01] endless right here you've got your
[1:16:02] guardian angels but if God permit you to
[1:16:05] see your own garden and you probably you
[1:16:06] pass out there was a time I was preen
[1:16:12] when I had it I had a message first one
[1:16:13] that's a Lord
[1:16:14] I wanted to see your glory should be
[1:16:16] your glory I was in college and I was
[1:16:18] praying I have a tree that I pray and
[1:16:20] elaborate I said find your own color I
[1:16:22] like Brittany woods

[1:16:25] was praying and like a like a wind
[1:16:29] coming
[1:16:30] it was scary to death I got on my knees
[1:16:33] and ran away the glory of God is
[1:16:42] different for the blessings of God you
[1:16:45] can't come in his blessing you can't
[1:16:46] dance and shout and rejoice that is
[1:16:49] Christ in his blessing but when it comes
[1:16:52] personally to you he in you it is not a
[1:16:55] joke that's what the professor that they
[1:16:58] don't even get used to angels because
[1:17:00] the holiness of the angel is sooo
[1:17:02] supernatural and so cool in that this
[1:17:04] earthly man which has what blast system
[1:17:06] is not meant to encounter it so it is
[1:17:09] got Greece to encounter it i'ma buy in
[1:17:11] my room San Antonio I was praying one
[1:17:13] time I have I pray my closet I pray my
[1:17:16] kitchen I have different before my

[1:17:28] the frequency vibration right here
[1:17:31] somebody standing there yes I was the
[1:17:32] only person pray there was nobody in my
[1:17:33] house but I could see this man right
[1:17:36] here in the in another dimension yes I
[1:17:39] could see the present so holy and so
[1:17:41] fearful I back off some went out from
[1:17:44] the bathroom to the living room then
[1:17:46] came back on 2 to 3 it is not a joke so
[1:17:49] crisis in you but he also break himself
[1:17:51] in a form that you can take it when you
[1:17:55] are sleeping the Holy Ghost doesn't go
[1:17:56] to sleep he's waking heal sickness who
[1:18:00] doesn't be manifesting a symptom that's
[1:18:02] how much he loves you
[1:18:04] some signals can come in a symptom and
[1:18:06] you Pro Lord bring prayer requests but
[1:18:09] some things you don't mean see the
[1:18:10] sickness the
[1:18:11] takes it away certain attacks the law
[1:18:13] doesn't let you see it the devil could
[1:18:15] have taken your life in the night but as
[1:18:17] angel of the Lord there's a pillar of
[1:18:19] fire in you that's said this is my child
[1:18:21] seat and you cannot touch him until I'm
[1:18:24] done with you he loves you and I get
[1:18:32] sensitive to that presence the more we
[1:18:35] see the glory of God in our life that's
[1:18:37] why we pray and fast that when you free
[1:18:40] Yousef read this guy here so that the
[1:18:42] one on the inside can have the
[1:18:44] preeminence glory hallelujah
[1:18:46] he's here God is not many up is not in
[1:18:49] thousands of miles away no he's right
[1:18:52] here in this dimension one time I was
[1:18:54] driving I remember in San Antonio and I
[1:18:56] liked singing I don't have a good voice
[1:18:58] but I like to sing so I was making a
[1:19:00] little noise on to the Lord and I was at
[1:19:02] traffic so I stopped red light and it's
[1:19:04] like somebody push my foot on the bricks
[1:19:07] and I was wondering what's going on here
[1:19:10] little did I know that I didn't
[1:19:11] completely stop a break
[1:19:13] so my vicar was moving slowly you could
[1:19:16] have hidden this vehicle but it's the
[1:19:18] one who lives he that is in you I knew
[1:19:21] what this guy didn't know so he pushed
[1:19:23] my left foot or what to start a brick
[1:19:25] and I said Lord how loving you are that
[1:19:29] is how much he loves me sometime I don't
[1:19:31] think that is with you you might know
[1:19:32] everything is in you you might think oh
[1:19:34] look at my problem that's what your mind
[1:19:36] tells me yeah look at all these problems
[1:19:38] before me in my family in mind this in
[1:19:41] this but when he that is in you when he
[1:19:44] appears that he loves you see you amen
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:56] blessed be the Lord remain now back to
[1:20:01] our topic
[1:20:01] the true is that the Easter we had 2,000
[1:20:05] years of Easter 2,000 years but Jesus
[1:20:08] Christ our Father our our elder brother
[1:20:11] the firstfruits who resurrected who said
[1:20:14] I've got power to live and live my life
[1:20:16] down and I've got part to pick it up
[1:20:18] back amen
[1:20:20] when he died his body was on a cross one
[1:20:23] person his soul was in hell judging the
[1:20:26] sinners and unbelief who didn't believe
[1:20:28] their prophet in the terms of Adam in
[1:20:31] the in the other times up to Jesus the
[1:20:33] Lord was judging those who's now his
[1:20:35] spirit was in heaven wasn't was in
[1:20:37] heaven judging the universe controlling
[1:20:39] the universe one person his flesh was on
[1:20:42] on earth his soul was in hell and his
[1:20:45] pit was in heaven I'm the son of man who
[1:20:48] lives on earth and live in heaven at the
[1:20:50] same time so you yes you're his body was
[1:20:52] dead as dead could be but in Christ God
[1:20:55] cannot die he only died in the flesh
[1:20:58] that's why the Bible teaches the
[1:21:00] Christians do not die in the flesh years
[1:21:02] in this dimension we cry we lose our
[1:21:05] loved ones and we cry be sure we go
[1:21:06] through peace but in the other dimension
[1:21:08] there's another man in you that does not
[1:21:11] die his antenna is right here
[1:21:14] amen when his brother Brahms wife sister
[1:21:17] Bella's mom died and she was true friend
[1:21:20] crying of course she didn't see their
[1:21:22] mom she was thinking oh I see a Sunday
[1:21:24] in glory but her mom was standing right
[1:21:26] there watching her own cups they made
[1:21:29] system it up sister Hooper Browns first
[1:21:32] wife died everyone was going through
[1:21:34] painful times could even commit suicide
[1:21:35] his wife came literally and put his arms
[1:21:38] around him said bill don't cry
[1:21:41] keep on preaching the word I'm so happy
[1:21:48] where I am
[1:21:50] angels coming to meet me women in white
[1:21:52] garment best singing trees beautiful and
[1:21:55] everything good in streets but the
[1:21:57] Prophet himself didn't you know at that
[1:21:58] time I didn't have the revelation
[1:22:00] yet so he was brooding and going through
[1:22:02] pains but his wife was right there I
[1:22:05] came in a few funny to comfort him and
[1:22:08] after he vanished into rainbow and he
[1:22:10] went back to the blue the element back

[1:22:34] loves your cheerful our cheerfulness he
[1:22:38] permitted problems to come because he's
[1:22:40] want to do something so when you see a
[1:22:42] problem don't look to the problem be
[1:22:44] like a Elijah Elisha Wenger has he was
[1:22:46] crying because they were surrounded he
[1:22:49] was I mean drink elaborate Jeffrey Lewis

[1:23:16] see angels around that you were
[1:23:17] surrounded

[1:23:21] as most surrounding in him and around
[1:23:23] him amen
[1:23:24] and just by speaker wait it's a lot
[1:23:27] opened a young man's eyes and the Lord
[1:23:29] open his eyes and he saw the plots of
[1:23:31] fire all around them glory hallelujah so
[1:23:35] on time you know we don't even know how

[1:26:05] is higher so we use the natural language
[1:26:07] above above look above afternoon here

[1:26:13] stronger and a higher more magnificant
[1:26:16] dimension a more stronger rim it means

[1:27:13] raised his mother and father and started
[1:27:15] a father is Indian background then his
[1:27:19] Irish background is all his region and

[1:29:56] system element but your body has been
[1:29:59] glorified is becoming a spoken word of

[1:31:15] necessary ordinary man maybe five foot
[1:31:20] six or something like that he was fast
[1:31:22] not that time he didn't have it wasn't
[1:31:24] fat it was maybe a skinny person all
[1:31:27] your burdens and my bearings were on him
[1:31:29] so he couldn't eat so much like maybe we
[1:31:31] can eat
[1:31:32] but then he was God Almighty he was a
[1:31:36] hundred percent human being and had a
[1:31:38] percent man when he was born they had to
[1:31:39] circumcise him you don't circumcise few
[1:31:41] funny circumcising my beans
[1:31:44] he eats food you funny doesn't eat food
[1:31:47] you funny when he put on flesh amen
[1:31:50] but he was he preached and he was so
[1:31:53] tired he was sleeping on the boots just
[1:31:55] like a bug preach it and he's tired
[1:31:57] maybe somebody has to drive him and his
[1:31:59] baby sister Erica we driving him and his
[1:32:01] fast asleep as a human being now there
[1:32:04] was a storm that was said is the right
[1:32:06] time to drown this guy that I've had a
[1:32:08] little revelation by no match so he knew
[1:32:10] that there's something in him there's
[1:32:13] something in this guy he's messing up my
[1:32:15] kingdom is going to take my kingdom for
[1:32:17] me so I have to drown him so he created
[1:32:19] a strong the water have got power over
[1:32:21] the element of his head so get it a
[1:32:24] storm from no way they were talking
[1:32:27] about the pmq I haven't Reviva talking
[1:32:29] about the way the Lord preached trying
[1:32:30] to digest the way oh he said this one

[1:32:48] sleep as a human being and saw the storm
[1:32:51] coming he said peace bestow and a storm
[1:32:55] just destroyed off because he that was
[1:32:59] in him Jesus Christ was greater and
[1:33:01] order stone and the same Jesus came into
[1:33:05] Peter
[1:33:05] Alba Latroy told us yesterday that Peter
[1:33:08] was impetus shadow Peter was a human
[1:33:09] being by the pillar of other people's

[1:38:29] message that even understand what is
[1:38:30] divine healing I didn't know what it is
[1:38:32] but the first thought it was pretty to
[1:38:33] me there's something in me said wow
[1:38:35] there's going to be my life for my time
[1:38:37] because I didn't like medicine until I
[1:38:39] take medication so I begin to believe it
[1:38:42] and before I realised I could believe
[1:38:44] for my own healing when I was sick just
[1:38:46] give me my Bible my checkbook give me a
[1:38:48] CD give me something I can read
[1:38:51] I don't care what kind of sickness I
[1:38:53] read them believed and a lot human and
[1:38:57] one day in Connecticut one brother asked
[1:38:59] me that there's a lady who he pretty
[1:39:01] study about the five comings of Elijah
[1:39:03] is that brother let's go ed he's the
[1:39:06] lady went to Bible school so she was
[1:39:07] giving me some questions I could
[1:39:08] understand let's go and helped me out we
[1:39:10] went and we explained the five comments
[1:39:12] of Elijah to the lady after she broke
[1:39:14] into tears she was an african-american
[1:39:16] lady she said I've got cancer and the
[1:39:19] cancer still eating into my wound and
[1:39:21] all my chest I had a tumor like four
[1:39:25] years ago and they wanted to treat me
[1:39:26] with chemo but I refused to me because
[1:39:28] chemo kills you faster than the cancer
[1:39:30] so I didn't accept it I was trusting the
[1:39:32] Lord to heal me she was a Pentecostal
[1:39:34] lady and said that the cancer has gone
[1:39:37] beyond out of proportion and it was life
[1:39:40] and then she has only one son brother
[1:39:41] the moment she told me that just like
[1:39:44] her life was on my hands so the brother
[1:39:46] that took me is a white brother I said

[1:40:10] the Lord heal you are you gonna stop
[1:40:12] wearing pants she said I didn't love it

[1:41:31] beginning
[1:41:31] it is healing it is joy and peace and
[1:41:34] blessing its eternity that's where the
[1:41:38] Sun shines
[1:41:39] I believe that son of God I shall open
[1:41:41] the lid we went and she was in bed said
[1:41:44] there was no cancer so what they said
[1:41:47] the cancer has been there for four years
[1:41:49] tomorrow and now it's growing out of
[1:41:51] proportion he said there was an Indian
[1:41:53] doctor who didn't believe in God and I
[1:41:55] testified swear there was God said oh

[1:42:23] out of what you call it a necessity to
[1:42:26] the wall we can understand we can
[1:42:28] explain but for some reason the cancer
[1:42:29] is not day she says she jump out on the
[1:42:31] bed and prison the Lord running out a
[1:42:34] hospital telling everybody in the
[1:42:36] doctors came and grabbed her that you

[1:45:34] this appreciate the Lord again for a
[1:45:37] precious minute I just enjoy just how
[1:45:47] the Lord uses him and as he was just
[1:45:50] preaching there tonight I was thinking
[1:45:51] about the sermon that he shared with us
[1:45:55] once before how you can't take your your
[1:46:00] phone charger to the FPL power plant and
[1:46:06] try to plug it in you know to the big
[1:46:08] power plant so you go out there and try
[1:46:10] to plug that you'll you'll get fried and
[1:46:12] it's if you didn't even if you try to
[1:46:14] touch one of the Transformers out here
[1:46:17] you want to take it I'm gonna just plug
[1:46:18] in and get some power and get this thing
[1:46:20] charged you'll get fried and they say
[1:46:23] what happens is that they have to step
[1:46:24] it down they have to keep stepping it
[1:46:27] down in order to this that that better
[1:46:29] electricity is so powerful that if they
[1:46:31] didn't step it down amen it would just
[1:46:34] do damage to you and I just love the way
[1:46:36] that you know the Lord use them because
[1:46:37] you constantly have to just step it down
[1:46:39] step it down step it down so make sure
[1:46:41] the people catch him what he's trying to
[1:46:43] say you know
[1:46:44] and just just God as God is good god is
[1:46:48] good god is God is real good I was just
[1:46:51] blessed by that Easter is not like he
[1:46:55] said is you know how people taking
[1:46:57] crosses and putting them on their backs
[1:46:59] and some acting out the crucifixion but
[1:47:02] they're missing that jesus is alive and
[1:47:05] doing the very same thing he did when he
[1:47:08] was on earth and then Easter has a lot
[1:47:11] to do with us today the truth Easter
[1:47:13] true Easter is when you begin to see
[1:47:15] yourself in the word right they may you
[1:47:17] begin to see your place so we thank God
[1:47:20] for this Amen tonight let's give the

[1:51:49] the Lord just come to our hearts
[1:51:53] understanding what the true Easter is
[1:51:55] all about it's not just the event that
[1:51:59] happened some 2,000 years ago but oh god
[1:52:04] it's it's fresh it's a living amen even
[1:52:08] today and when we think about the
[1:52:11] Prophet told us that a resurrection a
[1:52:13] man is not a replacement but it's the
[1:52:17] very same thing that went down came up
[1:52:20] again and the reason that we can declare
[1:52:22] that you are living because we see you
[1:52:25] manifested in our hearts and in our
[1:52:27] lives we are Amen the hands and feet of
[1:52:32] Jesus today if somebody was looking for
[1:52:35] Christ they would have to look to us and
[1:52:38] as brother quick was talking about how
[1:52:40] the Sun was shining but then the moon
[1:52:42] would come out and God it was a type of
[1:52:44] Christ shining at one time within your
[1:52:47] bride shining at another time and
[1:52:50] like that the moon receives as the light
[1:52:52] that it receives from the Sun
