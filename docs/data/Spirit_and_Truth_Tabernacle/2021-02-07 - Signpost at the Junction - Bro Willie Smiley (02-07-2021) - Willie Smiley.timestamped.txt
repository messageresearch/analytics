[52:26] make up church
[52:28] if you can keep couples strong you can

[52:33] that right and it's important that you
[52:35] be a part of things like that you never

[1:01:23] had it about 20
[1:01:24] years ago and brother troy and jack and
[1:01:27] all of them my father-in-law my
[1:01:29] mother-in-law lamar came to the hospital
[1:01:31] uh to see me and i'm sitting in a weird
[1:01:33] chair they laughed at me
[1:01:35] all i could do is keep my head like this
[1:01:37] because if i move it everything was
[1:01:39] spinning
[1:01:41] but i contemplated uh i
[1:01:45] felt like calling brother jack but i
[1:01:47] said you know what i'd rather be in
[1:01:48] church than to be sitting home
[1:01:51] i'm one that you know what when the
[1:01:53] church door is open i like to be in
[1:01:55] church
[1:01:56] i don't know about other folk i got the
[1:01:57] kind of holy ghost that enjoys
[1:02:00] being in church i was blessed on
[1:02:03] wednesday night by listening to brother
[1:02:05] jack on
[1:02:06] the internet i like ain't nothing like
[1:02:09] being right there in the midst
[1:02:14] right being able to pull on the word of
[1:02:16] god but i still thank god for
[1:02:18] these outlets and everything so y'all
[1:02:21] pray for me
[1:02:23] y'all pray for me cause i ain't been
[1:02:25] steady for a few days on my feet but
[1:02:28] i got the devil whooped i didn't got
[1:02:30] this far
[1:02:34] i don't know i just made it to the
[1:02:35] pulpit now
[1:02:38] so uh we'll just see how the lord leads
[1:02:41] us
[1:02:42] i might i might i told brother troy i
[1:02:45] said you know what i might need two
[1:02:46] soldiers to stand up and hold me up
[1:02:49] but we're gonna we're gonna make it
[1:02:50] through by the grace of god you know
[1:02:52] moses got a little weak
[1:02:55] and two brothers you know cause as long
[1:02:57] as his hands was up he
[1:02:58] brother solomon he was getting the
[1:03:00] victory and his hand went down
[1:03:02] two anointed brothers got up under him
[1:03:04] and held him up
[1:03:06] so if it looked like i need some holding
[1:03:08] up just come hold me up
[1:03:09] you know they just have to hold up the
[1:03:11] brother brandon right
[1:03:13] amen so you know that's a part you know
[1:03:16] brother jack been preaching on different
[1:03:17] things that you're supposed to do that's
[1:03:19] just a part of it
[1:03:20] right so let us let us start in the book
[1:03:22] of acts chapter 2
[1:03:24] uh uh verse 1 it says and when the day
[1:03:28] of pentecost was fully
[1:03:29] come they were all with one accord in
[1:03:32] one place
[1:03:33] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:03:35] heaven
[1:03:37] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:03:39] filled all the house where they were
[1:03:41] sitting
[1:03:42] and they appeared unto them clothing uh
[1:03:45] tongues like
[1:03:46] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:03:49] and they were all
[1:03:50] filled with the holy ghost and began to
[1:03:52] speak
[1:03:53] uh with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:03:56] them
[1:03:56] utterance and there uh were dwelling at
[1:04:01] jerusalem jews devout men out of every
[1:04:04] nation under the heaven
[1:04:07] now when this was nosed abroad the
[1:04:10] multitude came together
[1:04:12] and were confounded because that every
[1:04:15] man
[1:04:16] heard them speak in his own language
[1:04:19] and they were all amazed and marveled
[1:04:22] saying one to another behold
[1:04:25] are not all these which speak galileans
[1:04:29] and how here we every man in his
[1:04:33] in our own tongue wherein we were born
[1:04:37] and i'm going to skip some of this
[1:04:39] clement jack them words up for you real
[1:04:41] quick
[1:04:42] uh but it says let's get down to the
[1:04:45] 11th verse
[1:04:46] said that the cretes and the arabians
[1:04:49] were
[1:04:50] uh we do hear them speak in our tongues
[1:04:53] the wonderful works of god
[1:04:56] and they were all amazed and were in
[1:05:00] doubt saying one to another
[1:05:03] what meaneth this
[1:05:07] and others mark saying these men are
[1:05:09] full of new wine but peter standing up
[1:05:12] with the 11 lifted up his voice and said
[1:05:14] unto them
[1:05:15] ye men of judea and all
[1:05:20] ye that dwell in jerusalem be this known
[1:05:23] unto you
[1:05:24] uh and talking to my words for these are
[1:05:27] not drunk as you suppose
[1:05:29] uh seeing that this is the third hour of
[1:05:31] the day but this is that which was
[1:05:34] spoken by
[1:05:35] joelle the prophet joel
[1:05:39] may the lord add a blessing to his word
[1:05:41] this morning he may be seated
[1:05:44] we like to um this morning take from
[1:05:46] that a little
[1:05:47] title um signed the signposts
[1:05:52] at the junction um
[1:05:56] y'all just kind of bear with me i'm kind
[1:05:59] of in
[1:05:59] unfamiliar territory here a little bit i
[1:06:02] i kind of i'm in my mind i realize i'm
[1:06:07] having to kind of readjust myself
[1:06:09] uh uh put myself on
[1:06:12] the same frequency as uh brother jack
[1:06:16] and the minister brother here
[1:06:18] as y'all know we thank god we've we've
[1:06:21] we're here uh this morning and things
[1:06:24] is changing uh we we thank god for the
[1:06:27] privilege of pastoring
[1:06:29] for just about 23 years but things has
[1:06:32] changed so
[1:06:33] with change you know you i've grown and
[1:06:36] i've learned something you got to kind
[1:06:38] of be
[1:06:39] a little bit more spiritual in this hour
[1:06:42] i've kind of
[1:06:44] been the guiding force for 23 years but
[1:06:47] uh
[1:06:48] now we're working with a a a ministry
[1:06:51] and brother jack
[1:06:52] is the pastor and uh we we want to
[1:06:55] we want to try to make make sure that
[1:06:57] we're on the same
[1:06:59] uh frequency as him
[1:07:02] you know i'm not here to try to prove
[1:07:04] anything to anybody y'all know me i've
[1:07:07] known me for a long time
[1:07:09] i'm not here at any time to prove how
[1:07:12] much i know
[1:07:13] uh i'm not in a competition with any
[1:07:16] other preaching brothers here
[1:07:18] i don't have a preaching itch like i
[1:07:20] just said i've been preaching for like
[1:07:22] 27 some years
[1:07:24] pastoring for almost 23 years but
[1:07:27] uh i was i've been kind of just sitting
[1:07:30] back and just
[1:07:31] listening you know as you get older you
[1:07:34] you learn
[1:07:34] how to you learn how to listen more than
[1:07:39] you
[1:07:39] do run in your mouth when you young you
[1:07:41] run your mouth a lot
[1:07:44] i remember i remember now y'all pray
[1:07:46] with me i'm gonna
[1:07:47] i'm gonna get there this morning you
[1:07:50] know i
[1:07:50] i i'm reminded of when i was when i was
[1:07:53] young
[1:07:54] and uh maybe in my early 20s and i used
[1:07:57] to work my uncle he was in his 40s at
[1:07:59] the time and
[1:08:00] uh you know he used to be trying to
[1:08:02] educate
[1:08:03] me and me and one of my cousins and uh
[1:08:06] before he
[1:08:07] he could even get the question now we uh
[1:08:10] yeah
[1:08:10] i know i know and one day he told i wish
[1:08:13] i'd just shut up
[1:08:16] he said because y'all got the answer
[1:08:18] before y'all even know what the question
[1:08:20] is
[1:08:21] and a lot of times that that's what the
[1:08:23] thing that you find with people
[1:08:26] they think they have the answers
[1:08:29] don't really fully understand the
[1:08:31] question yet
[1:08:33] but they got the answer and so
[1:08:36] you know just listening to the different
[1:08:38] brethren over the last couple of weeks i
[1:08:40] just kind of been uh inspired i thought
[1:08:43] i'd go a different way but maybe we'd go
[1:08:45] that way the next time
[1:08:47] by the grace of god uh but as i was
[1:08:49] studying i
[1:08:50] had to call brother jack to find out how
[1:08:52] far he was going
[1:08:54] uh into his junction sermons because i
[1:08:57] didn't want to get in the way because i
[1:08:58] want to hear
[1:09:00] everything that god has has inspired him
[1:09:03] to minister
[1:09:04] and he said he's preaching on the seven
[1:09:06] junctions
[1:09:07] so i said well i'll just kind of stay
[1:09:09] behind him and uh
[1:09:11] uh preach from you know what he leaves
[1:09:15] you know and as you know just as i was
[1:09:18] studying it's been
[1:09:19] some things i just know by memory and
[1:09:21] some things that
[1:09:23] you know i have to go back and restart
[1:09:25] it's been a long time since i've even uh
[1:09:28] uh read the junction of time but i i
[1:09:31] went back and i was just kind of um
[1:09:34] studying it uh on the junction of time
[1:09:37] um you know just like you say just
[1:09:41] following the inspiration of the holy
[1:09:43] spirit
[1:09:44] and and you know just thinking about
[1:09:46] just all of the things that i've heard
[1:09:48] from brother troy even with the meetings
[1:09:51] and brother jack
[1:09:52] and just a little inspiration just kind
[1:09:56] of even
[1:09:56] um struck my heart um
[1:09:59] um you know anybody that knows me and
[1:10:03] the saints that kind of came up with me
[1:10:05] the last few years
[1:10:07] you know i'm i enjoy good worship
[1:10:10] services and and all of that i've said
[1:10:13] that here several times
[1:10:15] but but what i i i do believe
[1:10:19] from from my uh perspective
[1:10:22] we we we lack spiritual
[1:10:25] understanding right we we really do as
[1:10:29] as uh
[1:10:29] church not i'm not gonna
[1:10:31] dis-christianize anybody
[1:10:33] this morning that's not that's not what
[1:10:35] i'm here to do
[1:10:36] uh because we we all realize we all
[1:10:38] gotta grow and we we gotta mature
[1:10:41] right but i still think that we
[1:10:44] we we lack spiritual
[1:10:47] understanding and as i was as i was
[1:10:50] studying it was like the holy spirit
[1:10:52] started just really dealing with me like
[1:10:54] i say
[1:10:55] there's a lot of things that i know by
[1:10:57] preaching
[1:10:58] 2 000 and some messages over years
[1:11:02] but even in that you know you can go
[1:11:05] back
[1:11:05] and and and still learn more because
[1:11:08] this
[1:11:08] is uh inexhaustible gospel
[1:11:14] right just when you think you know
[1:11:16] something
[1:11:17] god can still show you some things is
[1:11:19] that right
[1:11:20] and then and sometimes it ain't even in
[1:11:22] that sometimes
[1:11:24] you know god wants to just take us back
[1:11:28] to different things because you know a
[1:11:29] lot of times this is what we do we come
[1:11:31] to church
[1:11:32] we hear a good sermon we shout we go
[1:11:34] home
[1:11:35] and we never really sit down and ponder
[1:11:40] to really get the gist
[1:11:43] the meaning why
[1:11:46] why was this sermon inspired
[1:11:49] why was this series inspired
[1:11:52] why did why did god put this on the
[1:11:55] minister the pastor these great men of
[1:11:58] god
[1:11:58] why we we don't we just kind of go home
[1:12:02] you know we go outside and then like i
[1:12:05] say i'm not
[1:12:05] criticizing anybody so so don't quit on
[1:12:08] me i'm ready i'm getting started i'm
[1:12:09] starting to feel something now
[1:12:12] but we we go outside and and we we just
[1:12:15] get excited to see each other
[1:12:17] and and and that's for a lot of of us
[1:12:21] that's it to next church time because
[1:12:24] sometimes we don't pick up our bibles no
[1:12:26] more
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:28] that's right we we don't take the time
[1:12:30] to get in the atmosphere with god
[1:12:33] and and allow god to really after the
[1:12:37] sermon
[1:12:38] to really minister
[1:12:43] minister speaking to our
[1:12:46] our hearts speaking to our condition
[1:12:50] is that right and so as i was studying
[1:12:53] even for me
[1:12:54] the holy spirit just kind of dropped
[1:12:57] what does
[1:12:58] what does this this this sermon
[1:13:01] really mean to you right
[1:13:05] because one of the things i find um
[1:13:08] when we when you look at this this acts
[1:13:11] chapter 2
[1:13:13] something was going on
[1:13:17] something was going on scripture was
[1:13:19] actually being fulfilled
[1:13:22] prophecy was being fulfilled
[1:13:26] and and and you know uh no doubt
[1:13:30] religious men right
[1:13:33] religious men church-going folk
[1:13:36] everything was right in the midst right
[1:13:39] watching what was transpiring
[1:13:42] but they were oblivious to what was
[1:13:45] actually happening
[1:13:48] right they just you know like they said
[1:13:51] you
[1:13:51] man these guys just drunk
[1:13:55] they were drunk they were drunk but not
[1:13:58] like they suppose
[1:14:00] right they didn't see here's the thing
[1:14:03] they didn't know the real meaning of
[1:14:06] what was actually taking place
[1:14:10] they had their opinion right
[1:14:13] right they're called opinions but they
[1:14:16] didn't
[1:14:16] actually understand what was taking
[1:14:19] place
[1:14:21] so they said what mean if this
[1:14:25] right what what mean is this religious
[1:14:28] people
[1:14:30] probably smart men and you know
[1:14:32] disciples who aren't weren't really
[1:14:34] smart men or anything
[1:14:36] you know but but um like they said this
[1:14:39] is that
[1:14:41] which was prophesied to take place right
[1:14:45] and as i was thinking about that i said
[1:14:48] to myself you know
[1:14:49] that that's so true
[1:14:52] that that's so true that
[1:14:56] a man can be inspired
[1:14:59] right like our messenger right like the
[1:15:02] ministry under the son of man ministry
[1:15:05] right can be so inspired to preach us a
[1:15:09] message
[1:15:10] right but we don't really comprehend the
[1:15:14] depth
[1:15:16] right what it what it really means yes
[1:15:20] right you know brother jack was and
[1:15:27] brother jack was talking about a new
[1:15:30] beginning
[1:15:31] this is a new time this this is
[1:15:34] and then i believe that in this season
[1:15:37] we need to sit back and and be more
[1:15:40] observant
[1:15:42] sit back and be more spiritual
[1:15:45] take these messages that's being
[1:15:48] preached and get in your corner
[1:15:52] and allow god to amen reveal
[1:15:57] show give us the depth
[1:16:00] amen of what's being preached
[1:16:03] what's being said and why
[1:16:07] right this this is not just a group of
[1:16:10] men just just throwing off
[1:16:12] and things of that nature well you know
[1:16:18] that's not see when it's like that it
[1:16:20] shows me how
[1:16:21] carnal uh folk are right
[1:16:25] but these things um they have
[1:16:28] they have meaning right and in this hour
[1:16:32] you know like i say as i was studying
[1:16:35] you know
[1:16:35] god stopped me okay preacher
[1:16:39] because you know preachers sometimes we
[1:16:40] we get to a point where we feel like we
[1:16:43] we know who and we not not to say what
[1:16:45] we don't know and what we do know but
[1:16:47] sometimes i think we get a little bit
[1:16:49] lifted up
[1:16:50] and things just kind of pass by us and
[1:16:54] you know our actions kind of show
[1:16:57] uh how much we're really
[1:17:01] is just you know head knowledge
[1:17:04] and what's really spiritual revelation
[1:17:08] come on come on
[1:17:11] because see one thing about me i ain't
[1:17:12] never impressed about i haven't been
[1:17:14] around for 30 something years
[1:17:16] i've heard a lot of message being
[1:17:18] preached
[1:17:19] but i'm not impressed by that anymore
[1:17:22] right praise god didn't that brother
[1:17:25] break bread then he tied
[1:17:27] magog in the and get this dead in the
[1:17:30] oven
[1:17:32] that stuff don't impress me anymore
[1:17:36] what impresses me is what we live
[1:17:40] amen uh after what's been preached
[1:17:45] that's the most impressive if we can you
[1:17:48] know
[1:17:49] lead us pulpit and become humble
[1:17:54] because i've known men to preach the
[1:17:55] gospel and then you can't even hardly
[1:17:57] you can't even hardly shake their hand
[1:18:01] i remember years and years ago uh we we
[1:18:04] none of us wasn't we weren't preachers
[1:18:06] back then we weren't even married
[1:18:09] back then uh me and brother jack we we
[1:18:12] went to a convention and uh
[1:18:15] you know we was getting ready to go on
[1:18:16] this little boat ride i don't know
[1:18:17] brother jack remember this but uh
[1:18:19] uh i looked up and saw some ministers
[1:18:23] and i'm you know i'm green i've just
[1:18:25] been saved you know a few years
[1:18:27] and hey god bless you brother so-and-so
[1:18:29] jack was like brother
[1:18:30] you ain't supposed to ban you no no
[1:18:32] don't do that you ain't supposed to uh
[1:18:35] speak to the ministers
[1:18:38] now you know i kind of grew up the rough
[1:18:41] side of the mountain
[1:18:44] you know look at jack like who they
[1:18:50] amen if they if they really got in me
[1:18:52] and you know they they
[1:18:54] want to come down and shake your hand
[1:18:56] and be in your midst and
[1:18:57] and all that you know and i know you
[1:18:59] know brother battle talked about the
[1:19:01] pastor i'm finna strike something right
[1:19:02] quick
[1:19:04] you know brother jack can't come to
[1:19:07] everybody's house
[1:19:09] he can't spend all his time with
[1:19:11] everybody
[1:19:13] he got to give his time to spiritual
[1:19:16] things
[1:19:17] i know that there's times when you know
[1:19:20] uh he'll come to your house and
[1:19:22] definitely eat your grocery but
[1:19:25] but you know don't don't be offended
[1:19:29] if if brother jack you know ain't always
[1:19:31] in your face
[1:19:32] because one thing about the church you
[1:19:34] know when i was
[1:19:36] we were in okeechobee that tell you
[1:19:39] you only see me at church time
[1:19:43] if you invite me to a fellowship and
[1:19:46] that was it now i'm off
[1:19:47] i'm out taz for a minute but this is who
[1:19:50] i am
[1:19:51] right i ain't always going to be brother
[1:19:54] capers
[1:19:56] for 23 years him and sister capers and i
[1:19:59] thank god for them they
[1:20:01] always been in my right hand uh
[1:20:04] um i've always lived no further maybe
[1:20:08] five minutes now probably about three
[1:20:10] minutes
[1:20:12] but i guarantee you they could tell you
[1:20:14] in 20-something years how many times i
[1:20:16] came to their house
[1:20:19] and they were never offended if they
[1:20:21] invited me i came
[1:20:23] other than that i didn't come why
[1:20:25] because i don't want to get that close
[1:20:26] to you where i can't preach to you
[1:20:30] i love y'all but i ain't gonna get that
[1:20:32] close to y'all where i can't preach to
[1:20:33] you while i'm here
[1:20:35] yes sir is that right so so
[1:20:38] you know uh uh give give the ministry
[1:20:41] a break right brother jack eight
[1:20:45] ain't been to your house well he might
[1:20:47] get there for the rapture
[1:20:51] and he might not
[1:20:52] [Laughter]
[1:20:55] he may not but it's all good you see
[1:20:58] this is this is where this is where i'm
[1:21:01] going some of y'all think i'm crazy when
[1:21:03] i'm talking but you got to follow me
[1:21:06] this is where his teaching comes into
[1:21:08] play
[1:21:10] right because he's been teaching on on
[1:21:13] positions and placing
[1:21:15] and things of that nature y'all still
[1:21:17] with me come on
[1:21:20] you you gotta understand the pastoral
[1:21:23] ministry
[1:21:25] right and when you understand his
[1:21:29] role then you just sit back and pray for
[1:21:32] him you like
[1:21:33] it's all good it's fine i know he's
[1:21:35] somewhere praying for me
[1:21:36] i know he's somewhere studying to bring
[1:21:38] me something that'll feed me
[1:21:40] uh spiritually right
[1:21:44] okay let's kind of maybe move on to get
[1:21:46] on task because now i ain't
[1:21:48] i ain't a pastor right now i'm kind of
[1:21:50] in evangelistic mode so
[1:21:53] uh out could be everywhere
[1:21:57] but brother branham in in in the
[1:21:59] junction of time
[1:22:01] um uh this is um quote 85.
[1:22:04] now like i this is all new to me so
[1:22:08] y'all bear with me
[1:22:10] and you know i see brother jack had that
[1:22:13] thing all lined up
[1:22:14] and this and that but i know that's not
[1:22:17] me
[1:22:18] uh jack is has a master's degree in
[1:22:22] in in computer technology
[1:22:27] i have no degrees not even a high school
[1:22:30] diploma
[1:22:31] but you can't pull that novo
[1:22:36] don't think cause y'all got these big
[1:22:37] words y'all smarter than me
[1:22:40] you get your feelings hurt
[1:22:44] all right but but
[1:22:48] watch watch the prophet he says i think
[1:22:51] this
[1:22:52] church ought to know truth
[1:22:55] right i think i if
[1:22:58] if never if you know listen give
[1:23:02] give me truth whether it skim me down or
[1:23:04] not
[1:23:06] right people don't want truth now
[1:23:09] you know we living in an age where
[1:23:12] people want this
[1:23:13] uh inoffensive type of gospel
[1:23:18] it really shows you they didn't eat the
[1:23:20] book all right
[1:23:21] because when you eat the book
[1:23:26] y'all know the scripture come on
[1:23:29] i like i like brother branham he tells i
[1:23:32] like some of the stories he tell he
[1:23:34] talks about
[1:23:35] you know uh how they grew up poor and
[1:23:38] they had to eat beans and
[1:23:40] all of this and that and he said man his
[1:23:42] mama would give him castor oil
[1:23:45] so he hated it right right says mama
[1:23:48] told him
[1:23:49] why i mean if it wasn't like this
[1:23:52] it wouldn't do you no good see truth
[1:23:56] truth make you free
[1:24:00] it's a lot of people that's bound today
[1:24:02] because they've rejected truth
[1:24:05] they they think that they're free but
[1:24:07] they're actually bound
[1:24:10] right they shall know the truth
[1:24:14] and the truth makes you free the truth
[1:24:17] liberates you come on
[1:24:21] amen not some some passive something
[1:24:25] that
[1:24:26] you know in society that we got it now
[1:24:28] where everything is
[1:24:30] you know inclusive we want this
[1:24:32] inclusive and
[1:24:34] we want to bring all of this stuff in
[1:24:36] that's not truth
[1:24:38] it's so contrary to scripture
[1:24:41] you you see the ministry so broken down
[1:24:44] and so
[1:24:45] so watered down now
[1:24:48] right right this is why it's so
[1:24:51] important
[1:24:52] to uh keep brother jack and these
[1:24:55] brethren in prayer
[1:24:58] right amen because let me tell you
[1:25:02] something
[1:25:03] it's tough preaching to people and then
[1:25:06] watching people walk out and leave you
[1:25:08] in a building
[1:25:11] right and and knowing knowing that you
[1:25:14] know in your heart you can go
[1:25:16] back man i've challenged people over
[1:25:20] 20-some years yeah right go back and
[1:25:23] listen to what i've preached
[1:25:24] not don't get caught up in my emotions
[1:25:28] go back to what i've said by
[1:25:31] inspiration of the holy spirit now
[1:25:34] that's wrong then i'm wrong all right
[1:25:37] all right
[1:25:37] right glory to god glory to god
[1:25:41] we want truth don't you just want
[1:25:44] truth glory to god if you don't want
[1:25:48] truth you can't be a christian
[1:25:53] you might could be a church member
[1:25:56] but you can't be no christian he said i
[1:25:59] think the church ought to know
[1:26:01] truth right and and and the sign where
[1:26:04] we're at
[1:26:05] right that you won't be slowful
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:13] that you that you'll be up and doing
[1:26:16] that's the difference
[1:26:18] uh that's the differences will be
[1:26:20] settled
[1:26:22] you'll walk like real godly men and
[1:26:25] women
[1:26:26] your heart set on christ and don't look
[1:26:30] into these frostings of the earth
[1:26:33] cause it's of the devil all these
[1:26:35] quarrels and wars and stripes
[1:26:38] look away from them we at the end time
[1:26:43] see we're at the end time
[1:26:48] this this these sign posters
[1:26:51] are indication to us
[1:26:54] where we are right
[1:26:58] and and if we're at the end time we
[1:27:00] don't want to be slow forward
[1:27:05] there used to be a time church
[1:27:08] man people couldn't hardly wait to get
[1:27:10] to church
[1:27:12] we got the church i'm talking about

[1:45:00] this is about
[1:45:03] right i'ma stop here right for a second
[1:45:09] see it's not brother jack is not just
[1:45:12] trying to be smart
[1:45:14] it's not that these brethren um are just
[1:45:17] trying to be smart and just trying to
[1:45:20] uh show you man how much knowledge
[1:45:24] right but they're trying to bring us an
[1:45:28] understanding things that that
[1:45:32] will help us in in our everyday life

[1:46:06] if i was humble enough to just
[1:46:09] listen to people that had a little bit

[1:55:21] nowhere
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:23] it ain't like before you know i come in
[1:55:26] and preach and then i go back to
[1:55:28] okeechobee y'all gonna see me on
[1:55:30] wednesday
[1:55:31] y'all gonna see me on sundays not unless
[1:55:34] i'm out preaching
[1:55:35] i'ma be here and i ain't afraid to look
[1:55:38] you in your face and say god bless you
[1:55:40] praise the lord
[1:55:42] i ain't one of them i ain't scared
[1:55:49] i hug your neck and buy you some chicken
[1:55:54] laugh with you but when it comes down to
[1:55:57] this pulpit i ain't gonna play with you
[1:56:00] guarantee you that amen
[1:56:04] i'm a kind loving guy but when it comes
[1:56:06] to the gospel
[1:56:08] you know yo i see one thing about it
[1:56:11] let me get the blood up off my hand bro
[1:56:13] jack
[1:56:15] right so so he says i believe that we
[1:56:17] are facing a great something that the
[1:56:19] church should know and understand
[1:56:22] that we ought to know what this is all
[1:56:24] about and find it in god's word
[1:56:27] i believe that if it's in his word
[1:56:30] i'm just a little doubt if okay if it
[1:56:34] isn't in the word i'm just a little
[1:56:36] doubtful of it
[1:56:37] but if god's word speaks of it then god
[1:56:41] uh
[1:56:42] no matter how indifferent it might seem
[1:56:44] to our customs and teaching
[1:56:48] right it's god working out his word many
[1:56:51] times
[1:56:52] it's contrary to our way of thinking
[1:56:56] uh may be the way that we have been
[1:56:59] taught to think
[1:57:00] but we have to recognize the omnipotence
[1:57:02] of god
[1:57:03] when it's performed before us see
[1:57:07] and this this is the thing that i think
[1:57:09] that have thrown so many people off over
[1:57:11] the years
[1:57:13] right is that you know and i think we
[1:57:16] can all say man to this
[1:57:18] this message has been all together
[1:57:22] beyond anything
[1:57:25] that we thought when we were in
[1:57:26] denomination
[1:57:28] and things of that nature
[1:57:31] come on come on it's just
[1:57:35] you know just the depth of it you you
[1:57:38] realize man i didn't even really know
[1:57:40] the bible
[1:57:41] right right i knew the letter maybe i
[1:57:44] could probably quote a few scriptures
[1:57:47] but but this this thing
[1:57:50] make the scripture alive
[1:57:54] more more real
[1:57:57] right glory to god because in
[1:57:59] denomination
[1:58:00] let's stop here for a second who even
[1:58:03] preached malachi
[1:58:04] 4. huh
[1:58:08] amen who preached malachi 4.
[1:58:11] luke 17 30. come on
[1:58:15] who who preached it right
[1:58:19] i had baptist preachers in the family
[1:58:22] pentecostal never heard none of them
[1:58:24] preaching malachi
[1:58:25] 4. right
[1:58:29] a ministry to forerun the coming world
[1:58:40] we never heard that you never heard
[1:58:42] outside of
[1:58:44] amen uh the message right
[1:58:49] really laying emphasis
[1:58:52] luke 17 30.
[1:58:55] right we we never heard these types of
[1:58:58] things before
[1:59:00] it's it's been something that's been
[1:59:02] beyond
[1:59:04] our thinking right
[1:59:07] you know when i was coming up man i went
[1:59:09] to church to be honest with you
[1:59:11] i went to church for the choirs because
[1:59:14] everywhere i went we always
[1:59:16] had i met every church when i went to
[1:59:18] church in jersey
[1:59:19] man or down here greater bethel they
[1:59:22] always had jumping choirs
[1:59:24] i went to a funeral a couple of weeks
[1:59:26] ago a friend of mine
[1:59:29] and i went up to the old church that i
[1:59:31] came came
[1:59:32] out of they still jumping
[1:59:37] they still jumping i said greg got
[1:59:39] everybody i've been gone about 40 years
[1:59:42] and they still
[1:59:49] but i realized i realized something that
[1:59:52] will produce a faith
[1:59:54] for change
[1:59:58] come on now see and and
[2:00:01] this so that we see you
[2:00:04] you you just got to place things in
[2:00:07] there in the
[2:00:07] in the spirits of people so so
[2:00:11] so that when when you hear the pastor
[2:00:13] come up and preach
[2:00:15] you you ride with him you you you you're
[2:00:17] like lord
[2:00:18] i i really want to understand i really

[2:00:26] want to absorb and get everything out of
[2:00:28] it
[2:00:30] right because em everything is
[2:00:32] beneficial

[2:04:08] something new
[2:04:11] right a fulfillment of scripture
[2:04:15] the son of man ministry we've been
[2:04:17] elevated into the head
[2:04:20] right and and i believe
[2:04:24] through a process and feeding on the
[2:04:28] word
[2:04:29] that there's a rapture that's taking
[2:04:31] place that's right
[2:04:34] if y'all can't say amen to that see
[2:04:37] you're missing something
[2:04:39] there's there's a rapture that's taking
[2:04:42] place
[2:04:44] right now this morning
[2:04:47] right i'm being changed you're being
[2:04:51] changed
[2:04:53] service after service you being changed

[2:05:59] griping stop complaining
[2:06:02] what does this really mean though
[2:06:07] right brother brother said the thing
[2:06:09] will get worse and worse
[2:06:12] this is the best that it's going to be
[2:06:14] this side of the rapture
[2:06:16] we could say that every week
[2:06:19] amen huh this is the best that it's
[2:06:23] going to be
[2:06:25] right it's it's going to take what it's
[2:06:28] going to
[2:06:28] take to push us out of here
[2:06:32] cause we talk like we're ready to go but
[2:06:34] we really ain't ready to go
[2:06:39] amen maybe the next epidemic could do
[2:06:42] the trick

[2:06:46] oh don't say that brother smiley we
[2:06:48] don't know what these folk gonna do
[2:06:52] but every time something happens we
[2:06:55] gotta look at it from
[2:06:57] the standpoint of the world
[2:07:00] right if this is happening it's
[2:07:03] only a signpost
[2:07:07] this thing is almost over
[2:07:11] we we can see we we at the end
[2:07:14] and if we had to end what's next
[2:07:18] right glory to god man i don't just want
[2:07:21] to talk about a rapture
[2:07:22] like we've talked about for 30 something
[2:07:24] years i've been a christian since 1988
[2:07:26] and i thought that man you know what
[2:07:29] when i first got saved that uh
[2:07:31] we'd been gone i never thought about
[2:07:34] getting married
[2:07:36] i never thought about having children i
[2:07:38] haven't been married 20-something years
[2:07:41] my kids are grown huh
[2:07:45] i got i got one i have two teenagers but
[2:07:49] nathan 19 and kevin's 17.
[2:07:52] i mean they were babies
[2:07:55] huh when i saw that pastor and william
[2:07:58] was a baby
[2:07:59] christina wasn't even born
[2:08:03] i remember justin with a sippy cup on
[2:08:05] the front row
[2:08:09] that boy never sat in the back of a
[2:08:11] church
[2:08:14] and had to dress up in a suit and ties
[2:08:17] with master didn't match
[2:08:21] huh they grown
[2:08:25] nobody could i thought we'd have been
[2:08:27] gone
[2:08:30] huh it's the truth
[2:08:33] i've seen some of y'all kids when they
[2:08:35] were little babies
[2:08:39] now they grown with babies
[2:08:43] right so everything everything that i
[2:08:47] see
[2:08:47] now you know i i i try not to let it
[2:08:51] affect me and get nervous about it
[2:08:53] it's like you know what this has been
[2:08:56] prophesied to come
[2:08:59] and it's here and that's listen
[2:09:02] that's the only reason it's here because
[2:09:04] it's been spoken about
[2:09:06] by inspiration brother branham talked
[2:09:08] about these types of warfares and all of
[2:09:10] that
[2:09:11] in the 60s right
[2:09:15] when people thought he was crazy that's
[2:09:18] right
[2:09:18] huh the prophecy came to him about the
[2:09:22] woman and the purple and
[2:09:23] the pearls and all of that right
[2:09:28] we're here we ain't coming we're here
[2:09:31] we can mark that off that is taking
[2:09:33] place
[2:09:36] that means we're just that much closer

[2:19:43] [Music]
[2:19:48] the lord uh thank god for
[2:19:52] brother smiley had known today
[2:19:55] and um
[2:19:58] i think um there was a lot
[2:20:03] said and a lot done here before us and
[2:20:07] um i i learned a long time ago that if
[2:20:11] uh
[2:20:12] you're gonna be a good leader you have
[2:20:13] to be a good follower
[2:20:15] and um and you know brother smiley
[2:20:17] reached out to me
[2:20:19] you know when we're talking about
[2:20:20] jackson about the
[2:20:22] the you know upcoming service and he
[2:20:24] says uh
[2:20:25] just wanting to know where i was where i
[2:20:27] was you know on some some things and we
[2:20:29] say uh
[2:20:30] um i didn't know which way he was gonna
[2:20:32] go but
[2:20:33] this thing was that he just wanted to
[2:20:34] kind of get into the same channel
[2:20:37] and uh that says a lot it says an
[2:20:40] awful lot you know and um i believe that
[2:20:43] god has
[2:20:44] united us all for this season for this
[2:20:46] time for a very specific purpose
[2:20:48] and um and i don't think we even
[2:20:50] understand the magnitude of what god is
[2:20:53] getting ready to do i don't think we
[2:20:55] really understand it
[2:20:56] uh but today you know just for my for
[2:20:59] myself
[2:21:00] even just sitting back and listening to
[2:21:02] the sermon
[2:21:03] hearing it you know kind of come from a
[2:21:05] different angle
[2:21:06] um i'm leaving here with a um
[2:21:12] just a self-examination you know what
[2:21:15] does
[2:21:15] what does these signposts the days of
[2:21:17] noah the days of
[2:21:19] lot and and the scripture you know jesus
[2:21:21] prophesied
[2:21:22] and the thing about is that uh both
[2:21:24] things that happened in scripture what
[2:21:26] happened in days of noah
[2:21:28] was going to happen today what happened
[2:21:29] in the days of lot was going to happen
[2:21:30] today both things would come
[2:21:32] at together at the same time so uh when
[2:21:35] we see these things the question is what
[2:21:37] does that mean to you
[2:21:39] what does it mean to you it's one thing
[2:21:42] to just have head knowledge and say
[2:21:43] lord i see it and that's the prophet
[2:21:45] said this the prophet said that
[2:21:47] the bible say this bible said it it's
[2:21:49] good to have head knowledge but if it's
[2:21:50] not
[2:21:51] changing us from the inside then we're
[2:21:53] missing
[2:21:54] what is really happening uh if if we
[2:21:57] don't draw closer to the lord jesus
[2:21:59] during this time
[2:22:01] when are we gonna draw closer to him
[2:22:04] church i'll tell you
[2:22:05] um i think it ties into our lesson in
[2:22:09] ephesians 3 paul the prison of christ
[2:22:12] and i'm telling you i want to be a
[2:22:14] prisoner to the lord jesus christ i want
[2:22:15] to be
[2:22:16] prisoner to his will prisoner to his way
[2:22:19] prisoner to whatever he desires for me
[2:22:21] to do i want to be a prisoner to that
[2:22:23] so i thank god for the word today and
[2:22:25] i'm i'm leaving here meditating on that
[2:22:28] lord what does this mean to me what do
[2:22:30] you want to do in me
[2:22:32] uh in this season i want to draw closer
[2:22:34] to you
[2:22:35] amen amen
[2:22:39] praise the lord i i i think that's a
[2:22:43] real good
[2:22:43] song but i just uh i don't know it so
[2:22:46] i'm gonna let you sing it okay
[2:22:49] all right let me get you a different mic
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:23:02] here
[2:23:04] of course
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:20] i'm turning away from the things that i
[2:23:24] do
[2:23:24] that i know aren't pleasing in your
[2:23:28] sight
[2:23:28] i'm turning away from the messed up
[2:23:32] mindset and the things that i know
[2:23:35] aren't right i'm turning away from the

[2:27:15] don't let it just be another good song
[2:27:16] that sung but let it become part of your
[2:27:19] life the bible tells us
[2:27:21] in john 5 and 24 just verily verily i
[2:27:25] say unto you he that heareth my word and
[2:27:27] believeth on him that
[2:27:29] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[2:27:32] not come into condemnation but
[2:27:35] is passed from death unto life
[2:27:39] though sometimes we
[2:27:43] might not come to the altar here in the
[2:27:46] front of the church but there's an altar
[2:27:48] in your heart that's the most important
[2:27:49] altar that you can come to
[2:27:52] that's where you surrender you all to
[2:27:55] the lord jesus
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:57] and i want to encourage you today as
[2:27:59] brother smiley told us he said he said
[2:28:00] today somebody might hear the gospel for
[2:28:02] the last time
[2:28:04] and god would be just to judge you for
[2:28:06] rejecting him because he gave you an
[2:28:08] opportunity to receive him
[2:28:10] today before we leave this place i want
[2:28:12] to
[2:28:14] offer another opportunity for someone to
[2:28:16] just surrender to the lord i'm not going
[2:28:18] to invite you to come to the altar but
[2:28:20] in your heart right where you're sitting
[2:28:25] i want to invite you to surrender to the
[2:28:27] lord jesus

[2:28:49] by chance that
[2:28:50] you had a brother smiley to speak what
[2:28:53] he spoke today
[2:28:54] and all the things that he went through
[2:28:55] this week just to press him to the house
