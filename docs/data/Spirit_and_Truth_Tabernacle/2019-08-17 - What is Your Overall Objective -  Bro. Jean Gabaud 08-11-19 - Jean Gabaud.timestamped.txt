[1:01:33] down here the Lord and father
[1:01:34] we're under expectation that we could
[1:01:37] hear from you this morning I'm reminded
[1:01:40] of what your prophets said that any man
[1:01:41] with any human ability of his own can
[1:01:43] flip back the pages of this Bible but it
[1:01:46] takes the Lamb of God to come and break
[1:01:48] bread with us father the Lord you know
[1:01:51] the needs of your people this morning
[1:01:53] you know the burdens you know the trials
[1:01:57] the sufferings of God as a mortal man
[1:02:00] will always come short of providing what
[1:02:02] they have need of the Lord but you to
[1:02:06] God you're an awesome God worthy of all
[1:02:07] praise and worship father there's no no
[1:02:11] situation too big no no circumstances
[1:02:14] too grand that you can't take care of
[1:02:17] father the Lord I I commit this people
[1:02:20] into your hands may you bless everyone
[1:02:22] that's here this morning the Lord and
[1:02:24] those that couldn't be here those that
[1:02:26] are out for various reasons
[1:02:28] and father may the Lamb of God just feel
[1:02:30] welcome in this place and come and just
[1:02:32] speak to our hungry hearts if there's
[1:02:35] any debt sick among us let them receive
[1:02:37] their healing if there's any that Satan
[1:02:39] has buying the lord I pray that you just
[1:02:41] break the chain this morning
[1:02:44] mase may you come in a mighty way to
[1:02:46] Lord may you exceed our expectation and
[1:02:49] father will be careful to give you the
[1:02:51] praise and glory that you alone are
[1:02:53] worthy of father if there's breath in
[1:02:56] this body the Lord there's reason why we
[1:02:57] should just glorify your name to know
[1:03:01] that we have waken to another day the
[1:03:03] Lord adjust by your grace alone
[1:03:05] and for this the Lord we could say the
[1:03:08] God with such faith thank you Jesus

[1:03:14] your blessings thank you for our health
[1:03:16] just thank you for providing for us dear
[1:03:19] Lord we commit the remainder of the
[1:03:22] service into your hands and the bride
[1:03:24] says Amen amen god bless you saying she
[1:03:28] may be seated just for a moment I think
[1:03:30] that'd be all the singing ain't been
[1:03:32] certainly good in the good to be in the
[1:03:34] house of the Lord
[1:03:35] appreciate I always appreciate the
[1:03:37] opportunity to come down this way and
[1:03:40] minister and I for some reason I thought
[1:03:42] brother Jack was gonna be here I just
[1:03:44] didn't know he would be out of the
[1:03:45] country and but we always always feel at
[1:03:49] home whenever we come by here and man
[1:03:52] I'm trying to recollect the last time we
[1:03:54] were here but just kind of get you up to
[1:03:58] speed just you know the it's just
[1:04:03] interesting because when you look at you
[1:04:04] know just the last several months and I
[1:04:09] could all honestly say the last several
[1:04:11] years it's been a it's it's been a
[1:04:14] challenge in a road filled with just
[1:04:18] trials and you know and that's just a
[1:04:21] the way of the devil or he wants to kind
[1:04:24] of discourage you and and make things
[1:04:30] very difficult for you but we know in
[1:04:33] the God that we serve we know in whom we
[1:04:36] have hope and we know in whom we believe
[1:04:41] so and I kind of preface this and just
[1:04:45] kind of setting the foundation here you
[1:04:47] know I think it might have been five
[1:04:49] years ago or so you know lost my father
[1:04:53] then lost my mother-in-law
[1:04:55] they lost my mother you know within a
[1:04:58] short timeframe and unfortunately here
[1:05:02] recently within the last couple of
[1:05:03] months you know my wife lost her father
[1:05:05] and so it's been a it's been a tough
[1:05:08] journey you know but even through that
[1:05:11] you know we don't lose confidence in God
[1:05:15] you know I'm reminded of the Hebrew boys
[1:05:17] that once said to the king
[1:05:19] look you could throw us in the fiery
[1:05:21] furnace and I'm trusting God that he's
[1:05:23] gonna deliver me out of the fiery
[1:05:25] furnace and then boys look at the king
[1:05:27] says but let me tell you something even
[1:05:29] if God doesn't deliver me out of the
[1:05:31] fiery furnace we still won't buy down to
[1:05:34] your God
[1:05:37] you know you pray for healing you pray
[1:05:39] for lot of things and you know if it
[1:05:42] doesn't happen today you know it doesn't
[1:05:44] take my faith away if it doesn't happen
[1:05:47] tomorrow doesn't take my faith away I'm
[1:05:49] still not gonna worship the devil
[1:05:52] because my god is greater you know it's
[1:05:57] it's it's tough to see someone you know
[1:06:01] those that you love just kind of kind of
[1:06:03] go go on to be with the Lord and you
[1:06:05] just know that they're in a better place
[1:06:07] the last you know he passed up here in
[1:06:10] June I believe and I've been really
[1:06:13] struggling there and in my wife done her
[1:06:15] due diligence is to just be there and a
[1:06:18] support and it's just been really a
[1:06:20] trial in burden just you know the the
[1:06:23] sacrifice you know with missing work and
[1:06:25] you know you know and in the hospital
[1:06:28] out of the hospital and things were just
[1:06:30] getting really worse and we're just
[1:06:32] really trusting God and in the Lord saw
[1:06:35] it so I fit to just take him home and
[1:06:37] and and you know we just commit all
[1:06:40] things into the hands of the Lord and
[1:06:41] and we just you know been seeking God to
[1:06:44] be comforted but God works in very very
[1:06:47] you know mysterious ways you know our
[1:06:49] ways is not God ways and God ways is not
[1:06:53] always our way you know but when God
[1:06:57] does something he does it right and my
[1:07:03] wife and I we've been through a journey
[1:07:04] for I'm gonna
[1:07:06] I'm being bowled out here to divide and
[1:07:08] say the number of years only for her to
[1:07:09] correct me won't get in the car 18 years
[1:07:13] so we've been in the journey for 18
[1:07:16] years and it's been our desire you know
[1:07:20] that you know we could bring life to
[1:07:21] this world and as we're kind of dealing
[1:07:25] with all of all of the challenges
[1:07:27] personally with losing a mother and
[1:07:29] losing a father and just you know just
[1:07:32] putting it in the hands of God and just
[1:07:34] trusting him the Lord saw fit to bless
[1:07:37] us this year
[1:07:49] you know I was talking to my boss and
[1:07:52] you know just kind of let him know I'm
[1:07:53] gonna be missing some time and you know
[1:07:56] and he knows that you know I've lost a
[1:08:00] mom and dad and a mother-in-law and he's
[1:08:03] like it must be something for you to
[1:08:05] actually tell your father-in-law that
[1:08:07] your wife is expecting I'm like yeah
[1:08:09] it's it feels really good to tell a
[1:08:12] father you know my wife is expecting
[1:08:15] them for my wife to tell her dad the
[1:08:18] same and but as if God didn't have a
[1:08:21] sense of humor you know he he want to
[1:08:24] make sure that he catches up on the
[1:08:25] years that we may have missed out on so
[1:08:28] you saw it fit to give us twins amen and
[1:08:47] not only that but he wants to make sure
[1:08:48] that we have you know the best of both
[1:08:51] worlds so we having a boy and a girl so
[1:08:58] just continue to keep us in prayer you
[1:09:00] know you could only imagine the level of
[1:09:02] just anxiety the level of nervousness
[1:09:05] anxious and every range of emotions you
[1:09:10] know my weekends look different they're
[1:09:13] not even born yet my weekends look
[1:09:14] different my whole world is revolving
[1:09:16] around them and I know I'm driving my

[1:09:56] keep us in prayer between now and you
[1:09:58] know as long as the Lord give us give
[1:10:01] them to us so we just you know just

[1:10:08] now so we're the dill the the due date
[1:10:11] is December first eight or nine times I
[1:10:14] think it but because we're expecting
[1:10:16] twins they're anticipating that the
[1:10:18] delivery is gonna be some while
[1:10:19] surrounding in early November is what
[1:10:22] we're expecting so we're just praying
[1:10:24] for two healthy babies and we're just
[1:10:26] besides ourselves so so so we appreciate
[1:10:30] your prayers we just appreciate your
[1:10:32] support
[1:10:33] we just appreciate your love that you've
[1:10:34] always shown to us over the years and
[1:10:36] we're just exciting amen if you wouldn't
[1:10:39] mind just stand with me we'll read a few
[1:10:41] scriptures and then don't anticipate on
[1:10:43] keeping you too long but always
[1:10:44] appreciate the singing appreciate the
[1:10:46] fellowship and and I say this with all
[1:10:48] honesty I do really feel at home I never
[1:10:50] feel like out of place awkward I just
[1:10:52] feel like I'm at home when when I come
[1:10:54] down here and then just to trust that
[1:10:56] brother you know jacobi stolen an
[1:10:59] individual relevance is the closest
[1:11:00] thing to heaven here on earth is the
[1:11:02] pulpit and there's just such a respect
[1:11:03] that comes when you stand behind the
[1:11:05] sacred desk so just respect that and you
[1:11:08] didn't come here to see brother gene but
[1:11:09] you came to hear from God and that's I
[1:11:11] just prayed that I could yield myself
[1:11:12] out the way so the Lord could just bless
[1:11:14] you this morning and bless me this
[1:11:16] morning so turn with me to Romans
[1:11:17] chapter 8 we'll just have a few
[1:11:20] scriptures to read as an opening
[1:11:21] scripture and I'll let you have your
[1:11:22] seats
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:36] romans chapter 8 starting at verse 18
[1:11:40] say Amen if you there oh you man
[1:11:43] alright so reads Romans 8 verse 18 for I
[1:11:48] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:11:50] present time are not worthy to be
[1:11:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:11:54] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:11:56] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:11:59] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[1:12:01] the creature was made subject to vanity
[1:12:04] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:12:07] had subjected the same in Hope because
[1:12:10] the creature itself also shall be
[1:12:12] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:12:14] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:12:16] children of God for we know that the
[1:12:19] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:12:20] in pain together until now not only they
[1:12:24] but ourselves also which have the
[1:12:26] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:12:27] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:12:30] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:12:32] of our body for we actually let's just
[1:12:36] jump to verse 35 same chapter verse 35
[1:12:41] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:12:44] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:12:48] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:12:53] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:12:58] sake we are all we are killed all the
[1:13:00] day long we are accounted as sheep for
[1:13:03] the slaughter nay in all these things we
[1:13:08] are more than conquerors through him
[1:13:10] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[1:13:13] neither death nor life nor Angels nor
[1:13:17] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:13:20] present nor things to come nor height
[1:13:23] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:13:26] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:13:29] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:13:31] may the Lord that is blessing to the
[1:13:34] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:13:35] you know for a moment or two I'd like to
[1:13:38] really ponder on a thought on what is
[1:13:40] your overall objective
[1:13:43] and it's just really important for us as
[1:13:48] saints of God to have a an understanding
[1:13:51] of what is what is your purpose what is
[1:13:55] your expectation what is your overall
[1:13:59] objective why did you come to church
[1:14:01] this morning
[1:14:02] why did you you know what do you praise
[1:14:05] God what do you worship Him and verse
[1:14:11] there's a reason why we've laid aside
[1:14:13] the things that we've laid and have
[1:14:15] committed ourselves to God and as I kind
[1:14:19] of build on this foundation the Bible if
[1:14:21] I could read that scripture again for I
[1:14:23] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:14:25] present time are not worthy to be
[1:14:30] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:14:31] revealed in us you know we have battle
[1:14:35] scars and you know those scars are a
[1:14:39] reminder that whatever tried to take
[1:14:43] your life was not successful because
[1:14:47] greater is He that is in you than he
[1:14:49] that is in the world so I reckon that
[1:14:54] the present sufferings that you receive
[1:14:56] here every every false accusation every
[1:15:00] you know every harsh saying that someone
[1:15:05] may say towards you that the challenges
[1:15:09] in the of the course of life with family
[1:15:12] and job in school you know the Bible
[1:15:16] says that I reckon that the sufferings
[1:15:17] of this present time and know that Paul
[1:15:20] wrote it within his time but we also
[1:15:22] apply to our day that the sufferings of
[1:15:25] this present time is not worthy to be
[1:15:27] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:15:31] revealed in you and I there's there's a
[1:15:33] there's a greater purpose tour to to or
[1:15:37] to the sufferings that you receive on
[1:15:40] this side of glory you said brother Jean
[1:15:43] it is really difficult for me but you
[1:15:46] can't even begin to compare the
[1:15:48] culty of what you're going through with
[1:15:50] what God has in store for you there is
[1:15:54] something that's in store let me tell
[1:15:56] you I've given up a lot you've given up
[1:15:58] a lot it's only because we believe that
[1:16:00] the promises that stated in the
[1:16:03] scripture far outweighs the tribulations
[1:16:07] far away's the persecution far outweighs
[1:16:11] the the trials that you receive on this
[1:16:15] side of glory there's a readers an
[1:16:17] overall objective to why you have
[1:16:20] committed yourself to God and I'll drop
[1:16:25] this in because I'm hoping to tie it in
[1:16:26] the Bible says according to proverbs 29
[1:16:28] where there is no vision the people
[1:16:31] perish so you have to have a vision of
[1:16:36] where you're going you know we're not
[1:16:40] like seven billion people planet Earth
[1:16:43] they have no idea where we came from I
[1:16:45] know exactly where I came from and I
[1:16:47] know exactly where I'm going and the
[1:16:52] Bible goes on to say for the earnest
[1:16:54] expectation in a sense of the creature
[1:16:56] which really it's the creation it's
[1:16:58] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:17:01] sons of God so all creation is waiting
[1:17:06] for the sons of God to come into full
[1:17:09] glory creation is waiting for you to
[1:17:15] come into your full potential some of
[1:17:21] you are sitting here this morning and
[1:17:23] are not really demonstrating your full
[1:17:25] potential to God and God is waiting for
[1:17:30] you
[1:17:31] now this exemplifies the patience of God
[1:17:34] some of you are already at your point of
[1:17:36] maturity but just because that one
[1:17:39] person is struggling doesn't mean
[1:17:40] they're not part of the kingdom of God
[1:17:43] just as much as God waited for you he's
[1:17:46] waiting for your brother
[1:17:47] next to you because the Bible says
[1:17:49] everyone that the father has given unto
[1:17:52] me will make it so the whole creation
[1:17:58] the earnest expectation the creation has
[1:18:02] an expectation of you and I to come to a
[1:18:06] full potential that's the reason why I
[1:18:10] strongly believe anything that's worth
[1:18:12] doing do it your best if you're gonna go
[1:18:17] to work give your job your best don't be
[1:18:23] lazy don't be a procrastinator give your
[1:18:27] job a hundred and ten percent of your
[1:18:29] best if you're gonna be a bomb then be
[1:18:33] the best bomb you can be but if you
[1:18:37] gonna do something give it your best if
[1:18:41] you're gonna come to church and worship
[1:18:43] God don't bring your problems and let
[1:18:46] that bring it down he lay those problem
[1:18:49] aside you say God you take care of that
[1:18:52] but as for me in my house I'm gonna give
[1:18:55] my God my gas and she could say to God
[1:19:01] and say to God with your best if he
[1:19:04] could pray and pray your best if he
[1:19:07] could give a testimony to testify your
[1:19:10] best every one of you are called for a
[1:19:13] purpose in the kingdom of God if nature
[1:19:18] can call upon God then you and I love
[1:19:21] voices you and I who can express
[1:19:24] ourselves can call upon God for the
[1:19:30] earnest expectation of the creature is
[1:19:35] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:19:39] sons of God for the creation was made
[1:19:43] subject to vanity not willingly so
[1:19:47] creation had fallen not by anything
[1:19:52] they've done and so the Bible says but
[1:19:56] by reason of him who has subject
[1:19:59] the same in hope so God was
[1:20:04] orchestrating the great plan of
[1:20:09] redemption so when the creature had
[1:20:13] fallen because it was not the it was not
[1:20:15] creations fault that they were part of
[1:20:18] the fall they were just the Bible says
[1:20:21] they were made subject but not willingly
[1:20:25] so as a result of woman's decision
[1:20:28] subsequent to that every creation and
[1:20:31] every child has been born has fallen
[1:20:34] into sin and Christ had to come on the
[1:20:37] scene and reverse that
[1:20:39] but creation was made subject to that
[1:20:43] and the Bible says is because there's a
[1:20:46] greater purpose that God had intended
[1:20:48] for creation now because the creation
[1:20:53] itself because creation itself what are
[1:20:57] you talking about animal life whether
[1:21:00] it's on my plant life vegetation life
[1:21:04] marine life because the creation itself
[1:21:09] shall also be delivered from the bondage
[1:21:12] of corruption because God will be
[1:21:17] created the earth that was God's
[1:21:20] creation and so when the earth fell
[1:21:25] subject to the fall it didn't change
[1:21:28] God's love for his creation you you
[1:21:35] might be upset with God but it doesn't
[1:21:37] change God's feeling toward you you
[1:21:41] might wave her off a little bit but it
[1:21:43] doesn't change God's purpose for you you
[1:21:47] might go out there a little bit but as
[1:21:50] long as there's a magnet on the inside
[1:21:52] that magnetized with the greater Pole
[1:21:54] you're gonna find yourself black in the
[1:21:57] presence of you can't run too far for
[1:21:59] God because you're part of God's
[1:22:03] creation and there's a seed on the
[1:22:06] inside that's identical to God
[1:22:11] think about it this earth is a chip off
[1:22:15] the old block inside the earth is a ISM
[1:22:19] is a molten lava a ball of fire
[1:22:22] testifying that it came from the Sun so
[1:22:28] despite the the crust on the end sound
[1:22:31] on the outside the ball of fire on the
[1:22:34] inside is a testament that there are
[1:22:37] this part of the Sun I'm talking about
[1:22:39] you and I my God is a consuming fire if
[1:22:42] you want to look inside this body you
[1:22:46] see that does a fire that burns that's
[1:22:49] the reason why I cannot sit still
[1:22:51] because I'm a fire for God there are to
[1:23:00] be your attitude don't you get close on
[1:23:03] God God is a consuming fire if you find
[1:23:06] that you're not moving something is
[1:23:07] wrong if you're finding that you're too
[1:23:10] comfortable Church something is wrong
[1:23:12] you gotta be on fire you gotta be moving
[1:23:15] you gotta be about this gospel is so
[1:23:20] relevant that someone has to hear about
[1:23:21] it don't only say Amen here you gotta be
[1:23:27] willing to testify out there talk about
[1:23:30] it in the job talk about it in the
[1:23:33] grocery store talk about it in the
[1:23:34] school if he's worth talking about it in
[1:23:36] church then he's worth talking about it
[1:23:38] outside the church I'm not just a Sunday
[1:23:44] only Christian I'm a Monday Christian
[1:23:47] I'm a Tuesday Christian I'm Melinda
[1:23:49] Christian I'm a Thursday come on
[1:23:52] somebody I'm a Friday Christian I'm a
[1:23:54] Saturday Kristen when I come here I'm
[1:23:57] only a vindicated child of God I know
[1:24:05] who my dad is
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] I'm not embarrassed to be called a child
[1:24:14] of God now because the creation itself
[1:24:20] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:24:22] of corruption it's a glorious liberty of
[1:24:25] the children of God for we know that the
[1:24:28] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:24:34] in pain together until now the whole
[1:24:41] creation is agonizing the whole creation
[1:24:45] is anticipating up until now
[1:24:50] first one see that not only they not
[1:24:52] only the creation itself but we
[1:24:55] ourselves also which have the
[1:25:00] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:25:03] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:25:09] for the adoption to it that is the
[1:25:13] redemption of our body so we groan
[1:25:19] within ourselves waiting for the
[1:25:22] adoption the redemption of our body oh
[1:25:28] son my church you know the other day I'm
[1:25:32] just a program I'm just passing through
[1:25:36] I'm not comfortable here and I don't
[1:25:39] want to be comfortable here you may not
[1:25:44] have nice houses but don't be
[1:25:46] comfortable with your houses you may
[1:25:49] have nice cars but don't be comfortable
[1:25:50] with their cars you may have nice jobs
[1:25:53] but don't be comfortable with your job
[1:25:55] you may have nice 401k a nice bank
[1:25:59] account but don't be comfortable with
[1:26:01] those things we're just passing through
[1:26:10] the Bible says then Paul County brings
[1:26:13] it to this point he he kind of
[1:26:15] understands he says the overall
[1:26:17] objective of every suffering the overall
[1:26:20] objective of every pain of every agony
[1:26:24] of every trial he says is it so that way
[1:26:27] we can undergo a change in the body let
[1:26:33] me tell you every night I go to bed I'm
[1:26:37] under expectation that when I wake up
[1:26:39] the next morning I'm gonna wake up to a
[1:26:41] change in the body every night I go to
[1:26:49] bed I wake up thinking there's a change
[1:26:54] in the body
[1:26:57] he's a bridging why do you have that
[1:26:59] kind of a mental thought it's because
[1:27:01] this Bible is more than just a good
[1:27:04] story book this Bible tells me that this
[1:27:09] corruption must put on incorruption this
[1:27:13] Bible says this mortal must put on
[1:27:15] immortality
[1:27:16] someone has to fulfill that Scripture if
[1:27:19] all this is for you is to come and get
[1:27:22] your religious obligation and to feel
[1:27:25] good that you come to church on the
[1:27:26] Sunday you've missed the mark but I
[1:27:32] believe this when I come to church on
[1:27:34] Sunday it's to offer me a reminder that
[1:27:39] this mortal must put on immortality and
[1:27:42] if it doesn't happen tomorrow morning
[1:27:44] I'm expecting it the next day your faith
[1:27:49] has to be so elevated that you believe
[1:27:52] that God and those are only gonna be one
[1:27:55] person that's gonna take a change in the
[1:27:56] body I'm that one person Paul understood
[1:28:04] the gravity of what he was saying that
[1:28:08] all this is leading up to a change in
[1:28:11] the body
[1:28:12] the Bible says Ruth shall separate us
[1:28:14] from the love of Christ shall
[1:28:18] tribulation
[1:28:20] distress persecution famine nakedness
[1:28:26] peril sword bills layoffs insurance
[1:28:37] doctors diagnosis will that separate you
[1:28:47] let me tell you many of us a lot of us
[1:28:50] we've been in this fight too far and if
[1:28:55] Steve's gonna come in my ears right now
[1:28:57] to tell me it doesn't make sense to drop
[1:28:59] it let me tell you you gotta look the
[1:29:01] devil in the eye say devil you're far
[1:29:04] too late I've seen too much I'm the
[1:29:09] witness of what God has done not only of
[1:29:13] what God has done in the life of other
[1:29:15] people I'm a testimony your testimony
[1:29:21] that we're not just worshiping a
[1:29:23] fictitious God we're not worshiping an
[1:29:26] idol let me tell you when I speak to God
[1:29:29] he speaks black I can't even begin to
[1:29:35] tell you there been times where I've
[1:29:36] been sitting where you're sitting at and
[1:29:37] I have questions in my heart as a
[1:29:39] minister and I've gone through the week
[1:29:42] and I just I'm overwhelmed with this and
[1:29:45] I'm overwhelmed with that and I just
[1:29:46] don't know what to expect on a Wednesday
[1:29:48] evening or a Sunday morning or whenever
[1:29:50] you may have services but when I sit in
[1:29:53] that pew and I'm under expectation I
[1:29:55] hear from God let me tell you it's no
[1:29:57] accident that that preacher goes off his
[1:29:59] beaten path and he's no longer sticking
[1:30:01] to the script and he's no longer
[1:30:03] preaching from his notes and he begins
[1:30:05] to go to a different topic that's not
[1:30:07] even related to what he's preaching
[1:30:08] about just so that way you as an
[1:30:11] individual so doctor speak to you you
[1:30:15] someone else might say that's more a man
[1:30:16] talking but I said God to man that
[1:30:19] speaking to me
[1:30:20] I have seen it countless times you my
[1:30:27] sister begin to shop to get to scream
[1:30:30] and you have no idea what she's
[1:30:32] responded to and for her it's God that's
[1:30:35] speaking directly to my ears God is very
[1:30:44] specific you got a problem you say God
[1:30:49] speak to him specifically God I'm having
[1:30:52] such a such problem you know about it
[1:30:54] I'm looking for such a such blessing you
[1:31:00] know we take a step back and we say he
[1:31:03] created the heavens and the earth and
[1:31:05] the vastness of space but yet we
[1:31:07] struggle we struggle and I find out
[1:31:12] minds to accept that your situation how
[1:31:17] can God take care of that situation
[1:31:21] ready you don't understand the bills are
[1:31:23] due Monday God knows there you know
[1:31:28] Stambler gee I might not have a job by
[1:31:29] the end of the week God knows that
[1:31:34] that's why I try not to give the devil
[1:31:36] any credit that I could possibly give
[1:31:38] him you might say what the reason why I
[1:31:42] got my last job is because I was a good
[1:31:44] end of your God put the words in your
[1:31:46] lips amen
[1:31:52] you might say bless him the reason why I
[1:31:54] got a raise because I'm a good performer
[1:31:56] God moved upon the grace of your boss's
[1:31:59] heart I'm not taking anything away from
[1:32:04] you I'm sure you're going and you do due
[1:32:06] diligence but your ability to do that is
[1:32:08] because of God's grace these are a dream
[1:32:14] the reason why I got this house is
[1:32:16] because I worked hard and I got money
[1:32:18] it's because God open the door of
[1:32:20] opportunity please go get the devil
[1:32:22] credit for anything

[1:32:47] we're different caliber of people I
[1:32:50] don't speak the same language that
[1:32:52] people out there in the world speak cuz
[1:32:56] I'm not of this world I may be in it but
[1:32:59] I'm out of this world you know we see
[1:33:04] this in the medical field in and I
[1:33:06] respect what the doctors do and the
[1:33:08] physicians and everything else but they
[1:33:09] speak this language you know and and
[1:33:13] they drop these words on you they've
[1:33:15] gone through years of school and they
[1:33:17] stay diagnosed you with you know with
[1:33:19] this with these words that you don't
[1:33:21] have no idea what they mean and the
[1:33:24] creates of fear they might say well you
[1:33:28] I've diagnosed you with cardio this that
[1:33:31] and the other and all these big words
[1:33:33] and you're looking at the doctor and
[1:33:35] your heart is racing you like what
[1:33:36] doctor will just give it to me straight
[1:33:38] how many days we talked about two days
[1:33:40] three days and the doctor then has said
[1:33:44] no no no no you just have the common
[1:33:45] cold is that what what did you just say
[1:33:50] that but the devil wants you to be
[1:33:54] fearful you tell you don't be fearful
[1:34:00] about what the doctors say your God it's
[1:34:04] the viruses the Bible says that
[1:34:06] he's a great physician that can be
[1:34:10] touched by the feelings of your
[1:34:11] infirmities when you can't understand
[1:34:14] what the doctors say you Tom let me tell
[1:34:16] you something doctor I'm gonna take it
[1:34:17] to another physician that could
[1:34:19] translate when you just said to me
[1:34:22] I got a feeling that his diagnosis is
[1:34:25] not gonna match up with what you just
[1:34:27] told me you do not have to accept what
[1:34:31] the devil puts in front of you you know
[1:34:35] you have a right to tell the devil no
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:39] hey man if you could recognize who you
[1:34:44] are that there's authority and power in
[1:34:46] your words because your words represent
[1:34:49] gods words I challenge you this morning
[1:34:54] to say I am healed and see how many
[1:34:58] devils will be obedient to that
[1:35:00] testimony I am financially blessed my

[1:35:14] tell you for you but I'm making a
[1:35:16] declaration this morning I'm a child of
[1:35:19] God this word is not only for the
[1:35:24] ministers but this word is for you it
[1:35:27] was not only for the Prophet but this
[1:35:29] word is for you my marriage is home my
[1:35:36] children are saved you gotta be able to
[1:35:46] speak it and believe it and know that
[1:35:48] your witness God has given you those
[1:35:51] things
[1:35:52] hey man it's like I read this quote the
[1:36:03] other day you know it's just kind of
[1:36:06] call me this is why would you wish upon
[1:36:08] a star and I know Lufton time people do
[1:36:10] this but why would you wish upon a star
[1:36:12] when you could pray to the one who
[1:36:14] created it the Bible says as it is
[1:36:21] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:36:24] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[1:36:27] for the slaughter nay and all these
[1:36:31] things and all these things
[1:36:34] Paul knew what persecution was he knew
[1:36:38] what trials was he knew what tribulation
[1:36:42] was he knew what distress was then he
[1:36:49] says but in all these things he says we
[1:36:53] are more than conquerors through him
[1:36:57] that loved us you are more than
[1:37:02] conquerors you are more than a member
[1:37:07] who has come to warm up to be you you
[1:37:15] are more than an employee at your job
[1:37:18] you are more than a student in school
[1:37:21] you are more than just an individual at
[1:37:24] Walmart you're more than conquerors the
[1:37:31] world walks around fierce unembarrassed
[1:37:37] unmoved by who they serve they make a
[1:37:44] declaration they play take a position
[1:37:48] and they say well you know I have a
[1:37:51] right to do what I want to do I have a
[1:37:54] right to serve who I want to serve let
[1:37:59] me tell you and I'm gonna say this as
[1:38:01] respectfully as I can but if the
[1:38:03] children of the devil can be so bold
[1:38:07] then you and I who have the promises of
[1:38:09] God why are we walking down with thy
[1:38:12] hands hung down low why are we walking
[1:38:15] down while we're soaked down and lack
[1:38:18] motivation why are we walking down like
[1:38:21] we've been defeated let me tell you I
[1:38:23] look to you I look to Israel and the
[1:38:26] Bible tells me there's an empty tomb
[1:38:30] and Jesus rose above the ground then I
[1:38:34] too can walk up with my head hung high
[1:38:36] and know that I that I am more than a
[1:38:42] conquerer I'm more than just somebody
[1:38:48] there's a reason there's a purpose for
[1:38:53] why you're here this morning and Paul
[1:38:57] says for I am persuaded that neither
[1:38:59] death nor life nor Angels no
[1:39:03] principalities he's hitting up on some
[1:39:08] major life-changing events death nor
[1:39:11] life angels no principalities powers nor
[1:39:15] things present nor things to come
[1:39:18] Paul says look I've know I've had some
[1:39:20] fights that I've but God's grace I've
[1:39:22] I've overcome but I know there's still
[1:39:24] some fights ahead of me but I'm
[1:39:27] persuaded how many of you are persuaded
[1:39:31] I'm persuaded that nor height nor depth
[1:39:36] you can't get too high and you can't
[1:39:40] fall too deep it's like I was under
[1:39:44] Church when when when God when Jesus was
[1:39:46] walking the water he told Peter Peter
[1:39:48] come on that house and Peter went out
[1:39:51] with as much faith as he can and he was
[1:39:54] walking and as he was walking he started
[1:39:57] looking around his surroundings and is
[1:40:00] in the human mind always tried to try to
[1:40:03] reason things out like how is that even
[1:40:05] possible yeah that's just men's natural
[1:40:10] reaction how is that even possible
[1:40:12] just let it be because God made it
[1:40:13] possible and so Peter begins to walk and
[1:40:18] next thing you know he starts seeing the
[1:40:20] waves and no doubt that he started to
[1:40:23] kind of fall into some deep water and
[1:40:26] Jesus being there will not tell you to
[1:40:30] come out and not encourage you to come
[1:40:33] out without having a way to making sure
[1:40:36] that you reach your destination
[1:40:40] even when you begin to slip and fall
[1:40:43] he's still right there repeaters started
[1:40:47] to panic he started to splash water
[1:40:50] around he started to fill him you know
[1:40:53] started to swing his arms around he
[1:40:55] started to go over some water Jesus did
[1:40:57] not panic
[1:40:58] I want a god who's in control of
[1:41:02] everything
[1:41:03] you might panic you might see panic in
[1:41:07] my face but I like to look to a God who
[1:41:09] doesn't panic on a situation you know
[1:41:15] even as Peter was just just falling into
[1:41:17] deep water I don't see Jesus running to
[1:41:20] his assistance because c22 assumed that
[1:41:26] Jesus was running to assistance it's
[1:41:28] assumed that God was not in control and
[1:41:31] Peter might have been a little ways with
[1:41:33] Jesus took his little turn and he's wire
[1:41:40] just swinging drinking water he's
[1:41:43] worried about the animals the sea life
[1:41:45] underneath him he's wondering how he's
[1:41:47] gonna come out of that situation it's
[1:41:49] dark it's it's it's raining it's cloudy
[1:41:52] he has no sense of direction
[1:41:55] is that your situation sometimes you
[1:41:59] have no sense of direction you don't
[1:42:01] know where you're going things just seem
[1:42:03] so chaotic but God is not too far from
[1:42:06] where you're at cuz he said I'll never
[1:42:10] leave you nor y'all know the scripture
[1:42:15] now I'll never leave you
[1:42:17] you gotta let the devil know that that's
[1:42:21] what he said about you I'll never leave
[1:42:24] you nor forsake you and Jesus wasn't
[1:42:28] panicking he just took his son saw Peter
[1:42:33] Peter Jesus walk there and the Bible
[1:42:39] says listen to this the Bible didn't say
[1:42:41] that Jesus use two hands to pull Peter
[1:42:43] out like it was effort the Bible says he
[1:42:47] extended his hands he just imagined the
[1:42:50] grace
[1:42:51] of God just gracefully give me your hand
[1:42:56] it's not like I saw this one no YouTube
[1:42:59] thing this little book this little baby
[1:43:01] boy just like filleting in water he's
[1:43:04] just like he's he's panting everybody
[1:43:07] panicky
[1:43:07] it's like mom's like stand up little boy
[1:43:10] stood up the water is right here he was
[1:43:13] confused what it was right here
[1:43:17] you said you laugh about there that's
[1:43:19] why God laughs at your situation isn't
[1:43:24] control of your situation if you as
[1:43:29] human beings can see how cute that looks
[1:43:32] that's how God looks at your situation
[1:43:34] we gotta give him credit if he's brought
[1:43:37] it this far
[1:43:38] the Bible says he that has begun a good
[1:43:40] work in you will finish it God does not
[1:43:45] start a work that he does not intend on
[1:43:47] finishing you must have brother Jean you
[1:43:51] know I'm still on that journey God
[1:43:53] started to work in you he will finish it
[1:43:58] nothing can separate me from the love of
[1:44:02] God I'm a witness of too much I've seen
[1:44:07] the benefits I've seen the blessings the
[1:44:15] overall objective lamia
[1:44:18] kind of give us a historical background
[1:44:20] of this piece that that took place in
[1:44:23] history on May 25th 1961 Naima read this
[1:44:29] little article and it was from NASA
[1:44:32] President John F Kennedy announced
[1:44:34] before a special joint session of
[1:44:36] Congress the dramatic and ambitious goal
[1:44:38] of sending an American safely to the
[1:44:40] moon before the end of the decade a
[1:44:44] number of political factors affected
[1:44:47] Kennedy's decision and the timing of it
[1:44:49] in general Kennedy felt great pressure
[1:44:52] to have the u.s. catch up to and
[1:44:54] overtake the Soviet Union in the space
[1:44:57] race for four years after the Sputnik
[1:45:00] shock of 1957 the cosmonaut your
[1:45:04] have become the first human in space on
[1:45:06] April 12 1961 greatly embarrassing the
[1:45:11] US while Alan Shepard became the first
[1:45:13] American in space on May 5th
[1:45:15] he only flew a short suborbital
[1:45:18] suborbital flight instead of orbiting
[1:45:21] the Earth in addition there are other
[1:45:25] factors that was at play the Bay of Pigs
[1:45:26] and Fiasco mid April put on quantifiable
[1:45:30] pressure on Kennedy he wanted to
[1:45:32] announce a program that the US had a
[1:45:35] strong chance to achieve before the so
[1:45:38] before the Soviet Union so he consulted
[1:45:41] Vice President Johnson back then NASA
[1:45:43] administrators James Webb and other
[1:45:46] officials he concluded that landing an
[1:45:48] American on the moon would be a very
[1:45:50] challenging technical technological feat
[1:45:52] but an area of space exploration in
[1:45:55] which the u.s. actually had a potential
[1:45:58] lead thus the Cold War is the primary
[1:46:02] contextual lens through which many
[1:46:04] historians now view Kennedy's speech so
[1:46:07] the decision involved much consideration
[1:46:10] before making it public as well as
[1:46:12] enormous human efforts and expenditures
[1:46:16] to make what would become project Apollo
[1:46:19] a reality by 69 only the construction of
[1:46:24] the Panama Canal and the Manhattan
[1:46:26] Project was comparable in scope NASA's
[1:46:29] overall human spaceflight of space
[1:46:31] flight effort were guided by Kennedy's
[1:46:33] speech projects Mercury Gemini Apollo
[1:46:36] were designed to execute Kennedy's goal
[1:46:38] his goals was achieved on July 20th 1969
[1:46:45] when Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong
[1:46:48] stepped off the lunar modules ladder and
[1:46:50] onto the moon's surface in which he says
[1:46:53] one small step for man one giant leap
[1:46:55] for mankind
[1:46:56] why is that important he had a leader
[1:46:59] that stood up before a nation and says
[1:47:03] we're gonna put a man on the moon and so
[1:47:06] it took everyone to play a role in this
[1:47:11] hundreds of thousands it took aa the
[1:47:16] engineers
[1:47:17] it took designers it took you know
[1:47:21] suppliers it took a lot of people to
[1:47:25] make this objective become a reality you
[1:47:29] with me so whether you were sitting in
[1:47:34] the executive suite or down in the did
[1:47:37] the janitorial staff everyone was
[1:47:40] playing a role so there was a response
[1:47:44] to this overall objective you with me
[1:47:48] and so people started to realize that
[1:47:52] the cause was far greater than
[1:47:55] themselves and so much there was a
[1:48:00] moment during a visit to them to the
[1:48:03] NASA Space Center in 62
[1:48:05] President Kennedy noticed a janitor
[1:48:07] carrying a broom he interrupted his tour
[1:48:11] walked over to the man and said hi I'm
[1:48:13] Jack Kennedy what are you doing and the
[1:48:16] man responsible said while mr. president
[1:48:18] I'm helping put a man on the moon I'm
[1:48:26] helping put a man on the moon he was
[1:48:31] picking up trash he was cleaning toilets
[1:48:36] but he realized that his role was just
[1:48:39] as important as the men on the top who's
[1:48:43] making the decisions let me tell you
[1:48:46] might be sitting in the back or you
[1:48:48] might be standing up here leading songs
[1:48:50] every one of you have a role in the
[1:48:53] kingdom of God
[1:48:58] your sisters might never preach a gospel
[1:49:00] behind this pulpit but the moment that
[1:49:03] you're out there your life preaches a
[1:49:06] message
[1:49:07] [Applause]
[1:49:09] your purpose is part of God's overall
[1:49:12] objective you preach more sermon out
[1:49:17] there than a brother that stands behind
[1:49:20] the pulpit we may not hear from one
[1:49:27] sister that sits in this church but she
[1:49:30] might be a plane warrior constantly in
[1:49:33] her closet because everybody realized
[1:49:38] the overall objective of what they were
[1:49:42] doing so again I ask you what is your
[1:49:46] overall objective what drove you to
[1:49:51] church besides your car things let me
[1:50:00] tell you we're too late in the game it's
[1:50:04] the eleventh hour I got no time to play
[1:50:07] Church I've given up a lot I've
[1:50:12] sacrificed a lot I've turned I've turned
[1:50:15] the other way I'm saying I'm going God's
[1:50:17] provided way let me tell you I did not
[1:50:19] get on this journey for me to come and
[1:50:21] play church my soul is at stake
[1:50:25] my wife souls that state my children of
[1:50:28] that state I don't want to play games
[1:50:31] with God the moment I said I do I met
[1:50:34] that I am committed to this word no get
[1:50:40] quiet on me now Saints it's about to get
[1:50:42] tough your faith is gonna be tried your
[1:50:46] testimony's gonna be tried and I'm not
[1:50:48] talking about in the church I'm talking
[1:50:49] about there in the world if you could
[1:50:54] all fold your eyes to see what's
[1:50:56] happening in society
[1:51:00] lifestyles are becoming acceptable and
[1:51:04] when you're in your jobs or in your
[1:51:06] school they say we're looking for
[1:51:08] support
[1:51:15] it's easy when you're sitting in church
[1:51:17] to say Amen it's easy when you're and
[1:51:21] the monks brothers and sisters of like
[1:51:23] precious faith to say what you believe
[1:51:26] in what you don't believe but when
[1:51:29] you're on the battlefield by yourself
[1:51:32] and you got a guy who comes to put his
[1:51:35] hands on his hip to side he wants to
[1:51:40] know will you believe and it could be
[1:51:44] that he's your boss the devil will have
[1:51:50] you think about how you get your next
[1:51:52] meal how you gonna pay your next bill do
[1:51:57] we tell you say I'm not talking about
[1:51:59] stuff that I haven't gone see myself
[1:52:01] this is the reality of what you're of
[1:52:04] what we're part of but I know what I
[1:52:07] said yes so I know what I agree to I
[1:52:09] know I said Lord I agree to this that
[1:52:14] whether the Deacon sees me or not
[1:52:16] whether the pastor stands shoulder to
[1:52:18] shoulder with me or not I'm still gonna
[1:52:20] make a declaration that I'm a child of
[1:52:23] God nothing against the person but I
[1:52:28] don't agree with the lifestyle that IG
[1:52:35] will you or this little band and support
[1:52:37] I'm like nope
[1:52:41] y'all getting quiet now
[1:52:44] now I gave crying let me tell you say
[1:52:47] God is making you ready so I went you
[1:52:48] can have something to talk about when
[1:52:50] you get to the other side so let me tell
[1:52:58] you how it's getting Saints we're we're
[1:53:02] living in a time we're living in a day
[1:53:03] where people you know are changing the
[1:53:08] very natural state of being men are no
[1:53:11] longer men and women are no longer women
[1:53:15] there's a guy in my job that just went
[1:53:18] exactly through that transformation
[1:53:22] nothing physically changing I know
[1:53:24] there's people that does stuff like that
[1:53:25] but just in full appearance we're no
[1:53:29] longer to address him as sir but now
[1:53:30] ma'am no longer able to no longer
[1:53:35] allowed to use the men's restroom but
[1:53:36] now has to use the ladies restroom he's
[1:53:39] married he have kids and he's a member
[1:53:44] of leadership I'm a member of leadership
[1:53:49] so then there's an expectation of how
[1:53:52] you ought to deal with certain situation
[1:53:53] but it crosses paths with your faith
[1:53:59] we're in a real fight Saints the devil's
[1:54:04] will try to take bread from your
[1:54:05] children but the devil was never the one
[1:54:08] to give you bread in the first place God
[1:54:10] is the one that's your provider let me
[1:54:15] tell you I've so much faith in God that
[1:54:17] whatever happens to me I know that he'll
[1:54:19] pick me up back again and so now every
[1:54:26] time we see him I have a hard time
[1:54:28] there's like he has a new name now it's
[1:54:31] no longer his masculine name is now a
[1:54:33] feminine name and every time I see him I
[1:54:38] just gone by the masculine name because
[1:54:41] that's what his mom called him that's
[1:54:44] what God sees in him this one is
[1:54:46] soulless
[1:54:47] oh my faith oh yeah I get quiet but this
[1:54:52] is business ain't nothing to what you
[1:54:54] guys watch the face out there
[1:54:56] this is a real battle if they're not
[1:54:59] afraid to make a declaration of who they
[1:55:01] are I'm not ashamed to say I'm a child
[1:55:04] of God and then I don't agree with
[1:55:06] certain things there has to be a beacon
[1:55:12] of light in this day and age there has
[1:55:15] to be one that carries the testimony
[1:55:17] that Jesus Christ is alive risen I will
[1:55:24] walk him in just things that just
[1:55:27] happened to me realize we were on the we
[1:55:31] were on the on vacation and we and I was
[1:55:35] on a cruising and we had like a low
[1:55:37] excursion and it was kind of like this
[1:55:39] little not it's so quaint little town so
[1:55:42] her not walking we're holding hands and
[1:55:44] what happened with and I see two guys
[1:55:45] looking suspicious and looking all
[1:55:47] around them and big burly guys and
[1:55:49] they're looking all around them
[1:55:50] something my stuff okay so did things
[1:55:52] you ready go down so if faith day
[1:55:53] happens to me I gotta make sure my wife
[1:55:55] is okay because I know what they were up
[1:55:57] to and it was just kind of walking out
[1:55:59] this little narrow path not you are not
[1:56:01] even not really anyone else was just
[1:56:03] there in a distance and they were
[1:56:04] walking towards us and I'm walking
[1:56:06] towards him and those like and people
[1:56:08] were like we're in different spots but
[1:56:09] it was just that one corridor was just
[1:56:11] us four and no like in the distance and
[1:56:13] they're looking around and I'm thinking
[1:56:15] myself I'm gonna get one good punch in
[1:56:17] and Risa's got to run as quick as
[1:56:19] possible to get help because I'm not
[1:56:21] gonna be able to I'm not gonna be able
[1:56:22] to hold on to law so all this is go
[1:56:24] through my mind she doesn't know this
[1:56:25] all occurs as a guy you know you gotta
[1:56:27] you got to process a lot of things real
[1:56:29] quick cuz you want to make sure your
[1:56:30] family's protected so she's
[1:56:34] happy-go-lucky everything's fine
[1:56:35] meanwhile I'm recognizing danger in
[1:56:37] front of me so I'm thinking wobble to
[1:56:40] one good punch and she that's up that
[1:56:42] should be enough for her to run and not
[1:56:43] try to figure out if I'm okay or not so
[1:56:47] next thing you know we're walking we're
[1:56:48] getting closer and what what it was was
[1:56:51] that they grabbed hands started
[1:56:54] embracing one another because not it
[1:56:55] felt safe and I was just my monsters
[1:56:59] dropped in this arguing affectionate
[1:57:03] with one another I'm like unto big burly
[1:57:05] guys
[1:57:07] and my mind up take me I probably would
[1:57:09] I wish it was a fight instead then I
[1:57:11] would have tolerated I'm not making this
[1:57:16] up sense I'm telling you I see this and
[1:57:20] they're just holding hands and and and
[1:57:22] and Dow is still trying to do it and
[1:57:23] they will soak up several years ago and
[1:57:25] now Jim just trying to be in secret
[1:57:27] because they did that's how the feel
[1:57:28] towards one another and now whatever was
[1:57:31] in the closet is coming back out and you
[1:57:36] think they gotta be dressed a certain
[1:57:36] way act a certain way with the not so
[1:57:39] long ago we were down south we saw these
[1:57:41] two bodybuilders open public just
[1:57:43] holding hands and just the world is
[1:57:46] falling apart since you brothers be
[1:57:51] careful who you're looking at well I got
[1:57:56] stories I saw this one guy walking I saw
[1:58:00] lies I kind of ruin it there but I may
[1:58:03] had the most beautiful hair look like
[1:58:07] she'd like keep this stepped out of like
[1:58:08] a beauty salon I've never seen so hair
[1:58:12] so glistening and then the guy turn
[1:58:15] around a full set of beard that's
[1:58:19] feminine as you want to be y'all
[1:58:22] laughing at this but this is this is
[1:58:24] demonic this is this is what we're up
[1:58:26] against these young kids this is what
[1:58:30] they're gonna have to face if you don't
[1:58:33] lift up the name of Jesus Christ in your
[1:58:34] homes who's gonna let them know that
[1:58:37] there's a God who opposes that
[1:58:40] they gotta go to school they gotta face
[1:58:43] society but you wanna have a standard in
[1:58:45] your house that could declare sass for
[1:58:47] me in my house we were worship God the
[1:58:57] moment I realized that my wife and I
[1:58:59] would expect I said lord I need your
[1:59:00] wisdom I knew I know the generation I
[1:59:04] grew up with in the challenges that we
[1:59:06] face but when I see the young people
[1:59:07] today or schools to say hey it's okay
[1:59:11] for you to be is this all right what
[1:59:14] schools are saying it's okay for you to
[1:59:16] pick your gender identity it doesn't
[1:59:18] matter
[1:59:18] and my
[1:59:19] according to god it does matter teach
[1:59:26] him about God you know here's the thing
[1:59:28] the Bible says I was selling I was
[1:59:30] selling this sewer to an individual the
[1:59:32] Bible says that there are roles of
[1:59:34] Pharaoh who knew not Joseph there this
[1:59:40] it is not there arose a pharaoh who knew
[1:59:45] not Joseph one little scripture you know
[1:59:49] how it got to that point because the
[1:59:51] children of Israel stopped talking about
[1:59:53] Joseph everything that Joseph did to his
[1:59:59] family brought him into death that the
[2:00:02] place where their comforted and every
[2:00:05] Egyptian had respect for Joseph and when
[2:00:07] the Pharaoh rose up they respected
[2:00:09] Joseph and it was the responsibility of
[2:00:12] the Jews to continue to instill within
[2:00:14] their children Joseph and what he's done
[2:00:17] in generation after generation they talk
[2:00:20] less about Joseph and the Pharaoh rose
[2:00:24] up he knows a little bit about Joseph
[2:00:27] but not a whole lot enough to respect
[2:00:29] and not do anything another generation
[2:00:31] rose up another Pharaoh rose up no
[2:00:34] little bit heard of Joseph read a little
[2:00:37] bit about it another generation laws
[2:00:40] came up until finally after several
[2:00:43] generation their roles of Pharaoh when
[2:00:47] they mentioned the name Joseph his
[2:00:49] response was who's is Joseph don't ever
[2:00:55] stop talking about Jesus Christ
[2:00:59] every waking warning he talked about
[2:01:01] Jesus Christ even in the message people
[2:01:05] talk more about celebrities than to talk
[2:01:07] about Jesus
[2:01:09] y'all can act like I don't know what I'm
[2:01:11] talking about
[2:01:12] some of y'all know more celebrities than
[2:01:14] some of the Apostles that's in the
[2:01:15] scripture we can't fall victims to
[2:01:23] what's happening in the world we're a
[2:01:25] different group of people can we say
[2:01:29] praise the Lord let me say this was not
[2:01:32] part of my notes but y'all just bear
[2:01:33] with me this is what brother min says
[2:01:37] and I'm wrapping it up he says this he
[2:01:39] says that's the mighty sweet thing I'm
[2:01:42] so glad to be in the house of the Lord
[2:01:44] are you this morning
[2:01:45] there is only one better place and
[2:01:47] that's to be what the Lord isn't it all
[2:01:49] the hardships and trials and troubles of
[2:01:52] life shall blend away into a great
[2:01:54] glorious smaller and we certainly
[2:01:56] looking forward for the time that when
[2:01:58] we will see him and someone was asking
[2:02:00] me the other day do you think brother
[2:02:02] Brown that that the coming of the Lord
[2:02:04] is at hand I said I certainly do say
[2:02:07] well I've heard for it for a long time
[2:02:09] but I said one day you're here it for
[2:02:13] the last time see that's right cuz he'll
[2:02:21] arrive someday
[2:02:22] and whenever it is I just want to be
[2:02:26] ready we are speaking the other day
[2:02:30] before some business man that were
[2:02:32] attorneys and so forth and they said
[2:02:35] what's it what is what is your main
[2:02:37] objective in life I said I have one he
[2:02:43] said what is that
[2:02:44] I said saving souls for Christ that's
[2:02:50] the only thing that my highest ambition
[2:02:52] my in my and only ambition is to see
[2:02:56] Jesus Christ glorified I live for that
[2:03:04] that is my sole ambition
[2:03:08] it's to see Jesus Christ glorified let
[2:03:14] me tell many of you sitting out there
[2:03:15] y'all were fanatics when y'all had in
[2:03:17] the world
[2:03:21] you were cuz I was I was proud of what I
[2:03:27] did
[2:03:28] I screamed the loudest I shouted
[2:03:34] whenever there was fun I want to have
[2:03:36] the most fun but we've changed sides our
[2:03:44] eyes are opened up I now see the truth
[2:03:48] for what the truth is
[2:03:51] in the same zeal that I had there is not
[2:03:55] just change to a different zeal I'm
[2:04:00] still motivated brother Caleb ah I'm
[2:04:03] still excited I'm still enthused about
[2:04:08] God to know what lays in store for you
[2:04:16] and I I close with this the Bible talks
[2:04:21] about the Queen of Sheba her overall
[2:04:25] objective the Bible says in 1 Kings sin
[2:04:29] and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the
[2:04:31] fame of Solomon concerning the name of
[2:04:33] the Lord she came to prove him with hard
[2:04:36] questions out here it is she's in her
[2:04:38] land and the message got back to her
[2:04:41] land didn't go out looking for it but
[2:04:46] the message found her you're no accident
[2:04:52] of God God found you when the atom sell
[2:04:59] it was God who became the first preacher
[2:05:02] the first gospel to say Adam
[2:05:04] we rocked out God didn't say hey where
[2:05:09] you at
[2:05:10] God knew his name that's the reason why
[2:05:14] the Bible says your name was written
[2:05:15] before the foundation of the world
[2:05:18] why because the lamb was slain when
[2:05:21] before the foundation of the world so
[2:05:25] she wasn't looking for the message but
[2:05:28] the message found her and when the Queen
[2:05:32] of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
[2:05:34] concerning the name of the Lord she just
[2:05:37] didn't say man that message sounded good
[2:05:41] she didn't say man that sounds really
[2:05:45] encouraging but the Bible says she came
[2:05:48] so she had to get energized she had to
[2:05:52] put her faith into action and she came
[2:05:55] to prove him not with some simple
[2:05:57] questions but she had some big questions
[2:06:01] if he's if he's a guy he says he is and
[2:06:04] who everybody else say he is and he has
[2:06:06] all this wisdom well III got some tough
[2:06:08] questions so prophets is this the
[2:06:12] Prophet says it was a three months
[2:06:14] journey and this is a pagan this is a
[2:06:16] this is a person who knows nothing about
[2:06:18] Jehovah who knows nothing about Elohim
[2:06:21] and just heard about the message that
[2:06:25] was your response at one time you heard
[2:06:28] this message in like man sounds really
[2:06:30] good how can I get more of this three
[2:06:38] months journey she had camels and she
[2:06:42] put her faith into action and there was
[2:06:45] risk along that journey there were
[2:06:48] robbers and thieves along the way but
[2:06:51] that was not a deterrent for her she was
[2:06:54] committed to get into church she was
[2:06:58] committed to hear what the preacher had
[2:07:00] to say that's the reason why she got up
[2:07:04] that morning because she had questions
[2:07:08] that's the reason why you came this
[2:07:10] morning you have questions you have
[2:07:14] needs here's the thing
[2:07:19] there's not one need identified here
[2:07:21] this morning that God doesn't know
[2:07:22] before the foundation of the world
[2:07:24] there's not one prayer that you can't
[2:07:26] whisper that God didn't know that you're
[2:07:28] gonna say those things God puts you in
[2:07:30] position so that way he can hear from
[2:07:31] you
[2:07:33] because we talk to everybody else and
[2:07:36] let everybody else know your business
[2:07:37] and then you don't talk to God you
[2:07:39] probably should start there first come
[2:07:43] on somebody I got calls I got call
[2:07:46] sister Susan and I got call brother Tom
[2:07:49] nah talk to God first let him know your
[2:07:53] problems and keep in mind he already
[2:07:57] knows your problems there's not anything
[2:08:00] new that you're gonna tell God that he
[2:08:03] doesn't already know and she came to
[2:08:07] Jerusalem with a very great train with
[2:08:09] camels that bear spices and very much
[2:08:12] gold and precious stones and when she
[2:08:16] was come to Solomon she commune with him
[2:08:19] all that was in her heart she brought
[2:08:22] she came to church bearing gifts she
[2:08:28] just comes that way some preacher could
[2:08:30] preach to her but she has something to
[2:08:32] offer to the service sometimes you go
[2:08:37] through battles and you just come to
[2:08:40] church and you pop you're yourself down
[2:08:43] and the song leader has to come up and
[2:08:45] you're thinking he's suffering he'd
[2:08:47] better sing me happy because I had a
[2:08:49] long week and so so Lear try to sing you
[2:08:56] happy but you know what you got to
[2:08:59] change that attitude sometimes I don't
[2:09:03] feel like singing but that doesn't stop
[2:09:06] me from singing
[2:09:07] I don't feel like clapping but that
[2:09:11] doesn't stop me from clapping I don't
[2:09:14] feel like saying Amen but that doesn't
[2:09:16] stop me from saying Amen you gotta come
[2:09:22] with that right attitude each of you
[2:09:26] play a role in service and when we're
[2:09:31] singing a congregational song I may not
[2:09:33] hear your voice but God hears your voice
[2:09:36] still sing to God be in that moment
[2:09:43] think about the world capitalized on
[2:09:46] being in
[2:09:46] zone to accomplish whatever feat
[2:09:49] whatever things they want to accomplish
[2:09:51] what about you being that inspiration be
[2:09:55] in that anointing be in service some
[2:09:59] people sleep here more comfortably than
[2:10:00] they do in their own bed but as a
[2:10:04] preacher we see all kinds of things from
[2:10:05] up here we tab I stand up we time we
[2:10:09] read the scriptures and then we let them
[2:10:11] have their see you see some people get
[2:10:12] so comfortable in the chair they get
[2:10:14] it's like it's like they're making an S
[2:10:16] on the chair
[2:10:17] cuz they get ready go to sleep and the
[2:10:20] preacher got a certain time before
[2:10:21] because that threshold of that 30
[2:10:23] minutes 45 minutes in a sleeve time
[2:10:29] because we get so comfortable but if I
[2:10:34] was telling y'all hey here's how you can
[2:10:35] make $100,000 by the end of the day all
[2:10:37] y'all be awake pens notepads everything
[2:10:42] ready to go y'all have your recording
[2:10:45] devices all your phones be up close
[2:10:46] we're all sitting right here in front of
[2:10:47] me because there's certain things that
[2:10:52] just excite the natural man but the
[2:10:54] spiritual man that's the banner that
[2:10:55] we're constantly facing that's the
[2:10:57] reason why the Bible says David says I
[2:10:59] encourage myself daily in the Lord what
[2:11:05] is your source of encouragement what
[2:11:08] motivates you what gets you going I was
[2:11:11] on the church I was certain that the
[2:11:13] church I said every morning I get up I
[2:11:15] will read a scripture because that's my
[2:11:19] daily source of motivation that's my
[2:11:22] daily source of inspiration that's my
[2:11:24] daily source of encouragement if I don't
[2:11:25] read a scripture if I don't start off in
[2:11:27] prayer my day is a disaster if he said
[2:11:31] brother Gina I don't know why my day
[2:11:32] went so crazy did you start the day with
[2:11:34] Christ because if he didn't start with
[2:11:37] Christ you started with a different
[2:11:38] spirit it's the reality Saints
[2:11:45] especially when you're running late from
[2:11:47] work and you don't get in the mind and
[2:11:49] the right and the right mind frame
[2:11:50] you're weaving in and out of traffic
[2:11:52] you're probably late from dropping the
[2:11:53] kids off you're running here you're
[2:11:55] running there you're late to a meeting
[2:11:56] or your lane to a task you go you get in
[2:11:58] you're frantic and it does your
[2:12:00] whole day out of whack when you find
[2:12:04] yourself in that moment take a step back
[2:12:06] I'm not telling you something I haven't
[2:12:08] done take a step back catch a breath and
[2:12:11] just still word of Prayer say lord I I
[2:12:14] started this day off oh I started it
[2:12:15] without you
[2:12:16] but I can't complete it without you and
[2:12:21] every time it's never failed me never
[2:12:25] once ever failed me and Solomon told her
[2:12:29] all her questions there was not anything
[2:12:33] hid from the King which he told her not
[2:12:36] and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all
[2:12:39] of Solomon's wisdom in the house that he
[2:12:42] had built in the meat of his table in
[2:12:45] the sitting of his servants that is the
[2:12:47] pagan scene what's going on in church in
[2:12:49] the attendance of his ministers in their
[2:12:52] apparel they're watching you in church
[2:12:54] for you you right here serving God right
[2:12:59] but when someone's visiting and they're
[2:13:00] coming in and they're just they're
[2:13:01] observing church order they're seeing
[2:13:04] how you worship they're seeing how you
[2:13:06] dress they see how you carry yourself
[2:13:10] they're watching you know there's your I
[2:13:14] her singing and they're just looking at
[2:13:15] you
[2:13:16] because they want to know what church
[2:13:18] orders like and that's what she did so
[2:13:22] she watch the Bible says she watched to
[2:13:24] meet at his table how the word was
[2:13:26] preached this is me to you she was
[2:13:28] listening to the meat she was she's
[2:13:30] listening to the meat I disabled and the
[2:13:32] sitting of his servants the positions
[2:13:34] the Deacons state the trustees say the
[2:13:36] musicians say the the song leader Tate
[2:13:38] they're watching all of this in the
[2:13:41] attendance of his ministers and how the
[2:13:43] ministry supports each other and their
[2:13:46] apparel the way you dress the way you
[2:13:47] carry selves and his cupbearers in his
[2:13:51] ascent by which he went up into the
[2:13:54] house of the Lord his the sin is how you
[2:13:58] went into the house of the Lord not
[2:14:00] coming and chewing gum hey God hey God
[2:14:01] that how you doing none of that just
[2:14:05] coming in a way that's very sacred and
[2:14:07] respectable as the prophecies and they
[2:14:10] it was just kind of veered away from it
[2:14:12] 30 minutes before church
[2:14:14] starts to get in that right mind frame
[2:14:19] because it's your moment with God it's
[2:14:23] your opportunity with God
[2:14:26] she was observing all that and she said
[2:14:29] to the king it is it was a true report
[2:14:32] the message was not a lie it was a true
[2:14:38] report that I heard of my own land of
[2:14:41] your acts and of your wisdom howbeit I
[2:14:45] believe not the words until I came and
[2:14:49] my eyes had seen it and behold the half
[2:14:56] was not told to me I'm closing with this
[2:15:00] thy wisdom and prosperity exceeds the
[2:15:05] fame which I heard let's all stand as I
[2:15:12] say this this last statement howbeit I
[2:15:15] believe not the words until I came and
[2:15:17] saw for myself and mine eyes had seen it
[2:15:21] and behold the half listen to this the
[2:15:25] half was not told to me thy wisdom and
[2:15:31] prosperity exceeds the fame which I
[2:15:36] heard I heard a brother I'm not sure who
[2:15:41] said it but he says and it's one of my
[2:15:45] favorite quotes that brother Ram says
[2:15:46] throughout eternity God will continue to
[2:15:51] unfold himself if you're excited about
[2:15:56] this message that you've heard if you're
[2:16:01] excited about what you have received
[2:16:04] that was what Paul was so excited about
[2:16:07] that was his overall objective can you
[2:16:10] imagine the glory that you're gonna walk
[2:16:14] into Paul says I've reached on to the
[2:16:17] third heavens and what I have seen no
[2:16:20] eyes have seen or ears have heard the
[2:16:24] promises that's in store
[2:16:27] for you and I I don't want to miss this
[2:16:32] for nothing it was no accident that a
[2:16:37] prophet went beyond the curtains of time
[2:16:39] and when he saw the glimpse of eternity
[2:16:43] God brought him back to express what he
[2:16:47] saw so that we you and I could be
[2:16:50] encouraged with what to look forward to
[2:16:55] that's what motivates me this promise
[2:16:59] word and like the brother said I've read
[2:17:03] the end of the Bible and it's in my
[2:17:05] favor we've won the fight let's bow
[2:17:10] hearts as the musicians come up Heavenly
[2:17:17] Father we thank you for your grace dear
[2:17:22] Lord we thank you for your message
[2:17:26] father I gave my best to your people
[2:17:30] bringing forth this sward
[2:17:32] this unadulterated Word this pure word
[2:17:37] father this word that changes lies this
[2:17:42] word that heals the hills
[2:17:44] those that are sick for your God that
[2:17:48] healeth all thy diseases you answer
[2:17:53] every prayer we thank you for your the
[2:17:57] grace that you've shown upon us the Lord
[2:17:59] we're living in dark times we're living
[2:18:04] in perilous times when men are no longer
[2:18:08] man and women are no longer women father
[2:18:12] the world is falling apart but we think
[2:18:17] you'd alert because you've given us a
[2:18:18] foundation on which we can stand on we
[2:18:22] think you because of the truth that you
[2:18:24] bestowed upon us and father we we're
[2:18:29] engaged in this battle we've come a long
[2:18:33] way
[2:18:35] and we know father day you who have
[2:18:38] started to work in us will finish it
[2:18:42] we're not gonna give up now dear Lord as
[2:18:46] things are beginning to wind up the Lord
[2:18:49] as we see it in the out there in the
[2:18:51] world and in society draw us closer to
[2:18:55] your word keep us fortified keep us
[2:19:01] anointed in that message and if there's
[2:19:04] anyone out there that's lost their steam
[2:19:06] that's lost their enthusiasm that's lost
[2:19:09] their drive to to to to just push
[2:19:12] forward to God I pray for them even now
[2:19:15] that you may recan --dl that excitement
[2:19:19] about this message that's Jubilee that
[2:19:22] this message has come to give us but the
[2:19:26] Bible says he who the Sun has set free
[2:19:28] is truly free indeed we're no longer in
[2:19:33] bondage there's no reason why any of us
[2:19:37] should ever be fearful
[2:19:39] for you have given us a word a more a
[2:19:42] word that's a more sure word of prophecy
[2:19:45] that we could speak healing we can speak
[2:19:49] these things the Lord that the devil
[2:19:52] thought that that we didn't have access
[2:19:54] to but we have access your blood has
[2:19:59] given us access and we now know who we
[2:20:02] are were sons and daughters of God and
[2:20:03] we no longer should restrain ourselves
[2:20:06] but be in a position to speak whatever
[2:20:09] our hearts so desire knowing that the
[2:20:11] hosts of heaven such distinction it
[2:20:15] we pray for our families we pray for our
[2:20:18] loved ones we pray for our health we
[2:20:22] pray for all these things that we have
[2:20:24] need of the Lord there's not a
[2:20:25] headquarters Church that we could go to
[2:20:27] but we come to the author and finisher
[2:20:29] of our faith may you keep this people
[2:20:36] until keep them new Lord on this wall
[2:20:41] keep them in this in this path
[2:20:44] and I know that they're they're Devils
[2:20:46] that's lurking on either side there God
[2:20:48] that's trying to take them off that
[2:20:49] beaten path but keep them the Lord on
[2:20:52] the straight and narrow especially as we
[2:20:55] see the day's winding up keep them in
[2:20:59] that straight and narrow keep them in
[2:21:00] that path maybe watch and protect
[2:21:03] remember their pastor who's out in the
[2:21:06] field the Lord Grantham traveling

[2:22:12] the past six seven months that have not
[2:22:16] talked about this subject the
[2:22:18] manifestation of the sons of God all
[2:22:22] creation is groaning and travailing unto
[2:22:25] now waiting for us to come to opposition
[2:22:28] you know and we all we beginning to
[2:22:31] recognize who we are and God only wants
[2:22:35] us to have faith and move out but our
[2:22:38] enemy he he's very shrewd he wants you
[2:22:41] to not believe God not believe who you
[2:22:44] are but if you do believe he wants you
[2:22:48] to be afraid of who you are and what
[2:22:52] your commission is what you're supposed
[2:22:54] to do so many times I believe it's over
[2:22:58] 400 times in the scripture is written
[2:23:00] fear not but Satan wants us to be afraid
[2:23:05] but again God reigns another serving
[2:23:07] this way tell you to step out

[2:23:45] God he wants you to take your position
[2:23:49] speak and go forth it's what we must do
[2:23:52] is what we're commissioned to do only
[2:23:55] believe all things are possible to them
