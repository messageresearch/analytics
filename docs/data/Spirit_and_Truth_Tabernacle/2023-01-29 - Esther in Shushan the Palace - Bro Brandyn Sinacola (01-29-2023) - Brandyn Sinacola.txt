going to leave the singing to you all because you do it so good so I just try to get into my channel because you've got into yours amen if you would you can have your seats just for a moment I I won't be long because I tell you I was trying to look over my notes in the back and I finally just had to stand up because you guys worshiped so good it just flows all through this place glory and I'll tell you friends I I uh as as Pastor said I'm my name is Brandon and I'm the assistant pastor back home and and I have a real heart uh sharing and and Pastor uh Paul's burdens and things I share in those with him and it's just something that the Lord's done natural and and uh so I I have a real heart for for pastors and pastors families and their wives and where where's where's the first lady that's I thought it was you God bless you Sister all right God bless you now don't let this get out back home but I have a favorite violinist I I told Brett I asked brother Jack I said is that a live violin and he said yeah I said brother you don't know what that does to me I love the violin and then where's where's his is your other daughter here that saying oh wow that's a change boy well don't don't you can let her know but don't let word get out back home she came and she sang a song I believe it was her and uh that that is my favorite song I just I just it does something to me I just say it like that so thank you so you know I don't go out too much I just feel called you know I stay home a lot just where my wife and I are home bodies this is the first uh real vacation that we've taken since our honeymoon so um so this is this has been a joy for us thank you for sharing your country down here is just beautiful I'm sure I thought you know it's not fair that you guys get to live down here but then I thought for your sake it's not fair because all of us from up North come down here and crowd your space so so I thought well I'll just say thank you for sharing but you know brother brother Branham uh I I don't go out much and I remember hearing brother Branham say one time he says you know when you go someplace you just you talk a little bit just to so the people can catch your spirit you can catch theirs and then you just break the ice so but um I'll tell you if uh if you want to stand to your feet and I I just say so many things have blessed me that you've you've sang that you've said it brother intercede for me this morning that was that was a blessing you don't know hey brother you you did that was outstanding and the the words to that song really ministered to me um down to hearing that there's a new brother visiting coming today and you know I was thinking as I was thinking about you guys I thought you know a pastor's heart you know is to have his own building it's it's to be have your own meeting place and and so I was just thinking about that and I thought you know you guys have been placed here for for a purpose and you haven't had a building open up yet for a purpose and that brother was three minutes away and here this morning you could have been here for however long you've been here for one soul for one Soul God could have held you here and now I pray that he's here I pray that the doors open amen amen God bless you that did me so good to hear that because I just like I said I just feeling for brother Jack and and so I was going to say that anyway because I've been thinking about it and to hear that I am just so excited for you so your future is bright friends your future is bright amen Hallelujah and then not knowing where I was going to take my text from Brother Jack starts talking about it and so I would like you to open up to Esther chapter 2. stir chapter 2 and verse 5. I'll give you a minute to get there and and I'm just so you don't get nervous I'm gonna paint a little bit of a negative picture at the beginning but the end is going to be glorious okay so just just hold on with me and and we're going to go through the word of God and and I'll have quite a few scriptures at the end I'm just going to read them fast so don't feel like you got to turn there just because I just feel like it just drives the point home so Esther 2 and verse 5. it says now in shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of jair the son of shimmyi the son of Kish a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away from draconia King of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful who Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hagai that Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of hagai Keeper of the women and then I'll just quote for you the next verse there says what favor she gained let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and just ask you God I know you're here of God I just feel you flowing through this place Lord we see Your Glory on each face father and so the people have done their part Lord help me to get out of the way now to do my part Lord is just to get out of the way and let you flow through me Lord we're here God to hear your word not not some no name from Michigan but to hear from almighty God Grant it now bless this people Lord I pray special prayer father that you would just let the right church God let that be the door that opens if it's not your will for one of them God keep that door shut but Lord if it is your will I've seen you do it time and time again where the door opens and this church will just walk right into it blessed now father in Jesus name amen amen you can have your seats and I I greet you from my wife said be sure to give you her greetings from Pastor Paul and the church back home God bless you and brother Jack I believe brother Rapp was with you you were at winter youth retreat right he said to give you his greeting so so I've been going through the Book of Esther back home and it just seems like each time I I open it something else just jumps out at me and so you know and and that's that's good and fine but unless we can bring that down to Everyday living I I'm it's it's exciting and it's it's good things but I don't want this to just be I I'm not a dazzling preacher I'm I'm least among the Brethren but uh you know if if God can give us something to help our everyday life and help edify the church then then I'm happy I just I have to leave pretty quick here but if if when I go back behind there you can say you've seen Jesus Christ I'll be Satisfied amen amen so there's many types in the Book of Esther and and it starts with this very extravagant party and and and in in a queen's appearance Queen vashti being requested by the king and this this helps some of the sisters back home and so I just thought maybe I would just in laying a foundation to get where I want to get to I just thought I would I would paint this picture of what Esther grew up in and what what she had to endure and and you know she was maybe in a nice Community a nice Jewish Community with with Believers of of like Precious faith and then and then this event happens and you and The King The King calls for Queen vashti she's the she's the representative of the king she's the she's the reflection of the king and when he calls for she rejects him and you can see the type here already that that there's this this powerful King and in the history says he was one of the most powerful he had one of the most illustrious kingdoms of of history of the medes in Persian they were the strongest Empire of that day they were the first superpower they were the first superpower of the day and so the king you know of course he's he's he's drunk and I don't know all of vashti's reasons for for turning him down and I thought you know well Lord I is just thinking this morning friends and and I was thinking you you can type in Shadow God has not mentioned one time in the Book of Esther the name of God does not appear and yet it's one of the most beautiful types of the love story that's in the Bible and so I just got to thinking about it this morning and I thought Lord how do you tell those people that there's a drunk King that represents you but I thought about it and I thought he ordered the wine to be as much as anyone would want and we know that the wine is the stimulation of Revelation so that King was drunk on Revelation and that's the type to God Amen and when I saw that I just thought oh my and then I thought well let's run it over into Revelations and he says don't touch the wine in the oil don't touch that Holy Ghost don't touch that Holy Spirit don't touch the stimulation that's here in this church this morning amen amen my goodness you guys pool and so so the king the king he the the queen rejects the king he bids her come and she rejects it what was that she rejected the word of the king so now you have a you have a bride in the scripture who rejects the word of God and she gets rejected because of it amen that's why so vashti was put out for her lack of submission to the king's word she was not connected to the king she could not she could put the crown on that the king had given her but the king wanted someone who was connected with him he wanted somebody who loved him who reflected who he was in his glory this is one of the most glorious kings in the history of the medes and Persians and he wanted a wife he wanted a bride to reflect that and you you catch what I'm laying down this morning amen a queen submissive not because she had to be but because she wanted to be because she had a love for him she had a desire for him vashti was like the other women we find when Esther is called up and and and they they're told pick anything you want to take before the king that's yours to keep after and and all the other women you see you you get it you get a look into the life of of Esther and her character because she goes to the one who knew the king she goes to Hagee eye who who was who was dressing the bride she went to the prophet amen and asked what does the king like amen and the other women they were just they were just there to get all the benefits but they didn't want the the the commitment with the King and the King wanted someone he could be one with someone who who becomes part of him not not the man becomes part of the woman and we're just getting a little bit of marriage here this morning yeah not not the the the the the man becomes part of the woman but first Corinthians says the man wasn't created for the woman but woman for the man and and you know there's many times that sisters can say well I don't understand that I don't understand why you know we can't have these things why we can't do these things well sister that's because you hold a special key in the scripture listen to me now [Applause] sister you hold such a special I'm telling you right now sis you say oh but the brothers got it all no sis that oh my that that brother is nothing without you sister and let me tell you something Hallelujah God is nothing without us and I'm not saying that to be some cocky thing I'm saying that because he set it up that way Jehovah God set it up to say My bride is going to draw out attributes out of me that that brother that brother has things lying inside of Him Sister that he needs you for [Applause] that's why I assist my my my first lady here this morning this brother has things in him that he needs you for I tell you we we ministers couldn't do it without our wives we need that help me you brother you you and let's bring it down now brother you you need your wife every day to go to your job you need that support what who let me tell you something I'm just quoting the prophet now when you come home from a bad day who can take that away like nobody else that's your sweetheart brother and you should treat her like your sweetheart man treat her like like your queen [Applause] amen sister you are you are the betting ground of Life Christ injects himself into us now without getting too plain this morning you know when a man and woman come together the man injects himself into the wife and she Bears life so this is just perfect types here she takes on his life his name his identity she loses her own she she even loses uh oh this is okay she even loses her own body and and and and Christ pours himself out into the church to be one with her he wants all of her heart he doesn't want to share her with the world she don't God don't want to share you with the world I'm gonna tell you something this is just how I feel about things as as in this this is my prayer here this morning is sometimes in our nerves as ministers we can come into another man's pulpit and we'll say you know brother if I say anything wrong you get up and correct it but I believe we have a God who if he could shut Lion's mouths he could shut my mouth so that your pastor don't have to get up and correct anything so vashti wanted to control and Lead but it showed something was wrong in her heart and you can find all of this in the message God put that feminine spirit in the woman because she was to follow and and really brothers and sisters that that woman wants somebody to follow she wants a brother who's who's strong in the Lord who's she she wants a Praying husband she wants somebody to take her to church she wants it friends she she she's longing for it you say well but brother my my my wife she's she always takes the range and she's the spiritual leader of the home well maybe if you would take him she wouldn't have to maybe maybe she's just waiting on you to take it she's waiting on you to lead amen [Applause] the man and wife are to be one in body and in spirit connected physically and emotionally now listen brother you can say sis you can't withhold your body from me the scripture says it the minister just said it but brother I'm telling you it's wrong for you to expect that and not give her your heart and not and not give her your eyes and not give her your your mind amen you you are to give your entire self you can't just expect that from her you give yourself and she'll give herself amen and let me tell you something for for for those of you who've been married gonna be married you don't want it any other way when you give yourself fully everything else is is the most beautiful thing you'll have on this Earth me and my wife when we do get to go you know little getaways around around for our anniversary just most the time we just go in Michigan and and we always call it our honeymoon it's not our anniversary it's our honeymoon because we just you know we we go and we just feel like we're on a honeymoon again we just we're we're just so connected and and my my prayer is that you all experience that as well the the and and hopefully you're seeing this morning the most beautiful relationship that's on this face of the earth is with a man and his wife and and and spiritually with with between us and God Amen Amen Let me just catch myself because I was all over my notes spiritual blessings Christ wants our whole heart just as much as as we want to come and we want to feel the presence of God God wants us to come into His presence amen he wants us to experience his love he's he's he's Longing To Give You of himself and all he needs is for you to Just Surrender is not complicated friends it's just surrender [Music] [Applause] so we're just going to take a little bit of a turn here so stay stay with me we also find in chapter one the setting of our story is is this medes and Persian Empire shushan the palace and as I told you it was it was one of the most illustrious of its day and we can find many similarities between the setting of that age Esther was placed in and the age we've been placed in that that that was it was the largest of the day even even to I heard one thing it's it's sometimes it's hard to find in the history in that but if one thing said that um it's it was about the size of the United States close to it another thing I read was about you know half of the United States regardless that's a big Empire that's a big Empire and and we can find in Daniel chapter 10 and verse 13 it says but the prince of the kingdom of Persia which stood me when in 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the King of Persia Kings of Persia now what I want to grab from this scripture is that there's a spirit on every nation and this this is proof of it in the Bible that the prince of the kingdom of Persia now this was an angel of the Lord coming to Daniel and and this isn't a spiritual Dimension so we understand that we we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and strongholds and things and and high places but so if there was a spirit on the kingdom of Persia then there's a spirit on the kingdom of America and we see that you don't need me to tell you these things but the spirit on this nation of Persia it was a very rich and glorious Kingdom it was a spirit in this Kingdom of excess and an addiction and drunkenness wow at the time the history says that at the time and it's just so beautiful I just love the scriptures because you have Ezra and Esther and Nehemiah and they all start running really close and even overlapping a little bit and back home what the Lord showed me is you know the brother Branham said that the seven the church ages and the seals they they overlap there's an overlap period so we see that these periods in the Bible these books of the Bibles they actually overlap a little bit and when Nehemiah takes the Jews back to Jerusalem there were actually many Jews stayed because they became lukewarm and comfortable they enjoyed the illustrious of that Kingdom so much that they didn't go back and take the land they didn't go back they didn't go all the way into God's promises they got hung up right there on the illustrious they became comfortable and lukewarm there was a spirit of of heathenism and tradition but but also a blurring in religion because the religion of the medes and pers was monotheistic they believed in one God and and they had what I what I would consider what they would say would be a modern day Prophet to them but yet they didn't they didn't necessarily force that on the people they said you can have your own but yet their laws and things were so great that they could still control the other religions and we see that when Haman comes up and he's changing laws and and this is there's scripture it's just so beautiful changing laws and things to get control of God's people yeah so uh they're forcing laws and and we know that the laws have changed in our day to force the the the the the the sin of the world around us on us not that we have to partake in it but it's you you see it's it's growing this Kingdom of America this spirit is growing amen we see that women were beautiful and and there was a spirit of immodesty in the medes and Persians there was a spirit of Anger of rage and murder we've never seen it like we have today in our day and it just keeps getting worse and worse and and and you know there was something um on the Roman Empire and they had a city and it was called Sin City in the Roman Empire and I just thought man if if we could just contain it to one city that would be great but we got it we got it just overflowing and it's just the spirit on the age today there's a spirit of compromise and and that was proven when most of the Jews stayed back and so so this is what we're warring against as Christians this is what when you get down to pray I want to encourage you this morning that the angel told Daniel Daniel I heard you from the first day I heard you the first time you prayed you've been praying for something for a long time but I'll tell you keep praying because remember the prophet got to look into the other dimension and he said your faith determines which way that war is going so if you can just latch on to the word of God and and believe and and have faith in the word of God you can sway the way that that battle goes but just know that there is a battle there is a battle in the other dimension Satan does not want God to answer your prayer but God is on the scene he's uh he's he's on the work amen what I like about that scripture in Daniel 2 is is there's this Angel of the Lord and he comes to Daniel and he says Daniel I heard you I I it took me 21 days to get to you but I've been trying I've been trying but he said but listen to me he said but Michael came Michael came I got a scripture for you at the end he says Michael your prince came that's Jehovah that's Jesus Christ coming on the scene and he says you know what it was it was too much for his angels I don't understand that but I do know that God when he saw that it wasn't getting through he said that's it I'm coming myself I'm gonna come do it I'm gonna come in war with the angel we find the spirit of America drunkenness excess lust immorality sexuality want for entertainment and not the gospel there is so much entertainment and social media and things today I I tell you when you do that fast I would encourage you to fast from social media make sure you make that apart and then add the food like your pastor because you'll you'll notice a difference if you're depressed and you're on social media get off social media just just try it I I challenge you try it 21 days 21 days I think they say that it to break a habit to make a new habit is 21 days I challenge you 21 days just take a fast from social media and can I can I say this too because I I friends I do this too I'm not preaching anything that I don't do myself but but take a break from watching silly videos online you know yeah because you get you get on your Facebook and things and you can scroll and you can see all these videos and stuff and listen to me you can actually excuse things that you know well it's on Facebook oh they they threw that in there so I let that go but friends come on we let's be real with each other I'm preaching to me just as much as I'm preaching to you you YouTube all of that you know when you when you go to bed at night yeah yeah I won't ask for a show of hands but if I did we would all be raising them if we're honest you're gonna scroll through YouTube and things before you go to bed come on somebody I I gotta swallow it just as much as you do Hallelujah there's scoffers at the word of God here in America it's there's a comfortable and and satisfied living and we if we're not careful we can become comfortable and satisfied with sin that doesn't make you a bad person that doesn't make you lost that makes you living in the United States that makes you living in laodicea as friends so don't let Satan come in your mind this is what I'm getting at don't let Satan come in your mind and tell you you're not saved you don't have what you thought you did you're not where you thought you were that's the devil we all struggle we all we all have things but but and I'm not excusing things now but I'm just encouraging you in the Lord because Satan can really get after you sometimes and that that's where I'm going here we become comfort with extravagance and convenience we become self-seeking seeking after temporal and fleeting things that have no lasting joy we can become proud this is this is this is the spirit around us and and it can influence us proud and arrogant there's there's insane and mental unstability like never before that's I love that sister special when she's saying and she said that she said that you know nothing's too too strong for God not even the mental illness of today there's an irreverence of today now I'm going to take is it okay to take this off I can just lay it over this chair brother thank you thank you I told Brother Jack I was I was picking my suit out for the day and my wife said well it's going to be hot don't wear a three piece and I thought no they know how to dress down there hahaha that's all right bro and I walked up and I told Brother Jack I said I'm sure glad I wore my three piece today because you all look good that's all right brother [Applause] so at Esther chapter 3 and verse one says after these things did King ahazarus promote Haman the son of hamadatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman for the king had so commanded concerning him now this might be confusing a little bit because I'm typing back and forth between God and in in the scripture but I was thinking about this today and and it now I'm not making a Doctrine out of this okay I'm just saying this is just something that I saw in just just this morning when I was looking at that wine and the oil and and it took me over to the third seal and brother Branham was talking about the the horse riders in the Book of Revelation and I actually to me I saw haman's what I'm going to call his ministry there all right and now I'm going to type Haman with the Devil but there's I'm going to take it a step further too something in the Scofield notes I thought was amazing we so we find many types between Haman to Satan himself the enemy of God's people throughout the time the main thing was Haman wanted to destroy God's people and you you know the story of Esther so I won't dwell on that too much but again he changed laws and put laws into action and we have the Satan putting laws into action today to try to to try to put pressure on you to conform to this world Amen Haman gets extremely jealous over God's people he gets extremely jealous over them being promoted and not worshiping him and we can go into Isaiah and I and I took the scripture out now you're familiar with it whereas how about the Fallen o Lucifer and and the devil's just exposed Lucifer's exposed in those scriptures of his desire to be like the most high he and and what a braggard I will be like the most high and and in our story Haman actually he he's he comes before the king and the King again you know the story but he says King The King says Heyman I got a question for you what should I do to a man who I want to bless and Haman says uh here's my moment King you should dress him in your robe you should put him on your horse over in Revelations we find him riding a white horse right he says and then and then again friends this is just then the second writer comes and he's got a crown at that point and what did Haman ask for he said put the crown royal on top of his head let him let him and just be led through the street by your most noble person Watch the watch this backfire on the devil because the king says that's a great idea Heyman go do everything you said under Mordecai go do it to the one who you want to kill and friends and then you can just run this through and and and and you say well I I don't understand because how is how is the king just promoting Haman and how is this happening to where he's given him rulership over God's people remember there was a day when the sons of Man became before God in job now and and and he said God saw Satan in the back and he says hey what are you doing and he says I'm going to and fro throughout all the Earth and then what did God say what did the king say he said hey have you considered my servant job you say God I wish you wouldn't do that Lord I wish I we had a prophet in our day come and he said that's been you because he knows you're gonna he's he's gonna see you through you're gonna make it through and so he says hey why don't you cons why don't you consider my servant jacked up God and that's because he has faith in you and and but but but we draw something from that that Satan can't touch you without God's permission so I think our brother here said at the beginning of the service he says somebody said it your trials are predestinated by God your trial can't come to you unless God allows that trial in your life and you say but oh it gets it gets so heavy I can't bear it you can bear it because God will not put any more on you than what you can handle so if you're dealing with cancer this morning to God be the glory if you're dealing with with a loved one who you've been praying for for a long time and you're not seeing anything come back out of their lives to God be the glory you keep praying because remember that battle is going on in the other dimension oh man amen amen hallelujah amen so thank you Lord so verse 6 there was something in in Esther and I think this is chapter four chapter three I guess I took that out excuse me verse six and and Haman is going back and he you want a good look at what the devil is like go read Esther when Haman gets so upset and he goes stamping his feet back to his little demons it says I just can't do it to him I just can't get through to him I can't make them bow I can't make them do this and he gets he just throws this little pity party that's right yes nothing but a to worship amen then Haman said okay I'll go myself and that's when we find him before the king and he presents the the plot to kill God's people before the king and then we see the king sign it with his ring it says whatever you say well then this is where I typed in job that's the only way it could happen yeah right right that's right so I want to just real quick follow it the scripture is is careful to say Haman the agagite and so I I started looking up agagite one day and following that lineage we go back to Genesis and we find Esau has a son named amalek then over in Exodus 17 we find amalek is found again and and he's fighting against the children of Israel on their way to the promised land now I don't know his his reason for it it just says they they come up out I think out of the Wilderness or just trying to remember the way their scriptures worded and it says and amulet came against him Schofield writes this on amalek he said he was born after the flesh a progenerator of the amalekites Israel's persistent enemy it's a type of the Flesh in The Believer so I want to take this Haman a little bit further than just the devil because we are we fight against the devil but you fight your worst enemy is yourself it's this right here this flesh and that's the same for every human being it's the persistent enemy it's the type of the flesh he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now but the conflict with emalek in chapter 17 sets forth the resources of the man under the law so it rather than those of the believer under grace the man under the law could fight and pray but under grace the Holy Spirit gains the victory over the Flesh on the believer's behalf now you say brother I that was that was great reading but what's it mean go read Romans 7 what's Paul say he says when I want to do good there's evil always with me when I'm trying to do good I find myself doing what I don't want to do and the things that I want to do I can't seem to do and then he says what that is is there's he actually calls it a law of sin that works in your body now I brought this out at home and I just thought this was so good is that when you do wrong you'll find this in the message now so I'm not off my rocker I don't believe but you'll find this in the message that when you do wrong that's not you any longer remember justification is just as if you never did it in the first place God is looking at your desire and if you don't desire that thing that's why Paul could write there is there no no sorry let me catch my tongue there is no condemnation to them who believe in Christ Jesus why is it because when you when you sin that's the sin working in your flesh not you doing it I I hope I said that just right because because when you know we beat ourselves up and you know we we've heard it many times Satan's the one who tempts you and then when when you fall into that Temptation then he goes and calls the police on you and he's going to Heap up that condemnation and and I'm not saying don't repent repent and bring that under the blood but I'm saying when you do that's where it stops it's just as if you never did it in the first place God doesn't look at you then he's looking at you through his blood what he sees is he sees your enemy he sees your flesh he sees the sin that's working in your flesh amen are you still with me but this victory the victory of the holy spirit that that can be had in your in on your behalf that Victory is only as the believer walks in the spirit acting in Independence or Disobedience amalek the flesh gains an easy victory we've experienced that many times can you say Amen but I'm making my turn now this is the word of the Lord over you Esther 3 if you caught it it says at the beginning when it when it introduces Haman the agagite when it introduces your the type of your flesh it says after these things after these things after Esther was already sealed in after Esther was already Queen then Haman became you say well what's that mean brother after your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life under the shed blood of Jesus Christ then your aim then Lucifer was made but you were already sealed in and predestinated to make it you're gonna make it friend you're gonna you're gonna make it say I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it amen you're gonna make it through Hallelujah [Applause] now we're talking about spirits in high places we're talking about we're talking about the Prince of Persia we're talking about Satan himself but but we know that Satan is an angel and Hebrews 1 says talking of Christ being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtain a more excellent Name than they now now he he goes on to say For unto which of the Angels said he had any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth and the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him right verse 13 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit at my right hand until I make thine enemies my footstool uh that that oh let me catch that I want to read that right now sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of salvation Hallelujah even even the the Angels of Darkness are for your benefit they are they are and we we could say if I and I don't want to I don't want to lose this now because I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to get off on something strange here but let me say it this way we know that if we get off too far track God can allow things in our lives God can God can set that enemy loose on you to to to hurt you back to himself is that is that okay so in that way they're ministering spirits to you it's only to bring something out of you that's lying in there that God knows and it's and it's for Heirs of Salvation so so what am I getting at if all the Angels were placed under his feet and you're an heir to Salvation then all angels are set under your feet amen [Music] so you can't be touched glory amen well we're not we're not doing too bad on time I don't think oh my okay no I you guys start we started at 10 30 right bless you all oh my let's see here I'm gonna oh it's also good so we've talked about the spirit that's around us the spirit that can influence us but but you're of a spirit of above you're of a righteous Spirit not of Our Own but of his righteousness we're of a spirit of the power of the Holy Ghost and of his resurrection we're born from above this world is not our home we're pilgrims and strangers we're seeking a land to come not seeking worldly pleasure where new creatures in Christ change nature we're moral we're modest we're of a spirit that cannot fail Daniel chapter 10 we we read it that's where he says the Prince of Persia verse 20 says let's just say this is our verse 20. then said he knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia and when I am gone forth Lo the prince of Grisha shall come but I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of Truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but Michael your prince oh I love that Michael your prince who's your prince this morning Jesus Christ is your prince oh goodness now be honest with me have I been an hour okay I don't take your word for it Daniel 7 13 I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven I'm going to read a lot here but just just bask in the scripture one like the son of man came with clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was giving him dominion and glory in the Kingdom that all people Nations and tongues should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away in his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed verse 17 these great beasts which are for our Four Kings which shall arise out of the Earth but the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom there's a kingdom that we're fighting against but we're going to take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever and ever uh even forever and ever oh my verse verse 19 through 21 you can read it it's just talking about the the fierceness of of the beast in verse 22 until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom verse 25 and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the most high this is in there friends how many of you feel worn out come on it's all right [Applause] sometimes you just get tired and say Lord get send me a reprieve verse 26 but the Judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion now that didn't say he shall take away it says they shall take away you are going to take away the Dominion of your enemy to consume and destroy it unto the end in the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high Amen Let me I'm going to skip some of this here so we we typed Haman with with amalek and the flesh but your flesh isn't going to live forever now I just I just want to bring this in oh my Exodus 17. in verse 16 for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation so we see that war we see that that the Lord himself is going to war against your flesh he's gonna over in Ezekiel it says he's going to put a heart of Flesh in you he's going to take your Heart of Stone amen he's going to fill you with his spirit one more here Deuteronomy 25 17. remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when he when you were come forth out of Egypt when you came out of the world that's when your battle started how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of the even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary when he made you weary when he when he wore you out about and he feared and he feared not God verse 19 therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shall blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and then he says Thou shalt not forget it that means you must not forget you must not forget that one day the remembrance of this is going to be blotted out you're gonna live in you we can have Victory now we'll live in Victory now but one day the trouble that this caused is going to be forgotten amen one day you we're going to live in Paradise my goodness you you live in a paradise here it's just there's so and I'm sure you see the worst parts of it we're seeing the best parts of it right but but just to just to watch that that ocean and and the cleanness and things and I was sitting out by the ocean the other day the other night and I was praying for this service and I and I just thought Lord what what do I need in my life what do I what do I need what do you want to give me Lord what do I what do I need to go on with you and I was watching as the waves were coming in they were kind of high there's been a a rip current um warning you know so so I just watching the waves come up on shore and I was watching everything the seaweed kept washing up and as I I started walking because my girls I got I've got three children two two girls and a boy and they said Daddy we want you to bring us some shells and so I thought well I'll walk here and so I was in the dark so I had my flashlight and as I was walking I started noticing there's there's garbage in this seaweed that's been washing up and then my mind as I was praying that my mind went to when brother Bradham said a Revival in your heart is when the waves are washing the junk out it's getting the trash out of the water and cleaning the water and I thought God give me send down a holy ghost Revival give me Revival give me Revival in my heart amen renew a right Spirit Within Me oh my just some just some closing comments and and then I I'll I'll let you go Haman is told let me see here turn to Esther seven and I'm just going to make a couple comments and then I want to read you something in the scripture Haman is told by actually I think it was his wife and his people they actually tell him you're going to be the one to fall he builds he builds the Gallows for Mordecai because he just can't stand him and then he's the one that gets hung on him every attempt to destroy and accuse God's people to the king that Haman tried backfired on him and the King's Queen and God's people were exalted amen so Esther 7 and verse 6. and the King arising uh let me see oh I'm sorry you had it right I had it wrong oh my am I in the right spot yes yes yes yes verse six and Esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman then Haman was afraid before the king and the Queen remember we're typing now Satan is afraid of you when the weakest Christian no matter what you feel about yourself if you say God I am the weakest Christian in this room this morning when you get on your knees all of Hell starts trembling you can you can somebody said you shake it was the sermon he said to read you shake the gates of the enemy you possess the gates of the enemy Satan is afraid of you all you have to do if Satan's bothering you is change the atmosphere because the brother said that when the eagle and the snake are fighting he said all the ego has to do is take that snake up into his atmosphere and that snake becomes defenseless how do you win against the enemy is it anything you do I just heard this recently it was so beautiful the prophet said just humble yourself just humble yourself [Music] I'm gonna I'm gonna get I'm gonna get off my notes Here because this is how I want to end I'm giving you something now I haven't given it home so don't tell them we know that one of the greatest statements in the Book of Esther is mordecai telling her what if you've been placed in the Kingdom for such a time as this what if you've been placed in this part of Florida in this school building Desiring your own building for such a time as this because one soul needed to come brother I don't know where you are at in this room this morning but God has kept this church here for you you should feel so loved and so cherished this morning amen God withheld what we would say a blessing on this church because you needed a blessing and now I'm praying that The Floodgate opens amen amen and my brother don't feel bad because every person in this room right now I know because I can feel it in their Spirit they'll say brother it was worth it it was worth the wait waiting for you amen amen brother Branham said this and then I'll just close in a super sign and he's talking all about the promise to Abraham that your seed shall possess the gates of the enemy and he made this one statement in there and this just brought it to today for me for such a time as this he said talking of Moses come into the Red Sea he said he knowed he was born for that age to manifest the word of God at that time I'm telling you friends you can stand to your feet musicians you can come hmm I want you to catch this morning despite what you think of yourself you've been placed in an age as bad as laodicea fighting spirits that have been Unleashed probably that have never been Unleashed before you are a warrior of God placed in this age and all of that for such a time as this you have within you what you need to make it all the way through and and I and I I don't know how to say that anymore but that's what I want you to get this morning despite despite the worst of your enemy despite this flesh despite the flesh that you fight sometimes on one another you have what's what you need inside of you you have been placed for such a time as this amen you're you are a lovely group of people and I thank you for pulling like you did I I there's something that amazes me about the people of God is when you meet him I I've never met maybe I have come in contact with some of you most of you I think I've never met before but when we get together and we're Believers there's something that that I always feel like I've known you forever and we have really we have known each other forever You Beautiful People and and I and I like to say this because of my heart for the pastors I'll just quote it to you as we go that scripture or that quote he says you're a lovely group of people and the love of God is flowing in here but he said Satan won't let it stay that way he said he'll he'll and now none of you take this on for yourself he says if Satan can't inject something in to your midst he'll he'll inject he'll bring somebody and inject them now don't accept that for yourself now it's just so it's just a warning that you're a lovely group of people but you want to know what he says he says don't Clan up don't form clicks if something happens in the church you start praying you you join together in prayer and he says he says they'll either go out or they'll come in and be one of you that's the right way to pray but then he says and stick with your pastor because he's ordained to lead you through you say brother you're lifting up a man maybe I am a little bit not not a man it's the office that the man holds and the scripture does say they're worthy of double honor but I just say that to say you're in good hands the hands of a holy ghost-led man keep pressing on keep pressing on no matter what Satan is trying to tell you of yourself no matter what Satan is trying to do I pray this is connecting with you this morning keep pressing on you you young and old you have been placed for such a time as this you young people you grow up in things that us older ones didn't have to I remember as I went up every grade I watched the the sin go down a grade every year I went up and it's just unbelievable now what you go through but you've been placed for such a time as this you have what you need amen keep yielding keep that fervancy God bless you and thank you God bless you all turn it over brother I'm not a singer bless you really appreciate you [Applause] how we thank the Lord for the word of God today I just knew that the Lord would use our brother just to speak to our individual needs and I think we all are leaving here with something that we can take and make ourselves uh better Christians amen and I just love just a number of statements that he made um he wanted a queen that would be submissive not because she had to be seeing we can preach the gospel in such a way that we you know this is your role this is your role this is your role and I'm gonna force you into your role [Music] um I think people know what their roles are and I remember brother brother um Burley Williams coming and preaching say the key to unlock submission the key to unlocking because he says it's just it's in a a woman's nature to submit she's designed that way right to submit however but the key to unlock it is through love right and not not not to become submissive because she had to be right but because she want to be and it's a whole different feeling when a wife want to submit to her husband and just man it's a different relationship and and she gets to that spot because of how he treats her what he does for her she's always his Queen [Music] I just I just I just I was I was just blessed I was blessed today and um Satan came to touch you with that Gospel Mission when you do wrong [Music] it's the law of sin working in you it's not it's not you it's not you so don't beat yourself up that's where Satan wants to actually you did this you didn't know I didn't you anointed me with that Spirit to do that now I'm gonna repent and I'm Gonna Keep moving on because that does not that is not my nature I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God I don't think that we're gonna act that way I'm gonna repent I'm gonna tell God I'm sorry foreign Lord I'm sorry and I'm moving on I ain't gonna waddle in my my thoughts look that means Satan cannot you know look I don't care what he's done and every trap that he set for me the traps that he set for me actually he gonna fall into him himself right I'm gonna have Victory oh I just I I I was I was blessed I I I I I I I was blessed and that that scripture that they read they shall take away his Dominion so this is not you praying and asking God to give you Victory and all that Lord you're going to rise up and be a victim and you're going to take away Satan's Dominion in your life oh his time is up I I feel like he's getting the eviction notice today Satan you're out of here [Applause] he was speaking a man he said brother Nestor uh coming with us for the the first time today three minutes away you know from the church and um and maybe God had us for such a time as this going through the season of transition of change because he just wants to just bring somebody along and we realized that it wasn't just brother Nester uh but we would you know we're not just that you know when we when we were when we came here to this church and we were signing the contract and everything they were looking like uh y'all do church on Wednesday night we actually do it on Friday night too but we're trying to get y'all a break but uh Wednesday night yeah we did we'd be here and like okay because none of the other churches come on Wednesday night [Music] you do and we're gonna sign this contract we'll be here on Wednesday nights well I I don't know how but there was a young lady that must have saw us here one Wednesday night and I told her mama they had Church up there well her mama been coming for four weeks the whole month and maybe maybe we were here maybe we were here for such a time as this because we know this ain't uh this ain't our home we just pilgrims passing through but I will tell you this that's the love of God that he will take a whole church through a year of this because of one's soul [Applause] the Lord that we serve will cross a stormy sea put his disciples In Harm's Way praise God go to sleep on the back of a boat because he's trying to get to One Soul Hallelujah a man that has lost his mind I gotta get to that one man you talk about value that's God's love for one and if he'll do that for you what will he do for the rest so I tell you we just yield to the Lord whatever your will is and I agree with the prayer that was prayed yes Lord we we have submitted some things here and we would leave it under your hands but if these are not the places that you want us to be then block it if it ain't where you want us to be you know you block it if it's where you want us to be you open the door but if it's not where you want to be just block it and we'll find something else I know the God we serve is he don't it don't it don't take long it don't take much don't take a lot of negotiation don't take nothing because when it when it's your time it's your time Cincinnati uh brother Calvin encouraged our faith when it's time for them to get their house and then people say um somebody else you know that but the Lord told us that that's for us so I don't know how it's gonna happen I don't know if they plan on moving in with us but that's our house and they living there right now he told us this morning he says that the uh your faith can sway the wall so let's keep praying and let's just keep having faith in God but it sways the war father we thank you for your word on today we just appreciate you coming and speaking to our hearts what a sermon from uh brother Brandon God you sent him here all the way from Michigan press through uh the things that his wife is facing there and had to leave her back at the hotel but Lord we just we're grateful that he yield it and it came to deliver this word I pray that we would receive what the Holy Spirit had to say and that we would begin to take action with the words that we have heard God I I um uh you you bring Deliverance in just such a simple way you bring freedom in such a simple way but here this morning we heard a jubilee trumpet sounding and God we're we're determined to accept our freedom right now we no longer have to work for the devil uh father we can go back and be who you have called us to be so Lord I pray that you would just continue to bless our brother that you would strengthen him that you would touch his wife I thank you for the words of strength correction Comfort Lord Direction instruction thank you for everything you put in that sermon today to give to us father we are will be leaving this place Lord but not your presence but may we go meditating and fellowshipping around what we heard that you oh God we get Glory and Honor from our lives we love you father I want to ask that you remember Lord the Anderson fulford family they've been fighting a little sickness there in their home but God we thank you for touching them and we thank you for giving them victory in this and Lord they just desire to be back in the house of the Lord so open up a door God for them to be able to come back in touch their bodies and we just rebuke the enemy and all that he's trying to do father we thank you Father in advance for it bless your people now say prepare to leave this place but not your presence it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen let's give the Lord Jesus a hand clap of praise Hallelujah hallelujah amen you can be seated a man in the
