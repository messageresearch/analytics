[5:30] had a little trouble we got over to
[5:33] Atlanta and we were supposed to make our
[5:35] flight to LA to catch our our fight our
[5:38] flight from LA to to Sydney
[5:42] Australia and as we were on the plane
[5:45] you know they were taking their time
[5:46] about getting things
[5:48] going so the pilot told us we're going
[5:51] to have to get off the plane and go to
[5:52] another plane because this plane wasn't
[5:55] going to make it to
[5:57] La I said well prise the Lord amen you
[6:01] gave us a warning amen but getting off
[6:04] that plane and getting onto another
[6:06] plane it was going to cause us to miss
[6:09] our other plane over in La so we would
[6:11] have been stuck over in La for a little
[6:14] while so right when we got over to the
[6:17] second plane we were waiting to
[6:19] board it was right about the time that
[6:21] the brothers were having their prayer
[6:23] meeting on
[6:25] Tuesday so you know as we were over and
[6:28] me and brother Jack we hopped on the
[6:29] prayer line and it just stirred up in in
[6:33] my heart to just tell the brothers begin
[6:35] to pray that God will ground that other
[6:36] plane until we get
[6:39] there as the brothers begin to pray we
[6:42] got on the plane very swiftly when we
[6:46] met up with brother
[6:47] Diggs he said brother they already told
[6:50] us we were going to sit here till y'all
[6:51] got
[6:54] [Applause]
[6:58] here but as we got on the plane um they
[7:02] let us know that there was 13 passengers
[7:04] that were supposed to be on that plane
[7:06] going to
[7:07] Sydney so when we got to when we got to
[7:10] La they told everybody else to sit on
[7:12] that plane till we all got off the plane
[7:15] and we able to make our flight and as we
[7:17] were walking down up the little Corridor
[7:20] brother Jack said these other 11 are
[7:22] blessed because two Son of God was right
[7:24] here on this plane and they're able to
[7:26] board that flight so we want to thank
[7:29] God for his traveling
[7:31] mercies praise the
[7:33] [Applause]
[7:37] Lord so believe it or not brother de got
[7:40] over there and he was preaching about a
[7:41] time when brother
[7:44] Jack when him and sister Erica they were
[7:46] on their their flight and they were
[7:48] about to miss the plane and brother Jack
[7:49] backed up the Lord spoke to him and he
[7:52] spoke and the Lord grounded that plane
[7:54] called caused that plane to come back up
[7:57] and they were able to board that plane
[7:59] and as he was preaching I looked over at

[46:20] Saints um I don't know what happens to
[46:23] me but the older I get the
[46:26] less I want to take trips like that
[46:28] because of the distance in travel uh
[46:32] roughly 30
[46:34] hours um to to get there and and it just
[46:38] it um it wears and tears Amen on your
[46:42] body Play the song all the way all the
[46:45] way I'm going all the way you know that
[46:47] just all right there you go thank you
[46:49] sister amen it's good to see her in her
[46:52] place
[46:54] amen praise
[46:57] God but we were um you know it's just a
[47:01] challenge to the body and um and uh when
[47:05] my wife is not going with me I don't
[47:07] like to go and stay too long I just like
[47:09] to go and come on back home you know
[47:11] just be with her and the rest of the
[47:13] family uh but uh but we were able to go
[47:16] and and you know when you when I got
[47:18] there um and just start hearing the the
[47:21] stories of the people uh realizing that
[47:24] Australia is a a country where brother
[47:26] Brandon was
[47:28] denied a visa to enter the country and
[47:32] you can just imagine a first thought I
[47:34] had is who was the
[47:37] person that said
[47:40] no to the
[47:42] prophet and I don't know if they realize
[47:46] what they had done but uh a whole nation
[47:51] is impacted by uh somebody denying a
[47:55] Visa
[47:56] and uh you know so most of the churches
[47:58] there are made up of people that have
[48:00] come from uh other nations uh they come
[48:04] out of Philippines they've come out of
[48:06] um um Ghana they've come out of
[48:10] Zimbabwe uh they've come out of um the
[48:14] Samoan Islands New Zealand and these
[48:17] people are the ones that make up uh the
[48:19] churches there in Australia and uh so
[48:22] you know you you go into a situation
[48:24] like that and you realize made a
[48:26] statement I said you know they might
[48:27] have stopped the
[48:30] messenger but they couldn't stop the
[48:33] message and uh so it was good to kind of
[48:36] go in and be able to fellowship with
[48:38] some of the Believers amen uh just you
[48:41] know with um with where they were and
[48:44] just just had wonderful wonderful
[48:47] services and I was just listening to
[48:49] brother Solomon just say you know it's a
[48:51] pleasure for him to be there to
[48:53] introduce me to the the platform there
[48:55] you know and uh but and and I was just
[48:58] sitting back and just really you know my
[49:00] buttons popping off seeing brother
[49:02] Solomon up their lead and worship and uh
[49:06] the thought comes is see when we're
[49:09] faithful when we're
[49:11] faithful uh to what God has called us to
[49:13] do here in West Palm Beach then it's God
[49:16] that puts us in other places it's not us
[49:18] putting ourself there but we just remain
[49:20] faithful and we let God do what God does
[49:24] amen and he does all things well amen so
[49:28] we we were happy to just take our
[49:31] portion of what we do here and and and
[49:33] and I was listening to the song service
[49:35] this morning say boy y'all not just this
[49:37] morning last
[49:38] week y'all

[50:41] to get up and uh cut a step he you know
[50:46] just just uh somewhere between here and
[50:49] there and uh you know I preached that
[50:52] sermon over
[50:54] in uh over in Australia and I've never
[50:57] had the people respond uh like that uh I

[51:11] with that you know that's what I'm
[51:13] touching and agreeing with that and and
[51:15] I said well my God and just it was it
[51:17] was something I hadn't experienced
[51:20] before but uh I I just and you know I
[51:23] just love when people receive the word
[51:26] you know it just means so much to you
[51:28] that the word cuz you know if the word
[51:30] don't make you move the word don't make
[51:32] you shout ain't nothing else going to
[51:33] make you shout right I mean it's it's
[51:35] one thing to let the music do it but
[51:37] when the word does
[51:39] it I'm going tell you something to go a
[51:41] little
[51:42] deeper the anchor gets a a greater hole

[59:03] don't look like what I've been
[59:06] through amen
[59:11] um I want to just start by reading a
[59:13] couple quotes here the first one is
[59:16] coming out of the
[59:17] sermon I
[59:19] know amen I I know I told you sometimes
[59:25] if you would just listen to the
[59:28] title of what the prophet is preaching
[59:31] there is a
[59:34] sermon simply in the title before he
[59:38] even gets to the context the the title
[59:41] says I know I'm not hoping it's not a
[59:47] maybe am I wondering whether God going
[59:49] to come through or not no no that's not
[59:52] the that's not my position positioned
[59:55] position is I I know God going to make a
[59:58] way I I know God going to open up a door
[1:00:01] I I know I know that if God Did It
[1:00:05] Before I know he will do it again I know
[1:00:09] he's the same yesterday the day and
[1:00:11] forever I know I I know the devil is a
[1:00:15] liar I I
[1:00:19] know if he healed Me Before He'll heal
[1:00:22] me again I know know I don't look like
[1:00:25] what I've been through I I know I know
[1:00:28] the God that I serve right so so so so
[1:00:31] you know sometimes just listen to just
[1:00:33] just the title and you can get a little
[1:00:35] word I think brother Quinton this
[1:00:36] morning's praying said Lord all we need
[1:00:38] is just a word from you amen the the
[1:00:40] Centurion said just speak the word only
[1:00:43] just just give me just one word I don't
[1:00:45] need a paragraph I I don't need the
[1:00:47] whole message just give me one word out
[1:00:49] of it amen I have strength for the
[1:00:52] journey it says this in the message I
[1:00:54] know know he says sometimes we have more
[1:00:59] troubles when we become a Christian than
[1:01:02] we did when we were Sinners can you
[1:01:04] believe that you thought this was going
[1:01:07] to be a picnic when you came to God no
[1:01:10] more
[1:01:11] trouble Hallelujah I it's going to be
[1:01:14] more trouble than you ever seen before
[1:01:16] because the Bible promis you many are
[1:01:19] the
[1:01:20] afflictions right of the children got
[1:01:22] many you got to have many afflictions
[1:01:24] but it didn't stop that put a comment
[1:01:26] put a uh let me what some other uh form
[1:01:29] of um uh I can't even see it here uh I
[1:01:34] think it was a comma no no no no it's a
[1:01:37] it's a colon right it put a colon there
[1:01:39] and and and Theon says there's a little
[1:01:41] bit more to
[1:01:43] this yeah many are the
[1:01:46] afflictions
[1:01:49] but oh I love this church but the Lord
[1:01:52] deliver them out of some of
[1:01:55] them most of them no that ain't what
[1:01:58] David said he's say the Lord going to
[1:02:01] deliver you out of all of them whatever
[1:02:04] you are facing right now God is going to
[1:02:07] deliver
[1:02:10] you I know
[1:02:13] that yes I know that I'm not it's not a
[1:02:17] hope it's not a maybe I know God going
[1:02:19] to make a way
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:23] somehow yes sir
[1:02:26] glory to
[1:02:28] God Amen here he says that sometimes we
[1:02:31] have more troubles when we become a
[1:02:34] Christian than we did when we were
[1:02:36] Sinners of course the prophet says it's
[1:02:39] written many is the afflictions of the
[1:02:42] righteous but God
[1:02:54] not only that strange feelings you going
[1:02:58] to have many of them many afflictions
[1:03:01] and many strange feelings strange things
[1:03:06] that would be beyond our understanding
[1:03:09] come on somebody but it's always done
[1:03:11] for our
[1:03:13] good hallu we just can't understand it
[1:03:17] because if we did then it would not be
[1:03:20] Faith to us glory to God Amen he would
[1:03:25] go uh we would go with an understanding
[1:03:27] but we do it and we have it and we
[1:03:29] believe by faith is work then it's going
[1:03:31] to work some good thing for us if we
[1:03:34] could grasp that today on this morning
[1:03:37] if we could grasp that all of our
[1:03:39] troubles and there is none of us immune
[1:03:42] from them right but if we and if we can
[1:03:45] realize that those things are for our
[1:03:48] good I think Paul says all things work
[1:03:52] together for our good amen because
[1:03:54] because we love God and we're called
[1:03:56] according to his purpose didn't mean
[1:03:57] it's going to feel good but it's going
[1:03:59] to work together for our good all right
[1:04:02] all right all right let's go into this
[1:04:04] next one out of Shalom am man the
[1:04:06] message Shalom there again another uh uh
[1:04:10] uh sermon in the title Shalom

[1:04:32] peace in the midst of your storm amen
[1:04:36] amen here in the message Shalom he says
[1:04:38] this many people ask why they ask
[1:04:42] somebody asked me why must these things
[1:04:46] happen Glory why did this happen to me
[1:04:52] why did I start
[1:04:55] and this happened glory to God and I had
[1:04:59] this trouble here and this upset me here
[1:05:03] and I lost this here sometimes I ask why
[1:05:09] why when I was just a young Minister and
[1:05:12] first started out did God take my wife
[1:05:14] right out from under me take my baby
[1:05:17] right from beneath me right beneath my
[1:05:21] heart now one of I'm going to tell you
[1:05:23] one of the things about brother brandom
[1:05:24] especially with his baby been taken from
[1:05:26] him when she died amen uh brother
[1:05:29] Brandon said when went to see her she
[1:05:30] had cross eyes yeah and uh and when he
[1:05:33] looked at her with those cross eyes it
[1:05:35] caused the prophet to have a certain
[1:05:37] feeling for other little children amen
[1:05:40] when he see him come through the prayer
[1:05:41] line with Crosse eyes and when when when
[1:05:43] we reach that sermon somewhere between
[1:05:45] here and there the one boy had he was
[1:05:47] crossy on that side of the platform but
[1:05:50] when he got to the other side he was no
[1:05:52] longer crossy and brother brandham never
[1:05:55] prayed for the
[1:05:57] boy that's right amen it was just a
[1:06:00] feeling that he had amen and and just
[1:06:03] just just whatever that he had gave him
[1:06:06] power over the cross side without even
[1:06:08] praying for him
[1:06:12] am yes sir Hallelujah I was telling him
[1:06:15] the testimony how brother digs received
[1:06:17] his eyesight in okobe come on at Golden
[1:06:22] Corral Hallelujah brother brother smil
[1:06:24] say if you want it brother if you want
[1:06:25] something to eat you got you better get
[1:06:27] up and go get it yourself and without
[1:06:29] prayer come on Amen it was the faith
[1:06:32] that rose up to say I am going to go get
[1:06:35] my food his eyes popped open he started
[1:06:38] eating he start driving and he been
[1:06:40] traveling the world ever since but we
[1:06:43] see what God did for brother
[1:06:46] DS right here in our state we seen it
[1:06:49] happen with our own eyes Hallelujah see
[1:06:52] so you know here's the thing we we we uh
[1:06:54] uh uh you know brother brandom had this
[1:06:56] uh you know just I said like this
[1:06:58] because of what he went through it gave
[1:07:00] him a certain sympathy amen or empathy
[1:07:03] for others and what you are going
[1:07:05] through gives you an empathy for other
[1:07:08] people I'm going say something here that
[1:07:10] that that I I I feel is necessary it's
[1:07:14] bad it's really bad that uh sometimes
[1:07:19] people don't know how to handle
[1:07:21] information and what make it bad is that
[1:07:23] sometimes s there's somebody that can
[1:07:25] help you they actually want to share
[1:07:28] their story with you but they worri how
[1:07:30] you going to handle the
[1:07:33] information how you what you going to do
[1:07:35] with this
[1:07:36] information
[1:07:37] oh sometime you get a little information
[1:07:40] and you feel like that justify you to do
[1:07:43] something the the information is not to
[1:07:46] justify you the information is to try to
[1:07:48] set you free come on
[1:07:51] somebody glory to God Amen but but
[1:07:54] sometime people have to reserve what
[1:07:55] they going to say because they watching
[1:07:57] how you going to handle
[1:07:59] it if I share this with you you going to
[1:08:01] be sharing this with everybody else oh
[1:08:03] well sister so and so told me I didn't I
[1:08:05] didn't tell you that for you to go
[1:08:07] telling everybody else I told you that
[1:08:10] to help
[1:08:12] you how is that going to help
[1:08:15] them come on somebody praise the Lord so
[1:08:19] so so it's a shame that we can't even
[1:08:21] just be ourselves with one another amen
[1:08:24] amen all right let me keep reading it
[1:08:28] says
[1:08:29] um God take my uh my heart why did he do
[1:08:32] that I I didn't know I I do now it says
[1:08:37] I just held my hand in his and kept trus
[1:08:40] him he knows every Junction he knows the
[1:08:44] Rhythm when it must take place he knows
[1:08:48] what it takes to mold you glory to God
[1:08:52] Amen he knows what kind of material he's
[1:08:55] going to use see the back side of the
[1:08:58] desert sometimes where God mows
[1:09:01] righteous men into sages and Prophets
[1:09:04] see that's where men are beat out men
[1:09:08] are beat out in the word when they got
[1:09:11] all kind of creed and stuff in them let
[1:09:14] them come to the word and God beats it
[1:09:17] right out of them MOS it right into the
[1:09:20] great Symphony of his word and then they
[1:09:23] see the word word moving on I I like
[1:09:25] that I like that uh you know people will
[1:09:28] see the word moving on I can tell you
[1:09:30] that right now uh I i' I've seen it I'm
[1:09:32] going to keep reading this quote but
[1:09:33] I've seen it just happen where people
[1:09:35] you know you leave for a season amen and
[1:09:38] uh you know whatever the devil's done to
[1:09:39] try to trip somebody up but it happens
[1:09:41] we all get tripped up along the way
[1:09:43] sometime but uh but but but what happens
[1:09:45] that if the church is moving according
[1:09:47] to the word you're going to find the
[1:09:48] church doing the same thing when you
[1:09:51] come back and find your place cuz the
[1:09:53] church is moving according to the word
[1:09:55] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen he
[1:09:58] goes and says God knows when the rhythm
[1:10:01] of it has got to change he knows how the
[1:10:04] Rhythm goes I don't know how it goes but
[1:10:07] he knows he knows how it goes I don't
[1:10:10] but I look at here and I say well it's
[1:10:12] just coming many are the afflictions of
[1:10:15] the righteous but God deliver him out of
[1:10:18] them all God has moved through history
[1:10:20] with the rhythm of the promise of his
[1:10:22] word and each age in the same Rhythm
[1:10:25] making his word that's how God moved
[1:10:27] down through history from all the way
[1:10:29] from Genesis to Revelation he has moved
[1:10:32] through history with his word that's
[1:10:34] right with the rhythm of the power of
[1:10:36] the Holy Spirit vindicating his word to
[1:10:38] the elected remember he's never been
[1:10:40] able to touch the touch outside the
[1:10:42] church it's only the elected now I
[1:10:46] there's a there's a there's a there
[1:10:48] that's a powerful
[1:10:50] statement and I want to go back and just
[1:10:52] pick up this scripture out of Psalms 34
[1:10:55] just for a little bit because there are
[1:10:57] certain things that's only to the
[1:10:58] elected now let's let's start at verse
[1:11:00] one I just want to read a couple verses
[1:11:02] from verse one uh and then we'll move
[1:11:04] forward here in Psalms 34 it says this
[1:11:08] Hallelujah I Will Bless The Lord at all
[1:11:13] times that that that don't mean when I'm
[1:11:16] feeling great come on only when I feel
[1:11:19] good only when I'm on the mountain top
[1:11:20] am I going to give God praise no no no
[1:11:24] no no when you in the valley low bless
[1:11:27] the Lord praise God yes sir amen
[1:11:32] hallelujah your bills behind praise
[1:11:34] him actually while you praise him your
[1:11:36] bill might get caught
[1:11:37] [Applause]
[1:11:40] up Lord you got to have a determination
[1:11:43] I Will Bless The
[1:11:46] Lord at all times then David says his
[1:11:50] praise look at this shall
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:55] continually be in my mouth I ain't going
[1:11:57] to stop and complain I'm going to just
[1:11:58] keep giving God praise many of the
[1:12:00] afflictions are the Righteous but the
[1:12:01] Lord deliver them all I don't know I
[1:12:04] don't know how I'm going to come through
[1:12:05] but God you going to make a way I know
[1:12:06] you will father I Praise You Lord I I
[1:12:09] give you glory not for what you will do
[1:12:12] but what you already done you proved it
[1:12:14] to me before I know you'll do it
[1:12:17] again hey you can stop and look at
[1:12:19] yourself you know he's brought you out
[1:12:22] before I don't look like what I've gone
[1:12:26] through and after this trial I still
[1:12:29] won't look like what I've gone
[1:12:33] through Hallelujah
[1:12:36] [Applause]
[1:12:39] somebody his praise shall continually be
[1:12:43] in my
[1:12:44] mouth my soul shall make a boast in the
[1:12:49] Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and
[1:12:52] be glad I love David's
[1:12:56] writings
[1:12:58] oh anybody come to church this morning
[1:13:00] to do this oh magnify the Lord with me
[1:13:05] and let us exalt his name
[1:13:08] together I sought the Lord and he heard
[1:13:11] me and delivered me from all my fears
[1:13:13] they looked unto him and were light and
[1:13:15] their faces were not
[1:13:18] ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord
[1:13:21] heard him and saved him out of all his
[1:13:23] troubles now watch this verse the angel
[1:13:26] of the Lord encampeth round about them
[1:13:29] that fear Him and deliver them now I'm
[1:13:31] going to get a little deeper into this
[1:13:33] in um in our Bible study in a few weeks
[1:13:35] but I want to just drop this off when
[1:13:37] brother brandom just said this quote and
[1:13:39] he says it's never been able to touch
[1:13:40] outside the church it's only the
[1:13:43] elected this is important because in
[1:13:46] this verse amen you know how people
[1:13:49] always talk about uh uh uh everybody got
[1:13:51] a guardian angel uhuh
[1:13:55] according to this verse not
[1:13:59] everybody
[1:14:01] amen not everybody got a a guarden
[1:14:04] angel you you want to know who got the
[1:14:07] guarden angel read the scripture the
[1:14:10] angel of the Lord Guardian Angel
[1:14:13] encampeth round about them that fear him
[1:14:17] so you got to have some fear for God sir
[1:14:20] you got to be elected you got to be pred
[1:14:23] at in order to have a guardien angel you
[1:14:26] got to have all of
[1:14:28] that hallah glory to God Amen he said it
[1:14:32] goes on to say that fear Him and and
[1:14:34] deliver them so it's only the angel are
[1:14:36] only encamp those that fear
[1:14:39] God oh yes yes yes it's the truth verse
[1:14:42] eight says oh taste and see that the
[1:14:46] Lord is good blessed is the man that
[1:14:50] trusteth in
[1:14:52] him let's move on from there here in
[1:14:55] Luke 21:19 the Bible also says in your
[1:14:59] patience possess ye your souls in your
[1:15:02] patience possess ye your souls now I was
[1:15:05] just kind of looking at a few statements
[1:15:07] there in statute of a perfect man and
[1:15:09] brother brandom made a statement about
[1:15:10] patience says God tries your
[1:15:13] patience God tries it right and and uh
[1:15:16] and and he said that's that's right God
[1:15:18] trying and he used the example of Noah
[1:15:20] how he was patiently waiting on God
[1:15:22] after 120 years waiting for the rain to
[1:15:25] come and preaching for all this time and
[1:15:27] finally gets inside the boat and the and
[1:15:29] the and and the um uh uh the animals
[1:15:32] come from all over the place and they
[1:15:33] come into the boat and and then God
[1:15:35] seals the door and while he's inside the
[1:15:37] boat when God tries his patience his
[1:15:39] wife comes to Noah the wife comes to no
[1:15:42] say are you sure God told you to do this
[1:15:44] now wait a minute dear didn't you see
[1:15:46] the animals like I saw the animals
[1:15:48] didn't you see God close the door like I
[1:15:50] saw God close the door why would you
[1:15:52] question whether this was with God or
[1:15:53] not I don't I don't care how long we've
[1:15:55] been waiting on this rain to come just
[1:15:57] stay inside the boat yes sir man that's
[1:16:00] another that's another sermon that I
[1:16:02] have in my heart amen Miracles that
[1:16:04] happen in the boat but you got to be in
[1:16:07] the boat in order to experience a
[1:16:09] miracle that's another sermon for
[1:16:11] another day but but but here you know
[1:16:14] Noah I mean Noah's wife is is coming and
[1:16:17] when when Noah's wife come that is God
[1:16:19] trying Noah's
[1:16:22] patience glory to God brother brandom uh
[1:16:25] made another statement in that same
[1:16:26] sermon statue of perent says when you
[1:16:28] done exactly what he said do and it
[1:16:33] seemed like it went wrong still be
[1:16:37] patient stand still and be patient when
[1:16:40] you done everything you thought the Lord

[1:17:21] through all right right uh acts 14 and
[1:17:24] 19 verse 19 and 20 in Acts 14 it says
[1:17:28] this and there came thether certain Jews

[1:20:35] there I think uh uh um acts 23 and and
[1:20:38] 12 what is the next the next verse uh
[1:20:41] gives us just a little something that
[1:20:43] Paul is going through it says and when
[1:20:45] it was day certain of the Jews banded
[1:20:48] together and bound themselves under a
[1:20:50] curse saying that they would neither eat
[1:20:52] e nor drink till they had killed Paul
[1:20:56] now here the angel of the Lord said
[1:20:57] you're going to Rome but there's a group
[1:20:59] of people that have banded together we
[1:21:01] won't we going to
[1:21:03] fast until Paul is
[1:21:06] dead I I can just tell you right now if
[1:21:08] the angel of Lord say he going to Rome
[1:21:10] your fasting ain't going to stop Paul
[1:21:13] from going to Rome your agreement to
[1:21:16] kill Paul will not stop Paul from
[1:21:18] getting to Rome I don't care who is
[1:21:20] coming to agreement to try to stop you
[1:21:23] from receiving what God has for

[1:21:49] Paul amen is told by the angel of the
[1:21:52] Lord that he is going to Rome even
[1:21:55] though now these Jews abandoned and say
[1:21:56] they're going to kill him that couldn't
[1:21:58] stop Paul from making it to Rome if we
[1:22:00] were to go on and read in Acts 24 uh he
[1:22:03] was taken to a leader by the name of
[1:22:05] Felix and Felix prolonged Paul's
[1:22:08] judgment for two years and hope that
[1:22:10] Paul would give him money to buy his
[1:22:13] freedom my God trying to bride Paul
[1:22:15] glory to God uh but Paul waited right
[1:22:17] there in the prison knowing that he was
[1:22:19] still going to Rome this is two years
[1:22:20] later acts 25 uh Paul stood before fesus
[1:22:25] who had replaced Felix and appealed to
[1:22:27] stand before Caesar because he
[1:22:29] remembered the prophecy that he was to
[1:22:31] Bear witness in
[1:22:33] Rome hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:37] amen also we find in in Scripture that
[1:22:40] Paul stood before King Agrippa and he
[1:22:43] began to give his personal testimony of
[1:22:46] how he was converted I love amen I love
[1:22:49] the way Paul did this because as he was
[1:22:51] giv his personal testimony AG gria say
[1:22:54] you almost persuade me to become a
[1:22:58] Christian now I want you to understand
[1:23:00] Paul was a man that wrote two-thirds of
[1:23:02] the New Testament and Paul never used
[1:23:06] Mysteries to try to persuade amen uh
[1:23:09] king of grippa Paul used his personal
[1:23:12] testimony of what God had done in his

[1:29:08] but Paul is going through these things
[1:29:10] and amen and and and we find uh uh in in
[1:29:14] Acts 27 before he makes it to
[1:29:18] Rome he got hit with a tempestuous wind
[1:29:22] the Bible called the Bible named the
[1:29:24] storm eurocin this was a
[1:29:27] hurricane now it's one thing to get here
[1:29:30] with a hurricane and your on land and
[1:29:34] you got your windows all boarded up and
[1:29:36] and all these other things it's one
[1:29:37] thing to get struck by a hurricane on
[1:29:39] land but when you are in the
[1:29:43] ocean come on and you at you at the uh
[1:29:46] you you at the mercy of the water right
[1:29:49] you in the middle of an ocean and a
[1:29:50] hurricane comes
[1:29:54] true and still God tell you be of good
[1:29:59] cheer in the midst of a hurricane on the
[1:30:02] ocean now that that that's a different
[1:30:04] story but yet Paul has a amen a
[1:30:06] confidence that I know I'm going to make
[1:30:08] it to Rome no matter what hits me out
[1:30:11] here on this seat I don't know how I'm
[1:30:13] going get to Rome but I'mma make it to
[1:30:15] Rome if God got to bring a wh like he
[1:30:19] did Jonah I am way to
[1:30:28] roll while Paul was on the ship yly and
[1:30:32] H him Paul was encouraged by the angel
[1:30:33] of Lord to you know just don't worry
[1:30:35] you're going to make it through this and
[1:30:36] he says and everyone that's on the ship
[1:30:39] I've given
[1:30:41] you they was threatening to kill all the
[1:30:44] soldiers and and some of them was trying
[1:30:46] to get out the ship get on the little
[1:30:48] small ships to try to go Paul said no no
[1:30:49] no no don't do don't do that you better
[1:30:51] stay on the boat he says everybody
[1:30:52] that's on this ship God going to give
[1:30:55] them to me uhhuh and so y'all don't
[1:30:57] worry about it God got we got this thing
[1:30:59] under control and everybody got a piece
[1:31:01] at least the the the soldiers got a
[1:31:03] piece because Paul was on the boat right
[1:31:06] and Paul was the one with the promise
[1:31:08] that he's going to Rome so Paul has to
[1:31:11] amen the ship becomes Shipwrecked
[1:31:13] through the you know through through
[1:31:14] what we read in the scripture and and I
[1:31:16] like I love the pl the the the little

[1:31:22] now I know a shipwreck and y'all that
[1:31:24] can swim swim on up to the
[1:31:27] shore so but if you can't
[1:31:29] swim grab a hold of some of the floating
[1:31:35] woods and see brother wco first sermon
[1:31:38] that he ever preached is you can make it
[1:31:41] on broken
[1:31:43] pieces so if you can't swim just grab
[1:31:46] one of the broken pieces of the ship and
[1:31:49] just swim on up you might not have strip
[1:31:52] to make those Strokes yourself but grab
[1:31:54] a hold of the boats and you can make it
[1:31:57] on broken
[1:31:59] pieces

[1:35:52] some
[1:35:53] way and I know
[1:35:57] that
[1:35:59] amen amen thank you Lord here in this
[1:36:03] message God called man brother
[1:36:06] brandom makes a statement it
[1:36:09] says God has to get a man away from the
[1:36:13] things of the
[1:36:15] world so he can get him quiet can I just
[1:36:20] can I amen just
[1:36:28] uh this is
[1:36:31] important don't when when when you know
[1:36:34] even when you're going through a trial
[1:36:36] don't don't be so figy right right and
[1:36:39] talking
[1:36:41] and no be quiet be
[1:36:46] still be be very still see the devil
[1:36:50] want you talking so much much that you
[1:36:51] actually miss
[1:36:53] God that's right you know and and Elijah
[1:36:57] heard a still Small Voice right and God
[1:37:01] comeing very he comes quietly and and
[1:37:03] you got to be quiet to be able to hear
[1:37:04] him sometimes just too much noise going
[1:37:06] on and you got to get away somewhere
[1:37:09] quiet where you can really hear the
[1:37:11] voice of God hello somebody not just the
[1:37:14] voice of some brother some sister you
[1:37:15] need to hear the voice of God not even
[1:37:18] just the voice of the pastor you need to
[1:37:20] truly hear the voice of
[1:37:23] God again amen and then when you sit
[1:37:26] down and talk with the pastor most
[1:37:27] likely you get a confirmation that you
[1:37:29] heard the voice of God cuz if Pastor
[1:37:32] saying something different uh-uh
[1:37:33] somebody ain't speaking right here and
[1:37:36] especially the pastor give you the
[1:37:39] Bible Hallelujah so when God speaking he
[1:37:42] got to always take you back to his word
[1:37:44] and you just got to wait on it sometime
[1:37:47] you got to be patient and wait God is
[1:37:49] not a microwave God
[1:37:52] the Bible say in patience do you possess
[1:37:55] your souls so you got to learn how to
[1:37:57] just wait in patience sometime it might
[1:37:59] take a year it might take two years if
[1:38:02] you're like Abraham it'll take 25 years
[1:38:06] now let me let me ask you question while
[1:38:08] Abraham was waiting what was he
[1:38:12] doing he was
[1:38:15] continually amen he he was giving God
[1:38:17] praise continually while he was waiting
[1:38:20] he was praising yes while you're waiting
[1:38:22] I'm giving you
[1:38:23] advice I'm G don't well Lord I've been
[1:38:26] waiting on you for how I don't know how
[1:38:27] long you ain't said nothing yeah you
[1:38:30] ain't going to get nothing with that
[1:38:32] attitude that's sir y'all we got to stop
[1:38:36] putting God on our
[1:38:37] level no he is God he's the one in
[1:38:41] control we're not in control he's the
[1:38:44] one that's in control he the one that
[1:38:46] made it all so we don't put them on our
[1:38:48] level you ain't did this you ain't now
[1:38:50] every time you make make a decision
[1:38:51] while you waiting that's against the
[1:38:53] decision that God wants you to do you
[1:38:55] just going to have to wait a little bit
[1:38:59] longer some of y'all didn't experience
[1:39:01] that but you learn how to just wait on
[1:39:03] the Lord be patient stand
[1:39:07] still get
[1:39:17] quiet where am
[1:39:20] I
[1:39:21] 44 God has to get a man away from the
[1:39:24] things of the world so he can get him
[1:39:28] quiet so he
[1:39:31] can talk to
[1:39:33] God no sometime you I'm going tell you
[1:39:36] sometime in prayer you want to know one
[1:39:39] of the most sweetest times in prayer is
[1:39:41] when you
[1:39:45] stop stop just to listen I mean sit
[1:39:49] there don't move to you hear something
[1:39:51] to hear God speak to you just stop and
[1:39:54] listen not talking all the time listen
[1:39:58] amen he can get him get him quiet so he
[1:40:01] can listen to God that still Small Voice
[1:40:06] then once in contact with God he becomes
[1:40:09] Fearless then notice that he don't care
[1:40:11] what anyone says he's been in the
[1:40:13] presence of God he knows God in the
[1:40:16] power of his
[1:40:18] resurrection praise the Lord
[1:40:21] amen um there's different ones that we
[1:40:25] can look at in
[1:40:26] scripture and after the trial I mean
[1:40:29] they faced tremendous trials but after
[1:40:31] God brought them through quickly you can
[1:40:34] say man that guy don't look like what he
[1:40:37] went
[1:40:38] through Daniel was one of those people I
[1:40:40] mean Lions
[1:40:43] then brother you inside I mean the Lions
[1:40:46] ain't been fed for days not one lion
[1:40:49] lions
[1:40:52] many of them ain't been fed for days no
[1:40:55] meat this man comes in as fresh
[1:41:01] meat fresh meat and somehow the Lions
[1:41:06] decide to go on a
[1:41:09] fast how does this happen but before he
[1:41:13] went in the the the king told say Daniel
[1:41:16] don't worry yes
[1:41:19] sir a unbelie Bel right right well
[1:41:23] actually they secret Believers but this
[1:41:26] man said don't worry Daniel you're God
[1:41:30] sir amen I I tried to set you free I
[1:41:33] tried to deliver you I tried to change
[1:41:35] the law Daniel but I couldn't but your
[1:41:38] God will deliver you
[1:41:42] Daniel and I can just imagine Daniel
[1:41:44] looking at the king and
[1:41:49] saying
[1:41:51] y'all going to help me preach
[1:41:53] tonight I know he going to deliver me I
[1:41:57] don't know how but I know he going to
[1:41:59] bring me
[1:42:01] out goes on in that Lions then with
[1:42:04] peace and and and and and and and and by
[1:42:07] him going in God sent an angel which was
[1:42:10] a pillar of fire inside the Lion's Den
[1:42:13] the lions are afraid of the fire so it
[1:42:16] kept the lions at Bay and lion I mean
[1:42:19] here the Lions laying there and D just
[1:42:21] laying there praying and and thanking
[1:42:22] God I'm sure he got a good sleep that
[1:42:26] night early the sunrise the king running
[1:42:30] down to am man this cave like and just
[1:42:32] screaming Daniel name Daniel D like oh
[1:42:35] shaking himself from sleep yes sir uh
[1:42:38] uhh uh King what you need Daniel you
[1:42:41] okay oh yeah yeah I'm good I'm good it's
[1:42:43] it's all
[1:42:45] good Dam you mean the Lions the Lions
[1:42:47] didn't do nothing the Lord sent his
[1:42:49] angel in here and and and God took care
[1:42:51] of everything I'm I'm good get him out
[1:42:53] of there get him out of there right now

[1:42:57] looked at Dan man you don't look
[1:43:03] like you don't look nothing
[1:43:06] like what you just been
[1:43:11] through and they knew the lions were
[1:43:13] hungry so them same fellas that was
[1:43:17] scheming them same fellas that was
[1:43:20] plotting

[1:43:31] yourself come on somebody so he say say
[1:43:34] we say all them fell that came up with
[1:43:36] this thing against Daniel take them and
[1:43:38] their families and throw them in the
[1:43:39] Lion's Den now the lion see if they
[1:43:41] would ate one man they wouldn't have
[1:43:44] been able to have a smokers
[1:43:48] board God brought Daniel through that he
[1:43:50] didn't look like what he went through

[1:47:04] reading here in this he says like I
[1:47:06] heard the story of the Shepherd in
[1:47:07] Jerusalem who had broke his sheep's
[1:47:11] leg they said why you you Cru
[1:47:15] Shepherd why did you break the Sheep's
[1:47:17] leg said well she didn't act like she
[1:47:20] loved me so I thought I'd just break her
[1:47:24] leg so I could I have to give her some
[1:47:27] special attention and then she loved me
[1:47:30] from then on sometimes God has to lay
[1:47:33] you on your back with a sickness that
[1:47:35] the doctor says you're going to die God
[1:47:39] give you God could give you a little
[1:47:41] special treatment so you'll love him a
[1:47:43] little more that's right some through
[1:47:45] the waters some through the flood some
[1:47:49] through deep trials
[1:47:51] but all through the blood Jesus leads
[1:47:54] his church you know another person in in
[1:47:58] Scripture that we could look at amen
[1:48:01] there there there there's a few of them
[1:48:06] um we know about the Hebrew
[1:48:08] boys when you know all three of them
[1:48:11] being thrown in a fire and uh and as
[1:48:14] they're going through this tremendous
[1:48:15] trial and again it's not going to the
[1:48:17] trial but it's going through the trial
[1:48:20] it wouldn't mean that much to us if they
[1:48:23] would have told us they almost got
[1:48:26] burned no no no no no no what meant a
[1:48:29] lot to like say what they got thrown in
[1:48:31] the fire and then the scripture records
[1:48:33] that as the as as as as Nebuchadnezzar
[1:48:36] got his strongest men right to throw
[1:48:38] them bind them and throw them in fire
[1:48:40] the strong men died right but the Hebrew
[1:48:43] boys was walking through the fire how
[1:48:46] somehow they we threw them in tied up
[1:48:48] but now they've been loosed and and and
[1:48:51] can I you know they was in the fire
[1:48:54] hands
[1:49:00] up I mean just they weren't in there
[1:49:03] complaining they were they were in the
[1:49:04] fire rejoicing amen and even even even
[1:49:08] even uh the king like now wait a minute
[1:49:11] I'm looking at this how many guys did we
[1:49:13] throw in the fire I I know I can count
[1:49:16] at least to to to three or four I ain't
[1:49:19] that but I I'm I I mean I I know I can
[1:49:22] count that far we threw three in who's
[1:49:25] the fourth
[1:49:26] one and he look like the Son of God how
[1:49:31] did the king of I mean the
[1:49:33] Nebuchadnezzar even know what the Son of
[1:49:34] God look
[1:49:36] like but he looked like the Son of God
[1:49:40] hallelujah sometime and and and and I
[1:49:43] want I'm sure that the Hebrew boys saw
[1:49:45] him in there too but if they didn't see
[1:49:47] him sometime other people can see
[1:49:52] that there's somebody with you that you
[1:49:54] don't even see
[1:49:55] [Applause]
[1:49:59] yourself they they can see your strength
[1:50:02] and they want to it's not it's not even
[1:50:04] humanly possible to have the strength
[1:50:07] that you got it's not even humanly
[1:50:09] possible to have the resolve that you
[1:50:11] got and that's why you can look people
[1:50:13] in their eye I don't look
[1:50:17] like what I've been through and I don't
[1:50:20] look like what I'm going
[1:50:25] through he promised never to leave you
[1:50:29] nor forsake
[1:50:31] you that's that's his promise them
[1:50:33] Hebrew boys sitting there just rejoicing
[1:50:35] like I don't know what and here's the
[1:50:38] thing when they come out the fire you
[1:50:41] couldn't smell smoke on them Lord they
[1:50:44] clothes didn't look
[1:50:45] burned feet didn't look I mean and I
[1:50:49] mean like what
[1:50:52] the testimony probably went all around
[1:50:54] the provinces sir these boys made it
[1:50:57] through the fire not just not just the
[1:50:59] fire we heated it seven times harder
[1:51:02] than it had ever been yeah but these
[1:51:04] boys don't look like what we just sent
[1:51:06] them
[1:51:07] through what something about when God is
[1:51:09] with you in the midst of whatever you're
[1:51:11] going
[1:51:12] through he gives you he gives you Grace
[1:51:14] to be able to withstand
[1:51:16] it I think about John
[1:51:22] John was put on the aisle of
[1:51:25] patmas uh I mean he this man just
[1:51:28] punished for all kind of things but
[1:51:29] before he went to the AIS of patmas they

[1:53:04] boiling grease not just thrown into it

[1:54:13] people I
[1:54:15] know I don't look
[1:54:18] like yeah
[1:54:20] amen amen what I just been
[1:54:24] through then they take him and isolate
[1:54:26] him on patmas amongst the snakes and
[1:54:29] everything else and while he's over
[1:54:31] there on patmas get caught up in the
[1:54:33] spirit on the Lord's
[1:54:35] day and writes the entire Book of
[1:54:39] Revelations I I got some things I can
[1:54:41] say that John John John John was a man
[1:54:44] that walked with the Lord
[1:54:46] Jesus but
[1:54:48] why
[1:54:50] that John gets so mixed up that in
[1:54:55] Revelation 19 and 22 John bowed down
[1:55:00] before the angel that was showing him
[1:55:03] what was in the Book of Revelation he
[1:55:05] walk with
[1:55:07] Jesus how could John get that
[1:55:15] confused
[1:55:17] right I'm I'm just I'm just saying these
[1:55:19] things now if John who wrote the Bible
[1:55:25] can be that confused and you going to
[1:55:28] sit here and tell me God didn't send a
[1:55:33] prophet what John Saw made John want to
[1:55:37] worship that's right and the prophet had
[1:55:39] to tell him now I know I know it's a
[1:55:42] prophet because he say he say don't
[1:55:43] don't worship me John like that because
[1:55:45] I'm of your fellow servants the prophets
[1:55:47] right that's what the Bible and John
[1:55:48] John John he said said no no no no no
[1:55:50] don't do that John don't worship me
[1:55:52] worship God Amen come on somebody and we
[1:55:56] had a prophet in this day that would not
[1:56:00] receive worship from any man he wanted
[1:56:03] to come off the field because the people
[1:56:05] would doing those things so we got a pro
[1:56:07] no I'm going say it like this we don't
[1:56:10] just have a prophet we have the same
[1:56:12] Prophet that John was trying to worship
[1:56:15] that's the
[1:56:17] truth am amen he was just a future
[1:56:21] prophet in John's day God is not just a
[1:56:24] god of the past God is a god of present
[1:56:27] tense and God of future tense so the
[1:56:29] angel that John was trying to worship is
[1:56:32] the same angel that revealed all the
[1:56:34] Book of
[1:56:35] Revelations to
[1:56:38] us oh
[1:56:42] glory amen we might as well just let the
[1:56:46] people know the truth yes sir than all
[1:56:49] right I'm going
[1:56:52] on John come out that boiling
[1:56:56] grease with a testimony I don't look
[1:56:59] like what I just went through and and
[1:57:03] see it's not me I can let me just put it
[1:57:05] up it's not me that gives me that
[1:57:07] preserves that
[1:57:09] look this ain't nothing but the grace of
[1:57:11] God
[1:57:12] right here in the message of seven
[1:57:15] Church agents brother brandom
[1:57:18] says
[1:57:23] um John his Destiny was met like this
[1:57:27] was caught and boiled in a vat of grease
[1:57:30] for 24
[1:57:32] hours of hot boiling grease and without
[1:57:35] any harm coming to him and they put him
[1:57:38] on the owl as commonly believed as a
[1:57:41] witch he Bewitched the grease so it
[1:57:43] wouldn't burn him it said of course it
[1:57:46] was the power of
[1:57:48] God he says uh you can't boil the Holy
[1:57:51] Spirit out of a
[1:57:54] man well so they tried to boil it out of
[1:57:56] him but God wouldn't permit it and he
[1:57:59] had a work for him to do and until God
[1:58:02] was finished with his
[1:58:04] man there's nothing in the world can
[1:58:08] bother
[1:58:10] him that's all says now John being old
[1:58:14] that they are told by uh historians that
[1:58:17] he was brought to the church to preach
[1:58:20] and he was so old the only thing he
[1:58:22] would say was little
[1:58:25] children love one another I tell you
[1:58:29] that's a very good thing to preach on
[1:58:32] little children love one another as I
[1:58:36] get older in the ministry now about in
[1:58:40] my 21st year I think all the time as I
[1:58:43] go along that this the more I think of
[1:58:45] the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find
[1:58:47] out that love
[1:58:50] is
[1:58:51] love that covers the whole thing the
[1:58:55] love of God shed abroad in our heart by
[1:58:59] the holy
[1:59:00] spirit amen amen all right uh I got a
[1:59:06] couple more things that I want to just
[1:59:08] share and I'm going to um depart you
[1:59:12] know I was thinking on
[1:59:17] um thinking on brother brother
[1:59:20] Leon and brother Leighton was dead for
[1:59:23] seven
[1:59:24] minutes in um at at Raptor and Faith
[1:59:28] Tabernacle we had meetings and brother
[1:59:30] Leon dropped dead right there in the
[1:59:32] middle of services they prayed for him
[1:59:35] brother Billy Paul was there at those
[1:59:36] meetings amen uh they prayed for him and
[1:59:39] the Lord restored brother Leon back to
[1:59:41] life and we saw brother Leon come from
[1:59:44] the back room with no pulse back into
[1:59:48] the service of the Lord with his hands
[1:59:51] lifted and and we've gone back and forth
[1:59:54] to uh brother Nathan's Church brother
[1:59:56] Lon up there leading prayer request or
[1:59:59] whatever and we look at the
[2:00:02] man he don't look
[2:00:06] like what he went
[2:00:08] through
[2:00:10] Lazarus he don't look
[2:00:13] like what he went through even our lord
[2:00:17] Jesus was in the grave for 3 Days come
[2:00:20] on somebody and and and and what they
[2:00:23] told us that see the reason he had to
[2:00:24] come up before the 72 hours is that
[2:00:27] because they say the nose begin to sink
[2:00:30] in and uh all these things begin to
[2:00:32] happen to the body the body's just
[2:00:34] breaking down breaking down breaking
[2:00:35] down breaking down but even that process
[2:00:38] of breaking down had to come to a
[2:00:40] halt because there was there was a word
[2:00:43] spoken that within three days that he
[2:00:45] would rise again and my god when Jesus
[2:00:48] got up from the grave the disciples can
[2:00:52] look at him the the the the the the the
[2:00:55] leaders of the city all of them can look
[2:00:57] at man you don't look like what you just
[2:01:00] went through the only thing he brought
[2:01:02] back to show that what he went through
[2:01:04] was some nail scars in his hands and in
[2:01:08] his feet they knew they had killed him
[2:01:10] but it didn't look
[2:01:12] like what he went through and if he can
[2:01:16] if if if he could keep himself if he can
[2:01:19] keep
[2:01:20] Lazarus he can show keep
[2:01:24] [Applause]
[2:01:28] you and it's not a
[2:01:31] if I
[2:01:33] know let me read this last quote out of
[2:01:36] possessing the enemy's
[2:01:42] Gates says was
[2:01:45] Moses after being also in the line of
[2:01:47] this Royal seed the seed of of Abraham
[2:01:50] that he was sent down into Egypt to
[2:01:53] deliver the children of Israel and God
[2:01:56] had given him signs and wonders to
[2:01:58] perform and to Smite the Earth to bring
[2:02:01] forth frogs and fleas and darkness and
[2:02:03] hell and rain and fire and had done all
[2:02:06] these Miracles yet when he had them
[2:02:10] out when he led them out by the hand of
[2:02:13] Jehovah there come a time when he met
[2:02:16] the gate between him and the Promised
[2:02:18] Land there was a Red Sea a bar across
[2:02:21] the way they were hemmed in by Pharaoh's
[2:02:24] armies Army mountains and deserts and
[2:02:27] the Red Sea but Moses stepped forward
[2:02:30] and possessed the Gate of his enemy and
[2:02:33] crossed the Red Sea
[2:02:35] drot and he was walking on a dusty road
[2:02:39] can you imagine that the sea is a dusty
[2:02:41] road ye shall possess the Gate of the
[2:02:44] enemy God said so and that settles it he
[2:02:49] says a few years later when the Trials
[2:02:50] come and the church got All Shook
[2:02:54] Up as it's so easy for a Congregation of
[2:02:57] people to do when something just don't
[2:03:00] seem to happen the way that it's
[2:03:02] supposed to be God makes it that way
[2:03:09] look at this God brings
[2:03:14] tensions into the
[2:03:16] church God does it we blame on the devil
[2:03:19] no God bring tension into the church for
[2:03:23] every son that comes to God must be
[2:03:25] tried and proven and tested he lets
[2:03:28] sickness strike you he lets diseases
[2:03:32] come on you to test you and to prove you
[2:03:36] to show the world that you're truly the
[2:03:39] Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own
[2:03:43] will he permits disasters he permits
[2:03:47] friends to turn against you he permits
[2:03:50] all these things and turns the devil
[2:03:51] loose to tempt you and he will do all
[2:03:54] but take your life he could throw you on
[2:03:57] a bed of Affliction he could turn your
[2:04:00] neighbors against you he could turn the
[2:04:02] church against you he can do most
[2:04:05] anything and it's God's will for him to
[2:04:07] do it we are
[2:04:09] taught that it is more
[2:04:12] precious then go let's read these two
[2:04:16] last scriptures your trial is more preci
[2:04:18] prous than go 1 Peter

[2:04:25] scriptures 1 Peter 1:7 says this the
[2:04:27] trial of your faith being much more

[2:04:37] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
