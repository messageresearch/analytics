mean to leave y'all out just to Rebecca y'all good in y'all all the time but just it's good to have her with us it's just a real blessing amen we want to um take a scripture reading start out from the seventh chapter of Matthew the seventh chapter of Matthew I'm going to start reading from the 24th verse amen amen the reason this wise and I'll let you have your seats amen therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do it to them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the Reigns descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hears these things of mine and doeth them not shall be locking unto a foolish man which built his house upon sin may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated amen this morning amen I like to take a Texas morning on preparation preparation and I'm taking this started out here I'm going to read a little bit and go straight to a quote from the prophet on the oncoming storm and I thought it was just real timely on sister Melissa song that she sang this morning amen and being the the way the Lord was leading me on this morning on this message us being here from Florida we know about making preparation and uh this message was inspired by a conversation that I was having at some point with a young lady and she was having some difficulty on housing you know and that's that's that's going going on a lot right now with home prices going up the way they have been in rent skyrocketing and things like that there's more homeless people now than there ever been and uh so we see things are things are tightening up things are tightening up for everybody but we have to make preparation I was speaking with her and just out of inspiration it just hit me and I told her told her that I say well you you failed to make the proper preparations to maintain an Earthly home say but don't make that same mistake on your heavenly home don't fail to make the proper preparation see God has already provided everything you need he provided the land he's giving it to you as an inheritance he provided the material he provided everything you need he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also he said your body I have prepared for you I said don't fail to make the proper preparation for that Eternal home that's more important than anything you're talking about an Earthly home and things of that nature that's important on this side but these things will fade away these things have passed away it's important that you don't fail to prepare for that Heavenly home I want to read a little um a little bit here from the oncoming storm message was preached uh let's see here 1960. February 29th the oncoming storm and it might be a little bit lengthy to start out here but but it is I want you to get a lot of what he's saying here amen it's important to prepare we live here in Florida and we go through hurricane seasons and uh and and it's important to make preparation go out and uh and and get my tarps and different things like that and make sure I have enough water in the house before the storm hit I make sure I have all of the things that we might need just in case something happened we out of power I remember uh one storm there we were out of power for almost a month and uh we had generators all of us huddled up in one room I had to go run the FPL man down and gave him a 50 tip to come turn my power back on he came too and he came and turned it on I said that's what it takes but you have to make preparation because if you fail to make preparation for these kind of things then what happened is two things you end up depending on someone else to risk their life to come and rescue you because of your lack of preparation and you not only put you in danger but you put other folks in danger your loved ones and those other people and it's hard for people sometimes to just tell you no but I got just enough for for me my family here I mean why didn't you make preparation you know and I would hate to come to the end of the road in this life and you failed to make preparation and and and and and and and and and and things just go sideways on you so don't fail to make preparation starting here from 40 it says uh let's see here on coming store middle or add a blessing start from paragraph 40 sister may the Lord add a blessing now to the reading of his word he says I wish to speak a few moments upon the subject of the oncoming storm I trust to God that we will be able to yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit for anyone knows that I am not a preacher that's there is preachers behind me here I never got an education to be a minister but in my old slow ways but the lord gave me something else to do but I love to take a time so I can explain what I know about the Lord about his goodness and try to tell others about it and now we're speaking tonight on the oncoming storm and if I fail in words to express what I feel in my heart I pray that the holy spirit will reveal it Jesus was speaking here on the oncoming storm which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world every man and every woman that's born in the world there is just no way out of it the storm will strike you sometime or another and depends on what kind of foundation that you have whether your house will weather it or not there has been many lives saved because of preparation for storms and there has been many of lives lost because of failure to take heed to the warning of the storm that's coming he says not long ago not long ago I was told of a story that happened I believe I read the newspapers down in Florida they have many storms that sweeps through Florida typhoons coming up they're coming off the sea and bring water for city blocks up to the city and it sweeps out everything but I'm told that their weather profits are always on the lookout for such storms and some way through the elements they can contact and change contact the changing of the weather and the atmosphere that which a way this weather is gathering that will bring forth one of these storms because they made it a life study by certain instruments and Sciences have provided them uh and then by calling ahead and hearing of which a way the storm is coming how much wind it's got behind them and uh which way other storms are coming them winds whether it be to combat to shove shove the storm away I could stop here and preach on that that it takes a greater storm that's coming it takes a higher win to turn that storm it takes a higher win to turn that storm so sometime there's storms a man that may be coming in our lives but it takes a higher win to push that storm away they talk about now we talk about the El Nino and the uh what's that other thing they got now that that that changes the the weather and sometimes they work in our favor here in Florida and it pushes the storms away many times we've been threatened by storms and something happened that just a high come in and a stronger wind pushes the storms away and I listen at what the prophet said and all we know that we have got an oncoming storm and the only wind that I know that can turn the storm now he's talking about the storm in your life will be the rushing wind that fell at the day of Pentecost I'm told that there is men even in the city now speaking against communism they should be but just speaking against it is not enough we've got to find how to turn that thing and then there is only one thing that can turn that storm that's a more powerful storm that can be said it and change its course amen so when we we slow down just a little bit here we the prophet said that we know storms are going to come and a little bit long a little bit further down I I'll show you how how the Lord uses these things he uses troubles in our lives Amen to push us in the direction he wants us to go amen we have many examples in the Bible how God has used storms amen and when you see a storm it usually represents trouble trouble in your life things that you have to go through and sometimes we don't understand it but we have to trust in the Lord Lord why is this happening to me well well maybe you didn't prepare maybe your preparation was just a little bit off but that's okay all it takes is a stronger win Amen to derail the storms in your life amen we know that there is a wind that comes amen and see God is the master of the Wind he stood on the bow of the boat and he spoke to the wind and he said peace be still so it's in God's permissive will sometimes that the storms come Amen to push us where he wants us to be amen now let's continue on here Prophet says I was reading I forget just now I believe it was in the newspaper of a storm a few years ago that was on its way across central Florida and all the regions around Okeechobee was warned and I just left there about five weeks ago and there was a neighbor man who kept contact with radio all the time because these storms and he was a very renowned Christian I want you to pay attention to that now he was a Christian man and he heard that the great typhoon was coming that way twisting down the trees and everyone was warned to get to safety jumping around on me again and the people was warned to get the safety and he thought of his neighbor who had a chicken farm and some light buildings where their chickens in them were broader houses and so forth and their pins were all that they had in life was tied up with these chickens and they're living and he rushed quickly in front frantically up to the gate and stopped his car and he jumped out and said to this fellow take all the chickens and put them in your storm shelter and you rush over to mine because there is a coming a typhoon or a storm that's going to twist everything down and the man stood and looked at him the face and laughed at him and said nonsense I've heard them predict such things before and it never happened and the Christian neighbor was so excited he said but what if it does happen see we've been told for years that Christ is coming soon we've heard it I've heard it all my life that Jesus is coming soon but I'm here to tell you this morning Jesus is coming soon amen amen it's sooner than it was now than it was then amen every time uh brother Mike just had to bury a nephew was it my wife co-worker just lost a brother one week and in the very next week lost a sister death is all around us it's by the grace of God that we have an opportunity that we have an opportunity one more day Lord to make preparation you ought to be thankful this morning but one day the storm is going to be upon you have you made preparation we hear remarks like that all along the line have heard of these going this is going to happen and things to happen can you get me a water please brother and they're going to happen but it is going to happen one of these days and it behooves us to listen to the warning this man said I have no time for such foolishness I raise chickens and I have no such time for that and he cried out the neighbor said in the name of God he said leave those chickens alone then John and come quickly you and your family if you don't want to believe it let your family come the man wouldn't let his family come the man was giving him a warning this Christian man say that the storm is coming he refused to make any preparation it's about like us today we've had five-fold Ministry a Prophet come and tell us that the storm is coming and some people fail to make preparation still fail to make cause they don't believe it you can't believe it if you're not making preparation because if you believe that you'd be making preparation he will definitely deliver you from the storm he's provided a way of Escape we see now that Florida when a storm is coming and it's a bad one Dale's reroute all of the southbound traffic and everything going one way they made a way of Escape but because of the arrogance of men they ignore the warnings that we're going to ride it out we gonna ride it out we gonna take our chances don't take chances with this there's a storm coming and it behooves you to make sure you're ready and prepare for the storm he says amen you can't stop this storm from coming he said the man wouldn't even let his family come and he said I will not have my children to be excited over a few radio warnings I would not have my children be excited over some man preaching standing up and at The Forum screaming at the people tried to warn him who is he what makes him know everything this was a man telling them the storm coming I'll not have him be excited over a few radio warnings my children and I decided we'll live as I live and my wife would listen to me because I am the breadwinner of this home and she must listen to me I'm the boss here and I'll not have my children all excited and tore up about some nonsense and the neighbor was turned and he went to his home into his shelter all of a sudden the clouds was upon him before they even knew it not we are here in Florida he's talking about the 1928 storm many of you that lived here for a while know that there's a grave right over there across the street from Brother Westco Church where all of those people this person probably made over there because all those people that they couldn't that just died they went and scooped up bodies and they didn't have enough they couldn't bury him now called the water table was so high so they brought them over here to West Palm Beach and there's a mass grave right here in West Palm Beach and we've had a profit and this day that came here and preached the oncoming storm what a warning it was a warning to everybody but how much more took us right here we Face threats of hurricanes of storms all the time every year but there's another storm coming I started out talking about how we see uh the warning signs the housing market is in shambles I've never seen it this bad insurance companies leaving the prices are just going through the roof and people ain't prepared we get a storm now what they gonna do with all the homeless people on the street what they gonna do but there's a greater storm coming and we come and we sit here we come to church every Sunday and Wednesday and we hear the preacher saying get ready make preparation there's a storm coming will you be ready we are here this morning at the preparation ground when the hurricane comes uh uh you would be Home Depot in Publix and all of the grocery stores are full if you don't hurry up and get that gonna be nothing to laugh but we're here this morning at the great grocery store that will start up for the bride make preparation amen make sure your cabinets are full amen this bleeding word amen pull it into your heart and make sure sure that you're ready amen there's a storm coming we must make preparation now I'm talking about ain't talking about talking about it a lot of times people talk about it they hit the reports there's one out there and then they sit around and wait to the last minute y'all know what I'm talking about oh it ain't gonna be that bad we don't bear through this you know what we get complacent we get complacent we think well it happened last year and we we dodged one last year oh wait I'm not going through all of that I'm I'm I'm I'm tired of running out there behind water and all of these batteries and flashlights and things of that nature and we ignore the warnings some folk go out and buy liquor talking about we gonna have a hurricane party huh don't take it serious at all but I'ma tell you something you can't afford not to take this serious because there's another storm coming there's another wind coming to blowing and if you are not ready if you're not ready for this one you're going to be left behind you're going to be left behind this thing is finished the Republicans fighting the Democrats I heard I heard I heard one say say uh the the the how'd you say the the teachers are scared of scared of the uh principle the principal scared of scared of the boy and the boys scared of somebody the boys got and the children they scared of nobody this thing all the way backwards this thing is this thing is over with how can you raise the children like that got folks teaming up fighting for crazy rights it's over says as it was in the days of so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that's a warning and we ignore it we see all of the side everything is there but we fail to go to the grocery store and make preparations we fail to make sure that our shutters are up and they're tight we have to make sure that we have everything we need to weather the storm the scripture said in Matthew whosoever Hearth my sayings endorse them I would liken them to a wise man which builds his house upon a rock and Reigns this sin and floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded on a rock it was founded on a rock that rock is Jesus it had your anchor has to hold and grips a rock now if you fail everyone that hears these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened until a foolish man would build his house upon saying your house must be built upon the revelation of who he is your house must be built upon a revelation of Who You Are who he is to you and who you are to him amen it must be built upon the true word of this hour other than that nothing else to hold the winds and the and the storm is going to come your house going to be floating down the river because it's no stabilizer it's built upon shifting Sands dogmas and Creeds but we've had a prophet he came right here he's talking about right here see back then this was all swampland let me give you a little history this was all swamp the water came up the hill this led all the city was back there anything Western military was swamp this school is built on Swamp it ain't even steady news flash the ground the very ground we have in church on right now build upon swamp land and you think the storm ain't gonna come Prophet said it's common now I hope you can see the types I'm talking about a natural storm but I'm trying to type it with a spiritual storm that's coming and you've heard all your life get ready he's coming one of these days he's coming soon but we're closer now yeah then we wear it in and you still ain't getting ready you still fail to get ready so demand here all of a sudden the clouds was upon him before he knew it that's the way judgment strikes it comes so sudden you wonder how can their how can it be here so quick how I have seen cruel men who once cursed God and fall and scream and say how could you treat me this way the whole Foundation was swept out from under him in a moment it pays to take warning he says oh you might laugh at the messenger you might be able to even Kill the Messenger but you cannot kill the message it'll go on just the same God's message is eternal his word never fails amen I want to go on down to 59. he says here while the storm swept through the country it caught the chicken house and the farmer and they never found his body like I say it might be right over here and his wife frantically fighting and they lived close to the great Okeechobee Lake and the water began to rise as a typhoon lifted the waters all the way from the bottom of the lake he says that's what makes it so dangerous because the lake is shallow and the boats Rock and how the waves just come and turn the boats beneath them the storm comes and just whirls up the water and pack it for miles and the water is sweeping until the mother knows there was no hope but to get her children on top of the building and she got her children and got them on top of the building this old they're hanging on to this old chimney house and then the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasins he says I believe more deadly than your diamond bike rattlesnakes they were crawling for safety and they come on the roof with her and by listening to her husband and not taking heed to the warnings she had to stop and she beat but she had to stand and watch those vicious snakes bite her children until they died on that roof and the mother herself Was Bitten so much until she finally died he said that's the only way we got the story After the Storm had quieted and the search parties hunting for bodies and so forth they found her laying on top of the roof with her children laying by her side oh it pays to take warnings the first thing to do before there can be any warning there has to be preparation we must fail not we must not fail to prepare for this oncoming storm amen I want to shift a little bit God is always preparing us you see because he he works on both ends of the spectrum he's preparing a way of Escape for us we look back at Moses there and the children of Israel coming out of Egypt he made a way through the Red Sea he provided the way he prepared the way for them to go but first before he had to do that he had to prepare a prophet he had this he took Moses it took him 40 years to take all of the things that he had learned that he was preparing him for the great task at hand Amen to lead them that the way that he prepared see God prepared the way but he needed a prophet to lead the people but he had to prepare the profit amen so the people had to recognize that this was the prepared man and once they recognized that they spare has forgot the preparation God has prepared him to lead us to Freedom then they had to get prepared themselves amen it was Moses that dealt with pharaoh he said let my people go and these different things happen we know the story but at the end he thought the People Get Ready grab everything that's your own get your children ready we fitting to go we finna leave Asia now I was up to them see that's three preparations God prepared to wait Danny prepared a leader then he prepared the people had to get ready to follow the leader amen so here we have amen we have here five ways amen that God uses our problems in our lives to prepare us God uses problems a man to direct us he also uses our problems to inspect us he also uses problems amen I'ma get to it in a minute he also uses our problems Amen to perfect us so he uses problems to direct us he uses problems to inspect us he loses problems to direct us I say correct us correct us he uses problems to perfect us inspect us amen that's four he uses problems to direct us amen that's fine okay so it says here we'll look at the first one he uses problems to direct us amen we see and in Psalms 37 24 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand who is wise so sometimes we see that God must light a fire under us to get us to move problems often motivate us to change problems often uh uh uh often get us amen get our attention God is sometimes just trying to get your attention sometimes it takes a painful situation to make us change our ways to make us change our thinking speaking on the young lady that didn't have any way to live she's thinking a little bit different now well there's some things that you're going to have to do you're going to have to make preparation this I mean you you fail to make preparation now you you're expecting someone else to come and bail you out I'm hitting you I wish there was something I can do but see when you sometimes when you get to a point where you have been warned when you have been warned and you fail to met preparation and you have ignored the warning and you sit here in church Sunday after Sunday and don't even go on Wednesdays we rather stay home and watch TV we'll rather stay home and make excuses you know that's the devil's job is to give you an excuse if you need an excuse the devil got plenty on for you which one you need my stomach hurt I twisted my ankle at work um here's his best one I'm tired we all tired we all tied I live tied everything tied nine worked all night but we Press On we pressed on wild because we we want to be ready there's going to be a great and Dreadful day it's going to be a great day for all of those who have made themselves ready it's going to be a dreadful day for all of all to have it's going to be a more Dreadful day for people who have sat under the word and still fail to prepare and make themselves ready why because they sat there and listened to the thoughts of the devil see that's what this man with the chicken from he's guilt that wasn't his thoughts that wasn't nothing but the devil talking to him and he listened you know the devil talked to you right here the man of God is up at the platform speaking the word of God warning get ready get ready and the devil right there in your ear this man don't know what he talking about I'm not going to pay no attention to that I know I need the Holy Ghost but I'll get it later I know I ain't living right but that's all right I got time I'll do it next Sunday I'll wait another time I'm too young right now I want to do what I want to do devil come telling these young people today that the message ain't even right you know we fighting every day I'ma stand for this message mixing the word up trying to be that that's just listen I've been I've been a young man before and I love to hear myself talk love to hear myself talk especially when you think you know something but you don't know nothing when I became a licensed electrician I was I was I was a young fella and I had done went to school and got my license was there with all these older guys I was the youngest one in my shop I think I was about 26. the rest of these guys 50 years old 55 60 had their license for 20 years been working been building and doing all this stuff I come in there man came in he said you know just enough to kill yourself you know just enough to kill yourself or get somebody hurt now you can really hurt something you know why because you get that you think you'd undone something you get the smell in yourself I can put a quote together I I I I I can do this and I can do that and you fail to set up under some experience until you get out of order but I said I had this one guy in particular guy named Bucky was the he was if the prophet talked about that what's the man know with the beady eyes and the real mean fella lives at eyes or something yeah he would just like bird that man was so ornery drank a thermos of coffee in the morning and smoked cigarettes Just Smokes that but he was a I still to this they say the best electrician I ever worked with that man was good but I followed behind him like a little pup and he would challenge me and he knew how to get me to work he intentionally made me mad he'll make me mad that man knew how to get up under my skin and the matter I got he he realized he'll get me mad and on the way home he's sitting over there laughing I said what you laughing at he said man you easy he said I could get you to work all I got to do is make you mad you a word like a boy you work like a machine when you get mad but one day we I and he knew I was a Christian because I would I would I would get to the job site and doing lunch everybody be sitting over there talking I'll be in the corner reading my Bible and he said he wanted them fine Brimstone preachers not a young guy I see Willie that's what you call it and so I even got him even more and so we got into it he got on me just got under my skin he had me dig a ditch he had me dig the ditch about a 40-yard ditch not the other thing I came back over and I told him I'm done he said not cover it up I said cover it up he said I was just playing we needed over here I said why you play you play like that man he walk away laughing that's how he was he walk away laughing so I finally got to him and I he said he was messing with me he said what you want to be you want to be an electrician I said imma be whatever God want me to be and we ended up going back and forth and back and forth and we yelling and fussing at each other he said that's it get in the truck I'm taking you back to the shop I see that's fine with me let's go cause you are unable to work with anybody and we got in the truck and we drove all the way back to the shop and he looked at me last said you ready to go to work now I said why'd you be playing with me man my emotions all worked up and the last thing I ever worked with him we was working at a place called an Eye Brand Farms and we was actually racing he had one bait that he had to wire and I had the other bit that I had to work and I wanted to beat him so bad and I didn't know that he was going on vacation that day and I was working working up and down the ladder working pulling wired and doing everything and I finally finished and I seen the getting ready to leave another gentleman had came to take his place and I seen him pulling off and I jumped off the ladder and I ran down the road I say I'm finished and I beat you and I see him at the river mirror waving and laughing and that was the last time I see him he died the next week he was cutting his grass up until he had a property in Tennessee that he was leaving to go to and it was on a hill and he cutting the grass on the hill and had a heart attack and died that was the last time I ever seen her but he taught me a lot he taught me a lot he made me a good electrician but you know my point in all of that was saying that a lot of times we think we know something and we fail to just wait we fail to just be even if you know you know what when I was when I was when I was an apprentice even if I knew I was right I wouldn't say nothing out of respect for my job even if I knew I was right I know I'm right ain't gonna never disrespect him I'm not going to jump in the man move you don't know what you're doing and argue with him and this with him this man taught me what I know that is even if I knew I was right ain't gonna say nothing and he could never jump in no ditch around me it's ironic now that I'm working at the airport we did a lot of work around the airport and uh he'll be in there he wasn't afraid of that shovel he'll get in that ditch with that shovel and dig that dictionary thing I would jump in the ditch and take the shovel from myself no journeyman of mine never gonna be digging and I'm standing up on the bank got in there got with it ain't gonna happen and that's what we're losing with these youngsters today they're losing their place but this is our future this is our future the warning signs all around us we have to be ready so we see that we have a a he uses problems to get us ready to direct us we see amen uh um Jonah Jonah was commissioned by God amen to go Amen to Nineveh but I want you to look here In Jonah the fourth chapter says but it just please Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the Lord and said pray thee O Lord was not this my saying when I was yet in my country therefore I fled before unto tarnish tarshish for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentance thee of the evil therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live then the Lord said then said the Lord do us thou well to be angry so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city and the Lord God prepared a Gore and made it to come up over Jonah that it might Shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief the Lord prepared a gourd to Shadow him Amen to deliver him from his grief but God prepared a worm when the morning Rose the next day and it smoked the gourd that it withered and it came to pass when the sun did rise that God prepared a vehement East Wind the Sun Beat upon the head of Jonah and he fainted and wished himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live God said to Jonah do us thou well to be angry for the God and he said I do well to be angry even unto death then said the Lord thou Hast pity upon the God for which thou has not labored neither made it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not I spare Nineveh that great City wherein more than uh six four thousand persons that cannot discern between right hand from their left hand and also much cattle he didn't want to go to Nineveh but God had to prepare a prophet had to prepare him so he prepared earlier he prepared a great fish then he prepared the guard then he prepared the worm all to prepare Jonah so he going through all of this to prepare profit to go to a people that don't know that don't know nothing don't know they left hand from their right hand but God was thinking about Nineveh why because she knew that they had a repentant heart so he went through all of that to prepare the prophet prepared to fish prepared the guard prepared the worm just to prepare him to save a people God prepared all he did all my God to get them ready he did the same thing for us my brothers and sisters God also uses problems to inspect us Prophet said at one point he said people are like tea bags if you want to know what's inside of them just drop them in hot water and see what come out see sometimes God drops us in hot water why just to see what's going to come out of us you know the prophet said God allows things to come up in church let me find that quote he allows things possession negated me anyway he said was only a few years later when the Trials come in the church got All Shook Up as it is so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way it's supposed to be God makes it that way God brings tension into the church every son that cometh to God must be tried proven tested he lets sickness strike you he lets disease come upon you God now allows these things to prove you to show the world that you're truly a Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disaster he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you he'll do all of that but take your life but could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn to church against you he can do most anything and it's God's will for him to do it we are taught that it's more precious than gold but what is he doing he's permitting these things for a purpose see I thought it was just ironic you know and just wonderful how brother smiling a couple weeks ago was talking about how the diamond must be cut Amen to show forth that light that's the cutting of the diamond so be not dismayed rejoicing your trials rejoice in the problems a lot of people are afraid to preach those kind of messages and things but I want to be ready he uses these problems and different things now if you go through the travel right way it's going to build character it's going to be a character in you he wants to be proud of you and say look at my son look at my daughter they're not potted plants they're solid they're not going anywhere he would allow problems to come up in the hole he would allow problems to come up at work just to see how you're going to handle it sometimes we get to a place where just I quit quit no you need to go back to the altar you ain't ready yet you need some more preparing to do you need to get to the preparation house you need to be beat on some more and beat on some more why because she wants you to be rugged he wants you to be prepared because there's a storm coming and it ain't gonna be nothing nice you know even the people that's prepared have to go through some things in the storm you put the shutters on you got all of the stuff prepared you got your generator gas and all of that kind of stuff and you're sitting in the house Lord Jesus end up praying folks that over here drinking and carrying on you end up praying Lord let this storm pass Us by so just because you prepared don't mean you're not gonna go through something amen but you are prepared to go through it and he's preparing us to go through the storm that's coming amen there is a squeeze going on hey man it's only going to squeeze us right on up out of here amen but we're going to stand the test amen we're going to stand the pressure amen they're going to come forth it's pure gold amen but we must make preparation we must be prepared amen I have another quote here this message called inspiration and uh here we noticed the shooter might woman paragraph 39 inspiration and I'll read this it says notice how and this shoot of my woman she said to her husband you know there's a holy man that comes to see us and let us pray thee bill just a little chamber on the side of the house for him in other words we want to be just as close to him when he's in the neighborhood as we can be we know he's a Jew we're Gentiles but yet he's a holy man and we recognize him to be that way we believe he's a truthful man and so we got enough money to do that so let us build us a chamber on the side of the house and put a stool in there and a little bed in there that when he come some water in the picture and so forth he can refresh herself and lie down and stretch out uh how God foreknows all things and making preparation you see they were making preparation put this on this lady's heart amen that was God making preparation for the man of God there God knows all things he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's I'm omniscient he knows all things the he knows all things when the world better forever was a star in heaven before there ever was a light in the firmament God knew every Prophet ever lived on in everything that men and women would ever do he's infinite and how that he wants his people to get things ready like in the Antelope and destruction he's getting people ready today like he got that woman ready watch what that little bit did later notice she built the bed because she was inspired to do so and when God gives you a revelation to do something and if it's the right thing for whatever you do do it don't wait till tomorrow do it when God says do it she was able to do it now the first thing you just don't want to be a fanatic but it's but if it's according to the word do it if God is speaking to you now or will tonight or tomorrow or any time in your life you know you have to live where you should live you know you have to be how you you know you're you're professing something that you really don't possess in your soul and you're not hiding it from God and you should be right you should live in a place with God where every day the sun is shining then go down to God and ask God to give you that and God will do it for its inspiration leading you that way because that would be the will of God so we see we have trouble God is trying to get us ready and he says when when when when you hear it when you hear the word of God like this shooter Mike woman she was pre she had an inspiration to do something he says when you feel that way and that Revelation do it quickly or the devil will come and talk you right out of it when you're sitting in the church and you hit a man of God and that thing hits your soul and you've got that inspiration do it quickly don't wait because the devil will come and take it right out he'll begin to speak mind battles into your ear he'll begin to lean on you just a little bit by the time you leave if you don't if you don't move quickly he'll take that desire he'll take that thirst because God is going to come and he'll that nudge that seed a little bit move quickly move right away yield to him surrender to his will if you wait the devil will come and take it out I see it so many times the atmosphere is just right sit there and I know God is speaking to an individual no God is just tugging on them and you quench it and hold on and allow the devil to take your place move quickly God is preparing you he's nudging you in that direction you know you got problems in your life he uses the problem no doubt because of the problems you're here today no doubt because of the problems things you could I thought I got nowhere to turn ain't got nowhere else to go Lord if you don't help me I won't be helped he uses those problems to drive you where he wants you to be he's making he's preparing you but you got to prepare you got to be willing to make preparation he's done everything that he said he would do he's made everything he's laid everything out for you he's provided the way of Escape he's provided all of the materials he provided the prophet to Legion he provided the pastor to see you through you know the prophet said the church don't make you a Christian just don't make you a Christian but what it does do is help you maintain your Christianity ain't nowhere in the world you gotta tell your heart you'll come and you say Lord take my life I want to be a Christian but if you don't never follow up you don't never come to church you'll be a Christian for a good hot week you can't maintain it that way every time the daughter of the church is open I want to be there cause I done been out there in them streets and it ain't nothing nice ain't nothing out there for you but death to spell another thing he uses problems for is to correct you now he done gave you away he'd done all of these things when you get out there on your own and then problems here ain't nobody's fault but yours because you fail to make preparation you find yourself on the bottom skin real how do I get here because you fail to make preparation now I've been to correct you no Daddy talk about with another child amen he told the child not to touch the hot stove soon as you turn your back ow see maybe now you'll listen that's the same thing God doing maybe now you listen you don't got your head thought you know wound up in places you don't want to be you were told better but you didn't heed the warning and now you're like oh I might get away from here I do bad I do better I do better now God don't vote you out amen put the man of God before you now what you're gonna do now what you gonna do the problem is we can't doubt our flesh we can't die to have flesh we want to do what we want to do you better yield to his will you better yield to his way it's the greatest decision I ever made to yield humble yourself and let God lead you remember yourself sometimes we too smart for our own good Lord leave me I don't know nothing I don't know nothing but to pray and to ask you to leave me and got me I'd have done it my way and I made all kind of mistakes messed up made a mess of this thing but I know you can turn it around turn it around I'm gonna make preparation musicians come musicians come amen are you willing to humble yourself are you willing this morning to make preparation there's a storm coming there's a
