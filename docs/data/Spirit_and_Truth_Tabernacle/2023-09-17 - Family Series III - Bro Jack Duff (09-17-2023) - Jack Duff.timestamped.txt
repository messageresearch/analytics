[4:04] his brother Jack was preaching Wednesday
[4:06] night he struck something when he was
[4:08] speaking of
[4:09] what King Solomon said a a bad woman is
[4:13] watering your blood but a good woman is
[4:15] a jewel in your crown
[4:17] and it brought my mind to this little
[4:19] portion of scripture
[4:21] we'll start at verse 13.
[4:24] it says your words have been Stout
[4:26] against me saith the Lord
[4:29] yet ye say what have we spoken so much
[4:32] against thee
[4:33] you have said
[4:35] it is vain to serve God and what profit
[4:38] is it that we have kept his ordinance
[4:40] and that we have walked mournfully
[4:42] before the Lord of hosts
[4:44] [Music]
[4:46] and now we call the proud happy yay they
[4:49] that work wickedness are set up yea they
[4:52] that tempt God or even deliver
[4:55] this right here was a little precious to
[4:57] me it says then they that fear the lord
[4:59] spake often one to another and the Lord
[5:02] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[5:05] remembrance was written before him
[5:08] for them that fear the lord and that
[5:11] thought upon his name
[5:14] then God turns around and says and they
[5:17] shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts
[5:19] in the day
[5:21] in that day when I make up my jewels in
[5:25] a jewel
[5:26] a good wife is a jewel in a man's crowd
[5:29] so on a day that he is making up his
[5:31] bride and they shall be mine said the
[5:33] Lord of hosts and that day when I make
[5:35] up my jewels and I will spare them as a
[5:39] man spareth his own son that serveth him
[5:42] then shall ye return and discern between
[5:45] the righteous and the wicked between him
[5:47] that serveth God and him that serveth
[5:50] him not
[5:51] amen let's Empower his
[5:53] [Music]

[47:02] you know I remember her coming through
[47:04] and just saying she had this growth and
[47:05] she just wanted to be prayed for and you
[47:08] know the sermon that morning that was
[47:09] preached was somewhere between here and
[47:13] there

[47:25] the doctor's appointment
[47:27] God God met her yeah

[47:35] mean I remember in that sermon I I
[47:37] there's a quote that the Lord added to
[47:39] it right before I I ministered on it and
[47:42] uh it was a quote where brother random
[47:44] say um
[47:46] um
[47:47] um pretty much we

[47:51] god

[47:55] talk back to us Amen in the Supernatural
[47:58] way and uh you know and we were just
[48:00] kind of highlighting that and I said you
[48:03] know we we've seen that God at um at

[48:06] say we've seen that God at Spirit
[48:08] through Tabernacle amen as well and uh
[48:11] and I wanted to just encourage because
[48:13] uh uh when God does things like that we
[48:16] know that the I like to say it like this
[48:18] that the Angels trouble in the water and
[48:20] and I don't know what people's
[48:22] situations and circumstances are
[48:25] uh but God knows what you're going
[48:27] through
[48:28] and um and and I just want to pause just
[48:31] for a second to say this that you know
[48:34] um oftentimes you might see that I don't
[48:36] do like
[48:38] um you know when people come up and be
[48:39] prayed for but I'm not against that I
[48:42] want y'all to know I'm not against that

[49:27] your presence and uh just move in the
[49:29] midst of people we need more of God we

[50:19] mama didn't set you up for this but this
[50:21] was a great service for you to attend
[50:23] today
[50:24] amen amen we've been in a little series
[50:27] Amen on a family series and we we
[50:30] started with the fathers amen the
[50:33] husbands uh because husbands have to be
[50:35] first partakers and then we came down to
[50:39] uh the wives on last week amen and
[50:42] talking about uh submission and
[50:44] everything and uh and then I told it
[50:46] that the the young people after I
[50:48] finished with your mama and I finished
[50:50] with your dad and I'm coming to you
[50:53] here we are
[50:56] so we got to talk about the children
[50:58] today amen
[51:00] and let's read the word of the Lord uh
[51:03] for those that are working the the
[51:05] computer slot 47 is actually where I'm
[51:08] starting at amen there you go wonderful
[51:12] um and those of you that have your
[51:14] Bibles uh just
[51:16] um turn it to Ephesians chapter six
[51:19] and um before we would just get started
[51:22] here let's just have a word of Prayer
[51:25] amen amen
[51:27] sounds like it's just my hearts might be
[51:30] a little bit too much so amen father
[51:34] we are grateful for the opportunity to
[51:38] come into the house of the Lord and to
[51:41] feel the presence of God
[51:44] we have been blessed oh God by the song
[51:48] service
[51:49] Lord the singers as well as the
[51:52] musicians and got each one and their
[51:55] role helping to take us deeper into the
[51:59] presence of the Lord it makes a
[52:02] difference when it's not just a gift but
[52:05] when there's oil flowing through the
[52:07] gift
[52:08] uh it makes a tremendous difference
[52:10] whether singing or whether it's playing
[52:12] the oil God means everything so we ask
[52:16] Lord that uh you just continue to bless
[52:18] amen these singers and musicians that
[52:20] you continue to keep them that you'll
[52:22] watch over them that they would
[52:24] understand the importance of what they
[52:26] do uh to a service it just opens the
[52:29] entrance for the word of God to come
[52:31] forth without hindrance so father we
[52:34] pray that you would just take control of
[52:36] our thoughts as we just begin to
[52:38] minister from what you've given us for
[52:41] the church for this season I pray that
[52:43] you would use it for your glory and for
[52:45] your honor help us to draw closer to you
[52:48] father through your word and uh we uh we
[52:51] just commit more the the remainder of
[52:53] this service into your hands and
[52:56] um I pray for the brothers Lord just
[52:58] working there with the sound that you
[52:59] would just continue to give them wisdom
[53:01] and Direction and uh we we expect the
[53:03] enemy to try to fight us somewhere but
[53:06] uh we claim victory and then of
[53:09] everything that he does so God be
[53:11] glorified and magnified and exalted in
[53:13] Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the
[53:16] Lord Ephesians chapter 6 amen verse 1
[53:21] through 3 the Bible uh declares
[53:26] amen
[53:28] um
[53:30] children obey your parents
[53:35] and I love the way Paul puts this it's
[53:37] in the Lord
[53:40] Amen in the Lord that's very very
[53:42] important uh because if you've got a
[53:44] parent that's leading you to do things
[53:46] that's outside the Lord then you've got
[53:48] to put God first
[53:50] amen you always put God first so he says
[53:54] this uh children obey your parents in
[53:57] the Lord
[53:58] uh uh for this is right
[54:03] honor thy father
[54:06] and mother
[54:09] and and I like the way Paul puts that
[54:11] too because we have a lot of people
[54:13] today that honor
[54:15] mother
[54:16] and forget
[54:18] that Mama can have you by herself
[54:24] so the Bible says honor
[54:28] thy father
[54:30] and mother
[54:32] which is the first commandment with
[54:34] promise the promise is not effective if
[54:38] you're only doing half of it
[54:42] amen
[54:43] it's a quite already Lord
[54:50] I'm just reading the Bible
[54:52] uh verse 3 that it may be well with thee
[54:57] and thou mayest live long on the earth
[55:00] last week we had this little diagram on
[55:02] the screen uh for headship and the way
[55:04] that family the biblical order of the
[55:06] family I found this online and you can
[55:08] see Christ is the head of the family
[55:10] it's got to be Christ and uh and then
[55:13] underneath that god holds the husband
[55:16] responsible Adam was responsible for
[55:18] what happened in the Garden of Eden when
[55:20] when Eve fell God did not come down and
[55:23] ask for Eve read the Bible he says Adam
[55:27] Adam Where Art Thou and it was after
[55:30] Adam fell with Eve right so god holds
[55:33] the husband or the father respect
[55:35] responsible for the family then the wife
[55:36] comes underneath that submission to the
[55:39] husband as he submitted to Christ and
[55:41] then underneath that are the children uh
[55:44] and all they're required to do is love
[55:46] and obey their parents and remember I
[55:48] mentioned last week sometimes the
[55:49] children trying to move up to the same
[55:51] level as the bomb or as the same levels
[55:53] of death and and I like I said last week
[55:55] if you're gonna move up to that level it
[55:57] ain't God's order but if you're gonna do
[55:59] it then you're gonna protect wow
[56:04] you're gonna get yourself a job
[56:07] and we gonna eat your groceries you're
[56:10] gonna pay for the lights
[56:13] how are you gonna pay for the water
[56:16] y'all y'all young people know that water
[56:19] they all taking a bath in somebody
[56:20] paying for that
[56:22] every month
[56:25] when you're gonna flip on a light switch
[56:26] and boom the light come on that didn't
[56:29] happen just to happen somebody paid for
[56:32] that to happen
[56:34] and if your parents let you see the
[56:36] bills
[56:38] if you just saw the cost of the bill
[56:41] yo yo yo your job
[56:44] your job wouldn't handle it
[56:50] amen
[56:51] another scripture real quick here
[56:54] Colossians 3 20.
[56:56] it says this
[56:57] children obey your parents
[57:00] and all things
[57:03] this is
[57:05] well pleasing unto the Lord you may be
[57:08] seated and then children will be your
[57:10] parents and all things for this is well
[57:12] pleasing
[57:13] to the Lord
[57:17] let me um
[57:28] let's just kind of start here uh
[57:30] just a couple statements amen and
[57:35] scriptures that I want to read
[57:37] uh next for me
[57:40] some of the challenges that we have here
[57:44] in our world today especially when it
[57:46] comes to children or band and parents if
[57:49] there is a I mentioned it last week when
[57:52] it comes to why I've submitted to the
[57:54] husband there's a spirit that has come
[57:56] into the land that uh is that challenges
[58:00] the wives sometime you know and their
[58:02] role in submission it challenges them
[58:04] because they you know why somehow wives
[58:07] have to work and that's understandable
[58:09] you know they I mean we live in a very
[58:10] very expensive area of the world and uh
[58:14] so I would not come up here and say
[58:15] don't work I would say this if you if
[58:17] you can afford not to do it it's a great
[58:19] thing especially when you got children
[58:21] at home and you're raising children it's
[58:22] a great thing after the children are
[58:24] gone there's nothing wrong with you
[58:26] oh Lord nothing wrong with you getting a
[58:29] job after the children are gone amen
[58:31] amen but why the children are there I
[58:34] understand you want to be there to raise
[58:35] your kids they want to be involved in
[58:36] their life if you can do that that's
[58:38] great I would never put pressure on
[58:39] anybody to try to force them to do that
[58:41] I wouldn't I wouldn't preach preach it
[58:43] that way you'd be led of God as a family
[58:45] uh there's also a spirit in the land
[58:47] that's kind of coming against the
[58:48] children uh we live in a we live in a
[58:51] society where children are taking their
[58:52] parents to court
[58:55] it hasn't happened to me yet and and I
[58:59] and and I'm glad it hadn't but but my
[59:02] question is if if you taking me to court
[59:04] who paying for it
[59:07] I'm gonna pay for you to take me to
[59:09] court you ain't coming back home with me
[59:14] let the court take care of you from here
[59:17] on out all right but but we're living in
[59:19] a society where they've been enabled to
[59:21] do these types of things I think
[59:23] somebody sued their parents over not
[59:26] wanting to go to church
[59:30] this is when the Bible tells us to train
[59:32] up a child the way that they should go
[59:33] and when they get old they want to
[59:35] depart right we we have a responsibility
[59:37] to take our kids to church
[59:39] Amen brother Brandon even said and we
[59:41] don't have Sunday school say but we're
[59:43] going to have Sunday School going again
[59:44] and when Sunday School going Paris
[59:47] you're not supposed to amen just send
[59:49] your kids to Sunday school amen you got
[59:52] to take them you got to bring them to
[59:54] Sunday school
[59:55] come on somebody you got to be involved
[59:58] in this but but we're living in a
[59:59] society where just everything is kind of
[1:00:02] coming against the kids they they they
[1:00:04] they they they they they they get
[1:00:06] information from places that they
[1:00:07] probably shouldn't get it from
[1:00:08] especially not the Bible they make they
[1:00:10] may hear something in school some child
[1:00:12] say they did something to their parent
[1:00:14] and and now you feel like you
[1:00:17] you know and you don't realize there's a
[1:00:19] spirit just jumped on you because it
[1:00:21] ain't gonna happen at our house I
[1:00:23] remember my my kids was we were out
[1:00:26] somewhere and uh somebody some child did
[1:00:30] something today mama and just
[1:00:32] embarrassed her
[1:00:33] and my daughters looked at me and say
[1:00:35] Daddy
[1:00:37] if we I mean right there if we did that
[1:00:41] I'd be going to jail if you did what
[1:00:45] that kid just did in public I'll be
[1:00:48] going to jail over you
[1:00:50] amen and I'm gonna tell you like this I
[1:00:52] will be smiling
[1:00:55] in jail because I'm gonna make sure if
[1:00:58] I'm going to jail it's gonna be worth it
[1:01:00] now
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:08] I got all that
[1:01:11] but but my kids feel like you know and
[1:01:13] they see these things or they hear some
[1:01:15] child say something you feel like you
[1:01:16] feel like you can do the same no you
[1:01:18] can't do that that that's against
[1:01:19] scriptural principles
[1:01:21] and one of the scripture tells us II
[1:01:24] Timothy 3 verse one through four this
[1:01:25] know also that in last days perilous
[1:01:28] dangerous perilous times shall come
[1:01:30] dangerous times
[1:01:31] uh for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:01:34] selves this is why we take selfies that
[1:01:37] word was not even found in our
[1:01:40] dictionary until this age
[1:01:42] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:01:45] amen Covetous boasters proud
[1:01:51] blasphemers and look at this one
[1:01:53] disobedient to parents so this is a
[1:01:57] spirit that comes in this this time and
[1:01:59] we're dealing with the spirit right not
[1:02:01] only that they unthankful
[1:02:04] just just you know just as simple
[1:02:06] somebody you know at the you you're
[1:02:09] walking into a store and there's a door
[1:02:11] that has to be open for you to get in
[1:02:12] and somebody stop and just open the door
[1:02:16] for you you just walk right in and don't
[1:02:18] say nothing
[1:02:20] so my my daughter's got this little
[1:02:22] thing they say they feel like just
[1:02:23] grabbing you when you do that somebody
[1:02:25] do they just grab and pull him back on
[1:02:27] the other side no now let's try this
[1:02:29] again when you walk through this time
[1:02:31] realize the door wasn't open by itself
[1:02:33] it's not an automatic though this is
[1:02:35] this is me actually putting some effort
[1:02:38] in and the least you can say
[1:02:42] yeah yeah right thank you all right I'm
[1:02:46] thankful
[1:02:47] Unholy
[1:02:49] spirits that you find young people want
[1:02:52] to dress a certain way you don't realize
[1:02:53] it's an Unholy spirit that is actually
[1:02:57] attacking you and causing you to want to
[1:03:00] dress that way it's an Unholy spirit
[1:03:02] that enters into the land and it's
[1:03:04] perfect prophesied for this day and your
[1:03:08] parents are always going against you but
[1:03:09] no you can't look like that you can't
[1:03:11] dress like that tie this down
[1:03:19] because the spirits that we fighting I'm
[1:03:22] thankful Unholy
[1:03:24] and see when it when internet Unholy
[1:03:27] Spirit get on you now it's easy for you
[1:03:29] to move into the disobedient
[1:03:31] to parents
[1:03:34] it's easy
[1:03:36] because one Spirit gonna try to open up
[1:03:37] a door for another spirit
[1:03:40] here are the other thing to say without
[1:03:42] natural affection
[1:03:43] truce Breakers
[1:03:45] I mean they Liars
[1:03:47] uh false accusers
[1:03:50] incontinent
[1:03:52] now and what what in concert I mean I
[1:03:54] want you to get this I want you to get
[1:03:55] this I underlined it see this right here
[1:03:58] incontinent what that actually means is
[1:04:02] no self-control
[1:04:07] we got young people
[1:04:09] with no
[1:04:11] self-control
[1:04:15] you need the Holy Ghost to help you
[1:04:16] control yourself
[1:04:20] control your mouth even you got to
[1:04:23] control what you think everything you
[1:04:25] think don't have to come out your mouth
[1:04:31] truth
[1:04:33] everything you're thinking got to come
[1:04:35] out your mouth actually you'll learn as
[1:04:36] you get older you got the whole some of
[1:04:38] that stuff in
[1:04:40] if I told people everything I thought
[1:04:51] in concert means no self-control fears
[1:04:55] these are spirits
[1:04:57] the spouses of those that are good
[1:05:00] traitors
[1:05:01] heady you know it all
[1:05:05] right
[1:05:08] these are the spirits and look you don't
[1:05:11] know more than your parents
[1:05:13] you just was born yesterday you don't
[1:05:15] know more than your parents people
[1:05:17] that's been here for for 30 40 50 60
[1:05:20] years they don't went through a lot you
[1:05:21] can learn from them
[1:05:24] Traders had a high-minded levels of
[1:05:27] pleasure more than lovers of God these
[1:05:30] are the spirits that we fight nowadays
[1:05:31] next uh the prophet says this the
[1:05:34] teenage kids took over the world
[1:05:37] he says now you know that the Bible
[1:05:39] predicts that unthankful and holy
[1:05:41] without natural affection so this
[1:05:42] teenagers taking over the world that's
[1:05:44] that scripture in second Timothy three
[1:05:46] uh teenagers taking over the world
[1:05:48] teenagers teenagers right and it says
[1:05:51] now uh and anybody that's been a teenage
[1:05:53] you know you ain't know nothing when you
[1:05:55] was a teenager and let me tell you
[1:05:57] something about about just just this
[1:05:59] real quick
[1:06:00] teenaging is the shortest span of your
[1:06:03] life so you can you can be a child from
[1:06:05] 0 to 12.
[1:06:07] you can be a teenager from 13 to 19. six
[1:06:11] years 12 years as a child six years as a
[1:06:15] teenager and then 20 on
[1:06:17] adult
[1:06:19] so it's the shortest time period where
[1:06:21] you got to make the most adjustments in
[1:06:24] that time period so it's very important
[1:06:26] to understand you learning during that
[1:06:27] time
[1:06:28] you're not an adult yet right
[1:06:31] amen you're not an adult yet and if you
[1:06:34] make bad decisions during that time it
[1:06:36] actually affect you the rest of your
[1:06:39] life if you make good decisions during
[1:06:41] that teenage time it actually affects
[1:06:43] you the rest of your life so good seeds
[1:06:47] while you're a teenager
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:51] because good things will come up
[1:06:54] if you just go back look at where you
[1:06:56] are right now your young adults look at
[1:06:58] where you are right now and look back
[1:07:00] what you did when you was a teenager
[1:07:02] are you still stuck in those years
[1:07:06] because you're supposed to you're
[1:07:08] supposed to be moving forward now
[1:07:10] hello
[1:07:12] brother Branham says this he says um you

[1:07:17] thankful and holy without natural

[1:08:31] you know parents like y'all need to
[1:08:32] understand that and don't don't don't
[1:08:34] don't just brush over that too quickly

[1:09:09] well that stuff would make you nervous
[1:09:11] you have to go down and get a bunch of
[1:09:13] tranquilizers to take after hearing the
[1:09:16] crazy stuff that's just like a Christian
[1:09:18] uh that's that's just irks a Christian
[1:09:21] if you like that kind of stuff you know
[1:09:25] what's wrong with you you need to get
[1:09:27] saved
[1:09:29] because what's in you is feeding on
[1:09:31] something besides the words
[1:09:34] praise the lord we don't want to be
[1:09:36] feeding on something besides the word
[1:09:39] all right this next uh statement here in
[1:09:42] the message leadership brother Branham
[1:09:43] makes a statement says you know Jesus
[1:09:46] loves Little Children You know he does
[1:09:48] and there was a little boy one time
[1:09:50] named Moses we're going to talk about
[1:09:51] him just a little bit and he was a very
[1:09:53] fine
[1:09:54] says you know what made him help make
[1:09:57] him a fine boy
[1:09:59] he says
[1:10:00] um he had a good mother to raise him see
[1:10:03] that's what she taught him about the
[1:10:04] Lord and you little boys and girls has
[1:10:07] got the same kind of mothers to raise
[1:10:08] you teach you about the Lord just mind
[1:10:12] them
[1:10:14] obey them just just mind your mama mind
[1:10:17] your daddy and mind your business
[1:10:24] just mind them
[1:10:26] says you know what the first commandment
[1:10:28] is in the Bible the first commandment
[1:10:30] was promised with a promise maybe a
[1:10:32] little hard for you to understand these
[1:10:34] Commandments the first commandment is
[1:10:35] not to have any other God but him but
[1:10:37] the great commandment and the first
[1:10:39] commandment that has a promise to it see
[1:10:41] is to the children do you know did you
[1:10:43] know that uh that he said children obey
[1:10:46] your parents a man which may lengthen
[1:10:49] lengthen the days upon the Earth that
[1:10:51] the Lord that God has given thee to mind
[1:10:53] your parents and do what you're doing it
[1:10:57] may give you longer life
[1:11:00] I'll put it this way you die early
[1:11:03] by not obeying your parents and honoring
[1:11:06] them
[1:11:08] a lot of people you see living a long
[1:11:10] life when I when I see a person in the
[1:11:12] 80s 90s you know 100 years old I I first
[1:11:15] thing I said how was your relationship
[1:11:17] with your parents even if they're not
[1:11:19] even safe
[1:11:20] how was your relationship with your
[1:11:22] parents how did you treat your parents I
[1:11:23] mean there's a promise that goes with
[1:11:25] people that honor their parents
[1:11:29] all right look at this tomorrow your
[1:11:32] parents and do what you're doing it may
[1:11:33] give you a longer life on the earth that
[1:11:35] the Lord has given you more time to
[1:11:37] serve him I hope today that I'm looking
[1:11:39] at a bunch of preachers and singers and
[1:11:41] evangelists of the day that is to come
[1:11:43] if there is a day after hours now uh as
[1:11:47] we go forward here I wanted to you know
[1:11:49] just go back Amen to the Ten
[1:11:51] Commandments because this is where Paul
[1:11:54] gets his instructions for us to honor
[1:11:56] our father and our mother this is coming
[1:11:58] from what Moses was given by God to give
[1:12:00] to the people of God God only gave the
[1:12:03] people 10 rules to live by ten and they
[1:12:06] couldn't do them ten right and and one
[1:12:09] of those 10 rules was just honor your
[1:12:11] parents
[1:12:13] and that's that's the origination and
[1:12:15] stuff I didn't want to just go back and
[1:12:16] just get the honor the parents I want to
[1:12:18] give all 10 Commandments
[1:12:20] let's read the first uh first ones here
[1:12:22] Exodus 3 verse of Exodus 20 verse 3
[1:12:25] through 16 is where we find it now the
[1:12:27] first one is found here in Exodus 20
[1:12:28] verse 3 Thou shalt have no other gods
[1:12:31] before me it's the first commandment God
[1:12:34] has given us Thou shalt have no other
[1:12:35] gods before me God wants to be first in
[1:12:37] your life amen number the the second one
[1:12:40] Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven
[1:12:44] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:12:47] is in heaven or that is in the earth
[1:12:49] beneath or that is in the water under
[1:12:51] the Earth verse 5 says Thou shalt not
[1:12:54] bow down thyself to them nor serve them
[1:12:57] for I the Lord God am a jealous God Amen
[1:13:00] visit the iniquity of the fathers upon
[1:13:02] the children unto the third and fourth
[1:13:04] generation of them that hate me now I
[1:13:06] want you to get back
[1:13:09] the iniquity a man was visited on the
[1:13:12] third and fourth generation so things
[1:13:14] that you do now
[1:13:15] can impact Generations after you
[1:13:20] y'all didn't get it yeah but things you
[1:13:23] the decisions you make right now can
[1:13:25] impact three or four generations not
[1:13:27] just your children but your
[1:13:29] grandchildren and your
[1:13:30] great-grandchildren right amen
[1:13:34] verse six ensure Mercy unto thousands
[1:13:36] amen of them that love me and keep thy
[1:13:39] keep my Commandments verse 7 thou shall
[1:13:41] not take the name of the Lord thy God in
[1:13:43] vain why people don't forgot this
[1:13:45] there's certain curse words that people
[1:13:47] use that take the name of the Lord in
[1:13:48] vain every day
[1:13:50] and Christians used to be offended by
[1:13:52] that and you know what you know what
[1:13:54] people would actually say don't take the
[1:13:57] lord's name in vain we need to bring
[1:13:59] that back out don't use that type of
[1:14:01] don't you take the lord's name in vain
[1:14:05] thou shall not take the name of the Lord
[1:14:07] thy God in vain for the Lord will not
[1:14:10] hold him Guiltless that taketh his name
[1:14:13] in vain
[1:14:16] verse 8 says remember the Sabbath day
[1:14:19] to keep it holy we forgot about that one
[1:14:22] that's why I said I had to go back young
[1:14:24] people the reason that your parents
[1:14:26] would actually get a job where you don't
[1:14:28] have to work on Sundays I encourage my
[1:14:31] kids go to Chick-fil-A
[1:14:33] work at Chick-fil-A I don't want to work
[1:14:36] there I look that I don't them people
[1:14:38] honor Sunday
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:41] and you never got to worry about trying
[1:14:43] to get time off on Sunday
[1:14:45] hello somebody you never gotta go to
[1:14:48] that job if you need a job go there and
[1:14:50] work they need people you see how long
[1:14:53] them lives be they need people
[1:14:59] but when you're young you can do these
[1:15:01] things honor the Lord remember the
[1:15:03] Sabbath day find a job where you don't
[1:15:05] have to work on Sunday
[1:15:06] and and if you got one that but it
[1:15:08] requires you make sure you let them know
[1:15:10] out now and work on Sundays now I'm
[1:15:12] gonna tell you when you tell them that
[1:15:13] they're gonna try you
[1:15:15] they gonna try you and then they're
[1:15:18] going to schedule for something they're
[1:15:19] going to see what you're gonna do about
[1:15:20] it
[1:15:21] now I got many of of saints in here that
[1:15:23] don't quit jobs any anybody don't quit a
[1:15:25] job because they made you work Sunday
[1:15:27] I got Saints here they don't quit over
[1:15:30] that and you want to know why they quit
[1:15:32] because they honoring this
[1:15:38] remember the Sabbath day keep it holy
[1:15:40] and I can go a little further with that
[1:15:42] because back in the day y'all know what
[1:15:44] the Sabbath day keep it holy you can do
[1:15:46] nothing
[1:15:49] you didn't go out
[1:15:51] you you stay home you just went to
[1:15:54] church any y'all from them days that's
[1:15:57] what keep it holy men you didn't do
[1:15:59] nothing you didn't go to work you didn't
[1:16:00] you didn't play either
[1:16:03] go outside and play I'm Not the day not
[1:16:07] today you don't go outside and play on
[1:16:09] Sunday that's the way it was when I was
[1:16:12] coming up we had to keep it holy
[1:16:15] now if you can't keep a day holy how
[1:16:18] you're gonna keep the rest of you only
[1:16:23] remember the Sabbath day keep a holy six
[1:16:25] days shall thy labor and do all
[1:16:27] by work
[1:16:30] verse 10
[1:16:32] says the next
[1:16:35] for the seven days of Sabbath day is the
[1:16:38] Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou
[1:16:40] shalt not do any work thou nor thy son
[1:16:42] nor thy daughter thy man's servant nor
[1:16:45] thy mate servant nor that cattle nor
[1:16:46] that stranger that is within thy Gates
[1:16:48] so as a father I mean if I'm honoring
[1:16:51] the Sabbath day I want my kids honored
[1:16:54] I might have to tell you guys to quit
[1:16:56] that job
[1:16:57] as a daddy
[1:16:59] and I have to advise you so we don't
[1:17:01] have to have this argument I know you
[1:17:02] want money in your pocket fill out an
[1:17:04] application
[1:17:06] at Chick-fil-A
[1:17:12] they selling chicken
[1:17:15] they say Hobby Lobby too that's another
[1:17:18] one anybody closed on Sundays go
[1:17:20] straight there
[1:17:22] get you a job
[1:17:24] all right
[1:17:25] amen for in six days the Lord made
[1:17:29] heavens and earth the sea and all that
[1:17:31] in them is and rested the seventh day
[1:17:33] wherefore the Lord blessed to Sabbath
[1:17:35] day and hallowed it
[1:17:39] verse 12 Anna
[1:17:41] thy father
[1:17:44] and thy mother
[1:17:48] that thy days may be long upon the land
[1:17:50] which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou
[1:17:52] shalt not kill
[1:17:53] thou should not commit adultery Thou
[1:17:56] shalt not steal
[1:17:58] Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:18:00] against thy neighbor these are the Ten
[1:18:03] Commandments that God gave us to live by
[1:18:05] and we're still living by them
[1:18:08] amen we still honor God in all of these
[1:18:12] ways
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:14] a reminder
[1:18:16] next
[1:18:19] I believe
[1:18:23] in anything that helps the human race is
[1:18:26] Godly
[1:18:28] I'm just reading the underlying part
[1:18:30] because you already read the rest of it
[1:18:32] you got to look at anything
[1:18:35] sensible I was thinking through this
[1:18:39] this sermon and I was kind of talking
[1:18:43] um with uh my mom my wife and my uh my
[1:18:46] sister and I was just saying you know
[1:18:48] just as a pastor you know I know that
[1:18:51] these things in scripture and just over
[1:18:53] the years uh listening to different
[1:18:55] people preach you know on sermons like
[1:18:57] this
[1:18:58] oftentimes I couldn't find a good
[1:19:00] practical way to uh uh apply what was
[1:19:03] being preached I know the Bible say this
[1:19:06] but how does that what does that look
[1:19:08] like practically and then you know what
[1:19:10] are like some things that I could do in
[1:19:13] order to make that live right and um you
[1:19:17] know and then just listen different
[1:19:18] different different ministers I never
[1:19:20] really got that so what I what I this
[1:19:22] quote kind of set me free because I
[1:19:25] realized that I wasn't just limited to
[1:19:27] just looking at the message
[1:19:30] to try to find out to how to apply
[1:19:32] there's other people that focus on this
[1:19:35] there's Ministries like like when it
[1:19:36] comes to family Ministries y'all know Dr
[1:19:38] James Dobson that man that man had that
[1:19:41] that's what God gave him that's his lot
[1:19:43] and uh and focus on the family if if
[1:19:46] ain't none of y'all ever heard it before
[1:19:48] I know I have and it was a help to me
[1:19:51] when I was raising kids when I put on
[1:19:54] Adventures in Odyssey
[1:19:56] y'all ain't gonna talk to me but it's
[1:19:59] the truth I bought CDs
[1:20:03] I bought the CDs I would put them in
[1:20:07] that car and I let them kids go down the
[1:20:09] street for hours just listening to
[1:20:10] Adventures enough they knew the address
[1:20:12] by the heart of that place
[1:20:17] they they it helped and they were Godly
[1:20:21] lessons that just they helped praise the
[1:20:24] Lord somebody right you know so so
[1:20:26] sometimes there's people out there that
[1:20:28] that might they study these things they
[1:20:30] that's their focus and and you can
[1:20:32] gather information from them all I tell
[1:20:36] you to do is that when you get
[1:20:37] information always filter it
[1:20:41] filter it through the message
[1:20:44] right and if you can filter through the
[1:20:46] messaging you know you got yourself
[1:20:48] something good just
[1:20:53] look at things sensibly
[1:20:57] we got some sensible things that we want
[1:20:59] to look at today here this next uh who
[1:21:03] is from a gentleman by the name he I was
[1:21:06] just looking at his name is Tim Challis
[1:21:08] I don't know him I just happen to be
[1:21:11] read some information online and I like
[1:21:13] what I was reading his name Tim Charles
[1:21:14] now somebody else might go dig this man
[1:21:16] up and say brother Jack you know Tim
[1:21:18] challenge is distant no I don't know I
[1:21:21] didn't know that but it did have some
[1:21:23] good information
[1:21:24] praise the Lord
[1:21:26] he wrote a little article about six
[1:21:28] practical practical ways to honor your
[1:21:31] parents and he he quoted from a
[1:21:34] gentleman by the name of Tim Kelly says
[1:21:36] as Tim Keller says it's respect for
[1:21:38] parents that is the basis for every
[1:21:42] other kind of respect
[1:21:44] and every other kind of authority
[1:21:47] can I put it this way if your kids won't
[1:21:49] respect you they ain't gonna respect
[1:21:52] their teachers if your kids won't
[1:21:55] respect you they ain't gonna respect
[1:21:57] they boss if your kids won't respect you
[1:22:01] they ain't gonna respect the pastor
[1:22:04] and then respect starts at home and you
[1:22:07] got to keep your children in check
[1:22:11] exactly
[1:22:13] right respect starts at home
[1:22:17] and it starts when they real young
[1:22:20] don't wait for them to get old to try to
[1:22:22] establish some respect when they Young
[1:22:24] no no make sure they understand no
[1:22:27] that's right yeah amen we haven't we
[1:22:30] have a responsibility right I mean kids
[1:22:33] now they they you know uh they go
[1:22:35] against the police and against Authority
[1:22:37] against I mean it's
[1:22:40] it's it's a messed up world
[1:22:44] so respect for parents that is the basis
[1:22:48] for every other kind of respect
[1:22:50] and every other count of authority the
[1:22:52] next statement says we are to honor our
[1:22:55] parents in childhood and adulthood
[1:23:02] I like what this man's saying for we owe
[1:23:04] them a debt of Honor That Never Ends
[1:23:08] some of the things we're going to talk
[1:23:09] about today is for childhood and
[1:23:11] adulthood
[1:23:12] all right the next one says uh I
[1:23:14] understand that in some cases showing
[1:23:16] honor may be very difficult
[1:23:18] or very nearly impossible
[1:23:22] we want to talk about that today
[1:23:25] so how do we honor how do we on the
[1:23:26] first one says
[1:23:28] speak well of them
[1:23:31] the next one says
[1:23:33] seek their wisdom
[1:23:38] third one says esteem them
[1:23:41] publicly and privately
[1:23:47] the fourth one is uh oh uh miss my t
[1:23:51] support them
[1:23:53] support them support them support them
[1:23:55] is what I meant to say but support them
[1:23:58] the fifth one is
[1:24:02] forgive them
[1:24:07] and then the sixth one is
[1:24:11] provide for them
[1:24:15] six practical ways that you can honor
[1:24:19] your parents and you know I'm not just
[1:24:21] gonna leave six things sitting there
[1:24:23] like that for y'all we're gonna dig in
[1:24:26] y'all ready
[1:24:31] speak well of them
[1:24:33] Exodus 21 and 17 says
[1:24:36] he that curseth his father or his mother
[1:24:40] shall surely be put to death
[1:24:42] so according to scripture we weren't
[1:24:44] supposed to speak ill things about our
[1:24:46] parents
[1:24:47] now sometimes it's okay to tell the
[1:24:49] truth brother Brandon had to tell the
[1:24:50] truth about his daddy his daddy was a
[1:24:52] drunk and he had to tell this is my
[1:24:55] family history it's but but he also was
[1:24:57] saying but I love my daddy
[1:25:03] the next verse here in proverbs 30 and
[1:25:06] 11 says there is a generation that curse
[1:25:09] of their father
[1:25:11] and doth not bless their mother
[1:25:14] you are living in a day where that
[1:25:16] happens quite often so it's spirits that
[1:25:19] you're fighting
[1:25:20] here the next verse says in Leviticus 29
[1:25:22] for everyone that curseth his father or
[1:25:25] his mother shall be surely put to death
[1:25:27] he that cursed his father's mother his
[1:25:30] blood shall be upon him now hearing this
[1:25:32] message brother Brandon preaches it
[1:25:33] right here in West Palm Beach it says
[1:25:35] but when I was just a little lad
[1:25:38] he met my mother my mother's from uh
[1:25:40] Paris Texas my father was from Kentucky
[1:25:42] and so my dad was there breaking horses
[1:25:45] when he uh in a rodeo when he got when
[1:25:48] he met mother and so they were married
[1:25:50] and mama was only 15 years old when I
[1:25:52] was born she was just a kid and pop was
[1:25:55] 18. but I but I used to want to be like
[1:25:58] my daddy I just loved my daddy he wasn't
[1:26:03] a Christian until a little bit before he
[1:26:05] died I led him to Christ but he was
[1:26:08] Irish through and through and a real
[1:26:09] Drinker and no matter what he did hello
[1:26:12] somebody no matter what he did I don't
[1:26:14] care what he did he's my daddy anyhow I
[1:26:17] like that and brother Branham had a dad
[1:26:19] at one time that took him out amen with
[1:26:22] some other another man and I think there
[1:26:25] was going fishing or going somewhere and
[1:26:26] and the man pulled out a bottle and
[1:26:28] offered it to uh brother Brown's father
[1:26:30] so you know you want to take a drink and
[1:26:32] um and then um uh while they're sitting
[1:26:35] there passing that bottle they offered
[1:26:36] it to brother Branham and uh and and and
[1:26:39] his daddy said uh you know he's the he's
[1:26:42] the only one my boys that don't drink or
[1:26:44] something like that he said he he the
[1:26:46] only
[1:26:47] his daddy call him assist brother Adam
[1:26:51] said give me that pop he took it but
[1:26:53] conviction came home he was not able to
[1:26:55] drink that drink even though his daddy
[1:26:57] called sister hello I'ma say this
[1:27:00] because in that day he could call him
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:03] and brother Bill Branham didn't get
[1:27:05] offended by what his daddy said but
[1:27:07] nowadays if a dad says something like
[1:27:09] that to his son
[1:27:10] Hallelujah there's an offense taken but
[1:27:14] but here brother Branham had to resolved
[1:27:16] that no matter what my daddy has done
[1:27:20] I still love him
[1:27:22] he's my dad I don't care what he's done
[1:27:24] he's my dad anyhow and that's the
[1:27:26] attitude that young people this is my
[1:27:28] dad you respect I I I was not raised by
[1:27:32] my biological father
[1:27:34] I wasn't raised I was raised by a
[1:27:36] stepfather but I learned throughout my
[1:27:38] years that I still had to have respect
[1:27:40] for the man that brought me into this
[1:27:43] world and one day I had a chance to just
[1:27:45] sit down and talk to him and he started
[1:27:47] going through some things and going and
[1:27:49] this happened I said a little little I
[1:27:51] don't even need to know about all that
[1:27:52] it's too late for that right now so but
[1:27:54] I'm gonna tell you something I I respect
[1:27:55] my step daddy because he's the one that
[1:27:58] put food on the table and got me and
[1:28:00] made me the man that I am right now it
[1:28:02] was him that did that I always respect
[1:28:05] him
[1:28:06] I say but I respect you because you're
[1:28:09] the one that brought me into this world
[1:28:11] and when he died
[1:28:14] I was the one that had to go preach his
[1:28:16] funeral I actually had to preach my step
[1:28:18] daddy and my my my biological father's
[1:28:20] funeral within a matter of 30 days
[1:28:25] and and I wasn't my my biological I was
[1:28:28] on his deathbed and I wasn't even
[1:28:29] planning to even go see him like well I
[1:28:31] don't know you know what I can do from
[1:28:33] here and it was my stepdad that came
[1:28:35] here so you need to go see your dad
[1:28:38] and I'm sitting there ready to tell him
[1:28:40] my daddy is here
[1:28:43] he's no no no no no you need to go see
[1:28:46] your daddy
[1:28:49] and because he said it my boss had told
[1:28:52] me the same thing I told my boss no I'll
[1:28:53] be to work tomorrow
[1:28:56] but because my my daddy said it
[1:28:59] it meant a little bit more a little bit
[1:29:02] more weight dropped I mean I got a
[1:29:03] ticket real quick went up to Alabama saw
[1:29:05] my daddy and
[1:29:08] got a chance to see him before he passed
[1:29:09] away and I thank God
[1:29:12] thank God when I got there didn't know
[1:29:14] his church wasn't going to bury him or
[1:29:15] nothing they didn't want nothing to do
[1:29:16] with him because he was living in sin
[1:29:19] I say it just so happened your son is
[1:29:21] preaching
[1:29:22] and I can bury you
[1:29:26] and I would have been preached psalm 23.
[1:29:33] hey Hallelujah
[1:29:35] all of them speak well of them speak
[1:29:38] well of them all right next
[1:29:43] seek there wisdom
[1:29:45] she's looking at this in the Book of
[1:29:47] Proverbs 24 times you will see a man in
[1:29:51] that book where Solomon uses the word my
[1:29:54] son my son my son
[1:29:56] amen and this gentleman you know Tim
[1:29:59] Challis they made a statement here when
[1:30:01] we honor our parents when we seek their
[1:30:03] wisdom
[1:30:04] uh uh uh through life's twists and terms
[1:30:08] uh the Bible constantly Associates you
[1:30:11] youth with a Folly and age with wisdom
[1:30:14] and tells us that those who have lived
[1:30:16] longer lives have generally accumulated
[1:30:18] greater wisdom so this is why you want
[1:30:21] to seek their wisdom here Proverbs 1 8
[1:30:23] says my son
[1:30:25] here the instruction of thy father and
[1:30:28] forsake not the law of thy mother now I
[1:30:31] know I say my son but you can also put
[1:30:33] my daughter in there too Proverbs
[1:30:35] chapter 3 verse 1 through 2 the next one
[1:30:37] says my son or my daughter forget not my
[1:30:40] law but let thine heart keep my
[1:30:43] Commandments I'm trying to tell you
[1:30:46] something amen for the length of days
[1:30:48] and long life and peace shall they add
[1:30:50] to thee amen the next one in Proverbs
[1:30:52] this is where we see him talking to a
[1:30:54] daughter amen proverbs 31 29-30 but now
[1:30:57] she's this daughter has grown up to
[1:30:59] become a wife
[1:31:00] many daughters have done virtuously now
[1:31:03] before she could be somebody's wife she
[1:31:05] had to be a good daughter at home
[1:31:07] many daughters have done virtuously but
[1:31:10] thou Excellence them all favor is
[1:31:13] deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman
[1:31:16] that theareth the Lord she shall be
[1:31:19] praised and let me tell you her fear
[1:31:21] don't start when she get married
[1:31:25] a woman that fears the Lord she starts
[1:31:28] that relationship with God in her daddy
[1:31:30] and mama's house
[1:31:32] she she she she builds that character
[1:31:35] underneath their roof with she can be
[1:31:37] obedient to her parents it'll be much
[1:31:40] easier for her to also if she can
[1:31:42] subject herself to her parents it'll be
[1:31:45] easier to subject herself to her husband
[1:31:50] all right
[1:31:54] brother Brandon says this in the message
[1:31:55] leadership he says the first
[1:31:57] is the mother's kindness
[1:32:00] then the father's word
[1:32:06] and after the mother gives you your
[1:32:07] first step then you look
[1:32:09] to your daddy
[1:32:11] he says all of us do that after mama
[1:32:13] gives the first step you look to your
[1:32:16] daddy for wisdom
[1:32:18] because he's the head of the house and
[1:32:21] he usually not that not that he he's any
[1:32:23] smarter but he's just made a leader
[1:32:26] of his family God put certain qualities
[1:32:28] in that man and as a wife you got to
[1:32:31] pull out those qualities praise the Lord
[1:32:33] out of your husband but God put certain
[1:32:35] qualities in that and and the husband
[1:32:37] certain experiences he gonna go through
[1:32:38] if if the family is in God's order daddy
[1:32:42] going out to work Mama's at home taking
[1:32:44] care of the kids raising the kids daddy
[1:32:46] gonna go through things on the job that
[1:32:48] he gonna learn some lessons
[1:32:50] one of the things daddy should learn
[1:32:52] is that when things get tough on the job
[1:32:56] you know just jump up and quit
[1:33:01] no you don't do that you want to know
[1:33:04] why
[1:33:06] Mouse
[1:33:07] we got mouths of feet so you know you
[1:33:10] have to kind of swallow your pride so
[1:33:13] daddy gonna have to learn some of those
[1:33:15] things and then when it's time for the
[1:33:17] kids to come up I just had this happen
[1:33:18] amen just the other day my my son-in-law
[1:33:21] he was man he was worked up about a
[1:33:23] little something he come to the house
[1:33:24] and and uh and he was he had a client
[1:33:27] and the client was having him do this
[1:33:29] and have him do that but he wanted to do
[1:33:30] this his passion was just showing off
[1:33:32] through it and uh and as he was going
[1:33:34] and you know he's talking a little bit
[1:33:35] to my wife and I was just listening in
[1:33:37] the other room I heard him I just came
[1:33:39] out there and I said you know what it
[1:33:40] sound like to me is that he just wants
[1:33:42] you to take his money that's all he want
[1:33:44] he just he don't want your ideas he just
[1:33:48] want to give you money
[1:33:50] yeah
[1:33:51] push your ideas to the side and take the
[1:33:54] man money
[1:33:58] that's why he just want to pay you
[1:34:00] he don't he don't need no input he just
[1:34:02] even if it don't work he still want to
[1:34:04] pay you that's good you know what you
[1:34:07] got miles to feed
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:11] don't quit don't quit take the money
[1:34:13] smile and take the money
[1:34:17] one day you'll get a chance to share
[1:34:19] your ideas
[1:34:21] but now you need to swallow your pride
[1:34:24] and take the money
[1:34:27] and when I said that to my son-in-law he
[1:34:29] said you know what I just weren't
[1:34:30] looking at it like that Mr Jack I didn't
[1:34:33] I didn't I didn't see it that way thank
[1:34:34] you for sharing certain things Daddy go
[1:34:37] through that he can share
[1:34:39] with this family that'll help them but
[1:34:41] you gotta you got to be open to
[1:34:42] listening to Daddy my son hear the
[1:34:45] instructions
[1:34:48] I'm just telling you just to tell you
[1:34:50] I've been through this
[1:34:53] been through this
[1:34:55] this is how I became a man
[1:35:03] then you look to your daddy all of us
[1:35:04] for wisdom because he's the head of the
[1:35:06] house and he usually not that he's any
[1:35:09] smarter but it's just made a leader of
[1:35:10] his family so we follow what our daddy
[1:35:12] says do when he says now son I would
[1:35:14] like for you to do a certain certain
[1:35:15] thing
[1:35:16] then we listen to him because it's
[1:35:19] wisdom that we listen
[1:35:23] now I'm you know when we were coming up
[1:35:26] we lived in you know lived in the house
[1:35:28] my daddy had lawnmowers and we had to
[1:35:30] cut that grass that was just part of
[1:35:32] living there you you living here you you
[1:35:35] help out here
[1:35:37] chores our responsibilities that you
[1:35:40] make sure your kids have chores make
[1:35:43] sure they do their chores make sure
[1:35:44] there's punishments if they don't do it
[1:35:48] but when they get of age also set
[1:35:50] yourself uh give them some money for an
[1:35:52] allowance
[1:35:53] put some money in their pocket teach
[1:35:55] them how to pay tax if they get ten
[1:35:56] dollars put a dollar in times
[1:35:59] teach them how to pay tithes at a very
[1:36:01] young age then they won't struggle when
[1:36:03] they get older
[1:36:05] amen and I ain't got no responsibility
[1:36:07] to teach them how to pay times
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:12] my dad used to have us doing different
[1:36:14] things and you know I used to cut that
[1:36:15] grass and get out there we had to learn
[1:36:17] how to cut that grass different
[1:36:18] lawnmowers we have we have to learn how
[1:36:19] to do it and I got to the point where he
[1:36:21] said now when I get older
[1:36:24] I'ma live in a neighborhood where they
[1:36:27] gonna take care of this for me
[1:36:29] so I don't have no lawnmower in my in my
[1:36:32] house I complain when people don't come
[1:36:35] cut
[1:36:39] that's that's just the way I want it to
[1:36:41] live
[1:36:44] now if our Lord would have blessing with
[1:36:45] sons I might have been a different story
[1:36:47] because I had to teach them some things
[1:36:48] but I want to put my girls out there
[1:36:51] like they got other things to take care
[1:36:52] of amen
[1:36:58] amen said I'd like for you to do a
[1:37:00] certain certain thing then we listen to
[1:37:01] them because it's wisdom we listen see
[1:37:03] he's learned a whole lot we got to ask
[1:37:05] him to see what he learned and then we
[1:37:08] can profit by by his what he's learned
[1:37:11] he tells us now don't go and do this
[1:37:13] because I did that my father told me not
[1:37:16] to do it but I did it and it caused this
[1:37:18] to happen to me something bad so we see
[1:37:21] well then daddy tells us how to do and
[1:37:24] what to do right so you got your mama
[1:37:27] and you got your daddy Mama there uh
[1:37:29] with a kindness sweetness of gentleness
[1:37:32] but just you go to your daddy to get
[1:37:33] some wisdom to get some advice from
[1:37:35] things amen from him things that not to
[1:37:38] do and what to do your daddy can get in
[1:37:40] about especially when they come to work
[1:37:42] all right
[1:37:44] um
[1:37:47] this says esteem them publicly
[1:37:50] and privately
[1:37:51] now just on on the right side I I meant
[1:37:55] to just hold it in but on the right side
[1:37:57] this guy uh Tim Sally said parents long
[1:38:01] to see how they have impacted their
[1:38:03] children
[1:38:04] how their children are a reflection of
[1:38:06] their strengths their values you don't
[1:38:09] realize how important it is to give them
[1:38:11] credit where you can parents want to
[1:38:13] know how they've impacted their own
[1:38:15] children parents need to hear from their
[1:38:17] children
[1:38:18] something good
[1:38:20] not always bad
[1:38:22] you wouldn't let me go to here you
[1:38:24] wouldn't let me go no no no no no no
[1:38:25] what was the good part of that what did
[1:38:29] I save you from there's a minute says
[1:38:31] because you didn't let me go here I
[1:38:33] didn't end up in jail
[1:38:35] and you know they had a man they had a
[1:38:38] shooting at that party the other night
[1:38:40] because you didn't let me go thank you
[1:38:43] Mama thank you Dad because you didn't
[1:38:46] let me go I'm still here with you
[1:38:52] parents need to hear that
[1:38:54] because the devil fight us as parents
[1:38:56] like maybe too tough maybe you just make
[1:38:57] no no we try to do the best we can let
[1:39:00] me tell you ain't no book on raising
[1:39:01] children
[1:39:03] somebody said you got the Bible you
[1:39:05] ain't got no children you ain't got no
[1:39:06] children
[1:39:08] I I got the Bible and I'm using the
[1:39:11] Bible but but you know you you also
[1:39:13] dealing with spirits
[1:39:15] right and when you get dealing with
[1:39:17] Spirits you gotta navigate figure out
[1:39:19] how to how to work with this child
[1:39:22] come on somebody

[1:39:28] a lot of eight minutes from the parents
[1:39:29] but the kids wait for me please I can't
[1:39:30] wait for the sermon to be over oh I'm so
[1:39:33] oh Lord
[1:39:41] I I
[1:39:42] told you it was coming how come you're
[1:39:44] one prepared for this
[1:39:47] esteem them publicly and privately
[1:39:52] this this this this gentleman made a
[1:39:59] a statement you can say things like um
[1:40:02] you know everything I I really learned
[1:40:05] about saving money I learned it from you
[1:40:08] you know Dad that was one thing you
[1:40:11] always taught me that I really really
[1:40:12] appreciated
[1:40:13] so these are simple measures but ones
[1:40:15] that bring great joy and honor to your
[1:40:18] parents find something that you can give
[1:40:20] credit to your parents about
[1:40:22] something your daddy did some of your
[1:40:24] mama did find something you can honor
[1:40:26] them with here you know uh I wanna just
[1:40:30] inject this uh
[1:40:33] when it says esteemed in public and
[1:40:35] probably I thought about something that
[1:40:36] happened Amen in our household
[1:40:40] one a couple things that that was a
[1:40:42] blessing to me uh when we were younger
[1:40:44] we didn't understand we were going to
[1:40:46] church but we didn't have no
[1:40:47] relationship with God and Mama just
[1:40:49] gotten saved and man she was sold out
[1:40:51] for God so not for God and I remember
[1:40:54] you know we were uh in the house and it
[1:40:57] was dinner time and why nothing being
[1:41:00] cooked and we're trying to figure out
[1:41:02] what's going on and where's Mama we know
[1:41:04] oh where Mom at and um daddy would never
[1:41:08] tell us where mama was we didn't know
[1:41:09] what mama was like we now the cars out
[1:41:11] there
[1:41:12] where's Mama
[1:41:14] you know and ain't nothing being cooked
[1:41:17] mama daddy that is Mama around what
[1:41:21] where mama at Daddy just want to say
[1:41:24] nothing
[1:41:25] all of a sudden we went outside and I
[1:41:27] don't know how we figured it out we were
[1:41:29] looking at every car we could his mama's
[1:41:31] just in the car mama was in the van
[1:41:34] praying
[1:41:37] something more important than our dinner
[1:41:39] was mama in the van friend and I'm gonna
[1:41:41] tell you this to this day I'm glad I
[1:41:45] caught my mama
[1:41:47] prayer
[1:41:49] some kids catch their mama doing all
[1:41:51] kind of other stuff
[1:41:53] but I caught my mama praying for her
[1:41:57] family
[1:42:00] publicly and privately we esteem our
[1:42:03] parents
[1:42:04] privately we had a moment right before
[1:42:07] my bad pass we were in the hospital
[1:42:11] and um all of us kids that gathered
[1:42:13] around and I told the kids to say hey
[1:42:16] you know what this is an opportunity for
[1:42:18] us my dad is with us we're gonna all
[1:42:20] bless him
[1:42:22] each one of us are going to bless our
[1:42:25] father before he leaves this and I mean
[1:42:28] he was alert he could hear us and I said
[1:42:30] we're going to start from the oldest to
[1:42:31] the youngest but each person can get a
[1:42:34] chance just to bless Daddy tell him what
[1:42:36] you appreciate him for so when my daddy
[1:42:39] goes on the other side he gonna go with
[1:42:40] a big smile his children
[1:42:44] appreciated him
[1:42:46] and my brother Troy started out the
[1:42:48] blessing he he let it flow and then I
[1:42:51] came next and then my sister Gina then
[1:42:52] my sister Trina then my youngest brother
[1:42:54] Vaughn all five of us right there around
[1:42:57] his bed just blessing him
[1:43:00] that's peace you leave this you leave
[1:43:02] this earth with peace when things like
[1:43:05] that so we esteemed him publicly asking
[1:43:09] him publicly and privately
[1:43:13] brother Branham says this in the message
[1:43:15] Mother's Day says but I might pass just
[1:43:17] along to the young people
[1:43:19] do you know Abraham Lincoln never owned
[1:43:21] a book in his life until he was after 21
[1:43:24] years old but the Bible and the fox book
[1:43:26] of the martyrs
[1:43:28] see what you read molds the character
[1:43:31] that you are
[1:43:32] no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics
[1:43:34] today little old fiction magazines and
[1:43:37] vulgar nonsense is placed upon our
[1:43:40] newsstands he owned the Bible and the
[1:43:43] fox's book of Martyrs look what it made
[1:43:47] him now now when brother Rams say look
[1:43:48] what it made him because now notice this
[1:43:50] the fox book of Martyrs is telling the
[1:43:52] story of people that were martyred for
[1:43:55] their faith
[1:43:57] Abraham Lincoln lost his life
[1:44:01] for what he believed
[1:44:03] he believed that no man should be a
[1:44:04] Slave
[1:44:06] and he stood up for he stood up stood up
[1:44:08] against it stood up for it and what he
[1:44:10] did he ended up losing his life over but
[1:44:12] he was shaped by what he read the Bible
[1:44:14] and Fox's book of marks
[1:44:18] look what it made him but in the face of
[1:44:21] all that one day he made a statement
[1:44:22] like this is if there could be any good
[1:44:24] thing found in me this is him publicly
[1:44:27] esteeming his mother if there's any good
[1:44:31] thing found to me it's because of a
[1:44:34] Godly mother
[1:44:35] that reared him to serve the Lord you
[1:44:38] know I oftentimes on the job when I was
[1:44:42] working I see a lady coming amen I'll
[1:44:45] always hold the door open for that lady
[1:44:47] I always hold the door and nowadays
[1:44:49] people open the door and they you know
[1:44:51] somebody coming right behind you and you
[1:44:53] just let the door close enough and I
[1:44:55] don't let you see him with stuff in
[1:44:56] their hand trying to trying to get you
[1:44:58] just let the dough close in their face
[1:44:59] no I I would hold the door open
[1:45:03] I hold the door open and and also said
[1:45:05] you know you're a real gentleman I said
[1:45:06] you know what it's because of the way my
[1:45:08] parents raised me
[1:45:12] we use terms like yes sir and yes ma'am
[1:45:16] oh
[1:45:21] you ain't old enough
[1:45:23] to call me by first name
[1:45:30] put a brother on that
[1:45:33] put a sister on that
[1:45:36] but don't you ever call me by first name
[1:45:38] and you way younger than me
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:45] hello
[1:45:47] put a brother on that I got scripted for
[1:45:50] that the scripture actually tells us to
[1:45:51] call each other brother and sister it
[1:45:53] tell us that in the Bible right but but
[1:45:55] but but young people now they just thank
[1:45:57] you on the same level you just called No
[1:45:59] you don't do that we use Mr and Mr and
[1:46:03] Mr and missing and yes sir and yes ma'am
[1:46:05] we use that language that's the way our
[1:46:07] parents and then you get some people say
[1:46:09] now don't make me feel old by saying and
[1:46:12] all you guys say look I was just trained
[1:46:15] this way I'm sorry I cannot call you
[1:46:17] about first give me a nickname to call
[1:46:19] you but I will not call you by your
[1:46:21] first name because I respect you as my
[1:46:24] Elder
[1:46:26] so you're gonna have to give me a
[1:46:27] nickname
[1:46:29] because I can't do that I just I can't
[1:46:31] do it I can't call you and
[1:46:34] like brother brother Quentin tell you
[1:46:36] can't call them they unless you see a
[1:46:38] husband and wife
[1:46:39] them came to I need to I need to see
[1:46:42] somebody
[1:46:44] thank you
[1:46:48] but be respectful when you're talking to
[1:46:50] adults
[1:46:52] brother sister
[1:46:56] Mr okay uh you make me sound like my
[1:46:59] daddy so I'm sorry you sound like well
[1:47:01] you you really are your daddy but
[1:47:04] um I just got to call you something
[1:47:06] respectful
[1:47:07] your first name I know that's your name
[1:47:09] but to me it's not respectful and I just
[1:47:11] cannot do that to you
[1:47:14] it's steam them publicly and privately
[1:47:16] let's keep going
[1:47:19] this says
[1:47:21] support them
[1:47:24] support them
[1:47:34] this
[1:47:36] is not just Financial
[1:47:39] this is
[1:47:41] honor our parents by giving them the
[1:47:44] assurance that we will not forsake them
[1:47:47] in their old age
[1:47:50] honor your parents by assuring them now
[1:47:52] you know Mom and Daddy you get old imma
[1:47:54] be there to take care of you I'm gonna
[1:47:56] make sure you're taking care of don't
[1:47:58] you took care of me I'ma make sure you
[1:48:00] taken care of
[1:48:01] they uh they have this the statement
[1:48:04] this man said here says when we are
[1:48:06] young we gain strength and long for
[1:48:07] Independence our parents raise us to be
[1:48:09] strong and free but there's a trade-off
[1:48:11] here a passing of the Baton but as our
[1:48:14] parents age they become feeble
[1:48:16] they begin to lose their independence we
[1:48:20] honor our parents by giving them the
[1:48:21] assurance that we will not forsake them
[1:48:23] in their old age just as they care for
[1:48:25] us we will care for them this is our
[1:48:28] responsibility and it ought to be our
[1:48:30] joy
[1:48:32] not just a responsibility it should be a
[1:48:34] joy for you to take care of your parents
[1:48:36] let me tell you something when you was
[1:48:37] coming up me and all them diapers oh my
[1:48:41] day one complaining they just got you
[1:48:43] the diapers
[1:48:44] now when your parents get older you know
[1:48:46] what they may need diapers
[1:48:50] it's the truth in it high
[1:48:52] I work in this field
[1:48:56] it's the truth in how your parents maybe
[1:48:58] and it needs to be a joy for you to be
[1:49:00] able to provide for your parents let me
[1:49:03] tell you something right now you need to
[1:49:04] start working right now
[1:49:06] saving your money now because you don't
[1:49:10] know what you're gonna face later
[1:49:13] you're going to be working for your
[1:49:14] family
[1:49:15] and your parents
[1:49:17] there was a time that your parents
[1:49:19] worked for you and them and then when
[1:49:22] you got married they were still
[1:49:23] supporting you
[1:49:31] should be a joy
[1:49:33] and they made the statement at a time
[1:49:34] when millions of elderly adults are
[1:49:36] living alone consigned to nursing homes
[1:49:38] and hospitals cared for by professionals
[1:49:41] rather than family members
[1:49:46] Christians have the opportunity to
[1:49:47] displace special honor
[1:49:49] a man by the name of Kent Hughes says
[1:49:51] that even if parents have no financial
[1:49:53] needs
[1:49:54] there's still a Christian obligation for
[1:49:57] Hands-On Loving Care
[1:49:59] nurses may be employed
[1:50:01] but there must be more
[1:50:04] the care cannot be done by proxy
[1:50:07] emotional neglect and abandonment is not
[1:50:10] an option for such conduct is worse than
[1:50:12] an unbeliever
[1:50:15] so you just don't leave them to in a
[1:50:17] nursing home to take care of them and I
[1:50:19] see this so often kids don't want
[1:50:21] nothing to do with their parents all
[1:50:23] they waiting on is a will to be executed
[1:50:29] but it should be an honor for you to be
[1:50:32] there somehow to support your parents
[1:50:33] and and now we live in a world where you
[1:50:36] know we spread out all over the world
[1:50:38] it's hard to be home but you can send
[1:50:40] some money
[1:50:41] you can do something to make sure to
[1:50:43] make sure they are taken care of you are
[1:50:45] remember the little fella uh I think he
[1:50:48] was in India and his mom was at home and
[1:50:50] you know and uh and he was uh uh uh uh
[1:50:54] you know he was the way I think in Bible
[1:50:56] School something like that in India but
[1:50:57] uh but I forget what it was he was just
[1:51:00] the way and uh he was he was there and
[1:51:02] then the the mama was real poor and uh
[1:51:05] something happened I don't know what
[1:51:06] what happened to her but but somebody
[1:51:07] come out house and do you have anybody
[1:51:09] the sea bicycle yeah I got a son but I
[1:51:11] want to tell him what I'm really going
[1:51:12] through because he over there kind of
[1:51:14] handling all this and well do you ever
[1:51:15] hear from him see yeah he sent me the
[1:51:17] prettiest pictures
[1:51:19] he sent me the prettiest picture but let
[1:51:22] me see these pictures they went looking
[1:51:24] through the lady pictures saying your
[1:51:26] son was understanding you pictures ma'am
[1:51:28] this is money and you're a wealthy woman
[1:51:31] and don't even realize how wealthy you
[1:51:33] are
[1:51:35] this this young man was supporting his
[1:51:37] mama
[1:51:41] John 21 17-18 says he saith unto him the
[1:51:46] third time Simon
[1:51:50] son of Jonas loveth thou me Peter was
[1:51:53] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:51:55] third time love has stopped me and he
[1:51:57] said unto him Lord thou knows all things
[1:51:59] thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said
[1:52:01] unto him feed my sheep
[1:52:04] verily verily I say unto thee when I was
[1:52:06] young thou girdest thyself and walk is
[1:52:10] wither thou wouldest but when thou shalt
[1:52:12] be old Thou shalt stretch forth thine
[1:52:15] hand and another shall gird thee and
[1:52:18] carry thee with a thou wouldest not
[1:52:22] age gonna settle in on all of us and
[1:52:24] we're going to need
[1:52:26] somebody it's good to sow good seeds
[1:52:28] right now
[1:52:29] amen because you're gonna need somebody
[1:52:31] later on Isaiah 46 and 4 says and for
[1:52:34] those of you that are in your old age I

[1:53:20] you I will keep you and I'ma talk to
[1:53:23] your children too now

[1:53:28] because you got a confidence in the god
[1:53:30] that you serve he's going to help you
[1:53:31] through this this season you ought to
[1:53:33] look for ways to support
[1:53:36] them

[1:53:39] little bit later on but but just just

[1:54:17] it's not just for children
[1:54:22] it's for the whole church
[1:54:25] when we have somebody that's down and
[1:54:27] out don't just leave it up to their
[1:54:28] children to go and take care of them as
[1:54:30] a church you also need to gather around
[1:54:33] and support
[1:54:35] look at this quote what brother Ramsay
[1:54:37] and I tell you out of the message the
[1:54:39] indictment this is for the church don't

[1:57:50] house and they would clean they they
[1:57:52] didn't need to pay for no cleaners
[1:57:55] have young people in the church
[1:57:58] young sister's here and they would go
[1:58:00] there and they would clean that house
[1:58:04] mom and dad are just volunteering them
[1:58:06] yeah they'll come yeah
[1:58:08] yeah still be right there I'll bring
[1:58:11] them to you
[1:58:13] this is going to have a list ready for
[1:58:17] it and you know what them they didn't
[1:58:19] never complain
[1:58:20] them young sisters went right over there
[1:58:22] and did it and didn't complained they
[1:58:24] probably didn't like it but they didn't
[1:58:25] complain it made them better wise
[1:58:32] man I'm gonna have my wife call your
[1:58:34] parents
[1:58:42] we forget that's so easy to know and
[1:58:44] when it comes to home then we appreciate
[1:58:46] it and when we we must remember others
[1:58:48] appreciate it too and the right family
[1:58:50] I'm sure would appreciate that give me a
[1:58:52] few more minutes
[1:58:54] this one
[1:58:58] sometimes it's hard to honor parents
[1:59:00] because of things that they've done to
[1:59:02] us
[1:59:03] maybe things they said about us
[1:59:05] but this man says a practical way to
[1:59:07] only a parent is to actually forgive
[1:59:09] them
[1:59:12] forgive your daddy
[1:59:16] forgive
[1:59:18] your mama
[1:59:21] forgive
[1:59:24] the Bible says in Mark 11 25 and 26 when
[1:59:28] you stand praying
[1:59:29] forgive
[1:59:31] if you have art against
[1:59:34] any and what that odd is if you have a
[1:59:36] certain thing or something
[1:59:38] if you got that there he says you got if
[1:59:41] you got Aunt amen against any that your
[1:59:43] father also which is the heaven May
[1:59:44] forgive you your trespasses
[1:59:46] but if you do not forgive
[1:59:49] neither will your father which is in
[1:59:51] heaven forgive
[1:59:53] your trespasses and and I want you to
[1:59:56] just understand it it's so important
[1:59:59] um
[2:00:01] this man Tim Charlie says it's not just
[2:00:03] read his statement here
[2:00:05] perhaps the most important way
[2:00:09] we can honor appearances to forgive them
[2:00:12] the fact is there are no perfect parents
[2:00:16] sometimes you look at somebody else
[2:00:18] household and you just think that they
[2:00:19] got it going on but you don't know what
[2:00:22] they're going through in that other
[2:00:23] house you don't live there
[2:00:26] you probably couldn't handle the rules
[2:00:28] the restrictions that was in that other
[2:00:29] house you can't handle your mama house
[2:00:32] you don't want to come to my house
[2:00:38] there are no perfect parents and I'ma
[2:00:41] also add this that no perfect children
[2:00:43] either
[2:00:46] no perfect no perfect parents
[2:00:49] all parents have fallen far short of
[2:00:51] their children's expectations now their
[2:00:53] children's expectations
[2:00:56] and in all likelihood even their own
[2:00:58] expectations so parents even struggle
[2:01:00] with themselves did I do enough did I do
[2:01:02] too much did I do you know we all we all
[2:01:04] we all maybe I should have handled it
[2:01:06] this way maybe we go through all of that
[2:01:08] we I mean I I know I go through it as a
[2:01:12] parent
[2:01:12] but I I but sometime when I'm going
[2:01:15] through that I have to just look myself
[2:01:16] in the mirror say you know what you did
[2:01:17] the very best that you could with what
[2:01:21] you had
[2:01:29] all parents have fallen far show their
[2:01:31] childhood expectations and in all
[2:01:32] likelihood of even their own
[2:01:33] expectations our parents have sinned
[2:01:36] against us
[2:01:37] they have made unwise decisions
[2:01:40] they have they have had unrealistic
[2:01:42] expectations
[2:01:44] they have said and done things that have
[2:01:47] left us deeply wounded parents have done
[2:01:50] that
[2:01:53] now it wasn't that we tried to do that
[2:01:56] we didn't mean to do that right and uh
[2:01:59] but but here's the thing and I know
[2:02:01] young people just get when you said this
[2:02:03] when I was 12. what
[2:02:06] are you still stuck there that's why
[2:02:08] okay I'm sorry can we move on
[2:02:11] right but but oftentimes we get stuck in
[2:02:13] things and look it wasn't that they was
[2:02:15] trying to do that to trying to hurt you
[2:02:17] in some way no they was trying to bring
[2:02:19] something better out of you
[2:02:21] amen but if it hurts you we don't mind
[2:02:23] apologizing
[2:02:25] but amen now you just watch it because
[2:02:27] that that's gonna Circle back around on
[2:02:28] you one day
[2:02:30] amen amen you be ready to apologize too
[2:02:33] because you don't know what it's like to
[2:02:34] be a parent until you become
[2:02:38] a parent
[2:02:41] you don't know nothing
[2:02:43] when I get kids I don't raise them like
[2:02:45] this okay
[2:02:51] and I be waiting
[2:02:53] [Applause]
[2:02:55] oh yes
[2:02:57] and see people people say like
[2:03:00] grandparents become a whole different
[2:03:01] person yeah they do they remember how
[2:03:03] they raised that child and they remember
[2:03:05] the things that child said to them
[2:03:06] remember you said that man now they
[2:03:09] don't remind you they're not gonna tell
[2:03:11] you they just just in the back of their
[2:03:12] mind
[2:03:14] and then you come I can't I don't know
[2:03:17] why little Joseph gonna do this little
[2:03:19] joke
[2:03:27] I know why
[2:03:30] cause a apple don't fall too far from
[2:03:35] the tree
[2:03:37] you don't remember what you took me
[2:03:38] through
[2:03:42] look at them and say did we make it
[2:03:45] you're gonna make it too
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:54] our parents have sinned against us they
[2:03:56] have made unwise decisions they have had
[2:03:57] unrealistic expectations they have said
[2:04:00] and done things that have left us deeply
[2:04:01] wounded for that reason many children
[2:04:03] into adulthood control by anger
[2:04:07] and bitterness
[2:04:11] if you got a child that's into the
[2:04:12] adulthood controlled by anger and
[2:04:14] bitterness
[2:04:16] they find themselves unable to move past
[2:04:18] their parents mistakes
[2:04:21] or their parents sin
[2:04:23] and the only way a child can move past
[2:04:26] their parents mistakes see just talking
[2:04:28] about it online and sharing all your
[2:04:30] feelings and all that you still ain't
[2:04:32] moved past it you don't you don't let
[2:04:33] the whole world know how you feel and
[2:04:36] you're still bitter
[2:04:39] the only way you can overcome that
[2:04:41] bitterness
[2:04:42] is through
[2:04:43] forgiveness
[2:04:45] and actually you know they say the way
[2:04:47] that you can begin sometimes you can and
[2:04:49] maybe a parent might not even be alive
[2:04:50] anymore but you got to forgive them of
[2:04:52] something they did sometimes you just
[2:04:54] called a name out loud mama I forgive
[2:04:57] you
[2:04:58] Daddy I forgive you
[2:05:03] and you don't call them by their first
[2:05:04] name that's disrespect
[2:05:07] she was not my mom did she give birth to
[2:05:10] you
[2:05:10] she was your mama on your birth
[2:05:12] certificate they have mother
[2:05:14] her name is there
[2:05:17] give her honor and respect
[2:05:20] and your daddy too my daddy name wasn't
[2:05:23] on the on the birth certificate yeah he
[2:05:25] was doing something wrong but you still
[2:05:26] know that's your daddy
[2:05:29] all right
[2:05:34] there's a statement that I was thinking
[2:05:36] about here and I I I I didn't
[2:05:40] I'll just I'll throw this out there
[2:05:42] um Joshua too
[2:05:45] uh verse 1 through 21 tells the story of
[2:05:48] Rahab and uh Rahab was a woman we know
[2:05:51] that was a prostitute and she opened up
[2:05:54] the doors to allow the children of
[2:05:56] Israel to come in amen and uh stay in
[2:05:58] her house and she said look I just need
[2:06:00] a token I need something I need
[2:06:01] something that that my family would be
[2:06:03] protected I'll be protected when y'all
[2:06:05] come we know y'all gonna take over the
[2:06:06] city but I just need to know am I going
[2:06:08] to be protected they said put this
[2:06:10] little Scarlet thread out your window
[2:06:11] whoever's in the house gonna be
[2:06:12] protected now the rehab was a young lady
[2:06:16] that was placed into prostitution by her
[2:06:19] daddy and her mama
[2:06:22] but rather than being bitter against her
[2:06:24] dad and her mama when it was time for
[2:06:26] deliverance to come to the house this
[2:06:28] lady had something in her heart that
[2:06:30] would say please let my daddy and mama
[2:06:33] and whoever's in my house be protected
[2:06:35] when y'all come
[2:06:37] see when you forgive them
[2:06:40] you can operate
[2:06:42] like that
[2:06:46] the last one I want to give you today
[2:06:48] provide for them now this where we're
[2:06:52] gonna need your money
[2:06:56] because the Bible tells us
[2:06:58] First Timothy 5 3 and 4 says Anna widows
[2:07:03] that are widows indeed
[2:07:04] but if any widow have children
[2:07:10] not only this now look at this one have
[2:07:12] children
[2:07:14] or nephews
[2:07:17] if a widow got nephews you ain't even a
[2:07:20] child but you're a nephew you connected
[2:07:22] you got money you need to take care of
[2:07:25] the Widow that is not the government
[2:07:27] responsibility and it's not the church
[2:07:29] responsibility that is them children and
[2:07:31] the nephew's responsibility
[2:07:34] some of y'all aunties ought to be happy
[2:07:36] when y'all see the nephews come and get
[2:07:38] them over to the house and read the
[2:07:39] scripts
[2:07:42] any widow have children or nephews let
[2:07:45] them first show piety at home and to
[2:07:48] requite their parents for that is good
[2:07:50] and acceptable before God
[2:07:53] also verse 7 and 8 in the same chapter
[2:07:55] says and these things give uh give in
[2:07:58] charge that they may be blameless but if
[2:08:01] any provide not for his own and
[2:08:02] especially for those of his own house he
[2:08:06] have denied the faith in his verse than
[2:08:09] an Infidel it's the child's
[2:08:10] responsibility you've got to grow up and
[2:08:12] accept responsibility because God needs
[2:08:14] you in a certain place where you can
[2:08:16] take care of your parents when they need
[2:08:18] to be taken care of
[2:08:19] but if you can't take care of yourself
[2:08:21] how you're gonna ever get to the spot
[2:08:23] where you can take care of them
[2:08:26] something happens the process is broken
[2:08:28] but God has an order and let me tell you
[2:08:31] something if you pray this place that
[2:08:32] Lord I want to come in line with your
[2:08:34] order
[2:08:35] I see where the word of God is telling
[2:08:37] me as a young man as a young woman I see
[2:08:40] what the word of God's telling me I want
[2:08:41] to come in line with your order I
[2:08:43] guarantee God will begin to open up the
[2:08:44] doors for you to get the job that you
[2:08:46] need
[2:08:48] and let me tell you you might have to
[2:08:49] start at the bottom
[2:08:51] like everybody else when you're climbing
[2:08:53] the ladder you don't start at the top
[2:08:54] you always start at the bottom to work
[2:08:56] your way up to the top
[2:08:59] someone's got a little bit too proud
[2:09:02] too much pride David some people say I
[2:09:04] ain't gonna never work no fast food job
[2:09:05] is that right
[2:09:07] is that who hired
[2:09:09] you need to get out there and get a fast

[2:09:13] too much pride
[2:09:15] it's just too much pride I ain't gonna
[2:09:16] do this I ain't gonna do that maybe
[2:09:17] that's maybe God wants to work on your
[2:09:19] pride
[2:09:21] you know you can be you can own a fast
[2:09:23] food restaurant

[2:10:53] talked about her she uh she she told us
[2:10:55] that you know I just don't think I'm

[2:11:26] stay there she need to be there in
[2:11:28] support of Mama
[2:11:30] she need to be there but one of the
[2:11:33] brothers acts brother random as they
[2:11:34] were leaving out said what does she mean
[2:11:36] by some of the things she done did
[2:11:39] um that she'll never be able to find a
[2:11:41] husband what what what is you know
[2:11:43] brother Brandon you're a prophet what
[2:11:44] does she do what does she mean by that
[2:11:46] brother Brandon looked at that brother
[2:11:48] say what's under the blood
[2:11:53] what's under the blood God don't even
[2:11:56] show his profits
[2:12:02] but all she need to do is obey and
[2:12:04] subject herself to that word and God did
[2:12:07] send her husband
[2:12:09] don't be just jumping up running trying
[2:12:10] to go here and trying to go there
[2:12:12] but somebody's running for my
[2:12:13] responsibility

[2:12:19] but you're gonna push it off on the
[2:12:20] church that's your responsibility and
[2:12:23] you can't be blessed until you get back
[2:12:25] in the will of God
[2:12:28] now let me tell you something I know
[2:12:29] something else like I said we spread out
[2:12:30] all over all over the world you can
[2:12:33] always send money
[2:12:36] if you can't be there yourself
[2:12:38] and ain't no way you're going to get to
[2:12:40] an age where you say well I know I know

[2:13:12] Daddy I got you
[2:13:14] that's how we honor
[2:13:17] our parents
[2:13:23] one last statement
[2:13:26] I like this I like first the title this
[2:13:28] this sermon I was just telling my wife
[2:13:30] there this morning I figured I didn't
[2:13:31] realize I had a statement closing with
[2:13:34] this this the title but this this uh
[2:13:36] this statement here we have no
[2:13:38] continuancy brother random is actually
[2:13:39] pre that's that's a scripture in the
[2:13:41] book of Hebrews and I'm just sharing
[2:13:43] this with the brother this week that
[2:13:45] that term I used to always kind of
[2:13:46] struggle with man what does that mean
[2:13:47] here we have no continuous City
[2:13:49] what it means simply is nothing lasts
[2:13:53] forever
[2:13:55] no matter what it is it won't last
[2:13:57] forever
[2:13:58] spirit and Truth won't last forever
[2:14:00] but we're going to enjoy it while it is
[2:14:02] here we're going to enjoy it but nothing
[2:14:05] lasts forever let me tell you something
[2:14:07] young people you got good parents
[2:14:08] they're not gonna last forever
[2:14:11] enjoy them while you got them
[2:14:14] you got a good church enjoy while you
[2:14:17] got it sometimes you got a good young
[2:14:19] people group enjoy it while you got it
[2:14:21] because it's not gonna last forever
[2:14:23] things gonna change but enjoy what you
[2:14:26] got while you got it
[2:14:28] look at what brother Rams says and then
[2:14:30] she says young people remember if you're
[2:14:32] fortunate enough today to have a daddy
[2:14:34] and a mother living love them honor them
[2:14:37] the hour will come when you'll think
[2:14:39] they're the greatest people in the world
[2:14:41] now sometimes you look at Mom and
[2:14:42] they're like ah they I got the worst
[2:14:44] person it's gonna come a day you're
[2:14:46] gonna think man I got I had the best dad
[2:14:48] and the best mom

[2:14:53] there though
[2:14:56] the owl you'll think that they're the
[2:14:58] greatest people in the world if you

[2:18:53] Lord amen we see healing begin to take
[2:18:55] place in families
[2:18:58] Lord if they're children that need to
[2:18:59] forgive their parents Lord that their
[2:19:01] children would come to that spot where
[2:19:03] they forgive if parents need to forgive
[2:19:04] their children that the parents will
[2:19:06] come to that spot where they forgive
[2:19:07] them if husbands and wives need to
[2:19:09] forgive each other that they would come
[2:19:10] to that spot where they forgive one
[2:19:12] another for it

[2:19:16] see restoration we want to see
[2:19:17] Deliverance
