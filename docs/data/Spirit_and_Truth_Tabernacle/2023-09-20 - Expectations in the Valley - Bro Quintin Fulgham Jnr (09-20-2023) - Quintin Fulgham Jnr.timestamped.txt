[10:16] foreign
[10:34] [Music]
[10:46] amen amen amen amen I just really really
[10:50] enjoyed the prayer from uh brother Troy
[10:52] our precious brother about uh just
[10:54] coming to church
[10:56] um a lot of times you know
[10:59] um we think church is a is just a place
[11:01] of enjoyment and excitement which is
[11:03] definitely true
[11:05] um but I was I came across a quote when
[11:07] I was kind of dealing with stuff and uh
[11:10] and the prophet that said you know you
[11:13] know David said it was a joy to come
[11:15] into the house of the Lord whether
[11:16] things were good whether things were bad
[11:18] indifference in the church and all that
[11:20] and he said it was a joy to come into
[11:22] the presence of the Lord and it just
[11:24] struck My Soul at that point where I was
[11:26] like I'm not coming to church just to be
[11:28] excited you know we're coming to church
[11:30] to hear from God we're coming to church
[11:31] the communion with God you know a lot of
[11:33] times you know we uh hear the stories of
[11:36] people that got healed uh during the
[11:39] time when the prophet was on Earth not
[11:41] knowing they may have to they may have
[11:43] had to wait it uh lots of services and
[11:46] order for that healing to come through
[11:48] right so and they still pressed on right
[11:52] just to hear the word of God and I
[11:54] believe God sees that and honors it and
[11:57] it's and it's it's something that
[11:58] touches him to kind of you know see us
[12:00] when we're struggling and still trust in
[12:03] him right I believe it brings joy to his
[12:05] heart because it's out of our own choice
[12:08] that we uh we still serve and love him
[12:10] all right so um we're gonna say a prayer
[12:13] and then we're gonna get right into the
[12:14] reading okay
[12:16] Heavenly Father Lord God we come before
[12:18] you Lord bow down O Lord another
[12:20] Wednesday service O Lord God a sacrifice
[12:23] Before You O Lord God Lord in ourselves
[12:26] O Lord God we may be weak O Lord God and
[12:28] worn out from from the battles of the
[12:30] Lord God as the as the days come on O
[12:33] Lord the age we see just gets worse and
[12:35] worse and it can be hard to combat the
[12:38] spirits in this time O Lord God and Lord
[12:40] we know Lord God that it's that all
[12:43] things work for good O Lord God and that
[12:45] you have to plan for us oh Lord God and
[12:47] you allow us to go through these bad
[12:49] times or tough times that we may call
[12:51] valleys oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord
[12:53] It's a purpose oh Lord God behind it
[12:56] it's a purpose behind everything we deal
[12:58] with every struggle that we have oh Lord
[13:00] every every Temptation that comes across
[13:02] the soul lord God every mistake we make
[13:04] O Lord God we may fall sometimes oh Lord
[13:07] the prophet says we sin all we we sin
[13:10] all all the time all day we don't mean
[13:11] to do it oh Lord God but we're weak O
[13:13] Lord God but you allow these things
[13:16] things that happen O Lord Jesus Christ O
[13:18] Lord to show O Lord God that you're the
[13:21] perfect one O Lord God and and that
[13:24] you're looking O Lord God to help
[13:26] strengthen us oh Lord God oh Lord we
[13:28] thank You O Lord Jesus Christ the lord
[13:30] for it's that seed of life that you
[13:32] place in us before the foundation of the
[13:34] world oh Lord Jesus Christ no matter how
[13:37] much we struggle O Lord Jesus Christ
[13:39] what we go through we realize that that
[13:41] seed O Lord God is a direct Part of You
[13:44] O Lord God so whenever we're going
[13:45] through our problems and our trials oh
[13:47] Lord God and we feel shaken or we feel
[13:49] upset little God we know that it's
[13:51] already touched You O Lord God and you
[13:54] don't like to be shaken our Lord God you
[13:55] don't like to be upset oh Lord God you
[13:58] don't like when things are not going
[14:00] smoothly your lord God so you have to
[14:02] respond to it oh Lord God and that's
[14:03] because we were before you we were in
[14:06] you before the foundation of the war of
[14:08] the Lord God Lord help get ourselves out
[14:10] the way of the Lord God that you may
[14:11] give a word O Lord to us O Lord God that
[14:14] may help us overcome O Lord God oh oh
[14:16] Lord God we know that in the overcoming
[14:18] O Lord God there's a blessing on the
[14:20] other side oh Lord God we ask that you
[14:22] touch everything O Lord God touch all
[14:24] the sound tech O Lord God all the people
[14:26] that may be listening in oh Lord God we
[14:28] ask oh Lord God that you would prepare
[14:29] the hearts O Lord to receive the seed of
[14:32] Victory O Lord Jesus Christ and the
[14:34] water with praise O Lord God and we ask
[14:36] it in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[14:37] amen
[14:39] amen so I'll get started right into the
[14:42] message uh God bless you all
[14:44] um this message is a
[14:47] um God kind of I'm kind of one of the
[14:49] preachers where I kind of preach about
[14:52] what I'm going through uh the prophet
[14:54] actually said that he said you know uh
[14:56] you kind of uh the best I guess some of
[14:58] the best message that you can have is
[15:00] things that you've already experienced
[15:01] and that when you hold on to the word of
[15:03] God and get the victory well then you
[15:05] can give it to somebody else and it
[15:07] really means something when you're
[15:08] preaching about it so the title of this
[15:10] message is uh expectations uh in the
[15:13] valley uh so um and it's actually a
[15:15] little series on expectations I want to
[15:18] do so this first one is uh in the valley
[15:20] uh so we're going to go to um we're
[15:23] going to turn to our Bibles to Psalm 23
[15:25] and we're actually going to read verses
[15:27] uh one through four
[15:30] to get a foundation uh on the topic
[15:44] so just wait a little bit
[15:48] I can start reading why she pulls it up
[15:49] as everyone else got there though yeah
[15:51] all right
[15:52] so it says here the Lord is my shepherd
[15:54] I shall not want he maketh me alive down
[15:57] in Green Pastures he leads me beside the
[16:00] Still Waters he restoreth my soul
[16:03] he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness
[16:05] for his name's sake yea though I walk
[16:08] through the valley of the shadow of
[16:09] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[16:11] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[16:13] comfort me and yeah I mean you may take
[16:16] your seats all right
[16:18] um and I love this Bible verse because
[16:21] uh we see in these verses especially in
[16:24] all in verse two David says he maketh me
[16:27] lie down in Green Pastures and he leads
[16:29] Me In the Still Waters and then when we
[16:32] fast forward in the verse it sees that
[16:33] he's walking through the the Valley of
[16:35] the shadow of death and one of the key
[16:37] things about this is that God is with
[16:40] him in those Green Pastures and in those
[16:43] times in the valley where there is uh
[16:45] Evil all about him all right so that
[16:47] actually gives a a
[16:49] um and places emphasis to the believer
[16:51] that we're trusting God in the ups and
[16:54] downs and that we're not just trusting
[16:56] on our own selves to get ourselves out
[16:58] of positional out of a situation or put
[17:00] ourselves into good situations right
[17:03] um and so in the topic of in the valley
[17:07] um valleys are very very interesting
[17:09] places right
[17:10] um and these are places where our faith
[17:13] muscles Flex the most right A lot of
[17:16] times we feel like we're uh we have a
[17:19] lot of good faith when things are going
[17:20] good but that's not or your your faith
[17:23] is being flexed and being tested right
[17:25] it's in The Valleys when your face
[17:27] muscles get flexed and tested when you
[17:29] when you're not even uh you're not even
[17:31] aware of it right so this is the place
[17:34] where you really get to see the uh the
[17:36] uh the uh see the power of God being
[17:38] manifested in your life in a different
[17:40] kind of way right and so the valley is a
[17:42] collection of experiences that are
[17:45] necessary uh for the Christian walk
[17:47] right so the tests and trials that we
[17:49] face it shapes our character
[17:52] um I remember I was um went to the men's
[17:54] meeting last year and this brother uh
[17:57] came up and he was teaching and he said
[17:59] that sometimes when you get sick God
[18:00] just don't heal you right then and there
[18:02] he says he's trying to build some
[18:03] character out of you right so you go
[18:05] through those sick times and I remember
[18:07] I had I had gotten sick on a trip while
[18:09] I had a cruise and I went to Mexico and
[18:11] I came back and I got a stomach bug and
[18:13] it was I've never expect experienced
[18:16] anything like that before and I was on
[18:17] my bathroom floor just hurting right
[18:20] just hurting just calling on God now I
[18:23] know God could have delivered me within
[18:25] a second and that's what makes it even
[18:27] more challenging because we know that
[18:30] God has the power to do things like that
[18:32] but it's trusting him even when he
[18:35] hasn't answered us or responded to us
[18:37] and God's looking to see how are you
[18:39] going to act in that situation right so
[18:41] God is actually looking at you right
[18:44] what why you're why you're expecting
[18:46] your healing while you're expecting your
[18:48] deliverance God's looking to see how are
[18:50] you going to act when I don't say
[18:51] anything so I remember during that time
[18:53] all I could do was just praise God I
[18:55] could just bless his name and it has to
[18:58] come from a place that's not your own
[18:59] flesh it has to come from a place where
[19:02] God has placed something inside of you
[19:04] that regardless of what I'm going
[19:06] through I'm going to praise God I'm
[19:07] going to worship God I don't care how I
[19:09] feel I'm going to trust in him right and
[19:12] then when I got out of that situation
[19:14] and I got better there was such a joy
[19:16] that was such a joy there there was such
[19:18] an accomplishment I felt like man I
[19:20] really trust State God through this no
[19:22] matter what I went through I didn't
[19:24] blame them I didn't get upset because he
[19:26] didn't uh touch me right then and there
[19:28] and he saw me going through but even
[19:32] even though I was going through all that
[19:33] stuff I still had a praise on the inside
[19:35] inside of my soul and I could thank God
[19:37] and so when I got over it it felt like
[19:40] there was if it felt like I accomplished
[19:42] something and I kind of I kind of like
[19:44] to type that to like uh kids getting
[19:46] presents like sometimes you know a
[19:49] killer asked they're paying for
[19:50] something for Christmas time and
[19:52] sometimes they'll put her on the list
[19:54] because back in the day we used to um
[19:55] write all what we want for our uh what
[19:57] the presence that we want for our
[19:59] parents and we give them the list and
[20:01] you're expecting to get those things
[20:02] back and sometimes your parents will
[20:04] actually get the thing that you want the
[20:06] most they'll actually hide it right
[20:08] they'll put it behind the other tree
[20:09] they'll put it behind the tree and
[20:11] they'll put all the other stuff in the
[20:12] front and when you go through and open
[20:13] that stuff and you see that you didn't
[20:15] get the thing that you want most they
[20:16] seen how you want to react and a lot of
[20:19] times some kids get upset that you'll
[20:21] see it in their face crying and wailing
[20:24] and stuff because they didn't get what
[20:25] they want and then the parent still gave
[20:28] it to them but then you have the kids
[20:30] that you know they're appreciative they
[20:33] see all the gifts and they get all the
[20:34] they open up all the gifts they see that
[20:36] they didn't get what they wanted and
[20:38] they still thankful and then God gives
[20:40] it to them so and I love that situation
[20:42] because God is a good father and he
[20:44] still gives gifts no matter how you no
[20:46] matter how you respond to it but we want
[20:49] to be like the ones that are like Lord
[20:51] Lord whether whether it's going good
[20:53] whether I got what I want or not or not
[20:55] I still want to thank you I still want
[20:57] to I still want to bust you because
[20:58] there's there's a greater satisfaction
[21:01] that comes with that and that's the
[21:02] satisfaction I felt when I got healed
[21:04] when he didn't heal me when I was
[21:06] struggling there my stomach was hurting
[21:08] eating humor right there in a second but
[21:09] I still praise him and when I got over
[21:11] it there was a great satisfaction but I
[21:13] trusted God through it all right so it's
[21:16] in those Valley experiences that God
[21:18] that are our faith muscles really get
[21:22] stretched right and God is looking to
[21:24] see how we are going to respond right so
[21:26] and whenever you leave the valley
[21:28] there's always a promotion on the other
[21:30] end right right there's always a
[21:33] promotion on the other end right and
[21:35] this is the difficult part in life when
[21:36] you're going through vials when you're
[21:37] struggling with stuff uh sickness in
[21:40] your body and family situations or uh
[21:42] job situations uh relationships
[21:46] relationships with parents to the
[21:48] parents to the kids the kids to the
[21:49] parents right it's it's it's it's it's
[21:51] it's there can be such a difficulty and
[21:54] it's not easy to get around it right and
[21:56] and that's the problem with man because
[21:58] man we love the easy way out of stuff
[22:00] man loves to take the easy way out uh in
[22:04] order to get a victory right and that's
[22:06] why we struggle during these times
[22:08] because we're expecting the easy Victory
[22:10] we're expecting to go through something
[22:12] without having to have a struggle in
[22:13] order to get our blessing on the other
[22:14] side right so we're going to pull up
[22:17] um I have a quote here from the uh from
[22:19] the prophet um getting to the Spirit uh
[22:22] it's going to be paragraph 28 so we're
[22:24] going to read what the prophet has say
[22:27] about it so he called them Hilltop
[22:28] experiences but Hilltop Mountain Top
[22:30] experiences they're the same thing
[22:32] um
[22:33] so we're going to read read and read
[22:34] what the prophet had to say about this
[22:39] oh I think that may be the wrong year uh
[22:43] wait is that the wrong year
[22:48] 28 yeah I'll go ahead and just read it
[22:50] yep so he says here you know everybody
[22:52] wants a Hilltop experience and they
[22:55] never want to take the valley everybody
[22:57] in the Pentecostal Church too every
[23:00] night if you're not shouting dancing
[23:01] jumping up and down speaking in tongues
[23:03] and running all over the floor or
[23:04] another you don't have any kind of
[23:06] meaning well you know it's all right to
[23:08] be on the Mountaintop that's good but
[23:10] let me tell you your fruits will freeze
[23:12] up there at the night and when the cold
[23:13] spell comes you'll lose all your fruit
[23:16] that's what happens now we put too much
[23:18] on mountaintop experiences of dancing
[23:21] and shaking and jumping around instead
[23:23] of instead of all night prayer meetings
[23:25] see the thing with all night prayer
[23:28] meetings you don't feel like doing it
[23:29] right it's something you don't feel like
[23:31] doing it's something that is not
[23:33] exciting it's something that is not you
[23:34] know when you're when you're in church
[23:36] and you're praising God you're Clapping
[23:37] Your Hands and tapping your feet
[23:39] Everything feels good right but these
[23:41] all night prayer meetings don't feel
[23:43] good because you want to sleep right you
[23:45] want to sleep you may not know what to
[23:46] say but these things as the prophet says
[23:48] instead of all night uh prayer meetings
[23:50] down in the valley of decision these are
[23:53] where your your faith takes root into
[23:56] something so that regardless of how
[23:58] you're feeling regardless of what you're
[23:59] going through you stood on a decision
[24:01] and you're gonna need that when the
[24:03] enemy tries to come to take away uh your
[24:05] blessings right so he continues to say
[24:08] well you have to come down there and
[24:09] meet God and really pour out your life
[24:11] until something takes place he said we
[24:14] have let the we've grown fruits up here
[24:16] right which is good to have the fruits
[24:18] but the freeze kills them those fruits
[24:20] are represent uh the seeds of blessings
[24:22] that God puts inside of your life right
[24:24] he doesn't want you to lose them right
[24:26] because a lot of times you know you have
[24:28] that's why a lot of times parents they
[24:30] don't just give their kids anything and
[24:32] you know and as parents you know when
[24:33] you when you're when your parents when
[24:34] you're uh when your uh your mom or dad
[24:36] tells you to brush your teeth every day
[24:37] it tells you to make up your bed tells
[24:39] you to take out the trash the building
[24:41] up character it's a value to you because
[24:43] you don't feel like doing it but they
[24:45] see in the future that you're going to
[24:47] have a home you're going to have a
[24:48] family you're going to have a wife you
[24:50] may God May bless you oh financially you
[24:53] may have a mansion right and he's giving
[24:55] you the skills necessary in order to
[24:57] keep that thing right he's giving you
[24:59] the skills in order to keep that thing
[25:01] right so he says that's right every time
[25:02] it comes a little cool spell you've got
[25:05] nothing to rest upon when the emotion uh
[25:08] dies down then all the shouts gone and
[25:10] it will go emotions will go emotions
[25:14] come and go and you can't control them
[25:15] in later will figure out where why is
[25:18] that so right the noise ceases and then
[25:21] where you're at the Temptation comes
[25:22] along and then you can't take it right
[25:24] then you can't take it so I like how the
[25:27] prophet uh kind of describes us these
[25:29] Hilltop and Mountaintop experiences and
[25:32] how he puts uh he says that it's good to
[25:34] go through the Mountaintop experiences
[25:35] but he puts an emphasis on those Valley
[25:37] experiences the the routes that we don't
[25:40] want to go right and so and as we could
[25:43] kind of type it uh because it's the
[25:45] spiritual types the natural and we could
[25:47] we could type it physically to a New
[25:49] Year's resolution you know every single
[25:51] year the New Year comes along and people
[25:53] make resolutions or they make words of
[25:56] what they want to accomplish in the year
[25:57] you know some people want to better
[25:58] finances some people want to work out
[26:00] for Better Health some people want to be
[26:01] better in school and all that kind of
[26:04] stuff and so let's say we have a person
[26:06] a and and this person wants to be wants
[26:09] to work out and uh be healthier right
[26:11] make healthy choices right and so now
[26:13] this person is uh Gone on social media
[26:16] hey it's a new year I'm ready to start
[26:18] working out and everything's good and it
[26:21] feels so there's so much excitement and
[26:22] stuff inside of that and and they'll go
[26:24] to the sports store and buy the most
[26:26] expensive clothes they'll go online and
[26:29] order the uh um uh exercise equipment
[26:33] and all that they'll spend all kinds of
[26:34] money right on these things because
[26:36] there's an excitement and they want to
[26:38] do that and then they go out there and
[26:40] let's say they take one lap and they get
[26:42] tired and they say well okay let me stop
[26:44] let me if this is a little tough right
[26:48] it's a little tough let me look let me
[26:49] maybe just kind of ease through that and
[26:52] that's the way man is when a man wants
[26:54] to put themselves through their own
[26:55] Valley experience it's always easy and
[26:58] manageable
[26:59] it's always easy and manageable but the
[27:01] point is nothing gets done afterwards
[27:02] because they end up buying that exercise
[27:04] equipment and all of a sudden it's just
[27:06] sitting in the garage all right they end
[27:09] up buying all this all those expensive
[27:11] workout clothes and don't never touch
[27:12] them again right and it's because they
[27:15] haven't based their choice off of a a a
[27:19] valley a valley decision that I'm going
[27:22] to work out regardless of how I feel
[27:24] regardless if I feel tired regardless if
[27:26] I if if it hurts I'm going to go out and
[27:29] work out it's based off of an emotion
[27:31] right it's based off it's based off of
[27:33] the feeling and that feeling will go
[27:35] away right that feeling will go away
[27:37] right but give that person a seasoned
[27:40] trainer
[27:41] somebody that's trained people and seen
[27:43] them go through all of that somebody
[27:45] that's seen people go through their ups
[27:46] and downs somebody that has seen someone
[27:49] uh try to give up but uh but push them
[27:52] but but was able to motivate them and
[27:54] push them through right then that person
[27:56] now has some encouragement that person
[27:58] now has someone that will hold them
[28:00] accountable outside of themselves right
[28:03] and that's what the holy spirit is for
[28:05] us because we can't do it ourselves we
[28:08] can't worship God ourselves that's why
[28:10] when Peter Well Peter and and his heart
[28:13] and his heart uh when uh Jesus Jesus
[28:16] Christ has said Peter you're going to
[28:17] deny me Peter in this heart said no I'm
[28:19] not I'm not going to deny you I love you
[28:22] too much you're my best friend and it
[28:24] was good intentions but when the trial
[28:26] came and it came to a point where Peter
[28:29] could take a stand for Christ he denied
[28:31] him because there wasn't nothing on the
[28:33] inside right that could help him to
[28:35] stand through the time that no matter
[28:37] what everyone else was talking about
[28:38] because he heard what people were saying
[28:40] right no matter he was going through
[28:42] there was nothing on the inside to
[28:43] Anchor him down and say no no no I'll
[28:45] stand for Christ right and so that's why
[28:47] we need something we need a trainer we
[28:49] need someone that has gone through which
[28:51] is why God doesn't give us any excuses
[28:53] because he seen Daniel in the Lion's Den
[28:56] afraid and and still trusting him right
[28:59] and was able to come and close the uh
[29:01] the mouth of Alliance he seen those
[29:03] three Hebrew children right regardless
[29:05] of what of what the uh the nation has
[29:07] said they weren't going to bow down and
[29:09] that's why God doesn't give us an excuse
[29:11] now because he's already seen his
[29:13] children succeed and he knows that we
[29:15] can do the same exact thing right he
[29:18] knows we can do the same exact thing he
[29:20] has confidence that we can do the same
[29:21] exact thing so he's not going to let us
[29:23] have an easy way out when we need to uh
[29:26] in order to uh get our blessing and I
[29:29] would like to kind of also type it
[29:30] because um I used to play football and
[29:34] um one of the big things about playing
[29:36] football was wearing the jersey that
[29:38] used to be a real real big thing where
[29:39] you would like to wear the Jersey on on
[29:41] game day well um you'll walk around the
[29:44] school so everyone can see the colors
[29:45] that you're wearing it was it was it was
[29:47] a team Pride that was in that but before
[29:49] the season started there was something
[29:51] called pre-season conditioning and that
[29:54] was during the summer time and now is
[29:55] the time when coach was whipping to get
[29:57] you in shape for the season and before
[29:59] you got the jersey and now he'd have you
[30:02] out there just we'd be running in the
[30:04] hot sun and be I mean I've never I've
[30:07] never drank water so fast uh because of
[30:11] what they put us through right and
[30:13] that's a time where if you ain't never
[30:14] seen Roman cry go to a preseason a
[30:17] football preseason for the middle
[30:19] schoolers or high schoolers I'm telling
[30:21] you know you you see them big boys out
[30:22] there just coaching I can't run no more
[30:24] coach I'm tired coach I'm tired and
[30:26] Coach is like nope give me one more lap
[30:28] nope give me one more lap right and
[30:30] because he sees something inside of him
[30:32] and he's trying to push him he's trying
[30:34] to push him into Valley because because
[30:36] uh no one's forcing him to go out there
[30:38] and every single morning with his body
[30:41] more in the bed and my body was sore on
[30:43] the bed we had to make the conscious
[30:44] decision you know what I'm going to come
[30:46] out here and do it again right coaches
[30:48] are forcing you so I had it was in this
[30:50] time of a valley had to we had a
[30:52] decision that uh came up inside of our
[30:54] hearts that we were going uh uh to keep
[30:57] going on because we trusted in what the
[30:59] coach said and that he was going to make
[31:01] us better and then after the season was
[31:03] over after all the complaining and
[31:05] thinking about giving up when a coach
[31:07] gave us our Jersey we can now wear that
[31:10] jersey with pride knowing that we'd gone
[31:12] through right we've gone through and uh
[31:14] we've gone through we trusted the coach
[31:16] we've gone through the valley and now we
[31:18] we're in a condition we're in this we're
[31:20] in a spot where now the coach can use us
[31:22] right now we can get on the field and
[31:24] Coach can use it he can say all right I
[31:25] want you to run this route all right I
[31:27] want you I want you to block I want you
[31:28] to do this and we can see the success in
[31:31] our team right because we've gone
[31:33] through the valley right when we when we
[31:35] hoist up the trophy a lot of people says
[31:37] man you guys are good but what they
[31:38] don't see is that it started in the
[31:40] valley yeah
[31:42] right it started in the valley it didn't
[31:46] just happen they didn't see what we
[31:48] wanted to give up they didn't see when
[31:49] we had an attitude with our coach
[31:51] because of what he was saying but we
[31:53] where we died out to ourselves and said
[31:55] no I'm going to listen to the coach even
[31:57] though I don't feel like it people don't
[31:59] see that they just see the success but
[32:01] the victory started in the valley right
[32:03] so the valley the valley wasn't made for
[32:07] a time of enjoyment right but it was
[32:09] made for a time to prepare you to
[32:11] experience enjoyment once you've gone
[32:13] through it right so Valley is um and I
[32:16] and I like to say this at a valley isn't
[32:18] a time for you to say that uh your uh a
[32:20] time for happiness or excitement and I
[32:22] said this before I don't believe
[32:23] Christians are happy all the time I
[32:26] believe we have joy right I believe we
[32:28] do have joy but we're not happy all the
[32:31] time right see the world expects and
[32:34] that's and that word expect which is in
[32:36] the title of the message and I want to
[32:37] tie these two things together is your ex
[32:40] your expectations can hurt you will harm
[32:42] you see the world expects to be happy
[32:44] all the time right they expect to have
[32:47] happiness and in order to have happiness
[32:49] you have to have something happening you
[32:51] got to have something happening right
[32:53] which is why they engage in stuff
[32:54] they'll drink and after drinking they'll
[32:56] go partying and then when they finish
[32:58] partying they'll go home and they'll
[32:59] binge watch Netflix and then uh the next
[33:02] day they'll go to a sporting event right
[33:03] they're always trying to preoccupy
[33:05] themselves with stuff to keep themselves
[33:07] happy all the time right and that's the
[33:10] carnal mind that's the carnal way but
[33:12] you see when you're in a walk with God
[33:14] sometimes you put you on a path where
[33:16] you won't be happy he put you on the
[33:18] path where you won't feel good you won't
[33:20] feel good at all right and he's trying
[33:22] to bring something out she's trying to
[33:24] bring something out of you right so the
[33:25] carnal mind rejects that but the
[33:28] Christian trusts God that hey even
[33:30] though I'm not happy I don't feel good
[33:32] something's going to come out of this
[33:33] thing right and regardless of it I'm
[33:35] just happy that Lord you're with me I'm
[33:38] happy that you're just speaking with me
[33:40] praise God so expectations they tie hand
[33:45] in hand with faith because it's a strong
[33:47] belief already definition and
[33:49] expectations are a strong belief of
[33:51] something
[33:52] and expectations are a driving force
[33:54] that mankind mankind uses to achieve
[33:57] certain purposes and things right so
[34:00] because man expects food to be ready in
[34:02] instance we created the microwave right
[34:04] we control physics and the laws of fixes
[34:07] to create a microwave so that we could
[34:08] be able to get food right now when we
[34:10] wanted it right a man expects to get to
[34:12] a destination as fast as they can right
[34:15] so we uh we we try to control the
[34:17] situation and environment and the
[34:18] physics and we created cars and trains
[34:21] and airplanes in order for us to get to
[34:23] a destination because we expect to get
[34:25] there uh as fast as possible so
[34:27] expectations are not wrong they're
[34:29] they're naturally a part of us right
[34:31] that God put them inside of us we come
[34:33] into the world expecting things right
[34:34] and just to kind of uh uh kind of show
[34:38] this example um I like to talk about my
[34:41] little sister Zoe back there uh because
[34:43] we um we took the youth on a little trip
[34:46] to the uh Zoo uh the Palm Beach Zoo and
[34:48] we went into this little store where you
[34:51] have all like the little gifts and stuff
[34:52] like that and man you just saw
[34:55] you could tell as soon as though we saw
[34:58] everybody else buying stuff and all the
[35:00] other youth getting treats and all those
[35:02] things and things like that all of a
[35:03] sudden now she's expecting something
[35:06] and she don't know what the word
[35:07] expectation means and I remember that
[35:09] she started crying because she was
[35:11] expecting to receive something too right
[35:14] and so I think uh since adoption got her
[35:16] a lollipop or something and then she
[35:17] stopped crying because her expectations
[35:19] was met right and that's and that's how
[35:22] God and and that's how God likened us
[35:24] because because the prophet said you
[35:26] have to expect from God and we're God's
[35:29] children and when we need something from
[35:31] God we cry right we cry so when you're
[35:34] reading your Bible and you're seeing God
[35:36] bless these people and bless these
[35:38] people and heal these people who are
[35:40] going to different meetings and you're
[35:41] seeing God healed this one you're saying
[35:43] God bless this one and delivered this
[35:44] one you can cry to God and say what
[35:46] about me I'm your child too and God will
[35:49] respond right so it's an ex-patient
[35:51] expectation that God has placed in us
[35:53] but on the same token uh back to Zoe
[35:57] again
[35:58] um you know she's a uh uh I I I love her
[36:02] attitude about things and stuff so uh on
[36:05] the other end of it was always good mood
[36:07] right after service and she's laughing
[36:09] and she's running around and wanting you
[36:11] to chase her and all those things right
[36:13] she's expecting you to play with her
[36:14] right she has an expectation right now
[36:16] that she wants to be out she wants to be
[36:18] out running around doing whatever she
[36:20] wants to do but as soon as daddy picks
[36:22] her up and puts her in a car seat all of
[36:24] a sudden her her her facial face changes
[36:27] all right her face changes because she's
[36:30] expecting to play but you know Daddy's
[36:32] expecting to go so now you have
[36:35] conflicting expectations right you have
[36:39] conflicting expectations and that's
[36:42] where we have to be careful as children
[36:44] of God right because sometimes uh dad
[36:47] god daddy he wants to go somewhere else
[36:49] and we may want to sit around and have
[36:52] fun and all those things and God wants
[36:54] to put us through a valley and all of a
[36:56] sudden now we're having conflicting
[36:57] expectations we have to then yield
[36:59] ourselves to what God wants right and so
[37:03] um Zoe eventually she'll after all
[37:05] crying and stuff like that she'll be
[37:07] okay and it's the same way with us God
[37:09] will let us just sit up there and cry
[37:10] and pouting all that stuff he says I
[37:12] know you're going to go through right so
[37:16] um it's natural for us to have these
[37:17] expectations it's natural for us to
[37:19] expect things in a situations because we
[37:21] all want stuff to be good it's it's the
[37:24] gene that God made us when in the
[37:26] beginning In The Garden of Adam he
[37:28] didn't have any problems right he didn't
[37:30] have any struggles or nothing like that
[37:31] when God cursed the ground and told Adam
[37:34] you're going to sweat Adam didn't know
[37:36] what sweating was
[37:38] I can imagine him like when God came and
[37:40] said yep Adam you're going to sweat and
[37:42] and Adam in his mind's like what is
[37:43] sweat what does that mean right because
[37:46] he never had to struggle for nothing he
[37:48] never had to struggle right so and he
[37:51] expected that every single time he
[37:52] walked in the garden everything was
[37:54] going to be good so it's okay as human
[37:56] beings for us to expect things to go
[37:57] good but now that we're in this uh phase
[38:00] of time God uses valleys to mold
[38:03] character in us in our current state
[38:07] right so I'm going to read this article
[38:09] that I found online uh so Pastor said
[38:12] that if um
[38:13] if it helps the human race you can use
[38:16] it so
[38:18] I'm taking the page from this book so we
[38:21] have this uh this uh believer uh he may
[38:24] I don't know if he's a message believer
[38:25] or not but um he has this blog and we're
[38:28] going to read some of this blog that he
[38:30] wrote and he says your Mountaintop
[38:32] experience or the valley what grows you
[38:33] the most right and so we're going to
[38:35] read some articles out here about
[38:36] talking about the Mountaintop and the in
[38:39] the valley it says both the Mountaintop
[38:41] experience and the valley are important
[38:42] for your spiritual growth the
[38:44] Mountaintop experience is one with
[38:45] extreme felt presence of God I feel God
[38:48] I know God is with me Everything feels
[38:51] good right the valley is the place where
[38:53] our faith is tested with trials and
[38:55] tribulations because of its purpose in
[38:57] our lives right so the Mountaintop
[39:00] experience is something Christians seek
[39:02] after that's what we want that's
[39:04] naturally what we want we don't want to
[39:06] go into a valley right that's the
[39:07] prophet that said when it happens they
[39:09] become excited and zealous for God it is
[39:11] on the Mountaintop we receive revelation
[39:13] God gives us Revelation right God gives
[39:16] us a word before we have to go through
[39:18] the trials and we can see that type of
[39:20] Moses when Moses was on the Mountaintop
[39:21] God said your deliverer God said you're
[39:24] going to go deliver and he ain't faced
[39:26] nothing yet right so he was on the
[39:28] Mountaintop where he received Revelation
[39:29] right and it is where we experience the
[39:31] tangible felt presence of God uh uh uh
[39:34] Moses felt God when when Moses went up
[39:38] to the burning bush to uh to question
[39:39] what it was uh God told him to take his
[39:42] shoes off for you you're standing on
[39:43] Holy Ground so he felt the presence of
[39:45] God he felt the fear of God he felt God
[39:47] near him right but then in the valley
[39:49] when he was standing before the sea that
[39:52] presence wasn't there anymore right that
[39:54] presence wasn't there anymore and then
[39:56] he started to cry and God had to remind
[39:58] them why Christ speak right so this off
[40:00] this often The Mountaintop this often
[40:02] propels us into a greater service for
[40:04] the kingdom and he made a comedy comment
[40:06] he said have you have you ever had the
[40:08] devil
[40:09] create doubt about you about you having
[40:12] an extremely intimate and Powerful
[40:14] experience with God's presence during
[40:16] your Mountaintop experience he starts
[40:18] whispering in you that it's just a fake
[40:20] experience you're just working it up
[40:22] with your emotions right now you're
[40:24] starting to descend into the valley
[40:26] right because now you're starting to
[40:27] question things right so it's so as as a
[40:31] um with these mountaintops and these
[40:33] Valley experiences one of the things
[40:35] that we have to expect uh in this life
[40:38] of having ups and downs is that we can't
[40:41] control our Hilltop experiences and we
[40:43] can't control our Valley experiences we
[40:45] can't control it we can't control when
[40:48] they happen and we can't control how
[40:50] long they last
[40:51] even though that's that's that's
[40:52] automatically uh the default thoughts
[40:55] that we have in our head is okay now I
[40:57] want to be successful or or or now I I
[41:00] and I want to be successful and I want
[41:02] it to last for this long right because
[41:04] if we have the choice and God would go
[41:06] through his economy our mountaintops
[41:08] would outweigh the valleys but we need
[41:10] the valleys most right so we can't
[41:13] control our experiences and we have to
[41:15] expect that first right and we're going
[41:17] to prove it by the scriptures right and
[41:19] we're also going to show how Valley
[41:21] experiences and Hilltop experiences Are
[41:24] Spiritual first and we love that they're
[41:26] spiritual first because it shows that
[41:28] God is leading and God is in control
[41:30] that should give us confidence right
[41:33] that should give us confidence so we're
[41:34] going to turn to job one and we're going
[41:36] to read verses one through five
[41:39] please
[41:41] right so it says there was a man in the
[41:44] land of us whose name was job and that
[41:46] man was perfect and upright and one that
[41:48] feared God in a shoot evil
[41:51] and they were born into him seven sons
[41:53] and three daughters his substance also
[41:55] was seven thousand sheep and three
[41:58] thousand camels and 500 yoke of oxen and
[42:00] 500 she asks in a very great household
[42:02] so job is at a time right now where he
[42:05] is just blessed I mean seven thousand
[42:08] sheep maybe could equate to 20 Porsches
[42:10] and uh 3 000 camels uh five houses or
[42:14] whatever but job is at a point where
[42:16] he's uh experiencing the Mountaintop
[42:18] right it says a very great household and
[42:21] it says so that this man was the
[42:23] greatest of all the men of the East
[42:25] right and this is the Bible confessing
[42:27] that and it says here his sons went that
[42:29] went and feasted in their houses
[42:30] everyone his day and sent and called for
[42:33] their sisters to eat and and to drink
[42:35] with them and if so was in the day
[42:37] they're fishing they were gone about the
[42:39] job sitting Sanctified and Rosa Brothers
[42:41] morning offered burnt offerings
[42:42] according to the number of of them all
[42:45] for job said it may be that my sons have
[42:47] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[42:49] thus the job did just thus dear Joel
[42:52] continuing so job is at a time where
[42:54] he's on a Mountaintop where not only is
[42:56] he being blessed but he's caring about
[42:59] this the the the the the the the
[43:01] spiritual life of his kids right he's he
[43:04] cares about the spiritual life his kids
[43:05] he's making sacrifices him he's only
[43:07] he's on a Mountaintop right now and
[43:08] everything is going good everything is
[43:10] is feeling good you know it's uh uh um
[43:13] church is good right he's having a great
[43:15] time in church he's a righteous man that
[43:16] went to church right so we want to show
[43:19] we're going to go down here to verse um
[43:22] we're going to go down here to verse 8.
[43:24] we're going to show how this experience
[43:27] this Mountaintop experience that job is
[43:30] going through uh it wasn't of his own
[43:32] doing right
[43:34] so in verse 8 Job chapter 1 verse say
[43:36] the reason the Lord said to Satan has
[43:39] thou considered my servant job that
[43:41] there is none like him in the earth a
[43:42] perfect and upright man one that fear of
[43:44] God and issue of evil the Satan answer
[43:46] the Lord and said do if job fear God
[43:48] from not so so Satan tried to throw a
[43:51] challenge to God to say he's only
[43:54] serving you because you're doing these
[43:55] things right
[43:57] and it goes on to say has not Thou made
[44:00] a hedge and that Q I like that word
[44:02] hedge because we can use that to
[44:04] represent job's mountain mountain
[44:06] experience which is a hedge about him
[44:09] right because the enemy goes on to
[44:11] confess and about his house and about
[44:13] all that he have on every side thou has
[44:15] blessed and this is the enemy
[44:17] recognizing God has blessed job thou has
[44:21] blessed thy Work of his hands and his
[44:23] substances increased that means he is
[44:25] continually just getting richer he's
[44:27] continually getting better and Amy
[44:30] recognizes that this guy's on the
[44:32] mountain and that's the only reason that
[44:34] he's serving you that's the only reason
[44:35] that he loves you is because he's on the
[44:37] mountain right
[44:39] that's the only reason that he's
[44:40] blessing to blessing you but as soon as
[44:42] you take him off that mountain he ain't
[44:44] going to serve you no more he ain't
[44:45] going to believe in you no more right so
[44:47] another problem that we Face uh is when
[44:51] we um is when God is trying to bring us
[44:53] into the valley
[44:54] and we expect our Hilltop experiences to
[44:57] be there with us in the valley
[44:59] and that can create issues right that
[45:01] can create conflicts because we're
[45:04] expecting a good we're expecting those
[45:06] good experiences down here in the valley
[45:08] and God wants to God wants to take us
[45:10] through a different route right so when
[45:12] job was going through it's about going
[45:14] through his uh Valley because because as
[45:16] you read as you read further on down
[45:18] there you're going to see the enemy took
[45:20] everything from him right as job was
[45:22] going through his Valley he couldn't
[45:23] take his riches he couldn't take his
[45:25] family the enemy I'd take him out right
[45:28] on the Mountaintop uh we could see job's
[45:31] wife was so good to him she cooked she
[45:33] cleaned they went on dates right she was
[45:36] such a sweet wife but fast forward in
[45:38] the valley when he needed a shoulder to
[45:41] lean on when he needed someone to uh to
[45:44] say hey come down and praise me as I'm
[45:46] going through this thing she told him to
[45:48] curse God
[45:49] right right so she he couldn't he
[45:52] couldn't you sometimes you can't expect
[45:54] even your closest loved ones to be with
[45:56] you as you're going through a valley
[45:57] even though it may be a natural feeling
[46:00] for you right uh um the Bible says that
[46:02] he have friends right and not just
[46:04] friends these were church friends these
[46:06] were people that went to church with
[46:07] them and the Bible and if you read it it
[46:10] says they went to go mourn with him and
[46:12] help help him and comfort him and and uh
[46:15] um these were friends that job allowed
[46:17] to come over his house and they ate a
[46:18] bottle of food right they sat on his
[46:20] couch uh job gave them the best
[46:23] Hospitality to job when they were sick
[46:25] he prayed for them God confessed that
[46:27] job was the most righteous man in the
[46:29] land so these are things that a
[46:30] righteous man does but fast forward when
[46:33] he was in the valley when he needed just
[46:35] a few words of encouragement to say job
[46:37] you know what God's going to be with you
[46:39] God's going to help you from this they
[46:41] said he was secretly sinning
[46:43] now can you imagine this man right uh uh
[46:47] lost all his kids lost all his riches
[46:50] his wife is now tell him to curse God
[46:52] and now his friends who you expect uh
[46:55] his friends in Christ right his friends
[46:57] in Christ where he needs the Lord of
[46:59] encouragement from them right say you're
[47:01] you're secretly sending like you're
[47:03] doing something wrong and he knew his
[47:05] heart he wasn't doing anything wrong
[47:06] right right so a lot of times people
[47:08] expect to bring the though that
[47:10] happiness and those fielded emotions and
[47:13] and the reasoning of a situation uh uh
[47:16] down into the valley but God usually and
[47:19] a lot of times God takes a lot of that
[47:21] stuff away God takes a lot of those
[47:23] things away and now but when you try to
[47:25] take those Hilltop experiences down into
[47:27] the valley it creates a struggle inside
[47:29] you and now you're struggling whether
[47:31] you can trust in God or not because you
[47:33] put trust in other things than in him
[47:36] solely right so and and the reason why
[47:39] uh uh these things happened uh we're
[47:42] gonna go back to job uh chapter go back
[47:44] to verse 12 and chapter one
[47:46] we're going to see the reason why these
[47:49] things happen where job couldn't lean on
[47:51] his wife or Joe couldn't trust him his
[47:53] friends or a job couldn't trust him his
[47:54] riches and stuff so verse 12 says that
[47:57] and the Lord said unto Satan behold and
[47:59] this was after uh uh Satan challenged
[48:02] God that if hey if you take away
[48:04] everything with him I'll get him to
[48:06] curse you and the Lord said unto Satan
[48:07] behold
[48:09] all that he hath is in thy power
[48:13] so this is God given Satan uh the
[48:17] ability to go and take everything that
[48:19] he has right uh uh um you can you can
[48:23] anoint his wife you can you can anoint
[48:25] his friends you can take away his riches
[48:27] take away so now job is coming out of
[48:30] that Valley that hedge that was about
[48:32] him which was a which was a valley
[48:34] experience God has opened up that hedge
[48:36] job didn't open up he didn't want to go
[48:38] down that route Joe didn't want to go
[48:40] down the route but now God has opened up
[48:42] this hedge and now he's allowing job to
[48:45] kind of go down into this Valley uh and
[48:47] experience these things right and it
[48:50] wasn't of his own doing and it's and
[48:51] that's why a lot of times when we're
[48:53] going through uh um when you're going
[48:56] through a struggle God hasn't changed
[48:59] right God has not changed God will give
[49:01] the enemy power over your health God
[49:03] will give you the enemy power over your
[49:05] family sometimes you wonder why is my
[49:07] family acting the way that they do right
[49:09] God has allowed Satan to go and and we
[49:13] maybe we're all Christians we're all
[49:15] saved but that don't but that's not
[49:16] that's not a reason why the enemy still
[49:18] can't use people to try to affect you
[49:20] right because when Jesus was going
[49:23] through his time where he was going
[49:24] through a great valley right and he had
[49:26] to die on the cross and Peter said I
[49:28] won't let them kill you God looked at
[49:31] Peterson Satan get thee behind me
[49:33] right as he was going through his Valley
[49:35] what he needed was he needed Peter and
[49:37] them to help him so and so much that
[49:39] when he went to pray in the Garden of
[49:41] Gethsemane that he that when he was
[49:43] praying during that time he needed them
[49:45] to pray with him and they would sleep
[49:46] right so he couldn't depend upon them so
[49:49] this was Jesus Jesus about the greatest
[49:51] battle that anyone has ever gone through
[49:53] you know he couldn't depend upon he
[49:55] couldn't depend upon his friends right
[49:57] he couldn't depend upon how he felt
[49:59] about the situation because he said
[50:01] father not my will so when we're going
[50:03] through when we're going through
[50:04] sickness you know when we're going
[50:06] through uh struggles with the family
[50:07] marriage struggles our friendships are
[50:09] or any kind of hard time right and
[50:12] sometimes and I've heard the prophet
[50:14] saying we've all felt this before
[50:15] sometimes you don't even feel saved
[50:17] right your salvation isn't Based On A
[50:20] Feeling right it wasn't a feeling that
[50:22] brought Christ to uh to the Cross right
[50:25] and the cross represents not only our
[50:27] salvation but our healing forgiveness is
[50:29] sin sometimes you know you feel like
[50:31] you're not forgiven sometimes you feel
[50:33] why God hasn't forgiven you but it
[50:35] wasn't a feeling that pinned Christ to
[50:37] the Cross right it was love that did it
[50:40] it was love that did it in trust in his
[50:43] word where God is how he felt about the
[50:45] situation and we have to be the exact
[50:47] same way when we're going through our
[50:49] Valley when we're going through our
[50:50] struggle we're going through our
[50:51] sickness we got to say no he was wounded
[50:53] uh for our transgression transgressions
[50:55] by Stripes were healed that's all we're
[50:57] looking at because God will give the
[50:59] enemy power over your emotions and take
[51:02] it away take those feelings away from
[51:04] you and you can't get them back and a
[51:07] lot of times we struggle to do that and
[51:08] you see a lot of people in life struggle
[51:10] to do that so they'll do drugs they'll
[51:12] find a enjoyment and other things to try
[51:15] to get emotions those emotions back but
[51:17] God was allowed the enemy power over
[51:19] everything that you got and what God is
[51:21] wanting to do is for you to trust in his
[51:23] word alone because that brings about
[51:26] Victory right that brings about the
[51:28] victory so uh so the beauty in these
[51:31] expectations is that we can we can we
[51:33] can change the expectations when we're
[51:35] down in the valley to say you know what
[51:37] Lord I'm going to trust you Lord no
[51:39] matter how I'm feeling Lord no matter
[51:41] what the situation looks like the doctor
[51:43] said that it's over right the doctor
[51:45] said and and that's why you can't use
[51:47] reason in education right because the
[51:49] doctor will give you every single you
[51:52] don't even know what he says he says
[51:53] your blood blood levels your O2 or 3b5
[51:56] or and the protein 95 is in in the
[52:00] negative you know I don't even know what
[52:01] that means right but he's telling you
[52:04] that it's done it's over right and it
[52:07] sounds good I know it sounds good right
[52:09] it sounds almost true but God in that
[52:12] situation God is wanting you to lean on
[52:15] his word even more regardless of what
[52:17] you're feeling of how of what you're
[52:18] doing because God will allow the enemy
[52:20] to take away your old Health God allow
[52:22] the enemy to uh uh uh to put you on your
[52:25] deathbed right got around to put you on
[52:27] your deathbed right but he but he's what
[52:29] he's wanting you to do is just to stand
[52:31] on his word right to know that even
[52:33] regardless of it regardless of that
[52:35] you're down there in the valley God what
[52:37] are you trying to get out of this
[52:38] situation right and that's and that's
[52:40] what we fail to ask because we're always
[52:42] looking to be on top of the mountain but
[52:44] instead of asking God what are you
[52:46] trying to get out of this situation
[52:47] right because a lot of times a lot of
[52:49] times you know we say we love our kids
[52:51] right you say we love our kids and all
[52:53] of a sudden they're gone they've gone
[52:54] Wayward right and it's like God why is
[52:56] all this thing why has all this
[52:57] happening I thought you loved your kids
[52:59] because that because when your kids are
[53:02] Wayward and it causes you to go out the
[53:04] way and to pray for them to do things
[53:07] that has causing great stress on you
[53:09] it's a different kind of love you're
[53:10] showing for your kids that God's trying
[53:12] to bring out of you
[53:14] right God's trying to bring that out of
[53:16] you he doesn't want you just to love
[53:17] your kids when everything is good right
[53:19] because that's not true love right so
[53:21] God allow your kids to go Wayward uh go
[53:24] wild and I mean out in the world and
[53:27] doing whatever they want because he
[53:28] wants to bring out a different kind of
[53:30] love inside of you right and so God will
[53:33] allow all these things to happen uh uh
[53:36] um in the valley right so it's uh it's
[53:39] important for us it's important for us
[53:41] um in closing it's important for us to
[53:44] uh make sure our expectations are lined
[53:47] up with God right and the key in doing
[53:50] that is focusing on what does God want
[53:52] out of this situation that's why we
[53:54] yield ourselves right and a lot of times
[53:57] when we say oh Lord we sing it oh Lord I
[53:59] yield myself oh Lord I sacrifice myself
[54:01] but what if God wants you to go through
[54:03] a great trial
[54:05] what if that yielding means God wants
[54:07] you to give up your health right because
[54:09] the thing about it is job loved his
[54:11] health he said the thing I feared most
[54:13] Came Upon me which was the cancer God
[54:15] allowed to Amy to take something that
[54:18] was precious to him that was dear to him
[54:21] right and so we have to ask ourselves uh
[54:24] um God what are you wanting to get out
[54:26] of this situation God what are you
[54:28] wanting to pull outside of me what are
[54:30] you wanting to pull uh to bring outside
[54:32] of me while I'm in this Valley oh Lord
[54:33] that could give you glory right so it's
[54:36] and and it's not always going to be easy
[54:38] it's not always going to feel good it's
[54:40] not always going to it's there's not
[54:42] always sometimes we want to praise we
[54:43] want unhindered praise which is not
[54:46] reasonable we want to be able to praise
[54:47] God without hearing doubt we want to be
[54:50] able to praise God without without
[54:51] feeling like it's not doing nothing but
[54:54] there are times where God wants you to
[54:55] praise regardless of it regardless of it
[54:58] he wants you to we want you to worship
[54:59] Him regardless of it and God loves that
[55:02] praise even though we may not think he
[55:04] does you know we may not think he hears
[55:06] it right and so it's it's it's it's it's
[55:09] it's it's important for us to stand on
[55:12] to stand on that word uh which which
[55:14] involves us just yielding to him
[55:17] yielding to his will and that's why he
[55:19] says these things that's why Bible says
[55:22] uh uh you know you're not we're not
[55:23] trying to come down on Earth and build
[55:25] our own kingdom and do our own things
[55:27] Lord what do you want right when you
[55:30] yield yourself to his will that helps
[55:32] you when you go through the valley
[55:33] because a lot of times people go through
[55:35] the valley and God's going to bring you
[55:37] through if you're a son or daughter of
[55:38] God God will bring you through a valley
[55:40] and not just one he'll bring you through
[55:42] multiple valleys he'll bring you through
[55:44] multiple values and it's important that
[55:46] you yield yourself and you yield your
[55:48] will to him because it makes the
[55:50] experience better
[55:52] it makes the experience better or else
[55:55] you're going to be struggling you're
[55:57] going to be battling right and God wants
[55:59] to have God wants to give you a
[56:01] satisfaction on the other side that when
[56:03] I went through this thing I trusted in
[56:06] God I stood on his word I believed in
[56:09] him and he brought me through it and
[56:11] that satisfaction is the greatest thing
[56:13] that you can ever have right that
[56:16] satisfaction is the greatest thing that
[56:17] we could ever have all right so we're
[56:19] gonna um we're gonna pray
[56:21] um
[56:22] but yeah we got to it's it's it's a and
[56:25] that's why it's a continual it's a
[56:26] continual status it's a continual
[56:28] sacrificing to God which is why God
[56:31] wants us to read our Bibles every day
[56:32] God wants us to come to church right
[56:35] we're not just coming to church just to
[56:37] sit sit down and uh uh and put on a
[56:40] Persona because a lot of times you see
[56:42] that people you see people put on a
[56:44] church Persona you see people put on
[56:45] some kind of a a church look to be a
[56:48] church person and that's not what we're
[56:50] coming to church for that's not what
[56:52] we're doing this for we're trying to die
[56:54] out to ourselves because we don't know
[56:56] where God could bring us because we
[56:58] can't control whether we're going to be
[56:59] on the mountain we can't control where
[57:01] we're going to be on the valley and we
[57:02] want to make sure that we're open we
[57:04] want to make sure that you know it's
[57:06] there's no there's not a more there's
[57:08] not more of a struggle when we're going
[57:10] through the valley because we have an
[57:12] expectation inside of our head of how
[57:14] things should be which just makes the
[57:16] situation seem worse than it was but
[57:18] that and that's why I love it in Psalms
[57:20] David said he make it me lie down in
[57:23] Green Pastures
[57:25] David's yielded his good times to God
[57:29] David has yielded his good times to God
[57:31] David Azure at the Times where hey Lord
[57:33] if if if if you want me to have a good
[57:35] season you're going to lead me there
[57:38] then he also says yea though I walk
[57:40] through the valley of the shadow of
[57:41] death I will fear no evil right so now
[57:43] he's yielding he's yielding his guidance
[57:46] in the valley to God it says if you
[57:48] brought me here I'm not going to fear
[57:50] what's going on I'm just going to trust
[57:51] you you're going to you're going you're
[57:53] going to be with me it says dial rod and
[57:55] I staff Will Comfort me that means I'm
[57:57] going to have comfort in this thing see
[57:59] David has surrendered himself
[58:00] surrendered his mouth on tops in his
[58:02] Valley to God so that his experiences
[58:06] end up being a blessing all right amen
[58:10] um let us pray
[58:13] um Lord Jesus
[58:14] we thank You O Lord God for uh speaking
[58:17] to us O Lord God
[58:19] we thank You O Lord God for your wisdom
[58:22] O Lord God and your your grace and your
[58:25] knowledge O Lord God of your mercy O
[58:27] Lord God because there's people O Lord
[58:29] God out in the world right now that are
[58:31] trying to find that satisfaction
[58:34] everybody in the world goes through ups
[58:36] and downs whether you're a Christian or
[58:38] not a Christian or Lord God it's how you
[58:40] design man you design man to go through
[58:42] these episodes go through these ups and
[58:44] downs to experience these different
[58:46] attributes that are inside you that can
[58:48] be expressed inside of us as well Lord
[58:50] God so we thank You O Lord God that we
[58:53] may not be in a big church oh Lord God
[58:55] Lord but you've come down and spoke to
[58:58] us oh Lord God let these words be seeds
[59:01] that are planted within our souls O Lord
[59:03] God and take root Lord God so that when
[59:05] we're going through our valleys when
[59:07] we're going through our tough times and
[59:09] there's fear on all this fear everywhere
[59:11] Lord God on every side oh Lord God and
[59:13] the enemy is trying to make us doubt oh
[59:16] Lord God we can hang on to your word and
[59:18] your word Lord Jesus Christ Lord you're
[59:21] looking for a church that is without
[59:23] spot or wrinkle oh Lord God you're not
[59:25] you didn't say he was coming for a
[59:26] denomination you said you were coming
[59:28] for a word Briar Lord God that's resting
[59:30] on your word and your word alone oh Lord
[59:33] Jesus Christ and that's going to help
[59:34] take us through the valley oh Lord Jesus
[59:36] Christ we thank you for the mountaintops
[59:39] O Lord God but we know O Lord God those
[59:41] aren't made to last O Lord Jesus Christ
[59:43] because the great Mountaintop experience
[59:46] that we're looking for is when one day
[59:48] cross over the Jordan of the Lord God
[59:50] into our Eternal home oh Lord God where
[59:53] we don't have to worry or struggle about
[59:54] anything else O Lord God we're not
[59:56] trying to bring that down here on Earth
[59:58] our Lord Jesus Christ so Lord help us oh
[1:00:01] Lord God as we go through the valleys
[1:00:02] help us oh Lord God to trust in you help
[1:00:05] us oh Lord God to surrender ourselves O
[1:00:07] Lord God and to stand on your word and
[1:00:09] your word alone lord it's hard to do it
[1:00:12] Lord Jesus Christ and you know it
[1:00:14] yourself because you came into a body oh
[1:00:16] Lord God and when it was time for you to
[1:00:17] give up your will Lord it wasn't any a
[1:00:19] decision for you to do that when you saw
[1:00:21] what was going to happen oh Lord God
[1:00:23] Lord but you still were able to have the
[1:00:25] victory O Lord God so we're looking for
[1:00:27] You O Lord God to come down and in our
[1:00:29] lives O Lord God and give us that
[1:00:31] decision O Lord God to stand on your
[1:00:33] word alone or to bring us through the
[1:00:35] valley oh Lord God some people are sick
[1:00:38] Oh Lord God some people are dealing with
[1:00:41] health issues that they dealt for years
[1:00:42] oh Lord God lord you just said we can't
[1:00:45] control how long we stay in the Valley
[1:00:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ we can't
[1:00:49] control how long we're sickle Lord God
[1:00:51] it's not up to us oh Lord God but what
[1:00:53] we can do oh Lord God is still praise
[1:00:55] you for who you are Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:57] because you're a Healer oh Lord Jesus
[1:01:00] Christ oh Lord the blood wasn't shed in
[1:01:02] vain oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord give us
[1:01:05] the endurance O Lord the spiritual
[1:01:07] endurance of the Lord to go through our
[1:01:08] trials oh Lord God give us this
[1:01:10] spiritual endurance when we're praying
[1:01:11] for our loved ones our way our wayward
[1:01:13] kids oh Lord God you never gave us a
[1:01:16] timeline when they would come back oh
[1:01:17] Lord Jesus Christ the lord gave us a
[1:01:20] promise that they would come so Lord
[1:01:22] while we're in our waiting O Lord God
[1:01:23] lord anchor us down our Lord Jesus
[1:01:26] Christ anchor us down O Lord God to
[1:01:28] stand on your word O Lord God lord we're
[1:01:30] not trusting in our emotion the enemy is
[1:01:32] overtaking them oh Lord God we're not
[1:01:34] trusting in our reasoning we've tried to
[1:01:36] to battle with him in the Mind Games
[1:01:38] he's too smarter than us oh Lord Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ so we just want to stand on your
[1:01:42] word alone O Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:01:45] surrender all of our mental faculties we
[1:01:47] surrender all of our emotions oh Lord we
[1:01:49] surrender all the excitement we
[1:01:50] surrendered the expectations O Lord God
[1:01:53] To You O Lord God said you can use us O
[1:01:55] Lord God what are you trying to show
[1:01:57] Lord God what what the Bible said the
[1:02:00] prophet said that the book that acts is
[1:02:02] still being written O Lord God what
[1:02:03] Bible verses are you wanting to write in
[1:02:05] our life oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[1:02:08] show us oh Lord God give us that give us
[1:02:11] that give us that of that energy O Lord
[1:02:13] that spiritual endurance O Lord God to
[1:02:15] press through the Lord God so that when
[1:02:17] we get on the other side Lord God when
[1:02:20] we say thank you Lord God we can say
[1:02:22] without knowing that we didn't have an
[1:02:24] attitude O Lord God knowing that we
[1:02:25] didn't we didn't question You O Lord God
[1:02:27] and there's a satisfaction knowing that
[1:02:29] when all we could do was stand alone we
[1:02:32] stood we still still in the word oh Lord
[1:02:34] God grant it to us father O Lord just as
[1:02:37] we just as um it just as Zoe was in that

[1:02:42] else getting getting something oh Lord

[1:02:46] crying because we see in the Bible

[1:02:50] you gave you've given job the strength
[1:02:52] to endure his value Lord endure his test
[1:02:55] O Lord now we're crying oh Lord we need
[1:02:56] that same endurance now Lord Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ we're your children oh Lord God

[1:03:26] God bless you brother
[1:03:29] amen praise the Lord
[1:03:31] hey man we really appreciate
[1:03:35] brother Quentin
[1:03:38] Junior
[1:03:40] forgetting himself how to win allowed
[1:03:42] the Lord to use him just a wonderful
[1:03:44] message uh expectation in the valley I
[1:03:48] believe right
[1:03:50] expectations in the valley you know is
[1:03:54] that right yeah expectations in the
[1:03:56] valley
[1:03:57] I I was I was just thinking as I was
[1:04:00] sitting back there and it kind of remind
[1:04:02] me of the story that the prophet told
[1:04:06] about
[1:04:07] when
[1:04:09] president
[1:04:12] um
[1:04:14] Lincoln
[1:04:15] Abraham Lincoln the freed the slaves and
[1:04:19] he was saying how some of the more fit
[1:04:22] slaves are run up to the top of the
[1:04:26] mountain
[1:04:27] because he said at Sunrise you'll be
[1:04:29] free so there was ones that went all the
[1:04:33] way up to the top of the mountain and
[1:04:36] they were the first ones to see the sun
[1:04:38] begin to rise
[1:04:39] and so as they begin to see the sun rise
[1:04:42] they will reach back look back and tell
[1:04:44] the one belong that we're free because
[1:04:47] the sun is rising and then that want to
[1:04:50] reach a look back behind them until the
[1:04:52] next one down there were free because
[1:04:54] they were listening to him that the sun
[1:04:57] is rising
[1:04:59] so by Brother Quentin tonight I said
[1:05:01] even though you might be in the valley
[1:05:03] he sent a word amen to terrible
[1:05:06] acquaintance you're still free amen
[1:05:08] because the sun is Right
[1:05:10] amen you may be in the valley but the
[1:05:14] sun is risen you're still free you might
[1:05:17] be in the valley of decision in the
[1:05:20] valley of confusion but one thing about
[1:05:22] the valley the Bible tells us that he is
[1:05:26] a lily
[1:05:27] in the valley amen and he's a bright and
[1:05:31] a Morning Star so when you're in the
[1:05:33] valley he's there
[1:05:35] when you're on the mountain top he's
[1:05:37] there another thing about the valley
[1:05:39] he's uh he's talking about David how he
[1:05:42] said I walk through the valley of Shadow
[1:05:44] one day David said I look to the Hills
[1:05:48] from which cometh my help my help coming
[1:05:51] from the Lord so when you're in the
[1:05:54] valley you might be down there but you
[1:05:56] only got one thing to do look to the
[1:05:58] heels amen because your help is coming
[1:06:00] amen he didn't leave you there by
[1:06:03] yourself amen I know what you're going
[1:06:05] through or you might uh things in your
[1:06:07] body or it might be confusion or like he
[1:06:10] said that things on the job or whatever
[1:06:12] he valid experiences we have to go
[1:06:14] through amen as a part of the Christian
[1:06:16] experience amen but we know that our God
[1:06:20] is able to deliver us amen even in the
[1:06:23] valley we see songs of praise to him
[1:06:26] amen I praise him in the valley I praise
[1:06:28] him in the good times I praise him in
[1:06:30] the bad times why because he is still
[1:06:33] God even in the valley amen about to
[1:06:37] just appreciate brother Quinn I say
[1:06:38] thank you so much for uh uh getting
[1:06:41] yourself out of the way and allowing God
[1:06:43] to use you amen just a wonderful message

[1:10:46] and we paid our tithes and gave our
[1:10:49] offerings
[1:10:51] and uh
[1:10:52] many people have done very well but I
[1:10:55] just saw a hand of God and how he moved
[1:10:59] upon us at very young ages and gave us
[1:11:02] very uh good jobs
[1:11:06] didn't go to didn't run off to college

[1:12:10] another word of prayer give God thanks
[1:12:12] Lord dear heavenly father
[1:12:15] Lord God we just our hearts Our Father
[1:12:18] God are just uh joyous so far that the
[1:12:21] word that was spoken tonight Lord we
[1:12:24] don't take these things Lord God for
[1:12:27] granted Lord because many are not being
[1:12:31] fed in this manner Lord God there uh
[1:12:35] being fed a bunch of uh Hocus Pocus and
[1:12:40] um lies and and and and and and things
[1:12:42] but Lord we just believe Lord

[1:12:56] different ones oh Father God to just
[1:12:58] yield their themselves Lord God and

[1:13:21] believe the things that come from the
[1:13:22] lips of another man
[1:13:24] but Lord God we don't believe that just
[1:13:26] a man is speaking Lord God we believe
[1:13:29] Lord God that you are able Lord God by
[1:13:32] the unction of the Holy Spirit oh Father
[1:13:34] God to inspire these brothers to speak
[1:13:37] Lord God certain things Lord God that we
[1:13:40] have need of Lord God lord may we just
[1:13:43] take number oh Father God and hold it
