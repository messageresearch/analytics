God he is sweet I know a man has he been good to you a man we may take our seats I won't hold you long just have a real short low thought here amen I trust that they had a fine to your soul a man this evening hey man you pray for me man keep me in your prayers the Lord is so good because mercy and grace and do it forever hey man let us grab our Bibles and we'll turn to let's go to Hebrews we're gonna go to Hebrews 6 and that's what we've been working with in the Bible study man hey Mandy we have a wonderful service on Sunday yes a man still been a man feasting on that Hebrew six we'll just start that from the six verse six chapter six verse a man won't keep you standing longer than you can be seated and then we'll read a few other scriptures put in the context what was the point that we're trying to get across this evening a man if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame a man for the earth that drinketh up that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth the blessings from God made a Lord out of blessings of the reading of his word amen and and you know the Prophet preached a message you may be seated to see the discrepancy and in that he brought that that scripture there out and he said that seven person said but the earth with drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon him often upon it now we realize that uh that rain that water even the pass have been talking on the lately about how you need that rain a man to sit to soften you up and man you go into a dry place and those that vegetation there become so hard and quickly because there's been no rain a manner we look back then in the in the in the children of Israel in the wilderness and the Moses smoked a rock and it brought forth water a man he said that that was a beautiful type of Christ being smitten and watching smitten he brought forth the water which is the holy spirit a man he said my whole life's in you a comforter a man but first that rock which was Jesus had to be still was spitting hey man which is the perfect type they're saying that that in you know the Prophet was bringing about he say he saw a picture one day and they had a someone had a recollection and they painted it and a show like a little drop coming out of that rock but he said oh no that rock said cattle that fed water cattle people and said that water came out of that rock just like gushing just water coming from the rock now how does water come from a rock but it's sustained life life-giving water and it man that if we want to be able to stain life in this hour amen we have to have life-giving water and we understand that that water types the Holy Ghost amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a one time of it Amen you you you you you get thirsty your body is it's a way of letting you know that you need some water they give you if you don't drink enough water your body will shut down your organs will quit first things that start drying up on the inside you'll begin to have certain symptoms of crapping things of that your body's trying to say you need to get to some water you need to get to some water then if you ignore it then other things that happen that maybe you're maybe things are beginning to look dry you begin to be a bit of visibly see that that person is dehydrated you begin to get headaches and things of that nature and then if you continue to ignore that thing after a while what they call you go into a stroke from lack of water so you just need some fluids in it it'll be all right now if we type that in the spiritual a man you started out amen and uh in the presence of Almighty God a man in your end and you're running this race you begin to give of yourself when you give of yourself you so you and you you people if you perspire and along the way you lose a little bit if you don't get rehydrated you're not going to make it to the end you're just not gonna make it to the end amen now we want to take a little scripture read in him you can turn to it if you like if you don't like you don't have to we'll go right on we're gonna uh and my wife you're up sorry I just know what I just see the party about y'all flipping and going on got just want I'm gonna just keep going my wife always tell me said you read too much I say well I just do what I two doctors what I do do the best I can a man with technics reading here from Matthew 17 a man and we want to just see something here and we're gonna bring something out by the help of the Lord and after six days Jesus take Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was as white as life and behold there appeared unto their Moses and Elijah taken with him and Jesus and then then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if that will let us make here are three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elijah and while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed him and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face I was so afraid and Jesus came and touched them it arrived and said arise and be not afraid and if I had the title this they were the title that tonight I would say arise and be not afraid a man now we see here in Matthew 13 a man uh Matthew 13:24 to say but I say unto you that it shall be I'm sorry I went back too far a man another power but put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sword good seed in his field but Wow lien slept the enemy came in and sowed tares among the wheat when his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares now notice first the man came and sowed good seed you know and and and and and after that come the bad scene see so we see that the problem was talking about there that the person that so the good see was God see Satan is always coming behind and watching what God is gonna do so he said God sold seed in his field so now he wants to come and confuse the situation and so bad see in that same field because he he's the author of confusion so many times it's all he want to do if he can sow confusion into the situation a man a lot of times he can he can cause many problems in the message of seed of discrepancy the word discrepancy means to sow discord or being contrary and indifferent and then and then that messages II thank you brother that that the prophets constantly bringing out their that all we have to separate ourselves from unbelief it is vitally important amen that you you you keep yourself guarded from unbelief we see in the Garden of Eden that that Eve she had a barrier of protection Arama and then as long as she stayed fortified behind the Word of God but the satan is constantly looking for a weak point he's constantly looking for soft spot maybe it's something that somebody said to you that may cause a little room and it calls a little soft spot and seed hill of he'll attack right there and if he can ever get behind that that and and so that sea of discord in your heart you would do things that you didn't think you would do you would do things that you did not think you would do because what happened is that singing is laying there now hello now watch this the same Holy Ghost the same water that waters the good sea is warden of a sea that's why he's saying to be so close that are the deceive the very elect if it was possible but it's not possible why isn't it not possible because Randy they they realize that the devil came is so bad see they immediately wanted to go pluck up the bear scene but he say don't let them go together because if you go plug it up the bad scene while it's in seafoam your new damage to the goosey let them grow together you got the lake of manifest themselves because when the manifestation of that sea produces itself you need to be able to see which is which now on the other hand he said I'm not gonna leave it to anybody else he said I will do this Embry if it was possible it's not possible because Allah Himself is doing this separate he's doing the separate than the South glory to God amen amen so we see this discrepancy you have to separate yourself I want you to notice something a wild day the pastor made a comment he said I see what you're doing I see what they'd ever gone he was getting bombarded when I make a phone call this be then another one I make a phone call this thing and another one I make a phone call asking him questions about the message what about this and what about this and what about this and what about this he said I see you Devon I know what you're trying to do you try them well yeah I'm not gonna answer normal your questions get away I see what you're trying to do you're looking for a weak point you're looking for a weak point to try to so that bad seed in my heart you'd have to keep yourself protected and it's all of my brothers and sisters the devil mean business you gotta mean business because he's not playing amen so it's important when you find people that that's not speaking just right sowing discord you separate yourself now the purpose say it Hindu we say now you don't have to just have nothing to do with you say how to how to and goodbye because I'm not going to entertain your foolishness because I can I can't allow you to show that bad seed in my heart he'll slow that thinking you won't even know it all of a sudden you'll start just one don't like me then that thing agro next thing you know fine I'm leaving at shirt Oh from a conversation the Word of God is the sea so if the Word of God is the sea that bringeth forth good fruit it's gonna be a word that's so advancing it's through conversation through conversation does that seem answer if all you got to do bless you except me you ain't even got the acceptance oh you've got to do it reason with it maybe you right baby oh he got you that seed has been planted now it's going to take God to unplug that see you have to keep yourself protected let's look at an example turn the second Kings you love the Lord a man you caught up and get ahead of myself second Kings the third chapter we're gonna read from I'm sorry the second chapter now we're going to read from the ninth verse man he says and it came to pass that when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elijah as what I shall do for thee before I'm taken away I've been taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing but nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall be so amen and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both of sunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the Charities of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ripped them to pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan I mean it he took the mantle of Elijah and fell and he smoked the water and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the water he parted they parted hither and tither and he went over and earlier that it says he went over when they came over the first time when he lied you did he went over on dry ground amen so we see here a man Elijah a man asked for a double portion a man of what he has saw a man from Elijah now keep it on the same concept here this in enduring this time there was believers and there were borderline believers amen there was churches many different churches now we see that a hab was a borderline believable man a very religious amen he had heard the message from Elijah a member but he refused to listen I mean he just couldn't seem to bring himself to believe the word from the Prophet he had a religious conception Amen in a you know he said Oh a borderline believer a man is worse than an infidel a borderline believe him is worse than an infidel Revelation 3:15 says I know thy works that thou I need the hot or cold and I will work to steal you out of my mouth you see work that I wasted she was either hot or cold but the worst thing you can do is be borderline is be borderline see we need to make sure Amen that we go all the way with the Lord now now we understand this word saying we don't know God we take what we get seen now the Prophet brought this out and here you him and he says you can either be safe physically or you can be saved spiritually he said the same word is used for both the prayer of faith shall save the sick in the city and your loss into the silent prayer which I've saved the lost as well amen now the Prophet was bringing out a situation here about a fella a man who had a prostate trouble and I'm not going to read the whole thing I'm just gonna paraphrase it and everything just for the sake of time and he went to the mezzanine and he was healed from from from the situation went back to the doctor his fella name was dr. Church and he was a Methodist believer and he said well - he's going with you over there he said well you know for about six or eight months everything was good but all of a sudden it came back say my god came back he say see he said that's why I don't believe God she say that's why I shut that show like that brother Branham is false he said the same man over there he's this got the church talking said I say man over there it means every year going down the road a bunch of Nazarenes and pilgrim holders that backslide during the year and claim that they were saved at the altar but I better say healing is just as wrong as your faith holds out and so is your salvation he said you can be saved tonight and also next week you can be healed tonight and crippled tomorrow it is as long as your faith holds out the word save is translated sums up which means you're saved physically and spiritually now we want you to come to stand my brothers and sisters that the salvation yeah it is the beginning of the journey you can't stop there you can't feel it well a lot of time we confuse salvation and sanctification with the Holy Ghost don't make that mistake of getting right to the river and saying I got enough it's not enough just because you stopped listening to a world of music and enough that's sanctification you are now ready to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have went through you've taken the inoculation repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins now when you repent and be baptized you are baptized for the remission of their sins they say and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's something you got to the Prophet was telling about it story uh one fella he said uh I don't know if there be and it Holy Ghost he say well we're not working today I can show you I can show you why you don't have the Holy Ghost took him to a field and he say you just follow me Walt hey Walt when took him to a field and then they started to say well is this what we getting no let's keep walking and he took him over to a grassy area what a rest with a little bit higher and you say well is this what we did nope let's keep walking let's follow me and he walked up to this Pigpen but old man took off his shoes and a Sutton rolled his pants leg up and this mud slapped my leg about camp I went trunks and in it and he turned around and the fella was still on the sideline he said well what are you doing come up here's our little man I'm not coming yet he said what cubby said that's your problem you don't want it bad enough that's your problem you don't want it bad enough what are you willing to go through a mate I mean with lot of times we distinct it well coming to church and set up underwear and it's just gonna no you have to show God how bad you want it he told him to go then the open room and tearing them they waited not for an hour not for two hours I'm sure they were brother like well wait a minute what's going on how long we go stay here but they stayed until it's how bad you want it if you don't show women desperation for it shame on you he's not gonna give it to you you don't want it bad enough come in with DISA oh my god it's Lester attitude the church my god once you receive the Holy Ghost you're not there yet we have to go all the way until Matthew 17 NCC said this is my beloved son hear you him what is that Holy Ghost once you receive that Holy Ghost he said that is the tutor that instituted what is the tool to do the tutor goes back to God and say well God not you got yourself something right there he's doing a wonderful job I tell you what a church time he's first thing then get that our full service bringing up well I take it will you be real proud of it oh he's just worship and having himself a good time well you go to the Lord say Lord I tell you what I hate to tell you this that fella stayed home to watch talking on TV basketball games so he let all kind of pains getting away he's doing this they're doing that he's just real slow just real slow for my god thank you lord now he says uh listen I just wanna I just want to bring that out the right way now remember those condoms nope let me go back here he says here and hearing him he says an English student must be just he don't pull any punches he must bring the direct truth to the father and how that tutor my blush when he come up to the father to his face and he said your son is not going to good he's fallen in his studies he's a dilatory how the tutor must feel to come before the father with such a message that about his son I see he's still a solid he just can't give you the keys to the kingdom yet and often wonder how the Holy Spirit must feel in the presence of God bringing the conduct of your modern-day Church which so much world in it such dilatory those things that been graceful - and giving the new birth oh it must be terrible and to think that in these last days how corrupt church is getting to be on wind at night instead of going to prayer meeting they stay home and watch television remember those conducts of yours go right straight in the presence of God by somebody who won't pull any punches no matter how good a neighbor you are no matter how fine of a pillow you are in the church the Holy Spirit brings the truth to God how he must feel when he go and see the woman the daughters of the church stripped themselves down and with him little short coat get out there in the lawnmower yard before me that might burn you up but at all - and he says he say what's the matter today two minutes sitting behind the pulpit and a lot of Hollywood evangelism we need that good old-fashioned gospel that gospel of st. Paul Paul's revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back to the church again it used to be robbed for the holiness people and the Methodist people a man that tried to live right for the women to wear that medic you stuff or whatever you call it that stuff that they put on a face I know that's the wrong word but I can never think of it anyhow it used to be wrong for them to do such a thing it used to be wrong for Christians who were to Bob hair something went wrong somewhere the Bible says it's wrong now either you go out of the harness of your pastors got out of the will of God and quit preaching it but the truth and the Holy Spirit bears record for God that's right it used to be wrong for people to go out to the picture shows of entertainment of the world but today you can't tell one from the other people will miss prayer meeting and attain some kind of large meaning and how in the world can a Christian who calls themselves a child of God ever go to these places to eat and so forth these little old Nickelodeon's are playing rotten time in rock songs of Elvis and all these other things and being shook up you say you're gonna be all shook up one day for sure but hi not only young folks now not only you folks but Grandma and Grandpa does it that's right babysitter's while Mama and Papa is out getting a ride over the country Sunday morning they go to church with the long sanctimonious face what you need is a good old-fashioned Holy Spirit shaking it's what this country needs you know the truth and Oh years ago it used to be wrong for women to smoke cigarettes but it popular now and no matter how much the medical science says that there's car loads of cancer in every pack of cigarettes yeah they still do it you talk about feels my god a man so Church we see a man that day is a tutor and he is going back to the Father tell him everything amen that's the Holy Spirit now we see that the Holy Spirit is trying to get us to a point trying to get us to matthew 17:2 where we a man can can say this is my beloved son and and hear you him a man I want to just bring out the problem was talking about in the message you had the same message he knew him I believe it was how we we need to get back to the basics he was in a meeting and he said a meeting was so successful it was things that was happening in that meeting said was in Canada and a bunch of Indians but all during the song service there was a young girl who was outside the church in the field frame for the service she had got there and I will before service and she started praying for the service and she would pray clean through the song service and then she would come me he said that one thing alone made the difference made the difference we have a problem Church the reason I can read it I have it here he said the reason you don't see God moving the church is we treated like luster we come in late we don't come in with the right attitude we come in with little things on our minds and he say God is displeased with that he said he this is what he called it I wish I can find it right now but he said that coldness that coax up that starchiness that you feel he said it's because of your approach it's because of your project many know my testimony how I left the gospel for a while church i'ma tell you when I came back it took a little bit but I said this ain't the same message I left at first time I went over to the meeting immediately the preachers finished preaching it looked like intermission at the basketball game take the time to move that's the time the sense feeling wait for God had the deacon in that one side what my trunk I could say that I was how do you finish looking at your clock their preachers look at that your clock name I'm trying to get up out of here I got something to do I left a pot over all of a sudden what if the rapture happened in the morning you don't even get to eat that food it's our approach Saints it shows in second Kings I was heading somewhere but for sake of time I'm a just jumped forward he went onto me sick uh-uh your valley full of ditches go and dig your valley full of dishes he says that you were don't hear any thunder or rain but in the morning you'll wake up and those ditches would be full of war what does the water represent the Holy Ghost now how much do you want it's how deep you dig your ditch Heidi are you digging yo ditch how bad do you want it perfect I was talking about he's told he said it's like he told her that at one time he said dad yeah I could swim him I could swim yeah well let me see let's go out him and he went out there took it clothes off I did a little mud puddle about a cup of feet I'm not even a foot of soul deep about six inches or so just a big mud puddle jumping that mud puddle belly just dragging the muddy just splashing mud everywhere he's lady happy turn around and look at his daddy as seeing their discontent under they said you get yourself in a house and take your shot up it not cover gig you like you're talking about this play around like this Momo you ain't swimming he said one day his uncle so they might on the boat he kept selling something just went over my 30-foot award and hit him with the door not moving the water yeah you had to prove again see he said that same thing that live us to him I think we got the Holy Ghost we just splash it move it he said one dog one day the law gonna take you out the deep war and just push it off the boat sank I don't know hammers and I know a lot y'all know a lot of you know what I done been through some heartache I mean hard you seek the Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters not one time but a constant the rain come often upon earth often upon the earth let's change our attitude let's change our attitude about the gospel and we'll see God do something while families for us they'll keep brother Josue in prayer amen we expecting a miracle Amen I know God can do it see there's many different needs these we don't even know about you began to see somebody not showing up give him a call give him a call be mindful of what's going on try you even if your home whatever you're doing service time is at 7:30 let's break it down about 6:00 and going to prayer going to prayer have a real concern about the gospel there's so much work for us to do God want to do great things we was looking at Kings he said a double portion say that's what that's us say when we see him go he say come back it's a greater work shall we do that's our double portion we see him when he go see means to understand greater works that's the double portion but we see them it's our attitude immediately Elijah - and he said that the Lord God did it for look but Elijah you do it for me but he had to come with the same approach to the gospel god bless my auntie she wrote a song C common to you don't you let this gospel become common to you C key the fullness of God because I promise you if you stop your whither up your drive up and the devil of take

awfully we just examine ourselves a man just be mindful approach to the gossip you know my wife and I was traveling shop to she truck and she brought up my seat I was worse than her but you know when I were traveling we was travelling along and you say how many people you think you know cars houses just being had to be a big this people everywhere we was going down song without and city right now Doral was just a lot of people people people people people that you see here we go in this little car see the goddess traveling through just traveling to what a bless it is you're blessed to be sitting here don't take it for granted the opportunity that God has called you too many can't hear this gospel many of them don't want to hear this gospel oblivious to it but some have some way through your life experiences here you are and it has pricked your heart to the point that you want to be here and you want more gun don't take it lightly talk freedom has Oh many are called but few

you what if you get on your knees a higher before service time and get yourself in the right frame of mind and gives you something the right spirit I promise you you'll see the difference [Music] the pastor preached the message opened wide your mouth don't be afraid to worship God he inhabits the worship of his people he lives in them just in that little time that we came out here before service and no songs of worship I felt the atmosphere change felt the atmosphere change don't what is it if we all just eat difficult so I might be praying at home might not be able to give you some give you
