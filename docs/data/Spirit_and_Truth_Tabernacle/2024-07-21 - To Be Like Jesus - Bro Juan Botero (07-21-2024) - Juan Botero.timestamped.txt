[48:56] it'd be a pointless thing to do
[48:59] father but we come here Lord for one
[49:02] purpose and that's to praise you father
[49:05] that's to Worship You Lord to exalt your
[49:09] name for you are the great one in our
[49:11] midst
[49:12] Lord and father you said in your word
[49:14] where two or three are gathered in my
[49:16] name I will be there in their midst and
[49:20] Lord we've gathered here and I there's
[49:21] more than two or three of us Lord and
[49:22] we've gathered in your name so we
[49:24] believe according to your word father
[49:26] father that you are here Lord to meet
[49:29] every
[49:29] need father whether it be
[49:32] spiritual Lord whether it be
[49:35] physical you meet every need father and
[49:37] we thank you for that Lord and we ask
[49:40] that you take this service now Under
[49:41] Your Divine control Lord may you be in
[49:43] the speaking and in the hearing father
[49:45] may you have your way father we pray and
[49:48] Lord we'll give you the glory honor and
[49:50] praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[49:53] amen amen amen God bless you Saints
[49:57] it's good to be here in West Palm Beach
[49:59] it's been a long time about 6 years
[50:02] maybe since I was last here and we had
[50:04] one child and he was a
[50:07] baby um but it's good to be here again
[50:09] and it's always nice to come to a church
[50:11] where there's
[50:13] faith and where there's belief that God
[50:16] is the same yesterday today and
[50:19] forever and you know I was I was back
[50:22] there and I was thinking about these
[50:23] songs that are sung and you know I
[50:24] preached a sermon back home home about
[50:27] being an influencer for God right
[50:30] because in this the word influencer is
[50:34] huge this day and age everybody wants to
[50:37] be an influencer and they want to be an
[50:39] influencer of something or someone but
[50:42] we find that the greatest influencer
[50:44] that ever came upon this Earth was Jesus
[50:47] Christ sir and what does an influencer
[50:49] do an influencer influences another to
[50:53] act like them right when you young
[50:55] people older like when we go online and
[50:57] these influencers are there they're
[50:59] trying to influence you to buy their
[51:01] product or to be like them and most of
[51:04] the times it's not a good thing but when
[51:06] Jesus came he came to influence a people
[51:10] a bride to be like him not only to be
[51:13] like him but now he passes that
[51:15] influence onto us that we might
[51:17] influence others so we sang that song
[51:20] lily of the valley let me be more like
[51:23] you and that should be our prayer and I
[51:25] believe that should be the prayer of
[51:27] every believer as an individual and
[51:28] every church it's more than just coming
[51:31] to church it's Lord let me be an
[51:33] influencer for you yes sir amen amen
[51:38] so I want to preach today on to be like
[51:43] Jesus and we're going to turn to Second
[51:45] Peter chapter
[51:51] 1 we're going to read verses 1- 10
[52:01] second Peter 1:
[52:06] 1-10 to be like Jesus he says Simon
[52:09] Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus
[52:13] Christ to them that have obtained like
[52:16] Precious Faith with us through the
[52:18] righteousness of God and our Savior
[52:20] Jesus Christ that's us he says Grace and
[52:23] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[52:25] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[52:28] according as his divine power hath given
[52:31] unto us all things that pertain unto
[52:34] life and godliness through the knowledge
[52:36] of him that hath called us to glory and
[52:39] virtue and I want to focus on this verse
[52:42] here whereby are given unto us exceeding
[52:44] great and precious
[52:46] promises that by these ye might be
[52:49] partakers of the divine nature having
[52:52] escaped the corruption that is in the
[52:54] world through lust so notice he's saying
[52:55] we receive precious promises that we
[52:59] might be partakers of the divine nature
[53:02] you know what I believe this message
[53:04] that we have that God sent through a
[53:05] prophet is a precious word that he has
[53:08] sent to us to do more than just have a
[53:10] following to do more than just have
[53:12] churches but that we might be partakers
[53:14] of the divine nature verse 5 and beside
[53:17] this giving all diligence add to your
[53:20] faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and
[53:23] to knowledge Temperance and to
[53:25] Temperance patience
[53:27] and to patience godliness and to
[53:29] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[53:31] brotherly kindness charity notice he
[53:34] didn't mention a single
[53:38] gift right he says be partakers of the
[53:43] divine nature there's only one divine
[53:45] nature that's God and he says this is
[53:47] what his divine nature is he doesn't
[53:49] mention a single
[53:51] gift now gifts have their place but I
[53:54] believe they should be in order and he
[53:57] says for if these things be in you and
[54:00] abound they make you that ye shall
[54:02] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[54:04] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[54:07] he that lath these things is blind and
[54:09] cannot see a far off and hath forgotten
[54:11] that he was purged from his old sins
[54:14] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[54:16] diligence to make your calling and
[54:18] election sure for if you do these things
[54:21] ye shall never fall you may have your
[54:24] seats and I was
[54:27] I read this quote and it's it's a a very
[54:30] well-known
[54:31] quote and it is the rising of the sun
[54:34] brother brandham says And he as he being
[54:36] the groom the bride has to come forth
[54:40] cuz it's a part of him and it can only
[54:42] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[54:44] of all the revelations any other has
[54:47] spoke of the
[54:48] Bride it can only manifest he says if it
[54:51] does something different from the groom
[54:53] so if the bride does something different
[54:56] from from the groom he says it isn't the
[54:58] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[55:02] life of his life power of his power she
[55:06] is him and I started thinking about this
[55:09] brother Brian I'm how what a powerful
[55:11] quote that is he says she is flesh of
[55:13] his flesh the bride the church is flesh
[55:15] of God's flesh she's bone of his bone
[55:19] she's life of his life power of his
[55:21] power and when we when we listen to that
[55:24] when we read that there's something that
[55:25] our mind goes those two right away power
[55:27] of his power and we think of of of
[55:30] powerful things raising the dead Healing
[55:32] The Sick and that is in the bride
[55:34] because it's Jesus Christ and he's in
[55:36] the bride he say she is him but I
[55:39] started thinking there there's more to
[55:41] Jesus than just healing right there's
[55:44] more to Jesus than just power physical
[55:46] power to raise a body there was more to
[55:49] Jesus than that and that's what we want
[55:51] to get into because we want to know then
[55:54] what is the divine nature of God that
[55:56] should be in US yes sir because if the
[55:59] Holy Ghost is in you if you've been
[56:00] filled with the Holy Ghost you will have
[56:03] God's divine nature in you so the first
[56:06] thing we have to find out is what is
[56:08] God's divine nature right even in the
[56:11] Old Testament we could see God's nature
[56:15] as a type when Adam came forth because
[56:17] Adam was the son of God and a son is
[56:20] like his father and when Adam came forth
[56:23] he was a God on Earth he had was in
[56:26] control of everything it was a perfect
[56:28] world and out of him came an
[56:30] eve now Satan deceived Eve and Eve fell
[56:35] the Bible says Adam was not deceived but
[56:37] Eve was deceived and Adam had every
[56:40] right to leave Eve aside and God would
[56:42] have destroyed
[56:43] her God would have destroyed Eve because
[56:46] she sinned but Adam having the nature of
[56:49] God wasn't willing to leave his bride
[56:51] aside to die but instead he stepped out
[56:55] and took her to him self he stepped into
[56:58] death to save Eve and it's the first
[57:01] Glimpse we see of the divine nature of
[57:03] God because God loved man and God so
[57:07] loved man that as soon as they fell he
[57:09] gave a promise that I will
[57:11] redeem amen that's God's divine nature I
[57:14] will redeem now because of sin and
[57:17] because of the Fall there's a law that
[57:19] comes into place and if you were to look
[57:21] at the Old Testament and the law with
[57:24] with without Holy Spirit guidance you
[57:26] think God is an Angry God you would
[57:29] think God is a god of No Mercy because
[57:31] if somebody came to the mountain and
[57:33] touched it they
[57:34] died but even in the Old Testament where
[57:37] there had to be a sacrifice a lamb
[57:39] sacrifice even there God showed his
[57:42] Mercy to some like David David was a man
[57:46] after God's Own Heart and when David
[57:48] Fell in adultery by the law he should
[57:51] have died but God's nature stepped out
[57:55] he loved David and he spared him when
[57:58] David came to to the temple and he was
[58:01] running from Saul the Bible says he took
[58:03] the showbread that only the priest
[58:05] should take and he partook of it he
[58:08] should have
[58:09] died but God's divine nature was Mercy
[58:12] yes sir amen so we see that because of
[58:15] sin God was forced to place forth A law
[58:18] but even there in the Old Testament we
[58:20] see the type of the Tabernacle in the
[58:24] wilderness where God showing there's an
[58:26] outer Court there's an inner court and
[58:28] you can be in the outer court and there
[58:30] can be winds and storms and it shakes
[58:32] you he says you can come into the inner
[58:34] court that no longer shakes you but
[58:36] you're still not in the presence of God
[58:38] but when you come into the holy of
[58:40] holies that's where God meets you and
[58:42] now the shakina glory is there nothing
[58:44] else matters God's showing I will meet
[58:47] you in that third place in the
[58:50] soul hallu Hallelujah so what's God's
[58:54] desire for man it wasn't that man should
[58:55] fall
[58:57] God's desire in his heart toward man was
[58:59] to save you know brother brandham said I
[59:02] used to think God was angry at me but
[59:06] Jesus loved
[59:08] me right he says and then I found out
[59:11] that Jesus was the very Heart Of God
[59:15] that means that Jesus is the very nature
[59:18] of God so if we're trying to find out
[59:21] what is the nature of God and how should
[59:23] it be in us then we ought to look at
[59:25] Jesus because he was God represented in
[59:27] flesh and it was God's divine nature on
[59:30] Earth and what did he
[59:32] do what did Jesus do he came to save
[59:40] amen so we find that in John 3 everybody
[59:43] knows this verse John 3:16 we want to
[59:45] know God brother brandom
[59:51] said he says that God made manifest in
[59:55] Jesus Christ which he built a body made
[59:57] his body so he was first God above us
[1:00:00] then he was God in Jesus Christ he says
[1:00:02] thirdly through the death of that body
[1:00:04] he Sanctified a church that he can dwell
[1:00:06] in and then brother brandom says what is
[1:00:08] it God condescending to his creation God
[1:00:11] wants to be worshiped the word god means
[1:00:14] object of worship and it's God trying to
[1:00:16] condition his people this is what this
[1:00:18] message came for trying to condition
[1:00:20] these people so he can get for them what
[1:00:23] he created them for you realize God
[1:00:25] every single service that we come to is
[1:00:27] God trying to condition this church and
[1:00:29] the individuals to get from you what he
[1:00:31] put in you he says he never made you to
[1:00:33] be something else besides a son and a
[1:00:35] daughter of God he says if you have
[1:00:37] missed that of being a son and a
[1:00:39] daughter of God you've missed the
[1:00:42] mark yes sir so if you've missed having
[1:00:44] God's divine nature in you you have
[1:00:46] missed the Mark if you've missed what
[1:00:50] being a Christian is what does Christian
[1:00:52] even mean to be Christlike
[1:00:56] to be Christlike not just in gifts and
[1:00:58] in power but to be Christlike in his
[1:01:00] divine
[1:01:02] nature more than just exercising power
[1:01:04] because anybody can exercise the power I
[1:01:07] was just listening to the false anointed
[1:01:08] ones at the end time they can have signs
[1:01:10] they can have wonders but what they
[1:01:12] can't have is the word living in them
[1:01:14] and flowing through them but God sent
[1:01:17] this message to bring us out of
[1:01:18] Pentecost not to leave those things
[1:01:20] behind but a furtherance to get closer
[1:01:23] to God that we could build upon that yes
[1:01:26] sir amen you know I was thinking about
[1:01:28] and I was listening to a podcast months
[1:01:29] ago about Martin
[1:01:31] Luther no sorry about
[1:01:33] Luther and about the battle that he went
[1:01:36] through he's a Catholic priest a monk
[1:01:40] and the reason he's a monk is because he
[1:01:42] thinks God is mad at him that's right
[1:01:45] and I'm listening to this and all I can
[1:01:47] think is this man thinking God is mad at
[1:01:50] him he was a Catholic and all he did was
[1:01:52] constantly beat himself up had to do
[1:01:54] Penance he was bound to a system and it
[1:01:57] was causing them to to look at God the
[1:02:00] wrong way it was causing them to not
[1:02:02] realize how God looks at him and if you
[1:02:05] can't see how God looks at you how can
[1:02:07] you look at one another the way you
[1:02:09] ought to and here's Martin Luther and he
[1:02:12] starts reading and praying and we know
[1:02:13] he was a messenger of God and when he
[1:02:15] comes upon this scripture the just shall
[1:02:18] live by faith they're talking about how
[1:02:21] Martin Luther started rejoicing and as
[1:02:23] I'm listening to that just a podcast but
[1:02:26] the spirit of the Lord started coming
[1:02:27] into the car because I realized this was
[1:02:30] Revelation this wasn't just a man
[1:02:32] reading a scripture and making up his
[1:02:34] own idea but this was predestinated of
[1:02:37] God and he realized that I don't have to
[1:02:39] pay for my sins because Jesus paid for
[1:02:42] my sins and if he paid for my sins then
[1:02:44] I'm
[1:02:45] Justified you realize that is a part of
[1:02:48] the building of God which means today
[1:02:51] you are Justified which means you don't
[1:02:53] have to pay penants you don't have to be
[1:02:55] hard on yourself when you realize that
[1:02:58] Jesus loves you and he gave his only
[1:03:01] begotten
[1:03:05] son John 3:16 for God so loved we're
[1:03:08] talking about the heart of God God so
[1:03:11] loved the what the world that he gave
[1:03:15] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:03:17] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:03:20] have everlasting
[1:03:22] life and verse 17 says for God sent KN
[1:03:25] his son into the world to do
[1:03:28] what you mean the word didn't come to
[1:03:31] condemn that's
[1:03:33] right the word didn't come to condemn it
[1:03:36] came to save Not all men will receive it
[1:03:40] as a gift from God for salvation but the
[1:03:42] word did not come to condemn and this
[1:03:45] message did not come in this day to
[1:03:48] condemn this message didn't come to
[1:03:50] separate this message didn't come so
[1:03:52] that people would be think themselves
[1:03:54] something great because have more
[1:03:56] knowledge because we're going to find
[1:03:57] out knowledge does nothing for
[1:04:01] you without the nature of God knowledge
[1:04:04] does nothing for you could lay hands and
[1:04:06] there could be healing and power and
[1:04:08] speaking of tongues without the nature
[1:04:10] of God it means
[1:04:14] nothing this is God's heart to man I
[1:04:16] will send my heart I will come down
[1:04:19] myself to save man not to condemn
[1:04:23] man so we want to see that
[1:04:26] if Jesus is a representation of the
[1:04:28] nature of God and were to be partakers
[1:04:31] of that divine nature then what was God
[1:04:34] like in
[1:04:36] flesh we know he raised the dead we know
[1:04:39] he healed the sick we know no devil
[1:04:41] could stand in his presence but what was
[1:04:43] his personality like how was he like to
[1:04:48] others right this is an introspective
[1:04:51] service which means we look at ourselves
[1:04:53] not look at our neighbor not look at the
[1:04:56] the RO or that family that doesn't do it
[1:04:58] like I do but look at
[1:05:00] yourself am Amen brother brandham said
[1:05:03] the message didn't come to build walls
[1:05:05] and there shouldn't be walls between
[1:05:07] churches that believe the message there
[1:05:09] shouldn't be walls between families that
[1:05:11] sit in a church but there should be
[1:05:13] Liberty of the holy spirit that God
[1:05:15] saved you and he saved me and you might
[1:05:18] sing different than me but you're God's
[1:05:20] son I might not be able to sing like you
[1:05:23] but I'm God's son but what's happened is
[1:05:25] all these churches have started looking
[1:05:27] at each other well you don't do it like
[1:05:29] I do it brother brand said every single
[1:05:31] church is Sovereign yes sir which means
[1:05:34] God's in control of it all but every
[1:05:35] church is different that means that your
[1:05:37] church doesn't have to be like mine and
[1:05:39] mine doesn't have to be like yours as
[1:05:41] long as Jesus is there and Jesus is the
[1:05:45] word hallelujah he so what was Jesus
[1:05:49] like Zechariah 9 prophesying of him it
[1:05:52] said Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion
[1:05:54] shout oh daughter daugh of Jerusalem
[1:05:56] behold that King cometh unto thee he is
[1:05:59] just and having salvation and he is
[1:06:03] lowly so Jesus was lowly he says in
[1:06:07] Matthew 11:29 take my yoke upon you and
[1:06:11] learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
[1:06:15] heart you mean Jesus God made flesh was
[1:06:20] on Earth and he didn't walk around with
[1:06:21] his chest sticking
[1:06:23] out no he didn't
[1:06:26] he was Meek and he was lonly so God's
[1:06:29] divine nature is to be meek and
[1:06:34] lonly so let's look at ourselves to be
[1:06:38] like
[1:06:40] Jesus he was
[1:06:42] loving you know in John 11: 3-5 it talks
[1:06:46] about when Martha and her sister Lazarus
[1:06:49] was dying and they call to Jesus and
[1:06:51] they come and say come quickly our
[1:06:52] brother is dying and the Bible says
[1:06:55] Jesus loved
[1:06:57] them now realize the way we look at love
[1:07:01] and the way God's love actually is is
[1:07:03] very different because when we think of
[1:07:05] love I love my son I love my children
[1:07:08] and if they want something and and
[1:07:09] they're hurt not just want something but
[1:07:12] they're hurt and they need help my love
[1:07:14] to them is to go immediately to their
[1:07:16] help and it should be but here Jesus
[1:07:19] says he loved them and yet he went on
[1:07:21] his way for two more
[1:07:23] days if it was the way we thought of
[1:07:25] Jesus loves me he should come right away
[1:07:28] when I pray he should be there heal me
[1:07:31] right away he didn't do that but he
[1:07:33] loved
[1:07:38] them how should we be then to be like
[1:07:41] Jesus we're talking about Jesus loved a
[1:07:43] rich young ruler came to
[1:07:46] Jesus and said what can I do to inherit
[1:07:49] eternal
[1:07:51] life and Jesus the Bible says looking
[1:07:53] upon Him loved him yeah now was this
[1:07:56] Rich Young Ruler a
[1:08:00] predestinated no we find out later he's
[1:08:02] in hell because he couldn't listen to
[1:08:04] the word but that didn't change how
[1:08:06] Jesus treated him the Bible says Jesus
[1:08:09] loved him sir which means Jesus loved
[1:08:12] even unbelievers Jesus loved make
[1:08:15] Believers Jesus loved
[1:08:18] everyone right he came to save the world
[1:08:21] not to condemn them he didn't come to
[1:08:23] condemn that Rich Young Ruler he came
[1:08:25] and he loved him amen now the love of
[1:08:29] Jesus the love of God is very different
[1:08:31] than how the world portrays it today
[1:08:33] because the love of God will love you
[1:08:36] and change you and it's corrective
[1:08:38] brother brandom says if God loves you he
[1:08:40] will correct you and it'd be like if you
[1:08:42] saw Junior on the street and you just
[1:08:44] left him there and said now Junior don't
[1:08:46] do that but he's in danger you ought to
[1:08:49] bring him in and teach him maybe with a
[1:08:50] little spank that you can't go there
[1:08:53] it's for your
[1:08:54] good amen that is the love of God
[1:08:57] corrective
[1:08:58] love so he loved the Rich Young
[1:09:01] Ruler and he stood there Jesus the
[1:09:05] divine nature of God and he hung on a
[1:09:07] tree and they had taken a crown of
[1:09:10] thorns and put it on his head they had
[1:09:12] put nails in his hands and his feet they
[1:09:15] had striped
[1:09:16] him laughed at him mocked him done all
[1:09:19] these things and if there was ever a man
[1:09:21] that had a right to not love somebody
[1:09:24] and to be
[1:09:26] vindictive it was Jesus on the cross but
[1:09:29] the Bible says he looked upon him and he
[1:09:31] said father forgive
[1:09:35] them think about the nature of God that
[1:09:37] he loved them and he was
[1:09:40] forgiving that he would look at people
[1:09:42] who hated him laughed at him mocked them
[1:09:44] striped them and he didn't say father
[1:09:46] curse them he said father forgive them
[1:09:49] amen how different was it than the two
[1:09:52] disciples the sons of thunder they came
[1:09:54] into a city and they came with Jesus and
[1:09:57] they rejected him and they looked at
[1:09:58] Jesus and they said Jesus should we call
[1:10:01] fire down from heaven and Destroy them
[1:10:03] and Jesus looked at him and said you
[1:10:05] don't even know what Spirit you're of
[1:10:08] because I didn't come to destroy I came
[1:10:10] to
[1:10:11] save think about the mercy of God made
[1:10:14] flesh even in the Old Testament that he
[1:10:16] would come to Sodom and gomorah and he
[1:10:19] was going to wipe them away and if
[1:10:21] anybody deserved to be wiped away it was
[1:10:23] them and yet Abraham
[1:10:26] interceded and he said God if there's 50
[1:10:29] righteous will you spare them and the
[1:10:31] mercy of a merciful forgiving God said
[1:10:34] if there is 50 I will
[1:10:36] spare that's right Abraham said 45 he
[1:10:39] said I will spare the nature of God I
[1:10:42] will forgive I will spare he came all
[1:10:45] the way to five and he said if there is
[1:10:47] five in all of West Palm Beach even
[1:10:50] though there's sin on every corner and
[1:10:52] there's homosexuality and Satan has
[1:10:54] taken but if there's five I will
[1:10:57] spare
[1:10:59] am how different from those two
[1:11:01] disciples who had
[1:11:04] power they had received a Ministry of
[1:11:07] power and yet they were willing to look
[1:11:09] at a people and say I will destroy you
[1:11:12] because you won't receive me but that
[1:11:14] wasn't
[1:11:15] Jesus and that's not this message that
[1:11:19] wasn't brother brandom you know there
[1:11:21] might be people that come after and take
[1:11:23] the message and want to use it to beat
[1:11:25] each other up and talk about each other
[1:11:27] and take quotes and sling them at each
[1:11:28] other right but that wasn't the nature
[1:11:30] of Jesus and that wasn't the nature of
[1:11:32] Jesus today through a message but he
[1:11:35] came to save and to
[1:11:40] forgive Jesus was
[1:11:43] loving merciful and
[1:11:46] forgiving even to those who would not
[1:11:51] accept to be like Jesus then brother
[1:11:54] Rand says she is power power of his
[1:11:56] power tell me what's more
[1:11:59] powerful to for somebody to be sick to
[1:12:02] be
[1:12:03] healed or to
[1:12:07] forgive what's
[1:12:11] power what's more important for the
[1:12:13] bride to be able to exercise a gift or
[1:12:16] to have the nature of God in them and to
[1:12:19] love to forgive to pray for one another
[1:12:23] not to talk about one another not to to
[1:12:26] anticipate that somebody's going to make
[1:12:27] a mistake and when they fall I see I
[1:12:29] knew they were going to make a mistake
[1:12:31] but to say let me bear that load let me
[1:12:33] pray for you let me help restore you as
[1:12:36] Jesus restored me let him restore you
[1:12:39] and let it be through me lily of the
[1:12:41] valley let your sweet Aroma flow through
[1:12:44] this
[1:12:48] church you know the Bible says these
[1:12:51] signs shall follow them that believe not
[1:12:54] them that believe will follow after
[1:12:55] signs they will believe and the signs
[1:12:58] will follow that means you don't have to
[1:13:00] be sign Seekers you don't have to se
[1:13:03] gifts and power you just believe God and
[1:13:06] watch it come you just believe God and
[1:13:09] watch him heal your sick watch him save
[1:13:12] your lost watch him go after your sons
[1:13:14] and daughters that have gone out you
[1:13:16] just believe
[1:13:18] God to be like Jesus
[1:13:22] amen he was so merciful
[1:13:26] how many people are like Pharisees today
[1:13:28] that they brought a woman caught in
[1:13:31] adultery and they threw her before the
[1:13:33] word they threw her before Jesus and
[1:13:35] they knew Moses said she should die
[1:13:39] Jesus the heart of God see in the Old
[1:13:42] Testament she should have died but Jesus
[1:13:44] didn't come to condemn he came to save
[1:13:47] and the Heart of God started riding in
[1:13:50] the
[1:13:51] sand the Pharisees wanted the justice of
[1:13:54] God
[1:13:56] and how many people are just looking for
[1:13:57] the justice of God Pastor they deserve
[1:14:00] to be kicked out that family deserves to
[1:14:03] be left aside brother bam said when they
[1:14:05] draw you out draw the circle
[1:14:09] bigger and the Pharisees wanted God's
[1:14:12] justice but Jesus didn't come to have
[1:14:15] Justice he came to
[1:14:17] forgive and there's a woman that deserve
[1:14:20] death and the Heart of God said he that
[1:14:24] is without sin
[1:14:26] go ahead and cast the first stone
[1:14:29] huh he that is without sin go ahead and
[1:14:32] text somebody about who did
[1:14:34] what he that has never made a mistake go
[1:14:38] ahead and run somebody over with your
[1:14:41] words and the Bible says that every
[1:14:43] single one of those Pharisees had their
[1:14:45] rocks and they dropped them because they
[1:14:48] realized I have
[1:14:50] sinned I have made mistakes and even now
[1:14:54] I'm seeking God's Justice you don't know
[1:14:56] what Spirit you of Jesus didn't come to
[1:14:59] condemn but to
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:02] save Jesus looked upon this woman
[1:15:05] because he knew who she was and he knew
[1:15:07] that it didn't matter how dark it had
[1:15:09] gotten there was a seed of God there the
[1:15:12] same seed was in another woman and Jesus
[1:15:16] loved her and he went by her where the
[1:15:18] Bible says he had needs to go by
[1:15:21] Samaria amen and even the disciples who
[1:15:25] had power wouldn't understand so he sent
[1:15:28] him away they won't understand what God
[1:15:32] the Jesus the heart of God is here to do
[1:15:33] and he sat by a well at a certain time
[1:15:36] because he knew this woman's been
[1:15:38] ostracized nobody wants her she's been
[1:15:41] married six seven
[1:15:43] times she has sinned that if she came
[1:15:46] into think about it if she came into
[1:15:48] this church today if that woman caught
[1:15:50] an adultery walked into this church
[1:15:52] today how would you think
[1:15:55] how would you feel what would you would
[1:15:57] you be the Pharisee or would you be
[1:16:00] Jesus she is him she has power of his
[1:16:04] power and he had power to forgive yes
[1:16:08] siren and we're talking about a grand
[1:16:11] story but how much more to forgive one
[1:16:13] another oh my brother didn't shake my
[1:16:16] hand but I forgive him oh my brother
[1:16:18] talked about me my sister talked about
[1:16:20] me but I forgive them release them let
[1:16:25] them
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:28] go he went by the well because he knew
[1:16:32] this woman needs
[1:16:34] Mercy she might look like she has
[1:16:36] nothing to do with church but I'm here
[1:16:38] to
[1:16:39] savej when everybody else would reject
[1:16:42] you he said I'll take you right you've
[1:16:45] had six husbands you've had six men in
[1:16:48] your life let him be that seventh man
[1:16:51] that comes and restores and makes whole
[1:16:54] right right amen
[1:16:55] huj and you may have gone from
[1:16:57] denomination to denomination from man's
[1:17:00] idea to man's idea why don't you let
[1:17:02] this seventh age message be what makes
[1:17:04] you
[1:17:10] whole this is
[1:17:12] important it is life and death it is
[1:17:17] more
[1:17:19] important and and hear me right it is
[1:17:22] more important than how many gifts you
[1:17:24] can exercise
[1:17:27] am it is it is more
[1:17:33] important so if Jesus was the heart of
[1:17:37] God then it shows us how we should be so
[1:17:41] this is why I said it's an introspective
[1:17:43] service am my to be like we sing the
[1:17:45] song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus
[1:17:48] on Earth I want to be like him and so
[1:17:51] many people are just influenced and they
[1:17:53] just want to have big meanings and power
[1:17:55] brother brandham said that was
[1:17:57] Pentecostal bait because they would sit
[1:18:00] there and they were speaking tongues and
[1:18:02] he said he saw two men speaking in
[1:18:04] tongues and translating speaking in
[1:18:05] tongues and translating and he said I
[1:18:07] had a gift and I wanted to know what is
[1:18:10] this so he walked up and he started
[1:18:12] talking to him and
[1:18:13] Discerning and he said one of them was a
[1:18:16] real
[1:18:18] Christian yes sir a real man of God had
[1:18:22] the love of God in his heart exercising
[1:18:25] a gift but he was another one also
[1:18:28] exercising a gift and he said this man
[1:18:31] was had a wife living with another woman
[1:18:33] had a child by another woman and brother
[1:18:35] brandom said as soon as he confronted
[1:18:37] him about it he he ran
[1:18:39] away
[1:18:42] sir gifts and callings are without
[1:18:47] repentance so if Jesus
[1:18:50] loved if Jesus
[1:18:53] forgave if Jesus was Meek and lonely
[1:18:56] then the bride who has his divine nature
[1:18:59] who is power of his power flesh of his
[1:19:02] flesh bone of his bone she is him so if
[1:19:05] he forgave she will forgive and if he
[1:19:08] loved those who didn't love him she will
[1:19:10] love those who don't love
[1:19:12] her she won't be like those two
[1:19:14] disciples let me just burn them up
[1:19:16] that's not what the power came to do
[1:19:18] brother the brandom said power without
[1:19:20] character is
[1:19:21] satanic amen
[1:19:28] then how important is
[1:19:32] it how important is it Paul talks about
[1:19:38] it and he talks about it in 1
[1:19:41] Corinthians 12 verse
[1:19:47] 27 now gifts have their place and Paul
[1:19:50] came to this church a Corinthian Church
[1:19:52] and when he came he said what is this
[1:19:55] here some of you say I'm of Apollos some
[1:19:58] of Paul some of sephus which is Peter
[1:20:01] and some of you just say I'm of Jesus
[1:20:04] and then he says what is this I hear
[1:20:05] that when I come every one of you has a
[1:20:06] tongue every one of you has a prophecy
[1:20:08] every one of you has something and he
[1:20:10] says let me set this straight because
[1:20:12] see this was a Church of God but they
[1:20:15] needed to be set straight in the word
[1:20:18] because gifts follow them that believe
[1:20:20] signs follow them that believe but they
[1:20:22] have to be placed in the right order and
[1:20:24] brother brandom said how many times and
[1:20:26] I'll read the quote later how many
[1:20:28] people have gone after it the wrong way
[1:20:30] and they end up on the side of the road
[1:20:32] crashed sir figuratively speaking he
[1:20:34] says I've seen it you've seen it he says
[1:20:36] many
[1:20:37] preachers right many preachers go after
[1:20:40] the wrong way and they end up on the
[1:20:42] side of the road many young people go
[1:20:44] after it the wrong way and they end up
[1:20:46] on the side of the road because there's
[1:20:48] denominational thinking you know that
[1:20:50] you can bring a denominational idea into
[1:20:52] the message and wrap it in message lingo
[1:20:56] but it's still
[1:20:57] denomination you know when you're just
[1:20:59] seeking a gift and making you know
[1:21:01] you're that you're just rapping
[1:21:02] something because Pentecostal believes
[1:21:04] that you have to speak in tongues that's
[1:21:06] a sign an Evidence brother what did
[1:21:08] Brother brandom say the evidence of the
[1:21:09] Holy Spirit was he says to receive the
[1:21:12] word for your
[1:21:14] day he had an interview with the sister
[1:21:18] and she was saying brother
[1:21:20] brandom I just want to know do I have
[1:21:22] the Holy Spirit and brother brandom said
[1:21:24] sister I've combed through your life
[1:21:27] with this gift of my life combed and
[1:21:28] I've seen nothing that tells me
[1:21:30] otherwise and she said but I make so
[1:21:32] many mistakes and brother brandham said
[1:21:35] it's not the mistakes that that's why
[1:21:36] the blood is there he says sister I
[1:21:38] believe you have the Holy Ghost so
[1:21:40] here's a
[1:21:41] sister that makes so many mistakes and
[1:21:44] the prophet Combs through her life and
[1:21:45] can't even see them because the blood
[1:21:48] was there yes sir Hallelujah so Paul
[1:21:52] says in 1 Corinthians 12: 26 s he says
[1:21:56] now ye are the body of Christ and
[1:21:59] members in
[1:22:01] particular and God has set some in the
[1:22:03] church first apostles secondarily
[1:22:05] prophets thirdly teachers after that
[1:22:07] Miracles then Gifts of healing helps
[1:22:09] governments diversities of tongues he
[1:22:11] says are all Apostles are all prophets
[1:22:14] are all teachers are all workers of
[1:22:16] Miracles have all the gifts of healing
[1:22:18] do all speak with tongues do all
[1:22:20] interpret he says but cover earnestly
[1:22:22] the best gifts and some people stop
[1:22:24] right there and they say then I'm going
[1:22:27] to just covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:22:29] and we ought to but Paul goes on and he
[1:22:33] says and yet I show unto you a more
[1:22:36] excellent
[1:22:38] way so you mean there's a more something
[1:22:41] more important than just gifts in a
[1:22:44] church that's
[1:22:45] right he says covet them seek after them
[1:22:49] but I'm going to show you something more
[1:22:51] important it's more excellent it's
[1:22:53] better than what you're thinking you
[1:22:54] have and he goes into verse one of the
[1:22:56] next chapter and he says this is the
[1:22:58] more excellent way he says though I
[1:23:00] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[1:23:02] I don't have charity which is love he
[1:23:05] said I am become as a sounding brass or
[1:23:08] a tinkling
[1:23:09] symbol he says and though I have the
[1:23:11] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:23:14] Mysteries and have all knowledge think
[1:23:17] about that though I could take the Seven
[1:23:19] Seals and I could explain it perfectly
[1:23:23] and I have just the right Revelation but
[1:23:25] if I don't have love and I'm busy here
[1:23:28] trying to throw off on another brother
[1:23:30] while he doesn't believe it like I do
[1:23:31] he's wrong and if you don't believe in
[1:23:33] my way then you're lost he says I could
[1:23:35] have every knowledge understand every
[1:23:37] single mystery I could have listened to
[1:23:39] every message and know how to explain it
[1:23:40] but if I don't have love it serves me
[1:23:46] nothing prise the Lord
[1:23:49] nothing but man has gone after the
[1:23:52] knowledge and understanding all
[1:23:54] Mysteries but they've put the cart
[1:23:56] before the horse because without the
[1:23:58] holy spirit all they've done is made
[1:24:01] denominational message
[1:24:06] churches that say it is my way or the
[1:24:09] highway and they set up men with special
[1:24:13] Revelations when God didn't send us an
[1:24:15] eighth messenger God sent a seventh
[1:24:17] messenger and he said when this seventh
[1:24:19] messenger begins to sound all the
[1:24:22] mysteries of God will be finished
[1:24:24] which means I don't need any other man's
[1:24:26] Revelation all I need is the message
[1:24:29] that God sent through a prophet because
[1:24:31] they finished every mystery and you know
[1:24:33] what if there's something that I can't
[1:24:35] quite grasp or something people say
[1:24:37] brother brandom didn't touch on
[1:24:38] everything if there's something he
[1:24:40] didn't give us brother brandom said it
[1:24:41] says right here seven seal
[1:24:45] stop don't go further and if God would
[1:24:48] tell a prophet stop don't go further
[1:24:52] then what business do I have trying to
[1:24:55] figure out what it was
[1:24:58] right what business does the church have
[1:25:00] trying to add to it when God told the
[1:25:03] prophet
[1:25:04] stop which means if God told him to stop
[1:25:08] then everything we need for a Rapture is
[1:25:10] already there that's because he said
[1:25:12] this seventh message will for come the
[1:25:15] coming the second coming right
[1:25:18] amen so there's no need to add to it
[1:25:22] just stop just believe it
[1:25:25] yes just believe it brother brandham
[1:25:27] said they said brother Brandon what
[1:25:28] should we do he said don't try to make
[1:25:30] all these Fantastics he said just live a
[1:25:33] simple Christian Life which means to be
[1:25:35] Christ like to be like him so don't try
[1:25:40] to seek the mystery and the knowledge
[1:25:41] and seek it just stop just ask God God
[1:25:44] whatever you want for me reveal it to me
[1:25:46] feed on the word and then just live like
[1:25:48] Jesus lived Love Like Jesus loved
[1:25:50] forgive like Jesus forgave
[1:25:55] Hallelujah that'll be a settled Church
[1:25:58] brother Brandon said I'd rather have the
[1:26:00] wrong Doctrine and the right Spirit
[1:26:03] that's powerful because today many of us
[1:26:06] would rather have and are seeking after
[1:26:08] just the right Doctrine right Doctrine
[1:26:09] right Doctrine and have forgotten about
[1:26:12] the right
[1:26:16] spirit and Paul says and though I have
[1:26:20] all Faith so that I could remove
[1:26:22] mountains and if I don't have love
[1:26:23] charity I am nothing he says and though
[1:26:26] I bestow all my goods to feed the poor
[1:26:29] and though I give my body to be burned
[1:26:32] and have not charity if I give my body
[1:26:35] to be
[1:26:36] burned and I don't love
[1:26:39] God so somebody can give their body to
[1:26:42] be burned and not have the love of God
[1:26:45] in
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] them it profiteth me
[1:26:52] nothing he says now this is what love is
[1:26:55] Charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:26:59] charity envieth not think about yourself
[1:27:01] I'm thinking about myself charity
[1:27:02] vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up
[1:27:05] it does not behave itself unseemly it
[1:27:07] seeketh not her own what brother Brandon
[1:27:09] say eternal life was living for
[1:27:13] others seeketh not her own is not easily
[1:27:16] provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not
[1:27:19] in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth
[1:27:21] charity love doesn't rejoice when
[1:27:23] somebody Falls and says I knew they were
[1:27:25] going to fall I knew that young person
[1:27:27] couldn't make it I knew they were just
[1:27:28] Faking It when they went to the altar
[1:27:30] now look at them where they are charity
[1:27:32] doesn't puff itself up it doesn't
[1:27:34] rejoice in evil but It suffers
[1:27:38] Long Hall he says it beareth all things
[1:27:42] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:27:44] endureth all things he says charity
[1:27:47] never
[1:27:49] fails now whether there be prophecies
[1:27:52] they shall fail
[1:27:55] and whether there be tongues they're
[1:27:56] going to
[1:27:57] cease we need them they're in the body
[1:28:01] they're in the church but they're going
[1:28:02] to
[1:28:04] cease whether there be knowledge it's
[1:28:07] going to vanish
[1:28:08] away listen to what Paul says for we
[1:28:11] know in
[1:28:12] part and we prophesy in part but when
[1:28:16] that which is perfect is come then that
[1:28:19] which is in part shall be done away
[1:28:23] am we
[1:28:25] prophesy there's gifts in the church
[1:28:27] there's healing there's speaking in
[1:28:28] tongues but that's just in part because
[1:28:31] there's going to come a time when that
[1:28:32] will be no more we won't need healing on
[1:28:35] the other
[1:28:37] side we won't need speaking in tongues
[1:28:39] on the other side there'll be no need
[1:28:41] for prophecy over there because it'll be
[1:28:44] all whole it'll be perfect as God
[1:28:46] ordained it there'll be no more need to
[1:28:49] edify because there'll be Perfection so
[1:28:52] these gifts will cease
[1:28:54] we need them now I need healing now
[1:28:57] because my boys get sick because I get
[1:28:59] sick your little niece needs healing now
[1:29:02] but on the other side there'll be no
[1:29:04] need for healing because there'll be no
[1:29:06] sickness there'll be no sorrow there'll
[1:29:09] be no need to pray for a lost loved one
[1:29:12] because they'll be there made
[1:29:14] whole and yet the church has gone after
[1:29:17] these things that will cease and they've
[1:29:20] sought after them and seek them and when
[1:29:22] and coveted after them than they should
[1:29:25] when it's going to
[1:29:27] cease Paul says this is the more
[1:29:29] excellent way you could exercise nothing
[1:29:32] but if you have the love of God which is
[1:29:34] this message in the Holy Spirit in your
[1:29:37] heart that's all you
[1:29:41] need and brother brandham said the exact
[1:29:44] same
[1:29:45] thing and God told him the exact same
[1:29:48] thing because he went beyond the curtain
[1:29:50] of
[1:29:51] time yes sir and he said he got there
[1:29:53] and it was
[1:29:54] Perfection and he said all these young
[1:29:56] ladies and all these young men and he
[1:29:58] said the young ladies would come hug him
[1:30:00] and he said there was no feeling there
[1:30:03] as we have now he says here we ought not
[1:30:05] to hug brothers and sisters because
[1:30:07] there's feelings but he says on that
[1:30:09] side none of that was there sin was gone
[1:30:12] Tru oh and he looked around and he said
[1:30:15] what is
[1:30:17] this and he said the voice said these
[1:30:19] are your people and he thought these are
[1:30:23] all Broms and he said no no these are
[1:30:25] your
[1:30:27] converts and we know what he said he
[1:30:29] said they're going to be here and stand
[1:30:31] judged with you by what you preached and
[1:30:34] he said will Paul and his group be
[1:30:35] judged and he said yes and he said well
[1:30:37] if he makes it we'll make it because I
[1:30:39] preached what Paul preached and all
[1:30:43] those Souls thousands upon Millions said
[1:30:45] we are resting on
[1:30:47] that and brother brandom's there and he
[1:30:51] says still can't quite understand what
[1:30:53] this is and he says what is this and the
[1:30:55] voice says this is divine
[1:30:59] love
[1:31:00] Hallelujah everything you've ever
[1:31:03] preached everything you've ever believed
[1:31:05] here it is divine love and it's the
[1:31:08] voice said nothing can enter here
[1:31:11] without
[1:31:13] it amen and brother Brandon said when he
[1:31:16] came to he said I am more convinced than
[1:31:20] ever that it'll take Divine love to make
[1:31:23] it there sir amen here's a prophet who
[1:31:28] seen Miracles who has seen it all dead
[1:31:32] raised tumors fall
[1:31:35] yes and he says it'll take Divine love
[1:31:39] to get to that
[1:31:45] place the Bible says God they'll come to
[1:31:49] me and they'll say haven't I done so
[1:31:51] many wonderful works in your name
[1:31:54] and he said depart from me for I never
[1:31:57] even knew
[1:31:59] you she is flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:32:02] his bone power of his power she is him
[1:32:07] what are we looking at how are we trying
[1:32:10] to be like him brother Caper sang that
[1:32:13] song lily of the valley Let Your Love
[1:32:15] throw through me the sister sang the
[1:32:17] song let everything I do for Jesus be
[1:32:19] love yes right love because you could
[1:32:23] exercise every single gift and miss it
[1:32:26] all but if you have Divine love it'll
[1:32:29] only take Divine love to get to this
[1:32:33] place and when you have
[1:32:37] love when you believe and have love then
[1:32:40] watch all the gifts start coming in
[1:32:44] place because brother Brandon said faith
[1:32:47] and love go together and they operate
[1:32:49] the
[1:32:51] gifts so we said it's an interest
[1:32:53] perspective service look at ourselves
[1:32:55] Lord then help me this ought to be our
[1:32:57] prayer help me to be like you and when I
[1:33:01] say Lord help me to be like you help me
[1:33:03] to Love Like You Loved help me to
[1:33:05] forgive like you
[1:33:07] forgave help me to be like you and you
[1:33:09] add everything else the Bible says these
[1:33:12] signs shall follow Lord let me just
[1:33:14] believe and let these signs follow let's
[1:33:17] all stand amen
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:33] brother brandom says and that's what
[1:33:34] we're supposed to do reflect the Son of
[1:33:38] God and now we're supposed to do his
[1:33:40] work he said he that believeth on me St
[1:33:42] John 14:7 he that believeth on me the
[1:33:45] works that I do shall he do also you're
[1:33:47] beginning to reflect the works of Christ
[1:33:50] but he says but so many of us try to do
[1:33:52] the works of Christ before the
[1:33:54] reflection of Christ is in us he said
[1:33:57] now there's the trouble we find those
[1:33:59] things happening you know it and I know
[1:34:01] it we see these stumbles along the road
[1:34:03] we find a scrap heap of ministers and of
[1:34:06] Christians piled along the road is
[1:34:08] because they didn't go into it right the
[1:34:10] statue of a perfect man so father let's
[1:34:14] all bow our
[1:34:15] heads that ought to be our prayer the
[1:34:18] prayer of every single individual in
[1:34:20] this
[1:34:21] church Lord I don't want to just go
[1:34:24] after the works let your reflection be
[1:34:26] in me first and everything else will
[1:34:28] take care of itself you realize it's God
[1:34:31] that operates the gifts yes sir it's God
[1:34:34] that heals not a man it's God that saves
[1:34:38] not a parent or a preacher and it's God
[1:34:41] That
[1:34:42] Forgives and if it's God that does all
[1:34:44] that then our desire ought to be Lord
[1:34:46] let you come in and flow through
[1:34:50] us we said it was an introspective
[1:34:52] service so if there's any here that can
[1:34:55] look at our lives and we all ought to
[1:34:56] look and realize Lord I've fallen short
[1:35:00] maybe I've had my eyes on the wrong
[1:35:02] thing maybe I haven't quite acted how
[1:35:04] you acted Lord you forgave the
[1:35:06] unforgivable you loved the unlovable you
[1:35:09] were
[1:35:10] patient you didn't give up on anybody
[1:35:14] Peter looked at you and you knew he was
[1:35:16] going to betray you and you said I have
[1:35:19] prayed for you Hallelujah not Peter I
[1:35:21] knew you would do this but I have pray
[1:35:23] prayed for you and when you are
[1:35:26] converted strengthen the Brethren notice
[1:35:29] Jesus didn't give up on his own the
[1:35:31] Bible says having loved his own he loved
[1:35:34] them unto the end and here we are we're
[1:35:37] at the end time and that word holds true
[1:35:39] Jesus loves his own till the end so
[1:35:43] father my prayer for this church Lord
[1:35:46] for each individual
[1:35:49] father is that your love Lord would flow
[1:35:52] through us
[1:35:54] father you you gave us this message it's
[1:35:57] a precious message and you didn't give
[1:35:59] it to us Lord just to Puff us up to make
[1:36:02] us think we're somebody but you gave it
[1:36:04] to us Lord that we might be partakers of
[1:36:06] your divine nature Lord your Prophet
[1:36:09] said not for one moment do I come to to
[1:36:11] make men followers but I come to
[1:36:13] establish a relationship between man and
[1:36:17] Jesus Christ and father I believe that's
[1:36:19] the desire of every everybody here every
[1:36:22] Minister every Church that believes your
[1:36:24] word is we want to see established a
[1:36:27] relationship between your bride and you
[1:36:30] father your Prophet said she is bone of
[1:36:33] his bone flesh of his flesh she is him
[1:36:36] she is power of his power father then
[1:36:38] let us look at what real power is and
[1:36:41] that's your divine nature Lord let us
[1:36:43] forgive like you forgave father Lord let
[1:36:46] us love like you loved Let Your Love
[1:36:48] flow through US father and you'll take
[1:36:50] care of the rest father you promised it
[1:36:52] Lord you sent us this message to Rapture
