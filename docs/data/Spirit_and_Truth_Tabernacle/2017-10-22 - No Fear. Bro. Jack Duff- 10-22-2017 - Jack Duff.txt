before we just pray I just wanted to just take a quick moment to tell everyone thank you a man for last Sunday the celebration was just really a blessing just a reflection of 15 years a man and and

we'll read a scripture we started a path on Friday night and we will continue that path on today and just trust in the Lord just see it the glory in the honor a man from this some of the other I think one of the other announcements we forgot to mention there will be from my class there will be no Sunday school for the next two weeks a man for my class and then also for there will be no Friday night services for the next three weeks next three weeks no Friday night services we'll have Wednesday night amen and Sunday morning but no Friday night services for the next three weeks so just keep that in mind I will be traveling and this week I'll be I have to go to a wedding up in Boston but soon as I get back I'll be back next Sunday and man with you all because I I just love y'all like that a man and but I'll be back next Sunday and then after a up Monday the 30th I believe in going to Israel a man for about nine or 10 days and a man it's a life lifelong dream of mine to go and God has blessed me to go so I'm looking forward to it and distrust in an hour this is a trip I'm going by myself so a man I'm looking just to spend some quality time with the Lord a man I'm looking for him to speak to me inspire me you know and you know and I prayed it will all reap the benefits a man from from from that journey so we just we just looking forward talk about got a store so let's read amen here out of Matthew 14 and we will pick up you know where we left off a man of some things are left intentionally out and I wanted to go back a man and just try to bring us forward and then from bring us bring us forth from Friday night and then go for from there so here Matthew 14 verse 22 a man that says in a straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him to the other side while he sent the multitudes away now those of you that were here Friday night as we reread the scripture Jesus already knew what was getting read had happened okay he already knew what was going happening so notice he constraining them ok so there's probably discussions going back and forth as to you know why they should just wait with him you know but know he knows what's gonna happen so he's know y'all get on in the ship go on I'll take care of this go ahead and do this praise the Lord so straightway Jesus constrained his disciples you know to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray glory to God and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary a man now the wind is contrary the situation has changed and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea my god just think about how long they were in this condition before he showed up and brother branham likes to preach is you know in your darkest hour then Jesus comes anybody in a dark hour well you you ought to be looking for Jesus in your darkest hour then Jesus comes right and man he goes on to say the Bible says and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled now they were already in trouble by being on a dangerous sea but now here that there's more it's magnified because they see somebody walking a man towards them on water that just now you come on this imagine if this was you out there on that ship I'm already messed up being out here right and and and well let me just please let me keep going I'm trying man I bring you four it says I says when it's like I'm walking them see they were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus picking them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid o glory and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he and he thought he was asking for something impossible you think you asking God for something impossible I gotta blow your mind hey man it says up and and and Peter Peter handsome said lord if it be thou bid me come under the on the water he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship can't you see them getting down that machine can you see them got y'all got the seat Peter getting out the ship onto water notice I didn't say into water I said own to water here here Peter just getting out the ship glory their God some of them decipher light now wait a minute I had never seen them like this but look the Bible say if see he said come and when Peter was come down out of ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous now now the way it was boisterous before he got out of the ship but when he started winning boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me maybe he's just a little enthused that's why I said what he said but nothing nonetheless Peter walked in his enthusiasm he walked and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou a little faith that was the key thing just faith will allowed him to do that without a little faith wherefore didst thou doubt so when you have faith you can't mix it with doubt as as you're walking in faith you can do all things but when just a little doubt come in it began to change your situation and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the Son of God let's pray father we thank you for the opportunity to read the word but we are trusting it the Holy Spirit would just make things clearer to us as we've read your your word God we want to pray for all the believers that were not able to make it today we heard from the Johnson family and them not being able to make it and also brother Garin and his job calling a man we heard from him others we haven't heard from but we know God that you're in control so we just pray for each and every person that you were just strengthened and now we that are here we've already felt your presence in this place but now God as we go into your word may you help us Lord to see it more clear and that we would not just say we heard a good message but father may we leave here living and manifesting the things that we hear it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless y'all can be seated amen ma'am so we titled a man the service sermon on Friday night fear not and i'ma use pretty much the same thing but today I'm gonna call it no fear all right no fear no fear and you know as just just again you're looking at that scripture there in Matthew 14 we can there's a number of things here that we can draw our attention to brother Branham described their situation I won't read the whole quote I'll just read a portion of this but I'll tell you what message I got it out of came from Jehovah Jireh just a little portion it says now their ship was waterlogged and the sails was broke all right so we get the better description of what's going on when I say that they were tossed there and with the wave so this ship was one along the sails was broke the oars was gone and they were holding one another screaming I want to get that in your mind these disciples men of the sea their ship is waterlogged their cells are broken their oars were gone and they're holding one another screaming a man they're holding one another screaming brother Branham gives us this this description and as we look at this some of the the the the information that we may need to also look at before we go deeper is before they got in this condition a man if we would have just read a few verses before it would talked about how Jesus had just finished feeding 5,000 people right and here they were were man that was sitting there encouraging Jesus to send the people away because you know they had been there all day are feasting on the Word of God but the people were hungry and they needed to they needed to eat but the shops were closing and all these things and and they were encouraging Jesus please send the people away so they can get something to eat but but Jesus amen when they come to him with the problem amen the solution that Jesus gave them when they say Jesus our people are hungry you know let them let them depart that's the solution that Jesus can't say Jesus say they don't need to depart and then they probably looked at them it was like what you mean they don't even apart they haven't eaten all day that I mean if the people are hungry and and you've been preaching a long time Jesus Jesus say they don't need it apart and then Jesus adds another statement he say you give them something to eat and this is where the dialogue begins like now now wait Jesus you want us to feed these people we don't even have anything so so so you know when you start eating this and the other Gospels you see how you know Jesus tell them to go in and search I can't see how much food is out there and when they come back and then with the report I can just imagine Peter standing up Jesus Lee how much food you got 5,000 people a man and y'all got to get that in your head 5,000 people and the food report is we got two fish and five loaves of bread I can imagine Peter probably standing with an attitude Jesus you know what we found we told you to send these people away but you didn't want to listen so so we got a report we got two fish and five loaves of bread what you gonna do with that Jesus say sit down have them all sit down and companies like 15 he took the bread and the fish he blessed it and he began to break it and it began to multiply right there and these brothers saw that the brother brother branham say as they were in the ship when Jesus encouraged him to leave you know they were in the ship he said could imagine John just kind of stepping up said maybe it's quiet for about ten minutes he said but all of a sudden John said man I noticed the son of God I ain't never seen nothing like this tomorrow all my life five thousand people get fat with two fish and five loaves of bread and then we got something we got we got leftovers so I ain't never seen this has got to be the Son of God they're just encouraging and talking to one another but in the midst of that testimony service we have a situation where their ship gets waterlog the sails are broke the oars are gone and they're holding one another and screaming and the problem is is that this is what life is really like for many of us we can come amen the church and have a mighty service we can go other places and see God do great things but then when we settle back down and life becomes life come on somebody and then all we life becomes life all of a sudden the trials begin to hit but but when the trials hit don't forget what God has already done don't don't don't don't don't act like you got everything you can't remember what God did for you last week because if he did it before he's able to do it again and again so here you know you know that you know the Prophet tells us that day their ship is what along the sails was broke the oars was gone they were holding one another there they're screaming you know and and and and if you're in that situation you're in the middle of the sea glory to God and and and and you're in there you got a stale and you know you've depending on the wind and kind of carry sail but here your sail is broken so now you're your backup is to use yours oh my god so when your first plan fails and when your second plan fails what do you do the question is do you do you have fear because because I might as well give it answer that's not the solution to your problem to have fear and then you you gotta approach life with no fear come on I don't care amen their situation is something on the sea you got to apply this to whatever you go through you got to approach it with no fear if you hurt a bad report from the doctor no fear if your children are acting up no fear relationships are breaking down no fear man my my basket my heart time no fear I don't know how to get through this class in school no fear no fear no no no that's not that's not how God wants you to approach in this a man I mean you know you know when we look at this this whole situation the the the where they add in this ship and you know they're they're looking at it and like man everything that my first plan to spell my second plan is fail and I'm just holding on to these brothers we all going down and Jesus the one put us in the ship now they just finished testifying about him and he come in the fourth watch he waited he waited a while before he actually showed up so when he comes you know walking on the water now that really took the fear to another level because you never seen none like this somebody walking on the water towards you I mean that just that just wait a minute now you know before we go into that I had to just kind of go in and look at of something here I asked myself a question is fear a natural response it's fear natural and you know because you if it was me in this situation I probably would be operating in fear as well I'm gonna just be honest you know there's one thing half a things out yeah yeah I realized that but sometimes things hit you and fear settles him let's be honest fear will fear will strike you in and sometimes you wonder is that natural so I began to look this up and and I find out that we were born with only two innate fears that's the fear of falling in the fear of loud sounds right Amen this is what this what the scientists say that we were born with two fears and then the fear of falling and the fear of loud sounds now you know they went on and said that most fear is actually learned to inexperience appear falling and the fear of a loud sounds it and I'm gonna be honest I don't know if I agree with all that right because I know for a baby amen when it come to falling that a child when it's starting to walk amen when it's learning how to walk that child might fall but that child is something insider to say get back up and keep pressing on and then that fear does not stop that child from continuing to to try to walk because you know when we look at the definition of fear it's an anxiety that's caused by an expectation of evil I want to say that again fear is an anxiety that it's caused by an expectation of evil so when you begin to expect bad results that's when fear is overcoming you stay with me here fear is learned so you know you know there was kind of given that they said this is spiders and snakes the dark these are things that people fear I know some boy they see a spot oh ho but Adam took I'll grant another way I mean look any bitty spot or two some fear roaches whatever they will take off on you in a roach and you know in Florida A&M but roaches all over the place I don't care how clean your house is they they will find a way to get in your house even you got an exterminator they would still find a way to get around your exterminator to get inside that's just that's that's and someone's trying to have a more pleasant term palmetto bugs no roaches roaches roaches and some people afraid of roaches right amen but but that's a learn to fear you know some people afraid of the dark that that's a learned fear amen but you know that they call it a natural fear but these things that these are learned they're developed at a young age and they are influenced by our environment and our culture so these fears are influenced by our environment and our culture you know sometimes the reason you operating in fears because you're talking to people that talk fear that's the reason you respond the way you respond because you were hanging around people that talk nonsense that's that's what they feed on listen see how he said they said this that a young child isn't automatically scared of spiders but Bill's worms cues from his parents that young child see that little thing move around and float that young child is intrigued by them he might go in and try to touch the spider but because we don't just that sooner we do that we just put a fear complex on don't touch don't touch nothing like that that movie I mean but but I'd rather - boy or girl they don't have them type them don't touch anything that's moving as a young child you see young and we call it we call young girls tomboys because they do know that's just a common that's that's what's common they don't have any fear they don't know anything about that you teach them fear I thought about this you think about a child that would touch that socket with it with a metal piece that child is approaching that socket with no fear and he won't know how many of them are not electrocuted because they went there with no fear I guarantee the ones that probably got hurt is the ones that had some type of response some parent I don't do that you know and when and when you when you the way that you do it the way that you say it the way that you communicate that to him there is something that came up in them that ditch it just you know it caused that type of response but but had you not said it that way oh my god I'm preaching from from a Christians perspective Justin K I know this go on the internet and everything but from a crystal perspective that even if I have no fear my child does that I'm not that I'm going to encourage them to do it but if they did it if something happened to him I got faith to believe that I can pray for my child and God raised him up but you know a lot of time the children and never hurt because the parents are operating in fear Oh rather than going faith mode we go to panic mode we start panicking oh I can't believe oh no fear no fear you know you don't realize who you are as a child of God no fear all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen the environment that we had creates the fear is that the anxiety that's caused by an expectation of evil fear means that we expect evil to happen and some people you know you'll be surprised at how folk you know they talk about it so much that they created out of their own mouth they create the negative circumstance they create it out of their mouth we got to watch what we say see see they said they said hearsay a young child is an automatically scared of spiders but Bill's own cues from his parents you get evidence from your parents and your environment that you need to be scared of these things right so you get it from the people that surround you that's how fear is developed so you know here's what I to understand that fear amen from from from a biblical standpoint fear is not a natural response put up 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 let's just I'll show you from a biblical perspective because the Bible says this but God hath not given us the spirit of fear so so what we get here is that fear is not a natural sponsz fear is a spirit whew and God did not give you that spirit only the devil will bring you the spirit of fear no matter what you going through is the devil that will try to bring fear God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love of a sound mind I like that I like that I like that let's let's read another one tournament let's read Isaiah 54 Isaiah 54 so so when you know you already know when fear come they'd say no natural response it's a spirit house they're 54 and let's start here at verse 13 and we're gonna go to verse 17 I just want to equip you cuz when you know we all face it we are into situations and circumstances but you know but we got to realize that our faith is greater than this look at this so the Bible says this and all of our children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be what the peace God wants you to walk in peace amen great should be the piece of that children go on it says in righteousness now be established thou shalt be far from hello somebody if you if you're living in a state of oppression that is the devil that's not from God see since interaction shall not be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear he said no should I peer in from terror because fear kind of bring them type of feelings you suck I mean your mind is just terrorized with thoughts but that's not God's intention for you say thou shalt not fear and from care for shall not come near thee let's go on the whole vation still they gather together that means it's gonna come against you but look at what he say but not by me I didn't send it I didn't bring that to you that is not from me it may gather together but not by me well it's not by him who's doing this it's Satan but not by me whosoever shall gather against me shall fall for thy sake let's keep on going heigh-ho i have created to spit that blow up the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument buzz work and I have created the waster to destroy but hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on notice that so you know we realized that when we have these trials and tribulations that's just to refine us God's not bringing that to crush you that's actually make you stronger but understand you know I mean no matter what it is that you have in front of you know no fear no fear I refuse to talk doubt I refuse to talk defeat I refuse to be in that state coz God don't want me acting like that any time it come it didn't come from God let's go on I love this says no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and in every tongue that survives against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their right just Ness is of me sayeth the Lord you know because even the devil tell you you know the reason this happened because you did that because you and so you're not righteous it's not my it's not my righteousness anyway it is his righteousness so I don't have to live in fear I don't have to live in a state of wonder what's gonna happen you know there's some statements here you know that the Prophet made about fear and I'm gonna just read them to you here as we go on who say he said if you lack confidence it'll make you fear can I say that again if you lack confidence it will create fear you got to have confidence in what God sent to you if you have any lack of confidence it's gonna create fear my God my God let you say fear is of the devil is that fear makes you weary fear makes you wander that's what fear does say the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear that's why I told you didn't come from God I come from the devil you come from the devil so the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear he says he says there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will couldn't happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright tell you what if we ever want to have some overcoming power one see some things change we're gonna have to get rid of the spirit of fear and notice it it stops saying that this is natural it's not it's a spirit fears of spirit you know these disciples you know let me I'll come back to them in a second as you know we read this on on Friday night and brother Branham made the comment says I'm made out of stuff that don't Bluff because all the devil doing is trying to bluff you and boy he gonna create a circumstances situation and his job is to bluff you and if he can Bluff you and get you to make a bad decision then he got you but when you can stand on the Word of God and say no I've done it this way I god I did exactly what you told me to do and I don't know how this thing gonna happen but I know you're gonna bring it to pass you can drive that devil right back to where he come from notice this there were many overcoming who demonstrated no fear many over comers in Scripture that demonstrated no fear and even some that I want to talk about that we're not in Scripture but these people were overcome as they demonstrated no fear they were made out of stuff that does not belong one was Moses mama when Moses mother decided to put him in the Nile River that required no fear when she made that little basket and she told her husband said look I've noticed alligators out there I know it snakes out there but I don't know what I will not allow these Egyptians to get my baby I'd rather give my baby to God and put him out there now and let God take care of and when she dropped that baby off and pushed it in the Nile that required no fear and because she had no fear the baby ends up making it all the way down the now right into the house of Pharaoh out of all the Hallows is on the Nile God directs the baby right into the house of Pharaoh and God used Pharaoh to raise his deliverer he learned all the military strategies I mean he knew it all he was the one of the wisest men in the kingdom but God allows that to happen let Pharaoh's daughter raised this man up in Pharaoh's house and a good thing about it Oh Lord God is just a good guy yo when y'all just learn to just trust God when we just learn to trust God he will do some things that'll blow our mind because she had no fear she released that child into the Nile Pharaoh's daughter gives it and I mean he'd say well I'm a raised raises this on my own because you know that Mama had a you know a love for that child even though it was not her she still had that love for that time and here here I'll hear them say you know you said she said I'm arrested but you know what I know this child requires dummy some milk don't need all this and and since my body didn't go through the process of giving birth to this child I cannot raise this child properly you say I need to find myself a nurse right and I and here you know why not look not only to Moses mom and daddy have no fear the sister had no fear because she's walking along the banks of the river watching what's happening to that baby and when she saw a man the baby make it down to Pharaoh's house she stood up real quick say you need a wet nurse I got one for you you know wet nurse you mean ain't gotta go you know it yes I know wet nurse I've got one for you oh my god so go get me a wet nurse okay went running home to mama no fear running home to mama mama guess what happened you know and he made it to that he made it to the house oh yeah just so excited to tell them to testimony say Muhammad Ali they had a job opening they need a wet nurse mama and they told me to go found one and I can think of no better person they use because the mama had no fear God since God sends her right there into the house of Pharaoh to raise up the deliverer right in the house of Pharaoh because she showed no fear no Hebrew boys made when the fire furnace they had no fear none none that's why they could speak with such a confidence and so they look kicking that we realized that our God is able to deliver us that we ain't got no doubt about that we know what God can do we never see them bring nobody out no fire before I never read that that one in the Bible before that one in the Bible they didn't ever seem that like that I what I'm trying to say that you even if the doctor told you you got something that's very rare nobody has ever had this before that gonna mean nothing that got this has just been a part of your family it's show history no it's not I'm not accepting that and then don't tell me what my family got tell me what the Bible saying right I mean we gotta stop creating these type of environments I mean the me bro boys could not look in the Bible see what God did anything like that for anybody but that your confidence was that you know what we got confidence in our God we never seen that like this but we still got confidence in I God say and here's how here's what our confidence is we're not going back no matter how loud you play this music we not down glory to God so not only that you know if I got don't deliver us we wanted to be written in your books that we did not bow that's the testimony we want to go down about us we did not bow write that and we'll sign our names to it King was upset some man he got the strongest men in his kingdom and he said now take them and throw them into the fiery furnace now you would think that fear would have probably gripped them because the strongmen that bound them and kin take them to the fire furnace the strongmen actually died because they they heated the fire up seven times hotter never been the strongest men and his team Nebuchadnezzar stealing they died maybe if the Hebrew boy somewhere oh boy maybe I should change my testimony because I just saw these guys soon as they touch the fire they died but not the Hebrew boys from no fear can you imagine that three brothers no fear maybe one of their uh fellas maybe we ought to go back on this no no no all three of them had a confidence that if God don't delivers we're going down this way goddamn air and fire not only didn't burn them they didn't every Joseph I mean just glory to God hallelujah I mean shouting and praising God and and then the King like they should be dead by now he goes up and he looks over the furnace and he it went back to the if I said now I'm no I ain't crazy I just threw three men in the fire but why is it that I see four men in there and say and one of them looked like the Son of God oh Jesus see you don't know how I got to get involved in your situation if you'll just operate with no fear say he said I believe he not they not they not they not they not dead but I mean they clothes is still the same everything I mean something wrong so get him up out the fire and they brought him up like this I told you how God is able to deliver I mean they heated up seven times hotter and it still did not touch them the devil might be trying to heat your trial up seven times hotter but as you approach approach it with no fear if God did it before he can do it again I think about David and Goliath see everybody else in the army of Israel they were afraid they were as soon as Goliath would show up everybody to take off running even saw running but one day this little shepherd boy shows up out of nowhere to bring his brother some food and and when he show up any secret I'll come saying who is that uncircumcised a person that don't have fear talks different talk different they don't talk like everybody else they don't respond to situations like everybody's they not turning around and running I'm not tall by just having courage I'm talk about no fear and see what what caused them to be that way like now this man just came talking defy the armies of the Living God say who gonna go fight this fella you look around there buddy back enough why is everybody afraid of this man no do you realize the promise that we got on outside I mean as a church we will realize greater is He that is in us then he that's in the world will stop talking the way we've been talking will stop acting the way we've been acting when we get a revelation who we are so you know you say nobody goes so he went to throw the King said look you know what I know everybody that's what their fear for their freight but but I'll go and I've King looked I'm saying are you just a little boy a little lad say this man been fighting since his youth and you know you ain't you ain't got no chance with him so he look at this they said King and this is what this is what this is what got him heaters he didn't just come out and say this at first he just said I'll fight him but then when the king went letting me say look you know there was a lion that come in to my dad a sheep and I went and got my that sheep from the lion I got and lions were no small animals these were eight-foot nine-foot animals right I willing got my dad a sheep unless you little boy Weiland got a sheep from a lion said I don't let a bear come in one time and I went and got the Sheep from the dad too now the reason he could approach the line do you realize who the lion is the king of the jungle when a lion speaks everything else shuts up I can imagine that lion roaring and they said no no no you got my daddy sheep and you want to know why David felt that way because David was taught that that it was a shame for a shepherd to lose one sheep he said we're going back home with that testimony I'm going back home saying I lost a sheep so I have to come after this lion no fear when you approached a lion no fear when he approached the bear so when it came to facing Goliath guess what no fear Church you've already faced your line you artificial bear God already brought you through that whatever you're going through right now I am convinced that he will bring you through again absolutely convinced let me read a quote of so here in the message God's Way that's been made for us God's Way that's been made for us says after through the services of this week trying to show people that there is no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear right you know I mean people people make decisions parents make decisions out of fear when it comes to their children amen parents make decisions out of fear they're expecting an evil result so since that you know if it's gonna be an evil result let me do this you don't have to help God out you gotta help God out right I mean God is in control so sometimes we make decisions based on fear fear is driving that decision you can tell when it's fear you watch it say not fear fear got here it's all over that decision and I'm gonna tell you something when you when you're doing things to help God out you might end up with a Ishmael and it was worse to have its name because ishm has been creating problems ever since he was born woo wait on your Isaac not to Ishmael yeah I can preach that one glow right wait man you you get yourself an inch man you watch it man he creates Rob lumps and it's done go back you know Oh Lord Jesus that means you know if someone's got some Ishmael situations we got to be honest we got in smell like situations because things that we did out of fear we made decisions out of fear and we ended up with a niche message which now we're in spell is here guess what we all got to deal with them I hope you can read between the lines when in spell is born everybody got a deal with Ishmael all right glory to God and he was still a seed of Abraham just not a part of the promised seed but he was a seat all right let me go on after through the services as weak trying to show people that there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear even I mean if you even had a cancer and didn't feel and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad a shape God take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon the person now this week I've tried to prove out of Scripture that the man that's born again of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you're absolutely safely secure in Jesus Christ all the father's given me he said will come to me no man could come less the father calls I mean just that scripture right I mean that that quote right there he's quoting that scripture that eyelid out or give you faith for your children wayward children nothing to fear no no no matter what you hear no fear no fear I you release them into that Nile River and watch a God bring them right back to you but don't make a fearful decision right don't make a decision out of fear you're doing you're doing it out of fear glory to God I know what I'm talking about but when you do things you compromise and you do things out of fear the devil gonna hold that against you and you're gonna use that against you you just stand in faith to wait for God to do it you can always tell when God did it amen glory to God you always know when God did it and you always know when man is doing it amen amen I'm going on you're absolutely safe safely secure in Jesus Christ all the father's giving me he said will come to me no man could come lest the father cause the father's got to leave him up to me and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out and all no man can pluck them out of my father said no man is greater than he is he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but it's past from life from death unto life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood hath will not will have but half present-tense everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day wherefore grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption there you are still the way until the day of redemption not just from one revival to another but until the day of your Redemption brother Branham again clearly told us that the worst thing that the devil can put on us is fear do not make decisions out of fear God did not give you the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind you can make sound decisions when you're not operating in fear there's one quote brother I wouldn't read the whole thing but he said it's a lady was in a prayer line and he was looking at these people and he was praying for different ones calling out different situations one since that female trouble you know and he was calling out their names everything then he said hey it's the ladies standing there suffering with a fear a complex of fear sits upon her if that's right reasonably handling I write the fears going you can go home and be well I challenge you to believe the lady was suffering with fear just she had a complex of fear Satan can put that on us and and again that type of stuff will drive us to do things that we've never intended to do just know it didn't come from God it does not come from God all right these these brothers these disciples out here in on the sea they had something you would think that it was a very natural tendency to be afraid because of their condition they were waterlogged their ship was waterlogged and here they are you know in a situation their cells are broken their oars were gone and brother Branham say they're holding one another and they're screaming and as they're as they're in this situation been there for probably quite a few hours here comes Jesus walking right out on the water right towards them now after they finish testifying about him speaking about them fear has got I have some na I mean in a strong grip but here you know they look at it and arm and when Jesus you know when when they cried out if you'd like like like Jesus up you know it pretty much is that really you and say it is I be a good cheer and as I stopped being afraid be of good cheer change attitude in his I hear he says it is I believe says be not afraid to him be not afraid stop operating the fear stop walking in fear it is I now that the disciples like now I've never seen anybody walk on water especially in a storm like this I've never seen anything like this how can this really be Jesus that's when Peter steps steps up and says Lord if it really be thou if it really be thou bid me to come unto thee and when he says he says well you know and I love Jesus he's not giving a paragraph he not giving a quote he not giving nothing but one word come and Peter has to get down on that boat and I can search others see me getting down out the boat and as it get down out the boat and maybe trying to manage this don't really hold me like you know what would you know what what's going on it gets at him maybe one foot cuz you can't jump out with both feet just just one foot just then he's like man this this stuff is holding me you Peter Brown the other foot down he start walking and when he walks now he starts sinking the only thing that changed from here to here is that he took his eyes off Jesus he got his eyes more on the condition than on his Savior take your eyes off your condition and keep it on your promise and whatever you're facing no fear because God had sent fear to you that the scientists would want you to believe that's natural no that's a spirit that's what the Bible tells us and God did not stick God didn't give us a spirit of fear I'm so glad that Peter you know when I look at him and see that he was able to walk in that water a man born the same way the rest of us are born it tells us that if we didn't operate in fear what God could do in and through us if we just got rid of fear listen at some of this region a few things oh the gospel God projected his love the Prophet says this that love that God love is a powerful force it says and when love is projected and it comes to the end of its strength Sovereign Grace we'll take it up from there and project the object that love has asked for listen and when love is projected and it comes to the end of its strength love come to the end of its strength Sovereign Grace we'll take it up from there and project the object that love is asked for I want to read that again when love is projected not fear y'all but when love is projected and it compliment and of its strength sovereign grace we'll take it up from there and project the object that love is actual so sometimes your love would be challenged especially in family situations you'll love it be challenged but when you've done everything that you you know you were supposed to do according to the Word of God you'll love it when it when it reaches the end let sovereign grace come in it'll take it out from there and project the object that lovers asked for if your love is asking for God to give it to you you're fearing gonna get nothing from God but you love to get everything from God listen he says that's the reason we have a Savior tonight is because God so loved the world that his love being projected to the world produces Savior God wanted to see see you well so much his love went out and produced an atonement for your sickness as your as your sins it was the love of God that constrained him to do it love is a powerful force Lota's notice this it'll run a woman a mother right into the flames of fire after her baby now you just just think about that statement because if a mother had a baby now most women would run from the fire but if her baby was inside the fire she has she overcomes to fear the fire runs right through the fire to get that baby that's what that's the CCC you know love overcomes fear and we don't read that the Bible says there's well the Bible says there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear a man because because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love that's first John 4:18 look at this he goes on love is a powerful powerful force it'll run a woman a mother right into the flames of fire after a baby if she knows she's plunging herself to death there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust you might go and and know that you belong to the greatest church in all the provinces of Canada you might know that you're to try to remember the greatest greatest church in the nation and then you would do things that you would not do if you belong to a little mission somewhere in some corner and have the love of God in your heart love has no fear love casts out fear and I notice am i meeting so much that when when when I come into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear and what fear is a lack of confidence that's why that's just bottom line we don't have confidence that God or do what he said he'll do we don't have that type of confidence we always feel like we gotta help him out let me tell you some God don't need your help you've been doing this for a long time a lot longer than any of us ever been here and will ever be here God know exactly how to handle it's not less not trying to help him out let's just let God be God amen Church listen if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it cast away that fear and that's the way God wants his church not so many not something that's as charter members he wants members that's loyal and loves and believes and has confidence in him all right let me read this out of the way to have fellowship this is gonna be a rather long quote but I want to just kind of set this up brother Browns gonna show us how and a time in his life where it would have been so normal for him to have fear it would have been so normal for him to have fear but rather than half fear he said he said something came over him right he say something happened and say and that's what we're all looking for is for that something happening you know David Livingstone he was a man that kind of went all over South I mean all over Africa just kind of taking the gospel he was a missionary said one time he'd come in contact with a lion and when he come in contact with this lion you know his he knew that that lion would pretty much destroy him so what people do when they get when they when they when they in fight-or-flight mode because when fear fear comes upon you either enter into two rims either fight or flight either gonna stand up you're gonna fight or you're gonna you're gonna kind of go into flight mode and what this man did you run from it but what this man did he decided to play dead right Here Come his lion and and he say you know he act like he was dead and and that lion come over there and picked him up with one paw and pretty much just starts swinging him around but why he was thinking the man man just kind of lost consciousness within himself when he played there and in the lion like you know this thing ain't moving it ain't no fun if it ain't gonna move it ain't no fun at all everything I move so the lion just dropped him and went running after the men that were moving and his life was fair because he played that he played that part not gonna tell you to go out there and with a lion and try to act like you did no stand up if you can fell in front of the line like that be like David glory to God take your stone and throw them and take them out amen or use the spoken word that you got power amen and put that line in this place that's what you're supposed to do hey man that's what God that's what that when Jesus went to the cross that's what the cross produced dominion over these things can I go a little further you know just this story comes to mind this pastor was telling me I was over in Zimbabwe and the pass was telling me how they go lion hunting and you know one time he went lion hunting and and as they're out there he says they were you know their state they shot a lion and and when they shot the lion they they took off running because you know they thought the lion would you know kind of come out them being wounded and upset so if they took off running they ran so far then and then they went but they did they start tracking the blood so they turn around say okay we're gonna go get that lion now let's go get him we've taken him home this one our trophies and they went they start tracking the lion you know and and when they got you know where the blood was going they got around a little corner here and when they got to the corner say that lion should be right around this corner cuz man this blood get thicker and thicker he should be around here when they got around that corner that lying one there but another one was and the other one was there he looked at the other brothers and and and all of them just took off running and he said to himself state now ahold of them was smaller than me so I had a great feeling that I'd be the one that the lion would get and said as he was running he could just feel it he could just already feel it that that line was urine take that Paul and just take him right down to the ground he felt it coming he thought it was gonna happen fear was making that happen to him but before you know he said he looked around say that line didn't come and when they realized what had happened say the line was just afraid of him just as afraid of him as they were afraid of the line so when it took off running the lion took off running but fear would cause you to do some tremendous things fear fear fear fear fear fear Oh God we need to overcome that look at this brother branham is talking about something yeah he had a situation where he faced a killer bull and we're gonna read about that and I bring this to a close here today a man this killer bull but he says this is the way to have fellowship he says that's the trouble with man tonight that's what's the trouble with people tonight you're scared the biggest curse there is on the full gospel people or any other people because they are afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight why you would take your healing by faith and know that God had promised it and the thing would just go plum away from you y'all get if you aren't afraid you take your healing by faith and the thing would go plum away from you says afraid scare and I've noticed it and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen there's only two faculties that govenor human and one of them is faith which brings results in the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of God fear is of the devil deer makes you weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it would it do to me - get off stood up about it what if I was going are gonna be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it so when you say what good would it do to have faith faith consign my pardon sure there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and belief and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first y'all get that the only way you can have faith you gotta have love first for love produces the perfect love get it perfect love casts all cows casts out all fear wish I had time to tell you experiences with wildlife of what I've seen conquered by faith by love I told you the other night about the old opossum being sent up I've seen a vicious bull one day was going to kill me this is on record I was a game warden at the time I was going over the hill to pray for a sick man and we're supposed to pack a gun but you wouldn't go go to pray for a sick man with a gun on your hand right so I took the gun and laid it in a little ol truck now he wasn't thinking just took the gun and just later on the truck says it crossed over over through the field and I was way out in the field and I knew I had a thought that this killer bull was out there he just killed a colored man on a farm mr. Burke's just about three months before that and they sold him up up there to to the people that had these Durham cattle and then when I started across the field right out in a big open field the way to have fellowship I'm a paragraph e28 it says and then when I cross when I start across the field right out and a big open field and not over about 30 yards from me this big fella raised up threw his horns down let out a big big bellow and if you know what I'm talking about and there he was horns about like this and here he come at first it scared me see it was fear I look for a tree and there wasn't any tree and I know he could outrun me to the fence so I thought well this is it says so then something happened see the spirit of fear will come first and if you accept the spirit of fear you probably do good as dead that's it that's you know where I ain't gonna get a chance to call this one tell them by angle you know just you can't operate like that but let they say say but then something something happened oh god if that would only stay there instead of going away I need that too whatever that's something that happened to the Prophet I need that happening to me all the time if it only stay there and never go away so if something happened I wish God would let it happen everybody here tonight just long enough to get he'll see something happened and I wasn't scared of the bull I felt sorry because I disturbed him I was in his field he was laying out there by not bothering me I come along and woke him up and so I felt sorry for him now you can't Bluff it so you got to be made out of stuff that does not Bluff now you can't Bluff it it has to be there that's the way faith is you can't Bluff you've got to really have it the devil will know it and this fellow started towards me with his head down just as hard as he could I wasn't no more afraid of that bull then then I would be if any of my dear brothers and sisters standing on this platform and he run within about 5 feet of me and he stopped he looked at me so depleted he looked right and left I said fella I'm sorry I disturbed you I said I know you're God's creature and I'm God's servant now the Creator that made you made me and I am his servant I'm on my journey across the hill to pray for one of his sick children if I know you've been laying there I wouldn't have come by and disturbed you so now the name of Jesus Christ the Creator go back and lay down who says that a judgment bar you'll see it brought into life that bull looked at me a few minutes turned around walked over and laid down and I stood there the tears running down my cheeks I walked within 5 foot of that bull and he never even turned his head and looked at me why instead of hating him I loved him love will conquer anything right that's what that's what conquered my heart when I know that God so loved me that He gave His only begotten Son that I wouldn't have to perish note that I was born in this world of sinner and was perishing and God loved me that it gave His Son offer my life to be redeemed and then I couldn't hate no more I had to love that's what brings these results that you see it's love I'll tell you the prophets say something just came over him something happened he don't know what what it was he said he said I just wish I could have that happen to me all the time say I wish that can just happen to everybody right no fear right that's that's best that's kind of what happened you know they even tell you that even when it comes to you know most feared dogs we've been running from run you see the first dog you just take off front you know what that dog would just keep chasing you not only will it keep chasing you every time you come it can stick it's picked up your scent and it know you coming and soon as they so they know you can just go to automatically barking automatically and someone's run from a little itty bitty dogs hey can't bite nothing just because there's a dog we got running no fear brother Brandon one time I mean they had a believe it was a coyote yeah I think was a coyote going through the neighborhood just messing up stuff brother branham got ahold of the coyote and made the coyote his pet made it made the coyote his hat the Cuyuna just said that like a dog at the house no you're no problem he had no fear of the animal and they realized they'd say you know what every animal will respect the hand that feeds it the offer that they little food he's nowhere to come back even even alligators get tamed by humans it's just when they stop feeding them when you stop feeding them now you're gonna have some problem why you know you can't let me just put it this way you came just try to be friends with animals we're not in the inner millennium yet now the air is coming today we're the lion I lay down with the lamb but we're not there yet well you know folk in the circus and everything and or one of these these TV shows used to have and guys out there with all these animals come back you know they got them tamed and you know wild animals no you don't do that you get too close you're gonna get struck a man had one video of the lady out there she act like she had no fear taking pictures with with Lions got out the car they were riding through you know some some thing she get out the car and the Lions are right there and she wasn't I want to take a picture of the Lions lady's not no zoo these animals not have not been tranquilized and she didn't make it back to the car and one other lady got upset with her husband they out there in one of these places you know it Lions and everything all over and they in the car and have an argument and she just she just get mad I'm just so upset with you and she she opens the car door you know you got to know when to do that and when not to do that she opens the car door you know her baby in the car mom in the car the husband in the car she got upset with her husband I'm gonna show you that I'm getting out get out and close the door well the mom and a baby and her husband saw something they didn't want to see you know you you know and that's not no fear that was foolishness you need to get control of your anger but if you happen to be walking into a situation you didn't know what she was walking into that's where there's no fear now I guarantee brother branham didn't see it on the scope but I guarantee he did not go home the same way he came he said on the quote but I can almost assure you if you know the animal there imma go ahead and prove something no that's foolishness and you're gonna get destroyed right but faith is you know what I wasn't expecting that but ain't no system me having no fear because they don't come from God that's it that's the devil brought that I'm arrives up as a child of God and I'm gonna take my position and I'm gonna watch God do what God does cuz I ain't got no power to do death but God do have power Church can I just tell you know no fear no fear no no fear and this is just a quick quote here brother am said and I'm not reading the whole thing and God testifying of his gifts hold on it says God says don't fear fears of the devil everything Jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not is that right always fear not now God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe so every one of you believe with one Accord one Accord every one of you amen let's have word of Prayer father we were challenged by your word there are different situations that we all face there different things that we go through and God we we need to know that it fear comes from the devil decisions that are being made they've been made out of fear and that's that's not your wheel Lord for us to do it that way we're wondering we don't have confidence in your word we don't have confidence in your promise so we do things to try to help you out god help us to take our hands off of it to release it into the Nile River and allow you God just to have complete authority and control over the situation let us not make bad decisions Lord we do it out of fear we don't want to be alone so we make a bad decision we don't want this so we make a bad decision god don't don't let us proce things that way let us do it father because your word is showing us how to approach God there's so many people that have some really rough situations because of what they've done we create the Ishmael's in our own life just as Sarah and Abraham they've tried to help you out you told that they were gonna have a promise son you just didn't tell them win and God since they couldn't wait patiently for you they did what they could to help you to assist you in the process and God look at what it led to problems still today because of that decision Eve God she did things made bad decisions and Lord Adam made bad decisions and God we don't we can learn from these these these circumstances these situations we can learn from that help us look God just just completely and totally trust you turn our faith towards you Jesus and God whatever it is that we're facing whenever it is help us Lord to realize the fear is not something natural but fear is a spirit that comes from the enemy and anytime it's coming in our direction any thought of it any any any part of it god help us to to realize we got the power to bind and loose and if we would exercise and
