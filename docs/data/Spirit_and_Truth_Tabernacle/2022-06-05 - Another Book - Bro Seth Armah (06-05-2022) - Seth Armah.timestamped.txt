[1:00:24] you you can't have vacation now
[1:00:29] when he said it i i was
[1:00:31] like oh
[1:00:32] maybe
[1:00:33] he's joking
[1:00:36] but when we came to service the first
[1:00:39] service that we had here
[1:00:41] i went outside there and then i met
[1:00:43] brother troy
[1:00:45] and brother trump said
[1:00:47] oh you are a pastor
[1:00:49] we don't make pastors to sit we make

[1:01:56] and i told my ambassador that
[1:02:00] this time around i'll have enough time
[1:02:02] to have vacation with my wife
[1:02:10] so it's been great to be here and to see
[1:02:14] very nice people
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:16] the message from the prophet has been
[1:02:18] wonderful and
[1:02:20] you go to certain places even though you
[1:02:23] believe
[1:02:24] the same prophet
[1:02:26] you have i mean
[1:02:29] a lot of challenges and
[1:02:31] but
[1:02:32] i tell you i came here and my spirit is
[1:02:35] just connecting and i'm feeling so free
[1:02:38] and i say god richly bless you every one
[1:02:40] of you god bless you

[1:02:58] richly bless you continue
[1:03:01] in that fellowship and with that sweet
[1:03:03] love

[1:03:11] when you are eating a pie
[1:03:13] and there's something they not in it and
[1:03:15] it's not okay just throw that away and
[1:03:17] then continue eating your part
[1:03:20] i may not be the same as um pastor jack
[1:03:24] but i tell you there's something that
[1:03:26] connects you and me
[1:03:27] and that is what we have to look for
[1:03:30] hallelujah god richly bless you god

[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:10] i like to ask to tend to our bibles
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:21] and i want us to turn to the book of
[1:04:23] revelation
[1:04:26] chapter 20.
[1:04:29] i'm also going to read the book of
[1:04:31] danielle
[1:04:34] chapter 7
[1:04:36] verse 9 to 10.
[1:04:38] let's first read the book of revelation
[1:04:42] chapter
[1:04:43] 20
[1:04:45] verse 11
[1:04:47] and 12
[1:04:49] 11 and 12
[1:04:52] and shall we hear the word of god
[1:04:55] and i saw
[1:04:57] a great white throne
[1:04:59] and him that sat on it
[1:05:02] from whose face the earth
[1:05:04] and the heaven fled away
[1:05:07] and there was found no place for them
[1:05:11] and i saw
[1:05:13] the dead
[1:05:14] small and great stand before god
[1:05:17] and the books were open
[1:05:20] and another book was open
[1:05:23] which is the book of life
[1:05:26] and the dead were judged out of those
[1:05:28] things which were written
[1:05:31] in the books
[1:05:32] according to their words
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] let us also turn to the book of daniel
[1:05:41] chapter 7 verse 9
[1:05:45] and 10.
[1:05:49] and he says
[1:05:51] i beheld till the thrones were cast down
[1:05:55] and the ancient of days did sit
[1:05:59] whose garment was white as snow
[1:06:03] and the hair
[1:06:05] of his head like the pure wool
[1:06:08] his throne was like the fiery flame
[1:06:11] and his wheels as men in fire
[1:06:15] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[1:06:18] from before him
[1:06:20] thousand
[1:06:22] thousands ministered unto him
[1:06:25] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:06:28] stood before him
[1:06:31] the judgment was set
[1:06:33] and the books
[1:06:35] were open
[1:06:36] shall we by his precious lord and our
[1:06:38] father we thank you again for

[1:08:00] like what paul said that when i came
[1:08:02] among you i did not come with enticing
[1:08:05] words of man's wisdom but lord with the
[1:08:07] demonstration and the power of the holy
[1:08:09] spirit i pray that lord you will
[1:08:11] minister unto your people in the name of
[1:08:14] our lord jesus christ the lord when
[1:08:16] everything is done glory and honor and
[1:08:19] adoration will be to your name thank you
[1:08:22] for this we ask in jesus mighty name
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] amen shall we be seated
[1:08:37] and for
[1:08:39] just a few minutes
[1:08:42] i would like to
[1:08:44] speak on
[1:08:46] a subject of entitled
[1:08:48] another
[1:08:49] book
[1:08:51] another book
[1:08:55] and i took this subject
[1:08:58] from the book of revelation where we
[1:09:00] read
[1:09:01] that he said the books were open
[1:09:04] and another book was
[1:09:06] open
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:09] praise the name of the lord another book
[1:09:12] was
[1:09:13] open
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:16] the book of revelation
[1:09:20] it's a book of symbols
[1:09:22] i just want you to get that at the back
[1:09:24] of your mind
[1:09:25] that the book of revelation
[1:09:28] is a book of
[1:09:30] symbols
[1:09:31] and so is the book of genesis
[1:09:35] genesis is also
[1:09:37] filled with symbols
[1:09:39] shadows and types
[1:09:41] hallelujah so you see the book of
[1:09:44] revelation in the book of genesis they
[1:09:47] go together
[1:09:48] and these two books the devil hates so
[1:09:51] much
[1:09:53] the devil doesn't want to hear
[1:09:55] the book of revelation he doesn't want
[1:09:57] to hear the book of genesis
[1:10:00] why because
[1:10:02] it reveals the beginning of the enemy
[1:10:05] the beginning of devil
[1:10:07] it reveals and tells us about how
[1:10:11] the devil began
[1:10:13] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:10:16] and the book of revelation tells us
[1:10:18] about how he's going to end
[1:10:20] hallelujah so these two books are books
[1:10:24] that the devil fears so much
[1:10:28] amen and amen
[1:10:30] it is full of symbols so but abram
[1:10:33] preach a message
[1:10:34] and entitle it
[1:10:36] revelation
[1:10:38] book of symbols
[1:10:40] hallelujah
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] it's a book of symbols because
[1:10:45] it is a prophecy
[1:10:48] hallelujah it is a prophecy and in the
[1:10:52] message that the prophet preached
[1:10:55] revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:57] the prophet said
[1:10:59] it is an uncovering
[1:11:03] it is
[1:11:04] uncovering what was previously
[1:11:08] hidden
[1:11:09] hallelujah
[1:11:11] he said not
[1:11:12] the uncovering
[1:11:15] now the uncovering is not only the
[1:11:18] revelation of the person of jesus christ
[1:11:22] but
[1:11:23] the revelation of his future works
[1:11:26] in the oncoming church ages
[1:11:29] hallelujah he said look
[1:11:33] the importance of the revelation by the
[1:11:36] spirit to a true believer
[1:11:39] can never be over emphasized hallelujah
[1:11:42] that means revelation means a lot to us
[1:11:46] praise the name of the lord
[1:11:48] it means a lot to us he said revelation
[1:11:50] means more
[1:11:52] to you
[1:11:53] then perhaps you realize
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] now i'm not talking about this book of
[1:12:01] revelation and you
[1:12:03] i'm talking about all
[1:12:05] revelation
[1:12:07] hallelujah
[1:12:08] so the revelation is very important and
[1:12:10] we need to talk about
[1:12:12] this revelation
[1:12:14] praise the name of the lord
[1:12:16] i want you to keep this at the back of
[1:12:18] your mind that revelation is a book of
[1:12:21] symbols praise the name of the lord so
[1:12:24] here we come
[1:12:26] they said the books were open
[1:12:28] right
[1:12:30] it is not a paper book that was open
[1:12:33] we are not looking at paper book
[1:12:35] we are not looking at any
[1:12:37] lithography or any written thing that is
[1:12:40] not what we are looking at
[1:12:42] the books were open
[1:12:45] when we said the books were open is
[1:12:47] talking about alive that was open
[1:12:52] a life that was manifested
[1:12:54] a life that began
[1:12:57] and that life that began
[1:12:59] is what the book of revelation tells it
[1:13:02] as
[1:13:02] the books were
[1:13:04] open
[1:13:06] hallelujah
[1:13:07] praise the name of the lord
[1:13:11] the books opening are lives of people
[1:13:16] it is life a life of somebody
[1:13:19] hallelujah when the life of somebody uh
[1:13:23] begins it says that a book
[1:13:26] has been opened
[1:13:28] hallelujah
[1:13:30] it means that a life has been best right
[1:13:35] it means that someone has been
[1:13:38] manifested
[1:13:39] on the surface of the earth
[1:13:41] hallelujah so we look at the book of
[1:13:44] genesis
[1:13:46] they said the book of genesis
[1:13:50] it is not a paper genesis
[1:13:53] but it is talking about the lives of
[1:13:56] people
[1:13:57] in that dispensation some people lived
[1:14:02] and
[1:14:03] their lives were recorded
[1:14:05] and they put all of those together
[1:14:08] and call it the book of genesis
[1:14:16] the same you read about the book of
[1:14:18] isaiah
[1:14:20] it is not um
[1:14:23] a paper
[1:14:25] but it is the life of isaiah
[1:14:28] that was recorded
[1:14:30] hallelujah and then you have the
[1:14:32] chapters
[1:14:34] chapter one chapter two
[1:14:36] there were people that came through the
[1:14:38] life of isaiah
[1:14:40] isaiah had a lot of him amen
[1:14:43] revelations and god revealed himself to
[1:14:45] him he showed him some vision say as i
[1:14:48] went to certain places all these things
[1:14:51] were recorded and we call it the book of
[1:14:54] isaiah
[1:14:59] same as jeremiah you can talk you can
[1:15:01] call all of them
[1:15:02] the book of daniel the book of jesus the
[1:15:05] book of maya the book of god there are
[1:15:08] lives of people that have been
[1:15:10] manifested on the surface of the earth
[1:15:12] praise the name of the lord so if we put
[1:15:16] all these things together
[1:15:18] the bible call it the old testament
[1:15:22] the book of the old testament
[1:15:24] what they want to say is that
[1:15:26] the life of people who live
[1:15:30] at a certain time
[1:15:32] and their lives that were recorded they
[1:15:35] called it the book
[1:15:37] of the old testament so is the book of
[1:15:41] the new testament we heard about people
[1:15:44] like
[1:15:44] stephen you heard about people like paul
[1:15:47] oh priscilla and aquila we heard about
[1:15:50] all these people
[1:15:51] they were lives of people who live at
[1:15:54] those times hallelujah
[1:15:57] today
[1:15:58] if we are no more
[1:16:00] or maybe if we will pass by this way and
[1:16:03] some people
[1:16:05] come along or behind us
[1:16:07] they will begin to
[1:16:09] read
[1:16:09] something they will begin to read your
[1:16:12] life
[1:16:13] read my life read every one of us our
[1:16:16] life maybe they'll put it together and
[1:16:18] then call it
[1:16:19] the book of jack
[1:16:27] the book of erica
[1:16:31] glory the life that you lead
[1:16:34] is what has been recorded
[1:16:37] and have been placed there and it's
[1:16:39] called a book the book is not a paper
[1:16:41] book like this my brother
[1:16:43] it's not a paper book my sister
[1:16:45] hallelujah
[1:16:46] so paul said in the book of second
[1:16:49] corinthians
[1:16:50] and he said
[1:16:52] that chapter 3
[1:16:54] and paul said
[1:16:56] ye
[1:16:57] are
[1:16:58] our epistles
[1:17:00] written
[1:17:02] in our hearts
[1:17:04] known and read of all men
[1:17:12] for as much as ye are
[1:17:14] manifestly declared
[1:17:17] to be the epistle of christ
[1:17:20] ministered by us
[1:17:22] written not with ink
[1:17:25] but with the spirit of the living god
[1:17:28] in not in tables of stone
[1:17:32] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[1:17:37] hallelujah
[1:17:38] ye are written epistles
[1:17:41] every one of you every one of us is a
[1:17:44] written epistle
[1:17:46] once we are going through this life
[1:17:49] our lives are being recorded
[1:17:52] your life is recorded my life is

[1:22:08] that brother yet they don't want to
[1:22:12] accept that

[1:22:16] so you become the true word of god you
[1:22:19] become the white throne judgment that is
[1:22:22] searching the people
[1:22:24] hallelujah
[1:22:25] amen and amen
[1:22:27] oh and i saw these people they standing
[1:22:30] for the white throne judgment
[1:22:34] to be judged
[1:22:36] praise the name of the lord let me show
[1:22:38] you
[1:22:40] these thrones that
[1:22:42] the book of revelation is
[1:22:44] talking about
[1:22:46] i'll send you to the book confirmed
[1:22:48] daniel
[1:22:49] what daniel
[1:22:51] talked about
[1:22:53] and i saw the thrones
[1:22:56] hallelujah
[1:23:00] praise the name of the lord
[1:23:04] and daniel was talking about the same
[1:23:06] truth
[1:23:08] and said and i'll be hell
[1:23:11] so the truths were cast
[1:23:14] down
[1:23:15] and the ancient of days
[1:23:18] did
[1:23:18] sit whose comment was white as snow
[1:23:22] and the hair as
[1:23:24] of his hair like the pure woo
[1:23:26] and his strong was like fiery flame
[1:23:29] and a fiery stream
[1:23:31] issued
[1:23:32] and came forth from before him and
[1:23:35] thousands
[1:23:37] thousands ministered unto him ten
[1:23:40] thousands and ten thousand stood before
[1:23:42] him
[1:23:43] and the judgment was set
[1:23:45] and the books
[1:23:47] were open
[1:23:49] hallelujah
[1:23:51] what was daniel talking about here
[1:23:54] daniel was referring us to the book of
[1:23:56] revelation daniel saw exactly what was
[1:23:59] happening in the book of revelation how
[1:24:02] lives were open
[1:24:04] but look at how daniel put it
[1:24:07] he said
[1:24:09] drones were cast
[1:24:11] down
[1:24:13] you see
[1:24:16] daniel was not looking at
[1:24:18] the white cast
[1:24:20] as
[1:24:22] throwing something down
[1:24:25] but daniel was looking at the porter
[1:24:29] molding
[1:24:30] his image
[1:24:33] cast
[1:24:34] you know
[1:24:35] when a reporter or a sculptor
[1:24:38] wants to do his um
[1:24:40] emote something
[1:24:42] they
[1:24:43] they do the mood
[1:24:45] and then maybe they cast whatever if it
[1:24:47] is concrete or whatever they cast it
[1:24:50] into it and then the cast would take the
[1:24:53] shape of the mood
[1:24:54] so
[1:24:55] that is what daniel was looking at
[1:24:59] and that was in the presence of god
[1:25:02] that was something that was coming in
[1:25:04] who you and i
[1:25:06] that god molded
[1:25:09] god from you
[1:25:11] god for me
[1:25:13] god from you and i
[1:25:14] and we are the trolls and when god casts
[1:25:18] that troll
[1:25:19] what did he do
[1:25:21] the ancient of days
[1:25:23] the almighty god
[1:25:26] that she came to your family
[1:25:29] oh the great i am that i am
[1:25:32] he came
[1:25:34] and sit in that troll
[1:25:38] when you were cast when you were formed
[1:25:42] then god sat in that troll
[1:25:53] that glory
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:57] which is you and i
[1:25:59] when we were formed
[1:26:04] the almighty god sat in you
[1:26:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:26:12] he said i knew you
[1:26:14] when you were even a cloth of blood in
[1:26:16] your mother's womb
[1:26:18] i knew you
[1:26:19] and i foretell you so before we even
[1:26:22] came here
[1:26:23] oh hallelujah
[1:26:25] god
[1:26:26] is already dead
[1:26:29] god was already in you
[1:26:32] before we came to this surface of the
[1:26:35] earth
[1:26:36] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:26:39] lord
[1:26:41] he murdered you
[1:26:44] cast
[1:26:46] and when it cast
[1:26:48] he god the ancient of days
[1:26:52] sit
[1:26:54] sit where
[1:26:56] in you
[1:26:57] in me
[1:26:58] hallelujah
[1:27:00] and you became the throne
[1:27:03] before the people
[1:27:05] and now judging
[1:27:08] giving your judgment
[1:27:10] you know
[1:27:11] sometimes sometimes sometimes we always
[1:27:13] take judgment as
[1:27:16] condemnation
[1:27:20] preach
[1:27:21] that's what we did we always think that
[1:27:23] judgment is what always
[1:27:25] contamination
[1:27:27] but when you go to the law court
[1:27:31] and then the judge
[1:27:33] will come with this
[1:27:35] verdict
[1:27:36] or his decision
[1:27:38] it is not always that the judge is
[1:27:40] judging he's going to condemn that
[1:27:42] person
[1:27:43] sometimes you are
[1:27:46] acquitted and discharged
[1:27:49] said oh amen we found out oh you are you
[1:27:52] don't have any problem i mean you are
[1:27:54] you are okay you are right and then they
[1:27:56] set you free
[1:27:58] sometimes i see that oh you are rather
[1:28:00] the right person you rather do the
[1:28:02] correct thing and and then you are set
[1:28:04] free
[1:28:05] there are times that a judge will come
[1:28:07] with his judgment and say that oh no
[1:28:10] you are wrong
[1:28:11] and you have to go in there hallelujah
[1:28:15] so judgment is not always condemning
[1:28:18] somebody
[1:28:24] judgment comes and it is coming either
[1:28:27] to to to to free you
[1:28:30] or
[1:28:32] to to to
[1:28:33] to to arrest you or to continue you
[1:28:37] hallelujah
[1:28:38] and here destroys you and i
[1:28:41] we come here as as as the judges
[1:28:45] the church sitting right in us we don't
[1:28:48] always go fighting the people
[1:28:50] we don't always go
[1:28:52] casting the people into hell and say oh
[1:28:54] you because you have done this you are
[1:28:56] going to hell oh because you are doing
[1:28:58] that you are going to hell but we come
[1:29:00] to you
[1:29:01] with the power and the word of god and
[1:29:04] then we bring you out from a place into
[1:29:07] the presence of god
[1:29:09] oh hallelujah the thrones that were cast
[1:29:13] down you were a troll
[1:29:16] that was cast
[1:29:17] down
[1:29:19] praise the name of the lord
[1:29:21] oh
[1:29:22] hallelujah amen and amen
[1:29:26] amen and amen
[1:29:30] until the thrones were cast down
[1:29:33] i want to show you
[1:29:35] how these drones
[1:29:37] how god casted these thrones
[1:29:39] and it takes us back
[1:29:42] to the book of genesis
[1:29:46] in the book of genesis
[1:29:49] genesis 1
[1:29:51] 26 27
[1:30:00] genesis 1
[1:30:02] 26
[1:30:04] 27
[1:30:15] and the bible said
[1:30:21] and god said
[1:30:23] let us make man in our image
[1:30:27] after our likeness
[1:30:30] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:30:32] of the sea and over
[1:30:35] the fowl of the air and over the cattle
[1:30:38] and over the earth
[1:30:40] and over every creeping thing that
[1:30:42] creepeth upon the earth
[1:30:45] so god
[1:30:47] created man
[1:30:49] in his own image
[1:30:52] in the image of god created him
[1:30:55] male and female
[1:30:57] created he them and every one of us
[1:31:00] knows that this man that god created was
[1:31:04] a spirit man
[1:31:09] a spirit man
[1:31:12] he doesn't have
[1:31:14] flesh like we do here
[1:31:16] hallelujah
[1:31:18] and this flesh this spirit man that god
[1:31:20] created
[1:31:23] the bible said
[1:31:25] it has not
[1:31:27] gained any experience in the flesh
[1:31:29] before
[1:31:32] so write in the book of genesis chapter
[1:31:35] 2
[1:31:36] the verse 7
[1:31:40] he said and the lord god form
[1:31:43] man out of the dust
[1:31:46] of the ground
[1:31:48] and breathed into his nostrils
[1:31:51] the breath of life
[1:31:52] and man became a living soul
[1:31:56] hallelujah
[1:31:58] out of the dust of the earth
[1:32:01] that was where god now was making the
[1:32:04] cast
[1:32:05] god
[1:32:06] casted man
[1:32:08] out of the dust of the earth he murdered
[1:32:10] man
[1:32:11] and when he murdered the man
[1:32:13] that man doesn't have any life
[1:32:16] there was nothing in that man
[1:32:19] so that ancient of days had to sit in
[1:32:22] that cast
[1:32:23] in that mode that he has formed on the
[1:32:26] underground
[1:32:27] so the bible said
[1:32:29] god placed this adam in genesis 1
[1:32:33] 27 he placed that spirit man
[1:32:37] into that
[1:32:38] um a flesh
[1:32:41] man the earth
[1:32:42] that has been molded he placed it in him
[1:32:46] and when he placed it in him that man
[1:32:48] became
[1:32:50] a living soul
[1:32:52] the ancient of days have now sat
[1:32:55] and when the ages asians of this sat now
[1:32:58] adam
[1:32:59] could now have dominion adam could not
[1:33:02] take control over the animals the bible
[1:33:04] said
[1:33:05] and it was adam that gave names to
[1:33:09] all those animals and things
[1:33:11] before god
[1:33:14] created those rivers
[1:33:17] their fruits their trees
[1:33:19] everything that god created
[1:33:21] god has not tasted of them before
[1:33:24] hallelujah
[1:33:26] until adam
[1:33:28] was molded and put in flesh
[1:33:31] adam could not taste
[1:33:32] the fruit
[1:33:33] and i don't go out
[1:33:36] of the water hallelujah praise the name
[1:33:38] of the lord that was god sitting in that
[1:33:42] mood and that was where daniel was
[1:33:44] picking up that revelation from that god
[1:33:48] always make a cast and then
[1:33:51] place it himself right in the cast
[1:33:54] hallelujah
[1:33:56] praise the name of the lord oh daniel
[1:34:00] when daniel was doing this
[1:34:02] or when daniel saw that revelation
[1:34:05] oh hallelujah
[1:34:08] he saw it as
[1:34:10] a ceremony
[1:34:11] that god was
[1:34:13] organizing right there in that dimension
[1:34:17] was a ceremony
[1:34:19] so
[1:34:20] god
[1:34:22] cast moved
[1:34:23] placed himself more to place himself
[1:34:26] both placed himself
[1:34:27] and
[1:34:28] he was doing that more than more than
[1:34:30] more than more placing himself and all
[1:34:32] these things were standing right in the
[1:34:35] presence of god and the bible said
[1:34:38] thousands
[1:34:39] and thousands
[1:34:41] ten thousands times ten thousands they
[1:34:44] stood before him

[2:04:34] a message of this salvation that was
[2:04:36] moving and he was just looking up to
[2:04:38] these people to accept that message
[2:04:42] but they turned their back to the
[2:04:43] message

[2:04:46] he said
[2:04:47] the clock is still tickling
[2:04:49] the gospel has to return back to the
[2:04:52] east where it came from
[2:04:53] and where is it returning to before it
[2:04:56] returns to the east it has to pass
[2:04:58] through the south
[2:05:06] so he's going that way

[2:22:02] what happened to him he said the story

[2:22:12] friends also came with a um a
[2:22:14] truck pickup and then they were going to
[2:22:17] the beach and then he jumped into the
[2:22:19] pickup they went to the beach and he got
[2:22:21] drowned
[2:22:25] he got drowned right there
[2:22:29] here was life that was being given to
[2:22:32] him
[2:22:34] life was given to him
[2:22:37] instead of a certain life
[2:22:40] he rejected the life
[2:22:43] instead of a setting that another book
[2:22:45] of him would be open
[2:22:46] he didn't want that book to be open
[2:22:52] just drowned
[2:22:54] that was the end of the brother
[2:22:58] moses said
[2:22:59] here lies between you
[2:23:01] life and death
[2:23:04] life and death jews
[2:23:07] and this brother chose death
[2:23:09] instead of choosing life
[2:23:12] i don't know what was what was on me
[2:23:14] that the lord wanted me to hold this and
[2:23:17] grip this guy and send him to the church
[2:23:22] just lost
[2:23:24] praise the name of the lord
[2:23:26] my brother my sister
[2:23:28] when god
[2:23:30] changes their life and then give you a
[2:23:33] new book a new life it is
[2:23:36] not for you alone but we got to
[2:23:39] let somebody also receive their lives
[2:23:49] the lord is working mightily and
[2:23:50] tremendously among us
[2:23:52] and i see
[2:23:54] everything that the prophet said brother
[2:23:56] brown said
[2:23:57] be manifested in our midst
[2:24:03] oh before i just close
[2:24:05] let me share this testimony with you
[2:24:07] hallelujah
[2:24:10] my
[2:24:13] sister and pastor
[2:24:15] the wife
[2:24:18] is a nurse
[2:24:23] they had they have two kids
[2:24:28] then the brother
[2:24:30] was in the office when he had a call
[2:24:35] the call
[2:24:36] was coming from
[2:24:37] one of our church members who
[2:24:40] is also a medical doctor
[2:24:42] and then he called him he said i'm in
[2:24:43] your house
[2:24:45] right now
[2:24:46] if you can come
[2:24:48] over to the house
[2:24:50] and he said okay anything he said when
[2:24:53] he had a call
[2:24:54] he knew that there's something
[2:24:58] something wrong
[2:25:00] so he took his car rushed to the house
[2:25:03] and then here was the doctor with a
[2:25:05] report in his hand
[2:25:07] and then the report
[2:25:09] he read a report he said your wife has
[2:25:11] been diagnosed
[2:25:13] with cancer
[2:25:15] of the pancreas
[2:25:20] he said
[2:25:22] he's a medical doctor so he said this is
[2:25:24] one of the deadliest
[2:25:26] cancer that can kill within
[2:25:29] the shortest possible time
[2:25:34] wow
[2:25:35] it was just a blue
[2:25:38] it was a blue
[2:25:41] we said okay
[2:25:43] we're going to seek the face of the lord
[2:25:46] because i know that
[2:25:48] the prophet said
[2:25:50] if you believe
[2:25:53] not even cancer
[2:25:56] can stand
[2:25:58] so i called the brother called me i said
[2:26:00] brother
[2:26:01] just stand strong in the faith
[2:26:04] don't move
[2:26:06] don't be terrified by what the doctors
[2:26:09] say
[2:26:11] just hold on to that faith
[2:26:13] because
[2:26:14] we have a legacy
[2:26:17] a legacy that anyone who believes
[2:26:21] the lord will not disappoint you
[2:26:24] and we know that the lord will not
[2:26:25] disappoint us
[2:26:28] we are holding on to that
[2:26:30] holding on to that
[2:26:33] we were praying
[2:26:35] days were going
[2:26:36] days were going the sister just started
[2:26:39] deteriorating
[2:26:40] deteriorating
[2:26:42] she became like a skeleton
[2:26:45] i don't know how many of you have ever
[2:26:46] seen florence 90 girl as shown in the
[2:26:50] message that's a prophet visit south
[2:26:51] africa
[2:26:52] you look at for a 90 girl and that was
[2:26:55] the sister the picture of the sister
[2:27:00] day by day as we are praying
[2:27:03] she was just deteriorating
[2:27:06] hopes were gone
[2:27:10] breeding sisters and you know you find
[2:27:13] people
[2:27:14] just crying weeping within themselves
[2:27:18] i mean it's not yet over but people
[2:27:21] i mean started giving out
[2:27:26] the
[2:27:27] the medical doctor said
[2:27:29] pastor
[2:27:30] at a point
[2:27:33] i don't know what to believe anymore
[2:27:35] because here is my science what i
[2:27:37] learned this is what it tells me
[2:27:40] and here is faith
[2:27:41] and it says that above all this that you
[2:27:44] have learned just put it as a trash and
[2:27:46] believe that god is going to heal it
[2:27:49] amen
[2:27:51] wow
[2:27:52] pastor how am i going to match this too
[2:27:54] am i going to i mean
[2:27:58] refuse what i've learned i've studied am
[2:28:00] i going to say that what science is
[2:28:02] saying is not true or what
[2:28:06] he said
[2:28:08] as we were praying
[2:28:11] then a message came
[2:28:13] that
[2:28:15] sister linda will not die
[2:28:19] she will leave
[2:28:22] i said god
[2:28:23] i hold on to this
[2:28:25] promise
[2:28:27] i'm never going to leave you
[2:28:29] until you have made this a fulfillment
[2:28:34] they have to go to the hospital
[2:28:37] for
[2:28:38] surgery
[2:28:42] looking at chances whether they can
[2:28:44] do some surgery and then
[2:28:47] maybe take the growth and things out
[2:28:50] when they got there they the best
[2:28:52] surgeons that we have at the calibre
[2:28:54] hospital
[2:28:55] she examined her
[2:28:57] they even cut hair
[2:28:59] and then when they cut it she realized
[2:29:01] that the cancer has spread through
[2:29:04] the lungs and everything and there's no
[2:29:06] way that he can do it
[2:29:08] so they have to patch it up again
[2:29:11] and then liver said
[2:29:13] he told the brother
[2:29:14] your wife cannot live
[2:29:16] beyond six months
[2:29:18] he's going to die
[2:29:19] they call it they said it's terminal
[2:29:21] illness i mean they threw their out
[2:29:25] and nothing can be done
[2:29:29] but i tell you
[2:29:31] at the last point where you have
[2:29:33] disappointment
[2:29:36] trust in your god
[2:29:39] believe in your god
[2:29:41] don't let that shake you
[2:29:44] hallelujah
[2:29:45] before you have a victory
[2:29:48] there will come disappointment
[2:29:51] the disappointment becomes like a
[2:29:54] stepping board
[2:29:56] you step on that disappointment and you
[2:29:58] limp to victory
[2:30:06] when the brother the husband
[2:30:09] personally came out
[2:30:12] he met
[2:30:13] a group of these surgeons doctors that
[2:30:16] were discussing about the wife
[2:30:19] fortunately
[2:30:21] there was one of the doctors who was
[2:30:24] also a schoolmate
[2:30:26] and was having a schoolmate to
[2:30:28] um
[2:30:29] at the
[2:30:30] university they attended
[2:30:32] and he was among the group
[2:30:36] that
[2:30:37] i mean
[2:30:39] saw the sister
[2:30:40] and then he called the brother and said
[2:30:44] brother
[2:30:45] well these were things are free
[2:30:47] and we know that the prophet said and
[2:30:50] he's also a message believer
[2:30:53] he said
[2:30:54] where things have reached we know that
[2:30:56] at the last day
[2:30:58] we are going to meet your sis our sister
[2:31:00] so just um let's give it up and then
[2:31:03] we we just wait for the last days when
[2:31:05] we will meet
[2:31:06] together and the brother said
[2:31:09] no way
[2:31:12] my wife is not going to die sister linda
[2:31:14] is going to leave
[2:31:16] just before he returned
[2:31:18] then here was another doctor that
[2:31:21] our brother
[2:31:23] dr cote introduced him to pasanat and
[2:31:26] then he called himself brother come
