[16:05] thanksgiving to share with the people
[16:07] this morning okay I was going to do this
[16:30] last Sunday
[16:33] but I thought decided to wait because of
[16:38] the meetings last Sunday and also to
[16:41] give me time to have more strength to
[16:45] come in and talk to you I kind of wrote
[16:49] it down because you know things kind of
[16:53] get fuzzy so this has been a very
[17:01] character building last two weeks for me
[17:07] with my dad passing and having surgery
[17:13] Rick bottom last week I was as well
[17:17] but I wanted to thank the church on
[17:20] behalf of myself and my family for your
[17:24] prayers for the card that you gave me
[17:30] it's truly a true blessing to receive
[17:38] that and in the time of my my dad
[17:45] passing that the it was it was wonderful
[17:50] so thank you for your the card in the
[17:52] kind words
[17:53] I do appreciate my family it helped us
[17:57] help miss a lot I want to give us
[18:02] special thanks to our pastor sister
[18:08] Erica they were instrumental in helping
[18:27] pastor jack has been there all every
[18:29] step of the way so I want to give honor
[18:32] and glory to him truly a wonderful
[18:36] Shepherd to his people and I can't even
[18:41] begin to express the words and the love
[18:45] that I have for our pastor because it's
[18:50] it's it's a life experiencing experience
[18:55] as a Christian to know that your pastor
[19:00] is there for you and loves you and it's
[19:04] genuine so I want to thank him for that
[19:09] just to kind of give you a little flavor
[19:14] for some of the things as it relates to
[19:18] my my dad I was able to fly home because
[19:25] I had gotten a call and he wasn't
[19:27] responsive that was on the 28th of June
[19:30] and so they had took him taken him to
[19:33] the hospital so I was able to spend a
[19:35] week with him in fact Friday on the
[19:40] let's see the event
[19:45] 6 of July my daughter and I were able to
[19:49] go up there and spend time with him and
[19:51] he was you know having fun and she was
[19:54] taking videos and pictures of him and he
[19:56] was laughing and all that and so then on
[20:01] Saturday my son came in and so my son
[20:07] sister Erica brother Jack and brother
[20:11] Olivier we were up there on Saturday we
[20:15] spent a couple hours with him and he was
[20:18] laughing and you know having fun and
[20:22] teasing just Erica about reminding her
[20:28] some family members and being a teacher
[20:29] and
[20:32] and there was another brother up there
[20:35] who he was teasing so he was laughing
[20:37] and joking and stuffing so I noticed
[20:42] that brother Jack had went got up it
[20:44] because we were we had to actually find
[20:46] him that day in the facility he was they
[20:50] had taken them to play bingo view so
[20:53] Pingo activity and so we were running
[20:56] around looking for him and we go to the
[20:59] spot where they said he was that and and
[21:01] he wasn't there and so we came back up
[21:04] and he was kind of like in a 4-year area
[21:06] he wasn't in his room is it for you area
[21:09] and we found him and so we were out
[21:13] there talking with him in fellowship and
[21:15] with him and my brother Jack left and
[21:17] went down the hall then he came back and
[21:21] so after he came back a few minutes my
[21:24] dad he was in the wheelchair he was like
[21:27] I want to go back to my room and I was
[21:30] like ok and so I was lifting up his leg
[21:35] to put it on the embrace thing there on
[21:41] that on the wheelchair and I felt I mean
[21:43] it was like kind of cold as a body was
[21:45] cold and I was like I was concerned
[21:47] because I know previously in the
[21:49] hospital his temperature had dropped but
[21:52] before they released him from the
[21:54] hospital everything was it was okay
[21:56] normal and so I asked a nurse to come
[22:01] and check him out and check out the
[22:03] vitals and stuff so and after they came
[22:07] in and checked everything that blood
[22:09] pressure was fine heart rate was fine
[22:13] temperature body temperature was fine
[22:15] oxygen was fine everything checked out
[22:17] well and so after that brother the
[22:22] brother Jack read some prayer on me some
[22:24] scriptures talk to him and pray for him
[22:28] and I could see him because he was
[22:30] getting very emotional during that
[22:31] period of time because he was really
[22:33] appreciating what was going on and so in
[22:38] fact a that point we is gonna have to go
[22:41] to
[22:42] the service and we were telling me he
[22:44] was going to be was gonna leave and he
[22:46] was like I want to go to church and I
[22:48] was like Oh daddy you can't go to church
[22:51] today he said okay and so he was they
[22:55] brought his food in and he was eating as
[22:58] wheels leaving he was eating his food
[23:00] and everything and so this was about 1
[23:03] o'clock and we left at that time so
[23:06] everything was it was fine and so once
[23:09] we left went to service and then came
[23:12] back home at service and guess about 12
[23:15] 16 I got a call from the facility that
[23:19] the nurse had it had said she had just
[23:24] came on a shift and she was making her
[23:27] rounds in about 11:35 on on that
[23:31] Saturday night the 7th
[23:34] she went his room checked them he was in
[23:36] his bed and he was he had passed at that
[23:43] time and so she also told me that that
[23:46] the Thursday before that Saturday he had
[23:52] called her and another nurse in his room
[23:56] and asked them to pray for him so though
[24:01] I didn't know so that was good to hear
[24:04] and so he had passed and then afterwards
[24:13] they had we had went up there and they
[24:15] took him I missed him by a few minutes
[24:18] or so when they was taking him out of
[24:20] the facility when we got there like 3
[24:23] o'clock in the morning they the vehicle
[24:27] for Hertz was there he went up one way
[24:29] and they came out another way and I was
[24:32] really of course I was apprehensive
[24:36] about seeing them anyway like that so I
[24:40] was torn about that that was really
[24:45] I don't kind of usually go view ideas
[24:50] like that and so they had said that on
[24:55] they called me on Monday the funeral
[24:57] home called me on Monday and said they
[24:59] they needed somebody need a family
[25:01] member to come an idea and I was like oh
[25:04] okay Lord well I guess I have to go and
[25:09] so I was very hesitant and you know just
[25:16] dealing with a lot of emotions and so
[25:18] when I went up there we they talked we
[25:22] talked about it and then it was talked
[25:24] about different things and things were
[25:25] going to go all inside the paper and
[25:27] then when they they said okay let's go
[25:30] see your dad now I was like okay so we
[25:33] had to walk down the hallway so as I'm
[25:35] walking down the hallway I'm saying into
[25:37] my mom's thinking in my thoughts I'm
[25:42] hesitant about wanting to go see them
[25:44] and then the second thing is that when I
[25:46] walk in there when I look and see them
[25:49] I'm going to be able to say that's not
[25:51] him
[25:58] to say he would be somewhere else so I I
[26:05] went in there and I saw him and he
[26:18] looked exactly like himself only perfect
[26:27] sleep and when I saw him I was just so
[26:31] overwhelmed I was so surprised that that
[26:34] was how he looked and I was just
[26:35] praising God I was like Lord thank you
[26:37] so much that you allow him to look at
[26:44] peace and the joy that I feel that he
[26:48] lived he's looked at the way he is at
[26:51] peace just give you honor and praise so
[26:55] I just thank the Lord for what he's done
[26:58] and how he's done it has been with me
[27:04] the whole time
[27:04] I give him honor and praise he's
[27:08] faithful he's we serve a faithful that's
[27:15] my testimony he's so faithful and he's
[27:19] always they already promise you'll never
[27:21] leave us or forsake us and it's true so
[27:26] there are some other events that need to
[27:27] take place in terms before the interment
[27:33] I was like a three-month wait period
[27:36] because he's going to all the to
[27:38] National Cemetery so we're waiting for
[27:42] the scheduled date before we can finish
[27:45] finish that piece of it and then our
[27:50] last Thursday I say I have surgery I
[27:53] just gotta give you a little something
[27:56] to break the air but on Thursday I had
[27:59] surgery I went into the the post
[28:05] operation room and when they rolled me
[28:08] in there
[28:09] there was a gentleman on a bed over and
[28:13] then I noticed that the nurse came over
[28:16] and taped a paper on my bed at the end
[28:21] of my bed and it was like I was looking
[28:24] I was like and then she made a loud
[28:26] announcement she said there's I'm taping
[28:28] this same name alert on the bed I'm like
[28:35] same name alert so the gentleman on the
[28:40] other side on the other bed had the same
[28:42] last name as I did and so he had his set
[28:50] of the doctors and nurses and I had my
[28:52] set and everyone will walk in it was
[28:54] like really Smith Jones yeah I can
[29:00] understand that but this name no way and
[29:04] they were I heard them Fernet trying to
[29:07] pronounce the name and stuff and they
[29:08] were saying it and he was like oh yeah
[29:10] that's gold no and I was like okay he
[29:12] going through so he goes the same thing
[29:13] I go through and he pronounces it the
[29:16] same the same way I do too so in fact he
[29:21] reached out to me on Facebook and
[29:22] because that's the first time I ever
[29:24] knew and met him he was a user white
[29:26] gentleman from Mississippi actually I
[29:28] was like well who woulda thought so I
[29:32] you know you just you just kind of push
[29:35] you it relaxed you know you just don't
[29:37] know these little things these little
[29:39] things there are God does little things

[56:34] praise the Lord
[56:37] now y'all can be seated in the presence
[56:39] of the Lord man certainly the good good
[56:45] to be in God's house and man great
[56:49] things happen in the house of the Lord
[56:52] a man I heard the specials of one a
[56:58] certain say thank the Lord for all the
[57:02] specials portion of brother
[57:04] Quentin's testimony there we heard a man
[57:08] thank God for just bringing him through
[57:09] the surgery and just appreciate all that
[57:12] the Lord is doing in our myths there
[57:17] were a couple of announcements that I
[57:18] needed to make mention of
[57:22] so we have to a couple of things
[57:27] conflict in two areas one is we we were
[57:32] gonna do our our back-to-school giveaway
[57:35] and man we have backpacks and things
[57:38] that make sure everyone's a giveaway
[57:39] just as an outreach to the community and
[57:42] one of the ideas that kind of came is
[57:44] because of what happened there's another
[57:46] meeting and I posted on the board
[57:47] brother joel gene found in miami passes
[57:51] found in miami brother familles
[57:53] old church they have their back to
[57:54] school youth services on the weekend
[57:57] that we were planning to go to
[57:58] Okeechobee so we don't like to conflict
[58:00] a man like that we try to work together
[58:02] in what we're doing so we're not gonna
[58:05] have services but we'll still have our
[58:08] back-to-school giveaway and one of the
[58:10] other ideas that came up is that we
[58:11] would put on our flyer to fight the
[58:14] neighborhood children not only for a
[58:17] backpack but also we want to be able to
[58:19] pray over the kids before they go back
[58:21] to school and our children need prayer
[58:23] amen and our schools a day so we want to
[58:27] offer that to the community amen and now
[58:29] invite them to for the smiler church
[58:33] therefore to come and receive a backpack
[58:35] and some school supplies and also even
[58:37] want to anoint them amen and pray over
[58:39] them before they go back in school so
[58:41] that's gonna be part of our plan and
[58:43] we'll be doing that on the 10th of
[58:44] August so keep that in mind and the
[58:47] sister team is gonna start working on
[58:48] the 11th I'm sorry 11th of August at 10
[58:51] o'clock in the morning it's just the
[58:53] team's gonna start working on the
[58:54] backpacks tomorrow they're in our home
[58:56] and oceania a couple sisters that
[58:58] we're gonna be helping out if anybody
[59:00] else is interested in helping and just
[59:02] please cease this of Tina amen
[59:04] in regards to them also that I believe
[59:08] that announce about the tenth meeting
[59:10] for brother
[59:12] Simmons and alas yesterday yesterday I
[59:16] should say I got an invitation to Mel
[59:19] brother Fred Mullins is also doing
[59:21] meetings on the same at the same time
[59:23] but Simmons is doing meetings so it'd be
[59:26] two meetings happening there in in South
[59:29] Carolina I know brother fred is having
[59:32] other Jason Watkins who's having a
[59:35] brother die me Regan and I brother
[59:40] Andrew Glover they'll be speaking for a
[59:42] man I think it starts on Thursday they
[59:44] have Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday
[59:46] services and also I know that I've
[59:49] brother brother Simmons will be happy
[59:51] but I said Brooks in a couple others and
[59:53] they also start on Thursday one is in
[59:55] Columbia and one is in Florence so the
[59:58] cities are you know maybe our average
[1:00:00] about to make someone like that but uh
[1:00:02] but yet the meetings will happen at the
[1:00:04] same time so I put both invitations on
[1:00:07] the board you're certainly welcome to go
[1:00:09] fellowship anybody you desire to do so
[1:00:12] just a man if you are going to go just
[1:00:15] let us know and I'm hoping that I'll get
[1:00:17] an opportunity to just kind of go up
[1:00:19] maybe for Friday night or maybe Thursday
[1:00:22] night Friday amen Saturday morning
[1:00:24] and I'll come back home on Saturday
[1:00:27] afternoon because I want to be in church
[1:00:29] on Sunday morning so I'm hoping to do
[1:00:31] that but anybody else that would like to
[1:00:33] go and be a part of some of the services
[1:00:35] I'm sure you'll be less bothered by it
[1:00:37] so we want to encourage you to do so
[1:00:40] praise the Lord a man as of so tomorrow
[1:00:45] you all keep me in prayer we have a
[1:00:48] couple things that are that are
[1:00:50] happening and just one of the precious

[1:01:06] they included me in that number they got
[1:01:08] me brother Wes Coburn smiling brother
[1:01:10] Jean and they they came up with an idea

[1:02:47] thank God for the victorious position so
[1:02:50] after service today a man I mentioned
[1:02:52] earlier this week after service today
[1:02:54] I'd like to have a brief meeting a man
[1:02:56] with the church so please keep that in
[1:02:58] mind

[1:03:02] get out but all the members of the
[1:03:04] church just remain seated I want to I
[1:03:06] want to meet with you after after
[1:03:08] service of thing amen
[1:03:10] if you always stand with me we'll go
[1:03:12] back to the scriptures that we we
[1:03:15] handled last week out of Romans a man
[1:03:21] and Romans eight and then also first
[1:03:25] John three I believe was where we read
[1:03:31] from praise the Lord
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:50] romans 8 verse 19 it says for the
[1:03:56] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:04:00] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:04:02] sons of god and man and also here over
[1:04:06] in first John 3 verse 1 and 2 will read
[1:04:13] that and have a word of Prayer and I'll
[1:04:16] let you be seated
[1:04:19] it says of a whole what man of love the
[1:04:22] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:04:26] should be called the sons of God
[1:04:29] therefore the world North us not because
[1:04:32] it knew him not beloved now are we the
[1:04:37] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[1:04:40] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:04:43] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[1:04:46] we shall see him as he is a man the Lord
[1:04:51] a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:04:52] let's just bound the word of Prayer
[1:04:56] father we're grateful for the privilege
[1:04:59] and the opportunity to come and to Lord
[1:05:05] to worship but God this is a portion of
[1:05:07] the service above our singing and
[1:05:09] everything else that happens what we
[1:05:11] need to have the word because this is
[1:05:12] the word that helps us overcome the
[1:05:14] enemy so God revealed to us the things
[1:05:17] that you would have us to know today and
[1:05:19] we want to take every spirit that's
[1:05:21] against the Spirit of God underneath the
[1:05:23] control of the Holy Ghost help us to
[1:05:26] look beyond a man ourselves that we
[1:05:29] might enter and receive from you if
[1:05:32] there was ever a place to get something
[1:05:34] from God this is the place
[1:05:36] a man so help us Lord to reach out by
[1:05:39] faith and that we may walk in one way
[1:05:42] but leave a totally different way God
[1:05:44] let that be our testimony today may
[1:05:47] hearts be encouraged uplifted
[1:05:48] strengthened and I've got me you get all
[1:05:51] the glory all the honor and all the
[1:05:52] priests from our gatherings in Jesus
[1:05:53] name we pray amen
[1:05:56] man god bless you you can be seated a
[1:05:59] man a man turn around and tell you they
[1:06:03] was gonna be all right
[1:06:13] it's gonna be alright don't worry about
[1:06:16] it it's gonna be alright
[1:06:18] a man want to thank the Lord for brother
[1:06:22] Marcus there they come join us
[1:06:25] grandfather and the prayer meetings that
[1:06:27] we have and the brothers prayer meeting
[1:06:28] he just get in and he entered right with
[1:06:30] everybody else and say it's prayer and I
[1:06:33] appreciate that Marcus god bless you
[1:06:34] amen god richly richly bless you and I
[1:06:37] no God not here we go prayer and magog
[1:06:40] are here and answer your prayer we want
[1:06:43] to continue on our topic of the
[1:06:46] revelation of the sons of God
[1:06:48] this scripture amen again that we read
[1:06:51] out of Romans 8 praise the Lord
[1:06:55] that said Romans 8:19 for the earnest
[1:06:58] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:07:01] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:07:05] when we read that from the emphatic diag
[1:07:07] lot which is the original translation of
[1:07:10] the scripture into the English language
[1:07:13] and man and I believe really the
[1:07:16] original would be Aaron Aaron mix our
[1:07:19] mix and would go to the English language
[1:07:21] when they wrote it there it said indeed
[1:07:24] the earnest expectation of the creation
[1:07:26] longs for the revel a revelation of the
[1:07:30] sons of God and not just manifestation
[1:07:33] because I think once we have a
[1:07:35] revelation it will produce manifestation
[1:07:38] right and and and I think the the the
[1:07:41] you know to think that the the worst
[1:07:44] part about our walk right now is that we
[1:07:47] just don't really know who we are
[1:07:48] we got somewhat of an idea right but it
[1:07:52] hasn't really registered way down you
[1:07:55] know on the inside and I think that in
[1:07:57] what brother branham we ran through it
[1:07:58] last week but he said the reason that we
[1:08:01] we lack in these areas is because we
[1:08:03] don't feed on this enough right we don't
[1:08:05] talk about it enough and and and I think
[1:08:08] as we start to feed on it and we begin
[1:08:10] to reflect on it it it it should arise
[1:08:15] something on the inside she just began
[1:08:17] to rise like wait a minute wait a minute
[1:08:20] I'm
[1:08:21] I'm living a million miles beneath my
[1:08:24] privileges right III I for one feel like
[1:08:29] God wouldn't allow my ears to hear
[1:08:31] things of this nature if he didn't have
[1:08:34] any intention for me to walk in this
[1:08:37] place he wouldn't be first of all he
[1:08:40] wouldn't waste his time right I mean
[1:08:42] it's not wasting my time he wouldn't
[1:08:44] waste his time think about all the
[1:08:46] people that are going to church this
[1:08:48] morning that will never hear what you're
[1:08:49] hearing right that they'll never got the
[1:08:52] same Bible that you have but will never
[1:08:54] look at that scripture the same way
[1:08:55] you're looking at it right so so God is
[1:08:57] not wasting time God is trying to
[1:09:00] elevate our you know releve help people
[1:09:04] understand get a revelation of who they
[1:09:06] are in him hallelujah so that's uh let
[1:09:10] me read a little quote here a couple
[1:09:12] quotes to kind of get us going this is
[1:09:14] out of the message what think ye of
[1:09:16] Christ amen this is probably on the back
[1:09:18] sheet of that paper I just gave you a
[1:09:19] man what thinking of Christ notice this
[1:09:23] statement that the Prophet says he says
[1:09:24] and the weakness of the church today is
[1:09:29] one of the fundamental reasons that we
[1:09:31] see no more going on in the church the
[1:09:35] first thing I think is because there's
[1:09:37] not enough travail of soul hallelujah
[1:09:41] amen I believe there's a quote that went
[1:09:43] out about that amen earlier this week on
[1:09:45] the brothers chat but we need some
[1:09:47] travail of soul amen oh my god let me
[1:09:53] just talk a little bit about that right
[1:09:55] because you know Jesus you know they
[1:09:56] were asking a question saying now why
[1:09:58] can we cast that devil out what can we
[1:10:00] get the devil out now we know you gave
[1:10:02] us power
[1:10:03] we know you told us that you know what
[1:10:05] you know that we could bind things that
[1:10:08] lose things we know you told it but what
[1:10:10] can we get this devil out this guy and
[1:10:11] and Jesus had to tell them say you know
[1:10:13] first it was your unbelief that's the
[1:10:16] first problem and then he said these
[1:10:18] times do not come out except by fasting
[1:10:21] and praying
[1:10:21] however we were taught if I can use
[1:10:24] those words hey man we were taught in
[1:10:26] some instances that because the
[1:10:28] bridegroom is with us that we don't need
[1:10:30] to we don't need a fast anymore
[1:10:31] Oh hallelujah
[1:10:33] if you look back in church history and
[1:10:36] then there was always fasting and
[1:10:38] praying around the power of God moving a
[1:10:41] man and if we can see patterns set from
[1:10:45] previous days gone by then don't you
[1:10:48] think God will do the exact same thing
[1:10:49] for us if we would apply the same
[1:10:51] principles we got to come back to
[1:10:53] fasting you got to come back to bran we
[1:10:55] just got to get back to the basics
[1:10:58] uh-huh and the good thing about this as
[1:11:01] we come back to the basis it's going to
[1:11:04] produce more than we ever imagined in
[1:11:06] this season because we got a revelation
[1:11:08] of what we're doing all right look at
[1:11:12] this he say you say first thing I think
[1:11:14] is because there's not enough to relish
[1:11:17] so to bring the person in contact with
[1:11:19] his maker it says and another thing is
[1:11:21] this is the person who does find God the
[1:11:24] person who does find God doesn't realize
[1:11:28] who he is after he's found dogs right he
[1:11:32] says see if you only realize that you're
[1:11:35] sitting now with Christ Jesus that many
[1:11:39] of the people are trying to post it off
[1:11:41] to some other great age and and all
[1:11:44] healing over the millennium and so forth
[1:11:46] and all the miracles over in the
[1:11:48] millennium or say we don't realize who
[1:11:51] we are now the Bible actually told you
[1:11:53] who you are now the Bible said now are
[1:11:55] you the sons of God it does not yet
[1:11:59] appear but we know that when he shall
[1:12:00] appear we'll be just like them but we'll
[1:12:02] see him as he is that's what the Bible
[1:12:04] said right though all he says down what
[1:12:07] are we going to need miracles in the
[1:12:08] Millenium right when we're supernatural
[1:12:12] beings so so there's no sense to me
[1:12:16] preaching to you that it's going to be
[1:12:18] all right in the Millenium no it's going
[1:12:20] to be all right now things are changing
[1:12:23] now Oh hallelujah because a revelation
[1:12:28] is telling it's in our hearts of the
[1:12:30] people they realize they gotta wait to
[1:12:32] know millennium that's what the devil
[1:12:34] wants you to do is push it off to the
[1:12:36] future but what the private told us that
[1:12:38] are safe they say what we're waiting on
[1:12:41] is for the son of God
[1:12:43] to recognize this and take it back from
[1:12:45] the devil can I tell you something that
[1:12:47] that was sitting on what belong to you
[1:12:49] the devil squatting on your property huh
[1:12:54] it's time to get the devil off your
[1:12:56] property and walk in everything that God
[1:12:59] ordained for you to have Oh glory to God
[1:13:04] see what what are we gonna do what are
[1:13:06] we gonna need miracles in a millennium
[1:13:07] when we're supernatural beings see how
[1:13:10] we're gonna need those things now the
[1:13:11] Bible said now are we the sons of God
[1:13:13] now is is a present tense now are we the
[1:13:18] sons not we will be we are now we are
[1:13:23] this morning we are this very hour oh I
[1:13:30] love this you know I was standing this
[1:13:34] last week the reason that we kind of
[1:13:36] make some of the decisions that we make
[1:13:38] is because we don't we don't recognize
[1:13:40] who he is this whole thing started off
[1:13:41] with a quote for brother Branham say
[1:13:43] Paul is writing these things amen to the
[1:13:46] church in Ephesus he's trying to reach
[1:13:48] right into the two totals Anna settle in
[1:13:50] Christ not those that are wondering
[1:13:51] whether they victorious this week gonna
[1:13:54] be defeated next week I'm a son of God
[1:13:56] today because I feel like the Son of God
[1:13:58] but next week because I fail I don't
[1:14:01] feel like a son of God no more right he
[1:14:03] tried to eat trying to get that idea out
[1:14:05] of your mind and the way that you got to
[1:14:07] look at that whatever your last name is
[1:14:10] whatever your last name is you were born
[1:14:13] into that family you didn't have no
[1:14:16] choice about you didn't even get a
[1:14:18] chance to pick and choose the family you
[1:14:20] were born in or adopted into that family
[1:14:22] the bottom line no choice of your own
[1:14:23] now when you came into the family no
[1:14:26] matter what you did it could not
[1:14:29] separate you from the family Oh
[1:14:32] hallelujah
[1:14:34] your behavior could not separate you
[1:14:36] from the family your behavior might have
[1:14:38] limited certain things you could get but
[1:14:42] certain things you can do but your
[1:14:44] behavior cannot separate you from the
[1:14:46] family and when you realize that you are
[1:14:48] son of God your behavior does not change
[1:14:51] the status of who you are
[1:14:55] but when you truly recognize who you are
[1:14:57] you gonna stop acting like you LOX Oh
[1:15:02] hallelujah
[1:15:04] we got to understand who we are Church
[1:15:06] in Christ and they stand to say we are
[1:15:08] we are this morning we are this very
[1:15:10] hour now we the sons of God seated
[1:15:13] together set together heavenly places in
[1:15:14] Christ Jesus
[1:15:15] now it says right this very minute we're
[1:15:19] seated together in heavenly places in
[1:15:20] Christ Jesus everyman by one spirit
[1:15:22] we're all baptized into one body become
[1:15:24] members of the body by the Holy Holy
[1:15:26] Spirit baptism and now we're seated
[1:15:28] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:15:29] Jesus free from judgment we can never go
[1:15:33] to the judgment how can we be judged
[1:15:35] twice you you've got a God judged Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ and he put our judgment upon
[1:15:42] Christ Christ paid our judgment at
[1:15:45] Calvary if we're in Christ be secured in
[1:15:47] Christ how do we get into Christ by one
[1:15:50] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:15:52] is that right now let me just also add
[1:15:55] this if you feel a little unsure about
[1:16:00] your experience you might just need a
[1:16:03] new touch right and this is why we you
[1:16:07] know it's one thing to get filled with
[1:16:09] the Holy Ghost it's another thing to get
[1:16:10] refilled and this is why you want you
[1:16:13] want to constantly go it I mean don't
[1:16:15] ever stop it just getting a feeling of
[1:16:16] the Holy Ghost like I told you you know
[1:16:18] you can you can get yourself a nice blue
[1:16:20] car take it out they give you and
[1:16:23] sometimes you can work it in a deal
[1:16:24] where they give you a full tank of gas
[1:16:26] when you walk it off the light and you
[1:16:29] drive that thing off a lot you'd be so
[1:16:30] happy that you have to put no gas in it
[1:16:32] come on somebody you'd be very happy you
[1:16:35] have to put you don't work that in the
[1:16:37] deal but if you keep driving that car
[1:16:39] eventually what's going to happen if
[1:16:41] that first thing a gas gonna run all the
[1:16:43] way down to empty and at that point in
[1:16:46] time it's your responsibility you can
[1:16:49] take it back to the dealership it
[1:16:51] becomes your responsibility where you
[1:16:54] got to put gas in it
[1:16:55] hallelujah Amen so has to be one feeling
[1:16:58] but many refilling if you want to keep
[1:17:01] using and the same thing it is in your
[1:17:03] spiritual walk you got you one filling
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost but you got
[1:17:06] that has many refill ins every time I
[1:17:09] come here whether it's in a prayer
[1:17:10] meeting I'm looking for a refilling
[1:17:11] whether it's in service on Sunday
[1:17:13] morning I'm looking for a refilling if
[1:17:15] it any time the church doors open I'm
[1:17:18] looking for refilling hallelujah
[1:17:22] alright alright alright stay with me
[1:17:25] here
[1:17:26] today if we can alright I want to read
[1:17:28] something else out of Revelation chapter
[1:17:29] 5 because I want us to just really kind
[1:17:32] of come to some clarity here
[1:17:34] I believe my spirit was challenged a man
[1:17:37] through the meetings on last weekend
[1:17:40] just the different brothers bringing
[1:17:41] different angles on this topic of
[1:17:44] adoption and and I want to read from
[1:17:47] Revelation chapter 5 the Prophet makes
[1:17:51] some statements here because I honestly
[1:17:53] believe this we're and I'm gonna read
[1:17:56] the quote but I believe we're walking in
[1:17:58] the earnest of our adoption right now
[1:18:02] we're walking in the earnest not the
[1:18:05] fullness but the earnest in it and if
[1:18:08] we're walking in the earnest and we're
[1:18:10] actually enjoying some of the benefits
[1:18:12] of the earnest my what do we have to
[1:18:15] look forward to when the fullness comes
[1:18:17] right but but here here's the devil the
[1:18:19] devil want us to realize that we can't
[1:18:22] even enjoy the earnest that's where the
[1:18:25] devil tried it you can't even just enjoy
[1:18:26] our he wants to just come wait wait for
[1:18:28] the fullness because you ain't got no
[1:18:29] you got nothing though we are walking in
[1:18:32] the earnest right now every son and
[1:18:35] daughter of God within the sound of my
[1:18:37] voice is walking in the earnest of the
[1:18:39] adoption I'm sorry truly born again
[1:18:42] people amen hallelujah let's read this
[1:18:46] Revelation chapter 5 the Prophet makes
[1:18:48] this statement it says but now says that
[1:18:52] now that they did all those years until
[1:18:55] now now we have the earnest of our
[1:18:57] inheritance oh my what do we have we
[1:19:00] have the earnest we have the evidence
[1:19:02] that God lives we have the evidence that
[1:19:04] God is with us we have the evidence that
[1:19:06] God is not fasciculus that we are his
[1:19:09] and he is ours because we in our bodies
[1:19:12] we now Tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God
[1:19:15] that cry that cries out Abba Father and
[1:19:17] there
[1:19:18] nothing can ever take that away we're
[1:19:19] anchored in Christ he also goes on to
[1:19:22] say this and says now the trees do not
[1:19:25] have it a man a nature does not have it
[1:19:29] but yet we are still groaning with them
[1:19:31] because as as yet we haven't received
[1:19:34] the fullness of our adoption all right
[1:19:36] but we have the earnest of it that we
[1:19:39] were picked up from the things of the
[1:19:41] world and now become sons and daughters
[1:19:44] of God what kind of people should we be
[1:19:48] all right said Omar when we think of
[1:19:51] that think of it now we have the earnest
[1:19:54] our spirits groaning for the full
[1:19:56] adoption oh that's the key our spirit is
[1:20:00] groaning for the full adoption but now
[1:20:03] we have the earnest of it and as we
[1:20:06] receive the Holy Spirit
[1:20:08] it is the earnest of our complete
[1:20:10] adoption our complete salvation oh how
[1:20:12] beautiful I just love that so so as you
[1:20:15] receive the Holy Ghost it puts you in
[1:20:17] this place okay the aren't the Holy
[1:20:19] Ghost itself gives you the Ernest the
[1:20:21] Ernest amen and I don't know if I if I
[1:20:24] got that second part is but but the
[1:20:28] Prophet actually said the Ernest
[1:20:29] actually means there is more yet to come
[1:20:32] all right the Ernest means there is more
[1:20:34] yet to come now I've got to enjoy what I
[1:20:36] do have but I know that there's more
[1:20:38] coming on this Oh hallelujah you know I
[1:20:42] was just thinking that nah man i'ma stop
[1:20:44] its paragraph 108 if you find it there
[1:20:47] 61 - zero six one one paragraph 108 I
[1:20:52] want to just kind of stop there and
[1:20:53] inject this if I can when I mentioned
[1:20:56] last week you know there's a number of
[1:20:58] course of that and I have them here I
[1:20:59] can read them to you you know one of the
[1:21:01] things that we know adoption brings us
[1:21:02] that we can lay hands I mean we tweak we
[1:21:05] stop sickness we stop disease the spoken
[1:21:08] word authority there's a number of
[1:21:11] things that adoption just presents to us
[1:21:12] a lot a lot but oftentimes when we're
[1:21:15] going through trials and we're trying to
[1:21:17] stop ourselves from going through that
[1:21:19] trial hallelujah Oh glory to God this is
[1:21:23] where I think we need to kind of submit
[1:21:25] ourselves right because we want to stop
[1:21:28] every trial Oh hallelujah
[1:21:30] a man with this with this Authority we
[1:21:33] don't want no trials that's not what God
[1:21:35] was promising we realized the trials and
[1:21:38] the tension is what brings out the
[1:21:40] greatness the trials and the tension is
[1:21:45] what brings out the greatness right if
[1:21:48] you if you didn't have trials you
[1:21:49] wouldn't even see this type of power oh
[1:21:51] yeah I don't know if we get it church I
[1:21:54] mean I'm just thinking some just so
[1:21:56] simple how simple God can be you know if
[1:21:59] it was up to brother Quinton somebody
[1:22:01] would lay hands on him he wouldn't have
[1:22:03] to go through surgery now that would
[1:22:06] have been his prerogative my preference
[1:22:09] no surgery but you get all the way to
[1:22:11] surgery all the way down there before
[1:22:14] they get to take you in and they put a
[1:22:16] tag on your bed and they say same last
[1:22:19] name now not only do they have the same
[1:22:23] last name but they were having the same
[1:22:25] surgery just on two different sides and
[1:22:30] for that man to immediately leave
[1:22:32] surgery now this man Oh hallelujah stay
[1:22:35] with me here
[1:22:35] this man thought save this best thing
[1:22:38] this ain't no coincidence I need to
[1:22:40] connect with him on Facebook that
[1:22:44] doesn't man realize who he's connecting
[1:22:46] with no not just another man with your
[1:22:51] last name hey but a son of God and
[1:22:55] you're connecting with you're bumping
[1:22:57] into eternity and the only way that can
[1:23:03] happen is if brother Quinton surrendered
[1:23:06] himself to the surgery I'm looking for
[1:23:13] greater things to come from that not
[1:23:15] just a facebook connection but even for
[1:23:18] that man to reach out to say hey there's
[1:23:20] something special about this for us to
[1:23:21] have the same last name pronounce it the
[1:23:24] same way this bear sailed no no there's
[1:23:27] more to this and we ought to understand
[1:23:29] God has purpose for everything the Bible
[1:23:33] declares that all things I don't care
[1:23:36] what you're going through this morning
[1:23:38] all things are working together for
[1:23:42] good because you love God and you have
[1:23:44] them called according to his purpose God
[1:23:50] don't make no mistakes can we go a
[1:23:52] little further here in this disk quota I
[1:23:54] just we're walking and the the earnest
[1:23:58] of it right now we're walking in the
[1:24:00] earnest of it but we're waiting for the
[1:24:03] fullness of it now brother Brandon's
[1:24:04] gotta show us in this quote what the
[1:24:06] fullness is all right
[1:24:07] since we're waiting for the fullness of
[1:24:09] adoption this will take place when at
[1:24:15] the first resurrection that's when our
[1:24:17] bodies will be changed from these vile
[1:24:19] creatures that we are and we have a body
[1:24:22] like his own glorious body
[1:24:23] so the fullness of our adoption is
[1:24:25] actually a body changed that's the
[1:24:27] fullness but the earnest a man produces
[1:24:30] a lot of other things before the body
[1:24:32] changed and what I'm saying is that we
[1:24:34] ought to as sons of God recognizing who
[1:24:37] we are we ought to begin to walk in what
[1:24:40] we have right now I'm saying if you
[1:24:43] leave Church today and you face some
[1:24:46] impossible tasks the God that opened the
[1:24:49] red stipa Moses is the same guy that I
[1:24:52] open one for you you might have to speak
[1:24:56] the same way Moses spoke the Egyptians
[1:24:58] that I seen the day I ain't seeing
[1:25:00] normal family now I want you to
[1:25:03] understand something
[1:25:04] Moses could not speak those words until
[1:25:08] he came under pressure the appreciable
[1:25:17] pressure produces power right and until
[1:25:25] you get yourself under some question
[1:25:27] you're not going to even see this you
[1:25:29] you're not gonna you're not gonna even
[1:25:31] know that this is there inside of you
[1:25:33] you know uh uh when when Paul was you
[1:25:36] know uh you know on his way there I
[1:25:38] think God told me to go to Rome and as
[1:25:40] he's on the way when we don't know he
[1:25:43] got specific instructions from an angel
[1:25:45] go to Rome now I don't care what comes
[1:25:48] between him and Rome he cannot die til
[1:25:50] he get there so a storm cannot stop
[1:25:55] all right I mean here the storm come
[1:25:58] that night as an adopted son of God Paul
[1:26:01] would have wanted to stop the summer
[1:26:02] storm
[1:26:03] but Paul actually wrote through the
[1:26:05] storm in paul thompson and that
[1:26:07] everybody that stays inside this boats
[1:26:11] do they'll make it to Rome you're gonna
[1:26:13] make it to safety and all the guys
[1:26:16] trying to jump rock the boat turn
[1:26:17] against and I'm gonna stay in the boat
[1:26:19] and you'll make it a safety here day
[1:26:22] here day they finally cut the ropes and
[1:26:24] let the other boats go in and that their
[1:26:26] ship got my god just just tossed and
[1:26:29] driven him and just tore apart inside
[1:26:32] this view recliner but what happened is
[1:26:34] that when we're all said I'm going to be
[1:26:36] can swim ashore if you can't it became
[1:26:39] if you can't make it on your own get a
[1:26:41] piece of the of the floating woods
[1:26:44] hallelujah a man an umbrella let's go
[1:26:47] preach the message you can make it I'm
[1:26:50] broken pieces in case we'll just burn a
[1:26:54] hole lover of a floating piece of will
[1:26:56] and just begin to kick your legs and
[1:27:00] you'll make it to shore
[1:27:02] everybody that was ownership made it to
[1:27:05] shore they get the saw now can't you
[1:27:10] imagine this coming through this great
[1:27:12] truck
[1:27:13] Lord you just brought me through this
[1:27:15] and I get the show and all I'm trying to
[1:27:19] do it's just warm myself near a fire I'm
[1:27:26] cold
[1:27:27] maybe shivering and then I'm just gonna
[1:27:30] put my hands up here by the fire maybe
[1:27:33] even turn his hands and maybe talking to
[1:27:36] somebody and well he got his hand them
[1:27:38] about a fire up comes a sneaking back
[1:27:41] sitting in the hand and what was Paul do
[1:27:49] can I ask the question whatever you're
[1:27:52] going through this morning what should
[1:27:54] you be doing as an adopted son of God
[1:28:03] and thought of God you can but more I
[1:28:11] don't let that bother me letting us stop
[1:28:13] me honey we almost shake it up and I'm
[1:28:16] gonna keep pressing forward I'll shut
[1:28:21] that thing off and everybody around Paul
[1:28:24] say oh he gonna die man
[1:28:25] look he might have made it through that
[1:28:27] storm but God got him not Paul wasn't
[1:28:31] interested in what nobody was saying he
[1:28:34] knew God told him to go to Rome and God
[1:28:39] and I'm bringing you to this island for
[1:28:40] you to die God gonna take you to Rome Oh
[1:28:45] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:48] hallelujah let me let me go on and read
[1:28:51] this we're waiting for this the fullness
[1:28:53] of adoption this will take place when at
[1:28:56] the first resurrection that's when our
[1:28:58] bodies will be changed from these vile
[1:29:00] creatures that we're we are and will
[1:29:02] have a body like his own glorious body
[1:29:04] but we shall see him as he is and we
[1:29:07] would be like him when he appears we
[1:29:08] appear in his likeness we will have a
[1:29:10] body like here's a glorious glorified
[1:29:12] body and all the trials and struggles of
[1:29:14] life will fade off into a little mist
[1:29:17] and blow away to never be no more and
[1:29:21] these earth the Tabernacles went which
[1:29:24] we now grown in we're waiting for that
[1:29:26] earnest that for the salvation fully in
[1:29:30] its fullness to come but now in these
[1:29:32] Tabernacles are clay we have something
[1:29:34] that tells us that we have raised up so
[1:29:35] far a man what is the earnest it's the
[1:29:39] little downpayment that holds it brother
[1:29:41] Dow is too earnest now once we once when
[1:29:45] we love the things of the world once
[1:29:47] when once when we sinned and went about
[1:29:49] doing things of the world and cared not
[1:29:52] for God we were alienated from him
[1:29:54] without God without Christ in the world
[1:29:56] now God sent His Holy Spirit and through
[1:29:59] that we are lifted up from those things
[1:30:02] we have the earnest that we know that we
[1:30:04] passed from death unto life amen
[1:30:06] here as I was trying to show it show
[1:30:08] this like this here is where the
[1:30:10] ordinary center runs down here on the
[1:30:13] bottom now the Christian goes up a
[1:30:15] little higher than this he rises above
[1:30:17] all that stuff that's the earnest of his
[1:30:20] salvation
[1:30:21] Amen so as believers we're supposed to
[1:30:24] be able to get a lot higher than the
[1:30:25] things that we're going through you know
[1:30:27] brother Branham likens us to Eagles and
[1:30:30] Eagles when a storm comes the eagle has
[1:30:33] the has the ability to rise above the
[1:30:35] storm and just keep sailing this is what
[1:30:39] we're supposed to do as believers amen
[1:30:41] and and so when we talk about this
[1:30:43] earnest Amen it's the down payment is
[1:30:46] something to hold it it's also a man it
[1:30:49] means that there's more is yet to come
[1:30:53] he said divine healing is there earnest
[1:30:56] of our redeemed body so when we get sick
[1:30:59] and you know in your console trying to
[1:31:01] do whatever you can to make yourself
[1:31:02] feel better it shows that this body is
[1:31:05] not the final body God got another body
[1:31:08] a redeemed body that he wants to take
[1:31:10] you to and we are alone to go into that
[1:31:12] body a body that does not get old a body
[1:31:15] that does not get tired a body that
[1:31:18] cannot get sick we're all looking to be
[1:31:21] changed to go inside that body
[1:31:23] hallelujah
[1:31:24] since we're all we're now drawing he
[1:31:26] makes this come since we are now drawing
[1:31:28] on the earnest of our salvation so every
[1:31:31] time I if I if there's a sickness that
[1:31:33] as attack of my body and God comes back
[1:31:35] in heals me I'm drawing on the earnest
[1:31:37] of my salvation I'm drawing on what
[1:31:40] Calvary actually provided me he was
[1:31:43] wounded for my transgressions bruised
[1:31:45] for my iniquities the chastisement of my
[1:31:47] peace is upon him and with His stripes I
[1:31:49] am him so I'm healed so I'm drawing on
[1:31:52] the earnest Alleluia I'm enjoying the
[1:31:54] benefits of this thing I was uh you know
[1:31:59] we I mentioned to you last week about
[1:32:01] how mighty pray for the baby there in
[1:32:03] the you know and in the hospital room
[1:32:06] and and and the one of the things that I
[1:32:08] want I want to just try to make it clear
[1:32:09] I honestly believe that we see this type
[1:32:12] of power we see it when we're in some
[1:32:16] situations you know brother branham was
[1:32:19] in the situation where them bees were
[1:32:21] they were circling man these are killer
[1:32:23] bees ready to kill you just disrupted
[1:32:26] our environment and pretty much the
[1:32:29] reason said no we don't like that and
[1:32:31] these bleep bees got together we've
[1:32:33] taken this fella out standing outside
[1:32:35] cut this grass no shirt on these beans
[1:32:38] are ready to attack and so here he's
[1:32:41] standing there and they say all of a
[1:32:42] sudden perfect love divine love came
[1:32:45] down and he said he say he start talking
[1:32:47] to the bees Oh y'all might think that's
[1:32:51] crazy
[1:32:51] y'all talk to y'all cats and y'all dogs
[1:32:55] and y'all actually think they y'all
[1:32:57] think that they understand what you
[1:33:00] sayin he don't understand he just see
[1:33:06] that that that treat in your hand and he
[1:33:09] know what that means
[1:33:11] hallelujah my cat know exactly what to
[1:33:14] do to get food he know exactly what to
[1:33:17] do to go outside he got I said we're
[1:33:19] just just standing this spot scrape on
[1:33:21] the on the on the on the door and then
[1:33:24] that lets us know that you want to go
[1:33:25] outside right out how did he come up
[1:33:27] with that how he came up with this on
[1:33:31] his own and that's his way of
[1:33:33] communicating oh my god
[1:33:36] but they understand right they
[1:33:39] understand certain things and and also
[1:33:42] here you know brother branham sitting
[1:33:43] there and these bees are just
[1:33:44] surrounding him and and he be giving he
[1:33:47] just he say oh you know I'm sorry you
[1:33:51] know this is what God gave y'all and I
[1:33:52] interrupt a job area I'm sorry
[1:33:54] you know I took I didn't mean to do that
[1:33:56] y'all go back to y'all hive a man I
[1:33:59] didn't mean to do that I'm sorry go back
[1:34:00] to your house in the name of the Lord
[1:34:02] Jesus and then bees come around like
[1:34:06] this and went right back to the hive now
[1:34:09] most of us if that would have happened
[1:34:10] us and we see bees come around like this
[1:34:13] we going back to our hive but ringing
[1:34:18] out running bees so with this power
[1:34:21] there is a love that's associated with
[1:34:26] it
[1:34:27] hallelujah there's a certain character
[1:34:31] that that goes with this right and this
[1:34:34] is why this is why God trying to work on
[1:34:36] the character of every individual in
[1:34:38] here amen because because if you don't
[1:34:40] really have that love you can do some
[1:34:43] damage to somebody we're brother Branham
[1:34:48] saw the bull he wasn't even looking for
[1:34:52] if this this is what I mean because some
[1:34:54] of us will take this power we don't look
[1:34:55] at the problems your own when you do it
[1:34:59] that way you're absolutely wrong but
[1:35:01] recognizing that when the problem comes
[1:35:03] to you that there's something on the
[1:35:06] inside of you to put that devil in his
[1:35:08] place there's a couple of earnest
[1:35:14] situations that I could I could quickly
[1:35:17] share one I mean you all I told you all
[1:35:20] about the being at the airport and man
[1:35:26] there was we didn't know we just got to
[1:35:30] the airport trying to get on the plane
[1:35:31] we were supposed to be flying to England
[1:35:32] but we were going through Detroit and I
[1:35:35] said well we don't have to be there no
[1:35:37] three hours ahead of time I'm not
[1:35:38] sitting in an airport that long
[1:35:40] let's just get up there about hour
[1:35:42] before would be good well we said if I
[1:35:44] hour we got there four to five minutes
[1:35:45] before and we got there to the counter
[1:35:49] say no no you can't get on this plane I
[1:35:51] say huh
[1:35:52] I said I say you got to rebook your
[1:35:55] tickets
[1:35:56] I say how much that's gonna cost they
[1:35:58] said thousands I said no no no way we
[1:36:01] can't lose that and they have to pay
[1:36:03] something else and no we can't do that
[1:36:05] so this they said well sir you're not
[1:36:07] getting on this plane and me and my wife
[1:36:10] was going back and forth of these people
[1:36:12] trying to get on this plane and and and
[1:36:15] as we were as we were there I kind of
[1:36:17] pulled to the side so hearing all this
[1:36:18] pressure you know what you're gonna do
[1:36:20] you know so we don't got mistake plan
[1:36:23] and going for a week and now we can't
[1:36:25] get on the plane and you know what's
[1:36:26] gonna happen here
[1:36:27] so you know I said well I just pulled to
[1:36:30] the side and I'm sitting there waiting
[1:36:32] to try to get over there and then I
[1:36:33] heard the Holy Spirit say to me you know
[1:36:36] it was the same God that stopped a plane
[1:36:38] for the woman and men
[1:36:40] Tennessee is the same god that's able to
[1:36:43] stop this plane and I said well a man I
[1:36:46] believe that see God did share that
[1:36:48] testimony with me just to be sharing a
[1:36:50] testimony it was to come back up at a
[1:36:52] time that I needed it and I say well in
[1:36:55] the name of the Lord Jesus this planning
[1:36:58] on go no went till we get on I spoke it
[1:37:01] now nobody was there but me and God my
[1:37:05] wife didn't hear me say that nobody else
[1:37:06] that was with me heard me say that but I
[1:37:08] said and I just sat there and then I was
[1:37:10] sitting there watchin it and some of the
[1:37:12] sex was already on board on the plane
[1:37:14] and here that plane was stuck for 30
[1:37:16] minutes on the ground and when it was
[1:37:19] stuck the lady comes to say uh sir I
[1:37:22] think we can get you on the plane say oh
[1:37:23] yeah you can get us off so you're gonna
[1:37:25] get again y'all come real quick come
[1:37:27] real quick come real quick so here they
[1:37:29] got us rushing through and we get on the
[1:37:31] plane and come to find out because some
[1:37:33] of the Saints was already on the plane
[1:37:34] come to find that they don't announce on
[1:37:36] the plane we got some international
[1:37:38] passengers that were running a little
[1:37:40] late and we didn't want to leave them
[1:37:42] here in West Palm if you all would
[1:37:43] forgive them amen they're coming so we
[1:37:45] get on a plane to everybody looking at
[1:37:47] us crazy but the reason to playing with
[1:37:50] ground is because they had mechanical
[1:37:51] problems I want to go a little further
[1:37:54] the reason the plane was grounded
[1:37:55] because the Son of God spoke to the
[1:37:58] plane so I'll take the blame that is my
[1:38:03] fault actually is not my fault but but
[1:38:07] but you put me in a position where I had
[1:38:11] to exercise in the authority that God
[1:38:15] has anointed me to operate in this is
[1:38:21] the earnest that's the earnest now I
[1:38:24] doubt now that don't mean every time I
[1:38:26] go to airport
[1:38:30] that's not wisdom right amen when you
[1:38:34] get into a situation gotta show up
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:43] I was brother quitting we were talking
[1:38:45] and he had an assignment it was going
[1:38:49] somewhere and I prayed about the Lord
[1:38:52] told him to go to a certain city he went
[1:38:54] to the city he got there to the city
[1:38:56] it's a report for work and did an
[1:38:58] interview with somebody and that guy
[1:39:01] went to him through the interviewing and
[1:39:02] the counter towards the end of the
[1:39:04] interview the guys say I think I want
[1:39:07] somebody else not you anyway huh now
[1:39:12] this is put up in a shoo-in no I think I
[1:39:14] want somebody else or not you so it

[1:39:41] itself something to eat somebody called
[1:39:44] him and and the person that called them

[1:39:47] a telephone call to somebody and he
[1:39:49] ended up talking to some big purse and
[1:39:51] and somebody had arranged for him to be
[1:39:53] in that job so he told him what it
[1:39:55] happened he said he said yeah I don't

[1:42:13] sons feel son speak we will have our
[1:42:15] word backed a man there's a promise that
[1:42:18] if a brother needed rain you would have
[1:42:20] the authority and the power to give him
[1:42:21] rain there's another promise that we
[1:42:24] would have checkbook authority
[1:42:26] our names are supposed to be just as
[1:42:29] good as the father's name a man on the
[1:42:32] check hallelujah and there's another
[1:42:34] promise that we would be a super church
[1:42:36] a super race as we need him I read this
[1:42:39] scripture last week and I want to bring
[1:42:41] it back around to you now first Peter
[1:42:43] chapter 2 Laurita god and verse 9 this
[1:42:49] scripture been carrying me through the
[1:42:51] last year
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:00] then carry me through the last year look
[1:43:02] at this first Peter chapter 2 and verse
[1:43:04] 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:43:10] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:43:15] people that ye should show forth the
[1:43:17] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:43:19] of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:43:22] and I want to read it again keep it
[1:43:25] there on the screen because I want to
[1:43:26] read it to you from an emphatic dialect
[1:43:28] but ye but you are a chosen race not
[1:43:31] just chosen generation but chosen race a
[1:43:35] royal priesthood a holy nation a people
[1:43:41] for a purpose not just a peculiar people
[1:43:45] but a people for a purpose you were put
[1:43:48] on this earth for a purpose a people for
[1:43:52] a purpose a man that you and I don't
[1:43:55] look at this that you may declare the
[1:43:58] perfections of him that you may declare
[1:44:03] the perfections of him who called you
[1:44:06] from darkness into his wonderful life so
[1:44:09] if it's you are supposed to be declaring
[1:44:12] God's perfection Oh hallelujah
[1:44:15] that diamond got to be cut and it's got
[1:44:19] to be cut a certain way because amen it
[1:44:22] has to reflect seven lights and in the
[1:44:25] cut there's three things that deal with
[1:44:26] the cut right the brightness to fire the
[1:44:29] scintillation those three things did
[1:44:31] with the cut but it brings forth seven
[1:44:33] lights oh my god my god you are supposed
[1:44:38] to declare the perfections of him who
[1:44:41] called you from darkness into his
[1:44:42] wonderful life so when I read that
[1:44:44] scripture I did in fact emphatic die
[1:44:47] Glocke I couldn't help but go to the
[1:44:49] pergamene church age and I have to give
[1:44:51] you a quote that goes right along with
[1:44:53] that scripture now look at this you are
[1:44:54] a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy
[1:44:57] nation of people for a purpose a man
[1:45:00] that you may declare the perfections of
[1:45:02] him who called you from darkness into
[1:45:04] his wonderful night that
[1:45:05] scripture went right along with a quote
[1:45:07] that the angel the Lord told the Prophet
[1:45:10] to pick up his pen and write and when
[1:45:12] the angel told the Prophet to pick up
[1:45:14] his pen and write the angel was writing
[1:45:17] a message not to the Prophet but the
[1:45:20] angel was writing a message to you o if
[1:45:27] an angel wrote a message to me I would
[1:45:29] want to know what the angel had to say
[1:45:32] and I'm only giving you a portion of it
[1:45:35] but if you if you would go back and I
[1:45:37] mean the first time this was mentioned
[1:45:39] was in the message O Lord Jesus it
[1:45:46] slipped my mind it'll come back to me I
[1:45:50] had to come back to me the spoken word
[1:45:53] is the original seed first time it was
[1:45:55] mentioned now we pick it up in the
[1:45:57] church age book in the program in church
[1:45:58] a look at this the angel said this
[1:46:03] here's what I'm trying to say to you
[1:46:06] make it personal
[1:46:08] here's what I'm trying to say to you the
[1:46:11] law of reproduction is that each species
[1:46:14] forth after its own kind even according
[1:46:18] to Genesis 111 and God said let the
[1:46:22] earth bring forth grass and the herb
[1:46:25] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:46:27] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:46:30] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:46:34] so whatever life was in the seed came
[1:46:37] forth into a plant and thence into fruit
[1:46:40] the very same law applies to the church
[1:46:44] today
[1:46:45] whatever sea started the church will
[1:46:48] come forth and be like the original sea
[1:46:51] because it is the same seat in these
[1:46:56] last days the true bride church Christ
[1:46:59] will come to the headstone look at this
[1:47:02] and she will be the super church a super
[1:47:10] race as
[1:47:12] she nears him oh I love dams right amen
[1:47:16] because Peter said your chosen race
[1:47:18] right so a super race glory to God a
[1:47:21] super race as she nears him they in the
[1:47:23] bride will be so much like him that they
[1:47:27] will be even in his very image this is
[1:47:31] in order to be united with him they will
[1:47:33] be one they will be the very
[1:47:35] manifestation in the word of Living God
[1:47:37] denominations cannot produce this
[1:47:45] hallelujah
[1:47:46] denominations cannot produce this Rome
[1:47:49] see they will produce their crease in
[1:47:51] their dogmas mixed with the word this
[1:47:53] mongrelized and brings forth a hybrid
[1:47:56] product when I looked at that scripture
[1:47:59] you have chosen race a royal priesthood
[1:48:01] a rosin a holy nation of people for a
[1:48:04] purpose that you may declare the
[1:48:05] perfections of him who called you from
[1:48:07] darkness into his wonderful light I
[1:48:08] couldn't help but go back to that quote
[1:48:10] because you you are supposed to be a
[1:48:13] super Church you're supposed to be a
[1:48:15] super race as you get closer to Christ
[1:48:17] now you know I had to I had to look at
[1:48:20] that word super cuz we use it so so
[1:48:22] casually you know we and everybody walk
[1:48:27] around with the Superman shirt and you
[1:48:32] know and now can I just I use them since
[1:48:36] I'm there the only time you see what
[1:48:42] Superman is made of is when it's
[1:48:46] impression
[1:48:50] if it ain't no pressure he's a reporter
[1:48:57] he just he just he got a different name
[1:49:01] when his the name is Clark Kent when he
[1:49:04] is not under pressure but but when
[1:49:07] pressure should come he don't talk to
[1:49:10] nobody
[1:49:11] I mean vacuum out there he used to go to
[1:49:13] a phone booth like you're making a
[1:49:16] telephone call and he come out with a
[1:49:18] cape on and and you know and everybody
[1:49:21] everybody just so so so so uh adamant
[1:49:24] about just you know I mean they're ready
[1:49:26] to show that answer on the chest huh but
[1:49:29] but even Superman has something that'll
[1:49:31] stop him Oh hallelujah that's why I'm
[1:49:35] not trying to be like Superman because
[1:49:39] as the Bride of Christ I cannot be
[1:49:41] stopped as an adopted son of God I
[1:49:44] cannot be stopped and when the pressure
[1:49:47] comes it will produce the power that is
[1:49:50] in my life these seeds have been sold
[1:49:54] and that's what's going to come forth
[1:49:56] but you have to wait for the opportunity
[1:50:00] before you actually display what is on
[1:50:02] the inside of you
[1:50:04] hallelujah Church right well not when I
[1:50:07] think about this word super what super
[1:50:10] means is surpassing others of its kind
[1:50:14] you're supposed to surpass others the NS
[1:50:18] Church is just like you they look like
[1:50:20] you they act like you they worship like
[1:50:22] you but just supposed to surpass them oh
[1:50:25] my god there's Christians that look just
[1:50:28] like you act like you but you're
[1:50:29] supposed to surpass them that's what
[1:50:33] super Church super race is all about
[1:50:35] we're supposed to surpass others of our
[1:50:37] kind God called us to be super all right
[1:50:43] let me go on a little further here this
[1:50:47] is our message Tahoma Jireh
[1:50:51] it says as we come up here to Sodom in a
[1:50:56] few minutes watch how it is how it takes
[1:50:58] place they're exactly how the promise is
[1:51:00] for the last day
[1:51:01] and what he would do he was confirming
[1:51:04] it showing that he tore the body of
[1:51:06] Jesus apart taking the spirit lifted up
[1:51:09] the body to the right hand of the throne
[1:51:10] of God and sat down the other part the
[1:51:14] party tore out the spirit upon us which
[1:51:17] is called the Holy Spirit and the very
[1:51:19] life that was in Christ is in you the
[1:51:23] very life that was in Christ is in you
[1:51:26] now and let me also just at this since
[1:51:28] we're we're already operating in the
[1:51:31] earnest of our adoption remember the
[1:51:33] statement of the Prophet me it says all
[1:51:35] that God was he poured into Jesus now
[1:51:39] we're operating in the earnest of our
[1:51:41] adoption but pressing into the fullness
[1:51:43] of it all right so so here all that God
[1:51:46] was he poured it into Jesus but he used
[1:51:50] a different verb when he talked about
[1:51:53] all that Jesus was he to say he poured
[1:51:58] it he says he's pouring so that's a
[1:52:04] continuation we're still receiving right
[1:52:08] he's pouring it into the church or the
[1:52:11] bride right so we're constantly
[1:52:13] receiving what God has for us a man I
[1:52:18] don't actually when I come and realize
[1:52:21] that I will never exhaust all that God
[1:52:23] is so I might as well just enjoy what I
[1:52:26] do have and keep expecting more
[1:52:30] hallelujah the very life that was in
[1:52:33] crisis at you that shows he's your
[1:52:36] Redeemer he's adopted you unto God and
[1:52:39] now are we sons and daughters of God
[1:52:43] with us with the Spirit of Christ a man
[1:52:45] works that I do show you do also greater
[1:52:47] than this show you do for I go into my
[1:52:49] father amen the spirit that was in him
[1:52:52] is on you eternal life
[1:52:54] he's the giver of eternal life he's a
[1:52:56] redeemer to bring back that which fell
[1:52:58] in the fall in the human race to bring
[1:53:01] back to God and the spirit that was that
[1:53:03] was in crisis in you and if the spirit
[1:53:05] of Dylan was in me I'd have God's if the
[1:53:08] spirit of an artist was in me I paint
[1:53:11] pictures if the Spirit of Christ is in
[1:53:13] you the works of Christ
[1:53:15] do Amen that's right the light that was
[1:53:18] in him is in you all right now let me
[1:53:31] just read maybe one or two more here and
[1:53:34] I'm gonna bring it to a close this
[1:53:37] revelation has got to be made real to us
[1:53:39] and my brother branham told us that the
[1:53:42] reason that a man we're lacking because
[1:53:45] we just don't feed on it enough so I
[1:53:47] just want to make sure I'm so in the
[1:53:48] right season to this church because this
[1:53:51] is my expectation and my expectation is
[1:53:53] not that we got to bring everything to
[1:53:55] the church to be prayed for by the
[1:53:56] pastor my expectations that you lay
[1:54:01] hands on the seat and you'll see them
[1:54:03] becoming a man that's that's my
[1:54:06] expectation not not you know oh ho I
[1:54:09] don't know what to do you already know
[1:54:10] what to do you know the Bible the Bible
[1:54:12] say if we lay hands on the sick you know
[1:54:14] yeah you got to do that Church and we're
[1:54:17] gonna hear the testimonies come forth
[1:54:18] from them oh look at this all right
[1:54:24] this is out of the message look away to
[1:54:30] Jesus
[1:54:31] Oh actually know before we read that
[1:54:36] believers position in Christ to believe
[1:54:38] its position in Christ let me read that
[1:54:40] they're not going to look away in - look
[1:54:41] away - Jesus don't take these things
[1:54:46] like the church you know we were in
[1:54:49] Sunday school this morning a quote that
[1:54:51] I ran into yesterday in a church age
[1:54:53] book and brother Branham talked about
[1:54:54] how the invasion of error that would
[1:54:58] come just before Jesus returns all right
[1:55:02] and and and the way it puts it like
[1:55:04] right at the time that the invasion of
[1:55:07] error comes that's the same time Jesus
[1:55:09] would be coming first church now when
[1:55:12] you catch it and you see it you know
[1:55:13] from that angle
[1:55:15] it ought to cause you to want to become
[1:55:18] a priests right where you're interceding
[1:55:22] on behalf of others because you realize
[1:55:24] just as lot had no idea destruction was
[1:55:27] on the way well I had no I
[1:55:29] we have clarity through a profit of
[1:55:32] what's getting ready to happen we see
[1:55:34] things happening he spoke that these
[1:55:36] things would happen we see it being
[1:55:38] fulfilled now we got to start standing
[1:55:40] the gap for others hallelujah right now
[1:55:44] you know we see these things in church
[1:55:46] we I mean this if there was ever a time
[1:55:48] now you know if I could just put it this
[1:55:51] way 60 years ago 50 years ago 40 years
[1:55:58] ago people have prayer-meeting feel the
[1:56:01] power of God in that place like mine God
[1:56:03] if you were to took prayer me and you
[1:56:05] were shook and everybody pressed to get
[1:56:08] to the premium that was not if that
[1:56:10] wasn't a service that you had to beg
[1:56:11] people to come to people knew they
[1:56:13] needed God's now we just take it so
[1:56:15] lightly right it's just prayer do you
[1:56:19] realize prayer is your greatest weapon
[1:56:22] do you realize that that if things are
[1:56:26] if things are gonna change it's gonna
[1:56:28] come through prayer and now you just
[1:56:31] push prayer to the side like it ain't
[1:56:34] right and and and I just just kind of
[1:56:37] bugs me you mean to tell me all your
[1:56:39] prayers but is all of them that you
[1:56:43] don't need to pray no more something
[1:56:46] wrong somewhere the church shouldn't be
[1:56:48] slacking up in this air and that the
[1:56:50] church should actually get in a hurry
[1:56:52] with God amen hallelujah glory to God
[1:56:57] and please please please don't lie to
[1:57:00] the Holy Ghost and don't lie to yourself
[1:57:03] we're a free at home
[1:57:11] don't get caught on the spot you might
[1:57:14] say a one-minute prayer at home you
[1:57:17] might say you might you might but if
[1:57:22] your schedule is anything like my
[1:57:24] schedule the devil blocked you from
[1:57:26] praying at home and we might as well be
[1:57:28] honest with ourselves
[1:57:31] uuuuu you may pray after you get a
[1:57:34] little texture and somebody pray for us
[1:57:36] essentially
[1:57:36] oh lord please heal such as such amen
[1:57:43] and you call it that prayer all right
[1:57:47] church of dads ever time to be praying
[1:57:49] now is that time and I tell you when you
[1:57:53] recognize how close this thing is and
[1:57:56] how the prophetess laid these things out
[1:57:58] we've seen it there it's feel right
[1:57:59] before their eyes
[1:58:00] it ought to cause us all to get more
[1:58:02] deeper in prayer
[1:58:03] that's what Abraham did when he knew lot
[1:58:06] was getting ready to go down he began to
[1:58:08] pray hallelujah all right let's go
[1:58:11] believers position in Christ says and
[1:58:13] they stay in Moses and Elijah appear so
[1:58:15] forth and so forth then they show him
[1:58:18] and they seem Jesus only when he looked
[1:58:20] back then God the Father after put in a
[1:58:22] robe on her son she said this is my
[1:58:24] beloved son hear him no wonder Jesus
[1:58:26] could say all the powers of heaven and
[1:58:27] earth that's given him to meet unto my
[1:58:29] hand for he was adopted by his father
[1:58:31] into the glorious kingdom of God now
[1:58:33] sitting in the majesty of the right hand
[1:58:35] above every Ark Angel and Angel every
[1:58:39] star Moon or every name that's named in
[1:58:42] heaven it's subject to the name of Jesus
[1:58:44] Christ but he was adopted by God the
[1:58:47] Father don't forget now you as the Son
[1:58:48] of God a man your words even greater
[1:58:51] than Archangels works amen we read that
[1:58:54] for you last week
[1:58:55] now sitting in the majesty of the right
[1:58:57] hand dr. Kemp's our paragraph the next
[1:59:00] paragraph now into his church you
[1:59:04] that's positionally is seated in
[1:59:06] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:59:08] be humble brethren someday the Holy
[1:59:11] Spirit will speak to you call you out to
[1:59:14] one side somewhere in a little cabin on
[1:59:16] a hillside or in the washroom somewhere
[1:59:20] and there will anoint you for a certain
[1:59:22] service
[1:59:23] or certain thing to do it won't be the
[1:59:26] laying on of the hands of the presbytery
[1:59:28] elders it'll be the laying on the hands
[1:59:31] of God Almighty Himself to put a new
[1:59:33] ministry in you and a new robe on you
[1:59:35] and to set you out as an example and all
[1:59:38] the demons out of torment will never
[1:59:40] upset you
[1:59:41] god grant my brethren that will each one
[1:59:44] receive this blessing and it says shall
[1:59:46] we pray I want to just read one more a
[1:59:49] man to you and then we'll pray were
[1:59:50] closed off right there this is out of
[1:59:52] the message to look away to Jesus in
[1:59:55] this message look away to Jesus brother
[1:59:58] Branham makes a very striking statement
[2:00:01] that I'll read to you but he was talking
[2:00:04] about you know we're living in an hour
[2:00:06] we can expect a third pool that's what
[2:00:08] he was that he was talking about his
[2:00:09] third pool was the opening of the word
[2:00:11] amen but he he also made another comment
[2:00:14] about the third pool - that thing that
[2:00:16] we want to see here amen in this quote
[2:00:19] glory to God it says so now I'm gonna
[2:00:22] say something to you
[2:00:23] now that I haven't said all along and
[2:00:26] that is that the thing that we have
[2:00:28] looked forward to for so long so we're
[2:00:31] constantly looking for we have the
[2:00:32] earnest but we are Amen still walking
[2:00:36] towards the fullness of our adoption
[2:00:37] which would be the body change it says I
[2:00:39] haven't said that all along and that is
[2:00:41] the thing that we have looked forward to
[2:00:43] for so long for at least many years four
[2:00:46] or five years or maybe longer
[2:00:47] the third pool has now been vindicated
[2:00:49] and I'm sure you all know what it is it
[2:00:53] meant that he's referring back to the
[2:00:54] opening of the word okay it was already
[2:00:57] vindicated when God gave him the
[2:01:00] revelation of the seals nobody else ever
[2:01:02] received that nobody so so that opening
[2:01:04] of the word a man was very thats why I
[2:01:06] say you know we're not we're this is not
[2:01:08] to try to imitate brother Branham right
[2:01:11] you can't do that no one is gonna have
[2:01:13] the ministry that he had God gave that
[2:01:15] very specifically just like Paul's
[2:01:18] ministry was specific right
[2:01:20] God did that but when we talk about the
[2:01:22] power of God that was on display Jesus
[2:01:25] said these signs shall follow them that
[2:01:27] belief so we're supposed to expect those
[2:01:30] things okay so so here now he goes our
[2:01:32] senses and I remember they'll never be
[2:01:34] impersonation of that because they can't
[2:01:38] be see it cannot be now it's in existent
[2:01:42] and I have I am warned of this that soon
[2:01:44] right at this time now it just happened
[2:01:47] so it could so it could identify its
[2:01:52] presence among you see but it will not
[2:01:54] be used in a great way
[2:01:57] Oh hallelujah it would not be used in a
[2:02:00] great way until this counselor begins to
[2:02:03] tighten up I want to I want to sew this
[2:02:07] one into the church it won't be used in
[2:02:09] a great way until the council begins to
[2:02:12] tighten up so this don't mean you're
[2:02:13] gonna go out and start empty in the
[2:02:14] hospital rules that's not what this is
[2:02:16] all about it won't be used in a great
[2:02:19] wait until this council begins to
[2:02:21] tighten up and when it does when that
[2:02:23] does the Pentecostals are so forked
[2:02:25] almost impersonally anything that can be
[2:02:27] done but when that time comes when the
[2:02:30] squeeze comes down then you'll see what
[2:02:35] you've seen temporarily be manifested
[2:02:38] and the fullness of its power si si si
[2:02:44] si so what's going to push it out what's
[2:02:49] going to cause a man this of what we're
[2:02:52] talking about as far as our place in
[2:02:53] Christ what's going to push it out it's
[2:02:55] gonna be the pressure that we come under
[2:02:56] and like I was telling you all on Friday
[2:02:59] night a man a dime and gets his sparkle
[2:03:04] through the cutting through the pressure
[2:03:06] through the process that it has to go
[2:03:08] through a man before it actually you
[2:03:11] know becomes a real valuable diamond and
[2:03:13] I'll tell you what church we're gonna we
[2:03:15] got to we got to face some things we
[2:03:18] can't run from our trials glory got like
[2:03:20] like the entire army of Israel was
[2:03:22] running from Goliath but when David came
[2:03:25] on the scene the running stopped
[2:03:27] hallelujah it's gonna be some sons of
[2:03:29] God that's gone amen
[2:03:31] they probably just maybe something you
[2:03:33] ain't heard about like David had never
[2:03:34] heard about Goliath but he come into
[2:03:36] this cut look look look I can't stand
[2:03:38] this fella define the armies of the
[2:03:40] Living God
[2:03:42] hey I don't seen God deliver bear into
[2:03:46] my hand
[2:03:47] I don't sing God deliver lying into my
[2:03:49] hand and this fellas gonna be just like
[2:03:51] the lion or the bear and you know this
[2:03:54] David was speaking it out of his mouth
[2:03:56] before it actually came to pass and it
[2:04:00] was a man that was operating with no
[2:04:01] fear as the bright we're moving into a
[2:04:05] place no fear when the squeeze come what
[2:04:09] we've seen temporarily we manifested in
[2:04:13] the fullness I believe that I believe
[2:04:19] that and so it's not a season for us to
[2:04:23] get discouraged but this is a season for
[2:04:27] us to remain encouraged as what God has
[2:04:29] promised us he will bring it to pass
[2:04:32] this is the revelation that the sons of
[2:04:35] God needs in this hour let's pray father
[2:04:42] God we thank you for these promises that
[2:04:47] you've laid before us it's not a prophet
[2:04:53] that would share these things these are
[2:04:55] things that we didn't just hear in
[2:04:56] church as we were going up but God you
[2:05:01] you laid out these things and you told
[2:05:05] us God that we the reason that we don't
[2:05:07] see these things cuz we don't feed on it
[2:05:08] enough so lord help us to feed on it
[2:05:10] help us Lord to to walk in this we were
[2:05:16] already walking in the earnest stomach
[2:05:19] different things that have happened in
[2:05:21] our lives
[2:05:22] showing that we're walking in the
[2:05:24] earnest of it and these things that
[2:05:26] happening it's not something that we we
[2:05:30] try to create or make happen it happens
[2:05:33] because pressure produces it and Lord as
[2:05:36] our sons of God and daughters of God no
[2:05:39] fear no fear you've not given us a
[2:05:44] spirit of fear but of love power and a
[2:05:46] sound mind so help us to operate father
[2:05:49] the way that you have called us to
[2:05:51] operate help us Lord to demonstrate a
[2:05:55] man your character and in demonstrating
[2:05:59] your character will also
[2:06:00] demonstrate your power and your
[2:06:01] authority we don't know what we'll face
[2:06:06] we don't know what we're running to even
[2:06:08] have to relieve this place today we have
[2:06:10] no idea but I do know this that you have
[2:06:13] prepared us for whatever the trial is
[2:06:15] you have prepared us you have you have
[2:06:19] already provided you have made a way and
[2:06:21] you are you are the way you are the
[2:06:23] truth you are the length life so god we
[2:06:25] just trust that you would help us a man
[2:06:28] to not uh not let this just go in one
[2:06:31] ear and out the other but help us to let
[2:06:33] it father really register the depth of
[2:06:35] our soul if there's anybody here just
[2:06:36] doubting of salvation God my prayer my
[2:06:40] prayer is that you give a revelation of
[2:06:43] who they are there's nothing they could
[2:06:44] do if they're if they were born of God
[2:06:47] children of God there's not one thing
[2:06:49] they can do that could ever separate
[2:06:51] them from the family of God that's not
[2:06:54] anything for us to take advantage of the
[2:06:57] Lord that's something I should call just
[2:06:58] to walk humbly before you to recognize
[2:07:02] that your love is your love goes beyond
[2:07:04] our false your love goes beyond my
[2:07:06] failures of your love goes beyond our
[2:07:08] mistakes what love what matchless love
[2:07:13] God we thank you for that so I pray Lord
[2:07:16] that each one will receive what you're
[2:07:20] trying to bring to them today God is in
[2:07:22] the mighty name of Jesus that we ask it
[2:07:25] amen
[2:07:26] I'm a man let's give the Lord a hand of
[2:07:29] praise go to Solomon I'll give this
[2:07:33] urgency week
