TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] this evening I appreciate him tonight uh we want to start second second Corinthians 12 from the a first it says for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that I might depart that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest uh upon me therefore I take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecution and distress for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then I'm strong amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word tonight uh we're going to be using our same topic that we use uh on on Sunday morning uh what God uses who God uses and how God uses and uh you know I think the more that you at least for me the more I look at a subject the more that that a subject kind of kind of opens up to us and you know as we we get started one of the things that we're just trying to buy this little thought encourage us uh because we we have we have thought patterns and things that we grow up with uh and mindsets and everything and uh and uh those things a lot of times it's just contrary to the things of God uh the minds the mind of God and the mindset of God uh when we look at scripture uh the greatest example that we had in Scripture it was Jesus Christ the work God coming down and manifesting himself in In the Flesh and by by looking at Jesus Christ his ministry uh and his life you don't see what he had the same type of thought patterns and mindset as we do as as as as human beings is that right and I think his life uh serves as an example for us uh the believer with the baptisms of mother holy ghost that you know we we supposed to be redeemed and I believe we are how many could say we redeemed tonight we we've been redeemed by the by the blood of the lamb and we we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think that the scripture is is bringing forth for transformation just holistically in our life I like that word holistically because uh scripturally I believe God wants us to be a scriptural Christians living a certain type of Life operate in a certain kind of way having a certain kind of mindset if if if we're going to be true Witnesses and I think that you know we we know that God God has never left been left without any kind of witnesses and so if we're going to be the right kind of witnesses uh we have to have the right kind of uh mindset we we talked about uh soundness of Doctrine a little bit on on Sunday morning um and having a basis for our stand right um like I often say I say things for a reason a lot of times and sometimes it rubs people the wrong way but sometimes you still gotta say it uh for me in in 30 years of preaching you just want for the church to be to be sound you want the church to be settled and and you don't say things I think some sometimes and maybe this will help because a lot of people may not know me a lot of people seeing maybe seeing me for the first time uh on YouTube and internet and probably say well that guy's a rough guy but but realistically I'm not uh uh I'm just trying to bring a message that I think that'll help us and stabilize us because I think if people would have lived in the days of Jesus Christ they probably and that's probably why a lot of people walked away from him because you know he said things sometimes that was real cutting sometimes he said things that were real hard could you imagine being Jesus's mama and that day when when she she lost Jesus and and and when she caught up with him you know after a while she said your father and I and and so he he stopped real quick right and said well wait a minute wait a minute you changing your testimony now you your testimony in the beginning was uh what was conceived in you was of the Holy Ghost and now you making Joseph my father he's he's like woman what you talking about you know I'm what I'm doing right now as a young boy I'm about my father's business is that right and could could you imagine you know how cutting that was to her flesh right to think that you know what I I bought this seed I you know he he he nursed and and and and all of this and then you know uh before people he would make a statement like this but what what what it was was the word was correcting the era right amen and I believe that with what we've been taught it the the word the words sometimes don't feel good even for me when when I'm not you know measuring up to the word of God and I hear certain things it troubled me but but I have to heal myself to it is that right and just ask God to help in areas because you know we're we're human beings and things of that nature right right but but it's not something that you know the word is not here and we're not here as a Ministry like we're we're attacking the people and and we're beating the people it's just that you know we all built different y'all know me I'm I don't teach the same way I I get noisy and loud and all of that and I'm a big guy uh and so sometimes people misinterpret that right instead of really uh entering into the spirit and trying to comprehend what what is brother Smiley really trying to say what is he trying to uh get over to us right uh they they look at all of those things and be like man that man going crazy oh ain't going crazy if that's the case you probably wouldn't have lasted in in the days of John the Baptist in the days of Jesus we you know what would it what what would it have been in the days of the Apostles these you know the the word of God just comes to transform us bring about bring about change not it's not an attack it's not to be offensive blessed is he does not offended it's totally impossible for me to be offended at the work right My Flesh might squirm like everybody else but I can't be offended because it's it's the preaching of the Gospel it's the thing that that uh uh uh that settles us right uh and so when we when we we're been talking of kind of talking about weakness right and so with with this thought I was thinking on on my drive over I was thinking you know we we gotta have something because it's just the way we're wide sometimes uh well we're we're this and I'm I'm weak and I'm insufficient and I can't do this that was that was the same mindset and attitude that Moses had is that right when when he met the pillar fire in the burning bush right and and God was giving him his commission we talked a little bit about this uh on on on Sunday morning right hey he felt like well you know what and I'm quite sure uh as a man realizing the first attempt at bringing Deliverance he probably was like man I bitterly fail and and I I was intellectual I was educated I was a military man right hey man I was I was in a place I was in such a he felt like he was in such a position that he could deliver the people through education and and Military might and and things of that nature is that right but uh all he did was accomplish is getting one dead Egyptian that right when he he was read he knew that from from uh a youngster up that he was a proper child he was special right and and that and that he was born to be a deliverer according to promise right but through human ability and human efforts he failed he failed miserably so I could have I could imagine from a humanistic standpoint you know uh uh you know you you meet the pillar of fire and and God starts speaking to you and and trying to commission you and you like bad listen you know who made man to speak right but like we were saying God wasn't really trying to listen to his excuses right it's like God God had predestinated chosen him Amen to build delivered is that right and see the same thing in this age that we're living in this this layout of sin age God has predestinated us right to be Overcomers to be different yeah to to live different to respond different to things right glory to God glory to God and so and so you know uh in the little message of perfect strength by Perfect weakness I think it it serves as something to to settle Us in in the Holy Spirit right uh give us a answer for the thing that plagues us right because we're emotional creatures come on Church right we're emotional creatures and and a lot of times we allow our feelings and our emotions to overcome us right you know I the little things even even in the scripture you know uh great man of God the Apostle Paul he was struggling because he had eye trouble right and and he he wanted Deliverance right he was like man I don't pray I you know Lord you know if there's any kind of way you know you'll do something for me right he was he was looking because he you know sometimes we look at those things and we feel like well if this is hard for me to get the job done but one of the things that even me I fail to realize sometimes when I'm in something man I'm part of a promise and I serve I serve a supernatural God you know my little mccoying cutting up it is cranking but I went to drive it over here I was all happy on the job boy why told me this morning she had a mechanic and uh he called me back in 20 minutes man I got your car cranking while he's ready I thought I'm like I'm on the job shouting around man I get in that thing it wouldn't go past 40. I was I was discouraged I was I was kind of discouraged but you know what God knows all things you know I was I was appreciating the brother what was his name Sunday Darren okay there I should remember that I got a cousin name there uh I will hold my I said if that brother could lay hands on on a on a vacuum cleaner I go lay hands over my car I went ahead I went ahead you know because you got to be crazy to do something like that right but if his wife vacuum cleaned still running in but uh and also I said well Lord you know the next person who works on my car trusted they find a problem they found that problem but now I got another problem right but you know what God God no God knows all things is that right God God is uh in charge of all things I had to drive my dirty dirty work truck but that's okay I ain't dirty I don't smell y'all I did baby put all the love you know a little clone so we're gonna be all right all right so let's let's kind of move forward right um because like we say uh by this it gives us some information to to settle these things when when when these types of thoughts come we got something to combat right these thoughts and in in the age that we're living in we need a man's spiritual information to combat cause we're in a real battle church this this this is the worst age of them all everything from the time of the fall all the way down through the entire New Testament uh uh uh history everything is right here at the end time fighting right two hundred thousand thousand demons been loose from the river Euphrates to fight against us is that right amen and so we we thank God that we we have information right to combat these things because I know different than anybody else I I have my struggles in in areas but when you look at these things it it's the thing that helps to to settle you settle your spirit right to keep to keep us just from being emotional wrecks keep us at the doctor's office right amen because when when your emotional these things affect your body and all of that so so I think by the information that we get from the word it it keeps us it keeps us settled right amen um the problem here in in a statement in perfect uh perfect Faith by Perfect weakness he says like there's so many of us likes to testify or to think that we're insufficient right and therefore we make that an excuse well I'm insufficient I have no education I have no ability I'm able to do this right I'm a sidebar here if if God has called you something to do something the ability was predestinated amen uh in you before you ever got here you you think about every prophet in the scripture they were ordained before they were ever even you know uh Jeremiah said he told Jeremy before listen before you was ever even in the water of your mother I ordained you to be a prophet and the prophetic ability was already there whether you can comprehend that or not the prophetic ability was already there right glory to God and so uh with with these things when we when we say well I'm I'm insufficient and I have no education you know and I I'm a living witness how I remember my early days in Ministry I was like Lord what in the world are you doing right what in the world are you doing I'm a high school dropout I'm not educated I don't have no formal training I haven't been to any Bible school and then you know only a few years into preaching with no real no real grasp he said okay I want you to take over Church you want me to do what no it's got to be somebody else and then you look around and you realize ain't nobody else this bill is set up all the time what why you know and then you want to question God why me God said you know what before you ever before you ever got here when you was in the streets running crazy I had already ordained for you to do something supernaturally in the Supernatural Realm right and and despite and despite your deficiencies right or your insufficiencies uh you're going to do the job because the the ability is there already by the spirit right it's it's already there sometimes I I remember this and I ain't no great saying good or nothing like that but I can't hold it to him [Laughter] the holy tune this time I ever I ever sung a special shocked myself now like you mean to tell me that was in me all the time when I was out there smoking blunts God said I hid it I hit it I hit all that right amen see so so when when we think when we think we're insufficient it just takes God to reveal to you what's really land there it shocks us sometimes the ability I'm quite sure sister Burrows never thought she'd be a songwriter right and look look at look at what songwriting has done and what singing his songwriting and the places that is taking up right but probably during the days of Peace was lying she probably ain't wrote nothing down on a piece of paper right but but but in the right season in the right time under the right atmosphere all of a sudden you you just writing you just writing songs that they singing around the world is that right glory to God amen so he he says so many of us likes to testify and to think that we're insufficient therefore we make that an excuse I have no education I don't have no ability I'm ability to do it uh do this and if you keep that up and do that in that way and keep going on like that then you can't amount to anything see it what is it what is he trying to do here change our mindset change the way that we think right change the way that we think see not not constantly going on I'm insufficient I ain't no good you know I ain't this because some there's there's people that lives a lifetime with that type of mindset real real negative right and and it's and it's real easy to do especially when when you you know you might be looking at other people right amen you you're looking at other people and them growing and they're cheering it and other ministers churches blowing up right and and you know sometimes you look around like but I'm struggling with 20 people where rich sometimes that might be all God gives you right amen he he might give this man you know because because much is giving much is required and and everybody don't have the same measure so so you you can't look at what somebody else got because you know those things that mess up your spirit right man he traveling around the country you know he's going he doing this and he's doing that just focus focus on what what God has ordained for you to do and the ability because see with what watch this with what God has ordained for you to do you're sufficient enough to do it right see you know like like uh people used to tell my wife what I don't know how you do it with six kids really see God knew some people couldn't handle no more than two yeah some people couldn't handle no more than one you see people you see people sometimes they got one child and they about to they about to lose their mind huh and and you know she she got six it's kind of like you know uh brother Banner he tells the story about the shepherd and walking through the marketplace with all of those sheeps and folks standing back like boy I know this feeling to be chaos no it's not no it's not they train they just gonna follow the shepherd right through dang I'm bothering that Daniel right you know I mean she was just built she was just built to handle six kids and come here children and her her quirky way of dealing with them and we could go we could go places we I remember times we would be sitting up in Golden Corral and little kids be tearing up this gummy bears all over the place and you know cake crumbs all over this like this and they just sitting there like little Troopers they just eating and the people around us be like when they leaving they dragging in Little Johnny like ma'am how do you do it just that and the other man man they made enough well they know better they ain't always like this I used to have them myself you know all six of them we are eating right hey but now when they go home that's a whole other ball game that home now is foreign you know it's the works but but it but in public but it's how you raise them y'all know what I'm talking about you know when when we was coming up you know all you needed was a look they ain't even have to speak that that looked terrified you like it because if she look again it's on and popping from there she might do it right in church didn't I tell you right I think I think we we get away from we get away from scripture and we intellectualize it and that's why we got all of these kids running crazy and and killing one another I mean you know we was talking today on the job because I worked with another pastor friend of mine and uh you know we we talk about our upbringing and and we were in the streets and things but you know you might get a dust up but you ain't really have to worry about dying but but here's the thing that I realized right um my mother's generation and her you know my mother's mother you know a lot of those a lot of those folks their parents took them to church if Daddy didn't go Mama went right I remember growing up in church in Jersey and um not the men didn't hardly go unless it was Mother's Day my dad and my uncles and all of them they didn't go I thank God my my daddy baby brother he he he he in church now you know but but when they were coming up they was not going to church but but you would see you would see my grandmother her daughters I mean cousins Galore we we raised up going to church you know uh the Bible said train up a child in the way that it should go right and so they did their part and but see what what has happened every generation has gotten away from Biblical principles so it it don't really hardly give the kids what's needed amen for them to survive in this age and then then you know you because it wasn't cute back in the day for young girls to have babies that wasn't cute huh it went it was those things weren't cute back in the day that's fine it's cute everybody got babies you you know and then and then with with no upbringing and babies trying to raise babies and and and look look what we got look look what we got and then without the only I'll say this the only thing that really I think saved save saved me uh is because I had something that even when I was in the streets I knew better I knew better because my my mother my grandmothers they they took me to the house of God and I went to Sunday school I sang in the choir I was on the junior Usher board right and so you know even though I was out there something way deep down you know in the back part of my mind you know when I was really starting to do the silly silly you know it's like boy Lord have mercy boy your Grandmama boy love you know and those things those things dealt with me I think well I'm I'm kind of getting off a little bit and but I think that you know uh if we if we could get degenerations to get back in to get back in God and the pandemic ain't did no no better cause it's less people not going to church than it's ever been in the property of the history right amen let's let's go a little further I got about 30 minutes amen but we we through our excuses we we want to see where we are sufficient and we're sufficient where God wants us we're adequate right in the areas where God wants us to be we have just enough to get the job done right whether y'all think so or not sometimes I think to live in this age we have what it takes to live in this age and be victorious to to be the standard right to be the light of of this age is that right glory to his wonderful name okay so so here uh he says we make the excuses and by excuses watch this wow see watch this God God knows who we are we're fearfully and wonderfully made right and and God knows our weaknesses and all of that right but God looks at those things in a way that we don't look at those things sometimes right see I I like this next statement it says God uses those very things to tackle the job he said what no no God knows us right we we're fearfully and wonderfully made can we say Amen to that right amen and so and so when when we're when we're just you know this efficient and and this and that God God looking at that thing and we can see it scripturally we could see several several Brothers in the scriptures when when when God called upon them to do to do things bye look at here man I can't get the job done I I can't do it you know the church was so in such a bad shape at one time that they wouldn't even they were ordained of God to be victorious right in the Book of Judges they they were ordained to be Victorious and and and to to fight battles and and overcome but they would they would they were so messed up in their understanding that they wouldn't the men wouldn't even go out and fight unless Deborah went with them come on that's messed up right soldiers ordained of God to be Victorious and they were like but we ain't going unless the prophetess go with us what could you imagine that I'm glad I went in that group I don't have much y'all like y'all ain't going to battle unless the prophetess go which is the judge of whatever her calling was at that time I know she was a judge right man that's that's backsliding to me right when a man won't want to step up and take his place right oh my okay he said God uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get in that condition so that he can use us right we take the excuses and say well I can't do this I'm insufficient can't do it God takes the very thing to do the job that's true he says that's the reason why he chooses us God chooses us because God knows exactly what we can do right God knows exactly what we it ain't it might shock us the things that we do in God but but it don't it don't it don't shock God right it don't it don't shock God when you when you see somebody raise up and and accomplishing things uh for God the god ain't shocked I I I I watch I watch uh our Deacon brother Troy uh and and when he comes up that's so good brother Troy preaching the gospel in the years that that you know me and brother Jack Rose up and had churches and and doing meetings together you know all over the place uh you know you you it just never even crossed your mind and then in the right season right in in the right season you know he quickened brother Troy bring him in Anchor him in the face in the faith right and then after a few years you see what was it God saw that that ability was there all the time right I'm quite sure when he looked back he was like well I never saw that I never saw that coming I mean I've been I've been a Christian is 1988 we all come up together we all I knew he could sing some and and and and operate and hold down officers in church well I should have said it like that but praise it out y'all don't make me tell a joke now let's leave that alone now I mean he has an ability he can he can hold up uh audience he can bring in atmosphere right amen amen now now I will say this Detroit and I told him this I won't say that I won't I don't already see it something happened to his voice over the couple of them years of spans of doing this thing because because Troy I call him Troy that's my brother-in-law so if I call her by his first day y'all forgive me but but deep really you could hold a note and really could do some things back in the days you've quieted in Okeechobee yeah but I'm gonna leave that alone y'all but I'm just used he don't mind if I use him as an example right amen you know just just to show you how how things can come full circle and and you know you you might look at a thing or you might look at yourself and feel like well I can't I can't do this job this this is this is just too big for me uh I'm quite sure brother Jack did probably in the early days never thought he'd be running a church right but God God knew that the ability was there all the time and I'm quite sure when he started out a lot of criticisms right but 20 years has passed and it's a constant climb right it's okay let's face it but when you start preaching boy it's difficult I remember I remember man my first my first sermon boy look at here I remember the time I told Brother James that I cause I ain't want to preach really after I stopped preaching that brother was I won't preach no more I want to try to sing a little bit I ain't went and man I used to have spasms so bad my wife used to say are you all right your show garlic trying to I don't know I don't care I ain't preaching I ain't never preaching right but after months and months and months of that you know and then get into a place where I felt like God was going to kill me I'm like okay all right Lord if you don't kill me this service I'm gonna go talk to the pastor and and you know brother James he was so nonchalant about things sometimes uh but but I I need to talk to you uh okay come in the office man I said I feel I think I feel a call to preach oh yeah oh okay all right all right that was it I walked out the office so I said Lord okay I went I kept my end man that brother wait till I got home my brother hey how you doing you think you can handle Tuesday night my mouth couldn't say no but I sure wanted to man my stomach boy first sermon you know I made it through I made it through by the grace of God and then brother van he said boy it ain't always going to be like that my second sermon I preach man I don't know my mind went blank hey I just lost trainer thought I struggled I want to leave the pulpit but I couldn't God came in he was just showing me something see here's the thing you got to come to a place where you recognize it's got to be God if it's gonna if it's gonna work if you're going to accomplish anything amen it's got to be God and then my third sermon I preached in New Jersey and I preached the and it wasn't even me I know like brother brother uh Birds used to always tell me by the way I know that when you boy I know you I know you that wasn't you I know it wasn't I trusted in him right man we preached I preached so I scared myself I said did all that come out of me and I wasn't even paying third message and that's when I got prophecy about pastoring and all that kind of stuff like that right and here I've been almost 30 years right no no training no no nothing but being trained by the Holy Ghost right amen okay so he says uh that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition now that sounds strange but just a few minutes and we'll get to the reason that's on 45. um if God's willing he said we find out just as we have been reading that weaknesses and rejection we find out that those people who are the weakest right the weakest and rejected by the outside world is God's Heroes that conquer up in the front lines take takes those who are feel themselves unworthy right watch watch what God uses right watch the the weakest and rejected drunk smoke everything at the bottom of the barrel God said boy you right you just right you right right now right cause if it was me when I had my wits and and going to school and and semi-educated and all of that you know why did I stand that no because you're the man he got like you'd have made a mess you're the pro you know you'd approach the thing just like Moses from an intellectual standpoint amen and you never would have really been able to be effective right you never you know we don't have nothing against education we don't you know I I'm for people going to school and things of that nature but you know you can you can educate yourself Ministry wise don't you mean you gotta call it right amen that don't even mean because you got a school you got degrees that don't even mean you got a gift and and you go and you go sometimes in places and the first thing they want to do is send you off to some school or or you can't preach you can send a man off to all the schools you want if he ain't got a calling on his life he'll never really be able to uh uh function in this capacity he won't be able to do it you won't be able to do it it's it's got to be what's been predestinated amen by God before the foundations of the world see look at look at what because look at the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul you know with all of that education and and and back in that he had he still didn't even fully know the scripture come on he really he couldn't he couldn't see the unveiling of the Mighty God he couldn't see the unfolded because the the thing that he should have been a part of that was the thing that he was persecuting right and he was educated talk taught by the one of the the greatest professors it was of his time right he had he had the the backing amen of the ministry he didn't know what he was doing right he didn't he didn't know what he was doing and he had to get himself he had to get himself to a place where where he realized you know what why I gotta count everything I got is nothing as as dumb so so so that I can get a clue about what I'm doing right and and once he got knocked off with that horse and got filled with the bat cause all he had was education right but amen once he got the true baptism of the Holy Ghost right amen and then he sat under the feet of Jesus then he was able to teach look what he look what he he did by being predestinated to be a man the one of the eyes to the body come on right one of the eyes to the seven eyes to the body right can y'all say Amen yeah I don't believe you say what seven ah you spiritually it's Seven Seals Seven Stars in his right hand right glory to his wonderful day amen but he had to get to that place and then look he got to a place where you know I'm quite sure he he he felt he felt weak could you because you gotta you gotta imagine something a man that a man that Once Upon a Time had real real education real real intellect even petering them Peter them testified you know that you know Paul different come on right y'all know y'all Peter peace Peter testified Paul different Paul Paul don't Paul Don't Preach like us right Paul Paul is on another level and that's why that's why you know what Peter could respect Paul when Paul rebuked him right for acting one way with the Jews and when the boys come around here another way Paul Paul Paul was like bro Peter bro P I could imagine that conversation there brother Peter what you doing man bring it up to 20 20. bro Peter come on bro come on bro try to call them dog come on dog no I'm just kidding come on you y'all know how folk talk come on bro how do you expect these people Amen to live up to a certain standard when when they see you compromising you acting one way you know when the people you know the Jews ain't there and when they come you know you act like you don't know them y'all know what I'm talking about done that you know be you know everybody laughing and green and then didn't act like they only want to be identified with you right amen and I'm quite sure you know Peter was probably looking at Paul like Paul different right because you know what it it took something right it took something from Paul to be able to take the word of God right and and correct the error to bring a different kind of mindset a soundness because if he didn't right if he if Paul wouldn't have said nothing Peter would have went right on being one way when the people ain't there and be in another way when he right amen sometimes you know what you gotta say you gotta say difficult things right because because if you don't if you don't correct the error right if you don't set the things in order what happens Trends in different things follow after things right because see you one of the things you don't want to be doing God of service without it being his will right I'm I'm gonna give you something because sometimes sometimes people think well you harsh and and you know you well you shouldn't have said nothing well somebody got to say something right amen uh in order to place everything in line with the scripture right look at it look at that the the the the the the time when uh uh uh Vesta right when when when the king called her and she said well I'm doing my thing I I understand it man please many girls we over here we getting it in I ain't coming right question King like well I built it up boy my wife bad but she just dished me right and then and then and then one of the one of you know the spiritual men like wait a minute man you better get a hold of this thing because if if you don't right if you don't all because she's in leadership position and and if you if you don't say nothing then all the way all the women gonna be dishing their husbands right come on look look what look what look what uh prophet of God he talked about watch watch we just had uh Barack and and Michelle Obama they were trendsetters you you find whatever she did most of that's what they want to do right you you you find people find examples of people to to follow right and so it's just important that people in headship positions Ministry ministers young ministers right to have to have the right foundation to do things in order right um I'm I'm a little bit different y'all know y'all know this uh and not to be mean or anything right but but y'all know as Shepherds and and things you know uh we we different we think different we suspicious we we look we look at things on a whole nother level from a whole nother mindset than everybody else right when when everybody else when everybody else is applaud knit and happy with it be like I'm sorry you missed the scripture right you you missed the scripture and that's that's see you you're looking at this but you're not looking at all of this right amen you're not looking all of this to follow because because now you you set uh uh uh some sort of standard right right and so okay they got by with that and then you'll see this another group popping up and a lot another group popping up and not another group popping up but the the the Autumn because listen listen when the order of a thing is broken you got chaos right let the stars of one of those things move out of those heavenly hosts move out of this position we got chaos if the moon stopped doing this job we got chaos if it decides it wants to be the sun we got a mess on our hands right amen God God placed everything positionally in order so so that everything could function the way that it's supposed to be and so if we start breaking the order of the scripture we got chaos we don't have God now right we don't have God no matter how much Quivers no matter no matter he's left the building ichabag is over the whole thing we see and that that's the way that I look at things right I look at I look at things from a you know I look at it and like no I I know see people that's not as spiritual might think that that was okay but then you find a a god-called man a Shepherd look like that and it's not that you're trying to be offensive are you trying to hurt somebody you know they won't let me do nothing we want you to do what God has ordained for you to do in the will of God in line with the scriptures right glory to God in line with the scripture you ain't never going to find God outside of but my time up you ain't but I'm just feeling starting to feel good you're never going to find God outside of his word God ain't operating God ain't doing nothing outside of his word right that that's why we had uh a man to preach doing God a service without it being his will right it's showing us the musts the must the must not look dislocate the must not do this you must not do that right you can't look at the initial you you got to look at what the sea will produce what what the scene of that right right come on look look at look at look at God two minutes and I'm gonna go cause I'm finna get stirred up now but I feel good you you could see God started the church a man in the book of Acts on the word right right baptism in the name of Jesus right repent and be baptized and every and and given the Holy Ghost is that right that's a requirement to produce change right come on right but then after so many rounds of the Apostles this historical they they went up to nicaea and and they brought they brought in a Doctrine right that was so contrary from the original Bible doctrine that they that they got a man uh in the beginning right and so instead of a man the name they took the name out see the devil know there's still power in the name of Jesus but and then they brings in titles a father Son and Holy Ghost s and then it it looks see when when the white horse rider started out man he started out with a doctrine of something that looked so in inoffensive right something that you know it won't hurt nobody this won't hurt nothing right right then and there because it was in his seed form but look what happened amen when it got on the red horse hmm right then you start seeing some blood at first it you know that's just like sin it's so insufficient when it starts out and it sees form right well I smoke a little joint hey Kiki last you get the munchies that's seed form huh and then next time you find yourself out there on on ecstasy and crack and and and right come on I know what I'm talking about I'm not now this ain't getting no book I'm just talking about I'm talking about me see it starts out so innocent you sneaking in the bushes and your deck your mom and them don't know they're gonna know it all after a while you just keep on going mm-hmm yeah everything starts our innocence the first the first time you said a bad word huh then next time you know man you cussing like a sailor you see any any seed form it looks it looks harmless insufficient you know like this ain't gonna do much but once the thing amen uh get roots and start to grow and take on a life of his own and start producing its full potential then you know what you got then you know what it is and so this is why uh you gotta cut a thing down a man before it gets uh time to be Warden and grow and spread well praise the Lord amen I feel good now I'm ready to go to Arizona this idea I feel I feel all right now hey man as long as the Holy Ghost come down right but but it it's a lot don't ever think that we Mad Men could we not right it's it's just that you know the Watchmen in the tower he sit up way higher than than everybody around and the people that's on the ground should be depending on the Watchmen to recognize and understand a man what's coming after them watch me one of the night right because they train that's dangerous that's Danger right don't open the gates and then that's danger you can tell how you could tell how they're coming in and how they ride right okay they coming in peace that's good right you ought to just say Lord I Thank you for a good Watchman because he could recognize something that I can't recognize because I ain't up on the tower and I don't have the ability so that's why that's why we we have to appreciate uh our pastor uh for his diligence and and the word that he bring not that he want to be offensive it's things that you don't even want to say you know you'd be like man uh why don't you make me say that I didn't want to say that if people start texting and calling and this and that you'd be like man I you know what you built for you'll be all right you'd be all right but but I say things and I just trust that y'all understand y'all understand me you know I appreciate brother Jack because I understand brother Jack by being a Shepherd it's a heart it's a hard job because it's so much we we in different places when you know different mindsets and man you're trying to find the mind of God and you don't want to be offensive and all that but sometimes you just got to you just got to say it right Amen Let us let us let us get the announcements first let us have a word of prayer and then we get the announcements and and all that you you wanna okay y'all give us that let's buy a word prayer gracious father we just thank
