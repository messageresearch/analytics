[33:25] giving you do have the ability online to
[33:29] give if you're streaming and I do thank
[33:32] God for those that are a man online and
[33:36] just making a conscious decision to give
[33:40] a man I think it's a real blessing I was
[33:42] thinking on this the other day when you
[33:45] go to a restaurant you eat
[33:47] you always give something for the meal
[33:50] right and if you are eating spiritually
[33:54] you should give something for the meal I
[33:55] bring it along if that alright alright
[33:58] man we a men lower I'll just leave it in
[34:01] leave that between you and God that's
[34:03] what God said the same so but you have
[34:05] the ability to give online and that's
[34:08] through cash app you can do that we have
[34:12] their own on the bottom so going to cash
[34:14] simple spirit of true tea you can sell
[34:16] the offering or tithing or whatever
[34:18] through cash also if you want to use
[34:21] PayPal you just choose send to a friend
[34:24] or family member and you would use the
[34:27] email address of giving at John 4:23 or
[34:31] giving at John four to three
[34:35] so keep that in mind those that are in
[34:37] the sanctuary we have our box there on
[34:40] the table the wooden box that you would
[34:42] put your offering your tithing in and
[34:44] you can do that after before or after
[34:46] service but we'll prove our giving at
[34:48] this moment to a man and
[34:51] move forward in the service father we
[34:52] thank you for the ability to be able to
[34:57] give and law we actually to it use this
[34:59] for the furthest of your kingdom God be
[35:02] glorified and magnify and all that we do
[35:04] thank you for being a provider thank you
[35:08] Lord for God just all that you have done
[35:11] and just showing and proving yourself
[35:13] over and over again that you are at work
[35:16] father even now so we thank you Lord
[35:19] that you've allowed us to come back into
[35:20] the house to the Lord today thank you
[35:21] for our precious same-store that are
[35:26] considered at risk by God you kept them
[35:29] through this entire time if you allowed
[35:31] them to come back into the house of the
[35:33] Lord and today God was grateful for that
[35:36] and Lord those that are still at home
[35:38] and God made me desire we pray that you
[35:40] open up doors for him to be able to get
[35:42] back into the house of God as well I get
[35:44] all the glory and all the honor and we
[35:46] forget to turn our attention towards the
[35:48] word of the Lord we pray that she would
[35:50] just minister to his father even right
[35:52] now through your word bless those that
[35:55] are watching online and got me you've
[35:56] ministered to them as well right where
[35:58] they're sitting
[35:59] be glorified in magna
[36:01] fired in the service this morning in
[36:03] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[36:06] you musicians thank you so much man I
[36:12] will just prepare to read a a couple
[36:17] scriptures ma'am
[36:25] and see here they're very familiar
[36:33] scriptures that we'll read today
[36:37] one is Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6
[36:46] and then also Revelation chapter 10 and
[36:50] verse 7 we'll just kind of take our time
[36:57] with this particular subject there is
[37:01] you know we we we are I feel we're
[37:06] responsible for the stream that we have
[37:11] and there are people that are watching
[37:15] us that have never even heard about our
[37:17] church and what we're all about they're
[37:19] just see us as a church and that's
[37:21] perfectly fine we are a church a man but
[37:26] but there's something that we believe as
[37:30] a church and you know there are things
[37:31] that you can go in other churches you
[37:33] don't even really know what they believe
[37:34] if you if you ask them questions they
[37:36] really wouldn't be able to give you
[37:38] answers but there's there's things that
[37:41] we believe and you know and we're just
[37:44] kind of not necessarily reestablishing a
[37:46] man it's just you know we want to take
[37:48] our time and kind of go through this and
[37:50] I think it's almost - some of us it's
[37:52] almost going like almost like a
[37:54] rehearsal but others this may be
[37:57] something brand-new that they have never
[37:59] heard before and so I want to do all I
[38:02] can to make sure I take time to explain
[38:07] you know from scripture where we stand
[38:10] if the Bible a man does not provide
[38:13] our foundation to our belief then
[38:16] something wrong somewhere and so I mean
[38:19] you hear strange things coming on this
[38:21] string strain with what is that never
[38:24] heard that before well let's try to go
[38:25] back to Scripture and help us to
[38:28] understand you know where we're coming
[38:30] from praise the Lord
[38:33] if I could just let the people know that
[38:37] when we're saying the things that we're
[38:39] saying we you may not realize it but we
[38:42] have stepped into a vision a man we have
[38:46] entered into a vision there there was
[38:49] prophecy in scripture actually written
[38:52] about us a man before we were born right
[38:57] while we were yet sinners there was a
[38:59] prophecy in Scripture written about us
[39:02] it didn't have my name per se a man but
[39:07] it did have my condition is that right
[39:11] my heart was messed up I was mixed up I
[39:15] was turned all around but I needed my
[39:17] heart to be turned yes sir and I'm
[39:21] stepping into a vision a matter what
[39:24] Malachi wrote about me years ago and I
[39:27] pray that through the preaching of the
[39:30] word somebody else will step into
[39:34] Oh glory to God a man so I want to read
[39:38] here from Malachi chapter 4 a man
[39:43] hallelujah glory to God a man Malachi
[39:48] chapter 4 verse 5 and verse 6 and also
[39:53] revelation 10 and verse 7 it says here
[39:56] behold I will send you Elijah the
[40:02] Prophet before the coming of the Great
[40:05] and dreadful day of the Lord hallelujah
[40:09] I just I just love that you know when
[40:13] Elijah he called he said no rain it was
[40:18] a drought in the land and they say
[40:20] they're gonna be any rain until I called
[40:22] for it and and even when he spoke these
[40:25] words it impacted him because the river
[40:27] that he was getting water from that
[40:31] river dried up so God told him say now I
[40:33] got a I got a place for you to go and
[40:36] there's a woman that's gonna sustain you
[40:38] once you once you get there she's gonna
[40:40] sustain you now and he showed her a
[40:42] vision of this woman and everything and
[40:44] I should have two sticks and you know
[40:46] and how she be kind of talking about her
[40:48] condition and you know how bad things
[40:50] were said but that's gonna be the woman
[40:52] that I told us to stange and what caused
[40:54] that woman to look at the situation look
[40:57] different she said he's saying give me a
[40:58] drink of water say I'll go get you some
[41:00] water they said why are you on the way
[41:02] would you bake me a cake it's now hold
[41:04] on no look you don't cross the line
[41:07] I'm get ready to make my last cake for
[41:10] my son and for myself and we gonna die I
[41:12] give me the water but the cake he said
[41:14] no no go bake it for you you serve em
[41:17] for yourself
[41:17] but flat faithful oh that was yes soon
[41:21] as she heard thus saith the Lord she
[41:23] knew the drop could could could couldn't
[41:25] keep it from from coming forward right
[41:27] she knew she knew things was gonna
[41:29] change soon as she heard I said look but
[41:31] I want you to understand he was only
[41:32] said oh so can I read this again behold
[41:42] I see
[41:44] me well I said you Elijah the Prophet
[41:52] before the coming of the Great and
[41:57] dreadful day of the Lord so you have to
[42:00] be able to see yourself in Scripture who
[42:03] is this Elijah that God is sending me
[42:07] all right and he shall turn the heart of
[42:12] the father's to the children and the
[42:14] heart of the children to their fathers
[42:15] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[42:18] curse amen the Lord had a blessing to
[42:20] the reading of that let's go to
[42:21] Revelation 10 a man in verse 7 glory
[42:27] glory these are scriptures and notice
[42:29] I'm reading from Malachi if you notice
[42:32] in your Bible that was the very last
[42:34] verse of the Old Testament very last
[42:39] verse God put something in there in the
[42:42] Old Testament so that we could we can
[42:44] kind of catch it and another thing you
[42:46] got to kind of understand about that
[42:48] before Jesus came there was no New
[42:52] Testament all they had was the Old
[42:54] Testament that's all I mean the first
[42:56] four books of the gospel the New
[42:59] Testament it's read about the life of
[43:01] the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:02] right but before that there was only Old
[43:04] Testament so people hung everything what
[43:08] was written in the Old Testament her
[43:10] Amen hallelujah
[43:11] the Old Testament prophesied of Christ's
[43:14] coming a man the Old Testament
[43:16] prophesied of different Kings that would
[43:19] come amen the Old Testament prophesied
[43:21] that he likely would come before the
[43:23] coming of the Great and dreadful day of
[43:25] the Lord so we thank God for that but
[43:27] now over in the New Testament last book
[43:29] of the Bible again God puts something in
[43:32] Scripture that would help us look at
[43:34] this revelation 10 7 says but in the
[43:36] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[43:40] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[43:44] of God should be finished as he hath
[43:47] declared to his servants the prophets a
[43:51] man this is a promise that God said he
[43:54] would do the mystery of God
[43:56] we finished in this time as you have
[43:58] just declared to his servants the
[44:01] prophets so let's pray over the word of
[44:03] the Lord amen as we just prepare to go
[44:06] into a little thought your father we
[44:07] just thank you a man for the word we
[44:09] thank you for scripture that we can read
[44:11] we trust our God that the Holy Spirit
[44:13] would take control of our thoughts and
[44:15] got you or speak to you people right
[44:17] where they are we have a responsibility
[44:19] to bring truth the Bible says that we
[44:21] shall know the truth and the truth will
[44:23] make us free so speak to our hearts God
[44:25] today in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[44:30] praise the Lord you can be seated I want
[44:34] to just read a quote here out of spoken
[44:37] words original seed just to open us up
[44:39] and we're actually gonna grab our title
[44:42] from this particular quote so let's just
[44:46] read this just to open things up it says
[44:50] in and and as as I'm reading this I need
[44:54] to again bring to our attention that we
[44:58] have been on a journey through step into
[45:02] the vision that that's been that's been
[45:04] the journey that we started out this
[45:06] year and this is all birth from you know
[45:09] what is this great vision that that God
[45:13] has for us because 2020 you know a year
[45:16] of vision people would say perfect
[45:19] vision or you know a complete vision or
[45:22] whatever it is but you know a lot of
[45:25] people have identified this year's a
[45:27] year of their vision and and want to see
[45:29] visions come to pass or dreams that they
[45:31] might have expectations that they might
[45:33] set they want to see it and it's
[45:35] perfectly fine that we establish
[45:38] ourselves natural goals and objectives I
[45:41] think there's nothing wrong with that I
[45:42] think that's real good but I had to go a
[45:45] little deeper than just the natural goal
[45:47] for myself I say Lord what is your
[45:50] vision a man for me that I need to step
[45:54] into not only just for me but what is
[45:56] your vision for the church that we need
[45:59] to step into and God just begin to
[46:01] quicken to my spirit amen this this
[46:04] message that he gave his prophet that
[46:06] angel Lord came to the prophet and said
[46:07] pick up your pen and write
[46:09] and and as he was writing he was
[46:11] actually say this is a message to the
[46:13] church you know this this was a message
[46:15] to believers and and so so when I start
[46:18] looking at it here angel is telling the
[46:21] Prophet write these things down and he
[46:23] wrote it on me put inside a book in and
[46:25] out what I'm doing is just preaching
[46:27] portions of that I'm going kind of like
[46:29] almost paragraph by paragraph and
[46:31] grabbing inspiration and bringing it to
[46:34] the church because I want us to be
[46:35] locked into this vision that God has for
[46:38] us and we're stepping into that we're
[46:40] stepping into that so this this is the
[46:43] next portion you have to follow us
[46:46] throughout the whole year to get the
[46:47] whole thing that I'm that I'm bringing
[46:49] but I'll just you know if you don't do
[46:51] that just just take what you can today
[46:53] and we'll just keep building on that if
[46:55] that's all right so here in the message
[46:57] spoken word is the original seed part to
[46:59] the Prophet makes a statement like John
[47:03] the Baptist's Christ faithful forerunner
[47:08] the anointed prophet no school of his
[47:11] father no school of Pharisee no
[47:15] denomination can call him from the
[47:18] wilderness where God has sent him until
[47:21] he heard the voice of God the Messiah is
[47:24] at hand
[47:25] are you listening spiritual mind what
[47:29] more could I say here I'm skipping
[47:32] something here now so this is the
[47:34] Prophet actually a man giving us a
[47:37] portion of what the angel was telling
[47:40] him it says like John the Baptist Christ
[47:43] faithful forerunner a man and that's
[47:46] going to be our title today Christ
[47:48] faithful forerunner he says I like John
[47:52] the Baptist Christ faithful forerunner
[47:55] the anointed prophet a man no school of
[48:00] his father no school of Pharisee no
[48:04] denomination could call him from the
[48:06] willness where God has sent him nice and
[48:08] he could go says until he heard the
[48:10] voice of God Amen the Messiah is that
[48:14] him since are you listening
[48:15] spiritual mind now I was reading this
[48:18] and I don't
[48:19] think I actually caught this until I
[48:20] stood here this morning and just read
[48:22] the cou he says are you listening
[48:25] spiritual mind because here God you say
[48:29] prophets they meant to write this down
[48:43] glory to God glory to God like turn the
[49:41] Baptist's Christ's feet for forerunner
[49:43] the anointed prophet no school of his
[49:45] father no school of the Pharisee no
[49:47] denomination can call him from the
[49:49] wilderness where God has sent him until
[49:51] he heard the voice of God the Messiah's
[49:54] hand are you listening spiritual mine
[49:57] what more can I say here I'm skipping
[49:59] something here now he could have skipped
[50:01] it then because the people couldn't
[50:02] receive it but we can receive it today
[50:04] right amen when he said behold I send
[50:07] you he's talking to me
[50:09] glory to God so I can receive Elijah the
[50:12] prophet a man oh let's go you know just
[50:18] that scripture alone in Malachi 4 it
[50:21] speaks of two comings of Elijah one of
[50:25] them was actually in the Ministry of
[50:27] John the Baptist well I mean eat the
[50:29] scripture plainly tells us
[50:31] it was it was John the Baptist
[50:33] fulfilling that maybe we ought to just
[50:34] read that real quick I think it's going
[50:37] to be out of Luke chapter one a man
[50:40] hallelujah we gotta take time and just
[50:44] look at the Word of God for what it is
[50:45] so we know why we believe what we
[50:47] believe a man I'm not just quoting
[50:50] things just to quote things I'm
[50:52] believing this because it's in the word
[50:54] Amen Luke chapter one in verse verse 15
[51:01] Oh glory to God amen it says for ye
[51:05] shall be great in the sight of the Lord
[51:08] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[51:11] drink now this is talking about John the
[51:13] Baptist you know John the Baptist as the
[51:17] angel Gabriel went and told his father
[51:19] what was given to happen and man
[51:21] Zechariah began to disbelieve this this
[51:25] this could be possible
[51:26] his wife had never been pregnant before
[51:28] him here here was old and aged and like
[51:31] how in the world could this happen but
[51:33] you know just because Zachariah
[51:34] disbelieved did not stop the promise
[51:37] from coming to pass and let me tell you
[51:39] something just because you disbelieve
[51:41] what God has written this word does not
[51:43] mean the word is not true Lord God you
[51:46] have you have you have a you have the
[51:49] choice to actually believe or not
[51:52] believe God make you believe this him he
[51:55] will present it to you and it's up to
[51:57] you to believe or not to believe hey man
[51:59] I want to tell you rather than just
[52:01] searching the internet Oh glory to God
[52:05] because even in even in Jesus day they
[52:08] did searching it's Laurie to God if they
[52:11] wanted to know who he was they did
[52:13] search and they did ask and they had
[52:14] questions and Jesus songs search the
[52:17] scripture
[52:27] to reveal to you what is true glory
[52:33] glory glory it since ye shall be great
[52:35] in the sight of the Lord and so drink
[52:38] neither wine nor strong drink and eat
[52:40] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even
[52:42] from his mother's womb and many of the
[52:45] children of Israel shall be turned so he
[52:48] turned to the Lord their God and he
[52:51] shall go before him in the spirit and
[52:53] power of Elijah to turn the hearts of
[52:57] the father's to the children so when you
[52:59] look at Malachi for the very first part
[53:02] of that John the Baptist is the one that
[53:04] reveals that to turn our hearts of the
[53:06] father's to the children to turn the
[53:34] hearts of the father's to the children
[53:36] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[53:38] just to make ready a people prepared for
[53:41] the Lord now that's just it's just it's
[53:43] in Scripture it's in Scripture and we're
[53:46] talking about Christ Christ's faithful
[53:49] forerunner now I want to just kind of
[53:50] stay with me I was just looking at this
[53:53] because that quote sent the anointed
[53:55] prophet John the Baptist a man worth
[53:59] Christ's faithful forerunner John the
[54:01] Baptist was one of Christ's faithful
[54:04] forerunner amen let me put it that way
[54:06] and let notice this amen
[54:09] it said that the quote said Christ
[54:11] faithful flight John the Baptist
[54:13] Bryant's faithful forerunner the
[54:15] anointed prophet now just kind of
[54:18] reflecting on that because you know
[54:19] being a person that reads the Bible I
[54:22] mean why would the angel tell the
[54:25] Prophet to pick up his pen and write and
[54:27] then I
[54:29] if I John as an anointed prophet in
[54:32] action another another instance of the
[54:35] same quote in the church age book will
[54:37] read it later he called him a mighty
[54:39] prophet a mighty prophet amen
[54:43] now I was just wondering about that and
[54:45] and I'll give you the answer I just want
[54:46] to kind of put this out here for
[54:49] everyone
[54:49] a man why would the angel describe John
[54:52] as an anointed prophet or a mighty
[54:55] prophet
[54:56] you know John never worked one miracle
[55:01] John never healed anybody right but he's
[55:05] identified by the angel the Lord as a
[55:08] mighty prophet a man as an anointed
[55:12] prophet another thing you need to know
[55:14] about John his ministry only lasted six
[55:16] months along but yeah he's identified by
[55:21] the angel as a mighty prophet what could
[55:24] a man doing six months that he would
[55:27] give the description from an angel last
[55:29] mighty or anointed hallelujah when I
[55:34] think about an ornate prophets amen I
[55:37] think about Moses woman or thing that
[55:40] was on Moses and the mighty miracles
[55:43] that he performed that to lead the
[55:45] children Israel out of Egypt that was
[55:48] truly an anointing amen when Moses was
[55:51] out of the wilderness with the children
[55:53] of Israel and they got thirsty and he
[55:54] stood up and he took his rod and struck
[55:56] the rock and water came from a rock that
[56:00] was an anointed he wasn't supposed to
[56:04] because Christ is not struck twice but
[56:07] he did a second time he struck the rock
[56:08] your water came out even when God did
[56:11] tell him I do it what an anointing o
[56:13] Moses
[56:14] I think about Elisha amen we turned mine
[56:18] anointed prophets I think about the
[56:20] prophet Elijah he was so annoying he
[56:22] gave that woman a man her a promise of
[56:25] her barrel not going empty no oil not
[56:28] running dry because she heard thus saith
[56:30] the Lord and amen because of her
[56:32] obedience
[56:33] she received a me
[56:34] we saw the same Elijah raise the dead
[56:37] we started say me to call down fire fire
[57:28] come down and consume you and your fifty
[57:31] fire come down consume the first fifty
[57:33] then the King say sitting up set up
[57:35] another liter system and say go up and
[57:37] tell that prophet I said come down now
[57:40] say no no you say you say uh the guys
[57:43] say that's Robert
[57:44] it's the Prophet King said come down now
[57:46] he say if I am a man of God let fire
[57:49] come down and consume you and your fifty
[57:51] fire come down from heaven spoken word
[57:54] destroyed him are you talk about an
[57:56] anointed don't play with God don't play
[57:59] with an anointed prophet the King say I
[58:03] ain't satisfied I want him to come down
[58:04] now see a plague has struck this King a
[58:08] plague was on his King and he had a
[58:10] diseased in his feet and he went to coax
[58:12] out some false God what was gonna happen
[58:14] so so the prophet interrupted the
[58:16] journey and say go tell him he gonna die
[58:18] say is there not a God in Israel what
[58:22] you running out to these false cross way
[58:27] well why are you going up to some of
[58:29] these phenomenal like that say you say
[58:46] Seiko tell them I said come down this
[58:48] third guy say look now I tell you what I
[58:50] don't see any other ones go down they
[58:52] make it back to the camp say I'm gonna
[58:53] prove to a little different thing
[58:55] yeah I'm going imma go up and I'm gonna
[58:56] beat you up get your command he saved my
[58:58] profit please spare me and my men we
[59:02] want to go back home non-families we
[59:04] just asking you please would you come
[59:06] down and see the king man said God said
[59:09] go go with him because of his approach
[59:11] prophet then he was able to get a man a
[59:15] response from the prophets hallelujah
[59:18] but he was not moved
[59:20] amen by what the King said he was only
[59:23] moved by thus saith the Lord that was an
[59:26] anointed prophet I thought about
[59:28] Jeremiah a man when we were looking at
[59:31] an orchard prophets Jeremiah prophesied
[59:34] to nations Jeremiah also told the
[59:37] children of Israel that their bondage
[59:39] were only last for 70 years
[59:41] hallelujah I love that statement that
[59:43] their bondage will only last for seventy
[59:46] years I want to tell you the Lord sent
[59:48] its temporary bondage some of your loved
[59:51] ones are in what we call temporary bonds

[1:04:26] miracle the angel said he was anointed
[1:04:30] the angel call him a mighty prophet I
[1:04:37] know many y'all already know the answer
[1:04:40] to that but let me just keep you in
[1:04:42] suspense hallelujah
[1:04:45] let's go back and look at this our title
[1:04:48] is Christ faithful forerunner now I
[1:04:53] looked at that word for run a forerunner
[1:04:56] and just one to kind of find out you
[1:04:58] know what what is what is the what is
[1:05:00] the Greek lexicon saying about this one
[1:05:02] and I and I pulled it up and it said a
[1:05:05] forerunner is one who is sent before to
[1:05:09] take observations or act as a spy a
[1:05:13] scout a light armed soldier one who
[1:05:18] comes in advance to a place where the
[1:05:20] rest are to follow a man so had these
[1:05:23] multiple definitions and and as I
[1:05:26] thought about this definition of a 4-run
[1:05:28] that someone sent before to take
[1:05:30] observations or act as a spy or scout I
[1:05:33] couldn't help but think about the 12
[1:05:35] spies a man of Israel they were sitting
[1:05:39] to go in and look
[1:05:40] the land a man and come back with report
[1:05:43] they were actually for running
[1:05:44] hallelujah because this this land is
[1:05:47] promised land that God had given the
[1:05:49] children of Israel years before they
[1:05:52] actually came a man even on the scene
[1:05:55] God had already prophesied to Abraham
[1:05:58] that he was going to give his people a
[1:06:00] promised land
[1:06:00] now when the children Israel rose up
[1:06:03] came from underneath the bondage on
[1:06:05] their way into the Promised Land do you
[1:06:07] realize that they had stepped into a
[1:06:09] vision of what God had told him that
[1:06:13] they were not supposed to stand Egypt
[1:06:15] that they were gonna come out and go to
[1:06:16] a promised land hallelujah you know when
[1:06:20] God called Israel out of Egypt that was
[1:06:23] considered an exodus hey man and when
[1:06:27] God called us out our denominational
[1:06:29] churches guess what happened we went
[1:06:30] into another Exodus but there's a third
[1:06:34] one Amen that's waiting for us and
[1:06:36] that's us coming out of this world and
[1:06:38] going into a rapture and awaiting us all
[1:06:44] right hallelujah
[1:06:45] all right listen those 12 spies winning
[1:06:49] they scouted the land and and they
[1:06:50] brought back a report hallelujah and an
[1:06:54] antenna despised just begin you know
[1:06:56] talk about the good things they're
[1:06:58] carrying the grapes of the land and
[1:07:00] they're showing the people how
[1:07:02] prosperous the land is
[1:07:03] but yet they're also giving a negative
[1:07:05] report hallelujah but there were two in
[1:07:09] the midst of the twelve that saw
[1:07:11] something different they looked at the
[1:07:13] Giants in the land they looked at all
[1:07:15] the problems they hallelujah they also
[1:07:18] looked at some of the websites
[1:07:21] Lauria some of the descriptions on the
[1:07:23] land they looked at it but they also
[1:07:26] searched the scripture they said God
[1:07:30] made us a promise and if God is for us
[1:07:33] and who can be against us with the word
[1:07:39] of God and those that go in and see the
[1:07:44] promise they had to wait 40 years but
[1:07:46] they because of their we know in their
[1:08:08] their stories of the Lord well who is
[1:08:38] this prophet and God is sending me and
[1:08:40] this is why I always make this comment
[1:08:42] if it wasn't where Miriam Brenham cuz
[1:08:45] the script that scripture that I read in
[1:08:47] Malachi 4 was written to me hallelujah
[1:08:50] if it wasn't william brennan you better
[1:08:52] give me somebody because god told me
[1:08:54] that he was sending lots of the prophet
[1:08:56] yes sir all right all right all right
[1:09:00] all right I told you hey man let's go
[1:09:03] back and look at this thing from a
[1:09:04] scriptural standpoint those twelve spies
[1:09:06] were scouting it out brought back an
[1:09:09] evil report but Joshua and Caleb brought
[1:09:11] a good reports that we're more than able
[1:09:13] to take the land don't worry about the
[1:09:15] the the the Giants and look we might we
[1:09:19] not grasshoppers that's what that's what
[1:09:21] the children Israel thought is they were
[1:09:22] guys huh but Josh said we have more than
[1:09:24] over we're more than able to overcome
[1:09:26] them Caleb said we're more than it's how
[1:09:28] you look at yourself
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:32] you ain't even hit me because
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:59] he was representing God gathered a
[1:12:09] missive is slinging me just one rock
[1:12:11] took Goliath down yes Oh God need us
[1:12:14] just one rock come on hallelujah stop
[1:12:20] seeing yourself defeated I mean even if
[1:12:23] you got symptoms you can come out of
[1:12:25] them
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:28] let's defeat it see yourself victorious
[1:12:31] speak the Word of God a key word for
[1:12:34] word hallelujah DS Amen this this uh
[1:12:37] forerunner they managed want someone who
[1:12:40] sit before to take observation to act as
[1:12:43] a spy or Scout and here we got the
[1:12:48] twelve spies unfortunately the majority
[1:12:51] of the spots ten of them brought back
[1:12:53] can even reported a promised land and
[1:12:55] that evil report caused an entire
[1:12:58] generation to miss their blessing
[1:13:01] because they believed an evil report
[1:13:04] rather than believing the Word of God I
[1:13:07] want to say this again amen there's
[1:13:10] people that research this stuff on the
[1:13:12] internet and they are getting an evil
[1:13:15] report and by you looking at the evil
[1:13:19] report you are missing your blessing
[1:13:24] you'll find yourself wandering around
[1:13:26] from church to church Israel's own
[1:13:31] attorney was going from one city to the
[1:13:33] next city
[1:13:33] and what happens here's they go from
[1:13:35] church to church and they say we found
[1:13:37] the word we're free we got the word but
[1:13:40] you can't stay satisfied in that church
[1:13:41] right amen blessed be the name of glory
[1:13:46] to God I'm talk about going from one
[1:13:47] denominations in the next denomination
[1:13:49] now you know if me if I had to move
[1:13:52] right if God took me and say you got to
[1:13:56] leave West Palm Beach you got to move or
[1:13:57] whatever I can guarantee what I'm
[1:13:59] looking for wherever I'm going is
[1:14:01] another message just moving just to be
[1:14:09] moving we go you saw a house where you
[1:14:21] said be wrong is there a church there
[1:14:24] and is that the same church also I think
[1:14:46] of a men is forerunner someone said
[1:14:49] before to take observation after spy I
[1:14:51] think about the two spies that rehab
[1:14:54] received a man Rahab the harlot see two
[1:14:57] spies into the home and because of her
[1:15:00] receiving the message from the spies
[1:15:03] she was given a token for her beat and
[1:15:08] that talk about if you just this
[1:15:10] business this car that you've let out
[1:15:12] your window to let us down by keep that
[1:15:14] cord hanging out the window and when we
[1:15:17] come in to take the land because rehab
[1:15:19] knew that and all the people of Jericho
[1:15:22] knew that the land was gonna be given to
[1:15:24] Israel they they were just waiting on
[1:15:25] the time she said we're afraid of y'all
[1:15:27] coming here say but please give me a
[1:15:29] token spare me and my family they say
[1:15:34] we'll spare you and your family but all
[1:15:36] you got to do is get your family in the
[1:15:39] house
[1:15:40] yo family can be on the streets top out
[1:15:43] they know ray anybody can say that I
[1:15:53] used to work with the Lord I know that's
[1:16:24] Bo but that's what Jesus was telling
[1:16:26] them amen back there in the book of John
[1:16:28] he got old in the book of john and i'm
[1:16:31] mateus we get closer and closer to the
[1:16:33] coming of the lord you gonna hear that
[1:16:34] gospel get both because we be trying to
[1:16:39] just you know work with people's
[1:16:40] feelings trying to work with a emotions
[1:16:43] but God ain't thinking about your
[1:16:44] emotions he gave me promise do you
[1:16:47] believe I do don't you believe right all
[1:16:49] right we come with coming further
[1:16:53] hallelujah live them dim sum spies that
[1:16:56] she received a men they were Scouts they
[1:16:59] were spies they were taking observation
[1:17:01] they were observing how the people were
[1:17:03] feeling they knew the time it come for
[1:17:05] them to go in and take the land God gave
[1:17:08] them a strategy to marching around the
[1:17:09] walls and as they marched around the
[1:17:11] walls for six days and on the seventh
[1:17:13] day they march seven times but at the
[1:17:15] end of that seven times they had to be
[1:17:17] still glory to God and they couldn't say
[1:17:20] a word during the time of his marching
[1:17:21] but then finally John said now it's time
[1:17:23] to let out a great shout and when they
[1:17:26] let out the great shout the walls came
[1:17:28] tumbling down all this was because of
[1:17:30] two spies giving a good report a man
[1:17:34] when I think about somebody being a
[1:17:37] forerunner sent before to take
[1:17:39] observation as an act as a spy or spout
[1:17:44] I also thought about brother Branham
[1:17:46] having the ability to scout out and tell
[1:17:50] us what heaven was like
[1:17:53] but he also scouted out and you can tell
[1:17:57] us what Hale was like yes so so let me
[1:18:00] just make this very clear I'm gonna take
[1:18:03] a prophetic definition of what heaven is
[1:18:06] like
[1:18:07] and I'ma take a prophetic experience and
[1:18:09] definition of where hair looks like
[1:18:11] there's many people I mean it's all over
[1:18:14] the internet so I went to heaven it was
[1:18:18] like a big park but if all children
[1:19:02] ain't at home eating momma's mine is
[1:19:08] wondering if one guy weren't one child
[1:19:10] is missing a man glory to God so when we
[1:19:14] get to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:19:16] i'ma want to see all her children glory
[1:19:18] glory glory glory somehow someway
[1:19:20] majestic fingers will unravel the knots
[1:19:23] and we're gonna see how we got to see
[1:19:25] our promises coming to pass hey I say
[1:19:28] it's a temporary bondage man it's
[1:19:31] temporary bondage the devil has limits
[1:19:33] all right glory to God so here this
[1:19:36] other definition is a forerunner is one
[1:19:39] who comes in advanced to a place where
[1:19:42] the rest will follow and I love this a
[1:19:45] man one who comes in advance to a place
[1:19:47] where the rest will follow now I want to
[1:19:50] read a scripture in here a man because
[1:19:52] as a forerunner if you're running a man
[1:19:55] with the message you're coming to a
[1:19:57] place where the rest will follow you
[1:19:59] coming you got to have a message that
[1:20:01] you're given the people John the Baptist
[1:20:02] had a message that he was giving the
[1:20:03] people brother Branham had a
[1:20:05] since that he was given the people they
[1:20:07] were both Christ's faithful forerunners
[1:20:09] a man now so I want to just kind of hit
[1:20:13] a scripture out of our second Samuel 18
[1:20:16] and verse 19 was down to verse 19 if you
[1:20:19] were a forerunner if you will elect it
[1:20:22] to be a forerunner you had to have a
[1:20:24] message amen glory to God you had to
[1:20:28] have something to say glory to God even
[1:20:31] if you are a forerunner you you let me
[1:20:34] let me make that very clear if God has
[1:20:37] called you to be a forerunner you have
[1:20:39] to have a message with something to say
[1:20:46] so yeah I mean we got other ministries
[1:20:49] that came on the scene during the same
[1:20:51] time brother Branham is here Billy
[1:20:53] Graham wonderful ministry all Roberts
[1:20:56] wonderful ministry but we're talking
[1:20:58] about the message that the man would
[1:21:01] have what is the message that they have
[1:21:03] to say hallelujah glory glory let's look
[1:21:07] at this a man in 2nd Samuel 18 and we'll
[1:21:12] start at verse 19 thank you Jesus this
[1:21:16] man was a forerunner or he warned it to
[1:21:19] be a forerunner thank you Jesus verse 19
[1:21:25] second Samuel 18 and it says this
[1:21:34] at 19 all right then said ah Hamas the
[1:21:40] son of Zadok

[1:21:47] enemies I said I want to go tell the
[1:21:49] King what has happened to his enemy hey

[1:21:56] risen up against David and now Absalom
[1:21:59] is dead but this man ah he mobs he
[1:22:02] realizes that something has happened but
[1:22:05] I can tell you before we get to the end
[1:22:06] this man wants to run but he has no
[1:22:09] message hallelujah and we got many
[1:22:13] people running today but you don't have
[1:22:15] a message oh we want to know the message

[1:22:37] shalt not bear tidings this day but thou
[1:22:40] shalt bear tidings but thou shalt bear
[1:22:42] tidings another day but this day thou
[1:22:44] shalt bear no time is because the king's
[1:22:46] son is dead it says then said joy after

[1:31:13] just put this way the message is
[1:31:15] actually written in between the lines
[1:31:20] now you say it's the brother Jack what'd
[1:31:22] you mean by that what happened in the
[1:31:24] Garden of Eden if you want to really
[1:31:25] understand you have to read between the
[1:31:27] lines glory to God and otherwise you'll
[1:31:32] get stuck hallelujah you still be
[1:31:35] thinking some apple or apricot or
[1:31:37] something no no no no no no no no
[1:31:39] adultery took place in the garden folk
[1:31:41] got pregnant hey man you better read
[1:31:45] between the lines and even though the
[1:31:48] Bible say that Eve got a man from the
[1:31:49] Lord that don't stop right there guess
[1:31:52] it's brother branham said either I was
[1:31:54] listening to a tape I mean a video last

[1:32:07] verse is that 31 I'm coming back to it
[1:32:09] but he said he said he has some
[1:32:11] questions have been he sought an angel
[1:32:13] the Lord moving in brother branham's
[1:32:14] ministry but he just is like man this
[1:32:16] don't seem right the see God manifesting
[1:32:19] this way himself this way but I'm here

[1:33:58] all these people speaking in tongues and
[1:34:00] interpreting and prophesy and doing all

[1:34:23] that I know I supposed to be listening
[1:34:24] to the message but I heard your message
[1:34:26] on that and then he said he realized
[1:34:30] brother Branham had not even preached
[1:34:32] that message it was five years before
[1:34:36] years later that brother Branham
[1:34:39] preached the message can I tell you how
[1:34:42] something about this message here I had
[1:34:44] this message in my notes
[1:34:47] 2018 waiting for the inspiration to come
[1:34:51] and preach it and we when we struck that
[1:34:54] quote and that I read to y'all in this
[1:34:56] angels message to the church that's when
[1:35:00] I knew it's time to bring forth this
[1:35:01] message hallelujah God is still God you
[1:35:11] gotta have something to tell people
[1:35:12] brother Branham said they say the angel
[1:35:14] said you have these three questions he
[1:35:15] said to explain the questions and one of
[1:35:17] them about the circus seat and he said
[1:35:19] he said the Bible say the Bible say that
[1:35:22] that she had a a child from the Lord for
[1:35:25] the brim said yes all children come from
[1:35:28] the Lord I don't care if it's from the
[1:35:30] worst relationship if it's from a momma
[1:35:34] that got pregnant without being married
[1:35:36] that child is still coming from the Lord
[1:35:39] amen we say all children come from the
[1:35:44] Lord God got to be involved in that
[1:35:46] birth in order for that child to get
[1:35:47] here your birth is a miracle your birth
[1:35:52] is a miracle the action one place
[1:35:55] brother Branham say you know your
[1:35:56] natural birth is more of a mystery
[1:36:00] then Mary's birth given birth to Christ
[1:36:04] all right so let's look at this let's
[1:36:07] keep reading hey man I don't know if I'm
[1:36:10] gonna make it to where I wanted to be
[1:36:11] how just have to cut off but I knew it's
[1:36:13] gonna be part 1 and part 2 to this cushy
[1:36:17] I'm talking about cushy
[1:36:22] well Chris you know maybe let's go back
[1:36:24] to the verse before that verse 30
[1:36:26] it's Christian a Christian this was a
[1:36:30] Hamas that came first and King said to
[1:36:32] him turn aside and stand here and and he
[1:36:34] turned aside and stood still and then
[1:36:37] verse 31 the whole crew she came and
[1:36:41] because she said tied is my lord the
[1:36:42] king for the lord hath avenged ii this
[1:36:44] day for all them that rose up against
[1:36:46] thee and the king said in a cushy is the
[1:36:49] young man Absalom safe and Christian sir
[1:36:55] the enemies of my lord the king and all
[1:36:58] that rise against thee to do the hurt be
[1:37:02] as that young man is cuz she had a
[1:37:06] message coz she could say something
[1:37:08] because she wasn't looking at just a
[1:37:10] pile of rocks and can identify why the
[1:37:13] rocks were there could she say the rocks
[1:37:16] was here because they buried Absalom
[1:37:18] that's what he saw with his eyes
[1:37:21] hallelujah glory glory glory glory verse
[1:37:25] 33 says in the King was much moved and
[1:37:27] went up to the Chamber's over the gate
[1:37:29] and wept and as he went thus he said oh
[1:37:32] my son Absalom and my son my son Absalom
[1:37:36] what God I had died for thee o Absalom
[1:37:38] my son my son cuz she had a message so
[1:37:43] we don't want just people running we
[1:37:45] want somebody running with a message
[1:37:47] John the Baptist had a message now I
[1:37:50] want to try to get to that point if I
[1:37:52] can maybe I will just slip back over
[1:37:56] there I'll skip this other part here and
[1:37:58] come back to this John the Baptist and
[1:38:04] we'll just finish it here no pray bring
[1:38:07] the other part out next week amen but
[1:38:09] here I want to repeat the quote out of
[1:38:12] spoken words original Steve says like
[1:38:15] John the Baptist Christ faithful
[1:38:18] forerunner the anointed prophet no
[1:38:23] school of his father no school of
[1:38:26] Pharisee no denomination could call him
[1:38:29] from the wilderness where God had sent
[1:38:32] him amen that ought to let you know if
[1:38:35] it's coming
[1:38:35] of educational school is probably not
[1:38:38] from God God dealt
[1:38:40] I mean God God used the man John the
[1:38:42] Baptist that had no education he used
[1:38:44] him also William Branham a man with a
[1:38:47] very limited education settled great
[1:38:50] education puts and notice our God did
[1:38:52] this set of great education
[1:38:54] seven letters in his first name seven
[1:38:58] letters in his middle name seven letters
[1:39:01] in his last name allowed him to go seven
[1:39:04] times around the world preaching the
[1:39:06] gospel 777 and God is a man completed in
[1:39:12] sevens
[1:39:14] hallelujah don't don't don't don't don't
[1:39:16] don't don't don't don't miss this don't
[1:39:18] miss this watch God and his numbers
[1:39:20] right so so he says like John the
[1:39:23] Baptist Christ faithful forerunner the
[1:39:25] anointed prophet no school of his father
[1:39:28] no school of affair of a Pharisee no
[1:39:32] denomination could call him from the
[1:39:33] wilderness where God has sent him until
[1:39:35] he heard the voice of God the Messiah is
[1:39:37] at hand
[1:39:37] are you listening spiritual mind what
[1:39:40] more could I say here I'm skipping
[1:39:42] something here now now John the Baptist
[1:39:47] when we when we looked at him in Malachi
[1:39:50] Ford I also read Saint Luke one but we
[1:39:54] can look at a couple other scriptures
[1:39:55] that spoke of his ministry amen and and
[1:39:59] we're gonna try to try to bring this
[1:40:01] bring this close to home here Isaiah 40
[1:40:04] a man verse three through five John the
[1:40:07] Baptist was fulfilling Scripture when
[1:40:09] when John the Baptist came on the scene
[1:40:12] if I could just a man I'll remind you if
[1:40:15] a scripture was spoken of about him
[1:40:17] before he got here when he came on the
[1:40:19] scene he was stepping into into the
[1:40:21] vision of that scripture hallelujah if
[1:40:24] the scripture was written before he got
[1:40:26] here John the Baptist became the
[1:40:28] manifestation of the scripture glory
[1:40:31] let's read I was there 40 verse 3
[1:40:33] through 5 says the voice of him that
[1:40:36] crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the
[1:40:40] way of the Lord make straight in the
[1:40:42] desert a highway for our God every
[1:40:45] Valley shall be exalted and every
[1:40:48] mountain and Hill shall be made low and
[1:40:50] the crew kit shall be made straight and
[1:40:52] the rough places plane and the glory of
[1:40:55] the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
[1:40:57] shall see it together for the mouth of
[1:41:00] the Lord has spoken
[1:41:01] Isaiah is prophesying of the ministry of
[1:41:05] John the Baptist
[1:41:06] amen let's look at Malachi chapter 3
[1:41:09] first one a man these are scriptures
[1:41:12] that are written about John the Baptist
[1:41:14] Malachi chapter 3 verse 1 we already
[1:41:17] read Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 now
[1:41:20] we got amen two other scriptures the
[1:41:22] Bible say a man out of the word of two
[1:41:25] or three let every word be a step of two
[1:41:28] or three witnesses let every word be
[1:41:30] established I'm giving you scripture to
[1:41:33] support that's why I say don't just
[1:41:35] search the internet search the scripture
[1:41:39] hallelujah
[1:41:40] Malachi 3:1 says behold I will send my
[1:41:43] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:41:45] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[1:41:48] shall suddenly come to his temple even
[1:41:51] the messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:41:53] delight in but who he shall come saith
[1:41:56] the Lord of Hosts turn the Baptist when
[1:41:59] he's coming on the scene and stepping
[1:42:01] into the vision of Elijah amen if I say
[1:42:05] I should say and he's also stepping into
[1:42:07] the vision of Malachi hallelujah both of
[1:42:13] their prophets he spoke of the same man
[1:42:15] now in the New Testament let's pick it
[1:42:19] up in mark chapter one verse one through
[1:42:23] eight
[1:42:23] oh I love this I said all these
[1:42:27] different prophets that were anointed
[1:42:29] Elijah Elisha Jeremiah
[1:42:33] Moses Isaiah Daniel so many I mean
[1:42:36] absolutely anointed prophets of God but
[1:42:41] the angel identifies John the Baptist as
[1:42:44] a mighty prophet a man as an anointed
[1:42:47] prophet one that never worked a miracle
[1:42:49] one day in his life
[1:42:51] but yet he's considered anointed he's
[1:42:53] considered mighty let's look at this in
[1:42:56] mark one a man starting at verse 1 glory
[1:43:01] Holly
[1:43:04] says the beginning of the gospel of
[1:43:07] Jesus Christ the Son of God as it is
[1:43:11] written in the prophets Marcus taking
[1:43:15] them back to the world taking them back
[1:43:17] to the Old Testament they didn't they
[1:43:20] didn't have a New Testament at the time
[1:43:21] that Mark was writing this right but my
[1:43:23] taking up mark taking them back to the
[1:43:25] Old Testament search the Scriptures a
[1:43:28] man not just take what anybody said
[1:43:31] search the scriptures it says as it is
[1:43:33] written in the prophets behold I send my
[1:43:36] messenger before thy face which shall
[1:43:38] prepare thy prepare thy way before thee
[1:43:41] right
[1:43:42] it says the voice of one crying in the
[1:43:44] wilderness preparing you the way of the
[1:43:46] Lord make his paths straight here mark
[1:43:48] identifies both what Isaiah said and
[1:43:51] what Malachi said glory to God he says
[1:43:54] John did baptize in the wilderness and
[1:43:58] preached the baptism of repentance for
[1:44:00] the remission of sins and there went out
[1:44:02] unto him all the land of Judea and they
[1:44:06] of Jerusalem and we're all baptized of
[1:44:08] him in the river of Jordan confessing
[1:44:11] their sins and John was clothed with
[1:44:13] camel's hair looked like a wild man and
[1:44:15] with a girl of a skin about his Lawrence
[1:44:18] and he did eat locusts and wild honey
[1:44:20] this don't sound much like the Prophet
[1:44:22] that's fulfilling the Word of God but
[1:44:24] yet he was since and preaching saying
[1:44:27] there cometh one mightier than I after
[1:44:30] me that latches that the latchet of
[1:44:32] whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop
[1:44:34] down and unloosed I like this journalist
[1:44:37] not bringing the people to his ministry
[1:44:39] John is actually important to people to
[1:44:41] a greater ministry can I tell you
[1:44:42] something brother Branham did not bring
[1:44:45] us to his ministry he was always
[1:44:47] pointing us to a greater ministry and
[1:44:49] that is the Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:51] Christ recently I was asked the question
[1:44:56] I might as well say this while I'm here
[1:44:59] I'm going on I'm gonna keep reading some
[1:45:00] more I was actually questioned the
[1:45:02] brother Jack why do you have the picture
[1:45:04] of Christ hanging behind you in the
[1:45:05] pulpit I said because here this church
[1:45:10] we want the emphasis to be on Christ
[1:45:14] hallelujah and see what you got new
[1:45:17] people that don't know any better
[1:45:19] I think it's best to keep the emphasis
[1:45:20] on Christ they don't know any better
[1:45:26] right so I mean they gotta know about
[1:45:28] what we teach amen but the emphasis is
[1:45:31] always on Christ John the Baptist
[1:45:33] emphasis was on Christ brother branham's
[1:45:36] emphasis was on Christ he says if you
[1:45:38] read the Bible and every script if you
[1:45:40] don't see Christ he said go back and
[1:45:43] read it again alright let's keep reading
[1:45:46] mark 1:7 and preach preach Sam there
[1:45:50] cometh one night of the night after me
[1:45:52] the latchet of whose shoes I am not
[1:45:54] worried that it stooped down and unloose
[1:45:55] I indeed i baptize you with water but he
[1:45:58] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:01] let's go on it says and it came to pass
[1:46:05] in those days that Jesus came from
[1:46:07] Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of
[1:46:09] John and Jordan there's much to be said
[1:46:11] here and straightway coming up out of
[1:46:14] the water he saw the spirit the heavens
[1:46:17] open in the spirit like a dove
[1:46:18] descending upon him and there came a
[1:46:20] voice from heaven saying thou art my
[1:46:22] beloved son and whom I'm well pleased
[1:46:24] now the very purpose of Jesus coming to
[1:46:26] John to be baptized it was it was a show
[1:46:29] that before the sacrifice could be
[1:46:31] offered it had to be washed and the
[1:46:33] other thing that this shows us that the
[1:46:35] word which Jesus was the word the word
[1:46:39] always comes to the Prophet so here the
[1:46:43] word approached the Prophet in the
[1:46:45] Jordan and got baptized the sacrifice
[1:46:48] Amen was being washed before it could be
[1:46:50] offered that's why John that's why he
[1:46:53] when he said John suffered to be so
[1:46:55] that's why because the sacrifice had to
[1:46:57] be washed before it could be offered
[1:47:00] that's a mystery that people just
[1:47:02] couldn't they couldn't figure it out
[1:47:04] God sent that mystery to be revealed to
[1:47:06] us through a prophet amen let's go on a
[1:47:08] little further Oh actually that I'm
[1:47:14] supposed to stop there I'm I supposed to
[1:47:17] stop at verse 18 I don't know why I went
[1:47:18] further than that but but what I want
[1:47:20] you to see and I think I might have left
[1:47:22] something out here
[1:47:24] oh here's what I want to see and I'm
[1:47:27] gonna
[1:47:28] I'm gonna I got a quote here that I want
[1:47:29] to read to you why why would why would
[1:47:37] the angel called John anointed he never
[1:47:41] worked a miracle he never raised the
[1:47:43] debt he never healed the blind at eye he
[1:47:46] never did any of that his ministry on
[1:47:49] the last lasted six months but the angel
[1:47:51] said his ministry was mighty I missed
[1:47:54] the scripture I forgot to write it down
[1:47:56] but I know what it says jesus said that
[1:47:58] John's ministry was the greatest of all
[1:48:02] it was Matthew 11 let's read that
[1:48:07] Matthew 11 that's it that's it I want to
[1:48:11] tell you what Jesus said about John
[1:48:13] Matthew 11 why why will he be an
[1:48:18] anointed prophet never working a miracle
[1:48:21] look at Matthew 11 verse 2 look at this
[1:48:24] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:48:28] the works of Christ he sent two of his
[1:48:32] disciples and said unto Him art thou he
[1:48:34] that should come or do we look for
[1:48:36] another now here John is confused and
[1:48:39] the reason that he's a little confused
[1:48:41] because Jesus don't come out and just
[1:48:43] make it sense to me it so probably John
[1:48:45] knew that whoever he started out the
[1:48:47] Spirit is sending on and abiding that
[1:48:49] was the one that he was introducing that
[1:48:51] was that was effect but here when he
[1:48:52] gets into a little trial he starts to
[1:48:56] doubt a little bit and unfortunately
[1:48:58] many Saints have gone through trials and
[1:48:59] they begin to doubt a little bit God
[1:49:01] will bring you out to trial and notice
[1:49:04] this notice this notice watch what
[1:49:06] happened John says his disciples with
[1:49:08] this question the question is are out
[1:49:10] there he that should come or do we look
[1:49:12] for another and jesus answered and said
[1:49:14] unto them go and show John again those
[1:49:18] things which you do hear and see he
[1:49:20] didn't even tell John I mean you got to
[1:49:22] catch that on your own
[1:49:24] you got to catch who the Prophet is for
[1:49:27] this day he's not gonna just come out
[1:49:28] and just plainly tell it to you you
[1:49:30] gotta you got to read between the lines
[1:49:32] watch this
[1:49:34] says he said go go go and show John
[1:49:38] again those things which he do hear and
[1:49:40] see the
[1:49:41] I received their sight and the lame walk
[1:49:43] the lepers are cleansed and the Deaf
[1:49:45] hear the dead are raised up and the poor
[1:49:47] have the gospel preached to them and
[1:49:49] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:49:52] offended in me can we go a little
[1:49:54] further I want to read this and as they
[1:49:56] departed
[1:49:57] Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[1:49:59] concerning John what went ye out to sea
[1:50:03] unto the wilderness to see a reed shaken
[1:50:05] with the wind but what I went out for to
[1:50:09] see a man clothed in soft raiment behold
[1:50:11] a that wear soft clothing our kings
[1:50:14] houses but what we go out for to see a
[1:50:17] profit yay
[1:50:19] I say unto you and more than a prophet
[1:50:22] never worked a miracle a six-month
[1:50:26] ministry and Jesus Jesus describes
[1:50:31] John's ministry as not just the Prophet
[1:50:33] but more than a prophet hallelujah why
[1:50:39] does Jesus say it that way verse 10 for
[1:50:43] this is he who is written search the
[1:50:48] Scriptures but this is he of whom it is
[1:50:52] written behold I send my messenger
[1:50:55] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:50:58] way before thee verily I said to you
[1:51:01] among them that are born of women there
[1:51:03] has not risen a greater than john the
[1:51:07] baptist and he that is least in the
[1:51:10] kingdom of heaven is greater than he and
[1:51:14] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:51:16] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[1:51:17] violence and the violent take it by
[1:51:18] force for all the prophets and the law
[1:51:20] prophesied until John and it be receive
[1:51:23] it this is Elias which was for to come
[1:51:29] he that hath an ear to hear either half
[1:51:31] ears to hear let him hear Jesus says
[1:51:34] that there was no greater prophet than
[1:51:37] John the Baptist
[1:51:39] I want to tell you the reason why the
[1:51:41] angel call him mighty well the aim to
[1:51:44] call him anointed even though he never
[1:51:45] worked a miracle even though he he never
[1:51:48] did anything he even stopped the Sun he
[1:51:51] didn't do nothing like that but the
[1:51:53] reason that his ministry was the great
[1:51:55] the reason Jesus was sadist about him is
[1:51:57] because John's ministry was to introduce
[1:52:01] the Messiah now can I read a quote from
[1:52:14] the message influence this would be it
[1:52:18] this for this portion of this message
[1:52:22] there's a little bit more that I must
[1:52:25] say we haven't gotten there yet but I
[1:52:28] want you to understand because I've read
[1:52:30] you Malachi 4 I haven't even got to
[1:52:32] Revelation 10 but Malachi 4 talked about
[1:52:34] two comings of Elijah and we already
[1:52:38] proved by scripture that there was that
[1:52:40] John the Baptist fulfilled the turn of
[1:52:42] the hearts of the father's to the
[1:52:44] children but there was another Elijah
[1:52:46] that was coming to turn the hearts of
[1:52:48] the children to their fathers and that's
[1:52:50] the day in which we live right now our
[1:52:52] hearts are being turned back to the Word
[1:52:54] of God the message influenced what did
[1:53:03] John the Baptist do the man that Jesus
[1:53:07] said there was never a man born of woman
[1:53:11] like him or could compare with him until
[1:53:17] that time
[1:53:27] there's not many churches you're gonna
[1:53:29] be able to go to and get a quote like
[1:53:31] that Billy Graham could have said it or
[1:53:37] Roberts couldn't said it Joel Osteen
[1:53:42] King said TD jakes King said great men
[1:53:49] of God but they can't say it like this
[1:53:53] this is a man that stepped into the
[1:53:56] vision of Malachi 4 and knew who he was
[1:53:59] so when he's preaching the message
[1:54:02] influence he says there was never a man
[1:54:04] born of a woman like him or I could
[1:54:06] compare with him until that time now why
[1:54:10] because he knows his ministry is just as
[1:54:13] anointed just as mighty and would be
[1:54:17] spoken the same one weight of Jesus
[1:54:19] because his ministry just like John's
[1:54:22] ministry was to introduce the Messiah
[1:54:25] John introduced him at the first coming
[1:54:28] brother branham's ministry is
[1:54:29] introducing him at the second coming
[1:54:32] let's go on that great prophet ordained
[1:54:35] of God before the foundation world spoke
[1:54:37] of 1200 1200 7 years before he ever come
[1:54:42] on or 712 years rather before you ever
[1:54:45] before he came to earth by the prophet
[1:54:48] Isaiah here what did he do when he's
[1:54:50] seen a man come walking down out of the
[1:54:52] audience and he looked up above and saw
[1:54:55] the fire coming down from heaven in the
[1:54:57] form of a dove he cried out I have need
[1:54:59] to be baptized of thee I must decrease
[1:55:01] he must increase God can't have two on
[1:55:03] the earth at the same time only one has
[1:55:09] a message ah he mods does not have a
[1:55:13] message who she has the message amen
[1:55:19] only one has the message you know I must
[1:55:22] decrease he is the messenger I've been
[1:55:25] up to I've been up to this time now he
[1:55:28] takes my place now John is John is
[1:55:32] referring to Christ brother branham is
[1:55:34] also referring to Christ
[1:55:37] he takes my place amen
[1:55:40] as Elijah when Elijah went up and throw
[1:55:42] back his rope to Elijah his ministry was
[1:55:45] finished Elijah must take up where he
[1:55:49] left off
[1:55:50] who was that representing today Elijah
[1:55:52] represents the bride that's why the
[1:55:56] spirit that brought in the Prophet will
[1:55:58] be saying the same thing Elijah went up
[1:56:05] and thrown back and roped Elijah his
[1:56:06] ministry was finished Elijah must take
[1:56:08] up where he left off he must increase I
[1:56:10] must decrease John the Baptist now just
[1:56:14] a little statement here this nexus has
[1:56:16] be conscious of your loneliness you're
[1:56:20] nothing you're nothing how I would like
[1:56:22] to dwell on that for a few minutes but
[1:56:24] you're nothing this sounds sacrilege
[1:56:26] sacrilegious and it sounds crude says I
[1:56:29] don't think the pulpit is any place for
[1:56:31] any minister to crack jokes it's become
[1:56:33] a joke in carry on Hollywood glamour now
[1:56:35] that's what's the matter Hollywood
[1:56:36] through television has took the pulpit
[1:56:39] over our women is bowed to the goddess
[1:56:40] of fashion of Hollywood long ago and
[1:56:42] then the pulpit got into Hollywood
[1:56:44] through singers and so forth talented
[1:56:46] men and how its root man that the devil
[1:56:48] is you can't mix all of what it won't
[1:56:50] mix notice the great influence that
[1:56:53] people can give to others and what you
[1:56:55] do is an influence what we're doing with
[1:56:59] this dream is an influence and why not
[1:57:03] bring people truth for them to just
[1:57:06] meditate on I know you're gonna do
[1:57:09] research because you anybody and many
[1:57:11] people have come and they've heard you
[1:57:12] know it was his brother Brandon lady
[1:57:14] keep talking about who is this brother
[1:57:15] Bram he's a prophet of God that God said
[1:57:18] to turn our hearts back to the faith in
[1:57:19] the father's and what we're saying is he
[1:57:21] sent him to turn our hearts back to the
[1:57:23] Word of God to the truth of the word of
[1:57:25] God not that we worship him we worship
[1:57:28] Jesus we worship Jesus but he was a star
[1:57:32] in the hand of Jesus according to the
[1:57:34] book of Revelation just like Paul was a
[1:57:36] star amen
[1:57:38] and when the church got all the gospel
[1:57:40] all mixed up God had to send somebody to
[1:57:43] straighten it all out it was mixed up in
[1:57:45] John the Baptist day they got mixed up
[1:57:47] again today and if you don't believe it
[1:57:49] was mixed up
[1:57:49] why did the church crucify Jesus why did
[1:57:54] they crucify them if they weren't mixed
[1:57:55] up they man
[1:57:57] it's the same crucifixion going on again
[1:57:59] today the denominational Church system
[1:58:01] is crucifying Christ all over again God
[1:58:08] has a faithful forerunner a man with a
[1:58:11] message he has something the same and we
[1:58:14] just fellowship around that message when
[1:58:16] you see me reading those posts
[1:58:17] we're fellowshiping around the message
[1:58:18] and I ain't even said there's more that
[1:58:20] I'm gonna say next week but I want to at
[1:58:22] least get this part out amen yes John
[1:58:27] was there was never a prophet like him
[1:58:29] he was more than a prophet according to
[1:58:30] Jesus words there was no one like him
[1:58:34] until that time the reason he was
[1:58:39] anointed the reason he was mighty a
[1:58:42] miracle because he introduced Messiah
[1:58:47] the first time to introduce the Messiah
[1:58:53] never even work a miracle to get know
[1:58:55] but know the miracles got people's
[1:58:56] attention but he'd never work one but he
[1:58:58] still introduced Messiah god is good god
[1:59:03] is good let's pray dear God we thank you
[1:59:10] for your word Lord Christ's faithful
[1:59:14] four-runner so easy for us to look back
[1:59:18] in Scripture and see John the Baptist so
[1:59:21] easy for us to identify the Lord we're
[1:59:24] trying to bring people forward there was
[1:59:26] a second part to Malachi chapter 4 there
[1:59:29] was a second part to it and father we
[1:59:33] just we thank you Lord Jesus that you
[1:59:38] have opened our eyes to see any life she
[1:59:40] had to pray Elisha representing the the
[1:59:44] bride it's the bride praying that two
[1:59:46] had opened the eyes of the people again
[1:59:50] Kahala had to have his eyes open to see
[1:59:52] what was going on around and he was
[1:59:54] missing it
[1:59:55] I pray that people's spiritual eyes with
[1:59:59] come open to see as they rescrew
[2:00:02] their eyes will be anointed to see what
[2:00:04] you have written help us so God is my
[2:00:08] prayer we ask that you be glorified and
[2:00:11] magnified in a man an hour and all that
[2:00:15] we do Lord we don't want to miss it and
[2:00:17] we realize as the prophets in that
[2:00:19] message influence we have we have a
[2:00:21] responsibility as an influence that we
[2:00:23] have even as people streaming father and
[2:00:25] connect into this church there's that
[2:00:27] there's an influence that we have all I
[2:00:31] want to do is bring truth the Bible told
[2:00:34] us that we shall know truth and the
[2:00:36] truth will make us free father we love
[2:00:40] you and we praise you so Jesus name that
[2:00:45] we pray amen amen
