[39:50] of people you you try to give them the

[39:57] me
[39:58] because amen you might get off going the

[46:09] the lord bless you
[46:11] amen
[46:12] this morning we want to um
[46:15] oh
[46:16] let's take our seats sorry
[46:19] we want to just
[46:20] to give you a little time to relax
[46:23] we want to look at something from the
[46:25] life form of ruth
[46:28] amen and i don't know if you have
[46:31] the the slides i titled the the the four
[46:34] cycles of ruth the moabites
[46:37] you can call it the four junctions but i
[46:39] just want to make the title shot
[46:41] so we want to look at the life of
[46:43] ruth the moabite and how it applies onto
[46:47] your life and onto my life amen we don't
[46:50] just want to look at the historical
[46:51] perspective but we want to look at how
[46:54] does it practically apply to your life
[46:56] and my life now amen because we are not
[46:59] living uh four thousand years back we
[47:01] are living in the year
[47:03] 2022
[47:04] a man ruth lived four thousand or
[47:06] somewhere years back
[47:08] he lived in a year where they didn't
[47:09] have microphone
[47:10] they didn't have computers
[47:12] they didn't have an american as a nation
[47:14] the earth existed but the nation of
[47:16] united states didn't exist
[47:18] so we are in a different
[47:20] time and season and the lord is so
[47:22] specific that he gives the word for the
[47:25] right time and the right season so we
[47:27] want to see
[47:29] how ruth that if we are the ruth of this
[47:31] hour
[47:32] and how we manifest
[47:34] the same life form but for this very
[47:36] hour amen
[47:38] the bible said that we were caught from
[47:40] when jesus was born
[47:42] he had to be taken to egypt
[47:45] to hide from as if no pharaoh from a
[47:47] herald the king wanted to kill him
[47:50] now so the prophet pray that we we the
[47:52] lord called us out of egypt but not in
[47:54] the land of egypt and africa no
[47:57] but egypt the condition of the world
[47:59] amen egypt as a sinful nation egypt as
[48:02] the rightness of this world egypt as the
[48:05] old breath that's where we were caught
[48:07] from from the sex birth to the spoken
[48:10] word body a man the new birth so
[48:13] look
[48:14] sorry ruth
[48:16] went through four stages
[48:19] she went through the first stage
[48:21] she has to make decision
[48:23] and decision is tied to your choice
[48:25] the lord has given you the free will to
[48:28] make certain decisions in your life for
[48:30] your life for your family for yourself
[48:31] for church for the people that you
[48:33] influence
[48:34] and that is your personal choice the
[48:36] lord has sovereignly given to you a man
[48:39] so ruth was found in a point where she
[48:42] needed to make a choice
[48:44] and making that choice led to another
[48:46] step she needed to save and to labor and
[48:49] to work
[48:50] and that led to the next step
[48:52] that is resting or waiting for the
[48:55] blessings of the lord upon a life and
[48:57] that led to the ultimate
[48:59] the the perfect
[49:00] the expectation that was being rewarded
[49:04] for the choices or the decisions that
[49:06] she made
[49:07] and decisions your result it could be
[49:09] positive it could be negative based on
[49:11] the
[49:12] decision that you make
[49:13] so let's take a look at um
[49:16] a scripture i want to read the scripture
[49:19] i don't know let's let's like go back go
[49:21] to i don't know which slide but it has
[49:23] this scripture that i want to read um
[49:26] isaiah chapter 62 verse 1 to 4 somewhere
[49:36] praise be to the lord almighty
[49:40] isaiah
[49:41] chapter 62
[49:47] there you go
[49:48] amen you are the city i want to give the
[49:51] the overview of my
[49:53] of the same one just in case we are not
[49:54] able to touch everything we've got a
[49:55] bunch of scriptures we're not going to
[49:57] read all of them and so we want to give
[49:59] overview nowadays the highlight
[50:02] of of what you want to speak today is
[50:04] that for zion's sick will i not hold my
[50:06] peace and for jerusalem sick
[50:09] i will not rest until the righteousness
[50:11] thereof goes forth as brightness and the
[50:14] salvation thereof
[50:16] as a lamp that beneath
[50:18] two an agenda shall see thy
[50:20] righteousness and all kings thy glory
[50:23] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[50:25] and i want you to highlight that new
[50:27] name which the mouth of the lord shall
[50:29] name
[50:29] thou shalt also be a crown of glory in
[50:32] the hand of the lord and arroyo dyed him
[50:35] in the hand of thy god thou shall know
[50:37] more be termed forsaken neither shall
[50:40] thy land be any more term desolate but
[50:43] thou shalt be called hefzeba and thyland
[50:46] beulah for the lord delighted in thee
[50:49] and thy land shall be married amen
[50:52] god bless you now back to ruth
[50:57] ruth was a gentile a moabite
[50:59] who didn't know the lord but now there
[51:01] was a time where there was famine in
[51:03] israel
[51:04] so there was a man an israelite
[51:07] husband of naomi took decision to take
[51:10] his wife and two sons to moab to find a
[51:13] greener pastures
[51:15] so they went to the land and
[51:16] his sons got married to
[51:19] two more british women oppa and ruth
[51:22] but in the course of time the man died
[51:24] eliminate passed away
[51:26] and it wasn't probably too long his two
[51:28] sons
[51:29] forgot their name malone and something
[51:32] else they also went to be with the lord
[51:34] so
[51:35] naomi was left
[51:37] uh
[51:38] as a widow without a husband and the two
[51:40] sons were gone
[51:42] and you put yourself in that you can
[51:43] imagine how life would be and so there
[51:46] was a time even when he came out to
[51:47] israel and they said oh naomi he said
[51:48] don't come in on me
[51:50] call me mara
[51:52] because i went with plenty and i came
[51:54] back with nothing
[51:56] so but the lord has something beyond our
[51:58] earthly measurement amen we measure
[52:01] success is based on maybe the how much
[52:03] you have in your bank account
[52:05] uh
[52:06] the job that you do the number of houses
[52:08] and different things like that your
[52:09] business but gas measurement is about
[52:12] redemption and salvation as we read here
[52:15] and before something can be saved and
[52:16] redeemed that thing has to be lost first
[52:19] amen so ruth
[52:21] naomi
[52:22] started with
[52:24] four overflowing blessing
[52:27] husband children and maybe pretty soon
[52:29] he was going to get grandkids
[52:30] but all of a sudden a sudden went blue
[52:33] in her family
[52:34] and all that she had was lost saved with
[52:36] her two daughters-in-law
[52:38] and it wasn't long there was food in
[52:40] israel abundance of food so naomi made a
[52:43] decision to go back to her homeland and
[52:46] so the two daughters in law followed her
[52:48] on the way and she said you know what
[52:50] it's it's it's painful for me for your
[52:52] sick
[52:53] that it's happened to me this way i
[52:56] don't have any more
[52:57] suns in my womb you know to give them if
[52:59] i even marry now and get science you
[53:01] can't wait for them to grow up to marry
[53:02] so go back and i like the way he put his
[53:04] go back to your to your family to your
[53:07] mothers
[53:08] and to the gods in other words the
[53:10] adults that you worship
[53:12] go back so now we gave them a choice to
[53:14] go back to their homeland and they were
[53:16] shaped idols they worship all kinds of
[53:18] things they didn't know the god of
[53:19] jehovah amen
[53:22] and all of them cried and said we go
[53:24] with you
[53:25] but oppa kiss the mother-in-law and
[53:28] return back to the idols
[53:30] but naomi made a statement which is
[53:32] astonishing and i want us to read that
[53:35] is what uh kind of encapsulate a
[53:37] decision to go to
[53:39] to go to israel to go with their
[53:41] mother-in-law to a nation that she
[53:43] didn't know she didn't know their
[53:44] culture so let's go to um
[53:47] let's see
[53:56] to the lord
[53:59] okay let's go to ruth decision the uh
[54:02] ruth chapter 1 verse 11 to 19 of course
[54:04] i'm going to read just a few of them but
[54:06] when you go home you can read rule
[54:08] chapter 1 11 to 19. i read a couple of
[54:10] verses maybe
[54:12] three or four verses
[54:15] root chapter 1 verse
[54:17] i'll read from 16 to 19.
[54:21] that is where her decision or let's say
[54:22] from eleven two
[54:24] he said and naomi said
[54:26] ten again and now he said ten again my
[54:29] daughters why would you go with me and
[54:31] theref and there yet
[54:33] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[54:36] that they may be your husbands 10 again
[54:40] my daughters
[54:41] go your way for i'm too old to have a
[54:43] husband if i should say so
[54:45] i have hope
[54:47] i have hope i should have a husband also
[54:49] tonight and should also bear sons would
[54:52] you tarry for them till you groan let's
[54:54] jump to
[54:55] 16
[54:56] and and 16 and ruth said in treatment
[54:59] not to go to leave thee or to return
[55:02] from following after thee for whether
[55:04] thou goes i will go and where thou
[55:06] lodges our lodge thy people shall be my
[55:09] people and thy god my god
[55:12] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[55:14] minded to go with her
[55:16] then she left speaking with her
[55:18] when
[55:22] 19 so
[55:23] they too went until they came to
[55:25] bethlehem and it came to pass
[55:27] when they were when they were come to
[55:29] bethlehem that all the city was moved
[55:31] about them and they said is this naomi
[55:33] amen
[55:34] naomi dak ami had abandoned he came back
[55:37] empty-handed but the lord has something
[55:39] installed so now look let's focus a
[55:41] little on ruth here
[55:43] ruth was determined and the bible said
[55:45] that she was steadfast
[55:47] to go with her mother-in-law who has
[55:49] become her mother a man because she left
[55:52] her mother's mother and father behind
[55:54] her brothers and sisters and kings and
[55:56] kinsmen
[55:57] behind and then clank clung onto naomi
[56:00] her mother-in-law because she saw
[56:02] something in naomi a man
[56:04] she has been with her husband her
[56:05] father-in-law a brother-in-law and a
[56:08] mother-in-law and she's seen not just
[56:10] their culture their culture is one thing
[56:13] maybe their culture might even be
[56:14] superior to the culture of naomi but she
[56:17] saw something about this lady which is
[56:20] jehovah in her
[56:22] and she had a fist and a hunger for her
[56:25] a man and ruth was a woman of compassion
[56:29] she was a virtuous woman because when
[56:31] she realized that her sister-in-law was
[56:33] gone but she decided to go with her
[56:36] mother-in-law
[56:37] one reason we can we can infer was that
[56:40] her mother-in-law was quite old maybe
[56:41] not like 70s but let's assume she was in
[56:43] the sixties and now we know that pretty
[56:45] soon maybe 10 20 30 years down the road
[56:47] the mother-in-law could not fend for
[56:49] herself
[56:50] and she's lost her husband her children
[56:52] had two sons so she determined that i'm
[56:55] not going to let her die in sorrow i'll
[56:57] go with i'll cling steadfast to my
[56:59] mother-in-law with my mother and be a
[57:01] help and now she invoked
[57:04] a word strong decision said let nothing
[57:06] depart i mean separate you and i save
[57:08] death
[57:09] your god will be my god
[57:11] your culture will be my culture your
[57:13] food will be my food your people will be
[57:15] my people
[57:16] and where you die i will die i'll be
[57:19] buried there what a statement amen what
[57:22] a decision
[57:23] this was a decision for by a lady to
[57:26] follow her mother-in-law bring it to her
[57:28] modern terms how many would like to do
[57:30] that
[57:31] amen if a man or a woman can make a
[57:34] decision to help to be with their
[57:35] mother-in-law who is who is going to
[57:37] pass away how much more our decision
[57:40] towards jesus christ be
[57:42] amen
[57:43] your eternal decision
[57:45] not just to serve the lord
[57:47] but to be him amen because when you take
[57:49] that decision let's see how it's going
[57:51] to end for naomi if you take the sin to
[57:53] serve the lord you're gonna be him amen
[57:56] he's gonna put his power in you
[57:59] he's gonna manifest in you
[58:01] and what else do you want beside the
[58:02] almighty god manifesting you amen all
[58:06] the blessing on earth is yours glory
[58:08] hallelujah to the lord
[58:10] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[58:12] go to the second part
[58:14] let's see
[58:15] uh the next thing that follows decision
[58:18] let's go to a let's read this um
[58:21] quotes before let's transition from
[58:23] brokenness to masterpiece
[58:25] let's read that
[58:27] quotes from the prophet and then go go
[58:29] on with the scriptures
[58:36] just to give a little highlight
[58:39] kingsman's redeemer 1960 october the
[58:43] second
[58:44] paragraph 61. so now i want to liken
[58:46] this morning naomi the elder lady to the
[58:48] orthodox church the jewish orthodox
[58:51] church ruth
[58:52] the moabite agenda being the christian
[58:54] church the new church
[58:56] and i want to approach it i want to
[58:58] approach it from four different faces
[59:00] ruth i got to wrote down here ruth
[59:02] deciding ruth making making her decision
[59:06] ruth 7
[59:07] ruth reston or waiting ruth rewarded
[59:11] as we come back ruth making decision
[59:13] ruth after she made a decision then ruth
[59:15] is seven
[59:16] then ruth is resting then root is
[59:19] rewarded amen and that is the four faces
[59:22] that route went through and we go
[59:23] through
[59:24] uh similar phases amen
[59:26] and sometimes serving is not just only
[59:28] seven with uh with with joy and with a
[59:32] pleasantness but serving sometimes goes
[59:34] with suffering and pain and sorrow not
[59:38] because you made the wrong decision you
[59:39] made a perfect decision before the
[59:41] almighty god and yes you're gonna suffer
[59:43] for that decision
[59:45] amen that's why if you are not careful
[59:47] your faith will begin to waver and
[59:50] and move right but then be steadfast
[59:53] like ruth
[59:54] and even suffer for the decision that
[59:55] you make look into the rest and the
[59:57] reward that is less ahead of you amen
[1:00:01] so let's read a rule chapter let's go to
[1:00:04] rule chapter two
[1:00:06] now she's made a decision let's go to
[1:00:08] the next
[1:00:09] uh slide
[1:00:10] seven labyrinth and suffering rule
[1:00:12] chapter 2 verse 1 to 14.
[1:00:15] let's pick um
[1:00:17] verse 2.
[1:00:19] okay let me read one and now and naomi
[1:00:22] had a kingsman of her husbands a mighty
[1:00:24] man of wealth of the family of eliminate
[1:00:27] and his name was boaz
[1:00:29] too and rude muabites said unto naomi
[1:00:32] let me now go to the field and glean
[1:00:35] ears of corn after him in whose side i
[1:00:38] shall find greece and she said unto her
[1:00:40] go my daughter verse three and she went
[1:00:43] and came and gleaned in the fold after
[1:00:45] the rippers
[1:00:46] and her harp was to light on a part of
[1:00:48] the field belonging unto boaz who was of
[1:00:51] the kindred of elimi lake and behold
[1:00:54] boss came from bethlehem and said unto
[1:00:56] the reapers the lord be with you the
[1:00:58] lord be with me shalom and they answered
[1:01:00] the lord bless thee then said was unto
[1:01:03] his servant
[1:01:04] that was set over the reapers whose
[1:01:06] damsel is this whose daughter is this
[1:01:08] who's
[1:01:09] whose girl is this and the seven that
[1:01:12] was set over the reapers answering cell
[1:01:14] said
[1:01:18] it is the moabitis dam cell that came
[1:01:21] back with naomi of the country of moab
[1:01:23] and she said i pray you let me glean and
[1:01:26] gather after the repairs among the ships
[1:01:27] so she came and had continued even from
[1:01:30] the morning until now
[1:01:31] that she's turreted a little in the
[1:01:33] house
[1:01:34] verse 8 then said boast unto ruth here
[1:01:37] is thou not my daughter go not to glean
[1:01:41] in another field neither go from hence
[1:01:44] but abide
[1:01:45] here first by my meetings let their eyes
[1:01:48] be upon the field that thou do reap and
[1:01:51] go thou after them
[1:01:52] i have not have i not charged the young
[1:01:55] men that they should not touch thee and
[1:01:57] when thou art at first go onto the
[1:01:59] vessels and drink of that which the
[1:02:02] young men have drawn
[1:02:03] then she that was ruth
[1:02:05] she fell on her face and bowed herself
[1:02:07] to the ground and said unto him why have
[1:02:09] i found grace in that side that thou
[1:02:12] should take knowledge of me sin i'm a
[1:02:14] stranger and boaz said was answered and
[1:02:17] said unto her it has fully been shown me
[1:02:20] all that that has done unto thy
[1:02:22] mother-in-law since the death of the
[1:02:23] husband and how that has left thy father
[1:02:27] and thy mother and the land of thy
[1:02:30] nativity and now thou come unto your
[1:02:31] people doubt no knowest not their their
[1:02:34] to fall
[1:02:35] the lord recompense in other words the
[1:02:37] lord reward thy work a full reward be
[1:02:40] given unto thee of the lord god of
[1:02:42] israel on that under whose wings thou
[1:02:45] had come to trust
[1:02:46] then she said let me find let me find
[1:02:49] favor in the aside my lord for that thou
[1:02:52] has comforted me and for that that i
[1:02:54] have spoken friendly unto thy handmaid
[1:02:56] though i be not like unto one of them
[1:02:58] behind me hand me amen god bless you
[1:03:02] now that is a time ruth was beginning to
[1:03:06] save and if you take the right decision
[1:03:08] even in time of suffering god gives you
[1:03:10] favor and grace amen
[1:03:12] root shoot compassion unto naomi to help
[1:03:15] her to go with her and now the
[1:03:16] compassion that she sold she's going to
[1:03:19] reap it in abundance amen she didn't
[1:03:22] know boaz she wasn't a kids man to boast
[1:03:25] but by predestination because she took
[1:03:27] the right decision the lord god of
[1:03:29] heaven put favor
[1:03:31] in the heart of boaz for ruth amen
[1:03:34] and ruth allowed her to glean in
[1:03:37] on her field amen now let's type in the
[1:03:40] field is the field of the lord jesus
[1:03:42] christ the field uh the map i think
[1:03:46] since that verse was singing the road
[1:03:48] map that the lord has given to the field
[1:03:50] is the word of the lord the bible
[1:03:52] the word of the lord for your hour the
[1:03:53] message of god for the for your day and
[1:03:55] your time and season amen so that is the
[1:03:58] food that you should glean do not go to
[1:04:00] any other field if you go to any other
[1:04:02] field you're gonna have thorns and
[1:04:05] thistles you're gonna have scorpions and
[1:04:07] spiders biting you
[1:04:09] because it's not the right for you amen
[1:04:13] you're going to have suffer unnecessary
[1:04:15] pain amen let them put in in a simple
[1:04:18] way young ladies young man amen upcoming

[1:06:23] it down a little bit let's go to
[1:06:25] um
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:27] ruth said said
[1:06:29] why have i found grace in your sight
[1:06:31] because she took the right decision
[1:06:33] on the way coming with an army to take
[1:06:36] care of naomi and the lord sent a
[1:06:38] wealthy person to take care of her
[1:06:40] and i want us to underline certain words
[1:06:42] here
[1:06:44] he said you have spoken verse 13. then
[1:06:47] she said let me find favor on your side
[1:06:49] for thou
[1:06:50] has comforted me
[1:06:52] and thou has spoken friendly unto thy
[1:06:55] hand man seen that i'm not like one of
[1:06:57] your people
[1:06:58] amen now what do we learn from here
[1:07:01] a man that really loves you is the man
[1:07:03] that will speak comforting where to you
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:06] if i'm going with a person that hates
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:09] that
[1:07:10] that despise speaks spiteful word to you
[1:07:13] that is not a relationship you should
[1:07:14] stay in
[1:07:16] no matter how handsome or how beautiful
[1:07:17] it is it's not going to end well
[1:07:20] because what is in him is what is coming
[1:07:22] out
[1:07:23] it is always putting you down always
[1:07:25] blasting you always being negative to
[1:07:27] you
[1:07:28] it's going to be the same thing when you
[1:07:29] get married to that person
[1:07:32] so be watchful
[1:07:33] and be worthful amen before you enter
[1:07:36] into a relationship amen
[1:07:38] because the person that can speak
[1:07:40] comfort and love not not not west by
[1:07:44] west of men amen
[1:07:45] men can speak so many things they can
[1:07:48] give what we call rap sodi but they have
[1:07:50] no substance in them
[1:07:51] but brazman is smiling he knows what i'm
[1:07:53] talking about
[1:07:55] men can speak they can tell you out i'm
[1:07:56] going to take you to the moon i'll do
[1:07:58] i'll do i'll i'll give you whatever you
[1:08:00] want but the word has got no substance
[1:08:03] because this man hasn't got a character
[1:08:05] a dime of creature in him he just wants
[1:08:07] your flesh
[1:08:08] and if you let him take your flesh he'll
[1:08:10] destroy your life
[1:08:12] the same thing to men young men if you
[1:08:14] see this entire thing lady enters him
[1:08:16] beautiful so-called young lady and you
[1:08:18] get enticed to her she's going to
[1:08:21] destroy your life she's going to take
[1:08:22] your virtues from him
[1:08:24] you are men of you may not be the first
[1:08:25] person she's met
[1:08:27] she's going to destroy your life and
[1:08:28] you'll never be the same she's going to
[1:08:30] leave marks on your body amen max that
[1:08:33] even when the lord forgives you you're
[1:08:34] still going to keep in your mind
[1:08:36] so don't start to begin with amen stay
[1:08:39] in the food of ruth as in the photo
[1:08:41] boast amen stay with the lord jesus
[1:08:44] christ and it will be well with you
[1:08:46] god's own time will give you what he has
[1:08:48] for you and you enjoy the rest of your
[1:08:50] life amen blessed be the name of the
[1:08:53] lord
[1:08:54] glory to the lord
[1:08:55] let's go to um
[1:08:58] the next
[1:09:00] ruth reston
[1:09:01] after taking decision to go with naomi
[1:09:04] she had to work if you read the rest she
[1:09:07] had to go to glean every morning take
[1:09:09] basket and go and glean corn and rice
[1:09:12] and wheat and soak them and all the
[1:09:14] millet and all the other cereals you can
[1:09:16] think about i mean a modern time you can
[1:09:18] put potatoes and different things in
[1:09:20] your place amen
[1:09:22] it was a hard labor she didn't know the
[1:09:24] people maybe some of the ladies were
[1:09:26] like who is this who is this lady you
[1:09:28] know she's from other western country
[1:09:30] they might be speaking gospel about her
[1:09:32] but her heart was focused on her vision
[1:09:35] same thing as a young lady as a young
[1:09:36] man not everybody is going to give you a
[1:09:37] good comment on even how you dress you
[1:09:39] wear your lungs scared some people will
[1:09:41] speak spy for what you long wear long
[1:09:43] skirt are you an old lady
[1:09:45] that will hurt you
[1:09:47] you feel like am i why do i why can't i
[1:09:50] wear pants why can't i be like them why
[1:09:52] can't i just be a little bit fashionable
[1:09:55] if your decision is not set steadfast
[1:09:57] like ruth you're gonna go this way but
[1:10:00] if your audition is framed with the lord
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:03] it doesn't matter who say this and who
[1:10:04] say that
[1:10:05] it's coming from the inside amen is that
[1:10:08] tcm world coming from babbling from your
[1:10:10] heart it's jesus christ you are not
[1:10:11] doing it just the outside but it's
[1:10:13] something that you've taken decision
[1:10:15] amen and there are certain times the
[1:10:16] lord wants you as a human being to take
[1:10:18] decision
[1:10:19] it's not everything is going to give you
[1:10:20] great anointing to do it you want you as
[1:10:22] a human being sit down as a young lady
[1:10:26] as a teenager as an adolescent take a
[1:10:28] decision that i'm not going to let
[1:10:30] nobody touch me until the day that the
[1:10:32] almighty give me my husband
[1:10:35] amen as a young man you're going to take
[1:10:37] a decision that i'm not going to touch
[1:10:38] any woman until that woman is my wife
[1:10:41] that i'm married to
[1:10:42] so you take your decision and then ask
[1:10:44] the grace of god to help you and the
[1:10:46] lord will lead you and help you amen but
[1:10:49] if you let your friends influence you if
[1:10:51] you let social media influence you
[1:10:53] facebook and what have you influenced
[1:10:54] you you're gonna reap the result because
[1:10:57] decisions yield result positive or
[1:11:00] negative you will repeat yourself amen
[1:11:03] so take the right decision god has
[1:11:05] placed godly men and women in your lives
[1:11:07] ministers but a jack but a smiley but a
[1:11:09] troy but a jerry and eldest in your life
[1:11:12] to lead you amen people pray and come
[1:11:15] and sing people pray and come and preach
[1:11:17] the word to bless you
[1:11:20] why do you want to leave that food of
[1:11:21] boaz and go to the enemies field to get
[1:11:24] bitten by scorpions oh my lord help us
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:29] glory hallelujah one time i was just a
[1:11:32] couple of weeks ago i used to do online
[1:11:34] virtual services with a
[1:11:37] hispanic people and one sister attended
[1:11:40] she's an african sister
[1:11:42] and her name happened to be ruth and he
[1:11:44] said brother i've never heard this
[1:11:45] before i've been a sunday school girl
[1:11:47] all my life my my i think my my father
[1:11:50] is a pastor but i've never had a story
[1:11:52] of ruth being preached like this he said
[1:11:54] when we were preaching it was blessing
[1:11:55] my heart my heart was lifted up and she
[1:11:57] gave a testimony i think prior to that
[1:11:59] she said
[1:12:00] i had it you said it's a different thing
[1:12:02] when
[1:12:03] your parents and people talk to you
[1:12:05] about the message if you want your
[1:12:07] parents groom you in the message but
[1:12:09] it's a different thing when you see it
[1:12:10] for yourself
[1:12:12] she gave an experience of seeing the
[1:12:14] message for herself so the lord gave
[1:12:16] gave a dream
[1:12:18] and the lord mentioned her name ruth
[1:12:20] he showed a bible and a message book let
[1:12:22] this two book never depart from you
[1:12:25] with my daughter
[1:12:26] hold on to this book and let it be your
[1:12:28] road map
[1:12:30] the bible and the message it will lead
[1:12:32] you to eternity
[1:12:34] amen and i believe there are many all of
[1:12:36] us are ruth amen and let that not book
[1:12:39] the word of the lord the bible and the
[1:12:40] message
[1:12:41] the message is interpretation of the
[1:12:43] bible to us
[1:12:44] is the self same thing amen
[1:12:46] it's just like now we put the new
[1:12:47] testament together they used to have the
[1:12:49] old testament in the time of moses and
[1:12:51] then the lord is always continued the
[1:12:52] lord is not it doesn't have a stopping
[1:12:54] place it's just eternity unveiling so
[1:12:57] the lord started a new testament with a
[1:12:59] peter and matthew and paul and co so
[1:13:02] there is no difference is one the
[1:13:03] message that we read is not william
[1:13:06] brahm's message he was just a servant of
[1:13:08] it just like paul amen like moses but
[1:13:11] the message is the word of the lord
[1:13:13] jesus christ unto us in this generation
[1:13:16] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:13:18] so ruth now
[1:13:20] was going to rest
[1:13:22] let's see let's read rule chapter 3
[1:13:24] verse
[1:13:25] 1 to 18 but i'll skip some of the
[1:13:26] scriptures
[1:13:28] verse one so then naomi is then now me
[1:13:31] mother-in-law said unto her my daughter
[1:13:34] shall i not seek rest for thee that it
[1:13:36] may be well with thee and i want us to
[1:13:38] learn a lesson here ruth took a decision
[1:13:40] to help her mother-in-law
[1:13:42] in her old age and the mother-in-law who
[1:13:44] is her mother also triggered this and
[1:13:45] that you know what
[1:13:47] sooner than later maybe 10 20 whenever
[1:13:49] 40 years i may not be here and even if
[1:13:52] i'm here i might be too old to help
[1:13:53] naomi sorry help ruth she's a stranger
[1:13:57] where is she going to find food
[1:13:59] maybe she has a place to lodge
[1:14:01] how is life going to be for her so the
[1:14:03] same god who put in a heart of ruth to
[1:14:06] help naomi is the same god who could
[1:14:09] have heard of naomi to help ruth
[1:14:11] and naomi is the old church not that she
[1:14:13] said prophetess a man she was a woman
[1:14:15] with the word of god in her heart she
[1:14:17] knows the word of god for her day so she
[1:14:19] said i need to find you rest and let's
[1:14:21] see the race she was talking about he
[1:14:23] said it's now
[1:14:25] it's now is and now it's not boaz verse
[1:14:28] 2 of our kindred and whose meetings that
[1:14:30] was
[1:14:31] and he we know it uh badly tonight in
[1:14:34] the threshing floor
[1:14:35] watched myself and anointed myself let
[1:14:38] me skip all of them you can read it when
[1:14:39] you go home let's go to verse nine and
[1:14:41] he said
[1:14:44] who are the okay
[1:14:46] let me read some of them to make sense
[1:14:47] to us
[1:14:48] let them continue with verse three watch
[1:14:49] thyself therefore and anoint thee and
[1:14:51] put thy remnant upon thee and get thee
[1:14:54] down to the floor but make not thyself
[1:14:56] known unto the man until he
[1:14:59] until he
[1:15:00] shall have done eating and drinking and
[1:15:03] it shall be when he lie down that thou
[1:15:05] shalt mark the place where
[1:15:08] he shall lie and thou shalt go in and
[1:15:10] uncover his feet and lay thee down and
[1:15:13] he will tell thee what thou shalt do
[1:15:16] and she said unto her all that that has
[1:15:19] said
[1:15:20] will i do amen all that thou saith unto
[1:15:23] me i would do
[1:15:25] versus and she said and she went down
[1:15:27] onto the floor and did according to all
[1:15:29] that her mother in law beat her and when
[1:15:32] boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart
[1:15:34] was merry and he went out to lie down at
[1:15:37] the end of the heap of corn
[1:15:39] she came softly and uncovered his feet
[1:15:41] and laid her down and it came to pass at
[1:15:44] midnight that the man was afraid and
[1:15:45] turned himself and behold a woman laid
[1:15:47] down at at his feet and he said who are
[1:15:50] thou and she answered i'm ruth thine
[1:15:53] handmade spread therefore thy scared
[1:15:55] over thy hand made for thou art a near
[1:15:57] kinsman and he said blessed be thou
[1:16:00] be thou of the lord my daughter for thou
[1:16:03] has shown more kindness in the latter
[1:16:05] end than at the beginning in as much as
[1:16:08] thou followers not young men whether
[1:16:11] poor or rich and now my daughter fear
[1:16:13] not i'll do
[1:16:14] to thee all that i requested for all the
[1:16:17] city of my people don't know that there
[1:16:20] are a virtuous virtuous women woman and
[1:16:23] now and now it is true that i am i am
[1:16:26] the near kinsman how be it there's a
[1:16:29] kinsmen nearer than i amen
[1:16:32] now ruth
[1:16:34] took a decision to be compassionate
[1:16:37] with naomi and now me being a prophet
[1:16:40] with the word of the lord by inspiration
[1:16:43] ordered ruth to do certain things is a
[1:16:45] cultural thing to do in islam if you do
[1:16:47] that it could be interpreted differently
[1:16:49] amen if you go to a man's house and try
[1:16:52] to pull this uh whatever under you
[1:16:55] this time it could be as a rip
[1:16:57] or attempting to rip but that was the
[1:16:59] culture of that time industry and they
[1:17:00] were long groups beside what they were
[1:17:02] they were the inner and outer rope like
[1:17:04] if you have seen muslims are eastern
[1:17:06] people how they they dress india and so
[1:17:08] so they have the inner garment and the
[1:17:10] long outer garment so ruth did as their
[1:17:12] mother-in-law better to do and that was
[1:17:14] a culture signing that she needed
[1:17:16] redemption and ruth was just a young
[1:17:18] lady let me just say
[1:17:20] just make it a story here like let's
[1:17:22] assume ruth married in those time they
[1:17:24] didn't go to school they didn't have to
[1:17:25] go to cali to get a
[1:17:27] vocation and stuff like that they
[1:17:29] married maybe at the age of 16 18 20.
[1:17:32] you know and so ruth married and she
[1:17:34] didn't even bear children with a husband
[1:17:37] and husband went on to be with the lord
[1:17:39] so rude didn't have a child so let's say
[1:17:41] ruth was around let's give it 20 to 25.
[1:17:44] and boaz wasn't that young at that time
[1:17:46] was a man that had married before and
[1:17:49] his wife had died so he was a widower
[1:17:51] about let's say 45 to 50 years old and
[1:17:53] you see the bible said that she referred
[1:17:55] to her as my daughter
[1:17:57] she didn't refer to as my sister because
[1:17:59] they have
[1:18:00] so white difference in each apart
[1:18:02] amen but the man of god sometimes is not
[1:18:04] the way human beings think
[1:18:06] the word the lord is sovereign and what
[1:18:08] he does amen
[1:18:10] he leads people said in this way he lead
[1:18:12] this one this way he lead this one that
[1:18:13] way
[1:18:14] so the ghost on sovereign way he
[1:18:17] ordained ruth and boaz were very white
[1:18:19] who could be her daughter
[1:18:21] amen put on somebody about 45 to 50
[1:18:24] marinette 20 25 year old person
[1:18:27] i mean that age is so different it's so
[1:18:29] white but it's the predestination of the
[1:18:31] lord for them amen
[1:18:32] that's why in life you have to know your
[1:18:34] personal predestination because your way
[1:18:36] may not be as this person's way
[1:18:39] the way the lord has ordained for you
[1:18:41] may not be how this person get this
[1:18:42] blessing
[1:18:43] oh you say oh lord you bless this man
[1:18:45] this way you bless my sister this way
[1:18:47] why not me this way you are 70 different
[1:18:50] purpose on earth
[1:18:52] your purpose is different from your
[1:18:53] mother
[1:18:54] maybe your mother got married at a day
[1:18:56] of 20 you may marry at the age of 35
[1:18:59] it doesn't matter that's what the lord
[1:19:00] has chosen for you
[1:19:01] and you have to be steadfast and stay
[1:19:03] with the lord and when you get 35 the
[1:19:05] lord will give you the blessing of the
[1:19:06] blessed of the blessed
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:09] so stay with the lord amen
[1:19:11] glory hallelujah to the lord so let's
[1:19:14] move on to see
[1:19:16] how after ruth reston she got a lot of
[1:19:19] corn and
[1:19:20] was blessed
[1:19:22] bless ruth with a lot of substance
[1:19:25] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:19:28] let's see let me read them okay let me
[1:19:31] let's move on to the
[1:19:32] eternal rewards i think i had a
[1:19:34] scripture
[1:19:35] eternal rewards begin with sacred
[1:19:37] decisions
[1:19:41] okay that is about revelation chapter 61
[1:19:44] bram preacher i may say relation chapter
[1:19:46] five
[1:19:47] number two
[1:19:48] 61-0618 103 now there is four stations
[1:19:52] four junctions in ruth and boaz i put it
[1:19:55] four cycles because god moves in cycles
[1:19:58] then you break the cycle or the cycle
[1:20:00] enter into a cycle and where cycle one
[1:20:02] in cycle two means is the junction that
[1:20:05] i'm talking about so the first thing is
[1:20:06] rude deciding uh how many ever had had
[1:20:10] me preached a message let's see your
[1:20:12] hands i know well i guess i've had it
[1:20:14] here
[1:20:15] and had it on tips and so the route
[1:20:17] first she had to decide whether she was
[1:20:19] going to go with go into this land
[1:20:22] or not with naomi she had to make
[1:20:24] decisions then after she got there the
[1:20:26] next thing is she had to do the next
[1:20:28] thing she had to do was to save in the
[1:20:30] field of boaz out there and barefooted
[1:20:32] gleaning uh gleaning behind the reapers
[1:20:35] seven and then after she had found grace
[1:20:37] in boa's side then she had to wait to
[1:20:40] boast done the kinsmen's kinsman redempt
[1:20:42] redemption to take back all naomi laws
[1:20:46] lost in order to bring in ruth the
[1:20:48] moabite and then the next stage is ruth
[1:20:51] is rewarded amen that's the ultimate
[1:20:55] reward amen we can type it to
[1:20:58] ruth
[1:20:58] losing a husband we can tap into the new
[1:21:01] breath
[1:21:02] when we when we were born on earth we
[1:21:03] had a husband not an external husband
[1:21:06] the husband that was sitting on the
[1:21:07] inside of you
[1:21:08] through the sex bed was what satan
[1:21:12] that was
[1:21:12] lucifer tree of knowledge of good and
[1:21:15] bad
[1:21:16] every human being knows how to do good
[1:21:17] and do some bad even out of hitler he
[1:21:20] wasn't bad all around him after all he
[1:21:22] was fighting for germany so he was good
[1:21:24] to the germans
[1:21:25] but it was bad to other people other
[1:21:27] races so everybody has a tree of
[1:21:29] knowledge of good and bad that's not
[1:21:30] what god requires that husband has to
[1:21:32] die
[1:21:33] satan has to die
[1:21:35] if you have a child
[1:21:37] when they are children they are angelic
[1:21:39] they are beautiful sweet and lovely when
[1:21:42] they get to certain age
[1:21:43] certainty begin to show up
[1:21:46] where is this tree coming from they
[1:21:47] begin to say certain things they begin
[1:21:49] to give you certain looks
[1:21:52] where is this coming from she was
[1:21:53] supposed to be an angel
[1:21:56] now the angelic is now transitioned to
[1:21:58] the real who she or he is
[1:22:01] and then they begin to
[1:22:03] be angry with you they won't respond
[1:22:05] when they call them they want to do do
[1:22:07] their own thing
[1:22:08] oh but i thought my daughter is an angel
[1:22:11] my grandbaby's an angel
[1:22:13] she's done with the
[1:22:14] angelic age now she's translating to
[1:22:15] somebody else something else
[1:22:19] that's when she needed the holy ghost
[1:22:20] baptism
[1:22:21] that's where that person in her or in
[1:22:23] him has to die
[1:22:25] by the gospel of jesus christ and then
[1:22:27] jesus shall be born in hell which is the
[1:22:29] type of boaz an army amen
[1:22:32] the old husband dies and the new husband
[1:22:34] the older husband in moab has to die and
[1:22:37] then go to the new field which is israel
[1:22:40] judah bethlehem
[1:22:42] go to the foot of david and then be
[1:22:45] rewarded by the holy ghost baptism amen
[1:22:48] and the ultimate is the holy ghost
[1:22:50] baptism it doesn't matter how
[1:22:53] long you've been in the message how long
[1:22:55] you've read bible how long you've been a
[1:22:57] christian if you don't have the holy
[1:22:58] ghost baptism you are not there yet you
[1:23:02] don't have your reward
[1:23:03] amen the holy ghost button is what will
[1:23:06] bring you your reward that you're
[1:23:07] looking for because when you get the
[1:23:09] holy ghost baptism you become what
[1:23:11] christ
[1:23:12] and the words that you speak is not just
[1:23:15] your word is the word of the inner man
[1:23:17] the lord jesus christ speaking through
[1:23:19] your heart amen
[1:23:20] just like naomi naomi had a word in her
[1:23:23] so she could sit down and order her
[1:23:25] daughter that you go to the foot of boaz
[1:23:27] how did you know boy's mind that a man
[1:23:30] will not rest until she redeems you how
[1:23:32] did she know she hadn't had conversation
[1:23:34] prior to that but there's something in
[1:23:36] here that speaks to her that is jehovah
[1:23:39] of the old testament and there must be
[1:23:41] something in you that speaks to you that
[1:23:43] is the same jehovah of old testament
[1:23:45] becoming jesus christ of this day
[1:23:47] speaking to your heart in terms of
[1:23:49] distresses in terms of necessities there
[1:23:51] should be an inner man or the inner
[1:23:53] woman whatever you call it
[1:23:55] to speak to your heart
[1:23:57] that all as well amen no matter how
[1:24:00] things seem to be falling apart like in
[1:24:02] the life of naomi and ruth all is well
[1:24:05] and even in boaz amen because he lost
[1:24:07] his wife amen the lord is bringing
[1:24:09] another story love story in your life so
[1:24:12] you need the redemption which is the
[1:24:14] holy ghost baptism
[1:24:16] and i believe as the body of christ if
[1:24:18] it's something that we need to emphasize
[1:24:21] is the new breath the holy ghost baptism
[1:24:25] the self same thing amen
[1:24:27] is not the baptism that anoints your
[1:24:29] flesh to dance and to be happy and to
[1:24:31] sing and to rejoice then when you come
[1:24:33] back go back home then the old person
[1:24:35] that lives in you read its ugly head and
[1:24:38] begin to live another life
[1:24:40] so you come to church you are one person
[1:24:42] you are one quick when you go to work or
[1:24:44] you go to you go to the house you are
[1:24:46] another person
[1:24:48] you go smoking you can preach there are
[1:24:50] preachers that smoke
[1:24:52] they can preach with someone you rejoice
[1:24:53] you take you to the seventh dimension
[1:24:56] but they smoke cigarette they drink
[1:24:58] whatever they drink they drink johnny
[1:25:00] walker
[1:25:01] they do whatever they do
[1:25:02] and they are wonderful preachers you
[1:25:04] they are out there
[1:25:06] and they have got big congregation
[1:25:08] and they love money
[1:25:11] they love money that they like their own
[1:25:13] lives
[1:25:14] they want a flight what a jet flight
[1:25:18] they want private whatever
[1:25:20] they are popular and they compete among
[1:25:22] themselves
[1:25:23] for money
[1:25:24] they have money they are very
[1:25:25] influential even in government and
[1:25:27] they're all over the globe
[1:25:29] where do you want to be amen
[1:25:31] you have to make your choice
[1:25:33] amen but god is god of humility he's
[1:25:37] almighty god created all the universe
[1:25:39] but it's very simple

[1:29:42] that's be comfort that is a christ unto
[1:29:44] you amen
[1:29:45] the professor that when a woman is
[1:29:47] married and she wants to say the lord
[1:29:49] the best way to say the lord is do what
[1:29:51] to serve your husband
[1:29:54] and that man should be a noble godly
[1:29:55] person
[1:29:56] if you serve a husband who is an evil
[1:29:59] person he doesn't even appreciate what
[1:30:01] you are doing for him because he doesn't
[1:30:03] have the heart of appreciation
[1:30:04] he doesn't have compassion
[1:30:06] he doesn't have comfort
[1:30:08] but a godly man with christ on the
[1:30:10] inside
[1:30:11] he's a man that fears the lord that this
[1:30:13] lady is part of me is christ and i treat
[1:30:16] her as a treated daughter of god she's
[1:30:18] my wife but she's my sister

[1:30:23] anything ever again say
[1:30:25] amen that is a man that would be a good
[1:30:27] husband to you so he said moreover the
[1:30:30] root rule the moabites

[1:31:22] be like the house of fares whom tama
[1:31:25] bear unto judah of the sea with the lord

[1:31:30] boaz took ruth and she was his wife and

[1:31:34] her conception and she bears son and the
[1:31:36] woman said unto noah me blessed be thou

[1:32:00] sons has borne
[1:32:02] him verse 16 an army to the child and
[1:32:05] lay

[1:32:07] it 17 and the woman her neighbors gave
[1:32:10] it a name saying there is a son born to
[1:32:13] naomi and they call his name obed he is
[1:32:16] the father of jesse the father of david
[1:32:19] now these are the generations of fairies
[1:32:20] faris because hezron has run ram rambi
[1:32:23] cat amina dab
[1:32:32] jesse and jesse begat david and david
[1:32:35] begat who jesus christ
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:39] look at the story how it started
[1:32:42] it started in brokenness
[1:32:44] it started in destruction
[1:32:46] just like the ego story you know the ego
[1:32:48] story how the ego trained the children
[1:32:50] the eaglets
[1:32:52] they live in the nest for some time and
[1:32:54] then there's a time for them to
[1:32:56] try them on solo flight because it's not
[1:32:58] going to feed them all their lives amen
[1:33:01] so what the ego does is it goes through
[1:33:04] a certain far distance and the velocity
[1:33:07] of the ego are forgotten they can move
[1:33:10] very swift and fast at a terrific
[1:33:12] velocity
[1:33:14] and the ego comes and hit the nest let's
[1:33:16] say this is the nest come with that
[1:33:18] speed and hit the nest and all the nest
[1:33:19] is broken
[1:33:20] and however how many children are in
[1:33:22] four or five whatever now they begin to
[1:33:24] scream they are forced because the next
[1:33:26] is not there to hold them they are
[1:33:27] forced to spread spread their wings
[1:33:29] and fly
[1:33:31] and that's where they go through that
[1:33:32] what pain of growth
[1:33:34] amen there's a song that goes like that
[1:33:36] i think you can sing it better life is
[1:33:38] so easy
[1:33:41] when you're up on the mountain
[1:33:43] you've got a peace of mind
[1:33:46] when life's at his best
[1:33:49] but when things change and you are down
[1:33:52] in the valley
[1:33:54] there don't you lose faith
[1:33:56] for you never alone
[1:33:59] god in the good time
[1:34:02] is the god in the bar time
[1:34:05] god of the day
[1:34:07] god of the days to god in the night god
[1:34:10] in the night god on the mountain
[1:34:14] is the god in the valley
[1:34:16] god of the day
[1:34:19] is the god in the night
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:24] so in that time you might think that the
[1:34:26] devil you know the devil no
[1:34:28] is the lord amen is god of light and
[1:34:31] darkness isaiah is his seven somewhere
[1:34:34] five
[1:34:35] he said i bring light i bring war i the
[1:34:38] lord do all these things the devil is
[1:34:40] just the instrument in the hand of the
[1:34:41] lord and you cut the revelation that is
[1:34:43] not the devil is the lord allowing the
[1:34:45] devil to do it you have overcome the
[1:34:47] problem
[1:34:49] because the lord is not destroying you
[1:34:51] but it's bringing attribute out of you
[1:34:53] just like the old time when they used to
[1:34:55] go they don't have the chemicals that we
[1:34:57] have to prefer they go they use a fire
[1:35:00] they use a blacksmith they use hammer
[1:35:02] and fire and hit it get all the
[1:35:06] the the the sand and the dead out of the
[1:35:08] goat so they could see their reflection
[1:35:10] in the gold the same thing god wanted to
[1:35:12] receive his reflection you and i so
[1:35:15] sometimes he let us go through the fire
[1:35:17] go to the water go to the storm to bring
[1:35:20] the attribute that you are not eaglet
[1:35:21] you can fly amen flap your wings of
[1:35:24] faith and fly
[1:35:25] your problem is not everlasting amen
[1:35:28] you've got that faith whatever you have
[1:35:29] in you whatever you need to overcome a
[1:35:32] situation whatever your blessing the
[1:35:34] blessing was planted in you before the
[1:35:36] foundation of the world
[1:35:38] it doesn't matter where it's going to
[1:35:39] come from it's from you amen that that's
[1:35:42] god blesses a brown glory hallelujah oh
[1:35:45] my oh my
[1:35:47] blessed be the lord amen
[1:35:49] the blessing is in you and as you
[1:35:51] believe and water it with faith it comes
[1:35:53] out of you
[1:35:54] it doesn't matter it could be 10 million
[1:35:56] you need for something
[1:35:57] you don't have you might not ever get a
[1:35:59] million that amount of money in your
[1:36:01] life even if you work from age 18 to age
[1:36:04] 60 or 65
[1:36:06] but the lord can't put that money the
[1:36:08] money the faith in you that i need 65
[1:36:10] million dollars
[1:36:11] the lord can put in somebody to bring a
[1:36:13] check to you but i might take 65 million
[1:36:16] dollars
[1:36:17] because it was the fitness in you
[1:36:20] and the lord move on somebody to bring
[1:36:22] it to you
[1:36:23] you might not be able to build a house
[1:36:25] but the lord can let somebody give you a
[1:36:27] house free of charge sunday this is for
[1:36:29] you
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] the lord that's all this blessing is for
[1:36:34] you
[1:36:35] glory hallelujah there's nothing that is
[1:36:37] impossible to the lord i want to read
[1:36:40] one little quote here
[1:36:42] i think
[1:36:43] it's about
[1:36:45] glory hallelujah to the lord find our
[1:36:47] purpose on earth

[1:37:08] has okay and we each one have a life
[1:37:10] that god has given us
[1:37:14] and we must leave it

[1:37:21] no matter whether it's up or down if you
[1:37:24] find gas path and walk in it where god
[1:37:26] has ordained for us to walk

[1:37:31] no matter what and i'll go over again
[1:37:34] and we each one have a life that god has
[1:37:37] given has given us
[1:37:39] and we must live it
[1:37:41] not the life somebody give it to you
[1:37:43] not the life your your friend handed
[1:37:45] over to you
[1:37:46] not the life your boyfriend hand over to
[1:37:48] you or your girlfriend
[1:37:49] not the life that government give it to
[1:37:51] you
[1:37:52] not allowed that gifts unless your
[1:37:53] society give it to you but the life of
[1:37:55] jesus christ for you
[1:37:57] amen
[1:37:59] the life of jesus christ said it's it
[1:38:01] doesn't matter it could be up it could
[1:38:02] be down but leave that life in other
[1:38:05] words don't worry about the earthly
[1:38:06] you're human whether you have money
[1:38:08] would i have the best job whether you
[1:38:10] live in a mansion or living a little
[1:38:12] hood it doesn't matter
[1:38:14] what matters is what live the life the
[1:38:16] lord has given to you
[1:38:18] and when you live that life god has
[1:38:20] redeemed for you no matter what we
[1:38:23] always we find victory
[1:38:25] amen and that's what bring blessing in
[1:38:27] your life when you walk in victorious in
[1:38:29] christ
[1:38:30] amen and you have to find the purpose
[1:38:32] for your life
[1:38:34] it doesn't matter whether you're a child
[1:38:36] you're an adult
[1:38:37] it's not truly to find god's giving
[1:38:38] peoples there was a man
[1:38:41] who never saved the lord until he was 72
[1:38:44] he lived all kind of life
[1:38:46] and at that age he still had a young
[1:38:48] child to raise
[1:38:50] and then he found the lord thankfully
[1:38:52] and the man said that i never saved the
[1:38:54] lord until i'm already old
[1:38:56] so he stopped in that church it was a
[1:38:58] young lady that used to clean the church
[1:39:00] so he stopped the young ladies that you
[1:39:02] and i was supposed to do this work this
[1:39:04] work is mine
[1:39:05] and he took it upon himself to clean the
[1:39:08] church he literally bought the young
[1:39:09] ladies from cleaning the church he will
[1:39:11] go early morning clean the arranged
[1:39:14] chairs and clean the place because he
[1:39:16] said i didn't find the lord early and i
[1:39:17] don't know how much longer i have to
[1:39:19] leave but the little time that i have i
[1:39:22] want to say the lord
[1:39:24] and so it doesn't matter when you find
[1:39:25] your purpose fulfill it amen
[1:39:28] if you find it when you are young live
[1:39:29] by the jew
[1:39:31] fulfill it if you find when you are as
[1:39:32] old as amin methuselah fulfill it amen
[1:39:36] even if you have two days on earth
[1:39:38] fulfill it
[1:39:39] that was a thief at the cross
[1:39:41] he didn't find his purpose early
[1:39:43] but on the cross
[1:39:45] he found his purpose
[1:39:46] he saw a dying lamp
[1:39:49] the lord jesus christ and he saw this he
[1:39:51] saw that this man has got eternal life
[1:39:54] and there was a face in his heart all
[1:39:56] along even in the midst of being a
[1:39:58] criminal being a thief being a robber
[1:40:00] being a gangster
[1:40:02] being whatever he was there was
[1:40:04] something calling out for something but
[1:40:06] he didn't find it early in life
[1:40:08] but right on the cross
[1:40:10] when he had just about maybe a few
[1:40:11] minutes hour to pass on slip on to to
[1:40:13] the other side he said lord remember me
[1:40:17] when you get to glory
[1:40:19] and the lord said that today you'll be
[1:40:21] with me in glory
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:23] if you can find your purpose today you
[1:40:26] have to pray
[1:40:27] you have to fast you have to consecrate
[1:40:29] yourself to the lord
[1:40:30] and the lord will show you what your
[1:40:32] purpose is amen your purpose is tied to
[1:40:36] certain things in your life
[1:40:38] and i'll give a little example
[1:40:40] when i was a kid i used to get sick
[1:40:43] sometimes guess what my mom didn't know
[1:40:44] what to do with me
[1:40:46] but when i grew up when i found this
[1:40:48] message
[1:40:49] i mean the sickness left me
[1:40:51] later on when i became a teenager
[1:40:54] and i found this message i said oh thank
[1:40:55] god so there's a way that can heal me
[1:40:57] without even taking medicine glory
[1:40:59] hallelujah
[1:41:00] i cling to it just like that
[1:41:02] i wouldn't even like medicine when i was
[1:41:04] sick
[1:41:04] there was one time my mom had to call i
[1:41:06] used to i was a young preacher young
[1:41:08] pastor called my deacon that he go talk
[1:41:10] to

[1:41:12] medicine you know my mother's heart
[1:41:14] as a mother my mother you told me when
[1:41:16] we were younger when we were pregnant
[1:41:18] you just pray over water and drink
[1:41:20] and it worked for you do you know what i
[1:41:22] have
[1:41:23] i have the almighty god so when i'm sick
[1:41:25] i need my bible and a message book
[1:41:27] that's it
[1:41:28] it doesn't matter how the sickness the
[1:41:30] lord will heal me
[1:41:32] and when i was thinking for the holy
[1:41:33] ghost but the lord tied something to my
[1:41:35] life
[1:41:36] i used to take breakfast like a normal
[1:41:38] person everybody take breakfast but
[1:41:39] there was some sometime in my life
[1:41:41] that deserve left me
[1:41:43] don't worry all is well blessed be the
[1:41:46] name of the lord amen
[1:41:48] it's just a computer the word of the
[1:41:50] lord is more important so don't worry
[1:41:51] about computer
[1:41:54] the word will continue amen
[1:41:57] so i begin to pray and seeking for the
[1:42:00] holy ghost and the lord did it
[1:42:01] intentionally
[1:42:02] i was praying and said when will i ever
[1:42:04] get the holy ghost was it for me or it's
[1:42:06] not for me
[1:42:07] i've been praying and fasting and my
[1:42:09] pastor was the strictest of the streets
[1:42:12] it's about rapture the holy ghost
[1:42:14] eternal life
[1:42:15] you don't mess with him so
[1:42:18] so when you prayed and you think oh like
[1:42:19] i'm anointed you go to church and you
[1:42:21] fire message do you have the holy ghost
[1:42:23] i don't care whether you are my wife or
[1:42:25] you are my whatever when the rapture
[1:42:26] comes it's your holy ghost in you it's
[1:42:29] not my holy ghost and if you don't have
[1:42:30] the holy ghost the catholic church will
[1:42:32] come and find you and you know what will
[1:42:34] happen to you
[1:42:35] so lord
[1:42:37] when will i get the holy ghost
[1:42:38] so for a span of like a year one day the
[1:42:40] lord showed me a vision
[1:42:42] and i saw the lord jesus christ himself
[1:42:44] in a in a vision in a night vision
[1:42:47] and the lord begged me to come up higher
[1:42:49] he didn't come to the earth
[1:42:51] and i went all the way but i didn't get
[1:42:53] to where he was
[1:42:54] like three times he just beckoned me
[1:42:56] with his hands say lord i don't have it
[1:42:58] and i prayed and fasted all the more
[1:43:00] and there's another time i had the same
[1:43:02] dream and i was just caught up where he
[1:43:04] was say glory hallelujah
[1:43:07] and she became part of my life breakfast
[1:43:08] was
[1:43:10] sleep of my life
[1:43:12] maybe a year i might take breakfast
[1:43:14] let's say three times
[1:43:15] maybe 10 times
[1:43:17] it's just not part of me if i take
[1:43:19] breakfast it messes me it messes me up
[1:43:22] one time i was going to preach in mexico
[1:43:24] and the family they wanted to you know
[1:43:25] find out what you eat and get you the
[1:43:27] best breakfast to make you comfortable

[1:43:30] what
[1:43:31] what should we prepare for
