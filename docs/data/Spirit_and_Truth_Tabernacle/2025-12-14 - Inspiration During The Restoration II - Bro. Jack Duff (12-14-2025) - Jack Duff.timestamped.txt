[37:42] heart?" She said, "No."
[37:45] I said, "Uh, please." She said, "No."
[37:51] So I put my hands on her head. I said,
[37:52] "Lord,
[37:54] stir up something in her soul."
[37:57] She brought something out. Praise the
[38:00] Lord. God bless you, Sister Tina.
[38:04] And that's my sister. That's my sister.
[38:06] Praise the Lord.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[38:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, stand to your feet.
[38:35] God ain't in no hurry.

[43:31] you.
[43:33] Praise God.
[43:38] Amen. He's working out his best for you.
[43:41] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[43:45] My my my my.
[43:49] Thank God.
[43:52] Thank God.
[43:55] Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I uh
[44:02] &gt;&gt; certainly uh thank God for the specials
[44:05] and uh brother Solomon song leading the
[44:09] musicians. Appreciate each one in their
[44:11] respective places.
[44:13] Uh
[44:15] we'll go back to scripture reading
[44:19] uh for this morning out of Jeremiah 29.
[44:23] Amen.
[44:25] My my my my
[44:28] thank you Jesus.
[44:33] Um
[44:35] we last uh spoke on this um topic of
[44:40] inspiration during the restoration and I
[44:44] want to just kind of go forward uh in
[44:47] this. Jeremiah 29 is a one of those life
[44:52] For a lot of Christians, they turn to
[44:54] this chapter, especially when they get
[44:56] to verse um 11. And you know, it's kind
[45:00] of like Romans 8:28 kind of falls in
[45:03] that same category. Uh Jeremiah 29:11 is
[45:07] one of those life verses. And so many
[45:09] people uh you know, refer to it, which
[45:12] you know, I have used it, I will
[45:14] continue to use it as a life verse for
[45:17] me. But uh we must understand that
[45:20] there's greater meaning amen behind
[45:24] this. And uh I want to start at verse 10
[45:27] because we get the greater meaning as we
[45:30] start at verse 10. says, "For thus
[45:32] sayeth the Lord, that after 70 years be
[45:36] accomplished at Babylon,
[45:38] I will visit you and perform my good
[45:43] word toward you and causing you to
[45:46] return to this place.
[45:49] Uh, for I know the thoughts that I think
[45:52] toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of
[45:56] peace and not of evil, to give you an
[46:00] expected end. Then shall ye call upon
[46:04] me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
[46:06] and I will hearken unto you, and ye
[46:09] shall seek me, and find me when ye shall
[46:11] search me with all your heart. Uh, and I
[46:16] will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord,
[46:20] and I will turn away your captivity, and
[46:23] I will gather you from all the nations
[46:25] and from all the places whether I have
[46:27] driven you, sayeth the Lord, and I will
[46:30] bring you again into the place I cause
[46:32] you to be carried away captive. Uh,
[46:35] because you have said, "The Lord hath
[46:38] raised up prophets in Babylon."
[46:43] Amen. The Lord hath raised us up
[46:47] prophets in Babylon.
[46:50] Amen. And Babylon is a place of
[46:52] confusion.
[46:54] So the very need for a prophet is to
[46:57] kind of establish you uh to bring you
[47:00] out of that place of confusion. It's
[47:02] very important that we listen to
[47:05] prophets. Amen. Very important. So uh
[47:09] let us have a word of prayer. Uh father
[47:10] we just thank you for this uh privilege
[47:15] to read the word. We know it takes the
[47:17] Holy Spirit to help us to uh understand
[47:20] what is being spoken to us in the word.
[47:23] So God we ask that you would just take
[47:26] control of our thoughts, those that are
[47:28] being presented, those that have been
[47:29] received and may you get all the glory
[47:32] from this portion of the service. Thank
[47:34] you for all that has happened thus far
[47:36] and I pray your continued blessings upon
[47:38] our gathering. In Jesus name we pray.
[47:40] Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be
[47:42] seated. Uh before I get started in this,
[47:45] I I I wanted to uh apologize to sister
[47:49] Sana. We forgot her birthday last week.
[47:52] Amen. We didn't announce it, but she had
[47:53] a birthday on last Monday. Amen. Happy
[47:57] birthday to Sister Sana.
[48:00] So, I believe her and Sister Nelly share
[48:02] birthdays. Is that right? Cuz Sister
[48:04] Nelly had a birthday Monday, too. So we
[48:06] thank God for giving them both another
[48:08] year. Amen.
[48:11] Amen. All right. So we we want to um um
[48:16] continue forward in this thought and you
[48:18] know they they they they were singing
[48:20] the song sister Tina you know song of
[48:23] song I don't mind waiting and then uh
[48:25] brother Solomon uh decided to follow it
[48:28] up with uh God ain't in no hurry. and uh
[48:32] you know and I didn't I didn't connect
[48:34] the dots until I was kind of you know
[48:38] meditating on what I was getting ready
[48:39] to say but this quote that I read for
[48:41] you all uh at the opening of this um
[48:46] this sermon the last time we preached I
[48:48] want to reread it again and you'll see
[48:50] how both of those songs connect right to
[48:52] this quote and uh it's out of the the
[48:54] sermon possessing the enemy's gates amen
[48:57] brother Brandham uh tells us there Um it
[49:02] says it was only a few years later when
[49:05] the trials come and the church got all
[49:08] shook up as is so easy for a
[49:11] congregation of people to do when
[49:14] something just don't seem to happen uh
[49:17] the way that it's supposed to be. It's
[49:19] the very first one there um uh in the
[49:22] way that it's supposed to be. God makes
[49:24] it that way. God brings tensions into
[49:28] the church. He says, "And every son that
[49:31] cometh to God must be tried and proven
[49:36] and tested."
[49:38] Amen. God brings tension into the
[49:41] church. Hallelujah. Because every son
[49:43] that cometh to God must be tried and
[49:46] proven and tested. God knows that ain't
[49:48] that ain't nothing but the truth. He
[49:50] says he let sickness strike you. He lets
[49:53] disease come on you to test uh you and
[49:57] prove you. It's that it's the very first
[50:00] quote on the on the page says uh and uh
[50:03] to he says to test you and to prove you
[50:05] to show the world that you're truly the
[50:08] seed of Abraham.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; My God. So I go through all this so God
[50:15] can show the world that I really am who
[50:18] I say I am.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; That I'm truly the seed of Abraham. And
[50:22] and when when we when we think about
[50:24] Abraham, you know, when we we sing the
[50:26] song, God in in a hurry, that man was uh
[50:29] the epitome of uh of demonstrating that
[50:32] God was not in a hurry.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, he had a promise and had to wait
[50:37] 25 years for the promise to be
[50:40] fulfilled. Now, here's the thing about
[50:41] Abraham. Good God almighty, the Bible
[50:44] does not say that Abraham complained
[50:46] while he waited.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but the scripture says
[50:50] that he was strong in faith and he was
[50:53] giving glory to God. Amen. He was he was
[50:56] all he was like praising God in advance
[50:58] for what was getting ready to happen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And church, rather than us complaining
[51:02] about our trials and complaining about
[51:03] our test, let us start worshiping God in
[51:06] advance for what he's getting ready to
[51:07] do.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; How do we know he's getting ready to do
[51:10] something? Because he said his word, I
[51:13] know
[51:14] &gt;&gt; the plans that I have for you.
[51:17] Prayers to prosper you.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Prayers to give you hope and a future.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT WHAT GOD IS SAYING. I
[51:23] KNOW YOU AIN'T GOING TO STAY IN THE
[51:25] PLACE you in. Amen. Forever. YOU'RE
[51:28] GOING TO COME OUT of this
[51:30] &gt;&gt; somehow someway. YOU'RE COMING OUT OF
[51:33] THIS PLACE.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SO, so we got to learn how
[51:39] to just worship God because God is
[51:41] getting glory in the midst of everything
[51:43] we're going through. If Abraham had not
[51:45] gone through the things he he went
[51:47] through, we would never have we would
[51:49] never be able to get strength from the
[51:51] the stories that that that are told
[51:52] about him.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But here in this in this quote, it
[51:55] says this um he says uh he he God makes
[51:59] it that way. God brings tensions into
[52:01] the church. For every son that cometh to
[52:03] God must be tried and proven and tested.
[52:05] He lets sickness strike you. He lets
[52:07] diseases come on you to test you and to
[52:10] prove you to show the world that you're
[52:13] truly the seed of Abraham. He permits it
[52:16] by his own will. He permits disasters.
[52:18] He permits the friends to turn against
[52:20] you. He permits all these things and
[52:22] turns the devil loose to tempt you. And
[52:24] he'll do all but take your life. He
[52:27] could throw you on a bed of affliction.
[52:29] He could turn your neighbors against
[52:31] you. He could turn the church against
[52:33] you. He can do almost anything. And it's
[52:35] God's will for him to do it. We are
[52:37] taught that it is more precious than
[52:40] gold to us. I I believe that. I thank
[52:43] God. And I have to be encouraged by my
[52:45] own son. God ain't in no hurry.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; God ain't in no hurry.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I He
[52:53] going to bring us through.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gonna bring us through.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; We'll come out in a wealthy place.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; My God.
[53:04] Let us see. Let's um as we were just you
[53:08] know um re rehearsing some of the things
[53:11] that we mentioned again people go back
[53:14] to Jeremiah 29:11 where it says for I
[53:17] know the thoughts that I think toward
[53:18] you.
[53:20] Uh sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and
[53:22] not of evil to give you an expected end.
[53:25] as I was uh just looking at AI, I mean
[53:29] actually Google searching just saying
[53:31] what are some of the things people
[53:32] what's a devotion around this because
[53:34] there's so many devotions written on
[53:36] this and and uh when you're looking at
[53:38] Jeremiah 29:11 some of the things it
[53:40] said in that is you got to be able to
[53:41] trust God's timing. Um I don't mind
[53:44] waiting.
[53:46] So you got to be able to trust God's
[53:47] timing. Uh God's timing is different
[53:50] from our timing. And and I'll be honest,
[53:53] I'll be the first one to admit my time
[53:54] and I want things to be done.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I guess some of y'all in the same boat
[54:01] that that I'm in. You we be wanting
[54:04] things to happen right now,
[54:06] &gt;&gt; brother. Wait for how long, bro? I I I
[54:09] couldn't even wait at McDonald's. I
[54:11] mean, it's it's fast food. It need to be
[54:13] ready. I And I done been I had to repent
[54:16] sometime. I mean, you know, y'all ain't
[54:18] got I went one time, they didn't have no
[54:20] ice cream. How can you not have ice
[54:22] cream at McDonald's? You know, people
[54:24] come in here for ice cream. I was I was
[54:26] hot.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And then you get there, you have to wait
[54:30] on something. Wait. I mean, we don't we
[54:32] don't you know what happens IS THAT WITH
[54:34] THIS FAST FOOD INDUSTRY and everything
[54:36] that happens so instantly, we we don't
[54:38] want to wait on nothing.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; And and it actually affects us as
[54:43] Christians.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; It really impacts us as Christians
[54:45] because if we can't wait on just little
[54:47] things, then how we going to be able to
[54:48] wait on God? That's right.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but but we got to BE
[54:52] ABLE TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING and we have
[54:54] to endure through suffering.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; The other thing says we got to be able
[54:58] to surrender control. And and and and I
[55:01] love that because after we administered
[55:02] on that, brother brother uh Nathan comes
[55:05] right in and says that uh the power of
[55:07] committ.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Lord knows that message was from me.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Being able to just commit something to
[55:12] God and just let leave it alone. Don't
[55:14] even worry about it no more.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't don't look out once
[55:18] you put that seed in the ground. Don't
[55:19] go look to see the thing growing. It is
[55:21] growing, but you got to let it do it
[55:23] what what the way it does it.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just keep watering it with
[55:27] praises.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be able to trust God's
[55:30] time and and do it through suffering and
[55:32] surrender control. All right. But when
[55:35] we look at this and as I and I started
[55:37] reading there a little early, I started
[55:39] reading at verse 10 because um this was
[55:42] this this scripture that that Jeremiah
[55:45] uh 29:11 is following. Verse 10 goes
[55:48] before it and it's talking about them
[55:50] going into uh uh Babylon for 70 years.
[55:53] That was a prophecy that Jeremiah gave
[55:55] them. But Jeremiah also bought property
[55:58] in Israel because he knew at after 70
[56:02] years God was going to bring them back.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; God Jeremiah had complete confidence
[56:07] that God was going to bring Israel back.
[56:08] It was a time of restoration.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After the 70 years was up,
[56:14] it was a time of restoration. And the
[56:16] other thing that that Jeremiah said in
[56:18] verse uh verse 15 says because ye have
[56:21] said the Lord hath raised us up prophets
[56:25] in Babylon. I think this is important.
[56:29] This is important that God has raised up
[56:31] us raised US UP PROPHETS IN BABYLON. THE
[56:34] THE THING OF THE thing about uh God
[56:36] using a prophet is because brother
[56:38] Random teaches the word of the Lord
[56:39] comes to a prophet.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Right. AND AND WHEN GOD IS TRYING TO
[56:43] REESTABLISH SOMETHING, he has to, you
[56:45] know, he has to give it to a prophet. I
[56:47] MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT uh just even the
[56:49] the the church world and today, my God,
[56:52] hallelujah, you ain't got to look too
[56:54] far.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT THE CHURCH world and WHERE
[56:57] WE ARE TODAY. GOD HAS TO USE A PROPHET
[57:00] TO ESTABLISH WHERE THE PEOPLE SUPPOSED
[57:02] TO BE IN GOD.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; THE THINGS THAT THEY REALLY SHOULD BE
[57:06] CHASING AFTER.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WAY THAT THE THE THE THE
[57:10] POSITION THAT THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO
[57:12] BE IN.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, GOD USES A PROPHET TO
[57:15] REESTABLISH THOSE THINGS. OTHERWISE,
[57:17] WE'LL BE JUST GOING ALONG WITH THE FLOW.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; My God. LIKE, LIKE BROTHER SMILEY SAY,
[57:23] JUST EVERYBODY GET IN CHURCH AND THE big
[57:25] thing NOW IS JUST JUMP WHILE YOU'RE IN
[57:26] THE PULL PIT. WHY? WHY WE GOT TO DO ALL
[57:29] OF THAT?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; NOW, I DON'T MIND A little dance here
[57:32] and there, BUT BUT EVERY SERVICE IS A
[57:34] JUMP. SOMETHING AND AND WHERE'S IT GOING
[57:37] TO MOVE TO FROM THERE?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; We got TO GO TO CHURCH AND WE NEED
[57:42] LIGHTS TO TRY TO GET THE PEOPLE TO MAKE
[57:43] IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE IN A CLUB.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE
[57:49] CHURCH.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; NO, THE CHURCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE
[57:52] DIFFERENT.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH ARE SUPPOSED TO
[57:56] BE DIFFERENT.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAS TO USE A PROPHET TO
[58:01] ESTABLISH THEM PRINCIPLES ALL OVER
[58:03] AGAIN. YES, SIR.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, now when we look at, you know,
[58:06] some of this today, we're going to see
[58:07] that, you know, uh I don't think even in
[58:11] in in in in my time of study and uh I
[58:14] don't think I ever really kind of put
[58:16] these these these these uh things
[58:18] together because um uh one of the
[58:21] prophets that was that was raised up
[58:24] during this time while they were in
[58:25] exile, one of the prophets was the
[58:27] prophet Malachi.
[58:30] very important prophet
[58:32] &gt;&gt; and and you know there were there was
[58:33] other prophets we got Ezra and Nehemiah
[58:35] and Hagi and Zechariah ALL THEM BUT
[58:38] MALACHI IS ALSO A PROPHET THAT IS USED
[58:40] during this time. Oh hallelujah.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and and you know we
[58:46] going to we're going to you know get get
[58:48] there uh at some point in time. There's
[58:50] a few things I want to talk about but uh
[58:53] but Malachi
[58:55] Amen. We being being message believers,
[58:58] we understand Malachi EVEN PROPHESIED
[59:02] ABOUT WHERE WE'RE LIVING AT TODAY.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND AND GOD RAISED UP THIS
[59:09] MAN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO BE ABLE TO
[59:11] KIND OF HELP THE PEOPLE COME BACK TO
[59:13] CERTAIN TRUTHS THAT THEY HAD FORGOT
[59:16] ABOUT. OH MY GOD. MY GOD. GOD ALWAYS
[59:20] USES A PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK
[59:22] TO TRUTH.
[59:24] OH YES, LORD.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THAT'S THE VERY PURPOSE
[59:28] OF A PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO
[59:31] TRUTH. REESTABLISH WHAT WAS ALREADY
[59:34] THERE.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, you want TO KNOW WHAT A PROPHET
[59:37] SAY? BECAUSE GOD VINDICATES what a
[59:39] prophet say.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Now, now you know I I I I read this out
[59:45] of my Thomas Thomas Nelson Bible. um the
[59:50] uh
[59:51] uh the the setting of the book of Ezra.
[59:54] And because there this Jeremiah kind of
[59:56] connects to Ezra and um you know, we're
[59:58] going to kind of look at that a little
[1:00:00] bit. I want to go to maybe Ezra chapter
[1:00:03] five in a little bit. Uh and we'll yeah,
[1:00:05] we'll we'll we'll read that. But this
[1:00:07] study, Amen. here in um in Ezra, and
[1:00:10] I'll just start reading from verse one
[1:00:12] because I want to pick up some things
[1:00:14] here. But this historical setting in the
[1:00:16] book of Ezra, the setting of Ezra is the
[1:00:19] post exilelic era is what they're
[1:00:21] saying. And it says um when the faithful
[1:00:25] Israelites were were returning from
[1:00:27] Babylon to Judah so they could
[1:00:29] reestablish the temple worship, the
[1:00:32] temple and the temple worship are vital
[1:00:34] subjects in all the books written during
[1:00:37] the post exilelic period which is after
[1:00:39] exile after they were in Babylon for 70
[1:00:42] years. That's post exile. A after the
[1:00:44] exile he says um 1 and 2 Coronicles was
[1:00:48] written there. Ezra, the book of Ezra,
[1:00:50] the book of book of Nehemiah, book of
[1:00:52] Hagi, book of Zechariah and Malachi. All
[1:00:55] these were uh books written, Amen. in
[1:00:57] the post exile exileic period. It says
[1:01:00] the people who returned to the land of
[1:01:02] promise were publicly acknowledging that
[1:01:05] they believe God would reestablish the
[1:01:08] nation and usher in a a time of kingdom
[1:01:10] blessing. They believe that God would
[1:01:14] reestablish the nation and ush in a time
[1:01:17] of kingdom blessing. Now, now we we're
[1:01:19] looking at this, but you you realize
[1:01:21] Amen. I believe it was 1948,
[1:01:25] if that's right, uh where um you know,
[1:01:28] Israel was reestablished as a nation,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; right? And it was also AT THE SAME TIME
[1:01:33] THAT God was raising up a prophet here
[1:01:35] in US AND SENDING HIM OUT. HE WAS BEING
[1:01:39] VISITED BY AN ANGEL WHILE ISRAEL IS
[1:01:41] BEING REESTABLISHED AS A NATION. LOOK AT
[1:01:43] HOW ALL THIS CONNECTS.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. AND WHY WAS GOD RAISING
[1:01:49] UP THIS PROPHET HERE IN THE US? AMEN. IS
[1:01:52] ORDER TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE
[1:01:54] WORD.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE RESTORATION IS ALL
[1:01:58] ABOUT. WHEN WE SAY GET BACK IN STEP, WE
[1:02:01] TALKING ABOUT GET BACK IN STEP WITH THE
[1:02:04] WORD.
[1:02:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:09] GLORY TO GOD. AND GOD HAS TO USE A
[1:02:11] PROPHET TO BRING THE PEOPLE BACK IN STEP
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; with the word of God.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Now look at this. There was three
[1:02:18] returns from Babylon just like there
[1:02:21] were three deportations to Babylon.
[1:02:24] Amen. God God is perfected in threes.
[1:02:27] And uh so the first return was led by
[1:02:30] Zerubbabel
[1:02:32] also. uh that was the rebuilding of the
[1:02:35] temple which was vital for that group.
[1:02:37] The second return was under Ezra, Ezra's
[1:02:40] leadership. And uh in 458 BC, the people
[1:02:43] needed reforming. They needed to return
[1:02:46] to their covenant obligations. Now, now
[1:02:48] listen, listen at that statement. The
[1:02:50] people needed reforming. So, and they
[1:02:54] needed to return to their covenant
[1:02:57] obligations. And we're going to get into
[1:02:59] something in a little bit. covenant
[1:03:02] obligations.
[1:03:04] The people needed reforming and they
[1:03:07] needed to return to their covenant
[1:03:10] obligations.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now, now I'm I'm going
[1:03:14] just go ahead and say this a little
[1:03:15] ahead of time. Malachi
[1:03:18] helped the people to reform
[1:03:21] and also help the people to come back to
[1:03:24] a covenant obligation. THERE'S A COUPLE
[1:03:26] THINGS MALACHI TALKED ABOUT that I want
[1:03:29] to get into. One of them, amen, is a
[1:03:31] very obvious one. Tithing.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; BUT ALSO MALACHI dealt with marriage and
[1:03:39] divorce.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MALACHI, AMEN, TOLD THEM HOW
[1:03:44] GOD HATED DIVORCE.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO, THEY NEEDED TO RETURN TO
[1:03:49] COVENANT OBLIGATIONS. WE WE AS A PEOPLE
[1:03:51] ALSO NEED TO RETURN TO COVENANT
[1:03:54] OBLIGATIONS. WE NEED TO HONOR GOD AND
[1:03:57] HONOR HIS WORD IN ALL OF OUR DECISIONS.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; The people needed reform and under Ezra,
[1:04:06] Ezra's return when he's leading the
[1:04:07] people back in that second uh return to
[1:04:10] to to to Judah says the people needed
[1:04:12] reform and they needed to return to
[1:04:14] their covenant obligations. The third
[1:04:15] return was led by Nehemiah. Now, let's
[1:04:19] go and pick up Ezra uh chapter five.
[1:04:23] Hallelujah.
[1:04:25] and we'll just read
[1:04:27] uh here.
[1:04:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I tell
[1:04:31] you the truth, this is uh
[1:04:34] um
[1:04:36] a real blessing to me. I I I thank God
[1:04:39] for it. I thank God for it. Ezra chapter
[1:04:42] 5
[1:04:45] and uh starting at verse one. Let me
[1:04:48] just catch something here.
[1:04:55] So Ezra is leading the people
[1:04:58] back to uh you know Judah and as they're
[1:05:03] you know we're going to see some some
[1:05:04] various things. You know we talked about
[1:05:06] how God allows tension and we're going
[1:05:08] to see some tension rise up uh kind of
[1:05:12] here in um in this. But the other thing
[1:05:15] I want you to kind of catch is, you
[1:05:17] know, just just these different prophets
[1:05:19] that God is using that he's speaking
[1:05:21] through uh during this time of post
[1:05:24] exile. So the very def says it says then
[1:05:27] the prophets
[1:05:29] Haggi the prophet and Zachchariah
[1:05:33] the son of uh the son of Ido prophesied
[1:05:37] unto uh the Jews that were in Judah and
[1:05:41] Jerusalem in the name of the God of
[1:05:44] Israel and unto them even unto them.
[1:05:47] Then rose up Zerubbabel, the son of uh
[1:05:51] Shaltiel, and Juhua, the son of um
[1:05:56] Joedc, and began to build the house of
[1:05:58] God, which is at Jerusalem. And with
[1:06:01] them were the prophets of God, helping
[1:06:03] them. I I I like this because of, you
[1:06:05] know, the these these leaders, these
[1:06:07] prophets, they were involved in the
[1:06:09] building, you know, of the temple,
[1:06:11] right? And the reestablishing, not just
[1:06:13] reestablish it, but just with their
[1:06:15] words and what was coming their mouth.
[1:06:16] But they they picking up bricks, too. Uh
[1:06:19] they putting some mortar on the
[1:06:21] building, too. They they were they were
[1:06:22] they were all in, if I can just put it
[1:06:25] that way. They were all in. Hallelujah.
[1:06:28] It says um it says at the same time came
[1:06:31] to them Tatana governor on this side of
[1:06:34] the river and Sheth uh Shethar Bernay
[1:06:39] and their companions and said thus unto
[1:06:42] them who hath commanded you to build
[1:06:44] this house and to make up this wall. Now
[1:06:47] here's the tension that is starting to
[1:06:49] come in
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; now. Who who who y'all to start doing
[1:06:52] this? Who who who who gave y'all this
[1:06:54] authority, right? Hallelujah. It says,
[1:06:58] "Then we said unto them after this
[1:07:00] manner,
[1:07:02] uh uh what are the names of the men that
[1:07:05] make this building?" Now, this just this
[1:07:08] just the enemy that's coming in against
[1:07:10] them. Who they want to get who who
[1:07:11] responsible for this? Now, you got
[1:07:13] sometimes you got to know how to how to
[1:07:15] answer the devil.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Look at this. He says, "But the eye of
[1:07:20] their God was upon the elders of the
[1:07:23] Jews that they could not cause them to
[1:07:26] cease to the matter came to Darius." And
[1:07:30] then they returned answer by letter
[1:07:32] concerning this concerning this matter.
[1:07:35] the copy of the letters that Tatnai
[1:07:37] governor on this side of the river and
[1:07:40] um Shethar Bonsni and his companions and
[1:07:46] uh a farite
[1:07:49] my God that's a good one aarites
[1:07:53] all right praise God which um which were
[1:07:57] on this side the river sent unto Darius
[1:08:00] a king they sent a letter unto him
[1:08:02] wherein was written thus unto Darius the
[1:08:05] king. All peace be it known unto the
[1:08:08] king that we went into the province of
[1:08:11] Judea to the house of the great God
[1:08:13] which is buildth with great stones and
[1:08:16] timbers laid in the walls and this work
[1:08:18] goeth fast on and prosperth in their
[1:08:21] hands once they got started. God just
[1:08:23] began to bless it
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; and even the enemy recognized that they
[1:08:26] were being blessed.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this now. Glory to
[1:08:30] God. And now what they're doing is
[1:08:32] they're trying to actually stop the
[1:08:33] work. This this tension that they're
[1:08:35] that they're bringing against the the
[1:08:36] Jews, they're trying to stop the work.
[1:08:38] But let me let me help you to understand
[1:08:40] something. When God has prophesied that
[1:08:42] there would be a restoration, there's no
[1:08:45] enemy that can stop it.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know if we get that. I
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; if if IF THERE IF GOD HAS PROMISED TO
[1:08:54] RESTORE YOUR FAMILY, THERE IS NO ENEMY
[1:08:59] THAT CAN STOP THAT,
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. THEY CAN TRY TO DELAY THIS AND
[1:09:03] THEY CAN TRY TO DELAY THAT. IT DOES NOT
[1:09:06] MATTER. HALLELUJAH. GOD GOING TO BRING
[1:09:09] IT TO PASS. HIS WORD MUST BE FULFILLED.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Ver verse 8 says, "Being
[1:09:17] known unto the king that we went into
[1:09:20] the province of Judea to the house of
[1:09:22] the great God which is builded with
[1:09:24] great stones and timbers laid in the
[1:09:26] walls and and this work goeth fast on
[1:09:29] and prosperth in their hands." Then ask
[1:09:32] me those elders and said unto unto them,
[1:09:34] "Thus who commanded you to build this
[1:09:38] house and to make up THESE WALLS?" WHO
[1:09:41] COMMANDED YOU to do that? He says, he
[1:09:43] said, 'We asked their names also to
[1:09:45] certify them that we might write their
[1:09:48] na write the names of the men that were
[1:09:51] the chief of them. AND THUS they
[1:09:54] returned uh a us an answer, saying, WE
[1:09:58] ARE THE SERVANTS OF the God of heaven
[1:10:01] and earth, AND BUILD THE HOUSE THAT WAS
[1:10:04] BUILD it these many years ago, which a
[1:10:07] great king of Israel build it, and set
[1:10:09] up. Notice they did not give them their
[1:10:11] names. Hallelujah. Because their name
[1:10:14] REALLY DIDN'T MATTER. THEY WERE ACTUALLY
[1:10:16] JUST A PART OF A A A PROPHECY.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; They were there to fulfill a prophecy.
[1:10:22] Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell YOU, YOU ALSO HERE TO
[1:10:26] FULFILL A PROPHECY.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON THIS EARTH
[1:10:31] THAT WOULD BE A BELIEVER.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY HE COULD SAY IN
[1:10:36] MALACHI,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU." HEY,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE COMING OF
[1:10:45] THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE DAY OF THE LORD.
[1:10:47] HE DIDN'T PUT MY NAME THERE, BUT I KNOW
[1:10:50] I'M IDENTIFIED
[1:10:52] RIGHT THERE IN THAT SCRIPTURE. MALACHI
[1:10:56] SPOKE OF ME.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Verse verse uh
[1:11:06] uh uh uh verse 12. But after that our
[1:11:10] fathers had provoked the god of heaven
[1:11:12] unto wrath, he gave them into the hand
[1:11:15] of Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:11:17] the king of Babylon, the Chaldim, who
[1:11:20] destroyed this house and carried the
[1:11:23] people away into Babylon. So now before
[1:11:25] we go further because I I'll read a
[1:11:27] little bit more but before we go further
[1:11:29] in that I want to just kind of bring in
[1:11:31] now now just in that that verse right
[1:11:34] there Nebuchadnezzar
[1:11:36] in Babylon that lets us know a couple
[1:11:39] other people were involved in this in
[1:11:41] scripture during this time period.
[1:11:44] Daniel will be one of the ones that was
[1:11:46] involved in this time period. Oh Lord
[1:11:48] help us right here. Uh another is the
[1:11:50] three Hebrew boys. And when we talk
[1:11:53] about tension,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; both Daniel and the Hebrew boys had
[1:11:59] tension.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And God wasn't in no hurry.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW JUST WHEN to move.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND IF GOD WOULD BRING
[1:12:08] DANIEL OUT AND GOD WOULD BRING THEM
[1:12:11] HEBREW BOYS OUT, GOD IS AL ALSO GOING TO
[1:12:14] BRING YOU OUT.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; BE ENCOURAGED, CHURCH.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL BRING YOU OUT. AMEN.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Let me just kind of uh pick up uh
[1:12:25] something here. Amen. A couple quotes
[1:12:27] that I'd like to read. My God.
[1:12:30] Hallelujah. Uh Christ is Christ is
[1:12:33] revealed in his own word. And and one of
[1:12:35] the things that we'll catch here is
[1:12:37] because in in uh in the days of
[1:12:39] Nebuchadnezzar there there was a lot
[1:12:41] that happened but one one particular
[1:12:43] incident was uh Nebuchadnezzar they they
[1:12:46] they decided to have a a a little get
[1:12:50] together little party and not only did
[1:12:52] they they they they went a little
[1:12:55] further than where they should have
[1:12:56] gone. Hallelujah. As they got to
[1:12:58] drinking, they decided to bring the
[1:13:01] sacred cups of God out
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and began to drink from the sacred cups
[1:13:06] of God. Let me also tell you that you
[1:13:08] shouldn't even be drinking.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew made a comment on on on
[1:13:13] on Wednesday night and and I meant to I
[1:13:16] meant to come back up and say something
[1:13:17] about it, but it slipped my mind. But
[1:13:19] I'mma say it now.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Brother brother, HE HE QUOTED A QUOTE
[1:13:22] WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "A EVIL
[1:13:24] SPIRIT OF DRINKING
[1:13:28] HE SAID AN EVIL SPIRIT OF DRINKING. SO
[1:13:31] ANYBODY GET CONNECTED TO SPIRITS
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM
[1:13:37] SPIRITS.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, IT'S A EVIL SPIRIT THAT FOLLOWS
[1:13:42] THAT.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO THE LAMB OF GOD.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT ONLY WERE PROPHETS NOT
[1:13:49] SUPPOSED TO BE DRINKING IN THE BOTTLE,
[1:13:51] WE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS EITHER.
[1:13:54] NOT AS BELIEVERS.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T SMOKE. WE DON'T DRINK.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN EVIL SPIRIT THAT FOLLOWS THAT.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I I was shocked. Somebody told me
[1:14:08] recently
[1:14:10] say, uh, my wife went to get herself a
[1:14:13] little something. Went to a wedding. She
[1:14:15] went to get herself a, you know, she saw
[1:14:17] what was out there and she said, "Now
[1:14:19] that that's that that that's a clear
[1:14:21] drink, but it I don't know what it is,
[1:14:22] but it ain't it ain't Sprite."
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; She say, "I better not get that." Then
[1:14:27] she said herself, "I'm not going to even
[1:14:29] get Sprite because I don't want nobody
[1:14:32] to mistake my Sprite for that drink
[1:14:34] right there."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I and I I I appreciate
[1:14:39] that. But but I Somebody was coming up
[1:14:41] talking to I said, "Yeah, she over there
[1:14:42] getting herself a a Selza water and and
[1:14:46] uh and uh some um cranberry juice." So I
[1:14:50] say, "Oh, she getting something clean."
[1:14:53] I say,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; "You getting she getting something
[1:14:56] clean?" And then say, "I don't want
[1:14:58] nothing clean tonight."
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; And you going to go to church tomorrow
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; and say, "You believe this?" No. No.
[1:15:07] This message produces a difference.
[1:15:10] WE DON'T DO THIS TYPE OF STUFF as
[1:15:12] believers.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; AND AS MY WIFE WAS SITTING THERE TALKING
[1:15:15] TO THE BARTENDER, GETTING HER A LITTLE
[1:15:17] DRINK, THE MAN SAY, "Do you?" He said,
[1:15:18] "I can make you whatever you want. I can
[1:15:20] do you this. I can say, "No, I don't do
[1:15:21] that. I don't do that. Just give me
[1:15:22] Selza water and uh cranberry juice." So,
[1:15:26] you don't drink a little bit? No. Just
[1:15:29] on special occasions?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Say you at weddings?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; She say, "I don't drink. I don't drink
[1:15:38] at all." He said, "Now, I know this may
[1:15:40] sound strange.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He say, "I'm a bartender, BUT I DON'T
[1:15:44] DRINK EITHER."
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; WHAT A REBUKE TO THE SAINTS.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; THE VERY MAN IN HERE SERVING THE DRINKS,
[1:15:54] DON'T EVEN DRINK, AND NOT EVEN A
[1:15:56] CHRISTIAN.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT A REBUKE TO THE SAINTS.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I might as well say these things
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; that I I Lord have mercy. If you plan on
[1:16:04] doing all that drinking at your wedding,
[1:16:06] don't invite me.
[1:16:08] Don't don't invite me.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Please don't invite me.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; When when my daughter got married, we
[1:16:13] actually paid extra
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; so that they would not serve drinks.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; We paid extra so they would not serve
[1:16:23] drinks. Didn't even want to tempt the
[1:16:26] saints.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me get back to my subject.
[1:16:36] But we got to, you know, you just got to
[1:16:38] know where you stand at in this message
[1:16:39] cuz people people got all kind of things
[1:16:41] and they justify No, no, no, no. I I
[1:16:43] don't care how you just I ain't
[1:16:45] drinking.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; I I No, no, no.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; I ain't drinking beer. I ain't drinking
[1:16:51] wine.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I ain't drinking hard liquor. I ain't
[1:16:54] drinking
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah to the Lamb.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Where am I?
[1:17:10] All right. Um,
[1:17:12] I was I was talking about uh Okay. Okay.
[1:17:16] Um, in Babylon, they they went out and
[1:17:19] got them cups of the Lord, the uh uh
[1:17:22] dedicated cups to God, uh, sacred cups,
[1:17:26] and they began to drink, you know, from
[1:17:28] these cups. And before you know it,
[1:17:30] judgment had come into Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:17:33] house and and God had wrote with his own
[1:17:36] finger right on the wall. Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] And um and was pretty much letting them
[1:17:40] know that your time is your time is up.
[1:17:42] You've been found uh waiting uh you're
[1:17:45] you're wanting in the balance. You're in
[1:17:47] the balance and you're found wanting. So
[1:17:49] you're pretty much your time is up. And
[1:17:51] really at the very time that these uh
[1:17:53] that this f handwriting on the wall,
[1:17:56] there's an army sneaking in getting
[1:17:58] ready to take over Babylon.
[1:18:01] Brother Brandham says something here in
[1:18:02] Christ is revealed in his own word. He
[1:18:04] says, "Now we know God chose by
[1:18:06] predestination his church, his place,
[1:18:09] his prophets and all about it. But by
[1:18:11] fornowledge he predestinated his prophet
[1:18:13] and when the age arrived he had his
[1:18:16] prophet arrive at the same time and
[1:18:19] inspired him as he wrote the Bible by
[1:18:21] him. Now God wrote the Bible only using
[1:18:25] the prophet because that's that's his
[1:18:27] way of doing it. So see it's not the
[1:18:30] it's not it's it's it's not the see it's
[1:18:32] the word of God and not the word of man.
[1:18:36] God is a person. Look at this. God can
[1:18:39] speak.
[1:18:41] God can talk.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; God
[1:18:46] can write.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you that's that I I like
[1:18:52] that. God can write. He didn't have to
[1:18:55] do it that way. But that's the way he
[1:18:57] chose to do it. He didn't have to do it
[1:18:59] that way, but he chose to do it that
[1:19:01] way. Now, you say God wrote with his
[1:19:03] finger, his own majestic finger, the Ten
[1:19:06] Commandments. So God could write itself
[1:19:09] if he wanted to, but he chose to write
[1:19:12] it through prophets.
[1:19:15] If God wanted to write it, he could. But
[1:19:17] the way he chose to get his word to us
[1:19:19] is through prophets.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Write it through prophets.
[1:19:23] SEE, BECAUSE IT WAS HIS ATTRIBUTES, his
[1:19:25] word. He expressed through them, making
[1:19:28] all a part of him. Amen. He says, see,
[1:19:32] he could write with his finger. He also
[1:19:34] took his finger and wrote on the walls
[1:19:36] of Babylon, "THOU ART WEIGHED IN THE
[1:19:38] BALANCE AND FOUND WANTING." He wrote
[1:19:40] with his own finger.
[1:19:43] Now, uh I want to pick up another quote
[1:19:46] out of questions and answers part one.
[1:19:48] Brother Brandon was referring to to this
[1:19:51] and uh what happened here in um um uh in
[1:19:56] Babylon uh with Nebuchadnezzar. And
[1:19:58] again, just kind of referring back here
[1:20:00] to Ezra 5 and 12, where it says, "But
[1:20:04] after that our fathers had provoked the
[1:20:05] God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them
[1:20:07] into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the
[1:20:10] king of Babylon, the children who
[1:20:11] destroyed
[1:20:13] this house, and carried the people away
[1:20:15] into Babylon." Now, some other things
[1:20:19] happened in Babylon in confusion
[1:20:24] and uh we have uh dealt with this. Amen.
[1:20:28] Even brother Andrew hit it again on
[1:20:30] Wednesday night. He made a statement
[1:20:33] that was very profound to me. We have a
[1:20:36] group of young people
[1:20:39] growing up in the message that will have
[1:20:42] never experienced what it is like to go
[1:20:45] to church.
[1:20:48] what it's like to go to church and
[1:20:49] actually hear a minister preach
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; because they doing tapes in their houses
[1:20:56] and they don't realize the tapes that
[1:20:57] they're playing came from somebody in
[1:21:00] the church preaching from a pullpit.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I I I mean I just I was listening to a
[1:21:09] tape this week and brother Brandham said
[1:21:10] God never used
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; a mechanical device to preach the
[1:21:15] gospel. God never did that. He's always
[1:21:18] used men.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Now, how can you hear that on tape and
[1:21:22] not get up and go to church?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; It's because you're selectively hearing
[1:21:28] what you want to hear.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But brother Brandham didn't
[1:21:32] teach these things.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Uh folk come up with this kind of stuff.
[1:21:35] But brother Brandham didn't teach that.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now hearing questions
[1:21:39] answer. Now, I need you to I need you to
[1:21:40] kind of catch something. Uh it's very
[1:21:42] important because
[1:21:44] as it was amen there in Babylon with the
[1:21:47] confusion that they were in uh we'll see
[1:21:50] that confusion come back again in the
[1:21:52] earth and it's here right now. This is
[1:21:54] why we got all these different uh uh
[1:21:56] things going on in the message because
[1:21:58] it's it's just a spirit of confusion.
[1:22:01] The way that you settle yourself is look
[1:22:02] at things according to the word.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Now look at this. Look, let's look at
[1:22:09] look look at something here in this
[1:22:11] message questions and answers. He says,
[1:22:13] and notice
[1:22:15] I could state something here that would
[1:22:19] shock.
[1:22:21] Now, he said, I can say something that
[1:22:22] could shock us. Watch it now. He says,
[1:22:25] listen now. Watch now, Babylon. What
[1:22:29] taken place at Babylon when the force
[1:22:30] was brought on to the true worshippers.
[1:22:34] Remember just a little handful,
[1:22:36] Shadrach, Meach, and Abednego, and
[1:22:38] Daniel of the true worshippers went down
[1:22:40] into captivity. When God called them to
[1:22:42] really show their colors what they what
[1:22:44] they were, they were forced into worship
[1:22:47] of an idol.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were forced into the
[1:22:53] worship of an idol. Is that right?
[1:22:55] Idolatry. They was forced into worship
[1:22:58] of an idol. They had to bow before an
[1:23:01] idol. And if they didn't do it, they
[1:23:03] were persecuted. Now, when brother
[1:23:05] Brandham says that I could say something
[1:23:07] here that was shock, but he doesn't say
[1:23:09] it. Hallelujah. I can tell you, Amen.
[1:23:13] Because I know other quotes where he've
[1:23:14] where he did say it. This idol that they
[1:23:17] were trying to force them to worship WAS
[1:23:19] AN IDOL OF DANIEL.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; The the Hebrew BOYS, THEIR THEIR GOOD
[1:23:25] FRIEND, DANIEL. AMEN. WHO WHO HELPED GET
[1:23:29] THEM OUT OF SOME SITUATIONS AND GET THEM
[1:23:30] PROMOTED INTO AMEN INTO THAT GENTILE
[1:23:33] KINGDOM. THEY WERE FORCED TO TRY TO
[1:23:35] WORSHIP DANIEL,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; AN IMAGE OF DANIEL. HALLELUJAH. AND THEM
[1:23:40] BOYS HAD TO STAND AGAINST THE WORSHIP OF
[1:23:42] THEIR OWN FRIEND.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. WE MIGHT AS WELL GO A
[1:23:49] LITTLE FURTHER WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE
[1:23:51] ARE TRYING TO MAKE BROTHER BRANDHAM AN
[1:23:53] IDOL
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO WORSHIP BROTHER
[1:23:56] BRANDON.
[1:23:57] WE HERE TO WORSHIP GOD.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T SAVE
[1:24:05] YOU.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T DELIVER YOU.
[1:24:07] BROTHER BRANDHAM CAN'T HEAL YOU. IT'S
[1:24:09] JESUS THAT DOES ALL THAT.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And here here's the problem. People have
[1:24:15] lifted up brother Brandham. Amen. Too
[1:24:17] high. I told y'all a long time ago, God
[1:24:19] told me when I went to the grave of the
[1:24:21] prophet, I was standing there at at his
[1:24:23] grave and just just like, "Wow, man.
[1:24:25] This is this is what a blessing to be
[1:24:27] here. And the Holy Spirit came down and
[1:24:28] told me say, "Don't you lift him too
[1:24:31] high."
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; I said, "What?" And then he came back
[1:24:36] and said, "And don't you put him too low
[1:24:39] either."
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; So I I've always tried to walk right in
[1:24:43] the middle of the road
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; with where we put Brother Brandon.
[1:24:48] That's why I said we don't sing songs
[1:24:49] here
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; that glorify the prophet
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; cuz the prophet told us that this whole
[1:24:55] thing is supposed to be about the
[1:24:56] principal theme of the entire Bible
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; is Christ.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; So we sing that glorify Christ.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I done I done heard him
[1:25:09] get in there singing song like what is
[1:25:11] this? What song is this?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Where y'all get this from? Jesus ain't
[1:25:15] nowhere in the song.
[1:25:18] all about brother Brandon and y'all want
[1:25:20] us to segment it that who we worshiping
[1:25:22] in here
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; and some don't see nothing wrong with it
[1:25:26] but you let them go on and do whatever
[1:25:27] they going to do
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; but it was only few in in the Hebrew
[1:25:31] boys days only few that could withstand
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many others when they start
[1:25:37] piping the music
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; and telling them now if you don't bow
[1:25:41] and sing this song we're gonna have to
[1:25:44] throw you into the lion's den I wonder
[1:25:45] what music they were Man,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I wonder what the song was.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz their their God that they were
[1:25:55] worshiping was Daniel.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Did they write songs about Daniel?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; let's just go a little further.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Idolatry. We not We not We not We not
[1:26:09] doing that, church.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Idolatry. Idolatry. Idolatry. All over
[1:26:13] the place. Idolatry.
[1:26:17] Uh it says, "Oh, what a picture you can
[1:26:20] pull out of Daniel." Revelations tie
[1:26:23] those together and show by the scripture
[1:26:26] that the church is coming into the same
[1:26:28] type of persecution
[1:26:31] before she's called out. That's the way
[1:26:34] the gentile church was brought in. And
[1:26:36] that's the way the gentile church will
[1:26:38] be taken out. As she come in, so shall
[1:26:42] she go. So, at a time of a rapture,
[1:26:45] we're going to see things like this rise
[1:26:47] up. And and and you got to be so rooted
[1:26:50] and grounded in the word that these
[1:26:51] things can't move you.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; It don't matter who doing it.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Don't matter what your name is.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, cuz you know, brother Brandon,
[1:27:03] brother Brandon even made a statement.
[1:27:04] He says, he says, "I don't know what
[1:27:06] happened to Brandon Tabernacle.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; They don't even have church there
[1:27:10] anymore.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; It's closed.
[1:27:14] I think that and and and and because
[1:27:16] they it's too many people to go to
[1:27:18] church
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; and uh and and and and it won't fit all
[1:27:20] the people that's there in that area
[1:27:22] that want to go go to that church. So
[1:27:23] they they built a gymnasium for the
[1:27:25] people to go to.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But because people died from COVID, they
[1:27:29] stopped going to church and now
[1:27:31] everything is
[1:27:33] at home playing the tape. But the
[1:27:36] scripture says, "Forsake not
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; to assemble yourselves together as you
[1:27:42] see that day approaching." That's what
[1:27:43] the scripture says.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all better know y'all
[1:27:47] Bible.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Look, I'm going to go to church.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I do listen to tapes, but I'm going to
[1:27:54] church
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm listening to a preacher
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; because he gave
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; WHO IS HE? GOD GAVE SOME APOSTLES, SOME
[1:28:04] PASTORS, SOME TEACHERS, SOME
[1:28:06] EVANGELISTS, SOME PROPHETS. GOD GAVE ALL
[1:28:10] OF THAT
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS, FOR
[1:28:13] THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY, FOR THE
[1:28:14] EDIFICATION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; GOD DID THAT.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And we still in God's program.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going a little further.
[1:28:25] Hallelujah. He says this
[1:28:30] says and look how he saw that saw the
[1:28:33] image and now remember the image now
[1:28:36] this is home place. Now look I believe
[1:28:38] that image that that king Nebuchad
[1:28:41] Nebuchadnezzar made was was of Daniel a
[1:28:44] holy man. If you'll notice, King
[1:28:46] Nebuchadnezzar already had called Daniel
[1:28:48] uh called him Beltichazar
[1:28:51] says which was his idol and he made an
[1:28:54] image and no one after Daniel had been
[1:28:57] thrown in the uh thrown in the lion's
[1:28:59] den and so forth and he said no one
[1:29:02] should ever serve any other gods
[1:29:05] my God and so forth but Daniel's God it
[1:29:08] was probably the image of a holy man
[1:29:11] great statue and everybody was bowing
[1:29:13] down bow down to this but the church
[1:29:18] Shadrach and Meak and Abednego Daniel
[1:29:21] being the leader as Christ being the
[1:29:23] leader of the church and they was to bow
[1:29:26] before this image and do worship to the
[1:29:28] image notice and you notice in those
[1:29:30] times Daniel was silent
[1:29:34] Daniel didn't say nothing but because
[1:29:36] they had to prove their own revelation
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah they and according to the the
[1:29:42] law God said I will have no other gods
[1:29:44] before me. So them brothers had to stand
[1:29:46] on their own revelation EVEN THOUGH
[1:29:48] DANIEL'S SILENT, NOT SAYING NOTHING
[1:29:50] ABOUT IT. THEY HAD TO STAND on their own
[1:29:52] revelation and God vindicated their
[1:29:55] revelation.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Look at it now. It says uh
[1:30:03] uh and it says and it says and you
[1:30:06] notice in those times Daniel was silent
[1:30:08] and amen and oh I hope you get this.
[1:30:10] Daniel was silent letting they had to
[1:30:13] make their own choice.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Says in the day in the going out of the
[1:30:19] gentile dispensation he's talking about
[1:30:21] right now
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; in the going out of the gentile
[1:30:24] dispensation there'll be an image and
[1:30:27] everybody will have to bow before the
[1:30:28] image and do worship. Now now I'm I'm
[1:30:31] I'm I'm I'm I got to say these things. I
[1:30:33] got young people that at some point in
[1:30:36] time y'all going to enter into
[1:30:37] courtship.
[1:30:39] somebody gonna express an interest in
[1:30:40] you and you're gonna be thinking about,
[1:30:43] you know, courtship, but there's
[1:30:44] questions you need to be asking
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; just just before just because somebody,
[1:30:49] well, I'm interested in you. Well, okay.
[1:30:51] Who's your pastor?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And let them know my pastor would like
[1:30:56] to talk with your pastor.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my god,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I GOT QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK. I WANT
[1:31:03] TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CHARACTER THIS
[1:31:04] YOUNG MAN IS. Did he just come to church
[1:31:07] yesterday
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; or has he really been in church and gone
[1:31:10] through some tests and trials? I'm going
[1:31:12] to EVEN ASK THAT PASTOR, IS HE A
[1:31:13] FAITHFUL TITHE PAYER?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SAY, WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?
[1:31:19] THAT'S SO PERSONAL, BROTHER JACK. WHY WE
[1:31:20] ASK THAT? BECAUSE I I KNOW IF YOUR HOUSE
[1:31:22] GOING TO BE BLESSED OR CURSED.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I CAN TELL WHETHER Y'ALL GOING TO HAVE
[1:31:30] FINANCIAL STRUGGLES OR NOT. AND
[1:31:32] EVERYBODY GOING TO HAVE FINANCIAL
[1:31:33] STRUGGLES, BUT YOU AIN'T GOT NO PROMISE
[1:31:35] TO BRING YOU OUT.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; I NEED TO KNOW
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT ARE you hooking her up into.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T GOT TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. LET
[1:31:48] ME ASK HIM. IF I RUN HIM OFF, HE MIGHT
[1:31:50] HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RUN OFF.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; BUT IF HE CHECK ALL THE BOXES, THEN
[1:31:56] PRAISE GOD.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on, sisters. I'M TRYING TO
[1:32:01] HELP YOU OUT NOW.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; You know, you sneak AROUND TRYING TO GET
[1:32:05] SOMEBODY and ain't RUN THEM THROUGH NO

[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; And when when when when the trouble go
[1:32:19] down,

[1:32:24] Now all of a sudden, pastor,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; let me let me just put it like this. I'm
[1:32:31] have to be plain with you. You can't
[1:32:33] bring a lemon and expect me to make
[1:32:36] lemonade.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Now, look, we got to do
[1:32:41] some checks and balances before things
[1:32:44] get down too far down the path.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and let me tell y'all
[1:32:48] something. I got your best interest in
[1:32:50] mind. Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:33:00] TO BE AN ASSET. YOU A LIABILITY.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; We got to just be honest. DON'T COME AND
[1:33:10] SPOIL HER LIFE. MAKE HER LIFE BETTER,
[1:33:12] BRO.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; MY GOD.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; LET ME try to finish this.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Help us. HELP ME, LORD.
[1:33:24] BUT JUST JUST please y'all y'all run
[1:33:27] things through. Give them give them your
[1:33:28] pastor number. Talk to my pastor. He
[1:33:30] going to have some questions for you.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you get too deep in that.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Too committed.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Don't get your feelings all connected.
[1:33:38] And now now I'm trying to unt untangle
[1:33:41] all this spaghetti.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:33:48] All right.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Look.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And parents, y'all, y'all know that
[1:33:58] stuff be going on too. Now, if y'all see
[1:34:00] them sneaking, talking on the phone, now
[1:34:02] no, no, no, no. If they ain't talk to
[1:34:03] you,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; come on now. You ought to be involved in
[1:34:05] that. You ought to know what's going on.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Sometime the parents already going to
[1:34:09] work this thing out and we're going to
[1:34:10] take it to the pastor. We're going to do
[1:34:11] it just like this and we're going to get
[1:34:12] we're going to say just like I don't
[1:34:14] know y'all done put that plan together.
[1:34:19] Hello, somebody. I'm It's This is for
[1:34:21] your good.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; You talk about years of life.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Years.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because I I'm I'm going to
[1:34:32] read to you out of Malachi where God
[1:34:34] hates divorce.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; So when you when you when you
[1:34:37] approaching marriage, you cannot have
[1:34:39] divorce as an option. If it don't work
[1:34:41] out, we just get divorced. You cannot do
[1:34:43] that as a believer. Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; You can't do that. You can't approach
[1:34:47] marriage like that.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; This is until death do you part.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And and you
[1:34:58] look at others that might have been
[1:34:59] divorced. I come from a household my my
[1:35:02] mom was divorced and met my dad and I'm
[1:35:03] I'm glad that things worked out the way
[1:35:05] they did. But but she didn't have all
[1:35:06] this truth.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Mama didn't have all of this.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You look at other people, they didn't
[1:35:11] have all the truth that you have. Amen.
[1:35:14] Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And and but but but what happens is that
[1:35:16] y'all y'all over go over the truth
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; and you want to do it your way.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; You're going to suffer the consequences.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Don't don't do that. Look, it's better
[1:35:26] to be single than to be married and
[1:35:28] miserable.
[1:35:43] And if you marry an unbeliever,
[1:35:46] you marry an unbeliever, you will be
[1:35:48] miserable.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Let me finish reading. I I I got
[1:35:54] something I really want to say.
[1:36:00] In the day in the going out of the
[1:36:02] Gentiles of sization, there there will
[1:36:05] be an image and everybody will have to
[1:36:06] bow down before this image and do
[1:36:08] worship. Though it be holy as ever,
[1:36:11] you're not to worship an image. Image
[1:36:14] worship. Now notice, oh my, right at the
[1:36:18] end, Daniel steps in again. How
[1:36:21] marvelous that right before the great
[1:36:24] feast of the concubines and so forth
[1:36:26] there come a handwriting on the wall
[1:36:28] meani mean teoarf
[1:36:31] across the wall and the interpretation
[1:36:34] nobody could give it was wrote in
[1:36:36] unknown tongues nobody could interpret
[1:36:38] they went got their best scholars that
[1:36:40] said we don't know and they went and got
[1:36:42] all the soussayers and astrologers we
[1:36:44] don't know we don't know nothing about
[1:36:45] it we never seen such a language never
[1:36:48] heard such in our life but there was a
[1:36:50] man. God had his man. Daniel was there.
[1:36:53] Said, "Go get him." Said, "For the
[1:36:55] spirit of the gods lives in him." It
[1:36:58] says, "So Daniel come up there, began to
[1:37:01] read and interpret that language on the
[1:37:03] wall. And he gave what was the
[1:37:05] interpretation? Not not, oh bless be
[1:37:08] thou, O king forever, but a raw, burly,
[1:37:11] flat rejection and said, you are weighed
[1:37:14] in the balance and found wanting." A
[1:37:18] prophet don't always bring good
[1:37:20] prophecies.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime he got to tell you the
[1:37:24] truth.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. To get you to straighten up from
[1:37:27] your sin. Let me keep reading here in
[1:37:29] Ezra chapter 5. We stopped at verse 12.
[1:37:32] I'll go to verse 13. says, "But in the
[1:37:34] first year of Cyrus, the king of
[1:37:36] Babylon, the same uh King Cyrus made a
[1:37:39] decree to build this house of God, and
[1:37:42] the vessels also of gold and silver of
[1:37:45] the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar
[1:37:46] took out of the temple that was in
[1:37:48] Jerusalem, and brought them into the
[1:37:50] temple of Babylon, those that Cyrus the
[1:37:52] the king, take out of the temple of
[1:37:54] Babylon, and they were delivered unto
[1:37:56] one whose name was uh Chespazar, whom he
[1:38:00] had made governor." Now, now again,
[1:38:03] they're looking uh to try to uh certify,
[1:38:06] hey, who told these people to start
[1:38:07] building rebuilding this and who gave
[1:38:09] them this authority? And we want to know
[1:38:12] who your names are. They wouldn't never
[1:38:13] give the names, but they said, search
[1:38:15] back in the records and see. And when
[1:38:17] they went back to look, they saw Cyrus
[1:38:19] had given them uh the authority to go
[1:38:22] back and rebuild Jerusalem. But not only
[1:38:25] Cyrus, you know, you can see Cyrus even
[1:38:27] in the scripture, he's restoring even
[1:38:29] the sacred vessels. Restoration's all
[1:38:31] over here, right? He's restoring the
[1:38:33] sacred vessels. And the other thing that
[1:38:35] we I read to you last time, and I won't
[1:38:37] read it again, but in the next chapter,
[1:38:38] you'll see that Cyrus also provided
[1:38:41] money out of his own pocket for the
[1:38:44] restoration to occur.
[1:38:47] Oh boy, I just love that. And that's why
[1:38:50] I said, "God,
[1:38:52] thank you for my Cyrus
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and thank you for making me a Cyrus."
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz brother, we we sometime
[1:39:02] you need a Cyrus
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; and God will give you a Cyrus.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking. Look look look.
[1:39:12] Can I just be honest with y'all? This
[1:39:14] one chump change. Right.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Cyrus wasn't giving $20.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; No, this was this was multi-million
[1:39:26] probably project here. This was this was
[1:39:28] major money.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CYRUS THAT GOT IT.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CYRUS THAT GOT IT SOMEWHERE.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR CYRUS, LORD.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR GIVING US FAVOR WITH
[1:39:44] CYRUS.
[1:39:49] HAVE MERCY.
[1:39:52] Listen to a testimony. Brother brother
[1:39:54] brother testified how he went to his
[1:39:57] pastor needed just a loan.
[1:40:01] I think he said he needed 200,000
[1:40:04] in a loan
[1:40:08] and pastor gave it to him and he lost
[1:40:12] the lost it in a business transaction.
[1:40:14] lost 200,000.
[1:40:19] Now, let me just help you understand
[1:40:21] something.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; If one of the saints came to me to ask
[1:40:25] me for 200,000,
[1:40:27] I would love to be in a position
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; to be able to give them 200,000.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you another thing. As a
[1:40:36] pastor, I have to think it might be
[1:40:40] multiple saints
[1:40:42] asking for 200,000.
[1:40:44] And I got to have enough
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; that I could be able to give everybody
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; that. And if I lost it, I can still keep
[1:40:53] functioning.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; So in order to be able to give 200,000
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; and not feel it,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; oh my,
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; make me a Cyrus.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; This what I'm talking about.
[1:41:14] Jesus. Let me keep on reading.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; We got to We I'm talking about our
[1:41:19] numbers got to get bigger.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; We got to thank bigger.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:29] Oh Lord. What verse was our own? Um
[1:41:33] okay. Verse 15. and said to him, "Take
[1:41:35] these vessels, go carry them into the
[1:41:38] temple uh that is in Jerusalem, and let
[1:41:42] the house of God be built in his place."
[1:41:44] Then came the same
[1:41:48] Shespazar, and laid the foundation of
[1:41:50] the house of God, which is in Jerusalem,
[1:41:52] since that since that time, even until
[1:41:53] now hath it been in building. Uh, and
[1:41:56] yet it is not finished. Now therefore,
[1:41:59] if it seemed good to the king, let there
[1:42:02] be search made in the king's treasure
[1:42:04] house, which is which is there at
[1:42:06] Babylon, whether it be so that a decree
[1:42:09] was made of Cyrus the king to build this
[1:42:12] house of God at Jerusalem, and let the
[1:42:14] king send his pleasure to us concerning
[1:42:17] this matter. All right. So here they're
[1:42:20] going through all of this
[1:42:23] um all kind of tension even in trying to
[1:42:26] rebuild. Uh but God was making a way.
[1:42:30] Things were recorded and they knew the
[1:42:32] reason they had to search it search to
[1:42:33] see what a king said because whatever
[1:42:36] king said was final.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; When a king spoke it, it could not be
[1:42:43] altered.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; It could not be changed. And when God
[1:42:46] has given you a promise There is nothing
[1:42:50] or nobody that can alter it or change
[1:42:53] it.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; I'm standing on it.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Sometime I have to speak to my business.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I tell my business that what he told me
[1:43:08] that what
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; whatever these hands touch
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; whatever these hands touch you going he
[1:43:16] it's going to prosper. and it's going to
[1:43:19] bring forth seed uh fruit in its season.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Whatever I do supposed to prosper.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I ain't accepting nothing less.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Let me let me slip over here. I got to
[1:43:32] get to Malachi. Malachi was a prophet
[1:43:34] that raised up during this time. And
[1:43:36] let's let's look look at a couple things
[1:43:38] Malachi said first. Malachi 2 verse 15-1
[1:43:41] 17.
[1:43:43] He brought inspiration during this
[1:43:45] restoration. Now, uh, I want y'all to
[1:43:48] remember now that people are coming out
[1:43:50] of 70 years of bondage. And in 70 years
[1:43:53] of bondage, I think sometimes you might
[1:43:55] lose your way. You might lose some of
[1:43:59] the truths that that you used to stand
[1:44:01] on you. In Babylon, you got to live the
[1:44:03] way these people living. And I mean,
[1:44:05] what temple could they go to in Babylon?
[1:44:08] There was a there was actually even a
[1:44:09] scripture. I forgot to bring it to you,
[1:44:11] but it's in the book of Psalms. They
[1:44:12] would they would ask them to sing songs
[1:44:15] and and and and they they they said,
[1:44:17] "How can we sing
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; when we're in a strange land,
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; right? How can how can we HOW CAN WE
[1:44:24] EVEN GIVE some of the Lord's song in the
[1:44:26] stream? It's it's hard to do what we
[1:44:28] used to do when we're in Babylon,
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; God has restored a condition so they can
[1:44:36] get back into a place where they can
[1:44:37] worship God freely." I I believe God is
[1:44:40] restoring a condition so we can get back
[1:44:42] in a place where we can WORSHIP GOD
[1:44:44] FREELY.
[1:44:47] I GOT TO READ.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me let me let me quickly.
[1:44:52] Uh Malachi 2 verse 15-17 says, "And did
[1:44:56] not he make one? Yet had he the residue
[1:45:01] of the spirit, and wherefore one that he
[1:45:03] might seek a godly seed. Therefore take
[1:45:06] heed to your spirit, and let none deal
[1:45:08] treacherously against the wife of his
[1:45:10] youth. For the Lord the God of Israel
[1:45:14] said that he hateth putting away. What
[1:45:16] is that hateth putting away? He hateth
[1:45:19] divorce. Now, so there was probably
[1:45:21] issues that they were having. Amen.
[1:45:23] During this time, but it's like I mean
[1:45:24] here a prophet has to kind of
[1:45:26] reestablish marriage. Brother Brandham
[1:45:29] did the exact same thing when he
[1:45:30] preached the marriage um preach the
[1:45:32] sermon marriage AND DIVORCE. HE'S
[1:45:34] REESTABLISHING THE TRUTH OF MARRIAGE.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; MALACHI IS REESTABLISHING THIS TRUTH
[1:45:39] BEHIND MARRIAGE. SAY GOD HATE PUTTING
[1:45:41] AWAY.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He says uh for the Lord the
[1:45:44] God of Israel saith that he hateth
[1:45:46] putting away for one coverth violence
[1:45:48] with his garment sayith the Lord of
[1:45:49] hosts. Therefore take heed to your
[1:45:51] spirit that you do not treacherously. Ye
[1:45:53] have wearied the Lord with your words
[1:45:55] yet you say wherein have we rided him?
[1:45:57] When you say everyone that doeth evil is
[1:45:59] good in the sight of the Lord and he
[1:46:01] delightth in them or where is the God of
[1:46:05] judgment?
[1:46:08] We see here that the the the marriage
[1:46:10] and divorce is being restored.
[1:46:12] We also pick up Malachi chapter 3 verse
[1:46:16] 7-2.
[1:46:18] Tithing had to be restored.
[1:46:21] Tithing had to be restored. Um when you
[1:46:24] when you you know I I don't think I
[1:46:26] found like when we read this I don't I
[1:46:30] don't think I found like an exact match
[1:46:32] of of a scripture where where this was
[1:46:34] kind of repeated before. But when they
[1:46:36] come out of
[1:46:38] captivity, Malachi raises up because
[1:46:41] again, where were they going to take
[1:46:43] their tithing to? In in Babylon, where
[1:46:47] do they go with it? What do they do?
[1:46:50] They don't they can't go to the temple.
[1:46:51] There is no temple in Babylon.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so when you get to a spot
[1:46:55] where the people don't have it, they
[1:46:57] they begin to get away from these
[1:46:59] principles. Oh my. And God has to come
[1:47:02] back and restore the principle. So, let
[1:47:04] me let let's just kind of look at this.
[1:47:06] Amen. And and and I and here's the other
[1:47:08] thing I'm I'mma show you. Amen. Malachi
[1:47:12] actually God used these prophets to
[1:47:14] restore. But not only did Malachi
[1:47:16] restore this, but also Nehemiah restored
[1:47:19] it.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Because both OF THESE WERE
[1:47:23] PROPHETS THAT WAS USED DURING THE POST
[1:47:25] EXILEIC PERIOD. NOW WATCH Malachi 3:7.
[1:47:29] It says, "Even from the days of your
[1:47:31] fathers,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; you're gone away from mine ordinances."
[1:47:35] See, you have to come back to these
[1:47:37] ordinances. It says, "And and and have
[1:47:39] not kept them. Return unto me, and I
[1:47:43] will return unto you, sayith the Lord of
[1:47:45] hosts. BUT YE SAID, WHEREIN SHALL we
[1:47:48] return?" Hallelujah. Will a man rob God?
[1:47:55] Yet ye now, now that's a that's I mean,
[1:47:58] look, People go around and they might
[1:48:00] hold up this person and try to hold up
[1:48:02] that person, but you'll never think
[1:48:04] about trying to rob God. Nobody got
[1:48:07] that. That's not that won't cross
[1:48:08] nobody's mind to try TO ROB GOD. RIGHT?
[1:48:11] HE SAID, "BUT WILL A MAN ROB GOD?" YET
[1:48:13] YE HAVE ROBBED ME. BUT YOU SAY, "WHEREIN
[1:48:17] HAVE WE ROBBED THEE?" He says, "In
[1:48:19] tithes
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and offering." Them 70 years that you
[1:48:24] obey, you robbing God in tithes and
[1:48:27] offering. Now, now notice it's tithes
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; and offering.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Not just tithes, but tithes
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; and offering. Lord, let me let me now,
[1:48:37] now before I go further. Amen. In this
[1:48:39] this verse, there was a reference to
[1:48:42] verse verse 8 and uh Nehemiah 13:11.
[1:48:46] So, let's uh let's let's pick that up.
[1:48:49] I'm going to start at verse 10, though.
[1:48:51] Nehemiah 13:10.
[1:48:53] Nehemiah is also dealing with this.
[1:48:56] Hallelujah. Malachi is dealing with it.
[1:48:58] And all this comes during a time of
[1:48:59] restoration, post exileic period. Now
[1:49:02] watch this. Nehemiah 13, I'm starting in
[1:49:04] verse 10. It says, "And I perceived
[1:49:08] this Nehemiah. I perceived that a
[1:49:10] portion uh that that the portions of the
[1:49:13] Levites had not been given them. For the
[1:49:18] Levites and the singers that did the
[1:49:20] work were fled everyone to his field."
[1:49:23] IT SAYS, "THEN CONTENDED I with the
[1:49:25] rulers and said, why is the house of God
[1:49:28] forsaken? And I gathered them together
[1:49:31] and set them in their place. Then
[1:49:33] brought all Judah the tithe of the corn
[1:49:36] and the new wine and the oil unto the
[1:49:39] treasures
[1:49:41] uh treasuries." It says, "And I made
[1:49:43] treasures over the treasuries
[1:49:46] the priest and Zadok the scribe and of
[1:49:48] the Levites uh uh Padayiah. And next to
[1:49:51] them was Hannim uh the son of Zakur the
[1:49:54] son of Mataniah. But they were counted
[1:49:56] faithful and their office was to
[1:49:57] distribute unto their brethren. It says,
[1:50:00] "Remember me, oh my God, concerning this
[1:50:02] and wipe not out my good deeds that I
[1:50:06] have done for the house of my God and
[1:50:08] for the offices thereof." So here
[1:50:10] Nehemiah saying, "Now I notice that the
[1:50:13] the the the Levites ain't been taken
[1:50:15] care of.
[1:50:17] They are they out working in the field.
[1:50:19] They not actually doing the service in
[1:50:21] the house of God because they out
[1:50:22] working in the field. Something wrong
[1:50:24] somewhere. SO HE HAD TO GET IN START
[1:50:26] BRINGING THE TITHE back into the
[1:50:27] treasuries in the house. Now this is
[1:50:30] Nehemiah restoring that.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; AND MALACHI IS ALSO RESTORING THE SAME
[1:50:36] THING. LOOK AT WHAT MALACHI SAYS. WE'LL
[1:50:38] GO BACK TO Malachi 3 verse verse 8
[1:50:40] again. WILL A MAN ROB GOD? YET YE HAVE
[1:50:43] ROBBED ME BUT YE SAY WHEREIN HAVE WE
[1:50:45] ROBBED THEE? and tithes and offering.
[1:50:49] Verse nine says, "You're cursed with a
[1:50:51] curse. For ye have robbed me, even this
[1:50:54] whole nation.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; BRING YE ALL THE TITHES INTO THE
[1:50:57] STOREHOUSE, THAT THERE MAY be meat in my
[1:50:59] house, and prove me now herewith, sayith
[1:51:02] the Lord OF HOSTS, IF I WILL NOT OPEN
[1:51:04] YOU the windows of heaven, AND POUR YOU
[1:51:07] OUT A BLESSING THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE
[1:51:09] room enough to receive it."
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It's something about when we get back to
[1:51:14] the word of God. Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; It won't be room enough to receive. IT
[1:51:17] SAYS, "AND I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOUR
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SAKES. AND HE SHALL NOT DESTROY
[1:51:24] THE FRUITS OF YOUR GROUND, NEITHER SHALL
[1:51:26] YOUR VINE CAST HER FRUIT BEFORE THE TIME
[1:51:28] IN THE FIELD, SAYETH THE LORD OF HOSTS,
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; and all nations shall call you blessed.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; For ye shall be a delightsome land,
[1:51:39] saith the Lord of hosts." Tithing and
[1:51:42] offering had to be restored. Tithing was
[1:51:46] to give 10% of your earnings back to the
[1:51:50] Lord. Tithing belong to God.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Tithing belong to God.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing we need to
[1:51:56] understand because people tell you all
[1:51:58] kind of stuff. You just giving that
[1:51:59] money to your preacher. No, no, no, no.
[1:52:01] I gave it TO GOD.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; And whoever God gives it to, that's up
[1:52:05] to him. But I ain't going to be fighting
[1:52:06] with God.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Tithing belongs to God. Uh Tithing is a
[1:52:12] uh something that was established way
[1:52:14] back. Amen. Abraham paid tithes uh to
[1:52:17] MelzDC in the book of Genesis.
[1:52:20] Hallelujah. Levi received tithes but
[1:52:23] also paid tithe in the laws of Abraham.
[1:52:25] You find that in Hebrews 7:9, right? But
[1:52:28] tithing has been a principle of the
[1:52:30] scripture since the very beginning and
[1:52:33] it still exists today.
[1:52:36] And
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; let me just also mention this cuz
[1:52:37] there's some people with this new
[1:52:39] revelation.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; They say Jesus never spoke of tithing.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're lying.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Because there's two particular
[1:52:49] scriptures where Jesus spoke of it.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The first one that I found
[1:52:52] where he spoke of it was in Luke 18. He
[1:52:55] told the parable of the Pharisee WHO
[1:52:57] GAVE HIS TITHES OF ALL HE POSSESSED.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Now the problem is is that
[1:53:02] when the MAN GAVE HIS TITHES on all
[1:53:04] these bless he was he was sitting there
[1:53:06] uh there was a a Pharisee and and
[1:53:08] another guy there a publican praying and
[1:53:10] the publican SAY LORD I AIN'T REALLY GOT
[1:53:12] MUCH BUT LORD I'M A SINNER AND I JUST
[1:53:14] I'M REPENTING BEFORE YOU BUT THE MAN
[1:53:16] SAID I PAID MY TITHE AND I'M NOT LIKE
[1:53:18] THIS PUBLICAN
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A VERY HALTY SPIRIT EVEN THOUGH
[1:53:22] HE PAID HIS TITHE.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. NOW JESUS DID
[1:53:27] NOT TAKE TITHING AWAY. HE SAID, HE SAID
[1:53:29] THE PROBLEM WAS IT'S THE SPIRIT THAT THE
[1:53:31] MAN, BUT NOT THAT HE PAID HIS TITHES.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAID HE SHOULD HAVE KEPT
[1:53:36] DOING THAT, BUT HE NEEDED TO DO IT IN A
[1:53:37] BETTER SPIRIT.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; NOW, let me let me let me just let you
[1:53:40] in on a couple SECRETS BECAUSE THERE ARE
[1:53:42] SOME PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN GO TO CHURCH
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; AND THEY STILL PAY THEIR TITHES.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, GOD WANT MORE
[1:53:50] THAN JUST YOUR TITHES.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU.
[1:53:55] AMEN.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; AND IF HE CAN HAVE YOU, YOU'LL BRING
[1:53:58] THEM YOUR TITHES.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; So you sometimes you got people that
[1:54:03] think they JUST COVERED UNDERNEATH A
[1:54:05] PROMISE because that's what I do. I pay
[1:54:06] my time. No, no. You just want the
[1:54:08] financial blessings. GOD, GOD GOT SO
[1:54:10] MUCH MORE TO OFFER YOU,
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; not just the financial part,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; right? But but but then we got other
[1:54:15] people that need this restored in their
[1:54:17] life.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; This is why Malachi had to deal with
[1:54:20] these things. It was a restoration. AND
[1:54:22] THEY HAD LOST THESE PRINCIPLES after
[1:54:24] their bondage FOR 70 YEARS. THEY THEY
[1:54:26] FORGOT ABOUT WHERE THEIR BLESSINGS CAME
[1:54:28] FROM.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Also another uh uh uh you found it in
[1:54:32] Matthew 23:23
[1:54:34] where Jesus had told the Pharisee uh he
[1:54:37] told the Pharisees said, "Y'all pay
[1:54:39] tithes." Amen. But y'all leave the
[1:54:41] waiting matters of the law undone. And
[1:54:44] then he told them like this said he they
[1:54:46] were encouraged to have good judgment to
[1:54:49] have mercy to have faith and to still
[1:54:51] pay their tithes.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; So Jesus deal did deal did Jesus did
[1:54:55] deal with the situation. Tithing is
[1:54:57] something that all believers do.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Let me just give y'all a few things. I'm
[1:55:06] I'm coming home right in here. This is
[1:55:07] where I wanted to get to. I I want to
[1:55:09] just coast just a little bit.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. because uh in in Leviticus 27
[1:55:15] and30, let's read that. Leviticus 27:30
[1:55:18] and 31, tithing belong to God. And and
[1:55:22] God God established this this Levitical
[1:55:24] law that we're supposed to follow even
[1:55:26] to this day. I want to just say like
[1:55:28] this. We don't sell chicken dinners.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; We don't wash cars to support the
[1:55:35] church.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; We simply pay our tithes and our
[1:55:39] offering
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; and God takes care of the rest. And God
[1:55:42] been doing it that way for 23 years.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; And we're gonna keep going
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; cuz it worked.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Look at this in Leviticus 27. This is a
[1:55:52] this is a principle that was established
[1:55:54] in scripture. Jesus never took it out.
[1:55:57] Leviticus 27 and 30. We have that.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; It says and all the t of the land
[1:56:04] whether of the seed of the land or of
[1:56:05] the fruit of the tree is the Lord's.
[1:56:10] It belong to God is the Lord's. It is
[1:56:13] holy
[1:56:14] unto the Lord. Now, here's a uh the next
[1:56:19] verse though gives us something here
[1:56:20] about tithing because God is so serious
[1:56:22] about his tithing. It belong to God.
[1:56:25] You're not supposed to take your tithing
[1:56:26] and use it to do other things with it.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I see somebody on the side of the road
[1:56:33] that look like they need it more than I
[1:56:35] needed. They needed more than God
[1:56:37] needed. and you going to give it. No,
[1:56:39] that ain't what God told you to do. Or
[1:56:41] some some sister that that's that's
[1:56:43] behind and a bill and you going to take
[1:56:45] God's tithe money and give it to her to
[1:56:46] pay. No, no, no, no, no. God said,
[1:56:48] "Bring bring the tithes to the
[1:56:50] storehouse."
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; And here's the way you want to get that
[1:56:53] person to take care of. Let the deacons
[1:56:54] know about that need.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Let the trustees know about that need
[1:56:58] and they can decide how they want to
[1:57:00] handle that need. But don't take God's
[1:57:02] money and go handle the need. Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you now. If you
[1:57:05] take God's money
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; and you go handle other needs or your
[1:57:09] own personal needs, oh Lord,
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; look at, let me just try to break this
[1:57:13] down. It says this. If a man will at all
[1:57:15] redeem all of his tithes, he shall add
[1:57:19] there to the fifth part thereof. That
[1:57:21] means if you take a part of your tithe
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; and keep it back,
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; then the part that you kept back, you
[1:57:29] got to pay that part PLUS 20% OF THAT
[1:57:34] part
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; back to God.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Now that's that's some interest.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; That's some serious interest. You don't
[1:57:42] want to get in trouble with God where
[1:57:44] now you got to catch up and paying 20%
[1:57:46] interest.
[1:57:49] HE ALL ALL HE ASKED YOU ALL HE ASKED YOU
[1:57:51] FOR WAS 10%. NOW YOU DONE GOT UP TO 30%.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Don't play with God's money.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; WILL A MAN ROB GOD.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; YEP. IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS. TITHING IS
[1:58:04] 10% OF YOUR INCOME. OFFERING IS WHATEVER
[1:58:08] you want to give God.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Let me SAY IT AGAIN. TITHING IS 10% OF
[1:58:14] YOUR INCOME. But offering is whatever
[1:58:17] you want to give God outside of that.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Boy, I tell you, God is good.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Let me give y'all a little bit more
[1:58:28] here.
[1:58:30] Uh,
[1:58:34] God being misunderstood.
[1:58:37] Brother Brandon makes some statements
[1:58:39] here. I love how Malachi had to
[1:58:41] reestablish this for the people. God had
[1:58:44] already told them these things in in
[1:58:45] Leviticus, but somehow they got away
[1:58:47] from these truths. But here, brother
[1:58:49] Brandham makes a statement and God being
[1:58:51] misunderstood. The question is asked to
[1:58:53] brother Brandham. Can a Christian
[1:58:56] go to heaven if he or she does not pay
[1:58:59] tithe?
[1:59:03] Look at this question. Look at this
[1:59:05] answer and God being misunderstood. He
[1:59:07] says,
[1:59:09] now that's one that I could not answer
[1:59:11] scripturally. I can't tell you
[1:59:13] scriptures whether you're going to go to
[1:59:14] heaven or not if you don't pay tithe.
[1:59:17] Says, "Now this father, son, and the
[1:59:19] holy spirit,
[1:59:21] if the ministry is sincere,
[1:59:24] just let us know." You see, we'll be
[1:59:27] glad. Brother Neville, myself, or
[1:59:29] brother Biller, brother Collins, or any
[1:59:31] of these ministers who are ordained to
[1:59:33] the ministry and so forth can do so. He
[1:59:35] says, "Now, but now does a Christian not
[1:59:39] get to heaven because they do not pay
[1:59:43] tithe." Do not pay tithe. This is where
[1:59:47] he says, "I could not say yes or no to
[1:59:52] that." He says, "But I do believe that
[1:59:56] every Christian is obligated to pay
[2:00:01] tiths."
[2:00:03] He says, "I do believe that every
[2:00:05] Christian is obligated to pay tithes
[2:00:08] because it is a commandment of the
[2:00:11] Lord." He says, "And blessed are they
[2:00:14] that do all his commandments that they
[2:00:17] might have right to enter into the life,
[2:00:20] the tree of life." Now, I do I I do
[2:00:23] believe that tithe paying is essential
[2:00:24] to a Christian experience for I'll uh
[2:00:27] I'll get to that in another question a
[2:00:30] few minutes. I know there's another one
[2:00:31] in here pertaining to that. All right.
[2:00:33] He um uh is going to skip down here to
[2:00:37] another uh question in the same message.
[2:00:41] And he the question is um
[2:00:45] just put this is don't you feel that
[2:00:50] everyone
[2:00:51] don't you feel that everyone put that in
[2:00:54] just like that. Don't you feel that
[2:00:55] everyone who claims to be a Christian
[2:00:58] should pay tithes, pay their tithes into
[2:01:01] the storehouse of the Lord? And they
[2:01:03] said, please give us scripture to this
[2:01:05] question. So, brother Brandon was
[2:01:08] dealing with it in the same message, God
[2:01:09] being misunderstood.
[2:01:11] He says, all right. He says, if you
[2:01:14] will, that is right. That the Bible said
[2:01:16] in Malachi the fourth chapter. Now, it
[2:01:19] wasn't the fourth chapter. It was the
[2:01:20] third chapter. We just read it. It's
[2:01:22] Malachi the third chapter. If you just
[2:01:24] put in, don't you feel that everyone uh
[2:01:28] it says that is that is right that that
[2:01:30] the Bible said in Malachi the 4th
[2:01:32] chapter will a man rob God and you say
[2:01:35] where have we robbed thee in tithes and
[2:01:38] offerings? Bring all your tithe and
[2:01:40] offerings into my storehouse and prove
[2:01:42] me sayith the Lord if I will not open up
[2:01:44] the windows of heaven and pour out a
[2:01:47] blessing that there'll not be room
[2:01:49] enough to receive. He says that's a
[2:01:52] challenge to any individual.
[2:01:56] He said that's a challenge to any
[2:01:58] individual. And if I only had the time
[2:02:01] and would not get to this little
[2:02:03] scripture that I wish to get to about
[2:02:04] the next 10 minutes, I would like to
[2:02:07] give you a personal testimony how that I
[2:02:09] was even hungry and my mother and them
[2:02:11] hungry and my daddy sick, but I took my
[2:02:16] tithes, Amen, out first and give it to
[2:02:19] God. And you ought to see what happened.
[2:02:22] I have never seen in my life that any
[2:02:24] man or a woman that if you only make $1
[2:02:27] a week will bring the 10 cents of that
[2:02:29] money and put it into your storehouse,
[2:02:31] your church where you come. If if God
[2:02:34] don't bless that, call me a hypocrite.
[2:02:37] Yes, sir. That's a challenge to anybody.
[2:02:39] And every Christian that goes to this go
[2:02:41] that goes to this other question. Every
[2:02:42] Christian should pay tithes. That's
[2:02:45] right. It should be done.
[2:02:49] You know, Brother Brandham said if he
[2:02:51] had time, he would just share
[2:02:52] testimonies of how God has blessed
[2:02:57] um in paying tithes.
[2:03:00] And and and I'm one that I can share my
[2:03:03] own testimonies because I I pay ti.
[2:03:06] I pay ti.
[2:03:09] I've been paying them all my life. And
[2:03:12] um and I have seen God bless. The
[2:03:15] biggest blessing that I saw in my own
[2:03:17] life is when uh I lost my job and um
[2:03:23] uh I mean I had a job 14 years had been
[2:03:26] working here at this place and here they
[2:03:29] come and and just fire me. You're done.
[2:03:33] You're you're done. It's over with. And
[2:03:35] I got I got I got no income. Uh and um
[2:03:41] and you know here I am. you know, I
[2:03:44] still got house payment. I got all this
[2:03:45] and I don't know, you know, how are we
[2:03:46] going to get this thing worked out and
[2:03:48] we got behind trying to, you know, uh,
[2:03:52] sort out the bills. I think I was out of
[2:03:53] work for a number of months and we got
[2:03:56] way behind trying to sort out the bills.
[2:03:57] And the biggest bill that we got behind
[2:03:58] on was our house note. And anybody know
[2:04:02] when you get behind on a house note,
[2:04:05] uh, if you ain't pay for the house in
[2:04:06] cash, uh, and kept the taxes up, other
[2:04:10] people own your house. bank on the
[2:04:13] house. So the bank, you know, sent um
[2:04:16] was sending letters. I'm like, Lord,
[2:04:17] ain't nothing I can do here. Oh my. But
[2:04:20] here come God. Uh the policeman come
[2:04:24] early one morning knocking on the door,
[2:04:25] baming on my door. I'm like, I know I
[2:04:27] ain't done nothing wrong. Why the police
[2:04:28] at my house? What's going on? My wife
[2:04:31] wake me up. The police out there. I
[2:04:32] don't know what's going on. Police step
[2:04:34] outside. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Say,
[2:04:36] I'm just here to serve you these papers.
[2:04:39] Open up the papers. Thanks. So they
[2:04:41] coming to get the house. It's Lord
[2:04:43] Jesus. Well, I said the Lord giveth, the
[2:04:48] Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of
[2:04:51] the Lord. Ain't nothing I can do right
[2:04:53] now. Nothing I can do but just leave
[2:04:55] this thing in God's hand. But before the
[2:04:58] bank come to take the house, God
[2:05:00] actually orchestrated where uh the
[2:05:03] salary that I I got a job, but my salary
[2:05:06] was less than what I was making before.
[2:05:08] So when I got this new job, the less
[2:05:10] salary. The bank decided that they would
[2:05:13] uh reconstruct the loan or redo the loan
[2:05:16] to actually lower the payments down to
[2:05:18] something I could afford with my new
[2:05:20] job. That was God rebuking
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; the devourer for my sake.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; When God changed everything into my
[2:05:30] favor, that and I'm telling you, look,
[2:05:32] look, I'm here to tell you right now,
[2:05:34] God knows the plans
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; that he has for you. And these are plans
[2:05:39] to prosper, to give you hope and a
[2:05:40] future, not to take from you, but to add
[2:05:42] to you.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm on my way to being a poor man
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; with two houses.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Right? So, church, I'm I'm I I'm a
[2:05:54] living witness. I don't seen it happen
[2:05:56] too many times in my own life where God
[2:05:58] has manifested himself because I was a
[2:06:01] faithful tithe and offering payer.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, I challenge
[2:06:05] anybody do the same thing. And you take
[2:06:08] God at his word and you watch what God
[2:06:09] do. It's it's it's a promise from God.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm going tell you, he don't fail.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; He don't fail.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; I don't care how tight it get.
[2:06:21] Put God's money out there first.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; But we got to get this car fixed. Put
[2:06:25] God's money out there first.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Don't play with God's money. I I showed
[2:06:33] you now when you when you and and
[2:06:34] hopefully y'all remember that if you if
[2:06:36] you take it from God, take that that
[2:06:38] take take a portion of tithe to put it
[2:06:39] towards something else. God said he want
[2:06:41] 20% on top of that. I never got Look, I
[2:06:46] get behind with this fella
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; and I get behind with that fella,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; but I ain't gonna never get behind with
[2:06:53] God.
