[42:09] blessed uh by what you all
[42:12] uh have decided to do and and
[42:17] amen i feel like the lord is already
[42:21] working
[42:22] uh there is a um a gentleman there that

[42:58] primary reasons why we are still
[43:00] here we haven't taken a raptors because
[43:02] we haven't found

[43:07] to get out there and find that last seed

[43:10] and we don't know if they're right here
[43:11] in our city but let's do it we can

[44:06] brother
[44:06] i'll i'll make mention of it and we'll
[44:09] see you know what what what happened so
[44:12] if you desire to go and be a part of
[44:13] that it'll just be one night of hotel
[44:15] stay
[44:16] it's just that saturday night but if you
[44:18] desire to go he's not having like a
[44:20] really big meeting
[44:21] uh you know you understand with the the
[44:23] the the conditions of the pandemic a lot
[44:25] of people just not having big meetings
[44:27] but
[44:27] uh still want to have some fellowship
[44:30] right
[44:30] and uh you know so we uh you know he
[44:33] asked me to come and
[44:34] and i felt that well you came for us in
[44:36] february
[44:37] right so we have to return the favor
[44:41] praise the lord and and i do want to let
[44:43] you know he actually came here during
[44:45] the pandemic
[44:47] now we just it wasn't announced by the
[44:50] media
[44:51] and and everybody but the pandemic was
[44:53] happening on way back then
[44:55] pandemic probably started actually you
[44:57] know it's 2019
[44:59] it started well it's called covet 19.
[45:03] it started in 2019. amen
[45:06] so and we was worshiping even in the
[45:08] midst of it
[45:10] only thing changed is when the media
[45:12] start propagating
[45:14] right that that's when things really got
[45:18] that's when we started doing all kind of
[45:19] different things you know
[45:21] because the media had you never heard
[45:23] nothing
[45:24] you'd still be going on doing what you
[45:26] were doing right and it's okay i mean
[45:28] it's good that they give us something
[45:29] but sometimes you got to be careful
[45:31] because they do
[45:32] want to control you with the information
[45:34] that they decide
[45:36] to give you all right amen but we got
[45:39] something greater than what the media
[45:40] got we got the word of god
[45:42] amen and we we're going to do that so if
[45:45] you desire a man to go and be a part
[45:47] please let me know
[45:48] i'm gonna have to try to let him know
[45:49] this uh this week just what our plans
[45:52] are so if you desire to be a part of it
[45:54] just pray about it
[45:55] and um you know if you feel a spirit to
[45:58] to go and be a part of it let me know if
[46:01] you don't it's quite all right we have
[46:02] church here too
[46:03] you know so uh either way but we we
[46:06] thank god and i know that we're gonna be
[46:07] having a lot of visitors passing through
[46:09] here and
[46:10] everybody like to come south during the
[46:13] during the
[46:13] winter so we're going to have a few
[46:15] visitors passing through i know brother
[46:17] john
[46:17] i'm sorry brother paul lafontaine he's
[46:19] planning on passing through sometime
[46:21] soon and amen and i'll be looking
[46:24] forward to that brother trevor be
[46:25] passing
[46:26] uh sometime soon we'll be looking
[46:27] forward to that and
[46:29] god just uh god is good god is good so
[46:33] uh just keep those things in mind if you
[46:34] don't mind let's go back to our
[46:36] scripture here in john chapter one
[46:38] i trust today we will be able to bring a
[46:41] close to just
[46:42] this portion of our journey
[46:45] a man uh we've been stepping into a
[46:48] vision
[46:49] and you know i've been uh praying
[46:52] uh share with you all uh about the uh
[46:56] dream that a precious brother had there
[46:58] in um
[47:00] uh brother carlos uh there in south
[47:03] america
[47:04] and you know that that dream um you know
[47:07] of him
[47:08] not being able to pick up uh the rhythm
[47:11] and then um sister birds went to the
[47:14] piano that that that's god
[47:16] right and and i know that the the enemy
[47:19] is gonna fight those that were part of
[47:22] the vision
[47:23] but the the thing of it is if you are
[47:25] part of a
[47:26] vision you can't get out of it
[47:29] and let me put it this way if you're a
[47:32] part of the vision there's no
[47:34] substitutes
[47:37] right it's your place it's your part
[47:41] and if god said that you were supposed
[47:43] to be there then you've got to come to
[47:44] it
[47:45] i don't know how it's going to happen
[47:47] but you are a part of the vision
[47:49] right so i want you to pray for these
[47:51] families that were part of that vision
[47:53] god know what he's doing right amen and
[47:57] and now it said they that he initially
[48:00] couldn't catch the rhythm
[48:02] right initially he couldn't catch it
[48:04] right but he's a musician
[48:06] and eventually that musician gonna get
[48:08] it glory to god somebody
[48:11] all right eventually eventually
[48:13] musicians gonna get the rhythm so
[48:15] you know i'm just praying that god will
[48:17] just you know let those that that's a
[48:19] part of his vision
[48:20] come into uh their place that's that's
[48:23] what i'm looking for
[48:24] so keep those families in prayer amen uh
[48:27] this has been a supernatural year
[48:29] amen a supernatural year and we're still
[48:31] dealing with supernatural things
[48:34] last sunday was supernatural praise god
[48:39] oh lord let me try to read this but uh
[48:41] uh
[48:43] i i mentioned to the church
[48:47] i said now the devil ain't gonna like
[48:49] this
[48:50] and i said the devil gonna fight
[48:53] some of y'all as soon as y'all got out
[48:54] of the church y'all had a fight
[48:56] all right and some it came later in the
[48:58] week
[49:00] but i hope you realize that we didn't
[49:02] just stop at the fight
[49:04] i said we also expecting victory
[49:11] and i need you to understand one of the
[49:13] greatest weapons you got brother troy
[49:15] told
[49:16] us come in here and reload
[49:21] reload your weapons right
[49:25] so so so and last week we were given a
[49:27] weapon
[49:29] and i hope you used it when you came
[49:31] into contact with your trial
[49:33] the weapon that you were actually given
[49:36] was to open your
[49:37] mouth so when the thing come against you
[49:42] you come against it how
[49:43] with your mouth
[49:48] your mouth will change the situation
[49:51] what you allow to come
[49:52] out of your mouth and what the lord told
[49:55] us is open it wider
[49:58] and wider and wider
[50:01] oh god there's a lot in there
[50:04] i i there the scripture hit me you know
[50:07] and i'm gonna get to my message here in
[50:09] a second i got y'all standing up i'm
[50:10] sorry
[50:11] uh but but uh but but the scripture hit
[50:13] me uh i believe the prophet told them
[50:16] told the king say now
[50:17] uh shoot some arrows out the window
[50:20] come on somebody say shoot the arrows
[50:22] out out the window you know cause it's
[50:24] gonna represent something
[50:26] and they say now get the arrow and after
[50:28] you get it break it on the ground
[50:30] just break it and so the man took his he
[50:33] struck it they say break it as many
[50:36] times and get
[50:37] upset and break this thing man so he
[50:39] took it he struck it
[50:40] struck it uh twice and i think he got it
[50:42] three times and then he just stopped
[50:47] he just just stopped or the prophet
[50:50] looked at him
[50:51] man you should have broke the thing more
[50:53] than that
[50:54] say this was representing something you
[50:56] didn't catch it
[50:58] and what i'm trying to say is you should
[50:59] have spoke more than that
[51:01] it was representing something and you
[51:04] didn't catch it church
[51:06] hallelujah somebody amen
[51:09] open your mouth wide and wide and wider

[51:20] and as i was driving back from uh saying
[51:23] augustine yesterday it just
[51:25] the holy spirit hit me said they say i

[51:36] under the anointing
[51:37] i'm speaking according to what god told
[51:38] me this told me to say
[51:40] right he said open your mouth why did he
[51:42] say that's what he want to do i'm
[51:43] speaking to it now how every coming line
[51:47] has just come in line
[51:49] when god said let there be light
[51:52] that there you go that's it's just that
[51:55] simple
[51:55] how light got there ain't my problem
[51:59] i ain't even trying to figure it out all

[52:10] how god gonna turn that around

[52:26] [Applause]
[52:28] hallelujah so i'm just i'm i'm just
[52:31] blessed
[52:32] and i know the devil don't like me and i
[52:34] don't like him so
[52:36] i got mutual feelings
[52:40] [Laughter]
[52:43] all right so let me try to read a man
[52:47] uh here i want that john 1 is where
[52:49] we've been reading from
[52:51] um we've been on a
[52:54] portion of our journey of stepping into
[52:57] the vision
[52:58] uh this year god has given us this
[53:00] series and we're coming
[53:02] to the end i didn't know it was going to
[53:04] last the whole year
[53:05] i didn't know that when i started
[53:07] preaching in january
[53:09] but god knows all things and and he's
[53:12] just been giving us the inspiration and
[53:13] we've just been following it
[53:15] and um i mean i think 2020
[53:18] was a perfect year for a message about
[53:21] vision
[53:22] all right so i'm grateful uh for that
[53:25] uh here i'll just pick up um
[53:30] verse 29. you know they were
[53:34] asking john these questions while he was
[53:37] baptizing
[53:38] wanting to know if he was the elijah um
[53:43] that prophet you know and he answered no
[53:46] and
[53:47] they're like well who are you say i'm
[53:48] the voice of one crying out in the
[53:50] wilderness as
[53:51] as spoken by isaiah now he's telling
[53:53] where to find it that in the words
[53:56] uh but they're they're having a problem
[53:58] with um
[53:59] just being open to that scripture
[54:02] they're looking at the other ones but
[54:03] that scripture they didn't want to be
[54:04] open to so uh here you know we we have
[54:07] similar issues today people don't want
[54:09] to be open to certain scriptures
[54:11] uh but uh but nonetheless is being
[54:12] fulfilled and um
[54:14] uh here i'm picking up in verse 29 uh
[54:18] you know it says the next day
[54:21] john seeth jesus coming unto him and
[54:24] saith behold the lamb of god
[54:26] which taketh away the sin of the world
[54:29] now i want to tell you something
[54:31] jesus came to take away
[54:36] your sin
[54:40] praise the lord amen if you are here
[54:43] today and you living in
[54:45] sin jesus
[54:48] came to take away your sin
[54:55] all right behold the lamb of god which
[54:57] taketh away the sin of the world
[54:59] this is he of whom i said after me
[55:02] cometh a man
[55:03] which is preferred before me for he was
[55:06] before me
[55:07] and i knew him not but that he should be
[55:10] made manifest to israel therefore am i
[55:13] come baptizing with water
[55:15] and john bear record saying i saw the
[55:17] spirit
[55:18] this is what john said now i saw the
[55:21] spirit
[55:22] descending from heaven like a dove and
[55:25] it'll bold upon him
[55:26] that's john's testimony right and i knew
[55:29] him not
[55:30] but he that sent me to baptize with
[55:33] water
[55:34] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[55:36] shalt see
[55:37] the spirit descending and remaining
[55:40] on praise god that's so that's so
[55:43] critical to me
[55:44] i thank god for the dissension of the
[55:46] spirit last week but it's got to remain
[55:49] it's got to stay already god said and
[55:52] remaining on him
[55:54] the same as he which baptizes with the
[55:57] holy ghost
[55:59] amen if you've been baptized in water
[56:00] that's great but we want to see you
[56:02] baptized with the holy ghost
[56:04] right and i saw and bear record that
[56:07] this
[56:08] is the son of god the lord had a
[56:11] blessing
[56:12] to the reading of his word shall we pray
[56:14] oh
[56:15] glory thank you jesus
[56:18] father we thank you for the
[56:22] uh privilege of
[56:26] coming into the house of god thank you
[56:29] that we
[56:29] can hear uh the word of god we can
[56:33] enter him to fellowship uh and end him
[56:35] to worship
[56:37] thank you for these these great things
[56:38] it's just something about coming to
[56:40] church that
[56:41] changes uh whatever we're we're going
[56:44] through and what we're facing what we're
[56:46] dealing with it's something about
[56:47] just being able to get into the presence
[56:50] of the lord you just feel like
[56:51] everything um
[56:52] just work out just fine and uh god i
[56:55] just
[56:55] appreciate that um i can fellowship with
[56:58] saints of like precious faith i
[57:00] appreciate that
[57:01] lord we can gather in this little place
[57:03] and and just enjoy
[57:06] your presence but god we realize that as
[57:08] we come
[57:09] there are different burdens and
[57:10] different hearts there are different
[57:12] things different trials that the people
[57:13] face
[57:14] since last week we realized that and
[57:17] lord that that weight
[57:19] comes into the house of god but lord we
[57:22] are making an effort to lay aside
[57:25] every sin and every weight
[57:28] that so easily besets us and sometimes
[57:32] lord
[57:32] it might be a push to say amen it
[57:35] it might be uh it might be a sacrifice
[57:38] to
[57:39] lord just to persevere but i pray that
[57:41] you give strength to the people
[57:43] god that they would break through the
[57:45] barrier that the enemy has put before
[57:47] them
[57:48] lord these are nothing but scarecrows
[57:50] amen uh scarecrows are trying to stop us
[57:52] from going into the field
[57:54] and getting the beat have been planted
[57:56] but oh god we press beyond the
[57:58] scarecrows and
[57:59] we're going to enjoy the presence of the
[58:01] lord hallelujah
[58:03] father we just trust that you would just
[58:04] take control over every spirit
[58:06] and father your holy spirit would have
[58:09] the preeminence
[58:10] and this service god we release you to
[58:13] have your way
[58:14] satan you are not welcome here
[58:18] hallelujah you're not welcome here and
[58:21] amen before
[58:22] we even get started in the sermon we are
[58:23] serving you your eviction notice
[58:26] praise god amen it's time for you to
[58:29] leave
[58:30] amen you're not welcome here lord so we
[58:33] just
[58:34] invite your very presence to have the
[58:36] preeminence amen in this place
[58:39] even now god in jesus name we pray amen
[58:43] and amen the lord bless you you can be
[58:46] seated
[58:47] in the presence of the lord amen
[58:51] we are continuing our journey with
[58:54] vindicated
[58:55] truths vindicated
[58:58] truths uh praise god
[59:01] um and you know we just want to
[59:05] just uh uh get into this just a little
[59:08] bit
[59:09] uh uh last week the lord just kind of
[59:11] put in my
[59:12] my spirit just to really put a lot more
[59:14] emphasis on the lord jesus and how
[59:17] he was vindicated his his birth was
[59:20] actually spoken of in scripture uh
[59:23] his death and what happened at the cross
[59:26] i didn't say this last week but
[59:28] his death was even spoken of in
[59:30] scripture right
[59:31] in the book of isaiah it talked about
[59:34] him
[59:34] dying between malfactors right so here
[59:38] they thought it was um you know
[59:42] just happenstance on the day that jesus
[59:45] actually
[59:46] died and he goes and there's two thieves
[59:48] on the cross
[59:49] now isaiah didn't call them thieves
[59:51] isaiah called them malfactors
[59:53] right amen right so so here these two
[59:56] thieves on the cross
[59:58] they are they're actually fulfilling the
[1:00:00] word of god
[1:00:01] by dying right next to jesus on that day
[1:00:04] it was not happenstance it was not amen
[1:00:07] by chance but it was the fulfillment of
[1:00:09] god's word
[1:00:11] sometimes things happen in your life
[1:00:14] and you don't realize that all you're
[1:00:16] doing is manifesting what has already
[1:00:18] been written
[1:00:19] amen that's why you have to look at your
[1:00:21] situation i don't care what it is i
[1:00:23] i say i don't care what it is
[1:00:27] amen it's it's categorized as a
[1:00:30] thing right right and since it's
[1:00:32] categorized
[1:00:33] as a thing we put things in buckets
[1:00:40] you understand amen we put things in
[1:00:43] buckets and
[1:00:44] the bucket that i have on my desk is all
[1:00:46] things
[1:00:47] work together for good to them amen that
[1:00:50] love god unto them who are
[1:00:52] called according to his purpose so we
[1:00:54] have to we have to rise up above
[1:00:56] our things amen

[1:01:23] to church to glorify my problem
[1:01:26] come on church i come to get something
[1:01:28] from god something that'll change the
[1:01:30] problem
[1:01:31] something that'll change the situation
[1:01:34] hallelujah
[1:01:35] all right church amen amen amen amen
[1:01:38] amen hallelujah glory i mean if
[1:01:42] if there was ever a service that the
[1:01:45] whole
[1:01:45] church should be on fire
[1:01:49] amen it should be this service
[1:01:51] especially after what your eyes
[1:01:53] witnessed
[1:01:54] especially after what you experienced if
[1:01:57] there was
[1:01:58] ever service for people to be on fire
[1:02:03] it's this service right here hallelujah
[1:02:06] church
[1:02:07] all right all right all right so we
[1:02:10] found out a man a few weeks ago god
[1:02:12] always vindicates the truth
[1:02:15] amen always vindicates the truth i find
[1:02:18] it quite amazing that we're
[1:02:19] preaching vindicated truths and god
[1:02:21] comes and vindicates his truth right
[1:02:22] here amongst us
[1:02:24] amen uh when when god vindicates
[1:02:26] something
[1:02:27] he is actually clearing all suspicion
[1:02:30] amen uh i mean there should be no more
[1:02:33] questions
[1:02:34] uh when god amen vindicates it it just
[1:02:37] it settles everything
[1:02:39] glory to god right amen uh we found out
[1:02:42] truth will stand the test of time truth
[1:02:46] will never change
[1:02:47] uh truth will gain strength under
[1:02:49] pressure
[1:02:51] hallelujah glory to god so so you know
[1:02:54] we're just kind of going back over a
[1:02:55] couple of things that we uh
[1:02:57] that we hit uh here in our journey and i
[1:03:00] just want to kind of bring us forth we
[1:03:02] put some emphasis on the lord jesus
[1:03:04] on last week we the first week we talked
[1:03:06] about john the baptist and
[1:03:08] you know when and as we read this
[1:03:10] scripture here in john chapter 1
[1:03:12] uh when when jesus came to john
[1:03:16] praise god it was actually jesus
[1:03:19] vindicating who john was
[1:03:21] glory to god it was a vindication
[1:03:24] because uh here we got the word
[1:03:26] which is the lord jesus himself coming
[1:03:28] to the prophet
[1:03:30] praise god amen so so when jesus
[1:03:33] shows up at john's church amen
[1:03:36] it's actually vindicating john's
[1:03:38] ministry that the day before john had
[1:03:40] all kind of questions from all these
[1:03:42] other
[1:03:43] religious leaders said who you are what
[1:03:45] is this and i mean what
[1:03:46] ministry that you uh that that you have
[1:03:48] what is how do we identify this in
[1:03:50] scripture
[1:03:50] give us an answer well jesus comes along
[1:03:53] and vindicates who john
[1:03:55] is and by john having the privilege of
[1:03:59] baptizing jesus john actually and also
[1:04:02] seeing a vision
[1:04:03] that who he sees the spirit rest in a
[1:04:06] bottle
[1:04:06] that is the son of god john amen
[1:04:09] vindicates who jesus is
[1:04:12] oh i love this church i love this
[1:04:16] so let's go on a little further amen in
[1:04:19] this i want to pick up a quote
[1:04:21] my maybe a couple quotes here uh just to
[1:04:25] just to uh set this up this this first
[1:04:28] one is gonna come out of uh
[1:04:30] pergaming church age and um um
[1:04:33] uh this is the vision where we're still
[1:04:35] in uh where
[1:04:36] the angel was told uh the angel told the
[1:04:39] prophet pick up your pen and write we're
[1:04:40] still in this vision so this is a
[1:04:42] portion of it
[1:04:43] uh brother branham says this this is
[1:04:45] what he wrote that the angel told him to
[1:04:46] to write said the last day messenger
[1:04:50] uh will appear in god's appointed time
[1:04:54] it is the end time now as
[1:04:57] all know for israel is in the homeland
[1:05:01] glory to god amen uh it says
[1:05:05] and any time now he will
[1:05:08] come according to malachim at 176 2.
[1:05:11] so he will come according to malachi
[1:05:14] when we see
[1:05:15] him he will be dedicated to the word
[1:05:19] he will be indicated which means
[1:05:22] pointed out uh pointed out in the word
[1:05:24] revelation 10 7. so
[1:05:26] here we all if it's indicated it's in
[1:05:28] the word then we just got to look for
[1:05:30] this to be manifested because
[1:05:31] it's it's it's a promise right so it
[1:05:33] says pointed out in the word revelation
[1:05:35] 10 7
[1:05:36] and god will vindicate his ministry
[1:05:39] i like that statement
[1:05:42] yeah here's here i want you to get this
[1:05:45] this is something to underline
[1:05:46] god will
[1:05:51] vindicate his ministry
[1:05:55] that means that means god will
[1:05:58] settle all suspicion
[1:06:03] look i don't have to settle the
[1:06:05] suspicion
[1:06:07] i don't have to answer your questions
[1:06:09] right if you got
[1:06:10] questions ask god because
[1:06:13] god is the one that indicated in the
[1:06:16] scripture
[1:06:16] that he was coming oh hallelujah amen
[1:06:20] i'm not
[1:06:21] the uh the the the the the lawyer
[1:06:24] of the message i just happen to be a
[1:06:27] believer
[1:06:31] hear the quote i mean the angel the lord
[1:06:33] say pick up your penis right now angel's
[1:06:36] telling the prophet
[1:06:37] god will vindicate
[1:06:42] i love it god will vindicate his
[1:06:44] ministry
[1:06:45] he will preach the truth as did elijah
[1:06:48] and be ready for the mount zion showdown
[1:06:51] now i want you to catch that because
[1:06:53] hey man when you read that same quote
[1:06:55] over in uh
[1:06:57] uh um uh uh my the spoke words original
[1:07:00] seed
[1:07:01] he called it the mount zion rapture
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:06] so what i want you to get is that the
[1:07:08] showdown
[1:07:10] like it was in the in the days of elijah
[1:07:12] when it came in and said uh
[1:07:14] you know the god that answered by fire
[1:07:17] let him be god that was a showdown
[1:07:21] hallelujah and elijah found himself
[1:07:24] standing alone
[1:07:26] amongst all these uh uh make-believe
[1:07:28] prophets
[1:07:30] all these uh jazzy bell-raised prophets
[1:07:35] oh i can go on that you coming out the
[1:07:37] denomination system your jesse bell
[1:07:40] raised
[1:07:40] prophet praise god amen it's the truth
[1:07:45] any high
[1:07:46] amen but here he stands against all them
[1:07:48] and at the showdown god proved
[1:07:50] whose side he was on when elijah laid
[1:07:53] out that altar
[1:07:54] and put his sacrifice up there and god
[1:07:56] came and answered by fire
[1:07:58] amen it god vindicated elijah
[1:08:02] now how are we going to get right here
[1:08:03] here this this this prophet is coming
[1:08:06] and he's got he preached the truth as
[1:08:08] did elijah and be
[1:08:09] and be ready for the mount zion showdown
[1:08:12] which is the rapture
[1:08:13] this message is preparing us for rapture
[1:08:18] now let me also go a little further i
[1:08:20] read it to you last week i won't
[1:08:21] i'm i'm gonna go back to that real quick
[1:08:23] in a second but i read it to you last
[1:08:25] week
[1:08:25] uh we we are living in a time of
[1:08:28] vindication
[1:08:30] justice the last election was actually a
[1:08:34] vindication
[1:08:35] that something that the prophet spoke 87
[1:08:38] years ago
[1:08:40] and i know there are some people that
[1:08:42] just ain't ready to accept it
[1:08:45] i understand that and and and let me
[1:08:48] just preface this i'm not on
[1:08:50] either side i mean i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm
[1:08:55] just
[1:08:56] that's just the way the lord did me this
[1:08:58] is the way he made me
[1:09:00] when i had the the opportunity at 18
[1:09:03] years old i'm in my 50s now
[1:09:06] well 18 17 18 and i had the opportunity
[1:09:09] to register to vote
[1:09:12] even back then i didn't know what i know
[1:09:14] now but i did not register as democrat
[1:09:17] or
[1:09:18] republican back then i registered
[1:09:21] independent and i'm still independent
[1:09:24] so it don't bother me either way praise
[1:09:27] the lord i won't
[1:09:28] i've got to put that that disclaimer out
[1:09:30] there it don't bot
[1:09:32] whoever come to the white house is
[1:09:34] actually fulfilling
[1:09:36] scripture
[1:09:40] so i got one prayer
[1:09:44] even so come lord jesus and i and i'm
[1:09:48] gonna tell y'all something i'ma just
[1:09:50] i'ma just have to put jesus
[1:09:53] said as it was
[1:09:56] in the days of lot
[1:09:59] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:10:03] of man
[1:10:03] so before jesus returns again it has to
[1:10:07] be like it was
[1:10:08] in the bible amen
[1:10:11] and i'ma go a little further your vote
[1:10:13] can't stop a prophecy
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:19] even if you don't vote you can't stop
[1:10:22] prophecy
[1:10:25] so for me i look at prophecy above
[1:10:27] anything
[1:10:29] because prophecy has been vindicated
[1:10:31] right before my very eyes
[1:10:32] and hear a prophet come along and tell
[1:10:33] us now these are seven things that's
[1:10:35] gonna happen before the lord returns
[1:10:37] he goes on uh he actually gives us a
[1:10:39] magnifying glass on top of what jesus
[1:10:42] said
[1:10:44] praise the lord i'm watching what the
[1:10:46] prophet saying i
[1:10:47] i look i ain't watching nothing else but
[1:10:49] what a prophet saying
[1:10:51] all right church so if six of the seven
[1:10:54] have been hit
[1:10:56] then where how close are we then how
[1:10:58] close are we
[1:11:00] praise the lord i mean we're close
[1:11:02] enough for you to stop
[1:11:03] sinning
[1:11:06] we're that close for you to stop sinning
[1:11:09] praise the lord amen get your life right
[1:11:12] with god
[1:11:13] i'm going further in this quote many
[1:11:16] will misunderstand him because they have
[1:11:20] been taught scripture in a certain way
[1:11:22] which they consider truth right when he
[1:11:25] comes against that
[1:11:27] they will not believe even some true
[1:11:29] ministers will misunderstand the
[1:11:31] messenger
[1:11:32] because so much has been called god's
[1:11:34] truth by
[1:11:35] deceivers
[1:11:38] so here's the aim to tell us that we got
[1:11:40] to be careful that we got to watch these
[1:11:41] two spirits in the framework of the
[1:11:43] church
[1:11:44] you know and and and the other thing
[1:11:46] when you're watching this now
[1:11:47] um when you're kind of watching satan
[1:11:50] you got to look at them from a religious
[1:11:52] angle right come on church
[1:11:55] right and when we look i mean don't look
[1:11:57] at no devil with no
[1:11:58] no no pitchfork and two horns that
[1:12:02] that that's a that's a nursery rhyme or
[1:12:04] something that i mean this devil is
[1:12:06] slick
[1:12:08] praise god amen he gets involved in
[1:12:11] church
[1:12:12] so you got to watch him from that angle
[1:12:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:16] people want to go to church amen where
[1:12:19] the pastor won't say nothing to to come
[1:12:21] against the
[1:12:22] i mean to come against what's going on
[1:12:23] in their life they they want to church
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:25] it's just love let me tell you if your
[1:12:27] pastor called out your sin it ain't love
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:32] amen amen praise
[1:12:36] god because love is corrective
[1:12:39] all right all right and it's not just a
[1:12:40] pastor any minister to come up here and
[1:12:42] call something out
[1:12:43] amen it's correct of love supposed i
[1:12:46] mean
[1:12:46] the word supposed to do that all right
[1:12:48] let's go on a little further yes yes the
[1:12:49] word will get all up in your feelings
[1:12:53] yes it will but it's only to help you
[1:12:55] that's all
[1:12:56] that's all that's all it's just to help
[1:12:58] you i'm going further later to see a
[1:13:00] church age i got to try to get to
[1:13:02] something if i can here today let us see
[1:13:04] in church h um
[1:13:06] we see john in scripture we see
[1:13:09] jesus in scripture uh but we also
[1:13:13] i was telling you all on last week and
[1:13:16] you can just line this quote up and
[1:13:17] later see in church age paragraph 3
[1:13:19] 3 27 1 i'm coming to it uh i was telling
[1:13:21] you all last week
[1:13:22] brother branham said now when uh john
[1:13:24] and jesus
[1:13:26] were actually standing there in um
[1:13:29] in the water and john was baptizing
[1:13:31] jesus say here was the two most
[1:13:33] important people on the earth standing
[1:13:36] there at that time
[1:13:37] greater than the king greater than the
[1:13:40] the priest
[1:13:41] the high priest the two most important
[1:13:44] people on the earth was standing in
[1:13:46] the river at that time the jordan river
[1:13:48] praise god
[1:13:49] right and here god was vindicating
[1:13:51] john's ministry
[1:13:52] and john is also vindicating jesus
[1:13:55] because he said
[1:13:55] the the same god that sent me out here
[1:13:57] and told me the one that you see the
[1:13:59] spirit descending on and abiding
[1:14:01] that's him that's the son of god john
[1:14:04] got a little discouraged
[1:14:06] after he went to prison praise god
[1:14:08] hallelujah
[1:14:09] that's the way some of us we you know
[1:14:11] after we went through a little trial
[1:14:12] this week we got a little discouraged
[1:14:16] hey man we got a little discouraged with
[1:14:19] the mystery with the trial
[1:14:20] don't get discouraged get encouraged
[1:14:24] get encouraged glory to god that's the
[1:14:26] time to give god your best praise
[1:14:31] i mean when when praise demands a
[1:14:33] sacrifice
[1:14:34] i'll worship them it's it's easy to
[1:14:36] worship god when everything's going well
[1:14:40] amen crazy i mean it's just so easy to
[1:14:43] have a big smile
[1:14:44] but when you're on the stream when
[1:14:47] you're under struggle a little bit a
[1:14:49] little pressure on you
[1:14:50] and i'm gonna tell you something a man a
[1:14:52] man is what he is
[1:14:54] and a woman is what she is when they are
[1:14:56] under pressure
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:01] the devil found out a long time ago
[1:15:03] about me when i'm under pressure i
[1:15:05] praise
[1:15:08] oh come on somebody when i'm under
[1:15:10] pressure i praise
[1:15:12] glory hallelujah all right now uh i'm
[1:15:15] going
[1:15:15] i want to go a little further here let
[1:15:17] us see in church age
[1:15:19] this quote says now this message of
[1:15:21] malachi 4
[1:15:22] revelation 10 7 so now he's supposed to
[1:15:24] be identified in the word we're finding
[1:15:26] him in the word malachi
[1:15:27] 4 says it revelation 10 7 says it all
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:30] now this message of malachi 4 in
[1:15:32] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:15:34] things
[1:15:35] one according to malachi 4 he
[1:15:39] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:15:42] the fathers
[1:15:43] so that's brother branham's ministry
[1:15:45] turn our heart amen of the children
[1:15:47] to the father to he will
[1:15:51] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:15:53] thunders in
[1:15:54] revelation 10. and he also tells us what
[1:15:58] it is
[1:15:58] which are the revelations contained
[1:16:01] in the seven seals so if you want to
[1:16:04] know what the seven
[1:16:05] thunders was go back and listen to the
[1:16:07] seals
[1:16:08] every seal amen was revealing uh what
[1:16:12] god was trying to say in those thunders
[1:16:14] my god each seal was revealing that all
[1:16:16] right it says so
[1:16:17] there he will reveal the mysteries of
[1:16:19] the seven thunders in revelation 10
[1:16:21] which are the revelations contained in
[1:16:24] the seven seals
[1:16:25] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:16:28] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:16:31] hearts of the children
[1:16:32] to the pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:16:36] now he goes on a little further in this
[1:16:38] in this in this quote and i just want to
[1:16:40] keep reading
[1:16:40] he says i want to make one more
[1:16:43] comparison
[1:16:45] hallelujah between the latest in prophet
[1:16:48] messenger
[1:16:49] and john the prophet messenger
[1:16:53] now remember i read to you amen out of
[1:16:55] scripture on last week
[1:16:57] how um the when when john got a little
[1:16:59] discouraged he sent his two disciples to
[1:17:01] jesus
[1:17:02] and he's and while he's in prison he's
[1:17:04] saying just go ask him
[1:17:06] are you he or should we look for another
[1:17:08] and here they come and and jesus already
[1:17:11] knew what was on their
[1:17:12] what was on their mind and i'm giving
[1:17:14] you a prophetic view of this scripture
[1:17:16] because brother branham tells us that
[1:17:18] jesus told them just sit in service and
[1:17:20] watch what happened in service then
[1:17:22] we'll talk about it after service
[1:17:24] hallelujah so here they come and amen
[1:17:26] and jesus has a prayer line
[1:17:28] glory amen and then elaine began to walk
[1:17:31] the blind began to see
[1:17:33] amen the dumb began to talk people were
[1:17:35] healed and at the end of the service it
[1:17:37] goes to john disciples say
[1:17:39] just go tell john i know y'all got this
[1:17:41] question
[1:17:42] am i here should you look for another he
[1:17:44] didn't even say yes or no to the
[1:17:46] question he said
[1:17:47] go tell john
[1:17:51] hallelujah to the lamb of god go tell
[1:17:54] john the blind see
[1:17:55] the lame walk the dumb here amen i mean
[1:17:58] the deaf hear the dumb speak he said
[1:18:00] just go tell john that why
[1:18:02] because the manifestation
[1:18:05] is the interpretation and the
[1:18:08] vindication
[1:18:10] amen glory to god go tell john what you
[1:18:13] saw
[1:18:13] and john got a peace in his heart on his
[1:18:16] way to dying
[1:18:17] but got a peace in his heart that this
[1:18:19] thing was settled this is the one i just
[1:18:21] introduced
[1:18:22] the messiah now let's go a little
[1:18:24] further here let's go a little further
[1:18:26] amen here the the uh in this statement
[1:18:29] amen is being made it says
[1:18:30] uh uh the the i want to make one more
[1:18:34] comparison between the lattice and
[1:18:35] prophet messenger
[1:18:36] and john the prophet messenger who
[1:18:38] preceded jesus's first coming oh
[1:18:40] the statement that i want to tell you
[1:18:42] there my god
[1:18:44] the scripture actually said that there
[1:18:46] was none greater than john
[1:18:48] there had been none greater than john
[1:18:50] jesus said there had been none greater
[1:18:51] than john
[1:18:52] and brother branham say until that time
[1:18:56] hallelujah i read that for you last week
[1:18:59] yeah there had been none
[1:19:00] greater than john until that time
[1:19:03] now the reason we can say until that
[1:19:05] time is because
[1:19:06] john's ministry even though he never
[1:19:08] worked one miracle in all his life
[1:19:10] john's ministry was to introduce the
[1:19:12] messiah
[1:19:14] hallelujah if he had an elijah
[1:19:16] introduced him at the first coming
[1:19:18] then he's gonna have an elijah introduce
[1:19:20] him at the second coming
[1:19:21] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:19:23] and forever
[1:19:25] so here we get a uh we're getting a
[1:19:26] comparison of these ministries look at
[1:19:28] it now
[1:19:29] he says uh uh i want to make one more
[1:19:32] comparison between the leadership and
[1:19:33] prophet messenger
[1:19:34] and john the prophet messenger i meant
[1:19:36] uh 3 28 2
[1:19:38] says in john the prophet messenger who
[1:19:40] proceeded jesus first coming
[1:19:42] the people in john's day mistook him
[1:19:45] for the messiah oh my they did the same
[1:19:48] thing for the prophet
[1:19:49] it says john 1 uh uh john 1
[1:19:52] 19-20 he says and this is the record of
[1:19:55] john
[1:19:56] when the jews sent priests and levites
[1:19:59] from jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[1:20:02] and he confessed and denied not but
[1:20:04] confess i am not the christ
[1:20:06] now this last day prophet messenger will
[1:20:08] have such
[1:20:09] power before the lord that there will be
[1:20:12] those who will mistake who mistake him
[1:20:14] for the lord jesus
[1:20:15] now brother branham telling us this and
[1:20:17] it's exactly what happened and i told
[1:20:19] you last week brother branham said a
[1:20:20] spirit
[1:20:22] will come into the land and cause people
[1:20:25] to act like this
[1:20:28] oh y'all better y'all better watch this
[1:20:30] i want to say that again
[1:20:32] a spirit will come
[1:20:35] into the land and cause people to act
[1:20:37] like this
[1:20:39] now there are spirits in the land that
[1:20:42] actually say that you don't have to have
[1:20:43] a pastor anymore
[1:20:47] there are spirits in the land that say
[1:20:49] we don't need evangelists anymore
[1:20:52] there are spirits in the land that take
[1:20:54] everything out of the bible
[1:20:57] when it comes to ministry and only
[1:20:59] leaves it at the prophet
[1:21:00] now brother branham never did that
[1:21:04] but you got to recognize the spirit when
[1:21:06] it comes
[1:21:07] if it's against the word then it's
[1:21:09] against the word it don't matter who's
[1:21:11] saying it
[1:21:14] your name don't matter your title don't
[1:21:16] matter amen
[1:21:17] if it's against the word it's against
[1:21:19] the word so watch out for these spirits
[1:21:22] there's a spirit of land that try to
[1:21:24] make brother brandon more than what he
[1:21:25] is brother branham was not
[1:21:27] jesus did not die for our sins
[1:21:31] praise the lord amen didn't rise again
[1:21:36] come on amen that's not that's not who
[1:21:38] he was he was
[1:21:39] a prophet according to scripture and it
[1:21:42] stops right there
[1:21:43] we don't worship brother branham here
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:48] he told us is that when you read the
[1:21:49] bible if you don't see
[1:21:51] christ in every scripture he said go
[1:21:55] back and read it again
[1:21:58] so we worship the lord jesus christ but
[1:22:01] i i'm trying to bring you forth so that
[1:22:03] you don't just get stuck at what
[1:22:04] happened in john the baptist's day
[1:22:07] god been moving ever since then
[1:22:10] all right now now look at this look at
[1:22:12] this it says this
[1:22:14] now this last day prophet messenger will
[1:22:16] have such power before the lord that
[1:22:17] there will be those who mistake him for
[1:22:19] the lord jesus
[1:22:20] and look at it there will be a spirit
[1:22:23] in the world at the end time that will
[1:22:26] seduce some
[1:22:27] and make them believe this
[1:22:31] spirit make people believe that so when
[1:22:33] you see it rise up oh
[1:22:34] oh oh the prophet already warm he said
[1:22:36] the spirit was coming to make people do
[1:22:37] this
[1:22:38] i ain't gonna get caught up in that
[1:22:40] spirit hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:44] all right he says matthew 24 verse 23-26
[1:22:48] it says for there shall arise false
[1:22:50] christs and false prophets
[1:22:52] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:22:54] in so much that
[1:22:55] if it were possible they shall deceive
[1:22:58] the very elect
[1:22:58] i tell you i'm dropping my weight on
[1:23:00] that one i i i am elect i can't be
[1:23:04] deceived
[1:23:06] says behold i have told you before
[1:23:08] wherefore if they shall send
[1:23:09] you behold he is in the desert go not
[1:23:11] forth behold he is in the secret
[1:23:13] chambers believe it not
[1:23:14] it says but don't you believe it he is
[1:23:17] not
[1:23:18] jesus christ now the prophet is saying
[1:23:20] this about himself
[1:23:22] he is not jesus christ he is not the son
[1:23:26] of god
[1:23:26] he is one of the brethren a prophet
[1:23:30] a messenger a servant of god he needs no
[1:23:33] greater honor bestowed upon him
[1:23:35] than that what john received when he was
[1:23:37] the voice that cried
[1:23:39] i am not he but he is coming after me
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] oh i just love it church so here we have
[1:23:48] a man a comparison the life of john the
[1:23:51] baptist who was the first
[1:23:53] uh uh he would be the prophet to the
[1:23:55] first coming of the lord jesus
[1:23:56] and here we have this layer to see a
[1:23:58] messenger which we believe was william
[1:24:00] aaron branham
[1:24:01] he is also considered a man uh
[1:24:04] the the messenger at the second coming
[1:24:06] of the lord jesus
[1:24:08] hallelujah we're not just following
[1:24:09] something crazy
[1:24:11] amen we uh we got we got purpose of what
[1:24:13] we're doing
[1:24:14] this is in the scripture can you point
[1:24:16] your denomination out in the scripture
[1:24:25] if you can't you better come out of her
[1:24:26] my people
[1:24:29] praise the lord amen all right so
[1:24:34] i want to just tell you something god
[1:24:36] always vindicates
[1:24:38] a man his his truth
[1:24:41] god always vindicates and i i want to
[1:24:43] say this i've got
[1:24:44] a couple statements i want to make god
[1:24:46] can speak
[1:24:49] god can write god
[1:24:53] can hear amen god
[1:24:56] can taste god can smell
[1:25:00] praise the lord amen i want to show you
[1:25:03] uh just here
[1:25:04] because uh when god speaks he's actually
[1:25:07] vindicating
[1:25:08] uh one of the statements that that i
[1:25:10] won't ha i won't i don't think i have
[1:25:12] time to read today brother branham said
[1:25:13] the old testament alone two thousand
[1:25:15] times the prophet said thus saith the
[1:25:17] lord so when a prophet is using thus
[1:25:19] saith the lord that is god
[1:25:21] speaking to the prophet and the prophet
[1:25:23] bringing it to the people
[1:25:24] when a prophet says thus says the lord
[1:25:26] it's not his thoughts
[1:25:28] it's actually god's thoughts so you want
[1:25:31] to take heed to what when a prophet uses
[1:25:33] stuff saith the lord
[1:25:34] hallelujah i'm talking about a
[1:25:36] vindicated prophet
[1:25:37] i know we got other people rise up and
[1:25:39] say that they prophets
[1:25:40] and some they give us thus saith the
[1:25:42] lord and the thing never come to pass
[1:25:44] according to scripture you supposedly
[1:25:46] been stoned
[1:25:48] amen you better thank god for grace
[1:25:51] hallelujah but the old testament say 2
[1:25:54] 000 times the prophet said thus saith
[1:25:56] the lord
[1:25:57] that's god speaking amen when it came
[1:26:00] down to adam in the very beginning in
[1:26:03] genesis 3 9
[1:26:04] it says adam adam where art thou
[1:26:07] that was god speaking to adam
[1:26:10] hallelujah sometime you come to church
[1:26:12] and the word to be preached
[1:26:13] is god speaking to you as well amen i
[1:26:16] was also thinking here
[1:26:18] uh um uh how god spoke there in the
[1:26:21] beginning
[1:26:23] let's see here i got something that i
[1:26:24] want to i want to read here in a second
[1:26:26] uh on the back of your page get get the
[1:26:28] looking at the unseen get that ready for
[1:26:30] me
[1:26:31] uh another another place in at the very
[1:26:33] beginning where god himself spoke is
[1:26:36] when he came to king
[1:26:39] and god began to tell cain about an
[1:26:41] offering that he was making
[1:26:43] god began to talk to cain and say now
[1:26:46] you know if you
[1:26:46] offered me the same thing that your
[1:26:48] brother offered me
[1:26:50] i would accept it now i need you to
[1:26:52] understand something
[1:26:54] when god was speaking to king god was
[1:26:57] actually
[1:26:58] vindicating the offering that abel had
[1:27:02] made
[1:27:03] that when god spoke the king it was
[1:27:05] vindicated look
[1:27:06] look abel offered me blood if you would
[1:27:09] give me the same thing that abel gave me
[1:27:11] amen i'm vindicating that i accepted
[1:27:14] what abel would give me
[1:27:17] i'm clearing all suspicion you ain't got
[1:27:21] to try to figure this out
[1:27:26] you ain't gotta wonder what's gonna be
[1:27:28] acceptable
[1:27:31] you ain't got to worry about any of that
[1:27:32] kane i'm
[1:27:34] telling you exactly what i'm going to
[1:27:37] vindicate and accept
[1:27:41] but because he's serpentine he can't
[1:27:43] even accept vindication
[1:27:47] brother when vindication happened it
[1:27:50] settles everything
[1:27:53] i'm telling you ain't got no more
[1:27:54] questions i ain't got nothing to figure
[1:27:56] out
[1:27:56] when vindication occurs
[1:28:01] and i'm telling you when i'm when your
[1:28:03] brother just gave me this
[1:28:05] all you got to do is offer a sick go get
[1:28:07] another lamb and bring it here
[1:28:09] don't bring me no fruit from the ground
[1:28:11] i'm not taking that
[1:28:13] but but can't get mad he said he and
[1:28:15] then didn't even god told him he said
[1:28:17] now look
[1:28:18] if you don't want to give me this
[1:28:19] offering sin lies at the door
[1:28:26] sin is lying at your door no not now
[1:28:29] ain't that something that's that's
[1:28:30] that that's that's discernment i'm
[1:28:33] telling you what's already in your heart
[1:28:34] kane
[1:28:36] sin is lying at your door and maybe he's
[1:28:39] trying to figure out what is he telling
[1:28:40] me i don't know
[1:28:41] i know what i'm telling you and that god
[1:28:43] could have stopped what was getting
[1:28:44] ready to happen
[1:28:45] but he allowed it to happen the sin
[1:28:48] never lying at his door
[1:28:49] that cain said you know god won't take
[1:28:51] my uh god won't take my offering
[1:28:55] he told you what he gonna take and he
[1:28:58] still got upset god ain't gonna take my
[1:29:00] offer well i tell you what
[1:29:01] he gonna take my offering because abel
[1:29:03] ain't gonna be here to offer nothing
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:09] and he went and slayed his brother and
[1:29:11] then god began to talk again
[1:29:16] but i'm let me say let me save that
[1:29:17] point oh jesus
[1:29:20] god begin to talk again hallelujah
[1:29:24] and this is where this is where uh um
[1:29:27] you know when oh let me just let me save
[1:29:29] that i want i want to just uh
[1:29:30] drop a little quote in here just for a
[1:29:32] second because i want to compare brother
[1:29:34] branham's ministry how god talked
[1:29:35] to vindicate his ministry as well god

[1:31:07] the grave
[1:31:09] i am the one that sent the holy ghost i
[1:31:12] am the one that give the promise
[1:31:14] brother branham has nothing to do in
[1:31:17] this
[1:31:19] he surrendered his life to me i'm using
[1:31:22] his spirit
[1:31:23] i'm talking through his lips that's me
[1:31:27] i'm the lord come down come down come
[1:31:30] down and it goes right back to him
[1:31:32] having an altar call
[1:31:34] god was speaking vindicating his prophet
[1:31:37] borrowing his lips borrowing his life
[1:31:40] but it was all god in the midst of it
[1:31:43] that's
[1:31:44] why we worship god
[1:31:49] look here i ain't got to vindicate the
[1:31:51] message it's
[1:31:52] already been vindicated god himself
[1:31:55] has vindicated this truth
[1:32:16] moses went up into the mountain y'all
[1:32:19] gonna let me preach just for a little
[1:32:20] bit
[1:32:24] god can write i'm talking about god can
[1:32:27] write
[1:32:28] yes moses went up into a mountain for 40
[1:32:31] days and god gave him
[1:32:32] the stones god don't use paper
[1:32:36] stones hallelujah hill right
[1:32:39] on your stony heart
[1:32:43] glory to god remove that stony heart but
[1:32:46] he gave him stones he just began to
[1:32:47] write the ten
[1:32:48] amen the ten commandments on these
[1:32:50] stones written by the thing of god
[1:32:54] moses come from out of this experience i
[1:32:56] mean just
[1:32:57] wow 40 days like this and and i just got
[1:33:01] stones
[1:33:02] that were written by the thing of god
[1:33:03] you would have thought
[1:33:05] that once the children of israel saw
[1:33:07] these stones they would have stopped
[1:33:08] doing what they was doing
[1:33:10] but here moses come down with stones
[1:33:12] vindicated
[1:33:13] vindicated writing from almighty god and
[1:33:16] the people are
[1:33:17] wrapped up in sin
[1:33:22] god so are so bad that you know uh
[1:33:25] moses let me just oh this devil he's a
[1:33:28] liar
[1:33:29] amen amen
[1:33:35] moses got so upset watching what the
[1:33:37] people's doing these
[1:33:38] same vindicated stones that he had in
[1:33:40] his hand
[1:33:41] he actually throws them down
[1:33:44] breaks the vindicated stones you want to
[1:33:47] know why because he had a temper problem
[1:33:52] and actually that's what some of our
[1:33:53] issues are we got a temple problem
[1:33:56] brother branham saying your bad temper
[1:33:58] is what's going to produce that cancer
[1:33:59] in your body
[1:34:01] it's what it will bring sickness on you
[1:34:03] your temper does it
[1:34:06] the doctor can't find amen what the
[1:34:09] cause is
[1:34:10] but a prophet tells us your temper
[1:34:12] brought that on you
[1:34:15] that's why you can't let the devil give
[1:34:16] you no temper
[1:34:20] and you know temple only happens when we
[1:34:22] talking to our spouses
[1:34:26] it's the truth and how when you get
[1:34:28] around the saints you all
[1:34:30] god bless you praise the lord god can
[1:34:33] see through that
[1:34:35] if you want to practice controlling your
[1:34:37] temper stop saying what you saying in
[1:34:39] the house
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:42] come on somebody oh you got it down when
[1:34:44] you come to church
[1:34:46] you got it down when you go to your job
[1:34:48] you got it down when you're talking to
[1:34:50] your customers
[1:34:51] you don't let that side come out but god
[1:34:54] can see that
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:59] your best place to overcome is at home
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:06] all right church praise the lord
[1:35:10] see we take each other for granted too
[1:35:11] much
[1:35:13] that's why we do that we just take one
[1:35:14] another for granted brother branham say
[1:35:16] remember that
[1:35:17] is that's that's that's that's she's the
[1:35:19] daughter of a king
[1:35:22] sister remember he's the son of a king
[1:35:25] that's that's god son and god's daughter
[1:35:27] that you're handling like that
[1:35:31] can i put it this way that's not your
[1:35:32] personal property
[1:35:34] it's god
[1:35:38] let me just drop this in i'm here now i
[1:35:40] might as well drop it in
[1:35:42] the brother uh one time shared a dream
[1:35:45] that he had
[1:35:47] and in the dream uh you know his wife
[1:35:49] wasn't saved and he was he was a
[1:35:51] christian and
[1:35:52] he was always trying to get her to do
[1:35:53] certain things and you know the lady won
[1:35:55] saved that's why she wasn't doing it
[1:35:58] praise the lord
[1:35:59] so he was just getting frustrated right
[1:36:01] and uh so one day he had a dream and in
[1:36:03] the dream he saw this sword
[1:36:05] come down in the dream he said the sword
[1:36:07] went at his wife and
[1:36:09] just began to cut this and cut that and
[1:36:11] cut this and cut that
[1:36:13] and then he said when he saw what the
[1:36:15] sword was doing he got so excited he
[1:36:16] reached up and grabbed the sword
[1:36:18] and he started helping the sword cut
[1:36:20] this and cut that
[1:36:21] and when he grabbed a hold of the sword
[1:36:23] he got pushed
[1:36:27] then he heard a voice god can speak
[1:36:31] heard a voice say that's my job
[1:36:37] it ain't your job to do the cutting it's
[1:36:40] my job
[1:36:41] and the sword represents the word of god
[1:36:43] as she reads the word she'll come in
[1:36:45] line with the word but that's
[1:36:46] my job not yours
[1:36:50] when you try to use it you make a mess
[1:36:54] you actually end up cutting the wrong
[1:36:55] parts

[1:39:28] wall
[1:39:32] can i read a quote here out of questions
[1:39:33] and answers
[1:39:35] uh part four because some of y'all
[1:39:37] message believers already know where i'm
[1:39:39] at
[1:39:41] but let me just give you one because you
[1:39:42] might not know this one so let me let me
[1:39:44] just give you this one
[1:39:48] it was asking a question the other day
[1:39:52] we know why you first went to arizona
[1:39:54] was them angels appeared
[1:39:57] why did you return the second time you
[1:40:00] remember that question read
[1:40:01] it says how many remembers when i come
[1:40:03] back after uh out come back after that
[1:40:05] was was sitting there before
[1:40:07] dr level i believe he's in the building
[1:40:09] somewhere my wife
[1:40:10] and i was talking about arizona and
[1:40:12] about us staying here
[1:40:14] in jeffersonville and there come a hand
[1:40:17] on the wall
[1:40:19] and light and wrote with lettuce return
[1:40:23] back to arizona
[1:40:25] so the people asking why you come back
[1:40:26] the second time let me ask you a
[1:40:28] question
[1:40:29] if god wrote
[1:40:36] if god happened to write on your wall
[1:40:42] come back to arizona if god rolled on my
[1:40:45] wall i'd be
[1:40:46] first thing out of here going to arizona
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:52] i would stop to answer no questions
[1:40:55] because i just heard not just heard from
[1:40:57] god i saw god
[1:40:59] right on my wall
[1:41:05] how many remembers that that's why i'm
[1:41:06] back there that's why i'm back in
[1:41:08] arizona god wrote on the wall come on
[1:41:10] back to arizona
[1:41:11] so that's why i'm here amen it says not
[1:41:14] knowing why i went back and when i got
[1:41:15] there
[1:41:16] didn't reveal what i should go back for
[1:41:18] and if i tell it then satan would block
[1:41:20] it
[1:41:25] sometimes you can't tell everything keep
[1:41:27] some stuff to yourself
[1:41:30] but that's how the devil get involved in
[1:41:31] it right it says if i tell it then satan
[1:41:34] would block it but he don't know my
[1:41:36] heart
[1:41:36] he he's not the word
[1:41:39] so he doesn't know my heart but if i
[1:41:41] speak it then he hears it see
[1:41:43] so now remember that so now here we got
[1:41:46] god writing to the prophet he said
[1:41:48] brother level was there his wife was
[1:41:50] there all these people witnesses

[1:44:40] jason watkins i've just happened
[1:44:41] this week you know i i was telling y'all
[1:44:44] last week the lord wanted me to go a
[1:44:45] particular
[1:44:45] direction last week and god blessed it
[1:44:48] and
[1:44:48] um uh i'm glad that i waited because i
[1:44:51] was listening to something brother jason
[1:44:52] watkins said he he grew up in the
[1:44:54] tabernacle went there for a number of
[1:44:56] years
[1:44:57] and he said when this happened when the
[1:44:58] angel lord actually drew the seven
[1:45:00] church ages
[1:45:01] on the wall this this this very thing
[1:45:03] that we're teaching right here we teach
[1:45:04] it in sunday school
[1:45:06] and i'm i'm not just teaching a man some
[1:45:10] some somebody got some sunday school
[1:45:11] lesson together i'm teaching something
[1:45:13] that's already been vindicated
[1:45:16] hear the angel lord come and write
[1:45:18] everything that you see on this chart
[1:45:20] brother branham wrote in was teaching to
[1:45:21] the people
[1:45:22] but then the angel lord after he
[1:45:24] finished preaching goes to the back of
[1:45:25] the wall 11 o'clock in the day and
[1:45:27] writes on the wall
[1:45:28] now you know after after that happened
[1:45:30] people said
[1:45:32] it was some of the lights from
[1:45:34] somebody's car
[1:45:36] that flashed on the wall
[1:45:39] 11 o'clock in the day you telling me
[1:45:42] somebody
[1:45:43] light splashed in the car on the wall
[1:45:45] and well if they
[1:45:47] you took now i'm gonna tell you take
[1:45:48] more faith to believe that somebody's
[1:45:51] call lights
[1:45:54] could actually throw out his chart it
[1:45:57] takes more faith to believe that
[1:45:59] i i'm good enough with the age of the
[1:46:01] lord
[1:46:02] wrote it out on the wall
[1:46:08] this uh brother that was sitting there
[1:46:09] in the church that day
[1:46:12] it says uh when it happened you know
[1:46:14] everybody's screaming
[1:46:15] and and and john he said but i was there
[1:46:17] he said but brother branham made a
[1:46:19] statement it's not here on this
[1:46:20] in this quote i'll finish reading this
[1:46:21] in a second it says uh
[1:46:23] he said brother brandon made a statement
[1:46:24] he says uh actually i know y'all see
[1:46:27] that on the wall
[1:46:28] but if you want to know where he is he's
[1:46:31] here with me
[1:46:33] he's here with me where i'm teaching
[1:46:35] this
[1:46:37] and they say and what he did was just
[1:46:39] project it
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:46] he said all he did was just project it
[1:46:48] on the wall for you
[1:46:50] but i got it here and wait if you wanna
[1:46:52] if you wanna know where christ is
[1:46:53] he's here standing right by my side
[1:46:56] while i'm teaching this god vindicating
[1:46:59] it by projecting it
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:06] i'm sitting here reading the quote from
[1:47:08] my ipad
[1:47:10] but the sisters in the back actually
[1:47:12] projected where's god
[1:47:13] god is up here
[1:47:22] not on the projector amen that's just to
[1:47:25] vindicate
[1:47:26] what is being spoken to you come on
[1:47:34] church
[1:47:48] oh
[1:47:50] 11 o'clock in the day standing right
[1:47:51] down the wall and draw it off off those
[1:47:53] church ages just
[1:47:54] with which uh just which just which much
[1:47:58] spirit
[1:47:59] uh and then the darkness to show that
[1:48:01] the spirit was smothered out and went
[1:48:03] through the dark age
[1:48:04] and come right back down again i want to
[1:48:06] say that i want to say that
[1:48:08] because some of y'all in your life
[1:48:10] you've gone through dark ages
[1:48:12] but you know the spirit could not keep
[1:48:15] amen i mean the
[1:48:16] the the darkness or the depths of satan
[1:48:18] could not keep
[1:48:19] the saints from coming out the dark ages
[1:48:26] you had your own personal dark age but
[1:48:28] you can't stay in the dark age you got
[1:48:29] to come out
[1:48:31] if you go read revelation 2 you'll see
[1:48:34] the whole depth of satan was all
[1:48:36] through the revelation 2. amen uh what
[1:48:38] was starting ephesus and then
[1:48:40] went to smyrna and pergamos and then
[1:48:42] thigh tear that dominating female
[1:48:44] it reached its full potential the depths
[1:48:47] of satan was there
[1:48:49] and that and also that thing of thy tear
[1:48:51] it was a thousand
[1:48:52] years of dark ages seemed like nothing
[1:48:55] was happening
[1:48:55] say but god began to give a confidence
[1:48:58] god began to give an anointing in that
[1:49:00] age that the saints began to rise up
[1:49:01] they rose up so much
[1:49:03] that luther got a hold of that anointing
[1:49:07] and that's when things began to change
[1:49:08] because revelation 3 it starts talking
[1:49:10] about
[1:49:11] luther's day luther wesley and then to
[1:49:14] get all the way down here to our day but
[1:49:16] here we reach the
[1:49:17] end just like third tier was the end of
[1:49:20] the first three ages
[1:49:21] hallelujah we're not leons we have
[1:49:24] reached the end
[1:49:25] of laodicea where are we we are the
[1:49:28] prize
[1:49:31] hallelujah somebody amen amen amen we're
[1:49:36] here we're here
[1:49:37] i want to just i want to say this they
[1:49:39] went through the dark age and come right
[1:49:40] back down again just the way
[1:49:42] i had it draw and we got it pictures of
[1:49:44] it and everything drawn hanging on the
[1:49:45] wall
[1:49:46] and there it was just exactly it must
[1:49:48] have been that spirit of the lord
[1:49:51] it must have been the spirit of the lord
[1:49:56] was satisfied that's why i was
[1:49:59] vindicated
[1:50:00] because the spirit of the lord was
[1:50:03] satisfied
[1:50:04] that that was completed because he come
[1:50:06] back and vindicated
[1:50:09] that that was right so when we're
[1:50:12] studying the church ages we're studying
[1:50:13] something that's vindicated
[1:50:15] amen this is not somebody's
[1:50:16] interpretation of somebody's
[1:50:18] you know uh just thoughts but this is
[1:50:20] vindicated truth that god has given us
[1:50:23] can i go a little further god can hear
[1:50:27] amen i told you you know when when
[1:50:30] when uh god spoke to cain say cain now
[1:50:34] look if you just give me
[1:50:36] what your brother gave me i'll be
[1:50:38] satisfied with that
[1:50:39] god vindicated what when god spoke he
[1:50:42] was vindicating the offering that came
[1:50:44] i mean that able offer so he said i i'll
[1:50:46] be satisfied
[1:50:48] i can't say um
[1:50:52] i got a way of fixing this problem i'm
[1:50:55] gonna get rid of abel
[1:50:56] and then god got only one church that he
[1:50:58] can come to
[1:51:01] we're gonna force god to come to his
[1:51:03] church and accept his offer my lord
[1:51:06] so here he goes and god told him saying
[1:51:09] i send life at the door
[1:51:10] god already knew what he was getting
[1:51:11] ready to do send life at the door and
[1:51:13] like i said he could have stopped it but
[1:51:14] he didn't he just let it go right on
[1:51:15] right play right on out
[1:51:17] so here uh uh kane gets up and he rides
[1:51:19] up and he kills his brother because of
[1:51:21] his offering
[1:51:24] i want y'all to get that some folk will
[1:51:27] kill the influence of this church
[1:51:29] because of what because of the fruit
[1:51:32] that's been produced from it
[1:51:35] i'ma say something
[1:51:39] people never throw rocks
[1:51:43] in bottles and sticks
[1:51:46] at trees that don't have fruit
[1:51:55] so if you're getting hit by a rock a
[1:51:57] bottle a sticker whatever somebody
[1:51:59] picked up
[1:52:00] it's because you got fruit in your life
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:06] hallelujah folk love to try to bring up
[1:52:09] your past
[1:52:11] that person died i can't live there no
[1:52:16] he don't live there no more don't live
[1:52:18] here no more don't let folk bring up
[1:52:20] your past
[1:52:21] amen go forward in your future
[1:52:26] praise god so god can hear so here you
[1:52:30] know he
[1:52:30] he's talking to kane and and uh and kane
[1:52:33] decides i'm gonna kill my brother i'm
[1:52:34] gonna kill him i'm gonna make god come
[1:52:35] to my church and accept my offering
[1:52:37] so then um kane kills him and
[1:52:40] god comes down again and he asks king
[1:52:44] he's talking again because god can talk
[1:52:46] it's like cain
[1:52:47] um where's your brother abel
[1:52:50] i don't know am i am i my brother's
[1:52:52] keeper

[1:53:17] exactly what you did to abel
[1:53:19] and i hear his blood crying out from the
[1:53:22] ground
[1:53:23] i told you sin was lying at the door
[1:53:26] this murdering murder and spirit that
[1:53:28] you got came from your daddy
[1:53:31] amen
[1:53:38] god can hear because elisha is telling
[1:53:41] the king of
[1:53:42] israel secrets that the king of syria
[1:53:46] had in his bed chamber and
[1:53:47] the king was ready to kill everybody
[1:53:49] where despised that they said no no they
[1:53:51] got a prophet
[1:53:52] over in the land and he's telling them
[1:53:54] the secrets that you talk about in your
[1:53:56] bed team
[1:53:57] who was telling the prophet
[1:54:00] god can hear
[1:54:04] can i tell you something else god hear
[1:54:05] what you're talking about when you leave
[1:54:06] here
[1:54:10] oh my goodness we had a prophet in the
[1:54:14] land that told us
[1:54:15] uh the reason that them 42
[1:54:18] bears killed them kids
[1:54:22] right them bears kill them kids he said
[1:54:24] because what the children what the
[1:54:26] parents were talking about
[1:54:28] hallelujah amen in their house the
[1:54:32] parents were talking about the prophet
[1:54:34] the parents were desperate disrespecting
[1:54:37] the prophet
[1:54:38] they didn't they didn't disrespect him
[1:54:40] in person but when they got home the
[1:54:42] things that they were saying about the
[1:54:44] prophet
[1:54:44] caused their kids to grow up with a
[1:54:48] disrespect
[1:54:51] so some of the manifestation that we see
[1:54:53] in your children
[1:54:58] is because of what you were saying when
[1:55:00] nobody was around when you thought
[1:55:01] nobody was around
[1:55:06] god can hear god can taste
[1:55:13] he went down there to abraham's house
[1:55:17] praise the lord
[1:55:19] and abraham said uh uh sarah get this
[1:55:22] together and get that together we got
[1:55:24] three visitors here
[1:55:25] and abraham called them my lord and when
[1:55:28] he came he showed up
[1:55:29] he got some some uh some some some meal
[1:55:32] together
[1:55:33] and he also got a calf get it get a calf
[1:55:35] real quick and dress it
[1:55:37] so i want to tell you god ate meat
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:54] he ate calf god
[1:55:58] god can taste
[1:56:02] and he also told him in revelation 3 16
[1:56:05] i wish you were cold or hot
[1:56:09] just lukewarmness i'm going to spew out
[1:56:13] my mouth
[1:56:14] so either live for god or don't live for
[1:56:16] god but don't be in the middle with this
[1:56:18] thing
[1:56:19] because god can taste
[1:56:25] god can smell
[1:56:28] genesis 8 verse 20 through 22. i'm
[1:56:30] coming home
[1:56:31] i'm coming home uh noah offered god
[1:56:35] a sacrifice after the flood and this
[1:56:38] sacrifice
[1:56:39] please god here in genesis 8 verse 20
[1:56:43] says
[1:56:43] and noah building an alt unto god unto
[1:56:45] the lord
[1:56:46] and took of every clean beast and of
[1:56:48] every clean file and offered burnt
[1:56:50] offerings on the altar
[1:56:51] and the lord smelled a sweet savor
[1:56:56] amen there in in genesis 8 21 and the
[1:56:59] lord smelled
[1:57:00] a sweet savor and the lord said in his
[1:57:03] heart
[1:57:04] i will not again curse the ground
[1:57:06] anymore for man's sake
[1:57:07] for the imagination of man's heart is
[1:57:10] evil from his youth
[1:57:11] neither will i against might anymore
[1:57:13] everything
[1:57:14] living as i have done while the earth
[1:57:17] remaineth seedtime and harvest
[1:57:19] and cold and heat and summer and winter
[1:57:21] and day and night
[1:57:23] shall not cease so verse 21 told us that
[1:57:25] the lord smelled god can smell
[1:57:28] the lord smelled a sweet savor
[1:57:31] i want you to see another one ephesians
[1:57:33] 5 and 2.
[1:57:36] glory to god amen
[1:57:40] ephesians 5 and 2 let's just read that
[1:57:42] really really quick ephesians 5 and 2.
[1:57:45] there's another uh sweet savor that god
[1:57:50] smelled and he was very pleased with
[1:57:54] amen here in ephesians 5
[1:57:58] um says and we and and walk in love
[1:58:03] as christ also have loved us
[1:58:07] and have given himself for us an
[1:58:09] offering
[1:58:10] and a sacrifice to god for a sweet
[1:58:13] smelling
[1:58:14] savor so the sacrifice that christ
[1:58:17] brought
[1:58:18] on the cross god could smell and it
[1:58:21] please god
[1:58:23] hallelujah how we thank god for this
[1:58:26] now i want to just mention a few things
[1:58:28] here i read to you early that
[1:58:31] the the prophet said amen and pick up
[1:58:34] your pen and write what he wrote down
[1:58:35] said god will vindicate
[1:58:38] this ministry of malachi for this
[1:58:40] ministry revelation 10
[1:58:41] 7. both of those scriptures pertain to
[1:58:44] brother branham's ministry
[1:58:46] amen um oh
[1:58:49] my my my my i love the fact
[1:58:54] as we read the scripture how jesus came
[1:58:57] to john
[1:58:58] while he was in the water and when jesus
[1:59:02] came to john while he was in the water
[1:59:05] jesus was vindicating
[1:59:09] john's ministry by john having the
[1:59:11] ability
[1:59:12] amen to not only just baptize jesus but
[1:59:15] see the spirit
[1:59:16] descending and abide on jesus
[1:59:20] john had the ability to identify and
[1:59:22] vindicate
[1:59:23] who jesus was the son of god i told
[1:59:26] y'all there was one standing amongst us
[1:59:28] whose shoes i'm not worthy to even lose
[1:59:31] this
[1:59:31] is the one that i was telling about
[1:59:33] notice where it happened
[1:59:35] in the water you already know
[1:59:39] because in 1933
[1:59:42] brother branham was standing in the ohio
[1:59:45] river
[1:59:46] hallelujah baptizing people in the name
[1:59:49] of the lord jesus christ
[1:59:50] and when he got to the 17th person here
[1:59:53] comes the lord jesus down himself
[1:59:55] in a pillar of a fire and he spoke he
[1:59:58] says
[1:59:59] as john the baptist was sent before run
[2:00:02] my first coming
[2:00:03] your ministry your message will forf
[2:00:07] forerun my second coming here in in the
[2:00:09] water
[2:00:10] while baptizing the same way jesus did
[2:00:13] it for john the baptist
[2:00:14] is the same way he did it for his
[2:00:16] prophet that's
[2:00:17] that's representing the second coming of
[2:00:19] his amen the second coming of the lord
[2:00:21] the same way
[2:00:22] in the water it was vindicated
[2:00:26] amen they got articles all over the
[2:00:28] place
[2:00:29] saying mystic light follows this
[2:00:31] minister praise the lord
[2:00:34] when you're baptizing is there a mystic
[2:00:35] like following you
[2:00:37] see we talk about what god did even at
[2:00:40] his birth
[2:00:41] when uh when uh when uh the spirit lord
[2:00:43] came into the room and i think a dove or
[2:00:46] something like that flew into the room
[2:00:47] it was god vindicating his ministry
[2:00:51] glory to god can i give you another one
[2:00:53] one time
[2:00:55] hallelujah like elijah had to stand
[2:00:57] against him 450 prophets of baal

[2:03:57] they never showed up
[2:04:02] i already told you the prophet was
[2:04:03] vindicated when he preached the seven
[2:04:05] church ages
[2:04:06] angel lord drew the same thing on the
[2:04:09] back wall
[2:04:10] that was god vindicating this prophet
[2:04:13] uh before brother branham preached the
[2:04:15] the seven seals
[2:04:17] another vindication he went up into the
[2:04:19] mountain by a dream
[2:04:20] and while he's up there in the mountain
[2:04:22] amen he was just up praying
[2:04:24] praise god and while he praying a sword
[2:04:27] struck his hand
[2:04:30] and he says oh a a sword brother adam
[2:04:33] said he said i've always been afraid of
[2:04:34] saying
[2:04:34] and he's hearing a voice because god can
[2:04:36] speak
[2:04:38] it say not a sword but the sword
[2:04:41] the king sword he said it's the king so
[2:04:44] he said oh

[2:04:58] vindicated praise the lord so here he's
[2:05:00] get the sword and before he preaches the
[2:05:03] seven seals so god god showed him and
[2:05:05] that when he had the sword
[2:05:06] the king sword he knew was the word of
[2:05:09] god
[2:05:09] he the prophet was carrying the word to
[2:05:12] the people
[2:05:16] god vindicated him
[2:05:21] also while he was there a man
[2:05:24] um preparing to preach the seals
[2:05:28] seven angels came out of eternity and
[2:05:31] uh made a picture a cloud in the sky
[2:05:34] life magazine packed a picture praise
[2:05:38] god

[2:05:52] the picture
[2:05:55] turn it to the right say you'll see
[2:05:58] christ

[2:06:01] picture to the right that's exactly what
[2:06:03] we saw
[2:06:05] we were supposed to see christ not the
[2:06:07] prophet

[2:10:33] appeared
[2:10:35] i'm not the one that performs these
[2:10:37] things and foretells these things that
[2:10:39] happens as perfect as they are
[2:10:41] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[2:10:45] i was only a voice that he used to say
[2:10:48] it
[2:10:49] it wasn't what i knew it's what i just
[2:10:53] surrendered myself to
[2:10:55] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[2:10:58] wasn't the seventh angel oh no
[2:11:00] it was the manifestation of the son of
[2:11:03] man it wasn't the angel his message
[2:11:06] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[2:11:09] it's not a man it's
[2:11:10] god the angel was not the son of man he
[2:11:14] was the messenger from
[2:11:15] the son of man the son of man
[2:11:18] is christ he is the one that you're
[2:11:22] feeding on
[2:11:23] you're not feeding on a man so when i
[2:11:25] come up and i say brother branham said
[2:11:27] brother branham said you're not
[2:11:28] feeding on a man
[2:11:33] his words will fail but you're feeding
[2:11:36] on the unfailing
[2:11:38] body word of the son of man
[2:11:41] if you haven't fed fully on every word
[2:11:44] to give yourself strength to fly above
[2:11:45] all these denominations and things of
[2:11:47] the world
[2:11:48] will you at this time do it while we
[2:11:50] pray
[2:11:51] now this last thing to prove
[2:11:55] that god vindicated the prophet
[2:12:03] let me read this scripture first
[2:12:04] corinthians 9 2.
[2:12:08] first corinthians 9 2. this last thing i
[2:12:10] want to say it right just like this
[2:12:15] paul said this if i be not
[2:12:19] an apostle unto others
[2:12:24] everybody ain't gonna accept me if i be
[2:12:27] not an apostle
[2:12:28] unto others yet doubtless
[2:12:32] doubtless you can't doubt it all the
[2:12:35] questions
[2:12:36] have been settled the truths have been
[2:12:39] vindicated he says yet
[2:12:40] doubtless i am to you
[2:12:44] he goes on to say this for the seal of
[2:12:46] my apostleship
[2:12:48] are ye in the lord and i want to say it
[2:12:52] just like this
[2:12:54] because your heart has been turned back
[2:12:56] to the word
[2:12:59] the message has been vindicated
[2:13:04] [Applause]
[2:13:11] amen let's pray
[2:13:21] lord
[2:13:27] we worship you in spirit and we worship
[2:13:29] you in truth
[2:13:32] vindicated truths
[2:13:39] how you've just been bringing us on this
[2:13:40] journey and lord we can just
[2:13:42] see your mighty mighty hand
[2:13:47] scriptures being fulfilled in the days
[2:13:49] of john
[2:13:51] scriptures being fulfilled in the days
[2:13:53] of jesus the first coming of the lord
[2:13:55] scripture is also being fulfilled
[2:13:58] in this day and this at the second
[2:13:59] coming of the lord we see it
[2:14:01] you have vindicated it
[2:14:04] you have proven it we can't leave hear
[2:14:08] god and
[2:14:10] and doubt it all we can do is leave here
[2:14:14] and live it
[2:14:18] god you are you're doing something in
[2:14:20] our midst
[2:14:21] and i'm grateful for what i see you
[2:14:23] doing i realize this
[2:14:24] is not the work of a man but this is a
[2:14:26] work of the holy ghost
[2:14:31] got my prayers that you would complete
[2:14:33] the work that you have started
[2:14:36] that you would get the glory and the
[2:14:38] honor
[2:14:41] lord from um
[2:14:45] from all that is going on here we want
[2:14:46] you to have the preeminence
[2:14:49] we want you to show us all how much you
[2:14:51] love us god you did so much at the cross
[2:14:53] but god you still continue to woo us
[2:14:56] you still continue to talk to us and you
[2:14:59] are the lamb of god that comes to take
[2:15:01] away
[2:15:02] the sins of the world
[2:15:07] you keep calling us out of sin calling
[2:15:09] us out of darkness
[2:15:10] and satan has tried to take many of us
[2:15:12] in and place us
[2:15:14] in a place of darkness where we just
[2:15:15] couldn't see any hope at all
[2:15:18] but he couldn't keep us there there was
[2:15:19] something in us even when we cried
[2:15:22] out for wrong even when we did wrong
[2:15:23] there was still something in us that
[2:15:25] knew
[2:15:27] that you called for us to do more
[2:15:31] so god i don't believe you'll be
[2:15:32] satisfied
[2:15:34] until more is actually given to you
[2:15:44] i want to take this moment while our
[2:15:45] heads about and our eyes are closed
[2:15:50] i am not going to take these services
[2:15:52] for granted

[2:15:57] day when we will not be able to gather
[2:16:00] here in this church
[2:16:03] because we preach truth these doors will
[2:16:06] be locked
