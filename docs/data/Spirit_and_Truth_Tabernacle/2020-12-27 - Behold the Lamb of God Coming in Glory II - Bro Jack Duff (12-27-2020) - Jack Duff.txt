to me going through a man this um this year and you know and you know um even in um um having to deal with you know testing positive for uh covey that was not my death sentence all right and and we need to know that the devil can't do no more than what god allows him i was i was i was uh listening to a brother brother eugene braun he was speaking this week and he made a statement he says you know god actually controls both sides of the equation i just want you to know that he said now it was god that had a promise in scripture to say i'm going to raise up a deliverer for my people in egypt and i'm going to send moses god himself was sending moses into egypt god gave him supernatural signs that he could use when he went down there to egypt but because he works on both sides of the equation god also told moses i will heart in the heart i'm gonna harden the heart of pharaoh he can't do this on his own i got to do something for him to make him do what he do so i'm gonna harden his heart and i'm also gonna send you i got both sides of the equation all i'm trying to let you know is that all things gonna work together for goods [Music] it's going to work together for good it may not feel good but it will work together for good hallelujah when you just when you just relax and just let god be god all right amen i'll tell you that the devil can go no further than god allows amen amen i praise god all right all right so uh that was free i just want you know god working on both sides of the equation both sides all right um uh the other thing i meant i mentioned to y'all after that powerful service that we had i say now the devil don't like this and the devil gonna attack i told the church i told them before the attack even came but i also said we're going to have a victory and do you know that you know the devil went right after the the shepherd why does he go after the shepherd because the sheep will praise the lord right but the devil lost [Applause] we on the winning side we're not going to be defeated these brothers picked up the ball and just kept going i said praise god advancing the church so we we thank god for all things amen god is god is in control church and he brought us through 2020 and as the the lord terry we're looking forward to come through 2021 as well amen all right all right so i want to just read a scripture here from the book of john amen chapter uh three we'll just read verse 26 through 30. um the bible says um and they came unto john i said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bears witness now we we we we're not reading this again today but we for the last few uh sermons that preach on uh vendor uh vindicated truth we talked about how when jesus came to john in the water to be baptized in him jesus was actually vindicating john's ministry by coming to john uh they had questions for john as to who he was and by jesus coming to john it vindicated john's ministry but by also that that act occurring uh john was vindicating who jesus was okay and uh so here you know these people they called it they were there at church they saw what happened they saw saw jesus come to john and came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizer and all men come to him that means ain't nobody coming to your church nobody coming to your church no more john your ministry is dried up praise the lord and and he done stole the members praise the lord see this is what this is what they're trying to create a problem but watch john watch john jonas and said a man can't a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven you yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am set before him i told you all that and then and then then i love this he that hath the bride is the bridegroom so it the one that's that got the bride that that's the bridegroom it says but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled [Music] john goes on to say this he he he he he praise god not me me me me me but he he he must increase but i must hey glory to god it's it's it's got to happen i must decrease so that christ can increase all right let's i think i already prayed over the word so you can be seated amen in the house of the lord we are staying with our thought on behold the lamb of god coming in glory amen um we started this on last week and and you know i was telling you all how uh the lord used uh brother troy uh let me just get some things set here praise the lord the lord use brother troy on the wednesday night while my first service back from quarantine i came to church on a wednesday night yes i did amen i was happy to be in the house of god get tired of being at home i want to go to church amen i mean other folk out there desire to go to parties and and all kind of stuff but i i just got a different desire i want to go to church i enjoy seeing the saints of god in the house of god uh brother troy had took a thought on behold the bridegroom cometh and uh i was just like blessed because he was you know talking about um rebecca you know there in genesis 24 and then the lord took me uh back a little ways because uh right before i went to quarantine um i think the i can't remember what happened but i know brother quake who came and he spoke on the land of beulah praise the lord and uh he told us that beulah meant ownership married and claimed as a wife right so the holy spirit just picking up this thought and uh and brought us you know break i mean they didn't realize it but they had stepped into the vision their sermon stepped right into the vision of what you know the lord was uh was dealing with me about because i knew that this would be my last sermon uh you know on this uh on this on this topic of uh stepping to the vision we've been using uh this these just paragraph by paragraph uh through the the vision that the the angel lord told the prophet pick up your pen and write and uh we just that's that's that's carried us through 2020. amen and i believe it's going to carry us forward but uh but this is just you know we come to the end of this i'm in the last paragraph of this on the last sunday of the year god knows how to do things amen so i trust that we will uh we'll just kind of catch this amen on today and i want to just um pick up kind of where we left off last week we were reading from the sermon the spoken word is the original seed and uh this is where the angel lord is actually telling the prophet pick up his pen and write but this is the last few paragraphs of of this this message that he had for the bride this message is for the bride everybody else is not going to catch it it's not going to mean anything to anybody else praise the lord when you're when you're a a husband a man and a wife that's united and in love with one another a man that that woman would look forward to getting letters from her husband praise god right the man should also look forward to getting letters from his wife amen if they're really in love with each other they can't they can't wait to get them letters back in the day where people used to have to write letters to communicate amen that that's how they that's how they caught it is through letters it meant everything to them amen do you realize the lord jesus has been courting us through letters through the word of god through what the prophet said it's been god himself according with his pride hey man i i mentioned in the last week and i'll say it again brother branham's ministry was just like eliezer eliza had to go get a bride for isaac amen so brother brandon's ministry was only to bring a bride to isaac to jesus christ because he is the real isaac bless it be the name of the lord so we're all represented in genesis 24. you are represented in genesis even you have a ministry in genesis 24. your ministry is to water the word of god with an amen because eliezer prayed the woman that will water the woman the church the blood that will water the word of god that will water the promises of god let her be the one please god i ain't looking for no other and when he found rebecca brother it was over he was leaving the city never to return again [Applause] all right [Music] all right let me try to just get myself together uh the lord is good amen here in the spoken words original seat says the messenger of malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time we are all looking for him uh we believe he will come now here he was on the scene giving this information and telling the church we're looking for him now you had to be able to put two and two together amen since we believe he will come that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see it he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by god's word and the vindicated god will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth when god takes a picture with him and amen and now they got it there in washington dc that's god vindicating him amen every time at the end of a sermon he's calling out these different conditions of people that's god vindicating him you know vision after vision that was fulfilled god vindicating him praise god all right uh he says um um god will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did elijah for it is elijah coming make him ready for the mount zion rapture elijah coming making ready for the mount zion rapture praise god he says um jesus said in the last days it would be like lot's time and uh you know that's just where homosexuality is completely out of control and and we're there amen you you television watches praise god when you turn on your television and you know you got one you turn it on praise god it's the truth in it you see them commercials that they presenting nowadays i'll be sitting in the restaurants and they had a tv on and i'm i'm like wow i mean they they it's blatant now right these these the homosexual relationships are just blatant they're making our kids see this type of stuff they used to hide this type of stuff now it's blatant all out in the open it still don't mean god's accepting it i don't care how many laws you pass to try to make man accept it you will never get god to accept it amen hallelujah glory to god all right so he says um uh in the last days uh it would be like lot's time his preaching will be with the spirit and strength line of god's word because so much has been called god's truth many will misunderstand this true messenger i god wrote here p r o p h e c i mean a p h e c prophecy because uh because so much has been called god's truth by fakers many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger well let's go on this is and and and i just love it because the by by the angel lord telling the prophet to pick up his pen and write the angel was writing prophecy and it said many true ministers will misunderstand the messenger we are seeing that even today true men of god that god has used their ministries have been a blessing to the people but now they're forsaking the word of god because they misunderstand [Music] they misunderstand praise the lord amen so you know they misunderstand the messenger and i and i i have to tell people this the message is not bridges the message is not bridges that's not why we follow the message because some men fell off a bridge that's not the message right the message is not about a bear that is not the message if that's what you're looking for you have missed the message but the message is the revelation of the word of god that has contested us out through the mouth of a prophet that's what we're following amen it's the revealed truth of the word of god hallelujah amen glory to god i i wasn't there to see no bear i'm probably not gonna ever be there to see a bear so that don't bother me at all that that's that's his personal testimony and god dealt with him personally about it but that's not the message there's nowhere in the scripture where god say uh look for a bear look for a bridge that ain't even in the scripture but i am looking for an elijah praise god hallelujah to the lamb of god he says but uh many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger as the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing now look at this the second forerunner will do the same by pointing the people to a word born brought now you would think the second four runner would actually point the people amen uh to something else maybe it was maybe maybe this quote would say something like the second forerunner would point the people to jesus hallelujah but actually if you really look at the quote that's exactly what it said it said word born bright word is capitalized in the beginning was the and the word was and the word was with god and it also said the word w-o-r-d became flesh and dwelt among us now most people want to leave it only at christ but the word has also become our flesh and i want to tell you something it is dwelling among us right now we ain't waiting for it to come it is already here that's why the prophet points the people to a word born bright he's talking about you this morning look at this pointing the people to a world born the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god will come forth from his lips god help us to be ready for this near event i better leave it from right here and i just you know quickly i want to go back i gave you some things last week but i want to repeat them today because i got to point the people to the word born brides i need you to know who you are you're not here by accident you're not here by chance you were brought to the earth amen uh a man with a purpose by almighty god glory to god amen amen and i was watching a little that video that brother quaker sent us amen and the brothers chad and brother chikosi just preaching a preaching machine and he was just talking about how your your natural birth and brother troy just hit this recently your natural birth is is a greater miracle praise god then the virgin birth your natural birth is a greater miracle than the virgin birth see when the sperm and the egg came together you know it was just um uh brother brandon preaches the sermon one in a million amen how he said say it's not the first little germ that hits it amen because you know he said a germ could be in the in the back somehow jump over all the other germs to get to that egg and when it gets there it all it also has in the germ the color of your eyes praise god it has your height come on it has all of your amen every all of your makeup is inside that term and by predestination god allows a certain germ that's in the sperm to strike the egg and when it strikes it brings forth life man you are a miracle you're not a mistake you are a miracle [Applause] please god you need to know who you are one in a million praise god we need to know this church right we're not here by happenstance amen uh look my faith is all in christ i got my complete confidence in him i know he's the one that's that's that's been providing for me he's the one that's taking care of me he's the one that's healing my body it's all about christ all right now this word born bride i want to read a couple things to you that same word that was made flesh and what among us has become our flesh i'm talking about you the word born bride if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it your flesh is holding these promises your flesh the one that the devil actually tell you ain't gonna make it your flesh is holding the promise of god your flesh that done been so messed up so defeated but your flesh is still holding a promise you know even in your defeat come on somebody you couldn't stay in your sin and your defeat the reason you are here to this morning because your flesh is holding a promise a promise that you might not even know was there praise god the reason you can go out and come back in your flesh is holding god's promise and god will spare your flesh in order to fulfill his promise come on somebody sarah's flesh was holding the promise that she was going to have a son and when they went down there to that king god had to spare sarah's flesh [Applause] sarah representing the pride i mean you are represented in that story god has been sparing your flesh otherwise you would have died a long time ago amen your flesh is holding the promise glory to god here's the secret of this the word is in the bright as it was in mary glory to god i love this look at this one i'm talking about you the the word born bribe you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands hallelujah in the presence of god you stand as though you never seen that the first place the devil can't accuse you of nothing because the blood has cleansed you from every sin you are perfect that's what the prophet said and i'm just i'm just reminding us who we are as the word born bride the bride has the mind of christ but she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass all you got to do is release it out of your mouth the spirit itself will take care of the rest of it look at this i love this so when a spirit born spirit-filled man and faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips that's the same as deity speaking every mountain has to has to go satan cannot stand before that man or that woman praise god can i give you one more that i just added to in the presence of almighty god your name is indelibly wrote with the blood of jesus christ glorified in his presence positionally placed here on earth for a purpose to do the will of the will of god you see your position now i have to put that in there amen that your name was indelibly wrote amen with the blood of jesus christ because when your name is wrote indelibly that means it cannot be erased i want you to get that your sin can't erase your name your failures cannot erase your name your unbelief cannot erase your name indelibly the word boring bride is ordained to destroy the works of the devil let me go on here a little further amen uh i want to uh just bring a couple couple thoughts in my god this is out of the message proving his word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah says now we see now we say he's raised from the dead i didn't say it the word here said it they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts in sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus see he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty jesus said as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed hallelujah amen not no more as a church see not no more i say the bride is called see in the days of the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this now bridegroom call goes back to amen matthew 25 i believe that's uh brother brother troy hit a little bit of that amen where you have these these ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish now they all had lamps read the bible they all 10 of them had lamps glory to god the problem was a man that when they lamps went out they didn't have extra oil amen they were all pure they were all virtuous and as far as living is concerned amen but the one the one the foolish ones was missing something hallelujah now brother branham tells us that they were missing the holy spirit glory to god we can go a little further than that and say you know because the holy ghost uh is also the vindicated word the amen the holy ghost is also the truth of the word of god it's not just a feeling on your flesh but when you truly got the holy ghost the holy ghost agrees with the word why does the holy ghost agree with the word because the holy ghost wrote the word amen amen the holy ghost ain't going to disagree with what he wrote oh hallelujah somebody amen the holy ghost gonna say amen to his word that he wrote so when you got the holy ghost it will cause you to come in line with what the word says [Music] not just a feeling on your flesh amen it goes beyond that my god his word is spirit and life all right all right all right now stay with me here the bridegroom call right uh be ready because the bridegroom you know when when the call came in matthew 25 they had to be i mean hey he's here you couldn't go get ready you had to already be ready the bridegroom call would come right through this when the son of man will come down come in human flesh to unite the two together now i i want you to catch that the job of brother branham amen is to unite us with christ this is why the bible says amen uh uh the hearts of the children will be turned to their fathers that means our hearts are supposed to fall in love with the word of god his ministry is supposed to do that watch it now watch it watch these things amen watch this it says uh and when the son of man will come down come in human flesh to unite the two together oh glory the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman i don't know uh do you see what i mean it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his words so real that he'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper so the word is uniting us making us one amen then she'll go home to the wedding song he says amen she's old glory to god here's another a statement for the word born bride she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage [Music] i hope we're getting this church we are going to a wedding supper not to a marriage not to a marriage well we need to know when did the marriage take place if we're going to a wedding supper when did the people get married [Music] when you when you're coming to the church and hearing the word of god amen are you receiving the promises of god you are saying i will i do when you leave here determined to live what you heard you are saying i will i do praise god the marriage is taking place right now right here [Applause] as you yield your will to his will you're becoming married to him [Music] [Applause] amen hallelujah to the lamb of god look at this amen he says uh uh she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage feel your flesh sell uh self all the flesh of mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper amen when the word here unites with the person and they too become one can i just you know inject here um i know you know we got to kind of be like mary in scripture when mary was presented a man this uh magnificent story yeah uh that you know you're highly favored visit visited by an angel and she's told that you're highly favored and you know what mary uh you know by being highly favored you're going to have a child mary say wait a minute a child now now you ain't gonna take my testimony from me if i can put it that way i'm a virgin i've been keeping myself all these years now you ain't gonna mess up my testimony say how do these things be i don't know no man how i'm gonna get pregnant he said no no the holy spirit see the holy spirit is the one that does the job anyway we preach it but the holy spirit got to be the one that do it we just saw the word but the holy ghost got to take care of it [Applause] it's the holy ghost that's got to bring you revelation it's the holy ghost that got to bring you understanding i can have bible study after bible study but if the spirit does not quicken come on somebody but she said she said she said how the hell is going to be he say the holy ghost gonna overshadow you and you'll have that child that you have amen uh well it'll come by the spirit of god so he said she said i never heard no language like that i ain't never heard nobody talk like that i mean i can't understand this my preacher can't explain it i don't know who i can go to to talk to and get answers but she didn't cheat and say she didn't say i doubt it she said be it unto me according to thy word and this is the way god wants us to operate god i can't understand it god i don't know what it what what brother jack might be saying but be it unto me according to thy word if you call me bride then i'm brides [Applause] hallelujah he says but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word he unites with the person and the two become one he says then what does it then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians glory the son of man the word in the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing hallelujah now i got something i just need to just share with you a couple things just let me let me drop this in and uh the lord will help us to move forward in this uh palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar sermon that the prophet preaches he makes a statement here and i want you to see this glory glory i gotta plant these seeds hey because this was gonna come up if i plant the seed i know what's coming up hallelujah glory now look at this there was one time before the foundation of the world i was eternal when god thought of me i was thought up before the foundation of the world see i'm not a mistake i'm not i'm not junk because god don't make junk oh you need to understand it it wasn't my mom and daddy that brought me here god brought me here amen hallelujah somebody tell your mistake was the birth telling you a lie it wasn't it wasn't no mistake this just to predestinate the plan of god he says i was thought of before the foundational world my name was put in the lamb's book of life and i like this so was yours before there was even one grain of sand how many knows that's bible it says how many know that god put your name in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world then in god's thinking we were born right then into his kingdom and god's thinking but we had to go through all these different things in life before we actually realize who we were in him glory to god god knew exactly what you were going through the devil tried to cut some of us off way before our time gave us false dreams the devil the devil can give you a dream you know give you a false dream a false experience and tell you that your life is going to be taken from you that devil's a liar he cannot control when you leave here he he can control when you came and he can't control when you leave look look at this look at this it says uh uh and god's thinking we were born right then into his kingdom now watch this one day there come a body through a holy wedlock my father and mother and they they sired me and here i come william branham represented in a body of flesh now you know me as william branham a man now he says you know me as william branham a man i can also say you know me jack duff as a man hallelujah god know me amen william branham a thought in his own mind and an expression amen hallelujah if god you want to be seen the way god sees you man may see you as a failure man may see you as a mistake man may see you in all types of negative ways but god says no that's my fault not just my fault not just a dead thought when you come walking down the road god say that is my thought expressed glory to god we know we're not here by accident we know we're not here by chance we're here by predestination you know when we look at uh scripture we get all the way to the end of the bible all the way to revelation 22 and we see a scripture say the spirit and the bride say come that ought to tell you that this whole story has been about you amen this whole story has been about a wedding glory to god the whole story has been about that's why we can go back to genesis and get the story of rebecca because her story types your story glory to god her story types your story can we just pick up just a little bit here i'm going to move on amen i want to just i just want to say something here a man amen amen amen now when we look at rebecca when i say her story types your story there's some things a man about her that we need to look at first thing she was not fearful rebecca was a woman of faith rebecca was not afraid you got to think about what was being asked of her here i got this one man coming and giving me a testimony about uh abraham he's telling me that that we're related and everything and abraham has a son and and and while he's on the mission to come here the elies is coming and telling a story but you know uh what i believe got rebecca's attention is when eliezers say i was praying a prayer and in my prayer i say i'm gonna approach a woman and when i when i ask her for water let the woman that also say i'm gonna give you a camel's drink let her be the woman eliezer prayed a very specific prayer and god did a very specific thing while he was praying his eyes was closed and he was praying god let it let that be the woman and uh and uh and before he could even open his eyes rebecca was standing there rebecca was standing there and when he saw he say uh now you just ask god for something now you got to operate in some some way now eliza not and i approach her i put it there approach her eliezer say uh let me get a drink of water says uh okay and she reached out reached down got him some water she say uh now let me also get some water for your ten camels and when eliezer heard that he said oh god don't answer my prayer now he's saying nothing to rebecca he just watched it watch the uh uh work diligently praise god and as he's watching her he said this has got to be the one do you have some family around here so yeah my dad is this and my my brother my mama said oh uh you know this is this has got to be an answer to prayer gave us some gifts she went taking off running home to tell her tell her family what just happened her brother comes back to the well said we got room at the house for you and your people amen and the animals come onto the house and you'll say yeah i'm coming now i got to go to that house for sure i'm here for a purpose he said now let me tell you what happened he says my master abraham sent me to do this and do that he said fine he find isaac a wife from amongst his own people and when i found out that y'all related i knew this was gone it says then i also prayed while i was praying god answered a prayer to rebecca now when rebecca heard eliza tell his testimony praise the name of the lord i'm i miss that brother i'll get you later on glory to god it says but eliezer rebecca heard eliezer tell the testimony his experience oh hallelujah when she heard that this was a praying man where she heard that this was a man that could hear from god she could have faith to join a man like this on a journey because i know he got my best interest in mine so she was not fearful after she heard the testimony oh my god can i tell y'all something with all that god has done in this church nobody should have no fear [Music] [Applause] now it's one thing amen to be what i call uh precautions nothing wrong with that i locked my door too when i left this morning you understand i locked my door when i left my house this morning i'm not gonna invite no thief to come in i lock my door in the parking lot because i don't know who might try to jump in my car and steal it so i'm going to try to do some precautionary things to prevent them from doing that come on somebody amen when i wear my mask that's a precautionary measure it's that's all it is i don't want to get sick now you may want to get sick not me i don't want it so i do things to prevent myself from getting it praise the lord i was telling somebody you know i was talking with brother west go praise god we were talking having real good fellowship and i said you know there's we gotta there's a line of faith and fear that we gotta we gotta watch i said now uh there's places that i know i found myself in that i might not have a mass that's where my faith kicks in because i know god's gonna protect me praise the lord i know god gonna protect me i might not have i might have forgot it but i know god gonna protect me praise the lord somebody amen but then there's other times where i'm gonna have it especially you don't you don't told me there's many cases many okay i'm putting mine on i ain't gonna tempt the lord you gotta have some wisdom all right all right all right all right all right let me go on she was not fearful she was willing to take the step of faith and follow the testimony of eliezer the messenger amen uh uh you know i got other thing about rebecca she was a virgin who was fair to look upon and the bride is going to be virgin to the truth according to second corinthians 11 and 2. the other thing about rebecca rebecca and isaac brother branham said it rebecca and isaac was blood relation cousins now back then you could get married to your cousin today you better not look at your cousin amen praise god amen back then you can do it that way i mean uh uh even in the days of uh adam and eve their their sons married their daughters that's all that was on the earth at that time and the blood the blood was strong that you wouldn't have any problems when people got hooked up like that nowadays it's gonna be issues praise god amen you have feelings for your cousin rebuke that devil rebuke that devil that's a devil from hell amen amen but rebecca and isaac with blood relation cousins and the bride of jesus christ his blood relation to him because we've been bought by the blood of jesus we're blood bought bright we will the other thing is uh some characteristics of this bride she will worship in spirit and in truth because the father is seeking for those that will worship him in that manner glory to god uh the camel that rebecca watered is the same one that took her to her isaac glory to god brother abraham said that's the type of the church today watering and blessing the same holy spirit that's going to lift us up and take us to our new home amen i come to church to bless the lord come to church to live let me raise my voice say amen to something give me something to say amen too hallelujah hallelujah he says uh the other thing other characteristic about the bride she won't have any spots wrinkles or blemishes spiritually speaking amen she will be holy because holiness without no man will see the lord amen amen i like that according to deuteronomy 22 5 she will be dressed according to god's work amen and the other thing about this bride she will follow her messenger just as rebecca follow follow eliezer amen glory glory glory now let me just go on amen here i want to drop back into something in a second amen all right hallelujah all right uh i can i can i can oh oh yeah i don't think i read this i want to go to uh this invisible union of the bride of christ invisible union i told you the marriage is taking place right now now look just listen to the sermon title and brother branham gives you the invisible union of the bride of christ i mean we didn't know there was no decorating the church there was no no no taking pictures nothing just an invisible union as you were saying amen to the word you don't realize you were agreeing with him you were accepting the marriage vows every time lord yes lord yes amen praise god yes lord and you i mean as you read the word you are as you make changes in your life because of what your husband said some of y'all fighting me as the preacher i am not your husband not like that your spiritual husband according to what the prophecy i got to bring in the word but jesus christ is your maker he is your real husband when he gives you his word all he wants you to say is just amen you know your husband got your best interest in mine why would you wear something that don't please him why would a woman wear something that don't please her husband praise the lord y'all i'm trying to stay out of these things i wouldn't want my wife walking around with a mini skirt [Music] for who to see what amen for who to see what i wouldn't want my wife doing that no honey oh that's too short uh-oh husband you have a right to tell your wife that's too short you have a right to tell it that's too see-through you have a right to do that and when you don't exercise you're right then the spiritual husband kicks in no that no that don't look oh no honey that's that's no when you bend down i mean when you when you sit down your knees are showing [Music] your husband said it and if you got a wife that would tell her i don't care what you say you got you you got some trouble on your hand hey man if she won't submit to you she won't be going to no rapture praise the lord because she's not submitting to a head all right and those that is not married your head is the word so when the word say something you just say amen yes lord yes god yes your husband your husband wants to be pleased with you all right you didn't know you was married did you i got a quote for you invisible union of the bride of christ now i i ain't say you gonna get married i say you are married right hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky says you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace a merited of your own god did it that mean god gave it to you when you didn't even deserve it god did it amen himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped because you were fought in god's mind right in your father mother sired you you were brought here through their union praise god but you didn't come just as a child of your father mother you came as a thought of god express look at this he knew you before the foundation world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on a book what a thanksgiving hallelujah praise our god i'm telling you already married oh glory to god already married to almighty god and see what the devil's trying to do is get you to commit adultery on your vows like he got eve at the beginning but somebody that rise up with the revelation no satan i see you praise god and and when the devil come with someone these evil thoughts say not today satan amen all right all right uh i i just i i wanna i to get to something here let's go back to the scripture in john 3. oh glory glory glory thank you jesus amen amen amen all right john 3. uh it said in verse 26 says they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizes and all men come to him john answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven a man don't it's not what a man possesses is what god gives him right and remember brother um um anderson made a statement says you know if god called you to be pastor and they say you're gonna pass the 499 you will not have 500. and you won't have 498 you're going to have 499. if god could you be pastor said 10 you're not going to have 11. you're not going to have nine you're going to have 10. so you can't do nothing but what god allows you to do praise god amen it says john answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he was the forerunner of of jesus first coming he was a forerunner according to malachi chapter four god would send an elijah amen there were two one was going to turn their hearts or the fathers to the children the other was going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers john's ministry came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children look at this john says um i'm sent before him he that half the bride is the bridegroom it says but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoi heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled now i just wanted to break in just a little bit on that friend of the bridegroom amen john john was identifying himself amen hearing the scripture say i'm not the bridegroom but i am a friend of the bridegroom hallelujah amen now i just picked up something off the internet here uh there there's a this article's titled an eastern wedding feasts i won't read the whole thing amen but just a little something to inject in here jesus referred to his coming as a wedding feast in several places in the gospels uh to grasp his second coming one needs to understand the prophetic portrayal of the eastern wedding feasts all right now he says a wedding in israel was a joyous occasion that could last as long as a week a wedding in israel was a joyous occasion that could last as long as a week now a week has seven days praise the lord somebody amen and what god sent us was seven church age messengers we are in the seven church age called out of it i should say amen so we're at the close of the day now hallelujah if a week lasts seven days and a marriage lasts for seven days christ was marrying a gentile bride the seven church ages was to the gentiles hallelujah we are in the marriage right now and this is a joyous occasion hallelujah let me go on amen it says our community members prepare with prayerful expectancy not only because their regard for the couple but also because each wedding symbolized the cleansing of sin for the nation of israel when they as a body were to be married to their coming messiah my each aspect of the formal preparations represented a part of their time um part of their entire redemption it was such a significant occasion for the community that some prepared by fasting when they whenever they get married when they get married in israel some of the people actually prepare for the marriage ceremony through fasting look at this they prepare by fasting prayer and washings hallelujah now i want to skip this and go down to this other little section they said now um my glory glory glory says the parents of both the groom and the brat in the eastern culture the marriage plans included three distinct stages now one of these stages they say the first was the arrangement that's the first stage the arrangement of the marriage my god now look at this statement parents could make the arrangements for the marriage of their children before the children were even born glory to god in the eastern amen traditions parents would sign a contract saying my son will marry your daughter when they get of age before the children are even born they are already signing the contract that they will be married and what i'm trying to say god predestinated before you was even born that you would be married to him oh hallelujah ain't no devil can stop this because the devil didn't start this [Music] before you were born you were already married so that's why when you leave here you're going to the wedding supper you you didn't you did you didn't stumble into this i mean this this message by mistake glory to god glory to god now i want to i want to i want to uh just just just just say this it says it was exceptional for the bride and groom to meet face to face before the wedding feasts the easterners believed that the love between a couple is set in motion during the final exchange of the ten pieces of silver during the wedding feast and that their love is more like a predestined divine union between a brother and a sister it says the dowry to be paid by the father from the household accounts administered by the mother of the groom to the family of the bride it's also negotiated during the arrangement period so you know now in our in our uh culture we don't have dowries but sometimes in some of the the um uh the saints from africa they do have dollars hey man you gotta pay something for that young lady now y'all most young men ain't gonna waste their time if they ain't got no dowry praise the lord you're gonna have to pay something amen they try to make it very very they want that fellow to to feel it the decision that you make we don't want you to just up and leave it one day when when when when things get tough so we're gonna we're gonna hit you in the pocket praise god amen right i mean yeah you're gonna have to invest in this wedding praise the lord church hallelujah glory all right so now i want to just kind of bring this this next little paragraph in it says um now let me let me just keep reading it says um uh the diary to be paid by the father from the household accounts administered by the mother of the groom to the family of the bride is also negotiated during the arrangement period if a son reached marriageable age and had not yet been entered into an arrangement he could go to his father and ask him to find him a wife daddy go find me a wife glory to god amen that's what abraham did for isaac went and found him a wife glory glory i told your parents need to be involved in these things glory says then the mother of the groom would consult her son and go with female relatives to the homes of kinsmen in search of a wife that would be appropriate for her son not any woman going to be able to marry my son she got to be appropriate she got a dress appropriate she got to look appropriate hallelujah say she would meet with the mothers of the eligible daughters see that's a mama asking some questions i mean like going on an interview glory to god when she found a potential bride for her son and the daughter consented through her mother and the son expressed his approval to his mother plans were made by the father of the groom for the formal betrothal agreement that is where the friend of the bridegroom comes in watch it now for the betrothal contract the father of the groom selected a deputy he selects a man for the contract between these two uh people that's gonna get married to families that's about to unite through a marriage of their children he says he selects a deputy as the friend of the bridegroom oh glory to god hallelujah so before amen a marriage actually occurs you got to have a friend of the bridegroom that goes with the contract to the other party to amen the the uh uh he would go to the bride's family i want to tell you the friend of the bridegroom is sent from heaven sent by god to the bride amen to see if they gonna sign to say we gonna marry amen this man that we just heard about we heard of his testimonies we heard of his character and yes we want to get married to him the friend of the bridegroom is the one that takes care of the contract brother brother paul brother iranius brother martin brother columba brother luther brother wesley and brother branham we're all friends of the bridegroom presenting to you the pride in your respective day the marriage contract brother you had to sign it or reject it and when you signed it you couldn't marry right thing amen i love this see now the father of the groom selected a deputy the father selected you don't tell the father who to send as his friend of the bridegroom it's hit that ain't your job your job is to say yes or no you don't know don't send me him he ain't gonna be in the picture anyway oh you don't get it his job is simply just to present to you the contract and what i'm saying brother branham's job was to present to you the word of god that's the contract all right watch this it says that the the deputy and the father proceeded to the prospective bride's home where the father of the bribe had also selected a deputy amen or another daughter to act in his behalf the details of the dowry and the character of both the the the soon-to-be bride and groom would be discussed at the conclusion of the negotiations a contract was signed with copies for each party it stipulated the portion of the diary to be paid to seal the betrothal contract and the fulfilling portion to be given during the wedding feasts it also set the date of the wedding feast which was always most often months or even years in the future when this was completed refreshments were served amen as each party congratulate the other and and extol the character of both the groom and the bride now here's the thing this last little statement i want to make here when the ceremony occurred let me uh let me make sure i get this right glory glory glory glory glory amen amen uh what i'll just kind of just uh oh yes right here right here i was in uh israel and you know i was watching a wedding um take place and as uh you know as they were this couple was you know preparing for their wedding uh i saw the young lady dressed up in a dress and she went and there was a little bench sitting over here in the corner and she went in with her dress and she sat down there's the outdoor she just sat down on the bench and all of her attendants were surrounding her and everybody was just you know just coming over to see make sure she was doing all right and then there came a time where the young man that was gonna get married to her he walks up and all the men are with him and uh and as he walks up he walks up to his bride to be in and he takes it and he lifts her veil and when he does that he looks at her and then he kind of gives a nod saying yes this is the one this is the one this is the one uh he didn't want no jacob experience you ain't gonna trick me when i get down here to the altar now and notice now there was only one woman dressed like a bride it wasn't it was all the other women were just attendants but there was only one woman that would be dressed like the bride so first he's looking for her dress she's looking at your dress he's concerned about how we dress right so this one woman is dressed as the bride that's why you know they say when a woman get married nobody else comes here white you don't wear white to a wedding anybody see you wearing white they they liable to say something to you what you doing right you're not the bride it's not about you this is about the bride hallelujah right but but there she stands in that dress and she was just sitting there and the man just walked up lifted that veil and he said now okay i can see this is the one that i chose and this is one i'm gonna wait for he he leaves her goes to the altar and waits for the ceremony to begin hallelujah hallelujah right amen but here i want to tell you now after you know this betrothal uh takes place and the friend of the bridegroom actually presents this to the you know as a contract to the uh to to the bride's family now this is what happened on the day of the ceremony the veil brought would proceed from her family's house escorted by her attendants singers dancers musicians and children above her would be a canopy with colored claw streamers fluttering in whatever breeze there there may have been the procession would move slowly through the town stopping at times to allow the dancers to perform to the music and singing when they arrived at the groom's parents house the bride would be escorted to her mother-in-law's suite once the bride was settled the groom would arrive at the doorway then the groom would gently lift the veil of his bride for his first long-awaited glimpse the groom would then proclaim his satisfaction for all to hear to which the friend of the bridegroom who has sealed the contract would be very pleased this is why john could say didn't i tell y'all i was coming before him i'm just a friend of the bride group and john said look i'm he made the statement he says uh he that has the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this praise god this my joy therefore is fulfilled and then he goes on later say i must decrease so that he can increase all i needed to know is that is the bridegroom satisfied with his pride when eliezer saw that isaac was satisfied with becca his job was done and when brother branham was called off the scene he knew god was satisfied with the pride that he had presented to him oh glory to god i can tell you church i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them [Applause] hey manny manny man hallelujah i want to just read this last quote oh jesus maybe i might have time for a couple more let me just read something here i want to go back to the pergament church age and i'm at paragraph 176.2 this is the ending of our journey and pick up your pen and write i say step into the vision catch this vision and step into it you have been called to be the bride of jesus christ had a wedding brand of grace slipped on your finger before you was even born a contract an arrangement had been made that you wouldn't be married to christ hallelujah if if i tell you anybody the greatest uh marriage ceremony that you can be a part of is being married to christ hallelujah here uh in the in the permian church age the prophet says this and i shall say the angel of the lord speaking through the prophet and pick up your pen and write says the last day messenger will appear in god's appointed time it's the end time now as as all know that israel is in the homeland anytime now he will come according to malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he would be indicated pointed out in the word revelation 10 7 so that's it's there in scripture that god promised this right and god will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did elijah and be ready for the mount zion showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth don't mean it's the truth you just consider it truth because you've been taught that way right when it comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called god's truth by deceivers here's the last paragraph but this prophet will come and as the forerunner of the first coming cry behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out behold the lamb of god coming in glory he will do this for even as john was the messenger of the truth to the elect so is this one the last messenger to the elect and word born bright your word-born church the word is in the bride as it was in mary the devil can't take it out cause the devil didn't put it in amen amen i just since i am the word-born bride i'm just gonna tell you who i am see even that song says uh uh uh we are chosen generation called forth to show his excellence you know i i i what's the words uh i i know who i am yeah i know who i am right and that that wasn't just a song right but that's your testimony i know who i am i know who i am amen i i i'm walking in power i'm a walking miracle oh y'all y'all y'all like that's i live a life you know and they say favor ain't fair it's not it's not when i get promotions when everybody else losing their jobs it ain't fair but i live a life i live a life of favor because i know who i am when a man got a wife that he loved he gonna do all kind of favorable things for her praise the lord this is my wife that's why i bought her this because she's my wife praise god glory to god jesus christ take care of us y'all he's done i want to say he's done a real good job [Applause] he's done a real good job we ain't got nothing to be fighting and arguing and worried about no i uh our husband has taken care of us favorite my jesus so since i know who i am let me just give you a few statements about me i am the very righteousness of god amen amen i am loosed by the perfect blood of jesus and since i'm loosed by the perfect blood of jesus no one can lay any charge against me i refuse to let you hold my pass over me i want you to understand what my past is it is actually my past it's not my future it's not my now it's my past i am an heir to all god's power and omnipotence so therefore i need not fear right i may not have the material resources to fall back on but i'm rich in spite of it all hallelujah my security lies in christ because he is my shield and my exceeding great reward i'm gonna tell you i can be happy because i got the giver and by having a giver i got every gift [Music] i'm gonna tell you something else i am more than a conqueror and sometimes i don't feel like it but jesus said i will walk with him in white because i am worthy amen the devil trying to say you don't you know you're not worthy you're not where you don't feel no no you ain't got to the blood of jesus has made you worthy amen here's another one i am the very elect and i cannot be deceived hear the last one i got for you i am a king and a priest and i have dominion over sin i have dominion over the world i have dominion over my flesh you want to know why because my flesh is holding the promise glory so i got control over my flesh no you ain't gonna drink flesh no you ain't gonna smoke no you ain't gonna lay down with this one and lay that no no no no i tell my flesh you're going to church i'm a king and a priest i have demand over sin in the world my flesh and also got dominion over the devil amen i know who i am let me just i'm trying to finish here all right i i i i'm going to skip a little bit this no i this is going to be my last quote it's a long one but it's going to be my last identified masterpiece of god let's let's end it right here the journey has come to a close behold

their shame and here we find ourselves identified in the story of isaac finding his rebecca in order to get his rebecca they needed an eliezer because isaac himself could not go down into that land he found himself an alien found himself a friend of the bridegroom amen we had one in our day yes his name was william marion branham but once the bro once the the friend of the brock room hears the bridegroom's voice speaking with the bride he knows his job has been done and that's what's going on now that's why the bible says the spirit and the bride say come amen amen behold the lamb of god coming in glory god richly bless your church musicians you can make your way i mean also brother solomon i will turn the service over to you i want to say before we have word of prayer i have enjoyed our journey and step into the vision i have thoroughly enjoyed being able to preach to you and and and uh i probably don't say this enough but it's something about preaching that spirit and truth tabernacle there's something about the saints here and and i've you know i i have experienced it myself just you all come with an expectation and your hearts are just ready to receive the word and um it just really helps it really helps when you've got people pulling on the word of god some places you go and you don't have that pool you're just kind of standing there lord give me something you know but but but when you come here and saints entering into the word and saying amen it just really really makes it easy to preach and this this year this journey of stepping to the vision just just sermon after sermon that the lord gave us uh i was just so happy to be able to come and just preach it right here so god bless you saints thank you so much amen i pray that we have caught the vision and i pray that we'll step into it do what god has called us to do in this hour amen let's have a word of prayer father we are grateful oh god for um your word that has been brought to us this year lord what what a journey it has been the enemy has done all he could to disrupt uh so much but yet god uh you have caused us to be overcomers more than conquerors and father we are [Music] we realize it's not our own strength that does that but it's it's you god it's the anointing of the holy ghost that is doing it as we look back father just reflect over this year and lord just revelation after revelation that you're breaking to us and we're saying a man to the word just like rebecca watered the camel as she watered the camel she did not realize that camel that she was watering would actually carry her back to her isaac her husband god this war this word that we're saying a man to this word that we're watering with our amens is the same word that's gonna produce a body change lord and carry us to our isaac who is the lord jesus christ father how grateful we are thank you for bringing us to this final sunday of the year i'm thankful for everyone that's here but god my heart also goes out to those that are not here god i know the enemy is fighting on every hand but i'm praying god that you give people the victory in the midst of the battles lord that they're having reveal yourself to each one god draw us closer to your father help us to to see that the devil's doing everything everything he can to divide us we don't want to be divided we got to stay united together we got to stay united together god so lord jesus i just pray that your spirit will just continue to do the great work that you have done thank you for making us victorious it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise [Music] praise the lord says will you stand with me [Music] kingdom of god is within me i know no defeat only victory the

of god no is only victory the kingdom of god is within me i know no defeat only strength and power come on let's give our god a hand clap of praise praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah what a message amen amen before we go i want to let you have your seats brother josue come and give your testimony praise the lord i bless you church love the lord it's wonderful when we uh recognize who we are is it it is um this morning as i was praying i felt led by the holy spirit to ask brother jack if he can allow me to share this testimony and it's wonderful how god does things because um he said that he would and then i guess as the service went it wasn't the time but i believe that god wanted me to hear something just to confirm to me how great that testimony is and it's a very small testimony but there's a scripture that that says better is little with the fear of god than great treasures and trouble there some so that's kind of like my the testimony is so small but yes so big you know and and and we have to uh find god in those little things and i believe that if you can't um see god on a day to day basis things that that he does for you then i mean people are just waiting for a big thing we got a big house we got a big job yeah it was god but just those little tiny things that he does on a daily basis i think they're so important and there's a scripture in colossians that that says that whatever you do in in in in in in words or indeed do it in the name of the lord and and it also says with thanksgiving you know so i always have that in thought every time i'm doing anything um yesterday the lore allowed us to to have some fellowship me and mandy and we we went to this restaurant and we've been there uh many times and and if many of you know how our our the way we eat and stuff and it's kind of difficult when we go to places it's just like we we to figure out something to put together and then when we put our order most of the time they mess it up you know or they can't get it right they don't understand what we're trying to say so um yesterday when we went to the restaurant um and we sat down before we even did anything um i just told man the house let's let's just pray you know let's just ask god let's just thank god for giving us a chance to to fellowship and and and to be here so let's just pray so we bow our heads and we pray you know we thank god for for allowing us to be there we thank god for giving us a chance to fellowship together and enjoy each other's presence and and and after we finish praying now we just started talking and i started she shared a couple things with me and i was sharing with her how on the way there i had a customer of mine called me and and he he told me that there was a little problem with the horse you know something was going on or whatever so we start i started talking to her about that and i said man i i can't believe man i remember what i did to the horse i remember um how i put the shoes on you know like like i just i just hope that that that it like it doesn't become something else and then she said why don't we why don't we pray over the horse's foot you know and i said well praise the lord you know like the the lord told us to open our mouth why because we can't put limitations on god so even the got a little problem let's pray over the horse's foot and if if there's something there we believe that god can can can fix it so we let's pray so we pray over the host's foot and when we finish praying we start we kept talking and and and i'm telling mandy i said man they always mess our order up you know they are gonna they're probably gonna mess up the the the the the my pasta they're gonna mess up your pizza like they're not gonna put her on right we're gonna have to send it back and she's like why don't we pray over the over our meal let's pray over the food and this is where this testimony became so big to me because i felt that the same thing that happened to eliezer happened to us last night and without me even thinking about that this happened last night so i said les the waitress she was kind of confused when she was taking the order and and and we're like man she's messing it up definitely just get ready to send it back we say let's pray over it so we grab we grab our hands and we start praying i said heavenly father i mean you just we we've literally said like five words and in the middle of the prayer the waitress came back and interrupted our prayer and we we look at her and she's like i just wanted to tell you guys that i went to the chef i told him exactly how you wanted the order i make sure that they get it right i went to the pizza maker i told him how she wants to be and i was like we me and amanda looked at each other and we're like the lord know it's what you're in need of before you even ask so we had a concern something in our heart just something as small as our meal being right and before we even finish the prayer like it happened with eliaser when we opened our eyes she was right then the prayer was already answered i wanted to share that with you guys because it was something so small but yet so big and then we can look at each other and say man god is with us here i believe that he did that because he we he was pleased we did everything in the name of the lord and we were giving god thanks for everything we pray just for being there we pray for a problem that we had so i just want to tell you guys to just bring everything to the lord in prayer and and and not just pray about it but uh uh have faith that he is going to answer your prayer he's so big in in in in little things like that and that is my testimony today god bless you praise the lord amen amen invite god into everything he wants to be involved in every aspect of your lives he loves your saints amen will you stand to your feet we'll sing one more song together i lift my hands in total duration to you you reign on the throne for you
