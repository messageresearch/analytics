[59:34] prayers well in the loss of her her
[59:36] daughter
[59:37] ten years old that is Dennis that is
[59:39] that's big you know that's big certainly
[59:43] what we call a freak accident but God
[59:45] knows all things a man in our prayers
[59:48] that somehow some way God would get
[59:51] glory and man out of this and some might
[59:53] have come to know Jesus so a man just
[59:55] keep them in prayer will say a word of
[59:57] prayer for them as they are making their
[59:59] way back
[59:59] let's just turn to to passage of
[1:00:01] Scripture here Matthew 12 and then also
[1:00:05] John 4
[1:00:05] or just a couple versus a man from both
[1:00:09] of these chapters just a little thought
[1:00:12] that I have in my heart today and just
[1:00:14] believe in God to help us bring it
[1:00:16] together we want to talk on the subject
[1:00:21] of redeemable a man redeemable Matthew
[1:00:26] Matthew 12 verse 22 is where we will
[1:00:31] start it says then was brought unto him
[1:00:36] one possessed with a devil blind and
[1:00:40] dumb and He healed him and so much that
[1:00:45] the blind and dumb both spake and saw
[1:00:47] and all the people were amazed and said
[1:00:51] is not this the Son of David but when
[1:00:55] the Pharisees heard it they said this
[1:00:58] fellow does not cast out Devils
[1:01:02] but by Beelzebub the Prince of the
[1:01:06] Devils and jesus knew their thoughts and
[1:01:09] said unto them every Kingdom divided
[1:01:11] against itself is brought to desolation
[1:01:13] and every city or house divided against
[1:01:17] itself shall not stand and if Satan cast
[1:01:21] out Satan he is divided against himself
[1:01:24] how shall then his kingdom stand and if
[1:01:28] I by Beelzebub cast out Devils
[1:01:32] by whom to your children cast them out
[1:01:35] therefore they shall be your judges but
[1:01:40] if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of
[1:01:43] God and in another passage there when
[1:01:48] one of the other verses where the
[1:01:50] stories recorded he says by the finger
[1:01:52] of God right he cast out there was about
[1:01:55] a finger of God that day that's
[1:01:56] something that really know your your
[1:01:58] position in Christ you gotta wrestle
[1:01:59] with Devils you gotta fight with devils
[1:02:02] and you just point until Devil's where'd
[1:02:04] it go
[1:02:07] hallelujah
[1:02:08] you gotta say a word just point a man
[1:02:12] and actually you know you know when we
[1:02:14] really know who you are the devil come
[1:02:16] using that please don't don't don't cast
[1:02:17] me and then be asking permission can we
[1:02:20] go to pigs please don't take me to the
[1:02:22] can I go to pigs right that's
[1:02:24] power hey man we gotta know who we are
[1:02:27] in Christ he says but if I cast thought
[1:02:29] that was by the Spirit of God then the
[1:02:31] kingdom of God has come unto you and
[1:02:34] let's turn over here to John chapter 4
[1:02:36] we want to try to bring these things
[1:02:38] together in this thought redeemable I'm
[1:02:41] just reading just the first four verses
[1:02:43] of John Ford
[1:02:45] it says when therefore the Lord knew how
[1:02:48] the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made
[1:02:53] and baptized more disciples in John
[1:02:56] though Jesus himself baptized not but
[1:03:01] his disciples he left Judea and departed
[1:03:05] again into Galilee and he must needs go
[1:03:10] through Samaria
[1:03:13] they men the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:03:15] reading of his word let's just bound a
[1:03:17] word of Prayer father we thank you for

[1:04:23] redeemable a few things that we'll get
[1:04:27] to that a quote that I heard recently
[1:04:30] from the Prophet and this just kind of
[1:04:32] stirred up something in my spirit a man
[1:04:36] and as we are you know coming into
[1:04:39] Easter we were already in the season of
[1:04:42] Easter you know we realized that it was
[1:04:45] this whole purpose was going for going
[1:04:47] to the cross a man was to come an extra
[1:04:50] Dean a man and come to bring those that
[1:04:54] were lost and make a way after Adam is
[1:04:56] fallen in the garden Jesus being the
[1:04:59] second Adam was making a way for us to
[1:05:01] come back into the presence of the Lord
[1:05:03] and it was it was just straight

[1:07:41] it's not redeemable if you don't have
[1:07:43] the t-mobile service it's not redeemable
[1:07:46] everything got to be aligned just right
[1:07:48] in order to be redeemable
[1:07:51] stay with me here today all right so I
[1:07:55] want to just start off by reading a
[1:07:57] little scripture here amen from Exodus
[1:07:59] 13 verse 11 through 13 then I'm going to
[1:08:02] read a quote from Redeemer through
[1:08:05] Redemption Exodus 13 verse 11 there's a
[1:08:08] statement here in scripture that I want
[1:08:11] to make because brother branham's gonna
[1:08:12] refer to the statement in this quote so
[1:08:14] it says and it shall be when the Lord
[1:08:16] shall bring thee into the land of the
[1:08:19] canaanites as he sware unto thee into
[1:08:22] thy fathers and shall give it thee that
[1:08:26] thou shall set apart unto the Lord all
[1:08:28] that openeth the matrix and every first
[1:08:31] thing that cometh of a beast which thou
[1:08:34] hast the males shall be the lords and it
[1:08:38] goes on the scripture goes on saying
[1:08:39] every first thing of an ass thou shalt
[1:08:42] redeem with a lamb so Redemption is
[1:08:46] going to happen through the lamb all
[1:08:47] right thou shall redeem with the lamb
[1:08:50] and if that will not redeem it then thou
[1:08:52] shalt break its neck and all the
[1:08:54] firstborn of man among thy children
[1:08:56] shalt thou redeem and that word redeem
[1:08:59] I'm just looking up in the Hebrew
[1:09:00] lexicon it means to ransom to rescue to
[1:09:04] deliver alright to ransom somebody's
[1:09:06] paid the price for you to rescue you
[1:09:09] know that you will lost you needed
[1:09:11] someone to rescue you you were in
[1:09:12] bondage so somebody set you free and
[1:09:14] deliverer hey man that's what that's
[1:09:17] what Redemption is all about Oh Rita God
[1:09:19] hey man I mean I'm trying to hold off
[1:09:24] some things but I want to tell you a man
[1:09:27] true Redemption only happens when you
[1:09:30] hear the word and respond to it you can
[1:09:42] be in denominational bondage
[1:09:45] rather than in the Egyptian bondage Amen
[1:09:48] but it's still on this nevertheless so
[1:09:51] when you hear the word and you respond
[1:09:53] to it then you'll experience true
[1:09:55] Redemption that in order to experience
[1:10:00] true Redemption you first had to be
[1:10:02] redeemable alright stay with me here I
[1:10:09] just want to read a little bit glory to
[1:10:11] God you had the be redeemable hey man
[1:10:14] let me read this this is not a message
[1:10:17] to redeem or redemption says that's the
[1:10:19] way a lot of people are tonight friends
[1:10:21] you just been in seeing so long serving
[1:10:24] the enemy till you think you're still
[1:10:27] tied when you really you're loose right
[1:10:31] you say let's go to Calvary tonight get
[1:10:33] out of the things of the world oh he's
[1:10:35] wonderful know that we are free he who
[1:10:38] the Sun has made free is free indeed
[1:10:40] and you was free to Calvary when jesus
[1:10:44] paid the all sufficient price to God the
[1:10:46] Father when his suffering and flesh and
[1:10:48] died paid the price for your Redemption
[1:10:51] that you could be redeemed back to God
[1:10:53] many of you know the story of redemption
[1:10:56] in the Bible many of you scholars see of
[1:10:58] students ministers teachers and many
[1:11:00] time's little housewives that's not
[1:11:02] teachers really read the Bible how that
[1:11:05] God's plan of redemption I used to tell
[1:11:07] when I was at my Tabernacle the story is
[1:11:09] speaking on Redemption about on the law
[1:11:12] Redemption
[1:11:13] he says that gets out of Exodus of
[1:11:15] course and Leviticus - the vehicle laws
[1:11:17] so I used to say if an old mother horse
[1:11:20] gave birth to the little mule and when
[1:11:23] the little fellow was born and its ears
[1:11:26] was broke down now that's a bad mule to
[1:11:28] begin with he was cross-eyed not neat
[1:11:32] his his tail stuck right straight up
[1:11:35] what a horrible looking mule if the
[1:11:40] mother could look around to that little
[1:11:42] fellow and he could see him stuff he say
[1:11:45] oh oh they'll never feed me saying as
[1:11:48] soon as the master comes out and finds
[1:11:51] me they'll probably just kill me because
[1:11:55] I'm not worth feeding he's looking at
[1:11:57] his conditions looking at a situation
[1:11:59] say he's not worth feeding he says well
[1:12:01] that's just about the way we sinners ah
[1:12:04] did you know that did you know that just
[1:12:06] not worth very much to God's kingdom but
[1:12:10] you know if that old mother understood
[1:12:12] and could speak back to her little coat
[1:12:15] she could say but wait a minute son you
[1:12:19] were born under a birthright so see by
[1:12:23] him being firstborn he could be redeemed
[1:12:26] right no matter what he looked like no
[1:12:29] matter no matter how ugly he was he was
[1:12:32] redeem abode simply by being first born
[1:12:37] you are redeemable by being born again
[1:12:41] listen say so since you were born on the
[1:12:44] birthright
[1:12:45] you are my first you were born on the
[1:12:47] birthright and just because that you
[1:12:49] were born that way you know the priests
[1:12:52] will never see you the only thing that
[1:12:54] will happen the man of the house will
[1:12:56] have to go put a go out into the flock
[1:12:59] and get a limb that's perfect and
[1:13:01] without a blemish own it and take it
[1:13:03] over and the priest will never look at
[1:13:06] the mule hallelujah he'll examine the
[1:13:10] lamb because the mule is born under the
[1:13:13] birthright so the land without a blemish
[1:13:15] has to die for the mule
[1:13:17] that's so disfigured I think God he
[1:13:19] talking about me my sin disfigured me
[1:13:23] but there was a lamb that took my place
[1:13:25] amen says in the land I've a perfect
[1:13:28] lamb dies so that this figure mule can
[1:13:31] live it says what a beautiful pic what a
[1:13:34] beautiful picture of redemption on my
[1:13:36] the perfect Lamb of God died that we
[1:13:39] poor alienated this spigot human beings
[1:13:43] could live again what a picture of
[1:13:45] redemption why that little mule could
[1:13:48] just kick his heel little heels up in
[1:13:50] the air and jump around have a big time
[1:13:53] why because he's Rodina
[1:13:56] man he can dance he can shout he can
[1:13:59] jump he can got a worry about what other
[1:14:01] people say about him what other people
[1:14:02] think about him because he knows he's
[1:14:04] redeemable he was first born and as
[1:14:07] first form and put him a man there was a
[1:14:09] law that if the animals first important
[1:14:12] that they be put to the side they would
[1:14:13] not be offered that on the lam I have to
[1:14:16] take that that that animals place and I
[1:14:18] thank God there was a lamb that took our
[1:14:21] place redeemable I want to go on a
[1:14:24] little further here let's go into
[1:14:26] another look quote this is not about a
[1:14:28] God it is its own interpreter just bear
[1:14:31] with me as we just kind of set our
[1:14:32] foundation for where we want to go glory
[1:14:36] to God I I got some really sharp things
[1:14:39] a man that I have to say and one of them
[1:14:42] is everybody's not redeemable
[1:14:47] everybody's not redeemable that's right
[1:14:49] a man and you know the profit makes
[1:14:51] these statements here and we got even
[1:14:53] pick that up even a scripture you know
[1:14:55] we want to tell everybody that God so
[1:14:57] loved the world that He gave His only
[1:14:58] begotten Son for everybody no God Jesus
[1:15:00] did not die for people that he knew was
[1:15:02] not gonna accept salvation amen he only
[1:15:05] came for those that he knew would accept
[1:15:07] salvation praise the Lord
[1:15:09] so so we you know we're gonna get into
[1:15:10] this a little bit but but lord help us
[1:15:12] he said in this message God is his own
[1:15:14] interpreter hallelujah amen he says this
[1:15:17] now all we are today is the display of
[1:15:21] his attributes amen every one of us
[1:15:24] that's it here we are a display of his
[1:15:27] attributes amen first he was not even
[1:15:30] God Amen God we would just call him the
[1:15:34] eternal one
[1:15:34] he wasn't God because the word English
[1:15:37] word God means object of worship and
[1:15:39] there was nothing to worship Him so he
[1:15:42] was the eternal one the main fountain of
[1:15:44] all intelligence and in this fountain of
[1:15:47] all intelligence there was not an atom
[1:15:49] molecule or nothing like nowhere star
[1:15:53] moon nothing else God what we know as
[1:15:55] God the Great Spirit that was eternal
[1:15:58] never did begin never did in he was
[1:16:01] there and in him was attributes
[1:16:05] hallelujah it was attributes to be God
[1:16:11] there was an attribute there to be God
[1:16:14] and before he could become God he had to
[1:16:17] have something that were worship Him yes
[1:16:21] hallelujah glory to God so he goes and
[1:16:23] saved it's a did this attribute to be
[1:16:26] father attribute to be a son attribute
[1:16:29] to be a savior attribute to be a healer
[1:16:32] all these attributes was in him now
[1:16:34] these things that that is unfolded since
[1:16:36] Tina just his attributes being made
[1:16:39] manifest now let me just stop there just
[1:16:40] for a second
[1:16:41] you know because the Prophet actually
[1:16:42] tells us now there was an attribute in
[1:16:44] him to be God hallelujah now before he
[1:16:48] can become God my mind just think about
[1:16:51] that
[1:16:52] he was the self existing when L know him
[1:16:54] all by himself
[1:16:56] he was not even God yet you can take
[1:16:58] that down a man he was not even God yeah
[1:17:01] until he created something to worship
[1:17:03] it's like you understand so the first
[1:17:06] thing created two words that were angels
[1:17:09] hallelujah a man saw the angels worship
[1:17:11] and they still worship they I mean they
[1:17:14] never get tired of worshiping Amen
[1:17:16] that's what they were created for just
[1:17:18] to bring honor and glory and worship to
[1:17:20] God hallelujah but but still in God it
[1:17:24] was not enough just to be caught
[1:17:30] it was all taken it wasn't just good
[1:18:37] enough just to be caught I want to be a
[1:18:40] father a man you know even you know even
[1:18:44] you know sometimes we have the same same
[1:18:46] things we grow up in life and you know
[1:18:49] we get these little baby dolls and play
[1:18:51] with them and we play you don't even
[1:18:54] have to teach kids you don't have to
[1:18:58] tell them how to play then give the baby
[1:19:00] doll and start playing house all by
[1:19:02] yourself
[1:19:05] this is mama this is Danny this is this
[1:19:08] these are the kids
[1:19:09] they this is something that's in them
[1:19:12] that they also unexpressed the same
[1:19:14] attribute something I want to be a
[1:19:16] father
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:18] I ain't even got no Sun she's already
[1:19:21] thinking about when my son is poor a
[1:19:25] woman that ain't even got no daughter
[1:19:27] she's already thinking about when my
[1:19:29] daughter's born I'm gonna do this and
[1:19:31] I'm gonna do that when I had I'm gonna
[1:19:32] do this but I have they already thinking
[1:19:35] about that and when that child is
[1:19:37] actually born
[1:19:38] that child become an attribute of your
[1:19:40] thoughts do you want to be a father he
[1:19:50] wanted to be a healer and in order for
[1:19:52] him to be a healer well somebody I mean
[1:19:59] even it feels only one person but

[1:20:19] attribute of deliverance to set them

[1:20:25] lost a man then he can express the
[1:20:28] attribute of redemption my God my God
[1:20:32] all right so let's let's let's go a
[1:20:34] little further with this these
[1:20:35] attributes were saying God right these
[1:20:37] attributes was in God now he goes on in
[1:20:40] this statement he says what I mean
[1:20:42] attributes was his thoughts he says what
[1:20:45] I mean is the next paragraph what I mean
[1:20:47] attributes was his thoughts and a word
[1:20:49] is a thought express man you have you
[1:20:54] have young sisters that'll be calling
[1:20:56] out they children's name before they
[1:20:57] even have them
[1:20:58] before even married yeah right they
[1:21:01] thinking about when I get married that
[1:21:03] my son gonna be named this and my
[1:21:05] daughter gonna be made only problem with
[1:21:07] us is that we don't know where there's
[1:21:09] gonna be sons or daughters we don't know
[1:21:12] that because I mean you might be wanting
[1:21:15] all boys but you love with all girls you
[1:21:17] might be warned all girls and in love
[1:21:18] with all boys any man you see but God
[1:21:21] was perfect in his thoughts God was not
[1:21:23] like that
[1:21:24] he knew this was gonna be a son this was
[1:21:26] gonna be a girl
[1:21:27] God knew those things and by knowing
[1:21:29] that he could predestinate all right
[1:21:33] says what I mean attributes was his
[1:21:35] thoughts and a word as a thought Express
[1:21:37] and then that was his thinking when he
[1:21:41] said let there be and there was let it
[1:21:44] be there was says now look he says now
[1:21:46] remember you Christians were his
[1:21:48] thoughts before there was the world you
[1:21:50] were his thoughts before there was a
[1:21:52] world and you are the manifestation of
[1:21:55] his thinking it says before there even
[1:21:58] was a world you were in Christ
[1:22:00] I like that before there was a world you
[1:22:04] were in Christ amen in God in the
[1:22:06] beginning that makes you then you see
[1:22:09] his subjects amen and the whole thing is
[1:22:12] God himself materialized himself
[1:22:14] tangible so he could be handled seen and
[1:22:17] so forth that's what God is the whole
[1:22:20] thing I love this you know as I thought
[1:22:22] about this a little bit you know the
[1:22:24] scripture of Jesus used and I believe
[1:22:26] the script you can be applied to all of
[1:22:27] us he says I come from God
[1:22:29] yeah and I'm going back to God I believe
[1:22:32] that's that that's something that each
[1:22:33] each of us can claim what's right once
[1:22:35] we come in contact with the true
[1:22:38] revelation of the word we understand we
[1:22:40] come from God we were an attribute in
[1:22:41] God's thinking I didn't just like I say
[1:22:43] I didn't just stumble into this message
[1:22:45] I just stumble here no say man God
[1:22:48] predestinated for me to be here
[1:22:52] I mean there was something inside of me
[1:22:55] that was redeemable so when the world
[1:23:00] was presented to me I couldn't reject it
[1:23:03] hey man it's like and listen when I take
[1:23:07] my coupon in here to a mentor to Dunkin
[1:23:10] Donuts and it's a Dunkin Donuts amen
[1:23:14] you cannot reject me for bringing it in
[1:23:16] there it's gonna be trouble if it is
[1:23:20] right give me a manager I gather to save
[1:23:25] Dunkin Donuts
[1:23:26] this Dunkin Donuts I want the coffee
[1:23:29] I want the donut and I will not take no
[1:23:32] for an answer
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:34] two dollars and no two dollars
[1:23:37] I ain't taking no for an answer I'm in
[1:23:43] the right place in order to in order to
[1:23:45] redeem this to party
[1:23:47] how are you so when God presented the
[1:23:49] word to you I'll just work with me here
[1:23:53] and no matter how you gather you can
[1:23:55] think about somebody witnessing to you
[1:23:57] that brothers word God didn't force this
[1:24:00] on you he does presented it to you some
[1:24:03] others begin to talk to you a little bit
[1:24:05] about things in the spiritual that you
[1:24:07] had never seen before they did not
[1:24:09] preach Malik at 4:00 in your church they
[1:24:12] didn't preach revelation 10 7 in your
[1:24:15] church we sing 17 and 30 in your church
[1:24:19] those things were not talked about but
[1:24:21] women when they begin to break this open
[1:24:23] to you and notice now the reason God had
[1:24:27] to send a person to you it's because
[1:24:29] brother Branham tells us the feed word
[1:24:32] passes through the body
[1:24:39] Amen it's got to be something and happy
[1:24:42] with the mom and daddy amen
[1:24:44] the father carrier seed the mama carrier
[1:24:47] egg and they gotta make contact in order
[1:24:49] for a child to comfort but spiritually
[1:24:52] if a child gonna be born the seed word
[1:24:55] it's gotta pass through the body see
[1:25:04] they see word somebody somebody just
[1:25:06] begin to talk to you a little bit about
[1:25:07] the message that was a seed word it's
[1:25:09] passing through the body somebody else
[1:25:11] lips write to you in abrupt birth they
[1:25:15] brought a birth it man it brought a
[1:25:17] connection they said say I can identify
[1:25:18] with that what church you go to
[1:25:20] I want to go holla
[1:25:22] because everybody can't do that there's
[1:25:24] many other people that were here this
[1:25:26] word and they will reject it you
[1:25:30] following a man no no no no no that's
[1:25:32] you're missing it and then all actuality
[1:25:34] if you want to leave it there we all
[1:25:36] following some man if you say Paul said
[1:25:41] you following a man right we all
[1:25:45] following somebody but I just rather be
[1:25:47] like Paul follow me ass
[1:25:52] Louie because everybody game following
[1:25:54] Christ
[1:25:55] oh my stay with me here today you know
[1:25:58] we came from God we're attributes a man
[1:26:00] in his mind and those attributes that
[1:26:02] win his mind they lay in us a man we
[1:26:06] were redeemable
[1:26:07] we were seed and therefore we could be
[1:26:10] quickened correct hallelujah we come
[1:26:13] from God are we going back to God
[1:26:15] and I wanna I wanna I want to tell you
[1:26:17] that you can be religious and still not
[1:26:19] redeemable we're going to that in a
[1:26:24] second you can be religious and still
[1:26:26] not redeemable and we're gonna pick this
[1:26:28] up with the Pharisees the Sadducees and
[1:26:31] Herodians they were very religious but
[1:26:33] they were not redeemable but we also go
[1:26:37] see a woman at the well she was redeemed
[1:26:42] can we go back to Matthew 12 and just
[1:26:45] kind of pick up let me let me just see
[1:26:47] something here oh my god actually you
[1:26:54] know before I hit Matthew 12 let me let
[1:26:57] me just give you this little statement
[1:26:58] the prophecies are predestinated and
[1:27:00] this is either massachusetts milk every
[1:27:02] day
[1:27:02] he says the predestinated is the only
[1:27:04] one that's considered in Redemption yes
[1:27:07] sir the predestinated is the only one
[1:27:10] that is considered in Redemption people
[1:27:14] let actually you know what I can't let
[1:27:16] me let me read that before y'all because
[1:27:17] this was a good quote they would stay
[1:27:20] with Matthew 12 but I'm going back to
[1:27:21] this this quote here I've just got to
[1:27:23] bring this to you notice what he say
[1:27:25] here says the natural burst is in three
[1:27:27] it says what's the first thing happened
[1:27:30] to the woman having a baby what breaks
[1:27:32] first water what breaks next blood
[1:27:35] what's the next process life water blood
[1:27:37] spirit right what happens to the plant
[1:27:41] rots what's the first thing stalk what's
[1:27:43] the next tassel what's the next shuck
[1:27:45] then the grain comes out of that just
[1:27:48] the three stages of it till it gets to
[1:27:50] the grain that's exactly God vindicates
[1:27:54] that that's always been right god
[1:27:56] vindicates it to be true so plainly the
[1:28:00] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:28:04] considered in Redemption let me go on a
[1:28:09] little further did you get it let me say
[1:28:13] that again the predestinated
[1:28:17] is the only one that's considered in
[1:28:20] Redemption people might be making like
[1:28:23] think they are but the real redemption
[1:28:27] is those that are predestinated because
[1:28:31] the very word redeem means to bring back
[1:28:33] is that right to redeem is something to
[1:28:35] redeem anything is to bring it back to
[1:28:38] its original place so if we come from
[1:28:40] God and we're redeemable then we go back
[1:28:44] hallelujah how do you so it's only the
[1:28:47] predestinated
[1:28:48] will be brought back because the others
[1:28:51] didn't come from there right it's gonna
[1:28:54] be some hard things that I gotta say in
[1:28:55] a day the others did not come from there
[1:28:58] that's why they can't go back there
[1:29:01] hallelujah so you know you can um if
[1:29:05] you're gonna talk somebody about man
[1:29:07] yeah I wish you come back home I wish
[1:29:09] you'd come back home you start
[1:29:10] explaining what home was like but if
[1:29:12] they never been there they don't know
[1:29:14] what home is like all only people that's
[1:29:17] been there can't understand what home is
[1:29:19] like and they know what it feels like to
[1:29:21] go back to a man I know what Heaven's
[1:29:23] like because I come from me and I'm
[1:29:25] going back there and this morning I felt
[1:29:28] a little bit of heaven in here to me
[1:29:37] Matthew 12 let's pick this up see
[1:29:39] everybody is not redeemable alright only
[1:29:42] two predestinated now when we look at
[1:29:45] this in Matthew 12 we're seeing a man a
[1:29:48] couple of things I won't read the whole
[1:29:50] chapter but just you know from first one
[1:29:53] to eight I'll just kind of summarize
[1:29:55] what was happening there here the
[1:29:58] disciples were with Jesus and you know
[1:30:00] it was the Sabbath day and they'd be
[1:30:02] getting to walk through the fields a man
[1:30:05] they began to walk through the fields
[1:30:06] and they were Jesus and and as they were
[1:30:08] walking through the fields there's corn
[1:30:10] there that's growing in the field and
[1:30:12] the disciples were hungry the scriptures
[1:30:13] say that they were hungry so they begin
[1:30:15] to break off some of the corn and then
[1:30:17] begin to eat and now I don't know how
[1:30:22] the Pharisees saw him eating the corn I
[1:30:26] don't know if they do you think if they
[1:30:29] showed up at church with corn around
[1:30:31] their mouth
[1:30:32] I don't know what what happened but
[1:30:34] somehow these Pharisees knew today we're
[1:30:36] eating corn I don't know if there were
[1:30:38] some spy Pharisees right there with that
[1:30:41] we're following them in the cornfield
[1:30:43] I've just kind of spying to see exactly
[1:30:45] what they're doing hallelujah because
[1:30:47] you know you got folk better follow you
[1:30:49] and try to spy on what you doing no
[1:30:52] matter how much you claim to be a
[1:30:53] Christian as soon as you make one
[1:30:55] mistake hey man
[1:30:58] as soon as you Sue's you as soon as you
[1:31:00] made me raise your voice
[1:31:02] maybe you got in an argument with
[1:31:04] somebody oh dang the way Christians act
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:08] you're gonna argue with them let them
[1:31:09] know that there's a limb that died in
[1:31:10] your place Amen hallelujah are
[1:31:13] redeemable and there was a lamb that
[1:31:16] died in your place so get your eyes off
[1:31:18] me put your eyes on the lamb
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:29] shouting and jumping because he realized
[1:31:32] lamb took his place it's not me don't
[1:31:37] give me a license seeing those but I
[1:31:41] know that if I make a mistake there's
[1:31:44] somebody that took my place so so here
[1:31:47] these the Pharisees alone you know upset
[1:31:50] that they'd eaten on the Sabbath day
[1:31:52] they're upset you're not supposed to eat
[1:31:54] corn on the Sabbath day don't go to the
[1:31:57] fields and pick corn and eat that that's
[1:31:59] wrong and here they're coming to Jesus
[1:32:01] with all kind of questions to me he said
[1:32:02] now come now
[1:32:03] now you're going to remember how David
[1:32:05] and and they went to I mean they here
[1:32:08] I'm gonna pick it up here now verse 3
[1:32:11] and 4 says but he said to them have you
[1:32:14] not read what David did when he was a
[1:32:16] hunger and they that were with him and
[1:32:19] how he entered into the house of God and
[1:32:21] Dini the showbread which was not lawful
[1:32:24] for him to eat neither for them which
[1:32:27] were with him but only for the priests
[1:32:29] right he says or have you not read in
[1:32:33] the law how that on the Sabbath days the
[1:32:36] priests amen in the temple profane the
[1:32:38] Sabbath in our blameless that the
[1:32:41] priesthood is their blameless but I say
[1:32:43] to you that in this place is one greater
[1:32:45] than the temple but if you have known
[1:32:47] what this means I will have mercy and
[1:32:50] not sacrifice you and I have condemned
[1:32:52] the guiltless for the Son of Man is Lord
[1:32:54] even another Sabbath day now just begin
[1:32:57] to come against their their their
[1:33:00] teachings Yeah right this was this was
[1:33:02] really coming against some of the things
[1:33:03] that they stood for and what they've
[1:33:05] been kind of keeping the people under
[1:33:07] captivity about you know so so you know
[1:33:09] that the Pharisees are starting to
[1:33:11] develop a problem with the reveal word
[1:33:15] they're having a problem with the reveal
[1:33:17] where they say there's one standing in
[1:33:19] your mist that's greater than the temple
[1:33:22] breeding in this temple I'm the one that
[1:33:26] gave instruction on how to build a
[1:33:27] temple I gave Moses the pattern in
[1:33:32] heaven
[1:33:33] Moses brought it down to earth he made
[1:33:36] an even when the temple was destroyed
[1:33:37] they knew how to rebuild it again and
[1:33:40] y'all still you're worshipping around
[1:33:41] this temple but that's one great
[1:33:44] standing right here in your myths
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:50] look at that can't process this oh Jesus
[1:33:53] they're having a hard time processing a
[1:33:56] man who did who is this man hallelujah
[1:34:00] now the next thing happens is they're
[1:34:02] they're in church and a Bible say that
[1:34:05] they were in a synagogue
[1:34:07] and I think Jesus is very strategic
[1:34:09] about when he does certain things and
[1:34:11] not only way to does it but where he
[1:34:13] does it he's in the synagogue here these
[1:34:16] people to teach him and there's a man
[1:34:18] with the withered hand and he comes into
[1:34:21] the synagogue this Dan and Jesus seem
[1:34:23] just teaching it and nobody's paying
[1:34:25] attention to this man but but Jesus tell
[1:34:28] them say now is it lawful on this type
[1:34:30] of day he actually questioned look at
[1:34:32] look at verse 11 hallelujah amen since I
[1:34:35] actually first 10 it says behold there
[1:34:38] was a man which had his hand with it and
[1:34:39] the acts of saying is it lawful to heal
[1:34:42] on the Sabbath days that they might
[1:34:44] accuse him listen and he said unto Him
[1:34:47] if so so now now they recognize that
[1:34:50] this man has a neat hallelujah sir they
[1:34:54] they recognize let me go a little
[1:34:56] further yeah I might not yeah I might
[1:34:58] not yeah I'm a shorter scripture so I
[1:35:01] know you have to agree with me not only
[1:35:03] did they recognize that this man had a
[1:35:06] meet they were actually able to take
[1:35:09] care of his knee
[1:35:14] stay with me remember that statement
[1:35:16] there not only to be recognized
[1:35:19] he had a meet but they were able to take
[1:35:22] care of me now you say brother Jack why
[1:35:23] you say that
[1:35:24] because Jesus asks the question later on
[1:35:26] he said y'all say I cast the devil out
[1:35:29] by Beelzebub he said how do your people
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:45] get results if you say what I'm doing is
[1:35:48] of the devil how are they kidding
[1:35:50] results this is what Jesus is asking all
[1:35:53] right so he asked so here they know they
[1:35:56] know that they have something to do but
[1:35:58] they want to try to trick Jesus on the
[1:35:59] Sabbath now look just I just love his
[1:36:01] wisdom look at it here verse 11 he says
[1:36:04] unto them what man shall there be among
[1:36:08] you that shall have one sheet and if it
[1:36:10] fall into the pit on the Sabbath day
[1:36:13] will he not let nightly hand not me hold
[1:36:16] on it and lift it out how much then it's
[1:36:20] a man better than a sheep wherefore is
[1:36:24] it lawful to do well on the Sabbath
[1:36:27] wherefore is it lawful to do well on the
[1:36:29] Sabbath days then said he to the man
[1:36:31] stretch forth thine hand and he
[1:36:33] stretched forth and it was it was
[1:36:35] restored whole like ask other a man like
[1:36:38] any other
[1:36:38] so here you know on the Sabbath day they
[1:36:40] got a problem that you don't fit you
[1:36:41] disciples day out they are picking corn
[1:36:44] we got a problem of that not you healing
[1:36:46] people on the Sabbath day you're doing
[1:36:47] well good things on the Sabbath day we
[1:36:49] got a problem with that they're seeking
[1:36:50] to try to kill them and one is sort of
[1:36:52] scripted they say they got together with
[1:36:54] the Herodians the Pharisees got together
[1:36:56] at holy the Herodians looking for a way
[1:36:58] that they could bring death to Jesus I
[1:37:01] want you to watch this because you know
[1:37:04] these demons are uniting against the
[1:37:06] truth right right these demons are
[1:37:09] uniting against the truth and I want to
[1:37:11] tell you in this season you're gonna
[1:37:13] have demons uniting
[1:37:15] against this proof that you stand for
[1:37:17] but I want you to understand I don't
[1:37:19] care how religious they are everybody
[1:37:20] not redeemable so your honor when you
[1:37:24] understand these things then you're not
[1:37:26] shoot by the trial right look at it look
[1:37:29] at it let's go on a little further so
[1:37:30] the third thing that happens in this
[1:37:32] passage you know after the disciples
[1:37:35] have eaten corn now we see a man with a
[1:37:37] withered hand that's heel and now that
[1:37:39] the last day before the the the the the
[1:37:42] Pharisees come to the conclusion that
[1:37:45] you are Beelzebub right I mean you you
[1:37:48] are you are of Beelzebub they want to
[1:37:50] say Jesus you are you are Beelzebub
[1:37:52] which means he was a prince of Devils
[1:37:54] rather than that the son of God they
[1:37:57] call him a prince of Devils that's what
[1:38:00] this is what the religious leaders
[1:38:02] thought of him and this is what this is
[1:38:04] the word that they were going to spread
[1:38:05] amongst the people that this Jesus is
[1:38:08] the Prince of Devil's what I want you to
[1:38:10] see brother branham makes a statement
[1:38:12] he says they say he called it and he
[1:38:15] used this term first life in second life
[1:38:18] he says in their first light the outward
[1:38:21] appearance oh my god it looked like
[1:38:24] these guys had it going they were very
[1:38:26] religious they're very pious and men
[1:38:29] look like they had everything together
[1:38:30] in their first life he say but in their
[1:38:33] second life the one that was behind what
[1:38:36] everybody could see he said it was so
[1:38:38] dark down there they could not receive
[1:38:41] the word but the woman in the way after
[1:38:44] well her first life was very dark
[1:38:47] hallelujah Amen hallelujah she went to
[1:38:51] the well at a time of day where no women
[1:38:54] went with a pure woman we're not going
[1:38:56] to the well she had to she had to go at
[1:38:58] a time of day when women I mean she
[1:39:00] could be identified with somebody that
[1:39:02] was virtuous somebody was
[1:39:04] she cannot even hang out with people
[1:39:06] like that her first life was dark second
[1:39:11] life was full of lights glory to God s
[1:39:17] catch that God was not looking at your
[1:39:20] first life it was what was behind that
[1:39:23] first life that's why this word
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:33] foundation and the word will put you out
[1:39:36] there I don't even care what your
[1:39:38] position was in the church but what's
[1:39:46] the word found you you want to come out
[1:39:49] Jack can you say that because Moses he
[1:39:53] was second in charge but we need winning
[1:39:58] when the word struck him he came out
[1:40:01] left his position I mean you think about
[1:40:09] it because we say man leave all this
[1:40:10] yeah when the word find you you leave
[1:40:12] all that I talk about when the word get
[1:40:15] ahold of you you leave it all you're
[1:40:18] forsaken all further for the cause of
[1:40:20] the word oh hold on to this whirling got
[1:40:28] nothing to offer everything you hold no
[1:40:30] into this world when you die you've done
[1:40:33] with that book so subscribe for things
[1:40:36] that he turn live for things that
[1:40:39] eternal Amen so we picked this up here
[1:40:42] in the scripture Matthew 12 they had
[1:40:44] this problem and I believe what caused
[1:40:48] these these these Pharisees a man to
[1:40:52] reject the words because I have a people
[1:40:54] who's receiving the word watch this
[1:40:56] Matthew 12 verse 22 he started there say
[1:40:58] then was brought unto him one possessed
[1:41:01] with the devil glory to God blind and
[1:41:04] dumb and He healed him and so much that
[1:41:07] the blind and dumb both spake him saw
[1:41:09] and all the people were amazed
[1:41:13] and said it's not this a seven Davis so
[1:41:14] now the people starting to be you know
[1:41:18] they're starting to recognize some
[1:41:19] things and they're like wait a minute
[1:41:21] now we know according to script we
[1:41:23] expected Messiah expected us to
[1:41:25] expecting that say is this it's not this
[1:41:27] man right here the son of David and you
[1:41:29] know I had I have some questions here
[1:41:31] who else
[1:41:32] yeah could fit the description the time
[1:41:41] was right so so so who else would fit
[1:41:44] the description the people starting to a
[1:41:45] mentor to make sense of these things and
[1:41:48] and before and then the Pharisees can
[1:41:51] can allow two people to walk in this
[1:41:54] full light they have to come up with a
[1:41:55] lie and call them Beelzebub and they use
[1:41:58] their influence to pull the people back
[1:42:01] down amen who else could fit the
[1:42:05] description of son of David and my other
[1:42:08] question which Pharisee had the same
[1:42:11] size and Werner's in his ministry now I
[1:42:14] noticed this when they when genomes at
[1:42:16] the temple they even though these
[1:42:18] Pharisees have this type of bility to
[1:42:20] cast out Devils amen
[1:42:22] nobody brought the blind man and the
[1:42:24] dumb man to the Pharisees they brought
[1:42:26] the man directly to Jesus and if you got
[1:42:32] a problem I want to encourage you to do
[1:42:34] something take it directly to Jesus
[1:42:41] hallelujah
[1:42:42] my paths ever religiously go directly to
[1:42:45] Jesus because he's the only one that can
[1:42:48] resolve it you know Acts these questions
[1:42:53] oh my god
[1:42:55] I even said this to myself so which
[1:42:58] which Pharisee had the same signs and
[1:43:00] wonders in his ministry that could
[1:43:01] compare to Jesus and I said this
[1:43:03] collectively all of them together their
[1:43:07] ministry still cannot touch the Ministry
[1:43:09] of Jesus Christ collectively oh my god
[1:43:14] can I go a little further with this
[1:43:16] thing because we've seen the Ministry of
[1:43:18] Jesus return again in the last days one
[1:43:24] prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and
[1:43:27] according revelation 10 7 he sent a
[1:43:30] prophet according to his word and he
[1:43:33] used that profit so supernaturally I
[1:43:35] wanna I wanna ask what ministry compared
[1:43:39] to that ministry together can't even
[1:43:52] compare do you realize that even in most
[1:43:55] of those ministries when they ran into a
[1:43:57] real issue when they ran into a real
[1:44:02] issue go see William Brett I'm happy to
[1:44:12] make it recognize that God gave somebody
[1:44:15] else a little something greater amen now
[1:44:17] I can pray for you but you still ain't
[1:44:19] got well maybe this man could discern
[1:44:21] and tell you what your issues go see
[1:44:24] William Branham all right
[1:44:25] I can appreciate Amanda to do that
[1:44:27] rather than somebody that will not stand
[1:44:30] up and say we got a ministry on the
[1:44:32] earth that can help you with your
[1:44:46] problem what I'm trying to get you to
[1:45:09] see with these Pharisees no matter how
[1:45:11] religious they were how highest they
[1:45:14] were they were not redeemable right
[1:45:19] because they rejected the word yes the
[1:45:22] revealed word for their day
[1:45:23] now they had what we call the written
[1:45:25] word it's like everybody got a Bible
[1:45:28] yeah that's right and you know let me
[1:45:32] just be honest there's two ways to
[1:45:35] understand the Bible one is receive a
[1:45:38] prophet and let him just now not that
[1:45:42] the prophet went scripture by scripture
[1:45:44] but his talk if you catch the Prophet so
[1:45:47] let me let me I gotta say some things
[1:45:48] tell me what not that now that a prophet
[1:45:53] when scripture I scripture that's what
[1:45:54] theologians do yeah so so so you have
[1:45:58] the option to either hear a prophet to
[1:46:01] get understanding of Scripture or you go
[1:46:03] to a theologian and what a theologian
[1:46:05] does because he can't understand that
[1:46:07] these and the Dow's and the dumbest what
[1:46:11] does he do he puts it in modern-day
[1:46:13] language
[1:46:15] and when they put in about any language
[1:46:17] they actually take the meaning of what
[1:46:19] it really meant they take that away
[1:46:21] because they were not catching it by
[1:46:22] revelation they kind of by intellect the
[1:46:26] Pharisees had this thing by intellect
[1:46:28] and with intellect they reject it they
[1:46:32] reject it the manifestation of the word
[1:46:35] for their games you can't catch this by
[1:46:37] intellect now I want to also say
[1:46:38] something else you there's just
[1:46:40] something the Lord gave me know I was
[1:46:42] thinking on this message faith comes by
[1:46:46] oh yeah y'all they whip me yet y'all
[1:46:52] they whip me yet faith comes by hearing
[1:46:55] and hearing of the word of God so it's
[1:46:59] gonna be important for you not just to
[1:47:01] read the message you have to learn how
[1:47:07] to hear the message hear what the
[1:47:11] Prophet is there because faith comes by
[1:47:13] hearing I got I got I got all Saul in
[1:47:18] his messages don't see these that's
[1:47:19] recorded I got so many that I could go
[1:47:22] back and just listen to I can see how he
[1:47:24] said that not just brother Brett upset
[1:47:28] by how did he say that worry the God and
[1:47:33] then because my faith is gonna come I
[1:47:35] mean I'm gonna get a revelation by how I
[1:47:37] hear these things
[1:47:39] unless they stop reading yes you must
[1:47:41] read but they can't come back hearing so
[1:47:46] sometimes put on a tape I don't even
[1:47:50] know what I'm listening to but I'm gonna
[1:47:52] just put this tape on by faith in God to
[1:47:54] speak to me why are you going to bed at
[1:47:56] night just put on the tape you'd be
[1:48:00] surprised at what was what's what's
[1:48:02] coming into your subclass is gonna be an
[1:48:07] annoying about what to hear everybody I
[1:48:10] mean everybody sitting within the sound
[1:48:12] of my voice amen
[1:48:13] mostly Oliver got anchored because you
[1:48:15] have heard the words yeah yeah that's
[1:48:17] right
[1:48:18] anybody give to tell you something at
[1:48:19] the prophecy it might not even be what
[1:48:22] he said but when you're hearing it for
[1:48:24] yourself see this way you know my study
[1:48:28] pattern I have read through the Bible
[1:48:33] umpteen times I can't even count now I
[1:48:38] forget when I started I had a Lord God
[1:48:42] help me Jesus years ago Amen I was uh I
[1:48:46] was so faithful reading my newspaper
[1:48:49] before I go to work I would get that
[1:48:52] paper and you know I want to read on the
[1:48:54] job you know back in the day when they'd
[1:48:56] have cell phones on the job nowadays
[1:48:57] everybody be at work just you know I
[1:48:59] mean you know you we didn't do that back
[1:49:01] in the day I mean that was you a lazy
[1:49:04] employee you were fired you did
[1:49:06] something like that nowadays the boss do
[1:49:08] it you sit in a meeting with the boss
[1:49:10] and he I'm trying to talk to you back in
[1:49:16] the day so so you know I'm like I mean
[1:49:19] we're not gonna read our paper we here
[1:49:20] to work so you know I said I was you
[1:49:23] know I were getting the paper now to
[1:49:24] read I wanted to keep up with the sports
[1:49:26] a man so I could have something to talk
[1:49:28] to people about when I got the word the
[1:49:29] guys want to talk sports I want to talk
[1:49:30] sports what about talking to word with
[1:49:32] them all right but you know I want to
[1:49:35] keep up with all this information so you
[1:49:37] know I get I get the results of the game
[1:49:38] so now I feel like I'm qualified to go
[1:49:40] ahead and talk to somebody all right
[1:49:42] well one day I was going down to pick up
[1:49:44] that paper and was downstairs I went to
[1:49:45] go pick it up pick it up in and I heard
[1:49:47] a voice say if you read your Bible as
[1:49:49] faithfuls you read the sports page
[1:49:51] you'll be much further of the room I
[1:49:54] said oh now I know the devil didn't tell
[1:49:56] me that
[1:49:57] oh no the Devil Went seen that like that
[1:50:01] I know the devil will encourage me to
[1:50:03] read the Bible I said I just heard the
[1:50:07] voice of God
[1:50:07] yeah and he only said it once that's all
[1:50:09] you got to do say it once you remember
[1:50:11] for the rest of your life when God speak
[1:50:13] peace speech
[1:50:15] if you read your Bible Spacek faithful
[1:50:18] as you read this newspaper you'll be
[1:50:20] much further up the road I say okay so
[1:50:23] that very day I found myself a one-year
[1:50:26] Bible reading plan and I start reading
[1:50:28] the Bible every day I read through the
[1:50:30] Bible that first year I got addicted to
[1:50:33] it start reading it through the next
[1:50:34] year and I've been doing that for
[1:50:36] umpteen years now umpteen but I'm gonna
[1:50:45] tell you even in reading your Bible when
[1:50:48] I go back and I'm reading something and
[1:50:50] something strike me and I get it I don't
[1:50:52] care all right what what helps me filter
[1:50:55] it yes right right is when I hear what a
[1:50:58] prophet when I hear what vindicated see
[1:51:07] that's why I can read to you Exodus Amen
[1:51:10] 12 what I just read to you earlier I can
[1:51:13] read them and help you understand what
[1:51:15] that means because the Prophet just kind
[1:51:17] of spoke about now hey now I can take
[1:51:19] that same thought he might've tired of
[1:51:21] the extra 12 but that same thing gonna
[1:51:23] be with Leviticus it's also over in
[1:51:25] numbers so I can follow that thought
[1:51:26] from Exodus all the way through right as
[1:51:33] well as they fake come by hearing here
[1:51:36] in the world here in the world hey man
[1:51:39] all right listen I'm talking about being
[1:51:42] real I'm talk about redeemable yeah all
[1:51:44] right so now these disparities here they
[1:51:47] got a problem Jesus rebukes this devil
[1:51:50] he heals to the the man that's blind the
[1:51:53] man that's dumb he gives them both the
[1:51:57] sight and his ability to speak and and
[1:52:00] when Jesus does this David say you know
[1:52:02] it's just a son of David and this is
[1:52:03] where they come out and begin the cross
[1:52:05] I know this man is not Beelzebub and
[1:52:06] this is where Jesus makes these comments
[1:52:08] let's go back to verse 25 here verse 24
[1:52:11] says but when the Pharisees heard it
[1:52:12] they said this fellow does not cast out
[1:52:15] Devils but by Beelzebub the Prince of
[1:52:18] the Devils
[1:52:19] now Jesus had to do this if I could also
[1:52:22] use this term that he had to show them
[1:52:26] the sign
[1:52:27] of Mosiah he had to show them signs of
[1:52:32] Mosiah a man and by by showing him sons
[1:52:35] of Mosiah it gives them the opportunity
[1:52:36] to accept it or reject it they men if
[1:52:41] they had come from God they would have
[1:52:43] received it and they would have been
[1:52:45] going back to God but because they did
[1:52:47] not come from God they rejected it all
[1:52:51] right look at this he says but when the
[1:52:54] Pharisees heard it they said this fellow
[1:52:57] does not cast out Devils but by
[1:52:59] Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils
[1:53:00] and jesus knew their thoughts and said
[1:53:03] unto him every Kingdom divided against
[1:53:05] itself is brought to desolation and
[1:53:08] every city or house divided against
[1:53:10] itself shall not stand and if Satan cast
[1:53:12] out Satan he is divided against himself
[1:53:16] and I mean he fighting itself listen say
[1:53:19] how she'll then his kingdom staying yeah
[1:53:22] and Enoch then it goes I'm saying I if I
[1:53:24] by Beelzebub cast out Devils by whom do
[1:53:30] your children cast them out Jesus is
[1:53:34] telling y'all get results - but how
[1:53:37] y'all doing this if I was doing this by
[1:53:39] the devil how y'all doing this why I
[1:53:44] said they had a ministry right they had
[1:53:46] things that they were taught even Jesus
[1:53:48] identified that they had something oh my
[1:53:51] god but what they didn't have was the
[1:53:54] reveal words come at this limit let me
[1:53:59] just be honest with you I'm not just
[1:54:00] looking for signs and wonders I'm not
[1:54:06] just looking for signs of Wonders I'm
[1:54:08] looking for truth signs and wonders
[1:54:11] yeah so now now we get to the story of
[1:54:15] the woman at the will you see see how
[1:54:17] this I see how the holy ghost just bring
[1:54:18] it all back together because cuz you
[1:54:20] know when Jesus ran into her I told you
[1:54:22] that her first life was just dark dark I
[1:54:26] mean and I won't read the quote I don't
[1:54:28] have time to read all this but but
[1:54:29] brother Branham actually speaks of this
[1:54:31] this first time he there's a message
[1:54:33] call when their eyes were open they knew
[1:54:35] him out of Beaumont Texas and man hates
[1:54:38] he calls it her first life was up there
[1:54:39] blackens it could be her first life he
[1:54:42] or she was a ill-fame woman right but
[1:54:45] but I love the way the scripture puts it
[1:54:47] a man I don't care where you are and how
[1:54:52] dirty your life is can I say something
[1:54:55] god no where you at God knows exactly
[1:55:01] where you are
[1:55:04] amen so so so - waiter scripture puts it
[1:55:07] is that you know the Pharisees are
[1:55:09] creating all these problems with Jesus
[1:55:10] in and now they're trying to create a
[1:55:12] disturbance in the church amen
[1:55:16] you know we find that Jesus is actually
[1:55:19] a baptizing more people than John right
[1:55:24] so they're trying to create a sense of
[1:55:25] jealousy in the church and what does
[1:55:29] Jesus do when the spirit of jealousy
[1:55:32] begins to come in Jesus withdrawals
[1:55:35] himself yes so so sometimes if you see a
[1:55:39] spirit of jealousy coming amongst
[1:55:42] brothers or sisters
[1:55:43] hello somebody I'm preaching real good
[1:55:46] right there when you feel the spirit of
[1:55:48] jealousy coming what you gotta do is be
[1:55:50] like Jesus withdrawal yourself amen just
[1:55:55] pull yourself out of the situation look
[1:55:57] let me take some your gift can always
[1:56:00] make room for
[1:56:01] hallelujah you gotta push yourself to do
[1:56:04] nothing God gonna make sure he put you
[1:56:07] in place to do what he told you to do
[1:56:11] but don't fight with Gela spirits just
[1:56:14] went throw yourself so jesus withdraws
[1:56:18] himself in and in the midst of his
[1:56:21] withdrawal the Bible say he had need to
[1:56:24] go by Samaria
[1:56:27] I loved the words he had need to go buy
[1:56:30] some Mary and Jesus whole need was just
[1:56:32] to go visit one person yes can I can I
[1:56:36] can I put it this way one redeemable
[1:56:38] person he was on his way to that Dunkin
[1:56:41] donut the most religious city with the
[1:56:53] most religious people but yet they were
[1:56:57] not redeemable and now he's on his way
[1:57:00] to some city on the side with a woman
[1:57:03] that cannot be identified with everybody
[1:57:06] else but he said I got me to go buy some
[1:57:10] Mary maybe in the vision he see the
[1:57:20] woman there by herself so you have to
[1:57:21] kind of come up with something watch
[1:57:23] I'll go get some vittles sinner
[1:57:25] disciples oh go get some food go dude I
[1:57:28] mean God I mean y'all y'all can't be
[1:57:29] here when when this woman is here right
[1:57:31] so so here he's these there and he's
[1:57:34] waiting and and here she shows up to the
[1:57:36] well it says go get me a drink
[1:57:39] let me give me a drink you say first you
[1:57:42] say now look your people and my people
[1:57:44] yeah we don't even communicate like that
[1:57:46] now you are no better than that

[1:57:50] not exposed to be I have fellowship one

[1:58:03] my water I be well with
[1:58:05] man she probably think these are pickup

[1:58:14] spiritual pickup he said did she say

[2:03:59] the one she said he said the I am he
[2:04:01] that speaks to you that lady dropped a
[2:04:05] water pot took off running went inside
[2:04:08] to sit in for further Branham says that
[2:04:09] this lady even though her life was dark
[2:04:11] to the outward appearance that I her
[2:04:14] life was so dark but on the inside the
[2:04:16] reason he hadn't need to go by some air
[2:04:18] because she was there and once he
[2:04:19] presented the gospel to her just one
[2:04:22] messianic sign one Messiah signed to her
[2:04:25] set her free
[2:04:26] yes so he's went running to the city
[2:04:30] come see a man that has told me first
[2:04:32] she told everybody he told me everything
[2:04:34] I did it's not this the very Messiah one
[2:04:42] one conversation this lady left it's not
[2:04:46] this time aside she didn't call him
[2:04:48] Beelzebub this is Messiah and say she
[2:04:53] said III don't know about the rest of
[2:04:55] y'all I don't gave my life to Him
[2:04:56] but the rest of y'all need to do so much
[2:04:59] all life the whole city had a revival
[2:05:06] yeah one testimony set the whole city on
[2:05:10] fire all right I wish we can just get
[2:05:12] one testimony here
[2:05:14] that's just one of what God did that's
[2:05:16] all God me there's one all God need is
[2:05:18] one yes and there to turn a lot of those
[2:05:21] into yeses oh my god can I just read a
[2:05:24] little bit Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:05:27] my okay
[2:05:31] I want to go to the message the mighty
[2:05:35] God unveiled before us the mighty God
[2:05:38] and veil before us the Prophet makes the
[2:05:42] statement sister God in the beginning
[2:05:44] was life the eternal one in him was
[2:05:48] attributes and those attributes became
[2:05:50] words and the word became flesh Jesus
[2:05:52] was the Redeemer and to redeem means to
[2:05:55] bring back if he has to bring it back it
[2:05:58] had to somewhere it had to be somewhere
[2:06:00] here to be brought back to so you see
[2:06:02] all people all people will never be able
[2:06:05] to see it because all people wasn't in
[2:06:08] the beginning in God's thoughts I don't

[2:10:32] ways you wouldn't need it Google Maps I
[2:10:42] mean with him you wouldn't need it none
[2:10:45] of that you could have been in the
[2:10:48] backwoods of some jungle yeah yeah what
[2:10:52] time to happen like this
[2:10:54] forgive me for the he was he was in
[2:10:58] Africa no man is from Kentucky he's in
[2:11:04] Africa and and in Africa they had a
[2:11:09] little situation I think it was a
[2:11:11] certain disease that if a person got a
[2:11:12] disease if if you if you had the cough
[2:11:16] and maybe the other people in the
[2:11:18] village didn't have a copper Tuesday
[2:11:19] only one with a car and this person
[2:11:21] contact disease they would take your car
[2:11:23] and take that man to the hospital which
[2:11:26] would be days drive to get him to the
[2:11:29] hospital so so you know brother
[2:11:31] branham's Jeremy's witness brother said
[2:11:32] my brother if this if a person had this
[2:11:35] disease you know we'd only ones with

[2:11:47] brought the car back to us they've come
[2:11:49] take the car run take the car and we'll
[2:11:51] be stuck here it says okay you told that
[2:11:52] brother that on one day the very next
[2:11:54] day okay after brother out of hand said
[2:11:57] come come with me went running through
[2:11:59] the bushes in Africa and there was and
[2:12:03] while he running through he said oh can
[2:12:05] I stay right here and the brother
[2:12:06] stopped and when he stops he said he saw
[2:12:08] a group of men carrying a man running
[2:12:12] where they running to to get that truck
[2:12:14] this man was sick so brother banners say
[2:12:17] stop and he said he told a brother lay
[2:12:19] hands on ya and the brother lay hands
[2:12:22] are prate and they still ran and got the
[2:12:25] truck when they got the truck they
[2:12:27] turned around and came back because the
[2:12:28] man was healed
[2:12:32] they would have been stuck for days
[2:12:35] God had a weight of showing him these
[2:12:37] things now with manifestations like this
[2:12:43] in his life yeah
[2:12:45] was this of God of the devil that's why
[2:12:54] if you if you if you if you if a smart
[2:12:56] man like it like Jesus actually was John
[2:13:00] the Baptist from God
[2:13:03] Oh what is this they say what we came
[2:13:05] tailed that's a good answer
[2:13:09] it's better for you to say something
[2:13:11] like that I'll read it in a come again
[2:13:13] scar can I be honest with you you're not
[2:13:19] fighting brother talk about redeemable
[2:13:38] the question is are you redeemable and
[2:13:42] the way you can tell is whether you can
[2:13:43] respond to the were denied let me keep
[2:13:46] reading I'm almost there
[2:13:50] I promise few more things to read and
[2:13:52] I'm I'm a I leave it I thank God for it
[2:13:56] no I think he says but uh can you slide
[2:14:02] up just a little bit
[2:14:03] oh now say look look look at the priests
[2:14:05] there you go right there look at the
[2:14:07] priests when they see him express
[2:14:09] himself express yourself exactly with
[2:14:12] the word what he was they said Espio
[2:14:14] Beelzebub that showed where their nature
[2:14:18] was it was in the modern thought of the
[2:14:20] day but when the little prostitute that
[2:14:22] he met at the gate until her expressed
[2:14:25] his messianic sign by telling her what
[2:14:28] she had done why she said sir I perceive
[2:14:30] it that that you are a prophet
[2:14:32] we know the Messiah when he comes he
[2:14:34] would tell us all these things she was
[2:14:36] recognizing him as Messiah The Anointed
[2:14:37] One
[2:14:38] because he met the scripture
[2:14:39] qualifications that's the thing that's
[2:14:41] what I look at they brother branham meet
[2:14:43] the scripture qualification i'ma tell
[2:14:46] you they can't say yes or no to that to
[2:14:48] what they say is that John the Baptist
[2:14:51] will feel that Malachi 4 John the
[2:14:55] Baptist in at Luke 1 yeah I got you on
[2:14:59] that I know John the Baptist to feel a
[2:15:02] part of it yeah what about this other
[2:15:04] part yes well John that lets say okay
[2:15:07] they say John the Baptist fulfill its
[2:15:09] every so when Jesus said that Elias has
[2:15:13] come I mean the last will come and has
[2:15:16] come already so then he said and there
[2:15:18] was John the Baptist I'll see ya we read
[2:15:19] that too for what about the will come
[2:15:22] the hath come already
[2:15:24] what's John the Baptist but the will
[2:15:26] come is who and not only will come will
[2:15:30] come and restore all things what did
[2:15:35] John the Baptist restore yeah I haven't
[2:15:40] studied that I mean let me just be
[2:15:44] honest with you there is nothing to
[2:15:46] study yeah there's nothing to study
[2:15:50] Jesus knew exactly what he was saying
[2:15:52] yes restore all things all right already
[2:15:56] got so he goes on here in this quote he
[2:15:58] says sir I perceive your prophet we know
[2:16:01] Messiah when he comes to tell us all
[2:16:02] things she was recognizing him as
[2:16:04] Messiah knowing when he met the
[2:16:06] scripture qualifications don't you see
[2:16:07] the two pieces of people were coming
[2:16:09] together see we see we know that when
[2:16:13] the Messiah cometh now God might have
[2:16:16] had to interpret this and that to get
[2:16:19] this certain thing king of the Bell like
[2:16:22] the molder but when Jesus turned said I
[2:16:25] am he that speaks with you there was no
[2:16:27] such no such an expression as Beelzebub
[2:16:30] she left her waterpot ran into the city
[2:16:34] and said come see a man who told me the
[2:16:36] things that I've done
[2:16:37] isn't this the very Messiah see now what
[2:16:40] did this put in the old scripture with
[2:16:42] the experience that Jesus was given to
[2:16:45] her what did it do it may the Messiah
[2:16:47] did you notice quickly her sins were
[2:16:50] forgiven
[2:16:51] because at the beginning she was
[2:16:54] redeemable because she was in God's
[2:16:57] thinking at the beginning so it redeemed
[2:17:00] her or brought her back when she sing
[2:17:04] the expressed scripture manifested of
[2:17:08] Jehovah what he was what he is my god no
[2:17:14] matter how dark her life
[2:17:15] Jesus had need to go by Samaria in order
[2:17:19] to get that lady out of there because
[2:17:20] she was the one in Samaria
[2:17:22] that was redeemable she was a thought of
[2:17:26] God
[2:17:26] a man and if you come from God you're
[2:17:30] going back to God I don't care what
[2:17:32] church you might be in what ball you
[2:17:34] might be in if you're thought of God you
[2:17:36] got to come out you've got to come and
[2:17:41] when this word strikes you it will bring
[2:17:42] you out cuz you ain't gonna hear nothing
[2:17:45] like this nowhere else that's right
[2:17:46] glory to God yeah alright he goes on to
[2:17:49] say this action I have to tell you what
[2:17:51] I'll leave that I'll leave that right
[2:17:53] there
[2:17:53] oh my so let me finish with this last
[2:17:57] quote out of the church age book and I'm
[2:18:00] going to paragraph 152 1 but actually it
[2:18:03] would be a little bit just before that
[2:18:05] it'll be at 1 paragraph before that so
[2:18:06] just type in 150 to 1 and I'll just go
[2:18:09] to the paragraph right before it it'll
[2:18:11] say in very plain language the true
[2:18:15] Bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[2:18:20] eternally though not Express until each
[2:18:23] came forth in their designated decree
[2:18:25] season and this is your season and as
[2:18:28] each member came forth
[2:18:29] it became expressed and took its place
[2:18:31] in the body yeah thus this bride is the
[2:18:35] literal spoken word see Bride and though
[2:18:37] she is feminine and designation she's
[2:18:39] also called the body of Christ it is
[2:18:41] very apparent that she ought to be
[2:18:42] called that for she was predestinated in
[2:18:44] him came from the same source
[2:18:48] was eternal with him and it's now
[2:18:50] manifesting God and a mini member body
[2:18:52] whereas once God was manifested in one
[2:18:54] member even our Lord Jesus Christ it
[2:18:57] goes on says now then here we are coming
[2:19:00] to a conclusion as the eternal logos was
[2:19:03] man
[2:19:03] fest in the Sun and in Jesus what all
[2:19:06] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[2:19:08] and that eternal one was the father
[2:19:10] manifest in the flesh and thereby gain
[2:19:12] the title of son
[2:19:14] even so we eternal in his thoughts and
[2:19:16] our turn became the many members spoken
[2:19:20] word seed manifest in the flesh
[2:19:22] and those eternal thoughts thoughts now
[2:19:25] manifested flesh are the sons of God
[2:19:28] even as we are so called so we can call
[2:19:32] ourselves sons of God and we can call
[2:19:34] ourselves eternal folks of God right he
[2:19:37] says even as we're so called we did not
[2:19:40] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[2:19:45] and therefore were reborn for only the
[2:19:50] lip can be reborn because we were seed
[2:19:55] is the reason we could be quickened hey
[2:19:59] that's the reason you can sit here today
[2:20:01] that's right I mean I'm telling your
[2:20:03] first life no matter how dark it was the
[2:20:06] reason you can come to this message no
[2:20:08] matter how you got here it's because you
[2:20:10] received something there to quicken any
[2:20:14] man listen in non seat there's nothing
[2:20:17] to quicken that's because our holdest
[2:20:20] careful in mind now take the next step
[2:20:22] redeem means to buy buy back it restores
[2:20:26] to the original owner God by his death
[2:20:28] the shed blood brought back his own he
[2:20:31] broked he bought back the spoken word
[2:20:33] Sea Bright my sheep hear my voice word
[2:20:39] so as you listen to the tape you're not
[2:20:41] listening to brother Branham and
[2:20:42] listening to God's voice through his
[2:20:44] prophet my sheep hear my voice word and
[2:20:47] they followed me you always were sheep
[2:20:49] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[2:20:53] into a sheep that is impossible for
[2:20:56] every kind of life produces the same
[2:20:58] kind and there's no change in specie as
[2:21:01] we were in the thoughts of God and then
[2:21:04] expressed in flesh there had to come
[2:21:06] update and I pray today is that day
[2:21:08] there had to come a day when we would
[2:21:11] hear his voice the word
[2:21:13] and hearing that voice become aware of
[2:21:16] our father colors remember I started off
[2:21:19] saying it was an attribute in him to be
[2:21:21] a father in order to be a father he had
[2:21:24] to have some children a man and so you
[2:21:27] have to become aware that dad is calling
[2:21:29] a way of the father called us and
[2:21:31] recognized that we are the sons of God
[2:21:33] we heard his voice and we cried out as
[2:21:36] did the part of the song son save me oh
[2:21:39] my father I am returning to the church
[2:21:46] in order to be redeemable you had to be
[2:21:50] there in God's thoughts before this
[2:21:53] world ever began and you're coming here
[2:21:56] every time you come here it's not a
[2:21:58] mistake every message that you hear from
[2:22:01] this pulpit it's not a mistake all right
[2:22:03] right I mean none of your life has been
[2:22:06] a mistake God has been orchestrating
[2:22:08] every step that you've taken hallelujah

[2:23:24] thought of God we would not be in the
[2:23:26] place we are today there's no way we
[2:23:29] could sit here no matter how dark life
[2:23:31] may be sometimes and God we can we can
