[1:03:47] the disciples of the Lord went into the
[1:03:50] high priest and desired of him letters
[1:03:53] to Damascus to the synagogue's that if
[1:03:57] he found any of this way whether they
[1:04:02] were men or women he might bring them
[1:04:06] bound unto Jerusalem and as he journeyed
[1:04:11] he came near Damascus and suddenly there
[1:04:13] shined around about him a light from
[1:04:16] heaven and he fell to the earth and
[1:04:19] heard a voice saying Saul Saul why
[1:04:23] persecutest me and he said unto thy Lord
[1:04:28] maybe said him and he said who art thou
[1:04:32] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[1:04:37] thou persecute it is hard for thee to
[1:04:42] kick against a pre
[1:04:44] and he trembling and astonished said
[1:04:46] Lord what was our help me to do and the
[1:04:50] Lord said o unto Him arise and go onto
[1:04:55] the city and it shall be told of the
[1:04:57] what we must do

[1:05:46] all kind of prepared amen
[1:05:49] try not to be before you're too long
[1:05:53] amen and reading from a mem I have to
[1:05:59] take my coat off you can't fight with
[1:06:00] your coat on and I feel a fight
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] look at that the scripture here amen
[1:06:18] we see amen in those days there read
[1:06:28] from the scripture there an accident the
[1:06:31] the message of Jesus it wasn't a popular
[1:06:35] message hey man this was a little while
[1:06:39] after the crucifixion and the Jews had
[1:06:41] already committed him over to capital
[1:06:45] punishment and things like that but
[1:06:47] there was a group that had caught the
[1:06:49] message and they was beginning to just
[1:06:51] carry the gospel and things that begin
[1:06:54] the game momentum and we see here that
[1:06:56] the Hebrews and the establishment of
[1:07:00] that day they had a problem with it so
[1:07:04] you would think that in those days Jesus
[1:07:08] when he was thinking of this unpopular
[1:07:11] person who was uneducated by the world
[1:07:15] no school they couldn't find what school
[1:07:18] or what seminary where did he come from
[1:07:21] he didn't have any doctorate degree and
[1:07:23] he wasn't affiliated with any of their
[1:07:25] denomination she wasn't affiliated with
[1:07:27] any of their their teachings and things
[1:07:30] they they just couldn't understand it
[1:07:32] and he say raise up something they date
[1:07:36] they knew his background and said that
[1:07:37] well he was a little illegitimate births
[1:07:42] and he come out preaching the gospel
[1:07:44] contrary to everything that was taught
[1:07:47] at that time amen and so condemning all
[1:07:51] the ministers and their organizations
[1:07:54] and so forth amen
[1:07:56] it just didn't sit well with them and if
[1:07:59] anybody even went to hear him this
[1:08:02] so-called prophet would be put out of
[1:08:06] the synagogue which was a mortal sin and
[1:08:09] that's kind of just like the day you
[1:08:11] know what I mean they Oh what is this
[1:08:13] bangle what are they talking about
[1:08:15] Amen that God sent a prophet and these
[1:08:18] thunders and these seals and all these
[1:08:20] different things so they begin to just
[1:08:23] like they're just like today ridicule
[1:08:25] and and scarf and say all kind of things
[1:08:29] against the Lord thank God and they come
[1:08:32] true to this sacrifice and and and they
[1:08:40] understood this outcast with great
[1:08:43] things amen and this man Christ Jesus
[1:08:48] ignored such as that and yet he was
[1:08:53] perfectly with description now I want to
[1:08:56] slow down and I want to make sure that
[1:08:57] you get that even though they felt this
[1:09:00] way about him they had all these notions
[1:09:02] and feelings and different things about
[1:09:04] him but this man Christ Jesus was
[1:09:08] perfectly with Scripture but they could
[1:09:13] not recognize it because he didn't come
[1:09:16] in the way that they wanted him to come
[1:09:18] he didn't come through their schools he
[1:09:21] didn't come through their synagogues he
[1:09:23] didn't come the way they expected him to
[1:09:26] come amen
[1:09:28] now what side my brothers and sisters
[1:09:32] let me let me back up we see brother
[1:09:37] Brennan brought out a little story at
[1:09:39] one time when he was a kid amen to how
[1:09:42] he was talking about this little boy and
[1:09:45] he went over to his grown my house and
[1:09:48] and and and and in he said at this house
[1:09:50] they never really had mirrors in the
[1:09:52] house and they had one mirror that day
[1:09:54] outside there was a little small thing
[1:09:57] that he said I believe he said he found
[1:09:58] it in the trash from when they tagged it
[1:10:00] up on on a tree and and and the kids
[1:10:03] would I've actually stand up on the
[1:10:04] bucket and kind of trip it so just to be
[1:10:06] able to see their face but he went over
[1:10:09] to his grandmother's house one time and
[1:10:11] she had a full-length mirror on the door
[1:10:15] and and and he began to look into this
[1:10:19] mirror and he see this little boy
[1:10:20] looking back and he looked and he would
[1:10:23] turn his head one way and the little boy
[1:10:26] in the mirror would do the same thing
[1:10:27] and he would make a move and then he
[1:10:30] looked back at his mom and grandma day
[1:10:32] looking at him to see what she's going
[1:10:34] to do about it and and he he finally
[1:10:36] caught the revelation they say mama
[1:10:38] that's me and I will pass the kind of
[1:10:41] preach the real good message Oh neck up
[1:10:44] in Carolina said mama that's me but I
[1:10:48] want to take him in a different
[1:10:49] direction we see that these are
[1:10:52] religious establishment house how they
[1:10:56] didn't recognize what was going on they
[1:10:59] didn't recognize the gospel for the hour
[1:11:01] that they was living in they couldn't
[1:11:04] see it and and what side I wonder I
[1:11:09] wonder what side if we were back in that
[1:11:13] time if we were back in that day what
[1:11:16] side when we have took he says your life
[1:11:19] you live now reflects
[1:11:22] now just what side you would have took
[1:11:25] it reflects just what you would have
[1:11:28] done because you're still are possessed
[1:11:32] of the same spirit they say the spirits
[1:11:35] don't die he said those people died made
[1:11:38] them but those spirits live right on he
[1:11:41] say your life right now
[1:11:43] is reflecting what side you would have
[1:11:46] been on me
[1:11:47] so the devil never takes the spirit it
[1:11:50] just goes off from one man to another
[1:11:52] and God never takes his spirit it just
[1:11:56] goes from one to another so the very
[1:11:59] spirit of Elijah came upon a life show
[1:12:02] the same one adjourn of the same one on
[1:12:06] John the Baptist and so forth
[1:12:08] the Holy Spirit came upon Christ and
[1:12:11] then upon the disciples and all down is
[1:12:14] still upon two people today see God
[1:12:16] never takes his spirit so we are left to
[1:12:20] make a choice what choice what choice we
[1:12:26] make now the same Trust we would have
[1:12:29] made then we're just looking at a
[1:12:31] reflection amen and if you want to see a
[1:12:35] manual reflection the word of man is a
[1:12:38] reflection of what choice you would have
[1:12:40] made are you learning up with the word
[1:12:42] today it is just a side whichever way
[1:12:45] the tree leaned it is the way it falls
[1:12:48] but trouble wait a tree leaning amen now
[1:12:51] I want us to go and look at the
[1:12:53] scripture here if we take our bibles or
[1:12:56] put up to Genesis the third you can
[1:12:58] either follow in your Bibles or follow
[1:13:00] along on the screen amen we're gonna go
[1:13:02] to Genesis there's a third chapter a man
[1:13:07] if you just bear with me while I build
[1:13:08] its platform amen
[1:13:11] I believe we're going to see some see
[1:13:14] some things this morning
[1:13:16] amen glory to God
[1:13:24] I glow over the guy
[1:13:30] we'll take from the third chapter the
[1:13:33] first verse amen now the serpent was the
[1:13:37] most subtle than any beast of the field
[1:13:41] which the Lord that God had made and he
[1:13:44] said unto the woman yea hath God said ye
[1:13:48] shall not eat of every tree in the
[1:13:52] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:13:55] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:14:00] trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:14:04] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:14:07] garden God has said ye shall ye not you
[1:14:11] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:14:17] touch it you shall not eat it neither
[1:14:24] shall ye touch it
[1:14:26] he don't even want you to go over there
[1:14:29] and sit under that tree
[1:14:31] don't go over there playing around the
[1:14:34] tree no go over the climbing the tree
[1:14:39] stay away from that tree but we find the
[1:14:45] day and I'm gonna believe that
[1:14:47] scriptures have compound meaning a man
[1:14:51] about a and we look at Genesis here oh
[1:14:55] it's in silver form we're not talking
[1:14:59] about a literal tree we're not talking
[1:15:02] about a literal tree amen but he said
[1:15:06] you not only do you not eat the fruit
[1:15:09] don't even touch it stay the problem
[1:15:13] with Eve is that since she had she had
[1:15:17] somebody that she was supposed to be
[1:15:20] listening to now she
[1:15:24] um with her amen
[1:15:29] to be able to rightly divide the word of
[1:15:31] truth that would have been one thing but
[1:15:33] she all know that distri having Bible
[1:15:37] study confident that she's able to
[1:15:42] withstand whatever oh this man can throw
[1:15:46] it but she didn't realize so she were
[1:15:49] dealing with this old Greece and fellow
[1:15:52] was sleep and he took her all the way
[1:15:55] through the scripture and change one
[1:15:57] word and she was deceived
[1:16:03] she was trace but he told her don't even
[1:16:08] go over there
[1:16:09] don't even touch it don't sing in the
[1:16:14] choir
[1:16:15] don't be only that would make soup
[1:16:17] samples don't be gone today programs
[1:16:20] stay away from me it's dangerous amen
[1:16:30] glory to God
[1:16:36] amen thank you lord
[1:16:39] so he said he said I'll stay away from
[1:16:42] that tree and we read on down here that
[1:16:45] uh the woman isn't serving at all we may
[1:16:52] eat a tree in the field but in the troop
[1:16:53] the tree in the midst of the garden has
[1:16:56] he said don't eat ye shall not eat of it
[1:17:00] neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[1:17:02] now I want you to brother bring out one
[1:17:04] thing at this time what he leased you
[1:17:08] down before them God had created the
[1:17:13] heaven created the earth all of the
[1:17:16] trees all of these all of these
[1:17:19] different things and the Prophet brought
[1:17:23] out that they was at this time they were
[1:17:25] still in eternity he said unless you die
[1:17:29] so the clock didn't start ticking until
[1:17:34] they transgressed now I want you to
[1:17:38] bring that up until they transgress then
[1:17:41] death set into the body amen the serpent
[1:17:45] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:17:47] die
[1:17:47] see how he's the life God said list you
[1:17:51] doc he said ye shall not surely die he's
[1:17:55] trying to interpret scripture amen
[1:17:58] so for God to his know that the day that
[1:18:02] you eat thereof see listen that what he
[1:18:05] said then your eyes shall be open that
[1:18:09] was not a lie that was not a lot that
[1:18:13] was very true see he give you look truth
[1:18:17] next with a laugh
[1:18:20] and it told you off the whole program of
[1:18:23] God say stay away from over there
[1:18:26] any man so we read on it he says here
[1:18:31] your eyes shall be opened and ye shall
[1:18:34] be as God's knowing good and evil
[1:18:40] you always have somebody telling you
[1:18:43] something and you say I wish you hadn't
[1:18:45] told me that
[1:18:46] I didn't I really didn't want to know I
[1:18:49] was better off not knowing and now I got
[1:18:52] to deal with this now I got to carry you
[1:18:55] see and off not knowing my brothers I
[1:18:57] didn't know everything just believe the
[1:19:01] word and go on amen you see somebody
[1:19:04] it's best you not know good pray leave
[1:19:08] it alone it's best you not know cuz
[1:19:11] everybody can't handle everything
[1:19:14] amen and when the woman saw that the
[1:19:18] tree was good for food and that it was
[1:19:22] pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be
[1:19:28] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:19:32] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[1:19:35] unto her husband with her and he did he
[1:19:40] and the eyes of them both were opened
[1:19:45] and they knew that they would make oh my
[1:19:50] so they show our fig leaves together and
[1:19:54] made themselves aprons and they heard a
[1:19:58] voice of the Lord walking in the garden
[1:20:02] in the cool of the day and usually Adam
[1:20:06] would meet the Lord there at that place
[1:20:09] it meant because they had fellowship in
[1:20:12] the cool of the evening but this time
[1:20:14] where were you Adam he had to call out
[1:20:17] for Adam and away you
[1:20:20] where right now and when Adam Beauty
[1:20:23] leaves put on them
[1:20:27] I imagine maybe later after they had ate
[1:20:29] the fruit
[1:20:30] he might've did and I don't matter they
[1:20:35] realized that they had done something
[1:20:37] wrong
[1:20:38] you see when they was in that garden and
[1:20:41] that everything was perfect it was a
[1:20:45] perfect atmosphere it was a you had had
[1:20:49] everything they had needles there were
[1:20:53] no stress now we see that after the
[1:20:57] transgression all of a sudden they
[1:20:59] started feeling things like that never
[1:21:01] felt before
[1:21:03] obviously self fear they felt pressure
[1:21:10] one of the most damaging things to the
[1:21:13] human body is fear and precious it'll
[1:21:18] age you quicker than anything fear and
[1:21:23] pressure death has said into the body
[1:21:28] they had began to feel feelings like
[1:21:31] that never felt before what is this what
[1:21:33] have we done oh my what have we done
[1:21:37] sort of God came and said what does his
[1:21:41] leave who told you you was naked he
[1:21:46] already knew at that point what hadn't
[1:21:48] happened they began to play the blame
[1:21:51] game and he heard the voice and the Lord
[1:21:58] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:22:00] day and Adam and his wife saw and the
[1:22:04] cool walking in the garden in the cool
[1:22:07] of the day and Adam and his wife hid
[1:22:10] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:22:14] oh my
[1:22:17] isn't that something why would you hide
[1:22:20] yourself from the presence of the law
[1:22:22] but you know probably Saturday night
[1:22:24] just like us a day we do something wrong
[1:22:26] and the first thing we do they stop
[1:22:27] coming to church doing the same thing we
[1:22:31] hide our self from the presence of the
[1:22:33] Lord amen and uh amongst the trees of
[1:22:41] the garden and the Lord God called unto
[1:22:43] Adam and said unto Him where art thou
[1:22:48] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:22:51] garden and I was afraid see I was a free
[1:22:56] you ain't never feared before all of a
[1:22:59] sudden now you're feeling fear I was
[1:23:02] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[1:23:09] myself and he said who told me that God
[1:23:12] was naked have you eaten of the tree
[1:23:15] where for I commanded thee that thou
[1:23:18] should not eat and the man said the
[1:23:23] woman that thou gave us me to be with me
[1:23:27] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:23:31] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:23:35] what is this what is this doll have done
[1:23:41] and the woman said to me she said the
[1:23:45] serpent beguiled me and I did eat I told
[1:23:49] you not to even touch it oh my but the
[1:23:56] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:23:58] thou has done this thou art cursed above
[1:24:02] all cattle and every beast of the
[1:24:05] feeling upon thy belly thou shalt go and
[1:24:09] the dust shall be the dust shalt thou
[1:24:13] eat all the days of thy life amen and I
[1:24:18] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:24:21] woman between thy seed and her seed
[1:24:24] and not your bruise thy head and thou
[1:24:27] shalt bruise his heel and we're gonna go
[1:24:31] back to that we're gonna get in there a
[1:24:32] little bit deeper a little bit but I
[1:24:34] want you to we're gonna go on to the
[1:24:37] 16th unto the woman he said he will
[1:24:40] greatly multiply thy sorrow and in that
[1:24:44] conception in sorrow thou shalt bring
[1:24:48] forth children and the desire shall be
[1:24:52] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[1:24:54] thee and unto Adam he said because thou
[1:25:01] has hearkened unto the voice of that
[1:25:03] wife and has eaten of the tree which I
[1:25:08] commanded thee not that I commanded thee
[1:25:12] saying thou shalt not eat of it you
[1:25:16] notice he didn't curse Adam he said I
[1:25:20] curse the ground for thy sake remember
[1:25:25] this my brother's he said I cursed the
[1:25:28] ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou
[1:25:33] eat of it all the days of thy life
[1:25:38] thorns and also thistles shall bring
[1:25:42] forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
[1:25:45] herb of the field and the sweat of thy
[1:25:49] face shalt thou eat bread till the
[1:25:52] return until until till thou return unto
[1:25:58] the ground until yeah in all days of
[1:26:01] your life until thou return to the
[1:26:03] ground for out of it was doubt taken for

[1:27:55] perfect everything was in perfect
[1:27:59] condition then when he went to take a
[1:28:04] little rest his enemies left him with
[1:28:07] deceit and took over by misrepresenting
[1:28:10] his program to his children oh my what a
[1:28:16] tire my brothers and sisters amen you
[1:28:19] could take that down thank you
[1:28:21] amen so we see that the enemy of God
[1:28:24] slipped in and misinterpreted the word
[1:28:26] to eat but this fall it had took over to
[1:28:30] possess the garden himself he took over
[1:28:35] gardener it took over a passage to the
[1:28:40] Garden of Eden himself he took it over
[1:28:43] and now he had 6,000 years of this seat
[1:28:49] for rule deceiving the people God's
[1:28:52] children as he did then because they
[1:28:56] were based on free moral agency to act
[1:28:59] any way they wish to and believing that
[1:29:02] they would act right he trusted they
[1:29:05] would act right and they come with a
[1:29:07] wrong and sold their birth rights as
[1:29:10] Esau did for the world and Satan won it
[1:29:15] and he took it over and he had 6,000
[1:29:19] years a man to build his even his
[1:29:24] kingdom
[1:29:25] a man so my brothers and sisters I would
[1:29:28] like to just say Amen
[1:29:30] today we're living in the most deceitful
[1:29:35] time ever amen we're living right in the
[1:29:40] in the in the midst of Satan's garden
[1:29:43] we're living right in the midst of Satan
[1:29:46] Eden just like I said we go out on our
[1:29:49] daily tasks and we rub shoulders with
[1:29:51] the world every day it is the most
[1:29:53] cunning and deceitful time ever in
[1:29:56] history the Christian today has to be
[1:30:00] more on his toes than any other age the
[1:30:04] countenance of the devil now makes
[1:30:06] people believe that they're Christians
[1:30:08] when they're not amen Matthew 24 says it
[1:30:15] would be so close that it would deceive
[1:30:17] the very elect if it was possible I'll
[1:30:21] show you why it's not possible a man as
[1:30:24] we move on Timothy that Secretariat to
[1:30:27] the church up a meal would be heady
[1:30:28] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:30:32] lovers of
[1:30:33] god trucebreakers false accusers
[1:30:36] incontinent despisers of those that are
[1:30:41] good my brothers and sisters incontinent
[1:30:44] means unable to control one sexual
[1:30:47] desires but does that describe the world
[1:30:52] that we live in in the day a man that
[1:30:56] all right amen
[1:31:00] we'll move on and trying to keep my
[1:31:02] notes here kind of organized and we see
[1:31:07] brother Branham was out one day and he
[1:31:12] was sitting on a law 5912 19 sister
[1:31:21] question and answer on the Holy Ghost
[1:31:33] paragraph 191 and you can go there and
[1:31:39] we'll start from there
[1:31:41] hey man yes and he went out there in the
[1:31:48] law and the logs still laying there was
[1:31:50] was on here in the tree not long ago
[1:31:54] laying there was on a tree not long ago
[1:31:57] down off the mountain and lays across a
[1:32:00] little path and it comes around from the
[1:32:03] creek and I was just straddling the law
[1:32:05] looking across the mountains they met
[1:32:08] much like I was a couple of weeks ago it
[1:32:12] made way back there and laid my Bible
[1:32:15] out like that I saw you know I was
[1:32:21] thinking on the scripture the
[1:32:24] coppersmith he had done much he had done
[1:32:28] me much harm and said things you know I
[1:32:32] thought I believed I just read that I
[1:32:36] opened my Bible I said well I wiped my
[1:32:39] face off and the wind blew it and it
[1:32:42] turned over to Hebrews 6 well I said
[1:32:46] that's that's not where it's at so I
[1:32:50] laid it back like this and the wind blew
[1:32:54] it open and turned it back again and I
[1:32:57] said now that strange the wind blowing
[1:33:01] it like that so I thought well I believe
[1:33:04] I read it and it said for it is
[1:33:07] impossible for those who which were once
[1:33:11] enlightened and made partakers of the
[1:33:15] Holy Ghost and taste
[1:33:17] the Word of God and the things of the
[1:33:20] world to come
[1:33:22] I thought well I don't see nothing in
[1:33:25] that I'll read it all down and the rest
[1:33:30] of the chapter nothing in it I said well
[1:33:34] this settles that for me I saw it like
[1:33:38] this and back it went again and I picked
[1:33:43] it up and I thought well what is that
[1:33:46] he says I kept reading and I kept
[1:33:50] reading and why I says I can't
[1:33:52] understand
[1:33:53] I read all down and I read oh damn is
[1:33:59] impossible for those which are once
[1:34:02] enlightened it come on down to a place
[1:34:05] where it said and the Earth's drink is
[1:34:08] the rain that come off upon it to bring
[1:34:13] forth herbs meat to them by whom it is
[1:34:17] dressed receiveth blessings from God but
[1:34:21] that which bears thorns and briers is
[1:34:24] rejected and Nile to the cursings whom
[1:34:27] judgment is to be burned he says I
[1:34:31] wonder what that means I now was
[1:34:34] thinking about nothing up there just
[1:34:37] stinking and just in as I was sitting
[1:34:40] there I thought Lord you give me a
[1:34:43] vision about brother Davis and them down
[1:34:46] there and I was sitting there and I look
[1:34:49] and I said something begin turning
[1:34:52] across the hollow in front of me
[1:34:55] anything and it was a world a world
[1:35:00] turning and I seen it it all broke I
[1:35:05] seen it was all broke up he's talking
[1:35:09] about the world it was all broke up just
[1:35:12] look like was all plowed over and a man
[1:35:16] went forth with a great big thing in
[1:35:20] front of him full of seeds and was
[1:35:24] casting seeds all the way down the earth
[1:35:27] and he went and and he went and he went
[1:35:30] around the curvature of the earth and he
[1:35:32] went out of my sight and soon as he went
[1:35:36] out of my sight here comes a real sneaky
[1:35:39] fellow looking dressed in black garments
[1:35:43] going around like this going
[1:35:48] whoo-whoo-whoo
[1:35:49] they meant throwing seeds and I watched
[1:35:53] it as their earth kept turning after a
[1:35:57] while come up and when the week come up
[1:36:01] out of the week come briars come thorns
[1:36:07] come thistles this was throwing
[1:36:11] stinkweed everything growing up
[1:36:14] milkweed everything growing up in the
[1:36:18] week and they was all growing up
[1:36:21] together then a real bad drought came
[1:36:24] along and it had his head hung over and
[1:36:27] the pryzen sisters had their heads hung
[1:36:29] over each we just panting for breath
[1:36:33] breathing like that you could just hear
[1:36:36] them and they call for rain just while
[1:36:40] along came a great big cloud of water
[1:36:43] just gush down and when they fell upon
[1:36:46] the wheat jumped up and begin to howl
[1:36:49] glory hallelujah praise our Lord and he
[1:36:53] jumped up in the stinkweed harlot praise
[1:36:55] the Lord and the thorns and thistles
[1:36:58] dancing all around over the field
[1:37:01] hollering glory hallelujah praise the
[1:37:04] Lord
[1:37:05] well I see it I can't forget that and
[1:37:08] the vision left me and I fell back again
[1:37:11] in the briars which were nigh unto
[1:37:13] rejection then I got it
[1:37:15] jesus said the rain falling on the just
[1:37:18] and the unjust and a man a man can set
[1:37:22] in the meetings a man and speak with
[1:37:26] tongues a man and shout and I just like
[1:37:31] the rest of them with the genuine Holy
[1:37:34] Ghost and still not be in the kingdom
[1:37:36] and still not be in the kingdom
[1:37:40] he didn't say of false Holy Ghost
[1:37:43] he didn't say a faucet anointing he said
[1:37:46] the Ginuwine Holy Ghost and still not
[1:37:52] being the king amen you can come and
[1:37:57] feel it on your flesh and feel good
[1:38:01] amen and you can come and be sanctified
[1:38:04] and justified but if you don't get it on
[1:38:07] the inside it does you no good it has to
[1:38:12] be an inside job you have to go all the
[1:38:16] way with God it's not good enough to say
[1:38:18] well I've been to church and then and
[1:38:21] and you go through the motions Amen
[1:38:24] sometimes some of them it's a condition
[1:38:26] of the heart
[1:38:29] amen we're going to get into that amen
[1:38:35] it's a condition of the heart my
[1:38:37] brothers and sisters there's not a
[1:38:39] person here that want to be in torment
[1:38:42] there's nobody and don't drive hundreds
[1:38:45] of miles over the icy roads to spend
[1:38:47] you're living in your money just to come
[1:38:49] to church here to well say shake hands
[1:38:53] with people although you love to do that
[1:38:56] and hear the pastor you although you
[1:38:58] love to do that and to hear the pastor
[1:39:01] and myself and other ministers speak the
[1:39:04] word you get that wherever you are
[1:39:09] pastors ministers just like we are
[1:39:12] servants of Christ but there's something
[1:39:15] that draws you here to this particular
[1:39:19] place therefore it's the duty of the
[1:39:23] pastor's to see that your flock is fed
[1:39:27] amen the right food amen because
[1:39:31] Almighty God's required your blood on
[1:39:34] our hands at the Day of Judgment will be
[1:39:37] answered will answer for you so seeing
[1:39:41] this great tremendous responsibility
[1:39:43] that that takes place upon us and God
[1:39:46] has given us this given us people who
[1:39:49] love us and come here a man that went
[1:39:53] should spend our time constantly
[1:39:56] watching for their souls when the first
[1:40:00] thing we see raising up not right it's
[1:40:03] our duty to come to that person because
[1:40:07] we are Shepherds watching the sheep a
[1:40:11] man the sheep eating we that would kill
[1:40:15] it
[1:40:16] I'd better drive it away I better jerk
[1:40:18] it back stop
[1:40:20] don't eat that hey man stay away from
[1:40:23] that
[1:40:23] don't even touch it don't even touch it
[1:40:28] hey man cuz he's a shepherd over your
[1:40:31] soul amen
[1:40:33] there's no Nina he said there's no Nover
[1:40:35] in the Western countries a we that an
[1:40:38] animal can eat and it's called loco we
[1:40:42] don't know whether anybody has ever
[1:40:45] heard of it or not is a local week a
[1:40:48] horse would eat it and you just can't
[1:40:51] can't do nothing with him after that
[1:40:53] oh mama slow down on that right there
[1:40:56] this local weed he says the horse can
[1:41:00] eat it and you just can't do nothing
[1:41:03] with him after that amen he just becomes
[1:41:08] an outlaw you can't put a saddle on him
[1:41:12] you can't do nothing with him it's
[1:41:15] called
[1:41:16] luckily and you must keep your stock you
[1:41:20] must keep your flock away from that
[1:41:23] local weed and if it'll cause of course
[1:41:28] to eat something if a horse rather it'll
[1:41:32] eat something that throws them into this
[1:41:34] condition into spasms why you would be a
[1:41:38] very poor cowboy to let your horse eat
[1:41:40] that local weed it shows that you don't
[1:41:43] care and a real pastor and real servant
[1:41:47] of Christ would be a poor example of
[1:41:50] Christ to see sheep eating something
[1:41:52] that's going to drive them away make him
[1:41:56] an outlaw
[1:41:57] before God a breaker of his word a
[1:42:01] breaker of his Commandments
[1:42:04] you shouldn't do that you should watch
[1:42:07] very closely amen
[1:42:10] that's why my brothers and sisters we
[1:42:13] have to have shepherds because there's a
[1:42:16] lot a lot of a lot of wheat a lot of
[1:42:19] local weed out there amen and he has a
[1:42:22] define fold ministry is for the
[1:42:25] perfecting of the saints hey man
[1:42:27] remember back it he said don't even
[1:42:30] Jesus God was the great shepherd of that
[1:42:33] out and he had totally said stay away
[1:42:36] from everything else you can eat don't
[1:42:40] even eat it
[1:42:41] don't even touch it stay away from it
[1:42:45] and he plays Shepherd a man passes men
[1:42:49] of God that watch over your soul II see
[1:42:51] you getting there something that you
[1:42:53] should let's go to dishonor hurt you
[1:42:55] Chuck's it away from you it might seem
[1:42:57] hard but he's trying to save your life
[1:43:00] don't even touch it stay away from it
[1:43:04] amen that is the order of God hey man we
[1:43:08] go on we were circumcised they're
[1:43:16] circumcised they went right over into
[1:43:19] the land of promise he's talking about
[1:43:22] other children of Israel amen when they
[1:43:25] were delivered out of Egypt he'll walk
[1:43:28] right up to the baptism of the holy
[1:43:30] ghost and rejected amen he wants to eat
[1:43:33] he won't to give it up
[1:43:36] he'll walk right to the scripture of
[1:43:40] baptizing in Jesus name in turn BAE amen
[1:43:44] we have to go all the way but we wonder
[1:43:47] we said we see all of these thorns and
[1:43:51] thistles and local weed and state weed
[1:43:55] and all of these things say how how
[1:43:57] shall we know they will know them by the
[1:44:00] fruits that they bear you'll know about
[1:44:04] a frisson know about a life that they
[1:44:06] live now listen let me tell you
[1:44:08] something I don't want to get ahead of
[1:44:11] myself
[1:44:11] I'll hold off on that he says you'll
[1:44:14] know them by that
[1:44:16] long suffering you'll know them buddy
[1:44:18] got their goodness they'll miss meekness
[1:44:21] their gentleness their patience and by
[1:44:26] the Holy Ghost don't you take some kind
[1:44:31] of noise don't you take some kind of
[1:44:34] sensation you wait right there until God
[1:44:38] has molded you and made you a new
[1:44:42] creature amen
[1:44:46] now moving on we see that predestinated
[1:44:52] plan and view just another study as
[1:44:57] other see the Word of God is a see a man
[1:45:02] and it must have a ground prepared it
[1:45:10] must have a ground prepared beforehand
[1:45:13] if you sow seed just throw it out there
[1:45:16] into the ground it would do no good
[1:45:19] he said birds will pick it up you throw
[1:45:23] it among stars and thistles in a choke
[1:45:25] it out and soon Jesus the parable says
[1:45:30] so the ground has to be made ready first
[1:45:34] so God in His sovereignty
[1:45:37] prepares the heart first he prepared you
[1:45:42] before the foundation of the world to
[1:45:45] receive him in this age he foreknew you
[1:45:49] by foreknowledge and ordained you to
[1:45:52] eternal life
[1:45:53] he knew you the reason you staggered out
[1:45:56] of the things that you were in and
[1:45:58] staggered into here this morning because
[1:46:01] he knew you and he had prepared your
[1:46:04] heart to receive see he meant much like
[1:46:07] we go back to Paul we look at Paul Paul
[1:46:11] had orders in his hand any man to go
[1:46:14] down to Damascus and put a stop to the
[1:46:18] things that was going on down there he
[1:46:20] had orders to put them in Chains and
[1:46:23] bind him up amen but on the way Paul
[1:46:28] to the sanhedrin court I met him
[1:46:34] fine man by the name of Steven there
[1:46:36] they was they was getting ready to lock
[1:46:41] him up any men but Stephen had other
[1:46:44] things he let him know exactly what he
[1:46:47] thought about it he let him know exactly
[1:46:49] where he stood he said all you stiff
[1:46:52] neck uncircumcised of heart he gave him
[1:46:57] the business and they got so upset with
[1:47:00] with Stephen
[1:47:02] Paul so gave order to kill him they took
[1:47:09] him outside the city and they picked up
[1:47:11] Robson they laid the coats at his feet
[1:47:13] and so looking at this and they they
[1:47:17] they they throw in the stalls and they
[1:47:20] bash the Prophet said they bashed his
[1:47:22] brains out and all why this was going on
[1:47:26] that great warrior Stephen held his
[1:47:29] hands up and gave God praise and the
[1:47:34] Prophet said the Lord rocked him to
[1:47:36] sleep he never felt the one just rocked
[1:47:40] in the sleeves amen
[1:47:44] Paul watching this no doubt it had an
[1:47:50] effect on him no doubt much like the
[1:47:54] prophets old friend Bert that SERPs are
[1:47:57] that mother deer standing there in the
[1:47:59] sight of that gunfire ready to G said
[1:48:01] yet from that distance he could have
[1:48:03] blew her heart plumb up out of her chest
[1:48:05] he didn't care
[1:48:07] heard her doe he was coming for her
[1:48:12] child
[1:48:12] a man so Bert saw something real no
[1:48:16] doubt Paul looking at this and seeing
[1:48:18] how this man stood for Amy and he gave
[1:48:20] His life for did he saw something that
[1:48:22] break his heart
[1:48:26] what was it doing preparing ground who
[1:48:31] was preparing the ground so Saul and the
[1:48:34] two soldiers went on to me they they got
[1:48:37] on their horse and they begin to go over
[1:48:42] and we see that they come to the road
[1:48:46] and he said about 11 o'clock in the
[1:48:50] daytime the Sun is almost directly
[1:48:53] overhead at that time but a great light
[1:48:55] surrounded him and he said Paul knocked
[1:49:00] him off of his horse he couldn't not
[1:49:02] other two soldiers didn't see a thing
[1:49:05] and he said Lord let me let me make sure
[1:49:08] I get all of this right
[1:49:10] amen amen cuz we're going somewhere my
[1:49:13] brothers and sisters a man you love the
[1:49:16] Lord a man he was on the road to
[1:49:22] Damascus streaking down and he heard a
[1:49:24] voice saying Saul why persecutest me and
[1:49:29] he looked up and looking up being a Jew
[1:49:32] he knew that the pillar of fire was it
[1:49:35] was the Lord that led the children of
[1:49:36] Israel he noticed because he was
[1:49:40] remember he was a very educated study of
[1:49:44] description
[1:49:46] remember this Hebrew is Hebrew he would
[1:49:49] have never called anything Lord capital
[1:49:53] o lor D Elohim unless he had been
[1:49:56] satisfied that what he was that what it
[1:50:00] was because he was too trained a scholar
[1:50:03] and when he looked up he seen this light
[1:50:08] this pillar of fire that had led his
[1:50:14] people through the wilderness and he
[1:50:16] said Lord who are you and what a
[1:50:21] surprise it must have been to this great
[1:50:24] theologian to say I'm Jesus
[1:50:26] the very one that you are against what a
[1:50:31] turnaround he said it must have been
[1:50:33] something terrific to this man that all
[1:50:35] of his ambitions that he had to find out
[1:50:38] all at once that he had been persecuting
[1:50:42] his ambitious drove him drove him father
[1:50:47] away from the main thing that he meant
[1:50:50] to do oh what a time my brothers and
[1:50:53] sisters amen
[1:50:56] I hope we're looking in the mirror this
[1:50:57] morning and when a great shock must have
[1:51:00] come upon it for this apostle when he
[1:51:03] said I'm Jesus the very one that you're
[1:51:06] persecuted why Paul why do you persecute
[1:51:10] me another quotation we might drop in
[1:51:14] here you see he said the churches would
[1:51:17] make they make fun of the churches
[1:51:20] they're not really making fun of the
[1:51:22] church they're not really making fun of
[1:51:24] you they're making fun of Jesus why
[1:51:27] persecutest thou me
[1:51:32] how could Paul then so intellect all is
[1:51:37] intellect all is education believe that
[1:51:40] this was that this group he was
[1:51:44] persecuting was the very God that he
[1:51:47] claimed to be serving my god think of
[1:51:53] that my brothers and sisters without
[1:51:54] going into details I think we're all
[1:51:57] well trained enough to know what I mean
[1:51:59] here the same thing is happening today
[1:52:03] Paul through ignorance to see trickery
[1:52:10] of the enemy yet he was intelligent
[1:52:14] smart those uneducated Galileans that he
[1:52:20] was persecuted had already in their
[1:52:23] humility accepted this man as Lord but
[1:52:28] Paul and his great teachings and
[1:52:30] insulated could not accept it oh my I
[1:52:35] wonder how Paul fell because he knew
[1:52:38] that he had seen something real and
[1:52:40] Steven he had seen God on the scene and
[1:52:44] now God was talking to him
[1:52:48] God knew his name he couldn't see but he
[1:52:56] heard the voice I said Paul why do you
[1:52:59] persecute me Lord who are you I'm Jesus
[1:53:07] oh my I can only imagine the terror that
[1:53:12] gripped his heart have I crossed the
[1:53:14] line
[1:53:16] what am I to do Lord I didn't know but
[1:53:23] God knew his name Saul heard his voice
[1:53:30] hey man I just want to say he knows your
[1:53:33] name this morning
[1:53:35] can you hear his voice as young heart
[1:53:38] being prepared to receive the Word of
[1:53:41] God amen let's go on any man it must
[1:53:50] have been for Paul something for Paul to
[1:53:51] see as strained as she was a vice versa
[1:53:56] educated now he knew that he had had an
[1:54:01] experience so there's a good lesson
[1:54:05] experienced alone isn't enough
[1:54:08] it's got to be experienced according to
[1:54:12] the Word of God amen
[1:54:15] now
[1:54:26] a man pray for the Saints amen
[1:54:37] pick up where I left off here but now he
[1:54:40] had heard the gospel of faith come
[1:54:42] hearing the revelation this little
[1:54:45] something inside of you another man
[1:54:47] sitting right by you may not hear I
[1:54:52] don't believe such nonsense let me go
[1:54:57] back a man
[1:55:03] now here predestinated plan and view God
[1:55:09] to see must have been in a prepared
[1:55:11] ground if you so see just throw it out
[1:55:14] there on the ground it would be no good
[1:55:16] that birds will pick it up thorns and
[1:55:18] thistles will choke it out so the ground
[1:55:21] has to be made ready God in His
[1:55:24] sovereignty race prepares the heart
[1:55:27] first he prepared you before the
[1:55:29] foundation of the world to receive him
[1:55:31] at this age he foreknew you by his
[1:55:33] foreknowledge amen and the place where
[1:55:37] he had ordained for you now you've heard
[1:55:42] the gospel and faith come by here just
[1:55:46] like Paul revelation comes by hearing
[1:55:48] there's a little something inside of you
[1:55:51] another man setting right there say oh I
[1:55:54] don't believe such nonsense I don't
[1:55:57] believe that nothing to it like they did
[1:56:02] on the day of Pentecost they laughed at
[1:56:04] these men they say they're full of new
[1:56:05] wine they know that that was a great
[1:56:08] thing that those they know it was it was
[1:56:12] a great thing to those it was happening
[1:56:15] to Wow
[1:56:16] it was God revealing himself to the
[1:56:18] individual the others left these were
[1:56:23] rejoicing than the individual revelation
[1:56:26] which is faith faith that's revealed and
[1:56:32] if it wasn't faith it wouldn't even have
[1:56:35] been there just seed has to have the
[1:56:39] right prepared ground first therefore
[1:56:41] all he foreknew all he called all he
[1:56:45] called he foreknew all he predestinated
[1:56:48] if you want to read it it's over in
[1:56:50] Romans now that's the trouble today so
[1:56:54] much difference that the Christian of
[1:56:56] old when the real true revelation of
[1:56:58] Jesus Christ being Emmanuel dwelled in a
[1:57:02] revelation of Jesus being Emmanuel dwell
[1:57:04] in the hearts of those men they will
[1:57:09] rugged people but today we want to be
[1:57:13] patted
[1:57:14] and taking care of let me go through
[1:57:18] that again the real true revelation of
[1:57:21] Jesus Christ being Emmanuel dwell in the
[1:57:27] hearts of those men made them rugged
[1:57:31] people in other words that's us I don't
[1:57:34] care how tough it is I don't care what I
[1:57:36] may have to go through I don't care the
[1:57:38] trial I don't care the tribulations I
[1:57:40] realize that what we're certainly gonna
[1:57:43] give us over into a better ladies I
[1:57:45] realized that this is going to take us
[1:57:47] home I realize that yet we might suffer
[1:57:50] for a little while there's joy in the
[1:57:52] morning-time
[1:57:53] it has to be a personal revelations amen
[1:58:00] so I can see these going back to Genesis
[1:58:05] they're speaking of Adam prophet says I
[1:58:11] can see this great space being moved
[1:58:14] together like this coming down to a
[1:58:19] funnel shape and it moves right down and
[1:58:22] he began to eyes that little cup looking
[1:58:27] like the Father he began to eye that
[1:58:30] little cup going down through the garden
[1:58:36] bloody skins flump it against her leg he
[1:58:41] couldn't stand it moved on down to the
[1:58:47] very heart of God now I want you to stay
[1:58:51] with me here it moved down to his heart
[1:58:54] he saw his children amen
[1:58:58] what they have done and what they were
[1:59:00] getting ready to go through and it moved
[1:59:03] on his heart God so loved he just
[1:59:08] couldn't see him go through that he
[1:59:11] called him back I'm going to put enmity
[1:59:15] between your seed and same seed and then
[1:59:18] when it's done at Calvary when God
[1:59:21] Himself came down through a woman born
[1:59:24] of
[1:59:26] how I could he said how could I just
[1:59:29] deal with that forward a little bit
[1:59:30] notice when they were treatment from the
[1:59:34] God and because of transgressions all
[1:59:36] the blessings of God was cut off because
[1:59:40] of the transgression I think tonight
[1:59:43] that that's what's the matter with the
[1:59:45] church all the blessings are cut off
[1:59:48] because of transgressions amen the
[1:59:53] Prophet said I used to think that God
[1:59:56] was angry with me I used to think he was
[1:59:59] angry with me but Christ loved me and I
[2:00:05] come to find out that Christ is the very
[2:00:07] heart of God he is the very heart of God
[2:00:11] Christ being God's heart now love
[2:00:15] overcome love love hide sins or get rid
[2:00:21] of sin God so loved the world that He
[2:00:26] gave His only begotten Son and whosoever
[2:00:27] believeth in him shall not perish but
[2:00:31] have everlasting life now I don't want
[2:00:33] us to do like everybody else's John in
[2:00:36] that scripture and just toss over it
[2:00:39] God so loved the world that He gave His
[2:00:41] only begotten Son I want you to really
[2:00:43] think about that he didn't just so loved
[2:00:46] the world he loved that world he don't
[2:00:50] love this field not this is Satan's even
[2:00:54] but he so loved it he said it was
[2:00:58] perfect his children were in the garden
[2:01:01] they didn't have to walk for nothing
[2:01:03] just trust God but after the
[2:01:06] transgression thorns and thistles and
[2:01:08] all of these kind of things come up and
[2:01:11] we deal with thorns and thistles today
[2:01:15] malice Hey
[2:01:19] in the strife their thorns and met
[2:01:26] thistles that poke calls pain resentment
[2:01:33] these are the fruit that these thorns
[2:01:37] and thistles bear God is love joy peace
[2:01:41] meekness the holy spirit soft loving but
[2:01:49] all of these other things that we have
[2:01:51] to deal with on a daily basis he cursed
[2:01:54] at him at the ground and he said that
[2:01:56] you have to work at this ground to eat
[2:01:58] we have to go to work
[2:02:00] we got to deal with jealous co-workers
[2:02:02] we got a deal with people trying to
[2:02:06] climb to the top and they are so
[2:02:09] engulfed with their position and money
[2:02:12] they will lie on you talk about you run
[2:02:16] you die but we got to deal with it
[2:02:18] thorns and thistles thorns and thistles
[2:02:23] but that's alright because we have a
[2:02:26] revelation that one day those thorns and
[2:02:31] those thistles will be burned up we'll
[2:02:34] walk out on the ashes of the wicked and
[2:02:36] the meek shall inherit the earth
[2:02:39] amen so we stay with the things of God
[2:02:42] because we have a revelation let's move
[2:02:45] on the Prophet said that God yes I
[2:02:47] thought he was angry with me but Christ
[2:02:50] loved me he said Jesus Christ was the
[2:02:53] very heart the very heart of God amen
[2:02:59] now I want you to understand amen
[2:03:06] when Jesus went before a man Pontius
[2:03:11] Pilate aney before the the judgment and
[2:03:16] they said crucify him crucify him
[2:03:20] those soldiers took him down the first
[2:03:23] thing they did was they made a crown of
[2:03:26] thorns those thorns that was meant for
[2:03:31] you and me they took him
[2:03:34] now these wasn't just little bitty birds
[2:03:36] these were thorns and they pressed it
[2:03:40] upon the head of our Lord Jesus and as
[2:03:43] the blood came streaming down in his
[2:03:45] head the blood in his eyes as they led
[2:03:50] him to the cross and they whooped him
[2:03:53] and they spat on him a shirt handfuls of
[2:03:57] his beard I they did all kinds of things
[2:03:59] to him he stood up hung up on that cross
[2:04:02] looking through those blood looking
[2:04:04] through the blood as those thorns those
[2:04:06] very thorns that at the beginning was
[2:04:08] dead because of our transgressions was
[2:04:12] pressed upon his head and he's bleeding
[2:04:15] in the blood in his eyes and he looked
[2:04:17] and all your sins are scarlet he's
[2:04:20] looking through the blood and all he
[2:04:21] sees his way Father forgive them for
[2:04:26] they know not what they do and so today
[2:04:29] my brothers and sisters we listen to the
[2:04:32] devil's life instead of accepting the
[2:04:36] real truth of the gospel in this hour as
[2:04:38] we hear you know when God is talking to
[2:04:40] you you mock it you turn it aside what
[2:04:45] are you doing you're pressing those
[2:04:47] thorns on his head why do stop
[2:04:50] persecuting me you go out and you do all
[2:04:53] kind of matter of evil and you do these
[2:04:55] things and you and you mean to one
[2:04:58] another and you bite bite and you do all
[2:05:00] these things why you're not persecuting
[2:05:04] one another without person killed me I
[2:05:07] looked at the Hat for you I paid the
[2:05:13] price all you have to do is go free why
[2:05:17] do they persecute me
[2:05:20] amen when all of these feelings and
[2:05:23] things rise up in you against your
[2:05:25] brothers and sisters with you when you
[2:05:26] when you when you're doing wrong and you
[2:05:28] know you're doing wrong and you can't
[2:05:29] come to the altar this why do it style
[2:05:32] persecute me thorns and thistles my
[2:05:39] brothers and sisters only the Holy
[2:05:42] Spirit amen
[2:05:45] I believe his son of God if you have
[2:05:48] been born again you're taking somebody's
[2:05:51] word for it
[2:05:52] you say well the Bible says so that's
[2:05:56] right the Bible did but what do you say
[2:05:58] well the preacher says so the preacher
[2:06:01] is right but what do you say my mother
[2:06:04] says it's right but what about you is it
[2:06:08] a personal experience of your own that
[2:06:13] you've got to be born again and you'll
[2:06:17] never if you never born again you'll
[2:06:19] never understand it it's not good enough
[2:06:23] to put on long skirts it's not good
[2:06:27] enough to put on a nice suit it's not
[2:06:31] good enough to come to the church you
[2:06:33] can do all of things and your heart is
[2:06:36] as black as midnight God deals with the
[2:06:41] heart he deals with the heart we must
[2:06:47] take on his heart why do it not
[2:06:50] persecute me a man scientists
[2:06:57] researchers find that in the human heart
[2:07:01] there's a little teeny sail that hasn't
[2:07:03] even got blood it hasn't got anything in
[2:07:08] it it's a little compartment
[2:07:10] he says the animals don't even have it
[2:07:13] only the human being and they say it's
[2:07:17] the occupation of the soul so after all
[2:07:20] a man believes in his heart it's not
[2:07:25] enough to have head knowledge you have
[2:07:28] to
[2:07:28] heart amen
[2:07:33] now your intellectual faith won't really
[2:07:36] it'll reason you said well now the Bible
[2:07:39] teaches that certainly but let me think
[2:07:41] now
[2:07:42] the days of miracle is past pastor said
[2:07:45] the days of miracle is past the pastor
[2:07:47] says so she says and I believe that this
[2:07:54] day we don't have that not see you're
[2:07:58] using intellectual faith and that
[2:08:01] intellectual faith will reason with God
[2:08:03] it's word but a born-again experience
[2:08:07] from the heart or not reason it'll say
[2:08:11] God's Word is right there's more no more
[2:08:14] to do with it is that right
[2:08:16] because something down here that says in
[2:08:20] itself there's nothing a man to do with
[2:08:24] it a few minutes that's for the
[2:08:27] musicians come amen amen
[2:08:43] this morning made of shades be pulled
[2:08:48] down to the cares and thoughts of this
[2:08:50] life over our memories over our hearts
[2:08:55] me this life over the made over our
[2:09:01] memories over our heart made this life
[2:09:03] over our members and our hearts and may
[2:09:06] we just see Jesus in him alone and we
[2:09:10] know that if we could draw a picture of
[2:09:15] a love of the love of God ten million
[2:09:17] times more the Seas of the earth banked
[2:09:21] into a tube a few inches across would
[2:09:26] reach billions of miles beyond the Stars
[2:09:28] and thinking of the pressure that would
[2:09:32] be at the bottom of that tool how that
[2:09:36] water would be billions of tons of
[2:09:39] pressure trying to press down and yet
[2:09:41] the love of God is searching our hearts
[2:09:44] tonight or this morning great powers of
[2:09:47] strength he would like to find one
[2:09:52] little crevice to leap through to come
[2:09:59] into our lives and give us this great
[2:10:01] power and unction beyond every man's
[2:10:04] understanding he says granite Lord
[2:10:07] tonight the doors of heaven would be
[2:10:11] pulled back and the Holy Spirit will
[2:10:13] take over full control may our souls be
[2:10:17] flooded with such a rush that we'll
[2:10:22] forget all about being crippled all
[2:10:24] about being sick will forget all about
[2:10:26] our problems and forget all about our
[2:10:29] aches and pains amen to take him at his
[2:10:33] promised claim the redemptive blessing
[2:10:36] of Jesus Christ amen
