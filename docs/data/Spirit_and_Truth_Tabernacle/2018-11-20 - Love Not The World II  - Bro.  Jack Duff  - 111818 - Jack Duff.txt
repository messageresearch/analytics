emotional person I advise you don't come to church on that date [Music] but when you go into the most holy place there supposed to be some noise is that what we found out on Wednesday night when that

want to wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving we won't have service amen this week Wednesday North Friday we this is usually a little vacation time for the family myself and we try to get away for that so you all just pray for us and we're starting to be praying for you all trusting that God will bless you as you get together with your families a man during this holiday season and we got a number of things that are coming up before us and they're gonna come out real fast so we want to do all amen we can just just to make sure that we're able to keep up but other thing I forgot to mention were the last weekend of the year and going into new years brother Trevor Eamon will be coming from Indiana he'll be here with us on that last Sunday as well as going into the new years he'll be here preaching for so we look forward to look forward to that amen god is good god is good all right I want to I'm just reading one scripture and we did not finish our thought from the last time I spoke on this subject of love not the world and and I'm not even sure if I'm gonna finish my thought today but I will go as far as I can and then you know from there the Lord has us to give a little more than we'll do that but I do want to try to try to take this a little further amen on today lets us stand and let's reach just one scripture have a word of Prayer and go from there this is out of first John chapter 2 verse 15 first John 2 and verse 15 praise the Lord says look not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him a man let's pray father we thank you for your word thank you for them the ability to read it but it takes the Holy Spirit to anoint what we've read to give us clarity and understanding so father we could walk clearly amen in the revelation of what you have for us we pray God that you a dis minister to each and every heart thank you for your anointing that's been in this place thus far and how we thought your presence and my you it's just amazing Lord that and sometimes when you come in it just makes it seem like like it was last night full of people but father we we we feel your anointing here today and we know that you're making a difference amen and our gathering so if you weren't here it wouldn't be worth our coming but we know that you are here now take control over the thought that's being presented here today to the people we take control of every spirit that's against your spirit and we cast it down now and pray that we receive from heaven it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seen [Music] so we are talking about this if you could just brother Jared maybe lower the the house just a little bit there a man the we're talking about this love the world and what I wanted to I mean we you know here you know I mentioned this you know when we first open this up and start ministering on it here John is telling us love not the world neither the things of the world that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and as we're looking at that but we also notice over in John 3:16 Amen it's written that for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and when I look at that these two scriptures and compare them my question is now if God so loved the world and then we get told love not the world what world is God talking about which world is he is the one that he loved which ones is he telling us not to love and you know so we start going a little deeper in Scripture in Hebrews 1 and verse 1 through 3 tells us God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son he says whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world a man he made the world's Hebrews 1 he made the world's in verse 3 here in Hebrews 1 says who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he when he had made when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high so there in verse 2 we can see that Amen there are whirls amen so when we when we when we look at this that God so loved though well we got to find out which world you know is talking about because there are worlds now also look over here in Colossians 1:16 just the kind of a man kind of clinched this praise the Lord says Colossians 1:16 says for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible hallelujah all things were created by him that are in heaven and that are in earth oh my god now if we just really looked at that so really in heaven a man I mentioned to y'all before brother Branham even brought this out to us that there's like three areas you know even even in he called it the region of the blest you know and then he broke it down into three areas and then he also called the region of the loss which was a part of the underworld and he broke that down into three areas right so here we're looking at this Amen says all things were created that are in heaven and that are in earth and even dimensions that we talked about here right on the earth glory to God your cell phone is operating a different dimension amen when you receive email amen a text message or whatever that's operating in a different dimension and God made that dimension hallelujah Satan uses it but God made it do you know amen the same way that a devil can attack you and angel can visit you right hey hallelujah amen sometimes when you trying to figure out why you can't go to sleep and why you came this and why you can't that's why I mention to you put on a tape glory to God let the prophets voice just play that atmosphere because it drives out the demons hallelujah you're gonna either win by going to sleep or you're gonna get the words one of the you're gonna win no matter what if you just put on a tape right hallelujah but by understanding this scripture here it's telling us that for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him hallelujah so now we're kind of getting a little it meant we want to go a little deeper as I mentioned to your last last time I preached this it's very easy when we look at the Scriptures they love not the world neither the things of the world it's very easy just to kind of stop that you know the way that we dress and the way that we present ourselves now don't get me wrong I think that's extremely important amen I know I feel like holiness is being redefined or trying to be redefined right I mean a lot of people try trying to redefine the soul in satara it's a it's a matter the heart actually it is and if you had something in your heart it would be expressed on the outside right if it was in your heart right but but you know I think that people you know let me um I'm I got I got a I got a say a couple things here I told you how Satan a man was in the Garden of Eden and Eve what brother Brandt says she peeked at the world peeked at the world now I wonder how can Eve she wasn't dealing with what y'all dealing with right she wasn't dealing with Amen some some magazine and getting a style from a magazine right she wants she wasn't dealing with peer pressure Amen in school she wasn't dealing with you know things on it I mean people inviting you to happy hour on the job huh Eve weren't going through anything like that how do EVP at the world amen and in the ending Garden of Eden it was just even was Adams a bunch of animals but hearing a serpent I'm not about a devil begin to present a certain conversation to Eve and when she began to open up her spiritual womb hallelujah amen to that conversation do you realize Eve to compete at the world in order to and when you do the same thing that they when you open up your spiritual wound to gossip when you open up your spiritual womb to nonesense you don't realize it to begin to take a peek at the world I know you're pressing rights I know you're looking right but when you open yourself up to these things you begin to be there for all I want to just read a scripture that just really blessed me turn the galatians 5 verse 7 and 8 you know a brother brother Paul hit it last night you can't talk to everybody you can't not not when they not when they've been influenced y'all y'all you know can you can you trust a drunk person right when they talking under the influence can you trust anything that they say right when they when there's an influence Amen you got you got to be careful you can not hold that he made you take it well they said they say they were drunk when they said it amen it won't hold up even in the court of law they were drunk they were a man they were under the influence and if you can't trust somebody naturally that is under the influence then you also can't trust somebody spiritually that is under the influence of another spirit but you have to be the one to recognize that they they aren't they under the influence where are they getting their inspiration from what world are they getting their inspiration from the humble role or is it coming from the above world you can tell which world is coming from right and in here to here to here what the skip to say laughs not the world all right all right all right I'm just trying to win him I think they trying to win you huh okay man I'm gonna you know I'm Eve when she took a peep at the world right brother branham said you know when Satan beginning to talk to her about knowledge she just had to take a little peep at the world just a little peep so I mean just just just opening herself up to some of the stuff that the devil is trying to present to her cause her to get off track and if we're not careful a man will get off track as well real fast you forget where God brought you from you forget what God did for you right amen because you don't fell in love with the world hallelujah can I can I just read a scripture Galatians 5 give me this I was reading this recently verse 7 give me first seven amen verse seven here in Galatians five it says this ye did run well I just want to talk to you you did run well who but but notice notice notice who not what who that this is Eve right we can see her in the scripture she was running well but who hindered huh whose doctor when she took a peep at the world who who did hinder you that she should not obey the truth I like that I like that because see sometimes it's the conversations that we get in that's pulling us from a mental love for God oh my don't let the devil so DS type of seeds in your spiritual wound be careful watch that devil hallelujah somebody now I want you to know something that ye did run well who not what but who did hinder you that she should not obey the truth now look at verse eight I love this because it doesn't say this persuasion Oh glory to God so who did hinder you and you know I often times you want in a man everyday what they was serving God they would in stay with that but but somebody came along and said something somebody came along and and indeed something and and when they did it the Bible say this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you amen not of him that counsel that persuasion didn't come from God oh my can I go a little further that conversation didn't come from God but it come from another room the underworld was trying to pull you down and we don't realize that that sometime the delicate I mean even Jesus recognized that the devil was anointing Peter a close friend of his a man a man that he had just given the key to the kingdom but in a few more verses he said get behind me Satan man on my Peter could have took it efficiently you're trying to call me the devil no I'm calling you the devil I'm just saying that the devil has anointed you that thought that you just present it came from the devil that didn't come from God and if you keep yielding yourself to those type of thoughts I'm not gonna be able to talk with you alright let's go on a little further here a man I want to just make sure that we're we're getting this I'll go back to this quote that I read oh no no no actually I want to bring in another quote last Sunday man brother Lusaka share this this is not a Feast of Trumpets this was the last quote on the last page but he shared this quote awesome and I gotta add that one too you know my thought here the Feast of Trumpets he says this the hour that we're living the ecclesiastical of spirits uniting together now and bringing them all to this big one slaughter to blot out it's already in writing here in this nation now that these churches has to be closed unless you're with the organization it's a union it's a boycott just like the mark of the beast and he goes on saying now you see what the Beast is don't you it's a power a power ecclesiastical power Jesus said it'll be so close like the real thing in a deceive the very elect the very elected if it was possible but this is the part that I wanted to get but he promised to have something here for us in that day that we wouldn't be deceived and that's the word and Christ to make it manifest to us and this is real important he said there are supernatural Devils unseen to the eye but you can see what they're doing a supernatural devil that is unseen to the eye but you can see what he's doing right so so this is why this why we got to understand sometimes when a man people are trying to get you to peep at the world a man it's a supernatural devil amen anointing them to say what saying Amen to get you off your course oh my god and I won't I want you to I want you to be very very careful here look we ain't got to be worried about our boss and our co-workers people that don't know nothing about the Lord right we ain't got to really be worried about them deceiving us they're not going to deceive us that's not gonna happen right I mean what what you want to just try to influence them where you got to worry about the deception is right within the family right within the church right that's where you got to really worry about the deception you gotta you got a watch spirits that will have naught people there oh my god hallelujah Amen there there's this um this little let's see here uh another scripture that I wanna yeah I'll bring it out in a little bit amen but so we're watching out because here the supernatural Devils that's unseen to the eye see they living in a different world right unseen to the eye but however you can see the manifestation of what those Devils are doing you might not see the devil you just see the manifestation and when you see the manifestation you know it's something that you got to avoid alright let's go on a little further amen so he says this in a message God's power to transform it says just step over and I'm a paragraph 126 amen and God's power to transform he says just step over on that side one bit let that creeper just get in one little hole around the shuk of that corn one time watch what takes place the corn is gone oh yeah it's done got him and that's the way it'll do it it'll do it every time Eve had to take just one peep at the world and it goes on say and let me say something to you brothers sister in first John the second chapter and the 15 verse we can read it if you wish to the Bible says if we love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in us now the Prophet is quoting this he says now the world there is not earth so we're looking at that scripture the word love not the world it's not just talking about the earth and and this is why I was saying last time we brought this this goes a little beyond where Penn comes took us right Pentecost can only talk about the way we dress but this goes a little further beyond just the way we dress and yes we still need the dress only I believe that but this goes a little bit further a man just don't stop it then the way we dress we gotta watch what we listen to and then we got a watch amen what we feed all hallelujah spirit glory to God they say now that the word there's not the earth it's a it's a Greek word it's cosmos which means the world's order a man it's a Greek word which means the world's order now brother branham also gives us a little bit more clarity even on that on the world order now I'm going to bring two different thoughts on this world order but I'm going to use this first one they just given us here amen because you know a definition I mean I'm sorry I work and have multiple definitions hallelujah can I just tell you about that word cosmos what it means it has multiple definitions one of the definitions for the word conversation and a harmonious arrangement or constitution order a government I think you might like my brother Jack what is that an apt and harmonious arrangement or Constitution order government that's denominationalism right when we try and establish denominationalism Amen you actually are taken of the world order oh my if you if you wanna if you wanna hallelujah it may you I mean went went went went when Israel decided that they wanted a king brother branham said they want it to be like the world hallelujah when you want a bishop rather than a prophet you want to be like the world hallelujah somebody it mean you want a great preach it and work than just a prophet and what the Prophet said you want to be like the world and the Bible say love not the world lot of things that are in the world because the love of God is not in you so see if you love those type of things something wrong with your experience hallelujah another another definition of this word caused most is they aren't godly multitude the whole mass of man alienated from God and therefore hostile to the cause of Christ amen so we shouldn't want to hang around with people that are actually hostile to the cause of Christ amen I might as well just say these things if you got a desire to hang with people like that something is wrong with your experience love not the world what we supposed to love everybody love not the world so you better find a balance in all these states don't let people trick you with scripture you know the devil used the scripture gets Eve don't let people trick you with the Bible well you know I'm just not sure if you don't know just don't talk to him because any time you might get a look confused God is not the author of confusion God is not the author that you know the devil trying to trick you when you get into something well ain't we supposed to love everybody yeah I mean God look God love God love the sinner but hate the sin all right hey man yeah we love everybody but I don't like the spirit that's dwelling in you and operating in you right now it's supernatural devil and you know you don't realize the supernatural Devils coming after them he already got them who the supernatural devil coming after you all right let's go see the ungodly multitude the whole mass of men alienated from God and therefore a hostile to the cause of Christ now let me also give you another definition it's we and this one I can't really get into this because this is really where I want to go with this scripture when I told you all the write down you know when I just read the script I say just write down you know what what does that mean that you love not the world what does that mean to you but but we didn't read the rest of the scripture and today I can't even go to the rest of the scripture but this definition goes to the rest of that scripture and hopefully you know next week I'll be able to kind of go into that part just to show you because the rest of the scripture said this for all that is in the world that's verse 16 for all in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world oh love not the world or the things of the world and now we find out what is in the world the thing that's in the world is the lust of the flesh right the lust of the eyes and the pride of life now when we when we when we when we get into that we're going to see how that's exactly what Nimrod wanted right he wanted the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life hallelujah that's exactly what Nimrod run and that's why we got to be careful with that because the scripture is warning us of something here if we're chasing those things and not chasing God we're missing it all right amen God got to be first place God got to be first place right now let me read you this definition say world affairs the aggregate of things earthly the whole circle of earthly good endowments riches advantages pleasures etc which although Hollow and frail and fleeting stir desire seduced from God and our obstacles to the cause of Christ so here we are we're looking at this thing some of the things that are in the world are lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life of things that actually take you further from God they don't actually bring you closer to God but when you begin to lust after those things they take you further from God and what the Bible says that love not those things because if you start loving that it shows that the love of the father is not inside of you oh I know what I'm talking about this morning let me go on a little further I want to just try to drive this home if I can let me read this amen amen all right so uh I told you I want to bring two different definitions from what the prophets said about cosmos so hearing God's power to transform he says now and paragraph 128 says now the word there is not earth it's a Greek word it's cosmos which means the world's order if we love fascists this is this is one of his definitions if we love fashions of the earth the world if we love the trend of the date night now don't don't get the profit wrong here it ain't nothing wrong with looking nice ain't nothing wrong with looking nice there's nothing wrong with that at all I mean I think I think everybody should want to look nice aim that's that's great I think we're the spirit come in is that that's the only reason you come in the church uh-huh I'll come on y'all y'all in st. y'all wait talking to me right your reason for coming to church because you got to show everybody what you got what you look I mean oh man you can't wait for Sunday and you have a certain time that you want to walk through the door when you know everybody gonna be I mean we did that in Baptists right hey man you you you noticed a certain time that you walked through the door can I can I be honest oh my right a man if God bless you with a new vehicle you park it in a certain place huh right we park it so we want everybody to see this and sometimes not I want people to see my blessing sometimes it's a little pride behind that Oh glory to God right amen you get some new clothes special if it's Easter Sunday amen you come with the wrong intentions ain't no trouble again and then trust me if somebody hallelujah got a look too close to you and was in the spirit beginning it's not on your clothes your spirit change just like that it shows that you did not come with the right spirit you didn't even buy that in the right spirit huh right number with fashion but it's just the spirit that goes behind these things all right that's what that's what we talk about love not the world love not the world I'm not the world Oh God Oh God and if I could just you know also saying I know some of us we so so so sadiddy' if I can use that word summer Sousa did it we can't get that from Goodwill huh I mean we ain't gonna wear that I remember I remember I ain't gonna call it what my daddy used to call it but I ain't gonna call her what my daddy used to call it but he used to tell I ain't wearing them clothes see what I've seen see that's why we got to watch the spirits that that come with you know you know that spirits even on clothes it's spirits in everything that we do sometimes your sisters y'all don't realize some of the designers are the clothes that they met homosexual men right Amy and they want it they want to show certain parts of the body they want they want to try to push those parts of the body right I mean you got you got to watch these spirits that's behind it you just can't go running and getting everything it's a spirit there hallelujah you know can I just be honest you know it's certain even even even in our Christian faith sister sometimes there's certain skirts that that a sister can wear that's just as bad as pants [Music] can I be honest see I'm a lord help me God you know it's just you know I want to be honest you gotta watch how it's cut right amen everything is not of God Amen it might hit your leg a certain way when you walk him oh my god and part of the skirt is high part of its low what part you think the man go see the part that's a low right you got you don't know I know I let me let me just be like this let me just let me just tell you like this as a sister you can't think like a man so that's why you might put it on you don't even think you know that ain't nothing wrong with that no a man sees something different in that keep it all covered you can't make it too short you can't make it too tight huh you can't make it too low same thing with brothers I said this before you gotta watch how you dress too come on somebody and then we still need this the difference I mean the a lotta stuff is anointed by the devil and we're going after the things that the devil's presented to us no but God given to us that style did not come from heaven that haircut didn't come from heaven huh that hairstyle didn't come from heaven it was the influence from another world the underworld right it's the truth anyhow glory to God seeing it now I'm giving you his definition because you know he said that that world there that word world in 1st John 2:15 love not the world he says the world there is the word there's not earth it's a Greek word is cosmos which means the world's order now he gives you even a little further you know definition here in this paragraph he says if we love fashions of the earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that is because your thinking is wrong right if you think that you have all these things if you say if you think because you're thinking it's wrong it's perverted by the devil oh my god your thoughts can be perverted by the devil it's say your thinking is wrong it is provided by the devil so if you love the world's order and the things of this present world is because the love of God is not even in you and you know I mean you as you just read that you can just think about Lot's wife she loved the world she loved the condition that she was living in she loved that more than death in the message she heard from an angel not wonder how many of us are really sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our mix I mean sufficiently impressed that this word is enough of me God I find got nothing else I got the word can I just you know I just I just want I want to go a little further I want to try to get as far as I can here today here's another definition out of the message birth pains a man out of the message birth pains the Prophet talked about this cosmos this world order so now we know it deals with clothing that that's a part of the world order because we're going after the fashions and things of the world hallelujah that's wrong that's perverted from the devil and here another thing in birth pains he says this this is another definition said now let's just think for a minute never has the world had a messenger over the world we had finish Sankey's moody's finished Knox Calvin so forth all around the world messages to the church in these birth pains but never did we ever have a man going out with the International message until this day with his name ending in H am a b ra h am which is six letters a br aham is seven is seven letters we got one today name gra h am six letters and six is the number of the world right it says creation day when did the world ever have a man have a man down into it preaching down in the cosmos now there's another definition here a man preaching down in the cosmos down there in the world I'm they're calling the people out let me say repent repent perish or come out of it until this age gr aham look what he's doing preaching the word blinding the outside us Colin come out a messenger from God Jesus said that would take place just when the southern man will be revealed himself now that that's where that's at out there in the church orders world and they begin to hate the man for it now you know as I look at that so brother branham's telling us down in the denomination because Billy Graham gr aham he went amongst the denominational churches preaching the word right he and he had a message that I mean if you ever hurt one of his sermons on repentance you'd be ready to repent that man had the anointing for that right but look at how the Prophet drops that so I'll drop that on he kept putting it on gr aham six letters number of man going to the world but he never even introduced to the people that his name also ended in H a.m. it was BR a n H a.m. which was seven letters that wasn't going to the world that was going to the pride OH so if you love denomination then you love the world and guess what just against what the Bible say if you love the world I don't care how much they say what a there's no love down there if you love the world the love of God is not in you I didn't say that John said it I just preached it Lou yeah amen but here GRA H am went to the world and that was a messenger to the world but br8 in h am seven letters came to the pride I thank God for that now can we go on a little further smyrnaean church each stay with me here glory to God glory to God and I'm gonna hit just a couple more things here is this how tragic that was how tragic that was I'm in paragraph 123 how tragic that was little did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him he talked about Israel right when they were David when they won a king right rather than a prophet to lead them and trust me I talked to y'all I talk to y'all I've tryin to let y'all know about this beer is that spirit of Nimrod that wanted to conquer certain things right he wanted to make a name for himself he had to go into certain he had I mean it's the same spirit today you can't make a name amongst the message people you're not gonna get enough exposure so you have to go into areas other churches play on certain stages preach on certain platforms in order to make a name behind everything that you saying is this spirit that loves the world you won't that's what pride of life popularity right people love popularity they want to be popular if this ain't the age for that if this thing the age whether I mean everybody want followers and you trying to get more followers you don't realize how the devil is anointing that hallelujah you're not trying to give and let me tell you something if you was given scripture nobody would follow you if you give in quotes personally nobody would follow you that lets you know that they not real friends or they not real followers oh my god my god watch it we've taken a people at the world alright stay with me I want I want to go a little further with this it says how tragic that was little did they realized that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they was they were rejecting him because God had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world here's another one they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world so when we got folk in the church looking like the world we don't know which okay which side you won't you know the people in the church supposed to look different it's like we're not supposed to blend in with the rest of world when and when you leave Church you still supposed to be looking different hallelujah glory to God I mean I the pass over here next door he could tell the difference they come out one day and he told me said I went and told my church I want y'all sisters to dress like that he pointed over here dressed like them cuz he could tell the difference and then trust me every church that moves into this Plaza can see the difference y'all just stand up that's a testimony so we love not the world nor the things of the world you can't you can't you know you can't do that and say that you love God you don't you don't love God actually what you are you are infatuated with the idea you [Music] you're infatuated with the idea of being in love but you don't love God right it's a it's a difference of being infatuated with the idea and then actually being in love hallelujah I'm coming back to this don't don't don't no I'm coming it says God ordained it as people act different from the world they are not of the world they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world they're crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them and it gives us a verse of scripture 2nd Corinthians 6 verse 17 through 18 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord that's not even since the Prophet that's not saying brother Jack come out be separate stance the Lord you are not shining light in a denominational Church and don't don't give me that I can see right through you not shining a light no denominational Church not not not every Sunday you go there the first Sunday you might be shining light but every time you go and you starting to knuckle down to what they doing you're like just when I you might be dressing different your dress don't tell the story Amen you might be dressing a little different but they can tell you write a full agreement with him now you know brother branham don't get I'm going to share a few things here brother branham one time he was uh he was out traveling and he saw a man worshipping the Sun and brother branham got out his car went over the met wedding man was worshiping he got down on the ground he began to worship the Son of God not the son but he be getting to worship right along with the man now now somebody said well and look at how he was kind of inclusive no it's not not not really that it's not really he didn't do that every Sunday right this was a one time thing where he was in another country and he went out and did that that was able to win some of those people right but but here you know one of the thing that he did this all the time and that's well you know you might go visit a denomination Church but if you feed from there you love the world you love the world and what the Bible says that the love of God is not in you hey man I'm just I I don't know how to make it no less plain I got to be this way right because khuskhus spirits come upon people let me I might get trapped in the conversation don't realize it's a supernatural devil that's attacking you why don't you come visit well why don't you come visit how many of y'all have ever ever made a promise that go visit somebody's Church and I'm the under the under the the pre-test that they were going to come and visit your church and how many y'all winter visit there's but never seen them come visit yours it happen all the time you know why they looking at you they can see your life they don't want nothing to do with it and if they feel that way about you why are you trying to you trying to win them no I mean just let him let him be look all that the has given me no I'm gonna go get him hey what Jesus said he say all that the father's giving me will come I don't know how I don't know we but they come in i'ma just stay with this alright glory to God I said you couldn't go visit there's one thing that vis is another thing to get caught in station alright hallelujah amen hey man you gotta watch spirits and sometimes we ain't just visiting we ain't just visiting we say we are but actually we trying to find a way out well I was just I was just visiting no you not you are trying to find a way out and look I ain't trying to keep you here can I be honest if this if this word don't keep you ain't nothing else gonna keep you right but I'm not trying to keep here but I am telling you that you can't go out then expect to make no rapture hallelujah and I can tell you this much if you that's the world cosmos Church order a man if you ain't never experienced it just wait you will you go out there you see what I'm talking about amen the politics that aren't there are unbelievable unbelievabl you thought people love God amen you thought we was hypocrites wait till you see them oh they hypocrite oh they hypocrites out everywhere around us hypocrites will you be the real thing let me let me finish this I I wanna I got something that I want to do here today listen but I got before I get that I gotta say sir a few things 2nd Corinthians 6:17 3 and wherefore company out come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty but you got to come out of there right you can't go into it and expect to be a son of God you got to come out amen now look at this when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything I wanted to just kind of drop a little something in on that alright and brother Branham goes on to talk about Eve how she made a statement when she had came I got a man from the Lord right she made that statement and and yes I mean in any birth God has to be involved in it but but but King did not come from God Cain came from a situation where Eve got herself by peeping into the world she got herself into a situation that she couldn't get herself out of and she got pregnant a man from from the serpent now a lot of people I was reading something on the internet and understand we people that follow brother Branham they call us brand of mites right and they say they say they believe that Eve had a sexual relationship with a snake no no that's not what we believe let me let me straighten that out let me straighten it out and then you can go back and read your Bible and find out that it wasn't a snake that was slithering on the ground she didn't have sex with an animal like that she did have sex with the serpent let me tell you something in case you didn't know is through sexual contact that that babies are born there's only one baby that was born without sexual contact that was the Lord Jesus Christ that was through the spoken word right but but all babies are born through sexual contact even in the animal kingdom animals are born through sexual contact truth any high right so it was not so snake on the ground it was a beast that's brutal two feet that looked like a man talk like a man walk like a man and that piece after it was involved in the fall that beast got cursed and if you don't believe me go back and look at Genesis 3 why was Adam cold into God's presence why was Eve cold until God's presence and why was the serpent called into God's presence he didn't call for no alligator he didn't he didn't call for a lion he didn't come for an elephant he called the serpent and I said because who did this curse you'll be and you'll be on your belly for the rest of your days so he lost his ability to stand on two feet and now he's on the ground that's what we believe praise God that's the missing link now you're gonna give me a gorilla I don't believe that but when the church gets away from the world in a believe anything brother Branham say a hungry hungry person will eat out of a garbage can can I tell you something if you spiritually hungry you eat from a denominational garbage can not a seven-course meal a denomination of garbage can and I can go further than that you know how a dog is can I put it this word Bigfoot this way a dog is nasty nasty you know why I call them nasty cause he'll vomit throw up in front of you and then go right back and start the stuff that he just threw up and the street see the way y'all shake your head and I ain't no way but that's I said dog is nasty and and and can I just just be honest if you can go back into denomination church after hearing this word after after living this word and go back and feel comfortable you're a dog that went back to his vomit when the church gets away from the word and you think you got the word if you're not looking at it through a filter a prophetic filter you ain't got nothing either believe anything you know and I want I got to bring this out because I hear this and y'all might be hearing the same thing - people say things like we can't be justified by the law and and I want to say amen to that because that's what the Bible's saying we can be justified by law that's why we needed Jesus but just because we can't be justified by the law don't mean we have to get rid of the law don't mean now you start going against the law because you can't be justified by I don't mean that you give up on the law no I think we still need to you know not not bear false witness I think we still don't need to serve idol gods I think we still need to honor the Sabbath I think we need to still honor our Father and our mother I think we should still not kill and steal we should steal honor the law of God can I go further I still think that a menace against the Word of God in Deuteronomy for women to wear pants or to wear any any garment pertaining that's what the Bible say if it pertains to a man a woman not supposed to put it on if it looked like a man aware it a woman not supposed to put it on and a man not supposed to wear a garment of a woman hello somebody I still but that's that yes that was in law Deuteronomy mean two laws it was in the law but it still tough saith the Lord and it's still prevalent today all right hallelujah Church we might as well just stop and say these things and make sure it's real clear because we not just yeah you can't be justified just in your skirt you can't justify just in your dress you gotta have something changed on the inside and if it does change on the inside and I told you to dress right because you to live right any man but I'm hearing that I'm hearing that and that just bothers me I got I got some y'all just bear with me I got two scriptures I want to read if y'all would just bear with me Romans three Roma Street Roma Street glory to God glory they got a man I mean anytime you see you cannot cannot cannot tell you all some because if y'all ever get into a conversation like that with people I set you up earlier I said it's a supernatural devil it's a supernatural devil and you just see the results of what that Devils doing but sometime in the conversation even realized she was dealing with a supernatural hello she just thought she was talking to the serpent when she was peeping at the world and sometimes you don't know you don't you're not entered into the conversation with a supernatural devil hidden behind skin you don't even know you're talking to a devil Eve had no idea when she was peeping at the world so yeah I'm just going to visit yeah really it's just a visit no it's the way you saying that it's something right about this visit amen and why you got to go visit why can't they come visit you I have said it before I mean if I had a kid that was living in my house or they may have to be living in my house but they told me that they want to go to church and they needed a right to church what church you think I'm gonna bring them to you say you want to go to church well I go to church every week you do you really want to go to church because if you want to go to church I go to church every Sunday now you know what Church I'm going to so if you really want to go get in the car let's go but isn't now I want to go to church but not your church oh you just that's a supernatural devil you know what you're dealing with well can you take me take you yeah I can take you 39-51 have a hero suite 109 that's what is car going what would it look like for me to I mean I tell y'all I had to take my childhood spiritual what church I go on - all right all right I'm trying to say love not the world or the things of the world that's all I'm saying Church now let me read here out of regulation I mean romans romans three I got I got a couple of things that I need to read and I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna do something here Lord God help me Jesus Romans three let's just read this verse 19 look at this because we hear this we hear this it we can be justified by the law watch them statements watch watch that when people start talking that nonsense especially somebody done walked away from this word if they start talking that they they're setting you up because they are getting ready to wear something that you didn't think they was gonna wear as soon as they say I'm we came he justified by the law there's another spirit behind that it's coming you will see it because Lord I'm coming to this scripture y'all bet I can't even get too many thoughts coming to me you know any time and I said this before i'ma say it again any time that it like a person that's moving into homosexuality if they want the world to know because it's not natural I don't you know we don't even have the net we don't have to do nothing to announce that I'm a boy it don't even mean nothin to nobody yeah we know you're a boy I'm a girl you know you know we don't even have to announce that right but black but when you when you want to go from being a boy to being a girl or you want to be a girl from a girl to being a boy you always have to do some grand announcement because it's not natural and not only that it's not accept it so since it's not accepted you got to try to make people accept you have to put a grand announcement so so when people leave this word Amen and they begin to going to dress in ways that they didn't used to dress that way they have to post it and announce because it's not natural anytime you see a big post like that how come it's just a postive look at me in a skirt look at me in a dress but they have to always post when they start wearing pants now when they go back to address they won't post it it's a spirit all right so when we see this justified by the law let's read the Bible Romans 3:19 now we know that what things soever the law saith it's said to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God there's that word world again and here's the world being guilty before God because we're not following the law right since therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in the sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin that's why God gave us the law to help us understand what was righteous and what was unrighteous okay says but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even though even the righteousness and see I could just stop right there now the righteous of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets a man here the prophets are giving us the interpretation of what the law is okay hey man you're gonna reject the prophet he tell you what the law is saying okay listen even the righteousness of God which is by faith of which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all of them that believe for there is no difference look at this for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace so yes we are justified by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus see they could not reach perfection through the law because there was nothing to change the inside now we got something that changes the inside that can bring us to perfection in God's eyes this whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God listen to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where boasting then it is excluded by what I mean by what law of works name but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith that's exactly what Paul said we can't be justified by the law but by faith therefore man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law is he the god of the Jews only now look at what he's doing it's all about in the scripture we got the Jews and we got the Gentiles you see the God of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also this is what Paul is trying to get us to see not trying to get rid of the law trying to get a seat at the Gentiles and the Jews are being accepted in God's presence just because the Jews had the law them did it did make a perfect they had to come through the blood just like the Gentiles so no we're not justified by the law we understand that we're justified by faith now let's go on here look at this verse 30 seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith look at this do we make void the law do do we make void the law I know you say we can't be justified by the law but my question is do we make void the law do you faith god forbid not only that not only not only god forbid can i read the rest of the verse I'm talking about what Paul said God forbidden and brother Branham preached the same thing Paul preached a million said we're resting on that God forbid yay we establish we don't get rid of it no we establish the law we make it greater so we want everything from Genesis all the way to Revelation amen and if a prophet told us that it was wrong to dress a certain way and he took us back to the law and showed us it was because the Prophet had the ability to do that amen all right I told you they eat out of garbage can when the church gets to work gets away from the order to believe anything anything now I'm skipping a little bit in this quote because I got to I got something that I want to do today and i'ma let y'all go after I do this amen I'm gonna skip this quote I'm gonna read the quote I'm gonna read the quote and y'all just got the going overtime with me I gotta get these things out I'm in paragraph 125 two and I need a somebody just get ready for one of y'all brothers get ready I'm gonna get something I got something for you when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything it is like II when Cain was born she said I've gotten a man from the Lord now do you realize that she really meant that she thought she had a man for the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the Word of God she then thought that whatever she sent was right if she said that she had a man from God then she had a man from God you know people say I felt led and whatever they say it's right no long you ain't feel that you was you was anointed by a supernatural devil didn't recognize it you start feet and just like Eve was feet and you got anointed by a supernatural devil amen listen he says whatever whatever she said was right if she said that she had a man from the Lord from God then she had a man from God but God has set laws in this universe a good C can only bring forth good fruit and evil C can bring forth only evil fruit now each seed though different you will utilize the same earth nourishment moisture and sunshine but it will bring forth after some kind and got away from something here hold on what paragraph away at my end what paragraph is 126 125 I miss a good secret Allah bring forth good fruit and the evil secret can bring forth on the eve now each seat though though different would utilize the same earth nursery moisture and sunshine but it would bring forth after its own kind notice the history of the cane line notice the history of the South line only one difference between the original seed nothing else between them the original seed nothing else it goes on it says if you look at the statement of Eve real close you will notice that she had more of an understanding than most realized she did not attribute the Sun to Satan for that would have made him equal with God only God could create the egg in the womb of Mary Satan couldn't do that even knew that Satan can only pervert so he begat her with the wrong seed it was a serpent seed that brought forth Cain it was Adam seat that brought forth Abel and Seth those seeds went through exactly the same process but the children were different for they were from different seeds she believed that Cain was from God she accepted the devil's lie as the truth of God that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as sponsors of truth but the truth is not in them that can I go a little further okay I might as well hurt people's feelings even you got the word truth in your name don't mean you following truth I might as well just hurt your feelings even though you got the word truth in your name don't mean you following truth amen I'm going further ain't done yet she accepted the devil's lie as the truth of God that is exactly what we have now churches set them up that set themselves up as Fountains of truth but the truth is not in them yet they're begotten children swear them and will even kill to uphold their huh how do they kill how not necessarily getting a gun and shooting yeah did the Prophet teach us this is not getting a gun on our knife and stabbing your brother no it's killers influence say something about them that get the people to counter shook up about him right and some of us just cannot just be I'm gonna be honest so gullible that we won't even find out both sides of the story we just take off of one side no that's the supernatural devil don't do that she don't love not the world that best that's where we talk about world cosmos that's what Eve did when she peeped at the world she fell in love with a lie so must actually want it do we want that we want it to be right we actually want that lie to be truth but it ain't can I go this is where I need some help this right here and I told y'all a long time ago I was coming here now ain't no it's gonna take me this long to get here and I know I was there gonna have to trench through so much to get here but I'm here now I mean I was reading just one more part of that of that of that paragraph because this is what I need everybody if you think that is an exaggeration read all of 2nd Timothy chapter 3 and the first five verses of the fourth chapter so I need a reader well they're brothers I need a read on brother Branham just told us to read all the second Timothy chapter 3 somebody help me one of my brothers help me and you don't have to speak loud and speak proud second Timothy chapter 3 we going back old school just for a few minutes is that Alright second Timothy chapter 3 who Morita who Morita who verinha you got a real ow I'm Tyler real loud and you got to put some force behind it wait a minute wait a minute so in the last days what's gonna happen me and gonna be lovers of what there are all cells all right covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful what so when we post in certain things on facebook when we post it on Instagram snapchat or whatever you know you know even when you're trying to get your follows you know what you're trying to do huh you your lover of your own self oh my and it's better than shots you know like what you want us to see what is it that you really want us to see I'll tell about you you you you you you you 73 years old and you got one like this who you huh I mean if see see where we got that influence from I just need that how does a 73 year old getting influenced like that where did it come from the underworld of the above world see so so here you tell us that we're gonna be lovers of our own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers right disobedient to parents and if this ain't an age where kids are so disobedient I don't know I don't know what it is Oh y'all making me preach you can't even get no job but you got a big mouth attitude like crazy can't even feed yourself if you got put out you can't go do nothing on yo you got to go to somebody else house so since you ain't got enough to go Amen you got enough to go get it get y'all you might as well stay where ya yeah I tell you I'm going old-school on you this is old-school preaching I'm coming home but I had to do this now keep on reading brother verse three so in this hour we're gonna have people with a say levels of pleasure that means they love the world more than they love God's right but we don't have that they gonna choose the things in the world all of other things of God and you got to watch yourself when you start doing that watch what spirit is influencing you go remember say some people y'all just can't talk to y'all thought I was just making it up but here we get we get words from Paul that if Amen you see people that are operating in cosmos the world order is safe from such no no no go to the house and have fellowship call them up on the phone see if you can win them over is that what the Bible tell you what did the Bible tell you to do that means you have to hang up sometimes you ought to feel a supernatural devil come here if you spiritual enough you're feeling well that's the supernatural - oh no that comment you just said I'm not gonna entertain that I got to go well you just hung up on me yes I did and I will not be picking up the phone again until you can kind of get them something straight if you can't figure out why I hung up on you don't call I'm just texting you like crazy just don't respond and if you get that bad you know what you can do Oh because everything start bouncing back then they know something hello somebody and if that don't work change the number all right I'm going on see verse 5 tell us from such turn away and look now let's go to verse 6 for this sort or a day which creep into houses and lead captives silly women lately no of sins let away of a German list silly woman how come he not going through the husband how come he not calling the husband ain't we seen this pattern before then what happen what Eve well the conversation she got into oh y'all don't talk to me today this is the same pattern I told y'all Eve Pete that's the world guess what if Eve wouldn't did that we wouldn't be what we had Oh Eve looking at you now to see you gotta watch when you pointin one thing always remember especially if you do it like this 1 2 3 4 a porting right back at ya watch the spirits notice it and and we could probably break down why I call them silly women because a lot of times it's the sisters now don't get me wrong I'm gonna say most of the time as sisters that get caught up in gossip there are some brothers that will gossip and when you got a gossip and brother you really got a problem you may he can he always I call it diarrhea of the mouth mouths it loose you watch a fellow like that and don't you talk too much around him yo bidness yeah let me go on verse verse 7 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of okay I gotta stop there you know it's all kind of revelations that day I told y'all about this thing on on what people saying as far as you know we can't be justified by the law tells another that I heard recently about what happened in the Garden of Eden the garden the trees in the garden I was told that and I don't know maybe I might be not mentioned this right so forgive me from saying this wrong but I was told that somebody had a revelation that it was the trees in the garden the Tree of Life and tree of knowledge of good and evil was the Old Testament and the New Testament see when you get away from the word you'll eat anything Old Testament New Testament did not even exist at that time not in the Garden of Eden it didn't all we got to do is take what the Prophet said don't try to come up with nothing just go back to what the Prophet said he said the Tree of Life was Jesus and said the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the devil and Eve had a conversation with the devil that's what got her into that condition supernatural devil let's go on now as Genesis and Jambres withstood Moses so duties also reset the truth resist resist the truth see they can resist the truth as well okay that's there and that's the hour that you live in and there's Patti high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they resist truth let's go on men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith totally against the faith but they shall proceed no further Oh for they folly shall be manifest unto our men that's right there's also was keep on going but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which shall come unto me at antonov Antioch at Iconium Lystra what persecutions I am do it but out of them all the Lord did what keep on going yeah and all that will live godly in christ shall suffer persecution let's read that again yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution that means some people can talk about you yeah some foking don't want to be around you some people are gonna have some issues with you and can I tell you something you can't make everybody love you all that live in Christ Jesus gonna suffer persecution you still go to that church y'all still believe that yeah yeah I still go to that church and I and I still believe that but how many churches you don't been in since the last time I saw you verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse no no it's gonna get better and sometimes it's they gonna get better no no it's gonna work at wax worse and worse let's look at what it say deceive is sieving and being the seed but I'm glad I don't stop there go to verse 14 but continue thou in the things which thou has learned Oh youyou continue in the things which you've learned don't let nobody pull you off like you've got pulled off all right continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them you didn't just get this from brother Branham you got it from Jesus verse 15 and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ thanks from a child you have you been wearing dresses and skirts from a child why you don't wait till you get 62 y'all making me say things I don't want to see you you know your body had the proportions of your body has changed you don't look like you used to look and now you can you know that's a supernatural devil I can I mean I could talk about myself I mean why am I gonna go out there and try to put on a muscle shirt man hide that verse 16 all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works all right brother Branham told us to read all the second Timothy three and then he also said to read a few verses of second Timothy four verse one through five and I'll read that it says I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom read that from the brother Jeffrey preach the word be instant season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine no brother Jeffrey out I made some people upset saying things in this pulpit they're gonna go to youtube and see the sermon and they're gonna give me a thumbs down I got a job and I want to tell you something I was hired by God even when I wasn't asking for the job I got called in for an interview and I realized a long time ago that I couldn't wrestle with God and win so I just surrendered and now I can't help but do what God called me to do and that's preach the word be instant and why in season obviously I know you might say well some of this time I tell y'all this is seasonal for what you're going through right now but some of y'all it's out of season it's coming go back to this sermon love not the world see when you look at the title you gonna think oh brother Jack disputing about dressing yeah it's dresses and it's in there yeah but we also talked about a little bit more the same thing that Eve got caught up cuz she peeped at the world she was struggling with dressing what was she struggling with same thing we all struggle with some different interpretation of the word verse 3 go ahead brother for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap of themselves teachers having itching all right so they got engineers and they got brain instead of their own teacher now you know in the book of Judges that happen you know they were so far gone they didn't have priests so this man kind of created his own gods and then a higher priests high priest and then what come along a whole truck come along and took the priests out of out of his house say look you can serve us you can get paid more about coming up that man dropped his job and if you know if you're not careful just look around a lot of folks that are that are out there in these systems they go from church to church why prestige mo money lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life that's what drives them they not satisfy preaching to 25 can we just call it like it is I remember brother Anderson say if God gave you game call you to be passed and he told you gonna pass the 499 you will not pass the 500 and you will not pass the phone 98 you will pass the 499 they've got call you to pass the 9 you not pastoring 10 and you won't pass the 8 you a pastor 9 you got to be some impressed and and satisfied with what God is giving you verse 4 and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables don't tell me what the prophets said I don't want it hidden on got no profit y'all heard that spirit before this is the spirit of the last day just just preach Jesus I am I'm preaching Jesus they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables verse 5 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of that ministry so you love not the world all the things of the world because if we if you know the Bible says if any man love the world the love of the father's not in him verse 16 says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world verse 17 said and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever I'm not finished I got to go into that lust of the flesh lust of the eye proud of life I got to go deeper than that because that's what Nimrod fell for and that's what people fallen for today Church be careful supernatural Devils anointing people and and see again that scripture that we read you know in Galatians who hindered you right and whoever it was that hindered you they were not sent by God annoying it by a devil to come in hinder you god help us to be careful let's pray Jesus your word is true your word is real your word is necessary your word is needful it purges us it cleanses us it washes us God and my prayer is we just bring this thought to the people as you've laid it in my heart now that we would hear what the Spirit is trying to say to us say when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against the enemy I gotta let the word be quicken I understanding me open revelation be given let us receive warning of the Holy Ghost of God that we you know scripture tell us amen from such turn away there's things that we just got to turn away from weak we can't entertain it not now prophet talked about how the angel forewarned him don't get your line Ingle up in times like these we want to we want to remain fishing we want to keep our lives in the water God not not hang it up and on the shore on the boat and can't can't can't do nothing god help us please help us God I pray Lord Jesus that you would you would just continue to minister to us and speak to us and only way that you can that we would draw closer to your father through your word help us remain humble in your presence this is Jesus name that I pray
