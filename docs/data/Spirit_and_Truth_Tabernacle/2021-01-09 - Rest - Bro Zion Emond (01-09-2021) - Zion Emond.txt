praise bless it be the name of the lord nobody like jesus nobody like jesus my god my god my god can be seated in the presence of the lord man how privileged we are to be able to come to god's house tonight and i certainly feel the same way david felt when he said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord i believe david came to church with an expectation and uh we tonight should have come with that same expectation i believe god will meet us in a very special way amen i am fresh off a pretty long day it was kind of done a little suddenly i didn't get a chance to announce it to the church um a precious sister that used to timber the west coast church sister ermina um she had passed away and um you know actually what had happened is that her family kind of just did you know service and not necessarily and had everybody invited i believe the family is of a different faith and um you know so they just kind of did what they wanted to do but brother weskel just felt to hey let's just have a time where we come together and just honor sister mina for you know just the years of service um and she had been a part of multiple churches here in the area i believe as recent with brother wesko also with brother bernard down in miami also with uh brother um [Music] familial assembly in miami and uh and then before that she was a part of the church in sarasota so when she came to florida she got a chance to just be a part of a number of ministries and and and i was telling the church today i had an opportunity to go to the nursing home that she was in and when i went there to nursing home i was going to meet a particular brother there brother that come in from arizona and he was here on vacation with a another uh a minister from um germany and they were they were having vacation there in um uh fort myers fort myers and as they were there in fort myers they decided to get in their car on vacation drive three and a half hours over here to come visit our sister in the nursing home and i said you know she must have lived a life that touched so many people that a man would leave vacation from germany to drive three and a half hours to go visit her in the nursing home i said that's the life that i want to live that i can touch people like that that when i get down you know like that people don't mind coming to see about me so we certainly appreciate her and just actually continue to keep her family in prayer uh you know in in the loss but we did that early this morning and you know just had a little service just to remember her a man uh as a faithful soldier of the cross uh in our miss she also was a woman that had the opportunity a precious sister had the opportunity to meet god's prophet um said that she said in many meetings and even had the opportunity to ride in the car with him and even get personal interview with him at different times so the lord really blessed her and and i was just sharing some comments uh i was uh telling them as you know as far as being a soldier i said you know i had the chance to bury a soldier in um uh arlington national cemetery i said one of the great attractions at arlington national cemetery is the changing of the guard i said if we're careful to look amen we'll see that many of the the saints that were here with the prophet uh got a chance to be in the meetings and things like that many of them are passing away and what we're seeing right before our very eyes is a changing of the guard amen so we thank god to be a part of this amen so tonight um i didn't tell you all uh this i just said brother trevor would be with us amen the eamonn family is a precious family to me uh uh brother trevor is a dear friend you all know of mine uh and um um he's at home the family's at home when they come here to west palm beach and um and he was telling me say you know we've known each other uh since zion was three months old uh that's a long time because he's a long way from three months right now i'm telling but uh but uh zion has been called to ministry and uh we thank god for uh his call to ministry uh and i just wanted you all to get a little treat tonight amen at this service brother zion is going to be ministering for us and i told him just feel free you're at spirit and truth tabernacle say whatever lord put in your heart just let it fly you know uh but we're we're certainly happy to have uh have him and have the entire family with us but before uh brother zion would come to minister uh the uh i don't know if it's the family but yeah the family is gonna do a special force amen so that's why i say i got i got another one i got one i got one so we want to invite the eamon family to come at this time let's just make sure everybody gets a mic there and uh i believe sister gloriana is playing a uh um mandolin a mandolin so just make sure her mic is set up properly on that mandolin and brother zion to take the uh the keys praise the lord the brother azariah take the sticks god bless you all amen are you singing [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] is [Music] there's nothing to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] belongs to you and if you are for me who can be against me for jesus there's nothing [Music] impossible for you [Music] then all i see are the ashes you see the beauty [Music] when all i see is a cross guard you see the empty tube so when i find i fight on my knees [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll sing through the night oh god the battle belongs to your mighty fortress stand against the power [Music] nothing can stand against the power of our god you shine in the shadows you win every battle nothing can stand against the power of our god almighty fortress you go before us nothing can stand against the power of our god [Applause] nothing can stand against the power of our god [Applause] [Music] the battle belongs to you every fear i lay at your feet passing through the night oh god the battle belongs to you oh god the battle belongs to you [Applause] this the right mic change hats here real quick hey man so i think i'll try to start off with a bit of my testimony real quick of how i was felt the call into the ministry it was not something i'd ever really considered surprisingly enough since my dad is a minister but uh uh one year at stillwater's it was 2016. i had done an interview and i wasn't too happy with it because i usually do interviews and so after camp i had watched it and i was just thinking about it and i was thinking i could have said this i could have said this maybe if i would have said this a little different it could have helped someone a different way you know some this was in church when i'm thinking this so i'm sitting in church praying and thinking this and suddenly just this thought out of the blue comes into my mind is this the call to the ministry and it seemed completely unrelated but it just kind of hit me hard there and so over the next few months i was praying about it and then at believer's youth camp in 2017 i was still praying about this and then one of the services the minister had said something about being called in your life or being a being called to the ministry or your ministry and so this is heavily on my mind and then after a service one day like we're going to i think i was going to drop something off for a change after service into normal clothes and one other young brother who's also a minister was the only other brother in the dorm and so i walk in and he just out of the blue just walks up to me and says so your dad's a minister right i said yes he said so do you feel called to be the minister to be a minister and i'm just like uh i'm praying about it because he had nothing to prompt him i hadn't really talked with him before too much about that subject and then a couple days later at the same camp i'm thinking about it i walk out of service lo and behold i walk up on two of my friends who are talking about how one of them got called to be a minister and so then a few months after that just enough for me to kind of conveniently forget that all this happened my brother some brothers came and visited our church to i think it might have been a few different minister brothers and some that may have just been visiting and every now and then it'd be like oh so when's he going to preach you know talking to my dad just kind of since since my dad's a minister you know and i'm usually dressed in a suit and ties like oh when's he gonna preach you know just as a kind of a joke but then no it really meant something to me so finally after a sermon with brother nathan had been talking about being called i just was like okay i better go talk to brother nathan about this and then like three months later at watch night i was preaching watch night and i'm like this is not where i expected to be and now i'm here which is also not where i expected to be but we we praise the lord for it and for how he works differently in our lives if you have your bibles turn to me turn with me to matthew chapter 8 verse 23 is where i'd like to begin and then i'll read a few scriptures here and then turn over to hebrews 4 after this matthew chapter 8 verse 23 says and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there rose a great tempest in the sea and so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish and he saith unto them why are ye fearful or ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds in the sea and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds in the sea obey him and if you turn over to hebrews chapter 4 verse 9. just gonna read the i'm going to read on down to the end of this chapter but just for now so hold your place there but just for now i'm going to read on down to verse 11. verse 9 says they remain it therefore arrest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he hath also ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and if we could just bow our heads now lord i pray that you would just honor the reading of your word and pray that you would just help me lord to be able to get myself out of the way lord and that you would be able to use the gift in my life just help the words i say to be a blessing to the people and may you just come and you said wherever two or three are gathered together there you'd be with us lord so we pray that you would just come and be amongst us tonight lord just calm my nerves and help me to he said in your word take no thought what you shall say lord so i pray that you just help me lord to get myself out of the way and let you take complete control of the service we ask these things in jesus name amen you may be seated we'll come back to the other half of hebrews chapter 4 in a minute but before then i have a couple quotes i want to read brother branham says in faith is the substance he says this day that we're living in it's such a day of unsettled peace and unsettled rest everywhere people are running to and fro speaking whatever they may speak most anybody can get a following no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them and it's a day that the prophet spoke of i put all these quotes together by the way before all the political madness that's been going on this past week it was not even in my head when i was putting some of these notes together amen in the church age book in the tire and church age brother branham says each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the predator of riches soft living and the nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so what i want to speak on tonight is a simple little thought but it's i feel important and affects many of us is i just want to speak on rest so when brother branham speaks about the pressures of this each age uh he says that the pressures of the last age the age we're in now is nervous tensions in a complex age which and so the pressure of this age isn't just like it was in previous age in some of the previous ages during the dark ages where it was just like one and done like someone today put a gun to your head and say curse god or i'll shoot you it's not that kind of pressure that happens occasionally in some places but not very often here more what the pressure is today is just a daily nagging just compromise a little here compromise a little there just slowly eating away at you until there's nothing left of you and at that point all we have left to do is just to run to god but the scriptures promise rest and so in these times even with that constant nagging and eating away at us we can rest so back to hebrews chapter 12 so paul speaks of rest in the beginning of this chapter and then he goes on to say for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword in verse 12 piercing even through the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched but with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need so in this chapter uh in the chapter three of hebrews paul had been talking about the israelites and how that many of them uh were not able to enter into the rest because of the stiff necks their stiff necks and hardness of their heart only two out of the two million were that were supposedly following moses really truly entered into the promised land and entered into the rest because they were the only two that were fully into the word so he says that we have we can enter into the rest and then goes on to list all the reasons why we can enter into this rest he says we can rest because the word of god is quick and powerful he says god sees everything there's nothing hidden from his sight and we can go and ask whatever we need of the father because he has been in all points tempted as we are without sin so he there's nothing we may think that there's a pressure in our life that's great and like no one else has been through this like i have but god has been through this jesus came down in flesh so that he could be tempted in every way as we were so in in why are people so tossed about brother branham says i was saying somewhere maybe here a few nights ago i wanted to preach so bad i preached to my wife sitting in i sorry i preached to my wife in bed till 12 o'clock just telling her how glorious jesus was a text come in my heart it kept burning me so great till i just couldn't rest with it i just said honey i want to preach to you a little while and she roused up by grace she listened i said the christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right this quote always kind of amuses me i think it's pretty funny how just at midnight one night brother branham just wakes up his wife and she says i want to preach to you and he says the christian faith is based solidly upon rest and i can always think that the reply running through her head is what do you think i'm trying to do but still there's still very much truth to what he's saying the whole christian experience is based on rest we are supposed to rest have our faith rest in the word so i've been going to i started going to college about a year and a half ago and one thing i've noticed at college is many nearly all the students are struggle so much with stress and none of them seem to ever have much peace we have a place to rest that many of them don't have so in the book of job we see the story of job that he was able to rest amidst all his trials if anyone had reason to be stressed out of their mind it should have been job i'm not saying he didn't care he didn't immediately move on with his life and just say okay whatever he was i mean it happened it was rough but at the end of the day he didn't let himself be controlled by those pressures that happened at the end of the day it's in job chapter 1 verse 20 and 21 says then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord to our eyes what was going on to job in job's life if we had thought about like okay if this was me if this was happening to me like i think i'd be having like a complete total breakdown that would be incredibly difficult but he had a place to rest in job 19 chapter 19 verse 25 and 26 he says for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though that after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god he recognized that god was bigger than his problems he wasn't letting himself be controlled by what happened but he knew that god was in control because he knew that god was bigger than his problems if we let ourself get controlled by our problems what we end up saying is that our problems are bigger than god [Music] there was one time in brother branham's life he tells a story in life story where he nearly had a breakdown was after after the his first wife and sharon rose had died he went he had a very low spot in his life and he tells the story of how he tried multiple times to just end his life he couldn't take it anymore because the pressure was getting to him so much he says i said in in life story in 1951 he says i said oh god but in heaven somewhere you've got my little girl and there i was become i become almost frantic almost a mental collapse i took off my rubber glove he was working the on the power lines at this time he says 2300 was running right by the side of me i said god i hate to be a coward but sherry honey i'm daddy's coming to see you this morning as i laid my hand down on that wire he said why it broke every bone in my body how i don't know unless god had foreign that this gift should go forth next thing i knew i was sitting on the ground perspiration running off my faith my face i took off my spurs put them in the truck went down and went home as i went around the house i picked up the mail went around the house and a few months had passed turned cold weather frost was coming up through the floor there i wouldn't go nowhere i said we didn't have very much but what we had we she and i had lived together with it it was home sweet home to me i don't care how it was it was her furniture and i wanted to stay at home when i was in the house first letter i looked at miss sharon rose branham 80 cents christmas saving oh my it was all over again i knelt down on the floor there i started crying i said god please have mercy upon me i'll take my own life i've been a warden in the room i had a gun and i went in to get this gun and i'd put the shells in it and i pulled the hammer back on the gun i said lord i've gone wild i don't know i was out of my head i put it up beside my head like this i said our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name squeeze the hammer it wouldn't fall i said oh lord i can't even take my own life i threw the gun down it shot off throughout the house went on like that i thought oh god why i've gone crazy i've lost my mind in continuation of the story in a different tape the impersonation of christianity he says someone said when i come out of my great trial that time after i had lost wife baby and everything said brother branham did you keep your religion during that time i said no sir it kept me during that time so that's what it's for i can't keep christ he keeps me it isn't whether i hang on it's whether he held on and it's a gift to me another character in the bible we see is esther esther had every reason to be stressed and to just want to just go and hide probably in her chambers and not come out and not face the world she had the weight of the death of her people on her shoulders the thing was even if she did go and see the king as and the king didn't hear her if he didn't extend his scepter that not only would her people die but she would die as well so she had all of this pressure on her mind so what did all these people do in the face of this pressure we see that what brother branham said he said my religion kept me it isn't the fact that i held on it's that he held on joe knew he had that he his redeemer lived so they had something to hold on to during that time back to the students at college they have uh at my particular college and i think most colleges they they have mental health services so they have included into your tuition as they have uh certified therapist you can go and see and talk about things if you're dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety and so they're constantly reminding us that we have these resources and you can go see them and so uh in one of my classes i was hearing one girl talk about how much she enjoyed going and seeing her therapist she was talking about how great it was and how uh how this person just listened and didn't judge and you know let her know that it was going to be okay and things like that and helped her work through her problems and i'm sitting here listening to her think about this and i'm just like sounds just about like my dad i'm like i mean i have a parent i guess i have this this kind of relationship with my parents so i can go and i can talk about things that i have when i have problems in my life and another thing when i have problems in my life there's no better mental help you can get than the holy spirit if you wake up in the morning the first place you should be going is your knees to say lord help me through this day and you know that if you rest in him then you realize there's just nothing to worry about because he has it all under control brother branham says in a second-handed robe i'm so glad that we have a shelter the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe no matter how many bombs or how many anything else that were safe there so the world and the center not having this shelter or their safety place it's a shaking time i believe if i wasn't a christian i'd go crazy to thinking of what might happen at any time and with a house full of little kitties and everything i wouldn't know what to do but i'm so glad that i can stand in my house and introduce to them a shelter that no bomb could ever touch or anything else under the protecting wings of the lord jesus not by power but by my might not not not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord see that is our protection what it comes down to is that the lord is our shelter we don't have to worry every time we think like that something might happen you start getting paranoid and think especially with all the political craziness that's going on right now just like oh no what's going to happen what's going to uh like a few weeks ago or a few months ago and they're still figuring out who was winning the election what's going to happen who's going to win the election are there going to be more riots do we have to worry about more riots and getting i know there was a lot of riots uh close to where we live in louisville and so sometimes there's just like well we should be careful not to go over in this area you know might be a little dangerous but we realize that at the end of the day he is our shelter and our rest and we don't have to worry about it because he will provide for all of our needs first peter 5 7 says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you we can cast everything every care upon him because he will provide for all of our needs in james chapter 1 verses 2 and 3 he says my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so even if we start feeling stressed and under intense pressure there's always a reason that the lord does something and allows something into our lives with job it was he wanted job to know just how strong he was going to where was it going to skip it around here i think i'm getting ahead of myself in my notes but so back to job the reason that god did what he did in job's life is because he wanted job to know just how strong he was and just how much he could do that's why he allowed that test to come into his life so many times in our lives we fear tests so many times so we have this we have this you know this way of talking about it in the christian message world we usually call it a test or a trial well why do we call it a test a test in school is supposed to challenge you to see if you really know what you say you supposedly know if you do really bad on a test it shows that you probably need to pick up the slack a little bit that maybe you've been kind of skimping out on the studying lately maybe you haven't picked up the textbook in a while maybe you need to go back through it and pick up textbook and flip through some of the chapters you haven't read in a while so this dictionary.com defines test when you think of the normal definition of test as a set of questions problems or the like used as a means of evaluating the abilities aptitudes aptitudes skills or performance of an individual or group or an examination that's the normal when we think of like a school exam or a test this other definition that it has for test is the means by which the presence quality or genuineness of anything is determined a means of trial many times this is the reason we have trials in our lives it's because the lord is testing the quality of our walk it's testing the genuineness of how genuine we are in our lives sometimes it may just be like job where god is saying hey you're stronger than you think you can do you can handle this the lord isn't going to lay anything on your life that he knows you can't handle so you can know that if it comes in your life the lord has a plan and he'll help lead you through it brother branham says in the church age book again in the smyrnian church age he says this is and this is one of my my favorite quotes he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of us of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested what he did manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by coming to church and sitting in a pew every sunday that's not what he says by listening to more tapes this week than brother so and so no he says by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass [Applause] so many times when you're taking a test at school it's understandable that you'd be a little worried for the test because tests are never an easy thing and it's understandable like if you haven't studied for this test it's understandable that you're going to be nervous for this test so the best way to reduce test taking anxiety as they call it is to study and be fully prepared for this test so the bible says this study to show thyself approved before god so you should constantly be in the word and studying it so that when a test comes you are fully prepared for this brother branham says in 1953 in testimony raising dead boy he says oh i tell you the most marvelous thing that i've ever seen in my life is the greatest hours of my life is when i get up against a wall that i can't get over it under it or around it that's right and then i trust god and he opens the way and i go through the thing god takes you through it that's then when you come out on the other side it's like samson when he killed the lion when he got out on the other side when he killed the lion and he got the sweetest honey he ever eat out of that old carcass of that lion and sometimes if you overcome something by the grace of god it'll be one of the sweetest things that you ever tasted in your life isn't that right if you know spiritually what i'm speaking of sometimes when the lord brings us through a test when we're in the middle of the test we can't always see what it's going to be on the other side of the test when samsung was fighting the lion as he was talking about i don't think samson had any idea what was in store for him after he had defeated that lion but he came back through and he saw the honey in the lion and it was the sweetest honey that he has ever tasted so many times it's what it is with our trials in the midst of the trial it may look bleak it may look like we're not going to make it but god will open up the way and on the other side of the trial it will be the sweetest victory that we can ever feel in our lives so we know this we can rest because of god's love for us we can rest even during our trials we can rest in because we have the revelation of the message when the devil can try to come and dissuade us and tell us that all this isn't true or different things and different things in the bible but if we have the revelation that there's so much we just can't unsee once we have the revelation we can rest upon that revelation brother branham says in joseph meeting his brethren abraham called those things which were not as though they were because he was fully persuaded that what god had promised god was able to perform because he would have never made the promise unless he knew what was going to be see how we can rest upon his word then no matter how hard the storm blows what's contrary to it rests solemnly upon his word god said it who has seen the other side of the storm see so if you're sick just anchor your soul in the haven of rest if you're perplexed and distressed remember he said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world and he said all things work together for good to them that love the lord so just stay right there i'll read this part again that he says see how we can rest upon his word then no matter how hard the storm blows what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon the word god said it who has seen the other side of the storm we can't see the other side of the storm when we're in the middle of the storm god has already seen the other side of the storm we're bound here by time and we can't see into the future we don't know what god has in store for us but god knows the end from the beginning he's seen exactly where we're going to be after we come out of this trial and how much better we're gonna be after this and how much closer to him it could bring us brother branham says in contending for the faith that's as fair as i know for this is god's resting place for faith there's no other place that faith can divinely rest only in the word of god brother branham says in the in the previous quote he had said he said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world and he said all things work together for good to them that love the lord so just stay right there i remember one time we had uh i believe is when we were having some special meetings at our church earlier this year and one of the brothers that was preaching he came up and he was preaching from this verse all things work together for good them to them that love the lord and he said anything you can think of fits into this little three-letter word a-l-l any circumstance you may be going through any situation in your life it fits under all all things financial troubles all things spiritual oppression all things family members that are out in the world all things so when contending for the faith brother branham says there's no other place that faith can divinely rest only in the word of god true faith can't rest on a creed neither can it rest in a denomination it must rest on the word of god so we must be careful what we rest in once we know we can rest we have to be careful that we're not resting on the wrong thing it's possible that we could rest in our own in our own strength we could try to rest in our own abilities and we're not going to get very far we can even rest in our own message denominations like we can we can make our own little beliefs around the message and make our own little message creeds and try to rest in those but they're gonna fail just like anything else your faith cannot divinely rest in your pastor or just coming to church and sitting on a pew or how many tapes you listen to all those things are good and you should come to church and you should listen to tapes but your faith must rest upon the word of god you can't just rest upon the fact that you did all those things then you're just league a legalist it's not the fact that you did them that saves you there should be something inside of you that makes you do them it doesn't work the other way around so your faith must rest upon the word of god and the revelation of jesus christ brother branham says in the church age book in the patmos vision oh that people might come unto him and find that rest there's a cry in all hearts for that rest but the majority don't know the answer so they try to steal the cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds and dogmas but failing in that many tried drinking carousing in every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures there can be some satisfaction but in such there is no rest they smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves but there's no rest in earthly potions they need jesus they need the heavenly remedy the rest of the spirit then most of them go to church on sunday that is good but even there they have no idea of how to approach god and how to worship him jesus said that true worship was in spirit and in truth john 4 24. but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of god it puts up a santa claus at christmas and bunnies at easter where did they get that they got it from the pagans and made it part of church doctrine when one turns to the lord but when one turns to the lord and is filled with the holy spirit he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really begins to live and love god and worship him amen i was talking to a friend recently and he was telling me about what the lord had done in his life and how that up to a certain point in his life he had just been relying on what he could do and he thought he was doing good he really like he would he would go to youth camps and he would get a feeling of the spirit and anointing of the spirit on him he'd go and he'd go back home he'd be doing great he'd he'd be delivered of whatever was troubling him at that point and he'd go back home and he'd be great for about a good three months and then it would the cycle would start over again he just kind of starts slipping again because he was resting in his own self and the fact that he thought he had done it right and he had done all the right things but it says when one turns to the lord and is filled with the holy ghost he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really begins to live and love god and worship him it's not us working but it's christ living in us it's christ in you the hope of glory so many times we can try to rest in ourselves and what we can do we can't rest in just the fact that we identify as a message believer there were two million in the wilderness who followed moses that would have in you know in today's terms they would have been message believers but only two went into the promised land because those were the only two were fully committed to that word not just the name they weren't just carrying the name but they really had something on the inside of them where they were truly following and believed every word that moses said one interesting thing i in college one of the courses that was required was an ethics class i had it was a supposed to be some sort of philosophy humanities type class and i had a choice between philosophy and ethics and i made the wrong choice and picked ethics but one of the only christian philosophers we talked about which i was just like hey christian philosopher finally someone who's not an atheist we started talking about this guy his name was kierkegaard they all had really weird names but he was so he was a christian and he was talking about because all the philosophers were talking at this point in time talking about like what it really means to be alive and what like you know they use this word authenticity just like what does it mean to be an authentic man you know so but he defined it as authenticity is conceived as relationship between oneself and god and i probably wasn't listening much in class up to this point and then teacher said this and i'm like oh hello i hear truth nothing up to this point has been truth um so but so one of the things that this this man taught one of the this thinker he said that humans go through three stages and don't worry i have all a quote for all of this after so don't get scared that i'm talking about this philosopher he said that humans go through three stages an aesthetic stage an ethical stage and a religious stage is the names that he prescribed to them so the aesthetic stage is the stage of sensuous enjoyment just living for the flesh and living for yourself and what makes me happy right now then he said that and that's that's usually how people are born that's how babies are born there in this stage then there's the ethical stage which is realizing rules and conventions and striving to follow them so then you get and he was talking about in just a purely like natural thing and he said you know okay so babies grow up and they get older and they realize okay there's general rules of society generally you don't go around biting people generally you try to get along with people you don't just go up and steal their toy you know so by the time the kids are you know eight nine they're starting to realize this type of thing and many people then just stay there but he said then there's this religious stage which was the choice of a leap of faith to leave society behind and trust in god so it was moving beyond from just realizing what is going on and trying to mimic what is around you but into truly getting in a relationship with god so many times on the spiritual side many of us stay in this ethical stage that he called it and never truly make that leap into knowing god will grow up in a message church we'll look around we'll see okay we generally do these things we generally don't do these things so that seems to be what's good so i want to be good so that's what i'm going to do and i'm not going to do the things that would be bad but that's just doing it ourselves in our flesh and that's not what we should truly be resting in brother branham says in why are people so tossed about he says now speaking this there's two different types of christianity seems strange but i'll not say two different types i'll say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what god has said in his word and of jesus christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that god has given the man in his heart the one is intellectually is hungering he's feasting on god but his feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as can be no trials no storms bother them at all but they seem to have something about them that the people who are christians and trying to live for god admire that type of christian and i've often wondered lord what is it that these people have that others crave so much for and yet seem to fail to get it and i know that's a great question in all of our hearts who have served christ and i've never seen a person yet that ever once come to him except they afterwards they life never seemed right to them anymore if they ever left christ so we see that he's talking about these two groups of people and one has had a true experience with god and can rest and the storms of life no matter what kind of things come they can rest and nothing bothers them the other group they're only intellectually in it and they haven't had that real experience yet and so when something comes on them they don't know what to do they don't they don't have they're not standing on the solid rock so they're kind of blowing about as the winds would blow and they don't know what to do they don't have anywhere to solidly rest their faith but what they need to realize is how they need to have an experience with god and part of that is outlined in romans chapter 8 verses 33-39 he says who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us so we see that it's not us that are doing it it's christ that died christ is the one that died for our sins we need to cast all of our cares upon him and let him do all the work he says in verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither life neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord so when you get when you're going through a trial and the lord's allowed this to come on your life and it seems really hard you can remember these verses he says that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor all these things nothing can separate us from the love of god in 1950 testimony brother branham says our heavenly father who brought again jesus thy son from the dead and setting at the right hand of thy majesty tonight making intercessions for us poor unworthy creatures of the earth calling to us to come unto thee all ye that labor and heavy laden i'll give you rest rest from our worries rest from our sickness rest from our sins just give us rest he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out in the position of the believer in christ he says amen and you stand perfected because the one who died the innocent one the powerful one the overcoming one the accepted one in his own person returned in the form of the holy ghost and brings the believer into rest he says you stand perfected because the one who died the innocent one died and returned in the power of the holy ghost to bring you rest so it doesn't matter what's wrong with you because all that matters is what he was and he died and he can now live on the inside of you so all you have to do is get yourself out of the way and let him come in and live inside of you and he will bring you rest no matter what happened no matter what your life has been no matter what your life is currently no matter your past no matter the different things you've went through the holy ghost will bring you into god's rest you can think like maybe i went too far in myself there's might not be any chance for me anymore but if there's still the smallest desire in your heart to be right with god and for god to come and that you have the desire for god to come and help you then you haven't gone too far if there's a desire to be right then you have not sent away your day of grace in remembering the lord brother branham says but oh i'd like to say something if i can forget what i was and remember what he is if i can remember jesus if i can remember him at the cross if i can remember what he done for me and i can remember the hour that he washed away my sins and give me the holy spirit to guide me that i'm lifted above everything that holds this earth i'm lifted above every earthly thing into heavenly places in christ jesus where i can fellowship with him there in his presence forgetting what i ever was forgetting all my sins and everything because they're in the sea of forgetfulness forgetting all my past forgetting everything and remember that he made me his own by his own death he took my place and i that had not not a right to go nowhere but to hell he took my place and lifted me from hell he went there for me and he lifted me up by his grace abundance until now we are sons and daughters of god and we sit in heavenly places in christ jesus ever rejoicing and remembering him who brought us safe thus far and with pulsating faith in our souls pressing us and by grace he'll take me on god has placed all your sins in the sea of forgetfulness all of our cares we can cast upon him we can rest in his love nothing of ourselves we have to worry about about what my personality is maybe my personality that this makes this particular thing really hard or i tend to air in this into this way and there's this besetting sin because of my personality all of that is in the sea of forgetfulness if you have come and repented you can cast all your cares upon him and the lord will take care of the rest and why are people so tossed about brother branham says a christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at calvary that's right oh sickness may come and disappointment but the christian is at rest knowing this that god is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is and how it looks there is neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that's in jesus christ we're at rest just let the old ship toss any way she wants to the anchor holds praise he says brother brahm says in divine love i tell you my brother when god can wrap you in divine love there is peace in the valley for you then there is so we realize that all we have to do is just rest in the word the lord will come and he will take all of our cares and we don't have to worry about a thing one of the last scriptures here that i want to leave you with for tonight is second corinthians 4 verses 7 through 18. he says but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus christ shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes all things are for your sakes it's another one we can read everything into everything fits into that all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many re down to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so in this last quote i want to read here tonight is from calling jesus on the scene here brother branham says here this is him in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was god and the word is the same yesterday today and forever it's still just take this it's the remedy it's the medicine it's the cure for every breakdown it's the cure for every cancer it's the cure for every ailment it's the it's god manifest manifested in a word the word is god jesus said it's a seed the seed is being planted in the right kind of ground it'll grow exactly what it is and every promise will be produced we forget all about it know that he is in the ship says the disciples with jesus when jesus was in the ship and the storms came they were scared because they thought that jesus wasn't doing anything about it but what was what mattered was that he was in there in the ship with them he woke up and he said why are ye fearful because he was with them so they had no need to be fearful so let's bow our heads lord i pray that this little thought that you laid on my heart lord would be a blessing to the people lord and that they would remember lord that no matter what their troubles might be their trials that they can cast them on you and just have rest in your word lord and your holy spirit i pray that you would just be with us all tonight lord as we go our separate ways lord just bless everyone uh just bless brother jack lord and this church for allowing me to come down and give me this opportunity and then just lead us in guys in our lives lord we pray in jesus name amen [Music] bless you let's give the lord another hand of praise for [Applause] the zion um just a wonderful thought there tonight on uh rest and um and i just just appreciate the many of the things that he was stating and i'm gonna have to go back and get the three stages for the human uh joyous ethical uh where we begin to learn a set of rules and and how to abide by those rules and then this religious religious stage that requires a leap of faith and how he's taking you know just a natural thought there in school and just bringing it because even when we come into christ if we're not careful we'll learn all the rules we'll learn how to satisfy those that see us but we never really go all the way into that that place with christ that real that individual personal experience you know and we just want to make sure that we don't fall short you know of the glory of god but that was just a beautiful thought on tonight no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through uh the christian faith is based solidly upon rest oh my blessed be the name of the lord can we stand and just sing a few courses of this song oh as well all is well [Music] we have heard the message shalom all is where hallelujah there is a place of purpigras [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is world come on everybody say say all is well [Music] [Applause] hallelujah jesus we have heard the message shalom it all is well there is a place of perfect rest behind their soul [Music] come on one more time with all your heart as well thank you jesus all israel we have heard the message shalom and all is well there is a place [Music] as well hallelujah let's give the lord another hand of praise [Applause] so good to know that jesus is in the boat amen and you know those disciples as they begin to get a little worried uh they went to shake him and wake him it's like oh you don't have to do that you don't got to do that everything's going to be all right you know and and in church we don't have to be worried in this hour let's rest in our god and i love the way brother zion put that he says in that three uh letter word everything we're going through is inside of those three letters no matter whether it's a financial problem whether it's a physical problem whether it's an emotional problem whether it's a mental problem whether it's a material problem it don't matter what the problem is it's all inside those that three-letter word a-l-l and all things are working together for the good god how we appreciate you amen i wanted to also just announce uh we got word on yesterday's sister uh sister dixon had her procedure and uh she made a little video that she said say i told y'all god was gonna bring me through and we just thank god for just watching on my precious sister and keeping her uh during this procedure all is well all is well all is well and we just we just thank god for that so let's bow in a word of prayer amen as we prepare to dismiss them tonight father we thank you for the word of the lord tonight we thank you for uh brother zion and just getting himself out of the way and just allowing you to speak through him to us so much that we can carry from the sermon tonight and god the most important thing is that our christian experience is based solidly upon rest knowing that you have everything in control and god as he was saying that and the very first quote that he came out of the gate with lord was a quote that i had in my notes for new year's eve service and i didn't get a chance to read it and god i just thank you for how you come back and confirm and how you use other ministers lord to confirm our thoughts and lord i i'm also reminded of just this conversation i've been having lord with brother troy and just going through the book of job and here uh brother zion picks it up lord and just just preaches these thoughts right back to us and father it's just so good to know that you are god amen that you are certainly in control and father we just appreciate the word as we prepare to leave this place but not uh your presence may we go farther uh uh back to our home safely have a wonderful night of rest and oh god may you allow us to raise in the morning and god that we would be able to come back to the house of god uh refreshed and renewed and ready father for another service that you would use lord brother trevor to speak father in a very special way we know that you ordained this weekend before the foundational world lord and we're just so happy to be a part of what you're doing in this hour god we pray that you bless those that have joined us online and that you just watch over them and keep them god and just help them to also enter into that perfect rest father we love you so in jesus name we pray amen amen and amen let's give the lord one more hand of praise before we amen dismiss on tonight the lord bless you you may be seated the brothers will come at this time amen to dismiss us praise the lord service will start in the morning at 10 30 those that have joined us online may god bless you keep you and we trust that you'll be able to join us again in the morning [Music]
