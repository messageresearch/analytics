thank the Lord for His goodness to us thinking for allowances the air cannot to go we may bear for a few days there into South Carolina man the Lord blessed us they may have some really really good friends [Music] had some relatives that were open to having us come they've never met us one day in they life but they they they heard about us a man through their relatives and we're very open to having us come to this island a man I've never heard of it before Freeman a man it's in South Carolina I mean it's the last hour before you give into the ocean and a lot of to to nice golf courses I could just spent some time over and I just we just enjoyed ourselves there and there just just appreciate it make them feel just being so open to us it was just very very relaxing and I'm happy we got a chance to go away in and then come back probably were away we a man like brother Troy it just did a wonderful job just telling them how this appreciate how you know the Lord just use them and everything you know he was he been into talking about Elijah and and how they preach opened the young man's eyes and and then you don't have to breathe to open one person's eyes then they closed the eyes of some others and now we're living in the season where some people's eyes actually come open and other people's eyes are actually going closed absolutely that was a really really good you know just tight there and is talking about the veil and everything and actually what I'll do because there was something that happened brother Troy pitched at the end of his message he had mentioned something as you know it already closed things down and then he went into a more testimony and then I think he made a statement about just wanting people to see Christ in him right so there's after the very next day something happened where somebody saw crisis but here's a service brother Troy let you come in they made you close this out and you can share that testimony a man about that but God just proven himself in in so many ways a man here and I missed and I was just very grateful a man for for how that went a certainly appreciative of brother Willie on Friday night a man he did he did an excellent job here and we thank God for him from the Yukon a man the Yukon and if it if you get a chance that you're going out we have that that the map of the world there you can look in Canada look way up north a man you find that Yukon you can see where this brother come all the way down just to get to this church here to preach and some of the other churches in the area we're grateful for that right we're grateful I mean this message connects us with people all over the world and I mean you you you can and people just you know stand on the same word that you stand in and it's just very very encouraging and very just very inspiring so we thank God for that thought we just appreciate the Lord amen thank you all for your faithfulness amen and the service of the Lord while we were wait don't forget the tent means what you want to continue to keep that in prayer we're expecting God to do some great things a man I believe I have my praise team amen all is simple and and now what I'm what we'll do with the praise team out we'll get together we'll have to start having her CIL's a man on what we want to present there but I also just one also mentioned out brother branham calls personal workers personal workers we have anybody that desires a man and it's got to be something that the Lord calls you to you know because uh not everybody can just handle people and this is this is more than just you know watching people if they follow but this is really about being able minister to people you don't know who will walk through that ten you don't know what their conditions would be and now you don't know you know justice who they don't need just just to be there so we need man to do it man sisters to do with sisters a man but uh but you know these are things that you need to be praying it up you need to be ready a man for that so if you desire to just kind of be a personal worker a man just let me know they man what will work with you praise the Lord was telling my my wife you know we were just looking at some you know some things and I said one of these days it'd be nice to be able to just retire you know and things and I should say well I heard that you you never retired for ministry you just passed away so you know what you're right about that I mean it's probably not gonna happen like that but as long as I got breath of my body I'm gonna do something for the Lord and and I look forward to doing it a man for the Lord so but we we want to encourage if you if you want to be a part of any of that we want to encourage it please let us know and then we're just trying to have everything lined up in order as we go out there and we'd be doing things a little different than what we normally do but a man that I think the situation kind of calls for that so we just want everybody just to be be prepped and ready amen so god bless you I a man will read a scripture Thank You news issues I appreciate y'all amen thank you so much all the specials that went forward thank you all for that as well they're grateful and man for the anointing that is in the house a man from the first song just anointed and just appreciated it feel good to come to church and then feel good just to be in the presence of the Lord Amen well today a man is celebrated all over as Palm Sunday a man is Palm Sunday and and just waiting on the Lord for a sermon and then a little thought here and I felt like a gift gift it's giving me something a man that goes right along with Palm Sunday a man we want to just read the scripture and just kind of get into just the word Lord for this I you can stand with me and just turn with me to Matthew 21 also brother Henry Pompeii he called a man and said he just wasn't sent his grievance to the church and he say playing those coming to see us on next Sunday a man for Easter so a man keep him in prayer and everything but he just wanted to give his greetings and respect his regards to you Matthew chapter 21 we've been working for a number of different sermons here I have a book of Matthew a man and so Matthew 21 is where we will come from today and it says when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and we're coming to Beth Beth phage onto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find and as tied and a Colt with her loose them and bring them unto me amen and if any man say I'll come to you you should say the Lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion the holder king Viking cometh unto the meek and sitting upon an ass and a Colt the foal of an ass and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them out just so that we were clear because I might not get a chance to mention us later on but when it says sitting upon and asked and and a Colt the foal of an ass that was the the the asses child right this would be the the the the mother's child the phone right this is the child okay so I want you to get that and and I and I know that when we look at these things hopefully you know more just kind of bring it out a little bit later but just understand you know that's what it was it's the mother a man and then her her folder which is her her son okay this is what Jesus is riding here and disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them another thing I don't know if it said it here but uh actually this was the coal the coat or this was his first time have any writer okay so his his first ride is to carry the King of Kings right to carry the Lord of lords Oh glory to God a man a man and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the coat and put on them their clothes and they set him there off and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way now we will catch this also later there was three groups here there was one group that was waiting for him another group that was was not looking forward to him coming and then another group that didn't know what to believe right so this group that was waiting for him this is what they did and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strew them in the Wayne and the multitudes that went before when that follow cried saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna and the highest and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee amen the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word les BAU a brief word of Prayer amen and before we go into I thought today father we thank you for the privilege the ability to read the Word of God but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us to understand what it is that we are reading so we pray that God you would give enlightenment that you would give revelation understanding to these things that we've read today may you bless this thought that you have given and God may may the sick be heal me the bow be set free God may let the Holy Spirit pour out and feel those that are looking for filling those they're looking for a refilling God moved by your spirit we don't want to ever try to control you but we want you to have your way God in the midst of this service so be glorified and be magnified and exalted in our midst thank you for everything that's happened thus far and now God take the liberty a man over the Word of God as it is preached today in Jesus name we ask it a man need to be seen so we want to take for our title a man this morning who is this a man who is this and certainly this is a title that the Prophet has used multiple times a man and you know and one of the sermons he actually titled who do you say this is I'll be using a lot of quotes a man today from that particular sermon and if I don't get to the quotes and certainly a lot of my inspiration a man is being pulled from that praise the Lord and I will love you know we'll just kind of address it from there but uh as we as we look at this question who is this that's what they were asking here in the scripture as Jesus was entering into Jerusalem on the back of this this animal a man and and and they're seeing the commotion seeing the noise they're seeing you know so much happening they they ask that question who is this a man as he was entering and and and today I want to kind of address this question you know from three different angles if I can today I want to use three different subjects a man the first of our subject today would be Christ himself amen Christ was the Messiah he was the anointed word of that day and he's done or that word of every day but yet he's not recognized right he wasn't recognized in and he's still not recognized the day right by most of the church world the other angle or the other subject that I want to present to you is that the Prophet a man brother William Branham was also the anointed word for his day and I can also use the word Messiah because that means Anointed One praise the Lord amen so he was the he was the Anointed One or he would be the Messiah Anointed One for his day right but yet he was not recognize now that's that's that's the third I mean that's the second subject but the third subject a man is I want to try to bring out to you today that a man there is another Messiah or anointed ones or Messiah if I can put it that way there on the earth today that was shipping under the revelation sent by Christ through his prophet for the day and they're not recognize a man so the question is who is this a man who is this when we talk about Christ who is just we're talking about his prophet who is this when we talk about his Brides Lorre to God all right so stay with me here today I want to start with a quote out of the 70th week of Daniel Amen the 70th week of Daniel the prophet gives us something here a man says now Gentiles was not a lot at any certain time a man G just just that time of the Gentiles and we find out even Jesus didn't like them a time but we find out here in Luke 21:24 he said they shall trot down the walls of Jerusalem until the the gym sock let me quote that said I'm quoting it just by memory let me read it because it'll be on tape here and we want to be sure to get it right all right if you want to turn with me to it on st. Luke 21 and verse 24 I studied this clearly as best I could said and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away who's he talking about Jews that's the destruction of the temple in AD 70 and they shall be led away captive into all nations now remember not just down in Babylon not just over in Rome but to all nations that's where the Jew is today all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled now while I was there in in Israel you can see that Mosque of you know Omar I believe they call it that's that they're the Dome of the rock I mean they they have this built there and where where where they have this built is the same place where Solomon's Temple was built right so here you know this scriptures actually been fulfilled because here the Jews are supposed to have that God gave them that but because they were taking out a land for their unbelief and all the other things that they did God has allowed this scripture do you feel that it would stand there if this until I mean it was standing until the time of the Gentiles people feel but God didn't tell us exactly when the time of the Gentiles were gonna be filled it's just supposed to stand until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled now for my understanding and I think it could have been about 50 years ago or something like that but when when the the Jewish people went back into Jerusalem they had they're gone into Israel but they had not gone back into Jerusalem and when they went back in Jerusalem to proclaim that Jerusalem was their capital this was the people of Israel that did this when they when they went there the Muslim leaders at that time said that hey we would like to give you all you know this this piece of property here with Solomon's Temple well said we'll just give it to y'all and the the leaders of the Jews at that time said no we don't want you to give it to us and now many that Israelite people were wondering the Jewish people like why did I lead us say no to these people they were giving us back the land we know that we want to rebuild Solomon's Temple if we want to do everything for while they say no when it was going to be given I mean when they say they give it to us but they didn't understand that God's war had to be fulfilled right I mean it had they had to stay there until the time of the Gentiles had been finished a man when that man said no he had no idea he was fulfilling the Word of God hallelujah right so you know God God allows things they men like this to happen and and uh as we go brother Branham says in this quote said then there is a lot of time but nobody knows when it will be it says it's a mystery see the Gentiles time but Jews and we cannot tell time by what the church or whether that's where the weather's going weather is going on or what it's doing you can't tell by that but look at the Jews there's the time do you see it God did lock them exactly a day in our and time but he never he never the Gentile he did the Jew so let's watch the Jews then we'll see where we're at now the seven weeks was 49 years we got it clear now one week is one week in seven years one week seven years now he says while stood you so now we just had something tremendous happen amen at the end of last year our president decided that he would join Israel and stated at Jerusalem as their capital not Tel Aviv now now now that everybody else has made Tel Aviv their capital and one brothers say I haven't even found the word Tel Aviv the city Tel Aviv in the Bible right so so Tel Aviv is not their capital Jerusalem is their capital right so well so when the president has joined up with them to establish that a man that was they said a very significant move and it happened 50 years which is 50 years as they do believe right so it happened 50 I mean they they bent the Jews themselves have been ins in Jerusalem for 50 years and cleaned it by themself they stood alone right saying that this is my capital and 50 years later the United States is the first country that actually joins them and says yeah we recognize that that's your capital and everybody talking about you know how you know we got to watch out for terrorism and all these things but I'm gonna tell you when if God is behind something and God has blessed something then I you know if God is forced and who can be against us hallelujah Amen when you stand on the word you gotta worry about nothing else hallelujah amen so you know we see these things and these are very significant signpost force let us know that we're getting closer and closer to the second coming of the Lord now I'm going to skip a man in this in this this message here I'm going to go down to paragraph 80 and I just actually you know I tell you what don't don't worry line up who do you say this is for me and it's going to be a paragraph 187 just just as a a paragraph what paragraph 80 said I'm only reading a portion of this brother and say now now Jesus Messiah rolled into the city of Jerusalem triumph on the back of a white mule on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30 Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 80 30 now now he mentioned 80 13 that quote but a couple quotes down you know he also says 80 33 in which I believe it was actually a t-33 quarter two historical records that Jesus went riding in a man on this on this donkey a man in on 80 and 80 33 and now when he took this ride amen and proclaim you know they're proclaiming that blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord these people had a reason for doing that they had they had purpose for doing that you know but but as he was being proclaimed as a king you know here that they're laying out their garments and they're taking palm branches with Rett which represent victory and they're laying that before him and he comes riding in yet oh he comes riding in on that fulfilling a prophecy that was written in Zechariah amen I want to just kind of set us up here let's try to get that in our mind as to what the scene looks like and we're going to go here - who do you say this is the Prophet tells us some things here that we want to just try to catch and then says now in our text it was near the Feast of the Passover was going it was an awful time people were sleeping on the outside of the gates every Passover did this they was outside laying on the ground the ends was all full and everything it was the Passover there was great expectation in there that air was all filled he says he says everybody was all charged look he said there's three classes of people there hallelujah so there was a great expectation they know that this strange man was coming up to this feast and see they expected everybody to be at the feast hey man so there was an expectation because they knew that Jesus was in the land so they were expecting him to the feast the right says they know that this strange man was coming up to this feast some of them loved him a man they believed him some of them hated him most of them hated him and because one loved him and the other hated him the middle man didn't know what to do glory to God now I want to tell you that those three groups exist in every situation it man you ask something that's gonna be for you hello somebody and then you have something that's gonna be your gift and you're gonna have others that don't know what to do they don't know which side to be them they can be persuaded by anybody hallelujah amen but when it comes to this word you better know whose side you leaning on glory to God hallelujah amen I gotta hear brother Branham say that is human nature God has made people to be that way with some time to get to situation they know exactly where they stand even a part or they against it and then some time to get your situation they don't know which way to go human nature is that Oh hallelujah this is what was happening here on this day Amen said some of them loved him most I mean some of them hated him most of them hated him and because one loved him and the other hated him the middle man didn't know what to do see they didn't know notice the air was full of expectations one thing when he gets up there I tell you well column will give him a word test will stand them up there by the high priest would see what his wisdom is against Caiaphas he had already proven that see prove that see but we'll do this well I said now I know that some of the great leaders would take a hold of him boy they'll turn that old guy inside out see they were looking for Jesus to try to you know try to maybe maybe show the people that there was nothing to him said they'll let him know what he was when they go to puling with our priest boy they know what they're doing they're smart man they know what they're doing so that means the priests were preparing for Jesus to come oh my god they were actually I mean you got people preparing for Jesus the priests preparing for Jesus you say other said I wonder what they will do with that guy anyhow other said oh I'm waiting for him to come God is with him he is that word oh I just want to see him see oh they were divided now see the ones that didn't know him and believed him they would have no what gate to wait it my god the ones that did know him and believed him they would have known what gate took to way that see they know which away he was coming there's great expectation but you know there wasn't too many saw him see there's many didn't see him so is it today now let me go on a little further he says here some of them say he's a good man oh there's nothing wrong with him like Napoleon Washington he was a good man but oh uh as a teacher no no no some of them said oh he's a good man oh he's just all mixed up that's all he's a good fellow nobody can say nothing bad about him other said he's a devil I can tell you that that there there mine read and stuff and all this stuff other stuff that's false prophecy is compared to our Creed don't you believe such a mental thing is that and the other said glory to God is God I'd know him and they were waiting now that's just the way we stand today but the same thing the one anointed for this hour the latest in the legacy of searching now I'm going to tell you only a prophet could actually dig him to a scripture like this and pull all these things out and put us on the scene so we can see you know what we're looking at now there was there was these three groups so there was one group that waited for him and there was that waiting for him they began to spread their garments in the paths as he's coming you know on the back of this animal they're spreading their garments in the path there they're breaking palm branches in there they're strong I just landed in linen and especially he can just kind of walking treat them like royalty freak them like a king these were the ones that were waiting for and as they retreated them like that they began a yell and scream hallelujah they were excited and when they saw coming they begin to yellow screen Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord now you know I was enemy famous and here they are you know screaming it's out but I got I got I'm grateful for what they did but I got bad news for you amen the same group that screaming out Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord it's the same group one week later begin the crowd crucify him it's amazing how 10 tell you one week later crucify him glory to God Church hey man so you know sometimes we just don't get caught up in people's emotions hey man we want to know what's really in your heart that's what we're trying to discern what's really in your heart because it made you a change like that there's something don't go your way soon as the word come against you Amen you ready to Christmas somebody hey man not that mine I mean I ain't going to that search no more that's how they crucify the word today come down your street Amen just receive it because God loves you yeah yeah Hosanna save us blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord and now now you know John 12 verse 17 through 19 you know John 12 actually gives us the same mom you know tells us about this this this story it's actually recorded in all four Gospels Amen but I want to just kind of pick up John 12 verse 17 through 19 so you can understand why so they were um the expectation look at this junk junk 12 verse 17 says the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead their records for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle amen so because of the America that they saw with Lazarus it raised their expectations and that's where their was hitting their waiters I mean if that guy can do that but Lazarus what can you do for my loved one right I want to be there waiting for this man I want to take my clothes and lay them in front of my water I want to put my man I want to break up a branch office and just wave at the person now blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord right that's because of what he had done this is why the people where I'm an expectation waited for but now I want you to I want you to look at verse 19 here because there's another group that didn't want to see them or if they saw them they had some things they wanted to do with them first nineteen says the Pharisees therefore said among themselves but CD how ye prevail nothing the whole the world is going after him they realized that with this great commotion they was in church brother Branham say you know you can see them maybe the Sadducees in one corner the Pharisees another and they all dressed up and get ready for you know Passover and everything ready for the service and here outside the church all this noise going on this man coming on the donkey and there's so much noise at the church that the Pharisees got left the church when I find to see what's going on and that's when they begin to ask the question well who is this like y'all didn't know you knew who it was like you didn't know hallelujah and if you didn't know that people had an answer for you the people said that the multitudes that this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee I want you to also let's pick up something over here in Luke 19 again I say this is found in all four Gospels Amen you were finding in Luke 19 you'll find it in John 12 you finally to Marky 11 we ran out of Matthew 21 but this same story is told in all four Gospels now let's look at these Pharisees and Sadducees there they're already getting a little jealous because I feel like everybody's going after him and I look at look at them and when they don't want to hear it they try to silence the word now Luke 19 verse 39 a man who says in some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Him master data cycles they were they were trying to get him to quiet the crowd a man get the crowd not to say nothing right I mean because the people you can just imagine the shouting and the resource it holds ever blessed it is he that comes in the name of the Lord now let say I mean if he had done something for you if the ant does something for you then no piracy or no Santa si would be able to stop you from giving him praise hallelujah right so I mean some of these people they was not gonna be silenced they was not gonna be quiet it's a man they had a praise on the inside and no matter what anybody else said they knew what he had done with him and you can sit there and be cute if you want to but he's done so much for me I can't help but sing Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord oh lord help me Jesus but you know as we as we look more at that scripture verse 40 you know Callie's telling me telling him he says now master rebuked by disciples I know you think pretty much saying you can get control of the crowd we can't we do command telling the hush it's Passover but look at what Jesus says and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out can I say something I don't know I tried out for me so I'm here to kill him please I'm here to give him go I'm here to kill him amen I let the rock ride on my bless His name glory to God search I tell you what I you know you think about this this whole scene and what's what's really going on here you know I'm in a they're worshiping they're praising it's so excited and here that the Pharisees that didn't want him there the Sadducees now yeah yes they were expecting because they were gonna try to maybe maybe put on a shame before the people right they they were good they were good they were gonna try to let them know you know who they were right but but he had a way of coming in so meek so lowly so you know so unexpected to them but yet he was fulfilling Scripture in the way that he came the Pharisees you know over in Matthew 21 now when they when they come out to church right when they come out of the church and they they see all the multitudes a man I met verse 9 verse 8 amen and Matthew 21 says and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and screwed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest a man and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this now you know before I go further a man with that I was I'm very grateful when I look at this and I see a man this saw you know that the Bible calls to the animal is it's a horse but it's called an ass right but it's just a really good not a nice horse right and but but here the Bible tells us that you should find an ass and a coat with her right loose them and bring them unto me right so so I I want both the mother and the son hallelujah and notice I've told you at the beginning amen this was a man that the first ride a man bought this coat it was the first time somebody was gonna sit on the back of this coat now I don't know what you know maybe what things the mother might have went through her pregnancy I don't know a man if she had some danger sighs but maybe she's like how to bathe with bring forth disco but this coke was predestinated this cult had a very specific purpose nobody had ever written its coke before and Jesus had told that it's like was that you don't find times you don't find like this and they got approached you think I ask you what you need wonder will you do this for he said just tell him the master have need of them or the LORD hath need of them evidently if he could say this to them that the Lord had need of them evidently these are people that was waiting to see the Lord because they had no problem giving up a man both the mother and the son and I love this because if a man this mother gets the opportunity to watch her son carry the King of Kings to watch a son carry the Lord of lords I began to think to myself I say if God can be that concern about a horse how much more concerns here about a mother that wants to see a child take the first ride with the Holy Ghost amen [Music] how much more concern is Popeye wants to see you you see your children take a ride with the King of Kings with the Lord of looks when you bless them with a car you ain't gotta worry about them doing something not supposed to be doing they got the right passengers on the other sides they riding with the King of Kings in a ride and that's a load of Lords because the Holy Ghost is pulling on the inside if God is that concerned about an animal how much more concern is he about you and your children hallelujah I'm waiting for them to take their hearse ride hey man wait for them to get filled with the Holy Ghost their first touch glory to God that's what we're on the expectation for use them the LORD hath need of them all right as this great multitude is there gathered the Pharisees were in church Sadducees in church and they heard all the noise and they come out of church they begin the hell what is this who and and as they as they as they as I see you know everything going on they approach in Matthew 21 and they say well who is this who who is this now the people answer the people as I said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee but but I'd like to step into the scene if I could because they're asking a question and I feel like somebody ought to be bold enough and then to stand up and give an answer who is this and I'd like to take my opportunity to give an answer and then you want to know mr. parish dear mr. sad you see who is this well my answer is that this is the fulfillment of Moses prophecy the LORD thy God will raise up unto the apartment from the midst of thee of thy brother's like unto me and unto Him he shall hearken a man to Donna 18 verse 18 through 19 says I will raise him up a prophet among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak them to them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which is just be a morning I will require of him you want to know who this is this is the fulfillment of Moses of prophecy amen Psalms 23 1 you want to know what it is I want to give an answer this is David Shepherd Davis said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want I want to tell you who it is this is David Shepherd amen I also want to tell you that this is the fulfillment of genesis 3:15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and Holte a woman don't care you see a woman carries it out how can it be her seed because there was only one woman they everything that a man to a child not being impregnated by man this is the fulfillment of the woman see according to Genesis 2:30 if you want to know what is this is the RAM that was in the bush Baberaham I'm in Genesis 22 verse 13 and 14 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt open in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place she over tyra honey because you show profile' here's his macho helmets IRA he's watching over me see he's much older to me Chloe the cards a man he's also found in numbers 24:17 a man and numbers 24:17 Balaam should have been proper sign anyway the alleluia relevé I'm saying ammo Bayon tribe to curse them the mo God blessed him and the more each other curse shoot the makeup brushes shoot please God the mone trauma closed doors pop it in all controllers hey there [Applause] glory to God a man said I shall see him but not now I shall behold him but not 9 they shall come and start out of chica and a scepter so lots out of this world and it's just like the corners of Moab and destroy the children of now you review the reason you need assets is because you can't approach the king unless the king possess a scepter hallelujah if you go into the King's presence without imposing the scepter that was spelling sure is death so before we could approach God we needed a scepter and Jesus Christ was the center you want to know who he is I'll tell you who he is a man he is the fourth man that was in the fiery furnace III I'll tell you who he is Joe asked the question he's jokes if I know my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth this is job's ratima he's the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy Isaiah 7 and 14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and he should and shall call his name Emmanuel Isaiah 9:6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful I'm the reason I'm here is because what he did for Lazarus I mean he's wonderful right he's the counselor the mighty God the everlasting father this is the Prince of Peace you want to know who he is I'm telling you who he is who is this the last thing I want to tell you about him a man he was on his ride into Jerusalem that day he was the fulfillment of Zechariah 9 and 9 a man zechariah 9:9 says rejoice greatly o daughter of Zion shout and that's exactly what they were doing shout o daughter of Jerusalem oh my can I just eat man you know it's okay that we come and we enjoy the Word of God remember one day everybody gonna be in an atmosphere hey man it's gonna be a little different not not not to sit down and just worship but I'm talking you're gonna get you're gonna shout you can't shout number Amen you can shout a man and not as other got got a real shout hey man they can actually what we call color step and the word itself will make you cut a step the word will make you cut a step alright rejoice greatly zechariah 9:9 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shall go to jerusalem there all thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a Colt the foal of an ass hallelujah this is who he is that's the a man the answer to the question for those Pharisees and Sadducees but as I said you know this this this this has a strange way of this question has a strange way of repeating itself because a man we can bring it forward to today and we can apply this a man to some others we want to apply to the Prophet one applied also a man to you today if we can let me just go to a quote here out of who do you say this is you all bear with me lowly to God hallelujah amen um let me let me think about that yeah let's let's go here paragraph 206 thank you Jesus can I go there actually you know what I yes I'm good I've just got to set this up for you then I got to come back to it so it says here now watch now here he comes riding into the city just exactly what the word said he would do zechariah 9:9 we just pulled it out that's what the word promised that he come fulfilling the word and the people's to have a question who is this look at it it says just exactly what the word said he would do riding on a little donkey coming into the city those who were not looking at the Creed not looking at the temple not looking at all these other things not looking at the priests what they had to say those that believed him they were standing there with palm in their hand just waiting the first move you never heard them saying who is who's this coming oh no they knew who was coming they know what the word said see and the other class sees him back in the city and then when they heard this noise Hosanna to the king Hosanna to the king that comes in the name of Lord hosanna hosanna and all the screaming the priests run out to see what this religious commotion was about and the people said who is this what were they what were they therefore friends the religious feasts the very God that had them to ordain this feast told them that he be there just like that and they cry who is it notice this time hasn't changed people are designed the same way as they was then Hebrews 13 and says he's the same yesterday today and forever now I'm gonna I'm gonna close by saying this the question isn't to them anymore they asked who it is he says but in 1964 I want to say in 2018 the question is who do you say it is what's this all about have you stopped to search the Scriptures oh my god because many of us stopped to search Google but have you stopped to search scriptures right have you stopped to search the scriptures who do you think this is is it mental telepathy is it is it some wild something out of the wilderness down to somewhere like they said John was a while a man while drowning people in the world out there when Isaiah said said he be there the forerunner Malachi said he would be there just exactly them prophecy said this pup will rise up here support run it and here he was I'm just gonna stop there I gotta come back to that quote because as brother branham just turned the corner now in this in that message you go back and listen to it he makes a statement he says we are building a man we're not building a wall we building a building he says and when you're building a building he says sometimes a man you have to turn a corner and send out now anybody you can get anybody off the street just to kind of lay brick on top of brick on top of brick on top of brick you can teach them that little part of the trade and they can they can put a hole for your no problem he says but when it's time to turn a corner you don't want just anybody trying to turn a corner you want a real brick mason you want a man that's a professional at that now you turn the corner and that's you get the corner turn now they can there's a brick on top of brick on top of brick but don't put no man that don't know how to turn corners then my house would be all all messed up my walls will be all off still I just had a mess on my hands he say say what we're doing is we're prepared to a man turn a corner man he said all that in this Sunday there's a lot of lot of nuggets in this sermon if you go back and listen to a lot of nuggets in there my god but he said time hasn't changed and I hear here he's presenting this story a man took you know so this church there in Phoenix and he's preaching this and this is his last sermon before he inches into 19 amen in 1965 which was the last year he was on the earth his last sermon of 1964 is who do you say this is back in Matthew 16 who do you say that that when Christ actual question who do you who the man say I am and they say oh you realize you probably wanted to promise you the issue that you didn't yeah you know that's what they had that my head knowledge right but but when revelation struck come on somebody we're not trying to operate off head and I was reading revelation a man like brother Willis say the devil will defeat you with head knowledge but with a revelation nobody can ever take it from you hey glory to God dance can't take it from you family can't take it from you nobody can take Revelation from you you know no no they can't take it because they didn't get it hey I love that old song say the world in the world big world didn't give it and the world came take it away amen hallelujah hallelujah but say they were that you know when you when you look at this Jesus acts in that question you know who to me Sam Danny turned said now who do you say I am and when revelations drop that's when Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of living God say blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father in heaven has glory to God so we back at this now and we understand who he is from a scripture step one we know who Christ is but now let's try to take it a little further we got to take it further y'all stay with me I might go over time a little bit to this that's alright okay hey man I would go over time just a little bit I want to make sure to get home glory to God but you you got it you got to know who it is and you got the search scripture if you ain't picking up your Bible to reach you have no idea what I'm saying you you have do not you just can't go off of what everybody say searched scripture listen listen now I want to just set this up you said there are three classes of people all right and he identified these three three three classes of people Oh glory in the word in the realm of politics you said now there's a group that is truly supportive of a presidential candidate man they stand behind and they want to see that guy when they got they'll put their money into it they do everything they can to make sure that guy wins right there's another group that's directly against that candidate and brother I'll say that group we'll call them a renegade right it says then there's another group that's in between them they don't know what to do they don't know whether to be for them or against them saying that they don't know what to do and since they don't know what to do they won't go out and vote form they won't vote eclairs I mean I guess I'm not voting for me exit vote against them but you don't know who to choose so you just choose anybody knowing I mean people right in Mickey Mouse on the ballot right because they don't know who to choose you know they they put Superman right I mean they write anything on the ballot but but this is what happened they get they get caught in between now now here's the tears of Davis Park the ones that get caught in between are the ones that can rip them they're dangerous territory oh man you got to stand for something it'll be all stand for something you'll fall for anything all right a man sir Provenza that's the way human beings are and it had to be that way in that day in order to fulfill God's great economy that is three he used three three classes that's tight the scripture to believe it I don't believe in the make-believe he said Adam was a believer he knew to stay with that worked right Adam with Adam's sin he willfully went out of stand but Adam knew to stay with that word he says Satan was an unbeliever that's why I began to reason with the Word of God he said but but but actually he lied he was preaching lies to Eve and say Eve was the one that was in between she was not sure and he said Eve typed the denomination of church up today because she turned to the surely you will not surely die Adam knew Steve you better stay away from there chicas God said you gonna die right but she said no he said we won't surely die and say she turned towards the shulie she was the one that was in between oh you got if you have no where you stand on that today now I want to go on a little curvy see he had made a statement here in Moses day they have these three groups it says Moses Joshua and Caleb were the believers of that day he says but Satan anointed Dayton and Korah and they represented the unbelievers of that day and their unbelief caused many to perish in the wilderness right they were caught in between alright so so is this so so close that gap underneath the anointing of date to the quorum in the dine lose their lives now stay with me say now he said that now there should be three so I'm gonna give you a third we say Balaam represented the denominational make believer oh my because Balaam what he did a man he walked right across the perfect will of God Balaam and then walked over every warning that God gave him Balaam was a money loving false prophets it says and the more Balaam crushed him the more God blessed them so you had those three groups but when he looked at Moses Joshua and Caleb has to believe us he said something else about Moses in this message said Moses was the anointed word for his day making him the Messiah for his day he was the messenger of the hour thus making him the Messiah of the hour Moses was now you got to stay with me cuz you know here here they missed they missed Jesus they misunderstanding Moses a man at just everyone that he said nor was also the anointed word for his day the Messiah for his day The Anointed One and saying every day God always got a messiah on the earth and that's why I'm telling saying when brother Branham was here he was the anointed word for his day so unless everyone who was brother Branham I'm gonna tell you he's the fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 and 6 the whole I was send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord I'm not telling you what Google said I'm telling you what the Bible saying a matter he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and a hard to chew them to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse whose brother branham he is the fulfillment of revelation 3:14 and after their angel the Church of the latest years write these things that the Amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of a of God who is pehla pehla he's the fulfillment of Revelation 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound for mr. God should be finished as he hath declared for his servants the prophets who is brother Branham he's the fulfillment of Revelation 18 and though and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues whose brother Branham he's the fulfillment of Jesus prophecy in Matthew 17 verse 10 through 13 and if seven disciples acts up saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come verse 11 and Jesus answered this is one that Jesus spoke about jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things who is brother Branham he's the one that Jesus was talking about that was supposed to come and restore all things oh all right let me go on to who do you say this is I'm not done yet I gave you now if you notice I gave you about nine scriptures for Jesus I gave you five scriptures for brother Branham and I'm gonna give you some quotes and scriptures for yourself who you say this is paragraph 70 stay with me stay with me Laurie to God the church seen him in his great power of manifesting manifesting what not manifest my Creed he was manifested in the word he was the anointed Word himself and when they seen that taken place the manifestation he anoints at Messiah they turned it down they didn't want it it wasn't in their taste that's the pitiful part I mean just think of it just as another days see each had their own interpretation of the word the the reason Israel didn't recognize Moses that Moses I mean that's the reason that the world didn't recognize Noah the reason all the prophets wasn't recognized they had their own interpretation of the word but God in every age has had his Messiah to reject Noah's message was to reject God gonna heaven rejecting the message you've gone in a rapture rejecting the message who was in the boat the ones that accepted it and the ones that didn't accept it dry all right church you want to know who this is I'm trying to tell you about scripture all right to reject Noah was the practice to perish to reject Moses was to perish they were The Anointed Messiah for that age the word that was promised for that age and when Jesus came he was the fullness of the word God Himself made into a man structure with bones and flesh the Anointed One these are key statements God Himself made into a man structure with bones and flesh now I'm not leaving it just with Jesus I'm not leaving it just for the Prophet I'm trying to put it in you God Himself made into a man a woman structure with bones and flesh I'm just not looking at this brother soaring soaring sister sword so can I be honest I'm look my god I see you I see them although I'm looking at God each one you're caring the part of God you make up the body of Christ somebody and the only part of the body is just as important as the other part who is this this is God in flesh God Himself made into a man structure with bones and flesh The Anointed One and they should have seen that but see their church their church world had added I have so added to here and taken away here and so forth until it was so messed up till they've trusted in the church - instead of the word didn't that brother just tell us that on Friday night my brother started asking some questions about baptism and everything said man I'm glad you brought up he's and start talking to them back why people baptize the name of Father Son Holy Ghost ain't nobody ever and about Bobby and Beth have said when you say well you say well you you you show me in the Bible some other baptize all the way okay I got many scriptures you wrote them all down said man look at Rick look at this man went home and ready ready yeah the Bible say that the Bible said but after he finished reading he went to this priest ice preachers pastor say pastor what you think about this to say now we have no record we have no record recorded record of this of any of these things we don't know of that and say so sister preacher stand that they had no record of it the man took what the preacher said when he already read it in the Bible you got no record the Bible said it that's your record because it's in the bar but that's your record when you ask who is this I'm giving you scripture that settles it when you stand inscription oh it's good settlement all right let me go in a little further Thank You Lord and man the world has so added here taken away here and so forth it was dumb till it was so messed up do they trust in their church instead of the word and when they've seen their church I'm anointed then they thought something great was taking place now this is that's that imma just I gotta say this be careful when you're just looking at anointest don't don't stop at that Moses was anointed and he struck a rock twice and water came out but he was still wrong and he missed the promised land with an anointing because you got I mean you know I know people nowadays you know they they feel like they can go to a denominational Church and and and the service would be anointed and they'll feel the power of God and said man God is in that place and they go running right back up in there over and over again thinking that there's an anointing there but the Norton is the word hallelujah and if you can't give them the word and they say amen to the word Amen it just sounded brass until assembles amen glory to God when we go into places like that we got purpose we not saying avoid them but you got to know what you doing the man when you go on you light in darkness and somebody's probably like now that's something different about that person there I want what church they go tell one of us I mean you did you just plant the seed but but if you got is I know I'm going here because I'm really getting something getting what all right name is feel all right says something great was taking place but when they seen the word I'm knowing it then they said that's fanaticism this man is a devil but Beelzebub because it was so contrary to the church until their church crease and what they had done and it was that way in every coming of a prophet the church would be so messed up now let me let me just give you a couple couple comments here and then I got it I got I'm a read a couple here I want God's provide a place of worship and then later see in church aid y'all y'all got a few more minutes to stay with me on this a couple comments here and this was staying in this message who do you say this is but I'm just I can't read the whole quote so I'm just giving you some snippets many have the word but they won't accept the anointed word for their day many have the word they have the Bible maybe yesterday we all read not a KJV but being able to accept the anointed Word or the word that is promised for your day recognizing your message and is saying that's a different story see Peter wanted to build three Tabernacles after seeing Moses Elijah and Jesus but gospel from heaven this is my beloved son he him who is this he was the anointed word for that day Jesus was the anointed word for that day so don't I mean no number say yeah we thank God for moseley Elijah but no here's him God was identifying hear him alright and brother Branham said this the proper to this day and this is a statement the prophet of this day is the anointed word of the hour the prophet of this day is that knowing it word about now if you understand the word then you understand who the property now even have to say anything else but the prophet of this day is that knowing it word I just gave you scripture and you look to see who fulfil that scripture that's why you know this is the first question come to me you telling me you know brother Branham not the prophet you have to tell me who is the prophet you have to you can't give me well God and use the prophets no more what that's not that don't make no sense and then you go to a church and somebody prophesy to you about you getting a blessing and you come tell me oh you know they told I get a blessed I'm looking but I thought you said God one using prophets let alone but if you want to believe that can somebody tell you're gonna get a million dollars well somebody else just still you're gonna miss a rapture if people want to believe what they want to believe but it don't change the Word of God it's still there they've answered my first click you tell me who fulfill these things then you can't you can't you just can't give me just any kind of answer and think I'm gonna take that you know people say I'm turning back to the Bible always been on the Bible that's why I believe it this way it just can't come give me anything glory to God amen glory to God you just ain't gonna work with me I'm sorry amen amen amen glory to God all right listen I'm trying to go on say the prophet of this day is the anointed word of the hour because I'm say this the Holy Ghost in you will punctuate that word every word amen amen amen when the word says anything you say that's the truth ain't it because you're agreed with the word you agree with God you and God are one when you agree with the words and you agree with God you and God are one God is in you you're his son or his daughter I'm going on gives he said it makes this thing that makes you a messiah for him when you agree with the word you become Messiah makes you a messiah for him the anointed word living out in you they'll never see it see but what a privilege it is for us who believe to walk in the presence of God every day he says this give me a church that's so completely anoint it with God till their every action and move is thus saith the Lord walk in the Shekinah glory I'll show you a messiah he said when you give me a church that stood completed anointed with God so every action and move is dust at the Lord walk in the Shekinah glory I'll show you a Messiah Anointed One of God standing up from the earth looking at God here I'm looking at God and let me tell you I need your parts the body is not complete when you miss it and I mean another thing and when one part of the body hurt the rest of the body hurt when I was walking I brought my luggage back this week and put it in the rooms and you know I'm good I'm just happy to be home is late at night I'm just putting this luggage here in the room and praise what I'm going on the vent and I went on the bed and left that luggage there and and I had to get up in the middle of the night and take a little visit and I was coming back with them like sides and lo and behold trying to feel my way through you know I don't want to turn on the light I'm just trying to throw my way through and guess what happened whew that luggage I forgot it was there my toe found out it was there and when my toasts are hurting the rest of the body was hurt it makes another statement here the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing his word always been in every age if you can receive the word that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost all right I told y'all there's a lot in that sermon so you might want to go back and listen to it alright y'all just bear with me just a few minutes I promise I'm coming I'm coming home soon soon I want to read these quotes I got to drop this in here for you this one is out of God's provided place of worship then I want to read legacy in church age and then maybe I finished somewhere all right it says now we found that at each age when God said a certain thing would happen here come that man alone in Manifesta so if God promised malachi forward if God promised revelation 3 God promised revelation 10 7 God promised revelation 18 God promised Matthew 17 if God promised all these things here comes that man alone that's what it says here comes that man alone and manifests it that then it said here comes their people alone and live that so guess who you are you're the people that's come along and got predestinated you to be here just like ypres destinated that foal to be there he predestinated you to be here hey that phone took his first ride and now know if he ever took it him a ride I said it but I can guarantee that first there was no ride like that first ride Oh glory to God a man listen we're riding on this truth and we think that for says there come there here come the people long and live that that was God Himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word now God's only provided way and only provided for plan today is his son through his word for this age quickened by the spirit of his life quicken now let me go on to later see in churches I'm just trying to get you to see you are people that come along you don't know nothin message but God God God and this God has written being so rich and mercy brunchy from out of everywhere all walks of life to bring you to this Living Word and it's the only thing that can keep you it's the only thing that got a hook in it even when you run it anybody tried to run from comets if you get the run in that hook just get you and you know you know how when you fill that hook this turn when you run into one of the Saints you you be out somewhere and just doing your thing and then Here Come on the Saints they God bless you that hook go to turn in it is God's love you can't get away from this a man this is our latest in church age I'm trying to help you see who you are now okay momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word almost was almost lost and tire was almost entirely loves to the people but God said Luther with the word the Luther spoke for God at that time that they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards Dogma increase and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from God became the living epistles read and known of our men for their generation this is when the Methodists fail God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last thing there is again another people in the land move under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age of 340 - - just like that in 340 - 2 says they will be the platypus to the fire age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is it's all mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it stands little as chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more will the world hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that one part will be repudiated as in the first age so that's what my question is who is this who is this bride who is this bride right and and I believe Scripture and quotes will help us understand who she is can I just read that for you revelation 19:7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready when we talk about the bride she is the wife of the lamb hallelujah amen she is the righteousness of God but he hath made him a second Corinthians 5:21 but he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him can also say this she was for know she was predestinated she was called she was justified she was glorified before she even came here Romans 8 verse 29 through 30 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers moreover whom he did predestinate give me also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and I want to tell you another scripture that lines up right there because she was poured on predestined and called justified and glorified Jeremiah 1 and 5 I love this because it says before I formed thee in belly before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations God knew Jeremiah before he came to earth and if God knew Jeremiah before he came God knew you before you got here oh my hallelujah I mean I you know I I got some things on that I'll just I'll save a little time but one of the statements in the who do you say this is he says if you ever was if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start if you ever was or ever will be in heaven you was in heaven to start with you're a part of God you were his thought he knew your name he knew you he knew who you were before there ever was a molecule before there was a light before there was anything he knew you and your name and put it on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever formed see you were his stone and then you became a word and a word as a thought expressed there then you are manifested my god I love that church I want to tell you who else you are you are the purchased of his blood acts 20 and 28 acts 20:28 says this take key therefore unto yourselves and to all of the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood you are the purchased of his blood can I tell you another thing about you oh lord help me help me help me you are the Ministry of the power because you're doing the greater works of John 14:12 give me questions and answers on the seals line it up funny I'm just quoting you just I've just laying this in you I'm putting this thing John 14:12 a liberal I said to me that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now there was a question that a question acts Amen and the seals here did I write that down ok type the same 63-0 3 to 4 em for morning and to 33 thank you this is a question of his acts in the seals says would the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture that was a question you say sure that's what's going on right now see the Bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour see the Bride of Christ sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry is the ministry of the hour it'll be so home and we got people trying to kick the five fold ministry at the church but the Prophet said that the five fold ministry is the ministry of the hour that's part of the Bride of Christ don't let them take your ministry can I take some more all right here's another one you are the beneficiary of Calvary's dual atonement Isaiah 53 and five says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed so you have a beneficiary of Calvary's dual atonement I got one more thing to tell you who you are to two posts that imma leave it here first quotes gonna come out come out of first seal and then the last quota be out of there visible you you know the Bride of Christ listen first seal says this how can a man say that the Bride of Christ goes into the tribulation I can't understand it see she's took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally Findus so if you want to know who you are you're perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person every born-again believer true believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting that his works in the blood of Jesus that's his confessions dropped into this thing about the blood now I forget when sister Sarah son was but all these things was time again right said the Bible the Bible says so he that is born of God does not commit sin but he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that was status 10 - there be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let us then pass there he cannot Jesus that be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how could we even start the thought of being perfect Jesus but Jesus required it and if Jesus required it he's got to make a way for it and he has his own blood you're the purchase of his own blood I got one more for you I just I just want you to know who you are and I'm a read this but i'ma tell you before I get there you are the virtuous sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ you the Lambs wife it's he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which or ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in the Almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word see you are standing completely justified oh I wish somebody catch a hold of that then when you get this the devil won't let you came you won't allow the devil to keep your head down you're standing now let me let me just just pull that now let me let me say this and I know that we've come in life we make mistakes you know we all got things that we'd go through we have to constantly X God for forgiveness and things of that nature but I just want to say if God didn't see you the way I'm reading this to you if God didn't see that way he would not have you in this church to hear these things he wouldn't have you here let me put it this way God when waste his time if he didn't see you already completely justified now now the reason I'm going here is because you need to see yourself you're not some defeated Christian and you're gonna stop living like that the reason you live like that is because you think like that but if we can just get this in you you stop thinking that way you stop living that way you are the righteousness of God the purchase of this blood perfect sinless spotless nothing of the gifts you because the blood of Jesus Christ has taken care of it if you can ever get a revelation of the blood ever get a revelation of blood now talk about when it's really under the blood I mean you know in this innocence sermon the Prophet was talking about this man is uh he was man he read the Bible and we all need to be like this every time he read he'd just get to read a little something here and there and next thing he just go to jumping and shouting praise and gotten brothers brother thing I don't know brother Willie hit that night but this man would just go jumping and shop just just worshipping like crazy so his daughter you know said now we're gonna have a little party hit the house and I don't want daddy to be jumping and shot go read this Bible something have to take the Bible from him and I'm gonna give him a book of geography and and he took the book of geography to say said daddy you're going upstairs and you you know we'll be done with the party in a little bit and I'll come check on you and everything but you know Danny just you know you know how you get when you read the Bible you know how you get you know so so dad I don't want you to do that in front of my friends and all that so so I'm just giving this book of geography but after they leave you can have your Bible okay no problem do I take I take the book of drugs so he went any rate let's start reading a book of geography and and then he started reading about the sea and in saying the sea was so deep that they can't even find the bottom of it in some places so when he still had a deep the sea was glory oh please say it's like our sailors we all heaven hurt chums when he saw his name when this man saw that revelation of geography not even read his Bible his daughter went running up into the Bible why are you acting like this in the tell you what when you get that violation your tribe the devil ain't gonna live down here I'm not gonna live daily with a man down I'm refusing to live that way I don't care a lot of stuff happened here and there and everything I mean like that's that's life and it's just a trial that God given you to overcome some time I take you a little time and okay you're gonna make it through but I'm telling this you would not be sitting here listening to these things if God didn't care about you you wouldn't come to this church you wouldn't come and I'm greeting what a prophet say it but God allowed the Prophet that I've never heard words like this in my denomination nobody to tell me I was the spotless sinless they tell me I'm a sinner always tell me I'm a sinner and come in we're gonna pray you through right that's what you always hear but no no no you spotless and while this dude was raising the octave you begin to think different about yourself and then when you when you sounds post and you just start living spotless and living sinless [Music] man now you can't be spotless and sinless and living a sin but you spotless and sinless because you live in life that's above sin you can live a life above reproach yes you can and you got to be making excuses as to why you do wrong you can live above that a man Church oh my god you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is the mess this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a minute now notice these last words he want to slip into people before he leave the radio right as we go off the air in a minute you were standing if you're stepping on God's Word and with God's Word every a man every job every title where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them suck so you come out of her my people pull away from their sucks and get out here in the week where you can get right before the Sun s om I hear the coming of a combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son of the Living God every man a woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned had the first place to notice there's a couple couple of things here you have to be born of the Spirit of God washed in the blood of Jesus they don't stop there you have to believe every word of God there's many many folks that can be born the Spirit of God and watch thinking they can get justification they can get sanctification and then I'll even tell you that that I believe that some had been filled with the Holy Ghost in the denominational Church and I believe that but if it's a true ghost it'sa leaves you and guide you into all truth if it don't do that it ain't all he goes it's a ghost just not the Holy Ghost you're the pure virtuous still is proud of the Son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place we'll know who as you are who is this you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ that's what makes you perfect and it was excited that day they had these three groups standing there some was looking for him waiting forms shot and praises others were ready to you know didn't I mean just really give him a run for his money and there was others that had no idea what they were looking at but nonetheless his word was being fulfilled when he came riding through a man Jerusalem on the back of that bat donkey his word was being fulfilled and just as was being fulfilled in that day when Jesus did that it was fulfilled in this day they meant when he said brother Branham brother branham's going now but he still got some science on this earth and you Willa wants a feeling that it's time for you to find your place in scripture and I tell you what heaven will be rejoicing blessed this day that come to an understanding of who they are now the the prophets say when the bride recognizes who she is then the rapture will call praise the Lord that's me father thank you for your word that has been given to us today we thank back so many years ago when you came riding into Jerusalem and all the people with all the excitement so happy to see you some were some weren't some had no idea what was going on but yet we're still the word was being manifested and we can see is your prophet has taken us on a journey we can see that it had such a greater meaning even to today where people have to be able to see the word manifested for their day we can't the the evidence of the Holy Ghost is actually to be able to receive the word for your date all those other manifestations we thank you for that thank you for gifts of the Spirit yes we heard brother Willie tell us that when he goes to the store and acts for shoes he wants to hold shoot he just don't go ask for tongs he acts for the whole shoot the tongs come with the shoe thank God that we get all these things with the Holy Ghost we get every gift of the Spirit it's promised with the Holy Ghost and we thank you for that God help us Lord to just take this word to walk in it to live it to express it we are the virtuous sinless bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and there is nothing the devil can do but take us from that place thank you for your blood that was shared just for us some
