really know too much i didn't know jesus that's why i know much right i was just going to church because that's what we did you know but you know but i remember when we would when we would go amen and and in those times we the church suffered we didn't have musicians but there was a way a man that the people still elevate and praise and worship and had those old uh wooden floors and the church and my god folk get to singing and tapping their feet and and that was all we needed that was in the baptist church when i when i went to the pentecostal church they also suffered from not having musicians so they had sisters in the church that would come with what they call a washboard and they just be sitting i don't even think they sell instruments like that in the store i don't know where they even got it from but they had a washboard and they would just they'd just be in there just hitting that washboard my god it was them were the days there were the days but i just thought we'd go back and just do this with no music amen let's go back and just do this this old hymn near the cross amen gee just keep me the cross there i pray just [Music] [Music] stream oh follows from cat freeze

blessing and then i know next weekend they have something in destin florida and you got to remember you got to remember um all that brother solomon went through with his job there at pepsi i believe and then when he came down here to centos he's been doing everything he can but this door has just just opened up wide and the lord is just doing mighty things for them so we just want to keep them in prayer i know when they when they first started out they were so adamant about trying to get back to sunday morning service and and i appreciated you know them for doing that but i i mentioned to us and brother we we got help here at the church so if you if you can't make it back it's okay you know it'll be all right you know and uh and the lord has just blessed him and and the help has risen up to to do what the help does so we thank god for all these things so just keep them in prayers they're they're traveling amen uh our uh brother's virtual prayer service will be online a man on on

bring some up i can't hear myself amen gracious father we just thank you and we praise your god this morning for just allowing us this opportunity to be in the house of the lord this morning lord we're here to uh present jesus christ to the folks this morning and we trust that we can get ourself out of the way i'm reminded of a statement that the prophet of god made he said uh if we could come up lord god the way we desire to go down we'll be all right so we we're just coming up humble this morning so we could go down with our head lift it up lord we realize it's about jesus christ in this hour we just thank you and we we praise you lord we thank you for just bringing us out lord god and the songs of zion we give you praise glory and honor in jesus name amen amen amen let's get our bibles out this morning amen we appreciate the lord this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord amen brother jack pulled out some oldies but goodies hey man we grew up on them kind of song when he started singing yes yeah well i remember my grandma my name used to sing them kind of songs there boy they they you man my god you knew you was in church when they pulled out without me start calling on him call on him baby amen you know you knew you was in church not church the fault back then touched we we put in we cute we go to church now we we intellectual they have wooden floors and and and no air conditioner and all of that and uh they didn't mind you know getting ugly for jesus but uh we appreciate the lord we appreciate this opportunity amen to be here this morning and you continue to pray for us we starting to get started out in the field and uh last week i'm gonna tell you we had church we didn't have church we had church the building was on fire so we we pray this morning that y'all didn't come to sit and stay and look at me but that y'all come to pull on the word of god because it's not about me amen you know a brother brandon makes a statement he said we get out of what we put into it now uh he also makes a statement that we don't pack no revival in our briefcase if you ain't in no revival no matter how much i can be in a revival it's not going to help you you got to be in your own personal revival it's got to be a personal revelation of jesus christ because that's the new birth right so we we're looking at um psalms 111 now we preached on this a couple of weeks ago but uh the generation of the upright part two and we'll see how far we can get but we we want to start at psalms 111 and then want to read a portion of psalms 112 because both of those scriptures are connected it says praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure the end his work is honorable and glorious and his righteousness and do it forever he has made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion he has given meat unto them that fear him he will ever be mindful of his covenants he has showed his people the power of his works that he may give them the heritage of the heathen the works of his hands are verity and judgment and all his commandments are sure they stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and up righteousness uh he sent redemption unto his people he has commanded his covenant forever holy and reverend is his name the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise and do it forever now let's go to psalms 112 it says praise you the lord blessed are the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endure forever unto the upright there arises light in darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteousness amen may the lord have a blessing to his word this morning you may be seated um like we say our title this morning is the gender generation of of the upright and uh the last time and i maybe just want to kind of lay a foundation and build uh just just for a moment is some things that we we tried to bring out that uh i feel i felt inspired by the holy spirit as we were studying um on this subject to try to get bring us to an understanding last week i pray preached the same subject in orlando and and after the service one of the uh minister brothers because i i got to talking about and i'll probably briefly uh talk about that a little bit this morning also as we go along about this this uh this millennial generation uh and one one of the things that that we and you know i don't try to say things to to be harsh or anything but we we gotta have truth right right we gotta identify things for uh the people of god that's just a part of of of why the ministry is called he's giving us a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the state saints and and and you know uh uh we need light on the word of god right because you you'll never rapture in in error you're gonna get a witness you'll never rapture an error and and there's so many things that that that we see uh and and folk don't like you to talk about nothing we we want us to come to church and hear good good sermons to make us feel good and church be good and and blessings and we'll tell building down on those types of things but uh uh we we realize that as long as you're in error you'll never have faith to be translated in a moment of a twinkling of an eye is that right because one of the things that we we find in studying scripture god never started out an error god never produced error right error error was pro produced by satan is that right amen god i'll say that again god never produced error error does not come from god error comes by amen disbelief all right is that right if if we go back to genesis this is what we find god amen establish a church he established a family in truth and righteousness is that right amen and and see the principles of god can't change because we're in the layout of sin it in aids now we can say we we just because of thought we we've been elevated into the bright age but everybody has not been elevated there's still some people now now i'll say this it's still layout of seeing conditions that we're battling exactly this is the age where folks are blind wretched and naked and don't even know it that's the sad part about it to be blind wretched and naked and do not even know it right boy i feel uh help us help us so so we we we this is just the way that i think right and and all of us are different as ministers and and i just learned in studying amen the seventh angel to follow amen types and shadows and patterns right amen because these things reveal christ it shows us what was in god's mind it shows us the the intentions of god from the very beginning right glory to his wonderful name from the very beginning um we find the intentions on god now it might go a little different i don't know but but i feel good this morning and i hope y'all are right right now watch a statement in uh god's provided approach to divine fellowship matthew 6 he said god loves to fellowship with his creation in the garden of eden we are told that when man watch this walk in the uprightness of god right in the uprightness of god god came down in the cool of the evening in fellowship with his children right and then one day there was a voice came up in the presence of god and said those your loved ones your children has fallen but in the beginning right in the beginning the children of god walked in the uprightness of god and so and then we also we read a quote where the prophet he was talking about time and how how the earth stood upright it stood upright but he said sin right sin brought judgment and judgment caused the earth to tilt all right right it caused the earth but the original plan of god because precepts has to run the same down through scripture he said i'm god and i don't change that right glory to his wonderful name so so the world tilts it but see this is why i thank god for redemption right because we we were born in sin right glory to god uh uh now i'ma say it like he said it because i know it's two scriptures but it means the same same thing and iniquity we're covering the world speaking life we were liars is that right glory to god now i know that's two scriptures and and i i don't have time to go pull them out and read them but i i'll give it to you the way that i've always heard it i know i'm standing there now i got my computer back there y'all need y'all need some help my phone in the car go get that too and look it up right cause folk get folks get calm amen but but then what redemption has done for me when i came to the world tilted opposite of the thoughts of god right opposite of the thoughts of god right but but one thing about god god had a plan before the foundations of the world right this book is the plan of redemption it was written before the foundations of the world right my name was there yes my picture was in the family album before the foundation of the world god took a picture of me knowing that i would be there knowing knowing that you know he would straighten me up yes knowing what day i would come in what dispensation that i would live in knowing what light of the day amen that i would fall under knowing that i would agree with the precepts of god god being sovereign took a picture of me [Music] hallelujah if he didn't i wouldn't be here and you wouldn't either see we all were tempted amen i know we like to talk about one another and we talk about this and this we were all tilted we were all jacked up but god but god i know some of y'all might be smarter than me may have more money than me and all of that but you ain't no better than me we got on the same road this morning spiritually speaking come on when we get to the wedding you ain't gonna have on a different robe than brother smiley y'all know the preacher i hope y'all study i ain't got time to try to explain it all to you this morning right so so no matter how how well you speak and all that that don't mean that we got to say if you got the baptism by the holy ghost you got the same robon that i got on you got the thing on that'll get you in the glory your education ain't gonna get you the glory your status ain't gonna get you in the glory your money ain't gonna get you in the glory [Applause] but the new birth will get you there you must be born again very very i say joining church won't do it being identified with a preacher or a church will not do it you must be born again is that right i'm glad for the new birth i'm glad that this church brother jack's still preaching the new birth still preaching new birth we still preach the new birth around here you must be you must be born again huh you must be born again it's imperative i shook the preacher hand ain't nothing in my hand [Applause] nothing in it glory to god these veins can't get you in the glory that's in my head but the new birth the new birth uh i'll get you there right a couple of things right he says um knowing who we are is important right and and like i say i don't i don't want to pick on anybody but to me that's important right because we we we got to have an absolute we we got to have something that we're tied to and i was saying this last week and it's it's people that i know people people that i've watched grow up in church it's good to see these young fellas now i remember these young fellows when they were little fellas now they now they got beards and everything more hair on their chin than me but i remember when they were little fellas coming up in church right glory to god but they must have an absolute they must have something that they're tied to something that reveals to them who they are glory right glory to god glory to god i know i'll probably make y'all mad when i say certain things but it's y'all gonna be all right that'll be all right glory to god cause cause i've watched things over the years yeah yeah right and and and because of the revelation of the word of god i don't be moved by those things see we can have all these emotions and all of these fits but but if we don't get up and accept what he's already done and move the revelation of what he's already done and they ain't going to do you no good i look man many times we back in the old days we cried we went to conventions man we cried we stepped right since the team this is there we go oh my we had a fit and when we came back we didn't have a clue of who we was in the spirit by the word we amen we shot we danced in the spirit and and at the end of the day we didn't even know who we were we didn't even know what we believed all right we didn't know what we were standing for that ain't the case this morning i feel like singing now i shall not be i shall not be moved huh glory to his wonderful name now i remember sister birds back in the day but sister birds know now we worked together she asked me a biblical question i just looked at her right but we shouted over that revelation we screamed over that revelation but didn't understand right but we understand now right brother browner makes the statement he say you're gonna understand it and the bible say he'll open up to your understanding to the scripture thank god for understanding why because it's this understanding of the word of god that's become my absolute amen right some something that i realize i'm tied to something that i realized that it keeps me it keeps me when my flesh don't want to be killed when my flesh want to clown and cut up and say i got you buddy i got you you ain't going nowhere right on on this the sea of life [Music] you say i got you though i'm anchored no matter how much your boat rocks it's got an anchor my ain't brother jack as much as i love him he's my pastor he's not my anchor my anchor is jesus christ on solid rock i stand all over the sink is saying y'all pray for me now i'm getting carried away oh hallelujah so knowing who we are and and knowing what we are part of right glory to god we gotta because things is constantly changing and one of the things that paul taught in the book of ephesians he said he wanted the people to be be anchored and not tossed to and fro with every wind and doctrine it's like and brother jack covered that right amen people that's anointed all right see just let me i'll say this the serpent was up upright he was anointed by the enemy he even had a place for us so he didn't have a soul i know we put him some of the pictures and the thoughts of man is like that's connor because he was upright he was he was close to humanity right he could speak he could say he could reason right not that's it it was it was it was the judgment that that put him down there but right it wasn't so from the beginning see the serpentine was stood up right huh glory to god amen oh hallelujah so so uh uh he says uh we gotta know what we are part of what's promised and what's important in scripture to god not your thinking not your opinions those things have caused you to stand at the day of judgment and give an account right it's it's god's plan yeah you know when adam and eve fell uh and we often say this adam adam tried in his own perspective to uh do something that would bring him back to his original state right where he could find himself in the presence of god and then then he realized uh this ain't working this ain't gone when when he heard the voice of god coming down in the cold of the evening he realized i ain't not right no more all right something that something that went wrong here because because he could see eve for who she was right come on jack just covered this now right he realized you know what where there was a spiritual veil over her eyes right there was a veil there where he could look in that lust now because unbelievable unbelief came in right he no longer could and not lust [Music] we got to thank god for the holy ghost church come on come on i know sometimes men think well i praise the lord i'm holy all right okay you let the devil fool you with that one if you wanna even the prophet had to put a cross in his car right cause he still had feelings sometimes you listen to tapes and hear how he describes women not like somebody with blind zone oh y'all gotta talk to me up in here hallelujah glory to god thank you jesus and all of that stuff huh he described her she's beautiful she's well built what that huh yes yes he was he was a man glory to god he wasn't trying to you know that's why he put that cross there huh oh we might need to put some crosses in our car all right horses on our glasses [Applause] brother brothers so i could see it so i could see it because these women have naked right here i'm going somewhere this morning uh a lot of times people don't don't seem to agree with that last statement um what's important to god according to this scripture it's like we we're living in the age where uh pretty much everything that goes in the gospel has been watered down right but i mean we had we had a gospel that that used to bring about real change and the only way that it's going to bring about change it's got to be preached in its fullness but but in 111 um a psalm that says praise you the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart right you know you know man praise is what i do huh god created me to praise him huh i was a praiser when i was in the mind of god before god saw me praising god saw you praise it hallelujah glory to his name david identified with praise david identified with man david got to cutting up one time when he saw the ark of the covenant coming back man look at here he i could imagine i could have i gotta take my glasses off for this one i could imagine david not like this praise dance stuff you see now carl again i know y'all say he you know not nothing cute i just believe david didn't have no rhythm he probably is like oh glory the world is coming back hallelujah not not not standing waiting on see some of the things that i just really don't agree with but i let people do whatever they gonna do anyway you know not waiting on the music [Music] spontaneous worship spontaneous worship some strike you so deep that you something that you know what i'm talking about that you get besides yourself yes huh you don't care who looking you are shot all around a building all down through the house i think that's why we got all this around us all this other stuff we ain't hardly moving we coming to church and letting the air conditioner freeze us what we got to put on now ain't nothing wrong with y'all if you call your car somebody ask me when's the night brother smiley watch you oh you got that hoodie on i'd be cold it'd be cold in this building buddy i said i got a trick for that right but amen we need to shout but he said i will praise the lord right uh in the assembly of the upright right and like we say upright is the definition of a person of their behavior strictly honorable and honest right and and when when we when we think about scripture i i just have to think about all the things that i understand and i know uh uh god started out a church in genesis upright honorable and honest as christians you know that's the kind of atmosphere you want to be up under right you you want to sit up on a man that's honorable that has integrity morals and scruples and things of that nature is that right because like we often say god is only going to be identified by its characteristic there's things that god will be identified witness things that god will not be identified with [Music] right glory to god he only and see here's your thing and i think brother jack struck this a while back god requires that which is past why is that scripture in the bible because that scripture tells me what what was past was in the original thinking and mind of god you can't get away with it right you know when they when they came up to jesus one time and they was trying to trick him but he was a master of circumstances and there was action i'm about and i'm not gonna preach on divorce that's brother jack job uh uh uh about about you know divorce in so many words he just brought him to a place he said first of all your heart's hard he said moses moses did it but it wasn't so from the beginning that's what he said right it wasn't so from the beginning why could jesus because he was the author and the finisher he was the first in the last he could look back to the he was god veil he understood the principles of god he could look back when it was just one buck in one door before the before the fall right before before the fall right it was one buck and one dope right right right right go back to imagine divorce right before the fall see amen after the fall and this is where we we got our problem at but back then it was certain principles implemented that god could identify himself with [Music] see people want to bring in polygamy and all of this other stuff and a wife and a girlfriend and now you got a wife and a girlfriend and a boyfriend and all this kind of stuff y'all don't preach with me this is the age that you you you got this gender identity stuff and i'm going somewhere church you you've got all of this foolishness that that that people fight now they fight hard to bring in the uh uh uh these gender perspectives that's contrary to the word of god god knew what he meant from the beginning when he made adam and eve huh right god didn't make if god can make a mistake then we done we're done god did not make no now you know here's the intelligence of man i'm still going somewhere right where where you know people come this is what they're saying but it's these thoughts is coming from the pits of hell where where they're saying that you know folks coming to the earth with no no agendas and things of that nature it's like this is crazy this is the stuff that that they're teaching and they're pushing right they're pushing did they boycott right now dave chappelle cause his little comedy special right cause in a subtle way he's trying to say i'm born believe that stuff they fighting hard right to get this to the the millennials because we didn't believe that foolishness we now i'm a baby boomer but now that's all i can say about that cause i'm a christian see i according to the scripture i'm a part of the generation of the upright see i know where i'm at they might say well you're a baby boomer well that's carnal because there's so much that go here's the thing right when we make statements like that we we got to understand what follows these statements come on what what well you know and i'm gonna keep saying this and i i just gotta be sad right well we the and millennials said this and i'm gonna keep on saying it because it's some devils we got to chop off right okay when when we if you just say to me i'm a millennial and just leave it there then then okay on my right with just that statement but when you have this certain type of disposition in this attitude we're this we're millennials and we don't go for this and we're millennials and we got to do this and we're millennial see you see the devil see what's what goes along with it disrespect [Applause] huh [Music] don't they don't respect authority man we we respect it i'm telling you something man when i got saved i was 25 years old i i i grew up you know i was on the streets i was wilding gangs and all that kind of stuff but when i became a christian i came subject brother brother wesker was our pastor i was i'm older than brother troy and brother jack right they were teenagers back then when i got saved yeah right and they got us in trouble a lot of times they kept us in meetings i need to see all of the young people huh bro bro roscoe didn't play back then not back in 88 89 90 up in there uh uh and being that i was young i was older than them and and my daddy didn't raise me i felt like i was a man right and i'm like okay man thank you well i'm just my man is here how about just as big as he deals you won't stuff we can scuff him but then you realize by the baptism of the holy ghost that you we had to come subject whether we liked it or not we had to come subject to his leadership and that's the thing that this generation so-called ain't doing their perspective and now now everybody got a blog [Music] everybody on internet confusion folk huh come on everybody the sisters the brothers everybody everybody got a blog everybody got something to say contrary to the bible y'all sisters shouldn't be on the on on these these social media sites blogging and all of that that ain't your place brother branham in his day rebuke he rebuked the businessmen because he said y'all ain't preachers all y'all doing is breeding confusion [Applause] he said we have a hard enough time trying to keep it straight and and people like brother jack and myself we have a hard enough time trying to keep it straight we got everybody amen because you got a social media account on there with something and half of that stuff is contrary to the bible it's meeting misleading that's right give me that old time well give me that oh oh i feel good this morning oh hallelujah i've been i've been in i'm i've been like a bucking horse i was like this here for 10 months for 10 months in the shoot for god to let me loose glory to god glory to god i know folk don't like that but it's the truth anyhow sisters should be somewhere cooking and cleaning and making sure they making their husbands see because they don't realize what kind of spirits that they taking on huh people don't people don't believe this right amen when when you invade a man's domain you gotta take on another spirit a masculine spirit a dominant spirit right come on then you want your husband to come subject to you ain't never doing it never ever amen that's right god made me the head that's right i ain't gonna fight that's right but i ain't coming that's right that's right right god sent an order that was right glory amen yes we breaking the order amen amen i got a friend that works with me uh he was pastoring the church and um he said when he he went he went on a he went to the hospital he had to have uh have something did to his heart and he said when he was having surgery and all that trying to heal up he said the church voted him out well no he said they tried to vote him out but he wanted to vote but he left he said it was it was a 90-year-old mother that was influencing the deacons and the rest of the church i said man that's absolutely crazy right because she don't have the the the authority right she does not have the authority to push a vote and all the man he told me say he said rep he said all i did was what the church needed because the deacons wasn't wouldn't do it i say you are the supreme authority in the church no listen that that is the supreme authority in this church right we got preachers brother quite cool and and uh brother jerry myself and troy but we need supreme authority right i have to i pastor for 20 some years but i have to subject myself to brothers jack's ministry right glory to god glory to god no matter what i understand when he said bruh i i need y'all i'm here to i'm here i got you amen but after that when i leave this pulpit that's the man that's the man right there glory to god the box stops with brother jack not none of the rest of us see we've been we we we've been uh uh prone to follow evangelists and teachers and different things that's so contrast see when i watch all of this i'd be like you breaking scripture to do this stuff right amen that's what god gave us do you think brother branham just preached messages just to be preaching no no no he preached things amen to the upright generation that'll keep us in line with the word of god and the order of god see just like the president brother jack got veto power right but i believe he placed men in position that he could have confidence in that and make the right decision like when i you know i tell tell him about brother caper brother caples i never could have done it for 23 years with our brother and sister capus i placed them in a position i had total 100 percent confidence that he was going to make the right decision i wasn't always in the office uh how much money we got and all this it i did right praise the lord i implemented a few things brought in a few things and the rest i gave to brother capers to handle him and brother dave right amen that be time where where i want to do something they'd be like uh uh uh but we'll uh he'll do one of them numbers put his head down when he talks like brother will come look at me like oh nobody down that the fawn's looking a little okay that's all you got to say right amen because it's his job to keep the church from going bankrupt i could say that because they said quote yes yes right it's their job it's the trustees my brother jack might want to do things i hope that's all right bro jake it's all right huh what if the trustees say bro jack i think we might need to wait another four five months right let me tell y'all why we gon get it he gave me the okay to say that can we we're dealing with uh what's up right because because see there's always a law of contrast right that's upright and that's wicked and see this is why we got to be careful when when people approach these i'm trying to go somewhere uh well well we're generating this okay i'm watching the spirits see and and and see because there's a there's a there's a a spiritual application to all of these and and then if you watch right if you watch well i'm i'm i'm generation millennial and you come up under that spirit this is what you got to deal with come on you got to deal with all of these agendas and all of these things that they're promoting men wearing dresses and and and they're using hollywood right they're using hollywood and these men are selling their children uh out for for status right come on the smiths and the wades and all of this kind of stuff right they selling their children out for status they're using them right to further the agenda of the devil of the devil see we come back to genesis right back inside of my condition here we are the sons of god lusting for the daughters of man right we back in genesis again come on god has come down right walked down the dusty road with two angels right god has gone to abraham which is all all the time outside of the filth and the foolishness and revealing revealing to abraham what he was getting ready to do glory two angels go down the side right right and it was so bad down inside until the men didn't even want virgins exactly right they were like look man we want the men in your house what a shame huh they were trying to tell to go down that's right see and spiritually that's what they're doing they trying to they y'all come on y'all they quit on me is you i wouldn't bought me a watch just to make sure i stay on time this time i wouldn't bought two of them just ordered another to make sure because y'all haven't got quiet huh it's the truth i don't know how far i'm gonna get i'll go to my time to stop when i stop we'll we'll pick it up again if we got to right see you as young peoples you gotta you gotta watch you gotta watch what you being involved with [Applause] i don't care my son my daughter and and whosoever like my grandma used to say who's never all right she was old country gal who's to never you you well i just better just stand just see and i love them i love my children i love my son i love the young people but i can't i don't go with everything that's right i don't fight i don't fight everything but but when god say say it i don't care who doing it i'ma say it you may you might be hot with me but then you just hop with god come on you hot with god i know y'all say good day i remember when brother smiley used to come over here and fill in for brother jack when he used to go on town he was a different guy but now he with us every couple of weeks preaching i don't know about that guy just better nobody because i ain't going nowhere [Applause] glory to god amen and see i i listen to brother jack so i kind of i kind of we i think we on the same line i just listen to him a lot of times and i'll be like praise god that's a real man of god right there okay we started then we we left off talking about the works of the lord right his works is honorable and glorious and his righteousness endures forever see and and here's the thing what do you say what are you trying to do i'm trying to show us patterns god can't expect from us something if god is not honorable and and his perspective is not honorable if he's partial in any form we might close this up because it's no good right everything about what god did from the very beginning amen is right up honorable right worth respecting worth holding on to as difficult as as things might be and things that's preached they're worth holding on to because it's not a man's words right people people like to say this and i hope this will be all right well oh that's a white man's book right huh come on now no no no this is this this is men wrote as they was in spite of the holy ghost right it has nothing this bible has nothing really to do with humanity god just used to manly humanity to inspire them to pin this but the principles that they wrote this psalmist see this song you could see the principles and thoughts of god the expression of god you see god in the word if you can't man you better go back because you didn't mess mess up if you cannot see christ you got to go back if we cannot see an origin right a character a nature expressed we something's wrong something's wrong see glory to god glory to god amen so he said he has made his wonderful works to be remembered i mean we could look back to creation but man i look i look at my life as a living testimony of the greatness of god amen the goodness of god it's a great work man listen church this ain't skim milk to me when i when when i and i i remember a long time ago people like a brother came to me and said brother smiley you always you always using your testimony you're always telling your testimony sometimes that might be all you got wrong with that huh but my testimony is powerful to me my my testimony is powerful to me because because i was on drugs from the age of 11 years old to 25 years old right and in in less than five minutes i was delivered right how can i not stop telling that [Applause] man i've been on drugs for 30 something years to work great god has given me a wife and a family glory don't worry listen when i was in my twenties twenties i don't wanna think about no getting no married really married what long away from my thinking six children definitely wasn't in my lord have mercy huh i was messing i was messing with my sons last night to treat us home and uh you know sometimes i look back on my life because i had ambitious i was pretty decent kid you know even though i was on drugs and uh i said but if god if because i could have been on drugs and really doing some harsh things now now i could tell you some stuff but i'll leave that out but i was telling my boys uh uh you know if i would have went the way that i wanted to the nba and all that i said y'all wouldn't be here they pick that up they say show you right about that see god had them in his mind right glory to god it wasn't by chance i look back sometime i'll be i'll be like you know i'll talk half talks to the lord toss with the lord and be like but in reality i realized it was all for a purpose i can't say i cannot stand here to today and say that that i fully understand i understand what it's like but in the flesh i want it to be rich huh in the flesh that's my was my desire but god said i got something bigger right and it's still it's still a fight come on church listen church i mean i i don't enjoy being a peniel y'all don't talk to me especially when you see folk folk just living the life oh let me go man my time here oh lord i'd be like i ran i ran across one of my classmates yesterday in the stow and though we were chatting it up and uh you know he up here passed in all too and this man here driving a bentley uh mercedes somehow got a bunch of houses i'd be like no what happened to me okay god almighty jesus he ain't no better than me we went to the same school i knew that well we since we were in the seventh grade god just say i took you a different route he couldn't have went through what you went through come on he wouldn't he wouldn't have made it out glory to god but but but you know god watched over us i'm trying to get somewhere maybe i'll have to pick it up again oh lord my time gone lord have mercy blame sister brown i heard her say keep on brother i'll get to a couple more things and then we'll go uh he says he has made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion and sometimes people misunderstand the compassion of god and how and how god could go in the midst of of a group of people and heal a man that that wasn't as bad as others will i be made whole man i don't know you know it's been tough i was trying i'm trying to get in that pool but i ain't able to make it that ain't what i asked you will you be made whole huh people moving faster than me they getting in that show he could move right amen he had he had something going on in his body and you would think that jesus would come into the pool of bethesda and heal this man and walk right out and leave all of these sick people and call of mine would say where's the compassion and all that right right but here's the thing he said i ain't gonna do nothing except i i first see it by my father the father never showed him about healing because he could have said everybody in here rise up and gone on about your business and every demon would have had to go it would have been cuts and everything else like it was when brother branham was over in what bombay or somewhere overseas where where uh it could have been africa and and when he left the place he said it made madder city huh durbin took come to the window and see people marching down the street and there were truckloads of carts and stretchers and this and that way huh amen when when jesus went to the to the grave of lazarus he said he called he called lazarus by name because if he wouldn't did it if he'd just come forth it would have been almost a general resurrection everything would have been coming out of the green huh graves opening up and everything coming out but he called lazarus and lazarus came out is that right but that was compassion the grace brother jack preached on the grace of god i thank god for it every day let me tell you something it's the grace of god i'm here today monday i'm on my way to monday or tuesday i was on my way to work it was monday i think the devil was still mad at me about sunday preaching in orlando and i'm going and it's half dark and i'm riding man this car started coming in my lane he got this close to me i never called on jesus so many times so fast jesus jesus jesus jesus i like what he tried to kill me huh but god said not so not yet not yet it ain't just time to go i still got to work for him to do and as long as god still got to work for me to do i'm going to do that work see i ain't worried about coving i ain't worried about cancer i ain't worried about none of that stuff as long as god's got to work for me to do i'm gonna be all right huh i'm gonna be all right we gonna be all right amen scotland as long as god needs a body as long as god needs your money oh hallelujah stop talking my money in church people get quiet people start clutching their pocketbooks hallelujah i'm about to go let them let the musicians make a way right one thing we will pick it up another time i guess if we be the will of the lord uh but but watch this video verse he says he has given meat unto them that feareth him right glory to god he will ever be mindful of his covenant we got spiritual food in season huh we're feeding on a full seven course meal right we got meat because conscriptually talks about it being a famine in the last day not for not so much for bread and water but for spiritual things see and god god told a prophet to stop fool that don't even make y'all

we [Applause] [Music] xl [Music] oh lord come on give the lord a hand of praise bless it be his holy name he is exalted he is lifted up this morning hallelujah glory hallelujah jesus thank you lords my god certainly appreciate our precious brother smiley man on this morning and uh generation of the upright part two and uh you know i was just thinking how he was saying somebody told him brother smiley always sharing your testimony and um you know when you read in scripture like that but psalms 11 psalms 112 and you look back and you see where god has brought you from you can't help but show your testimony you realize that you were leaning amen at one point in time in your life you were leaning but god himself stood you upright right i mean for those years that he was a man on drugs he's lived more years off drugs than he did on drugs god has made a beautiful testimony out of brother smiley's life right so so he like he said i'm not i'm not just part of the baby boomer generation no no no no i it's a it's a greater purpose to my existence and just be born amongst the baby boomers i'm a part of the generation of the upright that is beautiful to me generation of the upright my god my god just thinking back on on last sunday man and just a sermon there and how you know we now behold now we are the children of god and and people don't realize who we are folk have no idea who we are right amen but but we know who we are we come from god we're going back to god we're part of this great generation of the upright no matter what generation you were born in this is the greatest greatest generation you can be a part of the generation of the uprights hallelujah i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them god bless you brother smiley thank you so much for just yielding yourself [Applause] a man you know he was uh talking about you know just he call it blocking amen and and and actually it's you know that's typically where people are doing a lot of writing but now uh the podcast thing has really taken off and uh and it's right it's something that you have to be careful of sometimes you can be saying something that could be very good but never get into a spot where you're trying to explain the word of god right don't do that don't don't do that because you'll get things all mixed up and you know and uh and and just unfortunate what i've seen the spirit that i've seen is that people that have lost their position maybe in church have used that platform to be a pulpit because they don't have a pulpit amen it's like um when uh kane got kicked out of the garden he had nothing praise the lord so they had to find someone else and you know brother was sharing this week so just think about just think about the names of some of this because uh it is scripture you know uh that's being fulfilled but just think about the names of you too [Music] you too it makes it all [Music] about it's not about god it's not it's it's all about you right and and so you start looking at some of these things and satan is behind it all just using it for his glory right so so we never we never really want to you know find ourselves just out there just i'm fine i'm kind of getting to the point where i just don't have enough time to keep up with it all amen you know you know people used to repent because they spent so much time shopping or or doing this and then spend enough time with the lord they used to repent go to church and repent of things like that now we should be repentant of all this time we spend on social media god has taken my time from you i need to be i need to be spending more time with you listening to the word and and feeling word look you can't listen to everybody podcast you can't you ain't got enough time praise the lord hallelujah i've only got enough time to listen to the word but that's the only thing that's gonna change me that's the only thing gonna help me in this hour glory to god glory to god brother i appreciate the word amen i appreciate it amen today this is this is all right and i thank god for our precious brothers from borington amen and walked in here my wife sent me in texas we got some from some of the brothers from boys and i said well praise god come out we got a drama because i knew our drummer was out so god bless man i appreciate y'all uh i really do i really do and uh i mean i'm sitting here listening and i'm i'm hearing a singer over here now i don't know how many songs you sing in solo but it's time for you to step out into that role you got something that lord want to use you got something the lord want to use so god bless you amen praise the lord let's have a lord of prayer amen as we prepare to dismiss father we thank you for being here in the presence of the lord today and god everything that you've done from the first note that was played god to the last word is spoken you've proven to be in our midst and we pray god that we would uh lord that we would take advantage of the things that we've heard we will allow this word to really transform us and change us god we we're we're happy to be called to the generation of the upright there are blessings that that that go with that and lord it was it was red it was red it was red god that wealth and riches would be in their house lord we don't have to long and wait for these things this is something that you promised

to pass lord as we uh just go today father may we go reflecting and thinking on what it is that we've heard and may we father just allow the word to process amen in and through us god and may you just continue to get glory out of lies that we would live that we would be a true lighthouse god to somebody else that's walking in darkness father we pray your blessings upon your servant lord brother smiley thank you for him just getting himself out of the way lord and allowing you to speak through him to us lord we leave strengthened and encouraged by the word of god leave challenged by the word of god and we thank you for that father we ask we as we go from this place but not from your presence may we go meditating and thinking on the word of god keep us until we're able to come together
