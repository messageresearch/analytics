[21:22] update on our building fund a man and
[21:25] where we where we are
[21:28] praise the Lord as you can see there a
[21:31] man what we just said as a goal a man
[21:37] for to raise this year was 105 thousand
[21:39] what we have pledged on that goal was
[21:42] sixty thousand nine dollars and what we
[21:45] have received here today has been to a
[21:47] thousand seven hundred and seventy
[21:49] dollars a man and nine cents last but
[21:54] just last month we received two thousand
[21:58] nine hundred ninety one dollars and
[21:59] seventy two cents so I'm just grateful
[22:04] about $3,000 they made $9 shorter $3,000
[22:10] for last month and you know in a time
[22:13] where this supposed to be a pandemic God
[22:16] is still blessing it's right God is
[22:18] still moving amen in the midst of all of
[22:21] that so we think God for that and with
[22:24] the money that we have
[22:26] in the bank and we've accumulated $265
[22:29] and 15 cent of interests and again
[22:32] that's positive in the midst of this
[22:34] which gives us a total of 13,000 $35 at
[22:39] 24 cent and and we have not touched our
[22:44] for nothing
[22:45] no transfers not used we're not robbing
[22:50] Peter to pay Paul
[22:53] and I'm grateful for that because you
[22:55] know I told you for the past couple
[22:57] years we you know we have a hefty amount
[23:00] of rent that we have to pay here for
[23:02] this place and all the times when people
[23:04] ask me they say you know brother Jack
[23:06] want to just find somewhere else it's
[23:08] much it'll be much cheaper I say this is
[23:10] Palm Beach County
[23:11] everywhere you go gonna be like this and
[23:14] you know and and and I say so that's
[23:17] just what it is but the same God that
[23:19] can provide 300 dollars can provide
[23:22] $3,000 right so whatever I need is God I
[23:25] will provide and he has proven that over
[23:27] and over again so I told y'all we were
[23:29] you know sometimes we were struggling
[23:30] and try to get the rent together we
[23:32] always paid but sometimes it was late
[23:35] once again goddess did it where we can
[23:37] write a check on the first week of the
[23:39] month take it and drop it off
[23:41] and you know I'm grateful for that
[23:43] because you know there's a lot of
[23:45] churches can't do that a lot of churches
[23:46] closed them down even right now he
[23:48] didn't have enough to sustain that but
[23:50] God is keeping us open please we've got
[23:52] to praise the Lord it's keeping our so

[41:13] to Luke 7 and and as we read this you
[41:19] know I gotta say this morning we want to
[41:23] snatch all the power away from
[41:25] coronavirus we want to put all of it
[41:31] back in God amen so no matter what
[41:34] you're going through
[41:35] let's put that in the scripture right I
[41:38] was at 55 let's start reading that uh
[41:42] verse 6 the Bible says seek ye the Lord
[41:47] while he may be found call ye upon him
[41:51] while he is near then the wicked forsake
[41:54] his way and the unrighteous man his
[41:58] thoughts and let him return unto the
[42:02] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[42:06] to our God for he will abundantly pardon
[42:11] now if we wonder why God let this verse
[42:16] go forth he's telling the wicked to
[42:18] return he's telling them they'll be
[42:20] pardoned call upon his name and now he's
[42:23] gonna address us who's already here
[42:26] he says for my thoughts are higher than
[42:30] your thoughts you know sometimes we
[42:31] believe people can't come back after
[42:33] they sinned
[42:35] we believe what they've done you know
[42:37] they don't reserve the grace of God but
[42:38] he says he says for my socks are not
[42:41] your thoughts neither are my ways and
[42:45] you know your ways my ways saith the
[42:47] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[42:51] the earth so are my ways higher than
[42:54] your ways and my salts then you're a
[42:57] salt he may keep that in mind let's go
[43:00] to Luke the seventh chapter we serve a
[43:07] merciful God Luke seven and just to make
[43:15] the reading short let's go to verse 37
[43:21] I'm just back up let's go to 36 and one
[43:26] of the Pharisees Luke 39 and 36 and one
[43:28] of the Pharisees desired him that he
[43:31] would eat with him and he went into the
[43:33] Pharisees house and sat down to meat and
[43:35] behold a woman in a city which was a
[43:38] sinner when she knew that Jesus said and
[43:42] meet in the Pharisees house bought an
[43:45] alabaster box of ointment and stood at
[43:49] his feet behind him weeping and began to
[43:52] wash his feet with with tears and did
[43:55] wipe them with the hairs of her head and
[43:58] kissed his feet and anointed them with
[44:01] the ointment now when the Pharisees
[44:04] which had bidden him solid he spake
[44:07] within him saying this man if he were a
[44:10] prophet would have known who and what
[44:13] manner of woman this is that touching
[44:16] them for she is a sinner a man order
[44:20] bless reading of his words you can have
[44:22] your seats today amen do you know this
[44:31] service I want to challenge you amen
[44:33] you know my subject today is control
[44:37] your thoughts control your thoughts you
[44:41] know and we know that the Prophet he
[44:43] preached a message greater battle
[44:45] in the mind so you have the power to
[44:49] control your thoughts but one thing I
[44:51] want to make really plain you know we
[44:55] said the greatest battle ever fought is
[44:57] in the mind that doesn't mean your mind
[45:00] belongs to God remember he said battle
[45:03] that means God and the devil all God
[45:07] also wants your mind we also said well
[45:10] God wants your heart no he wants your
[45:12] mind - he wants to covet your thinking
[45:15] he wants you to think like him so don't
[45:17] just say well you know the battleground
[45:19] is a mouth it's a battleground that mean
[45:22] God wants your thoughts he wants your
[45:24] mind also you know so don't just settle
[45:27] for any kind of thing that comes to your
[45:29] mind no control your thoughts look right
[45:34] here in the Bible God says his thoughts
[45:37] are not our thoughts his ways are not
[45:39] our ways and then he started to give it
[45:42] an example of you know how high the
[45:44] heavens are and he's tall so it's saying
[45:47] up into the heavens a man and sometimes
[45:49] things take place and we just can't
[45:52] understand it
[45:53] that's because God stars I hide in your
[45:56] thoughts hallelujah and you know what I
[45:59] love about God he challenges us to
[46:01] believe amen so I say in this hour in
[46:04] this time amen gather your thoughts and
[46:07] gather them to believe in the Great God
[46:10] we know here in the Book of Luke where
[46:18] Jesus was invited to the Pharisees house
[46:21] right and you know most of the religious
[46:24] people came out but there was a similar
[46:26] I heard about Jesus being invited to
[46:29] their house now let's go get her salt
[46:31] process she wasn't invited
[46:34] she wasn't looked upon to be a Christian
[46:37] but I need to stop her from thinking she
[46:39] could be saved that day hurry you know
[46:42] she was known to be a prostitute but
[46:44] that didn't stop her from thinking she
[46:46] could be saying hallelujah
[46:48] she didn't even have any conversational
[46:50] interaction with Jesus but that didn't
[46:53] stop her from thinking
[46:57] today oh yeah that was a mindset she she
[47:02] controls her sauce against her testimony
[47:06] of prostitution oh yeah she control
[47:10] assaults against what was going on in
[47:12] the household a gift so reputation
[47:15] against what everybody else thought
[47:17] about her and she said I'm going to see
[47:20] Jesus what about you
[47:27] Church we have to control our sauce
[47:31] because in your sauce that last you
[47:34] power huh I want to read a quote to you
[47:37] man let's listen
[47:38] yes let's start out of wisdom verses
[47:40] Fame hallelujah
[47:42] wisdom versus faith look listen what the
[47:54] Prophet said he said the word was in
[47:58] gone it was gone
[48:01] it was his thoughts that was with him
[48:06] always
[48:06] now the word that we read the word that
[48:09] we do it was in Gaza and was God it was
[48:16] his daughter Leah now we say we believe
[48:18] that we are the word amen so that means
[48:22] I was in go that means I was with God
[48:25] that means that I am God
[48:32] I was in yourself so that means I don't
[49:19] know what you think about yourself but
[49:21] if you thought of God God said you are
[49:24] eternal
[49:26] let's get you thinking right a man
[49:29] he says Amen he said that a skim milk
[49:34] touch that a 2% get a one daddy
[49:39] got no hormones in it
[49:40] that's her straight milk you know
[49:46] straight milk don't need no assistance
[49:49] there's just a certain time where the
[49:52] birth take for milk is automatically
[49:55] they say that any skim milk brother see
[50:04] here here we go that means he's enjoying
[50:10] it how many of us come to church and we
[50:13] enjoy
[50:14] you see Church we enjoy hearing the word
[50:17] because we're hearing about ourselves
[50:20] Lissie say here it is here he comes

[50:27] the beginning that's in eternity now

[51:30] place because how you think ago then we
[51:38] come from eternity in the mind of God

[54:59] mistake that the Pharisees me they

[55:04] was a man trying to make himself God
[55:07] they had it twisted he was God himself a
[55:10] man became God no so what what you do i
[55:21] we have a phone we have two two lines

[55:38] call him as God first
[55:40] did you check for your mess of man let's
[55:43] control your thoughts and you know
[55:47] church amen we sometimes our mind is
[55:50] what gives place to a lot of different
[55:53] things

[56:23] thousand words
[56:24] that's me that is me and I do have on
[56:28] the chair soup and that's a jailhouse
[56:30] behind me and you say well a brother got
[56:34] locked up I don't know what brother digs
[56:37] deep but they got him this time you know
[56:41] cuz I seen the picture pictures worth a
[56:43] thousand words

[56:47] picture being worth a thousand words if
[56:51] you don't have the right country no
[56:55] doubt that's a chance no doubt that's a
[56:58] jailhouse no doubt I'm in shackles but
[57:01] what's my story
[57:04] she and with yourselves you can project
[57:07] your own picture you can protect your
[57:11] own content but what good is your pocket
[57:14] if you have to
[57:16] that's why I say come to this message
[57:19] stay with the content and you know the
[57:29] thing about earlier our mind control
[57:32] your thoughts now because you may be you
[57:35] might not know me you like Jack game up
[57:40] there preaching and clear his data's
[57:42] brother than been to jail clearance
[57:47] dating I heard he was going through
[57:49] something but I knew a guy that bad
[57:53] control your thoughts you know there's a
[57:58] lot that goes with a picture in a
[58:01] thousand words in the way we think
[58:03] cuz you say yeah I saw the picture the
[58:06] brother the brother was in a jail suit
[58:08] he was locked up he had to be locked up
[58:10] he had to do something wrong so you mean
[58:12] to tell me everybody that's in jail did
[58:14] some room because they did some role but
[58:41] God never did so every picture of the
[58:46] know the right content you know this
[58:54] picture is here so you can most of y'all
[58:58] know me from church but how many I
[59:01] really know me so if you really don't
[59:06] know me your mind can project Oh
[59:08] countless scenarios well I mean I am by
[59:14] two years
[59:16] I wonder what's up I know why brother
[59:20] Jack ain't been inviting them brother
[59:24] didn't been to jail all alone that's
[59:30] what your mind your mind I project his
[59:32] own outcome and you know Church just
[59:37] look at this picture and I said control
[59:40] yourselves you know if you got a problem
[59:42] with me your salts are gonna be evil as
[59:46] soon as you see that picture if I forgot
[59:49] to shake your hand you know told you
[59:52] nasty I told you I told you see you're
[1:00:01] projecting something without the right
[1:00:03] content but you're projecting it based
[1:00:06] upon how you feel you know maybe one day
[1:00:15] I last about here I was preaching and I
[1:00:18] stepped on your toes uh-huh see I told
[1:00:20] you I told you there was something up to
[1:00:23] him
[1:00:24] I just felt funny in my spirit when he
[1:00:27] came around when he came around it was
[1:00:32] just something funny in my spirit
[1:00:35] without even knowing the content you
[1:00:39] project all these things where's it
[1:00:42] coming from your mind it's coming from
[1:00:47] your mind and you you made up your own
[1:00:49] scenarios you didn't make me a criminal
[1:00:54] and this could have been an example of a
[1:00:57] scared straight moving something and it
[1:01:02] chose me to be the star but because you
[1:01:06] got a problem with me every thought you
[1:01:08] have is something negative and we do
[1:01:13] that all the time with one another
[1:01:14] people go through trials that are a Dane
[1:01:17] of God and the first thing we do is
[1:01:20] think something negative
[1:01:23] but the trial is our Dean of God so God
[1:01:26] if God is doing it that mean is
[1:01:28] something positive this morning Jacob
[1:01:35] and all the things that he did and he
[1:01:38] was and all the things that happened but
[1:01:40] it was God putting him in position oh
[1:01:43] yeah
[1:01:44] so you have to control your thoughts
[1:01:46] when we think about one another hey man
[1:01:48] you know that maybe in a time way you
[1:01:50] tried to talk to me and it looked like I
[1:01:52] shun you
[1:01:54] yeah he deserved to be in jail he
[1:01:58] deserves to be in jail control your
[1:02:00] thoughts Church look let's go to the
[1:02:05] coating demonology you can pull that one
[1:02:08] down brother we all come back to that Oh
[1:02:12] sister I'm sorry I'm sorry mrs. King see
[1:02:23] Jack had to do that because the enemy
[1:02:25] might have got in your thoughts why you
[1:02:28] keep calling me no man I ain't no man
[1:02:30] I'm gonna mess up the whole picture he
[1:02:35] see me back he know who I am
[1:02:40] see God knows how he said the world is a
[1:02:47] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:02:49] the heart before God desert
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:57] look search we make things what they are
[1:03:00] listen listen what the prophet of God
[1:03:02] says he says but now what stars - sees
[1:03:06] what's darker or vows
[1:03:08] what started where did it come from
[1:03:11] hallelujah where did it come from listen
[1:03:14] what he says he says now becomes a
[1:03:20] disease even exist until you accept the
[1:03:26] Spirit in your body because your mind is
[1:04:09] [Applause]
[1:04:12] yo y'all know me I got a shock you real
[1:04:15] quick hug ain't no power than that man
[1:04:18] you in how about you thinking put this
[1:04:27] on and it'll stop me from catching
[1:04:29] Corona that's what you believe in your
[1:04:32] mind
[1:04:33] but Corona is just as powerless with
[1:04:38] myself saying I'm under the blood
[1:04:40] without a mask I'm trying to tell you
[1:04:46] what to do I'm just saying you are only
[1:04:49] as powerful as your thinking oh yeah he
[1:04:52] says it becomes Harlan it's a spirit
[1:04:56] first before it becomes a disease let's
[1:04:59] think about that
[1:05:00] hallelujah how do we accept the spirit
[1:05:03] you know some mornings you make it up I
[1:05:13] think I'm coming down with something
[1:05:17] see in your mind you'll get ready to
[1:05:21] accept sickness the prophet of God said
[1:05:26] we'll get to it a little bit later
[1:05:27] he said the mind is the gateway to the
[1:05:30] soul if you receive it up here huh your
[1:05:34] mind will make it coming to make it come
[1:05:38] into existence let me tell you something
[1:05:40] to be a millionaire you have to have
[1:05:42] meat and sauce don't wake up and say I'm
[1:05:46] gonna make $20 today no you do that when
[1:05:49] you work at Burger King but me that says
[1:05:53] hey I'm gonna make thousand today
[1:05:55] hundreds or even means
[1:05:57] that's his mindset he's my a millionaire
[1:06:00] has millionaire salts and we ask the
[1:06:04] Bride of Christ we should have eternal
[1:06:07] holy assaults
[1:06:09] but in your church before it becomes a
[1:06:12] disease you have to accept it as a
[1:06:14] spirit and you know you can be coughing
[1:06:18] like was it my tote does something as
[1:06:32] simple as dust
[1:06:34] oh maybe something a little bit of
[1:06:37] saliva went down the wrong way honey
[1:06:40] but you you make it a cool when you say
[1:06:44] I think I'm coming down with a cold
[1:06:46] because you begin to invite the spirit
[1:06:49] in in another form because it starts off
[1:06:55] just in your mind
[1:06:56] hallelujah but as you begin to accept it
[1:06:59] like you know cuz sometimes um we we get
[1:07:03] sick but we put the name on it
[1:07:05] hallelujah we put the name on it when we
[1:07:08] get sick sometimes oh man I think I got
[1:07:11] the flu
[1:07:12] growing the flu gonna come cuz you
[1:07:15] called it holy
[1:07:16] remember Jesus identified the spirit by
[1:07:19] name we met up with Lisa he said what is
[1:07:23] your name she acts the demon to identify
[1:07:26] itself earlier so a lot of times they
[1:07:29] man things happen in our life things
[1:07:32] take place because of our thinking
[1:07:34] process oh yeah so I challenge you
[1:07:37] control yourself see me cancer has no
[1:07:39] power over you until you accept it as a
[1:07:44] spirit first remember it was just as
[1:07:50] powerful as Adam until she receive
[1:07:53] another man Stahl's
[1:07:58] remember the proper God said the actions
[1:08:02] star of the first scene you consume
[1:08:06] little earlier Eve had to accept the
[1:08:10] source of the serpent
[1:08:13] adultery since she became an adulterous
[1:08:16] you see the poor your thoughts make it
[1:08:21] ape when you receive the thoughts of it
[1:08:24] you make it plural you give it life amen
[1:08:30] and search as we can see listen I got go
[1:08:33] to go to the hostel next the next uh
[1:08:36] quote in Jesus Christ the same you know
[1:08:44] you wonder why Paul what makes tables
[1:08:46] like I can do all the things that Christ
[1:08:48] that stretches me that was the place he
[1:08:51] lived in he lives in a place that he
[1:08:54] believed God could do anything because
[1:08:57] of what he saw God do now I wonder how
[1:09:00] many of us have seen God do great things
[1:09:02] so listen have negative thoughts when it
[1:09:06] comes to what we need
[1:09:08] we should always reflect back to what
[1:09:11] God is already you know we talked about
[1:09:15] controlling and all these things and and
[1:09:17] on what's taking place let's just friend
[1:09:20] them if I go back to the picture Holly
[1:09:23] you know a place where I work out that
[1:09:25] you had a couple trainers and different
[1:09:27] people that go huh now we're dealing
[1:09:29] with control your thoughts you know I
[1:09:32] wish I took that same pitch I just show
[1:09:34] job and I show to the trainers and I
[1:09:36] show one one other lady that works out
[1:09:38] here with me honey

[1:09:42] really know me that because he just see
[1:09:43] me and they're working everybody called

[1:09:47] stick money see where look like they got
[1:09:50] you like you messed up red look like you
[1:09:55] done based off of the picture and him
[1:09:58] not really knowing me all he could do is
[1:10:00] judge it by what he saw and a little
[1:10:03] lady know me so to him I could be guilty
[1:10:06] of going to jail in the same place I
[1:10:10] showed it to my trainer hallelujah he
[1:10:13] pull it back up funny brother sister I'm
[1:10:16] sorry
[1:10:20] he looked at the picture and he stopped
[1:10:23] to examine he said they let you weigh
[1:10:25] that they let you have the head hold and
[1:10:28] that certain almost they let you put
[1:10:30] what was he doing he was he was examined
[1:10:33] by the sauce but he hadn't been to jail
[1:10:35] before so he was examined by his own
[1:10:42] experience that works out in in we have
[1:11:00] had extensive conversations about God
[1:11:03] the goodness of God the greatest of God
[1:11:05] she's totally obsessed I told my
[1:11:08] testimony I show her pictures I don't
[1:11:10] believe it much contact with me as you
[1:11:22] guys but just simple conversations here
[1:11:25] in their house we get to connect around
[1:11:28] the world the question when it comes to
[1:11:40] what kind of sauce comes our mind when
[1:11:43] we thinking about our sister brother
[1:11:45] first moves you got a problem with me
[1:11:54] I showed the same pitch in my church and
[1:11:59] a sister came up to me she said birdies
[1:12:01] all I can think about was you was I did
[1:12:03] preaching and he finally got you I said
[1:12:06] something that wasn't evil that was a
[1:12:08] credit to Who I am but he looked at the
[1:12:12] picture you say see I told you it wasn't
[1:12:14] something right about him told you you
[1:12:21] know some of us we got issues with one
[1:12:24] another okay and we won't say that but
[1:12:28] in our spirit when you saw that picture
[1:12:30] you said nah that's the worse already
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:48] mmm-hmm without the right content come
[1:12:54] on Jesus Christ the same I want you to
[1:12:59] understand when the prophet of God says
[1:13:02] there's enough power in here to create a
[1:13:04] world and go live on Harleys that starts
[1:13:07] up here that starts in your mind
[1:13:11] hallelujah
[1:13:12] you have the power to create the
[1:13:14] lifestyle you want to live honey you
[1:13:16] have the power to accept or reject the
[1:13:20] things of God because God is a lover you
[1:13:23] ain't gonna make us do anything
[1:13:25] hallelujah it's up to you to receive him
[1:13:28] in him but listen Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:33] he says now he says but what a man will
[1:13:36] do he will hear a little something and
[1:13:39] keep moving his papers now you talk
[1:13:41] about a man bouncing from church to
[1:13:43] church honey
[1:13:44] you hear something good over here here
[1:13:46] move over there yes I'm good over there
[1:13:48] you move over there see he's being
[1:13:50] carried away by I stimulated his mind is
[1:13:53] he's not catching it in his spirit hugs
[1:13:56] a lot of times people follow ministries
[1:13:59] that make them feel good you don't feel
[1:14:05] good
[1:14:06] so don't mean your pastor's not cold he
[1:14:17] says well now you never find Christ
[1:14:22] moving your people see God I don't do a
[1:14:25] thing
[1:14:25] Oh God God God is in the business of
[1:14:31] letting you make up your mind think
[1:14:35] about that church honey
[1:14:37] he could easily force us to believe in
[1:14:40] him but he don't God stands by how you
[1:14:45] make up your mind but you know
[1:14:47] hallelujah
[1:14:48] I learned something church over the past
[1:14:50] couple two years that I don't always
[1:14:54] need to voice my opinion on situations
[1:14:57] you know my oldest girl she sees she's
[1:15:02] getting married and she's she had to
[1:15:05] keep postponing because of this Karuna
[1:15:06] thing but you know the guys she chose
[1:15:09] didn't know nothing about this word he
[1:15:12] didn't know anything about the prophet
[1:15:14] of the hour you know wasn't even a
[1:15:16] Christian person and y'all know what I
[1:15:19] was the fool I said going down like this

[1:15:44] saying he ain't worthy I don't know in
[1:15:46] the body sometimes God I do that you
[1:15:49] don't know nothing about the situation
[1:15:50] but what he has to do is bring out those
[1:15:53] hidden things inside of you that you
[1:15:55] don't know there I asked some hidden
[1:16:01] anger inside of me
[1:16:03] I had to bring out I had some hidden
[1:16:07] things inside of me that I wouldn't I
[1:16:09] wouldn't normally agree with that God
[1:16:11] had to bring out in that moment she was
[1:16:15] introducing the young man and all the
[1:16:17] stuff if y'all would have saw me y'all
[1:16:18] be like that can't be brother team that

[1:17:02] kind of went really far but you know
[1:17:05] this ministry is so powerful so powerful
[1:17:08] it showed me a supernatural way and God
[1:17:11] does things and I think all of you can

[1:25:18] we need to practice that in church you
[1:25:21] can see a brother the sister on the side
[1:25:23] of the church talking about something in
[1:25:24] your mind either working mmm
[1:25:29] you seen a see Mary mmm
[1:25:32] why you have those kind of thoughts
[1:25:35] first about your system brother how you
[1:25:37] noting switching up prayer requests
[1:25:47] you know this covert 19 pandemic make
[1:25:52] the Bloodhound stalker there's all kind
[1:25:57] of stuff idea in the blood I'll give you
[1:26:02] but we have to control our church when
[1:26:06] we go back to the scripture hey man look
[1:26:09] at these me and honey just warming huh
[1:26:12] who I gonna be too much longer long back
[1:26:14] because this woman who's who has a
[1:26:17] reputation of a prostitute some kind of
[1:26:19] way she hears that Jesus is going to the
[1:26:23] Pharisees house they didn't run in the
[1:26:28] same circles so God must have made away
[1:26:33] father here that Jesus was near and no
[1:26:36] doubt she knew his reputation because
[1:26:39] she had a desire to see him hallelujah
[1:26:40] so you know what she does in her mind
[1:26:43] her mind that dates you like I'm getting
[1:26:46] seen again so what she did last night
[1:26:55] last night she probably was a prostitute
[1:26:57] honey but today she had different
[1:27:00] thoughts in church she goes and buys an
[1:27:03] alabaster box probably use a prostitute
[1:27:05] money
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:18] you know criticism
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:28:02] she comes from behind she pulled on him
[1:28:09] and she the glory it was in his control
[1:30:20] same thing with a woman at the well
[1:30:22] everybody's looking at her because of
[1:30:24] reputation but Jesus say he must needs
[1:30:27] go by healing everybody had particular
[1:30:31] thoughts about her but when it came to
[1:30:33] God he had thoughts of peace and not of
[1:30:35] evil what goes through your mind when
[1:30:39] you're going through things is it
[1:30:42] why me you should say why not me why not
[1:30:51] me why why wouldn't you want to be
[1:30:54] purged by the Almighty God why wouldn't
[1:30:57] you want to be tried by this unleavened
[1:31:00] bread the womb the gateway to the soul
[1:31:10] you remember now there is a worm with a
[1:31:13] physical there is a womb of the Spirit
[1:31:15] did you believe that there is a
[1:31:17] spiritual man
[1:31:19] if the mind is the wound to the spirit
[1:31:22] you accept these things in by the way
[1:31:25] you think now I bring something real
[1:31:28] simple that we've always talked about we
[1:31:31] say we're the prophets say ah if
[1:31:33] somebody deliver you a bag around snakes
[1:31:35] the box around snake you wouldn't accept
[1:31:37] it can I get any man how many of us will
[1:31:40] go down to the swamp and get you a
[1:31:42] Python
[1:31:43] none of us cuz in your mind
[1:31:46] that'll do you harm so you ain't gonna
[1:31:48] accept so why will we accept these
[1:31:51] spiritual demons demons of depression
[1:31:56] demons of hatred Envy oh yeah demons of
[1:32:01] all these things huh that'll create a
[1:32:03] spiritual disease in your life first
[1:32:10] that comes by believing Satan's lie
[1:32:13] hurry into your womb of your mind that
[1:32:16] polluted her soul talking about her her
[1:32:19] receiving the thoughts of the enemy
[1:32:22] polluted her soul and that's the only
[1:32:29] way that a woman ever can commit
[1:32:31] adultery against a husband is to firstly
[1:32:33] some man talk her into it
[1:32:39] so before you did it you had several
[1:32:42] conversations you talked to me told you

[1:36:45] by sneaking from from one freight train
[1:36:48] to the next first first of all he was
[1:36:51] wrong he was supposed to be sneaking
[1:36:54] from trainer train he says one night he
[1:36:57] climbed and he climbed into what he
[1:37:00] thought was a bus car when his eyes
[1:37:02] adjusted to the light he realized he was
[1:37:05] inside a refrigerator freezer boxcar he
[1:37:09] was in a freezer now can't you imagine
[1:37:11] what's going through his mind I gotta
[1:37:14] get up out of here
[1:37:16] he said he became aware of the intense
[1:37:20] freezing cold he
[1:37:22] for him and pounding on the door but all
[1:37:25] the noise he made from inside the car
[1:37:28] failed to attract anyone's attention
[1:37:31] after many hours of struggle he lay down
[1:37:34] on the floor holier he lay down on the
[1:37:37] floor of the railroad car see he was
[1:37:40] locked in and now he's getting cold he's
[1:37:43] freezing is beating on the door he's

[1:37:52] creating an atmosphere she's locked
[1:37:56] through he's in a boxcar true he's
[1:37:59] locked in but listen he tried to fight
[1:38:05] against the freezing cold he scratched a
[1:38:08] message on the floor that this is easy
[1:38:10] and reached his last point he feels like
[1:38:13] he's dying I'm dying so he said let me
[1:38:15] scratch on the floor and leave a message
[1:38:17] for when they find me he didn't already
[1:38:20] produced his death we're okay
[1:38:24] these are my scratches on the floor I'm
[1:38:26] freezing up cold when they find me I got
[1:38:29] to let him know what happened the mind
[1:38:33] is powerful he said he tried to fight
[1:38:42] against the freezing cold he scratched a
[1:38:43] message on the floor explaining it's
[1:38:45] unfortunate enemy death late the next
[1:38:48] day repairman from the railroad open the
[1:38:52] door and found and found the dead man
[1:38:56] inside listen to that next day repair me
[1:39:04] repairman found him
[1:39:07] why repairman because the freezer did
[1:39:11] not work Church when they found him
[1:39:16] earlier what happened was he heard the
[1:39:19] fan blowing and he thought it was a
[1:39:21] refrigerator but it was the same
[1:39:23] temperature from outdoor being blown
[1:39:25] into the boxcar and in his mind earlier
[1:39:31] he produced freezing temperature
[1:39:35] he was being blue they said it was like
[1:40:02] it was inside the box he was in his mind
[1:40:29] all the appearance of having the most
[1:41:16] likely the temperature of the railroad
[1:41:18] car had never fallen below 50 degrees so
[1:41:26] where did he die first control your
[1:41:30] thoughts the man had died because he
[1:41:35] thought he was freezing to death and I
[1:41:40] wonder how often
[1:41:42] do we get what we're thinking certain
[1:41:46] things happen because of our thought
[1:41:48] process certain things we go through is
[1:41:51] because of how we think remember the
[1:41:53] prophet of God said you are what your
[1:41:55] thoughts are so we need to challenge
[1:41:58] ourselves to control our thoughts oh
[1:42:00] yeah we need to have thoughts that I'm
[1:42:03] the head and not the tail I'm blessed in
[1:42:05] that curse hallelujah I'm royalty amen
[1:42:08] I'm the son of a king amen hallelujah we
[1:42:12] need to have those kind of thoughts
[1:42:13] first but as I close put the last
[1:42:17] picture back up sis

[1:45:14] I said what we need God to do he's
[1:45:19] breaking the shackles in our life and
[1:45:23] sometimes it's who told you that was it
[1:45:31] God or is it just your way of thinking
[1:45:33] huh sometimes we got things we struggle
[1:45:36] with but all it is is God trying to give
[1:45:39] us to cry out for help God trying to
[1:45:41] give us to cry out and say lord I need
[1:45:43] you but instead of us crying out because
[1:45:46] we got so much pride we keep doing
[1:45:48] shackles on but let me tell you
[1:45:50] something honey if you're not careful
[1:45:52] you're gonna find yourself getting
[1:45:54] tuning in life
[1:45:57] how did you do that douses so if you
[1:46:03] ever see that first picture circling on
[1:46:07] the internet you ever see it some kind
[1:46:13] of way somebody then got a hold of it
[1:46:15] they did extreme shot at it they didn't
[1:46:18] I cheated they didn't Facebook it and
[1:46:22] they spreading it around taste it with
[1:46:24] the jelly just oh we got you know and
[1:46:28] this is what I hate people who want to
[1:46:29] gossip in Colliers and we need to pray
[1:46:32] for our brother nobody to pray for me
[1:46:36] just pray we got a call so we gotta pray
[1:46:39] for our brother you ain't hurt seeing in
[1:46:44] mind they got other things that we want
[1:46:46] to say but if you ever see that picture
[1:46:49] circulating it something you to defend
[1:46:51] me because you know the truth you know
[1:46:56] the truth about your brother so you got
[1:46:59] to come to my defense
[1:47:00] oh yeah and you know I shouldn't say
[1:47:05] this but I like to shoot down a person
[1:47:09] that believed lies I do it in a nice way
[1:47:14] but when somebody come bring stuff to
[1:47:17] you you know it ain't true I'm quick to
[1:47:20] say no no they I'm like no no I'm like
[1:47:24] that I know pastor whoo whoo God moved
[1:47:27] him to another church and this is these
[1:47:29] brothers I'm save us by God's grace I'm
[1:47:35] about to close we've been blessed to get
[1:47:40] a great revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:47:42] we've been blessed and know things that
[1:47:44] a lot of people don't know and sometimes
[1:47:47] because of that it produces a pride and
[1:47:51] mashes believer can be some other
[1:47:58] they can be some of the cruelest people
[1:48:00] on earth because they know the
[1:48:03] revelation they don't believe that
[1:48:05] children can make mistakes they don't
[1:48:07] believe that hallelujah that things can
[1:48:09] happen in a marriage and and all these
[1:48:11] studies of not knowing the content not
[1:48:23] knowing whether God is in control of
[1:48:25] this thing remember brother babe
[1:48:31] hey man just mind his own business catch
[1:48:33] a ride if I if I got it right catch a
[1:48:35] ride with some guys and did something
[1:48:37] crazy and all this to get stopped by the
[1:48:39] police and he'd find himself going to
[1:48:41] jail innocent with a bunch of crooks why
[1:48:45] would God let that happen to a man of
[1:48:47] God he did nothing wrong when did one
[1:48:50] bother nobody
[1:48:51] he was pretty much in the wrong place at
[1:48:53] the wrong time but no that was the will
[1:48:54] of God because there were people in that
[1:48:57] jail huh that God had ready to receive
[1:49:04] the Word of God you know what people do
[1:49:13] in jail oh I just oh Jesus when it was
[1:49:22] all God sees us before we judge
[1:49:27] something by this make sure we got the
[1:49:30] right content what you thinking huh Leah
[1:49:34] is what you are so when you see things
[1:49:38] happen be like a Bible saying I believe
[1:49:40] this slow speed quickly here quick -
[1:49:45] listen let's be that way
[1:49:47] but a lot of times we need complete
[1:49:49] opposite we quickly speak don't wanna
[1:49:54] hear and don't want to listen
[1:49:58] remember the prophet of God said they
[1:50:01] were blaming this man for something he
[1:50:03] was supposed to do with a woman and he
[1:50:05] proved that he wasn't even there
[1:50:07] and they still condemned although you
[1:50:11] had the proof throughout the day let's
[1:50:16] control our thoughts now this message
[1:50:19] and condemn you but this message is to
[1:50:22] show you that your thoughts have power
[1:50:24] to control your life I know I know the
[1:50:27] sister who's in the Philippines and it
[1:50:29] was in church hallelujah brother was
[1:50:31] preaching on these lines then we were
[1:50:33] children of God and we come from God and
[1:50:35] so forth and after service they went
[1:50:38] down to the water to the ocean her
[1:50:40] brother got in the water and got lost
[1:50:43] Church and they prayed for hours crying
[1:50:46] out for him crying out falling pray for
[1:50:48] hours like where's my brother he did a
[1:50:50] search party all these things some
[1:50:53] people said he's gone he's drowned you
[1:50:57] know the water in got him but that
[1:50:59] sister she began to refresh her brother
[1:51:02] she began to reflect see now she's gonna
[1:51:05] respond because she have thoughts of
[1:51:10] love for her brother
[1:51:11] hallelujah so now she begins to think
[1:51:13] what the Word of God see that we are
[1:51:15] choosing of God and we had the power of
[1:51:17] the spoken word and all these things she
[1:51:19] walks up to the ocean hallelujah oh she
[1:51:24] walks up to the ocean stretches out her
[1:51:26] hands huh and she begins to quote some
[1:51:29] of the things that the man hallelujah
[1:51:31] God said that morning and she said ocean
[1:51:34] I command you
[1:51:35] give up my brother and write what she
[1:51:38] said that he came washing ashore
[1:51:43] they search for him for hours
[1:51:47] all it took was somebody hungry to speak
[1:51:51] the word that was in their mind and it
[1:51:54] became a manifestation is not some I
[1:52:04] don't know brain huh the ocean can't
[1:52:07] communicate with me so what was it it
[1:52:09] was creation here in the create came
[1:52:19] washes up on shore he just got up and it
[1:52:31] was like whether you been well you just
[1:52:32] what happened sounds asleep
[1:52:36] how'd you sleep in the water the only
[1:52:42] ones I know do that is these sharks and
[1:52:45] whales and fish hurry
[1:52:49] washed up on shore and they were like
[1:52:51] will you do or hear me say I was asleep
[1:52:53] I don't know our God is an awesome God
[1:52:59] come come
[1:53:06] control your thoughts because you can
[1:53:10] even create life or you can create death
[1:53:13] and like I say in this time with the
[1:53:16] pandemic and all the stuff going on have
[1:53:20] the right thought cuz like I said
[1:53:24] someone's getting free money the
[1:53:29] blessings of covert 19 some of us are
[1:53:34] spending more time that we ever did with
[1:53:38] our families the blessings of Cova 90
[1:53:42] some of us are now having family dinner
[1:53:46] that we never had the blessings
[1:53:52] overnight some of us got a greater
[1:54:01] hunger and desire for God like I said
[1:54:09] don't be one of them people have this go
[1:54:11] and they open up the state and everybody
[1:54:13] back going you go back haha no remember

[1:54:33] into something that we can use

[1:54:38] we see things unfold and we see things
[1:54:40] take place father help us to have the
[1:54:42] right thought process proposed they have
[1:54:45] the right attitude when it comes to the
[1:54:47] things of God and Lord even the things
[1:54:49] that we don't understand the things that
[1:54:51] we may see Lord and we don't understand
[1:54:53] opposed to remember that your ways are
[1:54:56] higher than our ways your thoughts are
[1:54:58] higher than our thoughts Lord and all
[1:55:00] God's just supposed to reflect back on
[1:55:02] the Word of God Lord when our eyes are
[1:55:04] trying to control our mind Lord let us
