[6:14] real pleasure to be having the
[6:16] opportunity to stand before you
[6:19] amen with standing the effects
[6:23] of a changing culture
[6:26] withstanding the effects
[6:28] of a changing culture
[6:32] look here and we're going to take our
[6:34] reading from the word here tonight on
[6:37] James 4.
[6:39] amen
[6:40] James the fourth chapter
[6:43] beginning at the first verse
[6:46] amen
[6:49] James the fourth chapter beginning at
[6:52] the first verse we'll read down down to
[6:54] the seventh verse
[6:57] amen
[7:00] I'm still here
[7:02] to say the wrestling of the Marbury
[7:05] trees
[7:07] amen
[7:09] I can hear the wrestling at a mulberry
[7:12] trees amen
[7:15] we still like to hear the rustler the
[7:17] mulberry trees as technology has got to
[7:19] throw a face now we don't even get a
[7:20] Russell little mulberry trees no more
[7:23] hey man
[7:26] but that's all right
[7:29] amen
[7:30] first verse from Once come Wars and
[7:33] fightings among you
[7:36] come they not hence
[7:39] even of your lusts that war
[7:43] in your members
[7:48] ye lust and have not
[7:52] he killed and desire to have
[7:56] and cannot obtain
[7:59] ye fight in war
[8:02] yet ye have not because ye ask not
[8:08] he asked and receive not
[8:12] because ye asked amiss
[8:16] that ye may consume it upon your lust
[8:22] he adulterers and adulteresses
[8:26] know ye not
[8:27] that the Friendship of the world
[8:31] is enmity with God
[8:35] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[8:38] the world
[8:39] is the enemy of God
[8:43] do you think that the scripture saith in
[8:46] vain
[8:47] the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth
[8:50] to envy
[8:54] but he giveth more grace
[8:56] wherefore he saith
[8:58] God resisteth the proud
[9:02] but giveth Grace unto the humble
[9:06] submit yourselves therefore to God
[9:10] and
[9:12] the devil
[9:14] will flee and resist the devil
[9:18] and he will flee from you
[9:21] amen now if we just go back here a
[9:23] little bit and just want to dissect this
[9:26] this little section of reading a little
[9:28] bit we've made amen
[9:31] the the the the
[9:32] lust here that he's he's speaking of is
[9:35] uh speaking up there in John 1 the
[9:38] second chapter the 16th verse where he
[9:40] says uh for all that is in the world
[9:45] the lust of the eye the lust of the
[9:48] Flesh and the pride of life
[9:52] is not of the father
[9:54] but of this world amen so
[9:59] he's he's talking about a fleshly lust
[10:02] but it's a lust amen for the things of
[10:05] the world that James here is mainly
[10:07] speaking of he says here that ye ask and
[10:10] received not because you ask amits
[10:13] sometimes we ask for things uh out of a
[10:17] lust
[10:18] to satisfy our own lust it's not that
[10:22] it's something that that we should have
[10:24] something that would do us good we ask
[10:27] because uh the Joneses may have one
[10:30] we ask out of a out of a worldly desire
[10:33] see I will our desire should be his will
[10:38] what is your fear what if it's anything
[10:41] that's going to take me further away
[10:43] from you or hinder me I don't want it
[10:46] amen see sometimes we ask amiss we have
[10:49] to make sure amen that our motive and
[10:52] objectives is Right amen so uh he goes
[10:56] on here and he talked about yeah
[10:57] adulterers adulteresses
[10:59] spiritual adulterer spiritual
[11:02] adulteresses ye know that friendship of
[11:07] the world is enmity to God now that word
[11:10] friendship is talking about Fellowship
[11:13] amen fellowship with the world now we're
[11:16] talking here that the title of this
[11:19] message is withstanding
[11:22] the changing culture
[11:25] see
[11:26] withstanding the effects
[11:29] of a changing culture we have to be able
[11:34] to recognize a man that some everything
[11:37] is not of God and because that we're
[11:41] here and culture is is is is is is is
[11:44] constantly changing amen that we have to
[11:48] be careful to to withstand the effects
[11:51] of it
[11:52] amen because see there's a fact
[11:57] all of these different
[11:58] um
[11:59] um um things that just the world may
[12:02] think it's okay
[12:03] the world may believe that world there's
[12:05] nothing wrong with this but we have to
[12:08] be able to recognize how it's affecting
[12:10] us
[12:11] amen uh uh uh
[12:15] he said enmity of the world now this
[12:18] word here world
[12:20] is talking about the Greek word a man
[12:23] the world Cosmos
[12:25] and in defining that we're talking about
[12:28] that it says the arrangement or the
[12:31] Constitution order government the system
[12:36] of man's order
[12:39] amen
[12:41] the headship of man without the need of
[12:45] God
[12:46] that's this world Cosmos that we live in
[12:50] we recognize that we live in this lady
[12:53] of CN age amen where Pete the way that
[12:56] where they are rich and have need of
[12:58] nothing
[13:00] amen they feel that they are are quite
[13:03] wise and and they don't need a God
[13:05] anymore
[13:06] amen there's no hunger
[13:09] we we got this
[13:12] we can do this for ourselves amen
[13:16] um that's this this the attitude of this
[13:19] lady you're seeing age here but and and
[13:22] and they come up with all kind of
[13:24] inventions and ideas and different
[13:25] things of that nature and these things
[13:27] sometimes affects us let me let me let
[13:30] me let um
[13:33] talk about this a little bit there's a
[13:35] thing called osmosis
[13:37] now
[13:39] much of the way that we conduct our
[13:42] everyday lives
[13:43] comes from a force of habit that was
[13:47] already been uh
[13:50] uh uh uh how should I say into us by
[13:54] representation
[13:56] it has been an influence from someone or
[14:00] someone in our lives or about our
[14:02] habitation around us
[14:05] amen now here the prophet in the message
[14:09] uh
[14:11] God being misunderstood
[14:13] uh
[14:16] section 20 if you get it says that's
[14:19] appreciated but if not that's okay he
[14:21] says he
[14:22] said Christian brother sister
[14:26] now most times when you find people
[14:30] that's got a stubborn spirits
[14:33] it's usually a complex that causes this
[14:37] either they have inherited it from a
[14:41] mother a father
[14:43] and Uncle an aunt or a grandmother or a
[14:48] grandfather
[14:50] somebody like that
[14:52] if you trace back down through your life
[14:55] you find now I've taken this by
[14:59] experience under discernment because I
[15:02] have had met cases on the platform
[15:06] thousands of those that had that spirit
[15:10] and the first thing you know I traced
[15:13] that Spirit right back by discernment
[15:15] and find that there was a granddaddy
[15:18] there was a grandmother there was
[15:21] somebody else back there that you
[15:24] inherited at from by Nature
[15:27] see it was your culture
[15:30] it was how you what you was raised up in
[15:34] amen that that allowed that Spirit of
[15:37] stubbornness a man to be pressed into
[15:40] you by what you saw around you
[15:43] the things that you experienced in your
[15:46] upbringing and in your everyday life but
[15:49] Church me must be able to withstand the
[15:52] effects of this culture
[15:55] amen
[15:57] it's it's it's it's sort of like this
[16:01] oh my
[16:03] if we
[16:06] were to
[16:08] another definition before I get ahead of
[16:10] myself let me talk about this osmosis
[16:12] osmosis is
[16:15] is a a
[16:18] the example is a a pressurized
[16:21] Submachine or submarine
[16:24] go down into the water
[16:27] amen and down it designed to go down in
[16:31] that water so it has to be pressurized
[16:34] to be able to withstand that atmosphere
[16:39] or the water will seep into it
[16:43] so what they have to do is they have to
[16:47] make sure that the pressure on the
[16:50] inside of the submarine is greater than
[16:52] the pressure on the outside
[16:56] amen
[16:57] so see that's the same thing here on us
[17:00] we are surrounded amen uh here uh by a
[17:06] changing culture
[17:07] we're surrounded here by things amen
[17:12] of this Kingdom but this is not our home
[17:16] amen we are not from here amen we have
[17:20] to uh be able to stand depression
[17:25] amen we have to have something down on
[17:28] the inside that is a greater pressure
[17:30] than the outside or what will happen is
[17:34] the outside forces would begin to seep
[17:36] in
[17:37] amen
[17:39] the prophet of God here uh he preached
[17:43] on this and he preached a message
[17:48] uh
[17:51] what was the message here countdown in
[17:54] the message countdown
[17:55] he says get in my brother's sister
[17:59] you must get pressurized
[18:02] the pressure won't hurt you
[18:06] when you get on the ends when you get it
[18:09] on the inside
[18:11] and get pressurized
[18:13] Christ and you
[18:16] won't care what the world says they
[18:20] can't never hit you anyhow
[18:23] you're safe you're tucked in amen
[18:27] see because you're pressurized Jesus
[18:31] Christ is our great and glorious
[18:33] astronaut
[18:34] to that we will be in he's the great and
[18:37] glorious astronaut too that will be in
[18:41] that will Propel Us by the Holy Ghost
[18:45] power and fire when she begins to fly
[18:48] out
[18:49] amen one of these mornings the Holy
[18:52] Ghost Fire hit the earth like that and
[18:55] when they do the church will be lifted
[18:58] up
[18:59] and all the nations will stand
[19:02] and they won't need a television they'll
[19:06] see him every knee shall bow every
[19:09] tongue shall confess as she propels her
[19:13] way into Yonder into the Glorious rim of
[19:16] Heaven to be married to her bridegroom
[19:19] but amen my brothers and sisters to go
[19:21] there you must be
[19:24] pressurized
[19:26] you must be pressurized in him amen amen
[19:31] so we see here that uh uh we the only
[19:34] way Amen to be pressurized amen is
[19:38] through Christ here now
[19:41] osmosis is is the the fact a man of of
[19:45] something being pressed into you amen
[19:48] that that that about this culture this
[19:52] lifestyle amen this lady you're seeing
[19:54] weighs and different things being
[19:57] pressed into you it's constant amen the
[20:00] prophet says here that he says much of
[20:03] our learning is done unconsciously
[20:07] amen it's not a conscious learning and
[20:10] this is how the osmosis and things of
[20:12] this of of this life is unconscious
[20:15] amen it's something that's that that
[20:18] takes place down in our subconscious
[20:21] realm we take on these things the
[20:24] gradual part takes the gradual part one
[20:28] part to another from a membrane
[20:31] but the same word osmosis is also used
[20:36] for the process which ideas and
[20:39] information are absorbed without
[20:42] conscious effort
[20:45] it is the way it is the way in which
[20:47] ideas
[20:49] and information
[20:50] gradually spread between people
[20:54] amen
[20:56] you pick up the ways and culture
[20:59] subconsciously
[21:01] just by being surrounded by it all the
[21:05] time
[21:06] amen
[21:15] amen
[21:18] the prophet said here in the uh
[21:22] the message
[21:24] future home with the Heavenly bridegroom
[21:26] the Earthly bride
[21:28] he said it's like a man crossing the sea
[21:32] the man goes across the sea
[21:38] the real man that's driving the ship he
[21:40] never sees where he's going
[21:42] he's down in the bowels of the ship
[21:47] he's the engineer the man setting up
[21:49] here in the deck
[21:52] he gives him orders from that man into
[21:55] the Crow's Nest so you have three men
[21:57] you have a man in the Crow's Nest you
[21:59] have a man on deck and you have the
[22:01] engineer down in in the bowels of the
[22:04] ship
[22:06] the man in the powers of the ship really
[22:07] drives the boat
[22:09] he gives it Power to Go
[22:11] amen he in order for uh uh the rudder
[22:15] the man on the deck turns the the wheel
[22:17] and it's a little Rudder in the back of
[22:19] the ship that turned but what really
[22:21] turns to ship is that engineer because
[22:22] he give this engine more power give this
[22:24] engine less power and and cause the ship
[22:27] to turn
[22:28] it's
[22:30] so the man in the Crow's Nest is
[22:32] basically the eyes
[22:34] he's look out and he see something ahead
[22:36] and he'll uh phone down to the guy on
[22:39] the deck um to tell the the guy on the
[22:41] deck uh uh or what's coming up and he'll
[22:44] say well whether we got to turn so many
[22:46] degrees this way or so many degrees that
[22:48] way and then he'll send the message down
[22:49] to the guy and engineer see so all of
[22:51] these things must be in harmony
[22:53] amen because if the guy on the deck
[22:55] tells the guy in the in the bows of the
[22:57] ship to do something and he does
[22:58] something different well you now you got
[23:00] chaos
[23:02] see now you got chaos
[23:04] so the the man in the bowels of the ship
[23:07] he can't just run them up
[23:09] amen but if if if if if if if if we're
[23:12] trying to keep the ship afloat
[23:14] we're trying to keep this thing from
[23:17] taking on water that is supposed to be
[23:20] on the outside
[23:21] amen because if something goes wrong and
[23:23] this thing begins to take on water
[23:25] what's going to happen there's a chance
[23:27] there that everyone could perish
[23:29] see we have to be able to amen how we
[23:32] withstand the effects of this culture
[23:35] that's on the outside see we're in a
[23:36] culture of water
[23:38] amen and we're in the ship
[23:40] and but we have a certain culture on the
[23:43] inside of the ship so we have to be in
[23:45] unity of the spirit amen to keep that
[23:48] culture on the outside of the ship or we
[23:50] would perish
[23:51] amen
[23:53] so we have to have that Unity of of of
[23:55] of of of of of information amen the the
[23:58] the mental must agree with the heart
[24:01] amen and the Heart must agree with the
[24:03] soul amen because see we're constantly
[24:05] going to get thoughts
[24:10] let me let you look at this real quick
[24:12] here
[24:14] I have here
[24:16] amen
[24:19] a article
[24:23] um
[24:25] it's by a lady named Kelly uh
[24:30] baladu that's the best I can uh her name
[24:34] there it's called managing intrusive
[24:37] thoughts now this is science
[24:40] this is a Harvard study
[24:44] disturbing thoughts that pop into your
[24:48] mind
[24:50] unbidden
[24:51] may make you feel uneasy
[24:54] but they are common
[24:57] and there are strategies strategies you
[25:01] can use to manage them
[25:03] thoughts
[25:04] now let me read some of this here
[25:07] it seems to come out of nowhere
[25:09] a strange disturbing thought
[25:13] or a troubling image that pops into your
[25:18] mind
[25:19] it might be violent
[25:21] or sexual
[25:23] or a reoccurring fear that you'll do
[25:27] something inappropriate or embarrassing
[25:30] whatever the content it's often
[25:32] unsettling it may and may bring on a
[25:36] feeling of worry or shame
[25:40] now I heard somewhere else
[25:42] that
[25:44] a thought
[25:46] if you think on a thought
[25:49] for more than 30 seconds
[25:52] it becomes a Feeling
[25:57] and once it becomes a feeling it's
[26:01] harder to get rid of the feeling than it
[26:03] is the thought
[26:06] amen
[26:08] so this is what James was talking about
[26:10] he said you must resist the devil
[26:15] and he will flee from you
[26:18] let's look at what the prophet said
[26:19] about it here
[26:22] amen
[26:27] in that same quote there God being
[26:29] misunderstood
[26:31] he said stubbornness is not of God
[26:35] and now the only way you get away from
[26:38] that is you have to have faith to
[26:41] overcome it
[26:43] you are a Christian
[26:45] you are a son or daughter of God
[26:47] whichever you may be
[26:49] and you'll never be able to stand and
[26:52] rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it
[26:56] just like a tantalizing a rattlesnake
[27:01] laying there ready to bite you
[27:05] why are you tantalizing this rattlesnake
[27:08] he says if you just ignore him
[27:12] and walk away
[27:14] from him he can't hurt you
[27:17] amen it's a thought
[27:19] the thought comes along why do you
[27:22] continue to worry about that thought and
[27:24] think on that thought and think on that
[27:26] thought and think on that thought cast
[27:28] that thing out and move on
[27:31] cast it down and move on don't even
[27:34] think about it anymore
[27:36] you get a pain the devil's gonna tell
[27:38] you oh it's this oh it's that cast that
[27:42] thought down right away and move on
[27:48] amen
[27:49] so when you feel that you got that
[27:52] stubborn Spirit lay that thing on the
[27:55] Altar and believe God that that thing is
[27:57] dead and you'll never have no more
[28:02] and go on and don't even pay attention
[28:05] to it anymore
[28:07] and that thing will leave you resist the
[28:10] devil and he will flee
[28:13] flee means he will run from you
[28:17] get away quick
[28:19] so that would be my advice on how to
[28:23] overcome
[28:25] from the prophet amen
[28:28] so we see
[28:30] amen that
[28:32] these thoughts let me go back to this
[28:34] article here
[28:39] oh
[28:42] these intrusive thoughts they'll bring
[28:46] on if you continue to think on them long
[28:48] enough it'll bring on a Feeling
[28:50] amen intrusive thoughts are these are
[28:54] called
[28:55] a thought to us our thought to affect
[28:59] some six million Americans according to
[29:03] the anxiety and depression Association
[29:06] of America now see that's another thing
[29:08] that it'll cause we know them as spirits
[29:12] amen it will you think on these things
[29:15] it can bring that feeling it can bring
[29:17] anxiety and depression
[29:21] sometimes intrusive thoughts are
[29:23] associated with mental disorders
[29:26] such as obsessive compulsive disorder
[29:30] where thoughts become so bothersome that
[29:34] they prompt repetitive behaviors
[29:36] or compulsions to try to prevent them
[29:40] see a lot of times it's the people a lot
[29:42] of people say I'm hearing voices these
[29:44] are the thoughts
[29:46] nothing but the devil
[29:48] these are the thoughts
[29:50] that keep coming to their mind and they
[29:53] and trying to get rid of them they'll do
[29:55] certain things
[29:56] they'll act out in certain ways
[29:59] trying to get rid of the thought
[30:01] but we know that's just being a a
[30:03] tormented by an evil spirit
[30:06] amen
[30:07] they are also common in post-traumatic
[30:11] stress disorder which can be triggered
[30:13] by a life-threatening or extremely
[30:15] stressful event such as an accident a
[30:18] violent attack
[30:19] but many people who experience these
[30:22] thoughts don't have mental disorders
[30:25] amen
[30:27] intrusive thoughts are often triggered
[30:29] by stress or anxiety
[30:32] they may also be short-term problems
[30:34] brought on by by biological factors such
[30:37] as the hormone ship
[30:38] a woman having a baby
[30:41] menopause
[30:43] a child reaching puberty
[30:46] amen a man going through what we call
[30:49] midlife crisis
[30:51] these things make a person hormonal
[30:54] shifts make a person vulnerable to these
[30:57] kind of things
[30:58] because you're at that point at a weaken
[31:01] State this is why we need a man to be
[31:04] pressurized
[31:05] amen pressurized to be able to withstand
[31:08] Amen to your cup the effects of this
[31:11] changing culture to recognize what it is
[31:15] Amen to recognize that uh I see exactly
[31:18] where you're at there but I see exactly
[31:20] what you're doing I rebuke you and I
[31:22] resist you
[31:23] in the name of Jesus Christ and move on
[31:26] amen don't accept that thing
[31:29] amen
[31:32] uh the prophet was talking here
[31:35] amen and um
[31:40] says now in the future home says now
[31:44] you think you've got faith
[31:47] and he says here the first thing you
[31:49] have to
[31:50] uh have is a base for faith
[31:55] that God's word
[31:57] well the man goes to school and learns
[32:01] theology he reads it
[32:04] said God said so yes I believe it
[32:08] he believes in here
[32:10] in his mind
[32:12] but it's got to be a subconscious also
[32:17] and that subconscious disagrees
[32:20] with this
[32:23] because when he starts to do it he's a
[32:27] little bit scared it won't happen
[32:30] amen
[32:32] so our we have to
[32:34] we we we we live in this world and and
[32:37] and and by what we see in the in in the
[32:40] culture that we live in but we must
[32:42] submerse ourselves in the cultures of
[32:45] the word
[32:46] so see everything of this world that man
[32:48] is being pressed Upon Us subconsciously
[32:50] so we must have to allow the word of God
[32:53] to be oppressed into us also
[32:55] subconsciously because it's gonna I
[32:58] don't have to think about sitting in
[32:59] this chair
[33:01] it's just a subconscious reaction I see
[33:03] I see the chair there I sit there and I
[33:05] sit down
[33:06] I don't have to Lord God I don't have to
[33:08] pray to sit down
[33:11] I just do it because I know it's going
[33:14] to be there I have faith that the chair
[33:16] is going to be there brother that's the
[33:18] points we got to get to
[33:20] amen it has to be something down on the
[33:22] inside that when somethings takes place
[33:24] amen and it strikes you that faith kicks
[33:28] in
[33:28] amen not no mental face but that
[33:31] subconscious face kicks in and says
[33:34] everything is going to be all right why
[33:36] because I have a promise and the Bible
[33:38] says so
[33:40] amen and I'm withstanding the effects of
[33:43] this culture amen
[33:45] so we we go on here
[33:49] Amen in the message
[33:51] expectation
[33:54] amen uh let me see here
[33:58] the prophet says uh
[34:01] now we're in the Holy Ghost age
[34:04] now you're sons of God
[34:07] now we're seated together in Heavenly
[34:09] places
[34:11] not we will be
[34:13] we are now this afternoon
[34:16] right here now Sons and Daughters of God
[34:18] seated together
[34:20] in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus
[34:23] see all things are possible
[34:27] when those little shackles and Dark
[34:30] Shadows get broke away then the Holy
[34:32] Spirit can come in
[34:34] and perform miracles
[34:37] amen he goes on to say that we don't
[34:39] have to wait amen until the Millennium
[34:42] we won't need it then
[34:44] amen we need those things now
[34:47] amen we don't need it then in the
[34:49] Millennium now is the time for for us to
[34:53] have a man Express a man who God is now
[34:58] is the time for us to have that Faith
[35:01] Amen to believe all of God's word
[35:04] I tell you what my brothers and sisters
[35:06] we're coming to a time where there's no
[35:08] longer just going to be words on paper
[35:10] there's going to be a real need for it
[35:13] amen they're talking about how now we
[35:16] have covert what's coming next
[35:18] amen they're talking about now in the
[35:21] next on coming years that all kind of
[35:22] things are going to be happening the
[35:24] world is afraid
[35:27] we see what's going on over in China and
[35:30] the different places and people are
[35:32] leaving everywhere our borders are are
[35:35] in a turmoil people trying to get in
[35:39] people are scared they're looking for
[35:41] somewhere to that's going to keep them
[35:43] somewhere that's going to give them some
[35:45] kind of shelter and protection from the
[35:48] oncoming storm
[35:49] because they sense it they sense that
[35:52] this thing is going to collapse this
[35:54] thing is going to fall apart so now what
[35:56] you have you have the Republicans
[35:58] fighting against the Democrats and you
[36:00] have this party fighting against that
[36:02] party that's what fighting against that
[36:04] well why everyone's afraid
[36:09] everyone's afraid
[36:12] because they don't know what's going to
[36:14] happen
[36:16] they don't know what to do
[36:19] amen but see we are
[36:22] something on the inside
[36:24] to able to withstand the effects
[36:28] of this changing culture
[36:31] amen the prophet was talking about how
[36:33] this this time here let me let me read
[36:35] what he said here and the lady you'll
[36:37] see in church age
[36:39] he said yes
[36:41] this boast of tremendous stories now let
[36:44] me read the whole thing here because
[36:45] this was just beautiful he said
[36:48] uh endure let's see here where I want to
[36:50] start at
[36:54] how strange
[36:57] in this age of plenty
[37:00] in this age of progress
[37:03] in this age of abundance
[37:06] How can there be trials
[37:09] the prophet here was talking about the
[37:12] word and this age that there will be
[37:14] wretched
[37:17] amen so he took that word wretchy say
[37:19] the Greek word which means to endure a
[37:23] trial
[37:24] and it has nothing to do with the trials
[37:27] that come come to a true Christian
[37:30] because because the Bible described
[37:33] these trials as blessed and his and
[37:36] isn't then his attitude is one of joy
[37:40] whereas the description in this phrase
[37:43] it is wretched and miserable
[37:49] describing this time that we're living
[37:52] in
[37:53] that these people are wretched and
[37:56] miserable
[37:58] amen
[38:00] and he says this word wretched in the
[38:01] Greek means to endure a trial
[38:05] they have trials coming
[38:08] amen I feel for those people in Buffalo
[38:12] amen who lost their lives just because
[38:14] of this snowstorm
[38:17] government couldn't save them
[38:22] these people they both know ambulance no
[38:25] fire truck nobody could come and dig
[38:27] them out
[38:28] who are you going to turn to
[38:31] I'm glad to know Jesus
[38:34] Church we're going to have to know Jesus
[38:37] in this hour
[38:38] we are living in perilous times
[38:44] all over the world
[38:47] is is corrupt
[38:51] there's no place I don't care everybody
[38:53] running to the United States looking for
[38:56] something
[38:59] little do they know
[39:02] this place told her both right now back
[39:05] in 1955.
[39:07] and it's just as corrupt as where you
[39:09] leaving
[39:13] but people are nervous
[39:15] people are scared
[39:17] amen
[39:19] they have to they're they're they're
[39:20] they're they're they're they're they're
[39:21] enduring this trial
[39:24] he says how strange in this in this age
[39:27] of plenty
[39:28] in this age of progress in this age of
[39:31] abundance
[39:33] How can there be trials
[39:38] he says well now it is strange
[39:43] put this age of plenty
[39:46] and age but this age of Plenty and
[39:50] opportunity
[39:51] when everyone has so much
[39:55] and there is so much more to be had
[39:59] that with all the inventions to do our
[40:03] work
[40:04] and with so many things to give us
[40:07] pleasure
[40:08] suddenly we find mental illness taking
[40:13] such a toll as to alarm the nation
[40:22] hey man we just we just described how
[40:25] that happens
[40:26] one way that happens
[40:29] amen
[40:31] but they don't know this kind of stuff
[40:34] when everybody ought to be happy
[40:38] they really nothing
[40:41] millions are taking sedatives at night
[40:45] pep pills in the morning
[40:47] rushing to the doctor
[40:49] entering institutions
[40:52] to try to drown out unknown fears by
[40:56] alcohol
[41:00] you see
[41:03] yes this age boasts of tremendous stars
[41:07] of worldly Goods
[41:09] but the people are less happy than ever
[41:13] this age boasts of spiritual attainments
[41:17] but the people are less sure of
[41:19] themselves than ever
[41:22] this world boasts of moral values and it
[41:27] is the most corrupt than any age since
[41:30] the flood
[41:32] it talks about its knowledge and science
[41:36] but it is fighting a losing battle in
[41:39] all fields
[41:42] the human mind and soul and spirit
[41:46] cannot comprehend or keep abreast with
[41:50] all the changes that has come upon the
[41:53] Earth in one generation we have gone all
[41:56] the way from a horse and buggy
[41:59] Amen to the Space Age we are proud
[42:03] boastful about it but inside is dark
[42:07] Ford Cavern that is crying out in
[42:11] torment without a known reason men's
[42:15] hearts are failing for fear and the
[42:18] world is so dark that this age could
[42:21] well be called the age of neurotics
[42:24] it boasts but it cannot back it up it
[42:29] cries for peace and there is no peace it
[42:33] cries for a great amplitude of things
[42:35] but it keeps burning with desire like an
[42:40] unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith
[42:44] God to the wicked
[42:48] the only way to have peace my brothers
[42:50] and sisters is have the peace Giver
[42:53] to have that person of peace
[42:56] amen and he'll bring that peace amen
[42:59] which passeth all understanding
[43:02] people just don't understand why aren't
[43:04] you worried about I I have uh
[43:08] people I try to talk to
[43:11] on my job
[43:13] I I get to a point I just can't talk to
[43:15] you
[43:16] because everything is
[43:19] I say y'all think Trump gonna be your
[43:22] savior
[43:24] and let me go on further neither it's
[43:27] Biden
[43:30] this thing is correct this thing is
[43:32] finished
[43:34] America has prophecy laying over her
[43:37] head
[43:39] it is over
[43:41] amen back when they took prayer out of
[43:45] schools
[43:47] man
[43:49] it's finished
[43:51] but you're leaning on you people are
[43:53] nervous and they they're looking for
[43:55] some Superman
[43:58] that's going to right the ship
[44:01] you had your Superman
[44:04] hey man but you we're gonna you're
[44:06] rejecting them
[44:12] amen he goes on to say that they are
[44:15] miserable
[44:18] by this word miserable
[44:20] foreign
[44:22] he says that means an object to be
[44:26] pitied
[44:27] see when you are talking with someone
[44:32] don't get angry and get into a back and
[44:34] forth with them
[44:38] they're miserable
[44:40] I pity you
[44:42] I have compassion pack for you I can't
[44:44] one of the things that the law of
[44:46] dealing with me you know I can't help a
[44:48] person unless I love them
[44:51] it goes on to talk about how can I I
[44:53] can't I can't
[44:55] um have an attitude God came and he died
[45:00] for whosoever will come now by four
[45:02] knowledge he knew who would come he knew
[45:06] who would receive his word but he came
[45:08] and died for whosoever will so if a
[45:11] person out there don't know him I can't
[45:14] be upset or angry with you
[45:16] that I can't I can't approach you with
[45:18] an attitude if I'm better than you I
[45:21] can't win you until I love you
[45:25] I can't preach to you until I love you
[45:31] see that's what the Bible is talking
[45:33] about hearing James he say he must have
[45:35] that same Spirit on the inside of you
[45:37] you must be pressurized
[45:41] you have to have that love for that
[45:42] person if I have that love for you back
[45:44] if I'm not going to argue back and forth
[45:46] with you
[45:47] I'm just gonna wait
[45:49] because obviously you're not ready to
[45:51] receive it if I keep pushing it all it's
[45:53] doing is making you angry
[45:55] so I I'll just wait
[45:57] I'll leave you alone
[45:59] I say God bless you we'll just agree to
[46:01] disagree
[46:02] and talk about something else
[46:04] because I don't want to make you I don't
[46:06] want to get you to a point to where you
[46:08] say something blasphemy against God
[46:12] see God that's not my objective
[46:14] my objectives would be is to be an agent
[46:17] of change in your life
[46:19] but I have to display love for you
[46:23] and just because you don't see it the
[46:25] way you don't see it right away I have
[46:28] to I have to handle you with kick gloves
[46:31] because you you you you're not where I'm
[46:33] at
[46:34] you don't have the strength and you
[46:36] don't have the fortitude this is new to
[46:39] you
[46:40] I understand that so I can't just force
[46:43] it down your throat
[46:45] I can't make you eat something you're
[46:47] unfamiliar with if a person or a baby I
[46:49] can't just uh I don't know
[46:51] [Music]
[46:53] I'm unfamiliar with that taste
[46:56] so they're going to give you rejection
[46:58] at the beginning
[47:00] they're going to give you a little
[47:01] pushback
[47:02] but see what you have to do is you have
[47:04] to let God open the door
[47:07] you have to kind of stay kind of
[47:09] carboniface just close enough to you a
[47:13] man to develop some kind of rapport with
[47:15] you amen and maybe through my life you
[47:18] might ask a question
[47:19] reminded of the Prophet was talking
[47:21] about his old friend now uh The
[47:23] Obedience fellow that uh wanted to kill
[47:26] the the mother though
[47:28] he did not go hunting with him because
[47:30] he was a cruel person
[47:33] you let's go hunting let's go
[47:36] but he knew
[47:38] that something is going to give me
[47:39] opportunity you're going to see
[47:41] something and I want to be there
[47:43] give me that opportunity to lead you to
[47:46] Christ
[47:49] now that's different from having
[47:51] fellowship with sin now you don't have
[47:52] fellowship with sin
[47:55] that's different you get away from that
[47:57] you flee from that
[48:00] especially because sometimes
[48:02] the spirit is greater than your spirit
[48:04] they'll pull you to their side
[48:09] but you would remain prayerful
[48:11] amen you you remember you remain open to
[48:15] the to the move of the god
[48:17] sensitive to his spirit
[48:20] you don't say that back and forth man I
[48:22] never y'all y'all get into this knock
[48:24] down argument now he mad you mad both of
[48:28] y'all in the wrong spirit
[48:30] can't you can't win nobody to guard that
[48:32] way
[48:37] the prophet says
[48:40] they're to be pitied
[48:42] they scorn pity
[48:44] they are full of pride
[48:47] they want what they have
[48:51] but with but what they have will not
[48:54] stand the test of time
[48:57] they have built upon quicksand rather
[49:00] than a rock of Revelation
[49:03] of God's word soon cometh the earthquake
[49:07] soon there will come the storms of the
[49:11] wrath of God in judgment
[49:14] then come sudden destruction
[49:17] and in spite of all their carnal
[49:20] preparation
[49:21] they will be still
[49:24] they will still be unprepared for what
[49:27] comes upon the Earth
[49:29] they have they are those who in spite of
[49:33] all their worldly efforts are actually
[49:36] opposing themselves and don't know it
[49:40] objects of pity

[53:16] amen my brothers and sisters we see that
[53:19] uh uh uh here the prophet was talking
[53:21] about how they that they're not able to
[53:24] uh uh keep up with the changes
[53:28] just he said that they went we went from
[53:31] the horse and buggy
[53:33] to the astronaut age
[53:37] amen the horse and buggy ages started in
[53:41] the late 1800s probably about 18 I
[53:44] believe it was 1887 somewhere along
[53:46] those lines
[53:48] the automobile age started in say 1927
[53:52] 19 something early the Early turn of the
[53:55] century
[53:56] and then from there from that time we
[53:59] went to Automobiles and then spaceship
[54:03] that movement was just so fast
[54:07] and then we look at how during that time
[54:11] different things came along how the
[54:14] fashion changed
[54:17] how just the general attitude of people
[54:20] we came through a different different
[54:23] movements uh we came through segregation
[54:26] and civil rights
[54:29] all of these things look good on paper
[54:31] oh we're getting better
[54:33] oh we're getting better
[54:35] oh we're all together now and oh we're
[54:38] free we're free we're free
[54:40] we free we can go and live in this
[54:43] community now
[54:45] I always said why
[54:47] do I want to live over there in that
[54:49] Community I left a community that was
[54:51] like that couldn't wait to get up out of
[54:53] there because they didn't want me there
[54:57] they did not want me there
[54:59] amen
[55:01] but you know it's it's sometimes we we
[55:05] have to
[55:06] oh my
[55:08] God not always want but the Joneses have
[55:12] called A Jones is a miserable
[55:16] because of that thing
[55:19] Lord I don't want to ask amiss
[55:22] I want to be in your will Lord
[55:26] move me I want to live where you want me
[55:28] to how where can I be most effective
[55:33] not just Satisfy My Flesh
[55:37] Oh see now I'm gonna be under pressure
[55:39] to have uh the high society over
[55:43] and they ain't going to want to you know
[55:45] we'll have their little wine and
[55:48] different things of that nature uh-uh
[55:51] and then in the hood you got to be
[55:53] careful with them too my neighbors know
[55:56] no that ain't what they about why
[55:58] because they see me they see me they see
[56:00] when I'm leaving they see the old that
[56:02] man over there going to church I see
[56:04] them they dressed up when he just got
[56:06] home from work they know when I get home
[56:07] work out the loudest truck in the
[56:09] neighborhood
[56:10] they know when I get home from work and
[56:12] they look outside they say man you but
[56:14] you got a phone booth in there then came
[56:16] my child up cleaned up dressed up suited
[56:18] up and I'm gone
[56:19] and he's still walking the dog
[56:22] foreign
[56:24] you just got home and I'm just leaving
[56:28] see
[56:30] we invited them over you know they had
[56:31] they had their little things over there
[56:33] and different things they play their
[56:34] music and different things like that
[56:35] invited them over the church gonna be
[56:37] over you're welcome to come no no no no
[56:39] no no
[56:40] y'all don't
[56:41] party like we party
[56:45] that's all right but we still be nice to
[56:47] you we talked to them
[56:49] we went to all our neighbors around us
[56:50] and gave our Christmas card
[56:54] Day by Christmas God bless you
[56:58] just stay close enough and one day you
[57:01] get thirsty
[57:03] you get thirsty I can lead you to a
[57:06] whale that you're never thirst again
[57:10] sit down and have a conversation with
[57:12] you invite you to church show you
[57:14] something different
[57:16] show you a culture that's going to
[57:18] pressurize you for the upcoming storm
[57:22] amen
[57:24] we have to be able to withstand the
[57:27] effects of this changing culture
[57:31] amen we see that a lot of things are
[57:33] coming in now
[57:35] we're in another uh uh uh age of
[57:38] information
[57:42] killing folks
[57:44] information
[57:46] why because people can't decipher good
[57:48] and bad information
[57:51] you have to take that thing through the
[57:53] filter
[57:55] of the word
[57:57] and if you don't if you don't take that
[57:59] information I I we get we all bombarded
[58:02] we see all bombarded with information
[58:03] and and we got this thing now Facebook
[58:06] Tick Tock in so many different different
[58:09] things like that and not just
[58:10] information information
[58:12] voices voices voices voices voices
[58:15] voices voices
[58:18] till it's hard to hear the voice of Lord
[58:20] hard to
[58:22] delineate what's true and what's not
[58:25] true
[58:26] until I feel for our young people
[58:28] because they're the ones being sucked
[58:30] into this most
[58:32] why because it is a part of their early
[58:35] culture
[58:37] it's a part of their early culture
[58:40] you know when I was coming up we didn't
[58:42] have things like this so I believe my
[58:44] pastor
[58:48] now they go back and fact check the
[58:50] pastor
[58:51] and don't and don't know how to do it
[58:55] and try to come tell him he wrong
[59:00] think they smarter
[59:03] ain't been through nothing
[59:05] see everything don't come through
[59:07] knowledge some things come by experience
[59:13] sometimes you learn things by experience
[59:16] say oh now I see what James was talking
[59:19] about
[59:21] because see I don't been through
[59:22] something
[59:24] see now and I could take I could take
[59:26] the scriptures and now they connect and
[59:28] it becomes real to me because I've been
[59:30] through it
[59:33] it's real ain't been through nothing but
[59:36] they can fact check the pastor
[59:37] everybody has a place see in this
[59:40] culture
[59:42] there is an order
[59:45] there is an order
[59:46] see there is an order in the worldly
[59:48] culture
[59:50] there is an order to it
[59:52] and if that order gets out of place you
[59:55] have chaos that's why we have it now
[59:57] people that you have the president and
[59:59] you have this uh uh uh Senate House of
[1:00:03] Representatives and all of that stuff
[1:00:04] now I'm not no sociology or whatever you
[1:00:07] call it Majors but there's an order to
[1:00:09] it
[1:00:10] and we see what this Society is all out
[1:00:13] of whack you know why because they don't
[1:00:16] have respect
[1:00:19] for the leader
[1:00:21] even if you don't agree with him respect
[1:00:24] the office
[1:00:27] and they finna have a civil war around
[1:00:30] here
[1:00:31] tout everything
[1:00:36] tell the whole thing eyebrow they
[1:00:38] talking about this democracy Burn It
[1:00:40] Down
[1:00:41] I had a man talked to me one time I was
[1:00:43] in the store he said it's gonna take
[1:00:45] bloodshed
[1:00:47] y'all said y'all blood item right I
[1:00:48] already had somebody shed his blood for
[1:00:50] me I'm good
[1:00:51] I ain't got ain't yeah I ain't got
[1:00:53] the shed no blood
[1:00:55] y'all go all the blood y'all want
[1:00:58] man let me go to church he folk crazy
[1:01:02] and stay close to Jesus they're thinking
[1:01:05] to come loose at the city boys gonna
[1:01:08] take Bloodshed they they mounting up
[1:01:12] yeah but you know them little bullets
[1:01:13] and guns y'all have ain't gonna do you
[1:01:15] no good when that atomic bomb hit this
[1:01:17] place
[1:01:19] you gonna be running around here trying
[1:01:21] to find somewhere to hide ain't gonna be
[1:01:23] nowhere to hide
[1:01:24] I'm talking real to you now he's coming
[1:01:29] it's coming
[1:01:32] why
[1:01:33] we have to withstand the effects
[1:01:37] of this culture because see we have to
[1:01:40] have the culture on the inside
[1:01:42] see the Bible declares that the kingdom
[1:01:44] of God is within us
[1:01:47] and have to have that culture we don't
[1:01:50] take on the culture of this world
[1:01:54] but we be transformed
[1:01:57] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[1:01:59] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:02:03] amen
[1:02:06] this is not the culture this culture is
[1:02:09] going to fade away let me read one thing
[1:02:11] in closing
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:32] here let me read this I think I missed
[1:02:34] it here he says now once this isn't a
[1:02:37] message Fellowship by Redemption
[1:02:41] now man once was made
[1:02:44] Even in our polluted condition
[1:02:47] that we are today man was made to serve
[1:02:50] God
[1:02:52] that his that was his full Duty
[1:02:56] here the great wise man Solomon and all
[1:03:00] the rest of them speaking in
[1:03:02] Ecclesiastes he said let's hear the
[1:03:05] conclusion of the matter
[1:03:07] fear and keep his Commandments for this
[1:03:10] is the full duty of man
[1:03:12] that's the full duty of man we wonder
[1:03:15] why we're uh running along here men
[1:03:19] women why we wear clothes and have to
[1:03:22] strive and the animals don't
[1:03:25] God feeds his little old birds and take
[1:03:27] care of everything else but we have to
[1:03:30] shift for ourselves
[1:03:33] it's because sin separated us from our
[1:03:37] maker
[1:03:38] that's what did it now man has been
[1:03:42] moving along
[1:03:44] you don't see the animals in bettering
[1:03:47] himself
[1:03:49] he can't embedded himself
[1:03:52] if he's any better treatment it's got to
[1:03:57] come from some other source
[1:04:00] he's he doesn't build himself a better
[1:04:03] house
[1:04:04] he doesn't make himself fry his meat
[1:04:08] where he used to eat it raw
[1:04:12] it has to be done because
[1:04:15] it has to be done because he there's
[1:04:18] nothing in him to give him a soul
[1:04:22] a animal doesn't have a soul but man has
[1:04:25] a soul
[1:04:26] and therefore the soul is part of God
[1:04:28] and even in its Fallen state yet it's
[1:04:32] the most greatest species of all species
[1:04:35] on the earth is the man
[1:04:37] and then get him connected back with his
[1:04:41] maker
[1:04:42] he becomes a Superman almost because
[1:04:46] he's the son of God he becomes
[1:04:49] acquainted with his maker the creator of
[1:04:53] all things and then when this man there
[1:04:56] acquainted with his maker becomes a part
[1:04:58] of his maker he becomes back into
[1:05:02] fellowship with his maker every Divine
[1:05:05] word becomes a living reality to him and
[1:05:09] he believes amen may the Lord add a
[1:05:12] blessing Amen to this word I hope amen
[1:05:15] that uh something was said
[1:05:18] Amen to strike your heart amen uh
[1:05:22] remember
[1:05:24] um that we have to
[1:05:26] be able to withstand the effects
[1:05:30] of this changing culture
[1:05:32] amen things are changing fast and we're
[1:05:34] here amen and there's pressure
[1:05:38] amen there's peer pressure even adults
[1:05:42] are under pressure a man to assimilate
[1:05:45] amen with the things around them but we
[1:05:48] must withstand those effects
[1:05:52] of this culture of this changing culture
[1:05:55] because see from the beginning these
[1:05:57] things wasn't to be so
[1:05:59] from the beginning it wasn't like that
[1:06:01] but see the devil has got in and and
[1:06:04] changed our fashion
[1:06:06] changed our way of dress changed our
[1:06:09] attitudes changed so much and things
[1:06:12] like that and subconsciously because
[1:06:14] we're under that pressure we gain to
[1:06:17] take on some of that the only way not to
[1:06:19] take on that is to have a greater
[1:06:21] pressure on the inside
[1:06:23] so that thing can't seep in amen let us
[1:06:25] down to our feet

[1:07:11] going to be changes that we don't see
[1:07:13] now and there's going to be changes Lord
[1:07:15] but we can't let those things affect us
[1:07:18] Lord God we can't let fear set in our
[1:07:20] heart because things are changing Lord
[1:07:21] God Lord God we realize that sometimes
[1:07:24] uh me as one Lord God that sometimes
