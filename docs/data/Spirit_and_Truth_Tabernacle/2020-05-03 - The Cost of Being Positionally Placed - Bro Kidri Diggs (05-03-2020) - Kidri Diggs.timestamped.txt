[6:05] life-sustaining
[6:06] Amen he's our God amen
[6:10] our psalms reads the Lord reigneth let
[6:14] the people tremble he sitteth between
[6:17] the cherubims let the earth be moved the
[6:20] Lord is great in Zion and he is high
[6:22] above all the people let them praise thy
[6:25] great and terrible name for it is holy
[6:27] the Kings strength also loveth judgment
[6:31] thou thus established equity they our
[6:34] executors judgment and righteousness and
[6:36] Jacob exactly the Lord our God and
[6:39] worship at his footstool for he is holy
[6:42] Moses and Aaron among his priests and
[6:45] Samuel mueng them they call upon his
[6:47] name they called upon the Lord and he
[6:50] answered them he's speaking to them in
[6:52] the cloudy pillar they kept his his
[6:55] testimony and the ordinance that he gave
[6:58] them
[6:59] now answers them Oh Lord our God that
[7:02] was a god that forgave us them though
[7:05] thou took his vengeance on their
[7:07] inventions exalt the Lord our God and
[7:10] worship at his holy hill for the Lord
[7:12] our God is holy praise the Lord praise
[7:16] the Lord Amen you all may be seated
[7:18] we're gonna ask brother Josue to come
[7:21] and give a little testimony this morning
[7:24] about the goodness of the Lord praise
[7:28] the Lord
[7:31] [Music]
[7:47] god bless you all this morning I love I
[7:53] love testifying of the goodness of Jesus
[7:57] and and for some reason he provides I
[8:03] said he provides situations for me to
[8:08] testify like the brother said not too
[8:10] long ago he said every test and trial
[8:13] that we put through we look at it as a
[8:15] potential testimony and and that's what
[8:18] has happened to me he keeps on providing
[8:25] things to confirm the confidence that
[8:29] God could have in me and every single
[8:33] one of those things just just brings me
[8:35] closer to God you know I I want to I
[8:40] can't even think about the things that I
[8:44] lost but I could only think about the
[8:46] things that I've gained through this
[8:49] there's so much to say about the
[8:52] accident because I don't have no memory
[8:56] of it I guess from the hit it completely
[9:02] blanked out but I don't have no memory
[9:05] of the accident but I know who was there
[9:09] to protect me he gave me an opportunity
[9:12] to he first of all he spared my life
[9:16] because like I told some other other
[9:18] brothers if you look at the vehicle it
[9:21] looks like somebody died but if you look
[9:24] at the promises of God somebody's alive
[9:27] okay and he spared my life
[9:32] he has gave me an opportunity to be
[9:36] alive to live and keep on serving him
[9:40] which is what I'm going to do and if
[9:43] anything this has strengthened my walk
[9:47] with God because he has proven himself
[9:50] to me over and over and in the Bible he
[9:54] said that he would not leave us nor
[9:57] forsake us
[9:58] I have
[10:00] had the opportunity to share this
[10:02] testimony this testimony is in Puerto
[10:05] Rico it's in Mexico is in Honduras is in
[10:09] Colombia is in it's an United State the
[10:12] whole day if I would have been home I
[10:14] would have probably been busy with the
[10:17] kids doing things but I was in the
[10:18] hospital and I was able to share this
[10:21] testimony to every single person that
[10:23] came into my heart I shared the
[10:25] testimony because the Bible says to do
[10:28] good and to communicate forget na which
[10:31] Indo in those things God is well pleased
[10:34] so he gives us a certain situations and
[10:38] I believe that he does that so we can
[10:41] give him all the glory and show the one
[10:44] thing that I want to say is one of the
[10:46] brothers that I thought in my heart to
[10:50] share with what I am I said I'm gonna
[10:53] call brother Remy I don't know why I I
[10:55] said I'm gonna call brother Remy and I'm
[10:57] gonna share my testimony with him cuz
[10:59] maybe he'll share with somebody else so
[11:01] so there was so many other people that I
[11:03] was sharing with that I thought about
[11:05] him I just want to show you how God
[11:07] cares and I've give many hope
[11:10] testimonies the guys proved to me that
[11:12] he cares for you and I thought about
[11:15] brother Remy and there was so many so
[11:17] many so many people that I shared his
[11:20] testimony with that I completely didn't
[11:23] get to share with him now about 6 or 7
[11:27] o'clock I get a phone call and it says
[11:30] brother Remy and when I saw that I was
[11:33] like what's brother ramiz calling me
[11:37] brother Remy called me and I never knew
[11:40] that brother Remy was brother Mike's
[11:44] uncle I never knew that and I am very
[11:48] close with brother Mike and actually the
[11:50] day before my accident I took brother
[11:53] Mike with me we were do we spend the
[11:55] whole day together he went to Shu with
[11:57] me and the things that was spoken and
[11:59] the things to happen and the testimony
[12:01] that I can give you of what happened
[12:03] that day the devil was not happy okay he
[12:07] was sitting there and he shared a
[12:09] testimony and brother Remy call me and
[12:11] he called me I said what
[12:13] I forgot to call him but God knew that
[12:15] in my heart I wanted to share the
[12:17] testimony with him so he cares and he
[12:20] show so many so many things before I
[12:23] always go to work with my trailer and
[12:26] God that morning a furrier friend of
[12:31] mine asked me if I can help him
[12:34] because he has so much where he couldn't
[12:35] work the day before because it was
[12:36] raining and I said you know what I just
[12:38] dropped my stuff man I'm kind of come
[12:41] and help you and when I was gonna leave
[12:42] the house I was like you know what I'm
[12:43] just gonna leave my trailer you know cuz
[12:45] God made me do that because he knew that
[12:48] tomorrow I'll go get another truck like
[12:50] my wife told me she said maybe I'm not
[12:51] worrying about that truck there's
[12:53] there's a million f-150s but there's
[12:55] only one horse way so God allowed me to
[12:59] drop my trailer off at the house so
[13:02] whenever this accident happened I can
[13:04] have a testimony and I can still go on
[13:07] with the things that he has built for me
[13:09] to keep on moving I just want to
[13:10] encourage you guys that the Lord is with
[13:12] us there is nothing that we can do but
[13:15] is what God did for us okay so I'm just
[13:21] so happy and so excited and I called the
[13:25] brothers yesterday and I sang a song for
[13:27] them because that I was singing that
[13:29] song in the hospital and the people must
[13:31] have thought that I was crazy but there
[13:33] was just just so you know how what God
[13:35] does there was a lady that came into the
[13:40] Moroz and when she came in she had the
[13:42] scrub and she looked like a sister you
[13:44] know so I was like she must be a sister
[13:47] because they you know it's probably a
[13:49] little uncomfortable to to wear scrub
[13:52] with a skirt probably for for them not
[13:54] for us because I'm uncomfortable with
[13:57] the way I live cuz when God took my
[13:59] stony heart out and he gave me a new
[14:01] heart and he pour his spirit into me
[14:03] what moves me something different so
[14:06] what I'm living I'm super exciting I
[14:08] delight in the ways of the Lord like
[14:10] David said okay so she came in and she
[14:12] said how are you doing I say I am
[14:14] rejoicing in the Lord I am I'm blessed
[14:18] the God spared my life and I am so I
[14:21] just kept talking and she just in the
[14:23] hospital all right so she just stayed
[14:27] and I didn't see her I didn't tell her
[14:29] oh you believe her you know you you I
[14:31] see I didn't tell her that I started
[14:35] talking to her brother and she went from
[14:37] taking my vitals from me to getting up
[14:39] and I started sharing some some things
[14:41] and I don't know what I was saying I
[14:43] don't know what I was talking about I
[14:44] know I got to but she told me she was a
[14:46] Pentecostal right and when I when I
[14:50] started talking to her and I don't know
[14:52] how I got to the to the to the baptism
[14:55] part and I started sharing with her and
[14:58] I told her that this is what Jesus said
[15:02] but this is not what John did okay he
[15:07] Peter I'm sorry
[15:08] this is not what Peter did it wasn't the
[15:11] Bible the the Bible says that the it's
[15:15] really jesus said that he speak spoke in
[15:18] parables okay and the Bible has not
[15:21] understood exactly by what you see but
[15:23] it's understood by revelation so Peter
[15:25] caught the revelation that God said then
[15:27] he said he baptized in the name of the
[15:29] Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
[15:31] but Peter baptize them in the name of
[15:33] the Lord Jesus Christ I told her if you
[15:35] go to take my MRI that they want to do
[15:37] and you go over there he said this MRI
[15:39] is for the father and it's for the son
[15:42] and for the cousin are they gonna give
[15:44] me an MRI they're not this is just what
[15:47] came into my mind and I'm saying I'm
[15:48] saying all these things and I'm like I
[15:50] know where I'm getting this from and
[15:53] when I told my wife that I was talking
[15:55] to her about that she's like really
[15:56] talking about the she don't know this I
[15:59] said I said relax baby
[16:01] I say you got prophetic lens there's
[16:05] something that you know that a lot of
[16:08] people don't know maybe his/her pastor
[16:11] don't know these things
[16:12] and I said you can don't take those
[16:14] things lightly the things that we know
[16:17] are revelations that are for the bride
[16:20] of distress so I started talking to her
[16:22] and telling her and and I showed her and
[16:26] she just stood there she was like I've
[16:28] never heard anything like I said well
[16:32] can we can I show you in the Bible real
[16:34] quick where I got this from because this
[16:36] is not something that I came up with I'm
[16:39] just I'm just repeating
[16:41] what it's in the Bible and I'm showing
[16:42] you there read them for yourself if God
[16:45] speaks to you then take it as that this
[16:47] is not something that came brother
[16:49] branham said that I was listening to
[16:50] message he said he said don't get mad at
[16:53] me about what I'm saying he said what
[16:56] I'm saying I'm not saying anything of
[16:57] from my thoughts I am just repeating
[16:59] what the Bible says if you have a
[17:01] problem go talk to the author okay so I
[17:04] just wanted to share these things
[17:06] because I am so excited and so joyful
[17:10] and so grateful that God allowed me to
[17:13] get into that wreck so making sure I
[17:16] didn't have my seatbelt on I just found
[17:21] out because I have a camera inside of my
[17:22] vehicle and for some reason God did not
[17:26] allow the whole accident to record but
[17:28] he record about about thirty seconds
[17:32] before the accident was recorded and I
[17:35] was just driving and I did not have my
[17:36] see because I a farm you know so that is
[17:41] even greater a greater miracle okay so I
[17:45] just want to tell you that when I think
[17:48] of the goodness of Jesus for me my heart
[18:03] cries out hallelujah
[18:08] and thank God for saving me

[27:31] that's perfectly fine but that's the way
[27:33] you would give to here today you just

[28:38] Savior and God we have seen you do that
[28:41] where Satan might have come in and one
[28:43] way we saw him go out another way

[30:06] things that has happened that I want to
[30:08] thank God before it even before y'all
[30:09] notice it one of the things that we
[30:11] noticed the computer that we were trying
[30:13] to push all these streaming services
[30:15] through it just told us we ain't got
[30:17] enough resources I can't do nothing with
[30:19] all this so we got together and
[30:22] and said we got to get a compute and we
[30:24] got to get it now you know for the
[30:25] church and so the brothers looked into
[30:28] some things and you know and and
[30:30] unbeknownst to me decided that they were
[30:33] going to pool their money together and
[30:35] buy the computer for the church you know
[30:38] to get through some of these hurdles so
[30:39] I want to appreciate a man brother
[30:41] brother Quentin brother Jerry and by
[30:43] December 4 just coming up with that
[30:45] solution and hey man and just bless the

[33:41] something that that I had in my heart
[33:44] and I think we my daughter and I
[33:47] practiced this some time ago but just
[33:50] the situation every presented itself for
[33:52] for me to do it and but this morning I
[33:55] say I'll do a special if we don't have
[33:57] anybody else I mention that to brother
[33:58] solomon let's say just put me on the
[34:00] list so I'm gonna do a special a man

[34:28] want to just encourage you this is a
[34:30] very challenging time a man for many but
[34:37] as God's people we're seeing him move in
[34:40] ways that just go beyond our

[34:45] mention brother Jimmy has a request for
[34:49] prayer there was a his and his family
[34:54] there was a relative that announced that
[34:57] she had cancer stage 4 cancer and and
[35:01] when she announced it one of her

[35:06] one of her son's I think it's a youngest
[35:08] son and he didn't take it very well
[35:10] Denis went and I believe he he killed
[35:13] himself
[35:14] so we want to pray for this family that
[35:17] God would just give them strength for me
[35:19] and a mother that's already suffering
[35:21] and her body and now she has to deal
[35:22] with you know losing our baby

[50:18] ready
[50:18] [Laughter]
[50:23] God you know Genesis 17 let's just
[50:27] reverse one the Bible says and when
[50:30] Abraham was ninety ninety years old and
[50:35] nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[50:38] unto him I am the Almighty God walk
[50:42] before me and be thou perfect and I will
[50:47] make my covenant between me and thee and
[50:49] I will multiply thee exceedingly and
[50:52] Abraham fell on his face
[50:54] and God talk with him a man saying for
[50:58] saying as for me behold my covenant with
[51:02] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[51:05] nations they made us go to ax the knife
[51:08] chapter X chapter 9
[51:27] let's just pick up in verse 13 then
[51:35] Ananias answered lord I have heard by
[51:39] many of this man now how much evil he
[51:43] have done to the Saints at Jerusalem and
[51:47] here he had authority from the chief
[51:50] priests to bind all that call on that
[51:54] name but the Lord said unto him go thy
[51:57] way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to
[52:02] bear my name before the Gentiles and
[52:04] kings and the children of Israel for I
[52:08] will show him I will show him how great
[52:12] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[52:15] amen
[52:16] what one more verse of scripture Romans
[52:20] the ninth chapter Romans nine
[52:37] it's reverse I 11 Roma's 9/11 the Bible
[52:43] says for the children being not yet born
[52:45] neither having done any good or evil
[52:48] that the purpose of God according to
[52:50] election might stand not of works but of
[52:54] him that calleth they made a lot of
[52:57] bless reading of his word you can have
[52:59] your seats amen
[53:02] you know by the grace of God today I
[53:05] wanna useful subject but before I give
[53:09] my subject I kind of want to divert our
[53:13] attention I want to divert the way we've
[53:16] been thinking you know this this is cool
[53:21] in nineteen you know we've been giving
[53:23] so much attention to this I think we
[53:26] forget sometimes we serve a mighty God
[53:29] you know it's oh I got this symptom I
[53:33] got that symptom what what's to do
[53:36] between those previous symptoms then the
[53:38] symptoms now to go let's refocus he made
[53:53] this what's going on a man I think God
[53:56] is trying to let us see that he's still
[54:00] God I believe God is calling those back
[54:03] who may have gone way side so I want to
[54:06] say to you where this restrictions lift
[54:08] up don't be late to church you might not
[54:11] have a spot hallelujah you know and for
[54:15] those of you may have come back in your
[54:18] streaming service don't be like the
[54:20] people of 9/11 you know once everything
[54:23] was over people went back to their same
[54:25] old life no God has allowed this for a
[54:28] reason
[54:33] [Applause]
[54:51] [Music]
[55:13] let's get into my top of the day a man
[55:19] the cost of being positionally placed
[55:24] the cost of being placed we look and we
[55:29] see what's going on with this with this
[55:32] virus and all the stuff and you know and
[55:35] there is a cost there is a call you know
[55:39] some people have lost their lives and
[55:42] you know and loved ones have gotten you
[55:45] know are seeking all these things but
[55:48] what's behind it
[55:49] what could God be doing huh oh yeah you
[55:53] know I'm gonna lose people and we're
[55:55] probably deal with this the next service
[55:56] but I'm one of those people who are not
[55:59] gonna give the devil any credit oh yeah
[56:03] you know if I can
[56:05] Church that there is a cause for you and
[56:09] I to be made perfect and that's what God
[56:13] is doing
[57:01] [Applause]
[57:14] working for you justify the accident
[57:29] sometimes we missed that because we're
[57:32] channeling in on the hurt on the pain
[57:35] and all these things but the cost is
[57:38] what's making us better God didn't tell
[57:42] Abraham yeah you're gonna be the father
[57:45] face huh but he didn't tell him
[57:48] hallelujah
[57:49] your wife is going to be burned for 25
[57:51] years God didn't tell God didn't tell
[57:57] Sarah that you're gonna feel so bad
[58:00] you're gonna give your husband
[58:11] [Music]
[58:14] he perfected it solo
[58:18] she was gonna give her husband away but
[58:22] that was the cost of being positionally
[58:25] place that was the cost of becoming
[58:30] perfect hold my church
[58:34] look can you imagine how she felt
[58:37] read your Bible how she felt when she
[58:39] heard she said well God I know you said
[58:42] we would have a child she said well I'm
[58:44] barren she's going through all this in
[58:46] her mind she's going through loosing and
[58:52] she's thinking about the cost of how I'm
[58:55] going to fulfill God's Word but it ain't
[58:57] up to us but he still the father you
[59:40] know Church looking I want to read you
[59:44] something real quick I'm gonna try to go
[59:46] quick

[1:14:28] your eyes that's your window devil stop
[1:14:33] talking crazy - bachelor
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:46] we serve Almighty God but there is a
[1:14:50] cost to being positionally placed you
[1:14:56] know if I can like I say gonna be too
[1:14:58] much longer but Church when we look at
[1:15:01] what goes on in life sometimes we look
[1:15:03] at it like lord why me cuz you you're
[1:15:07] called to be perfect like I said about
[1:15:10] Abraham he didn't know hallelujah
[1:15:13] then he was gonna get to a place oh yeah
[1:15:15] Heatley see see see a lot of times the
[1:15:18] trial is a blessing because there things
[1:15:21] in you that you don't know they cause
[1:15:42] perfection
[1:15:51] so God let him go through something that
[1:15:54] he could feel something and that very
[1:16:00] thing was going to perfect him let me
[1:16:09] say like just when his life was on the
[1:16:11] line
[1:16:13] never again remember he had to go get a
[1:16:18] lot with 360 late-teen service they had
[1:16:22] no rifles no guns no Spears they
[1:16:24] probably had some shovels and some ranks
[1:16:25] you know some things like that but he
[1:16:27] went to fight hallelujah he went to
[1:16:30] fight he stood up he fought hallelujah
[1:16:33] he depended on his god that wasn't the
[1:16:35] same Abraham before saying Abraham
[1:16:37] wasn't willing to fight he won willing
[1:16:40] hallelujah to be persistently placed
[1:16:44] because of the costs but once God came
[1:16:47] on the scene even in church this is even
[1:16:50] when you lie that don't stop the promise
[1:16:52] of God the promise of God's Word because
[1:17:07] if I can stop God's Word you can stop
[1:17:10] you even when the serpent lied to Eve
[1:17:15] God still came and made a way of
[1:17:17] redemption so he allows things so we can
[1:17:24] see the cost oh yeah and then things
[1:17:27] that come out of you
[1:17:28] that's landing in your Christian journey
[1:17:32] Abraham was the father face and father
[1:17:35] faith in you my sister God had to go
[1:17:41] ahead and get that line out of him so
[1:17:43] you go to the next level
[1:17:44] Oh coz from there you never lied again
[1:17:48] oh yeah but you know that spirit was in
[1:17:52] a seat that spirit was in his lineage
[1:17:55] hallelujah so he he let his son go
[1:17:58] through the same thing what did he do he
[1:18:02] what was it they were afraid of the cost
[1:18:05] but they were being positionally placed
[1:18:10] if you get all the way down just for a
[1:18:15] moment holy mmm sometimes we don't
[1:18:17] realize what we have to go through to
[1:18:20] get to where God want us and let me say
[1:18:24] I just stopped looking at what you going
[1:18:26] through and something bad no Abraham was
[1:18:35] being perfected I think was being
[1:18:38] perfected now let's talk about Jacob God
[1:18:46] told Abraham that your seed is gonna be
[1:18:49] like the Stars oh yeah that there are
[1:18:52] gonna be nations
[1:18:53] you hallelujah Amen you know Jacob was a
[1:18:56] part of that promise but Jacob didn't
[1:18:58] realize the cost of fulfilling his
[1:19:01] father's promise you just you just have
[1:19:07] some urges you didn't know what it will
[1:19:09] come in from for the birthright was
[1:19:15] coming from but there was gonna be a
[1:19:17] cost nobody smiles
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:34] can you imagine hallelujah once a man
[1:19:38] wants Isaac found out earlier that his
[1:19:41] wife lied to him
[1:19:42] do you think they just sit there said
[1:19:44] what praise God we know the Lord is in
[1:19:45] control this man was a prophet he was
[1:19:52] the seen by his wife and his son so bad
[1:19:57] look at the cost
[1:20:03] Jacob mama helped him to save his
[1:20:07] brother in his daddy but there was a
[1:20:10] cost Holy Church
[1:20:13] most of us amen most of us got siblings
[1:20:18] you know I know y'all probably had a
[1:20:20] good time
[1:20:21] going out there fishing and doing
[1:20:22] everything you know
[1:20:24] brother roles are failing your mom you
[1:20:26] know just having a good time brother
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:30] just having a good time Jacob didn't
[1:20:32] have that the cost of him being
[1:20:36] possessed the place made him lose the
[1:20:38] relationship with his brother made him
[1:20:44] lose the relationship with his father
[1:20:47] because his brother wanted to kill him
[1:20:49] so now he had to run Church they
[1:20:52] couldn't go he couldn't he couldn't be
[1:20:54] like us go in the backyard and throw the
[1:20:56] football with his brother huh the cost
[1:20:58] of him being position
[1:21:01] with him his relationship with his
[1:21:04] brother the cost of him because this is
[1:21:08] a place that was the cost but didn't
[1:21:19] stop there now he gets down the Lehman's
[1:21:21] house hallelujah Amen he see Rachel he's
[1:21:25] like oh my he goes the laymen said what
[1:21:29] I gotta do to have her what's the cost
[1:21:32] he's a seven years give me seven years
[1:21:35] that's the cost if you give me seven
[1:21:38] years notice you didn't say you can't
[1:21:40] have her that means she was already here
[1:21:43] but he had to work for so he worked
[1:21:45] seven years hard labor seven years only
[1:21:49] to get behind the veil and realize he
[1:21:50] will hear the cost a big position a
[1:21:54] place was thick of getting a woman that
[1:21:56] he didn't love but that was the cost of
[1:22:11] being position the place hallelujah so
[1:22:14] now he got two eyes more he loved him
[1:22:16] one he don't oh yeah but then look at
[1:22:19] the cost of God bringing out that nation
[1:22:23] now he has the wife who children of the
[1:22:36] nation Rachel wasn't but it was gone oh
[1:22:50] yeah bringing for perfection it was God
[1:22:53] keeping his promise oh yeah and you
[1:22:55] don't look at Rachel now Rachel's so
[1:22:57] upset honey that leader bring
[1:23:00] of kids she gives her husband hands me
[1:23:03] can you imagine how she felt
[1:23:05] I can't have no kids so I'm gonna give
[1:23:08] my wife my husband to my hands means
[1:23:35] coming forward think about it she didn't
[1:23:39] wanna give it up watch it watch it was
[1:23:41] hey guys head baby
[1:23:42] she like you gotta leave him I know I
[1:23:45] agreed to it but I changed my mind
[1:23:48] you got to go now can you imagine babies
[1:23:53] Rachel right there barren huh and she
[1:23:55] gives the hands me but what was it it
[1:24:03] was God positionally placing this word
[1:24:06] so she she God knew that there was a
[1:24:09] Levi God knew that there was a Simeon
[1:24:12] God there were different ones that were
[1:24:16] not in Rachel Rachel hallelujah kiss her
[1:24:27] hand me so let's say you wanna play like
[1:24:29] that
[1:24:29] I'll give her mine you got babies coming
[1:24:33] from everywhere but Rachel now look at
[1:24:36] the cross you got four women look like
[1:24:39] it's fighting over one man but no is God
[1:24:42] bringing forth his promise
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:50] now examine some of this about what
[1:24:53] you're going so can you see God keeping
[1:24:56] his promise yeah amen because the only
[1:25:05] two in that nation that were in Rachel
[1:25:07] were Benjamin and Joseph everybody else
[1:25:11] came from holy women then Jacob didn't
[1:25:14] love but you look at a church is like he
[1:25:22] he's got four women fighting over him
[1:25:24] but what is it hallelujah
[1:25:26] it's God positionally placing his word
[1:25:30] because he told Abraham you'll see gonna
[1:25:33] be like stars and you gonna look in the
[1:25:36] scripture where it talks about 144,000
[1:25:39] when they come from
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:18] Church it was all holy God positions
[1:26:22] replacing Jacob Harley yeah it's a place
[1:26:25] where you have all the kids night down
[1:26:27] in lame his house and not here to start
[1:26:29] who years to start their coming-out
[1:26:31] didn't start chicken leaving and doing
[1:26:34] all kind of stuff getting speckled
[1:26:35] cattle and all those to name it got man
[1:26:38] leave me got mad and she could feel his
[1:26:42] anger what was it that was the cost of
[1:26:45] being positioning place now Jacob Holly
[1:26:49] the place he went to feel safe
[1:26:51] now you gotta run back honey but on his
[1:26:54] way back you realize Esau is coming so
[1:26:57] now he gotta fight this way you gotta
[1:26:59] fight that way so what did the calls
[1:27:02] cause him to do fall on his knees the
[1:27:06] cost of all the things he went through
[1:27:09] caused him to have a Pannell with God
[1:27:14] patel means you make God face to face so
[1:27:18] all of his troubles brought him to a
[1:27:20] place to weigh so God face to face with
[1:27:25] God
[1:27:30] Oh trouble cause wrestle with God what
[1:27:37] about you what is your trouble causing
[1:27:40] in your life my god problem you think
[1:27:49] the devil is causing it
[1:27:52] remember God said Pharaoh I'm gonna get
[1:27:55] glorified God hardened his heart let's
[1:28:01] look at Moses a little bit I'm gonna be
[1:28:02] too much loan y'all normal bicycles
[1:28:06] well let's look at the cost Oh Josephine
[1:28:11] her husband they have a beautiful
[1:28:13] handsome little boy they named him Moses
[1:28:15] and his birth you see there's something
[1:28:19] special about him but the Greek comes
[1:28:22] out in the land and I think I promised a
[1:28:26] around two years old I know honey
[1:28:28] a degree when I kill all the meals now
[1:28:31] this woman honey you didn't see
[1:28:33] something special about her son
[1:28:35] but the cost she's got to give him up to
[1:28:41] kill him see she's flashing back she's
[1:28:53] being inspired by deliverance before huh
[1:28:57] remember delivers before people escape
[1:29:01] nor his family any arc so when you going
[1:29:05] through things you ought to be inspired
[1:29:08] by what was already we were just talking
[1:29:18] about some of us a couple weeks ago we
[1:29:20] were supposed to be in London hardly but
[1:29:22] some of y'all might not know one time
[1:29:24] they were on their way to London and
[1:29:26] Keenan Jack grounded a plane by the
[1:29:28] spoken word

[1:31:45] remember the woman in Memphis Tennessee
[1:31:54] we're not following a man we're
[1:31:57] following the voice of God Church and he
[1:32:02] says remember the woman in Memphis

[1:32:10] plane is feeling back up all these
[1:32:12] things it's all jacking and Erica head

[1:34:59] then nobody asked but there's a cost for
[1:35:06] us to become perfect you got to go
[1:35:10] through things but what you think about
[1:35:12] this now huh how do you get perfect
[1:35:16] trial and error the Bible says and Jesus
[1:35:19] was made perfect by the things he
[1:35:22] suffered the Lord the Lord Jesus was
[1:35:28] made perfect by the cost by the things
[1:35:33] he suffered oh yeah and we think we just
[1:35:36] gonna skip down the yellow brick road
[1:35:41] I'm right I'm in the message and don't
[1:35:44] have no trial the trial is was
[1:35:47] perfecting you oh yeah
[1:35:51] the trial is was making you who you are
[1:35:55] don't mama complain don't cry that's
[1:35:58] when you lift your hands and say thank
[1:35:59] you lord thank you lord coz you're
[1:36:01] working on me turkey you look holy Moses
[1:36:05] going down the river uglier and you
[1:36:07] think about how their mama felt Polly
[1:36:09] giving her child up and she knew that it
[1:36:13] was something special about him giving
[1:36:16] him up that's the cost giving him up
[1:36:17] honey but look how's his his sister gets
[1:36:21] anointed and she said mommy you want me
[1:36:25] to follow and see where he goes she says
[1:36:28] yes child yes child
[1:36:29] go child so she's going down a little
[1:36:33] girl going down a river fall in the
[1:36:35] basket ha yeah and you know the basket
[1:36:37] had went into territories what she was
[1:36:39] supposed to be she wasn't supposed to be
[1:36:44] there but she went looking at the bonus
[1:36:48] God gave that little girl now look at
[1:37:02] God the cost of that mother giving her
[1:37:05] child up she didn't realize how God was
[1:37:07] positioned replacing everything but look
[1:37:10] now Moses comes in - hallelujah the area
[1:37:13] where we're with Pharaoh's daughters
[1:37:15] right there bathing whatever she is and
[1:37:17] look at God remember we read everything
[1:37:20] he's be playing because God is infinite
[1:37:22] he already knows why her because the
[1:37:24] baby had to go to somebody who had a
[1:37:27] desire for a child no the baby gotta
[1:37:38] somebody who's gonna have compassion
[1:37:40] because she didn't have no children but
[1:37:43] she was longing for a baby
[1:37:45] now here comes this baby down the river
[1:37:48] honey and she receives it and she says
[1:37:51] my God has answered my prayer when it
[1:38:01] was the real God
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:17] and then here comes Miriam oh do you
[1:38:22] want me to get one of the Hebrew mothers
[1:38:23] to come in and feel this job yes yes the
[1:38:27] cost of giving him up was her receiving
[1:38:30] him again so now Moses is nanny is his
[1:38:55] mama he's been raised by the nanny /
[1:39:03] mama
[1:39:05] and Pharaoh's mother Pharaoh's daughter
[1:39:08] don't even know who she is the woman who
[1:39:16] gave up you didn't hire to take care of
[1:39:18] them hey honey hey honey you know that
[1:39:36] you're something great about you your
[1:39:38] deliverer every day your deliverer
[1:39:41] there's something about you your
[1:39:42] deliverer - one day honey
[1:39:46] Moses told him down and fight now he
[1:39:48] didn't know the cost of what it was
[1:39:51] gonna be to become that deliverer
[1:39:53] he didn't know that one day huh
[1:39:56] so much a connection and anger was gonna
[1:39:59] rise up he was gonna see how these
[1:40:02] people getting beat honey never identify
[1:40:05] with them people before but this one day
[1:40:07] something came over him way he couldn't
[1:40:09] take it no more
[1:40:10] goes up to eat chips and pop his neck he
[1:40:15] didn't realize the cost of becoming a
[1:40:16] deliverer
[1:40:19] now oh yeah it gets out that Moses
[1:40:22] hardly next in line to the throne
[1:40:25] has killed one of his own for the Hebrew
[1:40:28] slaves now he has to run for his life
[1:40:33] but you know that was God's plan because
[1:40:37] way back there on the backside of the
[1:40:39] desert God had this special bush sitting
[1:40:42] there
[1:40:45] he had the special bush sitting back
[1:40:47] then at a point in time he was gonna
[1:40:50] call Moses name so Moses had to leave
[1:40:53] Egypt hallelujah and get in position
[1:40:55] he's God calling his name before the
[1:41:00] foundation of the world but look at all
[1:41:05] the things he had to give up Church
[1:41:06] hallelujah he couldn't have a
[1:41:08] relationship with his brother and his
[1:41:09] sister couldn't have a relationship with
[1:41:11] his mom and his daddy
[1:41:15] amen so no doubt all of us go through
[1:41:25] things but let's start looking at it for
[1:41:28] what it is I don't know about y'all but
[1:41:32] when I go through stuff I'm like saying
[1:41:36] you ain't you ain't doing nothing

[1:46:50] somebody might be slinging the spirit up
[1:46:53] in here find yourself shaking don't know
[1:46:56] what's coming over you but Church I
[1:47:01] started to think about Paul oh yeah
[1:47:04] Paul didn't know the cost of being
[1:47:06] position replaced because Church he
[1:47:09] persecuted the church he did so much
[1:47:11] stuff hardly that he had to look back on
[1:47:14] and say look good idea to the place when
[1:47:18] God was calling him and eyes the Prophet
[1:47:21] didn't even want to go pray for him but
[1:47:23] then God had to step in and say let me
[1:47:25] tell you who this is when the devil
[1:47:28] saying you don't belong oh you ain't by
[1:47:30] God steps in honey and begins to testify
[1:47:33] over you that's what he did the job how
[1:47:36] do you the devil was going to afro
[1:47:38] Gosling have you considered my servant
[1:47:41] job but look at Paul Paul a night and
[1:47:52] day in the sea bit by fiber oh yeah oh
[1:47:55] my church stolen wilt throw the wall in
[1:48:00] the city all these things why hug that
[1:48:03] he might bring forth Christ but this is
[1:48:08] my goal by the grace of God to look at
[1:48:11] everything I go through just like Paul
[1:48:14] did in his eyes Paul Paul y'all know
[1:48:18] Paul was feared he was feared
[1:48:21] you know his letters and things he wrote
[1:48:23] hardly Dave play with Paul it's just
[1:48:26] like Samuel read your Bible with Samuel
[1:48:29] they say do you come in peace they knew
[1:48:33] that that prophet had God backing him up
[1:48:36] they say just one of the sisters told me
[1:48:39] one of our brother bills daughter Holly
[1:48:42] told me that earlier that when people
[1:48:46] begin to talk about her father and they
[1:48:48] Church back in them days somebody died
[1:48:53] remember but the prophet of God is in a
[1:48:56] service and the man is on the balcony
[1:48:58] and he stands up how do you resist the
[1:49:00] Providence and in what name do you do
[1:49:02] this up it'll probably say the name you
[1:49:04] don't listen about any and drops dead
[1:49:05] right there we got God you ain't got you
[1:49:10] ain't got to do nothing don't pick up
[1:49:12] the weapons don't get no scriptures no
[1:49:15] clothes no Lester let God fight you back
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:24] the cost of being positionally placed
[1:49:28] but it was God perfecting sure she yeah
[1:49:33] like I say a night and day and seeing
[1:49:35] will over five times far they strikes on
[1:49:39] bit by a snake
[1:49:41] oh yeah in the boat the boat tears up
[1:49:44] and not in the river floating in the
[1:49:46] ocean floating all that for the gospel
[1:49:50] church EDD gets to just to a grouping
[1:49:53] and get another gotten him you know um
[1:49:56] Festus he's stand before him and say
[1:49:59] Paul you've gone mad you're mad
[1:50:02] I love my people children I'd like to
[1:50:05] say that what is wrong with her she's
[1:50:07] mad yeah boy but you know church Harley
[1:50:15] they looked at Paul 56 ever learning is
[1:50:18] piling your judgment all you losing it
[1:50:21] he said no Paul say for this purpose I
[1:50:23] can't I'm going to wrong I got to go
[1:50:29] through some stuff but I'm going yeah I
[1:50:32] might get whipped I might get scarred I
[1:50:34] might even get thrown in jail
[1:50:36] but just remember bring me a coke
[1:50:42] all the stuff he went through why the
[1:50:45] cost of what he went through
[1:50:47] why did he have to go through that
[1:50:48] because in bajalia was the book of
[1:50:52] Romans so Paul had to go through
[1:51:08] something so dark and stuff but hey I'm
[1:51:24] feeling I'm feeling close hey put that
[1:51:28] last one a life story I'm a close now we
[1:51:31] think that brother Branham lives such a
[1:51:36] glorious life that man went through
[1:51:39] something he went through something I
[1:51:41] think we realized how many times he
[1:51:43] tried to commit suicide how many times
[1:51:46] he got discouraged with the people who
[1:51:48] wouldn't receive his mess y'all know one
[1:51:50] of the greatest ones one of the
[1:51:51] statements he made he said you know what
[1:51:53] I'm gonna live in the woods he's am
[1:51:59] tired of this I'm tired of this I'm
[1:52:01] going to live in the woods and when they
[1:52:03] want me to pray for somebody I come my
[1:52:05] den and in the midst of hammering that
[1:52:07] salt he see two bones and then God
[1:52:10] begins to talk to him and say if you try
[1:52:12] what you plan it you're gonna end up
[1:52:14] like that see that was a cost of being a
[1:52:19] prophet there was a cough I know
[1:52:21] brothers hallelujah who've been in his
[1:52:23] meetings and one brother told me he said
[1:52:25] you have a big meeting and the Prophet
[1:52:27] was the speaker and all these
[1:52:28] denomination people as he's even
[1:52:30] preaching everybody was blessed he said
[1:52:32] all the big preachers be walking around
[1:52:33] talking to each other he said it a
[1:52:35] prophet being a calling like this just
[1:52:36] sitting in there was a loneliness behind
[1:52:43] bringing this word that was the cost the
[1:52:48] cost of you and I getting this word in
[1:52:51] this day
[1:52:52] to become perfect even
[1:53:15] a revelation I know something I know
[1:54:21] some of you brothers deeper than me it's
[1:54:22] alright I'm good I'm good in my in my
[1:54:25] skin I like being simple I'm good but
[1:54:30] listen this was when the Prophet told he
[1:54:33] sees his father-in-law and his
[1:54:34] mother-in-law and God told him he got to
[1:54:37] go preach the Pentecostals but now he's
[1:54:39] going hallelujah uh-uh
[1:54:41] okay this is where he says he has to go
[1:54:46] to his mother-in-law and she didn't
[1:54:49] believe she can see the Pentecostals
[1:54:50] bunch of crazy people
[1:54:51] Wow fanatic people you gonna go to
[1:54:58] spirit truth can't believe a father to
[1:55:01] me
[1:55:02] right the man Christ Jesus
[1:55:07] okay see what I see look this is well I
[1:55:14] went and I had to tell her mother and
[1:55:17] that did work so good
[1:55:20] she said William she said she's your
[1:55:23] wife you may take her if you want to but
[1:55:27] said I don't want my daughter drugged
[1:55:29] out among that bunch of trash mmm trash
[1:55:34] she call the people of God what God told
[1:55:37] the property to go get the Holy Ghost
[1:55:39] trash she was calling God's move I look
[1:55:46] at the cost the Prophet loved her
[1:55:48] he said friends I found out this that
[1:55:51] what she thought was trash is the cream
[1:55:54] of the crop earlier he said that's right
[1:55:57] we know that's right and I say that with
[1:56:01] respect sent out like holy that were all
[1:56:04] the caring and screaming and carrying on
[1:56:07] like that said why don't you go on up
[1:56:10] there and be a pastor then some days
[1:56:13] he'll they'll bill you parsonage and all
[1:56:16] that now the story goes on um I'm just
[1:56:20] I'm gonna just cut it off hallelujah but
[1:56:23] story goes on from there if you read out
[1:56:26] a little bit more he said and hope did
[1:56:29] live too much longer after that that was
[1:56:34] the daughter of the woman who called
[1:56:36] God's work trashed so the Prophet it
[1:56:41] cost him to be position replaced because
[1:56:44] he loved his wife he loved his in-laws
[1:56:47] and he didn't want to go so God had to
[1:56:51] move hope out the way even move sharing
[1:56:54] roles things that were connected to her
[1:56:56] had them moving that way to get him in
[1:57:01] position
[1:57:02] ain't you glad oh yeah God put him in
[1:57:06] position now for years he never got over
[1:57:11] that
[1:57:12] but he kept preaching for years he had
[1:57:17] to be Mama and Daddy the bill appalled
[1:57:18] that was the cost of being position
[1:57:22] replaced for years
[1:57:25] hallelujah people thought he was a devil
[1:57:26] because he was seeing visions that was
[1:57:31] the cost of being positioned in place

[2:07:09] really loves them how can God be just
[2:07:11] and loving if he stands by and watches
[2:07:14] his people suffer that is what they ask
[2:07:17] in Malachi 1 and 1/3
[2:07:19] he said the burden of the word of the
[2:07:21] Lord to Israel but Malachi I have loved
[2:07:24] you save the Lord yet we say we're
[2:07:27] enhanced I loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[2:07:30] brother said the Lord yeah I love Jacob
[2:07:33] and I hated Esau remember the Bible says
[2:07:35] that he loved Jacob and Esau the
[2:07:38] brothers not even haven't done any good
[2:07:40] or evil but that the purpose to election
[2:07:43] might be fulfilled
[2:07:44] oh yeah he says the burden of the word
[2:07:50] when you say he said yeah we say we're
[2:07:53] hands I loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[2:07:56] brother says the Lord yeah I love Jacob
[2:07:58] and I hated Esau and sent his mind
[2:08:01] latest mountains in his heritage ways
[2:08:03] for the dangers of the wilderness you'll
[2:08:06] see they could not figure out God's love
[2:08:11] say they saw that love meant no
[2:08:15] suffering
[2:08:30] and chase yes sir hey man nobody y'all
[2:08:35] but I know God love me cuz I didn't got

[2:09:21] out how I turned out
[2:09:22] Bible studies I didn't wanna have holy
[2:09:25] all that made me turn out the way I
[2:09:27] turned out thank God for the
[2:09:30] chastisement that was her love and God
[2:09:36] is the same way
[2:09:36] hey man let me keep going he said they
[2:09:40] couldn't figure out God's love they
[2:09:42] thought that love meeting no suffering
[2:09:43] they thought that love me
[2:09:45] hallelujah a baby with parents of care
[2:09:47] but God said his love was elective love
[2:09:49] the proof of his election that no matter
[2:09:52] what happened his love was proven truly
[2:09:55] by the fact they were chosen unto
[2:09:57] salvation because God have chosen you to
[2:10:00] salvation through sanctification of the
[2:10:02] Spirit and belief of truth listen to
[2:10:07] this church God's will what is that
[2:10:13] God's no like I said
[2:10:15] the blessings of coronavirus some people
[2:10:18] have died days of suffering suffering
[2:10:29] God's children even his wife says your
[2:10:48] breath stink go back and read it there's
[2:10:54] a place in there what she said she
[2:10:55] couldn't even stand the way his breath
[2:10:56] smell and she was saying God and that is
[2:11:06] his prerogative honey see God had a
[2:11:08] perogative before Bobby Brown we jump
[2:11:16] around with Bobby and God already got a
[2:11:20] plane God I already say this is the way
[2:11:23] I'm gonna do it
[2:11:25] gosh it is my prerogative bless I can
[2:11:31] save save I don't resurrect leveling

[2:13:22] [Applause]
[2:13:28] we were here that nonsense I told my
[2:13:35] son-in-law I am what I am because of
[2:13:37] watching my pastor and living his
[2:13:39] message that is his prerogative
[2:13:48] he is sovereign but it is all with the
[2:13:51] purpose Church all of us with a purpose
[2:13:57] Korona thank God he didn't have a
[2:14:01] purpose he would be the frustrations and
[2:14:05] not of peace but Jack I believe that was
[2:14:12] prophetic the blessings of Corona God
[2:14:17] has a purpose if he didn't have a
[2:14:19] purpose he'd be the author frustrations
[2:14:22] and not of peace how many know the Bible
[2:14:25] says he's not the author of confusion
[2:14:27] but he's the Prince of Peace his purpose
[2:14:35] is after we have suffered a while we
[2:14:39] would be made perfect be established
[2:14:42] troops in the cellar as Joe saying he
[2:14:45] puts strength in us I'm gonna stop very
[2:14:48] dangle Reno but just realize we serve a
[2:14:53] god that's ain't control don't worry
[2:14:56] about the cost

[2:15:06] could bear it you can talk about for the
[2:15:09] rest of your life while you're on desert
[2:15:11] you could bear it that's just the cost
[2:15:13] of being perfected remember honey Joseph
[2:15:18] Jacob Jacob don't get me started with
[2:15:21] Joseph the cost church the cost of being
[2:15:28] separated from his family church see God
[2:15:31] had a certain plan but we had what we
[2:15:34] okay Church God God God had a certain
[2:15:38] plan honey

[2:16:00] y'all gonna bow down to put in the midst
[2:16:03] of our ladies daddy still loves him
[2:16:05] honey now his brothers his brothers
[2:16:07] hardly were jealous of him
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:17:17] because the bacon
[2:17:25] that's what it costs a file of demons he
[2:17:33] had to be treated unfairly and last of
[2:17:36] all he had to be forgotten

[2:17:46] I was gonna take him say don't forget
[2:17:48] about me
[2:17:48] he was forgotten all right but then one
[2:17:51] day one day honey Pharaoh had a dream he
[2:17:58] had a dream see he had to go through all
[2:18:01] that to get to the throne he said I
[2:18:13] remembered my mistake there's a man in
[2:18:18] your Jail who has just said the Lord
[2:18:24] watch him up bring him before me
[2:18:28] tell him the seven years of prison seven
[2:18:33] years family honey
[2:18:34] Pharaoh say hey who else should I put in
[2:18:37] this position but a man like you the
[2:18:40] only thing gonna separate me and you is
[2:18:42] our seats about what could it be
[2:18:52] God got a throne for you waiting with a
[2:19:02] reputation of somebody being thrown in a
[2:19:04] pit

[2:19:07] on with a reputation of being thrown in
[2:19:09] jail not he wouldn't I come down and
[2:19:14] everybody saying bow the knee
[2:19:16] Joseph is coming the cost of being
[2:19:23] positionally placed and from there just
[2:19:26] beginning to run the whole country God
[2:19:29] even put his enemies back in his hand
[2:19:31] can you imagine now he's running I'm
[2:19:34] sorry
[2:19:36] he's running the country everybody that
[2:20:25] ever did wrong the cost had become
[2:20:32] changed he got it all in his pocket
[2:20:37] whatever he wanted to do but what was
[2:20:40] God doing God was building character the
[2:20:43] whole time because God knows won't put
[2:20:46] his enemies everybody back in his hand
[2:20:50] and what did Joe subdue and his brothers
[2:20:55] once he revealed himself he say go get
[2:20:58] my daddy bring him back they brought
[2:21:00] daddy back hug daddy could see everybody
[2:21:03] bless everybody lay hands on everybody

[2:21:06] back with one more life do anything
[2:21:09] don't kill us before he died but still
[2:21:17] but Joseph knew the purpose of
[2:21:19] everything he went to he said what y'all
[2:21:22] meant for evil is for good
[2:21:23] he said God put me here to preserve life
