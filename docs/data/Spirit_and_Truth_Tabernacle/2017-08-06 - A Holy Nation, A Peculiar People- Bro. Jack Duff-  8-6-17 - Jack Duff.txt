the Lord musicians thank y'all so much I appreciate y'all my I was what when I heard that organ fire back that's it now who is that on the organ my praise our precious yesterday on the organ we thank God for just saw up-and-coming musician a man so sad Ansel we think we certainly thank God for her and man I'm just I'm looking for it all God got in store for a man this church a land in the years to come as long as the Lord tarry a man if you always just stand with me I'll read a scripture we again going back to first Peter chapter 2 and we want to read from there just just kind of working our way through this and just enjoying our journey a man as we go and I just been asking the Lord to help me not to move through it too fast I want to try to find that every Leggett in here and and polish it and and you know and just just you know hopefully to be something I've benefited spiritually but but there's there's much much here a man much all through the Word of God but so let's just pick this up here in 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 1 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings and man as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so BG have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood so even as we're going through this this journey the Word of God is actually building us up a spiritual house calling us to this holy precinct right a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ Lord okay let me keep going wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which son by the word being disobedient wearing - also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him with called you out of darkness into his marvelous light that's your personal testimony what he did for you right since which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy and then the Lord as a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bound world of Prayer God we are grateful for the privilege to be able to read the word but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us to understand what it is that we're reading well we look at Peter writing such words as these God we just stop and just really meditate and really reflect on what is he trying to say to us and now we pray that as we go through this thought that you would just speak to our hearts help us all to get ourselves out of the way that we can hear from heaven even on today thank you for everything that's happened thus far in the service be the worship the special that was member of the troy lord I pray that you just bless a man each and one thing each and every one thank you for the sisters Lord and what they're doing with the music and God would just appreciate what we see you doing in our midst we know that only you could do these things so we pray father that you would now blesses that we enter into the Word of God for today it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen so today we will just take our thoughts on a holy nation a peculiar people amen a holy nation a peculiar people and we will just kind of work through this just a little bit the as we were just reading there in the scripture first Peter 2 verse 5 it said you also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable got to God by Jesus Christ and you know I just want to kind of start out you know our thought we're kind of bringing you know still some things from last week you know when we're talking about the royal priesthood you know and we're bringing some things from that they were trying to go forward a little bit and just make a little connection here I mentioned on last week that you know that fault when you talk about royal priesthood there are multiple different channels that you can go in and one of them that I mentioned but you know didn't go into I like to just try to take a little time to try to try to hit that Amen on today but when we talk about you know this when we think think about the priesthood we have to go back and start thinking about Old Testament right we cannot get away from from what what what occur there in the Old Testament amen and and there's a number of things that can be said there you know what one of the key things is you know today that the the women and ministry is something that's dominating you know land right all over the world people believe that everybody is called a preach and everybody's not called to preach but and the way that we the way that we keep our types right the way that we keep our our New Testament view right because the New Testament does not eliminate the Old Testament Amen but but what we got us types and shadows and and all we got to do is look back at the Old Testament and see what God established there we can keep the pattern going right hey man Jesus had come to do away with it he come to magnify it right you know I mean you know and the way that we we can look at that is one statement you know Moses tone say thou shalt not commit adultery right that's what that's what Moses said but Jesus comes along and magnifies that and he said he says he that look at the punna woman a man and lust after her in his heart he has committed adultery already he never even touched a lady right he never laid hands only just his eyes were laid his elated either and that was committing adultery already so Jesus magnified the law not not excluded the long that's not what happened right so when we look at this you know even when we talk about research you know you go back you look and the priesthood was only men right it was only men in the priesthood glory to God so so that's how we know that if it was men back in that time as priests we not talking about being a judge we loved Deborah was a judge but she was not a priest handling the fire of God handling the Word of God only the police handle that oh my god anybody that was not a priest I would try to have that we get in trouble with God you all remember when you know they went to get the ark amen and they went down into into the land of the Philistines because that you know the people that got away from the God God in the days of our a lie and you know and the sons don't think so that our end up down there in the land until sighs when they went to go get the ark david is bringing the ark back home right you know I'm sorry I might have that mixed up but I know David went since to go get the ark to bring it back home and when he's bringing it back home there was a man that reached to touch the art and when that man reached out to touch the art that man dodged right not anybody just couldn't do that I know nowadays we got anybody touching the art but it was it was not that way in the old testament if a man test your can he was supposed to he thought I don't care how good his intention was it was not based on good intentions based on what the line of God said God said only the please pick carry the ark hallelujah so that's the way it was you know back there in the Old Testament and when when we look at you know these things a man I want to just kind of bring out because we talked about a priesthood we have to reflect on you know what occurred there in the Old Testament the priesthood started with this lit with Aaron and his sons amen Aaron and his sons come along when God called Moses as the Prophet the bring delivers to the children is rayul then he raised up Aaron Moses's brother oh my there's a lot to be said right there amen you know you know you hear people always talking about that's a family church that's a family church data you know as a family do this and fans it's just a family Church you got to be careful with that statement because when you really look back in the Bible that the tooth of Israel were family the twelve sons of Jacob Amen the children Israel they were brothers they were family that was a family church right glory to God so you got to be very careful with you when you make statements like that and sometimes just the devil trying to come against people but all you know less light and malice and landside envying lay aside all that stuff because that's not what we're talking about hallelujah but you know went went went went with it when they were coming along here Aaron a man is ordained to be a man a priest he was the high priest in that day and you know his sons ordained to be priests as well now when we look at this scripture a man in 1st Peter to father says he also has lively homes are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ you just can't offer up anything you want to offer up it's got to be according to the Word of God because Aaron's sons got in trouble for offering a strange fire those boys died because they offered the wrong type of fire to God I mean people ain't dying today physically but they certainly find spiritually because they're all for their own sacrifices to God you got to offer to God where he wants a man we can't be like King right Cain Cain thought he could come with his offering in that time and say you know this is some fruit of the field and this is you know this this looks good this was beautiful I'm gonna present this to God God did not accept what Cain had to offer and even today I can tell you God is not accepting a lot of stuff that people are offering even though they do it in the name of Jesus it's not being accepted we want to offer to God a man spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ now listen in the Old Testament you know when they when the priests would you know that their duty was to serve to intercede on behalf of the people Atlanta you know the kind of take the sacrifices that the people would bring in and they were offered as sacrifices to God it was it was the priest duty to do these things amen the priest kind of stood in the gap there you know it was the priests duty after to handle these things God established the priests to take care he established the Aaronic priesthood to take care of that now I look at it uh you know we brought out last week au Uzziah being a king he was not supposed to take the office of a priest but he did and when he did he got in trouble with God he didn't die but he did get he was stricken with leprosy because he took on the office of a priest now in Old Testament he could not take on that office being a king because God established in a certain way that nobody to cross those lines but in the New Testament that thing has changed because the blood of Jesus Christ makes the difference the reason we can call ourselves Kings the reason we can call ourselves priests is because we've been washed loose in the blood hallelujah don't you ever ever take for granted what the blood has done for you listen now so in Old Testament a man was preached in a certain order that people would come God established a certain place for people to bring their their sacrifices they have to bring it to the temple they have to bring it a man you know the temple was designed a certain way when they had to get there and you know and that that was where God would meet them so it within the congregation of Israel God had a certain place that he would meet them and they they knew the glory of God was there and what would happen they would go to the temple the temple was designed with three sections they add the outer Court of the temple a man they had the inner Court of the temple and then they had what we call the Holy of Holies or also called the most holy place amen now what would happen in the outer court they had a brazen altar for all the burnt offerings so when a person seen a man they would come and bring their offering a man to the priests for him to kill a man the offering and God would accept that sacrifice the personal mission for the thing God would accept that and he would actually lay the since only animal that was being offered hallelujah some man would come with his animal and when you came to you know when you came there before the priests you could not pick out your worst animal you had to bring God your best if you bring in a lamb you had to bring him your best one without spot or wrinkle you had to offer that to God Amen don't come to God with your leftovers come to God with your best hallelujah amen you know so here that you know they were they were coming and went when when the worshiper would come with his lamb and and then he would give it to the priest and the priest which would take the neck the lemon and slice it and the blood will come out showing that it was going to take blood to rid us of our sin it was going to take look and only the blood of Jesus could rid us of my taste blood is what God accepted right so here you know the worship were coming then then we lay their hands on the only lamb and and and actually lay their hands on the lamb they're transferring their sins to the lamb and the priest lays the lamb and God accepts that sacrifice for sin so the priest was serving they were interceding eat on behalf of the people now listen so the priests when they went out they what they what they were they were they were grown up the burnt offering I mean the brazen altar for the burnt opens they have elaborate air for washing and the priest would accept and then all for the sacrifices on behalf of the people listen in the inner court which is also called the holy place there was a golden altar of incense the table of showbread and a golden candlestick and and there the priest would enter daily to intercede on behalf of the people as they offer Amen instance which was which was really prayer that was going up before God it was representative of prayer the priests are the ones that would offer the prayer oh come on church this is this is why I was selling saying last week we come amen on Sunday morning as priests when we come on Tuesday night we come ask reason because you know you got love with that that are in a condition where maybe they can't get a prayer through the gods may be not in the place where God would accept their prayer hallelujah but we come amen because we've been washed in blood amen when you come God not looking at your sin God see the blood of Jesus Christ amen you got rats in and that's red blood and read through red makes white hallelujah glory to God Church so so God not looking at he's looking at what a finished product of what he's done with his blood over you through you in you amen better washer they loose from everything thank you Jesus so when we come we come as priests hallelujah and you know just just kind of looking at this amen when the priest was going to that inner court and it offered the incense before God they did this daily in the mornings and in the evenings amen they win and they did they offered that incense and it was just it was prayers that were going up that that's what this was it was just a prayers the instance that was going up before God and God just accepting that but when it came to the Holies of Holies or what we call the most holy place and there was a mercy seat and also the Ark of the Covenant and the Ark of the Covenant were the ten commandments that God had give him a man Moses on the mountain you know when he gave them that he placed it inside this mercy seat and the high priest was the only person that could go inside this place and he only went in once a year on the Day of Atonement and only the high threes anybody else that was not the high priest that was going inside this place it was certain death hallelujah glory to God once a year on one day out of the year a man which was the Day of Atonement the high priest would approach this place now I want you to stay with me here amen just a little bit I want to bring in a couple things because we're talking about being a royal priesthood now when you when you when you really begin to think about what those priests have been doing the sacrifice that they had to make I mean daily they were sacrificing on behalf of the people you can see why they couldn't go to work right they couldn't go out and get a normal job like everybody else the Levites has a stay there and all for on behalf of the people daily now now that the problem that happened back in that time underneath that Aaronic priesthood one of the big problems that even though a person would bring their sin offering to God and they had offered to the priest they were they were they would they would stand there put their hand on that animal see the blood transfer amen their sin transfer to that mantel through the blood that was sacrificed but yet the desire for seeing still was in them so here they might leave they'll go out and they think they've done their duty but the desire for sin is still on the inside of them that's why we needed the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost takes me these fire away and when you been baptized with the Holy Ghost and you can call yourself a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people if the Holy Ghost that sets you apart you can't be holy without the Holy Ghost you can't be holy you can you can try to be holy but it is impossible for you to be holy without the Holy Ghost in your life you just go through motions hallelujah glory to God let's just kind of let's look at this a little bit amen a couple things that the prophets in and you know I'll read one but another amen when you were when you were a Levite and you were offering sacrifice he's on behalf of the people the thing of it is that you had to be born of that tribe you could not be of the tribe a man of Benjamin or the tribe of a fan or gather you can be one of other tribes and then try to take on the job you know of the Levites who can do that you had to be born of that lineage in order to make offerings on behalf of the people you had to be born of that lineage and in order to be a royal priest of God you have to be born again alright look at this believers out this I'm reading something here a man just from the Prophet says I Aaron when he went into the holiest of holies once a year he had to wear a certain kind of a garment and he had to be anointed and he had to take blood with him is that right and on the hem of His garment he had a pump and so this is the day of you know the Day of Atonement that he's going into the holiest of Holies now-now-now when he went in a man noticed he had to be dressed a certain way when it goes into the Holies of Holies it causes him to be dressed a certain way right he had to be anointed he had to take blood with him a man and all on the hem of his garment he had a poly granite and a bale of pomegranate and a bale and he and as he walked he had to make that play oh my god see as he walked a man in this industry had to make that the bells play holy holy holy unto the Lord now as he walked into this most holy place this is what he made the Bears play I want you to see something it's hard meaningless trying to my thoughts all over the place but I've got it I gotta inject these things amen since Jesus came we don't have this place anymore when Jesus died the temple veil was rent torn in two and we don't have this place anymore it was death if a man went in and he was supposed to go into that place back in that day but in this day and this day it is death if you stay out so God and calm you just of your church limba God and calling you to stand in the outer court darling call you to stand in the inner course but God wants you to go all the way in until the Holies of Holies hallelujah somebody so people satisfy test being on the outside but God wants you to come all the way on the inside he's called you to be a part of a holy nation a royal priesthood oh come on search so this goes deeper and deeper and deeper and enviable so just to ask you look at your own life and see where you can go deeper with God look at your own life now I mean that yes easy for me to call out difficult but look do a self-evaluation come on come on come on see it started and they start with a little prayer meeting but God trying to go further than the prayer me oh my god God what God want to take you to so deep in him my god the devil can find you he want to take you wavy yeah I mean you know you don't even realize the depths of God yes we're just scratching the surface that's it right there we it's untapped source s y'all trying to get you there so you might have got him well you might have got here worries you may have come to come to the church you know one reason I don't know what that reason is but God God I mean you might have thought oh you was doing some but God has something else planned oh my god got something else play God want to take you look deeper oh my mind glory to God you come I mean it don't worry hang on drown you got drown he let Peter drown he won't let you drown glory to God all right all right a man look at this you know because we you know we bring in this amen to today's time the reeds the reason we can even call ourselves royal priesthood is because of what the blood of Jesus Christ did that's why amen so when we go back we get these Old Testament acts we want to bring them forth so we can see where we are today we're no longer under the Aaronic priesthood brother Branham say we're under the priesthood of Melchisedec milk the Melchizedek Priesthood is where we are now hallelujah hallelujah all right let me let me just go on a little further and in this pendants quote believers out this he says he had the pomegranate Abell and he walked and as he walked he had to make that play holy holy holy unto the Lord now now now now now that's what the the high priests actors doing the reason that the bells will ring that's how they knew the man was still living if the bells stop ringing they knew maybe there was something in his life I mean the bells stop ringing can I just say this way what causes a bell to stop bringing in your life huh why's the bells stop ringing in your life we need to hear the bells amen we want we want to hear noise glory glory to God we want to hear the noise run around and say free you should see we should hear amen every once in a while we should hear glory to God every once in a while we need to hear the noise they let us know that to Lennon we want to know that you living with some time in the Word of God get good see it's okay to say Amen Matt you know it's alright I mean when we you know this is going to be the quietest place that you'll ever be right here where you are right now if you go to hell which I hope you don't let if you go it's going to be weeping and gnashing of teeth right but if you go to heaven it's going to be joy unspeakable and full of glory come on somebody so the Word of God can't to get good to save in somebody hallelujah we want to hear the bells ringing glory to God not now if you come to church like this you know one brother told brother Branham say you know them people just be shouting and all kind of stuff in church and say hey man you say brother that that just scare me so I just I feel I feel very uncomfortable when they do that he said what'd he say I enjoy it when they do it they say I enjoy it you know he said he'd say well he say he'd say you know if you if you if you if you are go to if you go to heaven it's going to be so much noise up there you're gonna breathe right you say hey buddy you know if you go to hell it's gonna be noise I'm saying it's the quietest place ever be saying you got to enjoy with people when people are pulling on the Word of God it actually makes it make it easier the service become easy with everybody begin the pool Oh glory and it also shows that your life is holy holy holy Willie sometimes the reason we can't say a man the reason the bells stop ringing because we don't let stand get in there somewhere come on somebody but if you keep the thin out your bells are keep ringing listen listen he says he says um and as he walked he had to make that play holy holy and holy unto the Lord and only way that they know that the man was still alive that God hadn't slayed them back there in behind the curtain because it because that noise they can hear the bell ringing I tell you the only way I know there's any life in the church when a little noise get started somewhere you know just a little a man once in a while or a little something you know make a little noise Amen you got a license from the Prophet make a little noise all right hallelujah say some of them say what brother branham is emotional well I can scientifically prove to you anything without emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got any emotion in it bury the thing that's right cuz it's no good instead a man we thank God for a little emotion amen we think up or you know he deserves a little emotion out of us and all you done did for us he deserve just a little emotion hey man I mean you know at a football game to give emotions and a basketball game to give emotion I mean you know football game they get they get so excited guys be jumping in the end snack enhancing why can't we do something like that and when when God do something special for a high five and then the way where we was coming up in here we did all kind of stuff run up to the church with our big a man by the time we before we can get that top seat we gonna turn around again we let the devil know that we was in charge hallelujah we did my face of God y'all and a Demming or take my praise not hallelujah somebody god is too good for me too good to me for me to just spit on them he go get a little Amen for me sometime amen glory to God glory to God it is so is so that the bells are still ringing Amen not my mom not just a mental agreement Peyman scare the devil out the church hallelujah hallelujah I came thinking of scripture right now but I believe it's Islam oh yeah let the redeemed of the Lord know let the redeemed of the Lord not that ain't the Bible the Bible say let the redeemed of the Lord say so glory to God if you know you've been redeemed you out of a man every once in a while that that let us know the bells are still ringing alright alright hallelujah alright let me let me go on here amen I'm going to the unveiling of God oh let me just I don't want to skip this um Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're talking about the priests a man we're talking about the priests talking about that air ironic priesthood but that now is done away with now because of the blood of Christ a man we have been called to this royal priesthood we are holy nation a peculiar people and y'all just bear with because like I said I want to I'm transitioning you know into all of this so I might not be able to get all the way to you know my full thought today but just think about the words right holy nation peculiar people peculiar strange strange that that's who we are the Bible says that's who we are we don't act like other people we don't dress like other people when we walk we walk holy holy holy unto the Lord our sisters got this covered and they got that covered and that's not too tight and that's not too revealing even even the brothers got things covered that's not too tight that's not too revealing got a text from brother say brother you know I'm changing my whole wardrobe right because it's how I want to walk this walk holy holy holy unto the Lord come on a man yes it's gonna cause you to dress Wang brothers to put up their shorts to put on their long pants yeah I believe this holiness is certainly a lifestyle Amen it's a way of life this this holiness that's only inside should be reflected on the outside come on somebody amen you know I mean cuz you know people try to redefine holiness nowadays Amen but if you really holy on the inside it's gonna manifest itself on the outside you can look like the world and be holy you can't act like the world will be holy God holy means separate it a man so if you looking just like the world how you don't say you holy come on church it may cause us to be a holy nation and I tell you I'm not ashamed of this I'm we going to be peculiar we're gonna be strange that's exactly who we are sometimes you know people that say why y'all do this right we a holy nation a peculiar people and trust me if you ever get the baptism the Holy Ghost you also become a holy nation and a peculiar person praise the Lord it's real simple all right let me let me go on let me hear Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he makes this statement he says this but now in the Old Testament there was three ways of knowing the message so back back there and Old Testament was still bringing that type over hey man there's three ways of knowing the message first it was the law that's the Word of God all right the second it was a prophet so if you want to know whether it was right just look at the Word of God if the Word of God tell you is wrong it's wrong no no no questions about if the word says is wrong is wrong hey man now we try to compromise with it and you know I heard somebody say yesterday you know people try to say well you know that was written for that time that devil is a liar got it right now just for that time God has given you his thoughts for all time and what you got to do is apply yourself appropriately Amen well that that was set for that time no no no if you if you really looking at the script you got to go back and line up to what what Israel was doing in the Old Testament if you come here our holy priesthood how you going to be a part of our holy priesthood and not know what the original priesthood was like all right come on church say man it's real it's real simple listen so so it first is the law second it was a prophet and third was a dreamer and then they had a way of proving that oh my right whether it was just exactly right or not now in the erotic or Levitical priesthood on eros breastplate had 12 stones and it's not exactly known by the scholars whether it was a reflection of the 12 stones together or a certain sacred life that when a prophet prophesied or a dreamer told his dream or whatever it was and these supernatural lights didn't flash on this wall was called was called Durham Thummim and if this supernatural light didn't class and give witness to that well then it was a wrong no matter how true the Prophet was or how real the dreamer was or whatever the revelation was it had to be witnessed by the Urim Thummim if it wasn't it wasn't true any scripture scholar knows that so you know just just to break that down when a man would have a dream or you know a profitable prophesy day become before the Urim Thummim era it was Aaron's breastplate him being a high priest this was his breastplate when they were tested when they were prophesy get dust half the Lord the Lord said this everybody turn it just look at that your own thumb it's at your own thumb him then slash that man was as good as dead and if the dream of said something and that I mean you know they're what the Lord say you had a dream okay all right all right no no flash get the rocks right get the rocks he was dying right it they wouldn't even give him a second chance to prophesy all to tell a dream he was dead immediately they didn't lay games with that so when you when you when you prophesied or you gave your dream it had to have to reflect the supernatural light had to go off the problem is we don't have one of them today because I'll tell you what if we didn't have worth it'll be a lot of dead people in the church right a lot of dead folk in the church and I mean nowadays people take prophecy like in it a prophecy ain't never come to pass it's been years for the public saying coming back and they still holding on I mean I've been waiting on this one prophecy somebody told me I'm looking for this man he got something pepper half he's full to be a very wealthy man he's supposed to give me a lot of money left sound right I went to another church they prophesied and told me and I'm waiting to say God don't give you a city why would God give me a city why why do I need a city I don't need a city anybody you know and then Oh Lord this to give me sits in you know all you got to be a man is a is a visitor in some of these searches you fear business first time they ever saw you you immediately go get Papa title or prophesy - immediately I see I mean you just you just watch our people do this type of stuff like Lord night you don't come on now come on you know you you don't be wanting to go and then just have a critical spirit and things like that but but the church has gotten away if we got back to these biblical principles people wouldn't be just so quickly prophesied if they knew that somebody has some stones waiting on them what you say thus saith the Lord alright watch the day you're them some of them flash that was it they was good intent how am I but today church we don't have that we got something else let's just keep reading ho glory to God so you got you got your own personal urine Thummim Amen said now in the Aaronic priesthood or the Levitical priesthood the priesthood that priesthood was done away with and the urine Thummim of that time ceased but it but in this new priesthood the Bible is God's room Thummim Oh glory to God churchy uh uh you know things be happening and you'd be one of them that you know I'll just you know just just hearing a testimony and you know people share things with you and you try to see how that thing register with the scripture you what's that revelation is that that's not reflect that's not coming out the Bible right that that thing the lights didn't flash you can tell quickly whether lights flashing on the inside of you right I mean like know that revelation ain't sounding just right where are you getting that from what's the source with this no no no no no no I want to go back to the Bible what the Prophet said all right listen it says um he says uh but in this new priests of the Bible is God's Yoram Summum and if a revelation comes a prophet prophesize a church is established of doctrine is made and it don't clash on the Bible then it's wrong this is God's Yoram something we must listen to the word I'm just an old fan good enough to believe that the Bible is written by inspiration and I believe every word of it is God's Living Word and you can you can rest your eternal destination on any word that's written in the Bible so seeing in Moses day Aaron's day they have that year I'm Thummim that Aaron wore you know on this breastplate but in that and underneath that precip somebody say something that they say the Lord told them if that if that those supernatural lights they're not reflect they did not listen to it and today we don't have that the supernatural lights on Aaron breastplate but we do have the supernatural Word of God and if it's not flashing with the Word of God don't you accept it hey man all right listen in the Old Testament one must be born into a certain lineage to tribal Levi to become a priest but the day one must be born again to be part of the royal priesthood once we have received the Holy Ghost we become part of a holy nation a man the Holy Ghost is what's break is what breaks down the barriers of our national heritage I like that the Holy Ghost is what breaks down the barriers of our national heritage you know because you know sometimes people based on the country they're from based on maybe even different parts of the country even in the United States people take on different spirits there's national spirits and the reason I'm this way is because we always do no no no no no no no no no when the Holy Ghost comes in it takes your natural national heritage out and it makes you a part of a holy nation oh not to not the nation that you were born is you come a part of a holy nation and when you become part of this holy nation it causes all of us all the citizens of this kingdom we dressed like we from another Kingdom we put to your people we look straight no matter who we are where we come from we think we become with the Holy Ghost we become part of this holy nation listen we talk the same with comes to the work we dress the same we act the same because God's people have always been strange now you know I was I was as I was just been meditating on the stock I just been kind of following some of the Saints here and there you know with my Instagram account and I'm watching thinks they preaching a sermon before I even get there brother Jerry posted something you know this week I'm like man he already in my notes and sister the only poster seller she in my notes I was like but that's that I was telling brother Trevor that he said that's that that's a new definitional help me preach I help me preach all right and and and I like that all right because we all kind of get in the same channel we realize what God is calling us to amen I mean and you know just have to remind you remember right now you reign with Christ you have dominion over sin you have dominion over the world you have the amendment dominion over your flesh and you also have dominion over the devil glory to God Church we are a holy nation a peculiar people I want to read this quote that sister Naomi put out there I thought it was a blessing amen this is out of reject it King listen to this glory to God he says this but the people had come to a place where they wanted to change this program they looked upon the Philistines and the Amalekites the Emirates the Hittites and the other nations of the world and they have seen that they had Kings that rule them and govern them and guided them and fought their battles and so forth and this seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings and like these people now that's the same things happen to the church where they looked on the other denominations and they want it to be like them right and that's why they've taken on those different spheres of the different denominations right because they want to be like the original denomination which was Catholic they wanted to stay in hierarchical structure and you know if anybody in my age and older we know when I used to go to church and you see that the you you always could tell the the Catholic priests from all the other preachers if it was a Pentecostal or a Baptist or you know a Lutheran or something like that you can always tell the Catholic when it was a little different the way he dressed himself right he had he had a collar on he had all kind of stuff that he was wearing and he always looked a little different than the other preachers but nowadays even in the end the Pentecostal rings I mean you got they want to make sure that you know that they're preaching they got the collar on they got the the the gold thing inside they pocket you know all that means something all of that means and oh you let a leather fella Jeff got got got he just got caught a preached yesterday and he thank you really all that now he feel like he came preaching till he come out in a row and he come out in that robe and he sit there in that chair and you just you just you know who the preacher is it's the man in the road right I mean all that stuff is Catholicism that's come right inside of church and you can't tell the difference anymore hallelujah but we're peculiar people strange folk we don't wear rules and all that other kind of stuff to try to make ourselves look if you know my holiness is not it's not just the rule that you wearing holiness Amen yes holiness does deal with your everyday dress right hold I believe holders deals with that but I think also the way that people try to make themselves holders by putting on all these clothes of priests with it's calling and I mean it just let them make you holy that don't make you whole just because you dressing like that don't make you holy if something that comes out of your heart and the other thing you got to realize it's not your holiness in the first place and it's the holiness of Almighty God and the way you became whole is because you received the Holy Ghost let's read the seem to be that Israel wanted to Pat themselves like these and like these people like these kings and like these people but it's never been this is important thing it has never been in any age God intention for his people to act like the people of the world now listen to that again it's never been in any H God's intention for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governed or controlled like the people of the world God's people is always has been a peculiar people a different people a call down a separating altogether different in their actions in their ways in their manner living than what the people of the world has their appetite for things and all that their makeup is has always been contrary to the things that the people of the world desire now that's how you know where you're part of this holy nation destroy your priesthood is when your appetite is unchanged right if you got if you still got desire a man to you know to try to fit in with the world something wrong with your experience amen you know I know sometimes we you know people get ashamed of what God's done for them and and they want to fit in with their family they want to fit in with their friends you know they just they just want to fit in but you don't realize you already fit in you fit in with us you understand you fit in with us you so you don't have to fit in with them because you fit in with us glory to God I mean I know sometimes the sisters to fit in they put on a little fingernail polish right to fit in that you know that their shortness up in short manner I mean you know you can't do that just to fit in that's not God's people never have done that [Music] that's why I'm so careful of my posting that you're not going to get double messages from me you're not going to get a message like I'm in the world and then another message like I'm in I'm in God know it's going to be one message although I'm in God right I mean it's no it's no it's no you can't you can't be double minded you can't live on both sides of fence you can't do that you know I remember at school get ready to start again I remember a man a situation one time my life and man one year I was in school not man I want to be like everybody else I'm out there acting like everybody else and doing this like everybody else's and I had my you know I called myself a breakdancer back then and all kind of stuff and you know I mean you just you know you could go through these different phases but I remember going through that summer and God had done something special for me and when God did something special for me like no I knew right then I had to make a choice that I that I couldn't you know I couldn't go back and be the same guy was the year before otherwise the devil would have got the victory over me so I remember you know I said Lord up you know what I'm have to just I'm gonna have to be a Christian now you know what and being a Christian I had to change my associates I could hang with the same friends I had a year before I had the fire some new friends I mean they might have been a I mean other guys that was Christians they might not have went to church with me but if they was Christian they believe this Bible I was trying to hang with them I don't want to hang with my office because I knew if I got around the old friends a little pressure from the host it was it would pull me into places that I did wanna do and then I find myself retention all over again I got tired of living that kind of lifestyle so I had to let some of them friends go and I'm gonna tell you just take a just a little bit of a stand just a little bit they will let you go if you can't take a little bit of a stand they will let you go but if you don't in the world you know I'm gonna do this on sunny but that's just Sunday the other six days of the week I do something else no no no no we are a holy nation a peculiar people people are to see the difference in you and that's an everything you do not not just your sunday sunday morning face but that's an everything you do we Christians 24/7 them them priests had to offer morning and evening every day the priesthood they was offering sacrifices what we got to do the exact same thing 24 hours a day seven days a week we're interesting for others glory to God all right all right god never intended for his people to look like the world to act like the world he never intended he always wanted us to be separate always wanted to be different and that's just the way it is can't help that not even trying to change it now I want to tell you something you're gonna be somebody's fool you're gonna be somebody's fool that's what brother Jerry told us in his posts you're gonna be somebody's food now you got to choose whose fool you're gonna be one man walk around walk down the street in California had that sign on his back he said he just walking down said I'm a fool for Christ had a big sign on the front I'm a fool for Christ never I looked at him last phantom but then when you got past him you looked on the back he asked the question whose fool are you some are some are signs say I'm a fool for the devil devil just make me do whatever and I just do it he made me dress this way he made me talk like this even I just do it don't be that kind of fool be a fool for Christ Oh somebody a man all right let me let me let me pick up this side of the oddball because that's what it means amen when we talk about being a holy nation a royal priesthood we are we strangely we act funny we look funny yes that is the truth but God is pleased with it and the reason is art is because Society goes against it but the Bible speaks for it and we try to stay with the Bible right but Society speaks against it that's why ah because everybody else out there doing something else but I'm not doing it because everybody else doing it my parents just saying well if your friends jump off a bridge you're gonna jump with them and we process that from a natural standpoint right but we also need the process that from a spiritual standpoint because some if your friend if your friend is going to live a life that's gonna take them to hell you're gonna live the same life and go with them amen that's for the young people for you go back to school think about it because you are a holy priesthood a holy war priests and a holy nation amen that's who you are I'm telling what the scriptures say you are and ain't no way you can go back into that old lifestyle anymore once you get free you better stay free let's look at this the otball I want to read since then I thought by reading this and thinking thinking on this place up here this coming my mind says Paul saying I have become a fool Paul making the statement and you you know you would find that in 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7 through 14 Paul a great leader of that day he makes a statement I have become a fool a great religious man religiously the knew so much about the Word of God but he makes that statement I think that that's something that we have I mean when we had a real true experience with God we have the same type of statement I have become a fool for Christ listen I have become a fool see now that's a very strange thing for an apostle to say I have become a fool now a fool is a person that really isn't in their right mind and how would this apostle say such a thing I've become a fool and thinking of this group no doubt that in the eyes of the people on the other side you've become a fool you have become what we would call today v oddball no doubt but what people think of that of you and remember that on the other side there are bowls not just depends on how you look at it right I mean they looking at you as an eyeball but I look at them and say y'all are most right since their eyeballs to see so you have to you have to be Matis fool so I'd rather be a fool for Christ see God said his people were a peculiar people are a chosen elected a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to God that is the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name you got to choose whose fool you're going to be listen to this there's some time ago this little sense of humor I hope it doesn't break the fine spirit that's in here just come on my mind it was brother Troy the Full Gospel businessman was telling about this he said I was thinking of this for this young young singer here that's just come to the Lord he was working in he's a meat cutter and he was working in a butcher shop and this was a German there and he and he just kept talking to talking to him about the Lord and this German couldn't couldn't talk English very well they said well he come come on to the meetings that you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm saying the same thing you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said so the old Dutchman want him to know that he was a Lutheran you see he was he was all right he you know they say when you come on up and you visit us once my god just get to the service once it says and so they came across a bunch of perhaps oddballs - as we call it you see and and that night this German man received the bachelor oligos one service the man walks into one service and received the Baptist when Holy Ghost what an atmosphere huh right it says in the next day he was cutting meat and speaking in tongues and singing he was having him a regular Jubilee we talk about God changing phone so after a while the boss of the factor come I said Henry say what's the matter with he said Oh glory to God said I got saved he said why I said where you been so you must have been down there with that bunch of nuts he said listen say yes glory to God said I was down there with with a bunch of nuts he said you know if you didn't have the nuts says you take take like the automobile that comes down the road and you take all the nuts out of it you what you got but a bunch of young now the man can speak in where he was trying to say you got a bunch of junk you need nuts to keep that thing together the reason the family is staying together cuz you got some nuts inside the family that don't mind living for God and when things go wrong you go right to the night there's another tightness hang up for you a little bit either keep it together you take the nut pocket or fall apart glory to God glory to God a man Church I'm so glad I'm a knight you don't be a fool but you got to choose whether you're gonna be a fool for Christ or fool for the demo say what you got but a bunch of young that's just about right you take the nut side anything that takes that to a whole thing together the world gets in such a place and turn the turmoil and the church gets so sold up in worldly ISM and denominationalism and so forth till it takes some time to nut the whole thing together that's right if they don't have it we don't have it we don't have the church now we can think of that subject just for a few moments Paul said I have become a fool or a nut now you have to become somebody's nut you can either be a nut for the world or a nut for Christ I you know you came v in between there is no in-between there is no when it's when you die if you live in for God you go to heaven if you're not living for God you go to hell there is no in-between glory to God right you I mean he it goes on to stay one day in California was walking down the street there was a man he had a sign on front of him set like this I'm a fool for Christ on his back he had a sign that said now whose fool of you see so so we asked him on it that you have to be somebody's fool you got to make a choice now I'm going to tell you it's the Holy Ghost that gives you strength in order to be able to walk around a man like a holy nation a a man a peculiar people it's the Holy Ghost that give you strength to do that and for every young person you know heading back in school don't be ashamed of what God has done for you don't be a dolt don't don't don't don't don't don't don't be ashamed he has pulled you out of darkness and put you into his marvelous light the other person still walking in darkness but since he's done that now he wants to use your life amen he he I mean when he called when he called Israel he said you know y'all gonna be my peculiar treasure my special people I'm gonna do special things for y'all y'all gonna do things together and I'm not doing for any of the other nations God calls him out specifically in the same way he called him out as he's calling us out making us a holy nation that's nothing to be disappointed about when a man finds a bride a man he finds he looks all through the world and he finds one woman that he feels is going to be the woman a man for him and when he makes that proposal to her he's not looking for nobody else to fulfill you know that I mean his heart saying this is the woman that's for me and I'm totally satisfied where the young lady that receives that proposal she's not ashamed that the young man acts hurt especially she loves him that's the man that she want to be with right so I mean in it and if we really want to be with Christ we don't have to be ashamed to be a holy people right we don't have to be ashamed a man to be a you know a peculiar people holy nation a peculiar people we don't have to we like to be ashamed we can hold our heads up high amen because God has made the difference in my lives all right glory to God let me just say something here and we'll we'll come out a man here today when we talk about this holiness we got to be very careful because you know as I bring him the tune of Israel there was a quote in the Philadelphia interchange I won't read it all but brother branham you know makes it very clear that the the Jews got to a point because God had called them you know to a specific places you know and when I'm sharing with us is that God certainly has called us they say you are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him that called you out of darkness into his marvelous light but when we when we realize who we are in Christ we got to be very careful and always stay humble before God because the Jews got to a place when God called them out and made them a elected or selected a chosen nation that they were if the brother Branham says that they say the Jews have always called themselves the children of God it says it said they got to a place where they begin to exclude everybody else they begin to exclude everybody else now we're not we're not the life that we live in is not to exclude anybody but this life is actually to include other people amen but we realize that that you know when when when when we want we don't want to walk around with us without with our chest acad our heads upper you know where we got such a manner arrogant spirit about that that's not what this is to produce is not the bridge you know brother man so you got - you got a void a person with an arrogant spirit oh my god you actually got to run for your life when you see a person with a spirit of arrogance you got to run from them and unfortunately I think the church has come to that point sometimes we get that arrogance spirits but that's not why we try we're not trying to exclude anybody we're trying to include everybody but now when we include you we need you to understand with this little bag you know I felt about I said boy I tell you what I say because of what the blood has done to make us kings and priests you know if the devil himself got washed in the blood you know that devil himself would not be the devil anymore the devil would be my brother in Christ if he was washed in the same blood I was like we're not trying to exclude we try to include but you got to go through the process you can't be a holy nation you can't be a peculiar people if you ain't got the Holy Ghost see brother branham say you know you could tell the person that god you can talk to about two minutes and find out whether they got of the night you found out what they spirit feed on he said you go to a man's office see what he got picked up on the wall what type of pictures he got up on his wall you can tell whether the man with his feet know so now you can got to go to the office you just pick up their cell phone and you start sorting through you listen to the music that they listen to right amen and you know if if you're if you're if your child can't just walk in and just give you their cell phone you know something wrong right there hey man if they just can't go through that you can go through that I ain't got no problem with it now some of them get real bold and they oh yeah I'm gonna let you go through and take me down here something the Holy Ghost will always show you all right somebody a man the Holy Ghost will pick that bank up revealing like that what is this you're not you like acting like a holy nation you're not acting like a peculiar person you're doing the same thing they doing come on somebody I don't even know all the artists nowadays but young people y'all better not be going back to learn that music you know you're out your iPhone your your droid your iPad it shouldn't have the same music that the world got in it yours should be praise and worship exalting Christ now we don't got this blended stuff now can I tell you our you know bless blend it now I mean and that we got we got what we call gospel rap that's from the devil and when we start bringing all those things together right that's that's it if you if you listen to the beats from the world and listen to the beats of the church which one is different if some time I ain't got to be rap it can be just a Kurt Franklin song Kurt Franklin you know man what soon as he came out with stump that somebody should have knew right there something is wrong with this man so spirit behind this if they can play this music in a club and in a church is not something wrong you know something wrong the glory God don't come down and this we supposed to be a peculiar people we don't act like the rest of the world hey man I mean you know I you know and even you know when you when you just listen to this that the the first thing he say out the song for those of you that think gospel music has gone too far pretty much they say you ain't heard nothing yet and that was just the beginning of it never a whoa what do you what'd he say was you should have turned the radio off right then we get that stuff in our spirit but we'll peculiar people like I'm saying you got to listen to dawn mourn all the time if you don't if you don't know who that is check them out friends Laura you know when I was coming up but I tell you certain radio stations you know they didn't have a lot of radio like what we got nowadays now y'all got serious and y'all can just go to whatever station back then we had in this area 89.3 that's all we had 89.3 my mama get to listening to that in the county line oh no anything but 89.3 and I no no no that's just the way it was now you got eighty eight point one you got eighty nine point three eight and I'm in it and you got all counter stations and back back in those days we had you know WPO a.m. 1600 but they only played gospel only on Sundays but we got our gospel music and just for son arrested e arrested at the time they gave it to the world and now hi why is it that even if you know a lot of stations they can you know when the music changes they even tell you what time okay we're not playing gospel anymore we're doing this type of music from here on out they tell you what time has come changed now I mean but but here we get in that and we just we keep listening to you know that music right and we get that stuff in our spirit and not as much and I and our phones and everything else if you wonder why your kids so rebellious listen to their music I know I know that's that that's that's hard but that's that's that's that's that's what the holy nation does the holy nation is not like everybody else when Israel was inside Egypt they look different than the Egyptians guess what we're we're God's holy people living in this world but not of this world that's just where it is you know when you're a holy nation you can't go certain places you can't do certain things when you're a peculiar person I mean ain't no sense you know ain't no sense you invited me to no dance I'm not coming why I invited me to the dance I do not dance like that when it went to Jesus y'all forgiveness it went went to a family reunion and the first thing they do is you know who all liked the dance put your hand up who all liked the dance I'm just sitting there looking I don't know I don't dance like that I don't dance like that not me and who are like the dance that will wait before we get things started we just got everybody like the dance come out to the middle floors ice all these people get out there so we gonna do the electric slide all of them just said the family unions is doing the electric slide I'm just sitting there looking and saying I won on bed night come this way they try to pull me up to get me on that dance floor cause it's going to be some trouble i'ma have to fulfill this quote anybody know the quote brother branham got called to the dance floor one time and he told the lady said I don't dance you say she said no come on it'll be okay to be fun I don't dance I ma'am I don't dance I don't dance and she pulled them on that day say well before I dance the first thing I do is pray and he took her hands snatched him down pulled her down on her knees in the middle ear up and say father the name of Jesus stop praying loud say the DJ heard him praying the DJ's turn the music down picked up his stuff packed up his bags and Jeff that's peculiar people that's peculiar people glory to God you know we don't have to be ashamed of this glory that God go over to God I tell you no but when we when we when we get here we realize this is not to exclude other people but it is to let people know how I am different and I'm and I'm not I'm not ashamed of being different the Holy Ghost makes me different if I did have the Holy Ghost I'll be acting like everybody else but the whole the Holy Ghost which is the holy God spirit dwelling on the inside of me makes me different so I don't go to I can't hang out in certain environments I might visit but I can't hang out there I can't I don't drink so hang out hang around a bunch of people that drink amen I don't drink ain't glory to God I mean you know if you start hanging out you hang out a little bit too it's the first time you're gonna do that second time you gon do nothing but if then people still see you coming in that environment eventually somebody going oh I get you something and oh okay you got me because first date do you know what you just want you wanna coke okay I get I got your coke I get you you know they give me a coke they get your coat next time you're gonna somebody put something in your drink and you might not be able to taste the difference the first time might not be everything but they're just easing you in and bit me and first thing they'd be like total they say they ain't drink but I put some in man they got they got a little bit of that in them and laughing about it let's see you in school to be in that environment if you if you'll peculiar person you spoil the act to kill you you supposed to look peculiar act acute useful to be useful to be in a certain place in Christ where they don't even want you at the party I can I say that again you supposed to be at a certain level in your walk with Christ where they do not want you at the party because they don't have paqu you bring light and darkness all right Church I'm talk about this with church people used to look like you new church vote when you saw them they they came in they I mean just by the way that they dress is the way they care of themselves and you know no no we can't do that in front not folk don't care okay because they haven't seen so much costing so much clothing so much fate you know the law it preaches the drinking and preachers doing all kind of stuff that that you know it's totally against God's Word I had a preacher just confess the other night about something they did I say no you didn't say that in front all these people that's all did what going to conventions and and and and and and cheating on their wives it's supposed to be a preacher going to convention with a bunch of preachers make cheating on their wives at the convention and folks just go to that church like it ain't nothing God calls us to be holy I tell you what I I realized it's the Holy Ghost that's making the difference let me just finish reading a couple things here and i'ma come out I'm in the Philadelphia Church H I'm in paragraph 290 2-1 there's a scripture there that goes along with this age this revelation 3 7 says unto the angel the church and Fidler's up here write these things and he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth no man open it he that is holy is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ look at this says a man of that age and even today we're making the same mistake as the Jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the Philadelphia age they were taking refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ this is the record that God had given us eternal life and this life is in his son and he had he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life man is made holy by the spear it is the spirit of holiness that raised Jesus from the dead and that end Wells us and makes us holy with His Holiness a man I'm going down to paragraph 292 - for he says I'm saying I'm so I'm so glad that my holiness is not of myself I'm glad that I am in Christ with all of his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed ya imparted unto me blessed be God forever Church I tell you what we have a we the Holy Ghost has made a tremendous difference in our hearts and if you've never experienced the baptism Holy Ghost you ought to be crying out to God Lord let me have let me have that the Holy Ghost is what makes a difference you even this quote that I just read you know they were the Jews back there were taking refuge that they were just you know had a synagogue they were joining the synagogue they had a form of worship I was telling earlier we're doing some things and that's great but God trying to take us further in him a little deeper right don't don't just stop at where you are God wants to go further deeper I mean get you so lost in him that the devil can't find you that's what God wants to do so church I want to encourage you please a man go all the way with God I mean this is the blood the blood amen it looses from our sins but it's also placed us a man in a position where we can be kings we can be priests Peter says the chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people amen this is who we are don't be ashamed of who we are less less walking all that God got for us amen I want to encourage you god bless your church let's like word a prayer amen this morning thank you Jesus father we are grateful Lord for of the word that that is called us we're grateful for the blood that is washed us and looseness and it keeps us as your prophet taught us the blood didn't save us but certainly the blood is what's keeping us it was it was grace that saved us but the blood is now keeping us and father and my prayer is that as we've been watched in this blood that we would not be ashamed of who we are yea we are different the Bible says that we're supposed to be different we are a holy nation we are a peculiar people we do strange things it's totally against what the world does but yet it's what you've called us to we don't have to be ashamed with that we don't have to be ashamed and God we we are we were inclusive not exclusive we want to see other people get washed in the same blood and see their lives change just the same way it changed ours Satan has so much to offer the people Satan has so many tricks and so many things Lord that he just wants to present to the people in and oftentimes we're just not spiritual enough to kind of catch what the devil is doing but I pray that the Holy Ghost would anoint our understanding that we would recognize every trick of the devil that Lord we will walk according to your word this is a very unique place to be a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people very very special place to be and let us never ever be ashamed to pray O God that you would help us Lord especially youth as they prepare to go back into school God the devil going to be right there waiting on them got all kind of stuff to offer to them and got my prayers that you would give them strength daily God to overcoming enemy just as the priest with daily offer the sacrifices of the people and daily stand in the gap Lord we want to daily keep the young people in the prayer we want to see them daily father live a - your word god it's a it's not Lord sometimes and it's every day we got to walk this walk our lives has got to cry out holy holy holy unto the Lord not unto Mama's not unto Daddy but it's unto the Lord not unto pastor it's unto the Lord helped us got to live that kind of life we ask it all in the name of Jesus amen praise the name of the Lord amen I pray that God would give each one especially I youth given strength the Prophet told us that in this day is some well actually he said in his day said it was one way for him but he said the next generation will be 10 times worse for that chip that next generation and now we're beyond that day and so I would just you know I think it's been magnified 100 times worse for young people today to try to get through some of the things they're going through and we you know to the youth we don't it's not that we ignore amen and don't understand you know the trials and tribulations that they're going through we realize is the same devil with the same tricks and we realize it's going to take the Word of God and experience with God amen to overcome the enemy once we see state the intensifying his attack God also promises to intensify his attack so all we need is the true experience with God and that's what takes care of amen that's what gives us the victory amen let's say amen stand with me and let's sing a little bit of this event my hallelujah belongs to you Amen my
