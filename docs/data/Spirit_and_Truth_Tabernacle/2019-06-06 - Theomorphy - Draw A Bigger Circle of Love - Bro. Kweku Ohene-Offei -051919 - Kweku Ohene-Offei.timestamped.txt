[44:54] sister Michelle he brought all of you
[44:56] here amen
[44:57] - a Spanish territory because he's a
[45:00] businessman amen
[45:01] glory hallelujah to the Lord so we want
[45:05] to speak on a just go ahead and without
[45:07] taking your time and look at something
[45:09] shall we read a scripture I've got a lot
[45:11] of scriptures but I don't think we can
[45:12] read all of them so we're just gonna
[45:15] read a couple of scriptures here praise
[45:22] God hallelujah now a lot is good he's
[45:30] the same God I live seen lives in Jesus
[45:32] is in you so if the Spirit of the Lord
[45:35] is in you whatever he did in Jesus
[45:36] Christ he's doing the same thing in you
[45:38] know that he would do he is doing it now
[45:41] because it's a present tense god amen so
[45:45] let's go to Genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[45:49] and 2 god bless you sisters and brothers
[45:56] for the songs and the musicians
[45:58] god bless for the other talents Genesis
[46:00] chapter 1 and 2 in the beginning God
[46:03] created the heaven and the earth and the
[46:06] earth was without form and void and
[46:08] darkness was upon the face of the of the
[46:11] deep and the Spirit of God moved upon
[46:13] the face of the waters thus the heavens
[46:18] and the earth were finished and all the
[46:20] host of them amen shall we move to
[46:23] Genesis chapter 2 oh sorry that the
[46:31] other one I read was instructed to
[46:32] sojourn in chapter 2 verse 1 Genesis 2
[46:36] verse 1 and 2 does the heavens does the
[46:41] heavens and the earth were finished and
[46:42] odd and all the host of them and on the
[46:45] seventh day God ended his work which he
[46:47] had made and rested on the seventh day
[46:49] from all his work which had made amen
[46:52] so we want to find out what is the
[46:54] seventh day God is a spirit so how does
[46:57] God rest he doesn't get tired as not a
[46:59] flesh is not a sitting element so he was
[47:01] Elohim
[47:02] what was the rest God was the King for
[47:04] he was looking for a place to dwell in
[47:06] amen he created the solar system the
[47:09] universe the moon the stars but he
[47:12] couldn't rest in the stars
[47:13] he couldn't rest in the trees he
[47:16] wouldn't live in the ocean he couldn't
[47:18] live in the fish but on the seventh day
[47:19] when it created a man a women then he
[47:24] rested
[47:24] jump into the women amen he form a body
[47:27] around himself and called Adam Adam is
[47:30] read earth you are read earth you've got
[47:34] blood flowing through your body so the
[47:36] earth doesn't have blood water runs
[47:40] through it by you've got earth which is
[47:42] the same earth lacking from this one but
[47:44] you've got blood read it Adam is read
[47:47] earth
[47:47] amen so God rested on the seventh day by
[47:50] dwelling in a man dwelling in a human
[47:52] flesh amen praise God hallelujah
[47:55] now Genesis 1 I'll call it DeLuca's
[47:59] Genesis 2 is the Rhema and Genesis 3 is
[48:04] the cosmos and we explain that so let's
[48:06] quickly read Genesis 3 then we take a
[48:08] seat
[48:09] Genesis 3 chapter 1 Genesis chapter 3
[48:13] verse 1 Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now
[48:22] the serpent was more subtle than any
[48:24] beast of the field which the Lord God
[48:26] had made and he said unto the woman ye
[48:30] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[48:32] tree of the garden amen shall we be
[48:36] seated
[48:38] praise God hallelujah so now the topic
[48:42] is the movie I was part of a few movies
[48:45] it's not a word you won't find it in the
[48:47] dictionaries
[48:48] I made it up amen spoiled Co means God
[48:53] and a Greek word a morpheme is changing
[48:56] morphology to change to translate from
[48:59] one form to another so I put his true
[49:01] with you miss Elohim attend I got or
[49:05] it's a now feel funny I'll go into that
[49:08] then Murphy changing his attribute or
[49:10] expanding his territory amen
[49:13] so Theo Murphy T H yo mo r p hy few more
[49:20] feet draw a bigger circle of laughs amen
[49:24] so now God wanted to draw a span himself
[49:27] he wanted to bring more territory to
[49:29] himself we know that before the
[49:30] foundation of the world we were in
[49:32] Christ we're not in Christ like our
[49:34] children isn't us amen
[49:36] maybe my brother have children in him I
[49:38] have to renew me but you can't see my
[49:39] children right but now God children were
[49:42] not in that form gasps children were
[49:44] real they were in manifestation not of
[49:48] the terrestrial but when the celestial
[49:50] dimension amen
[49:51] so the Bible said that when Drew was
[49:53] going through afflictions and he forgot
[49:55] who he was he was crying and weeping and
[49:57] mourning the loss a Jew where were you
[49:59] when the sons and daughters of God
[50:01] shouted for joy they scream the victory
[50:04] jube was in Christ before the foundation
[50:06] of the world he had a celestial body
[50:08] caught few few few funny earth you'd
[50:11] call it a locust College the wet body
[50:14] call it a celestial body is the same
[50:16] thing
[50:17] amen but then jube forgot himself
[50:19] because God put us in this lower part of
[50:22] the earth to bring an attributes of
[50:24] redemption so if everything is perfect
[50:26] we're not going to need a redemption so
[50:28] it's part of God's manifestation so that
[50:30] we go through trials affliction so that
[50:32] the attributes in you will come out amen
[50:35] so Joe forgot himself and the Lord
[50:37] reminded him that you were part of me
[50:39] you a manifestation you were real you
[50:41] are not just a thought the thought of
[50:43] God is real so the thought of God is not
[50:46] like our thinking you think about a
[50:48] blueprint I'm gonna go to house do it
[50:50] this form two bedroom five bedroom no
[50:52] gas storage the house is already there
[50:54] amen
[50:55] so before you became flesh you were
[50:59] already I feel funny
[51:00] amen you were already in the Silesia you
[51:03] have the same brother Salim on December
[51:04] the Salamone but now in order to
[51:06] manifest here the Lord had to break
[51:08] himself down a man just like lectricity
[51:11] you can't go and plug your electricity
[51:12] one day on under under under station
[51:15] with a thousands of volts is going to
[51:17] Fred I mean a cuckoo Amen you get big
[51:21] good fried and everything else I can
[51:24] talk about but then when we step it down
[51:27] to maybe 110 volt or 220 volt in UK you
[51:30] can plug in and what get electricity use
[51:33] it to do stuff that we are doing same
[51:35] thing got a sweetie pie himself down
[51:37] amen so he broke himself into pieces
[51:40] begin to break himself into pieces
[51:42] getting lower and lower so that he could
[51:44] manifest so he formed a shadow of
[51:46] himself that we see called a human flesh
[51:48] amen
[51:49] so that shadow is God becoming as press
[51:53] in the 8th God expanding his territory
[51:56] amen one God created the universe he
[51:59] created the angels first they were
[52:01] worshipping him but I was not enough for
[52:03] God that made him God God means object
[52:06] of worship but it was a redeemer
[52:08] so he had to keep on breaking himself
[52:10] and expanding drawing a biggest like
[52:12] circle of love amen so all that is going
[52:15] on is the love of Christ the redemption
[52:17] coveri the Prophet is saying that songs
[52:20] going on is God expanding himself in a
[52:23] bigger territory now what he talked
[52:25] about the logos the logos is the word
[52:28] body the logos is Christ the logos is
[52:32] Elohim in fact before he became the wet
[52:34] body he was Elohim the Jewish or Hebrew
[52:37] word for the soft assistant one is
[52:40] called Elohim lla Elohim the one who is
[52:43] by himself with all the attributes in
[52:45] him all his sons and daughters in the
[52:47] celestial body so Elohim means God in
[52:50] the celestial body amen
[52:52] but any had an attribute of the Torah as
[52:55] well so he has to do certain things to
[52:58] bring himself down and express that
[52:59] Oratia
[53:00] so he begin to move himself in the logos
[53:02] the logos is called a wet body that was
[53:05] what brother Michael was way before the
[53:07] foundation of the world
[53:08] amen that's what's the status we where
[53:11] we before the foundation of the world
[53:13] and that is what you are all the time
[53:15] Amen that's Alicia baddha konasana
[53:19] that's Alicia but it doesn't no no
[53:22] defeats that Sailaja body is not afraid
[53:25] of demons the celestial body has no
[53:28] limitation when you go to sleep the /aa
[53:31] body doesn't sleep he's an angel he's
[53:35] all-powerful his antenna he has no
[53:38] beginning and he has no end amen and
[53:41] that is who you are
[53:42] amen we don't tell this thing's to
[53:44] swallow your mind but is the truth of
[53:46] the word of God that you are not just a
[53:49] flesh limited to this piece of meat by
[53:52] your antenna on the inside Amen so when
[53:55] a situation arise that this guy cannot
[53:57] hold it or this lady cannot hold it then
[54:00] the guy on the inside
[54:01] come out and take off situations amen
[54:04] glory hallelujah and that is the sons
[54:07] and daughters of God amen
[54:09] that is Christ that is a true you amen
[54:12] so all that God is trying to do is get
[54:14] to know for to help us to know who we
[54:17] are
[54:18] take a baby in the womb when the baby is
[54:20] in the womb he or she doesn't know
[54:22] what's going on but the mother knows
[54:24] what is going on
[54:26] amen the mother knows when the baby is
[54:28] kicking the kitchen hay and stuff like
[54:30] that the father knows that I need to
[54:31] bring this vitamin I need to make money
[54:33] to bring this food to provide this new
[54:35] trends to provide a right atmosphere for
[54:37] my wife and my baby to bone right so
[54:39] when you didn't know who you were that
[54:42] feel funny knew you amen when you didn't
[54:45] know who you were walking in sin you
[54:47] didn't even know you you did not think
[54:49] about Christianity you didn't know you
[54:51] have a father you didn't know you came
[54:53] from God you didn't know you are Christ
[54:54] you didn't know you are a tenor the
[54:57] tenor person the true you knew you amen
[55:01] when you had contamination that never
[55:03] condemned you to light you taught like
[55:05] I'm on my way to hell I'm already in
[55:07] hell when you on drugs when there was no
[55:09] hope for you when you were put in there
[55:12] it would put you at array they don't
[55:14] count you among people because you were
[55:16] useless he that is in you knew you amen
[55:21] before even you think about the Holy
[55:23] Ghost baptism to receive the Holy Ghost
[55:25] he was already there amen
[55:27] remember that's what I was saying he was
[55:30] there all that time he was there time so
[55:35] the Holy Ghost is just for you to make
[55:37] you to know that he was there all the
[55:38] time and you preach on three walls so
[55:41] you give him the free wall to marry you
[55:43] he comfort kill the old man the old
[55:46] devil they also the older sittin Lucifer
[55:50] then he took on true Italy preeminence
[55:52] in you and that bring you toward all the
[55:54] things that you lost all the things that
[55:57] you didn't know I mean easier you didn't
[56:00] know you came from God you never had
[56:02] that word on so you came to read just
[56:04] Shh
[56:05] until you somebody brought you to the
[56:07] church until you read the Bible on till
[56:10] you read William Rams message until you
[56:11] read a mystery so for then you got to
[56:13] know that in I came from God so I'm not
[56:16] a drug addict so begin to throw away the
[56:19] Monisha I came from God I'm not a
[56:21] prostitute
[56:22] I'm not a criminal it doesn't matter my
[56:24] criminal records that is not me
[56:27] you funny doesn't have criminal records
[56:29] Amen few funny doesn't have depth amen
[56:33] it doesn't matter how much you owe in
[56:35] the few funny doesn't own nothin not
[56:37] even a penny
[56:37] Amen because he's eaten ah he owes
[56:40] everything on this earth amen glory
[56:43] hallelujah now that is a few funny
[56:47] Elohim wanted to manifest himself so he
[56:49] created to begin to form himself but
[56:51] Brahm said the word the Greek word is
[56:52] kenosis
[56:53] kenosis like god vomiting himself up it
[56:58] doesn't mean like he's vomiting God is
[57:00] there that is where tuna tuna Tyrian get
[57:02] off the way they look at the Bible said
[57:04] that Jesus went to the father sat at the
[57:07] right hand of God right so in a human
[57:09] imagination the father is a big Almighty
[57:12] God here
[57:13] Jesus Christ is not a right right side
[57:15] here and the holy spirit like a dove no
[57:17] it's just one person
[57:18] Oh is right the Lord your God is one and
[57:21] we are supernatural is right we have
[57:24] only one God amen
[57:25] we don't have two guys one sitting in
[57:27] heaven one living in you wondering we
[57:29] are caused in the same Elohim
[57:31] manifesting himself amen
[57:33] so kenosis or God am orphan himself
[57:35] means he's changing his attributes just
[57:38] like you are dressed up for church when
[57:41] you get back to the sisters get back to
[57:43] home they change into the I want into
[57:45] the into their kitchen cloth to cook
[57:47] some food put on aprons right in the
[57:51] same sisters in the same system and
[57:53] establish our sister Tonya the same
[57:56] person he just only changed her dress
[57:58] from church clothes to kitchen clothes
[58:01] because she want to cook for her
[58:02] children and her family it's not a
[58:05] different person who jump into the
[58:07] clothes amen
[58:08] that's why I was the last people I Jack
[58:10] was preaching the preacher on a second
[58:11] Corinthians 5 when this earthly
[58:14] tabernacle is what is broken and
[58:15] dissolve is done away with you have
[58:18] another Tabernacle eternal in the
[58:20] heavens
[58:21] not made by man and women no not made in
[58:24] sin but it's eternal
[58:26] isn't it in the dimension right here and
[58:28] when this one is finished when it's
[58:30] closed when I finish my preaching and go
[58:32] home I just take this one and put in
[58:34] some way I'm not dead the robot I cook
[58:37] whistle on the inside the same thing
[58:39] that will feel funny the Holy Ghost the
[58:41] Christ in you he cannot die that's right
[58:44] Christians do not die because Christians
[58:48] are Christ they are not trying to be
[58:51] Christ but the Christ the did he made
[58:54] himself Christ Christ made them Christ
[58:57] amen Christ manifest in them so that was
[59:00] the the logos God bringing himself down
[59:03] from the selicia dimension and by the
[59:06] way / a dimension doesn't mean is in the
[59:07] planet is on top of Jupiter or moon no
[59:10] it's right here but it's a more faster
[59:13] dimension it's a more stronger dimension
[59:16] what is the strongest force on the
[59:17] planet love the love of Christ
[59:23] the strongest force is not hatred no the
[59:27] strongest force is not a u.s. army or
[59:29] their Russia bombs the strongest force
[59:32] is the love of Christ I don't want to
[59:36] divide but one time William Brown was
[59:37] walking in I think Siberia Finland some
[59:40] way and Russian soldiers and civilians
[59:42] suggest some of them they don't agree
[59:44] and they were fighting against each
[59:45] other and this man the whole ego see him
[59:47] walk around and he just put something to
[59:50] them and suggest we're at enemy put
[59:52] their arms around each other crying and
[59:54] singing or amazing bliss only belief
[59:57] what made a difference he didn't use
[59:59] weapon to third and I hate you guys
[1:00:01] should get together but somebody past
[1:00:03] there who was still funny
[1:00:04] who was Christ in him and a Christ in
[1:00:07] him influence the students were battling
[1:00:09] who didn't agree with each other he went
[1:00:11] to South Africa there were tribes who
[1:00:13] didn't agree with each other and now
[1:00:15] this tribe began to sink
[1:00:17] I don't know I think he's only believed
[1:00:18] on the streets when they saw the love of
[1:00:20] God healed thousands of people hospitals
[1:00:23] were emptied all the doctors lost a
[1:00:25] patient
[1:00:26] everybody's what they went home and the
[1:00:28] to to the street singing only belief all
[1:00:31] things are possible so the strongest
[1:00:33] laugh is the love of Christ in you amen
[1:00:37] is the love of Christ that causes the
[1:00:38] star to go m34 brought a prayer request
[1:00:41] when a friend or something like that had
[1:00:44] resisted for cancer and people pre the
[1:00:46] city where the one who had seed for
[1:00:48] cancer when if you want to if one got to
[1:00:51] hear your prayer put yourself in the
[1:00:53] passage shoe put yourself that you are
[1:00:57] the one who has got stood for cancer and
[1:00:58] your life you go to least three six or
[1:01:01] seven months you leave and when you pray
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost in you cannot risk the
[1:01:05] Holy Ghost you come out and do the
[1:01:07] supernatural amen that is the love of
[1:01:11] God drawing a bigger psych circle of
[1:01:13] love amen
[1:01:15] spanning your territory amen not that
[1:01:17] about me I and mine but it's about my
[1:01:20] brother my sister and even my enemy MA
[1:01:24] Krystal's we don't have enemies somebody
[1:01:26] can hit you don't have any enemy my
[1:01:29] enemies myself the West enemies not
[1:01:30] since I know the worst enemy of mine is
[1:01:33] not the one who want to kill me by the
[1:01:34] West enemies myself if I do have one
[1:01:36] so if Christ can't catch me I don't have
[1:01:38] no enemy praise God hallelujah
[1:01:42] if Christ can catch me me is my enemy
[1:01:45] and if I'm conquered and I'm no longer
[1:01:47] my enemy
[1:01:48] I'm Christ so don't don't worry about
[1:01:51] somebody else let Christ take on true
[1:01:54] let him eat the control tower and you
[1:01:56] won't have no enemy the love of God will
[1:01:58] radiate from your heart amen so the
[1:02:01] locust is the way it is that few funny
[1:02:04] is the body of Christ when God begin to
[1:02:06] move himself into this earthly dimension
[1:02:09] yes the locust was not of the earth it's
[1:02:12] a celestial body is the pillar of fire
[1:02:14] is the lake of fire is the Holy Ghost we
[1:02:17] got different attributes and different
[1:02:19] names
[1:02:19] when is he brother Solomon we call it
[1:02:21] the Holy Ghost before he had the Holy
[1:02:24] Ghost he didn't he didn't know who he
[1:02:27] was so he has to quicken him so it was
[1:02:31] called the quickening power it's not a
[1:02:34] different person quickening means
[1:02:36] bringing to brother solomon's might
[1:02:37] bring it to my mind who I was before the
[1:02:40] foundation of the world before I was
[1:02:42] born through sin by my dad and mom Paul
[1:02:45] and Victoria I was feel funny I was
[1:02:49] Atena I was the lump of God
[1:02:52] I was Jesus Christ but for the sake of
[1:02:54] redemption has to come to the attribute
[1:02:56] of my dad and mom to be born in sin but
[1:02:59] when you are born again you change
[1:03:01] parents amen amen
[1:03:06] your father became the pillar of fire
[1:03:08] and your mother is the New Jerusalem the
[1:03:11] New Jerusalem the mother of us all both
[1:03:14] your dad and your mom is Jesus Christ
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] glory hallelujah we still have our
[1:03:20] parents we love them but I've got a high
[1:03:22] appearance when my parents are no longer
[1:03:25] on this earth I've got my parents in me
[1:03:27] Jesus Christ the pillar of fire the
[1:03:30] mother my mother in Jerusalem who stood
[1:03:32] me up
[1:03:32] amen glory hallelujah
[1:03:35] who's the appearance when they were
[1:03:36] young but the pillow if I hold them
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ for them the Heavenly
[1:03:40] Father holds you amen
[1:03:42] so now that was Jesus Christ bringing
[1:03:44] himself down now he began to create in
[1:03:47] the web body the logos he wanted to
[1:03:50] dwell in a man now when it was in a man
[1:03:52] he became the Rhema
[1:03:54] the Rhema means the spoken word reminds
[1:03:57] RHD ma when Christ in dwells in a man
[1:04:01] then he moved from the locust locust but
[1:04:04] now the higher attribute is the Rhema
[1:04:06] the God whether was spoken in the
[1:04:09] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:04:11] earth and God created everything buddy
[1:04:12] could you find rest
[1:04:13] God is a spirit what he doesn't work he
[1:04:17] doesn't go to they don't give him pitch
[1:04:18] a quagmire Monday through Friday or
[1:04:20] Saturday do extra hours and they give
[1:04:23] you some paycheck and extra bonuses no
[1:04:25] that is not it as well for nobody
[1:04:27] he said spirit but what race was God
[1:04:29] looking for to rest in a man to create
[1:04:33] this time assistant element to create
[1:04:35] Adam read F to dwell in so that he can
[1:04:38] manifest he can drink water he can smile
[1:04:41] he can laugh he can with his hands he
[1:04:44] could even cry who you can equip our
[1:04:47] children he could pad animals so that
[1:04:49] love was in him so he also draw a bigger
[1:04:52] circle beyond the locus beyond the
[1:04:56] Elohim to become the Rhema the spoken
[1:04:59] word insisting element of flesh amen
[1:05:02] praise God hallelujah let me know the
[1:05:13] time
[1:05:16] so now you lose record of the time oh
[1:05:18] praise God hallelujah the Lord is so
[1:05:21] enough for when the sister was given the
[1:05:24] testimony and after I look at the
[1:05:27] computer at the time was eleven eleven
[1:05:29] eleven is the strongest business of God
[1:05:32] it's a no more standing upright with God
[1:05:35] remember Jesus had 12 disciples but one
[1:05:38] was one of the wicked one the
[1:05:39] leavenworth true discipleship and as
[1:05:42] this one now we are now perfect
[1:05:44] perfectly disciple of Christ standing in
[1:05:47] array in line with the word of the Lord
[1:05:49] Amen god bless you sister for your
[1:05:50] testimony
[1:05:51] amen that is what the church that when
[1:05:57] they came from the Upper Room when the
[1:05:58] key for the Upper Room the sisters the
[1:06:00] brothers is a goddess one in Christ
[1:06:02] there's no Greeks
[1:06:03] there's no Gentiles there's no female
[1:06:05] there's no meal we are all Christ we are
[1:06:08] attended to be awed feel funny so they
[1:06:10] feel funny in brother Salomon but at
[1:06:12] Troy and it's funny Davina can do the
[1:06:16] same thing amen
[1:06:17] the same fee-funded up in their songs in
[1:06:19] sister Michelle and the sister dancing
[1:06:21] here the same Holy Ghost that inspired
[1:06:23] the preacher a simile goes that the
[1:06:26] little children and every son and
[1:06:28] daughter of God if you have the Holy
[1:06:29] Ghost is the same Christ amen and when
[1:06:32] you speak when you free Christ in you
[1:06:35] does the supernatural he does americo's
[1:06:38] glory hallelujah now if you means the
[1:06:43] invisible God God not made flesh he's in
[1:06:47] a celestial Ram funny means the
[1:06:49] invisible Elohim made flesh made earthly
[1:06:53] amen so few more famous few God change
[1:06:56] himself in another attributes moving
[1:06:59] from the silesia form to the tarisha
[1:07:01] form amen God moving from the Almighty
[1:07:04] God who covers all space or the planet
[1:07:07] to dwell in a body called Jesus Christ
[1:07:10] so that he could manifest here in earth
[1:07:12] now
[1:07:14] the supernatural being a morphing
[1:07:15] changing himself in different attribute
[1:07:17] of laughs the logos means thinking
[1:07:21] ordering something into sheep and giving
[1:07:23] it a form so the logos allow God to make
[1:07:26] himself in an earthly form because you
[1:07:28] want to just lightly tricity
[1:07:29] you want to make himself in a usable
[1:07:31] form if their life is this in the work
[1:07:32] station is in that sauce it's not usable
[1:07:35] if you try to use it he's going to break
[1:07:37] into pieces so now these logos is trying
[1:07:39] to break himself down into usable forms
[1:07:42] that you can use it to connect the
[1:07:44] computers the musical instruments and a
[1:07:46] cooking stove and different things so
[1:07:48] Christ's changing means off is the end
[1:07:51] morphine whew
[1:07:52] changing himself in our attributes in
[1:07:54] the sisters in the brothers in musicians
[1:07:56] in the preaches so that he can manifest
[1:07:59] himself expand his business and its
[1:08:01] territory the Laurie hallelujah praise
[1:08:04] be to God now there are this few funny
[1:08:07] means the semester at the Zoe the zoo is
[1:08:09] a Greek we are the well zoo what is rooh
[1:08:12] is where we keep animals right zoo means
[1:08:15] where we have botany life
[1:08:16] now the Zoe means the very life of God
[1:08:19] the very life of God is in you and that
[1:08:22] you cannot die the same way is for Lucas
[1:08:25] the same is the wet body the same is the
[1:08:28] few funny the same is the celestial body
[1:08:30] Spanish call it juice they pick it from
[1:08:33] from the Greek few do the same way the
[1:08:37] Rhema is the smoking weight ll Elohim
[1:08:40] the supernatural man this is dimension a
[1:08:42] person flesh and bone holy spirit the
[1:08:46] spirit man is this is the one you are
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:49] so sometime when the Bible uses
[1:08:50] different terms Giovanni pillar of fire
[1:08:53] a lake of fire is not different things
[1:08:56] together is the same Almighty God is the
[1:08:59] same Christ amen any revelation any
[1:09:02] doctrine that is not centered or doesn't
[1:09:04] bring Christ does not exist forget about
[1:09:07] it it doesn't matter how sweet the sound
[1:09:09] if it's not Jesus Christ if it's not
[1:09:12] Christ it doesn't exist
[1:09:14] amen so it's a just a fairy tales but
[1:09:17] then the logos they feel funny is Christ
[1:09:20] Almighty God in different expression of
[1:09:23] himself when it's my brother we call it
[1:09:25] the Holy Ghost baptism one is judging
[1:09:28] the world when people who are given a
[1:09:30] chance to believe the Word of God they
[1:09:31] forsake the Word of God and then finally
[1:09:33] the Holy Ghost has to annihilate them in
[1:09:36] otherwise it will destroy them the body
[1:09:38] the flesh is the spoken word of God the
[1:09:41] sistine element just
[1:09:42] like asses the element who go back to
[1:09:44] the 8th bernard yeah spirit the wikis
[1:09:46] producted wickedness they never accepted
[1:09:49] christ they didn't repent and they died
[1:09:51] in their sins they finish their life on
[1:09:54] earth they cannot go to the presence of
[1:09:57] of the logos they cannot go to the
[1:09:59] presence of God so what does the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost do it has to terminate their life
[1:10:02] how does he do it come in the form of
[1:10:05] the lake of fire it doesn't mean there's
[1:10:07] a lake somewhere big league somewhere I
[1:10:09] don't know the biggest lake in
[1:10:10] Mississippi or whatever lake then we've
[1:10:13] got big angels and they've got a book
[1:10:15] here they write your name ok you didn't
[1:10:17] do the right thing let's grab him and
[1:10:19] throw him to the lake no that's not that
[1:10:21] is a human imagination lake means
[1:10:24] Guardian super the earthly language to
[1:10:26] explain spiritual things of God just
[1:10:29] like Natura you swim in a lake you wash
[1:10:31] yourself the same thing the lake means
[1:10:33] is the fire of God that's what the
[1:10:35] League of fire what fire not a natural
[1:10:39] fire but a supernatural fire that
[1:10:41] consumes in that consume unbelief that
[1:10:44] consumes eNOS that consume politics that
[1:10:47] consume diseases that consume cancer
[1:10:50] that consume gossip that consume anger
[1:10:53] that consume frustration that comes from
[1:10:55] all evil and set gospel free so if it's
[1:11:00] working on a believer is the lake of
[1:11:02] fire if it's working a non-believer
[1:11:04] sorry if it's working on a believer is
[1:11:06] the pillar of fire if it's working a
[1:11:09] non-believer to consume is called a lake
[1:11:11] of fire
[1:11:11] it is sort of Almighty God amen is the
[1:11:15] same person Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] glory hallelujah it's not a different
[1:11:20] person God is one Elohim is one amen we
[1:11:25] are one people one faith one spirit one
[1:11:29] baptism Amen my brother is no different
[1:11:32] for me my sister is no different from me
[1:11:33] on earth he doesn't look like you he
[1:11:36] looks different it's got different
[1:11:38] parents the one on the inside
[1:11:41] amen that's why the professor a bride
[1:11:46] cannot prescribe right we all want one
[1:11:49] wife of Christ I'm a wife of Christ you
[1:11:51] are the wealth of Christ we are all one
[1:11:53] so I cannot take my hand and break my
[1:11:56] hand I'm killing my own self I cannot
[1:11:58] take my hat in my head and just take a
[1:12:01] machete or something like that and cut
[1:12:02] my head
[1:12:03] I'm destroying myself I cannot pluck my
[1:12:05] eyes out it's me
[1:12:07] amen so my sister my brother is me if I
[1:12:11] if I do something wrong
[1:12:13] I'm destroy my own self that's what the
[1:12:15] Bible said that love your neighbor as
[1:12:18] yourself the greatest commandment is
[1:12:21] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:12:24] with all thy might with all thy strength
[1:12:27] without a substance with everything now
[1:12:30] the Lord Brooke himself a little down
[1:12:32] and he became my sister he became my
[1:12:35] brother he became my little brother's
[1:12:37] here
[1:12:38] he's me how do I appoint him he's my
[1:12:41] friend he's a little preacher so it's me
[1:12:45] if I touch him I'm touching myself but
[1:12:47] it's me so I see much expression as
[1:12:49] passion of me amen so you can love him
[1:12:53] like you are loving yourself if your
[1:12:55] brother doesn't have a coat and you have
[1:12:57] two you can take it and give it to him
[1:12:59] what's the one time there was a soldier
[1:13:01] I think one of the church leaders it was
[1:13:04] it was a French soldier and he was
[1:13:07] walking on the street he saw this poor
[1:13:09] man in freezing nobody just nobody just
[1:13:12] walk around and he was watching if

[1:13:32] whatever you call it and he saw Jesus
[1:13:34] Christ

[1:13:40] brother Michael I'm doing to Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ
[1:13:42] if I do something Sarika into Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ so you laugh when I laugh when we
[1:13:47] project that when it's coming from
[1:13:49] vertical right coming from above from
[1:13:51] God is what we call it a divine laugh

[1:18:47] blood demons were calling for his blood
[1:18:49] crucifying him Herod wanted to release
[1:18:52] him because couldn't find no sin in him
[1:18:54] he was innocent but then you said
[1:18:55] crucifying him who do I give it to you

[1:19:00] no crucify Jesus Christ and they took is
[1:19:04] what Barabbas or whatever the thief and

[1:19:42] wasn't the will of God it was the
[1:19:43] angered a prophet
[1:19:44] and because we've got Christ in you
[1:19:46] somebody can make you mad even your
[1:19:48] children if you tell your child you
[1:19:50] never going to prosper you not amount to
[1:19:52] nothing you are casting your child your
[1:19:55] child can do something it can be a

[1:20:09] count whatever I've done against me but
[1:20:11] the love of Christ in you will bring
[1:20:13] that forgive them father and the loved
[1:20:15] one is projected just like the lady dad

[1:20:41] middle school girl or high school and
[1:20:44] she prayed that's what she does praise

[1:20:55] things so one day she went to bed and
[1:20:57] she was in his jet plane coming down she
[1:21:01] said a simple prayer and the Holy Ghost
[1:21:03] woke up get up I'm free
[1:21:05] so the more she pre she could see the
[1:21:07] plane moving up higher and gaining
[1:21:10] height and gaining altitude
[1:21:12] she didn't assign a dream and so she
[1:21:14] kept praying praying praying praying to

[1:24:50] that is a pretty plane jet plane I mean
[1:24:52] about to crash beginning free and sheep
[1:24:55] read the supernatural happened if you
[1:24:58] take that man on the street a homeless
[1:25:00] person on your way you meet him when
[1:25:02] you're going to work if you look at this
[1:25:03] madness oh don't condemn him or he's
[1:25:05] homeless he's on drugs
[1:25:07] he's wasted his money maybe he was a
[1:25:10] veteran he didn't use his money to feed
[1:25:11] his family now he went on dress and he's
[1:25:13] useless
[1:25:14] but if something touches you just like
[1:25:16] Jesus when he was walking in the Holy
[1:25:18] Ghost who touched him and you look at
[1:25:20] this person any pre God comes in and
[1:25:24] that's a supernatural just like Adam
[1:25:27] brother Jack Jack was preaching some
[1:25:29] time you don't have to pre just the love
[1:25:31] of Christ in your heart that's the does
[1:25:34] daily hence does a miracle was it
[1:25:36] Tuesday we're praying well as Simba
[1:25:37] brought a request regarding his brothers
[1:25:39] pepihuates passport something like that
[1:25:41] before we prayed it was a testimony we
[1:25:44] didn't have to pray it was already
[1:25:45] answered a lot as I did already because
[1:25:48] that before when you ask he knows it
[1:25:51] before you had a desire the Lord knows
[1:25:54] it and in you you have Christ the
[1:25:58] opening patatas in you it's not just for
[1:26:00] me I and mine but it's for sure ever one
[1:26:04] time in San Antonio one sister bought a
[1:26:07] house even a house was a Morocco she
[1:26:09] just desired that the Lord should give a
[1:26:12] house around his sister's house and her
[1:26:14] brother-in-law's house she didn't want
[1:26:15] to live far away she did she didn't
[1:26:17] preach just desired and the Lord in a
[1:26:20] meandering way give exactly what she
[1:26:22] needed so she wanted a believers to go
[1:26:24] and pray at when three and who eat food
[1:26:27] and so forth so we went and we're eating
[1:26:29] food and having fellowship and I'm
[1:26:32] somebody that I can see from behind I
[1:26:34] don't know how I do it but so not be
[1:26:36] walking I can see it's behind me and I
[1:26:38] saw the sister looking at me I mean we
[1:26:41] all fellowship in the house and she's
[1:26:42] looking at me and so I got Ripley's I
[1:26:44] said no I tend to look at a sister and I
[1:26:47] could see spirit of grief eyes were red
[1:26:50] I could see so deep sorrow in heart the
[1:26:55] husband was there eating normally
[1:26:57] but I could see that the sister wasn't
[1:26:58] happy she wasn't eating and deep sorrow
[1:27:01] in a hat so I guess at hey it was a so
[1:27:04] contact I was looking she was looking at
[1:27:06] directly at me she didn't say nothing to
[1:27:08] me I didn't go to pray for her
[1:27:10] I didn't ask her nothin but the Lord
[1:27:13] revealed it to me the problem that she's
[1:27:15] having immigration if live in us for 15
[1:27:18] years or more they live in Texas they
[1:27:20] renew the Alliance's they've got a
[1:27:21] social and everything to wake but now
[1:27:23] Cesar tightens the law that if you want
[1:27:26] to renew your ID you have to bring your

[1:27:43] she was looking at me and that's we
[1:27:44] couldn't have I didn't pray I didn't say
[1:27:46] nothing but in my heart I could feel a
