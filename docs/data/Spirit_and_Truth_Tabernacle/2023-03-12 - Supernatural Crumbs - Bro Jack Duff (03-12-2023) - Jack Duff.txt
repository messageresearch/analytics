us hey man good to have you with us brother Marco God bless you amen the Lord Richard bless you um I I um my wife just sent me a little note there and I wanted to reread this to you all uh this this morning uh God God gave us word and I just began to reflect back on that service that we had when this was was given and uh just a number of things that had happened in that service um I remember um I remember the Lord doing a mighty thing for brother Nehemiah on that day and and I was going to tell your brother Nehemiah the um we have a chair in storage that remembers that day amen the tap the chair testifiers as to what God did on that day and um uh we were just there having service and the lord gave us this word through our sister Rebecca while she was on the on the piano and um just spoke out nobody was expecting it but God spoke to us and says have not I spoken these words to you I am doing a new thing I am doing a new thing my bride just wait on me and and I will do what you have asked me to do uh you don't have to worry for I am he I am here I am he who speaks to you uh right now uh you just say what you need and I will give it to you open your mouth wide and I will feel it that's what I have promised that's what I will give to you open your mouth wide open it wider and wider and wider and I will give it unto you my bride amen just reminded of what the Lord said to us and and we are uh under expectation for him to do exactly what he says amen he's an on-time God it may not come when you want them but he'll be there right on time cause he's an on-time guard yes he is turn with me to Hebrews 11. amen verse 6. I like seeing these young people up front like this uh thank you to our Deacon amen but this is this this reminds me the old time uh how we used to kind of be on that front row now we up here but one day we're gonna be sitting down and let the young people take it and speaking of that the young people did a wonderful service on Friday night we had a wonderful time amen a Special Assistant Abby wrote a song Amen and and sang it for us and you know out of Psalm 37 I believe it was and enjoyed that sister uh Shalom song of song for us and we enjoyed that and then brother Quentin amen spoke to us and Mai did an excellent job man you better watch what you eat yeah he just really really blessed our hearts with with the thought that the lord gave on me man but I was just happy uh uh that we all came and just was was was was just enjoying the presence of the Lord amen on on Friday night so praise Lord I want to encourage us when we when we have the youth services if if even the parents say man and some of the other Saints you might think well that's just for the young people no it's for all of us but what we want to do is encourage our young people I even told uh sister Shalom said we have these Services I want you to be start playing the piano for the for the Youth service right and I might I might I might surprise y'all with a new song leader too for the Youth service amen but I'm getting the I'ma raise these young people up I'ma pull them up praise God uh but I believe God got gifts here in our nips and and we're gonna we're gonna we just gone we're gonna we're gonna make sure that they're nourished in the right environment and uh that God can get the best out of them praise the Lord we're not waiting for God to send no more young people we got enough right here to get started with and all we got to do is just be faithful what we got amen you build it they'll come all right Hebrews 11 and 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him uh also uh just want to go back to a verse over here in First Kings we touched on this uh last time we were speaking on a risk and reward and I use this particular story there in scripture and we'll just touch just a little bit of it uh today but but we want to kind of move into a different direction but here in First Kings 17 verse 14 it says for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meals shall not waste neither show the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord senteth ring upon the Earth let's pray father we come in the precious and awesome name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh we thank you for what has happened thus far in the service uh just appreciate Lord the the the worship the time of worship the the song leading the musicians the specials Lord as they went forth and uh God just feeling the anointing just moving in this place and other people as they entered into the worship now God we come to the most important part of the service and that is the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so Lord speak to us this morning through your word and may we leave strengthened father by the things that we hear and may the Holy Ghost take control over everything felt not just mad thoughts but the thoughts of the people don't let the devil steal their blessing God you got something for all of us so God so help us to focus our attention on what you want to speak to us today and Lord may we leave here knowing that we've been in the presence of almighty God healed the sick uh set free those that are bound and fill with the holy ghost from refill with the Holy Ghost whatever is needed we pray that you would do God in this place and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated Amen in the presence of the Lord um we we want to take a topic amen today Supernatural crumbs amen Supernatural crumbs praise the Lord uh just bear with me as we would just um get through this today I want to go back to a statement that was made by God's Prophet uh we we had our our tape service at home couple weeks ago first first Friday of the month we always do uh our tape service and um and you know I sometimes I'm planning those tapes out either a month even sometimes you know a year in advance and I just I kind of you know as the Lord would lead me I just put okay let's re let's listen to this one let's listen to that one and um and I may not remember what tape I actually uh put there until it shows up on the calendar that okay that's the tape that we're gonna listen to and as we were uh preparing to listen to that tape I was I was like Lord I need you to speak to me uh because of you know just this season of life that I'm in I I need a word from the Lord amen I always need a word from the Lord every day I wake up I need a word from the Lord hey amen when I come to church I still need a word from the Lord so anybody standing here preaching I'm looking to see what is God trying to say to me come on church amen amen I come I always come needy glory to God Amen I come needy this morning Hallelujah so so I was just I was just there and just just uh like Lord I need you to speak to me and brother Brandon made a statement in in that sermon the unchangeable god amen the unchangeable God and and he makes the statement he says now the thing is with the people is the way God Appears he says many times we want to make an idol out of God that's all right we ask God to do something and then he must do it just of the way that we ask it or we'll say he never answered now now we gotta stop right there right because because you know we we have requests that we've put out before the Lord amen and and here's the thing once you put a request out before God you have to release it in God's hands that he can answer it however he wants to look you you you can't pray and ask God to do it and then tell God what to do hello somebody amen if that was the case you might as well do it yourself but since we need God to do it we might as well allow him to be God and to do it in whatever way he desires so whatever your need is this morning just let God be God amen We're not gonna make an idol out of them amen amen we're gonna we're gonna free them up to do whatever he desire to do oh my you know I I um I I I I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll be the first to admit that I try I made an idol out of God I made a night out of God seven years ago I made an idol out of God I'll be the first to admit it and and what what happened was that I told the Lord I say Lord um you know uh I need to I need to I need you to pay off my house so I can go full time in Ministry that's what I told the Lord I need you to pay off my house I want to get out of the dead of my house so I can go full time and minutes and I gave God a reason why I needed him to pay off my house and then what God did is say no I'm gonna have you go full time in Ministry and I'ma still have you making payments on your house and for seven years God has been making payments on my house and see I thought I was smarter than God right but God God had to share show me say no I can show you that I can make a way I can I can provide your needs you don't need it paid off Hallelujah you just need to know how to manage your money right and say no you so you're not no easy way out here but I want you to know that you can trust me with anything now I still believe you're gonna pay off my house after I make some payments but he's just training me in that and see what I had to learn I can't make an idol out of God and and and have him do it a certain way no no God you you just do whatever you want to do my my I Feel Jesus in the house but here the prophet tells us to say we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way we ask it or we'll say he never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God and when we weaken Our Testimony when we do that uh when we do not take him at his word God always answers no one never asked Jesus said ass and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that asks will receive everyone that seeks shall find everyone that knocks it'll be open to them now that's the only way that I've always found it uh that I can get anything from God is to take him at his word and believe it the way he sends it now if we do not take it just the way we think it is we build God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or that's just no good he didn't answers God answers in many ways answers in Peculiar ways times and everything is odd so you don't know how God gonna do things but you just receive it as it comes oh God got purpose for our being here today all right I want to go forward I got a few more things I want to lay down here amen uh just in our foundation this is coming out of the sermon a statue of a perfect man and we're talking about this Faith um this this this this this morning just uh something to encourage our our hearts we read there in the scripture without faith amen it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarded them that diligently seek Him amen God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Hallelujah you got to keep seeking amen don't give up on seeking hallelujah hallelujah hearing this message statue of a perfect man says notice you must be born again it says and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith right that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please God he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a reward of those that diligently seek him a man says uh when you are skeptic of the Bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe him what is sin unbelief there are only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you are possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise but right but first it's got to be Faith let me stay on the foundation for a while it depends on how much Faith you have as to how high you can rise praise the Lord now we're gonna we're gonna make another another comment here on this amen because you can have faith a man sometimes and and don't even realize that you have it but I think sometimes there's circumstances and situations that pull it out of you glory to God Amen we'll talk about that a little bit later but amen here you know here's another thing about about faith hallelujah hallelujah let's go to this this sermon as the eagle stirth up her nest amen look at what he says here Glory says just remember now as I go on record in these tapes I say this with all my heart that if any persons will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has made now now I wanna I wanna I wanna also inject because as we were listening to that sermon the unchangeable god brother Brandon made a statement in there he says that when you look at scripture hallelujah amen and you can look at something and you can see that God might have written this to the children of Israel or God might have written this to this person a god might have said this to that person but he says but if you can take it personally as God God was writing it to you then you'll see God manifest that same thing in your life hallelujah amen I took it personal when I read the script in Jeremiah amen I believe was chapter 32 and God said that he was going to Rejoice over me to do me good and he was going to plant me in Atlanta sure I say that's not just for Israel and they're promising that is from me and I'm receiving that as my own personal promise and if I have the right mental attitude I'm gonna watch that thing come to pass claim every promise is yours as God was writing it specifically to you he says just remember now as I go and record these things I say this to all my heart that if any person will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has made it'll bring it to pass if you could take the right attitude towards what he said it will bring it to pass I've seen a sarcomas cancer lead people by that same thing now maybe you won't be able to receive just receive enough just to deliver you all of a sudden see that means your faith might not rise to a level where you can just get a Deliverance just like that Hallelujah watch he says but I might say uh tonight just because I want to talk to you a moment and say this if you can't receive enough Faith to be healed instantly then you take the adopted baby routes hello somebody if you if you don't have enough Faith to believe that he's a reward of those that diligently seek him you don't have enough Faith to believe that God can do it right now then take the adopted baby route hello somebody he said did you ever hear of adopting a baby he says now if you take a young woman she may she'll maybe a married she and her husband and she's scared that she isn't going to have a baby now how you know she's scared because she talked about different things that she's going through and the doctor told me I'm never listen I never do that don't you ain't got to listen to what a doctor said God is able to change things from the inside if God could change Abraham and Sarah and Sarah at 90 years old can have a child what about you praise God hey the question was asked to Abraham and Sarah and they did not give an answer is anything too hard for the Lord they didn't give an answer but I give an answer today no there is nothing to her for the Lord [Music] she's scared she's talking herself out of having a baby look at this and she's scared she isn't gonna have a baby she wants one and she's so scared she won't have it brother random say she won't it's it's a it's an attitude she don't have the right attitude you got to keep confessing it no matter what glory to God amen amen keep keep saying it keep speaking God's promises over you no matter don't don't look at circumstances don't look at situations don't look at none look at what God Said Hallelujah even when you're going through a sickness in your Bible you gotta look at what God Said whose report are you gonna believe amen the doctor got a report but God also has a report and when I pick up God's report praise God amen amen Lord thy God that healeth all our diseases even the one the doctors don't have a cure for but I'm the Lord thy God hallelujah I'm greater than your doctor I'm greater than your lawyer I'm the Lord thy God the heel of all your diseases [Music] and all encapsulates all Hallelujah [Music] Oh I Feel Jesus in the place amen you have a need that need to be met amen you you got they say you got more need than you got money well be faithful in paying your times an offering because God promised you I'll repute that power for your sake do you stand on the word of God and watch God fulfill his word [Applause] oh I I'm telling you I tell you I tell you Hallelujah we got we talk about a God that that's a supernatural he can take crumbs you ain't got nothing crumbs God can do something with crumbs I want to tell you that the god that we serve he can do more with crumbs and you can do it a million dollars crumbs you down to your last when you're reaching your pocket you feel lit but God can do something with that with it with the lint Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we serve a mighty God amen amen so here he says she won't if she if she's if she has uh uh uh if she's scared that she's not gonna have it then she won't it says um and and she's so scared she won't have it she won't because just like job said the things that I feared the most come upon me but you take that same woman now if there's doctors which they're probably sitting by nurses you take that same woman and let her adopt a baby then she will have one herself now you know and this we got to be careful with this right because what what you know what brother random was was kind of was and I know there was a family that I just met uh out in out in Arizona they uh they couldn't have kids and they adopted this one one young man and next thing you know they had nine you know and and and here's the thing I want you to be careful I'll share this quote but you know um oftentimes we will hear somebody else testimony and then we'll try to make it ours right no that's what God did for them now now here's the thing the same God that moved for them he will move for you right but don't try to steal their testimony let God give you on your own personal testimony Hallelujah I was I was reading and God God put this in my spirit or I was listening to this sermon and God put that let God give you a personal testimony you step out with that it's something about when they become your own personal property here he says it says now if the doctors would say probably uh is sitting here is sitting by nurses you take that same woman let her adopt the baby then she will have one herself see it quietens her right the baby just having a baby in the home it quiet it get her nerves down hallelu nah she's in position her body's in position to be able to receive glory to God Amen she was too worked up before it said but when the adopt the baby you just bring the baby into the environment it does something for you Hallelujah so now if you haven't got enough Faith to receive it right now as a miracle then take the adopted baby attitude lord it's mine because you promised him I will go from here tonight praising you just the same as as I was well right Watch What Happens you receive it it has to happen God promised it so he's the infinite God and if you can feel if you can feel just a little speck of faith that tells you that you'll be all right and believe it just go on thanking him for it so that's the adopt a baby attitude we're gonna thank God and praise God before it even happens hallelujah hallelujah amen we're talking about supernatural crumbs and when we look at uh justice this this word and actually let me uh let me let uh brother brother brother brother Quentin read a scripture on uh Friday night and and I have been thinking about this sermon and then I'm gonna kind of put it to the shelf and then I was sitting here on Friday night brother Quentin came out and read a scripture I said oh I think that that one was for me brother Quinton and uh and I appreciate you reading this without a Luke chapter 16 and let's just read a little portion of it uh Luke 16 and um I'll start at verse 19. this is the story of the the Rich Young Ruler the Bible says the rich man and Lazarus and I love how brother Quentin called it the brother Brandon brought it to us this rich man that we see in scripture uh Luke said Luke 16 he's also spoken of I think in Luke 18 I think Luke 12. I think those are three three scriptures but this this uh he and and portion of scripture it's a prophecy that Jesus is telling in a parable about a rich man that's going to approach and and how he's going to get richer and how different things are going to happen but eventually he's gonna uh lift his eyes in hell right he's going to reject the word he's going to reject Christ and he's going to lift his eyes in hell you know and and and the prophet is told so it's not just these several Richmond it's the same Rich Young Ruler that walked away from Christ hallelujah amen so here you know we see something in verse 19 there was a certain rich man which was clothing purple and fine linen and ferret sumptuously every day he was doing very well for himself and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores now look at this and designed to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his swords and you know as I was just kind of meditating on that and you know uh my we all know the the end of this story uh Lazarus ended up in Abraham's bosom and the rich man ended up in hell we realized that and they had a conversation there in hell where uh the rich man was trying to get Abraham the sin Labs was back to go testify to his brothers to tell him not to come to this place and and all that we get that but I just wanted to kind of focus a little bit on this this man design crumbs uh oh I mean all the rich man wanted was just crumbs and and I just began to think what type of crumbs could these be that this man would just want crumbs Hallelujah crumbs is not enough to feed anybody curls is not enough to satisfy anybody but you know sometimes a man and especially in in in in in in our society we throw a lot more weight than just crumbs hello somebody we we thought we throwing a whole meal away right Hallelujah glory to God Amen even when it come to spiritual things we don't realize what we thrown away we don't realize what we're walking away from we don't realize the the the the the the the sustenance that's in there come on somebody you better watch what you throw away hallelujah amen brother brother Quentin told us on Friday night watch what you eat and also watch what you don't eat because the things you don't eat might actually be the vitamins that you need spiritually but this man was just just Desiring crumbs if I could just get crumbs from this this rich man say what was he throwing away that this man would want to sit at the gate it was enough being thrown away at its man felt that he could sustain himself here's the problem though this rich man amen uh never actually provided any crumbs to Lazarus he never gave him anything and I want to just kind of look at this word crimes because it's uh it's it's the the definition is a small particle or portion of anything it's just a fragment hallelujah it's just a small portion or just a fragment of something it's not it's not much oh my my my my my it's just a little bit it's just a teeny weeny Hallelujah probably something it won't even wet your appetite it's just it's just uh uh uh I mean you'll leave that Desiring more when you just have crumbs right it's just it's a small particle a portion of anything a fragment they said a bit a bit just a little bit and and I thought about a man uh different ones in scripture because you know this this this um this rich man did not share even his crumbs with Lazarus he wouldn't even just share his crumbs with Lazarus maybe if he would have shared his crumbs his uh his destination might have been a little different last is when asking for a lot just give me a chrome just just just give me a little bit of work you fearing sumptuously why don't you just give me just a little bit of what you got Hallelujah somebody amen and I wanna I wanna tell you something I think God also just wants your crumbs sometimes in life life has really shattered us life is life has torn us apart Hallelujah sometimes as young people we give so much to the devil that when we come back to God all we got is crumb but I'm telling you when you put your crumbs in the hands of Jesus he can do something Supernatural with those crumbs he can turn your life around oh God can do more with crumbs then you can do with a million dollars here it is sweet we see this woman amen we picked her up in in First Kings 17. and and I just love her story uh because here in uh let's let's let's capture in verse 11 first king 17 verse 11. amen this woman had got down to her last and can I put it this way she was down to crumbs she was working with cross but she was willing to do something with her crumbs Hallelujah here in first first Kings 17 verse 11 says and as she was going here the prophet was was told to come to her house with Prophet Elijah and as as he gets there to the house uh God didn't tell him this woman was down the crumbs he just said I have I have ordained that this woman will sustain you during this time amen the famine was on glory to God there was no food I mean there was a lack of food there was a lack of rain or no water nothing to sustain the people at this time but here this woman has been ordained by God to sustain a prophet Hallelujah so when the prophet sees they says uh will you mind going to fetch me some water and here the Bible picks up says as she was going to fetch it he called her and said bring me I pray the immortal of bread in thine hand glory to God and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake see I ain't got I I don't have I don't have this whole Morse of bread that you want I don't have that I just got crumbs I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son we gonna share crumbs hallelujah amen that we may eat it and die because what I got in my little Baron what I got left is not enough to really sustain us and after we eat this this is our last meal Prophet we will die after this so let me get to the water but don't I can't give you any bread I ain't got nothing to give you legal ahead said Elijah said unto her fear not oh she needed to hear it fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first so if even if you say that's got crumbs take a piece of the crumb and give it to God can bless your little piece of crumb hallelujah amen it says says uh uh bring it up to me and after and after make Pavilion for thy son but thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall The Crucible until the day that the Lord sinneth rain upon the Earth this lady was willing to give her crumbs as she gave her crumbs to God she got a blessing Beyond imagination God can turn your crumbs into overflow God I ain't got but crumbs I got lit in my Pocket God I got one dollar and I got lent I'm gonna give my dollar and I'ma let God take the linen bless it crumbs see I I think there's many different uh passages of scripture that we could go to to show a man where God is used uh different ones where all they had was just crumbs just just a little a little bit just a little uh uh uh they didn't have much just a small particle a small portion but they brought whatever they had and they gave it to the Lord and he blessed it before I go further Amen to give you some more examples I was just looking amen at this word faith and and different statements that brother Brandon made about faith and I want to just give it to you faith don't reason at all Faith believes it Faith don't reason Faith don't dig and say that's all I got is this well God know what you got and he asks you to give that when you're down the crumbs give God your crumbs it says faith is so simple you don't even know you have it you don't even it's so simple that you don't know you have it I remember example that that brother Wesco used to give all the time and and many of y'all walked in today and you have faith in the chair that you're sitting in you have faith not one of y'all stopped and looked to see if the screws were still inside the chair everybody just put a pillow down and play and just put all your weight down in that chair you didn't even think about it you didn't ask nobody you didn't ask for Deacon or us to say is this channel can't you didn't ask nothing about that you the chair was designed to hold you the chair was made to hold you amen do you have confidence in the designer you had confidence in the person that made it that this chance gonna do exactly what it needs to do for me the word of God is designed to hold y'all the word of God is designed to keep you praise God the word of God will make a way for you put your weight on it drop your weight on the word of God don't ask no questions the reason we're God put your weight on the Promises of God faith is so simple you don't even know you have it it says now real Faith doesn't shift by Creeds and man-made doctrines and unbelief it stays right with the word real faith in the word where you can put your faith on where and where can you put your faith on anything else but the word we've done the statement he says faith has no hindrance there's nothing going to stop it amen and he used the uh the example of the Queen of Sheba and how she was approaching glory to God she she heard about Solomon she heard about the wisdom that was going forth there she's like I got to I just I need to just be in one service I just need to be in one I got to go see what this man is talking about what is happening there's Revival happening there in Israel I need to go see and this woman wrote 90 days on the back of a camel to get there to Solomon she has so many obstacles that she had to overcome amen first is that her her priest told if you if you go to that church we're going to kick you out of this one hallelujah amen she had money that she was carrying glory to God and she had robbed there were robbers on the desert that at any time could Rob anybody and they would have sick everything this lady had by being a woman and and on the on the back of a camera in a desert where she gonna use the restroom huh I mean think about all the hindrances that this lady had but yet she overcame every obstacle Amen to get to the presence of Solomon and when she got there she was willing to give her everything she got she say the haves have not even been told the things that I heard ain't even enough I mean I had to see this for myself Faith knows no hindrances there's nothing going to stop another statement it says When Faith speaks everything else sits down he said that's right that's right when it speaks everything else shuts up Hallelujah brother that's greater than EF Hutton that's bigger than EF hunting When Faith speaks everything shuts up the doctor's report shuts up what the bank said [Applause] we ain't listening to none of that faith is talking right now and we only want to hear what Faith's got to say God let Faith speak glory to God he says faith will always emit the word is truth amen see if you've got real faith in the Bible tells you that you're doing wrong you'll admit that you're wrong another one it says faith don't explain it amen did you did you know that Faith just believes it I like that and he gave an example you know I was just kind of uh actually I think that maybe the Lord inspired me uh no no no no no no no no uh he gave an example on this when he was saying how uh uh Faith don't Faith don't explain it and they gave an example of how Peter was there with Jesus and Jesus come out and preached this remarkable sermon amen and uh he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and when Jesus preached that sermon the whole church was shook everybody start walking out of church that day I told y'all this man was crazy I mean this is it that no more coming to this church to eat his flesh what what does that mean they didn't wait for an explanation they just immediately took to themselves that we leave in church we cannot bring our families back here anymore and Jesus allowed each one to walk right out of the church God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you I mean all the members walked out at one time it was 12 left and he looked at the 12 in Acts 12 and asked them a question will you also go no explanations will you also go I know you just heard the sermon and you saw the response will you also go Peter said these words because Peter had faith Peter said to whom shall we go Peter knew where he had come from the place he come from they didn't they weren't sharing things like that to whom shall we call only you have the words of eternal life amen amen hallelujah faith faith wasn't gonna be shook favor I mean Peter said I saw my cousin go I saw this one go my auntie my uncle I saw them leave too but I'ma stay right here I ain't got nowhere I can go maybe maybe they have a place they can go but I don't have nowhere I can go only you have the words of eternal life and you know that didn't even move Jesus he says okay I got 12 and one of y'all is a devil you imagine this you wanted a 12 you don't know which one of y'all is the devil you could actually be the devil but I reminded of what brother Branham said one time he says he said I love him so much that even if he sent me to Hell after serving him with this life I would still serve him in this life see I'm gonna tell you something Faith Can't Be Moved by nothing and here's the other thing when they say faith does no no no explaining Peter couldn't explain what Jesus just said they have nothing somebody actually not Peter what you think he meant by that I don't know but I ain't going nowhere and see here's the thing about faith faith didn't ask you to understand Faith didn't ask you to explain Faith simply asks you to believe [Music] and here's another one about faith that I love brother Brown say faith makes you little I want y'all to get that one now Faith faith when you really like you little you get down the crumbs all right let's let's read a little bit more here my God my God my God here's one out of uh uh why Christ speak he says this but as Faith led him to take the choice of the word and not the glamor he took the word he's talking about Moses that's what Moses Faith did When Faith looks on God's words when Faith looks on God's words remember here was the glamor now of the world see the highest king of the world and and where was God's promise in the mud hole mud daubers but when Faith When Faith looks at God's words it esteems it Greater and more valuable than the best the world can show can I put it this way when Faith just looks at God's crumbs it's better than anything the devil can offer you amen God's crumbs is better than anything the devil can offer you Hallelujah glory to God he says uh more valid than the best the world can show yes sir when Faith looks at it when faith can see it when faith in the word can see the word may manifest it's more to them than all the glamor and archbishopry and and everything else you can speak of Faith does it you can see the worst the the despised and rejected the whatever it might be let it be at its worst and yet Faith esteemed that a million million miles higher than the best the world can produce amen that's the way that's the that's the way we sing that song I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few see oh man he goes on says for you see faith sees what God's once done oh I hope this goes in faith does look at the present time I'm sorry Faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to see what God wants and works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that faith is a long-range vision and here's a good one it don't lower its sights amen it it holds to the Target amen any good shooter knows that see it's a long range it's a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around here you don't you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is see you don't use that but you use binoculars to look away off and Faith does that Faith picks up God's binoculars see both of them he's talking about the Bible right here these are God's binoculars the Old Testament and the New Testament it says it picks up God's binoculars both of them both sides the New and Old Testament and sees every promise that he made and they've seized it out yonder and they chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here he looks at the end he don't drop his sights down to look this way he looks out yonder he keeps the Crosshair debt send it on the word that's what faith does that's the faith that's in a man that does those things and I'm telling you when we got faith all we look at is what the word says and that's all we can look at is what the word says all I want to hear is what the word says when I'm using my faith I was telling you you know this woman there Amen in First Kings she just gave God just a crumbs and God took a crumbs and and and and did something Supernatural with her crumbs turned the whole thing around I mean here she was down to her last but because she was willing to give her crumbs God said you know what your Barrel ain't gonna go empty your cruise won't run dry all right just because she was willing to give God crumbs sometimes it don't take God much he he can just work with the little that you got if you'll give it completely if you'll give it holy God can do something with it I was thinking on this uh other people that just gave crumbs when you when you read the story of the of the 5 000 that was fed has 5 000 people in actually the Bible says 5 000 men and it wasn't counting the women and the children with two fish and five loaves of bread really all they gave Jesus to work with was crumbs when you're looking at a group that size but it took the crumbs and did something Supernatural with it if I can just encourage you to do one thing just give God what you got sister Michelle used to sing the song what's that you got out of your hand I can use it Hallelujah but you got to be willing to lose it take the little you have gotta make it Grand am else should die and uh more than Supply your need but you got to be willing to give God what you got God all I got is crumbs but here go my crumbs Jesus watch him do something Supernatural with your crumbs if your life is in Chrome crumb condition your life is in Chrome condition just give that to Jesus Lord I done messed up I don't did this I don't did that oh Lord he can use anything you give it to if you just give it all right I got crumbs and that's what he asking for that's what the woman she she's like like I ain't got no I wish I Prophet you came at the wrong time no no I came at the right time I want your crumbs I want you to cross be willing to give crumbs here you know we we you look at the 5000 but it also a couple couple chapters later God did the same thing with four thousand and he had seven loaves of bread and just a few small fishes in the any and he and he took the crumbs and blessed it did something Supernatural with just a small particle he fed four thousand Hallelujah I um I want to say this don't just be willing to give God your crumbs but also be willing to receive from God crumbs don't just be willing to give God your crumbs but we're willing to also receive from God crumbs because God's crumbs are not like your crumbs God's Little will overflow you God's Little will overtake you God's Little you can't even handle Hallelujah Church I'm talking about supernatural crumbs there was a woman that we find in Scripture she was willing to just take crumbs and because she was humble enough to just want the little hey God you got to give me all this and you got to give me all that but just just give me a little bit if you can just give me a little bit I think I'll be all right actually I know I'll be all right if Lazarus sitting at the Gate of the rich man could feel like he could be sustained with crumbs what about us when we're sitting at the feet of Jesus will be sustained by his crumbs oh I'm just I mean it's just so many things you know even even um you go back to scripture there was a uh an Old Testament God told him when you reap the field don't just don't take everything out the field amen just leave a little bit in the corner of the field amen for the poor to get to what he's saying give them just some crumbs hallelujah amen I want to sustain them too so don't don't try to take it off and remember a man when um my when uh when Ruth came into the field Hallelujah glory to God the uh Boaz told a Reaper saying now when you when you're reaping the field say now I don't want her to work too hard it says she don't need to be out there trying to grab nothing but I want you to do something drop a little bit just a little bit drop it on purpose for Ruth Amen Let Ruth pick up some crumbs and these problems will sustain Ruth and Naomi God want to make sure you're sustained in this hour are you willing to just take God's Little are you willing to give God your little as long as you're giving with all your heart this woman we we read about it here in in the Bible and amen Matthew 14 is where I want to go to Matthew 14. Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory I might that might be Matthew 15. I might have something wrong here hold on one second yes Matthew uh 15 verse 21. look at this woman says then Jesus went Vince and departed into the coast of tire and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the sand coast and crowded him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came in but saw him saying send her away for she cries after us now let's let's just kind of get on the scene a little bit here let me just read the next verse before I go to uh uh and I want to step into something says but but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel now um what we see if you if you go back and just kind of read this chapter Jesus was just having this great discussion with the Pharisees and Sadducees they always got questions about the word they not they actually don't have questions where they're really seeking answers oh y'all y'all let me let me just make sure everybody ain't got questions where they seeking seeking these people these people and he was just really in a situation like look I'm just kind of getting tired of oh yeah either y'all gonna believe or not believe and he realized I'm not sent to these Pharisees and Sadducees anyway hey man sorry so he uh he decides to kind of get a little rest and as he's getting rest he goes to the city a man tire and sidon that's just it's two two cities amen Sinai was the first city but it's about 25 miles um apart and and they're like Twin Cities right so so Jesus goes just to kind of get a little rest in this area now these cities are not really cities of Israel They Don't Really belong to Israel I believe they belong to the syrians or something like that but Jesus is going down here and Jesus tells this what I'm saying now I'm only sent to the lost sheep of Israel this woman realized now if you were sent to the Sheep of Israel what you didn't do an entire in sidon why are you over here entire Sinai now now maybe she's saying I might not have been able to come as a gentile into Israel to get what I needed but I found that you came to where I'm at that's right guess what and since you were here he was coming to get rest but since you here I got a request and this lady had faith that was not going to be moved this lady had faith that would not take no for an answer this lady had faith that she would take God for his crumb she makes a statement here and when he when he tells her you know uh I'm not sent you know first first of all let me let me let's just back up a little bit when she says Lord thou son of David in verse 22 Lord thou son of David my daughters grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not and brother random makes a statement that she had no right to call him son of David see only the Jews could lay claims on him as son of David this is why he did not respond because she had no right to call him son of David brother man said he's the son of David to the Jew amen but but but uh but he says call him son of David he said nothing then it just he just mentioned to us say look uh I'm not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel and she like okay okay I got you but you over here entire and sidon you're not in Israel right now you entire sidon and look she said not in her heart she like the same God that moves in Israel is standing here now and tiring Sinai that same God can move for me verse 25 says then came she and worship him saying now see this is here's the thing when I when I said earlier Faith makes you little Faith makes you little watch what this lady had faith faith that would not be moved faith that would not reason faith that would not take no for an answer oh even when Jesus is saying no her faith is still saying yes faith that moves God let me let me let me let me let me let me let me just throw something else at you and I I'm not going to read all this there's a statement brother saying do you know God does things sometimes just to do things a different way just to find out what people will do that's right hey let me God will do things sometimes just to see what you're going to do so he he responded to this lady in such he made this comment to her right about I'm sent to the lost sheep of Israel he did that just to see what her response was going to be and then he kept going deeper Watch What Happens in verse 25 then came she and worship him saying Lord help me now when she called him son of David she had no right to calm that being a gentile but when she said Lord help me the thing changed and I like this because brother Quinton brought it to attention Some People Want Jesus to be their savior but they don't want him to be Lord savior means he just keeps saving you from your sin and from your troubles but Lord means he's your ruler I want him to be my savior and I want him to be my Lord she said Lord help me verse 26 he does something now but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs now now see here's another one he's doing the shake of Faith but see when you really got faith no matter what anybody say [Music] that's right God will do things intentionally to shake your faith but he's trying to see if his real true Faith because if it's true Faith then what God does intentionally will still not shaken I'm talking about God will do something intentionally try to shake it but you gotta hold the target brother Ramsey you got that crosshairs I mean you I got a line on the target ready to pull the trigger God ain't gonna let this thing go look I I can you gotta get on the scene let's say that you entire inside you came to me I didn't come to you you came over here and and the same testimony said I heard about you over there I know you're here to get rest but I have a need and I realized the only person Hallelujah that can change what's going on in my life it's you my doctor can't do it my my pastor can't do it my Deacon can't do it nobody can do it but Jesus I might be approaching you wrong I'm calling your son of David and I'm not not getting any response you ignore me but Lord [Music] Lord have mercy on me see you got to have the right attitude when you're approaching him lord lord lord lord lord lord Lord have mercy then he tells her the shake of faith it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs really he's just saying your people are dogs now that was that was enough for this lady to get upset with and and and uh now you know here I'm I'm coming to you and I'm begging you and at this moment you call me a dog uh now that's a little bit too much because you know she didn't have this this version the you know she ain't like the sisters today who you think you talking to I ain't gotta take that Faith makes you little [Music] you know it's reason reason you may be taking that because God is testing you we act like we bigger than Jesus Jesus was spit on nailed to a cross called the devil I mean he was criticized I mean he went through all kind of stuff and he did it without complaining and we can't take nothing but this woman her faith would not be moved look at this one she just got caught a dog watch a response not not not not get up and leave the meeting not not oh I can't believe he said that not not go to Facebook not go to social media and post what you know what Jesus said he called me a dog this is the loving Jesus no that's not her that's not the way she handled things look at what she said she said she said truth Lord see Faith always acknowledges that the word is right so she said truth Lord amen says uh yet the dogs you telling the truth Jesus but yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table see she's saying look I'm I I'm here just to get crumbs if you just give me a Crump a chroma take care of my situation amen one of God's crumbs is greater than anything you can ask for be willing to take a crumb can you this crumb brought a change in her house this crumb brought Deliverance to her daughter but I want to tell you was more than just the crumb it was her attitude in receiving the crumb even dogs can eat crumbs as they fall from the master State we're not eating at the table your dog shouldn't be eating at no table we're not eating at the table but we do hang up because just in case a crown and if you got a dog you could have just fed that dog in his bowl and then sit there eating this bowl but he see you eating and it's all kind of he don't bother you while you're eating he just hang around because he he got he got this stuff this this sense they didn't know something I don't care how good you are with a fork and your knife somehow things begin to creep out they fall off your plate somehow and the dog is sitting there just waiting because soon as something fall to the ground that dog is all over it you don't even get a chance to pick it up the dog the dog and and there's something about the dog hanging around the table he knows good food falling off the table and I just hang around where I know the blessings are flowing brother if I see you being blessed I'm Gonna Get Next To You imma hang out next and since I see you again imma stand and talk to you a little bit because if I could just get a crumb I ain't jealous about what God is doing in your life if I could just get a chrome I'm gonna fall off towards me one crumb can change my Outlook one crumb can change my whole situation one crumb can bring healing to my body I've been suffering for years but I got a crumb even the dogs even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered see he wasn't talking at first but Faith moved them then Jesus answered and said to her oh what man great is thy faith and since you got so much Faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour let me just read you something her daughters make whole because of This Woman's faith and not only just because because she was willing to endure every criticism she was willing to even endure rejection from Jesus no I can't I'm sorry I I understand I approach it the wrong way I said it the wrong way Lord I call you son of David but now let me Lord Lord Lord let me let me approach it the right way help me I I know I know I don't heard all the testimonies happening in Israel and ain't nothing happened down here in time I wish I could be in Israel but since you came to me and they told me you was here trying to get some rest I'm sorry to interrupt your rest since you here in my city I'ma need a crumb I'm gonna need a crow let's look at something oh my just a couple couple more quotes here I'm going back to as the eagle stir uh up her nest says you have to come with the right kind of approach to God if you come selfish if you come in any other approach but the right mental attitude towards God or any Divine gift you'll never receive any benefits from it this is the second little uh thing I got on on that as an eagle stirth and that's says um uh you'll never receive any benefits from it you've got to come with your surrendered all to God look at the sir Phoenician woman when she was told by Jesus it's not right for me to take the children's bread and feed you dogs what would you have what would you have said if he have called you a dog you'd have said I would join the next church but not her she knew who she was talking to she said Lord that's right you're so right in that but the dogs is willing to eat the scraps under the master's table that got him says that got him my uh it says that was it that's what he was waiting for you to do humble yourself into such a place no matter how God sends it to you see don't make an idol out of God no matter how God sends it to you if you're healed instantly if you're healed by degrees that means over time is if you're if you're put off like Abraham was 25 years waiting for the promise but instead of getting weak he got stronger all the time giving praise to God just so that you know that God promised it and you accept it for yourself it's got to come to pass I believe that see when you're going through a trial don't let your faith get weaker let it get stronger I want to go to questions and answers on the Holy Ghost couple statements here brother Brandon makes I just I just love this you got to be willing to give crumbs you got to be willing to receive crops when then when they're in the hands of God they become Supernatural crumbs Hallelujah he says I want you to remember this and I'll try to get over get uh go over it in the morning again Gentiles the gospel that's given to them is a Faith gospel it says not a works at all like I said last night when the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost when they went down to the Jews Acts 19 5 they had to lay hands on them that they receive it and when they went down to the Samaritans they had to lay hands on them but when they come to the Gentiles at Cornelius house while Peter spanked these words no laying of hands the Holy Ghost feeling them as Peter spoke the word see this is the difference in Gentile Faith amen and what the Jewish the Jewish faith Gentile faith is speak the word only yes sir Hallelujah Watch What Happens here he goes on and says when the little girl died jairus's daughter the preset come lay hands on her and she will live but when the Roman Centurion the Gentiles said I'm not worried that you come under my roof speak the word that's it see the sir Phoenician Woman Greek actually what she was when Jesus said to her it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and to give it to dogs she said that's true Lord but the dogs under the table eats the children's crumbs he said for this thing now you if you pick if we would have picked it up in March 7 you'll see he made that statement we're talking about the same story for this saying let me just tell you something you got to say the right thing when she said even the dogs can get crumbs from the master's table Jesus said for this saying go find your daughter mate hole if you say the right thing if you say the right thing you can get a blessing for this saying look at look at this uh he gonna go on he says um uh he says uh the uh but the dogs eat the dogs under the table eat the children's Children's crumbs he said for this thing the devil's left your daughter say good things then say something good about somebody talk about Jesus say something loyal something real that's the way to get rid of devils Hallelujah he never said he never prayed for the girl you talk about this this woman daughter to come she acts she asks I need you to come do some brother Branham say Jesus never prayed for the door the girl her action her attitude her response is what actually produced The Healing I don't know if we get that it wasn't even Jesus prayer it was the latest attitude it was the latest action it was the latest response that got her answer to prayer Jesus actually did not amen pray for her daughter the way she wanted but Jesus gave her the answer that got it already that she really wanted from God your daughter is already healed and you want to know how because of your faith we got to have the right attitude he never prayed for the girl he never said one thing about her being healed he just said for this saying for the sake he says had it right the other day she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing which pleased the Holy Spirit mama just inject that real quick we all know the story but some may not know it but brother Brandon went to Hattie Wright's house one time just sharing testimonies and as is there sharing testimonies about how God had given him this ability uh God had quickened the scripture if you say to the mountain be thy removed be thou cast into the sea don't down in your heart you can have what you say he says do you believe that God began to speak to him do you believe he said yeah I believe him it says well uh he says but I just been afraid to preach it because I don't really understand it he said he says well uh what you out here hunting for I'm hunting for squirrels he says well why don't you speak to where the squirrel is going to be and now how many squirrels you want says I want three well speak where they're going to be and I'll I'll give you those squirrels he said what I ain't never had nothing he says okay I'm gonna say something crazy I want the squirrel to do this do this do this jump out on this limb and I'm going to shoot it right there squirrel come out of nowhere everything he said he shot it knocked the first one down say where the next one will come second would come he said I want to do this do that and I'm shooting over there it did exactly shot it knocked it down and he got to the point he said my God that spoken word creation squirrels come out of nowhere I don't think that's that's crazy because a lamb a ram came out of nowhere for Abraham Abraham actually spoke it Abraham said the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice and that scripture had a dual meaning because it was Christ coming himself as well as God provided a sacrifice for Abraham spoken word brother random got the two squirrels and he was on his way home and again got him packed him give him relief God said no no no don't go nowhere how many did you ask for three speak it again and sit here and when you speak it here it is now here's the other part when you speak it wait on it just wait on it and he sat down he waited here come that third squirrel doing exactly what he's saying shot it God gave him three squirrels and God did it twice in his life he went to Hattie Wright's house and he knew people wouldn't believe that just this is just crazy people ain't gonna believe what I'm just testing on and I'm just sharing but this book and word creation I don't believe and as as he was sharing sharing it had it right was there she was a poor woman just giving a few dollars actually let me put it this way had it right at just giving crumbs to the building fine she had a very a small amount that she reached in and got her crumbs and she brought that to God the Lord I want to give you my crumbs and he and when she gave the crumbs she was not even expecting anything back went on home about her business but here come brother Branham I think he took that money and said I got to give this back to this lady I can't let her and then the Holy Spirit comes with that I stop the woman when I was on Earth that I stopped the woman that came everybody else was dropping their money in the bucket but I let a lady come and give crumbs two peonies I did that for a reason I didn't stop her had it right gave her best because I had something better for her brother random went to the house sharing his testimony and he said I can't give it back the money so I just sit here and eat and fellowship and and as they're sitting there eating and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost came into the room and and had it right had it right uh when she heard the testimony about the squirrels being created she said that's nothing but the truth now I'm gonna say something to y'all Hattie Wright had to open up her mouth can I say it like this had it right was not sitting in her house just nodding her head [Music] and inside she's saying amen [Music] but God needed to hear it God needed something to come out from the inside if it's the word then say Amen to the word and Hattie Wright said amen that's nothing but the truth and when when when Hetty Wright said that the whole atmosphere changed a brother man I'm saying I mean the Holy Spirit came to say now tell her whatever she asked for right now she can have and if she don't get it right now tell her you're a false prophet had it right look and say what I wasn't expecting that had had you ain't got no money you want money actual money Hattie you want you want your mama and dad is sick they old and old and and and and and Pharrell asks for the hell your sister been sick in a wheelchair for years all her life asked for her healing right now honey if you don't get it right now I guarantee you I'm a false prophet and with this Supernatural anointing and the lady had given crumbs she looked around the room and and she said brother Brandon what should I ask for say I can't tell you but I can tell you got all this I don't know what the and brother Branham left out one thing had it right looked around the room underneath the supernatural anointing one man's face is inside the plate can you imagine that most of y'all know y'all ain't trying to get your face dirty with food but this man's face is in a plate the noise is so great didn't care what he looked like might be walking out with spaghetti all over his face but it'll be a testimony behind that spaghetti I'm gonna be I'm gonna be telling somebody about this you want to know why I got spaghetti on my face why is she sitting underneath this this super anointing an anointing where whatever you say right now you can have Hallelujah Jesus Hattie Wright looked around she stabbed two sons that were not Christians and they were just sitting there giggling and playing in the anointing I love it because Mama's desire was greater than those boys and just by Mama making a request my mama said I want the salvation of my two boys see Hattie asked for something eternal and God right there on the spot change those boys all right they wanted to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they want to take communion at the church amen they want to serve God Hattie Wright gave crumbs God gave her a double portion that's my timer it's telling me I got to stop now let me see if I can turn this okay there we go just give God your crumbs watch what God does with it Lord my children their life all messed up their life is crumbs but God if you can just do something with the crumbs and God I'm gonna tell you what I'm I'ma stop begging you for all these big things I know I'm supposed to ask you for big things but if you happen I'm not I'm not gonna make an idol out of you if you just give me a crop that crumb would be more than enough to satisfy my need y ass how do you ask anything that you will whatever you got and you won't find out whether this is real or not ask anything the healing of a little crippled sister sitting there all brought up ten thousand dollars to keep her from digging on the heels over there the youth restored to her well run down body whatever you want asked you ask it right now if it don't come and give it to you right now I'm then I'm a false prophet that's something isn't it Jesus said say to this mountain you've heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry that we're entering into we're way up the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we've got to have Rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go watch this but don't worry it'll be there that's a promise from God that faith that we're looking for to change our bodies sometimes we look Lord Amy I don't I don't even feel like I got faith you got it you use it every day even when you go out and crank your car you you going out there with it with a key in your hand and you're gonna stick it in in that car or you're gonna push a button just by having your key close to the car you're gonna push a button you expect it to start you're gonna expect to put it in in Reverse so put it in dry you expect that you don't you're not you don't even think no consciously you don't even think about it that's where you got to be with God's promises don't worry it'll be there it'll be there and when the power of this church Rises it'll bring its Brethren the power of that church Rises will bring its Brethren the power of that church will bring the other Brethren then there'll be a general resurrection and we're looking forward to it I'm so glad I'm so glad that this faith that this woman displayed is the same Faith that's lying inside of all of us today don't you be moved by nothing the devil does don't you be moved by nothing a doctor says only be moved by What God Says Supernatural cross God bless you [Applause] let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word Lord and um we can receive right now whatever it is we need we can have it right now Lord I I just in the story Jesus he never prayed for this woman and I had some other quotes here to show her even that happened in brother Banner's Ministry people pass through the prayer line and uh they would never actually be prayed for he would just tell them this is what you came here for this is what you're looking for the the Holy Spirit Will discern what was happening in their life and they say you know go find it the way you believe it God bless you never lay hands on them never prayed for them it's just it was proven that that same God that that was in Bible times was here today and Lord I believe even right now Lord whatever the needs are here if there's any sick in our midst they can receive Lord this Supernatural crimes mine from the word of God that it would bring healing to their bodies as the uh Centurion he says just speak the word only my servant will be made oh the word has been spoken all we have to do is receive it God I pray father that you would help us to walk in this and Lord many of us have situations that are broken circumstances that are maybe in crumb conditions finances that are in crumb conditions our bodies and crumb conditions our relationships and crumb conditions but Lord we
