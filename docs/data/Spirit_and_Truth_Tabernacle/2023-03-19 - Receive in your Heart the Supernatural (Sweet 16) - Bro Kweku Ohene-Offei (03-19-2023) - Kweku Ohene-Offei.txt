friend unto our Lord blessed be the name of the Lord amen shall we take our seed our lord is good we want to welcome sister Tatiana and the family brother Israel sister Victoria and brother Samuel I invited him that I was praying last night and they came upon I had to invite him because I'm going to speak something for the Youth and I invited my sister and he said yes we're gonna be there and they were here eight o'clock way before the time so God blesses that Titanic family and every every invited guest we welcome you the Lord bless you and be comfortable amen we are just a family of Christ and we pray the Lord is using Brother Jack in Atlanta to bless the name of the Lord amen so if you can have my slide and let's go to the slide we want to speak on something that I spoke on I think December December the 4th the first part was believe into your heart this the supernatural that was fourth December 20 20 22 and want to take a second part of the same anointing and going the same direction receive in your heart the Supernatural and we just added something little that you understand little sweet 16. or I am sweet 16 amen and you understand that in the course of time you know me already those who are here that brother Goku is a weird guy he's got a weird name he speaks weird things but he's going to bless your heart amen so the Lord bless you amen Glory Hallelujah and we want to dedicate this sermon to the young people they are the chosen generation of the Living God God always bring people on Earth men and women not only men prophet prophetess a prophet is anyone who has got Christ in him Prophet is a Seer is a mouthpiece of God of course we have got major prophet that are sent to generation but God has got minor prophet people that is put his life in them to be a prophet to your family amen we know women cannot be in the fight for Ministry but as a place for women in your home the woman is rude the pastor unto the children because when you attend the man is working the husband is working but the woman is the pastor to the children to teach them the word of the Lord and we know John Wesley his mother was a pastor to 17 or 19 children just like it's cool or a class of itself and if he imparted the word of the Lord to them and the Lord used mightily John Wesley for the word and just Loosely to be a songwriter amen and we want to encourage the young people that God before the foundation of the world plays gifts and talent in you to use you amen and all you need to do is Avail yourself make yourself available and let the Lord take control for your life by the Holy Ghost baptism that is the only way you can manifest your purpose on this Earth amen so we want to talk about my trip to Colombia but Jack asked me to talk about it and it was already my notes to give updates on the trip to Colombia December last year Christmas so let's go to let's read the first scriptures in fact let's go back and read probably the only scripture that we read we read more scriptures but let's stand and read the scripture if you could Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1 just the first verse we're gonna read a rest in the course of time but let's read the first verse which is very powerful scripture thou touch every not even a younger but an adult to know that you are here on a mission you are not going to stay here forever your life here began and your life will end between your birth and the death there's a purpose for your life and you got to do whatever you can to find our purpose and leave that purpose before your life terminates or expires on this Earth amen so let's read Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1. remember now that I'm Creator in the this of that youth while the evil days cometh come north nor they the years drawn when thou shall see I have no pleasure in them the Lord add blessing to the reader of his word shall we take our seed amen we continue to read the rest of the same scripture in the course of time but let's go and give a little testimony which is going to tie into what I'm going to preach from Colombia on December 2022 I went to I think the Christmas I took a little trip it wasn't a one of those trips to go and preach that was in my my purpose to go and preach but part of the reason was just going res just change your environment as human being sometimes when you do the same thing so you need to change your environment so I just I was doing my clinicals I think I was in Palm Beach Gardens and I think before after I decided to take a trip to Colombia just to rest and then come back by the Lord has his agenda in your agenda sometimes things happen that you didn't plan for it you don't have a clue about it but the Lord manifests those things in his time so I want to read another scripture here which is about kind of a missionary scripture with the scripture for every one of us amen because the Bible said go into the world and preach the gospel preaching is only by verbal preaching by your life the best sermon is living a life of Jesus Christ if you don't say a word people can see Christ in you and they'll be thirsty and hungry for their cries in you amen so Mark 16 15-17 he said unto them go into the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and this shall this signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly sin it shall not hate them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen this scripture is not only for preachers it's for everyone in the body of Christ and we're gonna find out men and women amen so let's go to the next slide and then this was um December around I think 2026 somewhere but again bro I think someone filming the mission from Colombia he comes here sometime and his wife so we went to that trip was proud the place was called Santa Marta which means Saint Martha that was a big coastal city in Colombia it's a tourist City but unfortunately there's no message church over there but a few couple of Believers handful of Believers in that city so we went and then sometimes we go to the beach and just relax and share the word of the Lord to whomsoever so brother Gabriel went to visit his auntie that he hasn't met in about 20 years after his mom died so he went with his wife and I told them I was going to wait at the hotel so he came back and said my auntie who is 81 or around 80 years old want to be baptized in the name of the Lord the first question he asked me was Gabriel I want you to baptize me and the husband so he shared word of the Lord with them and so we had a chance to baptize his auntie then thrip people also got baptize let's go to the next slide um we had one where do I start but Gabriel on the right and then the aunties the one they were holding and then little girl is an Ulysses and I'll share testimony about this little girl and then her grand mom is sister Gloria behind with the hand wrist but Gabriel's wife is uh next behind and then sister ohemia and then the husband he's an Italian guy and then of course I don't have to tell you who's the next person is right so we baptize four people public Gabriel did a baptism I prayed and preached a little sermon to them about baptism baptism is actually from the Greek word baptism which means to be dead to be buried and also types marriage you have to die to the old husband the old soul the old nature the old control tower that you were born with through sex that being has to die and another being that they were ordained before the foundation of the world the lord Jesus Christ himself takes over this flesh and then you are no longer the same person that you used to be you get a change of husband change of name change of spirit change of Flesh change of Soul everything changed because you become a new creature amen and that's the most important thing in the life of every human being the most important thing is not your money it's not your bank account it's not your family your family can die and leave you your wife can despise you your husband can despise you your children can leave you your parents can leave you but there's only one person who will not leave you even if you leave yourself he will still be with you amen when you come to the with end and you can't continue he will raise you up and push you forward and he's the Lord Jesus Christ so we baptize but Gabriel baptized his auntie I think she's also Tatiana sister Gloria and her grandbaby analysis and her sister or hernia so it happened this way that the Italian guy invited invited us to Pizza I think on the 24th night and at the pizza side he was asking me questions he's living in Italian he know everything about the Roman Catholic change so he said so what is the difference between you Christians and the Catholic is it because Christians Deep in water by Imagine and Catholic sprinkle is that the difference so we talk a little bit about baptism and then when we came back to the house October Gabriel that you need to speak to this man there's something bubbling in his heart so we had a meeting and with all the family we're talking and in the course of the talking the Holy Ghost hit the little girl analysis she started crying and confessing practice that asked her was she a Christian she said well she used to go to church during the before the pandemic but then during the pandemic they stopped going to church and he's never been in church so the Holy Ghost hit and started confessing little girl 11 year old girl that she's backsliding she's the little girl but she knew there's something in her she's not been in church for a year so she know this is not where she used to be and certain Spirit were trying to take over her from my understanding they told me that their mother was an abusive mother so the Grand Ma wanted to take care and raise it and there was something in this little girl around this little on in this little girl that I recognized so she started crying and talking and confessing about 30 minutes and but give us a less pray so we started praying he was praying lay hands on the little girl and the Holy Ghost struck by the Gabriel and she pulled a ring give me one second I have it here Glory Hallelujah to the Lord I'm going to show this ring I wish I can pass it on but I just want you to look at it amen this is a ring and you might think it's just a ring but the spirit behind everything there's a covenant with death Covenant with Satan and I will speak a little bit out Chris here and talk a little bit about ranks amen so the little girl it wasn't her mom it wasn't even her family she said somebody gave it to her see how people somebody can incarcerate on your daughter on your son without even you being aware in school in the neighborhood in the family wherever and I'll talk a little bit about this ring let me just go so that everybody can have take a glimpse of it this is a ring there's a ring that was on 11 year old girl amen but the Lord is merciful and I will Christ here and talk about Rings a little bit that's Covenant with that that satanic Covenant amen I found out because she's been a little bit insolent to the grandparents disrespectful to the grandparents and he said that is why this is the spirit now let me talk a little bit about rank amen we don't put rings on our hands for for just putting on their fingers if you ring everything necklace rings and whatever they have meaning amen when somebody get married they put a ring on their fingers to show that the man is my the woman is married people put promise rings now people put rings on their thumb do you know what it means it's got several meaning now women who put rings on their thumb they are very powerful man on quotes women that they don't go after the men men come to them lesbians put ring here to show that they are homosexuals and they are lesbians on the thumb ring now if you're a little gay little boy you put those ring on your hands you might not know desperate that is behind that ring you are inviting lesbianism into your life you are getting yourself prematurely matured when you are not matured mature let me speak in English American English and if you do that you're exposing yourself to men and men who take advantage of you because you are telling men that I am ripe when you are not even ripe yet and if a fruit mango tomato avocado is not ripe and it forces to wrap it dwindles and it dies away so if you are not when you should get married and you want to expose yourself to men or women they will take advantage of you and destroy your life amen so never put those ring unless you're a lesbian you want to tell the people that you're a lesbian or you're a woman that you want to invite those women are not some of them are politicians some of them are very rich wealthy affluent women and they don't go with ordinary men they are not your regular prostitute that you see them on the street no they are powerful women socially speaking and they go with certain men politicians rich men so when you see those ring it's an invitation to those people to those men amen they are spread that we pick we don't know the meaning of those Spirits we think it's just normal nail polish red Brown whatever color you put on your nails it used to be if you go to the Bible the first person that did was Jezebel and there was a prophecy that Elijah prophesied because of what she did killed and her husband what's the name jehu no is it jehu no Maybe the kid neighbor and was the husband of Ahab thank you they killed neighbors God Professor that the same place that they killed both dogs will lick their blood and the Lord anointed jehu to go kill um Jezebel so she was upstairs and she saw Jezebel soldier who come in and Jezebel was a very beautiful she was Miss America Miss West Palm Beach so she felt like I'm going to use my beauty to entice me because I know there's something up his lips he's not coming in peace so he put He painted his fingernails printed his lips eyelashes to attract jehu to have sex with to seduce him but the Lord has put upon his heart to kill him so he sent his soldiers to go and drop him down he died and it happened just according to what the Holy Ghost prophesied through the Prophet Elijah why if the Lord give you brown fingernails why do you want to make it yellow blue green whatever what is the essence you are picking speed of Jezebel into your life and it will manifest in the course of time especially the young kids your spirit is now developing you don't know what is good and bad you don't know the word you are living in that they are wicked spirit and when you invite demons into your life the demons will take over your life and Destroy You amen so we thank the Lord Force lives we were safe on that day and I keep praying for them we will pray in the Lord to raise the church we're looking for somebody with the city of representation to pay the gospel and then start the church in Santa Marta Colombia I think brother but Ernesto is from Colombia and Tatiana as well he's from Colombia so God bless you so let's go to the next slide and this is what I want to the the scriptures I want to read for the young people and I chose International Children's Bible so that you can understand sort of the King James and then I want to read but as someone can you do me a favor can you read for me God bless you ah remember your creator while you're young your old age is coming when you have many troubles when that time comes you won't have much to enjoy when you become old the light from the sun moon and stars will seemed dark to you it will seem as if the rain clouds never go away at that time your arms will lose their strength your strong legs will become weak and bent your teeth will fall out so you can't cannot chew your eyes will not see clearly your ears will be deaf to the noise in the streets you will barely you you were barely hearing singing the sound of the millstone grinding your your grain will seem very quiet but you'll wake up when a bird is first excuse me is first starting to sing you will fear high places and you will be afraid to go for a walk because of you may fall your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree you will live along like a grasshopper when you walk your desires will be gone then you will go to your Everlasting home and people will go to your funeral remember God before your life has snapped like a silver chain remember God before your life is broken like a Golden Bowl it will be as useless as a broken bucket at the spring it will be no good like a broken wheel at the water well your body will become part of the Dust of the Earth again but your spirit will return to God who gave it everything is useless the teacher says that everything is useless my precious brother amen amen so as a child sometimes you might think you're going to be a child forever yes at the age of maybe 16 12 to 16 12 to 16 18 20 25 you are in the bloom of Life maybe the best time of your life but that's when you are the most vulnerable amen that's the best time to receive the Lord Jesus Christ sweet 16 when you are in that age if we're going to receive Christ into your life you'll be fine you cross over all the ages but if you don't receive Christ into your life and you allow the spirit that is working in this world there's a spirit on Earth called love this year spirit and I'll speak a little bit about it amen let's go to the next slide I'll just want to read through the slide and come to the sermon now this is Jeremiah 29 11-14 he said for I know they thought that I think throw it toward you says the Lord thought of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end God has a program for you he has a plan for you but you have to be ready to receive the plan of God then shall he call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and now he can unto you and he shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I'll be fond of you says the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I'll gather you from the all the nations and from the place whether I've driven you says the Lord and I'll bring you again into the place once I cause you to be carried away captive if you accept Jesus Christ into your heart the Lord will bring you to where you were before the foundation of the world Amen let's go to the next scripture this for only on us for brothers and sisters not for young people and young young girls and young boys proverbs 31 10 2. I'm just really intend to I think a couple of verses are there selected some verses so who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of a husband that safely trusts in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness her children ariseth I rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he Praises her many daughters have done virtuously but thou Excellence them all thou the new generation you can live a life worthy of the gospel and you have a testimony like a testimony of Ruth like a testimony testimony of Esther testimony of Mary if you commit your heart to the Lord and he goes to say that favor verse 30 favor is deceitful beauty is vain but the woman that fear is the Lord she shall be priests give hair of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise in the gates amen if you commit your life to the Lord the Lord will bless you amen and I want to speak I want to just I want to run through my scriptures and quotes let's look at where I pick the word I am sweet 16. babram was talking about a little 16 year old girl in a church and she had she was blessed to her brother Brahma I said pastor so you are blessed to Harbor the Jack as your pastor but if you don't recognize it it will do you no good and you want to use sweet 16 I don't know her name but Ram didn't say her name but I want to call her sweet 16. she was 16 years old when everything began to top her down let's read a Hebrews chapter not Hebrew the book of Hebrews the brown preached in 1957 0922 e is right there it's a paragraph three five fives a man see some some little Jezebel all painted up you know and you go around fall for her maybe you got a good wife and then you call yourself a Christian shame on you you need another dose of the altar that's right and some of you some of you women look around at some old guy with his hair slicked down enough vaseline on it to open his mouth and then some little old girl here not long ago so vice versa a certain maybe a woman with a good husband doesn't appreciate the husband will go for somebody like that you know Brown was giving examples now let's go to 360 paragraph three five seven some little old girl here not long ago this this ain't a joke because I don't mean I don't mean to tell it as a joke but the people knows that this is no place of joke but a little old girl here there was a five boys here Christian boys long time ago when I was pastoring here we used to have just young men's classes and I'll speak to the young women on Sunday afternoon and about about sex and things then the next Sunday Sunday afternoon speak to the young men and trying to get those things kept out amen he's not speaking to them to go have sex but they want to keep it out of them because that is the spirit that is what fighting them amen and this morning we're going to be very straightforward because there's a proverb or an adage in my language that said that if a boil Is Not Afraid or is not shameful to grow on your nose don't be ashamed to put a bomb or abandoned on the ball to drain it out amen what I'm trying to say that if a boil right you know boy or pimples grows on your nose don't be afraid to put a cream whatever to kick it to to heal it what do I mean if the devil even at that age is planting so so many spirits in a lot of children why should we be afraid and shy and not talk about things plainly among the youth that is troubling them so as ministers we're going to have a stakeholders amen the stakeholders are the young people themselves they're on the center of everything the parents are one of the stakeholders or players the ministry we are one of the major stakeholders and the almighty God himself is the chief Captain amen and all the three stakeholders or four have got a part to play parents at certain age in your children's life they're going to turn into age certain age that hormones let them call it chemicals will be growing through their body because they were born in that attribute and so they begin to ask questions they want to find out who they are why am I going through this why do they menstruate why did they grow certain hair on part of the body is just normal so you the parents shouldn't be ashamed to tell them how they were born there's nothing shameful about it to tell your children that men grow or women grow and they get to a point they get married and then they unite and bring for children because we don't teach them they're learning from school on the internet from Friends boyfriends girlfriends old men old women treat them the wrong way and destroy the life of your children so you should be able to sit your daughter your son down and tell them that it's not a mystery it's just normal thing that human beings do God ordain it so my daughter my son you have to see the holy ghost first when you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Christ Jesus says will tell you at the right Point who your husband or your wife is and you can marry and live as me and your daddy or as me and your mommy live amen but until then if you go into sex without getting married it's sin you're driving your guardian angels away from you and there's a prize to pay you can go have sex all you want to satisfy gratify your flesh but there might surprise on the way that you regret the rest of your life but if you wait on the Lord Jesus Christ to give you the ordained husband and ordained wife you'll be the happiest person amen Glory Hallelujah so but Abraham wasn't ashamed to call the young girls and teach them about sex and the young boys says to drive that thing from them and if you plan nothing in them when they go to school they know that Mom and Dad and ministers have taught us you are not going to teach me your perversion because I know the right one because if you don't stand for something any wind can blow you so if you know where they stand they know that yes I'm going to grow and get married so I'm not going to have a boyfriend I'm not going to expose myself to you you're not going to destroy my life but if you don't plan that thing in them and they are just they don't know nothing and if some use certain ways for for Sweet 16's boyfriend you call them old shrimps if some old shrimp tell them that you are the most beautiful lady on this planet wow I never knew I'm the most beautiful my dad never told me my mom never told me wow Johnny and he falls for Johnny because nobody even your brain don't tell them they are beautiful you probably don't tell them they are gorgeous they don't tell them that what they need to hear at that age in their time because girls grew to certain age they need to hear certain things and father and mother shouldn't be ashamed to let them know that they are beautiful and God has raising them for purpose maybe they're going to marry a minister of God so you preserve yourself and use your character to bless the ministry God will put you under amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's go to the next one the next slide sweet 16. let's read on so some little old girl started going with some old some little old shrimp and I tried to find out this was in the 50s so I wanted to know what the problem mean by shrimp because we know shrimp I love shrimp I love Seafood but it's not talking about the stream in the ocean or streaming their Rivers he's talking about a character that looks like a shrimp and I found out that shrimp is somebody who presents himself who is of who is weak low quality but they present themselves it disguise himself as strong person so so what did I get to he said some little ocean said some little old girls started going with some old little shrimp downtown here smoked cigarette and had a flask in his pocket and he drove a little Roadster car around town I couldn't see what she's seen in that boy he wouldn't come to church he would sit out there put her in church out here and then he sat out there on the outside in his car and wait we didn't come in church I said to her one day she leave a New Albany I said I want to ask you something girly what in the world do you see in that boy I said that the first place he hits the very religion that you have he despises your Christ he would never make you a husband he will make you miserable all your life and I said well there's fine little Christian boys here that you could go with and there your daddy and your mother despite the thought of you going out but you're going anyhow you think I am sweet 16. that's why I pick my contest sweet 16. that is the age don't think about it only 16 you could be from 10 to 20. so sweet this isn't just the average it could be 15 11 12 17 18 I'm sweet 17 so put whatever age you are there amen I'm sweet 16 and let's see what transpired now she started wearing makeup and running around and first thing she was in Road houses you know Road houses clubs pubs where they drink I used to live in UK England Road houses pubs is where Irish people they drink like I don't know like fish people drink women and men drink is like they can't wait to go go from work and go drink so they go to pass and drinks and this girl who was Raising church with Christian parents she found herself in those pubs and clubs and country clubs he said now that's what she's gone on to Eternity sweet sister got inspired quickly because she tried to be mature when he wasn't mature she would try to leave a life that God did not ordain her to live God ordained her to be a sweet 16 to set the Lord Jesus Christ but sweet 16 let the last of the flesh the last of the eyes the pride of life influence her to go with a person that didn't fear the lord she didn't have nothing to do with Christ she never even one time go into the church room and I want to stop here and tell you the kind of Pastor that the lord gave you to Sweet 16 amen and I'm not going to tell you from example from the message but people that I work with brother Abraham who gave a verbal testimony of their experience and I'm not talking about this prophetic Ministry but his ministry even as a pastor amen so that you appreciate the family God put you into if you are here and the Lord bless you with a Christian father and mother be thankful to the Lord Christian grandparents uncles aunties whoever friends Godfathers godmothers be thankful to the Lord a Christian a pastor full of the Holy Ghost brother jagdaf to Pastor you with ministers around him to bless you be thankful to the Lord is for your protection amen what did I get to Glory Hallelujah I was talking about yes I had a chance to meet a brother when I was back in Ghana and the brother was 66 years old he was born and raised in Indiana he said before I met Abraham I'm coming from the Pentecostal church and my parents believe in Divine Healing my father was a Pentecostal Minister and my younger sister my baby sister died and my father called us around we prayed and the Lord brought my sister up raise it up so we believe in divinely before even remember Abraham and when we met brother Braham we're going to the Tabernacle the message of Abraham preaching I think Lane Tech to Lin tech school college is that I was sitting there and saw the messages and said brother my Ministry is over I'm 66. the Lord told me I will go to be with him I think 83 or 80 something so you know the time was going to go said my Bible was stolen and the Lord let me know my Ministry is over so you the young people tell the mantle and and pray the gospel now this evidence of a man that believed in the Lord Jesus Christ a prophet he said they will leave everything when they met Abraham they never went back to their Pentecostal Church they always were at the Tabernacle when the ram was in town I met another brother who told me about uh brother Abraham he said he was a young boy in church and RAM Tabernacle was very strict like when when is church order silence but Brown was coming from the Baptist and the Pentecostal background so when sometime it doesn't come early you come like two hours people drive from places go their hours just to get a front seat and if we're if we're a child and you talk or somebody make noise the deacons will come and tap you maybe their mother if your child is making noise second or third time they put you at the back and brought some they'll bring somebody who want to sit in the front so this little boy was sitting I think with their mother and Barbara was coming to the pulpit from the office to pick I think anointing oil paint something like that and he saw the pill of Fire on the head of brother Abraham as he was walking the pillow fight was moving on him and he said mama look and his mom put his hand on his mouth said look Emma Brown look at him and look at the pillow fire on top of his head look at him this is the pastor God gave it to Sweet 16. a man he was born a sinner yes William Brown was born a snake like us he was an adopted son of God but he was one of the first fruits to show us the way of Jesus Christ he embodied the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost was him just like the Holy Ghost want to be in you to manifest amen he was a prophet to the generation we don't worship about Abraham We Worship the Lord Jesus Christ he was a prophet like Paul Jeremiah Abraham John the Baptist God use but we worship the Lord Jesus Christ and even in the celestial Dimension when before God ordained prophet and ordain knew the gift he put in you it wasn't putting you when you were born it was in you when you were in the celestial Dimension you were still funny you were like 18 years old so when John the Baptist was didn't know not John about to sorry John the Divine met the seventh angel with the seven angel that was brother Brown in the seven sixth Dimension and he wanted to worship he said no do not worship me I'm one of your servant one of the seven Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we don't watch about Abraham he's a prophet that God reads for us to use the word of the Lord to break the bread of life to her just like Paul but we worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen now this is the pastor the lord gave it to Sweet 16. but in that time sweet 16 didn't take advantage of the pastor the lord gave it to him to her sweet sister let her flesh the influence of maybe her schoolmates who are boyfriends so she went for a boyfriend and let's see I think I didn't finish reading Lem finished reading where did I go to he said he got to Eternity but then she stood here and you know what excuse the girl gave me back there she loved that boy she said he's got such a cute little feet and it smells so good could you imagine that perfume himself up just as a not a man look I said sister I'd rather go with a Christian boy that had fit like gravel cars and smell like pulled cut if he was absolutely a Christian and I'll go that's Friday true it's an excuse just a such cute little feet and smells good the little the little Roadhouse Runner finally ruined the life of the girl it's shame and disgraceful in other words she Drew throughout her life and she died prematurely little sister little brothers let us go into your ears when I was growing up I had a Pentecostal Elder he wasn't one of the fight for Ministry but whenever he preached he said he who has years let him hear what the spirit speaks unto the church and if a little little young in here little brother Little Sisters You've got something in here here you might not hear this we don't pray this kind of sermons too much we always pray to the adults but the Lord put upon my heart to produce to you and receive it with oil for your heart you might not hear it again in the same way again but it's something that will change your life amen ambaram said marriage is Honorable but it should be entered prayerfully and reveling reverently and genuine love for that woman will bind you together forever what you ban on Earth our bind in heaven if you get the right wife and right man God will bind that person you've been eternally together here on Earth forever and the other side amen but if you choose the wrong person you're gonna create hell right here on Earth hell on your two feet not on the other side but right here you're gonna smell Pepe you're gonna smell onions you're gonna smell things you don't want to smell so be careful and hear the advice your friend give to you hear the voice of God through the ministers God has given you Minister but I Smiley is is he's got a belt of experience around him Pastor for 22 plus years he comes humbly full of the Holy Ghost he sit back these are the men that pray for you Godly women if I should mention names I'm going to mention all of the names Godly men brother keepers and sister Keepers example to you you know and all of you amen grandparents mothers around you to help you and to govern your life until you get the Holy Ghost of your own but if you want to run ahead of your parents if you want to run ahead of your father your ministers and do like the sweet 16 did go get some old shrimps for your boyfriend because of sex you're gonna ruin your life you're gonna aspire before the time the Lord gives you and life will be miserable you probably regret for living on Earth remember King when Cain did what he did he wished he wasn't even created if you go against the Lord I'm a minister I deal with a lot of people God can forgive you of whatever sin you commit but sometimes difficult for you to forgive yourself the pain and the sorrow you bring to yourself sometimes has to take God and you will keep it when the Lord has forgiving you that it doesn't even remember in his book of memory but you should remember because you brought that Soul upon yourself so the Lord has given you a clean slate to write what are you going to write on your slit your life your flesh do you want to write the holy ghost in your life or you want some old shrimps to destroy your life amen I have I made it let's go to the next slide to the Lord be the glory God bless sister Nelly she said Lord foreign who smells like what a boy who smells like poor cat and because I was going to teach young people I just wanted to bring him pictures now this is a skank I've seen I haven't seen a pole card before but this is a skank never mess with a skank they defend himself by emitting very sweet order I use the word sweet order it's not sweet order it says stinking smelling odor if a skunk pass around here and emit that order you can hear somewhere in a in a heavy Hill Street that's how much they smell if a skunks pass here when you are driving you can even on the highway you can smell it and you don't know whether to turn the windows Now to turn them up it's those things is a skunk comes in your house believe you me it could be a multi-billion dollar house you leave the house for the skank you can never live in the house that's how much they smell this thing and this is a polar card I think they are mainly in Europe haven't seen one before but Ram said that if a boy or a girl evens things like a scan called pull cut I rather and he's got the Holy Ghost absolutely a Christian because you can wash away the smell there's thinking smell but you can't wash away the old soul you take the Holy Ghost to remove the old person you can you could even change yourself how are you going to change somebody it takes a lot to change that person so don't go look for some Johnny or shrimp and tell yourself I'm going to change him or it's going to change her you're going to have some things thinking in your nose amen young people do you hear me Glory Hallelujah but if you can give your heart to the Lord with all of your heart you will be you'll be secured in Christ let's go to the next slide I put this one Glory Hallelujah yes this working so let me just something a little here I said there is your holy convocation what is Holy convocation is the Holy Ghost baptism not not have anything to do with the literal thing it's beyond that we are not celebrating Jewish festivals it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that he never did start it never started on any day he wasn't saved on any day he was always saved amen Jesus Christ comes to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with didn't begin on Earth you were saved before the foundation of the world but the Holy Ghost allows you to recognize the Salvation the lord gave to you before the foundation of the world without the Holy Ghost you don't know you are saved but the Holy Ghost quickens you your mortal flesh to recognize that salvation that was planted in you before time amen and we want to bring a lawsuit against let's go to the next slide and I'll stay here for a while you want to bring a lawsuit which I'll call it class action lawsuit against the spirit of laodicea which is false human rights now let me explain what is class action lawsuit we are no lawsuit when you get sued by by somebody individual by class action it's not even the victim that sued the people that deceive them or the defendant in class action lawsuit they are lawyers whose job is they don't kind of tend to individual individual people but they look into institutions such as Banks schools certain universities they don't have how do I call it they don't they don't have a let's say certain investors who put up they have 100 job rates what they finish will help you to get a job and then they target veterans veterans have got a GI bill when you serve in the military you end up getting certain money you can use for education so they target them they target uh people of color African-American get education and then they get trash that Dedication that they have will not they run them into debt they borrow financial aid which they can't pay they can't buy a house people of uh they target mainly Hispanics African-Americans and some white and other people but mainly African-American now this lock is given a classical example Donald Trump an ex-president of U.S had a trump University if some of you know about it that Trump University the diploma you get there is just a piece of trash it will not earn you nothing probably you can't even get a job with it in a in a way where uh Dunkin Donuts but then he was making millions getting people's money so before before when he came before he became president the father a class action lawsuit against him and he had to pay 25 million and most of the students get about 90 of the school fees that they paid the tuition another class action lawsuit is a big Pharma pharmaceutical companies they make billions and trillions of dollars and they have power because they are connected to uh the politicians so they they push let me take a simple example like aspirin baby aspirin 81 milligram and then Bayer makes baby aspirin that people take they say when you get to 80 years old take it to prevent stroke and stuff like that now research has shown that is not always needed some people don't need it now people take it and they could get stomach ulcer they bleed in their stomach now class action lawsuit anyone who has taken baby aspirin you don't have to go to court you just have to what give your consent that I took a baby aspirin and I suffered ulcer or ulcerated stomach and I'll earn you some money so in class action lawsuit you don't have to visit sometimes the lawyers themselves don't go to court they send people with that Bayer company uh through their aspirin baby aspirin let's say they found out they sent they know why you take your prescriptions so they have your information they will send you a letter and if they get about let's say a million or 500 people now they can stand on it and now raise a lawsuit against Bayer company Banks certain banks will take when you have your own money not the credit card when you're going to take money from the bank they take money from your debit card and then dispose them and they file a lawsuit against those Banks so class action lawsuit you don't have to even go to court the victim even don't know that they've been deceived and duped but then their lawyers are the one who knows it and then bring this lawsuit and then let you know you just give your consent you will get some 10 million sorry ten thousand dollars you could get uh 200 000 you could get as low as 500 whatever they will calculate the amount and then divide it among the people so that's class action lawsuit and now the natural types are spiritual some of God's people have been deceived and duped by the old devil a spirit called loudacia loudicia means what people's rights but it's a spirit of deception the devil told you that you have the right to change from being a man to a woman change your sex you have you're a man but you find yourself in a girl's body so now you can change your sex and be change your gender and become a trans they have a bunch of names says trans and whatever we're born to know that men we have men and women but now we've got in between a bunch of things that you can name it and that's the spirit of laodicea Amen but it says not even supposed to be here was in in the church ages time and laodicea was supposed to be dead but just like the professor Express don't die the sense within the time of Noah they lingers on and they appear so ladisia is right here telling you that you've got a right you are 18 years old you can move from your parental house you can trance yourself and become a woman let me tell you people that commit suicide trans people lesbians nobody killed himself because God gave you a masculine spirit and you take hormones to develop breasts your son or the woman you slay masculine so you are in a nightmare you are fighting between being a man and being a woman your natural spirit is a man I will never be a woman I'm a man but then when you trance you're trying to tell your intelligence that hey quick I'm a woman I'm a girl I'm a woman I'm a girl I'm a woman I'm a girl you're a man so your brain is going this way and they destroy themselves they commit suicide it's a spirit on Earth in schools in politics in a job place in homes in families if you let yourself God has given you one thing your choice you've got a choice like 316 she was of age you know what was good and bad the parent couldn't tie her and take her to church your dad cannot tie you on his belt and take you to work no I don't want my child to commit uh fornication so I'm tying her no your pain cannot do that you sweet 16 sweet 11 sweet 12 sweet 17 sweet 18 you have got a choice to make just like your print made their choices you either choose Jesus Christ and you fill your heart and you'll be singing Hallelujah and victory in your life or you choose perversion laodicea and you might not you might Aspire before the time the Lord allotted for you if God ordain you for eternal life you go back to Glory by your time here will not be a good memory amen he who has yes no physical yes we've got a hear on your heart let him hear what they're supposed to say to you amen are very aggressive I had a message from a friend he said be careful if your children order books from Amazon you might not know the books that they're ordering he said what does it teaching them to be trans to begin to be lesbians they are permitting everywhere in society everywhere politics it's what the Antichrist but Brahm said that the Bible said that the sins of the amorites will hit full Sodom and Gomorrah the lord gave them their rights men going after men women after women but you know what happened to Sudan Gomorrah the same thing all the world United States Europe Africa the Lord has given us right choose whatever you want to choose if you want to be gay that is your choice but one day you find yourself committing suicide one day you you're great that life you can't reverse it you have destroyed your Earthly Journey so the Lord is warning you and telling you that run away from laadisia and accept Jesus Christ in your heart seeking the Holy Ghost baptism seek the Lord with all of your heart and fear the lord I said Chad what you need is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom if you fear the lord certain spirit will not come around you because they fear of the Lord forms a circle around you say no I'll never do this I'll never let somebody touch me when I'm not married if I do that God is going to kill me that is not my life that's not what my pastor taught me my friend don't teach me that you can keep that in your family I keep what the Lord taught me in my family we are here to go to school we could be friends but I'm not con what they call Contracting your spirit on me amen do not accept anything that you don't want let nobody put something on you but be who you are God made you a son a daughter of God to glorify himself in you amen Brother Joseph where you at can I borrow your face again come here I want to give you a little testimony about my friend your little preacher he's even told not to call him preacher because he's still with known the Lord he's not sure yet but this boy little brother had a testimony we know that he got sick December he was attacked with tumor I was in Colombia when brother Josue and stamina sent message to pray for him and brother Jose his dad sent me testimonies that are marveled for 11 year old boy the testimonies that came from not from him not from his family not from that their mom and his sisters but people around not only in Sweden to Tabernacle but brothers and sisters and friends the testimony that they spoke about the 11 year old boy even somebody who might be 80 years old who didn't save the Lord will not get that testimony on his funeral day people were crying talking about him how this boy was standing for the Lord pleading the blood of Jesus Christ on him I said he was an inspiration to me to be frank with you 11 year old boy what made that difference is chosen to give his heart to the Lord and serve the Lord you can take your seed God bless you so my brother my sister doesn't it doesn't matter how long you live that's not what matters by the time the Lord has loted for you if you leave Jesus Christ if God forbid but Joseph went to be with Glory his testimony will ring bells on Earth and in heaven it wasn't a testimony people pay minister to give their families good testimony when they die that has got nothing to do with God they know they were drunkard they were womanizers they were just name it they were armed robbers but on the on their on their funeral day they pay ministers you know my brother this you know give and the persons will just ministers whatever officiating ministers will write wonderful testimonies oh Mr swans was a good man he was the best man he always they use the word always he always was good and kind to people once once he was fighting every one of the neighbors he was no kind person he was an evil man that testimony doesn't go nowhere but testimony is the Life of Christ in a person amen and young people you've got the opportunity to give your life to the Lord to receive the Holy Ghost what you have to be thinking is do I have the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost let me just read a little bit we are getting to the close and I have a gift for the young people praise the Lord hallelujah let me read a little bit here I think a future home 64. yeah let me let me just go straight Satan Sinners and sinners has gone forever it's all done it's talking about the holy ghost blended into eternity and all that was perverted that great Archangel that said that one day Satan that that did all this evil will be destroyed remember the Bible said that if that Soul won't do as he did said do he will even destroy that soul but you see you can't destroy him he can't destroy himself and remain God so if that soul is of the world it has to be destroyed but if it's Eternal with God it never did begin because it's part of God and can never be destroyed amen what a beautiful how thankful the church ought to see that that if God give you the Holy Ghost baptism part of Christ is important into your heart the old nature is gone the old soul is consumed Christ is born into your heart and then become a new person you've got a new husband a New Soul a new nature a new believing in you that is what they cry the church is built upon amen let's go to the next slide Glory Hallelujah to the Lord oh let's see Heaven and Earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun all the cases is gone just like all the cases of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you because it's God's attributes see if it's the holy ghost means God's spirit it is the attribute they thought of God has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose yet you was born in sin but God had the attribute and here you express yourself here on Earth and he comes down and gets you see you are back here here is where you belong to sin has lost its power that's right the desire of sin has then gone from your heart when the Holy Ghost comes in you are a restored person amen when the Holy Ghost comes in my brother my sister you are restored let's go to the next one now this way I'm going to be on their mothers God can use anybody you want to use there was a prayer meeting where a lady had a baby that was sick and the Holy Ghost impressed upon another mother to pray for the for the late for the baby and he said no he's going to have babram he's going to pray for him who am I to go pray for for her for a baby so there was there was a conversation his own heart between her and the Lord so let's see let's read a little bit he said there was a little a little mother walking around packing a baby and there was another little mother sitting there typical Southern mother with a little gingham or whatever Calico I think it's a white cloth or whatever you call it dress on she said just a little housewife but the Lord kept dealing with that woman go pray for that baby while she look and the woman had prayed had prayer card and oh she said I'll be afraid to go pray for that baby brother Brahm is going to pray for that baby tonight the man got a prayer cast and said I wouldn't do that and he turned she turned around and the Lord said to her just revealed to her heart go pray for that baby so let's go on the next slide well it just kept haunting her so much she said well if that if that woman comes back through here again I'll I'm going to stop her so she said lady would you take my seat and sit down here I know you are just you just wore out with that baby he wouldn't and he would he wouldn't be here for a couple hours wasn't going to be here for a couple hours thank you sister I appreciate I hate to take your seat said being then being then we got into conversation would you mind if I just offer a little prayer for your baby I see you got a prayer card perhaps but Brown will pray for that baby tonight said but just to relieve my feeling would you mind if I offer a little prayer she said why certainly not to study here she held the little baby out and the little mother lay hands over the over the baby and pretty simple a simple little prayer let's go to the next slide and then the little woman couldn't have no place okay let me jump she said oh my let me go to the red I'm reading from the red oh my maybe I shouldn't have done that sometimes when the Lord leads you to do something and then after your human mind tells you that oh maybe I did something wrong he said maybe I shouldn't have done that but I felt better after I'd done it when the little woman came up the line with the baby the Holy Spirit Come begin to talk to the woman tell her who she was and what's the matter with the baby but said you know your baby is already healed because a little lady has prayed for her with a lot of Calico dress on standing right back there in the balcony God's already had her prayer and the baby is already healed you don't have to worry about it it's all right now what if the little mother had failed to do what God told her to do now see it wasn't the Evangelist place it wasn't evangelist Place God works in all the lady we have certain jobs to do but we have to pray one for another amen and then the next slide is sweet 16 stay in your heritage the Holy Spirit baptism the only place of safety you are blessed young person The Chosen generation of the almighty God Amen and I want to give a little gift at the back if Clinton can get it for me I want to give God has put gift in you and I want to use it as a symbol I'm going to give a tambourine to the little system switch systems and sweet elevens here amen and I want to use that one as a token that God has got something major your gift might not be plain tambourine in the church or at home but they say talking when I was coming up I wasn't I was raising the Pentecostal Church that's all I needed we go to church and beat the drums and recite Bible verses Psalm 23 after the morning the church go to town to preach evangelize in the town so all the young people were giving Bible scriptures to recite Psalm 23 Matthew 7 whatever but I didn't know that the Lord was forming the Lord Jesus Christ in my heart that was my beginning and I look back and I said oh Lord thank you for my old Pentecostal ministers and I want to give you a gift like I said you might not be a tambourine library and some of the sisters but I said talking for you to know that God Shalom God has got something to do with your life amen I was in the restaurant some time ago just give me one second with brother Josue a couple months ago and I asked questions I asked sister Dashner and sister Abby certain questions if they were they were praying for the Holy Ghost and I had different
