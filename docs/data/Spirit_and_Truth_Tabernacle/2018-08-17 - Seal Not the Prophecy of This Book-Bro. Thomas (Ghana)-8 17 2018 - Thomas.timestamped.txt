[39:15] any man shall take away from the words
[39:18] of the book of this prophecy God shall
[39:21] take away his part out of the book of
[39:24] life and out of the holy city and from

[40:05] my friend bright Chuck for this open to
[40:08] again and for some years back three or
[40:11] four years attached up to you and there
[40:14] was one time I was also tried to come
[40:16] back and speak at the our friend halted
[40:19] I thought in the Atlanta somebody I have
[40:22] a team it was have landed a plane halted
[40:24] because there was a great storm and I
[40:26] could not make it
[40:27] and last year or so I could not come to
[40:31] Florida but they said the Lord made a
[40:33] wave here to come true and the happy
[40:35] that I met my friend at Washington us
[40:38] Maryland we met together and I also
[40:40] enjoy Abraham said and the message was
[40:43] thinking my filter and the professor it
[40:46] is not because I'm preaching the way
[40:48] that you put me in heaven but he said I
[40:51] can sit in the congregation and
[40:52] listening to the unknown Techbridge
[40:55] hallelujah
[40:57] so I really also enjoyed my friend one
[40:58] as such and I listed to him preach we
[41:02] really do a really place so it is not
[41:05] just preaching but the unknown tip
[41:07] preaching however that the difference so
[41:11] that's why it is very important not
[41:13] anyone to to presume that you can make
[41:17] it easy because God has got and special
[41:21] people that he trained when I'm at a bus
[41:24] a loaded and said get them to training
[41:26] before he can really entrust into the
[41:30] hand to serve the Bride of Christ
[41:32] because you are very precious people but
[41:35] a prophet said who is the good Jesus
[41:37] Christ when he sat the people down and
[41:39] he'd be the master wash their feet seven
[41:43] my he was a seven you're serving the
[41:46] bride so you know the bride needs to be
[41:48] said so the producer who is the greatest
[41:50] they will not sit down to be sent under
[41:53] one that serve you are the greatest
[41:55] hallelujah you had a greatest so we are
[41:58] just servants and we serve you you see
[42:01] me standing here what I'm giving the
[42:03] bread of life you see that I was eating
[42:05] some are the greatest hallelujah we
[42:08] appreciate that you know your place as
[42:10] such and we give God the glory
[42:13] so tonight we are privileged to come
[42:16] into the presence of God and what's most
[42:19] important is the Word of God
[42:20] so I really appreciate my friend rakov
[42:23] him so tonight we are going to put a
[42:26] stay on the message sing
[42:29] of this worker seem not heavily her seal
[42:35] not the prophecy of this book man no the
[42:45] prefer was saying something here let me
[42:47] read it us before we go to the message
[42:50] why some people can't keep the victory
[42:53] in the message the Prophet said the love
[42:56] of God God is love and unless each one
[43:01] of these keys is put right in the same
[43:05] scent of love it will become selfish and
[43:11] indifferent and is set off and isolate
[43:19] itself and cross over and fuse and steal
[43:25] but when it is I crowd right in the
[43:29] middle of laughs it will finish
[43:32] everywhere and that is mine that's
[43:36] another wooden beam the church is dying
[43:39] of love brother
[43:41] hallelujah Oh best said bigger than all
[43:44] what are we a subject me ah that is a
[43:51] design the people he has really leaders
[43:55] like himself and that is what you want
[43:58] to see that prefer refreshing in earth
[44:00] under water will really distinguish it
[44:03] from this earth for the people this one
[44:05] is love and the prophets are only
[44:07] Christians can survive another of is a
[44:15] delta is different from the world liver
[44:18] so that is what God put to you so if you
[44:22] don't have the love we get on your knees

[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:32] there's nothing wrong see that the
[1:12:43] professor of this book
[1:12:45] hey man now the professor said that is
[1:12:54] the bride
[1:12:55] maybe I never separated from the groom
[1:12:57] when you read lesson of the Sankara got
[1:13:00] you fortune he said we were no separate
[1:13:02] said when Jesus we were seeing him and
[1:13:05] what Jesus was going to cover where we
[1:13:08] him because we will not listen
[1:13:11] waited let me fast maybe I can't he said
[1:13:14] remember hey wait yeah we ruin him
[1:13:19] you see God have must submitted the
[1:13:21] bread from the break room yes so when
[1:13:24] God down upon the butterflies he sobered
[1:13:28] me rafi me it was always aim in that one
[1:13:33] body you see they are once in the same
[1:13:37] way the service book of the world that
[1:13:40] the groom is
[1:13:42] right well hold on the bread come unfair
[1:13:47] to manifest everything that was promised
[1:13:50] of him and the group also come and he
[1:13:54] wouldn't be the bride but when we did
[1:13:59] everything and even to prove it by
[1:14:02] raising him up from the dead after world
[1:14:05] then thank the brain has to do the same
[1:14:09] thing has to be exactly what the word
[1:14:13] said she will be in the last day but she
[1:14:18] has to retain this miracle for don't she
[1:14:24] has to be in the last days that is
[1:14:28] manifest like it was in the days of
[1:14:31] Sodom but the world have to be just as
[1:14:35] only like that it is it is these things
[1:14:39] a picture identification of the Word of
[1:14:42] God
[1:14:44] yes so you and him will never separate
[1:14:50] areas because that's where the seal he's
[1:14:54] seen the path that is where when Jesus
[1:14:56] was on earth what did he tell the
[1:14:58] disciple he said don't go to the

[1:15:54] message the moon wasn't in him he was
[1:16:30] domesticated resolution we welcome
[1:16:33] listening that to the Gentiles because

[1:30:54] people less they break through unto
[1:30:57] their Lord to gaze and many of them

[1:31:07] up to the mountain and God was
[1:31:10] instructed that nobody should come
[1:31:13] closer to the mountain reverser what was
[1:31:16] well-being he was vindicating verses
