[1:00:40] prayer a man and one of the one of the
[1:00:43] beautiful things that's coming out of

[1:00:47] rest in Arlington a man Arlington
[1:00:52] National Cemetery that's des length and
[1:00:55] honor right and so we were very grateful
[1:00:59] you know that he served his country and

[1:03:15] to Africa you see stuff like that but
[1:03:17] but in Australia mercy I'll tell you
[1:03:22] what if you ever get a chance to go up
[1:03:25] wrong and I'm the thing I love about
[1:03:27] them is that they don't care where they
[1:03:29] at they carry the same spirit this high
[1:03:32] worship at home I'm a worship the same
[1:03:34] way right here cuz I am at home alright
[1:03:38] but that's the way that they they handle
[1:03:40] things that you know they're just I'm
[1:03:42] just I'm just blown away
[1:03:43] you know I'm blown away Laurie they go
[1:03:46] so I'm certainly on the expectation for
[1:03:48] tonight or just looking for God to it
[1:03:50] meant complete what he has started a man
[1:03:53] this weekend praise the Lord
[1:03:55] I'm not gonna sing I'm gonna just try to
[1:03:58] go right into our fall for today
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:01] thank you all for the specials they were
[1:04:04] such a blessing a man certainly
[1:04:06] appreciate each one I wanna today we're
[1:04:12] we're kind of kind of stay within a man
[1:04:14] this theme of the manifestation of the
[1:04:16] sons of God on Wednesday night we opened
[1:04:21] the service therefore the West goes with
[1:04:24] the thought the power to give and just
[1:04:28] something that I have preached here you
[1:04:30] know a little little ways back and you
[1:04:34] know just showing how brother Branham
[1:04:37] had that where he told Hattie right you
[1:04:43] know just because you said the right
[1:04:45] thing the Holy Spirit told me to tell
[1:04:47] you that whatever you asked for I can
[1:04:52] give it to you I can give it to you well
[1:05:00] whatever you asked for tonight now now
[1:05:01] now notice the Prophet could not do that
[1:05:03] and to the Holy Spirit said he could so
[1:05:08] these things are controlled by motive
[1:05:10] and objective a man not not by anything
[1:05:13] you know else but but the fact of the
[1:05:16] matter is he did it right he did it and
[1:05:20] the Holy Spirit also told him tell the
[1:05:24] little fishy I give you your life what
[1:05:28] what this what we're trying to say is
[1:05:30] that God wants to borrow somebody's lips
[1:05:35] God needs a body that he can work in and
[1:05:40] through and and and and and since you
[1:05:44] know everybody that we have read about
[1:05:46] in Scripture has come and gone there's
[1:05:50] only a few of us left so we might as
[1:05:54] well do what God has called us to do all
[1:05:57] right so you know we you know we want to
[1:05:59] just kind of stay within in this channel
[1:06:02] you know today and I want to read just a
[1:06:04] couple scriptures one of them amen we've
[1:06:08] already read and it's been read pretty
[1:06:09] much all weekend but
[1:06:11] that's Romans 8:19 you all just stand
[1:06:14] with me to read that and then also want
[1:06:16] to read out of first John Romans 8:19
[1:06:21] praise the Lord it reads as follows
[1:06:27] my god for the earnest expectation of
[1:06:32] the creature waiteth for the
[1:06:35] manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:06:40] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:06:42] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:06:46] sons of God I also turn with me over to
[1:06:49] the first John chapter 3 a man let's
[1:06:53] just look at this oh really God a man
[1:07:03] here in verse 1 it says behold what
[1:07:10] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[1:07:15] upon us that we should be called the
[1:07:22] sons of God the world North us not
[1:07:26] because it knew him not now that's
[1:07:29] that's kind of important you know
[1:07:31] because some of the things that we're
[1:07:33] expecting to change the world that
[1:07:37] that's probably not going to happen
[1:07:39] right because Obama tells us the world
[1:07:41] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:07:43] right amen but there are things that we
[1:07:46] should expect to change with it right
[1:07:49] we're not you know the world will not be
[1:07:52] safe right and and I know the Bible said
[1:07:55] God so loved the world but didn't like
[1:07:58] one brother asks what world which world
[1:08:02] are you talking about right you know so
[1:08:05] so so really we know salvation was
[1:08:07] really for us you know not not
[1:08:09] necessarily for everybody else a man but
[1:08:12] but here says beloved now are we the
[1:08:16] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[1:08:20] what we shall be but we know
[1:08:24] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:08:27] like him for we shall see him as he is
[1:08:29] let's just buy a word of Prayer amen as
[1:08:33] we before we enter our thought here
[1:08:36] today father we just thank you for the
[1:08:38] privilege to be able to come and read
[1:08:41] the word of the Lord God our desires
[1:08:47] that the Holy Spirit would give us
[1:08:49] understanding of what we are reading
[1:08:52] there's many that pick up this Bible
[1:08:54] mainly going to church this morning and
[1:08:56] there they're quoting from the Bible
[1:08:58] they're doing all these things but got
[1:08:59] no true understanding of what it is and
[1:09:02] as we just step into a thought God take
[1:09:05] control of the thought we felt your
[1:09:07] anointing thus far and the service and
[1:09:09] God we just want you to take take part
[1:09:11] of this take control of this part of the
[1:09:14] service then may you receive all the
[1:09:16] glory all the honor Highness all behind
[1:09:18] the cross that we might not be seen but
[1:09:19] may Christ be on display today and Jesus
[1:09:22] name we pray amen amen
[1:09:25] praise the Lord God bless you receive
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:35] so I read the scripture on Wednesday
[1:09:40] night there the earnest expectation of
[1:09:44] the creature waiteth for the
[1:09:45] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:09:49] when we read that same scripture out of
[1:09:52] the emphatic diet Glatt a man it
[1:09:56] actually speaks something a little
[1:09:57] different and the emphatic diag lot is
[1:10:01] actually the original translation of the
[1:10:04] scripture into the English language all
[1:10:07] right this is the emphatic dog line and
[1:10:09] in the original translation it says
[1:10:12] indeed the earnest expectation of the
[1:10:16] creation longs for the revelation of the
[1:10:22] sons of God all right so not just the
[1:10:25] manifestation but this word is actually
[1:10:27] translated as the revelation of the sons
[1:10:31] of God so we want to use for our title
[1:10:33] today the revelation of the sons of God
[1:10:37] amen the revelation of the sons of God
[1:10:41] so just bear with me as we just kind of
[1:10:43] take our time to get through this I want
[1:10:45] to set it up with a couple quotes and
[1:10:47] then we'll just let the Holy Spirit amen
[1:10:50] pray to the oldest beer to give us a
[1:10:52] wave that we can just coast hey man I
[1:10:55] want to start with this saw a quote out
[1:10:57] of adoption part three and then after I
[1:10:59] read that quote I'm gonna read a man
[1:11:02] from speak to this mountain so here the
[1:11:04] Prophet makes this statement we've been
[1:11:06] hearing this all weekend he says I'm
[1:11:10] sorry that should be 35 a man on that
[1:11:13] one adoption part three it should be 35
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:17] I'll come to that 85 later on but here
[1:11:20] in paragraph 35 says watch this master
[1:11:24] teacher Paul says the first thing he
[1:11:29] does is knock out all the idea of
[1:11:34] falling away not if this is critical you
[1:11:38] know when we start talking about
[1:11:39] adoption we talk about talk about you
[1:11:41] know being manifest that sons of God
[1:11:43] actually you have to get to a point in
[1:11:45] your thinking right where you ask
[1:11:48] they know who you are right there there
[1:11:52] is no no question about a my
[1:11:54] predestinated or am I not predestinated
[1:11:58] hey glory to God your predestination is
[1:12:03] not based on some of your actions like
[1:12:07] your your birthday I mean like like
[1:12:09] brother Israel brought it real good you
[1:12:11] say say you predestination has a lot to
[1:12:14] do with your birth right so whatever
[1:12:17] your last name is you did not choose to
[1:12:20] be part of that family oh praise the
[1:12:24] Lord
[1:12:24] if he was either born into it or you
[1:12:28] were adopted into it like we heard last
[1:12:30] night how do you got into the family it
[1:12:33] was not your choice it was God's choice
[1:12:37] to put you in that family right so so
[1:12:40] when you know what who your mama is and
[1:12:42] who your daddy is there is nobody to
[1:12:45] come tell you anything different so when
[1:12:48] you realize that God is your father the
[1:12:52] devil cannot tell you anything different
[1:12:55] not based on your actions because that's
[1:13:00] the devil's job soon as you do something
[1:13:02] wrong you not predestinated no no no no
[1:13:05] I'm not receiving that Satan you got
[1:13:08] predestinated but I am I'm a son of God
[1:13:14] I recognize Who I am right so so so so
[1:13:20] so when you come to recognition of who
[1:13:22] you are then you act different oh my god
[1:13:26] you know the reason that you make some
[1:13:28] of the decisions that you make is
[1:13:29] because you don't know where you are you
[1:13:32] don't have any you don't have any clue
[1:13:34] who you are can I just talk a little bit
[1:13:37] you know remember the lady that was sick
[1:13:42] as I don't know what she was sick and
[1:13:46] and not only it was sick but um you know
[1:13:48] she uh well you know she she was sick
[1:13:52] and they come down to try to find out
[1:13:54] hey do you have any children you know
[1:13:56] yeah yeah I got a son he lives over and
[1:13:59] you know foreign land well why don't you
[1:14:00] tell them about your singing I don't
[1:14:02] want to bother I don't want to bother I
[1:14:04] don't I don't wanna you know get upset
[1:14:06] and have to leave his working on and I
[1:14:08] you know I don't want to do that to him
[1:14:09] and and they say well well does he ever
[1:14:11] write anything yeah he write me all the
[1:14:14] time he you know and any and he sends me
[1:14:17] these pretty pictures pretty pictures
[1:14:21] see and just through the conversation
[1:14:23] they begin to put pieces together
[1:14:26] pictures well could you show me some of
[1:14:29] these she thought she know these are
[1:14:42] live pictures thank God she saved the
[1:14:47] big ships right because cuz comes with
[1:14:52] some powder that had more more on this
[1:14:55] peg came at your life
[1:14:58] they reveal the revelation came for huh
[1:15:04] they reveal these are not pictures not
[1:15:09] only are they not but lady you
[1:15:13] are not you are wealthy woman and even
[1:15:19] Realty she was they were not
[1:15:24] they were money orders many orders and
[1:15:31] the lady was wealthy but had no clue she
[1:15:35] was making decisions of things because
[1:15:37] she didn't have an understanding and the
[1:15:41] reason we do some of the things we do I
[1:15:43] say some of things we say it because we
[1:15:45] don't have understanding what can I say
[1:15:49] we don't have revelation when revelation
[1:15:53] strikes it makes you a new person how do
[1:16:02] you somebody so we're trying to knock
[1:16:05] out I'm gonna backslide tomorrow you
[1:16:11] know I'm gonna be up for a year and I'm
[1:16:13] gonna go right back down what are you
[1:16:14] talking about something missing
[1:16:17] somewhere with your understanding here
[1:16:19] we got to get this revelation into the
[1:16:21] people come on somebody let me keep them
[1:16:24] to keep going a man and she found the
[1:16:27] pictures in her Bible so when you go
[1:16:30] back and start looking at the words you
[1:16:31] realize who you are all right can we go
[1:16:34] further
[1:16:35] look the Prophet goes on to say this
[1:16:39] says the first thing he does is knock
[1:16:42] out all the idea of falling away knock
[1:16:46] out all the idea of ever being a
[1:16:48] Christian today and tomorrow I'm going
[1:16:54] can I just make this statement God don't
[1:16:59] have time to waste
[1:17:04] so what I mean by that if God could see
[1:17:08] fit to allow you to come to a church
[1:17:12] that would preach these things to you
[1:17:15] God is not wasting his time otherwise he
[1:17:21] would have sent you somewhere else
[1:17:22] but when you come even in your sin cuz
[1:17:28] i'ma tell you the reason the way you
[1:17:30] gonna stop sinners when you recognize
[1:17:32] who you are it's a different conduct
[1:17:35] that goes with it
[1:17:37] hallelujah the reason we do these things
[1:17:39] because we don't know who we are right
[1:17:41] but let me say SEPA God I got got ain't
[1:17:44] got time to waste like that so he's not
[1:17:45] he's not playing games if he allowed you
[1:17:47] to come into it to hear it he has
[1:17:49] purpose for that all right stay with me
[1:17:51] here I want to go further hey man listen
[1:17:53] listen says I'm gone and the next day
[1:17:57] God condemned me and the next day I'm
[1:17:59] back again
[1:18:01] so that's nonsense that's what the
[1:18:04] prophets said that is nonsense so if
[1:18:07] somebody start complaining I don't know
[1:18:09] if I'm hearing I don't know if I'm Danna
[1:18:11] that's nonsense that's what the Prophet
[1:18:14] says that's nonsense it says now this
[1:18:18] this book is not addressed evangelistic
[1:18:20] teaching evangelist sermons we don't
[1:18:24] touch this on the fields I bring this to
[1:18:26] the church for Paul addressed it to the
[1:18:28] Saints those that are called and
[1:18:30] preserved in our field and I set aside
[1:18:33] an hour in the Holy Spirit already in
[1:18:36] King this land he's trying to tell them
[1:18:38] the first thing get it out of your mind
[1:18:41] that you're gonna get lost and you're
[1:18:44] gonna do this up and you're scared it is
[1:18:49] when the brother talked about that last
[1:18:51] night God have not yet see some people
[1:18:54] think fear is something that's normal no
[1:18:57] fear is a spirit and God has not given
[1:19:01] you the spirit of fear but of love power
[1:19:05] and a sound mind
[1:19:07] all right let's go on a little further
[1:19:10] get out of your mind that you're gonna
[1:19:11] be lost
[1:19:12] that's you're gonna get lost you got to
[1:19:13] do this and you're scared of this don't
[1:19:14] be scared of nothing things trying to
[1:19:16] tell you where you're at who you are how
[1:19:18] you standing let me go right onto this
[1:19:20] next one here this is speak to this
[1:19:21] mountain speak to this mountain
[1:19:24] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:19:27] we're trying to bring a revelation to
[1:19:29] the sons of God a man here the the
[1:19:32] prophet makes this statement the Word of
[1:19:35] God is so infallible says that not one
[1:19:39] jot or tittle can ever fail and just on
[1:19:42] that much scripture we could base an
[1:19:45] eternity knowing that it would never
[1:19:49] fail all right and because it is a part
[1:19:53] of God God is in his word and we are
[1:19:56] noticed that how that it always happens
[1:19:59] no matter how strange it may seem but in
[1:20:01] God's own good time he makes every word
[1:20:03] testify Jesus when he was on I was here
[1:20:09] on earth the Scriptures cannot be broken
[1:20:13] iiiiii I got a I got a I got a just
[1:20:16] inject something there you know because
[1:20:20] when we talk about adoption I'm getting
[1:20:22] way ahead of myself but I'm gonna just
[1:20:23] repeat myself when I get to those know
[1:20:25] somebody just repeat it again all right
[1:20:27] but but when we talk about adoption we
[1:20:30] understand and and and I love the way
[1:20:33] that brother Ferguson brought the quote
[1:20:37] about the earnest of our adoption and
[1:20:39] the fullness all right there's a quote
[1:20:41] on that about the earnest and the
[1:20:44] fullness of adoption actually brings you
[1:20:46] to a body change that's the fullness of
[1:20:49] it okay
[1:20:49] but the earnest of it a man allows you
[1:20:54] to enjoy some of the benefits right now
[1:20:57] okay and and and and one of the things
[1:21:00] that that I know that the earnest is
[1:21:03] supposed to give me is I'm supposed to
[1:21:05] be able to a man stop sickness the
[1:21:10] earnest actually gives me that then I
[1:21:12] that's what the Prophet told me right as
[1:21:14] an adopted son
[1:21:16] I can stop sickness but not that quote
[1:21:18] that I just read a man said that on the
[1:21:22] Scriptures cannot be broken
[1:21:23] I was meditating on this because if I'm
[1:21:26] supposed as a as an adopted son of God
[1:21:28] be able to stop sickness every time I
[1:21:31] run into a sick person you know what I'm
[1:21:33] trying to do
[1:21:34] stop sickness but then I look at it
[1:21:37] saying that the sickness did stop
[1:21:39] does that mean I'm not adopted because
[1:21:43] the sickness didn't stop I'm supposed to
[1:21:45] stop sickness but that you know since
[1:21:48] the sicknesses since my word was not
[1:21:50] backed does that mean I'm not adopted
[1:21:54] sort of social artists begin to kind of
[1:21:57] deal with me a man on this and I begin
[1:22:00] to take we know Christ himself was
[1:22:03] adopted right brother branham brings it
[1:22:05] out Mount Transfiguration experience
[1:22:07] Christ Himself was adopted but Christ
[1:22:09] himself also had to go to the cross and
[1:22:12] when he went to the cross there was a
[1:22:14] time where Christ himself felt that the
[1:22:17] father had forsaken him while he's
[1:22:24] adopted he felt forsaken Oh I began to
[1:22:35] think about well why is it that when I
[1:22:37] pray for every sick person they're not
[1:22:39] heal because I'm as an adopted son I'm
[1:22:43] supposed to stop shake this what God
[1:22:48] just begin to show me I cannot break my
[1:22:51] own work and what anybody should say
[1:22:55] when I told Adam that day you eat
[1:22:58] thereof that day you will die then
[1:23:02] that's exactly what I meant and I cannot
[1:23:05] break my word sin brought death so so
[1:23:12] there's going to be times even in our
[1:23:14] placing there's going to be times where
[1:23:16] we don't see situations and we got to
[1:23:19] realize it's the will of God and it's
[1:23:21] the Word of God it does not mean that
[1:23:23] changes who we are
[1:23:27] with steel adopted sons and daughters of
[1:23:30] God oh my god let me just keep reading
[1:23:34] so I can go on amen Oh hallelujah
[1:23:38] scripture cannot be broken a man and see
[1:23:42] and see this is this is the thing of
[1:23:44] maturity that God is bringing us to
[1:23:45] because we will realize that when we're
[1:23:48] asking thing has got to be in the wheel
[1:23:50] and when I'm ain't got to be in the word
[1:23:52] you can't actually things outside the
[1:23:55] word even when Jesus even when Jesus you
[1:24:00] know begin to pray said by now he knew
[1:24:03] he knew father you know dude do I really
[1:24:07] have to drink in his cup this can pass
[1:24:09] you can change the situation hey new guy
[1:24:13] I mean he knew that that was possible
[1:24:15] but but he also knew that that they had
[1:24:17] to come to the place where it's like
[1:24:18] stop asking for a change in that
[1:24:21] situation because have there been no
[1:24:24] Calvary there would be no redemption for
[1:24:28] mankind can I can I say it this way
[1:24:30] had there been no Calvary we wouldn't be
[1:24:33] able to talk about adoption right so he
[1:24:39] realized that prayer changed from asking
[1:24:42] God to change to help change it and said
[1:24:45] Lord nevertheless not my will but your
[1:24:48] will be done
[1:24:49] that takes a surrender and then
[1:24:54] sometimes in our Christian walk God can
[1:24:55] require that of us it does not change
[1:24:58] who you are in Christ and I want to make
[1:25:02] it make it very clear we talk about
[1:25:03] adoption we're talking about a place in
[1:25:05] Christ I'm not talking a place in church
[1:25:07] there everybody you know and you know I
[1:25:10] I'm gonna just make it plain and
[1:25:12] couldn't even try to put it in brother
[1:25:13] branham even said it this way but I
[1:25:14] don't think he was leaving it there we
[1:25:17] try to put it on fivefold ministry the
[1:25:20] adoption is you know pastor evangelist
[1:25:23] teacher you know past I mean a hostile
[1:25:27] prophet well that just eliminated all
[1:25:29] the sisters all of them
[1:25:33] when if you put adoption they're placing
[1:25:36] there you just eliminated every sister
[1:25:38] it can't be there now that might be part
[1:25:42] of it but it's not ending there oh my
[1:25:46] god
[1:25:48] it came in there
[1:25:50] it's a place in Christ and I'm trying to
[1:25:53] get I'm trying to get there when a
[1:25:55] sister recognizes her place in Christ
[1:25:58] and why don't--why don't want to get one
[1:26:01] of your places I can tell you this right
[1:26:02] now sisters at one of your places is
[1:26:04] these signs shall follow them then that
[1:26:15] belief so them includes him and her
[1:26:23] these signs shall follow them let me
[1:26:28] give you another one they they shall lay
[1:26:34] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:26:38] Oh hallelujah and get off my notes nah
[1:26:43] this is the Bible right so so so so so
[1:26:49] so sister has the right ain't man to
[1:26:52] pray for somebody oh no yo no it's all
[1:26:57] about place it's all about where you act
[1:27:01] I know I know particular sister and then
[1:27:04] she felt the ministry she was sick with
[1:27:06] a certain sickness and I went I hear the
[1:27:08] a certain connection that other
[1:27:11] people that had the same sickness she
[1:27:13] wanted to go pray for so she went to
[1:27:16] husband would you go to the hospital
[1:27:17] with me so we can pray for these people
[1:27:21] nothing wrong with that my aunt T one
[1:27:26] time was in a hospital room there was a
[1:27:28] sister get ready to give birth to a baby

[1:27:37] did not have time to call the pastor she
[1:27:42] called on that name and right there on
[1:27:48] the spot she began to pray and rebuked
[1:27:51] that temple and and somehow Amen someway
[1:27:55] that baby was freed from that situation
[1:27:57] and came out okay she found her place in
[1:28:02] Christ and her place in Christ allows
[1:28:05] her to rebuke a devil to cast out Devils
[1:28:09] and when she prayed God backed up her
[1:28:13] prayer oh that's not the only time it
[1:28:16] happened you know remember one time in
[1:28:19] the meeting brother branham he's get

[1:29:36] just give up your seat pray for the baby
[1:29:40] she said ma'am I'm so sorry I've just
[1:29:42] got this thing on me and I don't know if
[1:29:45] it's a spirit of what I don't know what
[1:29:46] it is but I just feel late to pray for
[1:29:49] your baby do you mind me praying for the
[1:29:50] baby I don't know I know brother branham
[1:29:52] gonna pray for it I'm not you know
[1:29:53] trying to take anything from the Prophet
[1:29:55] you know what I'm saying I'm just adding
[1:29:57] to it a little bit I'm not trying to
[1:29:58] take anything from the Prophet right but
[1:30:00] I just feel led to pray for your baby
[1:30:03] ma'am I don't mind come on I would love
[1:30:06] for you to pray for the baby she pray
[1:30:09] for the baby and she once she prays she
[1:30:10] just got out of there went all the way
[1:30:12] up to the balcony brother Branham comes
[1:30:16] out preaches a sermon and after he
[1:30:19] preaches his sermon this baby come
[1:30:22] through and brother Branham said oh the
[1:30:24] baby's already healed yeah the baby's
[1:30:28] already here oh and what happened was
[1:30:31] there was a sister that was sitting here
[1:30:34] and she gave you a seat and oh she's
[1:30:36] sitting up there in the balcony and she
[1:30:40] prayed for the baby when she prayed for
[1:30:42] the baby the baby got healed and here's
[1:30:48] what the Prophet said the Prophet said
[1:30:50] had that lady not pray for the baby the
[1:30:53] same God that called her out to bless
[1:30:55] her it's the same God that would have
[1:30:57] called her out to rebuke her why didn't
[1:31:00] you pray for the baby right so so so so
[1:31:08] so so I mean that lady might not have
[1:31:11] realized but she was finding her place
[1:31:12] as a believer in Christ
[1:31:14] she had the authority to lay hands on
[1:31:18] the sick and they would recover brother
[1:31:20] branham operate exercise that too often
[1:31:23] times when he would pray for people in
[1:31:25] the north of against would get great he
[1:31:27] would actually tell people lay hands on
[1:31:32] your neighbor and there he would quote
[1:31:35] the scripture
[1:31:37] why because it was his job to turn the
[1:31:41] hearts of the people back to the water
[1:31:45] he was not trying to pull people to
[1:31:47] himself but he was trying to show us our
[1:31:50] place in the world oh my god
[1:31:57] all right let me go on a little further
[1:31:59] I got to finish reading this quote Jesus
[1:32:02] seen when he was here on earth the
[1:32:05] Scriptures cannot be broken and he said
[1:32:07] you destroy this body I'll raise it up
[1:32:09] in three days because it was based upon
[1:32:11] the scripture but David the prophet has
[1:32:13] said I will not suffer my Holy One to
[1:32:15] see corruption neither will I leave his
[1:32:16] soul and help
[1:32:17] he knew that stripped to pertain to him
[1:32:19] for the scripture was to the Messiah the
[1:32:22] Holy One and he knew his position and
[1:32:25] his standing in the kingdom see this is
[1:32:28] what we need to know the revelations got
[1:32:30] to break forth to us he knew his
[1:32:31] position and is standing in the kingdom
[1:32:33] that he was that person I know I know I
[1:32:38] got a lot of scriptures that pertain to
[1:32:40] me one of them the spirit and the bride
[1:32:44] say come and what the Prophet says that
[1:32:49] the spirit the brought the spirit the
[1:32:51] prophet and the bride would be saying
[1:32:52] the same thing oh my god let me go on I
[1:32:58] got to move on I got to it says he knew
[1:33:02] his position and his standing in the
[1:33:03] kingdom that he was that person so
[1:33:05] knowing that the Scriptures cannot be
[1:33:07] broken therefore he knew that within 72
[1:33:09] hours his body would have to raise again
[1:33:11] but the scripture cannot be broken
[1:33:13] many people wander he said that the
[1:33:15] three days and nights if you'll take it
[1:33:17] says within three days and nights he
[1:33:20] died on Friday afternoon was up on
[1:33:22] Sunday morning because not one cell of
[1:33:24] that precious body could cover up
[1:33:26] because the Word of God said it would
[1:33:27] not corrupt and he knew before
[1:33:29] corruption set in that he would raise
[1:33:31] from the earth that's putting confidence
[1:33:34] and what the word saying right you say
[1:33:37] if I knew there was a scripture that
[1:33:40] pertained to me like that I believe I
[1:33:44] could have the same thing
[1:33:46] but the Baron says well my beloved
[1:33:48] friends for
[1:33:50] divine promise in the Bible belongs to
[1:33:53] you and it's just as essential to you as
[1:33:56] it was to him you find one promise here
[1:34:00] that God has made and all the heavens
[1:34:02] and earth will pass away before that
[1:34:04] promise would ever fail to act in your
[1:34:07] stead oh I love this because it's to the
[1:34:11] believer who so ever will may come in
[1:34:15] partake of these blessings let me go a
[1:34:18] little further now I think that the one
[1:34:21] main thing that causes us to miss the
[1:34:24] blessings and remember faith cometh by
[1:34:30] hearing hearing of the word of God and
[1:34:32] the reason we missed it is because we
[1:34:35] don't feed on it enough you know there
[1:34:44] you go
[1:34:45] it's on the tapes it's in the boots it's
[1:34:48] also Oh help us let me be careful when I
[1:34:53] say this you gotta know who feeding you
[1:35:02] you gotta know who's feeding you right
[1:35:06] because if they not feeding you this
[1:35:08] you're never developed into this if the
[1:35:15] attention is solely put on the Prophet
[1:35:19] and no attention on the bride we have to
[1:35:24] understand the prophets role by
[1:35:27] scripture you can understand it the
[1:35:29] Prophet was Elysa
[1:35:32] he went to find a Rebecca Rebecca was in
[1:35:37] the world and she heard it oh my god you
[1:35:41] know I mean Indian armor I got now imma
[1:35:44] imma just let me just make one little
[1:35:46] comment here before I go into the head
[1:35:48] Rebecca was Rebecca's in the world a man
[1:35:52] right and she heard from Eliezer Rebecca
[1:35:57] could have been in the church and she
[1:35:59] heard from Ellie's
[1:36:01] hallelujah and what went out what
[1:36:03] brother brand I'm saying I can't find it
[1:36:05] right here it's what I just I just have
[1:36:07] to quote it off memory I think I might
[1:36:09] have it wrong but it's something like
[1:36:10] this he said the word and you connect it
[1:36:13] with the word right so so when you heard
[1:36:16] the word you connected with the word no
[1:36:18] matter where you were you could have
[1:36:20] been in the world but when you hurt the
[1:36:22] word you connected with the world you
[1:36:26] could have been a denominational
[1:36:27] churches when you heard the word
[1:36:29] you want you connect it with the word
[1:36:33] how I mean up right in the word is still
[1:36:37] speaking today calling people out of
[1:36:40] situations and circumstances calling
[1:36:44] them into life when we record hurts like
[1:36:48] not now wait a minute this man prayed
[1:36:49] what prayed that you know that the woman
[1:36:54] that would come and offer acts for water
[1:36:56] that she's not only give me water but
[1:36:57] give water to my camels and when she
[1:37:00] heard that's like none that just struck
[1:37:01] something else now who is your master
[1:37:03] y'all evidently have a praying house if
[1:37:07] the servant is out praying like
[1:37:09] evidently supernatural things that
[1:37:11] happen in your house and I can just
[1:37:13] imagine maybe Eliezer neither what the
[1:37:17] scripture don't say this but I'm
[1:37:18] thinking that while he was there at the
[1:37:20] house maybe he getting up and begin to
[1:37:22] break in on some things said Abraham and
[1:37:25] Sarah could not have a son and God just
[1:37:30] so happened to bless him in their old
[1:37:33] age he he renewed their youth he changed
[1:37:36] the inside and all of a sudden Isaac
[1:37:40] came forth and this Isaac was considered
[1:37:43] the promised son waited 25 years from
[1:37:46] and in Rebekah saying I don't know how
[1:37:48] long I've been waiting for Isaac but
[1:37:50] this sounds like the man that I want to
[1:37:53] marry I ain't never seen him before but
[1:37:56] his testimony she fell in love with the
[1:38:01] testimony
[1:38:02] so we ought to be fun in love with the
[1:38:05] testimonies of our Lord and saviors
[1:38:08] doing in our niche hallelujah
[1:38:12] we've never laid eyes on him but I fell
[1:38:14] in love with the testimonies and every
[1:38:17] time the profit was shared testimony it
[1:38:19] caused me to go deeper and deeper in
[1:38:22] love he did what
[1:38:26] oh that sounds like my that's sound like
[1:38:29] my Savior that sound like my Jesus oh I
[1:38:33] want to know him he what brother Branham
[1:38:36] was the LEDs that introduced us to the
[1:38:41] Lord Jesus Christ so the emphasis is on
[1:38:44] Christ always on Christ
[1:38:48] always I put the emphasis there praise
[1:38:52] the Lord I can't put it in anywhere else
[1:38:55] it's got to be on Christ hallelujah oh
[1:38:59] thank you Jesus all right all right let
[1:39:02] me uh so we don't feed on it enough the
[1:39:05] reason that we're missing some of these
[1:39:07] things is that we don't feed on enough
[1:39:08] the reason that we're not experiencing
[1:39:09] some of the things that we should be
[1:39:11] experiencing because we don't feed on
[1:39:13] enough now I'm gonna tell you something
[1:39:14] you know you start the sermons like this
[1:39:17] start coming forth or meeting like this
[1:39:19] come forth and and the people get to
[1:39:21] start talking about it more and more I'm
[1:39:24] gonna tell you the presence of God will
[1:39:25] start drawing near that you know how
[1:39:28] Hattie Wright got what she acts for
[1:39:30] because they were talking about things
[1:39:32] oh my god they were talking about the
[1:39:36] right things amen and and if we start
[1:39:39] talking about him a little bit more his
[1:39:41] presence would draw near and what we're
[1:39:44] doing with coming to a revelation and
[1:39:46] understanding of who we are as sons and
[1:39:48] daughters of God there's not many people
[1:39:50] that can even go out and have the
[1:39:51] conversations that y'all have they can't
[1:39:53] even quote the things that sell quote
[1:39:55] can't even do that I mean you start
[1:39:57] talking to them about it they like where
[1:39:59] you from where you get that from where
[1:40:02] you heard that right
[1:40:03] they have no idea and here you hear you
[1:40:07] you hear you sitting in the restaurant
[1:40:10] right ready to shout right ready to chop
[1:40:14] I mean and they seem like these people
[1:40:17] have lost a man no no no yeah well we
[1:40:20] did we lost our mind but we gain the
[1:40:23] mind of Christ and we know we're not
[1:40:27] citizens of this kingdom we're from
[1:40:31] another kingdom pilgrims passing through
[1:40:34] Oh hallelujah amen so let me just count
[1:40:39] on let me talk about this just uh let me
[1:40:44] finish this quote and I got it I got it
[1:40:46] I got a dis leave a couple things here
[1:40:47] this so we don't feed on enough that's
[1:40:49] what says we don't feel enough Jesus
[1:40:51] that man should not live by bread alone
[1:40:52] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:40:54] the mouth of God man should have his
[1:40:55] daily bread by the Word of God but we
[1:40:58] try to make it more or less some far-off
[1:41:00] promise way away in some other age but
[1:41:03] the Bible says now are we the sons of
[1:41:07] God not we will be amen we are now right
[1:41:13] and God has not made it complicated and
[1:41:16] many people try to think it's that way
[1:41:18] that is complicated therefore they miss
[1:41:20] the real blessing of the word by trying
[1:41:23] to make it some hard thing and my
[1:41:25] purpose in these next 10 or 15 minutes
[1:41:28] is to reveal to you the best that I can
[1:41:31] by his blessed word that God is not
[1:41:34] complicated in any way the believer
[1:41:36] makes it complicated God makes it simple
[1:41:39] now you know I was I was talking about
[1:41:41] you know this the the earnest of our
[1:41:43] adoption and the fullness for of our
[1:41:45] adoption little earlier and their their
[1:41:49] statements you know and it women when we
[1:41:51] understand that we're walking in the
[1:41:53] earnest of our adoption we can actually
[1:41:56] decay declare of that and you have to be
[1:41:58] careful with this let me let me be very
[1:42:00] careful let me be giving very careful
[1:42:02] with this I love the way brother to Cosi
[1:42:05] brought around last night when we talk
[1:42:07] about being adopted right he said that
[1:42:11] it's a public show right it's something
[1:42:15] that that God does himself in the image
[1:42:17] and it becomes a public show and and he
[1:42:19] actually I don't know how many caught up
[1:42:21] a brother to Cocoa she actually made
[1:42:24] the same statement that I made on
[1:42:26] Wednesday night right and what he said
[1:42:29] is he started talking about how job do
[1:42:31] things publicly and he said even your
[1:42:33] critics for your enemies will recognize
[1:42:38] what God has done for you
[1:42:40] right and I have shared this on the
[1:42:42] always night Elijah let me let me let me
[1:42:48] read something just turn on your second
[1:42:51] first Kings 18 I want to make sure I get
[1:42:56] this just right
[1:42:57] first Kings 18 let me let me let me oh
[1:43:02] god I can I could take off but I can't
[1:43:05] take off I can but I can't
[1:43:11] I feel constrained Oh glory to God this
[1:43:16] is I think its first oh I'm in 1st

[1:43:39] Elijah challenged the the false prophets
[1:43:44] the prophets of bale each are challenged
[1:43:47] in now let's let's watch something and
[1:43:49] and I'm leading it I want to lead in
[1:43:51] with this statement we understand that
[1:43:54] not one of us would have the same
[1:43:57] Ministry of brother branham we
[1:44:01] understand that we won't understand why
[1:44:06] let's read this right here in the
[1:44:09] scripture so first Kings 18 verse 36 and
[1:44:11] it came to pass at the time of the
[1:44:13] offering of the evening sacrifice but
[1:44:16] Elijah the Prophet came near said Lord
[1:44:19] God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let
[1:44:22] it be known this day that thou art God
[1:44:24] in Israel that I am thy servant and that
[1:44:26] I have done all these things at thy word
[1:44:28] key verse right here hear me o Lord now
[1:44:31] notice his prayer you got to watch what
[1:44:34] a person is saying in the prayer alright
[1:44:37] hear me o Lord hear me that this people
[1:44:40] may know that thou art the Lord God and
[1:44:43] that thou has turned their heart back
[1:44:45] again Elijah says this in his prayer so
[1:44:54] Elijah had a responsibility to turn the
[1:44:59] hearts of the people back to God there
[1:45:04] was Elijah the first prophets huh hey
[1:45:09] Leah enero and when the fourth anointing
[1:45:12] of Elijah comes the same anointing
[1:45:16] according to maritime four is the turn
[1:45:20] the hearts of the people of a top of
[1:45:24] Barnabas
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:27] so that's why we know nobody will ever
[1:45:31] have that ministry because that ministry
[1:45:35] turns our hearts are the people back so
[1:45:38] god nobody can do that but him but but
[1:45:46] even though he had that responsibility
[1:45:50] Eli sure looked at it and said I'm not
[1:45:57] trying to turn about a heart back that's
[1:46:00] not what I'm here to do you already did
[1:46:02] that I respect that but the same God
[1:46:05] that was moving in your life and in any
[1:46:11] life jaar yes Eli shut up what will you
[1:46:16] have
[1:46:17] for me before I go what will you have me
[1:46:20] to do he said well you you you you ask
[1:46:22] now i'ma tell you i'ma take say I want a
[1:46:25] double portion of your spirit and he
[1:46:29] lied to look at it it's not even
[1:46:31] expecting an answer he said you have
[1:46:33] asked the hard thing
[1:46:36] you actually whole thing I don't know
[1:46:38] how are we gonna do this he said but
[1:46:39] nevertheless and let me taste them
[1:46:42] Eli shall receive this promise because
[1:46:46] he was willing to stay with the word if
[1:46:53] he lied to his private discussion but
[1:46:55] because Elijah I'm gonna follow you to
[1:46:58] Bethel
[1:46:58] i'ma following the Guildhall I'm a
[1:47:01] father you know Jordan where do you go
[1:47:04] ama keep my eyes on you and because he's
[1:47:06] day with the while he received a double
[1:47:10] portion and notice this when he got the
[1:47:17] double portion how many people even
[1:47:19] start come here what feeling what
[1:47:22] emotion was there
[1:47:24] what cry what's here what what jumper
[1:47:28] sure what happened nothing happened but
[1:47:31] the situation presented itself and he
[1:47:37] walked down the Troy and said I can't
[1:47:40] walk across it and I saw how he later
[1:47:43] came across and I'm gonna take the same
[1:47:46] mantle when he got the manatees he
[1:47:52] looked at the roller took the mantle
[1:47:54] where is the Lord
[1:47:57] Donna me lamb chop and when he spoke it
[1:48:01] God the waters parted
[1:48:05] Riley and his critics were there it was
[1:48:13] a public testimony his critics were
[1:48:16] there he is not the claim is adoption
[1:48:19] the great said when they saw the water
[1:48:24] back up 50 of them the spirit of Elijah
[1:48:31] death rest on a Lysa
[1:48:36] [Applause]
[1:48:49] when the critics can say that then you
[1:48:53] know you don't accomplish something but
[1:48:55] then you still stay humble before God
[1:48:58] because they know where to go when you
[1:49:00] look at these lashes ministry they know
[1:49:01] exactly where to go something happen
[1:49:03] they go to you Liza
[1:49:06] you know your testimony as soon as
[1:49:09] something happened God has done too much
[1:49:10] in our church was not to be sharing
[1:49:12] testimonies but as soon as something
[1:49:14] happened the reason people are asking
[1:49:16] you to pray first let me say it to two
[1:49:21] things is good that you bring the prayer
[1:49:23] requests but I'm looking for one day the
[1:49:25] praise report let me make it clear the
[1:49:29] praise report is before apps up not just
[1:49:32] I takes it my church we pray for you no
[1:49:34] no no you know what let's pray about
[1:49:37] that right now
[1:49:38] you take the responsibility you pray and
[1:49:42] have them testify to you like they did
[1:49:45] with sister Michele right I mean she
[1:49:48] stopped and prayed and they say the lady
[1:49:50] went to the hospital was released just
[1:49:52] like that and they come telling her how
[1:49:55] her prayer changed things when you find
[1:49:57] your place in Christ you can do them
[1:50:00] things so rather than a play a prayer
[1:50:02] request let it be a praise report we
[1:50:04] stopped we prayed and and that's what
[1:50:07] happened we just want to give God the
[1:50:10] glory I'm not trying to make myself
[1:50:11] nothing and and let me tell you when you
[1:50:14] give it a test run it don't don't even
[1:50:15] say well I'm not trying to make my
[1:50:17] suddenly we already know that we already
[1:50:21] know that you ain't nothing anyway ain't
[1:50:25] none of us nothing we were 80%
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:41] but it's fine in our place in price and
[1:50:44] realizing that we have this authority as
[1:50:46] sons and daughters of God we're carrying
[1:50:50] on the ministry brother branham's not
[1:50:51] here we've heard the testimonies they
[1:50:53] should awaken something in us if you get
[1:50:57] into the Colorado storm and God tell you
[1:50:59] to turn around and go back we'll go
[1:51:00] speak to it now the Prophet was also
[1:51:04] running to he was running from the
[1:51:09] killable he was looking for his gun huh
[1:51:13] so so he tells us just as a just human
[1:51:17] nature was kicking in when that brother
[1:51:21] saw Cheryl talk about how they coming to
[1:51:24] them a nest of bees oh and he told son
[1:51:28] just don't fear I said no no no no
[1:51:30] brother I heard that testimony folk it
[1:51:32] once stayed exactly the same where you
[1:51:34] said it but I heard that before that
[1:51:37] tell me that Jesus Christ is the same

[1:51:56] anybody I'm adopted but we are walking
[1:51:59] in the earnest of it right we're walking
[1:52:02] in earnest and like I said with witness
[1:52:04] the public on public display your
[1:52:07] critics will testify for you when
[1:52:11] there's a situation they can't deal with
[1:52:13] it a church do you know how to deal with
[1:52:15] brother Branham one man that can't

[1:52:22] couldn't get it next Church it you need
[1:52:24] to go see brother Branham it ought to be
[1:52:25] the same way now because the Spirit of

[1:53:39] to keep your healing now we're talking
[1:53:42] something different you want to know why
[1:53:45] things come back on your body because
[1:53:49] you want serving God that we use for the
[1:53:50] surgery Oh God uses our sickness
[1:53:56] sometime to drive us into his presence

[1:54:01] night you know your worst situation is
[1:54:05] Gerren I beat your best so listen the
[1:54:11] earnest of adoption brother Brown say
[1:54:13] the earnest is is the down payment it's
[1:54:15] something to hold it all right he said
[1:54:19] divine healing is the earnest of the
[1:54:21] redemption of our eyes okay and it says
[1:54:24] he says another statement says we are
[1:54:26] now drawing on their earnest of our
[1:54:29] salvation now in his day he gave an
[1:54:33] example of evil one to buy a car and you
[1:54:36] all you had was the earnest money to
[1:54:38] down payment say now you can hold the
[1:54:40] car and his day in his day you could
[1:54:43] give if the car cost three thousand you
[1:54:45] went and gave the man five hundred he
[1:54:46] will hold the car till you pay the rest
[1:54:48] of it off and then you take the car wing
[1:54:50] but it's a new day it's a new day right
[1:54:53] back then they didn't have no debt
[1:54:55] problems like that you either had it you
[1:54:57] didn't have it but
[1:54:58] not because of credit because of credit
[1:55:02] you can actually give a down payment and
[1:55:04] they still only come but they give you
[1:55:07] the benefits of driving the vehicle and
[1:55:12] showing the beat and they don't even
[1:55:14] give you no limitations you can go as
[1:55:16] far as you want to go long as you make
[1:55:19] the payment the day you stop making the
[1:55:22] payment is the day they come get that
[1:55:24] cop but as long as you making the
[1:55:26] payment till you pay it off you can
[1:55:28] enjoy full benefits and what I'm saying
[1:55:30] is until we get our body change
[1:55:33] I won't take enjoy full benefits of
[1:55:37] adoption another statement that profit
[1:55:45] makes you say the earnest means more is
[1:55:49] yet to come

[1:55:57] and I mean I'm just giving you just a
[1:56:00] little statement see me we're promised
[1:56:02] that true stars feel some born sons will

[1:56:10] brother needed rain for his crops that
[1:56:11] we could give him rain I'm looking for
[1:56:16] that we're promised that we will stop
[1:56:19] sickness and disease is saying that's
[1:56:23] the power to bind and loose guess what
[1:56:25] I'm looking for that we promise to have
[1:56:28] checkbook authority
[1:56:30] our names are supposed to be as good as
[1:56:34] the father's name on the check now you
[1:56:37] want to know why your name is as good as
[1:56:39] the father's name because everything in
[1:56:43] heaven and everything in the earth is
[1:56:46] named what if your name has changed oh
[1:56:53] my then your name is as good as the
[1:56:57] father's name because you've actually

[1:57:27] want to read this adoption part for now
[1:57:33] this mean this may just choke you to
[1:57:35] death but did you know that men that are
[1:57:43] sons of God are a mature garden men that
[1:57:50] are sons of God are not will be are are
[1:57:55] a mature God's says how many ever know
[1:57:59] that now you know can you imagine a
[1:58:01] prophet sitting there preaching this and
[1:58:03] they like I never heard preaching like
[1:58:05] that in my life men that are sons of God
[1:58:10] are amateur God's how many ever know
[1:58:12] that how many knows that Jesus said so
[1:58:14] the Bible the Bible Jesus said did not
[1:58:16] your law say itself that you are God's
[1:58:20] and if you call them gods which God said
[1:58:23] in Genesis 2 that they were cows because
[1:58:26] they were had full domain over the
[1:58:29] Dominion of the world he gave him
[1:58:32] dominion over all things and he lost his
[1:58:35] God ship he lost his sonship he lost his
[1:58:41] domain and Satan took it over but look
[1:58:43] at this but brother we are waiting for
[1:58:47] the manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:58:52] will come back and take it over again
[1:58:56] now that's why I said not just let up
[1:58:58] said my say the revelation of son of God
[1:59:00] because when the revelation finally
[1:59:02] strike us we don't stop letting the
[1:59:04] devil do everything that he's doing
[1:59:06] right when the revelations frankerz we
[1:59:09] don't go back and take it the devil

[2:00:30] fool sums of got will be manifested when
[2:00:33] the power got we'll walk out and
[2:00:34] hallelujah will take every power that
[2:00:37] sentence got away from him yes sir

[2:00:40] manifested son of God all right let me
[2:00:42] go and I got another one here Oh glory
[2:00:47] you know there was one here I got to
[2:00:50] find it because I I was listening to the
[2:00:52] tape and brother branham said this and I
[2:00:54] said no I got to read that for the
[2:00:56] church oh I got a couple of that I need
[2:00:59] to read but y'all just bear with me I
[2:01:01] feel yes this one adoption part 385 this
[2:01:06] is that's the one I want now
[2:01:07] adoption correct part three part I mean
[2:01:09] the quote number 85 adoption placing
[2:01:14] positionally where they at show me where
[2:01:17] they're at God calling his children
[2:01:19] aside by manifestation
[2:01:22] they don't have to say one word about it
[2:01:25] so you're apt to say nothing about it
[2:01:27] but your critics would know it right
[2:01:29] they don't have to say one word about it
[2:01:31] you see something's happened
[2:01:32] positionally placing placing his son
[2:01:34] getting him and to order just exactly
[2:01:37] what the same things and he's just as in
[2:01:40] much authority his word it's just as
[2:01:44] good as an arc angel oh yeah I don't
[2:01:48] know who y'all are your words AXA for
[2:01:52] money say just as good as an archangel
[2:01:54] then he says better that means your
[2:01:57] words are greater than the arc angels
[2:02:00] words you realize how much power you
[2:02:04] have inside of you
[2:02:07] that's so much power that you can create
[2:02:09] your own world and go live on it
[2:02:14] your words are more greater than an
[2:02:17] archangel the son was adopted put on a
[2:02:23] place set out there changes rule changes
[2:02:25] colors the father had a ceremony this is
[2:02:28] my son ferments fourth he's governor
[2:02:29] he's the ruler he's over all my heritage
[2:02:31] all I got to belong all I got belongs to
[2:02:33] him that's right
[2:02:34] okay now let me oh my I'm just there's
[2:02:42] one other little statement I think imma
[2:02:43] have to just I'm gonna have to cut it
[2:02:45] and bring it back I got so much more
[2:02:47] here to read y'all just bet let me give
[2:02:49] you this one last one a man and then I'm
[2:02:52] a lord have mercy lord have mercy
[2:03:03] thank you brother Jeff this read me up
[2:03:07] mother cuz I got just I just need to
[2:03:13] show you a couple things right alright
[2:03:15] here here here's our out of Patmos
[2:03:17] vision because you know and let me just
[2:03:20] kind of set this one up when we when we
[2:03:23] put a lot of emphasis on the Prophet and
[2:03:25] not on the on both the prophet and the
[2:03:27] bride cuz its period in the bride right
[2:03:28] spirit prophet in the bride they're
[2:03:29] gonna say the same thing and we're not
[2:03:31] going to say anything outside of what
[2:03:32] the Prophet said but but when we just
[2:03:34] put it all in a prophet not get give you
[2:03:36] know credit where you know hey y'all got
[2:03:38] something to do with this - right
[2:03:40] so when we do that we kind of miss some
[2:03:43] things here and and and they're you know
[2:03:46] like like like there's a statement that
[2:03:48] was made brother Brandon was told when
[2:03:52] he went to the other side oh that you
[2:03:55] love and all that ever love you I have
[2:03:59] given to you and people say well that
[2:04:01] was to the Prophet I understand you God
[2:04:06] did said to the Prophet but when he said
[2:04:08] it
[2:04:08] through the Prophet to me the secret
[2:04:11] things belong to Lord our God
[2:04:13] but once they're revealed then they
[2:04:18] belong to me so I take that same promise
[2:04:21] hallelujah right if I got a love when I
[2:04:24] mix back I wondered I love I'm expected
[2:04:27] in the be on the other side see the
[2:04:29] Prophet God allowed me to look into
[2:04:32] another realm to see certain things he
[2:04:34] could come back and three of things that
[2:04:36] he's thought because we believe our
[2:04:38] hearts can be comforted now let me just
[2:04:42] give you this cold out of Patmos vision
[2:04:44] couple more listening this comfort this
[2:04:47] comfort is not for the seven church age
[2:04:50] messengers only
[2:04:58] discomfort I'm just reading you what the
[2:05:01] profits in this discomfort is not for
[2:05:07] the seven church age lesson just only
[2:05:11] every true believer is in the hands of
[2:05:16] God and can draw oh my god the artist of
[2:05:23] our of our adoption we can drop right

[2:07:01] benefit of all that God is to the
[2:07:06] believer what God gives the messenger
[2:07:09] and how he blesses and uses the
[2:07:16] messenger is an example

[2:12:58] you know who just prayed for you
[2:13:07] led by the spirit go pray and just move
[2:13:09] on and Jesus prayed and moved on and the
[2:13:13] man was so dumbfounded as they make the
