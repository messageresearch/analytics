[32:04] Lord, that we should we could be saved,
[32:06] Lord. And we want to tell you thank you,
[32:08] Lord. We thank you almighty God that you

[32:17] this time. We thank you Lord God for
[32:19] hearts that can believe and eyes that
[32:22] can see ears to hear Lord Jesus what the

[32:28] prepared a servant Lord to bring your
[32:30] word this morning. Father we're ready to

[32:34] that you would anoint him aresh Lord as
[32:37] you have prepared his heart and place a
[32:38] message in his heart Lord. May you speak
[32:41] through his lips Lord that we we all may
[32:43] hear and believe. And father we pray
[32:46] over the giving Lord Jesus. You have
[32:47] blessed us each one Lord God and we have

[32:52] have a promise Lord. You said you would
[32:54] open the windows of heaven Lord and pour
[32:56] out a blessing there wouldn't be room to
[32:58] receive and you would rebuke the devour
[33:00] for our sakes Lord. We believe that,
[33:02] Lord God, and we expect it, Lord,
[33:04] because you said so. And Father God, we
[33:07] just ask that you use the the tithing
[33:09] offering for the up upuilding of the
[33:11] kingdom, Lord God, and you'll continue
[33:13] to bless the givers. We pray. Have your

[33:18] ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Theres,

[42:54] YES.
[43:06] It is the sweetest. It is the sweetest
[43:11] name
[43:13] I know.
[43:19] Somebody give him praise in this place.

[43:31] somebody. Say, "So good to see you in

[45:52] midst of the people of God and and and
[45:54] there's uh something that I I do um just
[45:58] in my own way that I try to get all the
[46:01] ministers scheduled. We got uh six other
[46:04] preachers here in the church. So, it's
[46:06] hard to get everybody in, but I thank
[46:09] God for uh God God's gi given us these

[49:35] Father God. Oh Lord, just heal where
[49:38] there's healing needed. Oh father God,
[49:40] deliver where deliverance is needed. Oh
[49:42] father God, in Jesus name we pray.

[49:51] to see everyone. Amen. See we had a
[49:54] church everyone had a wonderful
[49:56] Thanksgiving.
[49:57] It's good to see all the saints. Amen.
[50:00] This got a meeting kind of atmosphere in
[50:03] here. I kind of wanted to come out the
[50:06] back.
[50:08] Jack was talking about a Jericho march
[50:10] and shouting, "Listen, my feet just
[50:12] getting right from last week.
[50:15] Got to let me know. I bring my tennis
[50:17] shoes."
[50:19] I shout it so much last week. I went
[50:21] home said, "Oh, I need my feet rub." My
[50:23] wife said, "Uhuh. We ain't falling for
[50:25] that one."
[50:28] Amen. She precious. I appreciate my
[50:31] wife.
[50:33] Just thought I would say that.
[50:38] My rib, she's uh she's a good wife to
[50:40] me. Take care. Amen. We won't prolong
[50:44] the time. Try to get through this real
[50:47] quick. Maybe we have some time for some
[50:50] of these uh gifts as brother Jack was
[50:52] saying. Real quickly, let's turn to
[50:54] Matthew 18 and 12.
[50:58] Amen. and uh
[51:00] read a couple of scriptures. Let the
[51:02] Lord have his way. We see what the Lord
[51:04] going to do. Amen.
[51:10] Matthew 18:12 reads, "For the Son of Man
[51:13] has come to save
[51:15] that which is lost.
[51:18] How think ye, if a man have a hund
[51:22] sheep, and one of them be gone astray,
[51:26] do he not leave the 90 and nine, and
[51:30] goeth into the mountains, and seeketh
[51:34] that which is gone astray.
[51:39] And if so be that he find it, verily I
[51:43] say unto you, he rejoicth
[51:46] more of that sheep than the 90 and nine
[51:52] which went not astray. Even so is not
[51:57] the the will of your father
[52:02] which is in heaven that one of these
[52:05] little ones should perish. Moreover, if
[52:08] thy brother shall trespass against thee,
[52:14] go and tell him his fault between thee
[52:19] and him alone. If he shall hear thee,
[52:23] thou has gained a brother.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:29] You may be seated. May a blessing to the
[52:31] reading of his word.
[52:33] Amen.
[52:35] I also want to just look at another
[52:37] scripture here
[52:39] in Samuel 2 Samuel 12
[52:44] 1-7
[52:48] and it says
[52:50] and the Lord sent Nathan unto David
[52:54] and he came unto him and said unto him
[52:58] there were two men
[53:01] and one in the city,
[53:05] the one rich, the other poor.
[53:08] The rich man had exceeding great many
[53:10] flocks and and herds, but the poor man
[53:14] had nothing
[53:16] saved the little u lamb,
[53:19] which he had brought and nourished up,
[53:23] and it grew up together with him, and
[53:27] with his children. It did eat and his
[53:30] own uh
[53:33] of eat of his own meat and drank of his
[53:35] own cup and lay in his bosom
[53:40] and was unto him as a daughter. And
[53:45] there came a traveler unto the rich man,
[53:47] and he spared
[53:50] to take his own
[53:54] And there came a traveler unto the rich
[53:56] man. And he spared to take his own flock
[53:58] and of uh and of his own herd to dress
[54:02] for the wayfairing man that was come
[54:06] unto him. But the flock but took the
[54:09] poor man's lamb and dressed it for the
[54:12] man and was and for the man that was
[54:17] come to him.
[54:19] And David anger was greatly kindled
[54:22] against the man. And he said to Nathan,
[54:25] "As the Lord liveth, the man that hath
[54:29] done this thing shall surely die."
[54:33] Amen.
[54:34] Not realizing that David was speaking of
[54:38] himself.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] I want to title this this morning
[54:45] broken bones.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Broken bones. Amen. And uh
[54:53] the Bible says that all we
[54:57] like sheep
[54:59] have gone astray.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; So this passage of scripture is
[55:05] basically speaking to every one of us.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Because we've all had different
[55:12] situations in our lives.
[55:15] Amen. But that that have
[55:19] appeared as broken broken bones.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; We are uh reminded
[55:28] that
[55:30] every son and daughter of God must be
[55:33] tried and tested.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all pray for me this morning.
[55:40] Uh if we go on to read here the sixth
[55:43] verse
[55:44] says and he shall restore the lamb
[55:48] four-fold
[55:49] because he did this thing and because he
[55:53] had no pity.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Pity is an emotional state of anger
[56:00] against the rich man. And he's not
[56:03] showing any pity either because he has
[56:07] just pronounced a death sentence
[56:11] &gt;&gt; to the man. Amen. That Samuel WAS
[56:16] TALKING ABOUT NOT KNOWING it was him.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, HE HAD NO compassion
[56:24] &gt;&gt; for the for for the man and what he was
[56:26] going through.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; If we read on, Amen. back in the
[56:32] scripture I just read about uh all of
[56:35] the the the sheep that went astray.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And then if YOU GO ON FURTHER, HE'S
[56:41] TALKING ABOUT IF ANY MAN OFFENDS THEE,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; YOU GO AFTER him
[56:47] &gt;&gt; or her. Right.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; SEE, BECAUSE UH ONCE YOU BECOME A
[56:52] CHRISTIAN,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU UH UH UH WE'LL GET INTO IT A
[56:58] LITTLE LATER, BUT I'M GOING TO JUST GO
[56:59] AHEAD AND PREACH THIS MORNING IF that's
[57:01] all right.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; See, YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU BECOME A
[57:05] CHRISTIAN AND YOU TEAR DOWN, AMEN, THE
[57:07] BRIDGES BEHIND YOU.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL
[57:11] YOU THIS MORNING IS ONCE YOU GET YOUR
[57:13] MIND MADE UP,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND YOU STOP BECOMING JUST A
[57:18] CASUAL CHRISTIAN.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU YOU YOU YOU
[57:23] GOT A MADEUP MIND AND YOU'RE GETTING
[57:25] SERIOUS WITH GOD.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; SEE, SOME SOME OF US ARE JUST CASUAL
[57:29] CHRISTIANS.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE COME TO CHURCH WHEN IT'S
[57:32] CONVENIENT.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE COME AMEN. OUT OF TRADITION.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THERE'S REALLY NO BURNING IN
[57:41] THE HEART.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE THINGS OF GOD.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. AMEN. BUT THERE'LL BE COME A
[57:48] TIME, AMEN, THAT A PERSON, AMEN, REALLY
[57:52] GET SOMETHING DOWN ON THE INSIDE. AMEN.
[57:55] AND THEIR ATTITUDE CHANGES.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO SEE THEM UH ON THOSE
[58:03] UH PROPPED UP SERVICES. AMEN. YOU BEGIN
[58:06] TO SEE THEM MORE OFTEN IN THE SANCTUARY.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU BEGIN TO SEE DIFFERENT CHANGES
[58:13] ABOUT THEM. AMEN. BUT SEE, THIS IS THE
[58:16] VERY TIME, AMEN, THAT THE DEVIL IS
[58:19] TAKING NOTICE.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; HE CUZ SEE, HE DON'T MIND YOU BEING JUST
[58:23] A CASUAL CHRISTIAN
[58:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID IF YOU'RE
[58:26] LUKEWARM, AMEN, HE'LL SPEW YOU OUT OF
[58:29] HIS MOUTH.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, WHEN YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND,
[58:36] YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY GOOD.
[58:39] CASUAL CHRISTIANS, THEY DON'T HAVE
[58:41] CHALLENGES LIKE AMEN. UH THE REST OF THE
[58:45] CHRISTIANS DO.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. BECAUSE WHEN
[58:52] YOU BECOME A A SOLD OUT BELIEVER, THE
[58:57] DEVIL HAS A TARGET ON YOU.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID, AMEN. THAT EVERY
[59:04] BELIEVER MUST BE TRIED
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and tested.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. AMEN.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; THINK IT NOT STRANGE THESE FIERY TRIALS
[59:13] THAT WE go through.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; SO, IN THIS SECTION, WE'RE LOOKING AT
[59:18] DAVID.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm GOING TO READ ON HERE SAYS UH IN
[59:22] IN IN 51, Psalms 51
[59:26] 5-8,
[59:29] he says, "BEHOLD,
[59:32] I was shaped in iniquity."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; And in sin did my MOTHER CONCEIVE THEE.
[59:39] BECAUSE SEE, REVELATION BEGIN TO COME TO
[59:42] DAVID. WHY? BECAUSE THE PROPHET SAMUEL
[59:45] GO ON DOWN THERE IN THE SEVENTH VERSE.
[59:48] AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID, "THOU
[59:51] &gt;&gt; ART THE MAN."
[59:55] &gt;&gt; DAVID KNEW WHAT HE HAD DONE,
[59:58] &gt;&gt; BUT IT JUST DIDN'T DAWN ON HIM
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE HAD REALLY DONE.
[1:00:06] YEAH.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; SO, A PROPHET CAME AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A
[1:00:12] PARABLE. Y'ALL STAY WITH ME HERE.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; SPOKE TO HIM IN A PARABLE. AMEN. SO THAT
[1:00:18] HE HE HE WOULD WALK INTO THE THING AND
[1:00:20] HIS EYES ARE OPEN AND THEN HIT HIM WITH
[1:00:23] THE BOMBSHELL. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU
[1:00:25] THIS MORNING.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; SO, I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME THIS
[1:00:32] MORNING BECAUSE I MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT
[1:00:34] SOMEBODY right here.
[1:00:40] Amen.

[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:00:43] David
[1:00:46] began
[1:00:47] to think on his ways.
[1:00:50] David
[1:00:52] said here, "BEHOLD,
[1:00:56] I was shapen in iniquity,
[1:00:59] and in sin did my mother conceive thee,
[1:01:03] CONCEIVE ME. BEHOLD, THY DESIRES TRUTH
[1:01:06] in my inward parts.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST ON THE SURFACE.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID HE DESIRED TRUTH IN HIS SOUL.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE GOES ON AND HE HE HE SAYS
[1:01:22] TO THE LORD, "LORD, PURGE ME
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; WITH HIS." SEE, NOW HE HE REALIZES,
[1:01:29] AMEN. AND THE THE THE THE THE UH THE
[1:01:32] DAMAGE OF HIS WAYS AND THE THINGS. AMEN.
[1:01:34] AND HE BEGIN TO REPENT. PURGE ME, LORD.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; That I SHALL BE CLEAN. WASH me
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; that I shall be whiter than snow.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; MAKE me to hear joy and gladness
[1:01:50] that the bones which thou has broken
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; may rejoice. All right.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to pay real attention
[1:02:01] there.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He went here from the prophet Samuel
[1:02:09] and giving them the parable
[1:02:12] revelation set in about his own nature,
[1:02:17] realizing that he was among a a fallen
[1:02:20] nature.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. ALL THE WAY BACK TO EVE.
[1:02:25] AMEN. When uh we had that first woman
[1:02:29] preacher,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; who began, Amen. to uh PREACH THE
[1:02:34] DOCTRINE OF THE SERPENT.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHICH CAUSED THE WHOLE WORLD TO GO
[1:02:42] INTO CORRUPTION.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY
[1:02:50] EVER SINCE THAT TIME
[1:02:53] GOD DISAPPROVE of women preachers.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN PREACHER
[1:03:00] GOT FULLY ANOINTED SITTING UP UNDER THE
[1:03:04] TOUTELAGE OF THE SERPENT.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; CAME BACK AND GOT A LITTLE ANOINTED AND
[1:03:10] SAID, "WELL, I CAN DO THIS."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; AND DID A GOOD JOB
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; PREACHING FALSE DOCTRINE.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT
[1:03:22] CAUSE EVERY MAN,
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN, TO STRUGGLE.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; EVERY WOMAN TO STRUGGLE, THROW THE WHOLE
[1:03:29] WORLD INTO CHAOS.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:37] OH, DAVID, BECAUSE OF THIS SITUATION,
[1:03:40] BEGIN TO LOOK AND SAY, "OH, UH, I I I
[1:03:43] WAS BORN IN SIN
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; SHAPING IN INIQUITY
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH."
[1:03:52] SO, I SHUDDER TO TELL YOU, MY BROTHERS
[1:03:54] AND SISTERS, I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD
[1:03:55] OF MYSELF. LET'S go here to uh um
[1:04:01] the message
[1:04:03] the beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:04:07] dispensation.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh chapter 37.
[1:04:12] The prophet said,
[1:04:14] REMEMBER THAT OLD SHEPHERD STORY?
[1:04:19] What was there uh in Jerusalem in the
[1:04:22] holy lands of a shepherd was packing a
[1:04:25] sheep and he said
[1:04:28] what you packing that sheep for?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Said it's
[1:04:34] got a broken leg.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; HOW'D IT DO THAT? DID IT FALL OVER A
[1:04:41] CLIFF?
[1:04:43] Said no. I broke its leg.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:47] He said, "Why you a cruel shepherd to
[1:04:51] break that sheep's leg?" See, our ways
[1:04:54] are not like God's ways.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; See, he had no problem breaking the leg
[1:05:01] because he knew he could heal it.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT HESITATION WOULD HE HAVE BREAKING
[1:05:08] LEG? AMEN. WHEN HE CAN TURN AROUND and
[1:05:11] fix it.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I WANT TO I I WANT TO GET TO
[1:05:16] THE meat of this A LITTLE BIT HERE AND
[1:05:18] AND SAY WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He can fix it.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, BECAUSE UH UH UH UH US LIKE
[1:05:31] DAVID,
[1:05:33] GOD WANTS TO UH CARRY US TO A PLACE,
[1:05:38] AMEN, OF OF OF SWEET SURRENDER.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; LET ME READ ON HERE. IT SAYS SOMETIMES
[1:05:48] GOD HAS TO LET US BREAK DOWN JUST A
[1:05:51] LITTLE bit
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; he say BREAK DOWN IN HE in health
[1:05:56] to give us a little extra attention
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; to get us upon his lap to woo us in HIS
[1:06:04] BOSOM. WHEN THE DOCTOR said nothing can
[1:06:07] be done,
[1:06:10] then he takes us into his bosom and say,
[1:06:13] "See, I love you.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you get well."
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; That's something.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO LET you get well. Oh,
[1:06:25] doesn't that just make life better?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He is so grateful.
[1:06:31] He is so a marvelous shepherd,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:06:35] AMEN. NO wonder David said, "The Lord is
[1:06:38] my shepherd."
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SEE, HE HAD DONE BEEN through
[1:06:41] something.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Let me continue reading here. Amen.
[1:06:45] Psalms 51 5-8. He say, "Behold," when he
[1:06:49] said, "Behold, I will shape iniquity.
[1:06:51] Purge me with his make me to his joy and
[1:06:54] gladness. Then
[1:06:58] then will I teach transgressors
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; thy ways
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; and sinners shall be converted
[1:07:07] unto thee.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] Now bear with me. I printed this out
[1:07:13] this time. Amen.
[1:07:18] If we take a little bit here from Psalms
[1:07:20] five.
[1:07:22] Amen.
[1:07:25] Behold, I was shapen in iniquity.
[1:07:28] Did I uh sin
[1:07:30] did my mother and send into my mother's
[1:07:33] conceived me?
[1:07:36] He goes on and say, I desires truth in
[1:07:38] my inward parts.
[1:07:41] You see, since the time of Adam, we have
[1:07:45] all come birthed into the world by human
[1:07:48] nature.
[1:07:50] Amen. a flaw bent out of shape
[1:07:54] from what God had intended for us.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the reason us humans are like
[1:08:00] this is because of the fact the method
[1:08:03] of our conception
[1:08:06] was founded upon a lie.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember that your first birth was
[1:08:14] produced by a result
[1:08:18] of unbelief in the word.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you were born
[1:08:25] then it produces a nature in you that
[1:08:29] causes you to be able
[1:08:32] to receive and believe
[1:08:36] God's word, God's sick for your age.
[1:08:39] Once you get a new nature,
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:48] And it goes on to say here, amen, that
[1:08:50] uh this is why the evidence of the new
[1:08:52] birth is when you receive the message
[1:08:55] that God sent
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; for your age. All right.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand here
[1:09:06] that David had to go through this
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; in the in the in the scripture that we
[1:09:12] just read that HE GOD ALLOWED THIS TO
[1:09:17] HAPPEN TO David for a reason.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN DAVID REALIZED THE CONDITION THAT
[1:09:24] he was in, his whole attitude changed.
[1:09:26] Remember
[1:09:28] in the beginning he wanted to HE HE WAS
[1:09:31] A
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; DEATH SENTENCE.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IF YOU GO THROUGH PSALMS
[1:09:37] YOU SEE ALL ABOUT THE MERCIES OF GOD.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; ALL ABOUT THE MERCIES. GOD HAD TO SHOW
[1:09:46] David
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; his loving kindness.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; This is why David Amen. has so many
[1:09:54] great songs.
[1:09:57] because of this situation.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; SO IN OUR JOURNEY AND IN OUR LIVES, WE
[1:10:03] GO THROUGH THINGS.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; IT ALLOW US TO BE tried and tested.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:14] CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE MAY GO THROUGH.
[1:10:18] If we will, let's uh
[1:10:22] I want to read something here.
[1:10:25] Beginning, ending. Let's see here if I
[1:10:27] have it.
[1:10:31] Amen.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bear with me here.
[1:10:48] say now noticing then
[1:10:53] uh I'm reading from the uh 23rd chapter
[1:11:00] noticing then when these brethren were
[1:11:02] down there they were put to a test
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:11:09] dispensation I think I'm at 23
[1:11:12] very beautiful example of what a true
[1:11:14] believer comes to when he accepts the
[1:11:18] Lord Jesus as his savior, he is always
[1:11:21] put to a test.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Satan still in the testing business and
[1:11:27] it comes
[1:11:29] and it only comes about to help you.
[1:11:34] It's for your good.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; GOD,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST be
[1:11:41] tried, chasened, scoued. In other words,
[1:11:45] give a little thrashing, straightening
[1:11:48] up. And if God gives us some
[1:11:51] chastisement
[1:11:53] and we can't stand it, then we become
[1:11:55] illegitimate children
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; and not the children of God.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Now, a man that REALLY GOT HIS FACE SET
[1:12:03] TOWARDS HEAVEN, NO MATTER WHAT TAKES
[1:12:06] PLACE HERE ON EARTH, HE'S STILL GOT HIS
[1:12:09] face set toward heaven.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. His friend
[1:12:16] may forsake him.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; His family
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; may forsake him.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hold on TO YOUR CHAIR. HIS pastor
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; may forsake him.
[1:12:39] BUT THERE IS ONE THAT won't forsake him
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; and that's God.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And when your MIND IS MADE UP LIKE THAT,
[1:12:51] AMEN.
[1:12:53] then you're on your way. All right.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Many times
[1:13:04] God begins to carry a person on in their
[1:13:08] Christian journey
[1:13:11] and so many people
[1:13:14] are now
[1:13:16] have gone astray.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; May not be AMONG THE FOLD. WHY? Somebody
[1:13:22] hurt me.
[1:13:28] Well, well, if if if if you made a
[1:13:31] decision
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; BASED ON
[1:13:37] WHAT SOMEONE ELSE DID,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; YOUR EYES WERE NOT FOCUSED on the right
[1:13:44] thing.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; He say it may be your it may be the one
[1:13:50] sitting next to you this morning.
[1:13:54] BUT
[1:13:57] YOU HAVE TO STAY FULLY FOCUSED.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Remember I r I read the scripture there
[1:14:05] in Matthew. Amen. THAT IF YOUR BROTHER
[1:14:08] OFFEND YOU,
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; you go to him.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Or her. Yeah, right.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; You don't take the move uh that uh David
[1:14:21] took when Samuel came to him. All
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; dinners
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; or I DON'T HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO WITH
[1:14:32] THEM.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; GOD IS DOING SOMETHING. SEE, YOUR YOUR
[1:14:42] MIND IS ON YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:14:44] DISCOMBOBULATED
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE UH UH MAYBE JUST GOD IS DOING
[1:14:52] SOMETHING
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THAT PERSON ALLOWING THEM TO
[1:14:56] FALL INTO A DISPARAGING SITUATION
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THEM CLOSER TO HIM.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHEEP HAS GONE ASTRAY.
[1:15:11] AMEN. THE BROKEN LEG IS A METAPHOR. IT
[1:15:14] MIGHT NOT BE uh uh actually a broken
[1:15:17] leg.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT A METAPHOR FOR A SITUATION
[1:15:25] THAT THEY HAVE GOT IN
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS CAUSED GREAT CONTENTMENT.
[1:15:33] BUT GOD WHO IS SO RICH IN MERCY
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; GOES AFTER THAT SHEEP
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; SEE THE BIBLE SAYS MY SHEEP HEAR MY
[1:15:45] VOICE.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; AND A STRANGER THEY'LL NOT FOLLOW.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; SO SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT THAT SHEEP CAN
[1:15:52] NO LONGER HEAR THE VOICE.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; SO HE HAS TO GO AFTER THEM.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; MY GOD. YES, LORD.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY CAME HERE. I WAS WATCHING A
[1:16:02] LITTLE THING ON SHEEP and uh uh there
[1:16:04] was a a bunch of sheep grazing in the
[1:16:07] field AND THE SHEPHERD WAS ABLE TO GO TO
[1:16:11] THOSE TO PEOPLE that was I think uh like
[1:16:14] a tourist thing
[1:16:16] and they would go out there and try to
[1:16:18] call the sheep.
[1:16:20] Whatever they were saying,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; you know, they just got to it's not it's
[1:16:24] just a call
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; that they have become used to hearing
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; and when they hear that call they come a
[1:16:34] gathering.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; THEY COME GATHERING. SO THEY ANOTHER
[1:16:39] YOUNG LADY WENT OUT AND SHE would do the
[1:16:41] same and try to mimic it exactly the way
[1:16:43] of the shepherd
[1:16:46] and just do the uh what I would call the
[1:16:49] yodel or whatever they was doing or
[1:16:50] whatever and the sheep didn't move. Oh
[1:16:53] my
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; just stood THERE
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; AND THEY LET SEVERAL PEOPLE GO AND TRY
[1:16:58] TO CALL the sheep and they would do
[1:17:00] their little call and things like that,
[1:17:02] the sheep just moved.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; They just they just kept grazing like
[1:17:06] they didn't EVEN HEAR.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE THAT SHEPHERD
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; GOT OUT THERE AND HE BEGAN TO CALL
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; HIS SHEEP,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; YOU SAW SHEEP COMING FROM EVERYWHERE.
[1:17:22] THEY STOPPED WHAT THEY WERE DOING,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; TURNED TOWARDS THE SHEPHERD,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN TO WALK SLOWLY TOWARDS THE
[1:17:32] VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; SHEEP BEGAN TO COME OUT OF THE
[1:17:37] MOUNTAINS,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; WALKING TOWARDS THE VOICE OF THE
[1:17:41] SHEPHERD.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; NOW THE SHEPHERD
[1:17:46] LOOKING BECAUSE HE KNOW HIS SHEEP AS
[1:17:48] WELL. RIGHT?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I SAID, "I SEE THIS ONE
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; AND I SEE THAT ONE."
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; AND I SEE THIS ONE,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; BUT WHERE'S SUCH AND SUCH?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; BUT I BEGAN TO CONTINUE TO CALL
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; AND ALL THE SHEEP WAS GATHERED RIGHT AT
[1:18:08] HIS FEET AFTER A WHILE.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE FOR THEM TO GET
[1:18:12] THERE CUZ THEY NOT RUNNING.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[1:18:16] BUT THEY TAKE THEIR TIME AND THEY
[1:18:18] COMING.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; BUT HE NOTICED ONE MISSING.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; LORD HAVE MERCY.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED? DID A WOLF GET THEM?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SHEEP?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; NOW MAYBE THE SHEEP JUST CAN'T SOMETHING
[1:18:35] MUST HAVE HAPPENED SO THEY COULD GET A
[1:18:36] HOLD OF THAT BAD GRASS.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT I MEAN BY SOME FALSE DOCTRINE
[1:18:46] AMEN. OR THAT SHEEP BE MAY BE JUST A
[1:18:49] LITTLE BIT WOUNDED. SEE, WE GET WOUNDED
[1:18:52] IN CHURCH.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE BROKENNESS THAT YOU FEEL.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; SO HE COME AFTER THAT ONE BROKEN SHEEP.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:13] AND HE TAKES HIM. AMEN. AND HE BREAKS
[1:19:16] HIS LEG. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
[1:19:19] ABOUT LEG bones
[1:19:22] that I learned from my wife.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Those leg bones are very serious.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; This might be something on your test,
[1:19:32] Zion.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz it was on her test.
[1:19:37] They had a scenario of a person with all
[1:19:40] kind of conditions, a heart condition
[1:19:43] and this kind of condition and another
[1:19:45] young man I believe was on a motorcycle
[1:19:47] and he broke his leg. Now which one is
[1:19:49] deserves the the right now attention? It
[1:19:52] was that broken leg
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; because it's one of the biggest bones
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; in the body. And I think something about
[1:20:00] the protein now I didn't go to the
[1:20:01] class. She just told me
[1:20:04] protein entering into the bloodstream.
[1:20:07] You you am I right, sis?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:13] She go she f to be a doctor, so she
[1:20:15] knows some of this, too.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But but but but but so UH THEN HE TOOK
[1:20:21] THAT SHEET AND PACKED him on his
[1:20:25] shoulders,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; THE STRONGEST PART OF HIS BODY,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; and took it in. Amen. And nursed it back
[1:20:34] to health. See, that's what David was
[1:20:36] going through.
[1:20:39] HIS BONES HAD BEEN BROKEN.
[1:20:43] HE WAS A BROKEN MAN AFTER HE had
[1:20:46] realized, AMEN, THE STATE of his being.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came out better on the
[1:20:54] other side.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He be And he says on here, now here's
[1:20:58] this. He says in 13 then
[1:21:04] see the word when I hear the word then
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; something changed.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; SEE THERE WAS BEFORE
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; NOW THERE'S THEN MEANING IT WAS
[1:21:17] DIFFERENT BEFORE
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THEN WILL I TEACH GRAND
[1:21:21] transgressors
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; thy ways
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and sinners shall be converted unto me.
[1:21:29] See, David was was teaching from uh a
[1:21:33] place of uh iron fist, I would say.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; But then he begin to carry the mercies
[1:21:39] of God.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he be to understand the grace
[1:21:44] of God.
[1:21:46] THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE
[1:21:49] UH UH UH brothers and sisters, friends
[1:21:53] that truly hurt you,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; pray for one another.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; God is in the plan.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; God is in the plan.
[1:22:07] PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND THAT PERSON AND
[1:22:09] just let them know that you love them
[1:22:10] and you forgive them.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO. GO
[1:22:16] AFTER him
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; exactly right.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And show love
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; and show love to that one.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; We look at the Hebrew boys.
[1:22:35] Amen. In Daniel there,
[1:22:38] they had fallen into a situation. Amen.
[1:22:41] Where uh they were under great trial.
[1:22:45] under great trial. Amen. But after you
[1:22:48] come out of that trial,
[1:22:51] amen, if you uh uh stay with the things
[1:22:53] of God, then you become a witness for
[1:22:57] him. Then he uses you, amen, as a great
[1:23:02] tool for what he's doing. But you have
[1:23:06] to be tested
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; understanding that. Now remember the
[1:23:11] Bible said all we like sheep.
[1:23:14] There's none of us that are that that
[1:23:17] that that get a pass on being tested.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; None of us.
[1:23:26] If one offends you,
[1:23:29] go to them.
[1:23:31] They may not receive you right away, BUT
[1:23:33] DO YOU KNOW WHAT? You pray for them.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; You pray for them. Praise God.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] So
[1:23:47] I want to just share Amen. A quick
[1:23:50] testimony.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; A personal testimony.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; There was a situation.
[1:24:00] Amen. in my life.
[1:24:03] That was a great
[1:24:05] a great trial,
[1:24:07] a great test. And you know what? I CAN'T
[1:24:10] SAY THAT I HANDLED IT ALL THAT WELL.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But God, who is rich in mercy,
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; came after me.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Came after me.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my bones were broken.
[1:24:31] hurt.
[1:24:35] That's why I read it here in in in in
[1:24:38] this in the in uh the message that he
[1:24:41] says friends may forsake you.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] Family
[1:24:50] may turn their back on you
[1:24:54] and even your pastor. Let me tell you
[1:24:56] something.
[1:24:58] Don't lift up anybody too high.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; I'm all for appreciations.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; No problem with them. Careful
[1:25:16] not to step across the line.
[1:25:21] You see, because what happens is I
[1:25:24] remember when I was freshly coming back,
[1:25:29] coming back to the fold. See, I was that
[1:25:31] lost sheep.
[1:25:34] And
[1:25:36] uh I'm at the church there and the
[1:25:40] ministers asked for all of the pastors
[1:25:42] and to stand and the ministers to stand
[1:25:44] and they sung a song,
[1:25:47] you know, just you know, heaping praise
[1:25:50] upon them and and and and I cringed.
[1:25:54] I cringed, Lord, wait a minute.
[1:25:59] Because
[1:26:02] when you do that,
[1:26:05] you put a target on that man's back.
[1:26:11] See,
[1:26:16] I've been through some things.
[1:26:19] And
[1:26:21] recently I was sharing with someone
[1:26:25] on
[1:26:27] some of the things that I had been
[1:26:28] through being a young deacon
[1:26:32] and
[1:26:33] had to do some things
[1:26:38] that were was was I just didn't think I
[1:26:41] would ever have to do in my life.
[1:26:45] And um I realized how it affected me.
[1:26:52] Realized how it affected me. And it
[1:26:54] wasn't until that moment because we
[1:26:57] there were two of us, two deacons.
[1:27:00] And we had to handle some very difficult
[1:27:07] a very difficult situation
[1:27:10] cuz you see at that time
[1:27:14] uh
[1:27:17] I believe spiritual growth had be to set
[1:27:20] in.
[1:27:22] We
[1:27:24] we were we were a church
[1:27:28] that were was much like THIS WHEN WE
[1:27:31] WERE DOING THINGS.
[1:27:35] We were on fire,
[1:27:40] traveling,
[1:27:42] going from church to church.
[1:27:45] We were having such a great time.
[1:27:50] But something came along out of left
[1:27:52] field that I didn't see coming
[1:27:55] whatsoever and knocked me off center.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Knocked me completely
[1:28:04] as uh Paul off my horse
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; and
[1:28:12] I I I couldn't handle it.
[1:28:15] I began
[1:28:17] I began to
[1:28:21] like that sheep
[1:28:24] lost just lost. I I I tell you I just
[1:28:29] lost
[1:28:31] because of a situation.
[1:28:34] God is my witness. I tried
[1:28:37] but so deeply wounded.
[1:28:42] just lost my way.
[1:28:45] And the other deacon that was there with
[1:28:48] me at the time hung in there.
[1:28:52] I was safe for as long as he could. But
[1:28:54] it wasn't until I was sharing the story
[1:28:56] that I realized that he was affected as
[1:28:59] well.
[1:29:01] No longer in the message.
[1:29:04] It it it it cheapened
[1:29:07] the message in his eye in in his eyes
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; that
[1:29:14] how should I say allowed him to
[1:29:17] eventually go astray,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY HIM, MANY PEOPLE.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Though I say that to say this,
[1:29:28] pray for your pastor.
[1:29:32] Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Pray for these ministers.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Because there is a target
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; on your back.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; In any war,
[1:29:47] the enemy wants to take out the leaders
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and scatter the flock. Yeah.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN AMONGST YOU, YOUR friends and
[1:30:02] your family, THE DEVIL HAS NO, HE DON'T
[1:30:07] FIGHT FAIR.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; He will use
[1:30:13] even your spouse
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; TO CAUSE GREAT HURT,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; GREAT PAIN.
[1:30:25] THAT YOU will go astray.
[1:30:28] I'M OFTEN REMINDED THAT HE'LL USE
[1:30:30] ANYTHING THAT SOMETIME
[1:30:34] MOST OF THE TIME YOU ARE NOT THE TARGET.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S the one that's watching you.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TARGET.
[1:30:46] BUT IF HE CAN TAKE AND WOUND YOU WITH
[1:30:48] SOMETHING
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T HANDLE IT CORRECTLY
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; AND YOU GOT EVERY EXCUSE NOT TO HANDLE
[1:30:57] IT CORRECTLY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HURT
[1:30:59] TRULY HURT
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; AND I CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR DOING AND
[1:31:07] YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT
[1:31:09] THERE'S OTHERS WATCHING YOU.
[1:31:13] You're just a tool
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; in the devil's grip
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; to get the one
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; that's watching you.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHEN GOD HE COMES AND HE GETS
[1:31:36] THAT sheep
[1:31:38] and HE BREAKS HIS LEG.
[1:31:42] AMEN. And it seems so cruel.
[1:31:47] But on the other side of that is a sweet
[1:31:49] victory.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU become
[1:31:54] closer.
[1:31:56] HE SAYS, "THEN CAN I TEACH THE PEOPLE
[1:31:58] THY WAYS.
[1:32:04] Once you've been healed,
[1:32:07] once you've sat there in the bosom of
[1:32:10] that shepherd,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; and after you've been, Amen. healed and
[1:32:15] able to go back to the flock,
[1:32:18] YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER ONE IN THE flock
[1:32:22] and say, "I recognize what you're going
[1:32:24] through."
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't eat
[1:32:29] that grass.
[1:32:31] Yes,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I ate that grass and oh, he had to come
[1:32:36] get me.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU CAN TEACH THE OTHERS IN THE
[1:32:45] FLOCK.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Of his tender mercies.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; See, we all go through things.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; All of us. Every last one of us.
[1:33:00] are the sheep of his pasture.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly what we need.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we must all go through the
[1:33:10] test and the trials.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Let me go on.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; In question and answers, the prophet
[1:33:23] explains to us, backsliding is not lost.
[1:33:28] I want somebody to tell me where
[1:33:30] backsliding is lost. And prove it to me.
[1:33:34] Prove it to the Bible. Backsliders are
[1:33:37] not lost.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; He's just out of fellowship.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; They lost their praise, their joy.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. David said, "The joy of his
[1:33:55] salvation,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; restore unto me
[1:33:59] the joy of his salvation,
[1:34:02] and renew a right spirit
[1:34:06] within me.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Cast me not
[1:34:10] away from thy presence, oh Lord."
[1:34:14] Amen. See, but sometime we look at it
[1:34:18] from a human perspective.
[1:34:21] and say that person is lost.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; That person is not lost.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because see,
[1:34:28] God is in hot pursuit of some people
[1:34:30] right now.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; In hot pursuit.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And see when when when when when
[1:34:42] you one of them quiet pursuits,
[1:34:45] he going in quiet. Sirens ain't blaring.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; But he in hot pursuit.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; You ever been in hot pursuit and then
[1:34:55] you got apprehended?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I have.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; See, I didn't know I He was in hot
[1:35:01] pursuit.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; But one day my wife said, "Let's go to
[1:35:04] church."
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; He was in hot pursuit.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And I just said, "Oh, uh, I got this to
[1:35:13] do and I got that to do." Amen. I was
[1:35:18] running
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; from the pursuit.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; But when he's in hot pursuit,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's not just him. Amen. He
[1:35:30] have other deputies.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And the old saying, you can't outrun
[1:35:35] that radio.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; He had that helicopter
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; watching from a high. I know where
[1:35:45] you're at, brother. You can't hide.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; So, I try to go into the bar, whatever,
[1:35:51] and hide. No, you can't hide there,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; We He's in hot pursuit.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, something began to click on
[1:36:03] the inside.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Lost wounded sheep.
[1:36:10] But when the Lord, amen,
[1:36:13] uh, found me, amen, and got to me and
[1:36:19] apprehended me, threw me upon his
[1:36:23] shoulders,
[1:36:24] amen, and brought me back to the fold.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Immediately something began to
[1:36:30] feel familiar. Hallelujah.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; If I can just get him in a familiar
[1:36:39] surroundings.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I could nurse him back to
[1:36:46] health.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE LORD GOT ME IN familiar
[1:36:51] surroundings.
[1:36:53] Amen. And I I I began to sit there. And
[1:36:56] at first, AMEN. I WAS STILL WOUNDED.
[1:36:59] AMEN. SO, I couldn't move as much,

[1:37:07] on the Lord.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a whole lot of praise in
[1:37:13] me.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; So, I just sat there. Amen. And and let
[1:37:18] the Lord heal my broken bones.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And after a while, Amen. the
[1:37:26] healing be to take place. And I begin to
[1:37:30] pat my feet.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember when I used to pat my
[1:37:37] feet?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wasn't jumping yet. I wasn't
[1:37:42] shot. All I could do is pat my feet.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT AFTER A WHILE, AMEN. the bones
[1:37:49] begin to heal.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened is I begin to
[1:37:55] feel better. Jesus.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; See, cuz when your bones are broken, you
[1:38:00] you you you're not feeling just
[1:38:02] yourself.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU DON'T YOU STILL DON'T HAVE
[1:38:06] THAT SAME joy that you used to have.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I began to feel healing.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah, I said, is like fire
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; shut up in my bones.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL MIND IF I PREACH this morning?
[1:38:25] Amen. And after a while, amen, I got
[1:38:29] enough strength

[1:38:40] familiar.

[2:08:48] Even now you are troubling the waters.
[2:08:53] You're rolling back stones and you're
[2:08:57] moving for me.
[2:09:00] Even now you are mening what's broken.
[2:09:06] So my heart is open and I know you're
[2:09:10] moving, God. You're open doors that used
[2:09:16] to be closed. And you are moving for me.
[2:09:20] God, you're moving for me.
[2:09:24] You quiet my soul so I can be still and
[2:09:28] know that you are moving for me. God,
[2:09:33] you're
[2:09:35] moving for me.
[2:09:46] You're moving for me.
[2:10:10] You're moving for me.
[2:10:25] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:10:28] Hallelujah.
[2:10:30] Hallelujah.
[2:10:32] God bless you, Sister Rebecca,
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe. God bless you all. You all
[2:10:37] may have your seats. The brethren will
[2:10:39] come at this time to dismiss you. God
[2:10:41] richly bless you. Amen.
