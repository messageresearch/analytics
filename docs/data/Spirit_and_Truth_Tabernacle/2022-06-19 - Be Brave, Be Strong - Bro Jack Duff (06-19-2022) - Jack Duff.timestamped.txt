[59:24] happy father's day to all the fathers

[59:29] that i i wanted to be intentional amen
[59:32] about uh speaking to uh the dads on
[59:36] today amen and just with a little sermon
[59:39] i want to title this be brave
[59:42] be strong amen be brave be strong and
[59:46] it's more of i would say just more of a
[59:48] a talk with uh with our fathers you know
[59:51] we we we often times uh as fathers
[59:54] we we're not encouraged that all the
[59:58] time right uh oftentimes always do this
[1:00:01] do that and people trying to you know
[1:00:03] shape you up and all kind of things but
[1:00:05] we want to try to say something that'd
[1:00:06] be encouraging uh to you uh today so
[1:00:09] just just just just bear with us be
[1:00:11] brave be strong amen is our thought and
[1:00:15] uh as i was just meditating amen on this
[1:00:19] uh little thought here for father's day
[1:00:22] you know typically what happens with me
[1:00:25] i'm always thinking about these
[1:00:26] different days and you know i know
[1:00:28] brother brandon when it comes to
[1:00:29] mother's day brother brandon say every
[1:00:30] day is mother's day you know and uh and
[1:00:33] i agree with what the prophet is saying
[1:00:35] but you know i i think it's good that we
[1:00:37] stop and take time to honor the mother's
[1:00:40] mother's day but also think it's good
[1:00:43] that we stop and take time to honor our
[1:00:45] fathers
[1:00:46] on father's day amen everybody in here
[1:00:50] has a father
[1:00:52] you wouldn't be here if you didn't have
[1:00:53] one right and uh and whether your dad
[1:00:56] was a good man a bad man he was still
[1:00:59] your daddy come on somebody all right
[1:01:02] and uh and and you know and the thing of
[1:01:04] it is i was just sitting here thinking
[1:01:05] in my mind um you know if we went
[1:01:07] through the scripture and looked at some
[1:01:10] of the different men that were in
[1:01:11] scripture which one would you choose as
[1:01:13] your dad
[1:01:14] right which one would you say i wish
[1:01:15] that was my daddy you know
[1:01:18] and i thought about different ones and
[1:01:19] said noah would you want noah to be your
[1:01:21] daddy
[1:01:22] come on somebody you would be building
[1:01:24] an ark
[1:01:27] if noah was your daddy you would be
[1:01:29] building an ark and you'd be on the ark
[1:01:32] hallelujah i mean i can imagine noah's
[1:01:35] children didn't go too many places
[1:01:37] amen they couldn't work too many other
[1:01:39] jobs they had to work on the ark
[1:01:42] hey come on somebody no quitting no no
[1:01:45] no no no no giving up no you're going to
[1:01:47] work on this ark with me amen this is
[1:01:50] for your protection
[1:01:51] this is for your future this is for your
[1:01:54] safety right i mean you're gonna have to
[1:01:56] do this with me
[1:01:58] and if you think about it some of the
[1:01:59] traits that are in your daddy now were
[1:02:01] in noah back then
[1:02:03] i'm raise you this way because this is
[1:02:05] going to be for your safety this is
[1:02:07] going to be for your future hallelujah
[1:02:10] all right now
[1:02:12] i mean you know just just different ones
[1:02:14] that we can look back in scripture amen
[1:02:17] and say if that was your daddy what
[1:02:18] would you do right amen moses having to
[1:02:21] apply blood on the door and and things
[1:02:23] like that what what what a great
[1:02:25] responsibility he had but my what what
[1:02:27] what pressure would have been to be one
[1:02:29] of noah i mean moses children
[1:02:32] glory to god amen
[1:02:34] amen amen so you know we we look we look
[1:02:37] we look at this and the one thing that
[1:02:38] we do know is that uh we uh we uh we
[1:02:41] don't we don't control who our parents
[1:02:43] are
[1:02:44] it's god that does that and god god god
[1:02:47] is the one that actually uh knew before
[1:02:50] you were even born which way you're
[1:02:52] gonna come through here hi i mean which
[1:02:54] which which womb you were gonna come
[1:02:56] through and that was god's great plan he
[1:02:58] knew which man he was gonna use to bring
[1:03:00] you glory to god that was god's great
[1:03:02] plan so what we want to do is at least
[1:03:04] take time and thank god for what he has
[1:03:06] done
[1:03:07] and placing fathers in our life
[1:03:11] uh oftentimes we hear
[1:03:13] of the terms
[1:03:15] deadbeat dad
[1:03:17] or absent fathers
[1:03:19] and and and and and in general terms i
[1:03:22] feel like uh these words are being
[1:03:24] sometimes used in general discussions
[1:03:26] used in the wrong manner and and and
[1:03:29] oftentimes
[1:03:30] maybe something in life that we've gone
[1:03:32] through and and we feel like if my daddy
[1:03:35] would have been if my daddy wasn't
[1:03:36] absent
[1:03:38] amen then uh i would be better you gotta
[1:03:41] understand some things you you make
[1:03:42] choices just based on
[1:03:44] it's not based on what your daddy did or
[1:03:46] what your mama did it's based on the
[1:03:47] choices you're making
[1:03:50] as a as a young man coming up
[1:03:53] i played football and and
[1:03:55] my dad was not interested in football he
[1:03:59] wasn't interested in it and and so my
[1:04:01] dad had never showed up to any of our
[1:04:03] games right but uh and we were baseball
[1:04:06] players and and and uh you know daddy
[1:04:08] would pay for us to get into the league
[1:04:10] and all that but he didn't he didn't he
[1:04:12] was not a sports man so he didn't he
[1:04:14] didn't get involved in a lot of that now
[1:04:16] i could allow that to just say well my
[1:04:18] dad never came to my game so i'm no it
[1:04:20] was okay as long as you pay for me to go
[1:04:22] i'm good dad
[1:04:24] praise the lord i'll come back and tell
[1:04:26] you about the the home run i tried to
[1:04:28] hit
[1:04:29] amen and a touchdown i scored i'ma come
[1:04:32] and share something with you right and
[1:04:33] daddy might not get in he might not get
[1:04:36] excited about it don't even don't even
[1:04:38] face him but it didn't bother me as long
[1:04:39] as i had the opportunity to be able to
[1:04:41] do the things that i could do
[1:04:44] and what you would what i come to
[1:04:45] understand my dad is different from me
[1:04:50] god made me made us different but he he
[1:04:53] still chose him to be daddy
[1:04:55] so i still respect him i still honor him
[1:04:58] in the place that he has in my life
[1:05:01] come on somebody
[1:05:03] all right so you know uh when we use
[1:05:06] these terms as i say loosely amen this
[1:05:09] general discussion we said my daddy was
[1:05:11] absent
[1:05:12] but but you gotta understand a man the
[1:05:14] real definition of an absentee father
[1:05:18] and uh you know and a dad beat dad the
[1:05:22] real definition is a a person that's
[1:05:25] avoiding child support
[1:05:30] that's the real definition they're not
[1:05:32] paying child support
[1:05:34] hallelujah so you got and and the only
[1:05:37] way that your daddy gonna really be
[1:05:38] paying paying
[1:05:41] child support is that something had to
[1:05:43] happen between him and your mama and he
[1:05:45] left
[1:05:46] all right somebody
[1:05:48] then he'd have to be paying child
[1:05:50] support
[1:05:52] glory to god but here i want to take a
[1:05:54] little further amen um you know and and
[1:05:56] i'm i'm using this from two different
[1:05:58] angles because you know we got to stop
[1:06:01] uh labeling our fathers negative with
[1:06:03] negative labels
[1:06:05] amen glory to god now i'm not here to i
[1:06:08] i i will say this i'm not i'm not blind
[1:06:11] that there are some fathers amen that
[1:06:14] are
[1:06:15] avoiding
[1:06:16] child support not necessarily in the
[1:06:19] money that they're paying
[1:06:21] but emotionally
[1:06:22] they are avoiding child support come on
[1:06:26] somebody
[1:06:27] amen uh sometimes a man we gotta look at
[1:06:30] things a little deeper than what they
[1:06:32] are we we're avoiding child support by
[1:06:35] being able to provide wisdom
[1:06:38] amen providing guidance glory to god
[1:06:41] amen it's not always just about the
[1:06:43] money that we provide but it's all these
[1:06:45] areas that a man must step up into in
[1:06:48] order to bring support to his child
[1:06:50] or his children
[1:06:53] many men thought it was just all about
[1:06:55] just the money the money the money the
[1:06:56] money the money
[1:06:57] but they missed all the other elements
[1:06:59] that was needed in the development of
[1:07:01] the child
[1:07:02] i thank god i had a daddy that was very
[1:07:04] intentional about taking us on vacation
[1:07:07] he's planted those seeds in us so when i
[1:07:10] when i got up i wanted to do the same
[1:07:12] thing with my children i thank god for
[1:07:14] that i had a daddy that that you know uh
[1:07:16] he actually want he had ambition he
[1:07:19] wanted to get out he bought a house
[1:07:21] with my dad and i remember when we when
[1:07:23] we was growing up we lived in an
[1:07:25] apartment i can take you and show you
[1:07:26] the street where we lived on over on
[1:07:28] wednesday amen we're living over there
[1:07:30] in an apartment but my daddy wasn't
[1:07:32] satisfied with just just that apartment
[1:07:34] my daddy went to work and he got us a
[1:07:36] house
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:40] glory to god you gotta understand that
[1:07:42] as daddies uh continue to thrive as
[1:07:45] daddies continue to kind of uh want
[1:07:47] better for their kids it causes their
[1:07:50] kids to want better the next generation
[1:07:53] glory to god it perpetuates if we don't
[1:07:56] have vision as fathers then we can't
[1:07:58] expect our children to have it either
[1:08:02] let me go a little further let me go a
[1:08:04] little further see it's just it's
[1:08:06] avoiding child support it's great it's
[1:08:08] greater than just the financial
[1:08:10] responsibility don't get me wrong i mean
[1:08:12] i told you i'm here to encourage you and
[1:08:14] sometimes just just sharing truth with
[1:08:16] you encourages you
[1:08:18] all right let me go a little further
[1:08:20] all right so uh
[1:08:23] i want to say this i believe child
[1:08:24] support expands beyond just finances
[1:08:27] uh
[1:08:28] i think this is uh something uh all
[1:08:31] families have to fight and and uh you
[1:08:34] know one of the one of the reasons that
[1:08:36] that that that that fathers may kind of
[1:08:38] disconnect and you know maybe they they
[1:08:40] um they
[1:08:42] physically or you know financially not
[1:08:44] providing the child support it's maybe
[1:08:46] it's something that the the father and
[1:08:48] mother disagree disagreed about
[1:08:50] something uh divorce amen comes up into
[1:08:54] the family and uh and now they're and
[1:08:57] what happens is that it's the children
[1:08:58] that's impacted the most when things
[1:09:00] like that happen glory to god and what
[1:09:02] i'm here to encourage is that is because
[1:09:04] i mean everybody go through pressures
[1:09:05] and everything like that in their in
[1:09:07] their marriages but i want to encourage
[1:09:08] the fathers be brave and be strong
[1:09:11] be brave and be strong right don't don't
[1:09:15] be so quick to quit
[1:09:18] but be brave and be strong
[1:09:21] glory to god uh some of some of you kids
[1:09:23] have watched some of your parents go
[1:09:24] through some tremendous things
[1:09:26] tremendous pressures in their in their
[1:09:28] marriage but yet somehow they they they
[1:09:30] still glued together they didn't allow a
[1:09:33] man of different pressures to actually
[1:09:34] pull them apart it could have
[1:09:37] it could have other marriages have been
[1:09:39] ruined by but but some somehow god has
[1:09:42] allowed these parents to stay together
[1:09:43] your father and your mother were both
[1:09:45] being brave and being strong
[1:09:47] hallelujah glory to god let me go a
[1:09:50] little further
[1:09:51] my thoughts cause me to reflect on what
[1:09:53] what really is a father
[1:09:55] a father is not just a man that can
[1:09:57] produce children
[1:09:59] amen after he has children
[1:10:02] i was just thinking the lord just told
[1:10:04] me he needs to be available
[1:10:07] after he has children a father needs to
[1:10:09] be available
[1:10:11] yesterday you know i was i was traveling
[1:10:13] i did a really quick trip uh you know
[1:10:16] and when when i was invited to do this i
[1:10:19] was i was really hesitant about doing it
[1:10:21] because i knew i was just coming back
[1:10:23] from
[1:10:24] vancouver uh and i'm like lord i just i
[1:10:26] don't know if i can i can pull this one
[1:10:27] off but it was the minister's uh getaway
[1:10:30] and and just just want to kind of sit
[1:10:31] and talk about uh things that just
[1:10:34] pastors go through and sometimes you
[1:10:36] don't have other folk you can just kind
[1:10:38] of open up to so it's good to be in a
[1:10:40] safe place with other preachers that's
[1:10:42] going through the same thing and just
[1:10:44] open up and get direction and and get
[1:10:46] encouragement so i said you know what
[1:10:48] i'm i'm a sacrifice and i'm a go brother
[1:10:49] nathan asked me to come and i'd say i'ma
[1:10:52] come so i was there in lexington
[1:10:53] kentucky and um and flew in on on sat
[1:10:57] friday morning and came back in came
[1:10:59] back home last night and uh you know and
[1:11:01] as i was there i'm like okay i need to
[1:11:04] get my sermon prepared i'm gonna do this
[1:11:06] and i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna do
[1:11:07] this but you know
[1:11:08] this brother brother let's talk brother
[1:11:10] let's talk brother you mentioned this
[1:11:12] and i i'm like oh lord i ain't gonna get
[1:11:14] my sermon together and then then i got a
[1:11:16] little text from my uh my son-in-law he
[1:11:18] say uh it says uh brother jack what time
[1:11:20] is your flight leaving i say six o'clock
[1:11:23] and i already had it in my head that you
[1:11:24] know what i'm gonna do uh at this time
[1:11:26] this brother gonna be gone and this time
[1:11:28] this brother gonna be gone so now i'm
[1:11:30] gonna start working on my sermon i'm
[1:11:32] gonna so he said what time you got your
[1:11:33] flight i'd say six o'clock
[1:11:35] and then uh he says well me and becca
[1:11:37] was thinking that we'd drive over there
[1:11:39] and take you out to lunch and say okay
[1:11:41] that just changed my plan on my sermon
[1:11:44] and then and then now i could i could
[1:11:45] have said you know what uh i need to
[1:11:47] work on my sermon right now so i'm gonna
[1:11:49] just cancel but then i it just kind of
[1:11:51] hit me this is where the lord told them
[1:11:52] say a father needs to make himself
[1:11:54] available
[1:11:57] in order to be a father you need to make
[1:11:58] yourselves and it wasn't even dawning on
[1:12:00] me because sometimes i get so busy i
[1:12:02] forget what day it is
[1:12:05] but i didn't realize the reason my
[1:12:06] son-in-law and my daughter trying to get
[1:12:08] to me because it's father's day tomorrow
[1:12:11] and they will not have a chance to be
[1:12:12] with you so they want to be with you
[1:12:14] today and they want to take you out to
[1:12:16] lunch and i allowed myself to go out to
[1:12:19] lunch with some preachers and eat some
[1:12:21] ribs
[1:12:24] and then when they got to me i'm like
[1:12:25] i'm full already but i will go to
[1:12:27] cheesecake and get some pineapple upside
[1:12:30] down
[1:12:34] i will i will have some of that with
[1:12:36] y'all and we just sat there and had some
[1:12:38] fellowship but i had to make myself
[1:12:41] available
[1:12:43] oh hallelujah and sometimes that is we
[1:12:46] got to learn it's going to be a
[1:12:47] sacrifice on our time it's going to be a
[1:12:49] sacrifice in our pockets but we got to
[1:12:53] do these things in order to sow the
[1:12:54] right seeds in our children
[1:12:58] hallelujah
[1:13:00] so the lord told me yesterday you need
[1:13:01] to be available
[1:13:04] a father is not just a man that can
[1:13:05] produce children
[1:13:07] after he has children he needs to be
[1:13:09] available
[1:13:10] available to provide emotional support
[1:13:13] available to provide wisdom available to
[1:13:15] provide guidance available to provide
[1:13:17] financial support
[1:13:19] and the most important thing that i
[1:13:21] think a father has to do is provide
[1:13:22] spiritual development
[1:13:26] a father has to be able to do that the
[1:13:27] father has to lead his family
[1:13:29] spiritually
[1:13:30] praise god
[1:13:31] right uh and i put it this way he must
[1:13:34] be available to allow all of god's
[1:13:37] attributes to be expressed through him
[1:13:40] to his children
[1:13:42] you gotta you gotta be able to express
[1:13:43] god's love
[1:13:45] oh somebody
[1:13:47] you got to be able to express god's love
[1:13:49] when your children just all
[1:13:51] all messed up and but you as a father
[1:13:54] you got to be the one to be able to
[1:13:55] express god's love
[1:13:57] you know i was i was reminded of
[1:13:58] something brother smiler's preaching
[1:14:00] i guess last month it was and he made a
[1:14:02] he said you know they tell you that um
[1:14:05] men shouldn't cry he said that's that's
[1:14:07] a lie that men don't cry he says men do
[1:14:10] cry men do cry and uh and and and i was
[1:14:13] just reflecting and said you know i i'm
[1:14:16] i'm a person that i i don't cry often
[1:14:18] but i have cried
[1:14:20] i have
[1:14:21] uh it is an emotion that i remember you
[1:14:24] know when my daughter um when she left
[1:14:26] home you know man that was a big one for
[1:14:29] me
[1:14:30] that was a big one i mean i i walked out
[1:14:32] the house and went walking down the
[1:14:34] street and i just let out tears crying
[1:14:37] to god
[1:14:38] lord i did this and lord i did that and
[1:14:41] lord lord this lord that and father how
[1:14:44] did this happen oh did i did i do
[1:14:45] something wrong what what you know and i
[1:14:47] mean your whole world is just crumbling
[1:14:49] you just crying
[1:14:51] but then i got to a spot where i dried
[1:14:53] up my tears
[1:14:55] and i looked myself
[1:14:57] and looked at myself in the mirror
[1:14:59] and i said god i did the best i could
[1:15:02] and if i know i did the best i could and
[1:15:05] and look i i'm not perfect i know i'm
[1:15:07] not perfect right and there's probably
[1:15:08] some things i could have did better but
[1:15:10] i did the best i could right and i said
[1:15:13] i did the best i could i can't cry

[1:16:47] judgment
[1:16:49] some of the decisions that he has to
[1:16:51] make they're like god's judgment
[1:16:53] oh and sometimes it go against what we
[1:16:55] want to do and what we think what we
[1:16:57] feel but a father has to provide that
[1:16:59] type of guidance it's for your
[1:17:00] protection
[1:17:02] it's for your future
[1:17:05] as a father he's the defender
[1:17:08] he's a protector
[1:17:10] he's a sustainer
[1:17:12] he's the enforcer
[1:17:13] he's the provider
[1:17:15] and a man that don't provide for his
[1:17:17] family
[1:17:19] is worse than infidel
[1:17:22] i want to tell you this morning god is
[1:17:23] calling for men to be brave and to
[1:17:26] be strong
[1:17:27] i want to
[1:17:29] use a quote here out of here you hear ye
[1:17:31] him
[1:17:32] um
[1:17:33] god's calling for brave men brother
[1:17:35] branham's going to make this comment in
[1:17:37] this particular
[1:17:38] quote
[1:17:40] but let's look at this he's talking
[1:17:41] about a little time that he was up in
[1:17:43] the mountains and uh
[1:17:45] man he got a just just out there and god
[1:17:48] just began to reveal some things to him
[1:17:49] brother and just got to shout and praise
[1:17:51] god out there in that mountain and it
[1:17:53] says this it says then something begin
[1:17:55] to move
[1:17:56] it says um uh oh
[1:17:58] it's good to be here
[1:18:00] and the sun bathed
[1:18:02] the evergreen froze from the rain
[1:18:04] and the sun shining against them made a
[1:18:07] rainbow and i said oh god you live in
[1:18:10] the mountain the rainbow represents the
[1:18:12] covenant he was to look upon a
[1:18:14] revelations one the rainbow had jasper
[1:18:16] and starting stone benjamin and reuben
[1:18:18] the first and last he that he that was
[1:18:21] which is and shall come the root and
[1:18:23] offspring of david and the morning star
[1:18:26] it says and as i looked at that
[1:18:29] my emotions become to a place where i
[1:18:31] could not hold it any longer i screamed
[1:18:34] to the top of my voice i had to give
[1:18:36] vent and i suppose if someone would have
[1:18:38] been in the woods they thought there's a
[1:18:41] maniac there somewhere from someone from
[1:18:43] the insane institution around and around
[1:18:46] the tree i went screaming to the top of
[1:18:48] my voice well i was feeling that way i
[1:18:50] was worshiping god
[1:18:52] he says and as i worship the lord
[1:18:55] around and around the tree all of a
[1:18:57] sudden a little pine squirrel oh the
[1:18:59] noisiest thing you ever heard he jumped
[1:19:01] up on a stump and he looked up towards
[1:19:04] me again chatta chatter chatter chatter
[1:19:06] chatter i thought did i excite you
[1:19:09] little fellow why i thought you ought to
[1:19:11] worship god with me
[1:19:13] you are a creator of god
[1:19:17] a creature of god it says
[1:19:19] why don't you worship me i thought oh
[1:19:22] don't we love him and around the tree i
[1:19:25] went just as hard as i could go didn't
[1:19:28] care i was worshiping god oh my cup was
[1:19:31] running over
[1:19:32] not to make a mock not to be seen i was
[1:19:35] being drenched in my feeling as david
[1:19:38] danced before the ark of the lord and i
[1:19:39] said look at this little pine squirrel i
[1:19:42] thought it was barking at me and he's
[1:19:44] the policeman of the woods anyhow and he
[1:19:46] goes and says and i notice
[1:19:49] down under the blowdown the great storm
[1:19:52] had forced the big eagle down in that
[1:19:54] blow down and that's what he was barking
[1:19:57] at not the noise i was making but the
[1:20:01] eagle was in pine cones there and up on
[1:20:04] the limb just a great big graceful bird
[1:20:08] called the eagle and i i stopped and i
[1:20:10] thought well i know you're in that wolf
[1:20:13] call and the elk call you're in the
[1:20:16] sunset you're in the rainbow you're just
[1:20:18] everywhere but what about this what kind
[1:20:21] of seed is this so i watched him a
[1:20:24] little while and i said well wonder why
[1:20:25] god wants me to look at that and all of
[1:20:27] a sudden i noticed the big eagle wasn't
[1:20:30] scared and look at this brother branham
[1:20:32] said this god don't want cowards
[1:20:35] god wants men that's brave
[1:20:39] amen he can't use a coward that's a run
[1:20:42] down and afraid to testify of your
[1:20:45] healing or tell your neighbors your boss
[1:20:47] what god has done for you or give praise
[1:20:50] to christ ashamed to speak up in the
[1:20:52] hour when the trial comes and you're
[1:20:54] afraid to say that you're a christian
[1:20:56] god can't use you
[1:20:59] i like that i like that i like that when
[1:21:01] the trial come amen
[1:21:05] a father a man a brave man is not is not
[1:21:08] afraid to to go back and and tell people
[1:21:11] his testimony
[1:21:13] oh i'm i'm i'm saying something i'm
[1:21:16] saying something i mean i i um
[1:21:18] uh i've watched this amen and and
[1:21:22] especially my brother-in-law watch i
[1:21:24] watch this one of the things that uh
[1:21:25] he's been criticized for amen is that he
[1:21:29] always shares his testimony
[1:21:31] glory to god and but but the thing of it
[1:21:33] is is that that is uh the testimony is
[1:21:37] what
[1:21:38] makes him the person he is today he
[1:21:41] always tell you this is the man i used
[1:21:43] to be but when i came in contact with
[1:21:46] this it changed me right and i haven't
[1:21:49] been that way since that time had i been
[1:21:52] the man i used to be man it would be
[1:21:54] trouble
[1:21:55] but i thank god for what god did for me
[1:21:58] hallelujah and you get you gotta
[1:22:00] understand every person has to come to a
[1:22:03] place where they experience that type of
[1:22:06] change
[1:22:08] oh yes you have to come to your own
[1:22:11] individual spot where you experience
[1:22:13] that type of change i'm reminded of
[1:22:16] brother capers
[1:22:17] glory to god he would share with you his
[1:22:20] testimony amen how he used to be a
[1:22:23] particular way but one day on a boat
[1:22:26] glory to god his his his partner leaving

[1:22:32] he said well i'll be here when you get
[1:22:34] back and when he gets up to walking all
[1:22:36] of a sudden he runs in contact with the
[1:22:38] same thing paul came in contact with a
[1:22:41] great light hit him on the boat and he's
[1:22:43] knocked out for an hour
[1:22:45] and when he gets back up and it's not
[1:22:47] brother cape was telling everybody he's
[1:22:50] changed but when his partner got back
[1:22:52] the partner recognized man what has
[1:22:55] happened to you out here in the middle
[1:22:57] of the ocean
[1:22:59] man something's you you have changed
[1:23:01] like like moses that had had they had to
[1:23:03] put a veil on his face brother came with
[1:23:06] that change everybody could have an
[1:23:09] experience like that with god
[1:23:12] and when you get your own experience
[1:23:13] your own testimony you'll let nobody
[1:23:16] take it from you
[1:23:18] you can't
[1:23:19] my my failures hey come on somebody my
[1:23:22] mistakes
[1:23:23] my past you can't take it from me
[1:23:25] because i know god
[1:23:27] has changed me
[1:23:30] a man that's brave or stand on his
[1:23:32] testimony
[1:23:34] when everything else is falling down
[1:23:36] around them i'ma stand on my testimony
[1:23:39] oh hallelujah that's why you got to have
[1:23:41] you got to have your own experience with
[1:23:42] god
[1:23:43] amen you can have your own testimony no
[1:23:45] matter what anybody else is doing i'm
[1:23:48] standing on my own two feet
[1:23:50] i know what god has done for me
[1:23:54] hey hallelujah
[1:23:56] hey when god does it that way i mean the
[1:23:58] whole world could be crumbling the whole
[1:24:00] world could be crumbling around you
[1:24:02] but god i got something you gave it to
[1:24:05] me god
[1:24:06] oh hallelujah god don't want cowards god
[1:24:08] wants men that's brave
[1:24:11] he can't use a coward that's run down
[1:24:13] and afraid to testify of your healing
[1:24:16] tell your neighbors your boss what god
[1:24:17] has done for you and give praise to
[1:24:19] christ ashamed to speak up in the hour
[1:24:21] when the trial comes
[1:24:23] you're afraid to say that you're a
[1:24:24] christian god can't use you i doubt he
[1:24:26] says such
[1:24:28] such as that uh that's right you're
[1:24:30] you're not much good for nothing for
[1:24:33] anything then he says but this eagle
[1:24:35] i noticed him being brave
[1:24:38] i noticed this eagle being brave and i
[1:24:40] thought i'll try out this bravery and i
[1:24:42] said fella those great big gray eyes
[1:24:45] looking at me
[1:24:47] and then the pie squirrel and i said do
[1:24:48] you know
[1:24:49] i could shoot you
[1:24:51] uh which which i wouldn't i admire him
[1:24:54] too much i said do you know i can shoot
[1:24:56] you he just kept moving his wings
[1:24:59] and i said i'll test it
[1:25:01] i grabbed my gun
[1:25:03] looked for the gun jumped and he looked
[1:25:05] at me
[1:25:06] and he kept moving his wings
[1:25:09] oh i said thank you father i see what it
[1:25:12] is
[1:25:13] you have provided that eagle with two
[1:25:15] wings and as long as he can feel that
[1:25:18] those those wings are in condition
[1:25:21] see he is blown down bone down by the
[1:25:23] storm but he's just testing his wings
[1:25:26] and as long as he can feel that those
[1:25:28] wings were in condition
[1:25:30] he knows that he can beat me into the
[1:25:32] top of them bushes he has confidence in
[1:25:34] his god given protection
[1:25:36] and if the eagle can have confidence in
[1:25:39] his god-given protection
[1:25:41] what ought the church should do with the
[1:25:42] holy spirit your god-given protection
[1:25:44] and tutor when sickness strikes or when
[1:25:47] trouble strikes
[1:25:49] oh i i i we got something we can lean on
[1:25:52] right and i was just thinking you know
[1:25:54] the the
[1:25:55] the storm forced the eagle down
[1:26:00] the storm forced the eagle down and
[1:26:03] oftentimes in life as men
[1:26:05] there are various storms that come into
[1:26:07] our life
[1:26:08] and they force
[1:26:09] the eagles down
[1:26:11] amen uh some of the storms in life maybe
[1:26:15] you lose a job or even your whole career
[1:26:18] right
[1:26:20] maybe loss of a marriage
[1:26:23] a divorce can force an eagle down
[1:26:26] a man maybe the loss of a child uh
[1:26:29] through death
[1:26:30] or
[1:26:31] either through uh being a runaway glory
[1:26:34] to god or maybe a child to drug
[1:26:36] addiction or alcoholism when you know
[1:26:38] you've raised them differently maybe a
[1:26:40] child that's uh determined to follow the
[1:26:43] things of the world and you want them to
[1:26:44] follow the word of god amen you lose a
[1:26:47] child these things can force an eagle
[1:26:50] down
[1:26:51] but an eagle when you're down just
[1:26:53] remember you can just kind of flap those
[1:26:55] wings
[1:26:56] amen god gave you two wings glory to god
[1:27:00] and and those two wings should keep you
[1:27:02] in action amen that's what brother
[1:27:05] branham told us that the cherubim were
[1:27:06] given two wings to keep them in action
[1:27:09] uh another thing those two wings amen uh
[1:27:12] provide to us glory to god is the wings
[1:27:15] of prayer
[1:27:16] glory and we know that when we can take
[1:27:18] things to the lord in prayer somehow
[1:27:20] somewhere god gonna change this thing
[1:27:22] glory to god another thing i thought
[1:27:24] about those two wings is one wing
[1:27:26] represent the old testament amen the
[1:27:28] other wing represent the new testament
[1:27:30] and somewhere between there i can find
[1:27:32] me a scripture that i can mount up on
[1:27:35] wings like eagles
[1:27:37] hallelujah and i'm gonna get through
[1:27:39] this situation somehow
[1:27:41] i'm gonna be brave i'm gonna be strong
[1:27:45] glory to god amen let's go back to the
[1:27:48] scripture here first corinthians 16
[1:27:51] and 13.
[1:27:57] lord
[1:28:02] um we find something i just want to kind
[1:28:04] of break this break into this just for a
[1:28:06] little bit says watchy
[1:28:09] stand fast in the faith
[1:28:11] quit you like men be strong
[1:28:16] uh just kind of looked at that word
[1:28:18] watch at the very uh beginning of this
[1:28:20] this scripture
[1:28:21] and watch means amen to be awake
[1:28:26] to be vigilant vigilant
[1:28:28] amen uh it says uh to watch
[1:28:32] metaphorically and i'm using greek
[1:28:34] lexicon definition here
[1:28:36] it must give strict attention to
[1:28:40] be
[1:28:40] cautious be active
[1:28:44] amen to take heed lest through remission
[1:28:48] and ambulance some destructive calamity
[1:28:51] calamities suddenly overtake one now i
[1:28:53] wanna i want you to catch this now um
[1:28:57] give strict attention to
[1:28:59] be active be cautious
[1:29:02] and take heedless through remission
[1:29:05] or and indolence
[1:29:08] some destructive calamity suddenly
[1:29:09] overtake one now what remission is is is
[1:29:12] led up so uh less through letting up
[1:29:17] if a father you know lets up sometime
[1:29:20] and he doesn't stay actively involved
[1:29:23] i'm talking about when you've been hurt
[1:29:26] that's
[1:29:27] when you've been hurt your children hurt
[1:29:28] you but somehow you still got to
[1:29:30] recognize you still daddy
[1:29:32] amen and they're not going to get no
[1:29:34] other daddy so daddy can't let up
[1:29:36] remember i told you hey man oftentimes
[1:29:38] when um uh uh uh when we get dad dad
[1:29:41] beat dads and somebody's not paying
[1:29:43] their child support it's because
[1:29:44] something has happened between the
[1:29:46] father and the mother and and the person
[1:29:48] that suffers the most is the children
[1:29:51] because of what happens between the
[1:29:52] father and the mother so father has to
[1:29:54] be intentional about remaining engaged
[1:29:58] not just with his money
[1:30:02] oh glory to god
[1:30:04] a father has to be intentional about
[1:30:06] engaging you know he can't let up he
[1:30:08] can't pull back from the children
[1:30:10] because oftentimes you know we see this
[1:30:12] in in many marriages uh you know
[1:30:14] sometimes uh uh a father he'll withdraw
[1:30:18] his financial support when he's trying
[1:30:19] to punish the mother
[1:30:21] a man a mother will dr withdraw her
[1:30:24] emotional support
[1:30:26] come on this is what happens in family
[1:30:28] and the children are the ones that go
[1:30:30] lacking
[1:30:32] you need both a father and a mother
[1:30:36] hallelujah
[1:30:37] there are times that my kids will
[1:30:39] intentionally get me involved in some of
[1:30:41] the you know choices that they got to
[1:30:43] make they want to know what my advice is
[1:30:45] they'll go to mama to get mama's advice
[1:30:46] but they also sometimes it's good i'm
[1:30:48] gonna also go to my daddy and talk to my
[1:30:50] daddy let's see what he think about this
[1:30:52] even if you already know what his
[1:30:54] thoughts are
[1:30:55] imagine noah was your father
[1:30:57] and noah and yuki's daddy you know i was
[1:30:59] they had a job over here and i was
[1:31:01] thinking about uh applying for it um you
[1:31:04] know
[1:31:05] no i got work for you to do right here
[1:31:08] you're gonna build this arc
[1:31:10] and you know the other thing about it
[1:31:12] you're not even gonna get
[1:31:14] paid imagine if noah was your father
[1:31:19] but not imagine if you would have left
[1:31:22] noah's house
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:24] running out there doing your own the
[1:31:26] daddy i'm tired of you and then the rain
[1:31:28] come because pride wouldn't let one of
[1:31:29] them boys come back home
[1:31:32] pride would not allow them to come back
[1:31:34] home pride is what keeps people out
[1:31:36] there today pride stops people from
[1:31:38] getting things right with god
[1:31:40] pride will not allow that boy but by him
[1:31:42] just subject himself to his daddy's
[1:31:44] counsel
[1:31:46] now now now you got to understand god
[1:31:48] did not speak to anybody else
[1:31:53] god didn't speak to noah's wife
[1:31:55] god didn't speak to noah's sons god
[1:31:58] didn't speak to uncles aunties teachers
[1:32:01] didn't speak to nobody the only one who
[1:32:03] had the word of the lord
[1:32:05] was noah
[1:32:07] and them boys had to subject themselves
[1:32:09] to what dad is speaking to my to to what
[1:32:12] god is speaking to my daddy
[1:32:16] it's the truth anyhow
[1:32:18] but if they would by by them just being
[1:32:20] obedient and subjective
[1:32:22] it saved their lives
[1:32:26] all right even if you know daddy gonna
[1:32:28] say something that's against what you
[1:32:29] want to do get his advice
[1:32:31] amen here look at this
[1:32:35] through remission that means let up and
[1:32:38] that's so dad is i wanna i wanna
[1:32:39] encourage you as fathers remain engaged
[1:32:42] no matter where your children are
[1:32:44] in their life remain engaged
[1:32:46] remain engaged they know what's right
[1:32:48] and what's wrong
[1:32:50] every time they look at you they know
[1:32:52] but just remain engaged another thing it
[1:32:55] says through remission and indolence
[1:32:58] indolence is avoidance
[1:33:01] i want to say that i want to make sure
[1:33:03] we get
[1:33:04] ambulance i mean is avoidance a father
[1:33:07] intentionally avoiding certain things
[1:33:11] because he don't want to be bothered
[1:33:12] but you have to understand that's a
[1:33:14] trick from the enemy because when you
[1:33:16] when when you when
[1:33:18] this description says watch
[1:33:20] right watchy so if you're not watching
[1:33:23] and you let up or you avoid he says then
[1:33:26] some destructive calamity suddenly will
[1:33:29] overtake one
[1:33:32] now you think it's bad now
[1:33:35] satan want to make it worse
[1:33:37] but but as a father
[1:33:40] a father can stand there a man just his
[1:33:42] presence
[1:33:44] keeps things intact
[1:33:46] let me just give you all a quick quick
[1:33:48] quick example you know i remember a few
[1:33:50] years ago my wife sharing this uh with
[1:33:51] me
[1:33:53] there was a
[1:33:54] a group of elephants
[1:33:56] that they wanted to do
[1:33:57] a um
[1:33:59] uh
[1:34:00] they want to just kind of do some
[1:34:01] testing with and
[1:34:03] and and you know experiment
[1:34:05] and so they they decided
[1:34:07] that with these this this pack of
[1:34:09] elephants that they were going to get
[1:34:10] all the older male elephants and pull
[1:34:12] them out
[1:34:13] of the tribe and kind of put them in
[1:34:15] another part of the jungle and um
[1:34:18] another country even took him flat flew
[1:34:20] him to a whole other country some kind
[1:34:21] of way and
[1:34:23] you know so they got these elephants
[1:34:24] there and they noticed that
[1:34:26] when they took the elephants out here
[1:34:28] the younger younger elephants younger
[1:34:30] male elephants with the mothers but
[1:34:31] they've taken the older males out and
[1:34:34] just left them there with the mothers
[1:34:36] and they noticed that uh they would come
[1:34:38] into that jungle area and they'd see
[1:34:40] different
[1:34:41] all the rhinos just dying off
[1:34:43] and they couldn't understand what was
[1:34:45] going on was like like somebody was
[1:34:46] taking a spear and just going right into
[1:34:48] these rhinos and killing them all
[1:34:50] and like well what hunters out here
[1:34:51] doing this who's doing this
[1:34:53] and uh they said no there's not nobody
[1:34:55] hunting this is this is this something
[1:34:57] else going on so they decided to bring
[1:35:00] the the male el the older male elephants
[1:35:03] back into the situation reintroduce them
[1:35:06] to the tribe and when they brought them
[1:35:08] back they noticed that the rhinos
[1:35:09] weren't dying anymore
[1:35:11] and what was going on is that the
[1:35:12] younger the younger elephants were the
[1:35:16] ones taking their their tusks and just
[1:35:18] going right through these rhinos
[1:35:20] and because they didn't have guidance
[1:35:23] the male elephants provided the guidance
[1:35:25] and i want to tell you this you know
[1:35:27] mothers can only do so much
[1:35:30] but you got to have fathers
[1:35:32] you got to have fathers begin to provide
[1:35:34] certain types of guidance and it's only
[1:35:36] when they brought those fathers back
[1:35:38] into the picture that the rhinos stopped
[1:35:40] dying the father's got to remain active
[1:35:44] the father's got to remain engaged
[1:35:47] the father's got to remain part of the
[1:35:49] whole structure
[1:35:52] let's look at this
[1:35:55] this uh
[1:35:56] next statement here in this scripture
[1:35:58] says watch he stand fast in the faith
[1:36:01] stand fast in the faith and and when we
[1:36:04] look at stand fast
[1:36:05] uh that means to
[1:36:07] uh to stand firm
[1:36:10] to persevere
[1:36:12] to persist and and i love it this this
[1:36:15] this greek definition to keep one's
[1:36:18] standing
[1:36:20] don't change your position
[1:36:22] as a father you got to be able to keep
[1:36:24] one standing when you standing on the
[1:36:26] word
[1:36:27] keep once now if you ain't standing the
[1:36:29] word change your position
[1:36:31] but if you when you stand on the word
[1:36:33] keep one standing don't let it down
[1:36:35] don't don't let down the
[1:36:37] daddies don't let it down amen you know
[1:36:40] it's going to take more than that from
[1:36:41] your son and your daughter in order to
[1:36:43] make it you got to be the one to hold
[1:36:44] that standard
[1:36:46] amen the world want to pull here in the
[1:36:48] world keep your standing
[1:36:52] all right look at this
[1:36:53] i want to just um
[1:36:56] i want to just uh read a little
[1:36:58] something here
[1:37:02] there's a a a a quote
[1:37:05] that i want to read out of expectation
[1:37:07] and i'll just kind of set this up for a
[1:37:09] little bit brother branham was talking
[1:37:11] about
[1:37:12] in vancouver they had a uh um they heard
[1:37:15] about a contest where they were riding
[1:37:17] bicycles and you had to be able to ride
[1:37:19] the bicycle across this wire with with
[1:37:22] no hands on the handlebars you had to be
[1:37:25] able to ride this bike and the swin
[1:37:27] bicycle company was going to was going
[1:37:29] to give
[1:37:30] any boy prize that could ride it
[1:37:33] uh so many yards without falling off
[1:37:36] and so some of the boys got to riding a
[1:37:38] man the um
[1:37:40] uh
[1:37:41] you know the bikes and everybody get up
[1:37:43] there they just fall right off they just
[1:37:44] fall right off and they said one of the
[1:37:46] mama's boys they call her my mama's boy
[1:37:49] he got up on his bike and he took over
[1:37:51] they just thought for sure this boy
[1:37:52] wasn't gonna make it
[1:37:53] a man a man a man but somehow the boy he
[1:37:57] wrote that thing all the way down to the
[1:37:59] end and they made a comment here
[1:38:02] here in the message expectations said
[1:38:03] fellas i tell you what you did
[1:38:05] say when you got on
[1:38:07] they give you a push you started off and
[1:38:09] you was watching like this trying to
[1:38:10] keep yourself on the board
[1:38:12] so that's what made you get wiggly
[1:38:15] amen and nervous and fall off he said i
[1:38:17] never looked down there i said i watched
[1:38:19] the m and just kept my eyes on the end
[1:38:22] and rode steady right to the end so yeah
[1:38:25] i watched the end hallelujah so that is
[1:38:28] when you're standing firm
[1:38:30] you're not making a decision
[1:38:32] for now
[1:38:34] come on somebody you're watching the end
[1:38:37] to see what's going to be the end of

[1:38:52] hallelujah watch this he says
[1:38:54] i watched the end and just kept my eyes
[1:38:56] on the road and rolled uh steady right
[1:38:59] to the end and one of the reasons i i
[1:39:01] want my kids to grow closer to god i
[1:39:02] realize the rapture is at hand

[1:40:03] be strong
[1:40:05] quit you like men be strong
[1:40:09] think about that
[1:40:11] quit you
[1:40:12] like men
[1:40:14] and what quit quit does not actually
[1:40:16] mean what you thinking in your mind
[1:40:18] quit don't mean quit
[1:40:20] in this portion of scripture quit action
[1:40:23] means to be brave
[1:40:26] quit you like men means to be brave
[1:40:29] to show oneself a man be brave
[1:40:32] hallelujah and what is brave brave is
[1:40:35] amen it's an adjective it's uh it's
[1:40:38] you're ready to face and endure danger
[1:40:41] or pain

[1:40:48] amen you're showing courage in the midst
[1:40:50] of whatever it is that you're facing
[1:40:52] uh obvious examples of somebody that was
[1:40:54] brave jesus went to the cross it showed
[1:40:58] us that he was brave
[1:41:00] david when he faced goliath it showed
[1:41:03] that he was brave amen david had a few
[1:41:06] men that would fight and br they went to
[1:41:09] get water fought through philistines to
[1:41:11] go get the water fought through phyllis
[1:41:13] got the water and went back to to take
[1:41:15] david to what had to fight through
[1:41:17] philistines on the way back it showed
[1:41:19] their bravery
[1:41:21] and david got the water and then poured
[1:41:22] it out didn't even drink it men almost i
[1:41:24] mean men almost lost their lives but it
[1:41:27] showed their bravery they were willing
[1:41:29] to endure the danger they were willing
[1:41:31] to endure the pain they were willing to
[1:41:34] show so show courage as fathers we got
[1:41:36] to be willing
[1:41:38] to endure pain

[1:44:40] so yes there's a balance we got to live
[1:44:42] in this world and i and i want you to
[1:44:44] live the best life you can live while
[1:44:46] you're here
[1:44:46] amen ain't no sense and uh uh let me
[1:44:49] just put it this way ain't no sense in
[1:44:51] us shortchanging ourselves on this side
[1:44:54] when i'm headed to streets ago
[1:44:56] right
[1:44:57] glory to god i'm headed the streets ago
[1:44:59] so i'm going to show them
[1:45:01] change myself on this side i'm gonna
[1:45:02] live the best life i can here but i'm
[1:45:04] gonna keep god involved
[1:45:06] i want to read the scripture here this
[1:45:08] uh quit you like men go to go with me in
[1:45:11] 2nd samuel
[1:45:13] chapter 10.
[1:45:30] praise the lord
[1:45:32] uh second samuel chapter 10
[1:45:34] and uh verse
[1:45:37] 6 is where i want to start from
[1:45:41] this
[1:45:42] is a time in david's
[1:45:46] reign
[1:45:47] where he was um
[1:45:49] he's actually complimenting somebody
[1:45:54] and they took his compliment as a threat
[1:45:58] they misinterpreted the compliment and
[1:46:00] they thought it was a threat so um
[1:46:03] uh in thinking there's a threat they
[1:46:05] they responded in a in a different way
[1:46:07] like david sent these men to him sent
[1:46:09] some his soldiers and and and i think
[1:46:12] the bible said they cut the men's
[1:46:13] garments off
[1:46:15] and uh so they was walking down the
[1:46:17] street uh half covered half naked
[1:46:20] which a lot of people do today
[1:46:24] right but uh it was it was embarrassment
[1:46:26] they also shaved their beards and you
[1:46:28] know did all kind of thing and it was
[1:46:29] embarrassment to these to these soldiers
[1:46:31] uh so david you know say you know what
[1:46:33] we're gonna have to go here and and
[1:46:35] fight you know we gotta we we got to
[1:46:37] show them that they can't they can't
[1:46:38] handle things that way so joab a man one
[1:46:42] of david's uh military leaders is
[1:46:44] leading a group of um of soldiers out
[1:46:47] into the battle uh he and his brothers
[1:46:49] are leading to this battle so let's
[1:46:50] let's pick up
[1:46:51] uh in verse six what happens when the
[1:46:54] children of ahmad
[1:46:57] saw that they stink before david
[1:46:59] and what this means is that their
[1:47:01] actions were not approved of
[1:47:04] uh you know david didn't like that and
[1:47:05] david was gonna respond to it right
[1:47:08] they stink before david
[1:47:13] the children of amman
[1:47:15] sent and hired the syrians of beth harab
[1:47:19] and the syrians of zoba
[1:47:21] thousand foot men and a uh king maca
[1:47:25] thousand men and i've ish ish top twelve
[1:47:28] thousand men
[1:47:29] and when david heard of it he sent joab
[1:47:31] and all the host of the mighty man
[1:47:34] said the children of amman came out
[1:47:37] and put the battle and array at the
[1:47:39] entering in of the gate and the syrians
[1:47:41] of zoba and the rahab and ishtab and
[1:47:44] makkah were by themselves in the field
[1:47:47] when joab saw that the front of the
[1:47:50] battle was against him before and behind
[1:47:53] he chose of all the choice men of israel
[1:47:55] and put them in a ray against the
[1:47:57] syrians
[1:47:59] and the rest of the people he delivered
[1:48:00] into the hand of abishai his brother
[1:48:03] that he might put them an array against
[1:48:05] the children of ahmad
[1:48:06] alright so they got syrians got the
[1:48:08] children of ahmad in the middle of this
[1:48:10] this great battle
[1:48:12] and he says um
[1:48:13] and he said if the syrians
[1:48:16] be too strong for me then thou shalt
[1:48:18] help me
[1:48:20] but the children of our mind be too
[1:48:22] strong for thee
[1:48:23] then i will come and help thee
[1:48:25] it's good to know sometimes as fathers
[1:48:27] that you got other brothers standing
[1:48:29] with you amen to fight with you in the
[1:48:31] battle
[1:48:32] amen here in verse 12 says be of good
[1:48:34] courage
[1:48:35] and let us play the man for our people
[1:48:39] amen let us play the men
[1:48:42] uh for our people and for the cities of
[1:48:44] our god
[1:48:45] and the lord do that which seem seen
[1:48:47] with uh him good and when they're
[1:48:49] playing the men this mean they're going
[1:48:50] to be brave
[1:48:52] amen they're going to be brave they're
[1:48:53] going to face this thing head on they're
[1:48:55] not running from it they run into it
[1:48:57] and
[1:48:58] and let me just keep reading here
[1:49:00] um
[1:49:02] verse 14
[1:49:04] 13. and joab drew nigh and the people
[1:49:06] that were with him unto the battle
[1:49:09] against the syrians and they fled before
[1:49:11] him
[1:49:11] and when the children of amman saw that
[1:49:13] the syrians were fled
[1:49:15] uh then fled they also before abhishah
[1:49:18] and entered into the city
[1:49:19] so joab returned from the children of
[1:49:21] ahmad and and came
[1:49:23] to jerusalem a little stop there uh i
[1:49:26] just want to just kind of just share
[1:49:27] here um
[1:49:29] when david sent these men out joab and
[1:49:31] and and uh these other warriors out
[1:49:34] um joab recognized that they were
[1:49:36] surrounded you know and that this was
[1:49:38] gonna this is gonna be really something
[1:49:40] so we got the syrians on one side and we
[1:49:42] got children i'm out on the other side
[1:49:44] there's going to be something so you
[1:49:46] know when when um when he realized they
[1:49:48] were surrounded it would have been easy
[1:49:50] for him to just throw in the towel
[1:49:52] and sometimes his father's amen we find
[1:49:55] ourselves in situations where we realize
[1:49:56] we just surrounded surrounded with this
[1:49:58] problem surrounded with that problem
[1:50:01] surrounded with that problem i mean my
[1:50:02] god we're just foolish we just surround
[1:50:04] it and that's the time where fathers
[1:50:06] actually want to just throw in the towel
[1:50:08] right but i want to say don't throw in
[1:50:09] the towel be strong and be brave
[1:50:12] amen be brave be strong at the time and
[1:50:14] here's what here's what i felt and
[1:50:16] reading the story uh they made a
[1:50:18] decision to fight with what they had
[1:50:21] they couldn't go get no more uh but i'm
[1:50:24] a fight with what i got i mean i'mma
[1:50:26] trust the two wings like the eagles i'ma
[1:50:28] trust the two wings i'ma trust the old
[1:50:30] testament i'm gonna trust the new
[1:50:31] testament i'm gonna be active i'm gonna
[1:50:33] do everything i can and fight with what
[1:50:35] i got
[1:50:36] right and they made a decision uh to
[1:50:39] fight with what they had and and i want
[1:50:40] to the other thing that i i like is in
[1:50:42] the midst of them uh going through this
[1:50:45] this this great surrounding they devised
[1:50:48] a strategy to help them overcome the
[1:50:51] enemy glory to god it might have seemed
[1:50:53] like a it might have seemed like this
[1:50:55] ain't gonna work at all what i'm doing

[1:52:32] he talked about
[1:52:34] and i won't read this one but i'll just
[1:52:36] tell you he talked about arnold von
[1:52:37] winkelrit
[1:52:39] and how this man was so brave
[1:52:41] uh he was a gallant man and he realized
[1:52:44] that uh they were surrounded by the
[1:52:46] armies and they they knew that they were
[1:52:48] just on the way to defeat and you know
[1:52:50] and and arnold uh von winklery there in
[1:52:54] switzerland he was there in the battle
[1:52:56] and he did something that just uh just
[1:52:58] kind of inspired courage and all the men
[1:53:01] and uh he um
[1:53:02] the the weapons that they had were less
[1:53:04] superior than the army that they were
[1:53:07] fighting and it says you know they had
[1:53:09] these spears and they they were coming
[1:53:11] right in after him and he said you know
[1:53:12] we got to do something so he he uh he
[1:53:14] says you know what i i got a family over
[1:53:17] there i might not see him ever again i
[1:53:18] got a wife and kids i might not ever see
[1:53:20] him again but this day i'm gonna give my
[1:53:21] life for my country
[1:53:23] and they're like well what you gonna do
[1:53:24] arnold so you just watch me everybody
[1:53:26] just follow me and he took off into the
[1:53:28] middle of uh the where the where the
[1:53:30] toughest uh part of the battle was he
[1:53:33] took off running down start making a a
[1:53:35] big scene make way for liberty make way
[1:53:37] for the night what in the world is guy
[1:53:39] talking about make way for liberty it
[1:53:41] just took off running and as they took
[1:53:43] all these spears uh what they said this
[1:53:45] guy's a crazy man all of them took these
[1:53:47] spirits into going right at this guy
[1:53:48] arnold and arnold reach with all his arm
[1:53:51] reach with everything he had pulled the
[1:53:52] spears into him then realized that uh
[1:53:55] the the warriors by arnold taking on
[1:53:57] spears the warriors had nothing to fight
[1:53:59] with now his men could beat down those
[1:54:01] warriors he was brave
[1:54:04] he gave his life
[1:54:06] oh hallelujah brother branham says just
[1:54:08] the same as christ going to the cross
[1:54:10] to give his life for us he was brave
[1:54:13] sometimes fathers we got to be willing
[1:54:15] to give our life
[1:54:17] we got to stand in the gap as christ
[1:54:19] stood in the gap we have to be brave we
[1:54:22] have to be strong
[1:54:24] hearing this quote
[1:54:25] out of god had explained
[1:54:28] the prophet says this
[1:54:30] in my life
[1:54:31] i made many mistakes
[1:54:34] i've done lots of things that's wrong
[1:54:36] uh probably if i live much longer i'll
[1:54:38] do many more perhaps some of them will
[1:54:40] be stumbling blocks in your way i hope
[1:54:42] that you forgive me
[1:54:44] some of the things i've done it might
[1:54:45] might have been a stumbling blocking
[1:54:47] your way
[1:54:48] can you forgive me
[1:54:49] not just hold it against me
[1:54:51] but can you forgive me
[1:54:54] since i was reading of abraham and how
[1:54:56] that the flusterations that he had
[1:54:59] the things that he did he doubted god he
[1:55:01] lied about his wife and everything but
[1:55:02] when his divine commentary was written
[1:55:04] in romans 4 it never mentioned his
[1:55:06] mistakes
[1:55:09] but i said abraham never staggered at
[1:55:10] the unbelief through god but was strong
[1:55:12] all of his mistakes was all forgotten
[1:55:14] about when the divine commentary of his
[1:55:16] life was written says his frustrations
[1:55:19] wasn't even mentioned his mistakes
[1:55:20] wasn't mentioned brethren
[1:55:22] i hope that when my commentary is read
[1:55:24] that day
[1:55:25] that he'll rub mine out too and won't
[1:55:27] think about them i hope you do too
[1:55:30] god bless you
[1:55:33] and when brother branham says this then
[1:55:34] brother uh
[1:55:36] tommy hicks
[1:55:38] comes up to the microphone
[1:55:40] and he made the following comments and
[1:55:41] i'm glad that they didn't cut this part
[1:55:43] of the tape off because this is very
[1:55:44] good for brother tommy hicks he says
[1:55:46] i think that we can say this morning to
[1:55:48] sum up everything that's been said with
[1:55:49] these words christ in me the hope of
[1:55:51] glory
[1:55:52] is that satan please christ in me
[1:55:58] the hope of glory
[1:56:00] all right there's in and outs and overs
[1:56:02] in life of every man
[1:56:05] it says i have a message i'm not going
[1:56:07] to speak i have a message i believe that
[1:56:09] every christian has been jesus my heart
[1:56:10] is stirred this morning i believe that
[1:56:12] for many of us some things that that
[1:56:14] disturb us make us better men and women
[1:56:16] of god
[1:56:18] and they make this statement says babe
[1:56:19] ruth
[1:56:20] was known as the home run king
[1:56:23] it is but did you know that babe ruth
[1:56:24] was also the strikeout
[1:56:26] king he says he struck out more times
[1:56:29] than he ever made home runs
[1:56:31] he struck out 1 330 times he only made
[1:56:34] 860 home runs but every time babe ruth
[1:56:38] struck out
[1:56:39] he went back to the dugout
[1:56:41] when the old umpire holler you're out
[1:56:44] he went back to the dugout and he rubbed
[1:56:45] his hands
[1:56:47] and picked up the bat and pointed over
[1:56:49] the fence and he always said i feel
[1:56:51] sorry for that picture out there
[1:56:54] see there's nothing wrong in striking
[1:56:56] out
[1:56:57] but remember pick up that bat
[1:57:00] because christ and me the hope of glory
[1:57:02] say it again please
[1:57:04] christ in me
[1:57:06] the hope of glory
[1:57:08] he says it's everything
[1:57:10] everything that's right is everything
[1:57:12] uh arguing and fighting will never get
[1:57:15] the job done
[1:57:17] we're too close amen to the other side
[1:57:19] we've reached a point of no return
[1:57:21] it says how many times that i've heard
[1:57:23] the captain call back on the plane we've
[1:57:25] now reached a point of no return
[1:57:27] not long ago i heard a voice from
[1:57:29] another world that spoke to me this
[1:57:31] spoke to me and said son you've reached
[1:57:33] a point of no return
[1:57:35] that means i'm closer to the other side
[1:57:37] than i am from the point where i started
[1:57:40] from
