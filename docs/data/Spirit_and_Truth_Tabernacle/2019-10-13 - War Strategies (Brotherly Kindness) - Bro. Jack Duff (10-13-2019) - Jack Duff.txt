a man and just everybody just made their way out and we're again you did that and we just we just really really appreciate that no return to us so just just moved amen by the support that they received him and just so good see our lords lords just moving on Friday night over there my brother Sean is a super seal came out to church and that was a real blessing to see them last night my sister was Darren church that was a real blessing to see her in a manner just you know I just know that so many were encouraged they've been my vital services so thank you all for going and making them a man work what they were a man we certainly certainly appreciate that I also want to thank Lord for his traveling mercies to all the saints that were away on last weekend [Applause] [Music] Canada a man we had we had a quite a few that word were out but seemed like we had a lot of food show up for church last week - that was a real blessing they met him and brother late and it's did a wonderful job he told us that he won got preached at heart but church pulled it right out huh three so that was that was real real special we thank the Lord for that and also I I had to leave on Wednesday and go up to Galax Virginia for a funeral service there and now the family was just telling me how much they just appreciate deserving of their loved one mr. Baum he was a gentleman that lived out of the which'll be Florida that we would go and visit periodically just to you know pray with him and everything and you know his caregiver they actually have we call him caregiver but Pancho just they just did what other human should do and he said he just could he saw him there in law and said just can't leave me here alone feeling like this and you know just the way that you're going through things I just can't leave you like this so just got to do it I gotta do it then fine Cho said that mr. Baum had something where he had to wear a diaper and said he he went through 34 diapers I want to say in about one or two nights about 34 diapers so upon Joe called me and you know and and I went out to visit and I just you know said a word of Prayer for mr. Vaughn he said he said after you prayed that prayer I want changing diapers like that anymore [Applause] [Music] so I say well praise the Lord you know and I think I just saw enough for him to say that there's something about this group of people so long I mean yesterday Saturday morning Pancho Simha meet you at the church you know with Jovi and it came to service on yesterday morning so that was a real blessing to see I understood everything the preacher was saying and he said I might go back this morning so I don't know we'll find out if he if he showed up at night but you know our hope is that when people going through things like this they're transitioning and that if we can just say something to help somebody long-awaited they'll get glory out of it we took a sermon title amen the value of eternal life you know I told that people say out the reason I would leave West Palm Beach to come to Galax is because I value eternal life and I trust that God will say something too to call somebody you know to turn their heart towards a little series and I would go see Mr Bond because I value eternal life and then we do these things because there's value to eternal life phrasing when I was you know we've come to church and brother Branham was preaching and why Christ speak and he started off and he made a statement that struck me then and I said when I saw it a circuit is cisterna and I'm taking you know to get laxen you said they said if I if I had the opportunity to go back and be 20 years old again I had a button that I could press and go back and be 20 years old again and they're saying and live at the age of 24 about 10,000 years but in the end it was 10,000 years be lost or I had a blessing that I could press right now die right now and going to eternal life so I would press the button to die right now I go towards eternal life I said wow what a statement there's value to eternal life right so you know we were just moved by that and I was sharing that with and you know I just pray that some seed was dropped in a brother sermon say they heard the gospel today brother I say well praise the Lord were certainly happy a man that we could serve the family and trust and God would just give glory and our going make man income and so it meant thank you for your prayers thank you for your prayers thank you thank you musicians appreciate y'all so much a man appreciate y'all so much we got the best musicians in the message Friday we got the best perch in the message by the way [Applause] the best Saints of the message don't deal with junk so we thank God we thank God and really really just you know dis appreciate all you Saints a man I mentioned our last week last Sunday you'll continue to keep sister brown sister Laura sister Linda and their brother brother Michael in prayer they lost a loved one a brother that they lost up in the Baltimore area and they'll be going to bury him this week so keep them keep them in prayers their way that Lord would just be with them and give them our traveling mercies as they go to and fro praise the Lord you all heard from my brother Troy I mentioned that he'd be away for the next couple of weeks the family went on a little vacation and certainly thank God for for that sister Dixon and and sister Shonda and you know just the whole family got on up there in the mountains just just enjoying themselves and you know and you know brother Troy is a tiny they were supposed to be going to brother Nathan's there and in Louisville Jeffersonville area New Albany they were supposed to come with us but at the last minute they had the cancer to plan since the time he got called in on her job and had to kind of work some of the shelters because of Hurricane Dorian that was approaching and and then brother troll working at the airport they just kind of cancelled you know it said we can't have anybody out at this time so they they allow them to take time this week so they decided well while we are always all the way up here we might as well go on over the brother Frey and and be part of those meetings I said that's a good plan so they'll be there and I'll be traveling up to for those meetings as well so I solicit your prayers I'm going for I think I have to preach on Thursday night so I'll go for Thursday night Friday but I'll be back home on Saturday because I want to be here on Sunday my schedules been really really tight as of Lading and I some things that I had actually planned and then things that just end up on your schedule right one of the things that I did plans at the end of the month October Isaiah Brooks do not be out there to visit him in in Des Moines Iowa and you know and I had that plan for four months and then I was setting all these other things just kind of jumped on the calendar I say well Lord you know we'll do it we can't so I was I was really really weary and tired and and as I was just looking at my calendar and some of the things I had on I said Lord that I'm gonna need some strength I just can't do this on my own and and I just felt God just give me a strength a man as I travel you know there to Galax it was getting in that midnight you know it's not easy leaving here 10 o'clock at night you get there at midnight in hotel room 1 o'clock in the morning have to be at the the service at 11:00 and that's an hour drive from your hotel and and I had brother Sherman Collins there brother if you care early we can do this we can do that I just don't see it happening and so I'll certainly get there as soon as I can you know and we get there and you know and do the service and spend a little time the family didn't go to our drive back to the airport to jump on the plane to get home at at 12:00 again and that plane running late and it's like you get home to your bay at 1:00 o'clock in the morning then you got services that brother smiley the next day so it starts to wear on you you know it really really starts swearing but you know we just think III said this I rather be tired for Jesus I rather be wat for Jesus then than anything else and I realized we gotta take care of our health we got to be careful in these things so I do have a little little something coming up next month where I'm gonna get four days of relaxation and a little vacation baby I have to try to insert things like that too so no services no I mean no preaching that I know of unless somebody approached me and xrx ask me questions but but no scheduled services or nothing like that you know just just relaxation so four days of that and I can see that coming so you all keep us in prayer amen keep us in prayer god bless you well we want to continue our journey a man we have a couple more sermons in this series of war strategies and and you know I pray that as we're going through these that you would use some of the strategies for the trials that you're facing all right God don't just give us this just so it can be something going when they're not the other but this is for the trial that you face it I mean it's not something that's gonna happen you know 40 or 50 years when I was happening right now that's right and if you would just apply some of this strategy you might be able to overcome all right so so we want to just kind of continue amen our journey here in in war strategies we want to deal with the subject of brotherly kindness today applying the strategy of brotherly kindness a man so let's stand to our feet let's read a couple scriptures and and then we will go from there our theme is found in 2nd Peter chapter 1 a man-thing and the foundation of this this this series is here in 2nd Peter chapter 1 starting at verse 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and decide this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity but if these things be in you right so they have to be in you manifesting themselves out out of you this is what God has called us to if these things be in you and abound they got to stay there because the trials will come to test to see if they're there or not right if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins a man wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure but if you do these things a man you shall never fall I want to go back to First Samuel chapter 30 and read from there and I forgot to also just mention we we will be doing a meeting our selves and in February it would be February the the weekend of Valentine's Day we got brother Aaron McGarry coming and also brother Danny steamin a man have you coming to preach for us a man during those meetings so just want to let everybody know and I mean I'm going to just ask last year we did those meetings and and most people didn't realize that there was a tremendous expense behind it almost about $5,000 that that was paid you know just to make those meetings happening and I didn't share with anybody I just kind of took on the load and and just did it but you know I wanna I was told make sure to let the church know these things because people might want to help give and say make sure you let people know well enough in advance right so I say okay we'll do that you know so I'm starting to announce it and just let everybody know and if you want to give towards that I anticipate that our expenses for you know the me that's gonna be anywhere from five to seven thousand dollars you know this is what takes care of people flying here coming here their hotel rooms food and you know and all these things like that so you know but if you would like to contribute towards that just take one of the envelopes and just write for the meetings you know own it and we'll put it to the side strictly for the meetings but uh you know if we all kind of share it the load you got 25 people give $200 you got $5,000 just like that 25 people $200 $5,000 there's all the team a man and I'm trying to catch up with folk Christmas Thanksgiving it should I know you're gonna celebrate no no what no Halloween but praise the Lord but I'm catching before they get you right a man we got a meetin coming home a man and we had a time I was that I happen to go back on a little little thread and blast our brother Simba I hear dancing like we had a meet yeah I know who I am so you know we enjoyed ourselves early this year we're looking forward to it next year and we'll be doing the banquet and everything - we'll let you know about that as well soon enough here at First Samuel 30 it says and it came to pass when David and his man would come to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites said it had invaded the south and Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captors that were there in when they slew not any so sometimes we need to even though you're going through a great trial it could have been worse than what it was so we got to learn to thank God for for where we act a look at your neighbor say it could have been worse it could have been much worse so you need to just thank God for what you got you understand they say a man had taken the women captors that were there in they slew not any I had the great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice of weapon till they had no more power to weep then asked them crying that's some serious crying I mean I ain't mean got stripped to crime no more and this is a whole group of them and we're gonna read a little bit later on it's 600 men crying like this 600 can you imagine that being a rock men amongst six under crying man that would be some sight to see but not a cry for a reason right there all their families are gone why is going children go and have no idea where they are no whatsoever right so here you know said David Davis two wives were taken captive ahead of him the Jezreel itis and Abigail the wife of Nepal the carmelite when David was greatly distressed for the people speak of stoning him I think that's something now when things going good we went to David we got your back we got you covered but as soon as the tide turns man we gonna kill you I mean it just that's the way that's the way human nature is soon as something go wrong I'm coming against him right don't don't don't don't don't don't be like that don't be like that says David was greatly distressed about a man already lost his wives and everything that he that you know that that that was taken captive David lost all that now he losing the men that are there with him he losing their confidence right and he says David David was greatly distressed for the people speak of stolen him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters now I want you to I want you to see David in this distressful situation had nobody else to turn to but God he couldn't get instant he could get encouragement from his best friends he couldn't get encouragement from relatives amen the day was even taught by stone in the morning all right but but here the Bible says but encouraged himself oh come on somebody I love this one right because sometimes foking on be there to encourage you you gotta have to learn how to pinch back your old self on your back and say go ahead you got to have what we call they used to say like there's something on the inside telling me to go head right amen eight man you got to have it you got the habit Lord I don't know I know you got purpose for everything I'm going through i'ma just keep pressing on me I don't just keep doing what you called me to do hey man don't don't be thought about talk about throwing in the towel because the time the trial got hard come on oh no no no no no no I tried to prepare you for your trial told you it was coming come on I don't throw no towel now glory to God get ready to just praise God in the midst of it hey man let's say David encouraged himself I was just waiting on you to say something nothing past I was waiting on a call least you can text me Pastor David encouraged that that means you can't sit there and pittypat with oppression you came to sit and have conversations with depression can I tell you something else stop studying websites signs of people that have depression because as you study the website you say I got that I and you don't smoke get over yourself you done brought depression right into your house who rather say a bunch of depression I might you oppression I got victory you start speaking like that you know what you're gonna do encourage yourself in the Lord David said to a be a the the priests a him elect survive pray the bringing me hither the ephod and a be atha brought theater the II Father David now you know what he's doing notice his how this is his family's gone his men have turned on him they're there in the camp that are six hundred men against one man talk about we gonna kill you we got you know you know I don't know what kind of leadership this is but we going we don't take you out raise up another leader right 600 million coming against him and he has to encourage himself and when David gets into dire straits watch what the Bible says that he does Bible says and David inquired at the Lord that mean he start praying about it this is how we fight our battles right I mean and sometimes that seem like that's like oh that's just the the canned response pray about it but if you read scripture this is how people came through things prayer is the most powerful weapon you got and let me tell you something when you're praying prayers not necessarily change the person that you're praying about prayers have changed you alright god help me David inquired at the Lord Stamp shall I pursue after this troop shall not overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and and will and and without fail recover oh let's go on to more verses so David went getting the six hundred men that were with him and came Brook bezoar were those that were left behind stayed and David but David pursued he in the 400 men for 200 a bowl behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook bezoar let's pray father we thank you for the reading of the word of the Lord as we would just embark upon this topic today of war strategies brotherly kindness God we trust that the Holy Spirit would take control of our thoughts and that you God would just get glory and honor from everything that would be shared we pray your blessings over the same slore that are again traveling this weekend and Lord that would be a way Lord just watch over and let them enjoy themselves oh god just a little family time and vacation time that you've given let them enjoy themselves board as our prayer and we thank you for us so I saw here too that this morning just trust what the Spirit of God would just be with us and got our precious sister called and told us that she wouldn't be here today because of some things that come up Laura she just wanted prayer over certain situations so that we offer her to you father now you know her name you know her situation or circumstance be with her got through the midst of it meet every meet that she would have what God is our prayers in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated a man my god so war strategies brotherly kindness a man let me just start by reading a little something here in the message living dying buried rising coming just something here that the Prophet says says and when he lived he loved because he was God and God is love and there can never be anyone who could love like Jesus loved a man from the very first time his little baby hand stroked those pretty cheeks of his beautiful mother he was loved from from that till he forgive his last enemy on the cross he was God's expression of love no one can love like Jesus God being manifested in a little tiny baby come in order to take away the sins of the world and when you just speak of the word Jesus something there's something about it means love that's what the world needs more today is not of Jesus of some past tense some Jesus of some high ethics but a Jesus of love that can be expressed in the Church of the Lord Jesus especially as its members one to another or to always greet one another in love I love that the members of the body of Christ should always greet one another in love a man a man don't walk by your brother don't want biases to greet one another in love he says in traveling I think if there's any great thing that I've seen missing in the church today - one of the greatest hindrance in the church today that keep a revival back is the of that godly love that Christ expressed when he was here on earth listen it's easy for you and I to love somebody that loves us glory to God but Jesus didn't have that kind of love this is what he was talking about in Matthew 5 when you said be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect amen they say they say the publicans can love those that love them say that you not doing anything different than anybody else so but it said when you can love your enemy someone that despitefully uses you or does something against you when you can love them now you've accomplished something praise God it made sense Jesus didn't have that kind of love he had God's love and God loved his enemies for God so loved the world when the world was unlovable God still loved the world now we need to understand we were included in the world a man said but he loved us that he would come and die on a cross for us before we was even born a man that's love amen an inept out here even at the cross Jesus is praying for those that are crucifying father forgive them for they know not what they do we got to come to this type of love hallelujah this is what God is calling for a man here the color for out of his bride he said it's it's a different even in the expression the worse the phileo love like we have one for another but the agapo love is the is a divine love but and if there's anything that I believe that would start a revival in Los Angeles would be time that we could all break down our different barriers we heard that this weekend break down our different barriers and come together as Christians and love that's the Pentecostals the Baptist and the Presbyterians and all together we could be expressed to the world that we love one for another he goes on to say this Jesus prayed that prayer that we might love one another as he loved us and as he loved us and he loved us so much that he died for us no one could love like that unless with the natural love because it would not hold out it won't express itself it'll do as long as there's friendship connected with it see that's that's that's that's sad you know we only love as long as there's a friendship connected to it right but as soon as that friendship is broken we stop loving a man if God only loved us when we were serving him think about a man if anybody's ever backslidden it and and and I can tell you this that all of us have backslidden in some way right but if God only loved us at the time that we were serving him and when we and when we got away from doing the things that we should've did if people stopped loving us we'd be without hope right now praise God I'm glad his love does not run out a man his thought his love has no end to it glory a man say says it says I do as long as their friendship connected with it but when the friendship turns then people begin to say well he did so-and-so she did storm so they Baxley real godly love goes after the that backslider till it finds him can I say that again real godly love goes after that backslider till it finds him hey man I heard a fortune of service on Wednesday night and I heard brother Troy Axl you know this one ain't here that wouldn't hear who was going after them real godly love is gonna go wear out them till it finds them any man don't just go after the ones that you connect with go after the ones that you don't connect with we don't have that we don't have nothing to come and guess you do you got Jesus in common so talk about Jesus glory to God says he says they've actually real godly love goes out to that backslide until it finds him godly love goes him Stoops to the Lords of hell to pick up a man or woman that's fallen that's what we're lacking today we have a fine cultured church educated fine dress fine building nice choirs beautiful music some of the best the world's ever had but we're dying for some of that godly love dying for some of that godly love amen let's go on hear the message statue of a perfect man the Prophet gives us something here a man as he's bringing in brotherly kindness it just makes just a couple comments and we'll just read this and we'll go on since this he says then sickly let's at the Bible said here adding brotherly love brotherly kindness now that's a good one it says right here the six seven all right add and brotherly kindness all right when we give to that brotherly kindness he says put yourself in his place on the matter now this is real good right cuz cuz you know sometimes we when we process things we're processing it only from our perspective but but he's saying well yet when you when you're adding brotherly kindness what you do is you shift positions and you begin to put yourself in your brothers position or in your sisters position hallelujah Amen and you begin to see things the way that they see things the reason that they respond the way that they respond you can understand that because you're seeing it from their angle Oh hallelujah church right amen oftentimes before you make a decision if you were just ship since it were actually keep some of the the stew room and the fusses and the argument a man down if we could just kind of think about it from another person's perspective Oh hallelujah church glory to God he said he says put yourself in his place on the matter they said my brother sinned against me and Peter said shall I forgive him he said seven times a day he said seven seventy times seven see brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him see no no see be kind to him go anyhow now you know we're gonna read this I will go back to Matthew 18 and pull this up but just you know if a brother gets out of tune because that happens in church people get out of tune sometimes the devil throw something at a person the devil throw a misunderstanding in and next thing you know a person's out of tune now-now-now i'ma tell you if you ever played an instrument that was out of tune it don't sound good it mess up everything else right if you don't get it into I mean it's gonna cost a single the sing sing wrong it's gonna cost a mint I mean what other people are hearing is like oh my that's just this is a mess right so when things get out of tune to get real ugly hallelujah but when it get that way you gotta learn how to be patient what happens with an instrument is we take we take something we just begin to tune it back up now you can't play it till it get back into you can't use it till they get back in tune hallelujah but but what we're working on is trying to get it back into Oh glory to God now now the Prophet is telling us here amen if a brother's out of tune don't be impatient don't be impatient Lord and I would say number the truth I love the time enough of how God just kind of does these things and and and just just I mean I I know God is moving this that's all I know God is moving because don't don't get impatient things happen amen for a reason sometimes when it's happening it's to try you right it's just to see what's on the inside of you glory to God I know what I'm talking about amen it's a god of God God allows that thing to come to your life how you gonna respond to this how you gonna react to this amen we got we got our attention focused on on the other person but God was excellent but God is used to trying might fulfill God is using for you Oh God if we can understand that Oh hallelujah if we can just get that if we can get that concept that God this is this is this is working together for my good not for their good but for my good look at this and you know here the scripture says if you know brother Branham is quoting this in Matthew 18 we're gonna read this verse 15 he's quoting the scripture and he's standing up when you when you're dealing with brotherly kindness he uses the example of Peter coming and asked him you know if my brother if my brother fitted me if he offend me how often should I forgive them you know and what we ought to get out of this is that you are going to be offended by your brothers no I don't know if we got that yet you you got to stop going around talk about I can't believe they did this oh oh you had them on such a high pedestal you had them on such a high pedestal that when they fail you now you don't know what to do I'm the problem Isis that they weren't supposed to be on that pedestal God was supposed to be there so God actually allows people to fail you so you can take your face out of people and put your faith in God hallelujah Amen listen I mean you know even if even in Jesus ministry it seemed like Jesus film history felt his congregation when Lazarus died Jesus could have went before Lazarus died and actually prevented it and not only Kaji's us to it the congregation knew that had Jesus come he would have prevented have you been here my brother would not have died they had that much confidence they said time and time again for Jesus to come Jesus delayed himself I believe for four days the latest is it's going to see proper situation and by this time the Bible say you know they said you'd say roll away the stone say Lord he's stinketh can I put it this way by the time you get it pastor this thing will be so bad it's taketh ain't nothing we can do with it by the time you get here maybe your faces are the wrong people whether you got faith in the Lord Jesus Christ he can change it and any time he walked he can resurrect any damn situation Jesus did do that but you gotta wait on oh man this car engagement like man what kind of pastors this he could have he could've did somebody but he waited all this time because he knew what he was gonna do once he got there and prayed for Lazarus called him out of the grave he knew exactly what was going to happen but but you know sometimes they may see my other people fairly that's because God wants you to have here your faith and your your trust in him alone IFS God that's gonna fix anything you're going through look at this you say if my brother offend me if my brother finish so that means you're gonna be offended by your brother and can I be honest with you then I'm gonna be the hardest trials you have when it comes from within it's the hardest trial you can have a man I mean David David made that the statement he says you know if it was my enemy that did this oh I could have borne that he said but you my brother you did this something that hurt that hurt I've never expected that that come from you how hallelujah but when it happens you got to deal with it amen and what God is doing this accent he's actually bringing out some character it's being folded you when it does occur think it not strange to fire trials that come your direction look at this now he's he's acting the question sake should I just forgive him seven times and I mean Peter realized that my brother didn't offend me and he might do the same thing he might do the same thing over and over again but but when he does it seven times good enough right Jesus oh my god I don't know if we get that I mean I don't I went through this last week I went through this the week before how many times I gotta forgive this and see when we get to the end of this story cuz they say seventy times seven when we get to the end of that that means unlimited forgiveness you you can't count it you can't count 490 times okay what you doing like write it down and a log you know okay that was your all you doing this you killing yourself with an approach like that let go and let God oh Jesus let's read this Matthew 18 says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established now let me let me help you understand if you are the one or two more that's going into a situation you're there just to listen y'all and get it you know just to listen it ain't your problem is their problem and it's up to them to work it out huh it's not your so you're not gonna fix it you never listen and it's just being a witness to it that's pretty much all it is and maybe there's a portion of it where you might be able to inject just a little bit hallelujah but don't try to take over the conversation it's not so conversation all right well I think no I didn't bring you here for that all right all right let me go but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established Oh hallelujah and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if we neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican this is a person that won't be corrected there'll be a heathen or a public or not dis corrected but they won't they won't stand there and you know try to sort things out as brothers and sisters should be able to sort things out a man if there's anybody should be able to slow down a brother and sister in Christ should talk about it and let it go hey man you shot you should be hugging each other by now praise the Lord you should have been out to dinner by now hey man praise God all right all right all right glory to God a man going home how about I just feel that when they get what you don't get how you gonna get rid of that what you're gonna do to get rid of that are you just gonna keep glorifying it they return me why I just feel something and then maybe it's not every time they walk by it's because you ain't got rid of what's inside of you all right all right look at it it says there less any whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven it says again I've said to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am in the midst of them then came Peter to him that said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me oh I just I love Peters question because I want you to understand that your brother will sin against you your sister will sin against you he said how shall my brother sin against me and I forgive them till seven times he had his own answer Jesus blew his hands out the water Jesus saving him I say not unto thee until seven times but into seventy times seven now you know he's going on because brother countless wondered like brother Branham said one of the hardest things that he finds the greatest hindrance in the church the thing that's keeping revival back is that the godly love that we need to be able to express one to another you know as you go on and read the rest of this passage in Matthew 18 its Jesus also gives a parable about a man that you know he owed I believe was ten thousand talents or something like that he oh he oh he and let me just put it in today's terms he owed a million dollars so the King here heard him say I just don't have it and you know I can't pay my dad I just came doing I'm so sorry and and not only did the King forgive him you know the king the King action for him you don't have to pay the million dollars amen not just not just it's a the forgiveness went not just because you couldn't pay but I'm also forgiving you where you don't even have to pay a million dollars the man is released of a debt of 1 million dollars I'm striking it off my books I'm not holding it against you a million dollars it's gone just like that and the man leaves this event with the king runs into a man that owes him $10 the probable cause of the pimps amen the man owes him $10 and when he runs into this man this man says you're not gonna give him my money grab him by the neck committed to the police officers say take him to jail because he can't pay me $10 and as soon as they put him in jail amen oh you know think that the King heard that this man did they say bring him back up him bring him back into my coat I like my checks but gave you 1 million dollars and you were adjusting with you were forgiving but when it was time for you to forgive somebody else you couldn't even forgive him $10 worth he said ma'am don't commit you to prison see this isn't that the key to this is that forgiveness releases the prisoner only to realize you were the prisoner so when you forgive you release yourself Oh God when you forgive you release yourself otherwise you stay bound to something for years and not even realize that it is it hurts your health it's us all I mean does a lot of other stuff to you that just not even SI you a little bit short life because you can forgive and I'm talked about when your brother does it can I go further when your spouse does it and you gotta sit in Laura Laura I forgive God god help me forgive see this is it I'm tell you something it's why we need prayer meeting that's why we need it because you got a brace of things before the lawyer I can't do this I need you praise the Lord I'm gonna tell you what God is calling for out of us is not easy these ain't easy things to do but nonetheless if we're gonna reach perfection this is what this is what it takes let's go and read the next next part of this quote out of statue of a perfect man Oh my problems that somebody said not long ago said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the semblance of God and the one that's all the rest then and then put seats he says all the rest in but see brotherly kindness T hoping someday see patient with him see tempering and doing with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring them in I love the way that the Prophet just kind of approaches this because you know brother Countess we have to be able to go after our brothers and meekness and sweetness and and all that we can't go after you know you'll never get anywhere with anybody if you're going with an argumentative spirit it's just not going all that does is bring more offenses and until you can keep your spirit down just don't say that maybe that's what God trying to get you to do maybe maybe God was allowing that to kind of temper your spirit and when you get to spiritual spot where I'm not fussing I'm not fighting I'm not arguing it's hard to argue with a dead person you understand we got a diet ourselves diet our feelings that I thought started Dinah all of that God what are you bringing out of me hallelujah church you know I've just you know some of these things as Christians we act different from the world we we we approach situations different than the way the world would approach right oftentimes we try to take you know a psychological approach and not only that we live in a world where people tell us that you know you deserve better you know you don't have to accept this this is what this is what people tell us if you're in a what we call a toxic work environment you don't have to stay here you can just quit and leave but but but where is the character of Christ being full let me ask the question where do you want it to be for what I'm trying to get you see some of us God is using our households to to develop our character others God is using our jobs to develop our character which where do you want God to choose I mean where you want him to put you in order for you to get character development hallelujah somebody you can't pick and choose your trials God and His divine wisdom gives you what he knows not what he thinks God gives you where he knows that you can handle can I tell you something right now you ain't going through nothing that surprised God when it pertains to you you ain't going through nothing they went one that got like oh they gonna be able to handle this God that there's nothing shotgun don't know you can handle it that's why I allow you to go through what we got to learn how to do start thinking god what a trial that he allows to come into our life and and and meekness and sweetness and kindness just approach the situation you have the pray body and keep going and those who that got jobs where you call it a toxic work environment they didn't use words like that years ago now that's a new word that's a new word can I tell you all something every every work environment it's toxic every one of you want to know why because all of them got unsafe people in them I go a little further I've been in church work environments and they toxic you working in a church you didn't expect this in the church but it's toxic because it got unsafe people in it praise the Lord amen don't run from your child run to it lord I thank you for it alright let me let me let me let me let me go a little further I wanna I won't be able to read all of this but this was just something that blessed my heart my let me see here this I want to just go to blasphemous names and start here this is about sister Sheppard a man sister Sheppard had a dream and she was just wondering whether she had the Holy Ghost or not and she was just so concerned about whether she had it or not and she had this dream and and completely forgot about the dream until brother Brandon beginning to preach on statute of a perfect man and as he was preaching such a perfect man the Lord brought the dream back to attention and then she took him she just began to share you know this dream with the Prophet and and and she was just wondering whether she had the Holy Ghost tonight I'm gonna I'm gonna go right to paragraph 98 and blasphemous names a man I'm gonna skip around a little bit for the sake of time but I think it would be a blessing to us says now our sisters dream now she was worried whether she had the Holy Ghost or not when she laid down across the dual fold where her husband was reading a paper and she has got a little once as I have and they're always making a noise and things so so in this she fell asleep for approximately 10 minutes or 15 and she dreamed and she never could understand it or get it all together from a year ago almost until this message was taught then while I was teaching it it all come back to her as and she dreamed that she was praying she was walking the floor first before she dreamed and wringing her hands and things and thinking lord have I got the Holy Ghost can you prove to me some says because that I shouted or some said because I spoke with tongues and we believe in all that but have I really got it a man says I believe in all those things those virtues speaking in tongues and shouted in all kinds of demonstration I believe in every bit of it but if it's there without this he's talking about the character of Christ if it's there without this there is something wrong see now you see you got a shell he says if she was worried about it so she just laid down across the dual for where her husband was reading and she went to sleep and this is her dream it's a dream she was up on a mountain and in this mountain the best sense I haven't got the paper before me but I think it's like this now not not not understanding this she told brother Brandon a dream he didn't you know he didn't have have it written out but he's kind of going back from his memory and sharing the dream now there's two things I want to bring out he's doing one from his memory but another because God actually showed him the interpretation of the dream and by shown in the interpretation he said if God gonna show you the interpretation you have to see the dream first oh my god right when you when when when I wonder I can't well what would get down to it here in a second he said you say say you gotta see you gotta be able to see the dream first let me also tell you this somebody Amen if God has given somebody that gift of dreams in the church I believe me also give somebody else the gift of interpretation praise the Lord now with every dream there might not come an interpretation Amen so don't force yourself to try to make up an interpretation hallelujah but all the times when you say Amen just keep things inside the dream something pops in that interpreters mind you hear a little bit of say a script to me pop Amen you might be saying this is saying that you're not thinking but a spliff to me pop it there another scripture pop and you can start seeing how all the dots are connected God is giving the interpretation of that dream God is showing it to the person as you're telling it to them God is showing them what you're seeing that's how gifts work but see if nothing's knows no scripture comes connected nothing here connected nothing come I mean looking out now if this is God it should be connected back to the scripture come on church I said if it's God it should be connecting back to the script but you can't see I know Scripture is connecting to it something wrong somewhere sometime the devil will work with dreams too and you got to be able to kind of recognize if this God is the devil I got to be able to see the word and a person that that that that might have the gift of interpreting if you really got the gift you know you can't interpret every dream because every dream didn't come from God so ain't no system I wrote it down I got another one for you I got another one for no no no no I hate what this gonna be like how every dream didn't come from God so the dreamer got to know that too Oh God a person s gifted with dreaming will dream every night just about their dream every night that no I'm not gifted that way I sleep every night right amen it's so wait God gave me a dream because I'm like that when God gave me a dream I know something is happening Oh God I know God is moving when God give it to me like that then I'll say something to somebody like I made a statement amen I don't know if I might've told the church early I saw a certain sister walking back into the church years ago I saw it happen then when it manifests I say oh that's my dream being manifested but I didn't go tell everybody I just told my wife I told my wife and I think I told I might have told maybe one or two other people something right before happened and then when it wouldn't happen there it was manifested praise the Lord hallelujah but a real dreamer might have a dream every night because that's just how their conscience is but every dream is not of God can I tell you another thing sometimes you just gotta wait on an interpretation oh lord have mercy how long did sister Sheppard wait a year a whole year and you just weren't yourself to death god I don't know what this mean no you just wait on God he'll bring in the past here so you wanted me if it if it's gotta mean it he'll show it to you all right I'm a move on Oh Lord Jesus so he area I want to go further in this says she dreamed she was up on a mountain and in this mountain I haven't gotten to people before me I think it's it's like this she dreamed that she saw a Rock box like a framework setting right on top of this mountain man now notice her dream say she said it was sitting on top of the mountain The Rock box the dream came back to her as brother branham was preaching statute of perfect man so what was the top of the mountain love charity right that was a top pyramid Mountain it was love hallelujah as he was teaching statue of a perfect man the dream came back to her oh my god so hearing the dream she said she's seen a rock box now I'm gonna just get ahead of myself brother branham said that Rock box a rock represented a confession represented a revelation that they would step that that we've been centered he said throughout the church changes he says this page has been there's been more require of this age than any age hallelujah Amen all they had maybe in Paul's day was faith then they come up to virtue didn't come to knowledge then they come to temperance then patience college bully comes and he says that is the virtue for our day brotherly kindness is a virtue but as we as we've come to the revelation of all these things then this requirement is for the Christians today add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge add to your first time in your knowledge temperance patience godless brother cuts and be capped off with the love of God this is the full requirement for Christianity today she say she starts at the top of the pyramid say he just it's just a rock box it's a confession it's a revelation it's an understanding that's coming from God look at this he says haven't got the brain center I saw Rock box like a framework standing right in the top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her and if she was assumes oh and she she was a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up building the most pure water that she ever seen and pouring into this box by the man is pouring water into the box hallelujah rock-pop setting on top of the mountain and the rock parks would not hold the water it rolled right out of there and just boiled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there amen and bored it out and roll down the mountain and a rolled up my feet if she was just standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her I got to just just bear with me here for a little bit this water is the water of the word washing out all the trash in my life right and I notice now here she's standing in the midst of it and can I put it this way you standing in the midst of some some trashy situations you standing in the midst of some really difficult trials you stand in the midst of somebody her to this win her to that way hallelujah but but he say if they won't stick to you it won't stick to you they may you won't carry that you won't carry that burden with you amen everywhere you go you won't carry that it won't speak to you it won't change your Christian experience hallelujah I've known a who wrote but it won't stick to you you'll still have brotherly kindness for your brother and for your sister it won't stick to you it's not supposed to stick to you if it's pure water the water of the word washing it it's not supposed to stick to you look at this he goes home says in when she acts while the Box didn't hold that the man said that is not water that's the Holy Ghost that nothing will hold it says and said then he went back he got another big bucket it was full of honey and poured the honey into the air and it said now it will hold this and she thought that the box was a rock box but was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it the honey inhale now not a burr what brother brems say the honey represent it was the brotherly kindness if you want that to stick oh yes hallelujah you want you want your brotherly kindness amen to be effective in somebody else's life amen you want that to stick you don't want the trash to stick but you want the character to stick she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain look back she saw five streams of his of this pure crystal water not contaminated by the things that I that it went through still pure and clear coming swiftly then it slowed up then almost faint announced she was wondering if it would ever reach the bottom of the mountain five streams and she woke up I think that's just about that's about close to being right isn't it sister Sheppard so you know he's going on and talking about how you know they she had this dream soon she told him the dream that the interpretation came and it said just like Daniel Daniel had to tell King Nebuchadnezzar what his dream was so so a person that has the gift of interpreting a dream God will show it to them they will see exactly what you saw and be able to tell you all about it hallelujah if God don't show it to you then just wait on the Lord now he goes on and he makes some comments here I want it I just want to kind of bring a man bring this in oh I'm going down to paragraph 1 well actually I read just read a part of 114 then I'm gonna skip to 119 it says now here's the interpretation of her dream he says she was bothered about the Holy Spirit now in so much that she's seen the box on top of the mountain was the rock rock box is a rock confession now like Jesus said in Scripture he said Peter said who Jesus said who do men say I decided mantasy now look he took her Rock box and tidy right back to the scripture I hope y'all seen it amen when she said I was a rock box on top of the mountain water pouring through water of the Word of God right saysay he said but the rock box it was a confession that she was that he said say just like Jesus told Peter who do men say I am Peter said thou art the Christ Peter had a conception a rock that he was standing on a revelation of who Christ was so so sometimes God uses things in the dream to symbolize other things it's got to tie back to scripture it goes only brings us to say that's all it was it says it's a rock confession I like Jesus say the scripture said Peter who to Jesus say who does men say out of southern man once said I realize the Moses and so forth it said but who do you say I am he said thou art the Christ the Son of God so he's standing on this rock of Revelation a man of who Christ is I want to skip down to paragraph 1 night 2 he's tying a man her rock box can fix portion of her dream into the confession into a revelation this is what Peter had oh man not just what Peter had but it's a revelation of stuff that the church has got to have today look at this in 1:19 he says and that's been each church age has had that rock confession owned up to this rock confession of the Laodicean hallelujah he says and now you cannot make a holy church there is no such a thing as a holy church or a holy organization the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad renegades indifference and everything I hope y'all catch that you you can hear certain things priest the Holy Ghost can be preached the message can be preached people can jump up and say Amen and were you watching them say Amen and glorifying God you think for sure they live in some kind of life and then you find that they not living the life that you thought they were sleeping it's your faith gonna be shaking at that time are you gonna keep pressing on because in the midst of this church you can have good bad Renegades indifferent and everything else who you got your eyes on I got my eyes on Christ I wanna I wanna I gotta read something say so an organization when I hold it you can't say we got it none of the rest of them have it no sir the Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals st individual now i want to slip back now till war strategy would come back amen to this in a little bit but i want to go back because as he's bringing out this that they know the the the the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good bad and renegades as we were looking at first samuel 30 story is david was supposed to be fighting for the philistines and you know and as he was you know my this is the pre anointed king just trying to get this in your mind this is this man's the pre anointed king he is joined up with the enemy and he's on his way out to battle and and with the Philistines and Phyllis times column and I said you know what we're actually going to battle against Israel st. that's something here here David is illness he's joined forces with the philosophic assault has put him on the run and he's he's Derek joining forces with the Philistines and he's going to have to go against his own brothers now he's prepared for this war a man the Philistine leaders want to check out all the soldiers and here comes David in his six hundred men and here the Phyllis town leaders I mean they look and they say now who would this is David this is the one that saw latest thousands and and David's latest in town this is one they wrote that song about right you say so yeah that's him he said now we can't take him to battle send him back to where he come from because he might turn on us in the battle they said no we don't we can't we can't trust him take him because we're going to actually fight against his people they turned David back around and and David you know puts up this front you know he's not even David no he was happy to go back he don't even wanna he couldn't kill Saul in a case he could kill him in the inner you know in a manner in a valley he cannot touch so had he been with the Philistines have had to do this he would have problems they knew that he can not touch God's anointed but David had to put him on the front so what do we do wrong why y'all sitting us back what we got to go through this so look you know you ain't done wrong to me but the Fela style leaders just don't want you in your man so in the morning y'all please leave all right we're leaving and as they go back from Z I'm in a thick lag here they find a man that uh they they get back and you know they can't go to battle they upset that they can't go to battle and and then when they get back they find that they're their families have been taken the the camp had been raided everybody gone wives gone children gone animals go they I mean it was a very hopeless situation when they come into this and and when they get there you know David already discouraged that all of his families go I mean his wives didn't I mean on it he's already discouraged but but then the man began to cry because they lost everything and their final thing is that you know what David you've led us this far you led us into a trap amen our families are gone and and say this is the best you can do as a leader we're we think we ought to kill you 600 man I'm coming against David and this is why the Bible say he had nobody else to turn to i'ma tell you you might be in a trial that you have nobody that you can turn to but you can be recessed like David encouraged yourself in the Lord do may have to read the Bible do have to listen to some tapes you may have to do something to encourage yourself I was listening I heard the prophets say this one word from the prophet one word from another service will encourage you sometimes one word from the scripture will encourage you some time but you got to learn how to encourage yourself David had nobody to lean on nobody probably say he encouraged himself and didn't then what it there but David does he see goes and he he gets the the ephod and he begins to pray and begins to seek God and and I'm gonna tell you want to come out of your trial seeker hunt learn how to pray and I read this quote for you you know some time ago I won't read of the day but he said what make a Christian lazy it's when they are on a flowery bed of ease can I tell you see when everything going good for you this going good that's going cuz that's go yeah this thing oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah God let a trial come to shake your life up a little bit you know you forgot that she was praying before everything was going good dude you was a Jew was used faithful to God and everything before everything was going good and through your faithfulness he bless you huh now now nada he's bless you you don't changed everything hallelujah go back do your first works over David David takes his 600 minute got encourage something nothing as he can say then who just seeks the Lord in prayer and the Lord say no I mean I love the way God responds say now you go you go pursue him and without fail you don't get everything back you're gonna recover all so here David tells us man knock knock knock now I can imagine these fellows they're already upset go good to go do what follow you into battle we just got kicked out of one battle we couldn't go there now family's gone now you want us to follow you again David I sought the Lord the Lord told us to go and we're gonna get everything back God is a good God and their journey to go get everything this is where we read a man and I read how six hundred men went went and they got to this Brook bezoar and when they got to bezoar 200 of the 600 men decided that they couldn't go any further they were faint and they they they said you know we just we just can't going to further this is this is this is it for us they were weak please just let us stay right here will you know I'm sorry we just can't go no further so the other for under state let's go on without them and they went on I said it's good as bad as renegades it's good as bad as renegades this indifferent everything is in there and David's army he had good he had that he had renegades he had been different he had all this in his arm here everybody's already already going through a trial Oh God's telling me just I don't want to get ahead of myself everybody David going through trial the army gone through everybody in this church everybody in Davis Church is going through a trial everybody's suffering some of the same things everybody's lost their family everybody's lost their wives everybody's lost their children hallelujah I just want to say this you know sometimes God allowed you to go through a wayward child situation so you can be a little bit more sensitive just somebody else this got away with child hallelujah sometimes sometimes God let your money get tight so you're gonna be a little bit more sensitive with somebody else money get tight huh oh come on somebody sometime God allow you to go through certain things in your marriage so you can be a little bit more sensitive somebody else that might be going through oh god no how to use our trials here everybody going through this and they get there say we can't go no further so David decides we're gonna go on the look we're gonna go on and try weak God say we're gonna recover all now what God does it's allowed David to run into a little man that had been kicked to the side right by the invading army they they the man got sick and they thought that this man weren't gonna make it so they just kind of pushed them to the side and say forget about him he'll die right there in that spot be careful who you kick to the side God know how to use what you don't kick to the side hallelujah you might be a person that's been kicked to the side but God will strengthen you and use you for his glory here here it is this pistol soldier had been kicked to the side been left to die and David they brought pigs to the man he began to eat the figs and he got strengthened and they just sent their nurse them back to health to me getting to spot where he could talk about what had just happened say you know I was a part of an army and we went down and we invaded Ziklag you did what hallelujah and then a good thing man they held their peace they they they make they kept their cool because you did what I mean maybe one who doesn't say where my wife where my children where my dancing and if you don't tell me I'm gonna take your hand off but they had to hold air - David I'm saying I'm not stay back boys he don't let us sit on a secret they went the Ziklag indeed what say we're disarmed yet say uh I said what you want to know where them people that they carried away was my people and we want to know what that army had otherwise you're gonna have to suffer for the army but sir if you promise not to kill me by taking you down into the army I'll take you with it yet here this man was used by God to take David and 400 men into the camp of the enemy they surprised hallelujah and when they say say they think they think it was a great slaughter I think only 400 million got away but all of their families their wives their children everybody was spared their animals everything was there they recovered all but where's the friendly comments coming in that because they killed all the enemy they killed on the enemy let's pick this up in script I'll show you what a brother comes comes in there what a brotherly kindness come in that list let's read verse 18 first samuel 30 but David recovered all that the Amalekites that carried away and David rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spore nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered oh I liked I liked that God don't want to just give you part of it back he wants to give it all the teeth and David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle and said this is David spoil and David came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow David whom they had made also to abide at the brook bezoar and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him and when David came near to the people he saluted them see how you responding to folk when they done took you through a trial this is says he says then answered all the wicked then answered all the wicked men and the men of Belial see I said it's indifferent right it's renegades as good as bad it's everything else and this in this church of 600 David had everything going to church oh my mind the men of Belial were going to church oh I hope you're a kid right now you got you gotta watch who you got y'all put your eyes on Jesus the man of Belial also in this group you know what a man of allow this is a worthless man you don't want nobody to card you you Manipal I'll that's not a good that's not a good turn all right listen says made up allow of those that Wentworth dated and say it because they went not with this not CCC he got a why - who's surrounding you it's somebody sometimes people don't come up with some evil schemes right and they got they want to suggest to you to do something evil now notice what they say say uh because they went not with us right they didn't go to the battle to recover all this since they went not with us we will not give them all of the spoil that we have recovered st. every man his wife and his children that they may leave them away in the park oh that's sad now we're not gonna give you all know spoil we're just gonna give you your wives and your children we don't even want y'all hanging with us no more pretty much we want to kick y'all out the church then said David you shall not do so thank God for a godly leader ye shall not do so my brother in with that and notice what David is saying with that which the LORD hath given us I didn't do this on my own I didn't go down and recover all on my own if God had not put that man there for me to talk to and feed and him show me where the camp was I would have been lost God set this up for me to get everything back see they meant when they come in and invade it and took everything God is the one that spare my family so I'm not gonna let y'all just do them like that David says you should not do so my brother in with that which the LORD hath given us who have preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our land for who will hearken unto you in this manner but as his part is that go down to the battle so shall his part be that tarath by the stuff they should part alike I i I just I just like this IIIi believe God is taking us into a new church I [Applause] believe that a new church a new scheme and no one nobody else I believe I believe y'all have been given from y'all heart and God gonna bless y'all giving you want to know what else I believe I believe it's gonna be people that's gonna come in to church affion gave all your money and it's gonna be some folk that's gonna be runnin around that new church that ain't gave a dollar you know what else I believe I believe you're gonna rejoice with you're not gonna be looking at them funny huh do not you not gonna meet what you ain't even gave nothing towards it you may don't think like that because you're gonna realize it's not us anyway it's Oh God [Applause] but as his part is that going down to the battle socialist Part B that tariff buy the stuff that shall part alike and it was so from that day forth that he made it a statute and ordinance for Israel to this day and when David came to Ziklag he's sent of the spoil and to the elders of Judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord the brotherly kindness is what David did to his brothers that could not go to battle put yourself in the other person's position they were faint they just didn't have the strength to go and rather than say now you don't good you know we're just gonna give you back your kids and your wife and we don't want y'all to be nothing we don't want nothing to do with you no no no no no we're gonna give you kids we're gonna give you your wife and and you know what we're gonna make ya'll more than conquerors I remember brother Darrell Ward said you know Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali's wife would be more than a conquer because you know what she what she would never step into the ring she'd never take a blow so you never get hit by nobody she never even trained didn't get up early in the morning to run do nothing but when Muhammad Ali go out there and knock a fella I you know what she enjoys the rewards of his victory she live in the house that he buys with the money she drives a Carter he buys with him and it makes her more than a conqueror and y'all didn't go to battle boys but y'all gonna get spoiled you gonna get to enjoy the things that we enjoy and we had the fight for it but because you're one of us because you our brother and I just wonder if you can use a strategy like that in order to overcome in some situations that you might be going through you put nothing in but you're gonna get everything out can you use that strategy for a brother for sister you know Jesus did when he went to the cross what did we put in I tell you what we put in I was seeing that's what we put in but yet we got everything out of the sacrifice of him going to the cross that's that's brother Candace that's brotherly kindness that's what he's calling us to I want to finish reading just a quota too I forgot to bring my my clock up here to tell me how long I've been preaching so y'all forgive me a manís you know and back and brothers brother branham's dead man used to put a little white mint in his mouth and one time the man forgot to put a Minion's now if you put a button and it never dissolved so he just kept preaching but y'all just bear with me here I just I just let me just drop a couple things in I want to go back to the quote about a statue of a perfect man I'm sorry blasphemous names I kind of cut off right in the middle of a quote and I just want to finish that up and then now I'll bring that to a close and then I just want to read one other thing for you says so therefore let me go back to is that the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad renegades indifferent and everything I'm in paragraph 120 Rena gates in different everything else so an organization will not hold you can't say we got it and none of the rest of them have it no sir the Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals it's the individual paragraph 1:21 so therefore the rock this latter-day Pentecostal church which has received the Holy Spirit they did at the first all down through the just they received the Holy Spirit but not see not in the measure that they have it now so what what what's required of us is much more than what was required in where much has been given much has been required we have more revelation than anybody else so God has required more life out of us right a man back in Luther's that he can still smoke pipes and be Christians not today you can't call yourself a Christian you smoking and drink and you can't call yourself a Christian you should even take communion if you're doing that amen it can't be it I'm a lord I'm a fifth actually to forgive me on Sunday morning but then I'm gonna go back on Monday and do the same thing God sees that amen listen he says not in a measure that they have it now because it's a restoration of the first as we take the candlesticks Alpha Omega how they lit the first candle it went high in high and got dimmer and dimmer then come back again see first and last and so forth and it goes on this it says now but in this church age the message is being poured into the church all these war strategies God given us different ways to overcome the enemy these you know this is the message be important to the church it's the washing of the water of the words amen the message be important to the church but the church body itself all together say this Tabernacle will say this that's where she comes to church this Tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost tabernacle there is no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the Church in the body and group therefore it runs out but that but what this man who was pouring out the water the message to the church poured the message into the church but what was the water doing what was the message doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it see it won't stick to you you might be standing in it but it won't stick to you it won't stick to you it's just getting getting out of your life boiling out of the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Spirit does boys it up now now the honey represented probably love brotherly kindness which is this age I've just got through telling see brotherly kindness the age that we live in now now I got a I got a skip okay I think that's it Oh hold on let me see here let me see yeah I got to keep reading I got to keep reading says now you might say look I sure don't like brother Neville seeing it just like I just read this story they didn't like them fellows for not going all the way in the battle with them they didn't like say I sure don't like brother Neville oh I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it just nearly killed you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feelings for one another but to see but to maintain and a group of people why do you care about why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with but because you kind of stay but which you aren't to do but shun him a little see when he does something the flesh that you disagree with you just shun them we all guilty of it we all guilty of it I'm guilty of it we Shawn man that hurt you shun right but we don't want to be that way we got this got to be a live voice Oh God has got to be expressed on the AI lived on the inside and expressed on the outside listen he said he says but shun in a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just merely kill you or that sister I'm an old man I was once young and now I'm oh I've seen it down through the age do that here people I just won't have no more to do with them Oh God if we could all just be honest we've all got to that spot we've just been so fed up that's all we want to stay Lord ain't gonna have no more to do with them I'm gonna have nothing no more to do with it looks that just won't have no more to do with them I don't skip that okay and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh god I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see you see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick because the honey it stinks our love will run out our emotions our feelings will run out but when we can get God's love into involved in a situation it's eternal brother branham was making a point here and I want to I want to read this a man this is my last quote the way to have fellowship I just felt this morning that I mean it to just kind of take time and just really read some of these things because I think it really just kind of set us free you know even when I think about the prophets ministry things that he preached Church challenged Christianity things that he did challenged christiana when he went to a man across to the border there and a man and he had those pecans in his trunk and drove for hours middle of the night to get to a hotel and as he crossed the border they say you got any pecans no I don't have any pecans then no got all the way to his hotel unpacking all of his luggage got to the bottom of the luggage and saw they were pecans in his trunk not out of all the things and out of all the times God's showing the Prophet showing people's addresses tell them where where they live what their names were all these things that God would show his prophet but he won't show him pecans get all the way to the hotel unpack the car pecans down he said I told that man I didn't have no pecans told his son get back in the car we got to go back to the border driver I was back to the border apologize to the man I tell you I didn't have no pecans I got pecans back from the border back to the hotel again ours that's a challenge to Christianity my Christianity I'm an honest that's a challenge to my Christianity I'm thinking to myself we'll deal with that in the morning and someone said we ain't gonna deal with it but but the Prophet brought things that really raise our level appreciated to to a place that God is expecting us to come to the canvas is not something that we just kind of toss out the winner and notice where to say brotherly kindness just come be have to be done those that's closest to you the example I gave me one what David did with the enemy is what David did with his brothers after war had been followed listen to this last quote the way to have fellowship no that's not the right cool hold on that's not the right one the the Great Commission the Great Commission this is where I want to be just listen to this from the Prophet says may I drop this little thing to your brother as I know your different denominations I think I've never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the nation it's becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got a shot shooting at one another he's got an open target anywhere he wants to shoot and what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another see see so he can just he can just sit back and relax I mean the devil not even fighting you you fighting each other and they're like yeah get him yeah yeah that was good yeah we fight each other on social media we send different posts and who you're talking to you Turner but they they know it's fun because they send something back and let me also say this I saw some folk final social media and then I see preachers fight in the pulpit so let's say something going on a church preacher bring it to the pulpit why the church a ticket of social media don't do that that's not it that's not in amen amen we got to be able to love one another cover each other's if you can alright listen did you ever let me just give you if I found grace in your sight through God you take my word for this brethren if you want to be a blessing and get the blessing when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil look at what the prophecy don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God amen our Father where prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother and he's just like he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see what he did it then let God know this is this is the other thing about and I think brother oh brother Layton told us when you pray sometimes you got to stop and then try to hear from God let God talk back to you you just finished talking to him now let him talk back to you just sit there quietly sitting there quietly and you're just hearing reports to God sweetly just begin to speak to you since they let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of God you'll be feeling very you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back when you get back down to earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with the mortar in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe so I don't believe no sir even if he's a rank Center and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he's wrong well if you if we will take him to the throne of God standing there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he's a mortal look at this powerful statement maybe his destination rests upon our attitude towards him eternity for this man rest on your attitude towards eternity for assistance rest on your attitude towards them eternity for your spouse rest on your attitude towards them when we come back from the throne of God we realize that we're very everyone guilty and we all need help one one from the other the best way to do is pray and I tell you I searched we all got things that we going through and prayers certainly the key sometimes there are certain things that you pray for privately not publicly amen praise the Lord people don't need to be in your business cuz folk do listen to your prayer that's why you just need to know how it what to pray what things are pray for publicly what things are pretty pray for privately amen you just got to learn how to pray but when you're praying for somebody maybe somebody's done you're certain when you just go you have to go to pray and when you pray let God talk to you because maybe God to show you why they did what they did and when you can put yourself in the other person's position on the matter then you can have brother kindness towards them then you can greet them and and really greet them with love hallelujah not because you know I know pastor watching me so I'm gonna make sure I greet you cuz I don't know no that ain't it let this day be real from the inside we got to be able to have brother chemist one to the other god help us is my prayer let's pray dear God we thank you Jesus for your word fit Lord as he just felt in his heart to bring to the church the message the statue of a perfect man and just going through each virtue Lord and Holy Spirit this allows us to pick that up father and just tie it back to maybe where that virtue might have been manifested in the Old Testament as a strategy of war God don't let these things just be words that kind of go in and out we got to apply this it's a great challenge great challenge to us as Christians God nevertheless will rise to the challenge you would not present these things to our ears Lord if you didn't expect for us to come to it and also know that we would come to it father we just appreciate the confidence that you have in us and we trust that we won't fail you that we will embrace every trial that we will embrace every distress that we were embraced every tribulation Oh God knowing that all things are working together for good because we love you and we're called according to your purpose Lord we've had banners lifted up we've had people lifted up we've had Lord just us too many things before you so god we want to put you back in the first place we want you to be amen at the forefront god of our life well weren't you getting all the glory and all the honor Lord shape us and mold us and make us into your very image it want us to be a mayor you you had sons like unto yourself God men and women that would carry your character that would carry your DNA in the earth God father we just trust Lord Jesus that we would represent those people that we wouldn't be a man of the indifferent and the bad and Lord just just everything else but we'll be the good that you've called us to be Oh God Lord I pray that you would help us Lord amen we need your help Oh God we can't do this on our own nothing we can do on our own but we need - god help us on our jobs help us in our homes help us in the church help us in school god help us father to show the very life of Jesus Christ God we need that it's in the name of Jesus that we pray amen amen praise the name of the Lord let's give the Lord a hand the phrase a man let's stand to our feet brother Solomon you can come and amen and close us out we can do the song I would be what you called me to be I will say yes Lord I agree praise the Lord amen say I will be what you've called me to be him I'll [Music] I agree my dessert here and suddenly years to be what you've come me to be that's what I will be oh that's what I will be come on sing with all your heart I will be what you call me to be Jesus say I will be [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] you

[Music] father you've called us from all walks of life that we may soldier together here in this land in this Laodicean age father God walking shoulder to shoulder hand in hand Lord in life's journey encouraging one another along the road sometimes while we do things to offend one another Lord Lord may we go to one another in the spirit of meekness Lord and always be mindful of our brother and realize that they never meant to hurt us father sometimes things just go wrong and sometimes we have bad days at sometimes Lord we getting a little pity party Satan begins to get the victory order sometimes we have to sing the songs of Zion and read your word and listen to your prophet or God sometimes we listen lower to the messages or that we've just heard our pastor preach or God and we get encouraged we come out of that battle sometimes we forget to go to our brother and sisters say I'm sorry for what I said I'm sorry for what I've done but when they come to us Lord God is already under the blood we've already forgiven them Lord but sometimes more we need to let them just repeat of what they done so that they're conscious is forever father just being here sometimes they don't know I've already forgiven love you I didn't hold it to your charge let's keep pressing about it moving forward in the Lord for the coming of the Lord is at hand there's no reason for me to hold a grudge Lord against my brother buddy keep pressing a bad word father I pray O God that the love of God may seem down he's one of our souls Lord father that you may have the preeminence isn't a small we want to be used by your Lord not just to help one other along the road Lord God but they help sinners see you Father it is written boy this will all men know that my disciples when you have love one for another I love my brothers and sisters and no doubt they love me Lord and we want to reflect this love at all times may we be a blessing to one another father as we prepare to leave this place may the
