[55:25] its own set of trials and tests and
[55:29] things of that nature that we all had to
[55:30] go through and often times when you're

[56:17] throughout the year and you know just
[56:18] just some of the mighty testimonies that
[56:20] we heard and it meant one of the ones
[56:22] that came to my mind is how God provided
[56:25] $10,000 right and when I think think

[56:32] our battle you don't know hottest thing

[56:59] promise right when when I saw the enemy
[57:02] coming in like a flood I also saw the
[57:04] Spirit of the Lord raised a standard
[57:06] against the enemy
[57:08] hallelujah sir my a man and when it
[57:11] seemed like the devil was attacking my
[57:13] finances I saw God rebuke to the
[57:15] firewalk for my sake
[57:18] and see when I'm going through all I can
[57:20] do just give him the Word of God
[57:22] and brother Adam say when the devil come
[57:26] back them walking with the word and

[1:06:19] Thessalonians chapter 4 a very familiar
[1:06:21] scripture verses 13 through 17 but I
[1:06:27] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:06:28] brethren concerning them which are
[1:06:29] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:06:31] others which have no hope for if we
[1:06:33] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:06:35] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:06:37] will God bring with him for this we say
[1:06:40] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:06:43] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:06:45] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:06:46] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:06:48] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:06:50] shout with a voice of the Archangel and
[1:06:52] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:06:54] Christ shall rise first and then we
[1:06:57] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:06:58] caught up together with them in the
[1:06:59] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:07:01] so shall we ever be with the Lord we
[1:07:05] just bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[1:07:07] Heavenly Father Lord we pray that you
[1:07:09] would let your word speak to our hearts
[1:07:11] that you would come and anoint me to
[1:07:13] speak and and to use your words Lord and
[1:07:16] to get myself out of the way Lord that's
[1:07:19] that's what your prophet taught that we
[1:07:21] ought to do Lord the kongregate Lord
[1:07:27] that we would all get out of the way
[1:07:29] that you could have your way in your
[1:07:31] will and it might be done in our lives
[1:07:33] as we we talked about in Sunday school
[1:07:35] how Balaam wanted to have it his way and
[1:07:37] even though you said no I want you to do
[1:07:40] it this way he came back and asked again
[1:07:41] as if your first word on the subject
[1:07:43] wasn't enough but father we want to say
[1:07:46] we're satisfied
[1:07:47] Jesus your first word on the subject
[1:07:49] Lord that satisfies Lord would to be
[1:07:53] honest we were humbled that you would
[1:07:56] even speak to us but you would even give
[1:07:59] us an answer Lord that you would even
[1:08:01] hear our prayer God is what a blessed
[1:08:04] people we are God you are everything you
[1:08:07] are the great way maker Lord we love you
[1:08:16] continue to be with us now Lord bless
[1:08:19] this service we ask it in the name of
[1:08:20] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:08:28] so this one on well I don't hear me all
[1:08:34] right Amen all right you may be seated
[1:08:39] so I guess well I haven't been here for
[1:08:43] three and a half years and brother Jack
[1:08:45] and I were discussing and I've been busy
[1:08:47] and he's been busy and you know it's a
[1:08:50] long drive to get down here and I could
[1:08:52] fly but my family likes to come and you
[1:08:56] know so it's it's good to be here some
[1:08:57] new faces since the last time I've been
[1:08:59] here brother Trevor Eamon is who I am
[1:09:01] most people refer to me as brother
[1:09:03] Trevor cuz they can't say nor spell
[1:09:05] Eamon so you can just forget that part
[1:09:07] and I'm brother Trevor you don't know
[1:09:08] any of the other any other brother
[1:09:09] Trevor's and the message probably so
[1:09:12] it's helpful to be unique sometimes so
[1:09:17] anyway that's who I am from
[1:09:18] Jeffersonville Indiana areas brother
[1:09:20] jacket said attended the Branham
[1:09:22] Tabernacle for close to 20 years and now
[1:09:24] with your friend and mine brother Nathan
[1:09:26] Bryant at his church Church the open
[1:09:28] door and bring you greetings from them
[1:09:30] and of course had a wonderful time of
[1:09:32] fellowship when so many of you all came
[1:09:34] and we we just had a time of worship and
[1:09:37] the Lord moved in a mighty way healings
[1:09:41] and different things so we thank God
[1:09:43] that he still Hebrews 13:8 he's still
[1:09:45] alive and well amen he still moves in
[1:09:48] his church and in his people and that's
[1:09:50] not just a platitude that's not just
[1:09:51] something we say but it's truth
[1:09:54] because it manifests amongst us you know
[1:09:58] cancer has been healed by my prayer how
[1:10:02] about yours you know and it's nothing
[1:10:06] about me but it's to say that God is
[1:10:09] still alive that he still moves and I'm
[1:10:11] it's so thankful you know I'm just
[1:10:15] thankful to be with family again
[1:10:16] you know you know we've just we've just
[1:10:21] been 17 years is a long time to be
[1:10:24] friends and I thank God every day for it
[1:10:26] you know sometimes brother Jack
[1:10:30] sometimes brother Jack has has the
[1:10:32] ability to push me from behind you know
[1:10:37] you know I'm kind of a you know sit back
[1:10:40] and calculate and make sure that you
[1:10:42] know he who builds a tower you know must
[1:10:45] first sit down and count the cost to see
[1:10:46] if he has enough money and then he
[1:10:48] builds the tower you know and brother
[1:10:50] Jack he uses the movie and he's instead
[1:10:52] of the word he says if you build it
[1:10:54] they'll come I've just play in there but
[1:11:03] you know I you know to show that we're
[1:11:05] on sometimes you know we're in we're in
[1:11:08] two different you know viewpoints but
[1:11:11] that but that III appreciate his faith
[1:11:14] you know and and and the gift that he
[1:11:17] has I realized you know brother Nathan
[1:11:18] Bryant and I have been friends for even
[1:11:20] a few years longer than brother Jack and
[1:11:22] I have been friends and realized that
[1:11:23] you know God used the gifts and talents
[1:11:25] in his life and he started a church you
[1:11:27] know I could have done the same thing
[1:11:28] sometimes I look and go well why didn't
[1:11:30] I do that why that I could be the pastor
[1:11:32] and you know that need be the Evangelist
[1:11:33] and you know things would be different
[1:11:35] but you know but I but I recognize that
[1:11:37] God puts different talents in different
[1:11:39] gifts and different perspectives even
[1:11:42] brother Nathan that I used to work
[1:11:43] together and he had that entrepreneurial
[1:11:45] you know he took what I was doing I was
[1:11:47] working as on contract for this company
[1:11:49] and he took that and he took over for me
[1:11:51] when I left to take my current job and
[1:11:53] you know and then he's like well I did
[1:11:55] this you know if I'm doing this for
[1:11:57] these people I can do this for you know
[1:11:59] five other people and he made a business
[1:12:00] out of it you know so it was a job to me
[1:12:02] and it was a business to him well that
[1:12:04] same entrepreneurial spirit now brother
[1:12:05] Nathan you know he he
[1:12:07] one that starts a church you know so we
[1:12:11] recognize that God has different
[1:12:12] callings and different abilities in
[1:12:14] different people and we just we just
[1:12:15] thank God for all of those things yeah
[1:12:17] so but but so as we you know just to
[1:12:21] bless their to be in the in the Sunday
[1:12:22] school and going over the church age
[1:12:24] book and my I think I'd you know I was
[1:12:26] like oh man I I need about I got a I
[1:12:28] need about a week just here every night
[1:12:31] you know I could just I just preach you
[1:12:33] know I just you know got me so fired up
[1:12:37] and but it was to me very fulfilling to
[1:12:39] see a church that's using a curriculum
[1:12:42] that I put together by the help of the
[1:12:44] Lord but not to you know to take all the
[1:12:48] credit because as I was saying brother
[1:12:50] Jack sometimes kind of pushes me from
[1:12:51] behind and the story there is I was
[1:12:53] doing this curriculum for my Sunday
[1:12:55] School and then we had a change of
[1:12:56] leadership in our church and then I'm
[1:12:58] not teaching Sunday school and I had
[1:12:59] this curriculum about half written and
[1:13:01] then suddenly I'm not teaching anymore
[1:13:04] well you guys are like 1015 lessons
[1:13:07] behind me at that point
[1:13:10] I'm brother Jack's like brother Trevor
[1:13:12] you uh you can't stop writing this I
[1:13:17] said well brother you you know you
[1:13:19] you're doing fine you know you can teach
[1:13:21] this you you pick up you know you're
[1:13:22] you're the one teaching you go ahead you
[1:13:24] know it won't be the same so the fact
[1:13:29] that it's finished and I want to
[1:13:30] apologize because I have a box in the
[1:13:33] back of our van of published church age
[1:13:36] book study guides and my van is in my
[1:13:40] garage because we rented a car so I will
[1:13:46] send those to you all when I got back
[1:13:49] home I don't even have one with me to
[1:13:51] show you because just a few weeks ago we
[1:13:55] went down to Tennessee and there's a
[1:13:57] sister in the church that does not there
[1:13:58] that designed the cover for me and of
[1:14:00] course I forgot her copy as well so I
[1:14:02] gave her mine and never got a new one in
[1:14:05] back in my bag so I don't even have but
[1:14:06] it's a nice book it's 215 pages you'll
[1:14:10] have much more room to write your
[1:14:12] answers down because as many have
[1:14:13] commented I didn't give you any room to
[1:14:15] actually write answers
[1:14:18] so you'll actually have that room now
[1:14:21] and then you know our I know our
[1:14:23] resident grammarian isn't here as much I
[1:14:27] know that maybe there's a few others of
[1:14:29] you who have those gifts and you know I
[1:14:31] thought I was pretty decent until
[1:14:36] brother Nathan and you know he he'll
[1:14:39] tell you he's homeschooled and he's
[1:14:40] maybe not the greatest person with
[1:14:41] grammar and things like that and you
[1:14:43] know I give him a bad time about how he
[1:14:44] pronounces things and some of the things
[1:14:46] he says behind a pulpit and then I just
[1:14:47] had to stop because I was giving him a
[1:14:48] complex but you know he took a red pen
[1:14:52] in his OCD nature and just looked for
[1:14:54] things that were inconsistent and how I
[1:14:55] applied things and he I mean it was
[1:14:58] bleeding red I was like are you kidding
[1:15:00] me and so anyway so it's been cleaned up
[1:15:04] quite a bit quite a bit so you'll know
[1:15:08] you'll enjoy it so for those of you that
[1:15:10] are that are going to that class and
[1:15:11] doing that you know I appreciate that
[1:15:13] and those of you that aren't boy you you
[1:15:16] know you're missing out not just because
[1:15:17] I wrote the study guide but you know
[1:15:19] it's just you know I was thinking about
[1:15:22] it is here sitting in church and having
[1:15:25] a service like this you come and you
[1:15:27] bring you bring something to the table
[1:15:30] you bring your lick of fire you bring
[1:15:32] your desire to worship you bring things
[1:15:35] to the table this is a corporate setting
[1:15:36] its corporate worship and we're all
[1:15:38] supposed to participate but when you're
[1:15:40] doing a class like that you're just
[1:15:42] coming in and and just like this is for
[1:15:44] me you know I don't have to just I don't
[1:15:47] have to be a part I need to sometimes
[1:15:48] you come to church and the pastor ain't
[1:15:50] touching you you know you're just
[1:15:53] sitting there going well that's that's
[1:15:54] nice but doesn't everybody need and you
[1:15:55] don't know that like really aren't we
[1:15:57] past that yet and you know but there's
[1:15:58] somebody that's sitting there that's
[1:16:00] going oh my goodness I needed that you

[1:16:10] pastor you know but well you know okay
[1:16:13] praise God that you're a mature
[1:16:14] Christian you know we laugh because it's
[1:16:17] true you know it you've thought it
[1:16:20] you've sat there and gone what on earth
[1:16:22] that was a disaster
[1:16:24] no okay you know what be a mature
[1:16:25] Christian and come to church come on
[1:16:28] brother you go
[1:16:29] I don't know who you're hitting right

[1:16:33] to something I want you know I mean so
[1:16:36] you come and you participate in a
[1:16:39] service but when you're in a class like
[1:16:40] that is just like man just feed me
[1:16:43] anchor me put my feet you know and put
[1:16:47] my feet in the forum and then just put
[1:16:48] cement pour that cement in so that these
[1:16:50] feet can't go anywhere anchor me down
[1:16:53] and that's what that's what that's
[1:16:55] supposed to do you go slow and
[1:16:57] methodical and few pages here and there
[1:16:59] and pull in all of these truths that the
[1:17:02] Prophet that's given us it'll really
[1:17:03] stable you so so I think brother Jack in
[1:17:06] this church for pushing me to finish
[1:17:08] that and I just got an order for 480
[1:17:12] books from from a church in Georgia and
[1:17:15] so I just want to say whoever gets a
[1:17:17] blessing whoever is touched by this
[1:17:19] curriculum will you're a part of it this
[1:17:21] church is a part of it so I thank God
[1:17:25] for that so anyway all right enough of
[1:17:27] that little handwritten note little well
[1:17:32] family talk there so I I appreciate you
[1:17:36] all very much it's really really good to
[1:17:38] be back
[1:17:38] so all right shall we shall we shall we
[1:17:41] turn our thoughts to the Word of God now
[1:17:43] so first Thessalonians chapter 4 we just
[1:17:46] read and we you know the devil has been
[1:17:51] really trying to frustrate us this this
[1:17:54] trip we started out I left work a little
[1:17:57] early I get to budget rental car and I
[1:17:59] get the keys and I'm man I'm just you
[1:18:02] know things are working like clockwork
[1:18:03] I'm on the roll I'm you know left work
[1:18:06] even a little earlier than I planned now
[1:18:08] I'm at the airport now I got a car put
[1:18:10] my bag in the car oh yeah we ain't we
[1:18:15] ain't showing up at spirit and truth
[1:18:16] Tabernacles smelling like we've been
[1:18:18] smoking
[1:18:21] this dis car hang on work so I'll bring
[1:18:27] the keys back in I said that one's
[1:18:30] unacceptable I'm sorry I just you got to
[1:18:32] give me a different one I'm sorry sir we
[1:18:33] don't have a different one you know you
[1:18:36] can take a 12-passenger van if you'd
[1:18:37] like I rented a very nice SUV and now
[1:18:44] you want me to drive a 12-passenger van
[1:18:45] for 18 hours no no it's not a pride
[1:18:52] thing it's a comfort thing here you know
[1:18:57] so you know well all the Fords have been
[1:19:00] recalled and this is the only one we
[1:19:02] have and you know I I won't go through
[1:19:04] all of what I tried to push and pull and
[1:19:06] ice lord I know that the devil is just
[1:19:09] trying to frustrate me here and to be
[1:19:11] quite honest it's slightly working I am
[1:19:13] getting a little frustrated I need to be
[1:19:15] getting down the road but I know Lord
[1:19:19] you're gonna if I have to take a
[1:19:20] 12-passenger van I have to but lord I do
[1:19:22] not want to but finally you know
[1:19:25] miraculously or other ways I don't
[1:19:28] really know if they just lied or what
[1:19:30] they did but suddenly one of these
[1:19:32] recalled forward expeditions shows up
[1:19:34] and they finally get it cleaned up for
[1:19:36] us and it puts us an hour and 15 minutes
[1:19:39] later whatever and we get to the hotel
[1:19:41] and I don't know if the just the way
[1:19:44] they air was working in that car just
[1:19:47] you know brother branham talked about
[1:19:48] how the air would come across his face
[1:19:50] and so we get to the hotel and I'm like
[1:19:51] why does my throat hurt like no I'm
[1:19:54] preaching six times this week let's
[1:19:56] that's supposed to happen as we leave
[1:19:58] like I get that but before I start
[1:20:00] preaching like no my throat's not
[1:20:02] supposed to be hurting right now so you
[1:20:04] pray for me and then we get to well when
[1:20:06] we get to the hotel it's midnight we're
[1:20:08] tired we're frustrated and they don't
[1:20:12] have my reservation and the hotel is
[1:20:14] full and every hotel on that exit is
[1:20:16] full and you know start calling around
[1:20:18] try to find a hotel finally you know
[1:20:20] asleep by 1:30 or something like that
[1:20:22] you know get up and I don't know what
[1:20:25] happens on i-75 between you know I 10
[1:20:29] and Ocala every day but I certainly hope
[1:20:32] it's not usually
[1:20:33] I feel sorry for anybody that has to
[1:20:34] drive through that stop and go for like
[1:20:37] a hundred miles or something like that
[1:20:38] I'm just like you know one of those
[1:20:40] things alone is you know but EFT you
[1:20:43] know just keeps hitting you it's like oh
[1:20:46] like they're full like you lost already
[1:20:49] would you get the picture as I'm going
[1:20:53] I'm preaching you can delay me you can
[1:20:56] frustrate me whatever fine you know but
[1:21:00] God's will will proof be prevailed so I
[1:21:03] think the Lord we're here and those
[1:21:04] things are just you know not even trials
[1:21:08] I remember brother Jack talking one time
[1:21:10] about being in the bus and headed up to
[1:21:12] you know headed up to see us and you
[1:21:15] know all the DVD players as well yeah
[1:21:18] rather that's that's terrible you know I
[1:21:20] better the Apostle Paul was really you
[1:21:22] know I thought that was a great zinger
[1:21:28] so I have to just you know I'm sure the
[1:21:31] Apostle Paul you know would have loved
[1:21:33] to have traveled in a Ford Expedition
[1:21:35] where he went to and probably wouldn't
[1:21:37] complain too bad about you know how many
[1:21:40] miles is it from here to you know nine
[1:21:42] hundred miles from here to Louisville or
[1:21:44] something like that you know and the
[1:21:46] Apostle Paul probably would have loved
[1:21:47] to have just been in the vehicle that I
[1:21:48] was in the Apostle Paul would have loved
[1:21:50] the 12-passenger man so all of those
[1:21:54] annoyances aside we are here and we are
[1:21:56] so supremely blessed amen so you know we
[1:22:03] got a we got a look at the things that
[1:22:05] God has blessed us in so 1st
[1:22:07] Thessalonians 4 all right we're really
[1:22:08] going to get into it now so 1st
[1:22:10] Thessalonians 4 we read about it coming
[1:22:13] about a time when you know there there
[1:22:16] are dead in Christ that have gone on as
[1:22:18] brother Jack said you know brother
[1:22:20] brother birds you know he's not here
[1:22:21] anymore in this I thought that was that
[1:22:23] sad this is the first time I've been
[1:22:25] here since he's passed on and but you
[1:22:29] know that's kind of appropriate to be
[1:22:30] thinking about because this is this is
[1:22:32] what we're talking about is there's a
[1:22:33] time coming when those and brother birds
[1:22:37] are gonna come they're not gonna prevent
[1:22:40] us they're coming first they're gonna
[1:22:42] come up and they're gonna have a body
[1:22:45] change
[1:22:46] we're gonna come we're gonna fellowship
[1:22:48] with them we're gonna take a body change
[1:22:49] and then we're gonna meet God in the air
[1:22:52] that's what the scripture is telling us
[1:22:54] we are going to meet Christ in the air
[1:22:57] we're gonna be caught up together with
[1:23:00] brother birds in the clouds to meet the
[1:23:03] Lord in the air and ever be with the
[1:23:05] Lord you see there is coming a day that
[1:23:08] a supernatural event is going to take
[1:23:11] place in your life so my title this
[1:23:16] morning is the coming supernatural now
[1:23:19] you as soon as we get into this just we
[1:23:21] read the next scripture you're gonna be
[1:23:23] like what is this part three yes this is
[1:23:25] nothing what is it nothing is impossible
[1:23:28] with God this is nothing as impossible
[1:23:30] with God part three brother Jack started
[1:23:33] telling me and really did you really
[1:23:36] because I'd already you know this is
[1:23:39] really what I want to bring this morning
[1:23:40] and then he's like yeah I've talked
[1:23:42] about Barry he's like I never caught
[1:23:43] this and Mary you know I was like really
[1:23:50] that's nice that's nice because I was
[1:23:52] gonna talk about Mary you always do that
[1:23:54] to me you can't tell him anything the
[1:24:05] coming supernatural the coming
[1:24:08] supernatural it's gonna happen in your
[1:24:11] life as Christians this is what we
[1:24:14] believe
[1:24:14] look this isn't about just you don't be
[1:24:16] nice to one another love people and
[1:24:20] God's gonna give you money and God's
[1:24:22] gonna take care of your problems and God
[1:24:26] does all those things nothing is
[1:24:29] impossible but is that what this
[1:24:32] Christian walk is about now those are
[1:24:35] the benefits that come with the
[1:24:38] responsibilities that he's given us the
[1:24:40] responsibility that we have to believe
[1:24:43] the Word of God and the Word of God says
[1:24:46] there's a coming a day and it's coming
[1:24:48] soon that we are gonna take a step over
[1:24:51] and get caught up
[1:24:53] to meet the Lord in the air that's what
[1:24:55] it means to be a Christian and then
[1:24:57] we're not looking for a millennium here
[1:24:59] we're not looking for a good time here
[1:25:02] but we're look we're saying no Jesus is
[1:25:04] what satisfies me Jesus is what I want
[1:25:08] to be with so I'm looking I'm not
[1:25:10] satisfied here even in my comfy SUV I'm
[1:25:14] not satisfied here
[1:25:17] look the Christian doesn't care how good
[1:25:20] you can make it here you know and we
[1:25:23] thought we ought to be content in
[1:25:25] whatever state we are in but to the
[1:25:28] Christian there's always a little
[1:25:30] longing in his heart we can be content
[1:25:33] with what God gave us
[1:25:34] but on another sense nothing will ever
[1:25:36] be good enough when we're standing here
[1:25:38] on these two feet because he is
[1:25:41] everything
[1:25:43] now we ought to have that kind of
[1:25:45] relationship here but there should be a
[1:25:47] longing if you are a Christian that says
[1:25:49] I can't wait for that day I am looking
[1:25:52] for the coming and Mary was one of those
[1:25:55] people she was looking for the coming of
[1:25:57] the Messiah and we ought to be looking
[1:26:02] for the coming of a messiah amen oh my
[1:26:07] I'll try not to preach to a Monday night
[1:26:09] sermon here but I just caught how well
[1:26:14] these agree with one another so we look
[1:26:20] in Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14
[1:26:28] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:26:32] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:26:35] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:26:38] his name Immanuel butter and honey shall
[1:26:42] he eat that he may know to refuse the
[1:26:43] evil and choose the good so Isaiah here
[1:26:47] in this prophecy
[1:26:48] comes with a very scientific statement
[1:26:51] that a virgin shall conceive showing of
[1:26:56] course
[1:26:56] Isaiah's ignorant in matters of how
[1:27:00] these things work
[1:27:05] you know Isaiah if she has conceived she
[1:27:14] is no longer a virgin that's how this
[1:27:17] was a virgin cannot conceive that that
[1:27:21] those words should not be written
[1:27:23] together can't happen
[1:27:31] that is impossible let's look at Isaiah
[1:27:40] chapter 9 hey if you're a Christian this
[1:27:47] is what you believe that the impossible
[1:27:50] happened that a virgin did concede now
[1:27:55] Isaiah nine verses six unto us a child
[1:28:02] is born unto us a son is given the
[1:28:06] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:28:08] his name shall be called wonderful
[1:28:09] counsellor the mighty God the
[1:28:11] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:28:13] of the increase of his government and
[1:28:15] peace there shall be no end upon the
[1:28:16] throne of David upon his kingdom to
[1:28:18] order it to establish it with judgment
[1:28:20] and justice from henceforth even forever
[1:28:23] the zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[1:28:25] perform this so a child is going to be
[1:28:28] born a son is going to be given and
[1:28:32] among the things that he shall be called
[1:28:34] he shall be called the everlasting
[1:28:37] father he's a born into the world so he
[1:28:48] hasn't been everlasting his son that's
[1:28:52] born
[1:28:53] can't always be I mean he could be a
[1:28:55] father in twenty years or so but he
[1:28:58] can't be the everlasting father you
[1:29:00] can't have a son that is an everlasting
[1:29:02] father it just doesn't work Isaiah come
[1:29:10] on could you prophesize some things that
[1:29:15] actually make sense that actually work
[1:29:18] actually aren't impossible cuz that's
[1:29:24] what you're asking us I say we're
[1:29:27] staying reasonable people we went to
[1:29:30] school but you you are asking us to
[1:29:33] believe things that not not not just
[1:29:35] that you know a mountain could be moved
[1:29:38] and cast into the sea or something like
[1:29:39] that but you know cuz that really you
[1:29:42] know maybe a lot of wind or you know we
[1:29:43] could conceive of all kinds of crazy
[1:29:45] things but these things these things are
[1:29:47] just impossible by definition by just
[1:29:52] plain language these things are
[1:29:54] impossible they cannot be done I say how
[1:30:00] are we to believe you impossible
[1:30:05] impossible do you ever think how is it
[1:30:09] gonna happen this coming supernatural
[1:30:12] we're gonna we're gonna bounce back and
[1:30:13] forth we're gonna compare and contrast
[1:30:15] marry and us do you ever think where
[1:30:18] we're asked to believe oh yeah we are
[1:30:21] literally asked to believe that that
[1:30:24] someday the Lord is going to appear in
[1:30:26] the clouds and that we are going to be
[1:30:30] caught up with people who have been
[1:30:32] passed away and we are gonna and do you
[1:30:36] ever think how does that happen how does
[1:30:39] how does that happen you know I used to
[1:30:40] have dreams that the rapture was
[1:30:43] happening these are great dreams you
[1:30:47] know you get really excited for a little
[1:30:48] bit of time it was like oh my goodness
[1:30:50] and you know and and I remember one time
[1:30:52] I felt like I had you know you remember
[1:30:54] those old round sleds I was in an old
[1:30:57] round sled and there was no snow but I
[1:30:59] was in an old round sled and just kind
[1:31:01] of sitting there holding on and it
[1:31:02] suddenly I just man I just started
[1:31:04] getting lifted up and I was like oh
[1:31:05] praise God it's the rapture you know and
[1:31:07] I'm not preaching around sled doctrine
[1:31:09] that that's how we
[1:31:11] everybody get your round sleds no that's
[1:31:14] not what brother Trevor is saying but
[1:31:15] you know and I get so I get high in my
[1:31:17] dream and a hall praise God the rapture
[1:31:19] is happening in you man it's wonderful
[1:31:22] you know and then I look down sure hope
[1:31:25] the rapture is happening because that's
[1:31:28] a long way down and if this ain't the
[1:31:32] rapture then what goes until that time
[1:31:34] the law applies that what goes up must
[1:31:38] come now
[1:31:39] and now the rapture is going to defy
[1:31:41] that law of gravity but so if you're in
[1:31:43] around slid and you're really high in
[1:31:45] the air if you just better hope it's the
[1:31:47] rapture do you ever think about that
[1:31:50] though how is it gonna happen you know
[1:31:52] we're gonna be sitting around slid and
[1:31:53] just be just be lifted off the ground or
[1:31:55] we're just gonna be standing here just
[1:31:56] lifted off the ground or we you know we
[1:32:01] are we you know Star Trek you know
[1:32:03] dissolved and then Reda's alt or
[1:32:06] whatever I can't even remember what the
[1:32:07] word they use is and that but you know
[1:32:10] yes Jesus is gonna just beam us up or
[1:32:12] how does that work like what is it like
[1:32:14] I don't know and isn't it difficult
[1:32:16] that's see isn't that the problem is
[1:32:18] that we're asked to believe something
[1:32:20] that we don't understand I don't know
[1:32:22] how it's gonna happen I don't know if
[1:32:24] I'm gonna look down when Jesus comes and
[1:32:26] go Jesus I'm glad you come in cuz it's
[1:32:28] that's a long way down now
[1:32:30] I don't know will I be scared and
[1:32:34] excited will I just be excited will I
[1:32:36] just I don't know how I'm gonna feel I
[1:32:39] don't know how it will happen I don't
[1:32:41] know oh there's all kinds of questions
[1:32:43] surrounding this but I know that he is
[1:32:45] coming but see that's where we get to we
[1:32:49] get to a place where we like I don't
[1:32:51] know and when we don't know something we
[1:32:53] tend to try to push it away Oh pastor
[1:32:59] can you explain this to me no yeah
[1:33:01] pastors don't like saying that you know
[1:33:03] so a lot of times what they do is don't
[1:33:05] preach that you know just love one
[1:33:08] another we can't really explain that
[1:33:11] either but you know we all get it right
[1:33:15] cuz it's supernatural it's supernatural
[1:33:18] the Christian is commanded to believe
[1:33:21] the supernatural the Christian is comin
[1:33:24] to believe that the impossible is going
[1:33:26] to happen can I take it one step further
[1:33:28] you think oh how is it one step further
[1:33:30] and then the impossible can happen I
[1:33:32] want you to say I want you to know that
[1:33:34] the Christian is commanded to believe
[1:33:35] that the impossible is going to happen
[1:33:37] in your life oh it's easy yeah you know
[1:33:44] it's you know it's easy to believe for
[1:33:47] someone else's healing Oh God
[1:33:50] you know come here I'll lay my hands yes
[1:33:52] God is going to heal you claim it don't
[1:33:55] ever confess anything different you are
[1:33:57] healed in the name of Jesus and oh
[1:33:59] brother this man I heard would you hold
[1:34:03] you pray for me that this this won't
[1:34:05] last long because oh my goodness this is
[1:34:07] driving me crazy and I just I'm in such
[1:34:10] pain in the home man would you it's a
[1:34:14] lot harder you know where's that hey in
[1:34:16] Jesus name you healed and confess and
[1:34:19] it's all well and you know it's so easy
[1:34:23] to believe the supernatural can happen
[1:34:24] for someone else it's easy to believe
[1:34:26] that the supernatural that yes there's
[1:34:28] going to be people that take a rapture
[1:34:30] you know it was easy to believe that
[1:34:33] there was gonna be a great falling away
[1:34:34] you know and then we realized we knew
[1:34:36] those people we realized this oh yeah of
[1:34:41] course that's gonna happen but you know
[1:34:43] me yeah and then one of your best
[1:34:46] friends is that person that's like whoa
[1:34:50] this just got real
[1:34:52] all of a sudden and it's but you know
[1:34:58] what when those scriptures get real all
[1:35:01] of a sudden I want you to understand
[1:35:02] there's other scriptures that get real
[1:35:06] on us and why because the supernatural
[1:35:08] is real because this is a reality these
[1:35:14] aren't just things that we say these
[1:35:16] aren't just platitudes and little isms
[1:35:19] of this isn't that snow but this is
[1:35:21] reality that we're preaching that you
[1:35:24] were born into this world why were you
[1:35:26] born into this world because God created
[1:35:28] you because God
[1:35:30] created this earth and everything that
[1:35:32] says in the book of Genesis tells you
[1:35:34] why you're here and who you are and what
[1:35:36] you're doing and it's reality and to
[1:35:39] deny that is to deny reality and I'm so
[1:35:43] glad today we we prove over and over
[1:35:46] that God is alive and he's in our midst
[1:35:48] he is reality my praise the Lord okay
[1:35:54] Luke chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 verses 26
[1:36:01] we start in the sixth month the angel
[1:36:04] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[1:36:06] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[1:36:08] espoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[1:36:10] of the house of David the Virgin's name
[1:36:13] was Mary we didn't we just read about a
[1:36:16] virgin conceiving and then very
[1:36:18] obviously virgin espoused to a man whose
[1:36:22] name was Joseph of the house of David
[1:36:24] and the Virgin's Naito Duss that already
[1:36:27] you told us Luke that that she's a
[1:36:29] virgin you did you didn't have to repeat
[1:36:31] that we'd sort of picked that up already
[1:36:34] yeah there's a reason he's making a
[1:36:38] connection for you he's stressing
[1:36:40] something this is the one that was
[1:36:43] talked about in Isaiah chapter 7 there's
[1:36:47] something to this the angel came in unto
[1:36:49] her and said hail thou that art highly
[1:36:51] favoured the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:36:52] art thou among women and when she saw
[1:36:55] him she was troubled at the saying he
[1:36:56] cast in her mind what manner of
[1:36:58] salutation shall this be and the angel
[1:37:00] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[1:37:02] found favor with God and behold thou
[1:37:05] shalt conceive in thy womb and bring
[1:37:07] forth his son shall call his name Jesus
[1:37:08] he shall be great shall be called the
[1:37:10] son of the highest the Lord God she'll
[1:37:12] give unto him the throne of his father
[1:37:14] David and he shall reign over the house
[1:37:16] of Jacob forever and of his kingdom
[1:37:17] there shall be no end then said Mary
[1:37:19] unto the angel how shall this be seeing
[1:37:21] I know not a man and the angel answered
[1:37:23] and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall
[1:37:25] come upon thee and the power of the
[1:37:27] highest shall overshadow thee therefore
[1:37:28] also that holy thing which shall be born
[1:37:31] of thee shall be called the Son of God
[1:37:33] and behold my cousin Elizabeth she has
[1:37:36] also conceived a son in her old age and
[1:37:37] this is the six month with her who was
[1:37:40] called barren for with God nothing shall
[1:37:43] be impossible
[1:37:44] and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the
[1:37:46] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:37:48] and the angel departed from her now
[1:37:51] obviously you've been covering this
[1:37:52] scripture for the last couple of weeks
[1:37:54] but we want to just look at some of
[1:37:57] these things you know she cast in her
[1:37:59] mind what manner of salutation this
[1:38:01] should be and this is a really good
[1:38:02] thing you know when we're presented with
[1:38:04] information you know we really ought to
[1:38:05] cast in our mind what is this about is
[1:38:08] this really something I should listen to
[1:38:10] or isn't it you know especially when an
[1:38:16] angel comes to you and says you know
[1:38:18] very great things we ought to we ought
[1:38:21] to go hmm what is this about an angel
[1:38:24] has just come to me and said some really
[1:38:27] great things said I was highly favored
[1:38:29] and said I was going to have a son and
[1:38:31] many you know wonderful things that you
[1:38:34] know seem impossible but an angel what
[1:38:37] is this about why is this angel talking
[1:38:40] to me why is this angel talking to me
[1:38:51] what is this about why is this why is
[1:38:55] this prophet coming and saying things to
[1:38:59] me what is this what is my life why is
[1:39:03] this impacting me why has this come
[1:39:06] across my path at this time you see it's
[1:39:12] not just some random chance but this
[1:39:14] that there's there's a purpose that God
[1:39:16] is these things are affecting you and
[1:39:19] impacting you for a purpose so she
[1:39:22] begins to say you know well Who am I and
[1:39:24] what is my life why am i a part of this
[1:39:26] what what is this angel what is this
[1:39:28] thing that's going on here and so now
[1:39:30] that you're here and you're in church
[1:39:32] and you're hearing this you ought to be
[1:39:34] thinking your mind what is this I'm
[1:39:35] hearing why am I here what is there
[1:39:39] something to this is this is this bad
[1:39:42] pizza or is this real I want you to know
[1:39:47] this is real
[1:39:52] so maybe we ought to act like Mary in
[1:39:55] that and just begin to consider now see
[1:39:59] Mary was just a normal girl
[1:40:01] in a very normal place maybe even look
[1:40:05] down upon just a little bit you know can
[1:40:07] any good thing come of Nazareth and
[1:40:08] here's Mary and Mary Mary had every
[1:40:11] reason to believe that she was
[1:40:13] completely insignificant completely what
[1:40:18] shows show me what Mary had was that
[1:40:21] money was it Fame was it what was it why
[1:40:24] why does God choose her
[1:40:25] iiiiii I'd love to know because the
[1:40:28] scripture doesn't really tell us much we
[1:40:31] can infer from things that you know how
[1:40:33] you know like it says of Simeon you know
[1:40:35] that he was just into devout waiting on
[1:40:37] a consolation of Israel there were
[1:40:38] different ones that that had a character
[1:40:41] about them and God recognizes this
[1:40:43] character and her ability now to hear
[1:40:46] this angel and to receive what he is
[1:40:49] saying is really showing something about
[1:40:51] her character willing to believe the
[1:40:56] impossible willing to believe that what
[1:41:00] is being spoken could be manifested in
[1:41:03] her life hallelujah you see if you're
[1:41:09] there maybe you feel completely
[1:41:13] insignificant and Who am I but if you're
[1:41:15] there if you are saying I I can listen
[1:41:18] and I can believe that this will happen
[1:41:20] in my life you are blessed you are
[1:41:23] blessed now now Mary then she says in
[1:41:26] verse 34 how shall this be seeing I know
[1:41:31] not a man now is she is she
[1:41:33] doubting here is she doubting what the
[1:41:36] Angels saying oh she's not doubting what
[1:41:39] the Angels saying she's not gone
[1:41:41] yeah angel doesn't know virgin can
[1:41:45] conceive either no she's just saying
[1:41:52] Amen okay how so this happened like I
[1:41:59] don't understand that
[1:42:01] could you could you help me a little bit
[1:42:03] on
[1:42:04] understand what it is you're asking me
[1:42:06] I'm willing that's fine but could you
[1:42:09] give me a little bit more here you know
[1:42:12] there's nothing wrong with a desire for
[1:42:13] the word there's nothing wrong with
[1:42:15] asking I don't understand could you help
[1:42:19] me to see this more that's not doubt you
[1:42:25] see but there was another couple that we
[1:42:27] were at about here that Elizabeth and
[1:42:29] you know her husband Zacharias and an
[1:42:32] angel comes to him and says your wife is
[1:42:35] going to have a baby now brother Branham
[1:42:38] says now look at the difference between
[1:42:40] Zacharias that minister who'd studied
[1:42:43] the scriptures over and over and over
[1:42:45] and over and over again had plenty of
[1:42:47] examples that was Sara and Hanna so
[1:42:50] forth back in the Old Testament plenty
[1:42:52] of examples what he's telling us is
[1:42:54] there was examples in the Old Testament
[1:42:56] where old barren women had conceived and
[1:43:01] born sons all - plenty of examples that
[1:43:05] God had done this before he doubted it
[1:43:08] to be so but this little girl this Mary
[1:43:11] she didn't doubt she said Behold the
[1:43:12] handmaid of the Lord and be it unto me
[1:43:14] according to the word what a difference
[1:43:15] he says now sometimes you can callus
[1:43:18] yourself reading the Bible just like
[1:43:20] reading a newspaper and having the same
[1:43:22] kind of faith that you have in one that
[1:43:25] you wouldn't the other and then you
[1:43:26] calles yourself when you read God's Word
[1:43:28] believe it just like it says it is there
[1:43:31] and take God and His Word you see the
[1:43:35] devil
[1:43:36] you know he's gotten things to where you
[1:43:39] you can't even believe anything anymore
[1:43:40] right
[1:43:41] can you believe the news agencies you
[1:43:45] know I was going there fake news was
[1:43:53] Trump the first president in 20 years to
[1:43:55] not visit the the guys the troops and in
[1:43:59] at Christmastime or wasn't he you know
[1:44:01] and I mean it's just one of the recent
[1:44:03] ones that I just happened to see not
[1:44:05] that I even follow that closely you know
[1:44:09] and then somebody's like what part of
[1:44:10] this picture with Trump of Trump with
[1:44:12] the troops was not him visiting Trump
[1:44:15] you know that the troops at
[1:44:16] Christmastime you know I mean there's
[1:44:18] many things are just reporting and
[1:44:19] they're saying this and saying that and
[1:44:22] you can't believe anything anymore and
[1:44:24] the devil is actually designing things
[1:44:26] in such a way that did to get you to a
[1:44:29] place to get this culture to a place
[1:44:31] well that nothing is true because if he
[1:44:36] can get in your mind and the minds of
[1:44:38] you know you think we're here and we see
[1:44:40] this we see this thing happening but you
[1:44:43] go and you look at our children and
[1:44:45] their children and what where are they
[1:44:47] going to be they're gonna be living in a
[1:44:48] world where people don't believe
[1:44:50] anything and if you're living in a world
[1:44:52] where people don't believe anything and
[1:44:54] then you go oh you know what
[1:44:56] you should believe this this is truth
[1:45:00] and they go one truth well what's that
[1:45:04] word that's one of those Old English
[1:45:07] words right truth because we we don't
[1:45:09] have those things we gotta be careful
[1:45:14] the devil would like to get us to a
[1:45:16] place where nothing is believable
[1:45:18] oh my you see what today we live in so
[1:45:24] you got to make sure that you don't
[1:45:25] calles yourself to the word that you
[1:45:27] don't allow that culture to pull you
[1:45:29] into such a place where you begin to get
[1:45:31] kind of a skeptic assist about
[1:45:33] everything that you read and everything
[1:45:35] that you hear and then you go I say
[1:45:38] virgin conceived I'm smarter than that
[1:45:46] you can't deceive me try to be all
[1:45:51] spiritual say you a prophet say things
[1:45:55] that don't even make sense and then
[1:45:56] think I'm gonna believe it right yeah I
[1:45:58] wasn't born yesterday you know
[1:46:02] God forgive me I don't believe any of
[1:46:04] that you understand right we're together
[1:46:06] on this huh I'm say this is how the
[1:46:09] devil would like to get into your mind
[1:46:11] and cause you to think and thus make the
[1:46:14] Word of God uneffective to you
[1:46:16] completely now but let's look again at
[1:46:18] Mary now see see as soon as she read
[1:46:21] this and she's seen us be hope before
[1:46:23] the anus of the Lord said you're going
[1:46:24] to have a baby look at what she had to
[1:46:26] believe she had to believe something
[1:46:29] that
[1:46:30] never happens Zacarias didn't happen
[1:46:33] have to plenty of times did that happen
[1:46:36] through the scriptures he had plenty of
[1:46:39] examples he also happened to be the
[1:46:44] husband of a woman who could have
[1:46:51] children it's not impossible it was just
[1:46:55] very difficult for them they were just
[1:46:57] too old but they at least were married
[1:47:01] Mary is asked to believe if you have no
[1:47:04] husband this has never happened but you
[1:47:08] have to believe that you're going to
[1:47:10] conceive Mary had to believe something
[1:47:15] that was totally impossible and had
[1:47:17] never happened before but yet she didn't
[1:47:19] stagger at it she just said Behold the
[1:47:22] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[1:47:24] she took God at His Word so we are
[1:47:27] expecting a coming supernatural we're
[1:47:29] expecting a catching away of the bride
[1:47:32] of Jesus Christ
[1:47:33] we're expecting a rapture to take the
[1:47:35] Churchill a guess what it's never
[1:47:37] happened before the Lord has never come
[1:47:42] now now when Jesus don't don't
[1:47:44] misunderstand me you know be all
[1:47:46] technical Jesus rose
[1:47:48] he took the Saints Abraham and Sarah are
[1:47:51] therein in Palestine or not Palestine to
[1:47:54] Paradise right now and okay but but you
[1:47:57] understand now we are asked to believe
[1:47:59] that Jesus is coming in the clouds and
[1:48:02] that we are going to be taken up and
[1:48:04] meeting him this has not happened before
[1:48:07] this is impossible this is unscientific
[1:48:13] this is supernatural Mary was asked to
[1:48:17] believe something unscientific
[1:48:19] supernatural had never happened before
[1:48:21] and she said be it unto me according to
[1:48:24] your word do you see the attitude that
[1:48:26] she took to what the angel I mean I mean
[1:48:30] did you see the attitude that she took
[1:48:34] to what the angel brought to her can I
[1:48:40] can I can I
[1:48:41] and I just can I just I just I just
[1:48:44] sorry I just can't can you can you see
[1:48:49] the attitude that she took to what the
[1:48:53] angel said to her we've had we've had a
[1:48:57] prophet in our day it was the seventh
[1:49:00] angel you maybe you understand the
[1:49:03] language that I'm using there's plenty
[1:49:05] in Revelations we're in a seventh Church
[1:49:07] shades the Laodicean Church age
[1:49:08] revelations 314 that there was an angel
[1:49:11] that was going to come to that church
[1:49:14] and that that God would give a message
[1:49:16] to that angel and and I could take you
[1:49:19] and bring you through many different
[1:49:21] things to prove to you how wonderful and
[1:49:24] beautiful this scripture is hey if you
[1:49:27] would like to come Monday night that's
[1:49:28] what I'm planning on doing it's good I
[1:49:30] mean I'm gonna just blow everybody's
[1:49:32] minds my mind included every time I look
[1:49:34] at this I'm just like not that I'm doing
[1:49:36] it but that it's just God's Word and you
[1:49:38] you student you take a look at Eagle God
[1:49:42] that's that's impossible
[1:49:48] because I want to tell you that the man
[1:49:52] that wrote this book God is the best
[1:49:55] author he is the greatest author that
[1:49:58] you you talk about plot twists theirs
[1:50:01] plot twists all my goodness you go I
[1:50:04] didn't see that coming till I read it 20
[1:50:08] times
[1:50:09] and there's still more in there how
[1:50:11] every time I read this this book gets
[1:50:13] better the third time you read a book
[1:50:18] it's probably getting boring I don't
[1:50:19] care who it is what author it is but man
[1:50:21] the third time you read this you just
[1:50:23] starting to get it
[1:50:25] amen so it was the attitude and then so
[1:50:29] what I'm saying is is that we are
[1:50:30] following a prophet that is the
[1:50:33] manifestation of revelations 3:14 that
[1:50:35] there was an angel to the last church
[1:50:38] age and and Mary had an attitude that
[1:50:41] she had toward what the angel had said
[1:50:44] to her and we are being looked at and
[1:50:46] what the attitude that we have toward
[1:50:49] what the angel
[1:50:50] is saying to us hey mint now and this is
[1:50:54] that angel he's a man but it it's a
[1:50:57] messenger that God sent us and this
[1:51:00] pillar of fire well that's just Jesus
[1:51:01] Christ not that the man is but that
[1:51:04] pillar of fire that that's the same
[1:51:06] thing that led Moses that's the same
[1:51:07] thing that struck Paul on the road to
[1:51:09] Damascus amen so so we're Mary you know
[1:51:15] she comes and she has an attitude to
[1:51:18] believe even though all of these things
[1:51:20] are impossible but she has an attitude
[1:51:22] to believe what the angel says to her
[1:51:26] she has the right attitude to believe it
[1:51:28] oh my that's just that's just powerful
[1:51:30] we you know the right attitude towards
[1:51:33] any promise of God brings it to pass so
[1:51:39] what what begins to how did she get into
[1:51:41] this attitude and brother branham begins
[1:51:43] to dramatize it and he and can we maybe
[1:51:45] look it let's just look at at this
[1:51:48] prophecy that a virgin shall conceive
[1:51:49] and maybe before the angel comes to Mary
[1:51:52] maybe we can have a dramatization that
[1:51:55] brother Branham kind of gives us you
[1:51:56] know here's Mary and all of her friends
[1:51:59] around the well one day and and and and
[1:52:02] everybody's talking and you know maybe
[1:52:04] the conversation went something like
[1:52:05] this you know do you all believe that
[1:52:07] prophecy of Isaiah you know that a
[1:52:09] virgin shall conceive I mean are we
[1:52:11] really looking for a messiah to come
[1:52:13] because you know Isaiah lived 700 years
[1:52:17] ago and really really that prophecy if
[1:52:19] you if you look in kings and chronicles
[1:52:21] and you you and Isaiah and you recognize
[1:52:23] what's going on here is one of the Kings
[1:52:25] had asked for a sign and Isaiah says our
[1:52:28] virgin shall conceive so I mean had
[1:52:30] every reason to believe that it should
[1:52:32] have happened like right then but it
[1:52:34] didn't and so then we decide ah okay
[1:52:40] it's a prophecy it's it's the coming
[1:52:42] Messiah
[1:52:43] that's wonderful okay so we're expecting
[1:52:45] this to happen and then Isaiah passes
[1:52:47] away and well was it was he true I mean
[1:52:51] was he a true prophet I mean he
[1:52:53] prophesied this he's dead now and it
[1:52:54] hadn't happened
[1:52:56] I mean I don't I don't know if anybody
[1:52:59] finds themselves there with anything
[1:53:04] where you're at but so they're there and
[1:53:09] they say y'all my granddaddy
[1:53:11] he believed that Messiah was coming do
[1:53:13] you know that my granddaddy almost
[1:53:15] didn't let his daughter get married
[1:53:17] because he was so bent on her being the
[1:53:19] one to bring the Messiah and of course
[1:53:23] if you're married you're not a virgin
[1:53:24] anymore and then and then you you know
[1:53:26] you just kind of done you know prophesy
[1:53:29] ain't gonna happen through you anymore
[1:53:31] so it's a it's a merit you know I do
[1:53:33] believe in miracles it's a miracle I'm
[1:53:35] here because of the way my granddaddy
[1:53:37] believed the scripture and you know what
[1:53:40] his granddaddy believed the same thing
[1:53:42] and his granddaddy before him believed
[1:53:43] the same thing and at some point at some
[1:53:45] point please I mean come on
[1:53:47] at some point isn't there a statute of
[1:53:50] limitations to this this it's been 700
[1:53:56] years
[1:53:57] can you count the 700 that's a bit high
[1:54:01] in it that's a lot of years yeah
[1:54:04] is there anybody in here and that's 700
[1:54:06] years old no no there's nobody here 700
[1:54:09] years old 700 years
[1:54:17] we've been waiting for this prophecy I
[1:54:19] just you know I I mean at some point
[1:54:22] guys sitting around here around the well
[1:54:24] I just you know I just don't know that I
[1:54:26] can see that this is gonna happen you
[1:54:31] know at what point do we say oh yeah I
[1:54:35] just you know I think about this
[1:54:38] sometime you know I I want my children
[1:54:40] believe this sin to know this and I
[1:54:42] believe this is real you know and if I'm
[1:54:44] sitting there in my hospital bed and
[1:54:46] I've been telling them Jesus is coming
[1:54:47] soon they've been hearing they've been
[1:54:49] traveling around the country hearing me
[1:54:50] preach this right here and you know hey
[1:54:52] there's a common supernatural it's gonna
[1:54:53] happen soon and I hope I have time to
[1:54:55] get into that a bit but you know and
[1:54:58] then they're up maybe I'm 50 years from
[1:55:01] now am I in my hospital bed and you know
[1:55:04] hey Dad you believe that Jesus was
[1:55:07] coming yes I still believe it
[1:55:09] it's just as true today as it was when I
[1:55:11] was preaching it in West Palm Beach 50
[1:55:13] years ago but we are tempted to believe
[1:55:18] that you know we put times on it
[1:55:21] sometimes but God isn't putting the
[1:55:23] times on it and the time has nothing to
[1:55:25] do with it because God gave a prophecy
[1:55:26] and God
[1:55:27] guess what he doesn't have time he's not
[1:55:30] in time
[1:55:31] and so 700 years go by and these kids
[1:55:34] they're there around the well thinking I
[1:55:35] don't know you know it's been a long
[1:55:38] time people have believed this and died
[1:55:40] and believe this and died and believe
[1:55:42] this didn't died and you know am I gonna
[1:55:44] be one of those am I gonna believe this
[1:55:46] and die come on hmm a lot of people have
[1:55:51] believed in a rapture and have died and
[1:55:52] gone on before and maybe we're sitting
[1:55:56] around a well sometimes with some of our
[1:55:57] friends going you know is this rapture
[1:55:58] thing really true I mean maybe we should
[1:56:00] just be you know nice and love one
[1:56:02] another and you know kumbaya my lord
[1:56:05] kumbaya kumbaya oh this is church
[1:56:11] kumbaya
[1:56:12] I mean don't y'all feel so good when you
[1:56:14] get done why don't we just go back to
[1:56:20] that and just you know and just live and
[1:56:22] be good you know we should just be good
[1:56:24] to one another that's just that's what
[1:56:26] God is just asking us to be it's just
[1:56:28] good no God is asking you to believe in
[1:56:30] a supernatural event that's coming it is
[1:56:33] coming and just as it came to Mary and
[1:56:36] Mary witnessing these these young people
[1:56:39] sitting there around the world talking
[1:56:41] and saying I don't know my granddaddy
[1:56:43] and his granddaddy believe this and it
[1:56:44] hasn't happened guess what maybe your
[1:56:47] granddaddy believed this that Jesus was
[1:56:48] coming maybe his granddaddy believed it
[1:56:50] he's and they're dead but guess what it
[1:56:52] is going to happen it happened to Mary
[1:56:54] and it's going to happen to you and
[1:56:56] that's what I'm asking you to believe
[1:56:58] this morning is it's going to happen to
[1:57:00] you but a supernatural event a catching
[1:57:03] away a rapture is going to take place in
[1:57:05] your life so Joseph and where we were
[1:57:08] asking you know well how I you know what
[1:57:11] what would put Mary in the attitude in
[1:57:13] the condition to be able to accept this
[1:57:15] and so maybe they had that conversation
[1:57:17] and then she's walking home with Joseph
[1:57:19] and saying you know do you Joseph do you
[1:57:21] believe this
[1:57:22] for seeing they begin to talk about the
[1:57:24] scriptures and Joseph began to say oh I
[1:57:26] believe it Mary I I know it's been a
[1:57:28] while but God's Word has never failed
[1:57:30] and then they just began to talking and
[1:57:32] their faith begins to rise up you know
[1:57:34] because they were just speaking
[1:57:36] positively about the word and they were
[1:57:38] confessing the Word of God and saying I
[1:57:41] believe in it
[1:57:41] brother Branham says you know the reason
[1:57:44] an angel came to her home is because she
[1:57:46] had prepared her home let me let me read
[1:57:49] that so I don't just mess that up so bad
[1:57:51] if you want the honor of an angel
[1:57:54] visiting your home have a home ready for
[1:57:57] him to visit prepared and ready under
[1:58:00] the blood of the Lamb angels of the Lord
[1:58:03] come to such places you see the angels
[1:58:07] of God love to come to a home that's
[1:58:09] prepared haumai prepared is how about
[1:58:13] this home right here is this home
[1:58:15] prepared for an angel of the Lord to
[1:58:18] honor a visit - have you been speaking
[1:58:22] about the Word of God have you been you
[1:58:24] know having your conversation about the
[1:58:26] Word of God have you been confessing and
[1:58:27] allowing your heart to believe the
[1:58:30] things that God is asking you to believe
[1:58:33] because an angel of God can come and
[1:58:35] visit your home that's that's what I
[1:58:38] want I'm thankful that an angel of God
[1:58:41] has at least his voice now we brother
[1:58:47] madam says have to believe the
[1:58:49] impossible I'll try to hurry here we
[1:58:51] have to believe the impossible to see
[1:58:53] new life amen
[1:58:55] you've got but when you believe the
[1:58:57] impossible the doctor says you've got
[1:58:59] cancer you're dying you you've got to
[1:59:01] believe the impossible to see a new life
[1:59:03] take hold of you now amen if the doctor
[1:59:06] says you'll never walk you've got to
[1:59:08] believe me impossible to see new life
[1:59:10] come into you new life in them fibers
[1:59:13] and all God bring forth a new hand a new
[1:59:15] arm new lungs new stomach whatever it is
[1:59:18] God will do it if you take him at his
[1:59:20] word now she had no evidence of it at
[1:59:26] all only his word oh I like that I think
[1:59:30] right now stop just a moment I don't
[1:59:32] preach to everybody that lives right on
[1:59:34] the highway I have to go down
[1:59:35] Elaine sometime to pick up somebody so
[1:59:38] you know we want to see new life right
[1:59:42] old things have passed away
[1:59:44] all things have become new we want to
[1:59:46] see new life take place on the inside
[1:59:48] we're gonna have to believe the
[1:59:50] impossible you know brother Branham said
[1:59:52] about Abraham you know as Abraham's
[1:59:53] taking Isaac you know the promised son
[1:59:55] up to offer him on the on the on the
[1:59:58] mountain he said God was taking away
[2:00:00] every evidence from Abraham god that's
[2:00:06] that's not fair that's not very nice
[2:00:10] it's hard enough to believe you as it is
[2:00:12] you know at least you could give us some
[2:00:14] evidence you know but think about Mary
[2:00:17] Mary highly favored the Lord Holy Ghost
[2:00:23] is going to overshadow you and you will
[2:00:25] conceive a son it's never happened
[2:00:28] before she goes oh oh yes I feel I feel
[2:00:36] something kicking yes oh yes sir mr.
[2:00:38] Angel is that how it went
[2:00:42] no no evidence you're gonna have a son
[2:00:48] amen don't feel nothing no evidence do
[2:00:56] you have an evidence that there's gonna
[2:00:57] be a rapture
[2:00:58] you have an evidence amen you have faith
[2:01:02] my brother amen that's the only evidence
[2:01:05] you have you don't have any physical
[2:01:06] evidence Mary didn't have any feelings
[2:01:09] she didn't have anything going on but
[2:01:12] she was asked to believe the impossible
[2:01:13] so that new life could take place on the
[2:01:17] inside of her you're asked to believe
[2:01:19] that this word this old quaint archaic
[2:01:24] unscientific not culturally acceptable
[2:01:28] you're asked to believe this so that new
[2:01:30] life can take place on the inside of you
[2:01:34] believing the impossible yeah it should
[2:01:39] be impossible to believe that a guy like
[2:01:41] me a sinner all kinds of problems
[2:01:46] it should be impossible that a God would
[2:01:49] desire that I would be his child that I
[2:01:52] would be his servant but he did but he
[2:01:56] did and he desired you too and the angel
[2:01:59] comes to you and says here you go here's
[2:02:01] the Word of God no evidence but here it
[2:02:05] is are you gonna believe it
[2:02:07] what's your attitude see Mary had
[2:02:08] cultivated an attitude of faith her and
[2:02:11] Joseph had began to discuss the Word of
[2:02:13] God and they believe the Word of God so
[2:02:16] then an angel comes and she's ready to
[2:02:18] just say okay I believe the Word of God
[2:02:20] I'm not doubting it let it happen no
[2:02:22] evidence okay be it unto me according to
[2:02:24] your word and new life new life came
[2:02:29] forth so she's just an 18 year old girl
[2:02:32] living in a town she's scorned loli she
[2:02:35] probably felt like a pebble on the beach
[2:02:36] maybe sometimes you feel like I am just
[2:02:38] a pebble on the beach I am just a little
[2:02:40] piece of sand just nothing you ever feel
[2:02:45] that way that's what Mary really was
[2:02:48] Mary didn't come from West Palm Beach

[2:05:35] can walk around going yes I'm favored
[2:05:37] I'm favored y'all just know what's
[2:05:39] coming next I think that must be what it
[2:05:41] is because you get to you realize that
[2:05:43] I'm about to switch things and then kick
[2:05:45] you in the teeth because you know that
[2:05:47] marry that highly favored of the Lord
[2:05:49] you know she she she believed the word
[2:05:52] she said be it unto me according to thy
[2:05:54] word new life took place and then a few
[2:05:59] months later a new life is was taking
[2:06:01] place and a few months after that new
[2:06:04] life is is taking place she's highly
[2:06:09] favored
[2:06:10] and there she is you know you know she
[2:06:14] believed the word it kind of changed her
[2:06:16] walk just a little bit you know suddenly
[2:06:19] he sees she's forgive me sisters I'm
[2:06:24] probably killing that but you know but
[2:06:28] believe in the word changed the way she
[2:06:30] walked but the more the word in her
[2:06:34] begins to mature the more she began to
[2:06:38] change how she walked amen the more the
[2:06:44] Lord begins to mature in your life the
[2:06:46] more you believe the impossible the more
[2:06:48] it's gonna change how you walk the
[2:06:50] things that you used to do you're not
[2:06:51] doing them anymore I used to bend down
[2:06:53] and pick those things up but I don't I
[2:06:55] don't bend down anymore that's just too
[2:06:59] hard I can't change is how she walks the
[2:07:06] word should change how you walk hey men
[2:07:10] all in a C and as the word begins to
[2:07:13] change her life because remember she's
[2:07:16] highly favored of the Lord and so then
[2:07:18] she believes it new life is there it's
[2:07:19] absolutely what we want but it begins to
[2:07:21] change how she's walking and as it
[2:07:23] begins to change how she's walking there
[2:07:25] she is that the well and she's talking
[2:07:27] to her friends and then her friend's mom
[2:07:29] comes out and says Mezen and says you
[2:07:31] know oh I don't know some other names
[2:07:33] Sarah come here oh yes mother what do
[2:07:38] you want it's just like have you um
[2:07:41] notice something different about Mary
[2:07:43] that didn't notice yes mom I don't want
[2:07:47] you hanging around girls like that you
[2:07:50] know she doesn't have a husband and I
[2:07:53] don't want you coming under her bad
[2:07:55] influences I don't want you doing
[2:07:57] anything like what she's doing excuse me
[2:08:05] Mary here highly favored don't you want
[2:08:11] to be my friend because I'm highly
[2:08:13] favored of the Lord don't don't go
[2:08:15] anywhere near her okay you begin to shun
[2:08:18] her she's not your friend anymore you
[2:08:20] you can't be like her
[2:08:24] so she's highly favored Lord but nobody
[2:08:29] knows it why cuz it changed the way she
[2:08:35] walked when the word of God began to
[2:08:39] manifest in her life began to change the
[2:08:41] way you know I mean the things that she
[2:08:43] used to wear that that were kind of
[2:08:47] tight they just got to be too tight and
[2:08:52] she had to put something on that just
[2:08:55] wasn't so tight
[2:08:57] does anybody I mean you know it changed
[2:09:04] the way she walked what she wore once
[2:09:09] she couldn't wear anymore why because
[2:09:13] she was carrying something precious and
[2:09:17] if you're carrying something precious oh
[2:09:19] my goodness it's inside what the
[2:09:22] precious thing is inside and you don't
[2:09:24] have to be like doll yourself up in all
[2:09:28] different kinds of ways and why cuz
[2:09:31] what's pressed you're already highly
[2:09:32] favored and I don't care how you want
[2:09:35] look that I want you to understand that
[2:09:37] the Word of God in your heart is more
[2:09:39] blessed and being favored having favor
[2:09:41] with God is better than anything else
[2:09:43] that you could ever desire so you just
[2:09:46] can just change the way you walk you can
[2:09:48] change the way you dress and if other
[2:09:50] people are saying no don't don't hang
[2:09:52] around them anymore I don't want you
[2:09:54] along around their influence and look
[2:09:56] don't try to change things so that you
[2:09:58] can have them come back
[2:10:03] they'll never until the God changes
[2:10:06] their eyes they'll never see what's
[2:10:08] inside of you and who cares what they
[2:10:11] see what's on the outside of you because
[2:10:14] those people have totally missed totally
[2:10:17] missed the event that happened totally
[2:10:20] missed that that supernatural that take
[2:10:23] that has taken place and when you
[2:10:25] believe God you've done something you've
[2:10:27] changed my life you've sent me an angel
[2:10:29] be it unto me according to your word new
[2:10:31] life begins to take place you begin to
[2:10:33] mature in that it begins to change the
[2:10:35] way you walk and change the way you
[2:10:37] dress change the way you live and
[2:10:38] Friends that you wants head begin saying
[2:10:41] you are weird you are wrong you are you
[2:10:44] know you know what you are you're a
[2:10:46] hate-filled bigot in that in that what
[2:10:52] we are church I mean in that what they
[2:10:55] say just a bunch of hate you know uh you
[2:10:58] you you hate me because the way I dress
[2:10:59] that's not what I said at all you're a
[2:11:03] bigot you you think that some people
[2:11:05] dress you know better than others well
[2:11:07] you know if that's what a big it is then
[2:11:09] I guess so but it ain't me it's God's
[2:11:13] Word he tells us how to live and it's
[2:11:20] for our good and so they begin to look
[2:11:25] at you and think you're a hateful bigot
[2:11:27] because you're a Christian and you you
[2:11:29] you don't tell them that their truth is
[2:11:31] just as good as your truth because
[2:11:33] that's ridiculous but you realize that
[2:11:37] this word is truth and so they begin to
[2:11:40] pull away from you they begin to shun
[2:11:42] you that you begin to find that the
[2:11:44] friends you once had you don't have
[2:11:46] anymore and you know but you know Mary I
[2:11:48] mean if we're talking about the Blessed
[2:11:51] Virgin Mary here of course Mary reacts
[2:11:55] to that the same way any devout
[2:11:59] Christian would react you know my
[2:12:01] friends all hate me now they all think
[2:12:02] that literally I'm a prostitute now and
[2:12:05] they don't want anything they actually
[2:12:06] think I'm evil when actually everything
[2:12:08] about me is just the Word of God coming
[2:12:11] forth you know but they think I'm evil
[2:12:13] for it and
[2:12:14] they all hate me for it and but you know
[2:12:17] what
[2:12:17] I am the Blessed Virgin Mary and that
[2:12:21] doesn't bother me a bit
[2:12:24] you're kidding you're kidding yourself
[2:12:27] it hurts it's hard it was hard for her
[2:12:31] there may have been times and there
[2:12:33] really was times that she just she just
[2:12:35] wanted to get to a normal spot you know
[2:12:37] this this this change that happened her
[2:12:39] and this man what a wild ride she went
[2:12:42] on you know down to Bethlehem and away
[2:12:44] to Egypt and suddenly events were taking
[2:12:46] place changing faster than she could
[2:12:48] even feel to react to him and maybe at
[2:12:52] some point in time it got to a placement
[2:12:54] you know can Oh Lord I just kind of want
[2:12:56] to live a normal life here you know
[2:12:58] you've you've really changed a lot for
[2:13:01] me so she wasn't looked upon his blessed
[2:13:04] she wasn't looked upon as highly favored
[2:13:08] now but she came to a place then and
[2:13:13] imagine how she must have felt you know
[2:13:15] through all of these trials that she
[2:13:17] went to but she knew that as things
[2:13:19] matured those evidences finally came and
[2:13:22] you're gonna have evidences you know
[2:13:23] okay they're really they really hated me
[2:13:25] now but I can see God doing something in
[2:13:27] my life but it got to a point point that
[2:13:30] there Mary is and Joseph in there back
[2:13:33] in Jesus is 12 and they come to the
[2:13:35] temple and you know they have the
[2:13:37] sacrifice and then they leave and Jesus
[2:13:39] is there in the temple and they can't
[2:13:40] find him and then they go back and
[2:13:42] they're searching in three days later
[2:13:43] they they find him in the temple with
[2:13:45] the with the scribes and and teaching
[2:13:48] and and things like that and so what
[2:13:51] does she come and she says you know Luke
[2:13:54] 2 verse 48 when they saw him they were
[2:13:55] amazed his mother said unto him son why
[2:13:57] hast thou dealt with us behold thy
[2:14:00] father and I have sought thee sorrowing
[2:14:01] he said unto them how is it that ye
[2:14:03] sought me wist ye not that I must be
[2:14:04] about my father's business you see
[2:14:06] sometimes we just want normal you know
[2:14:09] we get a little callous to the
[2:14:11] supernatural to the things happening in
[2:14:12] our lives and we just Lord can it just
[2:14:14] be normal for a literally can it just be
[2:14:15] me and Joseph in Jesus and we kind of
[2:14:17] have a normal family for just a little
[2:14:19] bit you didn't sign up to be normal
[2:14:23] can I say this way you didn't sign up to
[2:14:25] be just natural you signed up for
[2:14:28] supernatural things to take place in
[2:14:30] your life but it's been so long I mean
[2:14:34] that prophecy yeah it's been so long
[2:14:36] it's been a long time for Mary gonna be
[2:14:38] it's been a long time we've waited not
[2:14:40] seven hundred years about seven hundred
[2:14:43] years as it was for Mary but two
[2:14:44] thousand years brother Trevor two
[2:14:47] thousand years Jesus told us he was
[2:14:48] coming back about two thousand years ago
[2:14:53] about two thousand just start counting
[2:14:58] you know one day we're gonna be here a
[2:15:00] while it's a long time maybe sometimes
[2:15:05] as we're waiting for that to happen we
[2:15:08] just kind of want things to be normal we
[2:15:10] don't want people to despise this we
[2:15:12] don't want you we just want normal but
[2:15:17] the Word of God but the Menem says
[2:15:18] corrects that error brother branham say
[2:15:21] says i want you to say god how thankful
[2:15:23] we are that our religion is not false
[2:15:25] how could you accept signs and wonders
[2:15:27] and say that your religion is no more
[2:15:29] than mohammedans the Muhammadans have a
[2:15:32] psychology and teaching they're all
[2:15:33] bible buddha does and all of these but
[2:15:35] this proves christianity is the truth
[2:15:38] proves then that if these things are
[2:15:40] true christianity unbelievers are
[2:15:42] condemned to doom to die without
[2:15:44] repentance so every sinner repent of
[2:15:46] your sins you may go to church but if
[2:15:48] you're not a believer one hundred
[2:15:49] percent the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:15:51] resting on you you get right with God
[2:15:53] tonight I want you to I want to tell you
[2:15:56] Church these things are true and it
[2:15:57] doesn't matter the time delay doesn't
[2:15:59] matter
[2:16:00] it didn't matter in the days of Mary and
[2:16:02] it doesn't matter in your day that it's
[2:16:05] going to happen that this is truth and
[2:16:07] we know it's truth and and there's just
[2:16:10] you know look if you're gonna if you're
[2:16:13] gonna run away from this if you're gonna
[2:16:15] run away from this it has nothing to do
[2:16:17] with truth for you you could people want
[2:16:20] to say that well it's not true it's not
[2:16:21] this it's not that no you just don't
[2:16:23] want it just go ahead and admit it to
[2:16:26] yourself right now I just don't want
[2:16:28] that because you can't unsee the things
[2:16:31] that we talked about in that Sunday
[2:16:32] School class if you see those you can't
[2:16:34] unsee those things you it just it just
[2:16:36] it's plain it
[2:16:37] obvious why cuz its truth its truth god
[2:16:41] vindicating it that is the truth and so
[2:16:43] so realize that it if you're saying look
[2:16:46] I want truth man I I just want to know
[2:16:48] what's true well you know I I told my
[2:16:52] brother-in-law I said well look here
[2:16:54] you've been searching for truth and he
[2:16:57] gave me this book about from this
[2:16:58] atheist you know he's like you oughta
[2:16:59] you know you ought to try reading this
[2:17:01] you know you maybe you should search for
[2:17:02] - truth - I said okay give me this
[2:17:04] atheist book by Richard Dawkins oh yeah
[2:17:07] Richard Dawkins yeah he's one of the
[2:17:08] good ones right I mean he's like yeah I
[2:17:09] mean this guy's really an atheist you
[2:17:11] know he's like you know prophetic
[2:17:13] atheist you know I mean he's the you
[2:17:15] know he's the man he's the Evangelist of
[2:17:19] evangelists of atheist evangelism right
[2:17:22] you know the religion of atheism this
[2:17:24] guy is the premier guy yeah let me read
[2:17:28] his book and I got about halfway through
[2:17:29] it and I just he was just so whiny that
[2:17:32] I just
[2:17:33] wasn't it I just couldn't see what he
[2:17:35] was saying but it was just like look
[2:17:36] this dude has issues I mean he's just
[2:17:38] he's as whiny and I just can't take any
[2:17:40] more of his drivel at least be happy
[2:17:43] about what you don't believe so I I gave
[2:17:51] my brother-in-law gave him this book I
[2:17:54] said look you know I gave him case for
[2:17:55] Christ he knows the message I wasn't
[2:17:57] gonna throw a message book at him aside
[2:17:58] he knows that so look there's case for
[2:18:01] Christ you're just just the truth that
[2:18:03] Christ is real there's there's no reason
[2:18:06] not to believe in Jesus Christ and and
[2:18:09] that's another sermon I could preach
[2:18:10] that I'd love to preach but we're not
[2:18:11] going to but you know how just how true
[2:18:14] the New Testament is and that you can
[2:18:16] believe it and if you can believe the
[2:18:17] New Testament you can believe the Old
[2:18:18] Testament and there's just there's
[2:18:19] really more reason to believe that Jesus
[2:18:20] Christ lived died and rose again then
[2:18:22] there is to believe that Julius Caesar
[2:18:24] ever walked the face of this earth and
[2:18:26] that's that that is from just a learning
[2:18:30] like archaeological standpoint so so
[2:18:36] anyway I said look it you know you're
[2:18:38] searching for truth this guy was
[2:18:40] searching for truth - maybe you should
[2:18:42] read his book sat on the Shelf because
[2:18:45] it was nothing about truth he wants to
[2:18:48] say that you you wanna say I'm searching
[2:18:49] for truth and but
[2:18:50] never read this well you're searching in
[2:18:53] all the wrong places and some at some
[2:18:55] point in time we realized you're not
[2:18:56] really searching for truth you just
[2:18:59] don't want it you just want it my way
[2:19:05] now brother Branham says now if this is
[2:19:07] what we have here Paul was saying this
[2:19:10] to his Hebrew audience how should we
[2:19:11] neglect this great salvation he says now
[2:19:14] they didn't have tape recorders today
[2:19:15] like we got here but they had scribes
[2:19:17] who was sitting there taking it down
[2:19:18] just as Paul was preaching it and that's
[2:19:20] what it is right here we're getting it
[2:19:21] by tape recorders these tapes go around
[2:19:23] the world to see to show it at its truth
[2:19:25] our religion is not in vain it's
[2:19:27] absolutely the resin resurrected Lord
[2:19:29] Jesus Christ same thing now we mustn't
[2:19:32] neglect it see Mary wasn't neglecting
[2:19:35] these prophecies in Isaiah no and we
[2:19:38] shouldn't be neglecting this in our
[2:19:41] daily lives we should not be neglecting
[2:19:43] this we should be listening if God saw
[2:19:47] fit to record that seventh angel we
[2:19:49] should be listening to that well that
[2:19:51] should be that should be part of our
[2:19:52] lives there's coming something he's
[2:19:55] telling us about it how you think about
[2:20:00] Mary you think like how maybe she would
[2:20:02] have like you know a month later to just
[2:20:05] have heard what that angel said again to
[2:20:06] just play it back what did he say again
[2:20:08] now well how did he say this was gonna
[2:20:09] happen what about this what about that
[2:20:11] and she probably wished she would have
[2:20:12] had it but you've got it what time okay
[2:20:17] 10 to 1 right and that would that says
[2:20:19] all right let me try to bring this to a
[2:20:21] close but the book of James says what is
[2:20:24] your life remember the salutation came
[2:20:27] to Mary and she begins to ponder it and
[2:20:29] go what is this why what is this so what
[2:20:31] is your life James says go to now you
[2:20:34] that say Tim today or tomorrow we will
[2:20:36] go into such a city and continue there a
[2:20:38] year and buy and sell and get gain
[2:20:39] whereas you know not what shall be on
[2:20:41] the morrow for what is your life it is
[2:20:43] even a vapor that appeareth for a little
[2:20:45] time and then vanisheth away for that
[2:20:47] you ought to say if the Lord will we
[2:20:49] shall live and do this or that but now
[2:20:50] he rejoice in your boastings all such
[2:20:52] rejoicing as evil therefore to him that
[2:20:54] knoweth to do good and do with it not to
[2:20:56] him it is sin so what is your life
[2:20:59] because you've come you're here in the
[2:21:01] service near you're being asked to
[2:21:04] think about yourself in the grand scheme
[2:21:07] of eternity you're being asked to think
[2:21:09] about is there or is there not a an
[2:21:13] event that is coming and soon soon
[2:21:15] coming that is coming to take us away in
[2:21:18] a supernatural way so Who am I where am
[2:21:23] i what is my life in context of this you
[2:21:26] know it's we're here we're here at the
[2:21:27] end of the year look back over 2018 what
[2:21:30] have you done what is it about why am i
[2:21:32] standing here why am I sitting here this
[2:21:34] morning what is my life I'm hearing
[2:21:36] these things is it true why am I here
[2:21:41] let me ask you a question how many of
[2:21:44] you can tell me the name of your
[2:21:45] great-grandfather three four five your
[2:21:56] great-great grandfather that's pretty
[2:21:59] good okay some some people have done
[2:22:02] some ancestry.com you know it's the only
[2:22:06] way I could tell you but most of you
[2:22:09] can't tell me a great-grandfather that
[2:22:13] lived like a hundred years ago they
[2:22:16] probably don't know where he was buried
[2:22:17] what his name was who his wife was I
[2:22:20] mean you know it was really critical
[2:22:22] that he lived on this earth for you
[2:22:24] really really critical kind of an
[2:22:29] important person for your life and you
[2:22:34] don't know his name or where he's buried
[2:22:40] guess what the Lord tarries you're gonna
[2:22:46] be a great grandfather someday will they
[2:22:52] know well they know well they know where
[2:22:56] you're buried well they know your name
[2:22:58] you know people buy life insurance you
[2:23:01] know it's like well you know what's
[2:23:03] gonna have any when you die well I'm not
[2:23:04] really gonna die will you just bought
[2:23:05] life insurance well yeah I mean just
[2:23:07] protect my family you know what is your
[2:23:11] life what's the point what's the purpose
[2:23:15] what are you doing
[2:23:16] if you're not found in this you have no
[2:23:20] answers for that and James here is
[2:23:22] asking the question you don't know
[2:23:25] what's gonna happen tomorrow what's your
[2:23:26] life it's a vapor it appears for a
[2:23:28] little time vanish it away nobody knows
[2:23:30] your name where you're buried for that
[2:23:31] you ought to say if the Lord will we
[2:23:33] shall live and do this or that but he
[2:23:34] now rejoiced in all your postings and
[2:23:36] all such rejoicing is evil you know you
[2:23:40] guys you have hurricanes here and you
[2:23:42] recognize the power of nature we had an
[2:23:46] earthquake about 200 miles it was a 4
[2:23:49] number 4 on the Richter scale earthquake
[2:23:50] about 200 miles into Illinois from our
[2:23:53] house it felt like our house lifted up
[2:23:55] went like that and slammed back down and
[2:23:57] guess how big I felt I mean just like I
[2:24:01] can't get my fingers close enough
[2:24:03] together to recognize that we put so
[2:24:08] much emphasis on me Who I am
[2:24:10] and fail to realize what's going on
[2:24:12] around us fail to realize what the Word
[2:24:15] of God is doing in our midst fail to
[2:24:17] realize the supernatural element that is
[2:24:20] all around us and I'm not just trying to
[2:24:23] be you know super spiritual oh my it's
[2:24:24] all around you and but to recognize this
[2:24:30] said something this said something and
[2:24:33] it's going to happen and if I can do one
[2:24:35] thing this morning is to just put
[2:24:37] something just a little seed in your
[2:24:39] heart that says is this truth and if
[2:24:41] this is true then what's my
[2:24:43] responsibility to that truth what I'm
[2:24:46] asking you to believe is that God that
[2:24:48] with God nothing is impossible what I'm
[2:24:53] asking you to believe is that for your
[2:24:55] life that rapture that we're talking
[2:24:57] about that coming supernatural that's
[2:24:59] not impossible that it's going to happen
[2:25:02] to you that you should believe it'll
[2:25:03] happen to you now you should say believe
[2:25:05] being on to me according to your word
[2:25:07] I'll change the way I walk I'll change
[2:25:11] the way I dress I don't care I'm
[2:25:13] thankful that I'm favored enough to hear
[2:25:15] the word of God
[2:25:16] and say be it unto me according
[2:25:18] - the word for with God nothing shall be
[2:25:21] impossible and I'm getting out of here
[2:25:27] so I hope that as you're eating lunch
[2:25:29] today cuz you're probably all starting
[2:25:31] to think about lunch and if you weren't
[2:25:33] you're not you are now and you know says
[2:25:38] you're chewing what is my life
[2:25:44] am I here for a cheeseburger
[2:25:47] I mean I'm eating the cheeseburger right
[2:25:48] now but is that what it's about
[2:25:50] I mean is it about cheeseburgers or is
[2:25:53] it about something else because I can
[2:25:56] eat a cheeseburger today and tomorrow
[2:25:57] I'm gonna forget and the next day I can
[2:25:59] eat a cheeseburger and is that what it's
[2:26:02] about is just sitting here going the
[2:26:03] thing and doing that and doing this and
[2:26:05] or is it because there's something
[2:26:08] supernatural that's going on oh I I
[2:26:11] don't I don't have the time this morning
[2:26:13] I preach too long already can I can I
[2:26:18] just I just real quick I want them Hosea
[2:26:21] and I know I'm kind of skipping around
[2:26:24] here but Hosea chapter 6 and verse 1 and
[2:26:30] 2 now this is a prophecy - Israel come
[2:26:33] and let us return of the Lord for he
[2:26:34] hath torn and will heal us
[2:26:35] he had smitten he will bind us up after
[2:26:37] two days he will revive us in the third
[2:26:41] day he will raise us up and we shall
[2:26:44] live in his sight now this prophecy of
[2:26:47] Hosea speaking to the Israelites is in
[2:26:50] 780 BC we know that a day on with us or
[2:26:55] a day with the Lord is a thousand years
[2:26:57] to us right okay so he says two days he
[2:27:00] will revive us in the third day he will
[2:27:02] raise us up 780 BC this prophecy goes
[2:27:06] forth with a time element now and if we
[2:27:08] if we can understand it correctly we
[2:27:10] could always be wrong and have some
[2:27:12] things wrong but 780 BC 2018 I can't do
[2:27:17] that math but let's see here 2017 when I
[2:27:20] wrote that was 27 97 now of course we
[2:27:25] can do 360 day calculation and find out
[2:27:28] that it's two hundred two thousand eight
[2:27:29] hundred and twenty-five well what does
[2:27:31] that tell us
[2:27:32] but we're within 200 years of Israel
[2:27:36] being revived and we'll talk about that
[2:27:37] more on Monday but but we're within 200
[2:27:40] years and it didn't say after the third
[2:27:42] day he shall raise us up know this
[2:27:44] prophecy that Hosea gave to the
[2:27:45] Israelites was after two days he'll rise
[2:27:47] us up in the third day in the third day
[2:27:50] which day are we in if a day with God as
[2:27:53] a thousand years to us and worth two
[2:27:57] thousand eight hundred twenty-five years
[2:27:59] into it we are in the third day the
[2:28:04] third day doesn't have much left there's
[2:28:06] just a little bit you think well that's
[2:28:08] just pretty obscure you know you can you
[2:28:10] could say you could come to me and say
[2:28:11] well that's pretty obscure prophecy
[2:28:13] brother Trevor it's like okay let me
[2:28:15] give you Daniel let me give you Daniels
[2:28:17] vision yeah you know well how many do
[2:28:20] you want how many of you want cuz I can
[2:28:24] I can lay them down if you want me to
[2:28:26] you know we could be here for another
[2:28:28] three hours and then you know be
[2:28:29] thinking about dinner too and lunch and
[2:28:31] I'm not gonna do that to you
[2:28:33] but how many do you want that I could
[2:28:36] take this Bible and I could show you so
[2:28:39] many ways that we are so close to the
[2:28:42] end and this is just one of them where
[2:28:45] the Bible has hey you know we'd look at
[2:28:47] Daniels vision man you know okay
[2:28:50] Babylonians then the Medes and Persians
[2:28:52] then the Greeks then the Romans and then
[2:28:54] you know that all happened before any of
[2:28:56] that you know that it was all prophesied
[2:28:57] before any of that actually happened
[2:28:59] it's like boom Bible's true deny it and
[2:29:01] I mean nobody denies that that that
[2:29:04] prophecy absolutely came to him to pass
[2:29:07] nobody there's so much so many ways that
[2:29:11] we show this Bible is absolutely true
[2:29:13] shows us history is you know how God has
[2:29:16] just shown what history was gonna happen
[2:29:18] before it even happened
[2:29:19] oh my and we're here we have another
[2:29:21] prophecy saying within two hundred years
[2:29:23] now I know I'm not gonna live to be 200
[2:29:25] you know for another 200 years but it's
[2:29:27] within the third day it isn't after the
[2:29:29] third day it's within the third day
[2:29:31] guess where we are
[2:29:33] guess where we are within the third day
[2:29:38] Church there's a coming supernatural
[2:29:42] as it came to Mary though many around
[2:29:46] Mary may have doubted it because 700
[2:29:49] years oh my here we are today having
[2:29:53] those same conversations maybe not

[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:33] in the manger of my heart
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:46] I mean appreciate brother Trevor just I
[2:34:55] thought it was very very fitting just to
[2:35:01] kind of come in on the end of the
[2:35:03] sermons that the Lord had given us about
[2:35:05] nothing being impossible and just the
[2:35:10] angle you know of you know looking at
[2:35:13] Mary and how she had to believe God for
[2:35:17] producing Christ's right and here we are
[2:35:21] in an age or a time but we have to also
[2:35:25] believe God for a change of the body I
[2:35:28] mean one day you could just be driving
[2:35:31] down the street or or laying in the bed
[2:35:33] or you know whatever and a change takes
[2:35:36] place in your body and you know you
[2:35:39] wonder how could this happen I mean and
[2:35:42] oftentimes we make so many preparations
[2:35:44] and plans for so many other things in
[2:35:46] life but we're not making preparations
[2:35:48] and plans for this body change frame
[2:35:52] when we come into true revelation
[2:35:55] understanding as to what God has called
[2:35:57] us to and I love the way brother Trevor
[2:36:00] put that Mary very highly favored but
[2:36:03] the people despised her right the people
[2:36:07] looked at are a little different than
[2:36:08] the way God looked at her and and I'm
[2:36:10] gonna tell you something when you've
[2:36:11] really come into a man a true
[2:36:14] relationship with Christ
[2:36:17] then you should see people despising you
[2:36:19] as well can I say it this way if
[2:36:23] everybody accepts you something wrong
[2:36:28] those closest to you they still accept
[2:36:31] you something wrong but but but when
[2:36:34] you're really coming to relationship
[2:36:36] with Christ people don't want that
[2:36:38] everybody don't want that only very few
[2:36:40] don't want that so when you when you
[2:36:43] find that everybody just got no problem
[2:36:45] with you something wrong somewhere I
[2:36:46] remember as he was saying that you know
[2:36:49] Mary got a new walk her dressing changed
[2:36:52] a clothes change when a winner when a
[2:36:55] when a woman is pregnant a cool suppose
[2:36:57] it changed and I don't know I know
[2:36:58] nowadays people don't want to admit that
[2:37:00] they pregnant the clothes that they wear
[2:37:04] show that to try to show that you're not
[2:37:06] pregnant we see something different you
[2:37:08] pregnant
[2:37:09] you don't need to dress like that might
[2:37:11] as well say man all right and when
[2:37:14] you've been pregnant with the Word of
[2:37:16] God you don't need to dress like that
[2:37:20] you don't need to act like that you need
[2:37:23] to talk like that if there's a change
[2:37:25] really taking place on the inside things
[2:37:28] should be reflected on the outside
[2:37:30] I remember the prophets and say as
[2:37:33] Christ was being formed in Mary so
[2:37:37] that's when the persecution set in and
[2:37:40] if Christ has been formed in you some
[2:37:44] persecution just said him I was blessed
[2:37:51] today absolutely blessed and I'm
[2:37:57] expecting the coming supernatural to
[2:38:00] happen to me because nothing absolutely
[2:38:02] nothing is impossible with God
[2:38:07] praise the Lord can we just stand and
[2:38:10] sing just the course of the song in my
[2:38:12] life Lord be glorified in my life Lord
[2:38:17] be glorified with your hands lift it say
[2:38:19] say
[2:38:21] him
[2:38:25] would be glorified me glorified be
[2:38:31] clarified
[2:38:33] grrowph I'd say
[2:38:38] my
[2:38:40] Oh
[2:38:42] if we were
[2:38:44] we qualified
[2:38:48] today come on say in my life Lord
[2:38:55] my my
[2:38:59] low
[2:39:04] got a big old fine
[2:39:12] in my in my life

[2:39:21] yes today one more time everybody
[2:39:29] my life Lord
[2:39:38] yeah yeah give my life
[2:39:44] in my life
[2:39:49] whoa
[2:39:51] [Music]
[2:39:55] today
[2:39:58] allelujah father Dennis is truly our
[2:40:02] desire we say as Mary said you might not
[2:40:09] understand oh god that is suppose that
[2:40:13] people might not understand father
[2:40:15] how it is to happen it's never happened
[2:40:19] before
[2:40:20] Mary Mary looked at us she never even
[2:40:23] heard the term holy ghosts
[2:40:26] she never go in the church and heard
[2:40:28] that term before
[2:40:29] but the angel said the Holy Ghost will
[2:40:32] come upon you will overshadow you and
[2:40:34] he'll he'll cause this thing to come to
[2:40:36] pass maybe there are some things that
[2:40:38] our prophet has shared that we have
[2:40:39] never heard before the angel that God
[2:40:43] has sent to us in this hour we believe
[2:40:45] it Lord let us be like Mary let us say
[2:40:50] as she said be it unto me according to
[2:40:52] thy word I might not understand all
[2:40:56] these things but God I'm gonna yield
[2:40:57] myself to it and I'm gonna allow myself
[2:41:00] to be changed by the Word of God father
[2:41:05] maybe we've just been struggling we've
[2:41:07] been fighting in our minds with these
[2:41:10] things but Mary would have never
[2:41:12] produced Christ as she'd not come to a
[2:41:14] place of complete surrender and God will
[2:41:19] never
[2:41:21] never be able to participate in a
[2:41:23] rapture until we come to a place of
[2:41:26] complete surrender it's not about just
[2:41:30] going to church on Sunday but God we're
[2:41:33] living in an hour in a time where we can
[2:41:36] expect a body change and God help us to
[2:41:39] catch this by revelation
[2:41:41] don't let us miss what the spirit of
[2:41:43] what was trying to say to us today God
[2:41:47] we want we want to be ready we want to
[2:41:50] be ready when you come as we close them
[2:41:54] out this year God we are getting closer
[2:41:56] to your return and as as Mary that
[2:42:01] promise took 700 years before it was
[2:42:03] fulfilled
[2:42:04] 700 years maybe people say it's no way
[2:42:07] it's gonna happen but God yet it came to
[2:42:09] pass and now this second coming of the
[2:42:12] Lord we're we're beyond 2000 years well
[2:42:15] god we've know father that this is the
[2:42:17] hour this is the season and every day we
[2:42:20] wake up what we're getting closer and
[2:42:22] closer to it we heard brother Solomon
[2:42:25] kind of share that in the song service
[2:42:26] about us being closer and here brother
[2:42:29] Trevor comes out and speaks it in a
[2:42:30] sermon God you're trying to tell us
