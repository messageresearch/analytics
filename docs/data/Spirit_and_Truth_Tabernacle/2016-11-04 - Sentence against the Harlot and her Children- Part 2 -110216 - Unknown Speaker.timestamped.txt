[4:17] just blessed him as well in jesus thing
[4:20] we ask it amen amen praise or you can be
[4:25] seated just turn with me to Revelation
[4:34] chapter 2
[4:39] let's just read our scriptures here
[4:41] tonight as we
[4:43] proceed forward and the studying the
[4:46] five tier in church age and looking at
[4:49] the session the sentence against the
[4:52] harlot and the sentence against the
[4:54] harlot here revelation 2 verse 18
[5:13] the verse 18 says and unto the Angel of
[5:15] the Church and five tier write these
[5:19] things said the Sun God who hath his
[5:22] eyes like him to a flame of fire and his
[5:24] feet are like fine brass I know that
[5:27] word send charity and service faith and
[5:30] my patience and that works that lastly
[5:34] more than the first and when we went
[5:36] over that section brother Branham
[5:38] brought to our attention that just as
[5:40] believers good work should always come
[5:43] forth from believers but when you look
[5:46] at the scripture says I know that works
[5:48] in charity and service so we good works
[5:52] and good service should come from
[5:53] believers but if the works and the
[5:55] service is not done in love then it's
[5:58] not been received appropriately so as we
[6:02] serve the Lord we have to serve Him in
[6:04] love and love I know that works in
[6:07] charity service and faith my patience
[6:11] and my works and alas to be more than
[6:14] the first verse 20 says notwithstanding
[6:16] I have a few things against the again
[6:18] we've been talking about there are two
[6:22] churches that are identified here every
[6:24] time every age has a false church and a
[6:27] true church false violent of True Vine
[6:29] and when we looked at verse 19 he was
[6:32] actually talking to the true church but
[6:34] now when he when he brings out the
[6:37] rebuke then that's when he's talking to
[6:40] the foster to any time he's given a
[6:42] commendation or just something where
[6:45] he's shown appreciation is talking to
[6:47] the true believers but when he's given a
[6:50] rebuke he's talking to the false fire so
[6:53] here verse 20 notwithstanding I have a
[6:54] few things against thee because thou
[6:57] sufferest that woman Jezebel we call it
[7:00] herself a prophetess to teach and to
[7:02] seduce My servants to commit fornication
[7:04] and in this sense of the word
[7:07] fornication is idle
[7:09] to commit fornication and to eat they'd
[7:13] sacrifice unto idols and I gave her
[7:16] space to repent of her fornication as
[7:18] she repented not I'm behold I would cast
[7:22] her into a bed and then that commits
[7:25] adultery with her into Great Tribulation
[7:26] except they repent of their deeds and
[7:28] this is where we're getting our subject
[7:30] tonight the sentence against the harlot
[7:33] the verse 23 says and I would kill her
[7:36] children with death and all the churches
[7:41] shall know that I am he which searcheth
[7:43] the reins and hearts and I will give
[7:46] unto every one of you according to your
[7:50] works but unto you I say and I'm through
[7:54] the rest and five tier as many as have
[7:57] not this doctrine and which have not
[8:00] known the depths of Satan as they speak
[8:02] i will put upon you none other bird but
[8:07] that was that that which you have
[8:09] already hold fast till I come he that
[8:12] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[8:14] end to him when I get power over the
[8:17] nation's and he shall rule them with a
[8:20] rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter
[8:23] show that he broke in the shivers even
[8:25] as I received of my father and I will
[8:29] give him the morning star and he that
[8:33] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[8:36] saith unto the churches we're going to
[8:39] just kind of go forward here picked up
[8:41] where we left off on last week
[8:45] we just want to get right to the
[8:48] sentence against the harlot and will
[8:55] you have a little bit of reading that we
[8:56] want to do tonight from the scripture
[8:58] and I believe it would be helpful to us
[9:01] all right
[9:03] ok so we're focusing on this verse
[9:07] revelation 222 says behold I will cast
[9:10] her into a bed of them that commit
[9:12] adultery with or integrate tribulation
[9:15] except they repent of their deeds also
[9:18] the scripture says and I will kill her
[9:20] children with death and all the churches
[9:23] shall know that I am he which searcheth
[9:26] the reins and hearts and I would given
[9:29] to her every one of you according to
[9:31] your works let's just kind of look at a
[9:34] couple things here and think of what I'd
[9:37] like to do there was a quote that we
[9:41] read I'm the church age book with this
[9:44] this is on page 232 paragraph three in
[9:50] your church age foot
[9:56] and we'll just read that 232 paragraph
[10:03] three
[10:06] the Prophet says this this is at the end
[10:09] of the page there says uh what this
[10:11] woman has children and and she a
[10:17] if that is the case that she had
[10:20] children by her whoredoms then she must
[10:23] be burnt with fire as the word is saving
[10:25] like I brought to you all last week I
[10:27] just did a quick search on that as to
[10:30] what I felt for the brand I was
[10:31] referring to he didn't give the
[10:33] scripture reference but I just kind of
[10:34] felt that this was the scripture
[10:37] reference that was appropriate was
[10:38] executive 23 25 and if you had a chance
[10:41] to go back and read that you'll read
[10:43] about Jerusalem and Samaria his sisters
[10:48] that were committing a hoarder and verse
[10:51] 25 and actually talked about her being
[10:53] burnt with fire so I believe that's
[10:55] where brother branham's kind of bringing
[10:56] bringing that in it was representing you
[10:59] know the nation of Israel these two
[11:01] sisters Judah and Israel is representing
[11:03] them but here he says if that is the
[11:06] case that she had children by her
[11:08] hortons then she must be burnt with fire
[11:10] as the word has said that is exactly
[11:13] true that is her in for she will burn
[11:16] with fire her n is the lake of fire this
[11:22] is what the properties tell us that's
[11:24] the end of denominations a lot of people
[11:27] don't see that what they see at the
[11:28] beginning is that men they love me more
[11:30] they treat me better they they got more
[11:33] programs and what the message people got
[11:36] they they look at all of those things
[11:37] but they're not looking at the end lot
[11:41] looked at the plush Lance of Sodom and
[11:46] Gomorrah but he did not look at the end
[11:49] result of what we're going to happen to
[11:51] something do more because of the sin
[11:53] that was down there and unfortunately
[11:55] what we what we've done now is we've
[11:57] based our spiritual decisions on our
[12:01] feelings on our emotions don't ever do
[12:05] that church base your spiritual
[12:07] decisions on the Word of God a man
[12:11] that's the only thing that's not going
[12:13] to fill our emotions which
[12:14] change it changes like weather so the
[12:17] key here is that we got to look at what
[12:20] the end result denominational teaching
[12:22] will lead to tribulation that's just
[12:25] bottom line it does not have anything in
[12:27] it to get us ready for a rapture right
[12:29] it's going to lead to tribulation no
[12:31] matter how good the programs are it will
[12:33] lead us defibrillation anything
[12:35] organized is against God so we have to
[12:37] stay as far away from that and just stay
[12:40] with the word of God that's that's key
[12:42] important brother branham goes on the
[12:44] state is the stop and thing about these
[12:48] children for a moment a woman is the one
[12:50] out of whom the children come it is
[12:52] evident that this woman had children
[12:54] that came out of her but they did the
[12:56] same thing she did show me one church
[12:58] that ever came out of organization that
[13:00] didn't go right back into it there isn't
[13:02] one not one the Lutheran's came out and
[13:04] the organ and then organized right back
[13:06] and today they're there a hand in glove
[13:09] with this academic remove the methodist
[13:12] came out and they working I was right
[13:13] back the Pentecostals came out and they
[13:15] were organized right back there is going
[13:17] to be another coming out and praise God
[13:20] they won't organize back because they
[13:23] know the truth that group would be the
[13:25] bride of the last day I believe we are
[13:27] in the midst of fulfilling that
[13:28] statement even right now that group that
[13:31] this apart at another coming out but
[13:33] they won't go back they won't go back to
[13:37] organization because they know the truth
[13:39] that's he's talking to us thank God for
[13:42] that all right let's go on a little
[13:43] further here there were some key
[13:45] statements that we brought out last week
[13:48] here and I'll just kind of hit those
[13:51] again one thing here that brother
[13:55] branham brought
[14:03] I'll just go on organization is the
[14:07] product of the double correctors nickel
[14:10] Anton ism and Balaam ism and is
[14:12] propagated by the prophet of Jezebel and
[14:14] what we brought out on nickel activism
[14:17] and Valin ISM nickel Anton ISM is is the
[14:22] conquered lantee and you know there's
[14:25] many many churches out there that that's
[14:28] that's exactly what they've done is just
[14:30] completely conquered the laity the
[14:32] Catholic Church would have been the
[14:34] first one to start that off but there's
[14:35] there's many others I feel I know I'm
[14:39] not one particular denomination where
[14:42] the legatee is so subjective to the
[14:47] leadership is they have superintendent
[14:51] or bishop or somebody I don't know what
[14:52] the main title is but whatever decision
[14:55] that man makes maybe if he says at the
[15:00] when they go to their their conventions
[15:03] if he says I walked so and so at that
[15:06] church and I want this pastor the move I
[15:08] don't care how long that pastor been
[15:10] there he is moving right and and they
[15:13] just have complete control over over the
[15:16] congregation not allowing the Spirit of
[15:18] God and do anything most people I should
[15:20] feel like well if the bishop said it
[15:22] then the spirit must be leaving and they
[15:24] know it's political they know the thing
[15:26] is absolutely political but that that
[15:28] that spirit of nickel Anton ISM is there
[15:30] and God never intended for that to run
[15:32] his church never the other thing is
[15:34] Bailey mysm brother branham call this
[15:37] organization a product of the double
[15:39] corrupters oneness nicholas janis on the
[15:41] others bailey mysm and the beylin ism is
[15:43] go ahead and do it your way and what
[15:46] like i mentioned last week Baylen ism i
[15:49] think is even in the message now a lot
[15:51] of us look at this from you know maybe a
[15:54] woman preacher standpoint no matter how
[15:57] anointed she is God still never intended
[16:00] for going to preach that's not scripture
[16:01] you can't find that in the Bible but but
[16:04] nowadays in the message they're people
[16:06] like I said that believe a number of
[16:09] things they believe that that you don't
[16:12] need a fivefold ministry
[16:13] all right they believe that brother
[16:15] Brandon is there there pastor I don't
[16:18] see how that can be if God's called him
[16:20] home it can't be your pastor right he
[16:22] was your profit but he can't be a pastor
[16:24] right so there's a lot of these things
[16:26] that still that that stuff comes right
[16:28] on over into or people try to bring it
[16:31] over to the message but you know thank
[16:32] God we we go through stir Jake but we
[16:35] can fight against those things those are
[16:37] spirits that have tried to enter into
[16:39] the church and we have to stand against
[16:41] that brother Ramage that we have to
[16:43] withstand you know you know just just
[16:47] these things that kind of come in and
[16:49] it's and sometimes it's difficult you
[16:51] have to take a stand against some very
[16:52] dear people but you got to stay with the
[16:55] truth right you gotta stay the truth but
[16:57] here Bailey mysm is go ahead and do it
[16:59] your way even if it's against the word
[17:01] they gonna do it anyway right because
[17:03] that's what Balon did he heard God tell
[17:07] him no but he went down there anyway and
[17:09] did what he wanted to do and then he he
[17:11] suffer from that one of the scriptures
[17:13] that we read last week was Matthew 25
[17:16] verse 1 through 13 and that's talking
[17:19] about the the wives versions and the
[17:24] foolish virgins and and you know as you
[17:26] just kind of go back and look at that
[17:27] the scripture withstand very clearly
[17:30] that they took lamps but they didn't
[17:32] take oil with them and then it's at
[17:35] later on that the wise actually took oil
[17:37] in their lamps and when you know the
[17:39] bridegroom came in the crock came the
[17:42] midnight cry came they rubbed a rose
[17:44] Nick trimmed their lamps and you know
[17:46] you see that the the fuel is foolish
[17:47] virgins went an extra watch they hate
[17:49] our lamps have run out you know so give
[17:52] us a vol that was a lie they lampstand
[17:55] run out they never actually took oil
[17:57] they never took it they've never had it
[18:00] in the first place and when brother
[18:01] branham said is that that all
[18:03] represented the Holy Spirit so actually
[18:06] they've never had it in the first place
[18:08] it might have looked like they had it
[18:09] but they did not have the Holy Ghost in
[18:12] the first place praise the Lord that's
[18:14] that's really what we get out of that
[18:15] but here he goes on another statement he
[18:18] may hear there's going to be another
[18:20] coming out praise God they want
[18:21] organized
[18:22] back because they know the truth we
[18:24] thank God for that and this one says the
[18:27] spirit left the Pentecostals because
[18:31] they organized that's that's important
[18:34] the reason that the Pentecost is not
[18:37] where it used to be where it started is
[18:39] because they organized and the spirit
[18:42] left and I'll share with you all how the
[18:44] the Pentecostal church was birthed at a
[18:47] snoozer street with william see more and
[18:50] i mean just a mighty move the Spirit of
[18:53] God but yet with all of that they could
[18:55] not stop the division from coming
[18:57] between the blacks and whites the whites
[18:59] went with assemblies of god and the
[19:02] blacks went with Church of God in Christ
[19:04] right they could not stop that division
[19:06] so there's something wrong they both
[19:07] organized they organize the Spirit of
[19:10] God left amen and we're seeing the
[19:13] results of that today also the Prophet
[19:18] says everyone but the very elect will be
[19:20] deceived everyone but the very elect
[19:23] would be deceived I was talking with
[19:25] some brothers and you know they were
[19:28] telling me that that they weren't gonna
[19:33] support my meetings because I had a
[19:35] particular person here speaking they
[19:39] weren't going to support my meetings
[19:41] because of that they felt that that
[19:42] person might I guess seduce the people
[19:46] and now and you know and I say what
[19:50] brother you know the Bible say that the
[19:51] very elect can be deceived you know that
[19:54] right and I oh yeah that's a good point
[19:57] that's a good point but still he was
[19:59] supported right and the person that I
[20:02] had is just no way they would deceive
[20:06] anybody they was related to the Prophet
[20:08] so you know it's just it's kind of sad
[20:13] that people get this way but that's one
[20:14] thing that I got confidence and even if
[20:16] you ended up in a church because you
[20:19] were visiting or something like that I
[20:21] mean I think we mature enough that if we
[20:25] went to
[20:26] net went to visit a relative and we went
[20:29] to church with them that you weren't
[20:31] getting there and getting saved in one
[20:32] surface I hope you mature enough right
[20:35] if you're not I don't know what the same
[20:39] right but I hope that I mean you know
[20:41] you know sometimes we do some strange
[20:44] things no I can't go to church with no I
[20:46] can't go to trick you can go to church
[20:48] you you know enough to pick a dick thing
[20:50] going in and shout raise your hand
[20:53] saying man or something you know brother
[20:55] branham TARDIS that you get a bone just
[20:58] push it to the side and keep eating meat
[20:59] right so we know these things and we
[21:02] should be able to exercise that way by
[21:05] now right I say we should be able to do
[21:07] that by now but um but I tell you don't
[21:10] one thing you can be you can register
[21:12] now don't don't get me wrong I don't
[21:14] think anybody should intentionally try
[21:16] to bring somebody to deceive right I
[21:19] don't think that's that's going to be
[21:20] intentional you know you learn your
[21:23] lesson sometimes some from some people
[21:25] we've had different ones come and praise
[21:28] God we learned a lesson a man there is
[21:30] no invitation going out right Stan we
[21:33] want you back that's not happening
[21:35] praise the Lord hey man one time that's
[21:39] buddy the church on this thing but but
[21:43] that's you know we're not going to
[21:44] intentionally do that but I tell you
[21:46] what if something happened to slip in a
[21:48] slip by the very leg will not be
[21:51] deceived will not that's a promise from
[21:54] from Almighty God one other scriptures
[21:57] and we're going to hit this tonight
[21:58] revelation 13 13 18 brother branham
[22:00] brought that out in our reading and we
[22:03] want to try to touch on that tonight
[22:05] here again we're talking about the
[22:08] sentence against the harlot and
[22:14] there is in this scripture here says I
[22:18] will cast her into a bed and then that
[22:22] commits adultery with her into Great
[22:24] Tribulation except they repent of their
[22:25] deeds always remember the woman is type
[22:29] in the church and Scripture jazzy Belle
[22:32] type in the church in Scripture jazzy
[22:35] Belle according to this particular
[22:38] passage was a woman that would not
[22:40] repent you know she indicated if you go
[22:44] back and look at what Jezebel did and in
[22:48] Bible History back in the days of King
[22:50] Ahab he was married to just gonna marry
[22:52] her for political purposes you know desi
[22:56] Bell introduced idolatry into the nation
[23:01] of Israel not only introduced idolatry
[23:03] but she was killing the prophets killing
[23:06] anybody that uh that was standing for
[23:08] you know the one true God she would she
[23:11] would try to wipe them out try to get
[23:12] rid of that influence and you know so so
[23:16] what we're seeing here is that same
[23:18] spirit came into the Catholic Church
[23:20] right and they began to kind of kill
[23:23] anybody live with not agree with their
[23:24] teachers and they also brought in
[23:26] idolatry and false false teachers into
[23:29] the church so that same spirit or not
[23:31] and when we say it to her the sentence
[23:34] against the harlot we talk about the
[23:35] children that came from the harlot or
[23:37] the Bible also calls a degree
[23:40] thatthat's those of people that those
[23:42] are churches that born out of the
[23:44] Catholic Church right so they might have
[23:46] come out but if they went right back
[23:48] into organization then like mother like
[23:50] daughter that's what we saw happening
[23:53] amen Lutheran's would be considered in
[23:56] that the Baptist would be considering
[23:58] that Pentecostals be considering that
[23:59] any private organizer went right back
[24:01] into that same system that came out of
[24:03] that's that's that's that's what we're
[24:05] talking about and I mentioned last week
[24:07] there was a time of my life I remember
[24:10] you got a bunch of preachers together
[24:11] you could always identify the Catholic
[24:14] priests always because he he's the only
[24:16] one that had that collar next thing you
[24:18] know you start seeing some of the
[24:20] Lutheran's and the Episcopalians do
[24:21] same thing and before you know it the
[24:23] Pentecost will start doing the exact
[24:26] same thing Methodist Baptist all they've
[24:28] got the same college man you can't tell
[24:31] if a Catholic or what you don't know
[24:33] what the difference is just by looking
[24:35] at right so it shows that they went
[24:37] right back into the same system that
[24:40] they came out of that's what those
[24:42] things show evident just even in the way
[24:44] that they dress it's evident brother
[24:48] branham said this and let me just see
[24:50] something here yeah I think there's a
[24:53] quote here that I'm going to a couple
[24:55] quotes that i'm going to read but says
[24:58] now there there was virgins that went
[25:01] out to meet him and the foolish virgins
[25:03] now did not have all in their lamp but
[25:06] they had everything else they were clean
[25:08] they believed in Christ they preached
[25:11] the word that they believe their dump
[25:13] that they believe their denomination
[25:15] would let them preach they preached that
[25:17] the second coming to sacrifice to
[25:19] atonement they believe they have all
[25:21] those core beliefs and we talked about
[25:23] that you have to call people Christians
[25:25] because they subscribe to certain
[25:27] Christian beliefs of three off the top
[25:30] of my head are Jesus died and rose again
[25:32] Jesus is the savior of all man you know
[25:37] all mankind he was born of a virgin you
[25:40] know everybody as Christians we all
[25:42] believe that but that you know still
[25:44] that we could make it be what we call
[25:46] Christians of the flesh but Christians
[25:48] the spirit don't believe all the words
[25:49] not just that they're gonna go with the
[25:51] entire work all right I want to read a
[25:54] quick quote to own this one yeah this is
[26:03] out of your church Jake's book as well
[26:05] page 2 30 3 paragraph 2 i'm going to
[26:11] just read to a certain point or a stop
[26:15] he says what would be the punishment of
[26:18] the harlot and her children well it's
[26:20] going to be twofold first he said I
[26:22] would cast her into a bed according to
[26:24] the last part of verse 22 it will be a
[26:27] bed of tribulation or the Great
[26:29] Tribulation that is exactly what Jesus
[26:32] said in Matthew 25 1 through 13 there
[26:35] were ten virgins five were wise and five
[26:38] were foolish to five wives have oil the
[26:41] Holy Spirit but the other five did not
[26:43] when the cry went up behold the
[26:45] bridegroom cometh the five foolish had
[26:47] to run seeking oil why the five wise
[26:50] virgins went into the marriage the five
[26:53] that remained outside were left to the
[26:55] Great Tribulation that is what will
[26:56] happen to all who do not go up in the
[26:59] rapture that is what will come upon the
[27:01] harlot and her daughters denominational
[27:05] teaching is going to lead people to a
[27:06] tribulation bottom line brother branham
[27:10] say wrapped in faith lies in the books
[27:12] and tapes that's where we find wrapped
[27:14] in faith so if a person not preaching
[27:17] from the books and tapes they will not
[27:19] get people ready for a rapture bottom
[27:22] line a man church I mean you know we
[27:26] have to just put it very plain like that
[27:28] of it if it's found in the books and
[27:29] tapes that's what we got to bring to the
[27:31] people to get them ready for a ratchet
[27:33] if that's not being presented it will
[27:35] lead people to tribulation here amen
[27:38] listen secondly it says that he will
[27:41] kill them with death or as a literal
[27:43] translation it says let them be put to
[27:46] death with death this is a strange thing
[27:48] we might say let a man be put to death
[27:50] by hanging or by electrocution or some
[27:53] other way but this says let them be put
[27:55] to death by death death itself is a
[27:58] cause of their death alright I'm going
[28:01] to skip down here to the next quote okay
[28:05] actually just that I just read that
[28:07] that's what that was in the slot all
[28:09] right let's go on to the next up the
[28:11] next slide here
[28:19] okay there's a pretty significant quote
[28:22] that I want to read on this one so again
[28:27] this it says I will kill her children
[28:29] with death and all all the churches
[28:34] shall know that I am he which searcheth
[28:36] the reins and hearts and I would give
[28:37] unto every one of you according to your
[28:41] works now that little picture that's up
[28:45] there in the top right corner just says
[28:47] Jezebel had a daughter and her name was
[28:50] a failure so when the scribd traction
[28:54] says that I will kill her children with
[28:56] death this is a direct type to Jezebel
[29:01] having a daughter and the Catholic
[29:02] Church having daughters write and direct
[29:05] comparison so when you look at up
[29:08] Jezebel with and that's I found that
[29:12] even just even when you look at it from
[29:15] from from the scripture the prophet
[29:18] Elijah had to deal with jazzy now Elijah
[29:24] dealt with jazzy Belle right he Liza
[29:30] which is a type of us Elijah would be
[29:33] representing brother branham's ministry
[29:35] but Elijah represents the bride Elijah
[29:38] had to deal with a failure Jezebel's
[29:42] door guess what that shows how we have
[29:45] to do with denominations right brother
[29:48] branham doe he dealt with the Catholic
[29:50] Church right at the root and even even
[29:52] dealt with the dumb denominations but we
[29:53] had to deal with it even a little bit
[29:55] more you know an hour day because we're
[29:57] seeing the fruit of what the Prophet
[29:59] talked about right here in our midst
[30:01] right so a failure if the Bible says
[30:05] that I will kill her children with death
[30:06] and all the churches shall know that I
[30:08] am he which searcheth the reins and
[30:10] hearts and I would give unto every one
[30:12] of you according to your works I wanted
[30:14] to I want you to just kind of go back
[30:15] and just remember that the weight of the
[30:19] failure died right you know there's a
[30:23] failure there was a time where
[30:26] her she action she wasn't even supposed
[30:28] to be the leader or the ruler her son
[30:32] was killed and when she found out that
[30:34] her son died she went and started
[30:36] killing all the king's sons and and
[30:39] anybody that was a threat to actually
[30:42] take over the throne she went to kill
[30:43] off all the king's sons there was one
[30:45] little boy that they hit he was a little
[30:48] baby at the time that was born and they
[30:51] hit him inside the church inside the
[30:53] temple and that what was hidden inside
[30:57] that temple for six years six years and
[31:00] you know the question be like well how
[31:01] come she didn't know that that boy was
[31:03] in the church I come see Luna what an
[31:06] answer is that she never went to church
[31:08] she was serving false gods so she was
[31:11] never in the church she was serving bail
[31:13] right so she was going to bells church
[31:15] but not going to the we're Jehovah's she
[31:18] wasn't there so here this boy was in the
[31:22] church six years in the seventh year
[31:24] they decided to the preset the time
[31:27] decided to you know introduce this point
[31:30] he got all the people i mean it kind of
[31:33] hit him away didn't even let the people
[31:34] know but in the seventh year he start
[31:36] bringing i think he kind of waited for
[31:38] the people to get frustrated with with a
[31:40] failure and maybe might might have start
[31:42] listening to some of their complaints
[31:44] and things like that and it's because
[31:46] sometimes you just gotta wait for people
[31:48] to get frustrated before you really get
[31:49] in there start talking to him alright
[31:51] but maybe wait for them to get
[31:52] frustrated so you know what I've got I'm
[31:54] going to show them something they didn't
[31:56] know that this would this exists there
[31:58] only a few people knew but imma show
[31:59] them say we got the we got a king here
[32:01] we've got to keep putting up with a
[32:02] failure and they pre probably total the
[32:04] story what happened with this board how
[32:06] he'd been raised in the temp all the
[32:07] Houston are we ready to bring them out
[32:09] and it was in this boy's seventh year
[32:11] seventh year that they were going to
[32:13] introduce him to the people they were
[32:16] going to anoint him as king and when
[32:19] they did that they're known him as can
[32:20] you become a failure running into the
[32:21] house of the garden lot of Bible say she
[32:24] she ripped her clothes in front of
[32:28] everybody and I think about that what
[32:30] type of lady is that that will rip her
[32:32] clothes in the house of God in front of
[32:34] all the men
[32:35] tell you something about her write it
[32:37] tell you a lot about her but she ripped
[32:39] a cruel to start yelling I treason
[32:40] treason treason well the the priesthood
[32:43] already said look whoever you know ever
[32:46] catches her take out the outside right
[32:48] outside the house I mean I outside the
[32:50] house of Lord and kill and make sure she
[32:52] she's killed a failure was was killed
[32:55] just like the Bible's props thought I
[32:57] would kill her children with death
[32:59] alright a failure was killed pulled out
[33:02] of the church and actually was killed by
[33:05] the people right and and anybody was
[33:08] following tell you they also were killed
[33:10] so the priests they went and got the
[33:12] free side of the temple they killed them
[33:14] to the ones that was serving veil but I
[33:16] you know the thing of it is is that I
[33:17] when I looked at that that that that boy
[33:20] the king's son that was inside the
[33:24] temple the king's son was inside the
[33:27] temple but as only when he turned seven
[33:29] years old that they actually unveiled
[33:31] him I looked at that because it's in the
[33:34] seventh church H right that Christ has
[33:37] been completely unveil even hot right
[33:39] but now we actually see its full glory
[33:42] in the seven church age we see the
[33:44] king's son has been openly revealed for
[33:48] some people that's been frustrated with
[33:51] denominational stuff thank God that we
[33:53] see completely who the king's son is in
[33:56] this seven churches his name is Jesus a
[33:58] man praise the Lord let me I got a quote
[34:02] here that I want to read with this this
[34:06] is the original thoughts here in church
[34:08] age brother branham speaks here
[34:17] see here scroll down this little bit
[34:33] is that slide 14
[34:40] okay yeah right there slow scroll down
[34:42] just a little bit more for him please
[34:43] all right right in there okay the
[34:46] original church is there now she had
[34:47] children it's where we read from now she
[34:49] had children did the real Jezebel have
[34:51] children yes sir listen I'll kill a
[34:54] children what the Catholic Church her
[34:56] children is the Protestant denominations
[34:58] see it's exactly because they're doing
[35:01] the same thing baptized right into her
[35:03] by their freak baptism on the scripture
[35:06] baptism shaking hands for the Holy Ghost
[35:08] Father Son and Holy Ghost instead of the
[35:11] the Jesus Christ and just doing
[35:14] everything contrary to the Bible still
[35:16] and they walked right into it her
[35:19] daughter was called a failure ath al i8h
[35:24] she had her she Jezebel had a failure
[35:27] merit to jump jehoram the son of king of
[35:30] judah and soon the altars of Balaam was
[35:33] standing in Jerusalem now you don't have
[35:35] to go to the history for that that's
[35:37] Bible see her daughter Italian marriage
[35:40] Jehoshaphat son which was jehoram and
[35:43] her daughter did the same thing she did
[35:46] oh my can't you see it see how them
[35:50] organizations and when brother branch
[35:51] they are doing the same thing she did
[35:53] remember Jezebel kill the godly
[35:56] influence of her day and here you know
[36:00] that would have been a leadership well
[36:02] her daughter killed the people that were
[36:04] threat to her leadership right she she
[36:06] had him killed so she says her daughter
[36:09] did the same thing she did on my can't
[36:10] you see it see how the organization that
[36:12] dun dun brethren they come right back
[36:14] through Luther and them just exactly
[36:17] organize themselves to get instead of
[36:19] letting the Holy Ghost and Pentecost did
[36:22] the same exact thing exactly thing they
[36:25] couldn't just let the Holy Ghost go
[36:27] ahead and have its way and go ahead and
[36:29] every light come just examine it by the
[36:32] word and go on they couldn't let the
[36:34] Holy Spirit lead they had to make an
[36:36] organization and cut off from everything
[36:39] else that would come along went right
[36:41] straight back and married into the thing
[36:43] again just exactly when we get to that
[36:47] you just watch what's waiting for you
[36:49] down the road here see married right
[36:52] straight back in Jesus said here the jet
[36:56] this Jezebel she calls herself a
[36:58] prophetess and I'll throw her and a bed
[37:00] of worldliness and kill her children
[37:02] also what what kind with a death what it
[37:06] what kind of death is her children how
[37:09] to be killed with you see they're dead
[37:11] now spiritually that they have no
[37:13] revelation they know their organization
[37:16] they know their catechism they know
[37:19] their doctrine of the church but when it
[37:21] comes to knowing God some of them don't
[37:24] know no more about it than a Hottentot
[37:26] would know about an Egyptian night
[37:28] that's right when it comes to really
[37:30] knowing the Holy Spirit wondering
[37:32] wanting to call the Spirit of God a
[37:35] soothsayer a devil of the discerning
[37:37] spirits and things like that and casting
[37:39] out evil while he don't belong to our
[37:41] organization that group Oh bro see they
[37:45] don't they just don't know and then tag
[37:47] it with the name of Jesus only as some
[37:50] kind of holy roller some kind of thing
[37:52] like that just don't know and the hour
[37:54] is close at hand when that thing is
[37:57] going to be exposed that's exactly God
[37:59] will do it as certain as I'm standing
[38:02] behind this pulpit because he'll jerk
[38:04] his children out as certain as I'm
[38:07] standing right here God in heaven knows
[38:09] that you believe me to be a prophet of
[38:11] the Lord a servant of the Lord you
[38:13] listen to me she's close to ham yes sir
[38:16] I thank God for the promise that he's
[38:18] going to jerk these children out of that
[38:20] and there's many that or better still
[38:22] bound in those systems and we're going
[38:24] back to our slide bound in that but
[38:27] God's going to jerk him out thank God
[38:28] thank God for that many of us better
[38:30] sitting here tonight I've already been
[38:32] jerked out amen this just will go on
[38:38] here we got a couple more slides here
[38:50] so here he just tell us that she had
[38:52] children and did you realize that the
[38:55] real Jezebel have children yes sir
[38:57] listen I'll killer should know what the
[38:58] Catholic Church of children's of
[38:59] Protestants nomination so that's habited
[39:01] nomination out there alright so we want
[39:03] to kind of go here let's get our Bibles
[39:05] we're going to read revelation 13
[39:08] brother branham made a comment here as
[39:10] he was bringing the scripture out and in
[39:15] the Turkish book he said this chapter
[39:19] when he's talking about revelation 13
[39:20] said this chapter shows the power of the
[39:22] Roman Catholic Church and what she would
[39:25] do through organization remember this is
[39:28] the false bond let it name the name of
[39:31] the Lord it does so only in a lie
[39:34] revelation 13 he says is identifying the
[39:37] Roman Catholic Church and not only that
[39:38] revelation 13 identifies the United
[39:41] States of America and this even though
[39:43] you might not see the country's name but
[39:47] there are certain things that happen
[39:48] here in our country that's represented
[39:50] and many times brother branham would
[39:52] talk of how we started as a country with
[39:55] 13 stars and 13 stripes and we
[39:58] represented in Revelation chapter 13 so
[40:00] you know just um I mean something that
[40:04] we can look at here so let's pick this
[40:06] up first one says and I stood upon the
[40:08] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[40:11] out of seeing when we talk about a beast
[40:12] we're talking about a power right a
[40:15] power having seven heads and ten horns
[40:19] and upon his horns ten crowns and a
[40:22] friend of says the name of blasphemy and
[40:27] I can just tell you right now the name
[40:29] of blasphemy would be you know I'm
[40:31] Catholic well what about being Christian
[40:33] see because in the Bible said that it
[40:37] was an ante up that they first
[40:38] recognized the Christian but we get
[40:40] later on down the line and people all
[40:42] other Christians they're Catholic now
[40:43] again I'm not Baptist on Pentecost i'm
[40:47] this and that you know what about just
[40:49] being a Christian and Christian means to
[40:51] be christ-like right but Brandon ran
[40:54] into the lady in the end the hospital
[40:56] that is crannies and he's praying for
[40:58] one sick person is in memory
[41:00] mom we pray she said clothes like her
[41:01] shut it shut the curtain right now say
[41:04] ma'am you know we just Christians we
[41:07] just want to pray Sarah your Christmas a
[41:08] she's a Methodist I have you know I
[41:10] brought a candle every night like for
[41:12] him to count every night and got nothing
[41:14] to do it you being a Christian so you
[41:17] know but people people actually take on
[41:19] that name of their denomination and feel
[41:22] like just because they're underneath
[41:23] that name that their safety their know
[41:25] their safety is in Christ in Christ the
[41:29] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[41:31] righteous run into that and are safe
[41:34] right so this name of blasphemy would be
[41:37] they were Catholic right they were
[41:39] Catholic so an upon his heads the name
[41:41] of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw
[41:44] was like unto a leopard and his feet
[41:46] were as feet of a bear and his mouth as
[41:49] the mouth of a lion and you already know
[41:53] that when a lion speaks everything else
[41:55] in the jungle just just pushes right
[41:59] that he's the king of the jungle so this
[42:01] this beast has the mouth of a lion when
[42:03] this beast talked this power talks
[42:05] everybody else just gonna listen listen
[42:07] and the dragon gave him his power and
[42:10] his seat and great Authority the dragon
[42:14] gave it to him we're going to compare
[42:16] that and a little bit drab the dragon is
[42:18] found in Revelation 12 but in brother
[42:21] branham's that compare those two so
[42:22] we'll go back and pick up a little bit
[42:23] but notice the Bible say the dragon gave
[42:25] him his power and his seat and great
[42:28] Authority and I saw one of his heads as
[42:31] it were wounded to death and his deadly
[42:32] wound was healed and all the world
[42:35] wondered after the Beast and what that
[42:37] meant Spurs the headwater death it was
[42:40] the Roman Empire actually fail right the
[42:45] Roman Empire Imperial pagan Rome that
[42:48] fail but when it when it was heal it
[42:51] came back asked papal rome which papal
[42:53] road would be the Roman Catholic Church
[42:55] the religion still dominates the world
[42:58] but there was a one time at the Empire
[43:00] the Roman Empire their military
[43:02] dominated
[43:03] world but that fell but then the
[43:04] religion started dominating the world
[43:07] that's what this means I saw one of us
[43:10] is as it were wounded to death and his
[43:12] deadly wound is healed and all the world
[43:14] wondered after the Beast and they
[43:15] worshiped the dragon which gave power
[43:17] unto the Beast and they worshiped the
[43:19] Beast saying who is like unto the Beast
[43:21] who was able to make war with him and
[43:24] there was given unto him a mouth
[43:26] speaking great things and blasphemies
[43:28] and power was given unto him to continue
[43:30] forty and two months every three and a
[43:32] half years that's Tribulation Period
[43:35] alright and he opened his mouth and
[43:37] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[43:39] name and his tabernacle and then and
[43:41] then that dwell in heaven and it was
[43:43] given unto him to make war with the
[43:45] Saints and to overcome them and power
[43:48] was given him over all Kindred's and
[43:50] tongues and nations and all that dwell
[43:53] upon the earth shall worship Him whose
[43:54] names are not written in the book of
[43:56] life of the lamb slain from the
[43:58] foundation of the world If any man have
[44:01] an ear let him hear he that leadeth into
[44:04] captivity shall go into captivity that
[44:06] killeth with the sword must be killed
[44:08] with the sword here is the patience and
[44:11] the faith of the saints verse 11 this is
[44:13] where we start talking about the United
[44:16] States and I beheld another beast
[44:19] another power coming up out of the earth
[44:23] and what that's representing that's when
[44:26] the United States was birth we came and
[44:29] you know the forefathers of this country
[44:31] came and they actually took over a land
[44:33] that was already existing they were
[44:36] people already living here the Indians
[44:39] were already living here so and says
[44:40] they they became a power that came up
[44:43] out of the earth right and and had two
[44:46] horns like a lamb and he spake like a
[44:49] spake as a dragon so for the random call
[44:52] that the civil and ecclesiastical power
[44:54] that they had those two horns
[44:56] represented civil and please ask of
[44:58] power verse 12 says he exercises all the
[45:02] power of the first beat for him and
[45:04] causeth the earth earth and then which
[45:07] dwell therein to worship the first beast
[45:09] whose deadly wound was healed
[45:12] and he do with great wonders so that he
[45:14] maketh Fire come down from heaven on
[45:16] earth in the sight of men and when
[45:19] brother branham brought that out my god
[45:21] think I was thinking to off a profit
[45:23] that scripture right there revelation 13
[45:26] 13 was with feel when the united states
[45:30] dropped the bomb on hiroshima when they
[45:33] dropped that bomb on hiroshima and there
[45:36] was another another bomb that they
[45:39] dropped on another city over there in
[45:40] japan but when they did that that's the
[45:43] fire that came down out of having that
[45:44] bomb right that's the fire that came
[45:47] down out of heaven and it made the whole
[45:48] earth wander right and and now because
[45:52] of some stuff they did back then now you
[45:54] got people threatening with all kind of
[45:55] the bumps you know that they'll drop
[45:58] right here in America so it says look
[46:00] into a great wonder so that he maketh
[46:02] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[46:04] and the sight of men and to see with
[46:06] them that dwell in error by the means of
[46:08] those miracles which he had power to do
[46:10] in the sight of the beasts saying to
[46:12] them that dwell in earth that they
[46:13] should make an image to the Beast which
[46:16] had the wound I award and did live and
[46:19] he had power to give life unto the image
[46:21] of the Beast that the image of the Beast
[46:23] should both speak and cause that as many
[46:26] as would not worship worship the image
[46:29] of the Beast should be killed brother
[46:32] branham actually even spoke in one place
[46:34] that there will be hope that comes out
[46:37] of the United States there will be a
[46:40] pope that comes out of United States now
[46:42] I can only say what I what I kind of
[46:47] read this but it's not not anything
[46:49] brother Brandon said but I'm in the
[46:50] Catholic Church if i'm not mistaken they
[46:54] had a prophecy that they'd only have so
[46:56] many posts before Jesus would return and
[46:59] 4 i'm not mistaken i think they have one
[47:02] more pope after the current Pope and
[47:04] that's what to be the last one according
[47:06] to their prophecies now that's not
[47:08] anything brother branham said but that's
[47:10] according to their prophecies so
[47:14] there is a lot of things that could be
[47:16] fulfilled in a very short amount of time
[47:18] and we just got to be very very watchful
[47:21] of all of these things you know as there
[47:24] as there as you're approaching but here
[47:25] verse 16 says he causeth all both small
[47:27] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[47:30] receive a mark in the right hand or in
[47:32] their foreheads and let me just let me
[47:35] just make it clear don't go around
[47:37] looking for somebody with a 666 tattooed
[47:40] in their hand or on the hand don't look
[47:43] at that people got way too many tattoos
[47:46] for you to be able to find something
[47:48] like that that's not the way it's going
[47:50] to be but what brother brahim say is
[47:52] when they reject the word they have
[47:54] actually taken the mark of the beast
[47:56] when they reject the word they actually
[47:59] take the mark of the beast be careful
[48:02] right stay with the word listen it says
[48:06] verse 17 and that no man might buy or
[48:09] sell save he that had the mark or the
[48:12] name of the beast or the number of his
[48:15] name here's the wisdom let him that hath
[48:17] understanding count the number of the
[48:19] beast for it is the number of a man
[48:21] there's numbers six hundred three score
[48:23] and six I've seen people just get
[48:29] completely just blown away through the
[48:32] first two had that thing the thing was
[48:34] uh if you they people that like direct
[48:40] deposit at first right they thought it's
[48:42] just you know to the system just too
[48:44] much against you and now there's one
[48:46] thing they have they don't want you to
[48:49] get a chip inside of you because you get
[48:51] a chip though you got the mark of the
[48:53] beast you know I can I know that's not
[48:59] the market abuse I can tell you that
[49:00] much you know I mean probably from
[49:03] there's probably some medical reasons
[49:04] why they might want to do that and just
[49:06] talk it over the adopter but that's not
[49:08] the mark of the beast the mark of the
[49:09] beast is when you reject the word right
[49:11] people just so afraid nowadays and you
[49:14] know they don't even know why or what
[49:17] they're afraid of right but thank God
[49:20] profit that we don't have to live in
[49:21] fear we know exactly what the things
[49:24] means so we can approach things saying a
[49:26] man as we prepare ourselves for a
[49:29] rapture so here in this brother branham
[49:33] said to compare revelation 13 1 through
[49:37] 4 with revelation 12 verse 1 through 5
[49:42] and just start quickly reading that they
[49:45] said I stood up on the standard sea and
[49:46] saw a beast rise up by the sea I'm sorry
[49:54] says I stood upon the standard sea and
[49:56] saw a beast rise up by the sea having
[49:58] seven heads and ten horns of the front
[50:00] of horns ten crowns to find his head the
[50:02] name of blasphemy and the Beast which I
[50:04] saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
[50:05] were as the feet of a bear his mouth as
[50:08] the mouth of the lion and the dragon
[50:09] gave him power and his seat and great
[50:11] Authority and I saw one of his heads as
[50:14] it were wounded to death and his deadly
[50:16] wound was healed and all the world
[50:18] wondered after the Beast and they
[50:19] worshiped the dragon which gave power to
[50:22] the Beast and they worship the Beast
[50:23] saying who was like her to the Beast who
[50:24] was able to make war with him he said
[50:26] compare that with revelation 12 1
[50:29] through 5 and it says here and there
[50:31] appeared a great wonder in heaven a
[50:32] woman clothed with the Sun and the moon
[50:34] under her feet and upon her head a crown
[50:37] of twelve stars and she being with child
[50:40] cried travailing in birth and pained to
[50:43] be delivered there appeared another
[50:45] wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[50:47] dragon having
[50:48] heads and ten horns and seven crowns
[50:50] upon his head and his tail drew the
[50:53] third part of the stars of heaven but
[50:55] what the prophet said here i can't read
[50:57] all the quotes but when they said tell
[50:59] it's not like it had a big long tail
[51:02] tail really should have been tal eat
[51:05] which means his lie right his lie drew a
[51:10] third part of the stars of heaven and
[51:12] hit cast him to the earth and the dragon
[51:14] stood before the woman which is ready to
[51:16] be delivered for the devour her child as
[51:17] soon as it was born and she brought
[51:20] forth a man child who was to rule all
[51:22] nations with a rod of iron and her
[51:24] children was caught up in to God and
[51:25] just drunk now I want to read a couple
[51:30] quotes here from the church age book as
[51:32] brother Branham just kind of kind of
[51:34] deals with this just for a little bit
[51:37] I'm on page 236 in your church age book
[51:42] that should be slide 15 I'm going to
[51:46] skip a little bit around on this but
[51:49] just to kind of bring a little more
[51:55] clarification behind what we read into
[51:57] some of the things that the prophet
[51:58] brought to us page 236 and at the top of
[52:04] the page it says that this chapter shows
[52:05] the power of the Roman Catholic Church
[52:07] and what she would do through
[52:09] organization that's again revelation 13
[52:11] to six showing that it shows the power
[52:13] the Roman Catholic Church and what she
[52:15] would do through organization remember
[52:16] this is the false by and let it name the
[52:18] name of the Lord it does so only in a
[52:21] lie it's hit ship is not of the Lord but
[52:23] of Satan that finally ends up completely
[52:25] identified with the beasts the
[52:27] riding on the Scarlet beast distinct the
[52:29] shows our power is the god of a force
[52:31] which is Satan and not our God the Lord
[52:34] Jesus Christ all right it goes on to say
[52:37] this in verse 17 it emphatically shows
[52:40] that she will gain absolute control of
[52:43] the Commerce of the earth but no man can
[52:46] buy or sell apart from her this is borne
[52:49] out in Revelation 18 verse 9 through 17
[52:52] which shows our involvement with the
[52:53] Kings princes merchants all of
[52:55] whom have to do do with Rome and
[52:57] commerce there's another statement
[52:59] program set one day we will go on the
[53:01] gold standard that our money won't be
[53:04] worth anything and the Catholics right
[53:07] now have all the gold so they will
[53:08] control the Commerce because it's a
[53:10] widow they'll force them to force us to
[53:12] the ghosts are now you should be
[53:14] noticing or have noticed over the past
[53:16] few years there have been a arms lot of
[53:20] people talking about we buy gold all its
[53:24] law everywhere you three buy gold we buy
[53:26] go they even have been der machines that
[53:29] sell in gold bars right they have all
[53:31] that now and and people trying to stock
[53:34] up on the goal because they realize that
[53:36] there's going to be a changed that
[53:37] church I am NOT I don't want us living
[53:39] in that type of fear right if it get
[53:43] that bad you know the profit at your
[53:45] toes that when the squeeze come watch
[53:46] the third pool watch the spoken worked
[53:48] right that's that's what we should be
[53:50] watching so you just need to understand
[53:52] these are things that are happening and
[53:53] the signs are right here before us all
[53:55] over the place amen sometimes it happens
[53:58] so often that we get accustomed to it we
[54:01] don't realize that the Word of God has
[54:03] been fulfilled right before our very
[54:04] eyes right but but but notice he told us
[54:07] that so we just need to be aware i'm
[54:09] here on page 236 paragraph 3 says in
[54:14] Revelation 13 14 we learned that the
[54:18] Beast spreads his influence through the
[54:20] image which was built for him the image
[54:22] that is made is a worldwide a
[54:24] communicant council wherein all the
[54:27] organizers churches would get together
[54:28] with the Roman Catholics they are doing
[54:31] it even now it is quite possible this
[54:34] union will come in order to stop the
[54:36] power of communism but since communism
[54:39] like Nebuchadnezzar has been raised up
[54:41] to burn the flesh of the harlot Rome
[54:43] will be overcome and destroyed take note
[54:46] that everywhere the Romish Church went
[54:48] communism follow it has to be that way
[54:50] and let me warn you now don't get don't
[54:53] get thinking communism is your only
[54:55] enemy no sir is the Catholic Church also
[54:58] and even more so all right he goes on
[55:02] and and
[55:03] and the next paragraph he's kind of
[55:05] telling them to compare a revelation 12
[55:08] 1 through 5 of Revelation 13 1 through 4
[55:10] and those scriptures are listed in annex
[55:13] paragraph but I'm skipping over the page
[55:14] 237 towards the of the middle of that
[55:18] first paragraph you'll see a sentence
[55:20] that says satan and his satanic religion
[55:24] and he's after we read those scriptures
[55:26] of Revelation 13 1 through 4 and
[55:28] revelation 12 1 through 5 he says Satan
[55:30] and a satanic religion are in both of
[55:33] these beasts in Revelation 14 the Beast
[55:35] that was wounded unto death but lived
[55:37] again is Imperial pagan Rome that failed
[55:40] to the onslaught of the barbarians and
[55:42] thereby lost her temporal power but she
[55:45] regained it in capital Rome do you see
[55:48] it the nation that ruled by crushing all
[55:51] and which became the strongest Empire
[55:53] ever known was finally wounded to death
[55:56] her power was gone physically as to
[55:58] control by armies etc but under
[56:01] Constantine she came back to life for
[56:03] papal rome has infiltrated the whole
[56:06] world and her power is absolute she uses
[56:10] kings and merchants and in her deadly
[56:13] interdental irreligious and financial
[56:16] stress she is governing as the goddess
[56:18] of this present age she is also the
[56:20] dragon that stood waiting to about to
[56:23] devour the manchild Herot tried to kill
[56:25] the Lord Jesus and fell later Jesus was
[56:28] crucified by Roman soldiers but now it's
[56:30] caught up to the throne so you know
[56:33] brother Branham just kind of bringing
[56:34] out you know what happened there and
[56:37] when we read revelation 13 we read
[56:39] revelation 12 that beast that power is
[56:43] the Roman Catholic Church that's the
[56:46] Roman Catholic Church and and again when
[56:49] we read their how they they had a deadly
[56:53] wound it's talking about how they went
[56:55] from being a pope I mean a physical
[56:57] power now it's a spiritual power by
[57:01] being the church papal rome that's what
[57:03] we get there okay let's go on to our
[57:05] next slide here there is something else
[57:09] that brother Brandon brings out
[57:16] and we'll be finishing up shortly here
[57:23] it brings out something and I think I'm
[57:26] going to want to read this in a second
[57:29] Aly out of your Bible will turn the dang
[57:30] it too but he brings out the Eisenhower
[57:36] and Khrushchev that's des who was there
[57:39] and they're represented in Daniels
[57:41] vision and what he saw at the end time
[57:44] there's a statement made here by
[57:47] Khrushchev brother branham quotes it out
[57:49] of the message discerning the body of
[57:51] the Lord since I believe today many of
[57:53] you all heard what Khrushchev said the
[57:56] other day to the Americans says you read
[58:00] it in your papers here's a statement you
[58:02] who've got natural discernment you'll
[58:04] catch this he said if there is a God
[58:07] he's going to sweep the temple and clean
[58:10] it with you with your money changing
[58:12] your money changer capitalists so as you
[58:15] see what that means don't she says and
[58:18] he's right a he than a devil and
[58:20] imposter like that has to throw the
[58:23] threats out steal their sleep sinning
[58:26] drinking just ignored because they have
[58:28] no spiritual discernment of the body
[58:30] Lord what a day we're living in now he
[58:33] goes I'm over your church age book on
[58:36] page 237 I just want to read a couple
[58:39] quotes and then we'll go pick this up
[58:40] out of Daniel 2 and just a couple more
[58:43] slides after that and we'll be done for
[58:45] tonight my lord church you know the
[58:51] Prophet bringing these things out even
[58:53] in and when what what happened there
[58:55] with Khrushchev banging that shoe there
[58:57] was like a United Nations meeting and
[58:59] Khrushchev was representing five western
[59:02] nations where eyes and I was
[59:04] representing five eastern nations all
[59:06] right but let's just brother branham
[59:08] says it here in church age but let's
[59:10] just pick this up page 237 paragraph one
[59:13] says now along with that I have just
[59:15] said recall the vision of Daniel the
[59:17] last part of the image the last world
[59:19] power work the last world power was in
[59:23] the feet this is Daniel's image the last
[59:26] word power was in the feet that was iron
[59:28] and clay the iron is the Roman Empire
[59:34] but now it's no longer solid iron clay
[59:37] is mixed in it yet it is there and
[59:40] running world affairs in both the
[59:41] democratic nations and the more despotic
[59:44] ones or what we mean dictatorships right
[59:47] the despotic ones the Romish Church is
[59:49] in every nation it is mixed up in it all
[59:53] look at this let me give you a little
[59:55] something on the iron and clay remember
[59:57] when Khrushchev beat a shoe on the desk
[59:59] at the UN well there were five Eastern
[1:00:02] nations there in five western Khrushchev
[1:00:04] spoke for the east and President
[1:00:06] Eisenhower for the West in Russian
[1:00:09] Khrushchev is clean and Eisenhower means
[1:00:12] iron the two main leaders of the world
[1:00:14] the two big toes of the feet of iron and
[1:00:17] clay were side by side we are in the end
[1:00:21] of it all now that happened years ago
[1:00:24] brother branham's identifying church we
[1:00:26] are in the end time let's pick up
[1:00:29] Daniels vision here and Daniel chapter 2
[1:00:32] just read that really quickly and then
[1:00:35] we'll just a few more slides around let
[1:00:38] it go for tonight but just trying to
[1:00:40] just you know get us to see how close we
[1:00:43] are all of this gotta be in all of this
[1:00:48] got to be filled day of 2 i'm at verse
[1:00:50] 31 this was a vision Nebuchadnezzar had
[1:00:54] had a big problem he was ready to kill
[1:00:57] everybody that could you know that
[1:00:59] couldn't tell him what his dream was a
[1:01:01] dream left him and he wanted somebody to
[1:01:03] come tell him Danny was only one in the
[1:01:08] kingdom at that time that can come tell
[1:01:09] him what it meant my god might got my
[1:01:13] god i believe the prada be the only ones
[1:01:15] to be able to kind of tell p for what
[1:01:17] these things mean in this out I tell you
[1:01:19] what a fifth a theological point of view
[1:01:23] ain't gon settlements people are going
[1:01:25] to be revelation a man and the bride
[1:01:28] gonna have the revelation because the
[1:01:30] bride's been listening to the voice of
[1:01:32] god through the prophet of God right
[1:01:34] bringing the truth of God you know if I
[1:01:37] were to just stop right here and just
[1:01:39] ask a question
[1:01:40] and I and I and I I would actually ask I
[1:01:43] want you to give me feedback imma ask

[1:02:39] all of those answers are right all those
[1:02:41] answers are right searched we don't
[1:02:43] understand why the Prophet King we would
[1:02:47] actually think that this message is an
[1:02:49] alternative to denominations that's not
[1:02:53] what this is this was restoring truth
[1:02:56] right I mean truth it was messed up if
[1:02:59] people can't see that the church world
[1:03:01] is messed up I don't know what they look
[1:03:02] at that right but it was messed up you

[1:03:50] never church we needed a prophet to
[1:03:54] bring truth to us otherwise we'd be
[1:03:56] right out there doing the exact same
[1:03:58] thing that everybody else is doing thank
[1:04:01] God for truth truth we needed truth the
[1:04:06] Bible say you'll know the truth and the
[1:04:08] truth will make you free so God had to
[1:04:10] send a prophet with truth that was the
[1:04:12] main purpose don't don't ever forget
[1:04:15] that and the job was not to try to turn
[1:04:18] our hearts toward him it was a turn-on
[1:04:20] hearts back towards God ain't now praise
[1:04:24] the Lord let's read data to verse 31
[1:04:27] vowel King sauce this is daniel
[1:04:29] interpreting the dream for the king is
[1:04:31] telling what what uh what he saw thou
[1:04:34] king saw us and behold a great image the
[1:04:37] great image whose brightness was
[1:04:39] excellent stood before the end the end
[1:04:41] the form thereof with terrible this
[1:04:44] images had
[1:04:45] fine go I could tell y'all see when God
[1:04:51] used this gift in Daniels life he gave
[1:04:55] the King couldn't see that became
[1:04:57] forgotten dream but God gave the dream
[1:04:59] back to Daniel as a property and showed
[1:05:01] him exactly what the King saw so he went
[1:05:03] and told told him exactly you know there
[1:05:05] was times people came to brother Branham
[1:05:07] and shared a dream and he would actually
[1:05:08] say hey you forgot to sell this part
[1:05:10] because God would show him the dream and
[1:05:13] if he's shooting a dream he could also
[1:05:14] show them the interpretation we're not
[1:05:16] playing games with this right this dis
[1:05:19] was genuine God and the reason God uses
[1:05:22] life and such and such a magnitude and
[1:05:25] so that we can see the hand of God on
[1:05:27] his life listen to what the man is
[1:05:29] trying to tell you because I'm with him
[1:05:31] a man listen the images had was a fine
[1:05:36] goal is breast in his arms of silver is
[1:05:39] belied his thighs of brass his legs of
[1:05:41] iron his feet part of iron and part of
[1:05:44] clay as we brother Brown was just
[1:05:45] bringing out his feet part of iron and
[1:05:47] part of clay thou sawest till that a
[1:05:51] stone was cut out without hands which
[1:05:53] smote the image upon his feet that work
[1:05:55] with that were iron and clay and break
[1:05:58] them to pieces see that stone is
[1:06:00] representing Christ then was the iron
[1:06:03] the clay the brass the silver and the
[1:06:06] gold broke into pieces together and
[1:06:08] became like the chaff of the summer
[1:06:10] threshing floors and the wind carried
[1:06:13] them away that no place was found for
[1:06:15] them and the stone that smote the image
[1:06:17] became a great mountain and filled the
[1:06:20] whole earth this is the dream and and we
[1:06:24] will tell the interpretation there
[1:06:25] before the King Thou O king are the king
[1:06:29] of of kings for the God of heaven have
[1:06:34] given the aquila power and strength and
[1:06:36] glory verse 38 and wheresoever the
[1:06:40] children of men's well the beasts of the
[1:06:43] field and the fowls of the heavens happy
[1:06:46] given into thine hand and have made the
[1:06:50] ruler over them all thou art this head
[1:06:53] of goals
[1:06:53] Daniel is actually interpreting the
[1:06:55] dream for King Nebuchadnezzar verse 39
[1:06:57] and after these shall arise another
[1:06:59] Kingdom inferior to thee and another
[1:07:01] third kingdom of brass which shall bear
[1:07:04] rule over all the earth and the fourth
[1:07:06] kingdom shall be strong as iron that was
[1:07:08] the Roman Empire right there right there
[1:07:11] the the four kingdoms would have been
[1:07:14] the Babylonians that's Nebuchadnezzar
[1:07:17] and then at the battle that the
[1:07:19] Babylonians dim came the Medes and
[1:07:21] Persians right the Medes and Persians
[1:07:24] they came next and then after that would
[1:07:26] have been Alexander the Great right
[1:07:28] bringing in the Grecian kingdom and then
[1:07:31] the final fourth kingdom would have been
[1:07:32] the Roman Empire all right so that's
[1:07:34] what we're seeing here says and the
[1:07:36] fourth kingdom shall be as strong as
[1:07:38] iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[1:07:40] pieces and subdue with all things and as
[1:07:43] iron that breaketh all these shellack
[1:07:46] breaking visas and brews and whereas
[1:07:48] down sauce two feet and toes part of
[1:07:50] potters clay and part of iron the
[1:07:53] kingdom shall be divided but there shall
[1:07:55] be in it of the strength of the iron for
[1:07:59] as much as that got sauce the iron mixed
[1:08:01] with the mire clean for the brand of
[1:08:03] again just pointed out that they're
[1:08:05] divided you got communism on one side
[1:08:07] and then you got you know democracy on
[1:08:11] another side all right but still the
[1:08:14] Catholic Church's invented and all an
[1:08:16] act no matter where the Catholic Church
[1:08:18] is still deeply and better than all of
[1:08:20] that and as the toes of the feet were
[1:08:23] part of iron and part of clay so the
[1:08:25] kingdom shall be partly strong and
[1:08:27] partly broken and where's da sauce iron
[1:08:29] mixed with miry clay they shall mingle
[1:08:31] themselves with the seed of men but they
[1:08:34] shall not cleave one to another events
[1:08:36] iron is not mixed with clay and in the
[1:08:38] days of these Kings show that God of
[1:08:39] heaven set up a kingdom which shall
[1:08:41] never be destroyed and the kingdom shall
[1:08:43] not be left to other people but it shall
[1:08:45] break in pieces and consume all these
[1:08:47] kingdoms and it shall beat and it's just
[1:08:49] an forever for as much as down stars
[1:08:52] that the stone was cut out of the
[1:08:54] mountain without hands and that and
[1:08:56] break in pieces the iron the brass the
[1:08:59] clay the silver and the gold the Great
[1:09:01] God hath made known to the king what
[1:09:03] shall come to
[1:09:04] you're after and the dream is certain
[1:09:07] and the interpretation thereof sure
[1:09:10] Daniel's just kind of identifying tell
[1:09:13] them what the dream was tell them what
[1:09:14] the interpretation is and then brother
[1:09:15] Brandon brings even more clarity let us
[1:09:17] see even in the days of Eisenhower being
[1:09:21] king I'm President Khrushchev been a
[1:09:23] leader of Russia showing how even their
[1:09:26] names tied into this image that Daniel
[1:09:30] had so church we we just don't have much
[1:09:32] longer we don't have much longer let's
[1:09:34] go a little further we got a couple more
[1:09:36] slides here we'll be done revelation 13
[1:09:39] fours they said they worshiped the
[1:09:40] dragon which gave power to the beast and
[1:09:43] they worship the Beast saying who is
[1:09:44] like unto the Beast who's able to make
[1:09:46] war with him and what we have here
[1:09:50] brother Branham says this now there are
[1:09:53] at present some great names in the world
[1:09:56] there are some mighty nations for right
[1:09:59] now says right now Rome is calling the
[1:10:03] tool there's a great names in the world
[1:10:06] that's the mighty nations but Rome is
[1:10:09] called the tomb the Pope is in the
[1:10:10] driver's seat and his power is going to
[1:10:13] increase no one can war against him
[1:10:17] that's what the Prophet tells us right
[1:10:20] amen listen revelation 13 6 13 6 said
[1:10:25] they opened his mouth and blasphemy
[1:10:26] against God to blast through his name
[1:10:28] and it's tabernacle and then that dwell
[1:10:30] in the heaven and the Prophet said this
[1:10:32] he says teaching for doctrines the
[1:10:36] commandments of men heady high-minded
[1:10:40] having a form of godliness and denying
[1:10:43] the power thereof heat blasting the name
[1:10:45] of God changing that name to titles and
[1:10:48] refusing to do otherwise so when he took
[1:10:52] baptizing baptism in the name of Lord
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ just father son Holy Ghost
[1:10:56] he took that away and all the other
[1:10:58] churches follow right down that path
[1:11:00] it's very few tie still holding on to
[1:11:02] baptism name Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:11:04] though the Catholic Church took that
[1:11:06] away
[1:11:07] refuse refuse to repent or refuse to go
[1:11:09] back just last slide here brother
[1:11:14] branham says this the scripture actually
[1:11:20] says my sheep hear my voice and I know
[1:11:21] them and they follow me that's John 1027
[1:11:24] the prophet said an authoritarian church
[1:11:25] age he says thank God for the sheep that
[1:11:28] will not worship Him everyone but the
[1:11:31] very leg would be deceived but they will
[1:11:33] not be deceived for they hear the
[1:11:36] Shepherd's voice and they follow him he
[1:11:39] said this also in the 34 he said now
[1:11:42] then see this what we've been trying to
[1:11:45] show you they see the death that started
[1:11:47] in the first age the seed of
[1:11:49] organization has finally grown into the
[1:11:51] tree in which every fowl bird is lodged
[1:11:54] now that tree in which every file bird
[1:11:57] is launched can be found by the brand of
[1:11:58] the scripture he's actually quoting
[1:12:00] scripture that's found in Revelation 18
[1:12:03] to Revelation 18 2 i'm a read this quote
[1:12:06] and if y'all just give me just just a
[1:12:08] few minutes I want to read just a few
[1:12:10] verses out of Revelation 18 will close
[1:12:12] for the night but I just want to just
[1:12:13] drop this in mine listen he says it says
[1:12:17] has finally grown into the tree in which
[1:12:19] every fowl bird is large and spite of
[1:12:22] her claims that she is the giver of life
[1:12:24] she is the giver of death her fruit is
[1:12:27] death they that partake of her dad this
[1:12:30] mighty World Church system that fools
[1:12:33] the world that in and her is physical
[1:12:36] and spiritual salvation to seasonal
[1:12:38] destroys the multitudes but not only is
[1:12:40] she death personified but this dad carry
[1:12:44] on this debt carry on creature will be
[1:12:48] itself put to death with death which is
[1:12:51] the lake of fire oh that men would
[1:12:54] perceive what their end will be by
[1:12:57] remaining in her notice this come out of
[1:13:00] her for why will you that turn with me
[1:13:04] to Revelation 18 just a couple verses
[1:13:06] and will close for tonight
[1:13:20] you just go to the last 5 implemented
[1:13:22] ago revelation 18 says this verse 1 and
[1:13:26] after this thing I saw another angel
[1:13:27] come down from heaven having great power
[1:13:30] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:13:33] glory light and with his glory and he
[1:13:37] cried Miley with a strong voice and
[1:13:39] Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen
[1:13:41] and if I could just dispel that verse
[1:13:44] said the earth was lightened with his
[1:13:46] glory how many times of brother branham
[1:13:48] go around the earth preach the gospel
[1:13:52] seven times the earth was lightened with
[1:13:55] his glory seven is God's number of
[1:13:58] completion right seven times he went
[1:14:01] around this earth preaching the gospel
[1:14:03] the country the various countries that
[1:14:05] heard the gospel they had an opportunity
[1:14:07] here it's influenced just about every
[1:14:10] nation right here the descriptions being
[1:14:13] fulfilled it's not something that we
[1:14:15] waiting to be fulfilled its operated
[1:14:16] been for you listen verse 2 says and he
[1:14:19] cried mightily with the strong voice
[1:14:21] saying Babylon the Great is fallen is
[1:14:22] fallen and has become a habitation of
[1:14:24] devils and the and the hold of every
[1:14:26] foul spirit and a cage of every unclean
[1:14:29] and hateful bird for all nations have
[1:14:32] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:14:34] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:14:36] have committed fornication with her and
[1:14:38] the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:14:40] rich through the abundance of her
[1:14:42] delicacies and this is verse 4 and I
[1:14:44] heard another voice from heaven saying
[1:14:46] come out of her my people that ye be not
[1:14:48] partakers of her sins that you receive
[1:14:51] not of her plagues brother branham's
[1:14:53] ministry is the ministry that called us
[1:14:55] out of denominational system
[1:14:57] denominational system is represented as
[1:15:00] one of the the children of the harlot or
[1:15:04] the great court we got called out of
[1:15:06] that and God used an angel I angel
[1:15:10] messenger to call us out of that it's
[1:15:13] already been fulfilled search please
[1:15:15] don't take it lightly thank God we came
[1:15:18] to this truth
[1:15:20] and don't let nobody take me I'll let
[1:15:23] nobody take you from all right next week
[1:15:26] we'll be reading pages 238 through 242
[1:15:30] in our church age book and we will start
[1:15:33] talking about the final warning a
[1:15:35] five-tier the promise as well as the
[1:15:38] reward for for that age the final warn
[1:15:41] the promise and the reward that'll be
[1:15:43] found on pages 238 through 242 let's bow
[1:15:47] our heads for a word of Prayer and it
[1:15:49] closed out tonight father we thank you
[1:15:52] but it's time to study the word God this
[1:15:57] is a serious out you've already sent a
[1:16:02] prophet to reveal truth and got here we
[1:16:05] have the truth in our hands but God is
[1:16:08] up to us down a hole too distant to do
[1:16:12] everything we can to cherish you watch
[1:16:15] over to defend it even the scripture
[1:16:19] tells us that the lamb hat horn seven
[1:16:21] horns that was a seven Church agents
[1:16:23] that were defending the word so God that
[1:16:26] vests our responsibility a lot of people
[1:16:29] trying to fool here and pull they're all
[1:16:31] kind of stuff floating all over the
[1:16:33] internet but God we're standing with
[1:16:35] this word because we know the purpose of
[1:16:37] why you sent us a profit it's not being
[1:16:41] off just to be something different
[1:16:43] that's not what this message is about
[1:16:44] but God we need a truth and you brought
[1:16:47] that to us in all the way that you
[1:16:49] revealed truth the Bible tells that
[1:16:51] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:16:52] until he reveal his secrets to service
[1:16:56] the prophets and God that'sthat's that's
[1:16:58] your word you won't break it for anybody
[1:17:00] so that's what you did and we're
[1:17:02] grateful for that so god help us Lord to
[1:17:05] take what we have heard here tonight the
[1:17:08] Lord and it just to be able to share it
[1:17:10] with others to be able to apply it
[1:17:12] we don't want to just be head knowledge
[1:17:13] but we want to be something or we can
[1:17:15] kept helping some lights if they're
[1:17:17] walking in darkness you get glory and
[1:17:20] honor out of our time together tonight
[1:17:22] in Jesus name we pray
[1:17:39] praise the Lord will prepare for tonight
[1:17:42] sometimes an offer just
