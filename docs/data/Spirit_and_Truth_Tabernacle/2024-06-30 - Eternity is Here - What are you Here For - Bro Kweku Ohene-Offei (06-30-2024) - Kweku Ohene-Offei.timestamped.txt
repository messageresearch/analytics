[29:01] heard that it started really a year ago
[29:03] but they just had like some in
[29:06] inauguration Services over the
[29:08] weekend and um and I went by just to
[29:11] kind of pay greetings to them and and I
[29:14] I told them and said well since I was
[29:16] born here in in West Palm this just feel
[29:19] like my home it is my home say I want to
[29:22] come as a neighbor and uh welcome you to
[29:25] the neigh neighborhood

[29:32] wife we were I was driving down the
[29:34] street um uh I guess Thursday and I was
[29:37] looking there was a building being
[29:39] erected um in Adam Royal Palm and as I
[29:43] was looking at the building I said man
[29:44] that looked like that could be a
[29:45] Chick-fil-A you know but they didn't got
[29:47] they don't have no signs up as to what
[29:49] the building's going to be I said that
[29:50] looked like it could be a Chick-fil-A
[29:52] and then I said to myself well that's a
[29:54] little close to the Chick-fil-A down the
[29:57] street
[29:58] and uh as me and her began to talk said
[30:00] you know what Chick-fil-A could put
[30:04] another Chick-fil-A right next do to it
[30:07] and both of them would be

[44:44] a little
[44:46] ban appreciate them so much amen thank
[44:49] god um before we would uh enter into the
[44:55] word of the Lord on today I wanted to
[44:58] just uh take a
[45:00] moment to
[45:02] uh uh just read a scripture and then
[45:05] also we we voted at the beginning of the
[45:10] year for um a deacon amen uh and brother
[45:17] Simba had received a uh a vote to be
[45:23] Deacon here in our church and I'm I'm
[45:25] grateful amen uh that the numbers are
[45:30] adding uh and we've had brother Troy for
[45:34] uh some time and and uh brother Simba
[45:37] you know decided to take the uh
[45:40] responsibility we brought it before the
[45:42] church and um and he was voted on but we
[45:48] uh wanted to just do an official
[45:51] ordination amen of uh brother Simba on
[45:54] today and I wanted to just kind of read
[45:57] the scripture relating to what was done
[46:01] out of 1 Timothy chapter
[46:05] 3 amen 1 Timothy Chapter
[46:09] 3 The
[46:12] Desire um here at Spirit and Truth
[46:15] Tabernacle so everyone's aware is that
[46:19] uh the Lord will bless us with uh four
[46:23] deacons and four
[46:25] trustees uh uh that's what the brandom
[46:29] Tabernacle had and I said well that's
[46:31] and brother brandom say he had two on
[46:33] each door and uh and him and the
[46:36] assistant pastor was watching the back
[46:38] door uh but with that's our desire and
[46:41] just to see the Lord just um slowly but
[46:45] surely um providing you know all the
[46:48] different people in their different
[46:50] positions uh we're grateful for that and
[46:53] and it's not just you know just trying
[46:54] to put people in a spot but we want to
[46:57] make sure that they have a calling for
[47:00] that area otherwise if they don't have a
[47:03] calling for that area then um it just
[47:07] becomes a problem amen so we're not just
[47:10] shuffling people in positions but uh you
[47:14] know the character has to be watched and
[47:17] brother brother brother Simba has been
[47:19] with us for a while amen him him and his
[47:22] precious wife and and we've had the
[47:24] opportunity just really watch both of
[47:26] their characters because we realize when
[47:28] God calls a man he also calls his wife
[47:32] and typically he uh gives the wife
[47:35] certain characteristics that just kind
[47:36] of go right along with with the what the
[47:39] where the husband's already is and it
[47:41] just it it it you can see it just flows
[47:45] amen it's not something that we have to
[47:47] make happen and I know that um you know
[47:50] we we saw these things in brother Simba
[47:52] a long time ago but we had to wait for
[47:56] the Lord Lord to to do to do this amen
[48:00] uh in his own good time and and and and
[48:03] and um even from last year when we
[48:06] preached the theme of yielding to the
[48:08] perfect will of God uh at the beginning
[48:11] of the Year brother Simba say well
[48:13] brother we going to yield to the perfect
[48:15] will of God and we'll see whether this
[48:17] is this his will for us to do this we'll
[48:19] put it up to the church for the vote and
[48:21] let the church decide and if the church
[48:23] decides then we'll know it's the will of
[48:24] God and um he hadn't said this but I re
[48:28] recognized something after you all voted
[48:32] and um and they yield it uh there was
[48:36] some paperwork they had been waiting on
[48:39] and it had been released after the
[48:42] [Music]
[48:44] vote it was some very specific things
[48:46] that they were waiting on and I watched
[48:49] that right after the vote after they
[48:51] yielded and after you all voted it was
[48:54] released Lord amen hallelujah
[48:58] amen
[49:01] so so I I just believe God has uh
[49:05] ordained this amen and um and as a
[49:09] church we just keep moving forward uh
[49:12] with what God is doing in our midst so
[49:14] let's let me just read amen out of 1
[49:17] Timothy uh chapter 3 and uh I want to
[49:21] read verse uh 8 starting at verse 8
[49:28] and um when I finish reading this there
[49:30] is a Word document that I I want to
[49:33] bring up it's called spirit and Truth
[49:35] Tabernacle offices you'll see it it'll
[49:37] soon as you go to word it'll already be
[49:39] at the very top so just pull that up for
[49:43] me
[49:44] um here in verse 8 it says likewise must
[49:49] the deacons be
[49:52] grave uh and and this means be honest
[49:57] amen be honest uh not double tongue not
[50:01] giv to much wine not greedy or filthy
[50:05] looker uh holding the mystery of the
[50:08] faith in
[50:09] pure
[50:11] conscience uh and let these also first
[50:14] be proved so this particular portion of
[50:18] the verse is why we uh we do the vote
[50:22] and then we give a few months of proving
[50:25] and uh and then we we do the ordination
[50:27] so every Deacon that will have um they
[50:31] they will have to be
[50:32] proven uh because that's what the
[50:34] scripture says okay so uh it says let
[50:38] them also first be
[50:40] proved uh then let them use the office
[50:44] of a deacon being found
[50:46] blameless uh even so must their wives be
[50:50] grave or honest right not
[50:55] slanderers um they they they the wives
[50:58] can be in
[51:00] everything you understand your name
[51:03] coming up in
[51:05] everything you in this situation you in
[51:07] that situation no you can't do that as a
[51:09] Deacon's wife right sometime you have to
[51:12] just learn
[51:13] to
[51:15] hush and and just say thing you're going
[51:17] to get information but you can't say
[51:19] nothing or it can only be given to
[51:21] certain people like the pastor right but
[51:25] you can't be taking that all over the
[51:27] church amen a Deacon's wife cannot be a
[51:30] slanderer okay uh it it says this um so
[51:36] so the thing of it is when you're
[51:38] watching people like this you watch you
[51:40] watch things from way back you know I
[51:42] mean you look years back and sister Ruth
[51:45] we ain't never heard her name coming up
[51:47] in nothing amen ain't never heard her
[51:50] name coming up in nothing right you can
[51:52] see God was working on both of these
[51:54] people okay he says this um wise beg
[51:58] grave not slanderous sober and this is
[52:01] the key faithful in all things and and I
[52:05] know that they have a young family and
[52:09] they they will be challenged in some
[52:10] things and that's why we that's why
[52:12] brother Troy was doing everything he can
[52:14] to try to get help around some of our
[52:18] young families amen we want to
[52:22] succeed we really want to succeed right
[52:25] so so we got to help one another we're
[52:27] connected to one another amen praise the
[52:30] Lord but here you know the scripture
[52:32] says faithful in all things let the
[52:34] deacons be the husbands of one wife
[52:38] ruling their children and their own
[52:41] houses well just just with that alone uh
[52:45] we realize that if a Brother's been
[52:47] married twice and if it if his and his
[52:50] other wife is still living he can't be a
[52:53] deacon in a church there's other roles
[52:54] he can he can play but he can't a deacon
[52:57] in the church so and if a man is
[53:01] single not married he can't be a deacon
[53:05] in the church praise the Lord there's
[53:09] other roles he can play but it can't be
[53:11] a deacon in the church sometime you that
[53:14] brother right there he ain't married
[53:16] don't that's not none pray for him to
[53:18] get
[53:21] married amen then God can take him to
[53:23] the next level amen all right
[53:26] um it says the Bible says this um let
[53:30] the deacons be the husbands of one wife
[53:32] ruling their children in their own
[53:34] houses well for they that have used the
[53:37] office of a deacon well purchased to
[53:39] themselves a good degree and a great
[53:41] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[53:44] Jesus I want to just read this um uh
[53:47] brother brandom laid out the offices of
[53:49] the church so that you understand what
[53:51] the office of the deacon does here at
[53:53] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle um I don't
[53:56] want the deacons to be
[54:00] figureheads what I mean by that is just
[54:02] holding a title but not doing uh
[54:05] anything with the job and there's
[54:06] churches where you the Deacon that's
[54:08] just a that's just a figurehead but we
[54:10] we want to we want our deacons to be
[54:13] empowered to do exactly what the prophet
[54:17] said that they should do and here and
[54:19] when they laid this out at at brandom
[54:21] Tabernacle I kind of took that and just
[54:23] scroll down to where it says the office
[54:25] of Deacons
[54:26] I took that and just uh made it here for
[54:29] spirit and Truth Tabernacle it says the
[54:30] office of deacons as elected according
[54:33] to the word of God and again the church
[54:35] has to vote on the office of a deacon uh
[54:37] as elected according to the word of God
[54:39] and the manner of spirit and Truth
[54:41] Tabernacle is to act as an office of
[54:44] spiritual assistance to the pastors so
[54:47] uh understand that when spiritual things
[54:50] are happening in the church uh I have to
[54:53] go to those deacons and talk to them
[54:55] about those things and spiritual things
[54:57] they may know about they'll come to me
[54:59] and talk about but we all spiritual
[55:01] matters we have to kind of work uh
[55:03] together on all right so uh uh act as an
[55:07] office of spiritual assistance to the
[55:09] pastors they are to assist the pastors
[55:12] on all of his spiritual activities
[55:15] they're giving free
[55:17] speech and presenting to the pastors any
[55:20] program or benefits that would bless the
[55:23] general spiritual welfare of the church
[55:24] now I've seen churches where
[55:27] uh the pastor wants to be the only one
[55:28] making decision he don't want anybody to
[55:30] speak into that here at Spirit and Truth
[55:32] Tabernacle I want the deacons to be able
[55:35] to speak into things and together we
[55:38] come up with a a solution but uh they
[55:41] have the free speech to be able to bring
[55:45] uh things and present it to me uh like
[55:48] even right now you all might not have
[55:50] known this but uh even the way that
[55:52] we've been doing uh communion the
[55:56] deacons have been behind a lot of that
[55:59] and and talking about how we probably
[56:00] should do that amen uh I've been like
[56:03] let's do it every month like brother
[56:06] wait brother let's we might have to
[56:07] worry about we got to worry about this
[56:09] got to worry about that they speak into
[56:10] it you know what I do humble
[56:13] myself amen and if I can humble myself
[56:18] to the deacons guess what I expect the
[56:21] rest of the church to
[56:22] do humble
[56:24] yourself amen hello
[56:27] somebody amen all right uh so here it
[56:32] says um uh they're given free speech and
[56:36] presented to the Pastors in the program
[56:37] of benefits that would bless the general
[56:39] and spiritual welfare of the church they
[56:41] must be apt to teach now this is very
[56:43] very important to me brother Brandon put
[56:45] that there now the scripture doesn't
[56:47] specifically say it like that it says
[56:49] the bishop must be apt to teach and the
[56:52] bishop is none other than the local
[56:54] Pastor in the church but uh but but
[56:56] brother brandham added this that they
[56:58] must be apt to teach so uh here at
[57:01] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle our deacons
[57:03] you will hear from them
[57:05] periodically that's why you hear from
[57:07] Brother Troy all right uh because this
[57:10] is a part of their responsibility they
[57:13] got to be able to stand up here and
[57:15] deliver the word of God something
[57:17] happened to the pastor the Deacon should
[57:18] be able to kind of car help carry the
[57:20] church on so I I got to make sure they
[57:23] train properly I got to give them
[57:25] opportunities to stand here behind the
[57:26] pull pit all of that got to be done yeah
[57:29] it's not an um it's this is not an easy
[57:32] job trying to spread this out amongst
[57:34] all the ministers it ain't easy and then
[57:39] and then then have enough time for me to
[57:40] kind of get my thoughts out there too
[57:42] right but we have to do these things and
[57:44] God will give us wisdom amen uh as we go
[57:47] in order to be able to get every gift
[57:49] used but it says here they must be apt
[57:52] to teach ready to assist a pastor or
[57:54] associate pastor on every Duty we have
[57:56] called to do so they shall assist in
[57:59] sering communion they shall be acting
[58:02] ushers in all services they shall police
[58:05] the church in keeping civil order and
[58:08] conduct they shall assist in taking
[58:10] local offerings and um they shall
[58:13] oversee the spiritual conduct of the
[58:15] church and working with the pastor and
[58:19] one another on spiritual problems and
[58:20] matters of the Saints there they shall
[58:23] be ready at any time to assist the need
[58:26] of every saint who is burdened and in
[58:28] need of spiritual consultation so um
[58:33] right there is that if there's a
[58:34] specific need spiritually that
[58:36] somebody's dealing with you have every
[58:39] right to contact your
[58:41] Deacon you have every right to contact
[58:45] your Deacon the same way you contact the
[58:47] pastor you can call the Deacon and talk
[58:51] things over with them and get a word of
[58:53] prayer from the Deacon yes sir amen
[58:56] right so
[58:59] um this this is this is what we're doing
[59:01] is sharing the responsibility it don't
[59:04] all fall on brother Jack's shoulders we
[59:06] are a mature
[59:10] church I want to just say it like that
[59:13] so there was a time where everything
[59:15] fell on my shoulders but no we need to
[59:17] kind of start moving some of those
[59:19] things off we got our deacons here and
[59:22] then what you don't want to do is try to
[59:24] create this thing where I got my
[59:26] favorite
[59:28] Deacon so I only go to this one Deacon
[59:32] no don't do that we got
[59:35] deacons so use them equally sir all
[59:39] right Church all right so here uh it
[59:43] says uh the saint who is burdened and in
[59:45] need of spiritual consultation or
[59:48] general welfare so if somebody have a
[59:51] very specific need you know I I I I need
[59:53] a bill paid I need this I need that go
[59:55] to to the
[59:56] deacons Amen Let the deacons kind of
[1:00:00] sort through that right cuz we've had
[1:00:04] people come I remember one time a sister
[1:00:06] came here and my she was getting ready
[1:00:08] to run through the church with all her
[1:00:11] needs she was getting ready to she was
[1:00:14] getting ready to kind of take everybody
[1:00:15] out and nobody knew what was going to
[1:00:17] happen but I had already called and I I
[1:00:19] got her name from other people and they
[1:00:21] told me she did this in our church she
[1:00:23] did this in our church she did I say she
[1:00:25] ain't going to nobody house to stay at
[1:00:27] nobody house not here and uh so you know
[1:00:32] and she didn't have no room for a hotel
[1:00:34] we got a van here sis that you can stay
[1:00:37] in
[1:00:38] amen I had to do it like that because I
[1:00:41] knew she was trying to plant seeds
[1:00:43] amongst the Saints and she going to give
[1:00:45] a a nice SB story Saints every sob story
[1:00:49] ain't
[1:00:51] true so we got people here that can
[1:00:54] listen to the story and then the deacons
[1:00:57] will listen to it and they get a little
[1:00:58] something they'll come they'll come and
[1:01:00] they'll okay this is what I heard so
[1:01:03] then we'll work that thing out praise
[1:01:05] the Lord but we here to protect the
[1:01:09] church amen we're here to protect the
[1:01:12] church that's that's our job so uh and
[1:01:14] and the and the the more we grow the
[1:01:16] more s stories all
[1:01:20] right amen don't don't we ain't crazy
[1:01:24] y'all amen but but these are the things
[1:01:26] so we we watch everything why they
[1:01:28] connecting to this what what is going on
[1:01:30] here all right amen okay so um here the
[1:01:36] the prophet says they shall be ready at
[1:01:38] any time to assist the need of every
[1:01:39] saint who is burden in need of spiritual
[1:01:41] consultation on General Welfare they
[1:01:43] have not the right to act upon any
[1:01:45] program of promotion without agreement
[1:01:47] with one another right the pastors or
[1:01:51] the trustees if the program they're
[1:01:54] considering doing involves Church funds
[1:01:57] so if if funds are involved then it has
[1:01:59] to go through the trustees and the
[1:02:02] trustees have to speak into that amen
[1:02:05] even I take my financial decisions
[1:02:08] through the
[1:02:09] trustees praise the Lord
[1:02:12] amen uh they will be responsible for God
[1:02:16] for their conduct and manner of service
[1:02:18] according to the word of God and here
[1:02:20] the prophet says they shall not have
[1:02:22] meetings among themselves with without
[1:02:26] the pastor or associate pastor present
[1:02:30] amen so this just keeps amen everybody
[1:02:34] honest amen if somebody get to the
[1:02:38] Deacon we got to get rid of the pastor
[1:02:39] we just got to get rid of the pastor

[1:02:47] tell me that you said they trying to get
[1:02:49] rid of
[1:02:50] you all right that's so we we don't do
[1:02:54] things that way we we keep it all honest
[1:02:57] amen and that that God Amen could just
[1:02:59] be glorified in everything that we do so
[1:03:01] brother Simba we want to invite him to
[1:03:03] come up and we just want to lay hands on
[1:03:06] him amen and and pray uh over him uh we
[1:03:11] just thank God for our precious brother
[1:03:14] um and uh just just all that he has done
[1:03:17] here at Spirit and Truth
[1:03:19] Tabernacle uh I would say that this man
[1:03:22] has been an asset he uh
[1:03:27] not not not a liability but he's been an
[1:03:31] asset since the very first day he walked
[1:03:34] through these doors and uh you know I I
[1:03:37] met him through
[1:03:39] email um years ago he reached out to me
[1:03:43] and he says um uh he had never been
[1:03:45] there at West Palm Beach and he and he
[1:03:47] and he reached out to me and says I I
[1:03:49] see you have been to my home country and
[1:03:52] I said yeah he said I was just you know
[1:03:54] just wanting to kind of get to know you
[1:03:56] and fellowship with you a little bit and
[1:03:58] and uh and we would just go back and
[1:04:00] forth and and email and then I invited
[1:04:02] him to uh one of the meetings at brother
[1:04:05] Westco that he had he came to that
[1:04:08] meeting and uh and he left the meeting
[1:04:11] with uh a
[1:04:14] desire to
[1:04:16] relocate uh to West Palm Beach and in
[1:04:19] his company when he relocated here in
[1:04:21] his company he was the before covid he
[1:04:24] was the first person person uh in the
[1:04:27] company to be able to work
[1:04:29] remotely and the reason that he told the
[1:04:31] people that he wanted to come to West
[1:04:33] Palm Beach was that he said there's a
[1:04:36] church there that I'm connected to and
[1:04:39] he says my wife my wife to be is going
[1:04:42] to be moving there and I want to be
[1:04:44] there with my wife so when they heard
[1:04:46] him say there's a church there they say
[1:04:48] hey there a church you want to go to in
[1:04:50] West pal Beach they said we got to make
[1:04:52] a reasonable accommodation oh my for you
[1:04:56] to go to church good amen so that's what
[1:04:58] actually brought him here to West Palm
[1:05:00] Beach right and uh and like I say since
[1:05:03] he's been here has been an asset and we
[1:05:06] thank God for brother Simba M andami let

[1:07:31] and whatever the Lord need that's what
[1:07:33] he do um uh for some of the reason that
[1:07:38] he actually you know he's always been a
[1:07:40] a
[1:07:40] musician it's always
[1:07:43] been um used play bass guitar when he

[1:07:47] back um
[1:07:50] drums he get up here and cut loose in a

[1:08:14] look at people like uh brother Capers
[1:08:17] and brother Stanley brother Coleman and

[1:08:27] have to step up and do what we have to
[1:08:29] do and um um and um you know just in
[1:08:35] watching them we realize that we had to
[1:08:37] be the example for the next generation
[1:08:39] and some of the things that we talk
[1:08:40] about because we're in our mid-50s and
[1:08:43] we know that the Lord Jesus uh promised
[1:08:45] according to scripture that he gives us
[1:08:47] three score and 10 and with giving us
[1:08:50] three score and 10 if that were to be
[1:08:52] true and that's all God gave us then
[1:08:55] that gives us about 15 14 15 years so we
[1:08:59] have to lay everything we can into the
[1:09:02] Next Generation and this is why we push

[1:16:29] laptop he didn't even have a a Bible to
[1:16:32] to preach from all right but they had
[1:16:34] Christ on the inside to inspire him to
[1:16:37] preach amen so we are not confined to
[1:16:41] technology computers and slides and
[1:16:43] PowerPoints the only confinement is the
[1:16:45] Lord Jesus Christ so we're going to go
[1:16:48] old school amen so I want to give a
[1:16:51] little testimony about a trip that I
[1:16:53] went to Mexico it was May 25th through
[1:16:57] May 28th I think it was Saturday the
[1:17:00] pastor invited me about probably 8 month
[1:17:03] ago it was one no sorry it was 53rd
[1:17:06] anniversary of the church so I was there
[1:17:09] last year after my graduation it was a
[1:17:11] wonderful time so he said brother H I'm
[1:17:14] going to invite you to be the main
[1:17:15] speaker so he informed me already pray
[1:17:18] about it we pray the Lord open the door
[1:17:20] everything so just I had something that
[1:17:22] I needed to do so I put it before the
[1:17:24] Lord Lord something personally if you
[1:17:26] accomplish this then I know you've made
[1:17:28] a way for the trip so the Lord provided
[1:17:31] everything was successful but then just
[1:17:33] before I didn't buy my ticket because of
[1:17:35] that just before then when I was about
[1:17:38] to buy the ticket uh I live I'm on the
[1:17:40] FL first floor the the the guest
[1:17:42] bathroom in my apartment begin to leak
[1:17:45] water coming from the second floor to my
[1:17:48] bathroom the guest bathroom I said no I
[1:17:50] can't leave this and I travel so H to me
[1:17:53] the long s Shir was back and forth back
[1:17:55] and forth for the ho is ho Association
[1:17:58] they want to take they don't want to
[1:18:00] give out
[1:18:02] so they push it on the person leaving on
[1:18:04] the second floor so it just took a it
[1:18:06] took a toll so I told the brother the
[1:18:08] pastor in fact it look it looks I'm not
[1:18:10] going to make it because I can't leave
[1:18:12] water draining I don't know what is
[1:18:14] going to happen so it need to be fixed
[1:18:16] or at least something to be done before
[1:18:18] I could leave and he sent a message back
[1:18:21] almost crying we communicate mainly
[1:18:23] through text message and and audio said
[1:18:25] brother I've invited people from around
[1:18:27] Peru Colombia different part of Mexico
[1:18:30] and uh I'm going to pray that the Lord
[1:18:33] will make a way for you to come and so
[1:18:35] he couldn't take no so we went and the
[1:18:38] the prizes were going through the roof
[1:18:40] it was moving from I think around 500 to
[1:18:44] 600 $ 800 now it's almost
[1:18:46] $1,000 so H the meetings were Friday
[1:18:50] Saturday Sunday and so I think the the
[1:18:53] apartment was going to be fixed the
[1:18:54] leaking was going to be fixed on Friday
[1:18:55] so I said brother it looks like the
[1:18:57] earliest are even com in Saturday and
[1:18:59] the next day the the meetings are going
[1:19:00] to be over so if you don't mind this
[1:19:02] year let's skip it and God will it next
[1:19:04] year so I sent an audio text message to
[1:19:07] him and I thought okay everything is
[1:19:09] over I went back home I was in town and
[1:19:12] I pray Lord what do you want me to
[1:19:13] preach put up on another servant's heart
[1:19:15] to preach so I just like wash my hand
[1:19:18] off it so I was there I was the kitchen
[1:19:20] when he called we don't usually do
[1:19:22] calling we do texting and audio so he
[1:19:24] called this I said brother if you come
[1:19:26] Saturday is perfect you can be here in
[1:19:28] the morning and you can preach Saturday
[1:19:30] and Sunday because we can let you go I
[1:19:33] said Lord whatever be your will so I
[1:19:35] just went to the computer took my laptop
[1:19:37] bought the ticket $1,000. 34 34 $1,000
[1:19:42] $134 and said it's okay Jesus Christ
[1:19:45] gave his life to it so if it's your word
[1:19:46] for me to go you will take care cuz I
[1:19:49] said the end of the month is coming if
[1:19:51] your family don't visit you your bills
[1:19:52] will always visit you the bills will
[1:19:54] always come they don't
[1:19:56] slack brother but I said Lord whatever
[1:19:58] be your will let it be so I bought a
[1:20:00] ticket and then give the brother
[1:20:01] information that I'll be coming Saturday
[1:20:03] I'll arrive I'll have to go through
[1:20:05] Houston Texas and take another flight
[1:20:07] from Houston to verac Cruz so I'll get
[1:20:08] there by 11:30 and uh all is set so no
[1:20:12] problem so we went and I had to do
[1:20:15] preparation and I had only 3 hours to
[1:20:17] sleep and I said when am I going to
[1:20:18] sleep and when am I going to wake up so
[1:20:20] Lord you do it all the time so I'm going
[1:20:22] to listen to messages I'm not going to
[1:20:24] go to sleep and then a day before I
[1:20:26] couldn't really sleep that much because
[1:20:27] of different things so for 2 days and I
[1:20:30] said well if I fall asleep the angel of
[1:20:32] the Lord will wake me up so I'm not
[1:20:33] worried I listen to messages and I fell
[1:20:36] asleep and the Lord woke me up amen and
[1:20:38] I don't use I'm not an alarm person
[1:20:39] since high school it doesn't work for me
[1:20:41] when the AL larm Rings I'll just turn it
[1:20:43] off and go back to sleep so so I learn
[1:20:46] early I'm not a larm but thank God I
[1:20:49] have an angel of the Lord God has given
[1:20:51] you that will take care of everything
[1:20:53] and sometime we can go beyond the
[1:20:56] limitations of the Flesh and allow The
[1:20:58] Sovereign Lord to take over and he'll do
[1:21:00] what he does AM and he I don't worry
[1:21:02] when I go to sleep I go to sleep
[1:21:04] sometime as late as 4:00 a.m. and I wake
[1:21:06] up when I need to wake up so it does it
[1:21:08] doesn't matter so we went sometime I
[1:21:10] think brother Jack was talking about
[1:21:12] sometime you don't know what go behind
[1:21:13] the scene you only look at brother Jack
[1:21:16] brother Troy brother Smiley brother
[1:21:18] brother brother Jerry brother Quinton Jr
[1:21:22] brother quu and all the preachers coming
[1:21:23] to preach but what the scene you don't
[1:21:26] have an idea what goes on you only see
[1:21:28] the word coming but then they've made a
[1:21:30] covenant with the Lord to gather God's
[1:21:33] people so sometime they will put their
[1:21:35] own family they will sacrifice their
[1:21:37] family some people be preaching to you
[1:21:39] while their children are walking on the
[1:21:41] streets while their children are not in
[1:21:43] the Lord but they will preach for you to
[1:21:45] have eternal life and you got to pray
[1:21:48] you got to be thankful to the Lord and
[1:21:50] pray for them and know the sacrifice
[1:21:52] that they have sacrificed for you to
[1:21:55] hear the word of the Lord to bring you
[1:21:57] where you are amen amen so by God's
[1:22:00] grace I got there 11 around 11:30 they
[1:22:03] pick me up I couldn't even go to the
[1:22:05] hotel we just went to the the meeting is
[1:22:07] in the the where the ministers live they
[1:22:10] have a big acres of land their father
[1:22:12] the old Pastor bought for them so they
[1:22:13] build their houses around but then about
[1:22:15] 250 to 300 people so they have they
[1:22:17] build a tent and then they cook around
[1:22:20] the same place and they feed the people
[1:22:22] and they have meetings around and I
[1:22:24] learned something something that how
[1:22:25] they incorporate the the children in the
[1:22:28] services the case about let's say lind's
[1:22:30] age somewhere even 10 they were the one
[1:22:33] the parents the mothers who cook the
[1:22:34] food and then after the service they
[1:22:36] condemn the place Chang into a dining
[1:22:39] room and then the children were serving
[1:22:41] food they put on mask 12 years 14 15 and
[1:22:45] they were the one who were doing the
[1:22:47] serving wow and I said said what said is
[1:22:50] true he said if the kids are not young
[1:22:53] enough for the devil to use them then
[1:22:55] they are not too young enough for the
[1:22:56] Lord to use
[1:22:58] them so so the earier and I heard
[1:23:00] brother talking about the children theer
[1:23:02] we get them to to be in the things of
[1:23:05] the service of the Lord the better
[1:23:06] because they become parts and passs of
[1:23:08] their lives because if they don't do
[1:23:10] nothing sitting there just listen to the
[1:23:12] word they get to a place it's in them to
[1:23:14] do something and the friends and
[1:23:16] influences will get them to do something
[1:23:18] in the world that they are not supposed
[1:23:20] to do so I think it's high time we get
[1:23:22] them to do incorporate them in the
[1:23:25] in everything in music in everything
[1:23:27] that they can that they can learn from
[1:23:29] the scratch they know that they are part
[1:23:31] of Christ they are part of brother Jack
[1:23:34] Ministry just like he's not the only one
[1:23:36] it's just he's passing the Baton to them
[1:23:38] so even as children they can do the
[1:23:41] little things that they can do and that
[1:23:43] will keep them growing that I'm part of
[1:23:44] the church I can I can stram on the
[1:23:46] guitar I can I can play torine I can
[1:23:49] sing I can dance and their church choir
[1:23:52] is like three generation
[1:23:55] the pastors his children he has a
[1:23:57] triplet boys and one of them is the song
[1:23:59] leader and then their children the
[1:24:01] little ones they are part of the church
[1:24:03] choir so when they are singing the the
[1:24:05] first generation Second Generation and
[1:24:08] the little ones they were all part of
[1:24:09] the singing it's just I said God is good
[1:24:12] I've learned this this is great because
[1:24:15] children are part of the Jesus said that
[1:24:17] let the children come unto me for their
[1:24:19] angel their theophanies see the face of
[1:24:22] my father and so the children are part
[1:24:24] of the services of the Lord amen Glory
[1:24:27] Hallelujah we thank the Lord so I when I
[1:24:31] went I didn't have a sermon sometime the
[1:24:33] Lord has taught me that so I don't worry
[1:24:34] when I don't have a sermon before going
[1:24:37] sometime the sermon is waiting for you
[1:24:39] where you going to preach so I went I
[1:24:41] didn't have a the pastor asked me do you
[1:24:42] want to preach Saturday I said I think
[1:24:44] I'll do Sunday cuz I'm just worn out two
[1:24:46] days I haven't had sleep so I need to
[1:24:48] kind of kind of I mean uh get my
[1:24:51] strength back and then we can do Sunday
[1:24:53] so Saturday one brother was preaching
[1:24:55] from Colombia and as he was preaching
[1:24:57] that's where the title uh eternity is
[1:25:00] here what are you here for and I was
[1:25:03] just looking and just came just like
[1:25:04] that and I told one Pastor from Cancun I
[1:25:07] said brother brother John I've got my
[1:25:08] seron now I believe I've got what I'm
[1:25:10] going to preach tomorrow so we preach
[1:25:13] just I don't have the pictures to show
[1:25:15] you but I'll just just describe it as
[1:25:17] much as I can we preach I preach uh the
[1:25:20] Sunday morning and I preach on the title
[1:25:23] that I give it to you eternity is here
[1:25:26] what are you here for so I give the mic
[1:25:28] to some of the people like tell me
[1:25:30] brother Mark tell me what are you here
[1:25:32] for tell me what are you here for and
[1:25:34] everybody give their answer most of them
[1:25:36] and so God has got a purpose for your
[1:25:39] life am I'm not talking about just
[1:25:41] coming to church but your life on Earth
[1:25:44] eternity is here on Earth it is working
[1:25:47] around you but what are you here on
[1:25:49] Earth for church we spend like two at
[1:25:52] most 3 hours here but what are you here
[1:25:54] on this Earth for amen so after my
[1:25:56] testimony I'll go to that amen Glory
[1:25:59] Hallelujah and so we preach I just had
[1:26:01] one two scriptures Psalm
[1:26:04] 50:5 and Isaiah 2:2 Mountain on top of
[1:26:08] the mountain I talk about the Covenant
[1:26:11] the Lord made through the major Covenant
[1:26:13] we have in the Bible the law started
[1:26:15] from actually Adam because God gave
[1:26:17] condition to Adam that's right if you do
[1:26:18] this I'll do this if you don't do this
[1:26:20] so that was a covenant of law but then
[1:26:22] Moses was the one that was chosen to
[1:26:24] write it put it into writing and to
[1:26:26] establish it so the law ran through the
[1:26:28] Old Testament the law was like the male
[1:26:31] form the policeman that will arrest you
[1:26:33] for all the things that you do wrong
[1:26:35] right there was no Grace in the law amen
[1:26:37] but then the Lord would bring another
[1:26:38] attribute in the New Testament called
[1:26:41] Grace Grace is the mother the father and
[1:26:44] the mother amen and Grace and law
[1:26:47] combined you get the origin you get love
[1:26:50] love is the one that existed before the
[1:26:52] foundation of the world all those
[1:26:53] attributes in us but there's no law in
[1:26:56] eternity nobody does wrong in eternity
[1:26:59] nobody smokes drinks over speed to put a
[1:27:03] law there that you can't dream the
[1:27:04] Angels cannot fly at certain distance
[1:27:07] there not it doesn't exist right brother
[1:27:09] because there's no sin right there's no
[1:27:12] unbelief there's no doubt there's no
[1:27:14] Disobedience amen so those attribute of
[1:27:17] sorry Grace was in eternity but not it
[1:27:20] couldn't manifest in eternity cuz
[1:27:22] there's nobody to receive Grace theis
[1:27:25] don't need Grace they don't sin they
[1:27:28] don't even understand what is sin our
[1:27:30] civilization here is different from what
[1:27:32] is on the other side amen amen like
[1:27:35] faith we have to have faith to get
[1:27:38] things done Angels do not have to have
[1:27:41] faith it's just part of their life it's
[1:27:44] just like it's part of your life to be a
[1:27:45] human being to eat faith is just it's
[1:27:48] just all over so we have to go from our
[1:27:51] Dimension to deep into that dimension
[1:27:54] and bring the faith into manifestation
[1:27:57] but Angels don't have to have faith amen
[1:28:00] it's just part of their lives if an
[1:28:02] angel of the Lord a theop want to move
[1:28:04] from here to Canada he doesn't have to
[1:28:06] buy ticket be on the flight he just
[1:28:09] break himself down and he in Canada
[1:28:11] that's right if Angel of the Lord has to
[1:28:12] be in Russia the angel has to just by
[1:28:15] thought he's in Russia amen if he has to
[1:28:17] change himself into the shape of a sheep
[1:28:20] their bodies are just Eternal wow the
[1:28:22] clo they wear is not like our cloth that
[1:28:25] we pick from here angel of the Lord
[1:28:27] let's say brother brother Solomon
[1:28:28] sitting there his cloth is part of him
[1:28:32] amen his cloth is seamless it doesn't
[1:28:34] have crisis because it's part of his
[1:28:36] body and he can change the cloth into
[1:28:38] Jans into whatever form he can be he can
[1:28:42] change into into into pill of fire pill
[1:28:45] of smoke into rainbow into into whatever
[1:28:48] any form that the angel of the Lord the
[1:28:50] theop because it doesn't have the
[1:28:51] limitations of the flesh
[1:28:54] amen but then the same faith is for us
[1:28:58] and we have to reach out to grab that
[1:28:59] faith and to bring it into manifestation
[1:29:02] sir glory to the Lord Almighty so we
[1:29:05] talk about how Grace H came after the
[1:29:08] law yes sir and then that was from time
[1:29:10] of Jesus Jesus broke the grace remember
[1:29:13] how he gave the woman at the well he
[1:29:16] gave her grace H the woman the The
[1:29:18] Prostitute that he met at Simon's house
[1:29:21] he gave he gave her grace so he brought
[1:29:23] Grace and then the grace was an answer
[1:29:26] to the law but before Grace Grace is
[1:29:28] you've really done something wrong but
[1:29:30] Grace is being extended to you right you
[1:29:32] deserve to go to jail but then the judge
[1:29:34] is giving you Grace but then love sweeps
[1:29:38] away everything amen love is you live
[1:29:40] beyond law and Grace all right so Isaiah
[1:29:44] chapter 2 said there's a mountain in the
[1:29:46] last that will be established on top of
[1:29:48] the on on top of the mountain there's a
[1:29:50] higher Covenant that is beyond law the
[1:29:53] Old Testament and and Grace the New
[1:29:55] Testament That's The Testament the Lord
[1:29:57] broke it to William Braham to give it to
[1:29:59] you and I is a covenant of love amen
[1:30:02] love divine for you that you God bring
[1:30:04] you out of your condemnation and put you
[1:30:07] in a standard where things that you used
[1:30:10] to do is below you amen yes sir you
[1:30:12] don't go back to eat your vomit anymore
[1:30:15] that's right because the Lord has
[1:30:16] cleansed you from that vomit and you
[1:30:18] live that vomit life and then you live a
[1:30:21] life Sanctified holy life of Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ
[1:30:24] glory to the Lord Almighty amen so I
[1:30:27] preach and after that I give it some
[1:30:29] testimonies and how the trip went and
[1:30:32] after the brother said said brother do
[1:30:34] you know you preached for 3 hours I said
[1:30:35] I didn't have an idea I didn't know say
[1:30:37] you preached 3 hours the first one hour
[1:30:39] was when you talking about the trip how
[1:30:41] the Lord made the way all the obstacles
[1:30:43] but the second two hours were absolutely
[1:30:45] not you you were somebody else took over
[1:30:48] I could feel it I could see I saw myself
[1:30:50] diminishing wow when I enter the channel
[1:30:53] because the Brothers they pray they
[1:30:55] prayed and the expectations and I preach
[1:30:58] only one sermon wow I bought ticket
[1:31:00] traveled pay over $1,000 to preach one
[1:31:04] sermon Sunday morning 3 hours and then
[1:31:06] return I think on the Tuesday but after
[1:31:09] I preach One Pastor from Peru when I I
[1:31:12] said brother it looks like I know you
[1:31:13] but I don't really I'm not sure whether
[1:31:15] we are friends maybe in technology I
[1:31:17] don't know but you look very familiar
[1:31:19] maybe I saw you before the foundation of
[1:31:20] the world you look very familiar to me
[1:31:22] he said brother before I came I came for
[1:31:26] this trip there was a quat I've never
[1:31:28] seen it in in the message before the
[1:31:30] Lord open my eyes to it and probably
[1:31:32] I'll let us bring that quot if just for
[1:31:34] I'm not preaching on that but just to
[1:31:36] show you that when the Lord put
[1:31:37] something on your heart do it amen and
[1:31:40] I'll bring it to the seron that I'll
[1:31:41] preach I'm not going to keep you long
[1:31:43] but I want to just line some things up
[1:31:45] for us amen that the Lord has you here
[1:31:48] on this Earth for a purpose some of you
[1:31:50] are the only person the Lord has called
[1:31:52] in your family and reveal Jesus Christ
[1:31:55] in the form of William Brams may it to
[1:31:57] you amen there's nobody in your family
[1:31:59] that believe anything like you amen
[1:32:01] maybe somebody they are not even
[1:32:02] Christians but the Lord has made you a
[1:32:04] Christian and it's not easy for you but
[1:32:07] you are the light you are Jesus Christ
[1:32:09] to the rest of the family exactly right
[1:32:11] you are the first fruits the Lord is
[1:32:13] using to wave you in your family to
[1:32:16] bring the rest of them to Christ amen

[1:32:56] 24 paragraph 34 yeah
[1:33:00] 6161 December 24th says we see Jesus and
[1:33:04] it's paragraph 34 amen so God has got a
[1:33:07] purpose the Pastor said brother I
[1:33:09] reached was talking about the three
[1:33:10] Testament of the Lord he said brother
[1:33:12] I've never seen that quote in the
[1:33:14] message but just before coming a couple
[1:33:16] of weeks I just ran into that quot and
[1:33:18] said what does it mean I don't have an
[1:33:20] idea and you just came from United
[1:33:22] States and preached
[1:33:24] under the three Covenant of the Lord
[1:33:26] praise the Lord
[1:33:32] hallelujah yes he said when I see what
[1:33:34] those men and women went through to went
[1:33:37] through with back there and see to
[1:33:39] maintain this same gospel and when they
[1:33:42] preach and when they preach he said men
[1:33:44] and women and said they preach so not
[1:33:47] only the men doesn't mean that women
[1:33:49] come to the puet no he's talking about
[1:33:50] preaching with your life amen we all
[1:33:53] preach with our lives men and women
[1:33:55] alike amen the F for ministri is for the
[1:33:58] men but then when it come to preaching
[1:34:00] with our life which is even greater than
[1:34:02] the great than standing here everybody
[1:34:04] preach with their life so he said what
[1:34:06] they went through to maintain this same
[1:34:08] gospel and when they preach uh this
[1:34:11] gospel the same thing that happened in
[1:34:13] the Old Testament New Testament and then
[1:34:15] it just exactly the same so that gives
[1:34:17] it one two three Witnesses every word is
[1:34:22] established the same God that
[1:34:25] that dealt with the old Prophet dealt
[1:34:27] with the apostles and dealt with the
[1:34:29] Prancing Brethren and here is here he is
[1:34:32] today dealing the same with his people
[1:34:35] with the same signs same wonders same
[1:34:37] gospel same power same God everything
[1:34:39] with three as a witness to us that this
[1:34:42] is the truth this is the truth God given
[1:34:45] it in three Testament see that is
[1:34:48] history and said let's go a little bit
[1:34:50] further said the Bible so God is deing
[1:34:52] with three Testament so your Testament
[1:34:54] we are Beyond first and New Testament
[1:34:57] and we're going to see here what the
[1:34:58] prophet said paragraph 36 said the Bible
[1:35:00] is the history of what God was see the
[1:35:04] history of the Old Testament the New
[1:35:06] Testament is the history of the New
[1:35:08] Testament amen so from Paul to to to
[1:35:13] seven Church ages the New Testament was
[1:35:15] history he said 308 said and then n and
[1:35:17] the nen Council and fathers and post nen
[1:35:21] council is the history of the church
[1:35:23] then and now history is making on just
[1:35:26] as it was which this history will never
[1:35:29] be written no is too close to the coming
[1:35:32] now and I think I'll probably uh leave
[1:35:35] it there amen so God has got three
[1:35:38] Testament the law Grace and love amen
[1:35:41] the Old Testament the New Testament is
[1:35:43] that is a history it's just history we
[1:35:46] are beyond the New Testament said said
[1:35:48] if God did it to pause people how much
[1:35:50] more us so you you are a higher Cen
[1:35:54] than Paul that's why Paul said that
[1:35:56] there are certain things that we see
[1:35:58] through glass dimly when I was a child I
[1:36:02] I spoke like a child but when he which
[1:36:04] is perfect is come everything will be
[1:36:06] unveiled and the Perfection came at the
[1:36:08] end of the seven Church ages where God
[1:36:10] sent a prophet to unveil the mind of God
[1:36:13] completely to us amen it's not about
[1:36:15] William Braham it's not about brother
[1:36:17] Jack it's not about quu it's about
[1:36:20] Christ and you personally amen it's not
[1:36:24] about what you read on the internet what
[1:36:25] somebody says about William Braham or
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ or message that is
[1:36:30] somebody's thinking but what has God
[1:36:32] revealed to you about the message of the
[1:36:34] hour amen have you received the Holy
[1:36:37] Ghost through this message I don't think
[1:36:39] you can leave this message if you have
[1:36:40] the Holy Ghost if God deals with you
[1:36:43] personally it's not a church coming
[1:36:45] right it's a calling personally to
[1:36:48] you that call you personally and reveal
[1:36:51] himself to you amen but if you come int
[1:36:54] and you just join a church then somebody
[1:36:57] can Offset you and you
[1:37:01] go yes
[1:37:04] sir it was revealed to Ruth something
[1:37:07] about Naomi and Israel and even Naomi
[1:37:11] couldn't separate Ruth from her amen
[1:37:14] because it was a personal revelation to
[1:37:16] Ruth but for a sister-in-law Opa it was
[1:37:19] an intellectual so she gave Naomi a kiss
[1:37:22] and returned to idol worship by you who
[1:37:25] has been called the Bible say many are
[1:37:27] called but few are chosen if you are one
[1:37:29] of the chosen that Jesus Christ not
[1:37:31] William Braham you never saw William
[1:37:34] Braham but Jesus Christ himself revealed
[1:37:36] himself to you through the message that
[1:37:38] he sent nothing can dissuade you amen
[1:37:42] amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord so the
[1:37:45] Pastor said brother I read this quotes
[1:37:48] just a couple weeks before coming and I
[1:37:50] didn't have an idea and the Lord sent
[1:37:52] you here he said brother he put his arm
[1:37:54] around he said come to Peru and preach
[1:37:56] this gospel we need in Peru and I Lord I
[1:37:59] know why I had to pay $1,000 and just
[1:38:02] fight my way through to go to Mexico to
[1:38:04] preach one sermon and return back to the
[1:38:07] US but that's the what in doing the will
[1:38:09] of the Lord sometime it's easy to do
[1:38:12] things sometimes when the Lord try you
[1:38:14] like Abraham had only one sonow that he
[1:38:17] pray for 25 years for him and Sarah to
[1:38:20] get her son and the Lord said Abraham
[1:38:22] take your son Isaac and go sacrifice him
[1:38:25] for me will you do
[1:38:27] that if you can't even believe his word
[1:38:30] how can you sacrifice your
[1:38:32] son I in one sense is not easy but one
[1:38:35] sense is easy nobody's going to kill you
[1:38:37] when you believe Jesus Christ you can
[1:38:39] even go and stand and preach Jesus
[1:38:41] Christ nobody will nobody doesn't nobody
[1:38:44] cares but in certain times to mention
[1:38:47] the name of Jesus Christ could be a
[1:38:49] death warrant that's right that's right
[1:38:51] they can open the womb of your wife
[1:38:53] yeah and ask you to laugh if you don't
[1:38:56] laugh they cut your head or they throw
[1:38:58] you to Lions to eat you up they can kill
[1:39:00] your husband and ask you to denounce
[1:39:02] Jesus Christ that's right and those
[1:39:04] women were going into those uh death
[1:39:07] with singing with rejoicing with praises
[1:39:10] that they are even counted worthy to die
[1:39:13] for Jesus Christ that is what God is
[1:39:16] asking us to do is asking you to live
[1:39:18] for him he died for us but asking us to
[1:39:22] live he want to borrow your flesh and
[1:39:24] living his life to reflect himself in
[1:39:27] your flesh and that is why we need one
[1:39:30] thing the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:34] without that we are not going
[1:39:35] nowhere we can believe all we want we
[1:39:38] can shout all we want but if you don't
[1:39:40] have the Christ on the
[1:39:42] inside the control tower to control your
[1:39:45] flesh to direct you anything can blow
[1:39:48] you around Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:39:51] so I think that is Jalem SE
[1:39:54] glory to the Lord and and it was just
[1:39:56] amazing and the brother the pastor was
[1:39:58] his heart was fulfilled and I realized
[1:40:00] that God put upon his heart so he said
[1:40:03] brother you don't know what it means to
[1:40:05] us for you to be here it means a whole
[1:40:08] lot and when you the the songs the song
[1:40:10] that they sing will lift you up from
[1:40:11] your chair wow I dance like I never
[1:40:14] danced
[1:40:16] before they are worship and the songs oh
[1:40:18] my goodness when they sang in I said
[1:40:20] Lord I can't I'm going to be like David
[1:40:25] praise God David Dan and took his outer
[1:40:28] garment it doesn't mean he didn't stri
[1:40:30] himself naked but in the East they have
[1:40:32] outer and inner garment it's just like
[1:40:34] having your jacket and then your shirt
[1:40:36] and and pants so David took his jacket
[1:40:38] outer garment and just dance to the Lord
[1:40:40] amen and so when it calls for it just
[1:40:43] praise the Lord amen if you can dance in
[1:40:46] clap to to praise the devil when you get
[1:40:49] converted why can't you dance to praise
[1:40:51] the Lord hallelujah

[1:40:56] Jackson when you were in the world why
[1:40:59] can't you dance to praise the living
[1:41:01] Christ why are you shy about your
[1:41:03] brother and your sister Just Dance your
[1:41:05] brother can follow you up amen if you
[1:41:08] feel like dance dance if you feel like
[1:41:10] shouting shout if you feel like praising
[1:41:12] the Lord praise the Lord if you feel
[1:41:14] like saying hallelujah say hallelujah if
[1:41:16] you feel like amen say Amen you are free

[1:41:23] your home in your kitchen in your living

[1:41:30] rejoice I have my little tambourine when

[1:41:52] Lord Glory so I can take my sometime I
[1:41:56] take my tambourine and just rejoice and
[1:41:58] praise the Lord and just thank the Lord
[1:42:01] amen just the lord loves when you love
[1:42:04] him we only want to receive the love
[1:42:07] from the Lord sometime we use the Lord
[1:42:10] people write a prayer request pray for
[1:42:12] me when they are in need when they are
[1:42:14] sick but they don't want to give their
[1:42:16] heart to the
[1:42:17] Lord amen right we are using him when we
[1:42:20] need him it's just like somebody who
[1:42:22] doesn't care about you oh brother give
[1:42:24] me some money you give it to him you won
[1:42:25] hear for him 3 month give me some money

[1:42:32] family he only calls you send you
[1:42:35] message when he need
[1:42:37] dollars that is using the person and
[1:42:39] some of us are like that to the Lord we
[1:42:42] use him and the Lord out of his kindness
[1:42:44] he gives and gives and gives and gives
[1:42:48] but one day you're not going to use the
[1:42:50] Lord
[1:42:50] anymore and I want to come to if I
[1:42:53] should call it a sermon that's what I
[1:42:55] want to preach and I want my second
[1:42:57] let's go to Isaiah chapter 2 sorry
[1:43:00] chapter 60: one and two I think one and
[1:43:03] two would do prise God Isaiah chapter 60
[1:43:06] in my country Ghana when you preach they
[1:43:09] categorize your someone into three three
[1:43:12] areas they either call it oh the brother
[1:43:14] the pastor preach a Faith Message preach
[1:43:17] fa to to elevate the people or they will
[1:43:20] say You Preach you preach a life message
[1:43:22] something that touches on on life or you
[1:43:24] preach a mystery and I just want to
[1:43:26] spend a little time to talk about life
[1:43:28] I'm not going to speak any mystery but I
[1:43:30] want to hit on life with something that
[1:43:32] happened to a brother uh recently amen
[1:43:36] that our decision here being here is a
[1:43:39] privilege Amen Brother come on God
[1:43:41] calling you to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:43:44] my brother my sister is a privilege amen
[1:43:47] and your life the skin that you wear in
[1:43:50] actuality is not for you it's a borrowed
[1:43:53] vessel that you're going to use on this
[1:43:55] Earth amen up to a
[1:43:58] time and God has a purpose Eternal
[1:44:01] purpose for your life yes sir which you
[1:44:04] have to recognize and accept glory god
[1:44:07] to fulfill that purpose amen and some do
[1:44:10] not accept that purpose do they
[1:44:12] recognize it and unfortunately their
[1:44:15] lives are cut short before the allotted
[1:44:18] time wow and I don't think it's the Lord
[1:44:19] who cut your life short but the devil
[1:44:22] cut your life and I I will break it down
[1:44:24] for you amen let's read Isaiah chapter
[1:44:27] 60 if somebody has opened it you can
[1:44:29] read it for me oh okay it's right here
[1:44:34] put arise Shine for that light is come
[1:44:37] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:44:40] thee please continue for Behold The
[1:44:44] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[1:44:46] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[1:44:49] rise upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:44:51] seen upon thee
[1:44:55] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:44:58] Earth and gross Darkness to people but
[1:45:00] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[1:45:03] glory shall be seen upon thee praise to
[1:45:07] the Lord so what is the darkness part
[1:45:10] when you talk about darkness is
[1:45:12] death death has got sin
[1:45:16] unbelief torment it's all encapsulate as
[1:45:20] one darkness and the light
[1:45:23] is what Christ it's life eternal two
[1:45:27] things that we have to make a choice to
[1:45:29] pick one of
[1:45:30] them if you don't pick the other one the
[1:45:33] other one is a default if you you refuse
[1:45:36] Darkness you default to life if you
[1:45:39] refuse life the default is death and
[1:45:42] darkness and that's where the word is
[1:45:44] amen there's Darkness upon the Earth
[1:45:47] there's death upon the Earth in politics
[1:45:50] in religion all over around the world
[1:45:53] the only life is in Christ Jesus amen
[1:45:56] amen blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:45:58] God has given you brother Maris thank
[1:46:00] you for your song he said I don't want
[1:46:01] to chase uh what the world chases is
[1:46:04] that right take first things first that
[1:46:07] is take Christ first amen amen it's just
[1:46:10] right on time amen so make sure you take
[1:46:13] life first because this life that you
[1:46:15] have is Grace it's a borrowed Glory you
[1:46:19] might think you're going to live 100
[1:46:20] years as was saying that we give human
[1:46:23] given 70 years and everything after that
[1:46:26] is Grace you might not know when your
[1:46:29] time and my time will come the Lord has
[1:46:31] given you Grace to accept him life
[1:46:34] eternal into your heart amen but if you
[1:46:37] choose to refuse light then Darkness
[1:46:40] rest in your heart Darkness come upon
[1:46:43] you right there's a brother somewhere
[1:46:46] who recently passed away he gave his
[1:46:49] life to the Lord he pick the message
[1:46:52] going to church even through him that's
[1:46:54] why I was talking about it turn it you
[1:46:56] know how I preached in Mexico is going
[1:46:58] to be a little different here amen
[1:47:01] because God has got exactly what he need
[1:47:03] for this local assembly what they needed
[1:47:05] was given to them and sometime I see
[1:47:07] preach messages like token I think five
[1:47:10] times but if you follow the track of the
[1:47:12] message it's the same line of thought
[1:47:14] but different places that he preached I
[1:47:15] think California Jasonville it went
[1:47:18] around different because the local need
[1:47:20] of the church is different from what is
[1:47:22] in
[1:47:23] what is in Indiana amen so there's
[1:47:26] something that I think the Lord is
[1:47:27] pushing my heart ordinary I wouldn't
[1:47:29] preach I'll leave brother Jack to preach
[1:47:31] that sermon he's the pastor but I I'll
[1:47:33] preach it as an advice I'll call it a
[1:47:35] life message or an advice that if you
[1:47:38] are not if you have not given your heart
[1:47:41] fully to the Lord my brother my sister
[1:47:44] give your heart fully to the Lord I'm
[1:47:46] not going to preach no mystery but I'm
[1:47:48] going to touch something I will touch on
[1:47:49] our life that if you have not amen
[1:47:52] giving this life to the Lord Jesus
[1:47:55] Christ to be the control tower give it
[1:47:57] to him amen because sitting here is a
[1:48:00] privilege hearing this gospel is a
[1:48:03] privilege having a pastor is a privilege
[1:48:06] having Godly Parents is a privilege
[1:48:09] having people Elders around you is a
[1:48:11] privilege but if you don't take that
[1:48:14] privilege as a Grace as a love as what
[1:48:17] God has planted in your life and you
[1:48:19] walk over it today walk over it next
[1:48:21] year one day will come you woke over it
[1:48:23] the last time amen so this young brother
[1:48:26] to pck the message and through him he
[1:48:28] had wife and children even he dedicated
[1:48:31] his children in the church in the
[1:48:32] message he he was coming from a Muslim
[1:48:34] background not a practicing Muslim so
[1:48:37] they pray they don't practice it but
[1:48:38] they were like generally coming from
[1:48:39] Muslim so he came to church his cousin
[1:48:42] received the message and then they
[1:48:44] receive it and this brother's younger
[1:48:46] brother received it he likes to
[1:48:47] evangelize and likes to preach so this
[1:48:50] brother dedicated his children to the
[1:48:51] Lord coming with wife but somewhere
[1:48:54] along the line he stopped going to
[1:48:56] church wow of course anybody can get
[1:48:58] discouraged even Jesus got discouraged
[1:49:01] when he wanted to go to Calvary so Moses
[1:49:03] and Elijah Angels Came to strengthen him
[1:49:05] so there's nothing wrong if you get
[1:49:06] discourage that's why B Orin brother
[1:49:10] brother brother Troy and brother brother
[1:49:12] SM Simba right and brothers and
[1:49:15] sisters will encourage you so pastors
[1:49:18] Brothers ministers went to encourage him
[1:49:20] brother I mean what's going on what the
[1:49:22] problem
[1:49:23] and it went on for couple years now he
[1:49:25] took to drinking a friend will come with
[1:49:27] motorbike and pick him and they go drink
[1:49:30] he's got wife and four children they go
[1:49:32] drink and have so-called good time and
[1:49:35] he kept going so he got to a place they
[1:49:37] desire even to visit him was gone
[1:49:38] because he didn't want anybody to come
[1:49:40] around him he just chosen that path his
[1:49:43] younger brother everybody his father who
[1:49:45] are not even messy Believers because he
[1:49:47] was like a lie to the parents and
[1:49:49] through him the parents are getting
[1:49:50] closer they begin to lie the message but
[1:49:53] he went straight back to the to the
[1:49:55] world and a couple of just like probably
[1:49:58] less than two weeks his friend he was
[1:50:01] even according to the father he was a
[1:50:02] little bit drunk when his friend came to
[1:50:04] pick him with his motorbike they went to

[1:56:53] your life that angel is Holy the moment
[1:56:55] you start drinking the first time you

[1:57:37] pleasure flesh things of the flesh the
[1:57:40] lust of the flesh the pride of life and
[1:57:43] the Wess of the spirit so you want to do
[1:57:45] your drugs you want to drink your
[1:57:46] alcohol and then the angel of the Lord
[1:57:48] is way away from you he doesn't it's not
[1:57:51] like he on the
[1:57:52] us to illustrate when you offend the
[1:57:54] angel or when you do something evil the
[1:57:56] angel will just like be on the tree when
[1:57:58] you repent it come no this not he's gone
[1:58:01] and tell the Lord your son your daughter
[1:58:04] doesn't listen and then the death angel
[1:58:08] will just come now that is what he
[1:58:09] wanted to do the ultimate is to kill you
[1:58:12] sometime not only killing you
[1:58:13] spiritually you already been dead all
[1:58:16] along but finally he want to slaughter
[1:58:18] you and death overtake you when you Le
[1:58:21] his
[1:58:22] just like my pre that brother was in my
[1:58:24] church in Ghana he wasn't somebody
[1:58:26] stranger to me and I said this when I
[1:58:28] heard it I said the brother is very
[1:58:29] quiet he doesn't he he wasn't he was not
[1:58:31] even drinking when he was in the world
[1:58:33] but then when he received Christ and he
[1:58:36] didn't receive the fullness of Christ he
[1:58:39] didn't go to see the Holy Spirit and he
[1:58:41] wouldn't come to church doesn't want
[1:58:42] nothing he's got his friend that they
[1:58:44] ride motorbike and go do their drinking
[1:58:47] he never expect that he was going to
[1:58:49] drink and they were going to death wow
[1:58:52] so my brother my sister do not joke with
[1:58:56] God God is Not
[1:58:59] mocked if you want to if you choose
[1:59:01] death choose death and you know that
[1:59:03] death is waiting for you sometime the
[1:59:05] time the Lord has allotted for you won't
[1:59:07] fulfill it you are destroying your
[1:59:09] organs with alcohol even people that
[1:59:11] live healthy life look at the food they
[1:59:13] make for us they put so much hormone in
[1:59:15] the food that the food that we supposed
[1:59:17] to eat and grow healthy the food is
[1:59:20] killing us how much more you plus
[1:59:22] putting drugs alcohol um uh fent what's
[1:59:25] the name of that drug F fentol and
[1:59:28] things into your system you are directly
[1:59:30] destroying your life and the demon
[1:59:33] demonic Spirit angels of death they will
[1:59:35] push you drink more alcohol take more
[1:59:38] drugs and you die people down on the
[1:59:40] streets so brother my sister I know a
[1:59:43] brother I was a student this brother
[1:59:46] went to Japan he was smart when I mean
[1:59:49] technology he knows them way said i' I
[1:59:51] don't even use it I have in first second
[1:59:53] third I don't use it second and third he
[1:59:55] knows technology just like that and the
[1:59:57] problem is alcohol a pastor gave him a
[2:00:00] place to leave even the pastor's own
[2:00:02] place he'll still sneak and go and drink
[2:00:04] alcohol and then he left and one
[2:00:07] evangelist gave him a place he has a
[2:00:08] shop made a shop for him like Hey do
[2:00:11] your your repair stuff and then get your
[2:00:13] daily bread he will still sneak and go
[2:00:15] and drink alcohol even student help him
[2:00:18] he how he died he died they have to use
[2:00:21] trash card take him and bury him he died
[2:00:24] they found him somewhere so if you don't
[2:00:26] let God take over your life if you don't
[2:00:29] see the Holy Spirit and you just be
[2:00:32] walking about in church going and coming
[2:00:34] without having Christ taking that
[2:00:36] decision to I want people don't love the
[2:00:38] Lord some people they just use the Lord
[2:00:41] right they don't even want to be
[2:00:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:44] Christ right right they don't want to be
[2:00:46] called seen as Christians outside if
[2:00:49] they have a need they come to CH to get
[2:00:50] healing they come to chch to get the job
[2:00:53] they come to church to get whatever they
[2:00:54] need but then they go back to the world
[2:00:56] they don't want to be seen as Christians
[2:00:58] they don't want they don't love Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ and you have to fall in love with
[2:01:02] him it's a marriage just like naturally
[2:01:04] you see a woman or a man and fall in
[2:01:06] love with him or her same thing
[2:01:08] spiritually you as a human being not
[2:01:10] everything God will come and scoop you
[2:01:11] and and do for you he's make giv you a
[2:01:15] choice to make your choice to love him
[2:01:19] to receive him for him to have
[2:01:21] preeminent in your life just like a man
[2:01:24] leads the wife with love God will lead
[2:01:26] you with love but if you don't love the
[2:01:28] Lord and you want to go in the world you
[2:01:31] let the things of the world H the pride
[2:01:34] of life Paul put it in that form the
[2:01:37] Wess of this life the lust of the flesh
[2:01:40] sex and and and drugs yes those that
[2:01:44] give you
[2:01:44] satisfaction you are digging your
[2:01:46] graveyard you are digging six foot to
[2:01:49] deep yourself in that's right and this
[2:01:51] is this is a real we are real time human
[2:01:53] beings we need to make real times
[2:01:56] decision for the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:58] because as the life Angel is going about
[2:02:00] the camp Death Angel is roing and who to
[2:02:05] to to devour if you let him so I'm not
[2:02:08] going to pre too long like I said I just
[2:02:09] want to advise I'm preaching just a live
[2:02:11] message and just a little advice that
[2:02:14] maybe it's for somebody is for all of us
[2:02:18] that let us young people receive the
[2:02:20] Holy Spirit let that become your desire
[2:02:24] don't just like to be appeared beautiful
[2:02:26] and nice but have the beauty of Christ
[2:02:28] on the
[2:02:29] inside don't just come with your parents
[2:02:32] go back and forth it's a personal
[2:02:34] decision that your pastor cannot make it
[2:02:36] for you you have to make your own
[2:02:39] decision to receive the Lord Jesus
[2:02:41] Christ you have to have the desire that
[2:02:44] I want to be born again you have to have
[2:02:47] desire Pastor Jack I want you to pray
[2:02:49] for me brother brother Smiley I want

[2:03:08] go a time will come the devil will send
[2:03:10] a little demon that's how demons work
[2:03:12] sometime they don't throw everything at

[2:03:16] like a catching a fish you just leure
[2:03:18] the fish a little bit and the fish

[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:24] being in
[2:08:28] um in church for many of my
[2:08:33] years I know that um when God gives a
[2:08:39] minister a sermon like that he's not
[2:08:43] doing that for
[2:08:46] um just for no
[2:08:49] reason God knows that there is I'm I'm a
[2:08:53] I'm I I believe there's somebody in this
[2:08:56] room even
[2:08:58] today that God was speaking
[2:09:02] to
[2:09:04] um brother brother brother quu just you
[2:09:07] know just just being led of the spirit
[2:09:09] and and just talking about eternal life
[2:09:12] is here but what what are you doing what
[2:09:14] are you doing with it uh and I think um
[2:09:19] uh from the youngest to the oldest we
[2:09:20] have to
[2:09:22] we have to make decisions he talked
[2:09:23] about a man that was 38 years old you
[2:09:26] know what happened this man's already
[2:09:28] got married the Lord's blessed him with
[2:09:30] a a wife and he got you know he's got
[2:09:33] kids and but yet there's a pull pulling
[2:09:36] this man out into the world right and uh
[2:09:39] so the the pit pressure is something
[2:09:42] that's not only the young people facing
[2:09:45] but even older people face this right
[2:09:48] and we have to make a decision as as to
[2:09:51] whether I'm going to live for God or not
[2:09:55] all right and um um just um U no matter
[2:09:59] what age it is you have to come to the
[2:10:01] conclusion that you're going to live for
[2:10:02] god um I want to say this just as I was
[2:10:06] listening to brother brother quick who
[2:10:08] sometimes as young
[2:10:11] people we get enough Holy Ghost to
[2:10:15] satisfy Mama and
[2:10:17] Daddy I want to say that again we we get
[2:10:21] enough Holy Ghost to satisfy Mama and
[2:10:25] Daddy and and and what I mean by that we
[2:10:27] learn how we supposed to dress we know
[2:10:31] how we're supposed to act we learn all
[2:10:33] these things but deep down on the inside
[2:10:35] that that real desire to serve God is
[2:10:38] just not there and uh and what you have
[2:10:40] to come up with is not something that's
[2:10:42] just going to please Mom and Daddy cuz
[2:10:44] Mom and Daddy Ain't Got No Heaven or
[2:10:45] Hell to put you in right you have to
[2:10:48] come to a decision that I'm going to
[2:10:50] serve God regardless of what my mom and
[2:10:53] daddy do right and you got to come to a
[2:10:55] spot where you love God more than what
[2:10:58] Mom and Daddy love God but um I I
[2:11:01] believe the Holy
[2:11:03] Spirit I believe the holy spirit spok
[2:11:06] amen through brother quu today the
[2:11:09] scripture tells us
[2:11:12] this as many as believed on
[2:11:15] him to them he gave power to become Sons
[2:11:20] and Daughters of God and uh and I want
[2:11:23] to just say if you would just yield your
[2:11:26] heart to the Lord just a a simple prayer
[2:11:30] amen God I know that you were speaking
[2:11:32] to me thank you for warning me today
[2:11:34] because you know what you could leave
[2:11:35] here and go out there and do exactly
[2:11:37] what that man was doing and lose your
[2:11:41] life you can lose your life just that
[2:11:44] fast and uh one thing I found about a
[2:11:47] death death don't have age limits to it
[2:11:50] it's it's not just for the old people
[2:11:53] but death comes if you just pick up your
[2:11:54] newspaper and read the obituaries
[2:11:56] there's young people dying every day
[2:11:58] right and uh and and you know there
[2:12:01] there's some sometimes you look at some
[2:12:02] of the older sanction like when my you
[2:12:05] know if uh like he said after the 70 is
[2:12:07] just Grace right and so many of our
[2:12:09] Saints have already made it past 70
[2:12:11] God's been very good to them and you
[2:12:12] would think that you might you might
[2:12:14] think I got longer to live than what
[2:12:16] they got to live but some of them going
[2:12:17] to outlive
[2:12:20] you because you wouldn't yield to the
[2:12:23] Lord there's a quote that he he was it
[2:12:28] came to my mind look on the in the in
[2:12:30] the table app search just put five years
[2:12:34] from now 5 years from now just look for
[2:12:38] that and there's a quote where brother
[2:12:39] Brandon begins to talk about 5 years
[2:12:41] from now you could be here and 5 years
[2:12:44] from now you could be there and 5 years
[2:12:46] from now all because of your decision
[2:12:48] that you made today
[2:12:52] I want to just I want to find that I
[2:12:54] know if if you don't do a direct uh
[2:12:57] search you can just put 5 years from now

[2:13:46] going to say something like 5 years from

[2:13:53] here and 5 years from now it says
[2:13:56] something like that inside the quote I

[2:14:19] times in my life where I thought I was
[2:14:22] saved and I had you know made
[2:14:25] confessions and things that but my life
[2:14:27] was not lining up with what the word of
[2:14:30] God was telling me I should line up with
[2:14:34] and uh and you know when you would go
[2:14:36] through seasons of life and then you
[2:14:38] have to come back and repent all over
[2:14:39] again and then you think I got it right
[2:14:42] I got it right and then your life don't
[2:14:44] line up again uh it was
[2:14:47] only uh uh probably after the third or
[2:14:50] fourth time that I really got it right
[2:14:53] and uh and that's where I know God did
[2:14:55] something on the inside and and the
[2:14:56] desires change uh I wasn't sneaking from
