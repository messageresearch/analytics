[41:34] and I told him to lead the way.
[41:43] And though the road has been rough,
[41:48] though the going's been mighty tough,
[41:53] still I ain't going nowhere.
[41:56] I'm about here to stay.
[42:02] Though I've been talked about
[42:06] and though I've been criticized,
[42:12] I've wiped so many tears
[42:15] from my eyes.
[42:18] But that's all right cuz
[42:21] I am still
[42:25] holding
[42:27] on.

[1:10:55] they're doing. We thank you for touching
[1:10:57] her body thus far uh that she's even at
[1:11:00] a point where she can have the surgery.
[1:11:03] Lord, we know that you're in control of
[1:11:05] everything. And God, we just ask that
[1:11:07] you would help her, Father, to be made
[1:11:09] completely whole. And we know that the
[1:11:11] work of restoration is a complete work
[1:11:13] that you do. So, Father, ask that you'd
[1:11:15] move on her behalf right where she is.
[1:11:18] We pray that your presence would bring
[1:11:20] peace and Father, that you would settle
[1:11:22] their spirits. Let them know that you
[1:11:23] have everything under control. God, we
[1:11:27] give you all the glory, all the honor,
[1:11:28] and all the praise. It's in Jesus name

[1:21:33] Should we just bow our heads for a word
[1:21:35] of prayer?

[1:24:14] Without wasting any of your time, I just
[1:24:16] want us to go straight into the word.
[1:24:19] Amen.
[1:24:22] Luke chapter 24
[1:24:27] starting from verse 25
[1:24:30] the Bible reads here. Then he said unto
[1:24:33] them all fools and slow of heart to
[1:24:35] believe all that the prophets have
[1:24:37] spoken. Ought not Christ to have
[1:24:39] suffered these things and to enter into
[1:24:41] his glory. And beginning at Moses and
[1:24:44] all the prophets, he expounded unto them
[1:24:46] in all the scriptures the things
[1:24:48] concerning himself. And they drew nigh
[1:24:51] unto the village, whether they went, and
[1:24:53] he met as though he would have gone
[1:24:55] further. But they constrained him,
[1:24:57] saying, Abide with us, for it is toward
[1:25:00] evening, and the days far spent. And he
[1:25:03] went in to tar with them. And it came to
[1:25:06] pass, as he said, at meetat with them,
[1:25:08] he took bread and blessed it, and break
[1:25:11] it, and gave it to them. And their eyes
[1:25:14] were opened and they knew him and he
[1:25:18] vanished out of their sight. And they
[1:25:20] said one to another, "Did not our heart
[1:25:23] bend within us while he talked with us
[1:25:26] by the way and while he opened to us the
[1:25:30] scriptures."
[1:25:33] Revelations chapter 10 verse 7.
[1:25:38] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:25:40] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:25:43] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:25:47] finished, as he hath declared it to his
[1:25:49] servants, the prophets. We may be seated
[1:25:54] as we bow our heads.
[1:25:59] Father, we
[1:26:01] have read your word.
[1:26:03] We now come Lord
[1:26:06] to this scary part. The part that we can
[1:26:10] never be able to handle is man. Father
[1:26:13] because there is in us there's nothing
[1:26:15] in us that is able.
[1:26:18] Lord we are so unworthy
[1:26:20] but thou art worthy.
[1:26:23] So unable
[1:26:25] but thou art able. So weak but thou art
[1:26:29] strong. Father, we pray that you, the
[1:26:33] author of your word, you can step in
[1:26:35] now. Father, put me aside and Lord, may
[1:26:39] you step in and give us a message for
[1:26:41] tonight. We thank you, Lord, Father God
[1:26:44] Almighty, that you are already here with
[1:26:46] us and you are fellowshipping with us.
[1:26:49] We welcome you, great Holy Spirit.
[1:26:51] Father, begin this part with us in Jesus
[1:26:54] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:26:57] Allow me to just take off my jacket.
[1:27:14] Praise the Lord. How many are still
[1:27:17] happy tonight?
[1:27:20] Oh, not many. How many are still happy
[1:27:23] tonight?
[1:27:25] That sounds better. God bless you.
[1:27:28] Amen. I want to take a title and the
[1:27:32] title of our sermon tonight, I'm
[1:27:34] speaking on the finished mystery that
[1:27:38] defines the restored bride.
[1:27:42] Amen.
[1:27:44] Now, last night we looked at the
[1:27:46] restoration of the bride and um our
[1:27:50] subject was the bride age. Today we we
[1:27:53] want to look at the finished mystery
[1:27:56] that defines the restored bride. Amen. I
[1:28:01] hope it will make sense along the way.
[1:28:04] But um let me start by reading this
[1:28:07] quote that the prophet gives us in the
[1:28:09] message of grace. Now you
[1:28:13] I want you to put on your spiritual
[1:28:17] thinking anointing jacket
[1:28:21] this evening.
[1:28:28] Now you
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; tell your neighbor it's about you.
[1:28:36] I want you to put on your spiritual
[1:28:38] thinking,
[1:28:40] your anointing jacket.
[1:28:43] Amen. I I hope you have the anointing
[1:28:46] jacket. I hope you've got a spiritual
[1:28:49] thinking cap somewhere. Amen. As as we
[1:28:53] get into this message tonight, how many
[1:28:56] have got an anointing jacket? How many
[1:28:58] have got a spiritual thinking now? Amen.
[1:29:02] And spiritual things are spiritually
[1:29:04] designed. You got to move into a certain
[1:29:07] realm in order to understand the
[1:29:08] spiritual things. Say amen somebody.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Now we we are living in in in the days
[1:29:17] when so many critics are rising around
[1:29:20] the message.
[1:29:23] We find that people that used to preach
[1:29:25] this message are turning against this
[1:29:28] message.
[1:29:30] And yet you wonder why? What what is it
[1:29:33] that they were preaching then? And
[1:29:34] what's the reason? And to me there is
[1:29:37] only one answer. And that answer is they
[1:29:39] never had a true revelation of what this
[1:29:41] message is all about. Once you catch a
[1:29:45] real revelation of what this message is
[1:29:48] all about. Nothing can shake you out of
[1:29:51] this message.
[1:29:53] And I repeat, nothing can shake you out
[1:29:56] of this message. Do I have a witness?
[1:29:59] Nothing can shake you out of this once
[1:30:02] you get to understand what this message
[1:30:04] is all about. If you have a revelation
[1:30:06] of what this message is all about,
[1:30:09] nothing can shake you out of this
[1:30:11] message.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; But now when we see the onslaught of
[1:30:18] all these attacks that are coming on the
[1:30:20] message, as ministers, you know, we have
[1:30:23] a duty, amen, to to make the message
[1:30:26] more real before the people.
[1:30:29] We have a duty to make sure that the
[1:30:32] people are well founded in the message.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Root them deep into the message.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Get our roots to go right deep into the
[1:30:40] message. And by God's grace, that's my
[1:30:43] objective tonight. Amen. We're taking
[1:30:46] our inspiration out of Revelations
[1:30:48] chapter 10 verse number 7. Amen. Which
[1:30:51] is the scripture that we have read
[1:30:52] there. Now we we we read this scripture
[1:30:56] so many times.
[1:30:58] And the reason why we refer to this
[1:31:00] scripture so many times is because it's
[1:31:03] a central verse to us as believers of
[1:31:06] the message because right in this verse
[1:31:09] we find here the commission of the
[1:31:11] seventh angel who we know was brother
[1:31:14] William Mariam Brana. But I have a
[1:31:17] question for you tonight. And my
[1:31:19] question is, though we read this
[1:31:21] scripture so many times, though we have
[1:31:24] preached around this scripture so many
[1:31:26] times, but have you ever really looked
[1:31:28] at how this scripture is actually
[1:31:31] written?
[1:31:34] Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; It says, "But in the days of the voice
[1:31:38] of the seventh angel, when he shall
[1:31:40] begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:31:43] should be finished.
[1:31:47] And watch it says the mystery
[1:31:52] singular.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And all plural.
[1:31:58] So if we are to read this right, Amen.
[1:32:01] What shall be finished in the days of
[1:32:04] the voice of the seventh angel is not
[1:32:06] mysteries,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; but what was to be finished in the days
[1:32:12] of the seventh angel is the mystery
[1:32:15] singular
[1:32:19] and the verse is quite clear and like we
[1:32:22] saw last night, God does not play with
[1:32:24] words.
[1:32:27] He he he does not add.
[1:32:30] He does not subtract.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; He just places it exactly the way he
[1:32:35] wants it.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He knows there's mysteries plural and he
[1:32:40] knows there's mystery singular. But here
[1:32:43] he puts it as mystery singular.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; So the commission of Revelations chapter
[1:32:51] 10:7 it is to finish the mystery.
[1:32:58] And right there you see the way this
[1:33:00] verse is laid. Amen. It opens an avenue
[1:33:03] for somebody to say if brother Brham
[1:33:06] came to reveal a mystery singular
[1:33:09] therefore it means he did not reveal all
[1:33:11] the mysteries.
[1:33:15] It opens an avenue for a critic to begin
[1:33:18] to say okay so if brother Brham did not
[1:33:22] okay the commission of revelations 10:7
[1:33:24] spoke of a mystery.
[1:33:27] So if you spoke of mysteries then
[1:33:29] brother Brana made a mistake.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; It opens avenues for critics.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It can also open avenues for false
[1:33:39] prophets.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Who can come and they can say brother
[1:33:44] Brham came to review this mystery. I am
[1:33:46] sent to review this other mystery.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Watch it.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:58] So just the fact that Revelations 10:7
[1:34:01] it speaks of a singular the singular
[1:34:04] nature of Revelations 10:7 we can have a
[1:34:07] solid lesson in here tonight.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said put on your
[1:34:12] spiritual thinking.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Put your on your anointing jacket.
[1:34:18] Are you with me?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; We we have something in here that must
[1:34:22] of necessity be unraveled.
[1:34:25] Why is this singular?
[1:34:29] What exactly is this mystery that the
[1:34:31] seventh angel is to finish?
[1:34:35] But what about all the other mysteries
[1:34:37] that brother Brham spoke about that he
[1:34:39] said he came to reveal? How do we feed
[1:34:42] in all these other mysteries into this
[1:34:44] scripture which speaks of a singular
[1:34:47] mystery?
[1:34:50] We have some questions real church
[1:34:54] and these are questions that a real
[1:34:56] message student has got to look at and
[1:34:58] you've got to try and say okay so what
[1:35:00] is going on here
[1:35:03] and the next question that I can get
[1:35:05] here is so if the scripture says
[1:35:08] mysteries singular did not brother Brham
[1:35:10] take this to mean mysteries plural
[1:35:15] did he not say mysteries instead of
[1:35:18] mystery
[1:35:20] And the answer is yes, he did.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; So if he did, when the scripture says
[1:35:27] mystery, how come he ends up saying
[1:35:29] mysteries? Is he making a mistake?
[1:35:36] We have some questions to be resolved
[1:35:38] here tonight.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, we want to be able
[1:35:43] to look into this. Amen. And as as we
[1:35:46] solve this question, we will see what
[1:35:49] defines the restored bride of this hour.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me get into what the prophet of God
[1:35:56] says in the message. Is this the sign of
[1:35:58] the answer? He says, "The seventh angel
[1:36:01] of Revelations 10:7 is the seventh
[1:36:04] church age messenger." See, now watch.
[1:36:06] And in the days, now watch here. But in
[1:36:09] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:36:11] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:36:14] mystery and he quotes it right and he
[1:36:17] reads it as singular the mystery of God
[1:36:20] should be finished.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:36:25] He goes on and he says now
[1:36:28] sounding forth this messenger the
[1:36:30] seventh angel here is sounding forth his
[1:36:33] message of the ludician churches of the
[1:36:35] Lordian church. Notice this type of
[1:36:38] message now. It wasn't to the first
[1:36:41] angel wasn't given. The second angel,
[1:36:44] third, fourth, fifth, sixth, but it is
[1:36:46] the seventh angel that had this type of
[1:36:50] message. What was it? Notice his type of
[1:36:53] message. Finishing all the mysteries
[1:37:00] of God that are written in the book.
[1:37:04] The seventh angel is winding up all the
[1:37:07] mysteries.
[1:37:10] But brother Brham, you just read the
[1:37:11] verse and the verse said mystery.
[1:37:16] Where you getting the mysteries from?
[1:37:17] Now
[1:37:21] that's laying loose ended all out
[1:37:24] through these organizations and
[1:37:25] denominations. The seventh angel gathers
[1:37:28] them up and finishes the entire mystery.
[1:37:32] Then he switches back again.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. Finishes the
[1:37:40] mystery.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; But brother Brham, you have just said
[1:37:43] here mysteries, mysteries. Now you're
[1:37:45] saying finishing the mystery. What are
[1:37:47] you talking about?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham, in exactly the same
[1:37:57] paragraph, he refers to mysteries and
[1:37:59] then he switches to mystery.
[1:38:02] And he's he's got no problem in
[1:38:04] switching between mystery and mysteries.
[1:38:07] And he carries on like he has done
[1:38:09] nothing
[1:38:14] just to confound the mind
[1:38:18] of the intellectual.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; What a lesson we have here tonight,
[1:38:25] church.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; You know, I just love the word of God. I
[1:38:30] love the message of the hour.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; It gives room for some critics to find
[1:38:35] something to criticize.
[1:38:37] And I just love that. And somebody say
[1:38:40] you you you love that. Why do you love
[1:38:42] that? Because it begins to tell us who
[1:38:44] is who.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, in the word is laid
[1:38:51] some stumbling stones, some rocks of
[1:38:54] offenses that others might stumble on
[1:38:57] them.
[1:38:59] Are you with me?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Like Christ came in the book of John
[1:39:03] chapter 6 and he just threw a bombshell
[1:39:05] and he said, "Unless you eat my flesh
[1:39:07] and drink my blood, you have no part in
[1:39:09] me." He never explained it. And when he
[1:39:13] said what he said, 70 were stumbled
[1:39:16] right there and they left the message of
[1:39:18] the hour.
[1:39:20] But he turned to a Peter and he said to
[1:39:23] Peter, "Will you go also?" That's when
[1:39:26] Peter spoke those notable words and
[1:39:28] Peter spoke and he said to who shall we
[1:39:31] go seeing you alone have the words of
[1:39:34] eternal life.
[1:39:37] Now it's not that Peter understood what
[1:39:39] he was talking about. He did not
[1:39:41] understand the flesh and the eating of
[1:39:43] the flesh and the drinking of the blood.
[1:39:45] He did not understand that. But there is
[1:39:48] one thing that Peter knew that we are
[1:39:50] not called to understand. We are called
[1:39:52] to believe. Only believe. only believe.
[1:39:56] All things are possible.
[1:40:01] Well, I believe I've got some Peters in
[1:40:03] here. I believe I've got some Peters in
[1:40:06] here that can say to who shall we go see
[1:40:10] the message alone as the words of
[1:40:12] eternal life in this day and in this. Or
[1:40:14] do I have a Peter in here? If I got a
[1:40:17] Peter, shout amen.
[1:40:20] Shout amen. Shout amen. I am the Peter
[1:40:24] of today. Where can I go? To whom shall
[1:40:28] I go? Seeing the message alone has the
[1:40:31] words of eternal life.
[1:40:34] Glory to God in the eyes. Brother, let
[1:40:36] me say we are not called to understand.
[1:40:39] We are called to believe. I don't need
[1:40:42] to understand the brown bear.
[1:40:45] I don't need to have answers about the
[1:40:47] brown bear. Though we have it, but we
[1:40:50] don't need to have the answers. We don't
[1:40:52] need to have answers about why 28th of
[1:40:55] February 1963 the prophet was supposed
[1:40:58] to be out of a hunting season. We don't
[1:41:00] need to have the answers. We are called
[1:41:02] to believe though we have the answers.
[1:41:06] In case you think we are running away,
[1:41:07] we have the answers.
[1:41:10] But we are not called to have answers.
[1:41:12] We are called to believe. Or do I have a
[1:41:15] believer in here? Do I have a believer
[1:41:18] in here? Behold, I lay in Zion a
[1:41:22] stumbling stone, a rock of offense that
[1:41:26] others can stumble on it. But the to the
[1:41:29] true believer, they will still go on
[1:41:32] anyhow.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:36] Hey, the sound engineers fixed me right
[1:41:38] tonight.
[1:41:40] Thank you, sir. Let's keep it right
[1:41:42] there. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the
[1:41:48] seventh angel speaks of mysteries.
[1:41:53] Is that right?
[1:41:56] He says the seventh angel came to finish
[1:41:59] all the mysteries.
[1:42:01] And yet acknowledging the Bible says
[1:42:03] mysteries singular.
[1:42:06] Not only does he say that mysteries, but
[1:42:08] he actually goes on and he starts to
[1:42:10] name some of the mysteries
[1:42:14] in that message. He goes on and he says,
[1:42:16] "Now let's note a few of these mysteries
[1:42:19] and if you want to write them down.
[1:42:21] Number one, the mystery of the kingdom
[1:42:23] of heaven."
[1:42:25] Matthew 13:3-50.
[1:42:28] Now, second mystery is the mystery of
[1:42:30] Israel's blindness during this urge.
[1:42:34] Romans 11:25. Third, third mystery is
[1:42:37] the mystery of the translation of the
[1:42:39] living saints at the end of at the end
[1:42:41] time of this urge. 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:42:44] 14, paragraph 248, the fourth mystery of
[1:42:48] the New Testament church as one body
[1:42:51] composed of both Jews and Gentiles.
[1:42:53] Ephesians 3:1-11, Romans 16:25,
[1:42:57] Ephesians 6:19, Colossians 4:3.
[1:43:02] The fifth mystery is of the church as
[1:43:04] the bride of Christ. Ephesians 5:28-32.
[1:43:09] Sixth mystery is of the living Christ
[1:43:11] same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:43:13] Colossians 2:20 and Hebrews 13:8 and
[1:43:17] many places like that. The seventh
[1:43:19] mystery is of God even Christ as the
[1:43:22] incarnate fullness of the Godhead
[1:43:24] embodied in whom all divine wisdom and
[1:43:27] godliness is restored to a man.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity
[1:43:33] found in 2 Thessalonians. 10th mystery
[1:43:36] is of the seven stars of Revelations
[1:43:39] 120. We just been through that. The
[1:43:41] seven stars of the seven churches, the
[1:43:44] seven messages and so forth. And the
[1:43:46] 11th mystery is the mystery Babylon the
[1:43:49] prostitute. Revelation 17:5-7.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on and he says that some of
[1:43:56] the mysteries that the angel is supposed
[1:43:59] to wind up all the mystery. Hey
[1:44:05] Hey, are you catching the grammar here?
[1:44:08] That some of the mysteries that the
[1:44:10] angel is supposed to wind up all the
[1:44:13] mystery.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; How does this balance out?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:26] So we see he keeps interchanging
[1:44:30] and he keeps switching between mystery
[1:44:32] singular mysteries plural and he doesn't
[1:44:34] seem to have a problem in doing it and
[1:44:37] he just carries on anyhow.
[1:44:40] So to the prophet definitely he never
[1:44:42] had a problem here.
[1:44:45] Not only does he stop here, he then
[1:44:47] carries on and he says, "And the other,
[1:44:49] may I say this with reverence
[1:44:51] and not referring to myself, but
[1:44:54] referring to the angel of God."
[1:44:58] Glory to God.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Now, he's switching to the mysteries
[1:45:01] that he came to reveal. And he's saying
[1:45:04] now, not referring to myself, but
[1:45:07] referring to the angel of the Lord. Let
[1:45:09] me tell you this message is not just
[1:45:11] about William Marion Brana. But this
[1:45:13] message is about the angel of the Lord
[1:45:16] that came with William Marion Brana.
[1:45:19] Never a man spoke like him. He said in
[1:45:23] my many years of studying the Bible and
[1:45:25] talking with the angel of the Lord.
[1:45:28] Every other minister we study the Bible
[1:45:30] but we don't talk with the angel of the
[1:45:32] Lord. But with Malachi 4, he said, "In
[1:45:35] my many years of studying the Bible and
[1:45:38] talking with the angel of the Lord,"
[1:45:45] he says, "the serpent seed."
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; That's been a hidden mystery all through
[1:45:50] the years. The grace straightened out.
[1:45:53] Not disgrace, but real true grace.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 259. No such a things as
[1:46:01] eternal. Burning hell. You burn for
[1:46:03] millions of years, but anything that was
[1:46:06] eternal had never a beginning or an end.
[1:46:08] And hell was created. All these
[1:46:11] mysteries,
[1:46:13] the mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:15] Ghost without sensation, but the person
[1:46:17] of Christ performing in you the same
[1:46:19] works that he did, the mystery of water
[1:46:22] baptism where the extreme trinitarianism
[1:46:25] has brought it into titles, father, son,
[1:46:27] and holy ghost. and the mystery of the
[1:46:29] godhead being fulfilled in the baptism
[1:46:31] of the name of Jesus Christ. There is
[1:46:34] some of the mysteries.
[1:46:38] He's dealing with mysteries.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; But the seventh angel is come to to
[1:46:44] fulfill a mis a mystery singular.
[1:46:48] Paragraph 262 the pillar of fire
[1:46:51] returning back. Amen. And that's the
[1:46:53] thing that's supposed to take place. And
[1:46:56] we see it.
[1:46:58] Oh, I like this part.
[1:47:01] The returning of the pillar of fire. And
[1:47:03] we see it. Oh, how we could go on naming
[1:47:07] the mysteries. Seeing that pillar of
[1:47:09] fire that led the children of Israel,
[1:47:12] the same one that struck down Saul on
[1:47:14] his road down to Damascus. And the same
[1:47:17] one coming with the same power, doing
[1:47:19] the same things and revealing the same
[1:47:22] word, staying word by word with the
[1:47:25] Bible.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire that we have heard in
[1:47:33] this day returning again and we are
[1:47:36] seeing it. What did he come to do? To do
[1:47:39] exactly the same thing. Same one coming
[1:47:42] uh with the same power with the same
[1:47:44] things. I mean, doing the same things,
[1:47:47] revealing the same word, staying word by
[1:47:49] word with the Bible.
[1:47:52] And I'm here to tell you, church, that
[1:47:54] that angel of the Lord, he never left
[1:47:56] when the prophet went, but he's still on
[1:47:59] earth fixing the bride for the rapture.
[1:48:02] I believe the pillar of fire is still
[1:48:04] here. One of the fine days, amen, when
[1:48:08] he's well pleased, he can just appear in
[1:48:10] a congregation. Uh, can you say amen,
[1:48:13] somebody? You get according to your
[1:48:15] expectation. If you are expecting him to
[1:48:17] appear, you can see him one of the fine
[1:48:20] days. How many say, "I believe it."
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Because he's still on earth fixing the
[1:48:25] bride for the rapture. Say, "Amen,
[1:48:27] somebody."
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Then he comes and he says, "Somebody has
[1:48:38] come forth with a chart and draw it out.
[1:48:41] And somebody has come forth another
[1:48:43] thing and draw this out contrary to this
[1:48:45] one. Someone has come forth and said
[1:48:47] this is it coming back to this and
[1:48:49] others has wrote books and things like
[1:48:51] that. But God comes in the power of his
[1:48:54] resurrection. And who is he and who is
[1:48:57] going to speak against it?
[1:49:00] When God comes in the power of his
[1:49:02] resurrection, no critic can ever rise.
[1:49:06] If Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:49:08] and today and forever, he does the same
[1:49:11] that he did yesterday, today and
[1:49:13] forever. That's what this angel is
[1:49:16] supposed to do. Take them mysteries,
[1:49:18] them loose ends that people run out on.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; So he's supposed to come and take them
[1:49:27] mysteries that them loose ends that
[1:49:29] people run out on.
[1:49:33] So yes, the prophet came to wind up all
[1:49:36] these misfits,
[1:49:38] but he doesn't wind up these misfits
[1:49:40] with his intellectual capacity
[1:49:43] because he doesn't have any.
[1:49:47] He was a great servant.
[1:49:51] Amen.
[1:49:52] And God made sure that he chooses
[1:49:54] someone that is not educated.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:59] Lest you say it's his education.
[1:50:02] But he came, praise the Lord, with the
[1:50:06] anointing and the anction of the angel
[1:50:08] of the Lord.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord in the highest.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; And he came, hallelujah, that when he
[1:50:15] spoke, then God, amen, would come to
[1:50:18] vindicate what that prophet has spoken
[1:50:20] about.
[1:50:24] So he came demonstrating the signs and
[1:50:27] then God came giving the voice behind
[1:50:30] the sign.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about.
[1:50:36] That's what the prophet came to do.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And we understand when the prophets
[1:50:41] came, the prophet came, he came, he was
[1:50:44] going to start, Amen. by tying the loose
[1:50:46] ends. All those loose ends that they ran
[1:50:49] out on. But after tying them loose ends,
[1:50:52] then he was to get into the mysteries
[1:50:54] upon which no light had ever shineed.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; And that's what was shown in brother
[1:51:01] Junior's dream.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet calls it and he said, "I
[1:51:07] dreamed a dream
[1:51:09] and there it was. I just sat still and I
[1:51:13] listened and watched."
[1:51:16] Or do you catch what is happening here?
[1:51:19] The brother comes to the prophet and he
[1:51:21] says I had a dream and the moment he
[1:51:24] says that the prophet said I sat down
[1:51:27] and I listened to him but I am watching.
[1:51:33] In other words, the dream is playing in
[1:51:36] a vision whilst brother Junior is
[1:51:39] reciting the dream.
[1:51:42] There is a screen glory
[1:51:45] that the prophet is watching here and
[1:51:48] the man is reciting the dream. No wonder
[1:51:50] why at times he was able to say, "Oh,
[1:51:52] you missed this part."
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet in this day, church.
[1:52:03] He said, "I dreamed that there was a
[1:52:04] great big hill like out in a field where
[1:52:07] blue grass or something was and said up
[1:52:10] on top of the hill where the water had
[1:52:12] washed away the soil, there was a top a
[1:52:15] top rock up on top the hill like the top
[1:52:18] of the mountain, it was rock, no grass.
[1:52:21] And where the water had washed it down,
[1:52:23] it had cut some kind of readings on the
[1:52:25] stones. And you were standing there and
[1:52:28] interpreting this reading on these
[1:52:30] stones.
[1:52:32] So the prophet was interpreting the
[1:52:35] readings that were on the stone.
[1:52:38] Then you picked up something from the
[1:52:41] air, something like a wrecking bar or a
[1:52:43] crowbar, wasn't it, brother? Something
[1:52:45] like that. And a wrecking bar, real
[1:52:47] sharp, and said, "How you done it, I
[1:52:50] don't know." And he said, "You struck
[1:52:52] the top of that mountain, ripped it
[1:52:54] around, lifted up the cape off of it. It
[1:52:57] was in the shape of a pyramid, and you
[1:52:59] ripped the top of it." Now that was mans
[1:53:01] and mans and mans before the pyramid
[1:53:03] message was preached and said beneath
[1:53:05] that was a white stone granite and you
[1:53:08] said the sun or the light has never
[1:53:11] shined on this before look on this watch
[1:53:15] this
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; so the prophet's ministry amen it
[1:53:20] started by interpreting tying the loose
[1:53:23] ends interpreting the writing that was
[1:53:25] on the outside
[1:53:28] and when he was done through that then
[1:53:31] came a wrecking bar something that he
[1:53:33] picked up from the air and he chopped
[1:53:35] off the top of the mountain. Now we are
[1:53:37] in Sabino Canaan 1963 when the sword of
[1:53:42] the king uh the sword of the king he
[1:53:45] took that what was that signifying now
[1:53:48] he's stepping into the area where no
[1:53:51] light has ever shined upon.
[1:53:55] Now we are in the vision of Daniel
[1:53:57] because Daniel chapter 12 said and he
[1:54:00] said go thy way Daniel for the words are
[1:54:02] closed up and seal till the time of the
[1:54:05] end. So the light had never shined on
[1:54:08] this because the scripture had said no
[1:54:10] light should shine on this until we come
[1:54:13] to the end time. Hallelujah.
[1:54:19] But when we come to the end time
[1:54:21] something is about to take place. is
[1:54:24] exactly what Revelations 10:4 says. He
[1:54:27] was told, "Seal up those things which
[1:54:29] the seven thunders have uttered and
[1:54:32] write them not."
[1:54:36] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:54:38] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:54:40] sound, the mystery of God
[1:54:44] should be finished, as he had declared
[1:54:46] it to his servants, the prophets.
[1:54:50] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:54:52] seventh angel, the mystery of God
[1:54:56] singular.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Now what is a mystery?
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us what a mystery is.
[1:55:03] He says a mystery is scripture. Is a
[1:55:06] previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:55:09] revealed.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; But yet the supernatural element still
[1:55:14] remains despite the revelation.
[1:55:21] So when a mystery is revealed, a
[1:55:24] previously hidden truth is revealed, it
[1:55:26] is made known, but it doesn't take away
[1:55:28] the supernatural element.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; The supernatural element remains there.
[1:55:34] Hallelujah.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; So what is this mystery that we are
[1:55:38] talking about? What is this mystery?
[1:55:40] That is a singular mystery. But in the
[1:55:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:55:46] the mystery shall be finished. And the
[1:55:48] prophet says the mysteries.
[1:55:51] So let me say right here we have a
[1:55:54] mystery that has to be solved tonight.
[1:55:56] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:55:58] seventh angel even the mystery of the
[1:56:01] mysteries being plural. Amen. Why? It is
[1:56:05] a singular mystery has got to be
[1:56:07] finished.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat what I said.
[1:56:15] I believe in the days of the voice of
[1:56:17] the seventh angel, the mystery of the
[1:56:20] mysteries being plural. Why it is a
[1:56:23] mystery singular is also got to be
[1:56:26] finished.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; We got to understand it.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I've got your attention.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Can we get into it? The prophet of God
[1:56:45] says, "Now God had a purpose and a
[1:56:48] hidden mystery,
[1:56:51] not mysteries."
[1:56:52] God had a purpose and a hidden mystery.
[1:56:55] And that's what I want to speak on to
[1:56:57] the church this morning. The hidden
[1:57:00] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:57:03] before the world ever began and how that
[1:57:06] is unfolded itself right down to this
[1:57:08] present hour that we are living.
[1:57:12] Then you understand clearly then you
[1:57:14] will see on believe what is being done.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:57:22] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody know
[1:57:25] nothing about it. Even the angels didn't
[1:57:28] understand it. He didn't reveal it.
[1:57:31] That's the reason under our seventh
[1:57:33] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[1:57:36] there was silence.
[1:57:40] So the prophet is now zeroing in and
[1:57:42] he's talking about mystery, mystery,
[1:57:44] mystery, and he's not talking about
[1:57:46] mysteries anymore.
[1:57:49] Are you with me?
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; God had a hidden mystery. And it's a
[1:57:54] great mystery. Hallelujah. And he
[1:57:56] connects this mystery with Revelations
[1:57:58] chapter 10:7. He connects mystery with
[1:58:02] the seven seals as well.
[1:58:06] But it's a mystery singular.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet gives us a clue here
[1:58:13] what this mystery is all about. Oh, I
[1:58:16] just love this message.
[1:58:18] He goes on and he says, "Now just be as
[1:58:21] patient as you can, for I feel that in
[1:58:24] this year, if God will help me, will
[1:58:28] reveal and bring into your mind all
[1:58:31] these other things that I have talked on
[1:58:34] all through the days of the tabernacle,
[1:58:37] why I've said what I have said and why
[1:58:39] I've done what I have done." This is
[1:58:42] why.
[1:58:45] Now I want you to look at this carefully
[1:58:47] because you need to put on your
[1:58:48] spiritual thinking cap. Now you now need
[1:58:51] to put on your anointing jacket. Now the
[1:58:54] prophet of God is saying here now just
[1:58:56] be as patient as you can for I feel that
[1:58:59] in this year
[1:59:03] what he's about. He's introducing the
[1:59:05] subject. He's introducing what he's
[1:59:07] going to talk about. But he says in this
[1:59:09] here if God will help me will reveal and
[1:59:12] bring into your mind all these other
[1:59:15] things that I have talked on all through
[1:59:18] the days of the tabernacle why I have
[1:59:21] said what I have said and why I have
[1:59:23] done what I have done. This is why.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, praise the Lord. What
[1:59:31] the prophet is going to get into here,
[1:59:33] he's going to sum up everything that he
[1:59:36] has ever done in the tabernacle. He's
[1:59:38] going to sum up every sermon that he has
[1:59:40] ever preached in the tabernacle. He's
[1:59:42] going to sum up every action that he has
[1:59:45] ever taken. Everything in his entire
[1:59:47] life is going to be in this here.
[1:59:52] in this one thing that he's going to
[1:59:54] talk about here. He says this one thing
[1:59:57] will help reveal into your mind all the
[2:00:01] things.
[2:00:04] Oh, come on somebody.
[2:00:06] Oh, come on somebody. So this thing that
[2:00:10] he's going to talk about, hallelujah, it
[2:00:12] covers his entire ministry.
[2:00:16] Amen.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; And since the seventh angel, Amen. He
[2:00:20] has come and has preached several other
[2:00:22] sermons. Now, we can sum all the sermons
[2:00:25] that he has preached into this one thing
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; because he has said all the things that
[2:00:32] I've said at the tabernacle, all the
[2:00:34] actions that I've ever taken in my life,
[2:00:37] they are going to be summed up in this
[2:00:39] one thing.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:45] when he was taking the writings that was
[2:00:47] on the outside is going to be summed up
[2:00:49] in this. When he took this the the 11
[2:00:52] mysteries that we started off with is
[2:00:55] going to be summed up in this one thing.
[2:00:57] when he then went to where the angel of
[2:00:59] the Lord took him and he started
[2:01:01] revealing the mysteries. The mystery of
[2:01:03] the serpent seed, the mystery of the
[2:01:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[2:01:07] sensation, all the mysteries that he
[2:01:09] came to reveal, all that is going to be
[2:01:12] summed up in this one thing.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God in the highest. when he
[2:01:20] took the crowbar and he struck the top
[2:01:23] of the mountain and he now was told
[2:01:26] looking amen at where the light had
[2:01:28] never shined is going to be summed up in
[2:01:31] this one thing.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now we can begin to
[2:01:43] understand Revelations 10:7 because
[2:01:45] Revelations 10:7 says, "But in the days
[2:01:48] of the voice of the seventh angel, when
[2:01:51] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[2:01:53] God should be finished."
[2:01:57] The mystery singular shall be revealed
[2:02:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:02:02] angel. But this mystery is not a mystery
[2:02:05] as in one thing as your finger.
[2:02:11] Are you with me?
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; It is not one singular as in your
[2:02:15] finger, but it's a summation of an
[2:02:18] entire ministry
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; which can then be summed up into one
[2:02:23] thing.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me church?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; If you can understand this, then you can
[2:02:30] understand where I'm going.
[2:02:33] If you can understand this why the
[2:02:35] prophet amen came and he says uh in this
[2:02:39] one thing I'm going to tell you
[2:02:42] everything that I have done. If you
[2:02:44] catch that then you can begin to
[2:02:46] understand how the mystery singular
[2:02:49] contains all the other mysteries.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; What are you saying brother whisper?
[2:02:55] When he says the mystery, he's referring
[2:02:58] to the one thing.
[2:03:00] But when he says mysteries, he's
[2:03:02] breaking down the one thing.
[2:03:07] Because mystery is summing it up. But
[2:03:10] mysteries, he's breaking down what makes
[2:03:12] the one thing.
[2:03:16] Mysteries is what he has preached all
[2:03:18] down through the time at the tabernacle.
[2:03:21] is talking about everything that he has
[2:03:23] done, the actions that he has taken.
[2:03:26] That's the mysteries. So when he says
[2:03:28] the mystery, he's referring now to the
[2:03:31] summation of everything mysteries. He's
[2:03:34] breaking down the one thing. And that's
[2:03:36] why the prophet does not have a problem
[2:03:39] of switching from mystery to mysteries
[2:03:42] because he's talking of the same thing.
[2:03:46] And somebody says, "Do you know what
[2:03:48] you're talking about?" Yeah, I know what
[2:03:50] I'm talking about because I can give you
[2:03:52] a type and a shadow for it. Amen. Can we
[2:03:56] get into the Bible? Amen. Because in the
[2:03:59] Bible, I find something that is very
[2:04:01] similar where something is summed up in
[2:04:03] one but is broken down into several.
[2:04:06] Somebody says, "Tell me what you're
[2:04:08] talking about, preacher man." Can you
[2:04:10] say amen?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; I find it with the prophet Ezekiel.
[2:04:14] Because when the prophet Ezekiel came
[2:04:17] hallelujah in Ezekiel chapter one, the
[2:04:20] prophet Ezekiel said, "Now as I beheld
[2:04:23] the living creatures, behold one will
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; upon the earth by the living creatures
[2:04:30] with his four faces." Then he goes on to
[2:04:33] verse 16, "But the appearance of the
[2:04:36] wheels."
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hey, brother Ezekiel, you have just said
[2:04:41] you saw one wheel. Where are the wheels
[2:04:43] coming from?
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel had no problem in switching
[2:04:50] from one wheel and changing it to
[2:04:52] wheels.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a hand of praise,
[2:04:57] somebody.
[2:05:02] And their work was like unto the color
[2:05:04] of burial. and they and they fall at one
[2:05:07] likeness and their appearance and their
[2:05:09] work was at it were a wheel in the
[2:05:12] middle of a wheel.
[2:05:15] Now what is he talking about? How does
[2:05:18] he move from a wheel and the wheel
[2:05:20] become wheels? What is he talking about?
[2:05:23] But thank God for Malachi 4 because
[2:05:25] Malachi 4 came and explained to us what
[2:05:28] Ezekiel was talking about. Brother Brham
[2:05:30] then says, he says, "Now you know
[2:05:33] Ezekiel saw it again and he, this same
[2:05:36] prophet, he saw it as a wheel in the
[2:05:39] middle of a wheel turning up in the air.
[2:05:41] Now the wheel, first there is a rim,
[2:05:45] there is a tire, then the rim, then the
[2:05:49] spokes, then the hub."
[2:05:55] So the prophet is now telling us that
[2:05:57] when you are looking at a wheel, it is
[2:05:59] not one wheel.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Take me to the picture. He's saying now
[2:06:05] when you are looking at a wheel, a wheel
[2:06:07] has got the first wheel that is on the
[2:06:10] outside and it is called a tire. Then it
[2:06:13] has got a second wheel and it is called
[2:06:15] a rim. Then it has got a wheel that is
[2:06:17] in the middle of the wheel and that is
[2:06:19] the h. But when you are looking at this
[2:06:22] one thing, you call it one wheel. But if
[2:06:25] you are breaking it down, then you can
[2:06:27] break it down and say, I got a tire. I
[2:06:30] got a rim and I got a hub. Then I got
[2:06:34] wheels. So you can understand how
[2:06:36] Ezekiel can move from wheel to wheels.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God in the highest. Oh,
[2:06:48] glory to God in the highest. Let me
[2:06:51] bring it now to Malachi 4. Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] But in the days of the voice of the
[2:06:56] seventh angel, the mystery singular. And
[2:07:00] then he says in this message for I feel
[2:07:03] in this here in this one thing uh in
[2:07:06] this here if God will help me reveal and
[2:07:09] bring into your mind all other things
[2:07:12] that I've talked about through the days
[2:07:14] of the tabernacle why I've said what I
[2:07:16] said and why I've done what I've done.
[2:07:19] This is why.
[2:07:21] So he's going to break down his entire
[2:07:24] ministry. Hallelujah. Everything that he
[2:07:27] has ever done through his ministry, he's
[2:07:29] going to break it down and bring it into
[2:07:32] one thing.
[2:07:34] And that is the purpose of the coming of
[2:07:36] the seventh angel. The big question that
[2:07:38] we have is what then is this one thing,
[2:07:42] brother whisper?
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; What is this mystery?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; That Revelations 10:7 is supposed to
[2:07:53] finish. What is this mystery?
[2:07:56] I want to say that mystery, the answer
[2:08:00] is lying right in front of us. It has
[2:08:04] always been right in front of us. What
[2:08:06] is the mystery, brother? Whisper. Here
[2:08:09] is the mystery. Christ
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; is the mystery
[2:08:15] of God revealed. Give the Lord a hand of
[2:08:19] praise. Somebody
[2:08:23] give the Lord a hand of praise. Somebody
[2:08:26] Christ
[2:08:27] is the mystery of God. So what is
[2:08:30] supposed to be finished in the days of
[2:08:32] the voice of the seventh angel? It is
[2:08:35] Christ the mystery of God is to be
[2:08:38] revealed in the final days. Oh, give the
[2:08:42] Lord a hand of praise. Oh, say
[2:08:44] hallelujah. Somebody
[2:08:47] shout amen. Somebody,
[2:08:50] this is what is to be revealed. And this
[2:08:52] is what the seventh angel came to
[2:08:55] finish.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. Glory to
[2:09:02] God in the highest. To understand how
[2:09:04] this breaks down. Who is Christ?
[2:09:08] In the beginning was the word and the
[2:09:11] word was with God and the word was God.
[2:09:14] So Christ is the word. So what is to be
[2:09:17] finished? the mystery of the word.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; And the moment you know that Christ is
[2:09:22] the word, you can understand now how
[2:09:24] through the entire ministry of the
[2:09:26] prophet, all the sermons that he was
[2:09:28] preaching, what was he preaching about?
[2:09:30] The word.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; So the mystery of the word is what is
[2:09:35] supposed to be finished. Can you say
[2:09:37] amen?
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he has showed or
[2:09:41] revealed it in every type in thus in the
[2:09:44] Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is
[2:09:47] the revelation of God's mystery in
[2:09:49] Christ. The entire Bible is an
[2:09:53] expression of one goal.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; That God had one purpose. He wanted to
[2:10:01] achieve in the entire Bible. And all the
[2:10:05] acts of the believers in the Bible has
[2:10:07] been in type in expressing what God's
[2:10:10] great goal is. And now this is the last
[2:10:12] day. He has revealed it and shows it.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; So the entire Bible had one goal.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; It can be summed up in one thing.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Now when he preached the message, Christ
[2:10:27] is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. He
[2:10:30] referred to a scripture of Luke chapter
[2:10:32] 24. Amen. And in Luke chapter 24, he
[2:10:36] started talking. Amen. Taking this
[2:10:38] scripture talking about Jesus Christ.
[2:10:41] how he was talking with the two as they
[2:10:43] went on their road to a mouse. He said,
[2:10:45] "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[2:10:48] all that the prophet has spoken. Ought
[2:10:51] not Christ to have suffered these things
[2:10:52] and enter into his glory? And beginning
[2:10:55] at Moses and all prophets, he expounded
[2:10:58] unto them in all the scriptures the
[2:11:01] things concerning himself."
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; So what is Christ doing here? He's
[2:11:08] taking them through the Bible. And the
[2:11:10] Bible says beginning at Moses, what is
[2:11:14] Moses in the Bible? When he says Moses,
[2:11:17] he's speaking of Genesis. He's speaking
[2:11:19] of Exodus. He's speaking of Leviticus.
[2:11:22] He's speaking of Numbers. He's speaking
[2:11:24] of Deuteronomy. So, beginning with those
[2:11:27] five books, he began to show how he was
[2:11:30] supposed to be in there.
[2:11:34] In the book of Genesis, he was
[2:11:36] Mechisedc.
[2:11:39] Can you say amen? The one without father
[2:11:42] and without mother. He was that elohim
[2:11:45] that came into the plains of Mamry.
[2:11:47] Hallelujah. With skin on him and sat
[2:11:50] down and ate some food together with
[2:11:52] Abraham. Can you say amen? You move into
[2:11:56] the book of Exodus. Who was he in
[2:11:58] Exodus? He was the angel of the Lord.
[2:12:01] Behold, I send my angel before you.
[2:12:04] Beware of him. Who was he when he gets
[2:12:07] into the book of Leviticus? In the book
[2:12:09] of Leviticus, he then becomes the waters
[2:12:12] of separation. And I hear my prophets
[2:12:15] say, when you see water of separation,
[2:12:17] place Christ there. Oh, come on, give
[2:12:20] the Lord a hand of praise. Who was he in
[2:12:23] the book of Numbers? Uh, he was the
[2:12:25] serpent that was raised up. Uh, Amen.
[2:12:29] Look and leave.
[2:12:31] No matter what you are, look and leave.
[2:12:34] No matter what your situation is, look
[2:12:36] and leave. I want to say to you tonight,
[2:12:39] I don't know what your burden is, but
[2:12:41] look and leave. You are not looking at a
[2:12:44] raised present serpent, but you are
[2:12:46] looking at Jesus Christ, the author and
[2:12:49] finisher of your life, the author and
[2:12:52] finisher of your faith.
[2:12:54] Or somebody says, "I'm going to look
[2:12:56] tonight. And when I look, I'm going to
[2:12:58] leave. Uh, can you say amen? When you
[2:13:01] get into the book of Deuteronomy, who
[2:13:03] was he in the book of Deuteronomy? He
[2:13:06] was alive.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Because I hear the book saying in
[2:13:10] Deuteronomy 30:1 19, praise God in the
[2:13:14] highest. Behold, I lay life and death
[2:13:18] before you. Choose life. Then Jesus
[2:13:21] comes and he says, I am the way, the
[2:13:24] truth, and the life. So he was the life
[2:13:28] in the book of Deuteronomy. Can you say
[2:13:30] amen somebody? We step into the book of
[2:13:32] judges. Who was he in the book of
[2:13:34] judges? He was the spirit that would
[2:13:37] come upon the judges like the spirit
[2:13:40] came upon and he went and defied.
[2:13:47] Oh brother, when the spirit of God comes
[2:13:49] upon you, I don't care who is against
[2:13:51] you. I don't care what demons is against
[2:13:54] you. I don't care how many years he has
[2:13:56] been around you. Even tonight when the
[2:13:59] anointing comes upon you, that demon has
[2:14:01] to go. That cushion time has to leave
[2:14:05] your arm, has got to leave your ch or
[2:14:08] tell that demon that tonight you are
[2:14:10] going to get out.
[2:14:13] Oh, how many want to believe it with me?
[2:14:15] Give that devil a notice to say by the
[2:14:18] time I get to the end of these meetings,
[2:14:20] I'm walking out of here free.
[2:14:24] I'm leaving all my parents
[2:14:27] in this school hall. I'm not carrying no
[2:14:30] garbage with me.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; He was the spirit of God that would come
[2:14:39] upon the judges in the book of Revel in
[2:14:41] in the book of in the book of judges.
[2:14:44] Can you say amen?
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; When you move over to the book of Ruth,
[2:14:48] who was he? He was that seventh measure
[2:14:50] that was missing in the measures of
[2:14:52] Boaz.
[2:14:54] Oh, I can keep getting on. Who was he
[2:14:58] when he comes into the book of the
[2:14:59] Kings? He's the king of the kings. He's
[2:15:02] the Lord of the Lords. He is the
[2:15:04] principal theme of the Bible. Beginning
[2:15:07] with Moses, he expounded through all the
[2:15:10] prophets.
[2:15:14] Oh, glory to God in the eyes. Can you
[2:15:17] say amen?
[2:15:19] Can you say amen?
[2:15:21] Beginning with Moses, he started
[2:15:24] expounding everything. Praise the Lord
[2:15:26] in the highest. Now you I want you to
[2:15:29] watch something here. The Bible says
[2:15:32] beginning at Moses and all the prophets.
[2:15:36] The Bible does not say beginning with
[2:15:39] Genesis.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; People have problems when we say brother
[2:15:45] Brandham says
[2:15:47] They just don't know the order of the
[2:15:49] Bible.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says here, beginning with
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; not with Genesis.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Not only does the Bible says that, but
[2:15:58] the Bible also says in the book of Acts,
[2:16:00] it says, give me the scripture. Moses of
[2:16:03] old time in every city them that preach
[2:16:06] him.
[2:16:08] They are not preaching the word.
[2:16:11] They are preaching Moses.
[2:16:15] And they accuse us. Why are you
[2:16:16] preaching brother Brandham? Why are you
[2:16:18] preaching brother Brown? You don't know
[2:16:19] your Bible. The message and the
[2:16:22] messenger are one. And that's the
[2:16:25] passage. You can't separate the message
[2:16:28] from the messenger.
[2:16:31] Can you say amen? We are more scriptural
[2:16:34] than they think when we caught the
[2:16:36] prophet because the Bible caught them
[2:16:38] that brought the word. Can you say amen,
[2:16:41] somebody? You know one time I was
[2:16:44] actually accused somebody came and he
[2:16:46] says hey preacher man you know when you
[2:16:48] were preaching you never even mentioned
[2:16:50] the name of Jesus Christ not once.
[2:16:54] I said really I'm not sure he was right
[2:16:58] because I don't think I can preach
[2:16:59] without mentioning the Lord Jesus
[2:17:02] but I assumed he was right. And I said
[2:17:05] really? He said yeah. I said let me ask
[2:17:08] you a question. Did I read a scripture?
[2:17:11] Because I always do when I start. And he
[2:17:13] says, "Yeah, you read a scripture." I
[2:17:15] said, "Right there when I read the
[2:17:16] scripture, I read Jesus Christ."
[2:17:22] Glory to God in the highest because why?
[2:17:26] He is the principal theme of the Bible.
[2:17:29] If you read the Bible, I'm on this
[2:17:31] quotation. If you read the Bible and
[2:17:34] don't see Christ in every verse of it,
[2:17:37] go back and read it again.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; I'm on paragraph 121. He says, "Go back
[2:17:44] and read it again."
[2:17:47] He is the principal theme of the entire
[2:17:49] Bible. Are you with me? If you can't see
[2:17:52] Christ in every verse of the Bible, then
[2:17:54] you can read it again because you have
[2:17:56] missed something. The Bible is Christ.
[2:17:59] He is the word.
[2:18:02] Hallelujah.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Then I carried on and I said brother
[2:18:06] when I was talking about what brother
[2:18:07] Brham said and I quoted brother Brham
[2:18:09] what I quoted what brother Brham said
[2:18:12] was it Bible
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; what brother Brham was referring to was
[2:18:17] it in the scripture and he says yeah it
[2:18:20] was in the scripture I said if it was in
[2:18:22] the scripture I'm talking about Jesus
[2:18:24] Christ
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; because Paul says follow me even as I
[2:18:29] follow Christ.
[2:18:31] Be ye followers of me. Where do you know
[2:18:34] your Bible from? What school did you go
[2:18:36] to? Get thee behind me.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord in the eyes. Brother,
[2:18:42] you don't play with the message
[2:18:43] believer. We know where where we stand.
[2:18:47] This is the principal theme of the
[2:18:49] entire Bible. It's Jesus Christ and
[2:18:51] Jesus Christ alone. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:18:54] the Lord in the highest. Now, how do we
[2:18:58] see Jesus Christ? We see him as the word
[2:19:01] is going forth with those that were
[2:19:03] going to a mouse. How did they end up
[2:19:06] identifying him? They ended up
[2:19:08] identifying him when he took the bread.
[2:19:10] Luke 24:30, he took the bread and he
[2:19:14] blessed it and he break it and he gave
[2:19:16] it to them and their eyes were opened.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; What opened their eyes? The breaking of
[2:19:23] the bread. And they said one to another,
[2:19:26] "Did not our heart burn within us as he
[2:19:29] talked to us along the way?" Let me say
[2:19:31] tonight, "What is going to open your
[2:19:33] eyes is the breaking of the bread?"
[2:19:36] While Peter had spare, whilst the bread
[2:19:39] was being broken forth, who was being
[2:19:41] revealed, Jesus Christ, the same
[2:19:43] yesterday, today, and forever. Brother,
[2:19:45] something happens when the word is
[2:19:47] broken forth. Something happens to a
[2:19:50] believer. You begin to catch something
[2:19:52] and you say, "Oh my, is this me that is
[2:19:55] being talked about?" Yes, it is you that
[2:19:57] we are talking about. Yes, it is you
[2:19:59] that we are identifying. Praise God in
[2:20:01] the highest tonight as the bread is
[2:20:04] being broken. Hallelujah. You can begin
[2:20:06] to have some stimulation of some
[2:20:09] revelation,
[2:20:10] brother. You can begin to have a bit of
[2:20:13] some wine. Praise the Lord. Uh exciting
[2:20:16] you and stimulating you. Can you say
[2:20:18] amen, somebody? Can you say amen
[2:20:21] somebody? Right now, right here, when
[2:20:24] you begin to feel something coming your
[2:20:25] way, it is the wine that is starting to
[2:20:28] excite you. It is the wine that is
[2:20:31] taking you to a familiar ground to say,
[2:20:33] "Hey, you are not a sober man.
[2:20:37] You are drunk with the Holy Ghost. You
[2:20:40] can't behave like a sober somebody."
[2:20:43] They say we act like we are crazy. Yeah.
[2:20:46] Because what we took is so much
[2:20:48] intoxicating.
[2:20:51] It can't keep us the same. And brother,
[2:20:54] sister, every time I come to church, I
[2:20:56] get another dose of exactly the same
[2:20:59] thing.
[2:21:00] I get another thought.
[2:21:03] And I'm here to give you another dose
[2:21:05] tonight. That when you walk out of this
[2:21:07] place, you are staggering out.
[2:21:10] Hallelujah. under the influence of what
[2:21:12] you have been partaking during the
[2:21:14] course of this meetings. Say amen,
[2:21:17] somebody tonight. Glory to God in the
[2:21:20] eyes. Hallelujah.
[2:21:23] Let let me move on here because I need
[2:21:25] to get something. The prophet of God
[2:21:28] says God's great mystery of how it's a
[2:21:32] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody know
[2:21:35] nothing about it. Even the angels didn't
[2:21:37] understand it. He didn't reveal it.
[2:21:39] That's the reason and our seventh
[2:21:41] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[2:21:44] there was silence. So I said he connects
[2:21:47] it with the seventh seal. Why is he
[2:21:49] connecting it with the seventh seal?
[2:21:51] Because the seventh seal is Jesus
[2:21:53] Christ.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is Jesus Christ. And he
[2:21:59] says beginning amen with Moses. He
[2:22:02] started to reveal himself. The prophet
[2:22:05] of God says it's the revealing. is
[2:22:08] revealing the seventh seal is perfectly
[2:22:10] mute and I only had time I'll try and a
[2:22:15] few places to show you all the way back
[2:22:18] from Genesis this seventh seal is spoke
[2:22:21] of
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; so the seventh seal start from Genesis
[2:22:26] where does the seventh seal start from
[2:22:28] Genesis the prophet of God tells us
[2:22:30] hallelujah right there in the beginning
[2:22:34] when the Bible says in the beginning in
[2:22:37] the beginning is the same. John 1 verse
[2:22:39] one, in the beginning was the word.
[2:22:42] Genesis 1 verse one, in the beginning.
[2:22:45] So the one that is in John 1 is the one
[2:22:48] that is in Genesis 1. And who is it that
[2:22:50] is in John 1:1? He is the word. And who
[2:22:54] is the word? He is Jesus Christ. And who
[2:22:57] is Jesus Christ? He is the seventh seal.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? Then you move
[2:23:03] on down. He was the seventh city of
[2:23:05] refuge because there were seven six
[2:23:07] cities. He was the seventh measure that
[2:23:10] was in Ruth because there were six
[2:23:12] measures. He was the seventh husband to
[2:23:14] the woman in John chapter 4. You can see
[2:23:17] the seventh seal running through the
[2:23:19] entire Bible. Can you say amen?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says, notice God has had
[2:23:26] a three-fold purpose in this great
[2:23:28] mystery secret. God in his great mystery
[2:23:30] secret that he heard before the world
[2:23:32] began he has got a three-fold purpose in
[2:23:35] it. The first thing God wanted to reveal
[2:23:38] himself to the people
[2:23:42] and the prophet preached in this message
[2:23:44] Christ is the mystery of God. He took
[2:23:46] the scripture of Colossians and that
[2:23:49] scripture says, "Wherefore I am made a
[2:23:51] minister according to the dispensation
[2:23:54] of God which is given to me for you to
[2:23:57] fulfill the word of God, even the
[2:23:59] mystery which had been hid from ages
[2:24:01] from generations, but now is made
[2:24:04] manifest to his saints, to whom God
[2:24:06] would make known what is the riches of
[2:24:09] the glory of this mystery among the
[2:24:11] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[2:24:14] hope of glory.
[2:24:16] Now we can begin to preach here.
[2:24:20] Now we can begin to preach here. Can you
[2:24:23] say amen, somebody? The Bible is now
[2:24:26] saying here, even the mystery which has
[2:24:29] been heed from all ages down through the
[2:24:32] ages which is now revealed, made known.
[2:24:36] Hallelujah. What is it? The glory of
[2:24:39] this mystery. And what is the glory of
[2:24:41] this mystery? Which is Christ in you.
[2:24:44] the hope of glory. So there's been a
[2:24:47] mystery that has been hidden down
[2:24:49] through the ages. But that mystery is
[2:24:52] now finished. Where is it finished? That
[2:24:55] mystery, it is finished in you and I
[2:25:00] which is Christ in you. The hope of
[2:25:03] glory. Can you say amen somebody? Can
[2:25:07] you say amen somebody? I said my title.
[2:25:10] It is the finished mystery. Hallelujah.
[2:25:13] that defines the restored bride. Now,
[2:25:16] let's begin to preach here. I'm saying
[2:25:19] tonight that the finished mystery, it is
[2:25:21] finished in you
[2:25:24] because this is what he has hidden down
[2:25:26] through the ages. He has been waiting
[2:25:28] for this moment. He has been waiting to
[2:25:30] come to this place where he can reveal
[2:25:32] himself to say the mystery that we have
[2:25:35] been talking about. The mystery that
[2:25:37] I've hidden down through the ages. It is
[2:25:39] the mystery of Christ coming inside of
[2:25:42] you to become the hope of glory.
[2:25:45] And let me tell you church, this is the
[2:25:48] zenith of God's intentions.
[2:25:53] When he came in flesh, one would have
[2:25:55] thought, "Oh my, what is greater than
[2:25:58] Jesus coming in flesh?" Because the
[2:26:00] Bible in John 1, amen, it says, "In the
[2:26:03] beginning was the word, and the word was
[2:26:05] with God, and the word was God, and the
[2:26:07] word was made flesh, and he dwelt
[2:26:09] amongst us." Now, you would have
[2:26:11] thought, what is greater than the God of
[2:26:13] heaven walking on two feet?
[2:26:17] What is greater than the God of heaven
[2:26:20] fellowshipping with his people?
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; What is greater than the God of heaven
[2:26:25] visiting amen the people himself?
[2:26:28] But Christ said no that is not the
[2:26:31] zenith of my desire. He says, "Amen."
[2:26:34] Uh, in the book of Joan again here, he
[2:26:37] says, "But because I have said these
[2:26:39] things, you sorrow has filled your
[2:26:41] heart. Nevertheless, I tell you the
[2:26:44] truth, it is expedient for you that I go
[2:26:46] away. For if I go not away, the
[2:26:49] comforter will not come into you." In
[2:26:51] other words, my coming in flesh is not
[2:26:54] the zenith of what I intended. The
[2:26:57] highest form is when I step down into
[2:27:00] the heart of a believer. The highest
[2:27:03] form it is when I come down amongst my
[2:27:07] own. The highest form is when I become
[2:27:10] part of them. The highest form is when
[2:27:13] the token hallelujah becomes a part of
[2:27:16] you. Can you say amen somebody? Can you
[2:27:19] say amen somebody? I'm saying tonight
[2:27:22] the highest form of Jesus Christ is when
[2:27:26] he comes inside of your life. Jesus on
[2:27:29] two feet again. You are here as the
[2:27:31] restored bride. And as the restored
[2:27:34] bride, you are here to finish
[2:27:36] everything.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Therefore, as the restored bride, we can
[2:27:42] finish everything.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Because here we now are in our ministry.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; The reason why he restored us is because
[2:27:50] he had a certain intention. He was
[2:27:52] aiming for something. He was trying to
[2:27:54] get something. Let me say to you
[2:27:56] tonight, God has had some unsettled
[2:27:59] scores with the devil.
[2:28:01] Right from the Garden of Eden,
[2:28:03] hallelujah, there were some unsettled
[2:28:05] scores. The devil came in the Garden of
[2:28:08] Eden and he caused Eve to sin. But in
[2:28:11] this final day in Satan's Eden, God
[2:28:14] says, "I'm going to show the old man
[2:28:16] devil. I'm going to rise a bride. I will
[2:28:20] restore, thus says the Lord. I will
[2:28:23] restore. Thus, says the Lord. And this
[2:28:27] bride that I'm picking up now, she will
[2:28:30] not fall.
[2:28:32] She's going to make it. She's not going
[2:28:35] to be defeated. Let me tell you, you are
[2:28:37] not going to be defeated. That disease
[2:28:39] is not going to defeat you. That problem
[2:28:42] is not going to defeat you. It's going
[2:28:44] to go. It's going to go. Whether he
[2:28:48] likes it or not, it's going to go. Your
[2:28:51] life is going to be a testimony. You are
[2:28:54] a restored bride. You are the mystery
[2:28:58] that we have been waiting for. You are
[2:29:00] the mystery that Christ has been relying
[2:29:03] on. And I'm saying to you tonight, these
[2:29:06] meetings cannot go the same. Something
[2:29:09] has got to change in your life.
[2:29:11] Something has got to change in your
[2:29:12] life. Things have got to be sorted out
[2:29:15] in your life. Something has got to
[2:29:17] change in your life. I don't care how
[2:29:19] long it is lingered for. I'm here to say
[2:29:22] all things are finished in the days of
[2:29:26] the voice of the seventh angel. The
[2:29:28] mystery of God is finished.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying to you tonight, we are
[2:29:34] living in the days to finish all things.
[2:29:39] We are here to finish all things. I
[2:29:42] don't care what it is. I don't care how
[2:29:45] long it has been for. It has got to be
[2:29:47] finished. Let me announce to you to say
[2:29:50] tonight your issue is going to be
[2:29:52] finished.
[2:29:53] Oh, give me your hand. Let us agree
[2:29:55] together. Before we leave this meetings,
[2:29:59] something has got to be finished.
[2:30:01] Something has got to be finished. I'm
[2:30:03] looking for a believer now. I'm looking
[2:30:05] for a believer now. Somebody that says,
[2:30:07] "Yes, I came to church with a burden. I
[2:30:10] came to church with something." Hey,
[2:30:12] hey, hey, that thing has got to be
[2:30:14] finished. You are not carrying it out of
[2:30:16] this church. It's going to stay right
[2:30:18] here. It's got to be finished. It's got
[2:30:21] to end.
[2:30:23] It's got to end.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; It's got to end.
[2:30:28] It's got to end. It cannot carry on.
[2:30:32] Something has got to stop. Can you say
[2:30:35] amen?
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I don't care what it
[2:30:39] was. You have prayed for it for too
[2:30:41] long. I'm here to give you the answer.
[2:30:44] Your answer has come. It's over.
[2:30:49] It's over.
[2:30:51] It's over. You might as well stand up
[2:30:54] and start rejoicing. Thank God for
[2:30:56] saving you. Thank God for redeeming you.
[2:31:00] Thank God for changing your situation.
[2:31:02] It's over.
[2:31:05] It's over.
[2:31:07] Or you might as well wave goodbye and
[2:31:09] say goodbye, Satan. I stay no longer
[2:31:12] with you. You won't come to my house
[2:31:14] anymore. You are going back to your home
[2:31:18] to find the mystery of God has been
[2:31:21] finished.
[2:31:23] It's got to be finished. It is getting
[2:31:26] finished right in here. Who say that
[2:31:29] your problems is permanent?
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Who said it is a permanent problem?
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, if something has a
[2:31:37] beginning,
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; it means it is not eternal.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; If you can identify where it started,
[2:31:43] You can identify where it ends.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? If you can
[2:31:49] identify when it started, do you have a
[2:31:52] date where something started?
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you have a date, you have
[2:31:58] a date tonight where it is ending.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying we are ending it right
[2:32:03] now. We are ending it right now. We are
[2:32:06] ending it right now. Oh, let me rest as
[2:32:09] I preach. We are ending it right now. I
[2:32:12] don't care what it is. We are ending it
[2:32:15] right now. You might as well tell the
[2:32:17] old man devil, I'm ending it because I
[2:32:21] know it had a start date. And if it had
[2:32:24] a start date, it's got to be finished.
[2:32:27] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:32:30] angel, the mystery of God shall be
[2:32:34] finished.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; When he died on the cross of Calvary,
[2:32:38] what did he say? He said, "It is
[2:32:42] It is.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; It is. Oh, shout it out. It is.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; It is. It's over.
[2:32:52] It's over. Receive your blessing.
[2:32:56] Receive your heart's desire. If you
[2:32:58] wanted a child, you can have a child. If
[2:33:01] you wanted a marriage, you can have a
[2:33:03] marriage. If you wanted a job, you can
[2:33:06] have a job. Whatever you wanted, it is
[2:33:09] fortaken. I'm giving you now an open
[2:33:12] check.
[2:33:14] Hey mama, your children are coming back.
[2:33:17] Your children are coming back. The devil
[2:33:20] took them away from you, but they are
[2:33:22] coming back. The devil is a liar. Sister
[2:33:26] Herty, I give you your children in the
[2:33:29] name of Jesus Christ. Receive them right
[2:33:32] now. Praise the Lord in the highest.
[2:33:35] It's okay. Auntie Jamaima, God has heard
[2:33:39] your prayer. God has heard your prayer.
[2:33:43] Your son is rising back up again. God
[2:33:46] stopped the plane again. The same God of
[2:33:49] Malachi 4, he's here tonight to solve
[2:33:52] your situation. Can you say amen,
[2:33:55] somebody? I'm saying tonight, we are not
[2:33:58] going to end the meetings until your
[2:34:00] problem is over.
[2:34:02] I'm looking for somebody that can really
[2:34:04] believe.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody that can say, "I believe."
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Brother, when Christ is inside of you,
[2:34:11] what can be against you?
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; What can be against you?
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; When the token is in you, Jesus Christ,
[2:34:19] the author of life, when he's inside of
[2:34:22] you, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[2:34:26] The hope of glory. Somebody says, "Do
[2:34:29] you know what you're talking about,
[2:34:30] preacher man?" I know what I'm talking
[2:34:32] about. What is the hope of glory?
[2:34:35] Hallelujah. What is glory? Glory comes
[2:34:38] from the Hebrew word kabort,
[2:34:41] which is which means weight, but not
[2:34:45] figuratively.
[2:34:46] It is weightless in wonderful qualities
[2:34:49] such as might, beauty, goodness, honor,
[2:34:52] loaded with power and reputation. Glory
[2:34:55] speaks of splendor, magnificence,
[2:34:57] majestic, glorious, without blame,
[2:35:00] lacking nothing.
[2:35:03] So let me say to you, Christ in you, the
[2:35:07] hope of your splendor.
[2:35:09] Christ in you, the hope of something
[2:35:12] that is loaded with power and with
[2:35:14] reputation. Christ in you, the hope of
[2:35:17] magnificence, majestic, glorious.
[2:35:20] You are stepping out of these meetings
[2:35:23] to go and witness something that you
[2:35:25] have never witnessed before. Oh, how
[2:35:27] many receive it tonight? How many
[2:35:30] receive it tonight to say, "Brother, I'm
[2:35:32] walking out of this place never to
[2:35:34] experience what I've been experiencing
[2:35:37] up to now. I'm walking out of this this
[2:35:39] place to go and receive something that
[2:35:42] is completely new. You are the restored
[2:35:45] bride.
[2:35:46] The mystery was finished,
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; but it's finished in you.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Now Christ is relying on you
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; to finish the mystery.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; He's relying in you to settle the
[2:35:59] unsettled scores of the book of Genesis
[2:36:02] of the Garden of Eden. Brother, that's
[2:36:05] why the prophet in the message Christ is
[2:36:07] the mystery of God revealed. He said the
[2:36:10] third fold of the three-fold purpose of
[2:36:12] God, what was it? Was to restore
[2:36:17] the kingdom
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; back to its rightful place.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; So the restoration of the kingdom, what
[2:36:25] does the kingdom come with? The kingdom
[2:36:27] comes with kingdom power,
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; kingdom authority. When you sit upon the
[2:36:32] throne and when you sit upon the throne,
[2:36:35] you begin to rule and to pass decrees.
[2:36:38] You are acting like a king. Or tonight,
[2:36:40] as I'm about to close, I want you to
[2:36:42] exercise your kingship.
[2:36:47] I want you to think of a situation and I
[2:36:49] want you to pass a judgment.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you 30 seconds. I said I want
[2:36:57] you to think of a situation that is in
[2:36:59] your life and I want you to pass a
[2:37:01] judgment on it because when you sit upon
[2:37:04] the throne, Amen. the the the promise of
[2:37:07] revelations, amen, to the Lordian church
[2:37:10] age, he says, he that overcomemeth will
[2:37:13] I grant to sit with me in my throne even
[2:37:16] as I also overcame and I'm set down with
[2:37:19] my father in his throne. Why do you sit
[2:37:21] on a throne? so that you can rule over
[2:37:25] rule over sickness. Rule over diseases,
[2:37:29] rule over situations, rule over work
[2:37:32] environments. Whilst you are in church,
[2:37:34] you are ruling what is going to happen
[2:37:36] tomorrow.
[2:37:38] Whilst you are in church, you are ruling
[2:37:40] the decision that is going to be made
[2:37:42] tomorrow by someone who is considering
[2:37:44] your case.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Whilst you are in church, you are saying
[2:37:48] this is the way that it is going to be.
[2:37:50] I decree and I declare that this is what
[2:37:53] it's going to be. My children are coming
[2:37:55] back to me on such and such a date. Put
[2:37:58] a date to it and say before the end of
[2:38:01] this month, God is going to receive.
[2:38:04] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Receive it,
[2:38:06] my brother, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:38:09] Pass your decree tonight and say, "This
[2:38:11] is my decree." God bless you, Florida.
[2:38:14] This is my decree. I'm walking out of
[2:38:17] here to go and receive my blessing.
[2:38:20] Brother, when you walk out, Amen. after
[2:38:22] these meetings, you are stepping into
[2:38:24] something new. Can I speak to spirit and
[2:38:27] truth tabernacle? Can I speak to spirit
[2:38:30] and truth tabernacle? God has even
[2:38:33] showed it to you that this meetings is a
[2:38:35] turning point because after this, you
[2:38:38] are changing your camping grounds.
[2:38:41] You are changing your church.
[2:38:44] Can you say amen? You are changing your
[2:38:47] place of meeting. is in that God
[2:38:49] confirming the word that something new
[2:38:52] is beginning to unfold. Say amen. Spirit
[2:38:55] and truth. Say amen. Spirit and
[2:38:57] children, we say amen together with you.
[2:39:01] Things are changing. Who said your life
[2:39:04] will remain the same? No, it cannot
[2:39:06] remain the same. Something has got to
[2:39:08] change. Something has got to be
[2:39:10] transformed. If it can happen to the
[2:39:12] church, it can happen in your house.
[2:39:16] If it can happen to the church, it can
[2:39:18] happen with your daughter. If it can
[2:39:20] happen to the church, it can happen at
[2:39:23] your place of work. If it can happen in
[2:39:26] church, it can happen in every facet of
[2:39:28] your life. Only do you believe it. Only
[2:39:31] do you believe it? Believer, believe.
[2:39:35] Believer, believe. Walk out of this
[2:39:37] place ready to receive. God bless you
[2:39:41] tonight. God bless you tonight. walk out

[2:39:55] spoken about it. It is coming your way.

[2:40:31] yet manifested, that gets God excited.
[2:40:34] Uh and he says to the angels, "Have you
[2:40:36] seen my daughter the way she's thanking
[2:40:38] me by revelation? Have you seen my son?
