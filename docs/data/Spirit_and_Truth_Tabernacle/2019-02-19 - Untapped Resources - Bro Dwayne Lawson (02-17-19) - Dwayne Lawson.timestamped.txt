[1:19:08] man if you have your Bibles tonight we'd
[1:19:11] like to turn to the book of Mark the
[1:19:14] 11th chapter of the one Thank You
[1:19:16] musicians god bless you richly amen and
[1:19:19] we want to turn here to mark the 11th
[1:19:22] chapter tonight we want to read the 22nd
[1:19:27] verse of market 11 and you know Jesus
[1:19:33] has just cursed a fig tree in it within
[1:19:35] 24 hours a miracle had taken place upon
[1:19:39] it and they were marveling at what had
[1:19:42] happened to the tree just by the spoken
[1:19:44] word and jesus answered and said unto
[1:19:47] them have faith in God now if you do
[1:19:53] some study and you know that is the
[1:19:55] faith of God now for verily I say unto
[1:19:58] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:20:03] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[1:20:05] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[1:20:08] heart but that he shall believe that the
[1:20:12] things which he says shall come to pass
[1:20:14] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:20:20] therefore I say unto thee you what
[1:20:24] things whatsoever you desire when you
[1:20:27] pray believe that you have them or
[1:20:29] receive them now that's actually in a
[1:20:31] present tense believe that you have it
[1:20:33] right now and the scripture said and you
[1:20:37] shall have them you have to believe it
[1:20:41] is a present tense before it becomes in
[1:20:45] your future if you want something
[1:20:48] tomorrow you've got to believe for it
[1:20:49] today if you want something to change in
[1:20:52] your life tomorrow you've got to believe
[1:20:54] today hey man we ask the Lord to bless
[1:20:57] his word is you may be seated tonight I
[1:20:59] want to just talk to you a little bit
[1:21:01] tonight and if I would take a title for
[1:21:03] this sermon I want to speak to you on
[1:21:05] the untapped resources
[1:21:08] upon untapped resources they've met in
[1:21:10] other words things that are available
[1:21:13] that we are not using currently but just
[1:21:16] because we're not using some of these
[1:21:17] things does not mean they're not
[1:21:19] available amen but they're an untapped
[1:21:22] they meant an untapped resource you know
[1:21:24] I believe personally that this is the
[1:21:27] time remember we just went way down
[1:21:29] there I believe that this is the time of
[1:21:32] possession they man I believe the season
[1:21:35] that we are living in is a season that
[1:21:38] when the Church of God is moving in to
[1:21:42] their promises I believe that's the
[1:21:44] moment that we're living in today I
[1:21:45] believe that that's the season that we
[1:21:48] are in is the season of possessing manna
[1:21:51] I know you know the scripture that God
[1:21:53] promised Abraham that he would have a
[1:21:55] land amen but in Acts the seventh
[1:21:57] chapter how many knows the Bible says
[1:21:59] that Abraham never actually possessed
[1:22:01] the land amen he was promised the land
[1:22:04] but he never owned the land
[1:22:06] amen but but we do know that his
[1:22:09] children later under the ministry of
[1:22:11] Joshua amen actually possessed what God
[1:22:15] promised to Abraham amen and each one of
[1:22:18] them men that possess things possess
[1:22:20] them by promise safe man and if you go
[1:22:22] back and you realize that there's things
[1:22:24] written to the church of the Corinthians
[1:22:26] that God would change their bodies in
[1:22:28] the moment and how that he would make
[1:22:30] corruptible put on incorruption and
[1:22:32] mortal would put on immortality and you
[1:22:34] all know that was promised to a
[1:22:36] Corinthian church but the Corinthian
[1:22:38] church never possessed that promise amen
[1:22:40] his promise that our body should we
[1:22:42] change in the moment the twinklin line
[1:22:44] 1st Thessalonians 4 and that promise was
[1:22:46] made to the Thessalonians by Paul but
[1:22:49] the Thessalonians never possess that
[1:22:51] promise amen but yet if we know them
[1:22:54] that it was spoken for a future
[1:22:55] civilization or future Church that was
[1:22:58] coming into the scene just like Mark the
[1:23:00] eleventh chapter Amen if you say unto
[1:23:02] this mountain be now move now you can
[1:23:04] take doubt and explain that away and say
[1:23:07] that God wasn't actually meaning that he
[1:23:09] meant but I believe that God made a
[1:23:11] promise to these this
[1:23:12] it was just like he made two Corinthians
[1:23:14] and he made up FS alone Ian's but these
[1:23:16] promises are coming in to the Church of
[1:23:19] the Living God today amen
[1:23:21] now I want you to know God called that
[1:23:23] those disciples and made promises to
[1:23:25] them that they never experienced God
[1:23:27] called amen the Corinthian church and
[1:23:29] make promises they never experienced he
[1:23:31] made promises to the Thessalonians they
[1:23:34] never experienced amen
[1:23:35] but I want you to know in the season
[1:23:37] that we're living in God did not call
[1:23:39] you here to make a promise to you
[1:23:41] God does not call this gathering of the
[1:23:43] bride together to make promises to you
[1:23:45] but rather we are here to fulfill
[1:23:48] promises even we are not here to write a
[1:23:50] Bible we are here to fulfill the Bible
[1:23:53] we are not here to get a Bible promise
[1:23:56] we are here to fulfill a Bible promise
[1:23:58] this is the age of the manifesting of
[1:24:01] the sons of God that it's a season that
[1:24:04] we have come to even amen you didn't
[1:24:06] pick the season I didn't pick the season
[1:24:08] but god but God placed us in the season
[1:24:13] amen in here we are living in a season
[1:24:15] that I know when you say that that's
[1:24:17] going to load all kinds of pressure on
[1:24:19] the people Amen that we have to perform
[1:24:21] something we have to do something or we
[1:24:23] have to heal somebody but I mean let me
[1:24:25] just say it to you like this amen these
[1:24:27] are not pressures these are promises
[1:24:29] that have been made you know a man these
[1:24:33] are not pressures these are promises
[1:24:35] they men and I think about the Prophet
[1:24:38] telling the story one time about Paul
[1:24:40] Rader when he was so sick and he was in
[1:24:42] the bed and remember his wife was in the
[1:24:44] room prayed and he went out into I think
[1:24:46] I guess he would like it like a coma
[1:24:48] he went out and while he was out he had
[1:24:50] a he had a dream and in the dream he was
[1:24:52] a logger and he was up in the northern
[1:24:55] country and he was working and his boss
[1:24:57] man comes to him and told him said Paul
[1:24:59] you got to go up here and cut this big
[1:25:01] tree down him and you got to carry that
[1:25:03] tree back to the camp and and this is
[1:25:05] your job so the boss told him to do a
[1:25:07] job when he got up there and he looked
[1:25:09] at the big tree he thought my I'll cut
[1:25:11] this tree down and carry and then he got
[1:25:12] to looking at the tree and the size of
[1:25:15] it and
[1:25:15] Sybilla inability but he was under a
[1:25:18] commission from the boss to get it back
[1:25:20] to the camp so he found himself under
[1:25:23] pressure by the commission that he had
[1:25:26] been given he meant but but but he said
[1:25:28] that when he got it cut down he said a
[1:25:30] voice spoke to him and said Paul look
[1:25:32] right besides you there's a river
[1:25:34] running there amen and Paul if you just
[1:25:37] rolled that log over in the river you
[1:25:40] can ride the log back to camp so what
[1:25:43] was the pressure became Paul's ride amen
[1:25:46] he didn't carry the log the log carried
[1:25:49] him and Jesus Christ has commissioned
[1:25:52] this church to cast out devils Eamon he
[1:25:55] is commissioned this church to preach
[1:25:56] the gospel to do miracles Eamon the
[1:25:58] manifestations of the word is to be
[1:26:01] fulfilled in you and if you let it be a
[1:26:03] pressure on you that you find yourself
[1:26:06] trying to do something even but we're
[1:26:08] not trying to do anything but there is
[1:26:11] promises concerning the Church of the
[1:26:13] Living God amen and it is I rise tonight
[1:26:16] amen and we can just let the spirit do
[1:26:19] it amen amen when I think about this
[1:26:21] tonight I think of God telling that this
[1:26:23] is a season now if you study your Bibles
[1:26:27] you know that there was many promises
[1:26:29] that had not been fulfilled at the time
[1:26:31] of Jesus Christ and and to think that
[1:26:34] the words that had been spoken in Isaiah
[1:26:37] Malachi and Ezekiel and all the way back
[1:26:39] in the days of Abraham had laid in the
[1:26:42] pages of the Bible waiting to Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ came and when he was borned he
[1:26:47] fulfilled many prophecies hundreds of
[1:26:49] prophecies amen but it was in the last
[1:26:52] moments of his life while he was hanging
[1:26:54] on the tree that many prophecies came
[1:26:58] together in that one specific moment
[1:27:00] Haman amen and all of them begin to
[1:27:03] fulfill themselves right together it was
[1:27:05] like a it was like a short quick work
[1:27:07] where many prophecies were falling
[1:27:10] together at the same time now now don't
[1:27:12] look back to yourself this Lord and say
[1:27:14] well I wish we was living in the days of
[1:27:16] Jesus amen when God was doing something
[1:27:19] wonderful Haman I want you to know
[1:27:21] tonight that God is fulfilling many
[1:27:23] prophecies in the seasons that we are
[1:27:26] living in amen and things are happening
[1:27:28] right now whether you know that or not
[1:27:30] whether you have anything to do with it
[1:27:32] or not world governments are moving
[1:27:34] right now in the College of the
[1:27:36] prophecies of God to fulfill every word
[1:27:39] that God wrote is exactly the truth
[1:27:41] Haman I want you to know tonight that
[1:27:44] the Bible said as it was in the days of
[1:27:46] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:27:49] the Son of Man and you tell me when has
[1:27:51] there been a time amen since Sodom but
[1:27:54] homosexuality is the way that it is
[1:27:56] right now come on church amen the
[1:27:59] government is right now protecting
[1:28:02] homosexuality and it's it's wrong for me
[1:28:05] to sit here and condemn the thing can
[1:28:07] you imagine that we are living in
[1:28:09] America amen a country that is a
[1:28:12] Christian nation amen but the devil has
[1:28:14] so influenced the political realm but
[1:28:17] they're calling good evil and evil
[1:28:19] they're calling it good
[1:28:21] amen as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:28:24] shall it be in the coming of the Son of
[1:28:26] Man let me ask you is this a time of
[1:28:28] Sodom I mean is there anything that more
[1:28:31] matches Sodom and what we're seeing
[1:28:33] today Amen I say it the way a prophet
[1:28:35] said it one time he said if God don't
[1:28:38] destroy this nation he will have to
[1:28:39] raise Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize
[1:28:41] to it amen because we have come back to
[1:28:45] a time of Sodom listen friends amen I'm
[1:28:48] not just railing on something but the
[1:28:50] homosexuality was promised in the Bible
[1:28:53] it would be there and it's there
[1:28:56] and then the Bible says as it was in the
[1:28:58] days of Noah so shall it be in the same
[1:29:01] day amen you have a sodomite day you
[1:29:04] also have the days of Noah when the sons
[1:29:06] of God looked upon the daughters of man
[1:29:08] hey man have we got that day amen it's
[1:29:12] right here hey man fulfill the same at
[1:29:14] the same moment of time hey man the
[1:29:17] Scriptures tells us that the spiritual
[1:29:19] wickedness will reach high places it's
[1:29:22] at that time but that would be a spirit
[1:29:24] of delusion where men would believe a
[1:29:26] lie and be damned by the lie belief it's
[1:29:29] at that time even is that the time the
[1:29:31] Bible prophesied that it was calling me
[1:29:34] so the devil has his people in place
[1:29:37] it's a Roman Church in its place is the
[1:29:41] Protestant church in its place I begged
[1:29:44] you to answer to me tonight because the
[1:29:46] devil has put them in place with the
[1:29:48] power of his unbelief by his perverted
[1:29:52] power the devil has got his people in
[1:29:54] all of their places and they meant you
[1:29:57] you you if you would just be graceful
[1:29:59] women tonight amen but I believe that if
[1:30:02] the devil has a power to put people in
[1:30:05] his place amen don't you tell me that
[1:30:07] God don't have the power to put his
[1:30:10] people in their places
[1:30:12] the devil has Sodom in that place
[1:30:14] tonight I know that there's a bride
[1:30:16] that's in the hand of the magic card and
[1:30:19] the cogsa prophesy and begin to turn
[1:30:22] over your life and that's a that's an
[1:30:24] anointing that rests upon our lives that
[1:30:27] come from a prophetic word not because
[1:30:30] we wanted to be here tonight not because
[1:30:32] we've asked for these kinds of things
[1:30:34] but there was a word that was spoken
[1:30:36] over our lives in that word is coming
[1:30:39] out of the prophecy of the Bible and
[1:30:41] it's fulfilling the scriptures God has
[1:30:44] actually claimed your body to fulfill
[1:30:47] his prophecy in this last day what about
[1:30:50] Ezekiel the 37th chapter when a valley
[1:30:53] was full of dry bones and God said today
[1:30:56] ZQ really spawns live he said I don't
[1:30:59] know Lord
[1:31:00] I don't know Lord you know if they'll
[1:31:02] live he said prophesy prophet amen and
[1:31:05] the Prophet said hear ye Oh dry bones
[1:31:09] the word of the Lord
[1:31:11] now y'all help me out but I'm not a real
[1:31:13] learned guy amen but I don't think Amen

[1:31:19] and if you look at that skeleton have
[1:31:21] you ever seen one with ears no you have
[1:31:24] it and then bones didn't have no ears
[1:31:26] Amen they couldn't might hear the word
[1:31:29] of the Lord but the word of the Lord was
[1:31:31] commanded unto them bones and God raised
[1:31:34] him by pathetic anointing God has
[1:31:37] commanded a blessing was the Church of
[1:31:39] the Living God

[1:35:21] prophet of God said you get it down to
[1:35:23] the stump but you'll never destroy it

[1:37:07] principalities and powers is that right
[1:37:09] and you who he hath quickened or made
[1:37:12] alive sets with him in that power
[1:37:16] tonight

[1:37:30] you
[1:37:31] hey he told me that's right before even
[1:37:36] the world be damned he made his choice
[1:37:39] now the prophet of God said there has to
[1:37:42] come in Ephesians 2 this there has to
[1:37:45] come and moving into this Joshua would
[1:37:48] let the children over but they had to
[1:37:50] take the land amen they had to take it
[1:37:52] over six inches at a time a little here
[1:37:56] but the whole time they were moving in
[1:37:59] brother I tell you there was a church
[1:38:01] today that is taking the land of
[1:38:03] adoption and step by step glory the
[1:38:30] power of the word the secret is the
[1:38:33] world and she knows what he wants done
[1:38:38] with it hey man can you imagine the
[1:38:41] caterpillar and his argument amen with
[1:38:43] his insides when he comes to a certain
[1:38:46] point and he's an earthbound creature
[1:38:48] and something says climb that tree and
[1:38:50] he says I'm scared of heights I like my
[1:38:53] I like my existence down here and he
[1:38:56] says I'm not going up that tree but in a
[1:38:58] minute something on the inside is an
[1:39:01] absolute above his own mind and this God
[1:39:06] spoke a word concerning that caterpillar
[1:39:08] god never created caterpillar how many
[1:39:11] knows that God never created a
[1:39:14] caterpillar he created a butterfly
[1:39:18] on the journey created a fellowship
[1:39:54] under eating right you see you're
[1:39:58] something greater than you it's annoying
[1:40:01] and greater than you when that when that
[1:40:04] word starts preaching and start speaking
[1:40:06] do you see that little caterpillar after
[1:40:08] a while something takes over its body
[1:40:11] not it's mine it was the word spoken
[1:40:14] from the beginning in every step it
[1:40:17] takes us a safe lord even in its in its
[1:40:21] in its better opinion it's not going but
[1:40:23] it's not safe Lord every step goes right
[1:40:26] up amen after life finds himself up
[1:40:28] there in a tree and the absolute was the
[1:40:30] one that spoke concerning the thing
[1:40:32] before it was ever on the earth before
[1:40:35] it was ever there
[1:40:36] God's Word origin where it would go and
[1:40:39] hide we'd get there and what would be
[1:40:41] the outcome and the same God if he
[1:40:44] thinks that about a caterpillar what
[1:40:46] does he think about a child of God
[1:40:48] tonight you know I was preaching I'm in
[1:40:51] India one night and mentioned that you
[1:40:53] may have heard it I don't know but I was
[1:40:55] in India preaching I mentioned this very
[1:40:57] thing that there's an absolute over our
[1:40:59] lives and we was in a you know in a
[1:41:01] little classroom that night it was a
[1:41:03] well I say a little one that feet three
[1:41:05] four hundred people and we were we were
[1:41:07] in there and they had that thing filled
[1:41:09] up he's about twenty pastors 15 20
[1:41:11] whatever it was was sitting over on my
[1:41:13] right about as far as from here that
[1:41:15] wall when I went in there that night
[1:41:17] brother Jackson they had the wall filled
[1:41:19] up with posters like this amen but they
[1:41:22] were they were of him
[1:41:23] and there was about three or four of
[1:41:25] them on the wall behind me and I said to
[1:41:27] him can we take them down before I
[1:41:29] preach the gospel they said no by the
[1:41:30] way this is a Hindu school and we can
[1:41:33] use it but we can't change nothing about
[1:41:35] their gods or nothing we just use it to
[1:41:37] preach I said well alright then so they
[1:41:40] filled the building up and I'm preaching
[1:41:41] away and I'm just young I think it's my
[1:41:43] first or second trip to India and I'm
[1:41:45] preaching right away young in my
[1:41:47] ministry well as I'm preaching that was
[1:41:50] a woman about half way back in the in a
[1:41:52] far left like that she just fell out in
[1:41:54] the floor I didn't know what was
[1:41:56] happening
[1:41:57] she just started just squirming around
[1:41:59] she fell out like that she just moving
[1:42:01] around the floor like that nothing at
[1:42:03] first I thought well maybe she was just
[1:42:04] enjoying the spirit of something but in
[1:42:06] a minute i I felt the vibration of that
[1:42:08] thing and it was it was an evil spirit
[1:42:11] ISM had fell upon the woman and I didn't
[1:42:14] know what to do
[1:42:15] the Bible said preach the word be
[1:42:17] instant in season and and and I said
[1:42:20] well hey only thing I know is to preach
[1:42:22] the word
[1:42:23] I didn't can't preach it like it doesn't
[1:42:25] even happen whole church is looking at
[1:42:27] her and his spear lord put his hand on
[1:42:29] me said pray for that woman I stopped
[1:42:31] the meeting a man said everybody bow
[1:42:33] your heads and I made a prayer prayed
[1:42:35] over the woman when I got done praying
[1:42:37] for the woman I was I was going to go
[1:42:40] back to saying what I was saying before
[1:42:42] she failed and I just went back to
[1:42:44] preach him but instead of preaching and
[1:42:46] saying what was in my mind I heard my
[1:42:49] mouth say if God doesn't raise that
[1:42:51] woman up right now he's not even God I
[1:42:55] thought I almost covered my mouth for
[1:42:57] what have you said amen and I would
[1:43:00] never say that
[1:43:01] honest express her crazy saying if I
[1:43:04] said it ain't meant but I heard it come
[1:43:07] through me and when I did Amen there was
[1:43:10] an anointing found now this is from them
[1:43:12] pastor so this is what they told me the
[1:43:14] one brother went home with me that even
[1:43:16] have walked back toward the hotel he
[1:43:17] said brother Lawson he said when you
[1:43:18] pronounced the blessing on that woman
[1:43:21] and said God was gonna raise her he said
[1:43:23] that was a fog covered you he said we
[1:43:25] couldn't see you standing in the pulpit
[1:43:28] anymore
[1:43:29] like a mist that settled down in that
[1:43:31] room and now I could see it milky like
[1:43:33] but I didn't realize it was that
[1:43:35] powerful I could they was kind of foggy
[1:43:37] but I thought I was just energized amen
[1:43:40] but that was their compassion but when
[1:43:43] that happened all of a sudden that woman
[1:43:46] stood up off of the ground and she began
[1:43:48] to scream out and rejoice at the same
[1:43:50] moment that was a wind coming around and
[1:43:55] I could hear it blow I know if it's my
[1:43:57] ears or if it was a wee I didn't know
[1:43:59] what it was but you could just so
[1:44:00] physically hear it I didn't make it
[1:44:03] happen I was just there when it was
[1:44:05] happening
[1:44:05] and it come in the room just like that
[1:44:09] and that lady stood up and the place
[1:44:12] when in pandemonium I mean people
[1:44:14] shouting and screaming and hollering
[1:44:16] over the building amen and I didn't know
[1:44:18] what was happening
[1:44:19] but sister first turned to look like
[1:44:21] this and that wind had taken them
[1:44:23] posters off of the wall
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] the power of Jesus to righteousness
[1:44:56] again you see I tell you friend there's
[1:44:59] got to be an emphasis to this it's got
[1:45:01] to be in Ephesians 2 this word the
[1:45:04] prophet of God said these books has been
[1:45:05] sealed up for years but the Seventh Seal
[1:45:08] has opened up now it's open to us a new
[1:45:11] land it's opened us to a land the
[1:45:14] prophet of God said there must come and
[1:45:16] Ephesians 2 this an understanding of the
[1:45:20] book this is the age were in do you see
[1:45:25] this is the time when the church is
[1:45:27] coming in understanding now listen the
[1:45:30] last days the prophet of God said we are
[1:45:32] given an understanding now in the
[1:45:36] adoption the man says it like this I
[1:45:39] feel at this time then it's good to
[1:45:42] bring the church to a complete
[1:45:44] understanding positionally of who they
[1:45:48] are I think it's time we said for the
[1:45:51] church to come to complete understanding
[1:45:54] it's been a partial understanding the
[1:45:57] whole time but it's time to complete
[1:45:59] this thing it's time for the church to
[1:46:01] recognize you won't Bible prophecy I'll
[1:46:04] give it to you John 14 and 20 in that
[1:46:07] day you shall know not this not wonder
[1:46:11] not maybe but you shall know the father
[1:46:14] is in me and I in you and you and me
[1:46:16] that's what Jesus predicted in the last
[1:46:19] days that's why Paul said in Ephesians
[1:46:21] they meant pray that that God would open
[1:46:24] the eyes of our understanding Amen that
[1:46:27] we might be able to see but they stopped
[1:46:30] arise that vindicated word that
[1:46:33] the life of every heart and brings light
[1:46:35] into the vision of the Bride of Christ
[1:46:37] my to think tonight if we could just
[1:46:39] know who we are if the church can find
[1:46:42] out who they are they know what bless
[1:46:44] them loans to them they know what land
[1:46:46] belongs to them
[1:46:47] hey man need to think that it was under
[1:46:49] Joshua that the anointing came in
[1:46:51] inspiration and put every one of them in
[1:46:54] their position the message anointing
[1:46:57] will place you in the body accordingly
[1:46:59] to what God has saw you before the world
[1:47:03] began now if you can see clearly who you
[1:47:06] are then you'll know that when the
[1:47:08] troubles come the troubles have nothing
[1:47:10] to do with who you are and when a slave
[1:47:13] it after Samuel a prophet a prophet
[1:47:16] identify him as a king David did not
[1:47:20] make himself King a prophetic anointing
[1:47:23] made him King come on church David had
[1:47:28] oil pulled over David did not choose
[1:47:31] himself David did not ask to be King
[1:47:34] David was the last man they wanted to be
[1:47:38] king amen
[1:47:39] but God made David come he wouldn't let
[1:47:42] Samuel anoint nobody else he wouldn't
[1:47:46] let him prophesy over nobody else
[1:47:49] Samuel tronic his father wanted it done
[1:47:52] when God's withheld the blessing until
[1:47:55] David come really anointed David's well
[1:47:58] I'll tell you it was just a prophet
[1:47:59] speaking over a man was it the Bible
[1:48:02] said the fear of the Lord departed not
[1:48:04] from him from that day forward it was
[1:48:06] not an empty ceremony it was a prophetic
[1:48:09] word setting an order of redemption that
[1:48:13] one day there would be a bride who would
[1:48:16] be the eighth child amen in the Church
[1:48:18] of the Living God and she would be
[1:48:20] outside the church she wouldn't be in
[1:48:23] the church
[1:48:24] profit would have to say we tried seven
[1:48:27] ages but we couldn't annoyed none of
[1:48:30] them is that one more that's gotta be a
[1:48:34] prize somewhere
[1:48:35] churches churches price rise that's
[1:48:39] gotta be one it's gotta be a church
[1:48:41] somewhere this message can be poured out
[1:48:45] I pulled the Church of the Living God
[1:48:47] hey that's where we're coming to today
[1:48:49] that there's a prophetic anointing
[1:48:51] that's been placed upon the Church of
[1:48:53] the Living God you didn't ask for it
[1:48:56] you wasn't able to choose it yourself
[1:48:57] but God poured it on you brother
[1:49:00] amen and that is the power that it's
[1:49:03] working in our beans tonight now the
[1:49:07] prophet of God said God has had this all
[1:49:10] the time but he's been holding it he's
[1:49:15] been holding it think of it
[1:49:17] God has been holding this anointing he's
[1:49:21] been holding this great revelation how
[1:49:26] long's God been holding it now according
[1:49:28] to scriptures he's been holding it since
[1:49:30] the days of Adam the prophet of God said
[1:49:33] why's he been holding it he's been
[1:49:35] waiting to give his secret and fool he
[1:49:38] meant to fully so somebody can fully
[1:49:41] comprehend it he was waiting not only to
[1:49:44] give an understanding but of people he
[1:49:47] could give the understanding to now
[1:49:49] think of this because if you're high I
[1:49:52] mean is there any house builders in the
[1:49:54] house tonight
[1:49:54] any carpenters here Amen can you imagine
[1:49:57] describing to a three-year-old the pitch
[1:49:59] of the roof Amen I'm 45 and don't
[1:50:02] understand it yet can you imagine trying
[1:50:04] to break down amen how to put the
[1:50:07] foundation in and run the rebar to a
[1:50:09] three-year-old Amen you're wasting your
[1:50:11] breath they can't understand because the
[1:50:15] level of maturity is not there yet amen
[1:50:18] and the Church of the Living God Paul
[1:50:21] said it's not ready for the meat but
[1:50:24] there would be a sea
[1:50:25] can come that's right and this is the
[1:50:28] season of understanding this is a season
[1:50:32] of God releasing a comprehension upon
[1:50:36] the church that this is what has been in
[1:50:38] his mind the whole time the whole time
[1:50:41] God has had something in his mind a
[1:50:43] bride now notice this the property of
[1:50:48] God said of course he separated us and
[1:50:50] opened this new land to us this land
[1:50:53] that has been opened to the church is
[1:50:54] the Word of God is opened it's been
[1:50:57] opened for us to move into this land was
[1:51:00] not opened just to talk about it was a
[1:51:02] land open to go into if you go back in
[1:51:05] the days of this America when they first
[1:51:07] landed
[1:51:08] amen and and the men and women who come
[1:51:10] from Europe was escaping the presence of
[1:51:13] European ideas and the religions and
[1:51:16] they come to America for the basis of
[1:51:19] freedom of religion but there was a
[1:51:21] spirit that got upon them but they later
[1:51:24] in the history books call it manifest
[1:51:26] destiny and the people who landed on the
[1:51:29] rock didn't just camp around Plymouth
[1:51:31] Rock but it wasn't long they started
[1:51:34] moving towards the Mississippi River and
[1:51:36] there was something that possessed me to
[1:51:38] face every kind of hazard every kind of
[1:51:42] rugged land and rugged life people lost
[1:51:45] their families they become sick they
[1:51:47] meant what was they doing trying to
[1:51:49] reach the west coast amen Wow what was
[1:51:52] sets them people he mentions they meant
[1:51:54] but that was inheritance there they they
[1:51:56] knew the gold they knew the opportunity
[1:51:59] they knew of the taste of freedom they
[1:52:02] understood there was something worth the
[1:52:04] cost that they were paying amen they
[1:52:06] lost a lot but they gained everything he
[1:52:09] meant because it was in the west coast
[1:52:11] that the spirit had already prophesied
[1:52:14] at the same sign that was in the East
[1:52:16] was gonna come in the West
[1:52:19] and that West Coast had to have a place
[1:52:21] apart you'll know 1906 is where as Susur
[1:52:25] Street was on the west coast come on the
[1:52:31] Holy Ghost couldn't have come there amen
[1:52:33] unless there would have been a city of
[1:52:35] sadness and somebody knocked out the
[1:52:38] wilderness and build a city Amen that
[1:52:41] mr. Seymour can hold a revival on the
[1:52:44] sues the street and the Holy Ghost could
[1:52:46] feel every one of them somebody went
[1:52:49] before you to prepare a place for a
[1:52:53] season of the fulfillment of Joel the
[1:52:55] second chapter and that's the second
[1:52:57] chapter
[1:52:58] oh come on church you ain't hearing me
[1:53:00] somebody had to go out there and do that
[1:53:02] amen and pinnacles had to happen before
[1:53:05] somebody can open this word before these
[1:53:09] seals could come open now when those
[1:53:11] seals come open and I don't believe you
[1:53:13] already have to get to the first little
[1:53:14] page of the seals in camp right there I
[1:53:18] don't believe you ought to read that God
[1:53:20] sent a prophet and camp right there I
[1:53:23] personally I don't believe that we ought
[1:53:26] to just read there's nine spiritual
[1:53:27] gifts in the church in camp right there
[1:53:29] amen but I believe there's a land to
[1:53:31] possess I believe that's a land that's
[1:53:33] rich with milk and honey there's a land
[1:53:36] with grapes and abundance and treasures
[1:53:39] beyond the imagination resources that
[1:53:42] man hasn't even thought of yet ours that
[1:53:45] the church st. even realized yes the
[1:53:47] public of God said they would come a
[1:53:49] time in the church that limbs would grow
[1:53:52] out a mint that they wouldn't appear by
[1:53:55] the spoken word y'all recognize what
[1:53:57] season we're living in
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:02] Amen do you recognize it won't be a
[1:54:04] service different than this one it won't
[1:54:08] be a service different than this one I
[1:54:10] mean I've seen a woman a man sitting
[1:54:13] about where you are in a meeting one
[1:54:14] night and cancer dropped off of a man's
[1:54:17] body just like that what it was the same
[1:54:19] atmosphere we're in right now he was in
[1:54:22] a different service it wasn't a
[1:54:24] different anointing it wasn't a
[1:54:26] different speaker it was a different
[1:54:27] place but it was the same anointing the
[1:54:30] same word the same way you don't have to
[1:54:39] go to a special place you don't have to
[1:54:41] go to a special room somewhere in that
[1:54:44] little room it's the opening of the word
[1:54:47] and brings a tabernacle right in the
[1:54:49] church now these seals have opened up
[1:54:54] the time for the church to move on amen
[1:54:57] look we're not laying again the
[1:54:59] principles and foundations this one's
[1:55:01] going to perfection you ain't stopping
[1:55:06] short you're going to perfection the
[1:55:09] thing that stopped every age is out of
[1:55:12] the way you don't think them
[1:55:15] Pentecostals would have did it brother
[1:55:16] if them seals wouldn't have been over
[1:55:18] would have been open all do you think
[1:55:20] them Lutheran's they fasted and prayed
[1:55:22] for what you got
[1:55:23] amen but God started you were they
[1:55:25] stopped
[1:55:27] come on God started to when they stopped
[1:55:29] he meant the man that landed on Plymouth
[1:55:32] Rock did not build Los Angeles remember
[1:55:35] somebody started where he stopped and
[1:55:37] somebody else started where he stopped
[1:55:39] in the Church of the Living God this
[1:55:41] bride has started where the Pentecostals
[1:55:44] have stopped amen we are not a
[1:55:46] Pentecostal we are the first born
[1:55:49] experts of the Living God we are
[1:55:51] Christians to lie we are not some
[1:55:54] Presbyterians and Catholics and Romans
[1:55:57] we are the sons and daughters of the old
[1:55:59] magic God under an Avon hemic covenant
[1:56:02] we are all one in Christ Jesus
[1:56:07] and you gotta admit this is a special
[1:56:10] age you have to admit that nobody ever
[1:56:14] lived in a time like this why because it
[1:56:18] was in Daniel then you'll still up the
[1:56:20] book and shut it until when the time of
[1:56:23] the end out of the time of the end being
[1:56:26] knowledge shall increase and them that
[1:56:29] believe their God shall do exploits is
[1:56:32] that right in the same time of knowledge
[1:56:35] it's the same time as a great faith that
[1:56:37] will move in the church now that tells
[1:56:40] me two trees are gonna bloom at the same
[1:56:42] time as Jesus said in the days when you
[1:56:44] see the fig tree Israel putting forth
[1:56:47] its bud but if you read the book of Luke
[1:56:49] it said fig tree and all other trees all
[1:56:53] other trees Billy Graham brought the
[1:56:56] badness treat of fruit all Roberts
[1:56:58] brought the crispy church to fruit Amen
[1:57:01] somebody amen must bring the bride to
[1:57:04] fruit
[1:57:05] it's rapture time it's fruit time for
[1:57:09] the Church of the Living God now back to
[1:57:11] trees of course if you look at the Tree
[1:57:14] of Life and the tree of knowledge both
[1:57:15] of them was in Eden and both of them's
[1:57:17] in the scripture in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:57:19] it describes but that Satan was there as
[1:57:22] a great cherub
[1:57:23] he's the tree of knowledge which is
[1:57:25] still here amen but if it's a person
[1:57:27] that the tree of life is a person Jesus
[1:57:29] Christ and I say at 53 he said he would
[1:57:33] be a tree you wouldn't desire for its
[1:57:34] beauty it won't be a beautiful tree but
[1:57:38] it'll be a tree of life amen
[1:57:40] and in its limbs you will find
[1:57:41] everything that you have need us but
[1:57:44] being a tree it has grown unto adoption
[1:57:47] season or should I say fruit season amen
[1:57:50] and when is that's when the tree shows
[1:57:53] forth its life it's been a tree the
[1:57:56] whole time you go out here in the trees
[1:57:58] or all right right here all the time but
[1:58:00] a certain season them trees blew and the
[1:58:03] tree gives our fruit and you know a mint
[1:58:05] you'll know an orange tree from a pear
[1:58:07] tree in the time of its fruit it's when
[1:58:10] those who walking by it can pick and
[1:58:13] live by the existence of the life of
[1:58:17] that season my to think that God who
[1:58:20] always was becomes in a way that people
[1:58:24] now are picking the fruit to live from
[1:58:27] that tree now of course there's actually
[1:58:31] two trees laying there so both of them
[1:58:33] it's trees of life and tree of knowledge
[1:58:35] now the thing is the scientific world
[1:58:38] and men is almost out doing you they are
[1:58:42] climbing the tree of knowledge at such a
[1:58:44] rapid expansion until that they have
[1:58:47] just just in my lifetime brother amen do
[1:58:51] you know that there was the time I
[1:58:52] remember no microwave ovens but there's
[1:58:55] some young people in here has no clue
[1:58:56] what it means does not have a microwave
[1:58:58] I remember when there was no Atari most
[1:59:04] people in here that Atari is an ancient
[1:59:06] history lesson and they moved on to Xbox
[1:59:08] and Playstation and now they're probably
[1:59:10] some I never
[1:59:11] heard of come on there's people in here
[1:59:15] that never knew what it was to not have
[1:59:17] a cell phone
[1:59:19] I was a traveling preacher that had to
[1:59:21] stop on the side of the road and couple
[1:59:23] somebody on the payphone you know what
[1:59:27] it sounds like to dial a phone oh wait
[1:59:33] no nothing that I there's people in here
[1:59:35] that don't know what that is
[1:59:38] they don't even know we had somebody
[1:59:40] does that keep remember who it was I
[1:59:42] better be careful but they didn't even
[1:59:43] know how to open the cassette tape
[1:59:46] couldn't figure out how to open the box
[1:59:48] they didn't know what a cassette tape
[1:59:50] blahs amen most of them don't even know
[1:59:53] what CDs are now in the advance Mitch
[1:59:56] come on now and when my granddaddy died
[1:59:59] at 53 year old with a massive heart
[2:00:01] attack heart disease my mother at 70 the
[2:00:04] other day got a heart
[2:00:06] got it got a new vowel in her heart took
[2:00:08] him a couple hours if my granddad would
[2:00:10] be living now he would have got his
[2:00:12] heart fixed and lived a long life
[2:00:14] because medical science has advanced
[2:00:16] until they can take your heart out and
[2:00:18] put it in somebody else and make that
[2:00:20] person live Medical Sciences went beyond
[2:00:23] amen natural sciences wouldn't be on and
[2:00:26] then technology has come to the place
[2:00:28] where you can sit here and talk a video
[2:00:31] call to somebody on the other side of
[2:00:33] the world when I was a little kid and
[2:00:36] then I'd watch George Jetson Zinn on
[2:00:38] Saturday morning can I be real with
[2:00:44] y'all okay
[2:00:46] I was a little boy and brother Jack I
[2:00:48] climb up on my mom's couch and eat Lucky
[2:00:51] Charms and my favorite sir and I'd eat
[2:00:53] Lucky Charms amen and I'd be in my
[2:00:55] underwear that's all just setting them
[2:00:57] on to eight or nine year old little boy
[2:00:59] Connor and I'll be watching George
[2:01:00] Jetson
[2:01:01] amen and you know what they do George
[2:01:03] Jetson they would have a phone call on
[2:01:05] there and it would be one of those video
[2:01:08] calls and I laughing took my brother I'm
[2:01:10] glad we ain't got that telephone
[2:01:11] cuz I'm said to mind we're eating
[2:01:13] material if the phone would ring
[2:01:16] amen and what I thought was a craziest
[2:01:19] thing that ever was today I was in India
[2:01:23] the other day and in the middle of the
[2:01:24] night called my wife and there she was
[2:01:26] and that was my dog and my kids and they
[2:01:28] were talking back and forth I tell you
[2:01:31] Amen civilization and science amen have
[2:01:35] climbed the tree of knowledge until
[2:01:37] they're tapping into things that man did
[2:01:40] not know existed 40 years ago but right
[2:01:44] now it's a reality it's not somebody say
[2:01:47] more Sunday we're gonna have these
[2:01:48] things you can Katherine your pocket
[2:01:50] brother we got them right now and the
[2:01:53] little generation don't have to be
[2:01:55] taught how to use from it that's funny
[2:01:56] your five-year-old can do more with your
[2:01:59] phone than you can you know why they
[2:02:03] don't fear it they don't fear it they're
[2:02:07] not scared to pick it up and use it
[2:02:11] [Music]
[2:02:14] maybe you never heard of the message of
[2:02:17] the hour but you never heard of a
[2:02:19] cellphone either but you're using it
[2:02:21] today and then that's not scared of it
[2:02:24] will be proficient with it and find the
[2:02:27] necessities of the Mason part hey do you
[2:02:31] see Medical Sciences moving there try
[2:02:34] Amanda tree of knowledge they didn't get
[2:02:36] on one limb and stay there the whole
[2:02:37] time they didn't find out about about
[2:02:40] medical science about hearts and just
[2:02:42] stay right there but when they went over
[2:02:44] in the Roddick's of the brain they found
[2:02:46] out things about the heart amen on that
[2:02:49] Liam they begin to understand things it
[2:02:51] was questions and the higher they get
[2:02:53] things that were great questions forty
[2:02:55] years ago
[2:02:56] it's simple answers to great children
[2:02:58] right now listen the Church of the
[2:03:00] Living God can learn from this we cannot
[2:03:03] hear boy Liam a predestination and stay
[2:03:06] there the rest of our lives
[2:03:08] amen we're not on the Liam we're on the
[2:03:10] tree and we got to keep climbing up that
[2:03:14] tree we got to keep moving up that tree

[2:03:22] god that don't have a limit the only
[2:03:29] limit God's gots the one you put on me

[2:04:42] unlimited God to think that we can go
[2:04:45] above our senses we can go above our
[2:04:48] abilities we can buy fly above a sense
[2:04:51] bound existence because we have untapped
[2:04:54] resources the resources you ain't you

[2:05:26] and Joseph's garnished and the lifetime
[2:05:29] of fish he cannot drink all the waters
[2:05:31] in the ocean and you will never find the
[2:05:34] limits of God in this life I don't care

[2:06:50] somebody was at the door and say look
[2:06:51] hey man it's the wrong season no no that
[2:06:56] God just now did it you could have told
[2:06:59] me that yesterday but not today
[2:07:02] yesterday that was true
[2:07:04] I had motives but today no it's not true
[2:07:06] listen sir this is my season the man
[2:07:09] invited me to get all I could get
[2:07:12] now if you've been in Walmart you go in
[2:07:14] Walmart you you mean half the church in
[2:07:16] there most of the time I don't know if
[2:07:17] it's like it here but back where I come
[2:07:19] from an Arkansas that was a social
[2:07:21] gathering you go didn't matter when you
[2:07:23] win it was always there you know and
[2:07:26] when you first walk in Walmart you know

[2:07:31] the comic books and there's the pencils
[2:07:33] then there's the deodorant and there's
[2:07:36] the truth paste and all the things all
[2:07:39] the cheap stuff it's up front
[2:07:42] yep it's time way all the cheap stuffs
[2:07:45] away from the door they got the good
[2:07:48] stuff in the back the computers in the
[2:07:56] back of that store we're a long ways
[2:07:59] from the door you know what people do
[2:08:00] they'll come in and I've seen to her
[2:08:02] times will get right in the front door
[2:08:04] and meet somebody with stand right there
[2:08:05] and talk half a day amen and we never
[2:08:08] make it they meant but you've got to
[2:08:11] understand as a church and when a
[2:08:14] prophet brought us in the front door he
[2:08:16] brought us in there and said look this
[2:08:18] is all y'all's this this belongs to you
[2:08:21] get your possession it's both paid for
[2:08:23] and gave me the receipt for it but he
[2:08:26] said but you got to go get it yourself
[2:08:28] all God can do is buy it you got to go
[2:08:31] get it
[2:08:32] you got to get a man now let me ask you
[2:08:34] a men if they had that they had that big
[2:08:36] screen Apple computer you've been long
[2:08:39] and a half and it was up on the top
[2:08:41] shelf and you knew that baby was yours
[2:08:44] would you find a way to get it you maybe
[2:08:47] you can't reach it but you're gonna find
[2:08:50] to reach it you're gonna get a ladder to
[2:08:52] get up there and get it
[2:08:54] amen because it's out of your reach but
[2:08:56] it belongs to you
[2:08:57] listen Church there are promises that's
[2:09:00] in this Bible that you have been at the
[2:09:02] front door of the word but there's
[2:09:04] things that belong to you
[2:09:06] but you gotta keep going in you got a
[2:09:08] progressive Amen the things you're
[2:09:11] looking for it's past the front door
[2:09:13] it's on the other side you know belongs
[2:09:18] to you everything belongs to you it's
[2:09:21] already bought and paid for I'll tell
[2:09:24] you what a prophet said every dipped a
[2:09:25] blessing that Christ died for is already
[2:09:27] yours the devil is only trying to bluff
[2:09:30] you out of possessing it that's right
[2:09:32] amen I wondered one time where the
[2:09:34] receipt was but in Isaiah 53 and 5 the
[2:09:38] Bible said he was wounded for our
[2:09:40] transgressions you know what that means
[2:09:44] he meant your transgressions they've
[2:09:46] been paid for you know that's pretty
[2:09:50] powerful to me that our transgressions
[2:09:53] have been people I want you to tell
[2:09:55] somebody they're paid for he was bruised
[2:10:00] for our iniquities a mentality the thing
[2:10:06] that's keeping you from believing you
[2:10:09] can possess the promise the Bible said
[2:10:11] he was bruised for our iniquity your
[2:10:14] iniquity has been paid for I want you to
[2:10:19] tell somebody gets paid for they know
[2:10:24] you got iniquity but they might not know
[2:10:27] it's paid for so tell them it's paid for
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:31] [Applause]
[2:10:36] blessed is the man who God whoa Kelly
[2:10:40] see pay for bait by the righteous flood
[2:10:45] of Jesus Christ he paid a debt I could
[2:10:50] not pay he paid for the chastisement of
[2:11:03] our peace was upon him pay for the
[2:11:06] stripes by his stripes we are healed my
[2:11:11] healing paid for that's right if you
[2:11:14] believe it tonight the prophet of God
[2:11:16] said some of these things might be out
[2:11:17] of your reach but all you need to do is
[2:11:20] get a ladder and climb up get that's
[2:11:22] right it belongs to you anyhow it's time
[2:11:25] to move on it's time for the church to
[2:11:28] go into the unlimited power that God has
[2:11:31] give them to you Yemenite I want to
[2:11:33] shock you have you got some seat belts
[2:11:35] I want you shocked you just a minute man
[2:11:37] is omnipotent
[2:11:41] now that means all-powerful using the
[2:11:45] same word the Bible tells us that God is
[2:11:48] whole impotent but God included you in
[2:11:52] Olympians when he said whatsoever thing
[2:11:55] you say we can have it if you desire it
[2:11:58] he gave you all power now listen I don't
[2:12:03] want to argue the point but let's just
[2:12:04] make it clear you tell me what weak spot
[2:12:07] is there in God is there a weak place in
[2:12:10] God then if any God is in you then all
[2:12:14] power is in you it's not coming it's in
[2:12:17] you
[2:12:18] the Holy Ghost is the power that lives
[2:12:21] in the church that if the Holy Ghost is
[2:12:24] in you the same God that created the
[2:12:26] earth is in you right now
[2:12:28] then this makes in omnipotence coming to
[2:12:31] the church amen if an omnipotent is in a
[2:12:34] believer and an omnipotent God comes and
[2:12:37] meets the believer to omnipotence our
[2:12:39] coming together
[2:12:40] amen and when our nipa tense comes
[2:12:43] together the miraculous begins to happen
[2:12:45] to think tonight that miracles are right
[2:12:48] in front of the church if they can
[2:12:50] understand perfectly who they are by the
[2:12:53] blood of Jesus Christ not by your
[2:12:55] abilities not by what you have done but
[2:12:58] by the blood and the blood has spoken
[2:13:00] prophetic words over your life and made
[2:13:03] you what you are by his doing now he
[2:13:07] that had begun work is able to perform
[2:13:11] that which he has begun
[2:13:13] amen God's have finished your church God
[2:13:17] didn't start this without finishing it
[2:13:19] but Malachi 4 is the finisher according
[2:13:23] to revelation Stan this is a finishing
[2:13:25] anointing when God will finish the
[2:13:28] church by tapping the church off with a
[2:13:31] token of himself now to think of this
[2:13:34] then this brings a perfect faith to an
[2:13:38] omnipotent people making them the master
[2:13:41] of every situation so by the weighing
[2:13:44] that can't be me that's what's wrong
[2:13:46] right now
[2:13:47] that can't be me but you have been a
[2:13:50] called according to this purpose that
[2:13:53] God would have a church that is
[2:13:55] omnipotent in its power to think tonight
[2:13:58] that there are places that we have not
[2:14:00] yet went that is available to us there
[2:14:03] are things that we could have that we
[2:14:05] have not yet touched but they are
[2:14:07] resources been bought and paid for
[2:14:09] through the blood of Jesus Christ see
[2:14:12] you gotta have faith in what you're
[2:14:13] doing and if you know what you're doing
[2:14:15] by revelation you have a circumstance
[2:14:17] that you can control because you become
[2:14:21] the master of it now I don't know if you
[2:14:24] realize this but the Bible isn't
[2:14:26] finished
[2:14:29] I know most people think it is but the
[2:14:31] Bible there's one book in the Bible
[2:14:33] that's not finished and that is the book
[2:14:36] of Acts amen if God ever has another
[2:14:40] church it will be a continuation of the
[2:14:44] book of Acts because the acts of the
[2:14:47] Holy Spirit would act in the church all
[2:14:49] the way until the end of time to think
[2:14:54] tonight there's a branch a branch of the
[2:14:56] Lord on this great tree now the origin
[2:14:59] of the church is masters masters of
[2:15:01] every circumstance now I know you think
[2:15:04] you're weak but Jesus come to your weak
[2:15:06] flesh starve himself in fasting until he
[2:15:10] brought the flesh in its weakest
[2:15:13] condition so deity in the weakness of
[2:15:16] flesh in the weakness of that flesh used
[2:15:20] the word only to overcome his greatest
[2:15:24] enemy now you gotta you gotta ask
[2:15:26] yourself why with the Lord only used the
[2:15:28] word because listen he withheld power to
[2:15:35] show you power listen put it to you like
[2:15:39] this not everybody that was going to
[2:15:42] stand against the devil would have been
[2:15:44] the fullness of the godhead bill and
[2:15:45] bodily so if the fullness of the Godhead
[2:15:48] dwell in bodily defeated Satan with some
[2:15:50] great supernatural power then it would
[2:15:52] have been every one of us looking for
[2:15:54] that supernatural power to defeat our
[2:15:56] enemy but Jesus the greatest of all
[2:15:59] powers reserved power and overcome the
[2:16:03] devil by saying it is written but it's
[2:16:07] not what you're overcoming it's how
[2:16:10] you're overcoming the church is
[2:16:13] overcoming by the word then when the
[2:16:16] church is coming into the word it's the
[2:16:18] greatest anointing they can receive is
[2:16:21] the word after the Lord my to think as
[2:16:25] the church is moving forward then
[2:16:26] they're moving forward in power now now
[2:16:29] listen I know that we have tongues in
[2:16:31] the church and we've seen gifts from the
[2:16:33] church but tongues is not a stopping
[2:16:35] place
[2:16:36] it was a starting place gifts what's not
[2:16:40] a stopping place it was a starting place
[2:16:42] but the Church of the Living God is
[2:16:44] moving far beyond just a gift they have
[2:16:47] received a giver and a translation
[2:16:50] anointing that will change their body
[2:16:52] not belittling the gifts they're a part
[2:16:55] of the body but it was where you started
[2:16:58] not where you stopped to think that God
[2:17:01] has given the church tonight untapped
[2:17:03] resources now to think your doctor is
[2:17:06] limited but God is not your abilities
[2:17:11] are limited but God is not do you see
[2:17:15] that God has given the church something
[2:17:17] now and you can go over and you can
[2:17:19] watch the Joshua and Caleb went over in
[2:17:21] the land they picked the grapes up and
[2:17:22] they come back
[2:17:23] amen and we talk about the grapes of the
[2:17:25] land but at some point we've got to
[2:17:27] realize that we own the land the grapes
[2:17:31] come out of us and people talk about the
[2:17:36] gifts I love the gifts but we own the
[2:17:38] land that gifts come out up we don't
[2:17:41] have a cluster of grapes brother we own
[2:17:44] the vineyards we don't just work in the
[2:17:47] fields our house is the house on the
[2:17:50] hill right middle attitude toward every
[2:18:01] word of God will bring it to pass
[2:18:04] that's right let's just take a look you
[2:18:07] gotta check sign it fill it out hey man
[2:18:11] do you see we are now sons of God listen
[2:18:15] I I know that you know this but let me
[2:18:18] tell you if you don't know it you are
[2:18:19] right now sons not you're going to be
[2:18:23] sons not much someday we're gonna be
[2:18:26] sons but the prophet of God said now we
[2:18:29] are the sons of God listen people saw a
[2:18:32] runaway Sunday in the Millennium we're
[2:18:34] gonna have great things we don't need
[2:18:35] miracles in the Millennium
[2:18:38] we don't need spoken word powers in the
[2:18:41] Millennium we're gonna have immortal
[2:18:43] bodies the devil will be bound a
[2:18:45] thousand years we won't need something
[2:18:48] to fight the devil he will be there
[2:18:50] fighting us but tonight we need the
[2:18:52] power tonight we need the supernatural
[2:18:55] tonight we need the grace of God amen
[2:18:58] what we really need is some preachers to
[2:19:00] call it present tense what we need is
[2:19:03] some anointed men and daughters of God
[2:19:05] to call these promises right now that we
[2:19:08] some at some point we have to quit
[2:19:11] putting this in the future and believe
[2:19:13] that this is ours but this is our
[2:19:15] promise this is what God gave us listen
[2:19:18] friends if you could catch the
[2:19:20] revelation tonight this is a present
[2:19:22] tense truth now something has to unlock
[2:19:30] this door Jesus is the doors that write
[2:19:36] everything on the other side of that
[2:19:38] door belongs to you if the doors locked
[2:19:42] faith is the key faith is the key to the
[2:19:48] door once the doors open it's all yours
[2:19:51] now the thing about the thing about a
[2:19:55] key is a key works on the door you know
[2:19:58] sometimes I'm out of town a lot and
[2:20:01] sometimes if I got a good friend coming
[2:20:03] by you know I'll leave a key by the door
[2:20:06] do you know that key is to that door but
[2:20:11] it don't really matter if Nathan if
[2:20:13] Nathan comes by he don't live there but
[2:20:16] if Nathan comes by I say there's a key
[2:20:18] under the mat do you know that key will
[2:20:20] work in his hand he can hand that key to
[2:20:28] his three-year-old to one and a half
[2:20:34] now somebody might have to lift her up
[2:20:38] but if her little hand could get ahold
[2:20:40] of that key it would work the same for
[2:20:43] her it does for me to get these promises
[2:20:57] [Applause]
[2:21:03] [Applause]
[2:21:06] [Music]
[2:21:08] [Applause]
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:17] we are everything that God's got for you
[2:21:23] the door of Jesus Christ if you can't
[2:21:27] believe it all things are possible
[2:21:29] somebody's put this in your hand I'm on
[2:21:33] Church when this word opened up it was a
[2:21:35] sword of the word the third pool hey
[2:21:38] will it work
[2:21:39] absolutely in a prophets hand you bet it
[2:21:42] will amen but the Prophet gave the sword
[2:21:45] to the church I read my Bible same as
[2:21:50] you do revelations of fifth chapter John
[2:21:53] nobody's worthy nobody can take the book
[2:21:57] but after the seventh verse of the tenth
[2:22:01] chapter something happened because the
[2:22:05] same boy says said you can't have it
[2:22:07] John after the seventh verse said come
[2:22:10] and take it John a meant something
[2:22:13] changed a prophetic word was given to
[2:22:17] the church but annoying
[2:22:19] you to take this book don't know tell me
[2:22:23] hey man do you see said come and take
[2:22:25] the book out of the hands of the angel
[2:22:26] don't tell me he was talking about a
[2:22:28] Bible probably God said we don't need a
[2:22:31] new Bible we don't need a new book
[2:22:35] we need a revelation the one we got what
[2:22:40] was John coming to get the revelation he
[2:22:43] was receiving the revelation of the word
[2:22:45] that had been lost but it's restored
[2:22:49] tonight under the message of the hour
[2:22:51] listen church if this if this message of
[2:22:53] the hour can only declare to you that
[2:22:56] Christ is here listen amen a present in
[2:23:00] truth Christ is here the prophet of God
[2:23:03] said my ministry is to declare him he is
[2:23:06] here the headship is here think about it
[2:23:10] but the word has brought him here if he
[2:23:15] is here abundance is here power is here
[2:23:19] Joe said bet you bet your floors she'll
[2:23:23] be full of wheat and your vats
[2:23:25] she'll be full of all don't sound like a
[2:23:28] famine to me don't sound like a fan
[2:23:33] sounds like your floors will be full of
[2:23:36] wheat and your vats will be full of all
[2:23:38] where's it coming from brother
[2:23:40] it's Elijah's anointing
[2:23:44] every time Elijah showed up there was an
[2:23:46] abundance come on and what's always
[2:23:50] abundance under that man ever said
[2:23:52] abundance of all habits abundance of
[2:23:54] meal it was an abundance of angels that
[2:23:56] was abundance of the grace of God that
[2:23:58] was an abundance of rain and the Church
[2:24:01] of the Living God has heard the sounds
[2:24:04] of the abundance of rain now
[2:24:12] now friends if that abundance has been
[2:24:16] brought to the church I believe tonight
[2:24:17] then it's time for the church to wake up
[2:24:20] I think it's time to wake up and realize
[2:24:24] what you're dealing with two to two
[2:24:27] lepers were at the gates of see
[2:24:29] remembers they were at the gates of
[2:24:31] Syria and they were dying than the gates
[2:24:32] and there was a famine going on in Syria
[2:24:36] and it was a great army so if they went
[2:24:38] in they'd started in if I went that way
[2:24:40] they'd die from the Army and they sent
[2:24:42] they're dying in the gates they said
[2:24:44] there's stagnant dying in the gates but
[2:24:47] one morning they woke up to Inspiration
[2:24:51] amen little did they know that over in
[2:24:54] Samaria the night before Elijah and
[2:24:57] Elijah had prophesied by this time
[2:24:59] tomorrow by this time tomorrow there
[2:25:04] will be abundance of food where there
[2:25:06] has been a shortage amen and the men
[2:25:09] woke up the next morning not even
[2:25:11] knowing the prophecy was there but the
[2:25:13] inspiration of that prophecy fell upon
[2:25:16] them as the Sun rose up they said why

[2:27:23] this country and I don't want to I don't
[2:27:25] want to scare you remember I I listen to
[2:27:28] some of the the early the early movement
[2:27:30] leaders and how they influenced and what
[2:27:32] they did and you know what they meant
[2:27:33] something about them man they knew
[2:27:36] something was ahead of them and they was
[2:27:38] unstoppably because they caught a little
[2:27:41] glimpse of the future and I want you to
[2:27:43] know tonight but there's a bride amen
[2:27:47] there's a bride that is unstoppable
[2:27:49] there is a bride on this earth today
[2:27:52] listen brother if the devil couldn't
[2:27:54] stop David Wicca life if the Amalekites
[2:27:59] couldn't stop Moses in the valley if the
[2:28:02] Red Sea couldn't hold him if they row
[2:28:04] couldn't hold him if the Jordan couldn't
[2:28:06] hold Joshua if the walls of Jericho
[2:28:08] could not hold the children of God out
[2:28:11] of the promise what makes you fake the
[2:28:13] devil that's something that can hold
[2:28:15] this bride out of the promises of God in
[2:28:18] this thing couldn't stop David and then
[2:28:20] gonna stop you they couldn't stop Joshua
[2:28:23] and they ain't gonna stop you couldn't
[2:28:26] stop Moses and you ain't gonna stop you

[2:28:30] Rahab and he ain't gonna stop you
[2:28:33] [Applause]
[2:28:36] because she's unstoppable
[2:28:40] do you recognize somebody wrapped a cord
[2:28:44] around you they were they they threw
[2:28:46] something around you called prophecy
[2:28:49] it's an absolute it's a tie post and
[2:28:53] you're not just holding on to it it's
[2:28:55] tied to you
[2:28:57] and God is pulling the cords of prophecy
[2:29:00] and there ain't nothin there ain't
[2:29:04] nothin can hold those prophecies from
[2:29:07] fulfilling themselves when they begin to
[2:29:09] manifest their an unstoppable presence
[2:29:12] it's an unstoppable annoy it's called
[2:29:14] your destiny and there ain't nothing
[2:29:16] could keep you out of that
[2:29:18] listen amen hit me hit me hit me like
[2:29:20] thinking somehow that you could stop the
[2:29:22] Sun from rising it would be easier to
[2:29:25] stop the Sun than stop this right
[2:29:30] [Applause]
[2:29:36] jesus said heavens and earth can pass
[2:29:38] away but my word it shall never fail but
[2:29:43] first last two priests went bail but the
[2:29:46] second one is rising up there's a bride
[2:29:50] rising on the scene by the anointing of
[2:29:52] God Sheen holding herself up but there's
[2:29:57] an anointing resting on her an
[2:30:00] unstoppable anointing you know the
[2:30:03] problem rather you know the real problem
[2:30:04] is we're letting the devil do it we're
[2:30:07] letting the devil ride it's like riding
[2:30:10] your bicycle and then you write it in
[2:30:13] the sand you're gonna pull the back in
[2:30:15] the sand you're still riding but you
[2:30:18] ain't going nowhere you're still riding
[2:30:21] but it's hard it's like trying to run a
[2:30:24] race with a man riding on your back
[2:30:26] you're still running but you ain't
[2:30:28] running fast you're still running but
[2:30:31] chain running far and you're doing
[2:30:32] something Amen with a lot of work it
[2:30:35] don't have to be that hard you know go
[2:30:39] Jack Lord showed me something one day I
[2:30:40] was preaching and just come in my mind
[2:30:42] that people is actually given the devil
[2:30:44] a ride people are actually giving the
[2:30:49] devil a ride you know if you have ever
[2:30:52] y'all ever play a war with somebody on
[2:30:54] your back let somebody on your back you
[2:30:56] play chicken and play war when I was a
[2:30:58] kid we used to do it is easier than the
[2:31:00] swimming pool but but we should because
[2:31:01] it's long fall on the ground
[2:31:05] you should let people jump on her back
[2:31:07] but you know if if somebody's on your
[2:31:09] back it's hard to move around but do you
[2:31:13] see what happens is we let the devil get
[2:31:16] on us and then we carrying the church
[2:31:22] [Music]
[2:31:24] and sometimes he's a heavy devil and you
[2:31:28] can't worship because you got your arms
[2:31:30] wrapped around hold that thing and you
[2:31:32] can't jump high cause you're way too
[2:31:34] much but you're carrying that down you
[2:31:38] carry that thing in the church and you
[2:31:40] can't hear good you can't shout you

[2:31:47] about you but but if you ever get sick
[2:31:49] of playing that game all you really have

[2:35:43] in that gymnasium as big as you and you
[2:35:47] know he was a bully he'd take the

[2:38:07] him to be your doctor
[2:38:09] the devil lies to you every time you
[2:38:12] talk to him
[2:38:14] why would you listen to him it's enough
[2:38:20] we're now sons this is our ground
[2:38:24] belongs to us Wayne was just talking
[2:39:04] about sometimes you just get enough
[2:39:06] right if you've been pushed you want to
[2:39:10] push back and was just kind of thinking
[2:39:12] on two different occasions one was I
[2:39:17] believe it's a dream that the Prophet
[2:39:18] had and how he said there was a man that
[2:39:22] looked like his father in a dream and he
[2:39:26] was taking this this three corner stick
[2:39:29] man which was Trinitarian teaching and
[2:39:33] he was striking this woman amen in the
[2:39:35] dream that looked like his mama they say
[2:39:38] that man had big muscles and it just say
[2:39:41] say every time he was just kind of hit
[2:39:42] and hit the woman and and you know every
[2:39:45] time she drives up to do something he
[2:39:47] would just rise up and hit him you know
[2:39:49] and he got to a point he said you know
[2:39:51] I'm just kind of got tired of seeing
[2:39:52] this man hit my mama like that right and
[2:39:56] it says you know I he said I finally got
[2:39:59] some strength and I looked at the man
[2:40:01] sitting up next time you hit him you
[2:40:04] gonna have to deal with me and they say
[2:40:06] so they said never seemed like his
[2:40:08] strength got bigger and his muscles got
[2:40:10] bigger and the man got weaker and so
[2:40:13] what we got to get to the point they man
[2:40:15] where we begin to speak back to the
[2:40:17] devil and the thing that you were
[2:40:19] running from now you chase it that
[2:40:25] that's where we go nice easy say he say
[2:40:27] he said if the devil say boo come on you
[2:40:34] you got to give the devil a boo back

[2:40:40] praise come on everybody say that

[2:53:02] because he told us a story
[2:53:05] a lot of people thought it was just a
[2:53:07] story but he was saying something
[2:53:09] without Saints told us a little story
[2:53:12] about a boy living in the country
[2:53:17] and you've never seen some things for
[2:53:18] people living in the city and one day
[2:53:20] his mama and his daddy decided to go
[2:53:22] visit a relative that was in the city
[2:53:25] when they went to the city a man the boy
[2:53:28] was in the house it was kind of looking
[2:53:30] around and seeing a lot of I've never
[2:53:32] seen him and as mama a team up stairs of
[2:53:34] course I want to go upstairs and see
[2:53:36] mommy and daddy and see auntie and uncle
[2:53:38] along with that and as the boy began to
[2:53:40] walk up the steps he got all the way to
[2:53:43] the top and he saw some committee never
[2:53:45] seen before and as he stood up there at
[2:53:48] the top of the stairs he he did like
[2:53:50] this when they did like that the
[2:53:53] thinking on the opposite side of him did
[2:53:56] the same thing then he did like this and
[2:54:00] the thing on the opposite side did the
[2:54:02] same thing and then he did like this and
[2:54:06] the thing on the opposite side did the
[2:54:08] same thing
[2:54:09] see when when one man says hey man the
[2:54:12] next man says and when the next man says
[2:54:15] and the next man says and you got double
[2:54:19] the power of a man
[2:54:24] [Applause]
[2:54:27] [Music]

[2:54:51] never live in the country I never seen
[2:54:55] nothing like this
[2:54:57] but mama that's me
[2:55:03] I believe the profit is it's probably
[2:55:06] smiling because he got some people on
[2:55:08] nerve that recognized as the word is
[2:55:11] preached that's me
[2:55:16] and when we get a revelation of who we
[2:55:18] are then we can work so we can say
