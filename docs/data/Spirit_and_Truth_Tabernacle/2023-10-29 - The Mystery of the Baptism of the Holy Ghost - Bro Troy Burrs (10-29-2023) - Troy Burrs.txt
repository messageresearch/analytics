attack of the enemy on their body father touch them oh Lord God as the word of God Goes Forth oh Father God Lord God May the very attributes of God father God go forth oh Father we come not in uh enticing words of man's Wisdom this morning but in demonstration and power of the Holy Ghost Lord Lord God it's not by might nor by power but by your spirit Lord God Lord God have your way in Jesus precious name the church say amen amen you may be seated amen amen that scripture that I I read was taken amen out of the book of Jeremiah amen and which I got the inspiration amen and the prophet amen spoke a message on this uh title there of broken sisters yes and I believe he was trying to get us to see something in that title in that message of broken sisters because we'll see there amen as we go on through this message how Jeremiah and the prophet of this day amen paralleled one another okay the things that Jeremiah was going through and the things amen that he was talking about had a very similar parallel to this day and time so I just want to read amen a passage amen from broken systems amen I think it was twice that he preached this one was in 1964 July 26 evening amen uh at the 31st chapter is where I'll start reading from amen and he says the reason I thought of this text was because that it runs parallel to what I was saying this morning of the hour that we're living and the cause that we are struggling for and we look at Israel as an example that God was uh he always has to remain the same and there is only one thing that God ever did amen ever did honor that was his way that he provided for his people amen and when they go out of that way then God was Dishonored and God made the people suffer for getting away from what he had told them to do no matter what it was he even give them a law touch not handle not taste not just not because of uh evil doing evil of doing it but the evil of disobeying what he said to do right right and there's all there's always cannot be a law without punishment for the law because if there was no punishment then law not much to the uh to it unless it's it's a penalty to that law now we find that that we find what they did in that day seems to parallel what we are doing today what the church people are doing so we see a strange thing here it might be strange to some people when he said uh you have they have humed themselves systems broken sistern now maybe some of you don't know what a sister is how many knows what a sister is well most all of you if you was Ever Raised on a farm you know what a sistern is I remember I've drank enough bugs from one to know what a sister is he say preached out in the country where in the brush Arbor there you have a big picture full of sistern water sitting there the rain you know and it kind of got a little low uh and the and then the bug at night would get into it and so I know what a sister what sistern water is a sister is a place a thing that's dug out of the ground to take the place of a whale where people don't doesn't have to uh have a whale they get a sister in other words a sister is a manmade tank or a man made well in the ground that made that men dig out to catch water to use it some of them use it for wash water some of them use it for drinking water and different and different way maybe all water sometime we use to get from a sister used to have an old thing you had uh to when around and around and around to get the water up excuse me had little buckets uh to pump the water out of the system well notice about the system that's different from a whale now a whale now I'm sorry now a system gets empty and the sister Cann feel itself amen it's not reliable you can't rely upon a sister it has to rely upon it has to rely and depend upon the rain that fall in the summer or in the winter whatever it is usually in the winter time when the snow and rain comes and it runs uh the water off into the sstn and if it doesn't get the water then it don't have any water if it all dries up and it can't refill itself the old system cannot reveal itself the rains that fall amen and uh we're going to go on I don't want to just continue reading but there's a lot to that maybe I'll come back to it I want to uh speak on a message this morning I want you to look at John the 16th chapter and the 12th and the 13th verse this John the 16th chapter 12th and the 13th verse beginning at the 12th verse it reads I have yet many things to say to you but ye cannot bear them now how be it when the spirit of Truth is come he will lead you uh he will guide you into all truth amen for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now when that passage of scripture there we see here that he says I yet have many things to say to you but you can't bear enough see God knows exactly the season of your life to reveal his truth to you right right sir he knows exactly the season of your life right to reveal his truth to you amen he knows exactly the season of your life amen that he may reveal the truth to someone else amen God is always in control he amen and it says here how be it when the spirit of Truth is come amen this is speaking of a future coming how be it when and this is John here speaking when the spirit of Truth come he will lead you and guide you in the all truth a future coming of Truth they had a portion of Truth for their day amen but there was a greater truth coming and the spirit of Truth he will lead he will guide you yeah right into truth I went over into the to the message that the prophet preached on the guide amen and the prophet was talking about here how amen when you go out amen into the forest he's a Avid Hunter and he said especially in some of those Canadian Forest where there very thick brush you don't have a chance out there without a guide I think he said that there's about a 3% chance of survival because what'll happen is you'll get out there and you'll you you go through the trees and you go different ways and all of a sudden the snow will come and you have no idea you look around everything looks the same which way did I come from and which way do I go he was talking about a story of a camp a a a group of campers uh a boy scouts that went out without a God and they got lost they had the national God the forest rangers volunteers helicopters and they never could find those boys and all of them perished because they didn't have a guide to lead them to show them God's provided way amen and we see the parallels to this day and time amen I want to say my brothers and sisters this morning that you need the God I'm not the God we see here talking about the Prophet Jeremiah the prophet Jeremiah Was was was was a prophet sent there to Israel amen that that mimic Moses and his and and and out the prophet of this day he he he he didn't think he was good enough amen he said uh to to do what the Lord asked him to do he said I'll give you what to say it touched his mouth I don't want to read it all but it's right there in Jeremiah 2 Jeremiah 1 and two so he was the the Israel had lost their way amen they they had started H uh uh going and beginning to do things God bless you my brother amen I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that Lord have mercy God bless you amen but they was going and they had gotten off the path they had gotten off the path God they had begin to take on some of the the habits and they had begin to take on some of the ways amen of of the people around them but God had gave them a specific way God's provided way it says in there that they begin to worship Idol gods they had begin to take on the Customs amen and of the people around them they had begin to develop the cult culture of the people around them right they had begin to develop and take on some of the religious spirits of the masses that was around them amen so we move on here we see we need a God Jeremiah was not the guy he was kind a prophet that God had sent in that day amen to show them the way but they still needed a guide to lead them to the word of the hour he said here just how be it when the spirit of Truth is come he will lead you and guide you into all truth he will lead you to the message of the hour because you can't other than that you will go lost because all the paths look the same it's a tree here a tree there a tree there and without a guide you don't know which way to go this one looks right this way looks right and you begin to just look at these things and you make an assumption I guess I'll just go this way why because my Grandmama and my great Grandmama yeah and my uncle they all did this so I guess I'll go this way too right amen not understanding that the gospel as it Journeys it has Junctions where the gospel has a junction where you have to make a turn and it's important that you make the right turn at the junction amen amen yes or you will get further and further off the beaten path and when you get off the path now you have to make your way back to the junction and start over and go the right way are you with me amen a future coming in your life is that we will that he will guide you in the true understanding of the revealed word of your day this has been the test testimony of every elect believer down through seven Church ages they all saw their day in its message for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak and he will show you things to come that mean he needed to have the vision of prophetic Insight you needed to have a prophetic Ministry and we know that we are living in that age now to show you things to come a prophet is a Seer amen he can look afar amen and show you what's coming he can look back and tell you what's been so if you know what's coming and you know what's been now you can figure out pretty good where you at amen you'll know whether you in the middle at the beginning oh my or at the end and we've had a prophet in this hour that has showed us things to come showed us where we come from and by all of those things we can gather that we're right at the end time many people are wondering uh many can see that something's happening they can sense a change they can see that the world is becoming more evil that those things you can plainly see that but without prophetic Insight you have no way to understand how to navigate Amen in this hour Lord You're Still depending on cultural insight you're still depending on the word of an age going by but it won't suffice in this time it won't be enough to carry you through I want you to look at something with me Revelation the fourth chapter he said the fourth chapter the first verse after this I looked after what D your brother after after re Revelation three the church ages he said I looked and what did he see he said and behold a door was open in the heavens an Open Door my brothers and sisters gives you access to enter into somewhere different you had to open a door Amen to enter into the sanctuary this morning and door gives you access into somewhere different and John said now behold and I looked and I seen a behold the door was open in heaven amen and the first and he had here a open door access somewhere different and the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet talking with me saying come up hither and I will show you things to come now isn't that what he said that he will do amen but John I'll show you things to come showing you that down up under after the church ages lady Yia I don't want to get ahead of myself we had seven Church ages but let me say my brothers and sisters we are not in Lady of seal right we have been lifted up into what's called a bride age amen amen we are called out of Lady o said come out of her my people amen because see we are need a prophetic Insight lady Y is blind naked wretched miserable and don't know it what is it they are they they they they they don't have to guide yes sir they lost in the wilderness and don't know which way to go but the prophet of this hour say Amen Revelation 4:1 say come up hither and I'll show you things to come so you'll know which way to go that's where we're at this morning my brothers and sisters amen bear with me this Open Door was the opening of the word that came by the voice of the seventh angel and this door was open that stood between lady OA and the bride age and so when this door was opened by the revealing of the word in this day it gave us an entrance from Lady oia Church age into to a bride dispensation Revelation 10:7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet amen so now we want to look at because there are Mysteries amen that had to be amen revealed we see there in Revelation 41 the open door in heaven amen what was this this was a time amen a place at a junction amen between the Pentecostal age of Lady yosia and the bride age dispensation of the time as Believers of the message are now living in so since we since the opening of The Seven Seals in 1963 it is important that we recognize the Junctions within the message amen amen and the doctrinal changes that took place from the Pentecostal age of age teaching to the bride age teachings right amen amen and so it's very important for us to understand that brother bam started out as a young Minister are you with me M he didn't know everything from the beginning right right he had his ministry with many things in his understanding that needed to be revealed right amen still a prophet now right don't misunderstand me so out by the real truth of the word and so there were Junctions along the way in the message the real true light of the revelation of this hour was revealed and proclaimed clear to him and that is also this our experience every last one of us in here Amen in your life in your natural life you're going to come to Junctions in your life amen where you have to make a I'm talking natural from a child to a adolescent from an adolescent to a teenage or a pre-teen right from a pre-teen to a teen from a here's the here's one here's the here's the here's the trickiest one from a teen to an adult that's where most people get lost amen it's a junction amen amen and in the junction what do you need you need a guide amen amen or you can't you can't navigate your way through the junction at every Junction of your natural life when you're embarking on a marriage you it's a junction it is something that must be prayed dearly about earnestly about why because you're at a junction and you can go the wrong way or you can go the right way it's a time of decision amen and you don't want to go out assuming right because your heart is telling you one thing right oh my and that's a heavy pull amen oh she's everything that I wanted he's everything that I dreamed of but what does God say if you make the wrong turn right here it could ruin your life amen and in this room you may never come back you going to have to live with that thing amen amen so it's it's it behooves you to pause sometime in life you got to just stand still for a little bit wait a minute I got to go talk to Jesus and I ain't talking about no five minute prayer wait wait on him we sing the song wait on him he's an old time God cuz we want to make the right decision amen at the junction yes amen amen we we we we we we we decide on a career on a job that's a junction that's right we find sometime that if we make the wrong decision it takes us out of out of God's will sometime we we the job I can't get to church now right now we follow it all the way the decisions especially married people with children the decisions that you make is not only going to affect you I don't care what happened you could have been so hurt well I did I did this because of the pain in my life I get it because I was hurt I went through a traumatic event stand still because the decision that you make now is not only going to affect you but it's going to affect your children your children's children your children's children's children it's not just about over what some temporary upset feeling you got to think more long term than that amen CZ we're upset impulsive decisions we got to be more I'm going get into that we're no longer see we've come up to the the dispensation of the Bride we're no longer Pentecostal babies when I was a child I speak as a child I act as a child but when I became a man I put away child childish things and I carried myself like an adult grown man grown woman and they're not impulsive but prayerful amen All Right Moves cautiously scripture says that it moves HH what's the word I'm looking for like a cat walking over the walls of nails and glass very Surf footedly not for sure his next step not to go the wrong way right right amen I said one time long I'm too old to make any more mistakes cuz it take too long to come back I can't afford to make no more mistakes amen amen amen but we look at this this this the picture within the message within within our walk with Christ through the scripture there were Junctions if there was Junctions in our life there was Junctions in the prophet's life amen there was the Within message there are Junctions within the message amen and you have to be able to follow the prophet amen or you will miss the junction that's why he say say what the tap say or you miss the junction shame to say some of Mr Junction and so it's very important for us to understand when brother brandham started out as a young Minister am mean he had some things that had to be revealed amen and so because this when people come into the message from a Pentecostal background they will naturally bring their Pentecostal understanding over with them and so they will also need the Lord to straighten out their understanding over a period of time by the truth of the hour as they walk along in the light of the message see there may be some here that don't quite understand everything now but just just keep on allow God Amen to give you the revelation of what what's going on Amen but when they start out in the message they are looking at the message mostly through their Pentecostal background religious world view and so that is why they they are able to find quotes in the message that will seemingly allow them to preach amen yes a Pentecostal teaching of the Holy Spirit baptism amen because they are bringing over their understanding from a bygone age of Lady OA yet the prophet tells us in many places in the message that we have to die out to that understanding in order to come into a bride age are you with me amen now he said in the anointed ones at the end time amen the life keeps advancing on but remember it's in another stage it can't remain in that stage we can't eat the carryon of some other age we can't eat Pentecostal carry on Methodist carry on Baptist carry on we see it becomes a carry on we have fresh food of this hour yeah the real fact is that in the message of the hour you can find quotes that it support almost almost any false teaching just as you can in the Bible over time with all different denominations and we have seen a lot of it through the years but the true bride will not be deceived because she will be guided by the Holy Spirit of the inner teacher that will lead her through all the mind feels of the false amen this is why that scripture is so important when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth so we have come to realize that brother brandham didn't start out knowing everything at the beginning and the lack of understanding is what he caused many to become confused over the years certain teaching of the message because when we read the message it is important for us to understand that the revelation of the hour first a journey of progressive revelation to the prophet himself as the Lord would reveal certain truths to him along through the season and the experiences of his life we all know that he was born a prophet but the revelation of the word in this hour had to be revealed to him progressively by God and so as we came so as the word came to him then he corrected the errors of the doctrine many have had because of his own human understanding and this is God's pattern for all of us in our experiences of Life as we walk through this hour listen at what he said in the message the unveiling of God Amen preached in 1964 he said watch them takes as they come down watch each one how it comes more pler and pler right amen amen so there's a certain Pentecostal doctrines that were corrected as the message Advanced by the opening of the Mysteries being revealed in the in in this day but when a person would come out of a Pentecostal church amen background and into the message then they would still be able to find hundreds of quotes of the message that would allow them to preach a Pentecostal Doctrine concept of baptism of the Holy Ghost as a message Doctrine yet the prophet clearly tells us we are not to bring doctrine of the Pentecostals over age over into the new land of the Bride age amen now listen invisible Union the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented again that represented now look the isua street represented the first Pentecostal Age Again again amen and we see in this time amen that we have developed or or or some have developed and going off of I'll call it instead of saying Pentecostal I'll say our culture I'll say it that way because as most of us that have grown up in church and around religious system it has become our culture and what we do we try to come in and mix our culture into the message that's true and it causes confusion right amen amen that's true this is what Jeremiah Was facing they had got off the off the road because they was bringing their culture things from a pag on time across into the message amen he says here we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you are dead to that you cannot have that brother brandham tells us that this mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen would be one of the Mysteries that would be revealed in this age amen that some of the Mysteries I'm sorry the end time sign he said here that's some of the Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to wind up all the Mysteries all the mysteries of God let me give you that sis I'm sorry uh is this the sign of the in sir Jeffersonville 621 12:30 evening I want you to read this amen he says here that some of the Mysteries that the angel is supposed to wind up all the Mysteries all the mysteries of God and the other one may I say this with all reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God the serpent seed that's been hid a hidden Mystery All Through The Years amen the grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace no such thing as a Eternal burning hell you burned for a million years but but anything that had a beginning has to have an end and hell was created notice how the seventh angel Prophet was sent to straighten out all of these crooked areas of man's false interpretation of the word and now listen to the next mystery that he tells us we'll be straightened out in this last Age The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did amen it is a mystery amen of the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the way that's the title of my message the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now we look here what did Christ do he fulfill scripture that were written of him for that hour you follow me there he was the work that he accomplished and so as the end time bride of this hour this is what we are also called to accomplish in this day as his body on Earth for this hour we are to fulfill every scripture that has been prophesied at the end time bride of Christ we are to fulfill the prophecy of Rebecca at the evening time well who meets Ela and follows this man all the way to her unseen bridegroom amen this is one of the stories that Christ has been writing in your life because he is the Isaac part and so there must come a Rebecca part to be fulfilled also amen we are also to fulfill the end time prophecy of Abraham and Sarah meeting the Lord himself in human flesh again revealing the secrets of the heart we are to fulfill the type of Abigail who was married to a rich but arrogant husband amen type of Lady of see age condition but then she came into a new age marriage to King David a type of Christ amen we are also to fill the type of Esther coming into a marriage Union after vashy a type of Pentecostal church was put away for refusing to come into the presence of the king she refused to O the oh she refused to obey the word for her day amen but a bride amen must fulfill those things we are also to fulfill the type of Ruth at the Harvest Time who came into a union with Boaz the lord of the Harvest and Rahab at the time of judgment amen when the talk was displayed in Mary Salomon we are in this day amen called Amen to fulfill those scriptures those scriptures are for you and I Amen to fulfill in this house all these scriptures must be lived out by the elect time end time people and so this is the work that Christ is performing in the lives of the elect bride of this day these are the supernatural stories of Prophecy in this day that Christ has been writing unto the story of your life amen you may not realize it amen but your life is telling a story your life is fulfilling a prophecy amen amen amen so if you only have a Pentecostal denomination interpretation of what it is to do Jesus is trying to copy you're trying to copy some historical event amen and bring it over into a this a bride age and it won't work the message of the hour it won't be before you will be encouraging the people hear me now you you will end up encouraging the people to look back yeah to a first and second P experience right of a platform performance of a outward Supernatural attraction and then all you would do is bring confusion into the message and attract the attention of the people of what the first and second pool did Brother Brandon's mystery but we know that the first and second pool Ministry amen performance draw big crowds has now passed because we are now living in the bride age of the third pool of the prophet's Ministry and where the spirit of Christ is now dealing privately with a bride under a supernatural administration of a revealing of himself by the opening of the word which then there is no public show it is between the bride and his and the bridegroom it's not to the public he is revealing himself to his bride so we we look at the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't want want to confuse amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost with baptismal anointing amen because see when the when the when when it when Jose I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and the prophet said it is the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost stay with me now it is the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost in the message or not ones at the end time brother brandham tells us that the rain represents the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on both the just and the unjust the wheat and the CLE and so this was the teaching that was a great shock to the Pentecostal world of which the prophet was mostly preaching to at that time because it seemed so contrary to what the Pentecostal church had always been taught and believed that such a major point of this baptism of the Holy go Holy Spirit and now they are are being told that it will fall on both Sinner and Saint alike and so this was such a great contrast to their to their Pentecostal understanding amen and being the third work of Grace and so in 1965 there was a junction of the truth that was being sent by God to correct this Pentecostal error and understanding and so all so all of a sudden brother Brandon seemed to change the concept and what we always thought was The Ultimate Security of a person receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost then they sealed them into a day of their red that they were sealed into the day of their Redemption but then from around July 1965 brother brandham began to make statements about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that seem to almost completely opposite of what they were taught broken systs amen broken ssts 64726 AR 100 the prophet said notice we find today that people there are many people believe in spirit fill spirit filled people I'm slow that down notice we find today that there are many just can't believe it even spirit filled people notice what he's saying here that even Spirit-filled people can't believe the true word of the yah I'm going to give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul now let me help you explain that so you don't get confused notice this Junction of Truth the word here is now that brother bram's own understanding has begun to see with a crystal clear understanding that there is a difference between the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the spirit realm the person amen the Holy Ghost of the revelation of the word of the day in the person's soul there is a difference there is a you have to go past amen uh feeling Goosebumps it has to go further amen than just uh uh an experience see because we want to understand that it is a process amen it is a process he said here in leadership the outward expression shows on the inside the CER the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside see the CER many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I am going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so amen so I want you to understand that what had happened what was happening that you they at at one point in time they would feel a little something amen the presence of God amen would come into a room or or or and people would feel the presence of the Lord and feel that that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now I'm not it it is the it is but it has to go further than that it has to go deeper than that you can't stop there amen because see like in Revelation 4 say that there was an Open Door amen and John 16 says that when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen so it has to be a revelation of the word of your hour that identifies the Holy Ghost amen amen many people can come and jump and Shout amen and and and clap and and and when the music starts and walk out and live like Devils but you know what they felt the real presence of the Holy Ghost it came and it washed them and they felt clean and they went home and had a real good time oh didn't we have a good time in church but that's as far as it went amen it has to go further than that my brothers and sisters it has to you have to allow the Holy Ghost amen the tutor amen amen to T to you unto a full baptism of the Holy Ghost not just an out pouring or the anointing of the Holy Ghost something that's going to stabilize you yes amen take me to Jeremiah amen Jeremiah the 18 chapter remember we're parallel paralleling this time with Jeremiah so Jeremiah the prophet amen the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House for I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and beheld he wrought a work on the wheel and the vessel that he made of clay was m in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make then the word came word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot I do with you as the poter this is the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel at what instant I will speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom and pluck up to pull down and Destroy now let me stop right there so we come Amen to The Potter's House amen it's not enough Amen to just come to The Potter's House amen you have to to be willing to get on the wheel amen he take you up in his hand the Bible said the world the Earth was with without void without form amen and when he picked you up amen clay you had all of the materials in you Amen to make a Son of God but what happened it was mixed up amen with carry-ons and ideas and and inuendos from a bygone age amen we had involved ourselves in all kind of debauchery amen of the devil and Confused us amen that had us mixed up Amen in the clay all of these additives was in the clay amen and it was only by the hand of the poter amen that can remove these things from the clay so what happened the poter had to sit down amen the Potter sat down at the wheel amen and he got the clay which is you in his hand amen and he put you on the wheel but he don't let go he still got you in his hand amen and he take down and he grab a handful of water amen and he put over that clay what was that doing making the clay pliable amen you have to have have amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost to make you pliable amen now you couldn't even get along with yourself your heart was hard amen and you were stiffened up stiff neck wouldn't believe nothing sitting up in church with your lips poked out can't get along with nobody let alone the spirit of God so he had to give you the anointing of the water not from a broken syst but from a wh that shall never run dry amen and that anointing that you fell was from the blood the the well amen amen of God and it Mo and you felt something and you said oh God this is different oh God I enjoy it and you wanted to shout and you cry but wait a minute the parted not finished not right so he put you on the will and your life begin to spin spin and he got you in his hand and he's feeling for you what is he feeling for oh this is not right this is not right because it had to be clay it had to be 100% pure clay or what was going to happen he'll put you in the in the kettle he'll put you in the Heat and you crack you won't be able to stand the pressure if there's anything but clay amen so he got you on the Wheel amen and the wheel is spinning you don't know what's going on you say what's going on in my life amen but he got you in his hand amen you don't know whether to go this way you don't want to go that way but God has got you in his hand why is this happening to me why is that happen to me he's called The Tender hand of Jehovah mooving you into his Direction amen amen amen so he take that clay it's on the wheel he begin to work with that clay he begin to work with that clay am man and he feel a little something else oh you got a little bit of malice in you yeah we can't go

well why the preacher keep picking it on me he's not picking on you he's picking off you amen cuz you must be original material Amen in the hands of God and he can feel see he done this before amen back in Genesis he knows what it feels like he knows what the pure clay feels like when he formed amen the first man amen and he formed him and he was perfect so he knows exactly what it's supposed to be like so he got him on and he got in hand amen he might feel a little uh H uh Envy amen he break it down amen he F might feel a little pride not ready yet I got to get that out before I can make the vessel amen but all along it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost the anointing of the Holy Ghost he keep putting water on it why cuz he can't allow you become stiff amen so he keeps blessing you amen you feel the anointing of his presence oh Lord I Thank You Lord but he's not through with you yet amen he's not done with you yet amen see that's what happened in a back on age they stopped right there amen tell the Holy Ghost is I got it amen and went on with the gifts amen cuz it was a restoration of the gifts not understanding that is going to lead you amen into something greater you have to be able to recognize the turn at the junction amen and all of a sudden you're at a junction you went from the marry clay where he pulled you out he put you on the wheel you're at a junction amen can you make the right decision at the junction you spin it on the wheel he begin to form and and he begin to mold you and he begin to make me Lord God I am yours Lord God have your way with me Lord God I Surrender amen sometime you get a little Hard Hearted amen you get a little a something in you amen he has to start all over again break it down amen because you must be a masterpiece amen you must be
