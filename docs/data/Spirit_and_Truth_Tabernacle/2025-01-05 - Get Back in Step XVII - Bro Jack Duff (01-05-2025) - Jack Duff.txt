into the presence of the Lord and um um man I've been waiting on sister Melissa for a long time long time my patience my patience but I tell you it's worth the waight that's right while I was in the Philippines I I I saw brother Jerry come up here and sing like why why this happen when I leave but uh but it was good and and and sister Naomi that's a restoration y'all when y'all see Naomi singing It's a restoration un appreciate you sis amen we thank God for you um but we we appreciate my daughter too amen man thank God thank God for her amen amen musicians I'm going to say God bless you appreciate y'all so much amen where would we be if we didn't have y'all amen we thank God for you we thank God for you let me um just have you get your Bibles um and I'll I'll quickly read our scripture and uh saw brother Mark back there so good to have him in the house of the Lord the Lord brought him through a surgery and um God is God is good amen um our our scriptures Joel 1 and Joel 2 um let me read it real quick I'll let you be seated then I'll I just just couple things I'll share um but joel4 said that which the Palmer worm had left have the Locust eaten and that which the Locust had left uh ha the cankerworm eaten that which the korm have left hath the caterpillar eaten and then we skip over here to chapter 2 uh because we know that that's not the end of the story and joel4 the end of the story is found in Chapter 2 and uh and and and I'm going just start reading at verse 21 I'm just reading these promises over you and I'm going to keep it before you because amen God ain't finished yet am amen and God ain't finished yet uh fear not oh L be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things can I just inject something here real quick you know we preached on Friday I'm sorry Tuesday night and the lord gave us uh a a topic of year of the Overflow the year of overflow and and I got got that because of this scripture that we're reading uh here and um we'll get to verse 24 in a second but um because spiritually we're overflowing into the same theme that we had last year then I knew that natural types are spiritual and so we know spiritually things are going to overflow but also in the natural we're expecting an overflow in in your life and uh on the very first day of the year I got an email um January 1st um uh the email was given to me but somehow I think the the decision was made on December 31st but I didn't get the news until January 1st it's just an overflow and uh but the news was the email says your student loan has been [Applause] forgiven Hallelujah has a way of vindicating what he is saying to the church sir and uh and if it start with me if if my debt was cancelled now you had to be here on Tuesday night because I talked about a lady that was in debt y'all remember the sermon sir and they went and bought got her some vessels and she filled the vessels up with oil and then the prophet told her now go sell the vessels and pay your debt and you and your sons live off the rest the prophet elishah spoke overflow in that lady's life so my debt was cancelled Hallelujah on the very first day of the year I'm here to tell you your debts will be cancelled Hallelujah and you going to live in the Overflow oh my thank you lordes thank you Hallelujah amen it's it's yours if you want it amen but I I just catch little things that God does amen I I don't think it by happen stance I I think these things are ordained of God oh yes Hallelujah am amen and and and even for those that were not able to make it on Tuesday night you can still have it the Declaration that God put over this church is year of the Overflow hallelujah amen long as you part of the spirit and Truth Tabernacle walk in it and I know some people that's not even a part of spirit and Truth Tabernacle and they still claiming it for themselves so we thank God for all things let's let's let's let's uh keep reading here uh verse 22 Be not Afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength strength be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month every time I read that I I I just something something about January January it's something about January and I and and I know if you look at it from the Hebrew calendar it wouldn't be January it be something else but still uh we have to look at it from both calendars amen and so to me it's something about January I always have an expectation in January amen the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palm worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that don't wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed let's pray amen father we thank you for um this this opportunity oh God to approach the word of the Lord and God a journey that you have uh carried us on uh throughout the previous year and and you have ordained um and and not just I think the ordination comes even through the scripture because you you prophesied through Joel that there would be an overflow and God we have entered that we see spiritually uh that we could not finish the thought last year and it had to overflow into this year so with that that now we can lay claims on other areas of our life that will experience overflow thank you for the spiritual overflow thank you for the natural overflow thank you for the financial overflow thank you for uh touching our bodies God thank you for healing overflow uh Deliverance overflow God every place that The Souls of our feet tread overflow in our businesses overflow praise God in our Ames overflow amen we have sowed in tears but now it's time for us to reap in Joy amen so father we claim in this as you have given it to us and and we receive it father with Thanksgiving Amen on the tip of our tongues and and Lord just believing that you will do everything hallelujah we're not limiting you to no one or two things we believe you're going to do everything so father we receive it father and just pray that you bless amen our time as we go into the word take control of every thought that was that is presented and every thought that is received it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated praise the Lord so um our journey continues on get back and step um and the inspiration of our restore sayith the Lord just a a few things amen before we go further um um as I mentioned last year uh the theme was get back in step and um with us carrying that theme over to this year uh Joel told us there in Joel 2:24 um that there the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil uh so just by reading that scripture and that that was our theme we I I didn't know but God knew that even that portion had to actually be fulfilled with us carrying the theme over into this year which which to me is a clear example that this is our scripture and this scriptures being fulfilled in our time we are the people that are living this scripture we are the people and and that and that that overflow happen spiritually because you know as we mentioned on uh Tuesday night the oil and wine is something that is is is spiritual brother Brandon uh tells us that the the oil represented the Holy Spirit the wine represents the stimulation of Revelation and even you know on Tuesday night I was watching even even some of my young people saying amen they was receiving stimulation from Revelation amen and and and it's something when you see the young people get on fire in the church it start changing things for everybody else Hallelujah so so I pray that God would continue to overflow in the lives of the young people amen and and don't let the devil take y'all amen young people amen God reveal himself to you speak back to him as he speaks to you amen amen actually means so be it right so when when when when it's declared over me that this is the year of overflow I ain't going to sit there and just knot my head when I say Amen that means so be it to me I agree with that I accept that I want that Hallelujah right so so that's why I'm not afraid to say amen hallelujah right but but but this this uh brother brandham told us that the wine is stimulation of Revelation and then the oil represents the Holy Spirit and and and we had a little situation there at the house uh on yesterday me and my wife was just doing some some handy handy things there and uh we were trying to get this little uh uh uh holder off the off of our front door on the glass of the front door and we would just it was just stuck there just just couldn't get that thing off and one of them I got off but in getting it off I broke it where it can't be used anymore uh so you know she she said well let me let me let me go in and and just get something see if we can get this off and um and she went and got some oil and she just poured it over this little area and as the oil was seeping down it loosened this thing so that we can get it off you know of the window and she say you say see when the oil come in nothing can stick to it and she said what does the or represent I said all right now she preaching to me I said the or represent the spirit then when the spirit come in nothing can stick to it Lord and and and I felt that was very appropriate amen for this morning when the Holy Spirit comes into the life of his people then sin cannot stick to them nothing can stick to you when the Holy Spirit comes in if you still struggling in certain areas Hallelujah you you might have carried some things from last year into this year but when when the Overflow of wine and oil comes don't you worry cuz nothing will stick to it Hallelujah hey this is going to cinch you from the inside out Hall my God I'm I'm under expectation amen a mighty mighty expectation I wanted to you know one of the other things that was brought out uh brother Simba mention because we we were talking about some of the things that restored last year we had uh communion restored we had Sunday school restored right Health was restored right I mean Finance is restored there was a lot of things that happened last year and we're looking for them testimonies to carry on over into this year he says but he says we didn't even realize it but but just by us having a New Year's Eve service that actually was restored yes sir we hadn't had one of them in over three years so with us coming just for that night that was another proof that restoration had occurred in this church Hallelujah restoration was all around us sometimes we didn't even recognize what God was doing but but I thank God that God got spiritual people here catching all these things that the Lord is doing in our midst thank God for this this this this this thing amen thank God for what he's given us amen and and I wanted to just kind of circle back here at the beginning of the sermon um when we talk about get back in Step let's not forget where this comes from amen let's let's go back and just look at a couple things out of the message proving his word uh this is what we started off with last year this is where the inspiration came from and uh and it's just like I said it's carrying over into this year so let's just start the year with with where the the get back and step comes from here out of the message proving his word it says he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way amen he says see what did he do in the days of Noah when he's fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he sent Noah a sign and and now notice when he comes to deliver the children of Israel what does he do his same way he sends his Prophet now this is this is what this is what the uh uh um this is what what what what what what we're told now uh when he sends his prophit there is another side of this equation if I can put it that way it's not it's not the fact whether he send his Prophet or not amen the the issue becomes whether you can receive it oh it's not about what God has done amen because cuz when when when when when when when when the Disciples of John the Baptist want to know are you he or should we look for another right they they I mean they was they they was asking the question to the Lord Jesus and and he say you know the the the tell John that the the blind receive their sight the the dumb talk you know the death hear and and all these Miracles that's tell tell them everything that that's been going on in the ministry my God tell them all the testimonies that have been happening and uh and and John being in uh in prison had his prophetic eye filmed over glory to God so just begin to share these testimonies the testimonies will bring encouragement to John Hallelujah and then then Jesus goes on to say now now you know that that that one that's supposed to be coming before me this is John if you can receive it all right Hallelujah if the Lord Jesus himself was on Earth today and he was to come and tell you yeah the ministry of William brandom is the one that I sent but it's not whether I sin or not I did my part the question is will you receive what I s that's it brother that's where the issue is can people receive it all right here we go here we go here we go glory to God Amen he says um uh uh uh he's fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them no other prophet he sent Noah sign and now notice when he comes to deliver the children of Israel what does he do his same way he sends his Prophet His prophets got the word the signs and wonders of the promised word uh uh of the word promise backs uh back it up that's that's it's exactly the truth Israel made a March to the promised land because they believed it Israel made their March to the promised land because they believed it yes sir they believe what they belied God had sent them a prophet they were willing to obey what the prophet was saying to them everything Moses gave them they followed the instructions of it they stayed in step with what Moses was saying Hallelujah if you got out of Step especially a father that had a boy on the night that the U the the death angel was passing through the that firstborn song son if that boy would if that blood was not applied that boy's life would be impacted they had to stay in step with what the prophet was saying that's right amen glory to God and he says this he says um Israel made her March to the promis land because they believed him look at this it goes on and says and in the Wilderness Journey it came to pass that they disbelieve this Prophet now now now I need you to understand where did this happen this not happen while the prophet was on the earth oh Lord have mercy there was no no problems believing it while the prophet was on the earth it was only after the prophet went off to sing when the prophet went off the scene this is where problems start coming in this is where people got out of step Hallelujah if I can just put it very plain this is where people got out of Step but however there is a promise that over the people that got out of Step that somehow they would get themselves back in step and what is the promise that causes these people to get back in step we read it I will restore saith the Lord that is the promise that is looming over those people now somebody got to get out the step in order for us to get back somebody got to get out of step in order for us to get back in Step but God know exactly what he doing don't don't you be alarmed by nothing that's happening you just keep showing love to everybody yes sir look at this in the wilderness Journey it came the past that they disbelieve this Prophet after seeing the word being so confirmed the the uh the bridge go out uh the bride I'm sorry the bride got out of Step you know what I'm speaking about in The Vision SE got out of Step there was one stayed up by the name of Joshua and Caleb and believed the Word of Promise true regardless of what the circumstances was oh that just means so much to me I we are living amongst Caleb's and Joshua and I know it's hot in here I'm hot y'all just bear with me y'all keep y'all fans going and what we'll do we'll make sure we keep those other fans around just in case this happened to us again one day we I I said we ain't going to have to worry about it but even we get our own building you know the uh air conditioning sometimes give you problems but it's okay we'll make it through amen y'all y'all just stay with me amen stay with no no now I want I want to just say this in our midst we got Caleb and Joshua now I'm not just talking about because of your age right no no no I'm talking about because of your experience sir Hallelujah I'm talking about people that's been able to lock into the word regardless of their circumstances people that's been able to stay with the word regardless of their circumstance look look look look look look I mean this may happen that may happen but I ain't letting go this word oh my God as as as a Believer you got to have that type of resolve I don't care what happens amen I'm not going to lose my testimony I'm not not going to lose amen my my contact with God because I realize what he's done for me if you really been delivered I'm talking about you know only God can deliver you ain't nothing nobody can do can take your testimony from you hallelujah oh I know what I'm talking about I mean I mean and many of us had some really trying circumstances I I heard some of the testimonies on on on Tuesday night but those trying circum circum that did not stop people from pressing their way into the presence of God prise Lord my my testimony that I was still holding on oh my God they asked that question you yet holding on I I ask you this morning are you yet holding on well if you're yet holding on keep on keeping [Applause] on oh my here I'm skipping in this in this sermon down to uh the the next quote in this uh I forget which paragraph number it is but I I want to skip down because brother brandom talked about how he saw the BR getting out of step and said you know what I'm speaking of it was a vision that God gave him of the uh he had he saw the alpha bride then he saw the church and then he saw the Omega bride and it says when he saw the alpha bride they were marching to the beat of the Gospel but then then when he saw the church is it it it discouraged him so much he says Lord how with all the preaching that we did how could this be the only thing that we could produce I mean look at the way this church is acting look at the dancing and and and everything that's going on and I'm talking about vulgar Dancing Yeah amen there there is a holy dance that we can do amen but he's talk the vulgar dancing that's going on in church the music that they were listening to in the church he he says Lord how could all this preaching seven times around the world and that's all we could produce and then the Lord told him said no just just just just watch you know the bride is coming back in preview again and here comes the Omega bride walking and as he as they're walking they're walking past the prophet amen he was sitting there in the in in the grand stand and as they're walking past the prophet he uh he saw a couple of them in the back Hallelujah and we kind of in the back because this is the end of the age we're the end of the end so the ones that were in the back begin to get out of Step Hallelujah amen and as they were getting out of Step the prophet almost screamed out and said get back and step but before he could scream out they got back in step on their own and the reason they could get back in step is because there's a promise over them that I will restore sayth the Lord God going to restore your step so here in the prayer in this same sermon proving his word in his prayer he he says we think of this Solomon and that great Millennium of the Jews that when no Nations dared to touch them and that great gift of God was in the prophet till he made known to the queen all of her secrets of her heart nothing was with hell the great age showing and typing that there was a great age coming and now father that was you not Solomon that was you in Jesus where he said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was beginning of the creation his body was the redeemed creation and now Through the Ages the church lost its first love uh lost his first love and now in the last days you promise to call a little minority amen the little flock at the last days father our hearts are jumping and my heart's pounding when I think of that and know uh and know that your words are true none of them can fail let these people today understand that and let the sinner seek you at this hour before the gates close and there will be no more time let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step from this and that may she come back into step as the vision showed a few weeks ago now I I love that prayer and and I want to just mention you know he said as the bride gets out of Step from this and that amen now now now uh we've had we've had a lot happen we've had some that got out of Step because you know they they thought they saw something in the word that uh they was completely misunderstanding right and and anytime you know as a people talk about you know we uh the the scripture that a lot of people stood on or trying to stand on is that if if the Lord reveals something to a prophet and the prophet speaks it and it doesn't come to pass then the Bible say don't hear that Prophet so so so many people heard that brother brandom talked about you know uh uh uh a bear that he was supposed to get and that he didn't get the bear he said thus said the Lord he was going to get the bear but he didn't get the bear but he also explained why he didn't get the bear because he was disobedient now it was thus sayth the Lord but he was disobedient that's why he didn't get to Bear but in their in their mind they think well he spoke thus sayi the Lord it didn't come to pass so you know he's not a prophet and that's all they got they not looking at the thousands of other things that he spoke in the name of the Lord that came to pass they looking at one thing and say he spoke it it didn't come to pass right and and and and here you know I've always challenged people with that I said because Moses was the one that's supposed to take the people into the promised land did he do it he didn't do it he didn't do it and the reason he do it he didn't do it because of something that he did he exalted himself above the word of God so God took him off you know God let him come off the SE say so but that does not not that that does not take away the fact that Moses was the deliverer so whether brother brand got to bear or not don't take away the fact that God used him as his Prophet Hallelujah to the Lamb of God Amen and I just I have to keep saying this over and over again uh when you're trying to search this message to find whether it's true or not don't search Google that's for lazy Christian Christians they go to Google to try to search things out if you want to search whether this message is right or not search the scripture because in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of the ministry of Willam Mary and Brandon I've already given you two scriptures that said that Malachi 4 Revelation 3 I gave you those I got another one for you today Revelation 10 is where we're going to go today if we can get there but we got scripture after scripture proving that this ministry will be here in this time yes sir Joel too also prophesied that this ministry would be here in this time so so so here uh we see people getting out of Step but now I'm going tell you even in the message I gave you one way to get out of Step you know by leaving the message but people have gotten out of Step oh Lord have mercy in the message and and and let me tell you something let me let me try to make this very clear to the church you know brother brandom said with Luther in his day the miracle was not just you know all the signs and wonder Wonders that was following his ministry the miracle was that he was able to hold his head above the fanaticism oh my God my God my God my God the miracle today is not necessarily what we see people walking away they just had an evil spirit attack them and they underneath an evil spirit but when you got people in the message that think they right Lord hallelujah amen but don't realize that they gotten off the word of God the the the the Miracles that we have to be able to hold our hands above the fanaticism yes sir am amen oh my God let me I I I got a few things that I I I want to share here and and one of them is out of just sermon turn on the light let me just set this up real good so you know the Lord just put in my spirit that uh and this was way back when we were in other Church let's have one one uh Friday night out of the month where we will we'll listen to a tape from the prophet and we used to come together at that building on that Friday night that first Friday Night of the month and we would listen together you know what the prophet I mean what the prophet was preaching Hallelujah and and I go through every year and I just set up for the next year what tape we're going to listen to I just ask the Lord just to lead us as to what tape and I and there's a lot of things that I think about uh when I when I'm when I'm when I'm getting taped now I know it's a Friday night I know you all have had a rough week Hallelujah and it's Friday night so I I try not to get a tape that's 6 hours long am I talking somebody I try not to get a tape that's 6 hours long because I know you won't hear it you'll fall asleep I'll fall asleep 6 hours so I mean I even tried 3 hours you listen to those tapes when you got time to kind of listen and then stop it at a certain point then go back and pick up and and just keep listening and and now some say well you got to act like you was in the service I understand that we weren't in that service and it was a totally different time period yeah amen you can't really it's hard to do that it's hard for the people to keep their attention that long now let me tell you something I'mma give you on the other side this now y'all just stay with me if you sit down and watch a football game for 3 hours or a basketball game for 3 hours and overtime hello somebody then you shouldn't have no problem don't be saying amen too fast that's right praise God if you got that kind of time let sit down and and watch all that or get on YouTube and and and and follow reals for 3 or 4 hours then you can listen to a tape for three or 4 hours right amen but we try to be sensitive and we try to find the tapes that we know that the people will be able to get something uh and feed their spirits and just kind of move on Hallelujah but after after we you know we come here we didn't we didn't get the Friday night service so we've been doing it at home I say Friday nights families get together and listen to the tape amen it'll be good for [Applause] families to get together once a month and listen to the tape we give you what tape is going to be I'm not talking about do it individually you as a family sit down and hear what the prophet is saying everybody get this get it on your schedule so so as I was flying back from the Philippines I was thinking to myself I said Lord what what are we what going to be the tapes that we're going to use for this this next year and I start going through to see which ones we probably already listened to and maybe some new ones that we can grab and uh and the Lord just kind of put put it together and and and I put it all on the schedule so it'll be ready uh for for the for the church to announce on Tuesday night so when I got back I had no idea we we we we took this sermon turned on the light and uh and I had no idea that in that sermon brother Brandon was going to be talking about our restore sayith the Lord that was another confirmation to the theme that we had in the Overflow right there in the tape yes sir amen and turn on the light when we listened to it on Friday it was right there in the tape yes sir see God knows how to speak God knows how to how how to confirm his word now I want to say this amen I believe in listening to the tapes see I I I done said a lot to get to a little just this little spot cuz I said people within the message then got out of Step remember I said that and now I'm bringing it all the way back around I believe in listening to the tapes whether we do it in the church or at home I believe in listening to the tapes what I don't believe I'm going tell you what I don't believe I don't believe in listen to the tapes only right am [Applause] am if you ain't heard that one yet it'll be coming your way when you hear somebody come tell you listen to the tape only what that mean is remove the preachers from the pull pit I'mma just say it like this brother brandom can't be your pastor I don't I think I I'm sorry that people you know I don't believe you play no tape for somebody's wedding I don't you believe you play no tape for a funeral how how would it look we went in there buing brother Wesco and we just play a tape no that would have been a wasted opportunity to get to some Souls Hallelujah we know what brother Wesco believes amen but it's up to a minister to stand behind the pull pit and preach the gospel because God himself said he gave some Apostles some Prophets some pastors some evangelists some teachers for the work of the ministry for the edification of the body Amen to bring us all to a place of perfection that's what God himself did in the church anybody trying to take the fivefold ministry out of church need to get back in step that's the trth trth all right uh I I thank God for this let's let me before I go into uh turn on the light let me get this this quote out of out of uh birth pains my God then I'm I'm going to turn on the light then I got a few more places and I'm a I'm I'm a I'm a I'mma let y'all alone but I tell you the truth I thank God for the word I thank God for the word I thank God for the word I have to say these things I I know know how different Spirits have been released sir and and so so it's my responsibility as your pastor to bring you back to the word now people will hear that and say brother Jack I'm sorry I don't agree with you let's sit down and talk the Bible if you don't agree with me let's sit down and talk the Bible I don't want not your feelings not your emotions let's talk the Bible I I'm here to tell you right now there is no other Prophet coming for the AE there was only seven and brother Brandon was the seventh there is no eighth Prophet if if if you find a as far as another person operating under prophetic Ministry I can tell you where to put them according to scripture because I believe it if as long as it's in scripture I believe it Ephesians 4 that's where they fit hallelujah amen but there's nobody else that we listen to outside of brother brandom I'm not quoting no other brother telling you that right now unless he say something real good and I just want to borrow and just tell you where I got it from but but to come here on a week to we basis and this brother said no I I ain't listening to no I ain't receiving letters from no other brother I got the letters y'all ain't y'all ain't going to talk to me this morning that's all right I talk to myself I ain't receiving letters from no other brother want to know what this brother said this this week I I I don't need that amen praise the Lord and I ain't got to get up here and preach this every week Lord but for the first Sunday let me just I'm talking about get back in step and I've seen it people have gotten out of Step even in this message amen amen praise the Lord so many folk done done done quit their jobs left their houses and moved to Jeffersonville and the prophet even told us anybody any anybody ever read that quote out of questions and answers should we come to Arizona or should we do this or should we and the prophet say no don't do that anybody read that quote no don't do that God sending me there by a vision but don't you do that amen he didn't want this thing to look like no cult he didn't the prophet himself didn't even want that he knew what type of spirit that was said no no you you you you'll meet God right where you are just stay with the word and now everybody want to I feel led to move to J no what what you moving there for and get there and don't even go to church hello church amen I'm here this morning I'm here yeah I'm I'm just I I I believe in listening to the tapes but but when it moves over to listen to the tapes only that's where the problem comes in exactly right e Eve Eve got off by one word hello church and and see don't get to the pars they listen to tapes only so we're not going to listen to tapes no that's the wrong spirit I believe that we should listen to the tapes that's where we get our nutrients from that's where I get my inspir from hello somebody but listen to the tapes only so so so here's the issue you got to be able to you got to the miracle is holding your head because people going to have all kind of things to say when I finish this sermon people going to be waiting for you at home but you got to take them back to the scripture what what scripture Are you standing on because brother Jack gave us Ephesians right it gave us revelation 10:7 what scripture you standing on I'm not talking about your feelings if you ain't got no scripture what you need to do is get back and step y'all going to make me shout I I when you standing on the word you stand on a immovable Foundation amen Jesus glory to God all right I'm I'm I'm let me let me read this brother brother Brandon and birth pain said then directly I heard that real sweet music come again it says and here come that same little bride coming by again he said this is this is what comes out though and when she walked by she was exactly like the one was in the first place so Omega was just like Alpha right walking to the step of the music what's the music the music of God's word look here look here look here look here I have said it before and I'm gonna say it again the reason I believe the message of the hour is because I can read it in the scripture Hallelujah yes sir it's not because of the signs wonders and miracles it's because I read it in Scripture that God God was going to send a prophet that's why I believe the message if you're not believing the message because it was based on scripture then you you'll fall to anything exactly right because even in the message people will bring you unscriptural things and you'll just fall for it God have mercy Jesus I I've had to ask people very specifically show me in the Bible where brother so and so's Ministry is identified now I'm I'm doing my best not to use names but I hope you can read between the lines amen am brother Soo yes sir amen amen that's right show me in the Bible where this ministry is Promised yeah right and then I I hear well you know brother brandham said brother thou art a prophet and I believe that I honestly believe that a prophet according to what right right I prophit according to Ephesians 4 that's it hello and I told you if and we got other people that done left the church because we wouldn't receive them as a prophet as long as you put your prophetic Ministry in Ephesians 4 it will always be receive yes sir but if your prophetic Ministry is trying to take you higher than Revelation 10:7 sir it won't be received hello church and everybody ought to feel that way your prophetic Ministry does not put you over Malachi 4 your prophetic Ministry does not put you over re Revelation 10 Revelation 3:14 your prophetic Ministry does not take you that high right your prophetic Ministry has a flow underneath this oh my don't y'all y'all want more scripture in the days of uh uh Paul uh Paul was a prophet for that age but there was another Prophet by the name of agabus his ministry was underneath Paul right hello so they receive AG's prophecy yes sir he even prophesied and told Paul you know this going to happen well look don't don't try to get me all afraid of that I'm I'm good I'm good I I mean I no he says he I think Paul told him none of these things [Applause] amen none of these things move me amen can I can I can I just borrow the words of Paul this morning huh I mean all this stuff I hear go going on around the message none of these things move me amen I'm not trying to fing you I'm trying to get you back in Step stay with the word the word is above everything the word is above our feelings the word is above our our emotions the word is final amen amen amen y'all y'all stay with me I'm coming home I'm trying to get there here we go I'm back in this quote birth pains when she walked by she was exactly like the one was in the first place walking to the step of the music of God's word marching on by and when I saw it I stood there with both hands up crying like that when I come to and and you know let me just let me inject this uh I thank God uh one of the sisters had had a question for me this week and and I was so I'm grateful you know for the question she was listening to a tape and I I like that hearing Saints at home listen to a tape and on the tape she heard right before brother Brandon began to preach a sister broke off in tongues and then uh a brother interpreted what she said and uh and brother brandom just prayed and thanked God for for what happened but I I told you all that that's really not the Bible order to do things the tongues come after the word has gone forth that's the Bible order so when some if some do it out of order just don't blast them and and and just just be patient with them right but but but I but I I I had taught that to the church so she remembered what I Tau but she saw this and brother brandom just kind of said it and so we start looking at it looking at it and and then um uh not realizing uh when she gave me the tape and I went back listened to it and then I said oh my the quote that I gave you all was in the same series of sermons but just two days later and and I would not doubt it was the same sister that that prophesied through tongues right before brother Brandon preached this was a um th this looked like it was a uh uh something common for her to do I'mma go right before the sermon I'mma let my tongues out brother brandham didn't say anything the first time he just let it go but then a few days later it happened again in the church he say sister the reason that um no interpret came is because it's just a little out of order it's a little out of order he said he said but I could feel the spirit too say and I can tell you if he would come back again at the at the after the services after the message has been preached I he he didn't use the word guarantee but he say I I know that God will come and vindicate and he'll he'll give a interpretation with those tongues now we don't know what happened at the end of that service cuz the tape didn't show us but we got the teaching and now that we got the teaching we can establish a church on the teaching Hallelujah and I saw it here in our church and then when I went to the Philippines I saw it there everything that I was teaching the church I saw manifested in the Philippines now you ain't going to tell me that God is a god of the Philippines only God is a god of West Palm Beach as well and if we've been teaching that word we're going to see it manifested get ready for the Overflow amen all right I'm I'm let me let me let me make my turn I got to got to turn he says walking the step of of the music of God's word marching on by and when I saw it I stood there with both hands up crying like that when I come to I was standing on my porch and there looking right across the field what she's to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that'll turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original Pentecostal message word by word Brothers we are here now this church is supposed to get a sign and its last sign we find out here in scripture see now see the great birth pains has been in this latery and age uh the church is being borned again okay now let me uh slip over here to uh turn on the light because this is where uh the Lord had us to for the very first tape to play at our in our homes Amen on Friday night was turn on the light amen for this year and here the prophet is speaking uh you you go back and listen to it if you haven't listened to it I encourage you go listen to it amen but here the prophet was talking about uh uh this restoration now I didn't I'm just picking up one of the other quotes that was that was given here uh and let's just read it and see some of the things that the prophet said and let's move on from there glory to God glory to God I I'm going tell you something I feel real good right now I feel real good right now I feel I feel I feel I feel I feel great like my Tony the Tiger great glory to God watch this now look at turn on the light look at this let me tell you don't refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which brings the warm War the warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you makes you a new creation in Christ Jesus don't try to walk in some glare of another age now that glare might have been all right in the other age it might been all right for them Hallelujah the Pentecost could walk in that light of another age the Methodist walked in the light of another age the Lutheran walked in the light of another age but this is a different age right it says it proves so in the day of our Lord Jesus he was the scriptural light of that day he was the light he wasn't the light until he come on Earth to vindicate the promised word you know he said there John was a bright and Shining Light and you love to walk in his light for a season talking about John the Baptist it says certainly because John had been prophesied by Isaiah 712 years before his birth that a voice of one would be crying in the wilderness then and then also Malachi the last of the prophets 400 years before his coming in the third chapter of Malachi Mal he said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way so these are scriptures that were written about John the Baptist and and and so when it come to ask Jesus he says you know uh are you he should we look for another like he's like I I I I get what John going through I understand uh you know his what what he's feeling because he's in prison and he's the prophet and he's in prison and and so on and so forth he says but tell John all these great things that's happening and it says now about John about John if y'all can receive it this is what was spoken of in Malachi 3 Hallelujah but the question was can you receive it and the same way it was spoken of John it's spoken of brother Brandon the question is can you receive it I I think I got a group of people that are living here in this area I mean multiple counties are covered multiple counties are covered okobi county is covered um uh uh Broward county is covered Palm Beach county is covered what county bravar county is covered huh Henry County is covered that's five of them that on our named I believe so far five counties in this little church got people that can receive it now the other people in the county be judged by you all's ability to receive it those that reject it will be judged by those that received I want to say that again those that have rejected will be judged by those that have received I tell you what if it wasn't right if it wasn't right like like sister Keesha told us I'mma be judged by my cult you say I'm in a cult right I'm going be judged by my cult you know what else you going to be judged by my cult my cult belief you going to be Jud by it all right watch it now I'm I'm moving on Amen uh here was John on the earth making that written word live he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and all also was preparing the way before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his light and people still love to walk in John's liks they refuse to accept brother brandom's light but they want to apply certain script to John because they love to walk in John's light that was light for a different day yes sir amen you going to have to find the light for this day come on church he said he say he says also was preparing the way before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his light because he was the light he was that light bright and Shining Light and John said now I must decrease my light must go out because why I have served my time that's prophesied of me hear ye him he is the one follow him it living in that day it prove this let me keep moving he says um now the Jews thought that they were worshiping in the True Light he says they thought they were worshiping the this same God that they they were turning down the very one that they thought they was they were worshiping they were crucifying my God he said they were making fun of the very God and making him a laughing stock of the people the very God that they thought they were worshiping say may I say this with reverence in respect but to bring light because as our brother said a while ago we're living later than you think we are one of these days something is going to happen it's going to be too late says the people will take on the mark of the beast not even knowing what they're doing now let me let me just work with that the people will take on the mar mark of the beast not even knowing what they're doing how does that happen how does that happen how how how do I end up taking on the mark of the beast and not even knowing that I did it let me help you the way that you take on the mark of the beast is by rejecting the light for your day when you reject the light for your day you accept the mark of the beast and you don't even realize it and you're going through the motions in church uhhuh and you just I mean you up there on the praise team and you got all these things going on and and it look like you just doing all kind of things under the mark of the beasto that's that that's powerful and people invite you sometime to come to their church and y'all you know we do it I see some of Y y'all text me I'm going over here to so and so Church you know you invite them they never come with you never but you go to them and I it's okay go be a light amen go be a light right he said but but but but the thing of it is they don't realize you come in there and you leave and every time you come and you leave you Le them because you got something a little greater light than what they got and you become judgment to them when you go oh y'all y'all ain't getting that you become judgment to them when you go cuz as soon as you walk in there now they have to acknowledge that there's some somebody in our midst that's right you might not know who I am I my my name my name Jack Duff is just a um uh this Jack Duff name is just a name you can identify with me on Earth but I got a greater name than that I got a greater title that name is Miss Jesus Christ amen Oh Glory Glory Glory all right let me keep reading um blind lead the blind he says the people will take on the mark of the beast not even knowing what they're doing blind lead to Blind they all fall in the ditch Jesus said and we're living uh later than we think many honest people follow that not even knowing what they're doing but the hours at hand now when the light is shining the Gospel Light in his power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifest himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he lotted for this day the things that he promised for this day must happen in this day if the church won't accept it it will you receive it if the church won't accept it God is able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham he'll get his message over because he's always done it he always will do it that means somebody going to be on the earth that's going to believe it I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them let me keep going people thinking that they're walking in the light the traditions of the fathers and the first thing you know they're walking in a glare of a light not the same light rejected the very light that they claim to be worshiping rejected the very light that they claim to be worshiping anyone forsaking the revealed word for this hour and then rise up and say by me forsaken it now I'm free boy the devil know how to paint a bad picture actually you go into bondage spiritual bondage and you know what hurt the most is that ain't nobody around you that you convince that you can convince that they are they're wrong and they need to see what you see everybody just like okay praying for you yeah and that's just a that's just it's a lonely feeling and sometime we think that we standing alone uh and you know we we got to say if you know if I have to stand alone I stand alone it's a lonely feeling when you standing out there without the truth it's a different story when you stand alone on the truth because when you stand on on the truth like we heard from the sisters on Tuesday night you're never alone amen amen amen all right I'm I'm I'm almost finished with this one let me it says um they walk in the glare of a light not the same light reject the very light that they claim to be worshiped his Works thoroughly Vindicated who he was Jesus said himself search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me who can condemn me of sin he said he who can prove that I have said anything or any claim that I have made that the heavenly father father hasn't Vindicated me uh Vindicated that through me he has proved to you that he was the light of the hour because it was all prophesied that this Messiah should be this way and hear it bloomed to life but their Traditions that separated them from the real light of the word now I'm uh I'm about done but I just want to read this one scripture because remember Revelation 10 is where I'm going uh last week I was just mentioned to you out of the resume of the Church ages I won't read the quote the full quote but brother Brandon promised in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning uh he also said God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning and he's doing it as stated in in Joel 2:23 by the teaching rain and uh the former rain and the Harvest rain uh the teaching rain and he said the Harvest rain which is Rapture in faith and um and then he also talked about how you know there there would be many in denominational churches and this was this this is a prophet helping us see this before the mega church even came on the scene the prophet had already told us this was coming Hallelujah and don't tell me I used to work for one and and I I I and and working I saw a lot of things brother brother brandom said in that quote he says uh that they were outshine the elect in effort and in Zeal true we got a little Pantry going and we how many people y'all y'all feeding then compared to how many people they feeding they going to outshine the elect in effort and Z it's not based on how many people we feed let's just go out and feed somebody amen it's not the numbers it's it's it's the action that matters most praise the Lord so so so they outshine the elect and effort and Zeal he says but it's layer to sin is not of Christ right and it says uh looks for big crowds big programs startling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of Christ but there's the problem but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger and what that advent is the arrival of a notable person thing or event they they deny the arrival and I'm telling you he's already come and he's gone before I was even born he was already gone that's but I still believe his words were for our age amen amen Malachi 4 promised it we read that Revelation 3:14 promised it we read that let me read Revelation 10 the this this the reason we believe this message is because God promised it according to his word Malachi 4 read it in your Bible ask Google I think um brother brother Diggs when I I said in the Philippines I said don't search don't search Google search the scriptures search the scriptures and see what the scriptures are saying brother Diggs while he he heard that and he had just felt inspired let me just search Google for one one quick thing he put in there who is Cain's [Laughter] father and Google brought an answer back Google said Kane's father was Adam okay w wow can you trust Google because my Bible say Kain was of that Wicked one that's what my Bible say but lazy Christians trust Google read your Bible if Google say Kane was Adam's father somebody somebody got something wrong in Google here the Bible don't say that so I'm not trusting goooo right Hallelujah glory to God you better read your Bible Church know where you stand with scripture yes sir you know you know brother Brandon's job was to turn our hearts back to the scripture so when I'm standing on this you you you ain't going to be able to move me from this that's why I say bring me your Bible bring me your Bible and show me what brother so ando's role is uhoh uhoh uh-oh I know you got a quote but is that quote lining up with this Bible hello somebody otherwise if you can't make it line up with this B cuz most most likely when you bring your quote I already know in my mind where to put that quote in the scripture I know what scripture brother Brandon referring to I ain't going to tell you too quickly I got to make sure that you're ready to re receive it that's amen Lord have mercy Revelation 10 let me let me let me try to let's look at this this is this is a promise for this day verse one let's start there and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now now just so that you're clear brother randoms already told us who this is this is Christ this is the Lord Jesus Christ now uh y'all know in 1963 there was a cloud that showed up in Arizona and when you the cloud came in one particular um position and and and all the people that I mean the the newspaper whoever it was the magazine that took it Life Magazine I believe that took the picture uh they uh they were trying to wonder what it is brother brandham never went to Life Magazine to express to them what this was but to his church and those that would listen to a tape he expressed something it says turn the picture to the right and when we turn the picture to the right it was seven angels making the face of Christ Hallelujah and it was a cloud I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothe with a cloud these these things already manifested okay and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were uh was as it were the son and his feed is pillars of fire I don't have time to get into all these things it just so this is rich rich rich rich there's a quote where I got brother brandom say he was standing in the sun preaching the gospel and he said when he standing in the sun he he he he was he was so so so inspired because he said I got two climaxes to my sermon and he say he was just trying to get the people to just hang on for the first Climax and he said the people got a little rest restless and some of them say I just want some biscuits and he said if they want biscuits let them go get biscuits he said come back for the service at night though come back come back he say cuz I got another climax for this sermon right and uh and he say just watching the people say but you know what the problem is is the people rejecting the word they didn't even realize they were rejecting the word and and and they not standing around to actually hear the two climaxes now now and I was looking at that because he had that Vision after a sermon that he preached and in the sermon that he preached the sermon was titled uh spoken words The Original Seed in that sermon you'll notice that brother brandom did have two climaxes if you listen to the sermon you'll see there's a part one and there's a part two most people probably missed what it already happened and let me tell you people still missing today things that have already happened amen oh lord lord lord lord Lord amen let me uh let me go on don't don't get caught up brother brandom's not coming back to to to do anything else his work is done it's done church amen if it wasn't done then the scripture would not have been fulfilled I'm coming to it I'm coming to it let me keep reading this would not have been fulfilled had had his work not been done but because God called him home that's all we know his work is done sir amen I'm looking for him to come back in the general Resurrection just like I'm looking for my daddy and I'm looking for brother Wesco huh I'm looking for brother Mike I'm looking for a lot of Believers to come back my God give me the rest of the scripture I I I'm running out of time I'm running out of time he had his little he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders utter their voices now I can pause here and take just a little just a little time on this brother brand tells us what the seven Thunders are the prophet told us now there's been other ministers say different things than what the prophet said but my job is to say what the prophet said now you want to know what the prophet said right before God called him out the scene he says this um this Messenger will do two things he says the first thing this message going to do he says he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and let me tell you something that's already happened amen the second thing that he was going to do he says he says he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders which are contained in the Seven Seals yes sir Hallelujah and he say he says this right in the church a book and he says so so so but but what what happened is that people had us looking at one paragraph in the fourth seal and we thought that was it no the messenger said it was contained in the completion sir of the Seven Seals that means that simply means every time a a seers reveal a thunder was manifested now now now now now now here's the thing amen that does not take away the fact that we need the Holy Ghost to manifest The Life of Christ in us but your virtues are not your Thunders am amen your virtues is a holy ghost life amen and if you claim to have the Holy Ghost these virtues should be manifested in you amen the Thunders were according to the prophet the things that were revealed in the Seven Seals amen yes yes sir that's what he told us amen then I get brothers that they they they they they actually if you hear somebody say well seven seal book is not inspired don't don't don't read that it's not inspired we don't actually have a tape recording of the seven seal book I mean I'm sorry the seven Church age book so that's not inspired so don't you know I would just I you know that's brother LEL book when you hear people say that to you you know they're trying to prove a doctrine that cannot be supported by the seven Church age book every doctrine that we believe in this message was found in the church age book even the seals were in the seven Church age book oh my God everything we believe was there so so so so what happens that brother Brandon before he passed he was working with brother Lil for 5 years to get that book translated and it's written in a way that anybody can understand it they even use it at or Roberts uh University they use a church age book so you know that book's pretty important and and and the other thing I find is that right after brother brandom approved it the very month that he approved that I'm good with this let's release it God called them home and then people say they don't want it I'll take it I'll take it am I remember being in Africa for the first time and uh while I was while I was there they had they they you know how to get James Erol Jones to read certain parts of the Bible uh actually read the whole Bible they just use his voice you know and just you know you push play in got James ear voice uh play and James O Jones voice well there was a brother that read the whole church age book like that and um so we got there to Africa and they was they there was playing a tape in a vehicle while we were driving I was in uh um uh Nigeria and um and and um so I'm listening to this tape I'm like uh now that ain't brother brandom's voice but that's the word I know I know this ain't brother this ain't brother rand's voice but this is the word I know this the word so what and they just going on and on so the brother say oh no no this is the new tape that they got where a brother read the church age book and that that's what we just planing that I said okay I knew it was the word even though one brother Brandon's voice and I could say Amen to it because I knew it was the word hallelujah you got to know what is the [Music] word and what's not the word [Music] word and I'm going tell you this there are people in your message that are not on the word get back in Step let me keep reading let me keep reading let me keep reading when the seven Thunders that uttered their voices I was about to write that I mean John heard it and he was going to write it but he didn't because this this this this the reason John Couldn't Write it because this was left for brother Brandon to reveal this was his ministry the same way the same way John can write what the Thunders that uttered right brother brandom could not go to Israel the same God that stopped John is the same God that stopped brother Brandon from going into Israel because that's not his Ministry oh my when these when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered write them not John heard it but couldn't write it let me go on and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the Heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and now I believe it's in my um I go back to that verse in my uh emphatic daglock which is the original translation of the scripture it'll say time shall no longer be delayed can I put it this way we are at the end of the end the these scriptures have already been manifested people afraid to even read this in the churches but we we can read it and even tell you that it's already been manifested a time shall be no longer Revelation 10:6 look at this verse verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets would y'all allow me just to read two more quotes and I will will close out today they going to be related to these verses this this is coming out of I have heard but now I see says what if Moses would have come and said let's build an ark like Noah did float out of Egypt down the river oh no sea no he had a message from God he was the manifestation that Prophet arising on the scene ought to have proved to it is right there they hadn't had a prophet for 400 years they hadn't had a prophet and here a prophet Rises on the scene they ought to they ought to have know that something was going to happen Israel again hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and and and here come Jesus on the scene and the woman at the well said sir I I perceive that you are a prophet now we haven't had one for for 400 years because he know what was in her heart see now he goes on here and I have heard but now I see he says now we're promised a church age through reformers that's uh Luther and Wesley we promis the church a through through through reformers he says and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father for that very purpose and the church is to be broke up in denominations and isms it it's it's it's so tore to Pieces he says till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message Revelation 10:7 he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed which also are the Thunders because the the seals are the Mysteries that were contained underneath the Thunders all right he says um and then he promised in the hour the seventh Angels message the Seven Seals would be revealed and look at this and the Mysteries would be declared Revelation 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service when you get to 63 brother brandom had doors closed like left and right nobody wanted him anymore but he was told by those seven angels go back to Jeffersonville and preach those Seven Seals and that's exactly what he did these followed the healing services and you know rainbow trout they just don't bite at anything rainbow trout a trout that that's looking for the word we happen to be rainbow trout amen amen oh my God my God my God I got I got one more I I I got more than one more but I'm I got to stop I got to stop this is my last one what is the attraction on the mountain now according to my timer I got 1 minute and 55 seconds left I'm bringing it home I promise what is the attraction on the mountain I'm so glad I get a chance to sew good seed into this church establish you on the word so that you won't be confused by none of this stuff that's going on what is the attraction on the mountain brother random what happened what's happened upon Mount Sunset that's where the Seven Angels Came okay what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about now this is 19 19 65 that this quote is going forth says uh and mount Sunset is 1963 is when it happened uh he says that's what all this noise about notice is God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 101 to 7 all right it says and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed now now he just gave us another scripture that ties to his ministry St Luke 17:30 I'm going to come there because there's so many other things that go with St Luke 17:30 I'm giving you scripture after scripture after scripture that identifies brother Brandon's Ministry if you can't give that to me for brothers so and so you can just stop talking about it I ain't rece in it amen amen and if you want to talk about cuz I know people get mad if you get mad show you got the wrong Spirit I'm talking about the word brother Jack just going against what I believe if you believe the word why I ain't going against what you believe let's sit down and oh okay there it is come on brother there it is all right that's let me know I'm I'm I'm I got to bring it home look look at this the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10: 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and there shall AR there shall rise false prophets and false christs show great signs and wonders and and people try to say that about brother Brandon the Bible say it's going to be false false prophets now remember brother brandom told us this for every bogus dollar I don't care how many bogus dollars how many false prophets you got out there in order to get a bogus dollar you got to have at least one one real dollar to make bogus dollars from it sir right so we got to have one real Prophet if we're going to have a lot of false prophets so you want to find the real Prophet we found them look at this there shall AR there shall arise false Pro prophets and false Christ show great signs and wonders in so much it would deceive the very elect if possible the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just just puzzled let me keep going and the science all through Tucson yet they're writing pieces and put in the paper way back over on Mount Lemon uh them big cameras didn't see it rising up from where where where we were standing drifting on towards the West showing the time is over now remember the scripture said that time would be no more showing that time is over amen it can't go but a little piece there is at the West Coast judgment struck just in the very way it went going right up over Phoenix and right on across onto Prescott and across the mountain to the West Coast right on uh up into uh where was they going right on up into Alaska and she is thundering heading right that way and the observ and OBS observatories and all of them in Tucson all still asking research of science trying to find out what it is so high they can't they they they so high it can't be foged mist or nothing up there what did it where is it at they're just as puzzle of the supernatural Halo hanging Yonder in the sky as there was when the Magi come in following a star saying where is he that's born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word and there shall rise a star out of Jacob he says and and and the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights watch this one now 3 years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now but now it's history the prophet has already come the prophet has already gone and if he had not done his job it wouldn't be considered history but the prophet himself said this has already been manifested it was a mystery three years ago 1962 it was a mystery but in 1965 it was history and we've been fellowshipping around history for the last 60 years amen amen amen it's pasted the promises fulfilled what time is it sir and what's the attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever now he said let us pray and I'm going to do that but I want to tell you we have received the Advent yes of this messenger we believe he's come and gone and that's why we keep identifying what he said in order to keep the church in line now you know it took 40 Years of the children of Israel going through the Wilderness before they actually entered the promised land but you know in that 40 years what they had to do they had to stay with what Moses said and I don't care how much fanaticism rose up in the midst of them 40 years just like for us it's been 60 years but I don't care how much fanaticism rise up the the miracle is US keeping our head above the fanaticism and staying with this word amen I'm church I'm encourag you get back and step and and if you if and and and as the Lord has carried us over into this new year we got other people out there that's out of Step I I know why some people won't come to this church they know where I stand with this word they hear me preaching but I'm going to encourage you if you have a question with anything that I'm standing on this word let's sit down and talk about it I can go through the Bible and I can go through the message with you and I'd be happy to do it anything anything you got to question about let's let's talk about it oh I know where I'm standing at I know exactly why is this why is that and and I could tell y'all some of the questions that I know people thinking why you do this why you do that why you let this brother preach why you let that I can give you I give you answers for everything you got now the question is not whether I got an answer the question is am if you can receive it let's pray father Lord I just I'm this has just been a good journey for me I I believe it's been one for the church as well Lord to see that we're standing on on Vindicated word your Prophet has provided has given it to us Lord a Ministry that you uh called them off the scene 60 years ago but yet we're holding true to what was spoken no one has received Vindication way he received Vindication Supernatural events that he received nobody even in that time and since that time has received that type of vindication so we know Lord Jesus this was of you and as we hold steady there a division showed that the bride would get out of Step but somehow somehow as the prophet prayed let them get back in step we find ourselves in that place where we we're we're back in step and we're trying to help others Lord Jesus we're trying to help others father come to this place where they recognize the word not not not a feeling not an emotion not anything but Lord this word that's what we have to stand on that that's all that

done in this hour God we thank you for this year of overflow thank you that the wine and the oil will overflow God and and as we see this stimulation of Revelation and we see the Holy Spirit moving

people are live where wherever we are dealing with in our life we expect overflow for this year and help us Lord to manage the Overflow as it comes just as Joseph managed to overflow God before the
