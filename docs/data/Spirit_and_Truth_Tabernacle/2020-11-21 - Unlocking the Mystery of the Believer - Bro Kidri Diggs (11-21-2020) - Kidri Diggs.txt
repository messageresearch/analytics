be seated in the presence of the lord amen so good to be in the house of god tonight man how we just appreciate the lord jesus and and all that he continues to do for us amen i'm happy to have pastor smiley with us on tonight man we thank god for him um i nowadays with the way that things are just going down it's kind of hard to tell people in advance what you're doing so i never really announced to you all who was coming i just said guest speaker and sometimes things get out and maybe maybe you hear about it through other means but we're happy to have brother diggs with us on tonight amen and i certainly just come with uh an expectation i was telling him just how the lord's just been moving in the services and and i just felt that god's timing was right to bring an evangelist a man right along around the same time and you know just i believe expectations are already high and i just believe god can do even more amen than what we even imagined uh as we come tonight and so we're just happy to be here and it's so good to see a man uh sister liz amen back from california praise the lord thank the lord for taking her there bringing her back safely amen also uh we have some relatives a man of uh brother simba and sister ruth amen good to have them with us amen on tonight praise the lord we all amen just thank god for them um so i um um do we have any announcements that i just need to make mention of if not don't don't worry i'll just make mention of this amen um we uh as far as giving uh we just have a wooden box here on the table uh as you're going out of the sanctuary it's just a little wooden box there if you have an offer that you want to put in you can put it in that wooden box those that would like to give online i was told brother brother diggs told me that um uh there was some saints that's going to be watching amen to service amen uh uh just up in the carolinas and i said well praise the lord and be happy to have them join us but uh you know we we welcome them and everybody else that's online will welcome you tonight to the service and just trust that the lord bless you where you are those that desire to give online we do have two methods that you can use uh one is through uh paypal the others through cash app right there in the center screen we have our cash app name dollar sign spiritual tea and if you use paypal just make sure you use the option of send to a friend a family member and use the email address of giving at john423 [Music] if you wanted to mail offering in to the church we certainly appreciated the address to the churches on the bottom of the screen there amen so let's just pray oh our giving amen um and um we'll prepare to get our speaker out just let him just be used by the lord amen on tonight father we just thank you for the opportunity we have to give thank you lord jesus for uh meeting every one of our needs uh supplying our needs according to your riches in glory uh thank you for every way that you've made every door that you've opened thank you god for just continuing to prove yourself that you are jehovah jireh you are not limited by a pandemic amen you're not limited by anything the world can throw in our our direction you're still god in the midst of it all and you prove yourself over and over and over again thank you father lord as we come and bring our offering to you tonight may you use it for the furthest of your kingdom here on earth be glorified and magnified in our giving lord as we turn our hearts towards the word of the lord tonight we pray that the spirit of god would have the preeminence in this place use your servant god in a very special way lord and how we just appreciate his ministry and god we just seen you just use them so many times and god we're just grateful for a gift like this that's able to come our way god you know the needs of the hearts of the people here those that are online god meet the needs of the people wherever they are god is our prayer lord and uh we just we're careful to give you all the honor all the glory and all the praises in jesus name we pray amen amen amen i had a chance to speak with sister dixon and she just wanted to send her greetings to the church uh just to tell y'all she missed y'all so much and a man just actually just continue to remember her in prayer and that the lord just continued to touch her body i also want to remember a sister ralan a man in our prayers she had to bury her father uh on today amen so just remember sister i'm there in lumberton north carolina just remember her and your prayers as well that god would just give them strength during this season amen let's just stand to our feeders we welcome god's servant to the pulpit tonight precious brother cadre diggs a man dear friend of mine and uh his ministry has been a blessing uh years ago when we first started out in ministry he was one of the first evangelists to come in our direction and uh and i remember uh just you know just the the sacrifices and things that he would make during that time and and you know and just uh it was just a real it was precious to me uh that he would come our way we were just very few people but he would come and amen and be a blessing and uh and still to have him as a friend today that we can just pick up the phone and call and amen and he'll come so we we just appreciate him and i just believe uh back in those times he was a blessing tonight amen i believe he had been blessed and i remember when he was blind came here blind he was preaching blind well i had a brother smiley's church there in okeechobee and uh and he said only time his eyes would actually come open is when he'd step into the pulpit and actually read the word of god and begin to preach but soon as he would close his bible and and step out the pulpit his eyes were just shut tight again uh but i remember you know we saw him there in that condition and they went out to eat on a sunday after service and they were at a golden corral and i believe brother smiley told brother dixon if you want to get some food from the buffet you have to open up your eyes and go up there and get it and uh and uh brother dick said okay if that's the way it's gonna be he popped his eyes open by faith and they've been open ever since our god is a healer amen he's a he he's he's a right now god right so so so as our brother comes i don't know what the needs here but i i will tell you this that amen god has done so much in our brother's life and any he has testimony after the testimony of testimony he could share but i know god will meet whatever need you have here tonight amen there's nothing too hard for our god amen as we welcome my precious brother diggs to the pulpit let's just sing a man of course this song there's nobody like you lord [Music] hallelujah nobody like you nobody like you lord say oh nobody like you lord nobody like you jesus live your voice and say i really love you a lot i really i really love you lord hey everybody i really love you jesus say i really love you lord i really love you hey we said [Music] hey come on somebody tell them what to say love oh i really mean [Music] oh [Music] let's see one more time [Music] amen praise the lord there's nobody like our king jesus healer we make up hallelujah thank you lord amen it's good to be in west palm again we thank the lord for all of you have come out to hear the word of god and we pray that you come to see the lord because without him being here it's just a bunch of us just come together but we we know if god is here all things are possible so we have to come with that expectation and i pray that the lord will give you something you can take home you know something that you can live by and uh again like like jack said you know we've known each other a long time amen and uh it's been good um first time i i think one of the first times i ever came to florida to preach was actually at brother smileys i think um years ago and then from there we kind of they kind of got me in the loop to start preaching that brother wesco meetings and his history from there you know so we i love them brothers i certainly appreciate them they like big brothers to me and uh anything i can do to help them and likewise i know uh they'll do it for me so we just we just love god and it's good to be here still believing the same thing amen because trials and tribulation has altered some people's thinking it ain't the word that's changed it's just the way they're thinking that's changed so i'm grateful that i still think like i once thought when i first got illuminated you know and that's a blessing amen so we just love god let's just have a word of prayer and we just pray that the lord is going to move you know i'm grateful you know my my voice is much better you know i want a piece of this but i'ma just let it go you know because this time probably uh a year ago i had no voice i mean every time i would try to preach or sing it just clog up on me and that was it but i didn't quit i kept preaching i kept singing and i kept saying it's gonna come back it's gonna come back and it's almost there it's almost there i i i'm not settling for a cracking of the song no i wanted to be clear and pure that's what i'm looking for like it was god can restore amen that's what we're believing for so let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god tonight if you have a need you can lodge it to the lord by uplifting hand lord god we just love you we appreciate you and thank you there's nobody like you lord lord we can search this world over and over again lord but nothing can compare to you lord you're our strength you're our peace your lord you're our deliverance our healer lord our provider lord any adjective that speaks of good and greatness father it speaks of you lord so lord we thank you for just calling us out of the world lord and illuminating this word in our lives father and holding us father because we know it's not us holding ourselves but father you predestinated us for this time to stand on the word and and live the truth and manifest the word that's been coming forth lord so we pray you just bless the hearers that are hearing lord and give them the spirit to be able to do what they hear lord not just lord be a bystander but be a partaker of the manifestation of the word and lord we just pray that you would just bless this church lord and the different churches represented father and lord god you just continue to give us increase as we see your near your your coming gets closer so in the name of jesus christ we ask for forgiveness for any areas in our lives that's not like you lord keep us under your atoning blood in the name of jesus christ we pray hey church amen amen if you um have your bibles amen i i gotta i got a lot of scripture but i'm gonna just pray that the lord will just lead me according to his mercy i mean let's go to exodus the first chapter exodus one exodus one let's um let's start reading that verse verse eight 1 and verse 8. the bible says now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph and he said unto the people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we my isn't that something come come on let us deal wisely with them let lest they multiply and it come to pass that when their fault when they're falling out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them task masks to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities feed them and ramses but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew they were grieved because of the children of israel my you mean to tell me the more pressure they put on the stronger they got sound like people are god to me amen let's go to joshua uh the first chapter joshua joshua chapter one um let's just read verse nine the bible says have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so thou goest amen the lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of god we want to we want to use for a subject tonight unlocking the mystery of the believer unlocking the mystery of the believer now you know if we just take uh a natural type we know that uh spiritually we are called the bride amen and if you just take a natural type of a wedding you take everybody everybody is already seen but nobody knows who the bride is hallelujah you got you got the pastor up there you got all the officers you got the pastor you got the best man you got the gurusman you got the bridesmaid matrix of honor honor of guests but until that bride comes nothing else is taking place so you know the bride has always been a mystery hallelujah but church uh what unlocks the mystery of the bride speaking spiritually hallelujah but if we look right here in the book of exodus the bible said that there arose a pharaoh who realized that the slaves were stronger than they was think about that he he got a revelation and the people that he was persecuting he looked at them and he said in his mind if those people ever come together if those people ever realize who they are if they ever realize that they are stronger and mightier than the people that sitting on this throne if they ever realize if they could just come together and do things like sisters and brothers we're in trouble hallelujah in church today if we as a bride of people could realize that god made us the head and not the tale we could get further down the road but we have too many chiefs and not enough indians hallelujah we need to learn how to follow instead of always trying to lead and you know that was the demise of the children of israel they couldn't follow behind the one god was using to lead because somebody wanted some credit hallelujah so they could say i know god too church we're not in a time where we're trying to prove who knows god who don't know god we just want to make it in heaven hallelujah what i i was telling somebody one of the best things god did for me when i first got saved two things first he gave me a revelation of paying tithes that's a powerful revelation i'm gonna tell you how powerful it is that revelation is so powerful hallelujah i i i i started evangelizing in 2009 without a job and i'm still here in 2020 did you hear me church did you hear me so when phase got tight i had a promise i had a promise that was unlocked i had a promise that would unlock a mystery in my life you know my neighbors brother solomon they would work a 9-5 when they go home when they go to work i'm at home when they come back i'm at home when they go to school i'm at home and they're wondering how my bills get paid it was a mystery hallelujah but when you become obedient to god's word he will unlock things in your life that the average person cannot understand [Applause] [Music] i have that oh my praise god i had one brother come to my house and try to do some business one time he said he pulled up in the neighborhood and he said brothers can't stay out here he said he can't stay out here he said kept driving down and the houses got bigger and bigger he said he can't stay down here and they wonder how's he doing i ain't it's god church we fail to realize that god uses certain things to get the best out of us and tonight you know i kind of want to i want to encourage you because in this hour you know a lot of people fighting against what they believe you know a lot of people unsure what i want you to understand look at what god told joshua his church he said be strong and very courageous he said don't be dismayed now why would he tell joshua that at the beginning of his ministry before he even did anything god said joshua be shown he said now i'll tell you this again be strong he told me at least twice before he even did anything why god knew he was gonna have to fight so he put joshua's mindset in a mode that no matter what happens god told me to be strong and courageous be not dismayed by my light bill be not dismayed by the covenant we're not dismayed by the people backsliding being not dismayed but be so and very courageous church that's where we are there are giants in the land but they can be defeated [Music] because god puts you in a day where giants have to fall hallelujah but we know we see so much turmoil so much things going on in the world and people are wondering if they still believe the truth but when you when you think about look what god look what the scripture says about the children of israel again he says but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel now look this is a prime example of who we really are pressure is supposed to bring out who you really are pressure is supposed to unlock the mystery of who you are holy not easy going god sent me a prophet and praise god i'm in church every night no it's the things you go through that shapes and forms you and brings out character hallelujah but you know people hate to be tested you know what if you don't be tested you'll never go to the next level so you got to go through something hardly but my old desire is to go through it like paul paul said for this purpose i came think about his purpose church he was bit by a snake hunter venomous snake he was he was in the sea of night and day man hey rip over five times four stripes stone through over the wall and paul said if i grow it i'm a glory in the things i suffer man how many of us give god praise hallelujah when we go through something where was the last time he said oh god thank you for my trials we don't talk like that but let me tell you something that's believable language that's believable language holy i got another scripture romans 4 verse 20 holy when when abraham was going through his trouble the bible says that he got strong in faith the more he went through the stronger he got church that's our inheritance but you know what we go through things and we start to question in my bride lord why me because you have to become perfect hollywood church if if i can for a second i want to show you something you see this if you can't see it that mean you too far back this ain't no classroom we want to be right in the presence of god you see that that's a seed unless you had experiences with the seed before honey you don't know what kind of seed this is see every seed has a mystery that needs to be unlocked but there's only one process there's only one thing that the seed needs for it to get going [Music] and the first thing that gets it going ain't water it ain't sunlight no the first thing that gets the seed going is you have to plant it in dirt the only way i can get anything out of this i got to put it in a dirty filthy nasty condition [Applause] whoa but that condition is going to start the process of its transformation it needs dirt not just any kind of dirt but good dirt i messed up are you still here so that means that mess up was good i did some things i'm not proud of but i'm still here so what i did was good dirt i didn't told lies why i'm saved but that was a good dirt how did you think i know god wasn't proud of but you know what my seed is in good dirt because i need that dirt to come forth somebody say i'm good dirt because dust you are thus you shall return and for those who might get a feeling ain't no dirt oh yes you are yes you are because when your life leaves your body this right here gonna go back to dirt but the thing of it is what's important is the life inside of the shell but it needs a condition a dog dry dark dry no light no water filthy condition and unless it's put in that condition i'll never get anything out of it he said oh brother jesus put it in the presence of the lord in church no good it's sitting right there do you feel the holy ghost no good hallelujah this is the atmosphere of the holy ghost no good that seed will never bring anything forth until it's put in dirt you say brothers i went to church but where are you holy he says accept a grain of wheat hurry what happens it has to go in the ground it has to die it has to rot this life has to look stinking well god bless you my brother now you look at yourself and you know that you just filled the ranks you know you ain't nothing without the lord holy but you know what if you can see yourself like that you can see the grace of god and that's the reason why the people can't see the grace of god because they think they're somebody we ain't nothing but five and six feet of what dirt and i can take this you know the prophet god said the closest place to heaven is behind the pulpit now i'm gonna take this peach seed and put it in the closest place is it giving me anything it ain't gonna give me nothing i can lay down hallelujah and have jack preach holy brother smiley preach i preach brother biscuit priest on and on tim pruitt donny reagan everybody put that seat back there let them preach in the presence of god but unless this has dirt [Music] unless it has dirt the mystery will remain a mystery the only thing that can unlock it hallelujah the only thing that can bring it forth is a trial look look in the bible mostly every believer that came forth they came forth out of a trial holy we didn't know who they were until they were put under the microscope and then the real them i was preaching the message to real you the real you had to come out hallelujah and if i could just say you take moses hallelujah moses was born hallelujah under a decree of pressure hello he was but but that decree it didn't change what his mom and daddy saw they knew that their child was special and then hallelujah king pharaoh sitting out of the creek we're gonna kill all the young men we're gonna keep we're gonna keep the girls but we're gonna kill all the men don't that sounds like the world today where are the good men where are the men that's leading the children where are the men the good men in church in the strip club they had the ball game they doing all these things what is it it's a degree that's went out to kill our men because pharaoh know if i can get to men the women will struggle hallelujah but listen church and it's a sad place to be if you're a woman that don't want no handshape because you fall right on the ladder to see you see pressure will tell me who you are [Music] hallelujah but you look church you say okay let's just take moses moses hallelujah he was born a proper child you know when he was born his parents saw a lot of light came in the room but that still didn't bring out who he was the pill of fire over his head that still didn't unlock his mystery look what happened when that degree went out hallelujah josephine and amram they say no we ain't killing our baby i ain't giving my baby to the world i don't care who the president is i don't care they say this is a red state i ain't giving my baby to him i don't care if it is a blue state i ain't giving up giving my baby to jesus [Music] you know what it's imma hit this real quick and get off of it but it's amazing how many believers get caught up in politics when we know that church and state don't mix we know that god has nothing to do with politics when when christ came in because the sadducees and pharisees them democrats and republicans hallelujah they couldn't understand the word when it was being revealed why because they wanted everything politically correct jesus why didn't your disciples wash their heads jesus why didn't they bless their food jesus why are you doing this on the sabbath day they want everything politically correct [Music] but look church that didn't change amram and josephine it made who they really were come out hallelujah because they looked like just ordinary people till they had to sacrifice their child and they said no i ain't sacrificing my baby you know what i'm gonna do and you think about it this sounds crazy but this pressure made her do something she wouldn't ordinarily do on a regular day this pressure she said think about this she said you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take my baby my moses and i'm gonna put them in a basket and i'm a picture within without and i'm gonna put them in a now with crocodiles and pythons it seemed like that was more pressure putting the baby in a place that she couldn't control but what was it she was trusting in god see when you are a believer sister brown when pressure comes god is just trying to get you to trust him [Music] he ain't trying to make you quit he's trying to get you to trust him but what we do we get mad we fuss we switch churches we do all kind of stuff when all god is trying to do is get the real you to come out that brother preaching on me trying to get the real you to come out ain't nobody shake my hand you're trying to get the real you to come out someone's so sick i ain't going to that church you're trying to get the real you to come out haven't y'all realized covet has shown who the real believers are i was talking to a friend of mine in another country and we was talking about before the lock down after lockdown time to go back to church and he was having a vote to come back to church and the people voted no supposed to be believers they say no we're going to stay home and stream come on see what they want they want a ministry they can control they want a time they can control they want atmosphere they control and see right now they're watching me they're doing this turn that all the way down turn it down he too loud turn it down and they can go to a game with 70 000 people streaming to the top of the lawn and they lose their mind but when they come to god they want more control oh honey wait a minute i gotta go feed me a sandwich that's what people want they want to be able to control everything but see god he wants us in a place where he wants us to develop trust hallelujah and you know church in this time and hour that we end pressure is the only thing that's going to bring out who you are but we are not to run from the pressure we ought to welcome the pressure holy we are to say thank you lord shape me move me for me into who you want me to be hallelujah but you look hallelujah mary if you go through your trial right you'll find yourself hallelujah stepping into things that god has already done because god don't change hallelujah look at hallelujah josephine what happened she said you know what i'ma put my son in a basket and i'mma pitch it within and without what was she doing she was tapping into deliverance that had already took place in an arc [Music] [Applause] but this time it wasn't a boat it was a basket this time it was noah it was moses hallelujah same scene hallelujah same god delivering in a time of tribulation hallelujah and if you go through your trial right you'll pick up that same god that had delivered in times before see god cannot change [Music] so if he did it before he'd have to do it again and you look hallelujah she was so inspired she said i'm not just gonna put him in a basket but i'ma slime it what was that when she was catching the inspiration she was unlocking a mystery what was it the mystery of the deliverance why because a child was the next deliverer oh my god and then she puts the baby she puts the baby don't get nervous don't buy the clothes she puts the baby in the basket and she freely gives him up and she lets him go down the river and she takes a hand off of it the prophet god said if you ever want god to move he said give god a communal hallelujah he said you committed to god take your hands off of it and leave it alone he said then god is obligated to answer that prayer and he said if you don't answer that prayer he said didn't you be certain of god [Music] hallelujah little church and then he got to a place where moses now is just freelance drifting but he wasn't by himself his sister was watching she was on their own look hardly sometimes you may feel like you're by yourself but god got somebody you ain't even expecting watching over you you don't even see it most didn't even know his sister was watching but she was watching over him hallelujah and she followed the basket all the way down look where the basket went the basket went in the hands of the enemy sometimes god will allow you to go into the hands of the enemy but it's his plan because you look church now pharaoh's daughter she knew all about the degree see look pressure holly situations brought out the real her what was her pressure she wanted a baby but had no man to have one so when she saw moses moses came drifting after she then took a bath and her hands made there now here comes a basket and they open it up and they say oh it's one of the hebrews and you know the hands may probably pull out their sword we gonna kill it it's a male you heard what pharaoh say let's drown it let's kill it you say stop wait don't do nothing why the bible says she had compassion god knows what he's doing he knows how to unlock the mystery of the believer when it looked like moses light was over god put him in a place of compassion you know what you ought to start doing for those of you who got bills and stuff you can't pay and you asking people you say hey um you know can y'all help me do this have mercy on when you send that bill off write a scripture on the envelope [Music] you know if they see it they're gonna have to go back and read it hallelujah so what i do is i write scriptures like oh no man nothing [Applause] greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i just sent some stuff off and i said and i put psalms 1 112 and i think five on it hallelujah that god will give you favor with me [Music] hallelujah church we have to operate in who we are and you look now this pressure this pressure made joseph and amram give up the child now moses is floating down hello miriam is watching the whole situation the baby goes down into the hands of the enemy the enemy has compassion and then miriam comes out and says hey do you want me to get someone to nurse the baby she had to say yes because pharaoh's daughter was not with child so she couldn't feed the baby she got something but she couldn't take care of it she got something but she couldn't bless it so she had to get somebody else to put a blessing on it don't you let god give you something and you can't bless it god didn't give you a saturday night service and you ain't gonna bless it [Applause] you ought to be giving god praise church now the baby comes down hallelujah the enemy has the baby she has compassion miriam comes up and she says hey you want me to get one of the hebrew mothers to come nurse the baby she says yes my child yes my child go not even realizing that she's talking to his sister so all miracle dudes go back and say i'm going to get my mama let's get my mom god is in control god is in control when it looked like all was lost when they were put under so much pressure god was showing that he's still in control sometimes god will put you right in the midst of dirt to unlock you now look church he says you know you go to hebrews the bible says by faith moses refused to call be called the son of pharaoh's daughter why those people were nothing but good to him you ever thought about that let me back up a little bit let me back up joseph bear comes down she comes down and she comes to pharaoh she says hey yo she called the federal door and say um um the child told me that you needed someone to nurse the baby yes yes yes you nurse her and i will pay you sisters wouldn't you love to get paid for taking care of your child tell you about y'all mama would jump for joy if she get fifteen dollars for every time y'all asked for something jump for joy honey and you think about just just think about her just think about it boy jacob be like hey every time you ask for something god said okay i'm gonna pay you just do it i'm gonna pay you now joseph is getting paid to do what she automatically would have done hallelujah think about that our god is an awesome god what a wonderful god he is hallelujah so church we are not to be holding on to things of this world give it up and see what god will do all of them now she gives it up and now she's in a better situation look church not only is she getting paid but the whole living conditions have changed she's not raising moses in a tent or a cottage now she's raising her own child in the palace [Applause] it's crazy to me why people don't want to serve the lord he's never failed church now the same baby she put in the river holly it made the real her come out what did she do she began to trust and because she trust god let her raise that same child under better condition you know this time she ain't need her food stamp card [Music] everything was coming from the king church they were eating organic they were eating grass-fed plant-based this stuff they had no steroids in it they had no they were eating chipotle [Music] talk to me church now she was raising her son under a condition that she would have never been able to give him pressure began to unlock a mystery that she would never be able to pay god back for and we complaining about what we're going through god just trying to set you up [Music] lord set me up [Applause] set me up in a way lord lord i don't know what you're doing but set me up i just lost a lot of stuff but lord set me up [Applause] [Music] and one of my favorite proverbs that i like to say is the devil can't do nothing but what god allows if you ever get sick it's because you allowed it in your mind first are you ever going through something like boy i'm struggling that's because you accepted the struggle especially us as a black a black black folk black and brown people whatever you want to call it they get on my nerves bro how you doing what's going on boy i'm still in the struggle i'm like don't come don't don't talk that foolishness to me i ain't in no struggle my god is in control he said i'm the head and not the tail i'm blessed and not cursed holly i'm rich or not poor holier i'm saving that loss my eyes are open not blind i can hear i'm not death what kind of struggle are you talking about look now moses is been raised up in the palace and he's next in line to be king hello and while he's next in line to being king he had the best food the best teaching hallelujah the best training hallelujah moses was being built up to be the next pharaoh hallelujah but in that atmosphere hallelujah he began to feel a certain way all of a sudden the real moses started to come out his mystery the mystery of his seed began to be unlocked what happened he saw one of his brothers getting beat on how first of all how did he know that was one of his brothers when all he knew was the egyptians all his life [Music] they wasn't sitting at the same table they weren't having no fellowship when they saw moses they said oh king moses bowed down but some kind of way moses was connecting with them how the words of his mother well she was in the palace teaching him she said son i want you to remember there's something special about you there's not you're not you're not an egyptian you're a hebrew he brought it to my what what are you talking about all i know is this you know all i know is this you know this chipotle you know what are you talking about i've been drinking kombucha all my life [Applause] i'm good spring water fuji so moses we asked the question i began to think about this why was he connecting with something he knew nothing about how was he starting to connect with the slaves why was he starting to feel sorry for them what was happening let me read your scripture hallelujah in the in the in in the book of john chapter 15 he says now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you holy and even in ephesians 5 he said he's talking about god presenting his church he said that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word and you know church the more moses real mother josephine spoke and told him who he was what was she doing she was washing off all the dirt that was buried around that seed all right back to the seed now to take this and i have to plant it in dirt good dirt and if you want to be technical the best kind of dirt say what you want the richest dirt it's dark black fine dirt hey i'm just telling what scientists say look it up and you know what they say the blacker the bear the sweeter the jews hallelujah church look you can't take this and put it in red clay and think you're gonna get peaches it has to be a ground with something in it that can unlock you mean to tell me it's the dirt oh it's the dirt that starts the process you can't put this in some gravel no it has to be pure dirt anybody going through something dirt but i want you to realize something he said all right i failed this good dirt because you still here good dirt listen to what the scripture says the scripture says hallelujah a corrupt tree can't bring forth good fruit he says good tree can't bring forth evil fruit holly so if you do something wrong but you still here trying to make it right that means you are good fruit that means you're a good tree hallelujah because when you look at the scriptures say a righteous man fallen seven times but he gets back up but it says the unrighteous on the other or i forget how the scripture exactly says it but he says that person that falls he continues and runs to mischief so what makes that person righteous he gets back up when he falls down when he has dirt in his life he cleans himself up and he keeps on pushing now you look at what does the dirt do what does dirt represent trials in tribulation our trials and tribulations what does that dirt do hey this dirt it smothers the seed no sunlight no water nothing it smothers and suffocates the shell and what does it do it takes the shell through a process where it breaks loose dirt dirt causes all of my troubles to separate from me thank god for my trials count them more precious than gold try it in the fire [Applause] you know why some of y'all ain't shouting because you ain't been you think that's a trial not ain't no trial ain't no trial because you can call somebody and get a ride ain't no trial a trial is when no matter what you do you can't help the situation look at the mystery i'm i'm jumping around a little bit but i hope you catch it look at how god unlocked moses mystery moses is at the red sea he can't go forward he can't go neither east or west and he can't go south because hallelujah the demons are on his trail and now god is going to unlock a mystery in him that he didn't even know was there but first things first god has to elevate us hallelujah to think higher of ourselves than what we think moses he comes to god hallelujah look church let's backtrack moses now he he's beginning to become he's beginning to come uncontent with being in the palace [Music] for no reason he eating good he dressing good he got the fires of the finest why is this man becoming discontent right the real hymn is coming out he's looking down at the hebrews being whipped and being being being taken advantage of and he's becoming more and more angry till one day he comes out and he sees the egyptian doing what he always do think about it this wasn't the first time moses saw one of the one of the slaves being taken advantage of but this time hallelujah the dirt was gonna pull away this time the shell was pulling off and now the germ is gonna come out hallelujah churchill right there that moment he saw that egyptian taking advantage of the hebrew and moses with that a man what you doing he said oh king moses he's always this he's always dead and next thing look for you no more pop over done pop his neck you know he had military training look church look at god the man sends out a degree to kill all of the men because he heard about god had a deliverer and then he turns around and raised the deliverer the very one he wanted to kill was a very what he raised up [Music] there's no god like jehovah there's no god like jehovah [Applause] the wisdom of man is foolishness to god now if you told pharaoh that moses was the deliverer that he wanted to kill he would say couldn't be i raised him but the very one he raised was the very one that was going to take his kingdom down that's why god let some of us go to the world he let us go out and listen to rap music and do all the stuff because once we got saved now we're body guards hallelujah so now we tell our children we tell you young people some of these sisters that went out and did what they supposed to do they tell these young girls now hey girl listen to me see now she becomes your armor bearer she's watching over your life hallelujah the very thing that satan pulled the idea to do she's become his enemy now look church moses pops a neck moses goes on the run you know i like the movie the ten commandments i say this all the time you know and and i like the part where you know moses on the run and the king he's almost the the old pharaoh he's almost about to die and he's so sad and then a woman comes up i forget her name never titilla whoever she was she comes up and says the only thing can make him smile is only one name the name of moses that's the only one that will bring joy in his life the one he loves moses but now moses is on the run the real moses is coming out hallelujah moses is on the run he's on the back side of the desert why because there was a woman back there who had children inside of them hallelujah hooray but not only that why why was it uh uh why was she the one that most supposed to want to marry because there was something in her that could unlock a mystery to humble moses [Music] cause evidently he had a temple just pop somebody's neck so he had to meet a woman that could calm him down you know brother brother say she was just as feisty as he was right and by the time she got through with him the bible says there was never a man meek is moses she knew how to calm that man down she had the mystery of humility [Music] there's something in you that can get something out of your husband that nobody else can get and likewise hallelujah but you look church holy moses before he went down there he was big and bad he was talking all that talk and then he met his wife you know in one place in scripture moses forgot to circumcise one of the kids she circumcised it and took the flesh and threw it at him and said you're a bloody husband to me you know that probably most probably dropped his head the mystery is being unveiled and now he gets back to god holy before he gets there look he had to get into a place where he could get so broken and so quiet hallelujah well he would wonder about all his life he's not thinking about the palace none of that stuff no more the mystery has been unlocked he had to get to a place where he would he he would listen to where he could hear his name being called out of a bush [Music] god took him on the back side of the desert hurry up when nobody else was just to speak to him and then god calls his name moses moses moses moses and the bible says moses went to see what was going on he went over there and god tells him take off your shoes holy ground then god begins to give him his commission and now listen to moses moses began to say thanks to god now moses said oh god i i i i just i just can't tell where that come from he was a general he could talk he was smart and everything what happened that wife she broke him down to where he couldn't even talk no more now he didn't got back to god he ain't even confident no more she then stripped him what was it that was her purpose because not god can use them because he's thinking as himself as what he should have always thought of himself nothing and now he comes to god and he says lord i just can't talk and now god is going to elevate the whole situation god said shut up moses and moses thinking i can't do this i can't do that now listen god is always going to elevate us into his thoughts and then he tells moses moses saying lord i'm nothing i can't do this he's like moses you be god and let aaron be your prophet hallelujah that's what god does when he begins to unlock the mysteries of your life he puts you in a position that you will never saw yourself little church and all of that started with dirt all of that started with a trial and i moses he comes back and i was just fast forward he's at the red sea and god already knew what kind of fruit was inside of him see the only way i can get fruit out of this is to plant it this is no good in this condition can't get no nourishment out of this would you like to go home and tell to cook you cook you a batch of peach seeds cook meals in pcs honey i'm home tonight i want some seeds no good no nourishment don't taste good or nothing but if you let this go through the process and grow you can eat peaches all night long and those pieces will put the nourishment back in your body holy church you want nourishment in your church you got to produce some fruit because that's where the life is the life is inside your fruit hallelujah because once this grows honey and pushes our branches it pushes our fruit holly the tree is no good the leaves are no good the branches are no good what good is the tree until the fruit come oh brother i'm in the message what good is it with no fruit holy church now moses gets to the point the way he says he refused to be identified the people ain't never did no wrong to him now the mystery of who he is begins to come out don't get nervous don't body clothes the mystery of who he is begins to come out hallelujah and now he finds himself being identified with something that he can't explain what was it life was coming forward now church you take the sea you put it in dirt dirt smothers it hungry dirt starts to process it dries it out makes it rot and the shell drops away once that shell drops away then it begins to fill the heat see you don't feel the heat in the shell no it's still smothered around dirt ain't nothing coming forth hallelujah but it's the dirt that dries it out oh yeah it's the dirt that makes the shark pull away harley smothers it and then that shell drops off nobody else sees it dropping off either and once it drops off nobody even acts about it again stop worrying about the shock let them go do it let them go do whatever they do we looking for life hallelujah so once the shuck drops off now that seed it feels the presence of the sun where in the dirt see it takes a condition hallelujah to start the process of your mystery if we can go through the bible real quick church it took holiday not one death but two deaths not two deaths but three deaths here to get ruth in process it took death to get her mystery to start to unlock because it was as long as her husband was alive she was good as long as off her husband was alive she was good as long as the liberal leg was alive she was good but then when death came it started to change some stuff holy dirt it started to change some stuff but this death was good death you know i said good dirt this was good dirt holly because these death hallelujah it changed their lives hardly it offer often went back to where she was but ruth told naomi know wherever you go i'm going see now the real herd is coming out the mystery is being unlocked what's unlocking her tribulation i just lost my husband it's being unlocked where you go i go when you live i live your god my god when you die i die whatever you do i'm gonna do it she said my child i ain't got no more children in me and this is that blah blah blah ruth said i wanna hear it i ain't going nowhere see the mystery was now in full place and now she began to go back home following naomi hey man and the mystery of who she was it began to be unlocked where did boaz see her in the vineyard around all the other life [Laughter] in the place where sea dwells he saw it down there and he said whose damn soul is this church and he didn't stop until she was in his house [Music] we know it's the same day with god god ain't gonna stop until we in the palace cause remember it has to be good dirt because they some fell by the wayside that was dirt some fell on stone the ground that was dirt you know and and on and on and then they say well some that fell on good ground and they brought 460 and 200 fold hardly see it all was dirt but what kind of dirt so you see something happening to me you can't explain don't worry about this good dirt because i ain't going nowhere and look church just to illustrate now let me read you something right quick everybody all right listen let's talk about a c for a minute listen i was looking up something that says a seed will not be unlocked with one watering when i go out with the church winston one watering ain't gonna do it i went last year before the pandemic that ain't gonna do it one watering ain't gonna do it see listen let me keep reading listen he said if it were it would risk coming to life in an area much to drive for survival that's why god didn't let the real you come out in a pentecostal church or let the real you come out of the baptist or catholic church the atmosphere was too dry they couldn't keep pouring on the seeds so it can grow so that way god didn't let you come into your full potential until you came into truth because once you came into truth you could get gus shout out to gusher gushing out the gusher experience has experienced true experience but listen he said it would it would risk coming to life in an area much to drive for survival it needs to know that the water supply is adequate to support it hallelujah he said until it can send its roots down to deep layers where it's almost likely more moisture what happens to a sea or tree when it's under strong winds when it's under strong winds the roots go deeper the trial of that tree crosses causes it to grow deeper the more it blows the more it bends the deeper those roots go so it needs that kind of wind it needs why you thinking palm trees cuz i'm roof real deep real deep what's holding it it's the trial of the winds every year there's some trees out here in florida that won't survive in arizona because of the climate those take those say take these same palm trees put them in the desert they'll die but take these same palm trees put them in a hurricane and it'll live [Applause] i wasn't born to be in the desert i was born to be the hurricane [Applause] hallelujah i'm a hurricane tree my food come forth in the midst of a hurricane come on somebody i remember i came down here i think it was 2007 and hurricane dennis was down here and we were doing the first meeting or whatever and hurricane dean's in miami holly and the wheels of blow they were so strong we was going by the west coast everybody sure were like and i was saying we said we going to church we going to church and check them smiling everybody's turning around like ain't nothing going on people going to get the cash i'm like they don't feel these wheels see it wasn't none for them they were born in these conditions [Applause] they were born in these conditions they were put down here to survive oh they've been through hurricane have a hurricane have a hurricane so you say come on dennis we will survive but these snowbirds come down here oh my god i'm going back to new york why because they're being grafted in they wasn't born here [Applause] and the only way you're gonna survive living this message of the hour is if you born into it you can't be grafted in in church i kid you not i'm looking around like these people crazy there's a hurricane out here they told my day going to church and when i'm i'm kidding that's how hard the wind is blowing and we went in church and i had to preach tonight and i could just feel the fear i see people acting like they're good but i say but they scared and when i didn't board up housing and some of y'all got boy y'all like y'all like home depot y'all can board up a house like it ain't nothing put me out here my house will be flooded why because i wasn't born in these conditions holly but because you are here and you've gotten accustomed to it you know how to overcome it hallelujah so church you know we did we got out i got up and preaching i said you know what the devil is trying to stop this meeting trying to make us afraid at least he was trying to make me afraid so we prayed hallelujah we prayed against the storm you know what it left miami and went up the other side and we had church the rest of the weekend but see sometimes adversity brings out who you are trials and tribulation brings out the real you it took hallelujah it took an atmosphere of prostitution for for for um rahab to be in position to receive the spies listen to this i think i'm gonna shake your boots if she wasn't a prostitute she would have never been in position [Music] remember remember remember this good dirt she was good dirt even though she was she had a life of prostitution she was good dirt because through her came jesus christ through her came boaz to marry a roof then came jesse obed did came david there came jesus holy so that prostitute had to be in position so every other seed that was on that tree when it was this high can come forth remember the proper guard say every bushel that's in this right now when the tree gets this big it's already in it thousands and thousands and thousands of peaches is already in it listen it says germination begins when water penetrates the seed coat and initiates chemical change within the tissues inside listen to this once begun these changes can't be reversed if you ever come in contact with god it doesn't matter what kind of trial you go through it can't be reversed if he ever takes you behind the veil and reveals his mystery to you he can't give you back ask jacob about it he got a woman that he didn't want but she went in the chamber once she got in the chambers he was hers because she knew his secrets she knew all the mysteries about jacob hallelujah so jacob couldn't have a woman out there walking around knew everything his wife knew so he had to wife her up hallelujah all right all right he had to because she'd be walking around and say i know what y'all yeah i know girl i've been in that chamber he couldn't have somebody out there like that so he had to keep her that's why he couldn't give her back so he said you know what i'm gonna do i still got more dirt in my life so i'm gonna work seven more years let me close this up he said it can't be reversed water supply stops and the purpose until it continues the seed dies hardly so church once god ever deals with you if he ever deals with you gets you in a place where that shock breaks off and life starts to come out the ground it's over can't get a man in the body it don't matter what they do in this world it's over i ain't going nowhere they ain't got the problem you got to prove you got to show me some special quote about the prophet said is the problem i'm convinced you ain't got to take me to a mountain you ain't got to take me to a cave you ain't got to take me to indiana i'm convinced you say what makes you convinced by what he did in my life it ain't the life of the prophet that keeps me steadfast no it's what god did in me [Applause] i knew what i was i know what i used to be i know where i used to go there's been a change in me and you can say what you want to say about the prophet but i know what god did in my life and i know what listening to the opening of this word has done in me so you can go back and say you know they never found this and they ain't none of my business ain't none of my business you know when i be in the gym working out and you know coach be teaching you know cause sometimes it ain't about just working it's about the technique you can't do the technique right the exercise ain't no good you know sometimes people being there cheating they sell and they think boy i'm tired i'm tired man you might want to go home because you ain't getting nothing out of this workout you ain't doing the technique right in church when it comes to who we are in god sometimes it's the technique you know when it comes to all these different things and all this people listen people that i got to prove those finest about the bible and all this stuff all this nonsense church you got to know where you stand if you can't look look you want to know how to witness the message tell somebody what god did in you when you came into this truth tell what god did in your life that's the that's the message of the hour a living written a pistol but you know i'm to a place now you know like i said i'd be in the gym people doing stuff wrong i just tell you says as i say cup i'm mind my business and once i say that you look around you know somebody ain't doing something right [Music] and they know i'm snitching so when it's my turn you know what they do they shout out my words i mind my business because they know it works church we got something that works hallelujah and if we just stick with the pattern life will come forward hey don't get so bogged down with dirt you got to have dirt all of us everybody need dirt all of us i might deal with this tomorrow but you understand people got dirt in their lives while they're filled with the holy ghost but that doesn't change the life of the seed because you put it in dirt but the life doesn't change hallelujah look filled with the holy ghost the prophet lied huh come on somebody chipping out the back door i ain't here with the holy ghost seeing visions having prayer lines being vindicated and got a lying spirit on but you know what that was good dirt that's all right i ain't telling you it's okay to lie but what i'm telling you god uses dirt to bring out things in your life so you can continue to grow and then once god dealt with that hallelujah let me let me leave that alone but church this is no good until it's planted it grows and it comes back to this again you understand what i'm saying and the only way this i can get this again is if i eat the fruit because i never get the seed after i plant it after i plant it it's done the only way i can get this life again is if i eat the fruit and the only way we will get the things that we've been studying in malachi 4's message the message of jesus christ is if we eat the fruit if we eat the word hallelujah because he said drink in and what push out drink it and push out but the thing of it is church and ain't just drinking to push out you got to drink in more than what you need because you don't drink anymore than what you need that's just enough to keep you growing and what good is a tree if it ain't pushing out no fruit i'll give you a prime example you know i hadn't told the story before but you know we we get so upset you know i'm almost about to close don't get nervous we get so upset when people talk about us they say things and this and that you know what i mean sometimes church it's good not to give people explanation let them make up their own story let them let them just just tell you on the move let them do whatever they want let them make up their own stuff as long as you know who you are logan you know who your god is but we're too busy trying to look a certain way in the eyes of the people forget all that stuff long as you're good with god but you know i always tell a story it was a it's a young boy they're encouraged to be a preacher he's going to church musician y'all can come he was going to church and you know all the young people you know how they do when you young it's like boy you going to be a preacher when you grow up boy when you grow up you're going to be a preacher you know that's how they do they put that in the little kid's head and he be coming to tell you like damn your father you know how you're preaching you know he keeps doing it and keep doing it he become one where he grow grow a little bit didn't begin to handle the word you know he started turning into a little preacher you know and then if it's a real gift there it started to come out hardly and if it's a real gift there he ain't gonna spare the feelings of the people and then that's when you see if they really want to be a preacher or not because the story of this young man when he became a preacher he stayed right with the word so all those that recruited him when they were doing wrong he blasted them and then they started tearing them down ah boy you ain't called and you ain't dissing how this is that blah blah blah he got so discouraged till he quit preaching he was throwing a little dirt on dirt ain't supposed to make you quit dirt is supposed to make you grow y'all need to parallel that your trials are to make you grow not to make you quit look church abraham hallelujah had a lying spirit in him but god had to put him under pressure so that lie can come out and then once it came out god dealt with him and abimelech in the whole country and you never heard of abraham line again [Music] church the young man now all the people that supported him now they hating on him so he goes to the bishop bishop you know all these people that pray for me to be a preacher now they all turn their back on me all the people who cheer for me now they hate to see me coming because they say i'm too saved now you ever heard that one he too said you know church and then the preacher's bishop said come here son look out this window he said what you see he said i see two trees say what kind of tree you see he said oak tree and a pecan tree he said yeah but what do you see he said what's under that oak tree he said nothing he said what's under that pecan tree he's a sticks rocks bottles shoes everything he said you know why all that stuff is under the pecan tree and not under the not under the oak tree he said because the oak tree ain't got nothing nobody wants so they don't throw at it he said but that pecan tree got a lot of stuff people want so they throw at it if somebody's throwing at you is because you got something they want if it ain't none of your tree nobody don't want that if ain't nobody jealous ain't nobody talking about you ain't nobody saying that you ain't got no fruit that nobody wants but if you got fruit somebody won't they got to throw at it they got to shake the tree they got to do something because they hungry [Music] y'all know you know i remember you told that story about the mango say all your whole family watching that mango everybody looking at it can't wait till it drops and then somebody snuck everybody why because everybody in the house knew what that fruit tastes like and if we come to church with the taste of jesus christ in our systems what would it be what would it be church i'm closing but there's a mystery in all of our lives but god uses trials and tribulations to bring it out and like i said the last time i was here god used this covert to bless people with no jobs holly to show you the power of paying tithes you know like my parents say hey if you don't pay your tithe you say he just be flat we say you'll pay your tithes you curse you gotta curse on you cause all the bible said if you do you bless you don't you curse and people like oh oh lord bless me bless me how are you gonna bless you and curse you at the same time it's either all you know there ain't nothing to wrestle with you know how i'm telling my children i tell people this all the time you know every time i oh lord that's too much this isn't that you got a thousand dollars ten percent of that is what hundred hundred dollars you got a thousand man up two hours you care about jack loves the hundreds a hundred dollars and i'm gonna say this like i always say and i ain't talking about it personally if god bless you with a thousand and your your 10 percent is 100 and you crying about a hundred fool you got 900 in your pocket let's elevate it he bless you with ten thousand and you yo yo yo yo yo tide is a thousand and you crying about ah i can't get out of that fool you got nine 000 in your

[Applause] he told the lord he said lord you bless me with this deal the next minister come through i'm a blessing with this top 10 percent i think about that he blessed the brother 10 his 10 percent was 350 000 so think about what he made church listen i ain't talking about what happened in the nomination i'm talking about what happened in our ranks people that believe what we believe let me

same insight to look at our lives lord to look at all the things we go through and to be able to say lord it was you all alone and lord we have to give you the credit because if we don't we'll put the
