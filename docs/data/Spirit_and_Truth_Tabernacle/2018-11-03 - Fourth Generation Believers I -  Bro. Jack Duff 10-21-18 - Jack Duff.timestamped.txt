[58:40] - two things you feel the presence of
[58:46] God
[58:46] Joseph - the presence of the enemy is
[58:50] always at work trying to do something
[58:53] how many know this one we already had
[58:55] the big time
[59:06] and when you know that you already have
[59:09] a big dream there's a posture cut health
[59:14] it's a certain posture that you could
[59:16] take
[59:18] that's the posture of a man not worrying
[59:24] and not Freddie just going about it
[59:28] doing what you just normally do because
[59:31] you know the devil can't stop here I'm
[59:38] reminded of a story in the script it was
[59:45] [Music]
[59:46] the profit I mean a bleep was Elijah a
[59:49] man and Ganassi might be a large and
[59:54] gauzy I can't can't remember right now
[59:56] but I remember them the army was coming
[1:00:00] to get this elijah army was coming
[1:00:02] against them and gauzy saw this great
[1:00:05] army out there they said my God my God
[1:00:08] my God man we are in trouble
[1:00:11] and but Elijah just kind of sit there he
[1:00:13] just kept doing this normal thing and
[1:00:16] you know he just wasn't worried about
[1:00:17] nothing and you know sometimes the bills
[1:00:20] are best piling up and piling up and you
[1:00:22] go home be and they don't even deliver
[1:00:24] mail on Sunday but you got one of them
[1:00:25] something but they like to say you know
[1:00:37] what uh you know I'm gonna drink my
[1:00:38] coffee I'm gonna eat my toast something
[1:00:40] this act like it just inhaled all day
[1:00:43] and I can see the hotter than what in
[1:00:45] the world is wrong with you man how
[1:00:46] could you act the way that you act in
[1:00:49] the midst of this great trial to
[1:00:50] Gentiles and he said Lord just open this
[1:00:57] young man's eyes help him to see what I
[1:01:00] see and went by and finally when the
[1:01:03] garage he got his eyes open he can see
[1:01:05] the the cherry is just on the
[1:01:07] mountaintop says hey man he say not now
[1:01:10] it's Brill with us then we're very and
[1:01:16] reminded me the song it may look like
[1:01:19] I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by you
[1:01:25] it may look like I'm surrounded
[1:01:30] but I'm surrounded by you come on that's
[1:01:33] all it says it may look like I'm
[1:01:36] surrounded
[1:01:38] but I'm surrounded by you they were like
[1:01:44] I'm surrounded but I'm sure
[1:01:49] by you that's all it says but I want you
[1:01:52] to put me in favor I want you to grab
[1:01:55] your Bibles
[1:02:01] you know when Satan came to Jesus and
[1:02:04] offered him history while attacks
[1:02:09] the prophets honest said all Jesus did
[1:02:11] was just use the word of God to fight
[1:02:13] the devil
[1:02:16] he just kept telling to that what it is
[1:02:17] rape
[1:02:20] it is written
[1:02:22] it is written hallelujah 6a pitches time

[1:35:48] the channel where he did hear what was
[1:35:51] going on around him right he just was
[1:35:53] really time into what God was doing and
[1:35:56] and and you have to be able to get into
[1:35:58] the channel some time like you know I
[1:35:59] can't hear anything that's just I'm not
[1:36:02] listening to it but I'm focusing on what
[1:36:04] the Spirit of God is trying to say that
[1:36:06] has mental even right now and then that
[1:36:08] scripture oh it should mean something
[1:36:09] everybody love not the world nor the

[1:40:01] we thank you for the ability to read but
[1:40:03] we know it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:04] bring clarity to what we've read speaks
[1:40:06] our heart Scott through your word today
[1:40:08] since Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:40:12] bless you you can be seen it once again
[1:40:14] and we take every spirit that's against
[1:40:17] the Spirit of God underneath the control
[1:40:19] of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:21] even right now a man I want to just take
[1:40:26] for our subjected a fourth-generation
[1:40:27] believers a man I've mentioned to all a
[1:40:31] few weeks ago that I wanted to talk on
[1:40:33] this subject and and I want to just kind
[1:40:35] of hit this a man if I can today let me
[1:40:38] start off by a man just making a couple
[1:40:42] of statements and the first quote that
[1:40:44] I'm going to read a man is God
[1:40:48] commissioning Moses and then that he
[1:40:51] swore by himself and this in this
[1:40:53] message God commissioning Moses the
[1:40:55] Prophet says I heard a fellow saying the
[1:40:58] other day that sickness the Lord did
[1:41:01] sickness he says put sickness on you
[1:41:04] that might be so if you were sinning
[1:41:08] okay so the Lord might allow sickness to
[1:41:11] come upon you if you're sinning a man
[1:41:15] you've done something wrong make it
[1:41:17] right with God
[1:41:18] that's right that's true but sickness is
[1:41:21] of the devil a man that sickness is an
[1:41:25] attribute of sin because of sin we had
[1:41:29] sickness not because maybe you sinned
[1:41:32] but but but it's something that come
[1:41:35] down through the generations I want you
[1:41:39] to catch that a man you can actually be
[1:41:41] going through a sickness you all
[1:41:42] remember the story of Jesus a man and
[1:41:45] the man that was blind and how Jesus I
[1:41:48] was approached by the disciples said now
[1:41:49] now is it because this man sinner
[1:41:52] because it's very searing rise demanded
[1:41:55] conditions and what evidently they were
[1:41:57] saying it's not normal for us to be sick
[1:42:00] right it's not it's not something that
[1:42:03] we should just accept and then innocent
[1:42:05] devil that's attacking us
[1:42:07] so why is the message in say everyone
[1:42:09] because it was its parents it wasn't
[1:42:11] because of anything he did but it's
[1:42:13] because the glory of God wanted to be
[1:42:15] expressed right so so sometimes things
[1:42:17] happen and God just wants to show us
[1:42:19] glory but sometimes it happened it's
[1:42:21] because of a scene right all right now
[1:42:24] look at this says not because maybe you
[1:42:26] sinned but but it's something that come
[1:42:28] down through the generations he visited
[1:42:30] even the third and fourth generation but
[1:42:33] the blood of Jesus Christ taken away sin
[1:42:35] and it'll take away sickness I like that
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] we that meets with that statement we
[1:42:41] don't have to accept things just because
[1:42:44] they come down through generations
[1:42:46] man amen you know sometimes it's a it's
[1:42:49] a generational curse no the devil is
[1:42:51] alive amen I'm not accepting it
[1:42:54] hallelujah just because it pass to my
[1:42:57] family in the past right on by me
[1:42:59] because I'm underneath the blood of the
[1:43:01] Lord cheese right right the death date
[1:43:04] rapid passed by them that were
[1:43:06] underneath the blood and if you are
[1:43:07] under the blood today that death things
[1:43:09] you have to pay right back you don't
[1:43:12] accept it when you know there's nothing
[1:43:14] wrong in your life listen the Bible
[1:43:17] actually says this stuff going on I'm
[1:43:19] gonna stop there amen
[1:43:21] the Bible says in Exodus 20 and verse 5
[1:43:23] it made a statement says thou shall not
[1:43:26] bow down thyself to them nor serve them
[1:43:29] for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God
[1:43:32] visiting the iniquity of the father's
[1:43:34] upon the children unto the third and
[1:43:36] fourth generation of them that hate me
[1:43:39] now I want you to I want you to just
[1:43:41] kind of catch this because you know as
[1:43:45] brother branham just said in that quote
[1:43:46] you know sometimes things do get passed
[1:43:48] down from generation I want you to kind
[1:43:50] of catch this each one of us here have
[1:43:54] the have the ability to make decisions
[1:43:57] that will impact future generations
[1:44:02] things that you do right now will
[1:44:05] actually impact future generations
[1:44:08] hallelujah Amana I want you to just
[1:44:10] think about that Oh glory to God you
[1:44:13] know sometimes there are certain things
[1:44:14] that hit a particular family a man and
[1:44:17] you wonder why everybody everybody did
[1:44:19] that where everybody went that way you
[1:44:22] know I can I can just talk about my
[1:44:24] whole family a matter how I went back
[1:44:26] and just kind of you know sometimes you
[1:44:27] start talking to you and you start
[1:44:28] getting different things different
[1:44:30] pieces you start putting together and
[1:44:32] come to find out that all in my family
[1:44:35] line there was a lot of men that come
[1:44:37] before me that were womanizers a man
[1:44:40] they went from one woman to the next
[1:44:42] woman to the next woman and you weren't
[1:44:44] you to wonder why is that well you know
[1:44:46] why was that happened or why does this
[1:44:47] get the same spirit on him it came down
[1:44:49] from his daddy from his granddaddy from
[1:44:52] his great granddaddy and you start
[1:44:54] wondering what what is it that what is
[1:44:55] it that that breaks that well I got good
[1:44:57] news way hey man the power of the Holy
[1:45:01] Ghost can break that right and in action
[1:45:06] and power Holy Ghost take that excuse
[1:45:07] from yes the powder Holy Ghost actually
[1:45:10] called you to be different than what
[1:45:12] they are see that was something natural
[1:45:14] that came down a man from a natural
[1:45:16] father but to have my Heavenly Father
[1:45:18] who has something spiritual to break
[1:45:22] down to you hallelujah
[1:45:25] you know sometimes in families like you
[1:45:28] could have from a woman's perspective
[1:45:30] hey baby you might have in the family
[1:45:32] maybe a woman that get pregnant out of
[1:45:35] wedlock right and then just this
[1:45:37] happened in this with this happen and
[1:45:38] that wouldn't happen to do but I tell
[1:45:40] you what when you get underneath the
[1:45:41] power of the Holy Ghost let us stop that
[1:45:44] thing from happening in your generation
[1:45:47] oh come on somebody see we have the
[1:45:50] opportunity amen in this present time to
[1:45:54] make decisions that will impact the
[1:45:56] future hallelujah
[1:45:58] that's why I read the scripture this is
[1:46:00] the generation that seeks I'm not
[1:46:04] accepting what came down in my
[1:46:06] I'm gonna accept what came down from
[1:46:08] heaven that's what breaks that
[1:46:12] generational curse come on somebody
[1:46:17] let me just read something here to you
[1:46:18] this is not a he swore box of watch this
[1:46:21] the Prophet says well what what is the
[1:46:24] head of all what is the head of all this
[1:46:26] cause that we're here this morning says
[1:46:29] what's the the head of all of it what
[1:46:31] made all this sickness is sin and
[1:46:33] disgrace it was sin see before you had
[1:46:37] in the sin sickness is an attribute of
[1:46:39] something that that follows sin if you
[1:46:42] don't have in other words it's something
[1:46:44] that come out of sin see before there
[1:46:47] was any sin there was no sickness or
[1:46:50] nothing no worry no nothing no old age
[1:46:53] no breaking down no heartaches no broken
[1:46:56] homes
[1:46:57] no nothing see it was just perfect well
[1:47:00] what caused it was sin yes I in whether
[1:47:04] their sickness false in broken homes
[1:47:06] attributes come or Olympics and all
[1:47:08] those things followed sin now if your
[1:47:12] kills
[1:47:12] if you kill sin yes I like that
[1:47:16] if you kill see right you've got to kill
[1:47:21] the attributes hallelujah if sin is gone
[1:47:24] then you watch to these other things
[1:47:26] being managed right but if you start
[1:47:28] seeing all those other things that you
[1:47:30] have not died to that old sin nature
[1:47:32] that's why you need to be born again
[1:47:35] that's why you need the baptism Holy
[1:47:38] Ghost that's what gives you power to
[1:47:40] overcome let's see in nature yes sir
[1:47:43] listen he goes on to say that she says
[1:47:45] says if you kill sin you gotta kill the
[1:47:48] attributes haven't you you can't touch
[1:47:50] you can't fool with sin unless you're
[1:47:53] fooling with this and when you fool in
[1:47:55] this it results in sin see now if you
[1:47:58] kill sin then you kill the whole thing
[1:48:01] yes sir
[1:48:01] now you say sickness sometimes you may
[1:48:04] have sick you say did I see him
[1:48:05] oh might not have been you sin but you
[1:48:08] remember the sicknesses visit that nick
[1:48:11] words are the
[1:48:12] upon the children and the children's
[1:48:14] children and their children all to the
[1:48:16] third and fourth generation now I'm
[1:48:18] lying on all this stuff because you know
[1:48:21] there are things that are happening in
[1:48:23] the fourth generation but the fourth
[1:48:25] generation needs to understand that some
[1:48:28] of it started in generations before you
[1:48:31] you just feeling the impact
[1:48:35] right on what happened years ago yes
[1:48:37] things that you might not even know

[1:49:39] fruition nobody I mean they was trying
[1:49:41] to keep this thing down right to the
[1:49:44] people went to the Greek right right but
[1:49:46] they don't realize that to me yes that's
[1:49:50] it blocks God removing in that Pam
[1:49:53] that steam action will eventually fete
[1:49:56] effect children tears tears down the
[1:49:58] road you thought you did it the nice
[1:50:03] nice in this problem rise up a men in
[1:50:06] this family wonder what happened here
[1:50:07] they don't realize they act to fulfill
[1:50:10] it what what happened in generations
[1:50:12] before them yes understand you know all
[1:50:18] hell has been loose to get y'all right
[1:50:20] but it's not it's not I mean look ya'll
[1:50:23] just get started in this thing all right
[1:50:25] but these things that happened before

[1:50:29] Amen if these things happen before you
[1:50:31] got here what its gonna take
[1:50:34] it's not you going back to try to dig up
[1:50:36] everybody's past that's not what's gonna
[1:50:40] help you overcome you sure I need to
[1:50:42] know why my granddaddy I need to know
[1:50:45] why my grandma only the Holy Ghost if no
[1:50:57] granddaddy had the Holy Ghost and the
[1:50:59] did what he did it's no grandma had the
[1:51:03] Holy Ghost she did what she did but she
[1:51:07] didn't have the opportunity to hear the
[1:51:09] truth that Junia
[1:51:12] so all you got to do the Brit - it's a
[1:51:17] Polish work and when you receive it
[1:51:28] guess what the generations after you
[1:51:30] will be impacted positive good preacher
[1:51:40] sometimes you don't realize what you're
[1:51:42] facing but the lead
[1:51:45] inhale was taken off that's right that's
[1:51:48] right and all hail does come against
[1:51:50] yeah that's right that's right
[1:51:52] oh yeah let's come again yes brother
[1:51:56] branham tells us that when all hell
[1:51:58] breaks loose how about that we should
[1:52:01] also be watching ball heaven let me go
[1:52:09] on a little further in this quote I want
[1:52:10] you to see this might not have been you
[1:52:16] said in CC I have to put it this way
[1:52:18] because now I'm talking fourth
[1:52:20] generation believers yeah but I'm taking
[1:52:22] it only from a certain point yes come on
[1:52:25] you understand I'm only taking it from a
[1:52:27] certain point because everybody in here
[1:52:30] is in a racial from somebody
[1:52:33] right I'm fourth generation I can go
[1:52:37] back in my from my natural father and
[1:52:42] his father and his grandfather and
[1:52:44] hearing about all these you know these
[1:52:45] these things woman I said man right you
[1:52:48] know great granddaddy you know run
[1:52:50] around he spoke be a doctor to town
[1:52:52] where at times you a doctor right you
[1:52:56] you got a position oppressed each sorry
[1:52:58] to possess the prestige you can do all
[1:53:00] kind of stuff you know this doctor set
[1:53:11] him up brought him to the audition
[1:53:13] you know and it's it the nurse on room
[1:53:15] uh-huh but brothers and offices cetera
[1:53:18] he's using his position of power and
[1:53:20] influence to do something all right
[1:53:23] right Amen but by hearing here my family
[1:53:26] I'm seeing it I'm hearing about this
[1:53:27] doctor that's just going around he got
[1:53:28] kids from everybody but because he's a
[1:53:32] doctor
[1:53:32] he can do that kind of stuff right and
[1:53:35] yeah you wanna why that spirit a man
[1:53:38] just kind of keep coming in and
[1:53:39] attacking and just attacking not now
[1:53:42] can I say something even with the Holy
[1:53:44] Ghost right right come on right if even
[1:53:48] with the Holy Ghost
[1:53:49] hallelujah uh-huh Amen don't mean that
[1:53:52] the devil won't try you
[1:54:04] this way a greater reward for the Deaf
[1:54:14] is that actually get somebody in the
[1:54:17] phone that's got the Holy Ghost
[1:54:23] that's a greater prize for the tip when
[1:54:26] you actually go on the greater trials
[1:54:28] when you get the Holy Ghost but because
[1:54:32] God don't want to be outdone he allows
[1:54:40] the Holy Ghost to become your keeper so
[1:54:43] when the devil is trying your healing
[1:54:45] trying it out the devil Bobby I mean he
[1:54:47] never said yeah do this do that yet but
[1:54:49] God would be your know on the inside I
[1:54:53] know you better get out of this
[1:54:54] situation quick huh because God don't
[1:54:58] wanna keep you over to the devil like
[1:55:00] that also realize when you when you make
[1:55:03] the decision you say yes to it you are
[1:55:05] setting yourself up Amen for greater
[1:55:07] things in future generations in that
[1:55:13] fourth generation you won't live you
[1:55:15] won't be living the seal but the fourth
[1:55:19] generation that's coming from you what
[1:55:21] type of trouble where they have because
[1:55:23] of what you did
[1:55:28] you better bring it under the blood yeah
[1:55:30] can I just want to finish this point I'm
[1:55:32] trying let me let me let me get here let
[1:55:35] me get here all right
[1:55:37] it says how did I say no oh might not
[1:55:42] have been you said but you remember the

[2:12:15] gonna make them look like what will my
[2:12:19] love my wife when my wife's yep enough I
[2:12:21] thought if I make this decision but I'll
[2:12:22] do this I'll do that how is that gonna
[2:12:24] make my husband look here brother
[2:12:27] everybody
[2:12:34] see we gotta watch this this is this is
[2:12:36] very very important yeah alright so so
[2:12:38] so you know flapper is disturbed from
[2:12:40] the nineteen twenties now I don't know
[2:12:42] where chorus girl with I don't know when
[2:12:44] that came but I know that if the flapper
[2:12:46] was the first generation the choral
[2:12:49] chorus girl was the second generation
[2:12:51] and what brother I'm sorry when he
[2:12:54] called him say see you know your your
[2:12:56] mammy was a flat but grandmammy was a
[2:12:59] chorus girl
[2:13:00] I guess of course they're listening
[2:13:01] right okay chorus girl must have been
[2:13:04] first-generation flapper would have been
[2:13:06] second generation so that became in the
[2:13:08] 1920s Corsica chorus girl I don't know
[2:13:11] when they can mm-hmm but what I found
[2:13:14] out is that a chorus girl it's this one
[2:13:17] who is a woman who sings or dances in
[2:13:20] the course of a musical can I say that
[2:13:24] again
[2:13:25] a woman who sings or dances in the
[2:13:30] course of a musical come on let's see
[2:13:34] now we watched musicals and we see women
[2:13:37] dancing and we don't think nothing of it
[2:13:39] today it don't move us like that but a
[2:13:43] hundred years ago that was me but now
[2:13:51] the fourth generation we since it's a
[2:13:55] desensitized to it just don't mean
[2:13:57] nothing and this is why I was saying you

[2:14:02] know what I'm gonna come home right in
[2:14:05] here just kind of bring something to

[2:14:42] right
[2:14:42] yes so far we even came to the message
