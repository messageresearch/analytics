[24:46] praise the lord god
[24:51] [Music]
[24:56] god bless you
[25:00] i'm excited this morning
[25:02] so
[25:03] i've been waiting to give this testimony
[25:05] for a long time so i'm very excited
[25:09] um
[25:10] i don't know how many of you have ever
[25:13] struggled with it like a food allergy
[25:16] but it's not fun
[25:19] for a long time i um i was having really
[25:22] bad headaches for years
[25:25] and my joints were very sore i was
[25:29] always very exhausted
[25:31] my sinuses would constantly hurt like
[25:34] very painful
[25:36] so i went to the doctor
[25:37] many many times
[25:39] with all of these different symptoms and
[25:42] every time i went they said oh well you
[25:44] know
[25:45] let's check how you're sleeping maybe
[25:47] you're not getting enough sleep let's
[25:49] check maybe you're allergic to something
[25:51] in the air so they did
[25:53] tons and tons of tests they could never
[25:56] find out what was wrong with me
[25:58] and because i was
[26:00] studying in college at the time i had
[26:02] access to research databases and i'm
[26:04] pretty good with research so
[26:06] i started researching on my own
[26:09] and i ended up
[26:10] finding out that i had i was allergic to
[26:12] wheat
[26:13] so anything i ate with gluten in it
[26:16] would trigger these symptoms that were
[26:18] happening in me so i stopped eating
[26:20] gluten all together for a couple of
[26:22] months and just to test my theory i
[26:25] had um two of the breadsticks from olive
[26:28] garden
[26:29] my whole body broke out in hives
[26:32] it was horrible and then i had all of
[26:34] those symptoms again and i was like okay
[26:36] i'm done i'm done with gluten i know
[26:38] what it is
[26:39] um but you know that was a really hard
[26:41] decision for me because
[26:43] i love bread
[26:44] i love pasta i love things that have
[26:47] gluten in them
[26:49] and so
[26:50] i was always cooking
[26:52] separately for my family and then for
[26:54] myself and i would have to eat like
[26:56] gluten-free bread and gluten-free pasta
[27:00] and those things just don't taste good
[27:02] they're disgusting
[27:04] so
[27:05] but i did it because the symptoms were
[27:07] horrible and i didn't want to have to
[27:09] deal with them
[27:11] um
[27:12] so
[27:13] let's see when was it i think about a
[27:15] year ago maybe a year ago
[27:18] we had um
[27:20] decided i said you know i'm going to um
[27:22] just i'm not i'm not going to accept
[27:24] this i'm going to just
[27:26] eat gluten all i want i'm healed in the
[27:28] name of jesus and
[27:30] well i did it
[27:31] and my whole body broke my eyes
[27:34] and all the symptoms came back and i was
[27:36] like well maybe my faith is not there
[27:38] yet or something
[27:40] so i stopped eating gluten again
[27:43] um and then we were going to the fair
[27:45] this year
[27:46] and i told josue i said
[27:49] i'm so sick of this like i can't have
[27:51] anything with gluten in it you guys get
[27:53] to go have all this yummy stuff and i
[27:55] can't have anything i have to eat like
[27:57] kettle corn popcorn
[27:59] the fair
[28:00] so um he was like
[28:03] just do it just just eat gluten just
[28:06] i was like oh
[28:08] remember what happened last time you
[28:10] know the same doubts in my mind
[28:13] but anyway we discussed it prayed about
[28:16] it in the car on the way there and i
[28:17] just made the decision i'm done with
[28:19] this
[28:19] i'm done with this and i've been craving
[28:21] like so many things that have gluten in
[28:23] them
[28:24] so the baby's telling me eat this eat
[28:26] this and i'm like i can't
[28:28] so
[28:29] if we ended up going
[28:31] i ate gluten and i didn't break out in
[28:34] hives
[28:35] i i i didn't have any headaches
[28:38] my sinuses were not hurting my joints
[28:41] were not hurting
[28:43] and then the next day i'm telling josue
[28:45] on the phone
[28:46] do you think it's like bad of me that
[28:49] i'm um over here like
[28:51] waiting to see
[28:53] like i'm gonna like break out and hide
[28:55] somewhere or is my head gonna start
[28:56] hurting or something he was like
[28:59] that's a devil don't don't listen to
[29:00] that he's like
[29:02] look just
[29:03] just go and then we we talked to brother
[29:05] jacket brother jack was like you know
[29:06] what if you even have a symptom show up
[29:09] just rebuke it i i send this back to
[29:12] satan i rebuke this in the name of jesus
[29:14] so i've been eating gluten every single
[29:16] day and i haven't been eating a little
[29:20] and that's probably not a good thing
[29:23] right now
[29:24] oh but i've been eating gluten every day
[29:27] actually i had it this morning for
[29:28] breakfast
[29:29] and i have had no hives
[29:32] no headaches no symptoms
[29:34] so
[29:37] i just thank god for that because that
[29:39] is a blessing i'm so very thankful that
[29:42] we have a healer and i just gave god all
[29:44] the glory for that
[29:52] hallelujah
[29:54] amen well ain't no gluten
[29:59] praise the lord amen god bless you
[30:01] sister amanda amen god is good
[30:06] praise the lord sister naomi and sister
[30:08] hadassah will you come

[55:40] typically my wednesdays are
[55:42] uh i have to go and pick up food for the
[55:44] pantry and and bring it in and
[55:47] restock the pantry
[55:49] it just so happened on that particular
[55:51] wednesday uh sisatina forgot to press
[55:54] submit for the order
[55:56] so i didn't have a pickup
[55:59] and uh it freed me up
[56:01] to actually go to the hospital
[56:03] and be there uh with uh sister wayson
[56:05] and and you know it's just you know just
[56:07] looking at just all the little things
[56:09] that god was doing
[56:11] uh all along the way and you know really
[56:13] i feel like last year amen when the
[56:16] churches were merging sister wasting
[56:17] took sick and
[56:19] and uh some of the things like please
[56:20] please pray for we just didn't know how
[56:22] things were going to be but we saw god
[56:25] touch her
[56:26] raise her up
[56:28] uh give us strength to be able to walk
[56:30] again and i remember her walking through
[56:32] the parking lot to get in church just
[56:34] for prayer that's when was doing that at
[56:36] seven o'clock in the morning and
[56:38] situation was running through the
[56:39] parking lot
[56:41] because barely barely barely you know

[56:45] running through the parking lot trying
[56:46] to get in there before seven o'clock hit
[56:48] the you know hit the dot there but i was
[56:51] just you know just so much that god god

[59:09] um let's uh let's read a scripture
[59:12] um
[59:14] and we

[59:19] in
[59:20] spirit and truth 2.0
[59:22] amen
[59:24] john 15.
[59:29] i had to take a second look josiah my
[59:31] god bro
[59:35] man you got me man
[59:38] well that's spirit and truth 2.0
[59:41] represent
[59:46] my lord hey hey hey that's all right
[59:49] brother that look nice glory
[59:51] [Laughter]
[59:54] glory glory glory amen amen
[59:58] um here in uh uh
[1:00:02] john
[1:00:03] 15 says i am
[1:00:05] the true vine and my father is a husband
[1:00:08] man
[1:00:10] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:00:12] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:00:15] that beareth fruit
[1:00:17] this is just this blesses me
[1:00:20] every branch that bears fruit
[1:00:22] he purgeth it
[1:00:24] so it means your life can be fruitful
[1:00:27] your ministry can be fruitful
[1:00:29] but it has to go through a purging
[1:00:31] process
[1:00:35] and and now there's a reason for the
[1:00:36] purging process the scripture actually
[1:00:38] gives you
[1:00:40] uh the answer why you go through
[1:00:42] purgings
[1:00:44] and it says
[1:00:45] that it may bring forth
[1:00:48] more fruit
[1:00:50] hallelujah
[1:00:52] amen so don't be afraid of the update
[1:00:54] now
[1:00:55] amen things get better after the update
[1:00:58] all right it says now ye are clean
[1:01:00] through the word
[1:01:02] uh i have spoken unto you abiding me and
[1:01:05] i am you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:01:07] of itself except it abide
[1:01:11] in the vine
[1:01:13] no more can ye accept ye abide in me
[1:01:17] i am the vine
[1:01:19] ye are the branches
[1:01:22] glory to god amen
[1:01:24] uh he that abideth in me and i in him
[1:01:28] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:01:30] without me
[1:01:32] you can do nothing
[1:01:34] oh yes
[1:01:36] and if a man abide not in me
[1:01:39] he is cast forth as a branch
[1:01:42] and is withered
[1:01:44] and men gather them
[1:01:46] and cast them into the fire
[1:01:49] and they are burned
[1:01:51] if you abide in me
[1:01:53] glory and my words abide in you
[1:01:57] ye shall ask what ye will
[1:02:00] and it shall be done
[1:02:01] uh unto you
[1:02:03] hey i believe that amen just turning
[1:02:07] back to uh john 4
[1:02:10] um and just picking up
[1:02:13] this woman at the well
[1:02:15] uh as you just see here plainly in
[1:02:19] scripture
[1:02:20] where the name of the church comes from
[1:02:23] amen and it's right here in scripture
[1:02:26] let's look at john 4
[1:02:28] 23 and 24.

[1:04:35] and uh lord we uh we could never do this
[1:04:38] without you had you not uh the scripture
[1:04:41] says if the lord don't build the house
[1:04:42] they that labor laboring in vain so we
[1:04:45] thank you for building this house and
[1:04:47] watching over this house and just
[1:04:48] keeping us lord throughout the years
[1:04:50] uh we uh lord we're just grateful for
[1:04:53] what we know that you have done this is
[1:04:55] not the work of a man but this is a work
[1:04:56] of almighty god and we appreciate you
[1:04:59] lord jesus we pray god that he would
[1:05:01] just hide us behind the cross may we not
[1:05:03] be seen but may christ be on display
[1:05:05] uh
[1:05:06] this morning in jesus name we pray amen
[1:05:10] i mean god bless you can be seated
[1:05:12] amen as we just continue our journey um
[1:05:16] last
[1:05:17] last time i spoke for you um i was
[1:05:20] we took this subject amen of spiritual
[1:05:23] 2.0 and as we mentioned this is
[1:05:26] a man really just to play on words uh
[1:05:29] when we're using 2.0
[1:05:32] um
[1:05:33] it represents 20 20 years a man of
[1:05:36] ministry uh that the lord has blessed us
[1:05:39] to be able to be a part of and
[1:05:42] and um and trusting that god will just
[1:05:44] continue to carry us forward
[1:05:46] in the years of hit in the years ahead
[1:05:48] and as i was just kind of sharing with
[1:05:50] you all there was roughly seven
[1:05:52] different occasions or several different
[1:05:54] things that happened in my life uh where
[1:05:56] i felt uh that the lord was calling me
[1:05:59] into ministry many of you all probably
[1:06:00] never heard my my testimony and i like
[1:06:02] to share it every once in a while
[1:06:04] because what i find out is that if you
[1:06:06] don't share your testimony people will
[1:06:08] give you one
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] praise the lord so sometimes you need to
[1:06:14] hear from
[1:06:15] amen the source
[1:06:17] and know what happened in their life
[1:06:20] amen until you can direct people back to
[1:06:22] tape and say go listen to it if you want
[1:06:24] to hear his testimony go listen to this
[1:06:26] particular tape
[1:06:28] and uh you know but we we thank the lord
[1:06:30] for what he has done amen and all these
[1:06:33] years but we were talking amen with this
[1:06:36] play on words uh 2.0 actually represents
[1:06:40] what we call an update
[1:06:42] amen and an update and uh we were using
[1:06:47] these uh these uh what i want to call
[1:06:50] uh technical terms in order to explain
[1:06:55] what an update and i use uh information
[1:06:58] from the web as well as i used brother
[1:07:00] quentin jr uh he's a solutions architect
[1:07:03] and he you know he has to do updates
[1:07:06] with software so there there's reasons
[1:07:08] for doing an update so that's what we're
[1:07:11] what we're focused on just to revisit
[1:07:12] that just a little bit
[1:07:14] amen an update uh is new
[1:07:17] improved
[1:07:19] or it fixes software it replaces
[1:07:22] older versions of the same software amen
[1:07:27] uh they say for an example
[1:07:29] updating your operating system brings it
[1:07:31] up to date with the latest drivers now
[1:07:33] when i preached this uh two weeks ago uh
[1:07:36] right after service man sister wayson

[1:07:51] process we'll press this and press that
[1:07:53] the reason the phone don't work the way

[1:09:48] god's word how does he require you to
[1:09:50] dress
[1:09:51] i can i can show you in the scripture as
[1:09:53] to why we do what we do if you if you
[1:09:55] want to read the scripture right and and
[1:09:57] it's not my rules these are god's rules
[1:10:00] but i just loved the way her heart was
[1:10:02] and how you know anytime the word was
[1:10:04] spoken she wanted to adapt she wanted to
[1:10:06] apply amen immediately
[1:10:09] i appreciate her spirit
[1:10:11] appreciate her spirit
[1:10:13] amen but but here you know this update
[1:10:17] amen uh is often provided by software
[1:10:20] publishers is free of charge amen
[1:10:23] they're trying to improve things they
[1:10:25] want to make sure your experience is
[1:10:26] good so they provide these things free
[1:10:28] of charge that's what an update does
[1:10:30] it's it's to is to improve it's uh it's
[1:10:33] it improves security it gives you a
[1:10:35] better experience it fixes bugs you know
[1:10:38] it does all these things security
[1:10:39] because people trying to steal
[1:10:41] information people trying to steal your
[1:10:44] credit card information right sometimes
[1:10:46] you go into an app or you go to a
[1:10:48] website and you put you know uh uh uh a
[1:10:50] thing you you put your
[1:10:52] your personal credit card information
[1:10:54] somebody trying to hack that
[1:10:56] right and next thing you know you got
[1:10:57] charges on your credit card and you
[1:10:59] wonder where they came from it was
[1:11:00] something stolen off of a website but
[1:11:02] this is why uh uh people when they're
[1:11:04] when they're developing these websites
[1:11:06] when developing applications they got to
[1:11:08] make sure it remains secure so that your
[1:11:11] information is not stolen
[1:11:13] glory to god amen uh the update is to
[1:11:16] provide you a better experience all
[1:11:20] altogether and like i told you a man a
[1:11:23] bug happens in a computer it's a flaw or
[1:11:26] a fault in the computer program that
[1:11:28] produces an incorrect or unexpected
[1:11:31] result amen and we don't want incorrect
[1:11:34] uh unexpected results glory to god it
[1:11:37] causes the computer to behave in
[1:11:40] unintended ways amen but an update to
[1:11:42] the computer can call can actually
[1:11:45] resolve the issue with that software
[1:11:48] glory to god now here you know they made
[1:11:50] a statement that uh typically the only
[1:11:53] time software or hardware stops updating
[1:11:56] is when the related company goes out of
[1:11:59] business
[1:12:00] and as long as the ministry is is is uh
[1:12:03] is still moving forward we're gonna
[1:12:05] constantly get
[1:12:06] updates hallelujah amen it shows that
[1:12:10] we're living shows that we're moving
[1:12:12] serves like something to happen we're
[1:12:13] constantly getting updates from the from

[1:12:18] this season that god has us in now i use
[1:12:20] a lot of computer terms amen when we're
[1:12:23] talking that but i want to try to bring
[1:12:25] it down into common terms amen uh when
[1:12:28] we talk about these updates and upgrades
[1:12:31] now you know there's a difference uh in
[1:12:34] an update versus an upgrade uh if you've
[1:12:38] um

[1:16:24] hallelujah how we thank god for that but
[1:16:26] you know there was a man
[1:16:29] in scripture
[1:16:31] that i want to just kind of read about
[1:16:32] here a little bit um
[1:16:35] this man needed a real update
[1:16:39] and what we what i also want to borrow
[1:16:41] the term from brother brother gwynna a
[1:16:43] system change
[1:16:46] amen this man went through some things
[1:16:48] in his life
[1:16:49] and and this is why god you know he
[1:16:51] allows us to go through certain things
[1:16:52] in our life
[1:16:53] uh to show that we need an update
[1:16:57] oh don't be satisfied with the
[1:16:59] experience you had 20 years ago
[1:17:02] don't be satisfied with the experience
[1:17:04] you had five years ago you ought to seek
[1:17:06] god for a fresh experience every time
[1:17:09] you come into his presence amen but but
[1:17:12] this man began to go through some
[1:17:14] changes in his life and uh and god had
[1:17:17] to humble him glory glory glory amen god
[1:17:21] had the humblest man because he you know
[1:17:23] as as we were just reading in the
[1:17:24] scripture amen jesus said i am the vine
[1:17:28] you are the branches and what happens
[1:17:31] sometimes we think we're the vine
[1:17:34] no no christ is divine and we are the
[1:17:37] branches
[1:17:38] hallelujah and we're only supposed to
[1:17:40] bear the life amen or express the fruits
[1:17:43] that are actually in the life of the
[1:17:44] vine
[1:17:46] glory to god amen if you're not bearing
[1:17:49] those fruits and there's something wrong
[1:17:51] so so here you know we find this man uh
[1:17:54] in scripture
[1:17:55] that needed an update he needed a system
[1:17:59] change
[1:18:00] a man he was humbled uh after seven
[1:18:03] years of living like an animal his name
[1:18:06] was nebuchadnezzar amen the man uh got
[1:18:09] to a point where he he got uplifted in
[1:18:12] his spirit
[1:18:13] my god he thought that it was all about
[1:18:16] him amen but god had to take him through
[1:18:19] a process where he stripped him of
[1:18:21] himself
[1:18:22] amen and then he could just kind of
[1:18:24] restore some code on top of this man in
[1:18:27] his heart your heart needs his code
[1:18:29] change
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:32] glory to god god god has to take your
[1:18:35] your heart through a code change
[1:18:37] glory to god because you know often
[1:18:39] times amen we we get to a point where we
[1:18:42] think it's all about us and and i want
[1:18:43] to say this as we celebrate this 20
[1:18:46] years i want to give god all the glory
[1:18:48] and all the praise i never want to think
[1:18:50] that this was about brother jack
[1:18:52] amen this has been all god
[1:18:56] but here you know we pick up
[1:18:58] nebuchadnezzar we never want to get
[1:18:59] lifted up like this man got lifted up
[1:19:02] let's pick him up in daniel chapter 4
[1:19:05] and verse 30
[1:19:07] glory amen
[1:19:09] hallelujah you know when you when you
[1:19:12] think about this man god had actually
[1:19:13] given him a dream
[1:19:16] about what was getting ready to happen
[1:19:18] and even a dream was interpreted to him
[1:19:20] told him what was going to happen but he
[1:19:22] couldn't stop itself from going down
[1:19:24] this road
[1:19:26] something's wrong when god show you that
[1:19:28] you're going down the wrong path amen
[1:19:30] god god has revealed it clearly that
[1:19:32] this is the wrong way but some still
[1:19:34] keep pushing to go in that wrong
[1:19:35] direction
[1:19:36] you're going to need an upgrade an
[1:19:38] update
[1:19:39] here daniel 4 verse 30 the king
[1:19:42] spake
[1:19:43] said it's not this great babylon
[1:19:46] that i have built for the house
[1:19:49] of the kingdom
[1:19:50] by my might of my power
[1:19:52] and for the honor of my majesty
[1:19:56] this man just got i
[1:19:58] i all in this like he did it all
[1:20:01] glory to god but there were there were
[1:20:02] prophecies about his kingdom coming amen
[1:20:05] and then there would be prophets about
[1:20:06] the you know other kingdoms that would
[1:20:08] follow amen the meas and persians and
[1:20:10] the greeks and you know then the roman
[1:20:12] empire which is still in effect today
[1:20:14] glory to god but here you know we look
[1:20:16] at verse 30 of the king spake and said
[1:20:18] it's not this great babylon
[1:20:21] that i have built for the house of the
[1:20:24] kingdom by the might of my power amen
[1:20:27] and for the honor of my majesty
[1:20:30] now look at verse 31 while the word
[1:20:34] was in the king's mouth
[1:20:36] there fell a voice from heaven saying o
[1:20:39] king nebuchadnezzar
[1:20:41] uh to thee it is spoken
[1:20:43] god will speak directly to you amen to
[1:20:47] thee it is spoken the kingdom is
[1:20:49] departed from thee
[1:20:51] my and they shall draw thee from men and
[1:20:55] thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of
[1:20:57] the field they shall make thee to eat
[1:21:00] grass as oxen and seven times shall pass
[1:21:03] over thee until thou know that the most
[1:21:06] high ruleth in the kingdom of men and
[1:21:09] giveth it to whomsoever he will oh i
[1:21:12] love that amen you can't question god
[1:21:15] about who he put in leadership
[1:21:19] god god is the one that establishes amen
[1:21:22] the pastor god is the one that
[1:21:24] establishes the evangelist god is the
[1:21:26] one that establishes the prophet god is
[1:21:29] the one that establishes the teacher and
[1:21:31] the apostle god is the one that sets
[1:21:33] those gifts in the church we don't have
[1:21:35] a right to question god
[1:21:39] amen here this man thought it was all
[1:21:41] about him
[1:21:42] and while he's speaking these things out

[1:23:34] of heaven till his hairs grown like
[1:23:36] eagle's feathers and his nails like
[1:23:38] birds claws and at the end of the days i
[1:23:43] nebuchadnezzar

[1:23:47] and my understanding returned unto me

[1:25:11] but but there comes an end to that

[1:25:49] and i praised and honored him that
[1:25:51] liveth forever man whose dominion is in
[1:25:54] everlasting dominion and his kingdom is

[1:26:02] as nothing and he doeth according to his
[1:26:05] will in the army of heaven and among the
[1:26:07] inhabitants of the earth and none can
[1:26:10] stay his hand or say unto him what does
[1:26:14] thou you don't ask god questions

[1:26:26] counselors and my lord sought unto me

[1:26:55] ways judgment and those that walk in
[1:26:57] pride
[1:27:02] those that walk in pride he is able to
[1:27:05] abase
[1:27:08] nebuchadnezzar went through this
[1:27:10] he realized something needed to change
[1:27:12] on the inside of him in his heart he
[1:27:13] needed to go through an update he needed
[1:27:15] to go through an upgrade amen they need
[1:27:18] to go through a system change glory to

[1:27:38] as we move into our new church a new
[1:27:40] school we don't want to get lifted up
[1:27:44] we want to stay humble in the presence
[1:27:46] of god
[1:27:48] glory you know that that was that that
[1:27:50] was one of the main reasons that we
[1:27:51] started the seven a.m morning prayer uh
[1:27:54] you know when god blessed us to come
[1:27:56] from the first building to to to the
[1:27:58] building we just left we i say lord we

[1:28:30] stay humble
[1:28:31] glory glory glory nebuchadnezzar needed
[1:28:36] a change in the heart
[1:28:38] and after he got the change in our heart
[1:28:39] he was able to put his put himself in
[1:28:42] the proper perspective he realized it
[1:28:44] was all about god he was praising and
[1:28:46] extolling and honoring the king of
[1:28:48] heaven
[1:28:49] no more was he talking about what he
[1:28:50] accomplished but he was talking about
[1:28:52] what god had done
[1:28:54] i want to uh also share amen just
[1:28:57] another
[1:28:59] uh example i think in scripture
[1:29:02] of uh where god actually gave an upgrade
[1:29:06] to the kingdom of israel
[1:29:08] amen an upgrade is a complete change out
[1:29:10] pretty much right uh you know when you
[1:29:13] move from that old cop to that new car
[1:29:14] you've upgraded the car amen you've
[1:29:17] moved from the old suit to a new suit
[1:29:19] you you've upgraded the suit moved from
[1:29:21] an old dress to a new dress you've
[1:29:22] upgraded in your wardrobe it's an
[1:29:24] upgrade a complete change a new look
[1:29:28] here you know israel went through an
[1:29:30] upgrade
[1:29:31] they had their first king
[1:29:34] by the name of saul
[1:29:36] amen and and so
[1:29:39] my god was uh
[1:29:42] uh was
[1:29:44] a man was not a good king
[1:29:47] he might have been the first king and
[1:29:49] and there was a time in saul's life
[1:29:51] where you saw god had done something in
[1:29:53] his heart even when he met the prophet
[1:29:55] the prophet saying now uh you're going
[1:29:57] to see this group of men they're going
[1:29:59] to be a school of prophets and you're
[1:30:00] going to start prophesying like them the
[1:30:02] anointing that come on saul he felt that
[1:30:04] anointing and he was a new man he was a
[1:30:07] different man hallelujah but for some
[1:30:10] reason saul couldn't stay with it
[1:30:13] glory he couldn't stay with it and when
[1:30:15] the prophet began to give him a man a
[1:30:18] certain
[1:30:19] instructions all can stay with the
[1:30:21] instructions
[1:30:22] amen hallelujah now now uh saul is what
[1:30:25] we would call a man a a rebellious king
[1:30:30] glory amen but when god decided to take
[1:30:33] saul off the throne he brought in david
[1:30:36] and upgrades because david was
[1:30:38] considered a man after god's own hearts
[1:30:42] hallelujah so israel went through an
[1:30:44] upgrade and let me tell you something
[1:30:46] when it's time to go through the upgrade
[1:30:48] or to go through the update don't be
[1:30:49] afraid of what god is getting ready to
[1:30:51] do
[1:30:53] here we see saul
[1:30:55] amen in 1st samuel chapter 15
[1:30:59] glory we call him a rebellious king
[1:31:01] first samuel chapter 15 verse 22.
[1:31:05] this is he was supposed to
[1:31:07] uh kill all the animals and and do all
[1:31:10] these things that they probably told him
[1:31:11] and and he'd say well i got afraid
[1:31:13] because the people were leaving and you
[1:31:14] hadn't come at the time that you said
[1:31:16] you was coming so i i i just kind of
[1:31:19] forced myself
[1:31:20] i forced myself to do these things
[1:31:22] because i thought the people would leave
[1:31:24] he said no you should have never done
[1:31:25] that he's saying he began to rebuke he
[1:31:28] began to rebuke saul for what he had
[1:31:30] done
[1:31:31] hallelujah look at this this rebuke
[1:31:34] oh help us lord
[1:31:36] some of us don't want to be rebuked
[1:31:40] amen we don't want that when we do
[1:31:41] something wrong we don't want to be
[1:31:43] rebuked
[1:31:45] amen we don't want nobody to tell us
[1:31:47] that we're wrong
[1:31:50] amen we don't want nobody to tell us
[1:31:52] that's not godly that wasn't that wasn't
[1:31:55] right what you did
[1:31:57] you don't want to hear things like that
[1:31:58] this this why kids rise up against their
[1:32:01] parents
[1:32:02] oh i'm telling the truth in it huh
[1:32:04] because they don't want nobody to tell
[1:32:07] them that they're wrong
[1:32:08] see we live in a society that that done
[1:32:12] made some things real bad
[1:32:14] i was at lunch with some guys this week
[1:32:16] i'm gonna come to that scripture a
[1:32:17] little bit i was at some lunch with some
[1:32:18] guys this week and they would talk about
[1:32:19] how they would go to different
[1:32:20] competitions with their their little uh
[1:32:24] nephews or nieces or whatever and in the
[1:32:26] competition
[1:32:27] you know and i saw this happen with my
[1:32:29] my own nephew when we he used to be in
[1:32:31] taekwondo you go to the competition and
[1:32:33] he go and he beat this person real good
[1:32:36] and then at the end of the whole thing
[1:32:38] they come out and give the loser
[1:32:41] a trophy
[1:32:42] and they give the winner a trophy they
[1:32:44] give them both like there was no
[1:32:46] difference in what just happened out
[1:32:47] here
[1:32:48] now you lost
[1:32:50] you get no trophy for losing
[1:32:54] see see we don't we don't we don't we
[1:32:55] don't uh we don't make people soft
[1:33:01] right we don't make them soft they
[1:33:03] expect to lose and still get rewarded
[1:33:08] no you can't lose and get rewarded what
[1:33:10] you need to do is practice and get
[1:33:12] better
[1:33:16] what's the difference here if we all
[1:33:18] going to get a reward why do we even
[1:33:20] have the word winning and losing in our
[1:33:22] vocabulary
[1:33:25] right
[1:33:26] so so you know it's just it's something
[1:33:28] the way that the psyche that they've
[1:33:29] placed on man and they're making us
[1:33:32] weaker
[1:33:33] and we cry because we lost no you don't
[1:33:36] cry because you lost you you you you
[1:33:41] get tough let me use that word i don't
[1:33:43] want to
[1:33:43] say do you you get tough tough in your
[1:33:46] mind
[1:33:47] amen you get out and you start really
[1:33:48] working on your craft
[1:33:50] until you get better
[1:33:54] losers don't win championships
[1:33:58] praise the lord
[1:33:59] glory to god
[1:34:01] but by here you know we what what's
[1:34:03] happened is that we we've we've stopped
[1:34:05] in people and just kind of and and
[1:34:07] nobody nobody want to be told that
[1:34:10] you was wrong
[1:34:12] nobody want to be told
[1:34:14] we only want to speak positive words and
[1:34:16] this positive you lost but you can get
[1:34:18] better
[1:34:21] if you practice you can do i i see it in
[1:34:23] you
[1:34:24] but you got to practice
[1:34:27] hallelujah glory to god you be ready for
[1:34:30] them next time
[1:34:31] all right
[1:34:32] amen but we're not going to reward you
[1:34:34] for losing
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:37] so uh
[1:34:39] here we see amen in first samuel 15.
[1:34:44] this man saul was known as a rebellious
[1:34:46] king
[1:34:47] and i want you to catch this now
[1:34:50] and samuel said
[1:34:52] verse 22 in uh first 15 and samuel said
[1:34:56] hath the lord
[1:34:59] as great delight and burnt offerings and
[1:35:02] sacrifices now notice this man right you
[1:35:05] know because we're like you know i i we
[1:35:07] we killed the animals and we sacrificed
[1:35:09] we got the best of the animals we
[1:35:10] sacrificed he thought he was doing god a
[1:35:13] favor
[1:35:14] but he got a strong rebuke you're not
[1:35:16] doing god no favor god is always doing
[1:35:19] you favors
[1:35:20] listen and as samuel said have the lord
[1:35:24] as great delight and burnt offerings and
[1:35:26] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:35:30] the lord
[1:35:32] behold to obey
[1:35:34] glory
[1:35:35] is better than sacrifice
[1:35:38] so this is what god wants from you he
[1:35:40] wants your obedience
[1:35:42] amen hallelujah in every area of your
[1:35:46] life god wants your obedience to obey us
[1:35:50] better than sacrifice and to hearken
[1:35:52] than the fat of rams
[1:35:54] and look at what the next verse says
[1:35:57] for rebellion
[1:35:58] this is a this is this is this is a a
[1:36:01] dangerous thing to get involved in
[1:36:02] rebellion
[1:36:04] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:36:08] and look at the next one and
[1:36:09] stubbornness
[1:36:11] is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:36:16] because thou has rejected
[1:36:19] whoo
[1:36:20] the word of the lord he has also
[1:36:22] rejected thee from being king
[1:36:26] he got a downgrade
[1:36:30] because he wouldn't follow the word of
[1:36:31] god
[1:36:32] you know you can be at a certain level
[1:36:34] in your life and god just using you and
[1:36:35] using using you
[1:36:37] and if you guys if you allow yourself to
[1:36:39] get lifted up like nebuchadnezzar did
[1:36:42] next thing you know you get a downgrade
[1:36:46] here we see this in the life of king
[1:36:49] saul
[1:36:49] amen uh he because of his disobedience
[1:36:53] to the word of god the prophet had given
[1:36:55] him a exact thing to do but he refused
[1:36:57] to do it he didn't want to do it the
[1:36:58] prophet's way he wanted to do it his way
[1:37:01] i want to tell you something when we get
[1:37:02] caught in a situation like that i want
[1:37:03] you to remember something
[1:37:05] the bible declares there is a way
[1:37:10] that seemeth right unto a man
[1:37:12] but the end thereof
[1:37:15] are the ways of death
[1:37:18] i want to read
[1:37:20] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:37:23] idolatry
[1:37:25] uh this uh i'm gonna pull a quote from
[1:37:27] the message god being misunderstood i
[1:37:29] just added this one to the back amen
[1:37:31] this morning god being misunderstood
[1:37:33] and and the word stubbornness
[1:37:36] it means dogged
[1:37:38] determination
[1:37:41] not to change one's attitude
[1:37:45] or dog determination not to change one's
[1:37:47] position on something
[1:37:49] i'm determined not to change
[1:37:53] i
[1:37:54] i don't care
[1:37:55] what brother jack say
[1:37:58] i'm determined not to change and whoever
[1:38:01] else get in the pulpit i'm determined
[1:38:03] stubbornness
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:08] and here the bible says stubbornness is
[1:38:10] as iniquity
[1:38:12] and idolatry
[1:38:14] now you can be you can be a full-fledged
[1:38:17] christian but still have a stubborn
[1:38:19] spirit
[1:38:21] we're going to read this quote

[1:38:58] stubborn spirit that i can't seem to

[1:39:20] whoever it may be
[1:39:22] now most times when you find people
[1:39:25] that's got stubborn spirits
[1:39:29] he says it's usually a complex that
[1:39:32] causes this
[1:39:34] so when you see somebody with a stubborn
[1:39:36] spirit and not not willing to change
[1:39:38] amen to make adjustments even after they
[1:39:40] hear the word of god that's why i say
[1:39:42] sister waiting when she heard the word
[1:39:43] she applied it immediately before she
[1:39:46] left the ground she was trying to apply
[1:39:48] the word of god
[1:39:51] she wanted to be like jesus
[1:39:53] it says that my christian brother sister
[1:39:55] whoever it may be now most times when
[1:39:58] you find people that's got stubborn
[1:40:00] spirits it's usually a complex that
[1:40:03] causes this either they have inherited
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:06] oh glory to god
[1:40:09] oh i thank god for a prophet
[1:40:12] amen you trying to get free from your
[1:40:14] stubborn spirit are you trying to how
[1:40:15] did this thing get them it came from
[1:40:17] your mama
[1:40:18] it came from your daddy it came from
[1:40:21] your grandma it came from your
[1:40:23] granddaddy
[1:40:25] you inherited a stubborn spirit
[1:40:28] oh my god most of us want to inherit
[1:40:32] money
[1:40:36] to god we want to inherit those things
[1:40:38] but no recognize that there are certain
[1:40:40] characteristics that you got
[1:40:43] glory to god you was born with them
[1:40:45] characteristics and it's going to take
[1:40:47] the holy ghost to set you free from it
[1:40:50] you inherited a stubborn spirit
[1:40:57] my either they inherited from a mother
[1:41:00] look at this
[1:41:02] a father
[1:41:03] look at what the brothers say a uncle
[1:41:08] a uncle you can get a stubborn spirit
[1:41:10] from an uncle
[1:41:14] a aunt
[1:41:16] grandmother grandfather somebody like
[1:41:20] that and if you'll chase back down
[1:41:22] through your life
[1:41:23] now i've taken it by experience under
[1:41:25] discernment because i have met cases on
[1:41:27] the platform thousands of those that
[1:41:29] have that spirit and the first thing you
[1:41:31] know i chased that spirit right back by
[1:41:33] discernment and find that there was a
[1:41:35] granddaddy there was a grandmother there
[1:41:37] was somebody else back down there and
[1:41:40] you inherit that by nature you know
[1:41:42] sometimes your grandparents might have
[1:41:44] gone through certain experiences
[1:41:46] raised in a different era
[1:41:49] my times were different when they was
[1:41:50] coming up right so so so so they look at
[1:41:54] life totally different than the way that
[1:41:55] you look at life but if you're trying to
[1:41:58] actually follow in their footsteps
[1:41:59] you're inheriting a spirit
[1:42:03] who
[1:42:05] some of us come from you know
[1:42:08] uh i i got i got roots in alabama
[1:42:11] i got roots i got family roots in
[1:42:13] alabama
[1:42:14] but there are some things that have
[1:42:15] happened in the past in alabama that
[1:42:17] weren't so good
[1:42:19] and so some of my family from alabama
[1:42:21] some of the stuff that they experienced
[1:42:22] or maybe they saw their parents
[1:42:24] experience they like no no we don't
[1:42:25] trust this we don't trust that we don't
[1:42:27] want this we don't want that but then
[1:42:29] you don't realize if you if you take on
[1:42:31] that nature you take on those
[1:42:33] conversations you begin to inherit
[1:42:37] a spirit that's being passed down
[1:42:39] through your family
[1:42:42] and when it comes to this message
[1:42:45] glory to god when it comes to this
[1:42:47] message
[1:42:49] jesus
[1:42:50] can i just be honest with you
[1:42:53] amen you know i mean because you know we
[1:42:55] come through the air my parents come
[1:42:56] through the area of the days of martin
[1:42:58] luther king
[1:42:59] and brother brandon when he made a
[1:43:00] statement about martin luther king oh my
[1:43:02] goodness how that shook us
[1:43:05] in the message martin luther king don't
[1:43:07] lead his people to a
[1:43:08] slaughter we're thinking ourself how can
[1:43:11] a prophet say that about a good man like
[1:43:13] martin luther king
[1:43:15] it shook us to our core
[1:43:18] but we had to realize the prophet was
[1:43:20] not saying anything racist
[1:43:22] we had to come to that understand that
[1:43:24] what he said it was spiritual
[1:43:28] and if you look back over the over life
[1:43:30] now you look back you look back you look
[1:43:31] back you can see some things where amen
[1:43:33] our people have actually lost some
[1:43:35] spiritual
[1:43:36] things the prophet saw that and he
[1:43:38] called it out
[1:43:40] glory to god glory to god
[1:43:43] amen amen amen amen that dream that
[1:43:46] martin luther king had will never be
[1:43:48] accomplished unless people get the holy
[1:43:50] ghost
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:57] look here
[1:43:58] you got to watch those spears that come
[1:44:01] through
[1:44:02] your
[1:44:03] your parents and your grandparents and
[1:44:04] your uncle talking to your uncle talking
[1:44:07] to your auntie it's a spirit being
[1:44:09] passed down and this message it shakes
[1:44:11] off it just shakes all that stuff down
[1:44:14] oh my god
[1:44:16] that's why you can you can fellowship
[1:44:18] here and you know i had a cousin looking
[1:44:20] online like man it's all kind of people
[1:44:22] in the church yeah that's the way it's
[1:44:23] supposed to be
[1:44:25] god made a big bouquet of people
[1:44:27] and we're supposed to be able to come
[1:44:29] together like that
[1:44:30] and all love one another
[1:44:35] amen no no no uh
[1:44:38] big eye little you no culture greater
[1:44:40] than another culture we're all god's
[1:44:43] people
[1:44:46] call to this message
[1:44:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:44:51] oh i thank god for this
[1:44:53] amen go just about anywhere in the world
[1:44:56] and preach and feel right at home no
[1:44:57] matter no matter what the the the ratios
[1:45:00] is
[1:45:01] feel right at home
[1:45:03] oh blessed be the name of the lord all
[1:45:05] right i'm i i see that there's a spirit
[1:45:07] i know that passes down through my
[1:45:09] family
[1:45:10] amen but the holy ghost breaks that
[1:45:12] spirit
[1:45:15] man look at this he says when he traced
[1:45:17] he chased it down i chased that spirit
[1:45:19] right back by discernment
[1:45:21] and found that there was a granddaddy
[1:45:23] there was a grandmother
[1:45:26] there was somebody else back down there
[1:45:28] and you inherit that
[1:45:30] by nature
[1:45:32] says stubbornness
[1:45:34] is not of god
[1:45:37] it's not of god so when you get a
[1:45:38] stubborn spirit
[1:45:40] you know that god did not anoint you
[1:45:42] with that spirit and let me tell you
[1:45:44] something we all from the pulpit
[1:45:48] to the top riser we all have to fight
[1:45:51] the spirit of stubbornness
[1:45:53] we all want our way
[1:45:56] amen but it's stubbornness is a dog
[1:45:58] determination not to change your
[1:46:01] attitude and not to change your position
[1:46:03] on something
[1:46:05] it's not of god stubbornness is not of
[1:46:07] god and now the only way to get away
[1:46:10] from that
[1:46:11] is you have to overcome faith you have
[1:46:14] to have you have to have faith to
[1:46:15] overcome that that's if you're a
[1:46:17] christian you are a son or daughter of
[1:46:19] god whichever you may be and you will
[1:46:22] never be
[1:46:23] able to just stand and rebuke it and
[1:46:26] rebuke it and rebuke it now notice what
[1:46:28] he said you just can't stand there i
[1:46:30] rebuke this stuff and spirit i rebuke
[1:46:32] this you can't you can't stand and do it
[1:46:34] like that it'll never leave
[1:46:37] pastor pray for me i got a stubborn
[1:46:38] spirit rebuking that we get the oil out
[1:46:41] poured on you we repute this stuff and
[1:46:43] spear the name of jesus in order to stay
[1:46:45] right there
[1:46:46] the prophet gives us insight
[1:46:49] tells us how to overcome a stubborn
[1:46:50] spirit tells us how to get an update
[1:46:55] look at this look at this look at this
[1:46:57] amen he says um uh now the only way to
[1:47:01] get away from that is is you have to
[1:47:03] have faith to overcome that that's if
[1:47:05] you're a christian you're a son or
[1:47:07] daughter of god whichever you may be and
[1:47:08] you will never be able to just stand and
[1:47:10] rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke him
[1:47:12] it's just like tantalizing a rattlesnake
[1:47:16] he's laying there ready to bite you
[1:47:19] and if you will just ignore him
[1:47:24] what wisdom if you would just ignore him
[1:47:27] and walk away from him he can't hurt you
[1:47:32] see so when you feel that you got a
[1:47:34] stubborn spirit lay the thing on the
[1:47:37] altar
[1:47:38] and believe god that the thing is dead
[1:47:41] and you'll never have it no more
[1:47:46] sometimes you just got to act
[1:47:47] differently
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] you gotta act different you and you know
[1:47:53] that thing is there but you just gotta
[1:47:54] you gotta
[1:47:56] hold jesus
[1:47:59] i act like it ain't there because it's a
[1:48:01] spirit from hell trying to trouble you
[1:48:05] amen you just got to ignore it look at
[1:48:07] that he says he says um when you feel
[1:48:09] that uh you got that stubborn spirit lay
[1:48:12] the thing on the altar and believe god
[1:48:14] that the thing is dead and you will
[1:48:15] never have it no more and go on
[1:48:18] and don't even pay any attention to it
[1:48:21] no more and the thing
[1:48:24] will leave you
[1:48:26] not even praying over it rebuking it
[1:48:29] it'll actually go on its own because you
[1:48:31] ignored them
[1:48:34] so when you take on the submarine's fear
[1:48:36] it's because you choose to
[1:48:42] you choose to be stubborn
[1:48:44] you choose to act like that
[1:48:47] oh it's just i just got a devil no you
[1:48:49] accepted that devil into your life
[1:48:52] you welcome that devil lean
[1:48:55] come on church see we're trying to have
[1:48:57] an update in the heart
[1:49:02] oh yes lord
[1:49:04] amen look at what it says now it says
[1:49:07] lay the thing on the altar and believe
[1:49:09] god that the thing is dead and you will
[1:49:12] never
[1:49:13] have it no more and go on and don't even
[1:49:15] pay any attention to it no more and the
[1:49:17] thing will leave you resist the devil
[1:49:18] and he will flee from you
[1:49:20] that's get away quickly so that would be
[1:49:23] my advice to how to overcome it we
[1:49:25] overcome the devil by faith that's what
[1:49:27] we overcome all evil is by faith
[1:49:30] you know i remember um
[1:49:32] we were at the first church building
[1:49:36] after we left our our home
[1:49:38] um
[1:49:40] we moved into the place in green acres
[1:49:43] amen and and we were there and
[1:49:46] and and just so many so many wonderful
[1:49:48] memories
[1:49:49] you know from that five years of being
[1:49:51] there and one of those uh memories was
[1:49:54] they had a a shop right next door to us
[1:49:56] it was a clothing store
[1:49:58] and uh the people would be there and
[1:50:01] sell their clothes and
[1:50:02] and um and and and one day we just got
[1:50:05] to talking to the young man that was
[1:50:06] there i think it was his mother's shop
[1:50:08] and he was there running things for his
[1:50:09] mom and we got to talk to me and my dad
[1:50:12] got to talking to him and
[1:50:13] and he just began to open up so much and
[1:50:15] and just just you know talk about how
[1:50:17] you want to live for the lord and all
[1:50:19] these other things and you know we just
[1:50:20] keep planting seeds keep planting seeds
[1:50:22] and one day he
[1:50:23] uh he came over he's like you know i
[1:50:25] really want to do this but
[1:50:26] i just can't stop smoking
[1:50:29] i just have a problem with smoking i
[1:50:31] just can't stop smoking i i
[1:50:33] i i won't i want to i want to live right
[1:50:36] but i just can't stop it so uh you know
[1:50:38] at that point in time i knew to stop
[1:50:40] talking
[1:50:41] and i knew i let my daddy talk
[1:50:44] because my daddy had balanced smoking
[1:50:45] for years and i knew that god had gave
[1:50:48] him given him the ability to overcome
[1:50:50] a man smoking my even when daddy got
[1:50:53] sick and you know and cancer was
[1:50:55] attacking his body he had a revelation
[1:50:57] he said you know what
[1:50:58] uh i know i smoked and i could have
[1:51:00] brought damage to my body he said but i
[1:51:02] asked god to forgive me and said that
[1:51:04] and as a as a father he's my heavenly
[1:51:07] father he will not allow me to suffer
[1:51:10] from the things that i did wrong he
[1:51:12] actually forgave me for it
[1:51:16] i said my what a revelation
[1:51:18] he said he won't let me suffer so i
[1:51:20] won't receive cancer you know in my
[1:51:22] lungs i won't receive that
[1:51:24] because my my father has forgiven me of
[1:51:26] that i say amen dad
[1:51:28] right and and i saw my dad multiple
[1:51:31] times get healed of cancer
[1:51:33] and he used uh natural means but he was
[1:51:36] healed of cancer multiple times i saw it
[1:51:38] with my own eyes
[1:51:39] the doctor's report showed it that he
[1:51:41] got he had been ill but he was standing
[1:51:43] on the revelation so i remember that
[1:51:44] young man said i just can't overcome you
[1:51:46] know smoking and uh and my dad my dad
[1:51:49] said he looked at the young man he says
[1:51:50] uh
[1:51:52] he says uh you know
[1:51:55] you are
[1:51:56] larger than i am you know i'm a small
[1:51:58] man and you're a little bit larger than
[1:52:00] i am he says uh
[1:52:02] if you were to walk up to me
[1:52:05] and push me as large as you are and
[1:52:07] based on my side of this if you were to
[1:52:09] walk up to me and push me he said you'll
[1:52:10] probably be able to push me right down
[1:52:12] right down no problem at all because of
[1:52:14] your size he says but if i just offered
[1:52:17] a little bit of resistance
[1:52:20] just a little bit of resistance he said
[1:52:22] i don't think you'd be able to get me
[1:52:23] down and my dad is you know late 60s at
[1:52:25] this time he said if i just offer just a
[1:52:27] little resistance even though you come
[1:52:29] stronger than i am and you push me i
[1:52:30] just offer a little resistance i don't
[1:52:32] think you'll be able to get me down
[1:52:34] not that easy
[1:52:36] and he said that's what you got to do
[1:52:38] when it comes to this smoking spirit
[1:52:40] just off a little bit of resistance
[1:52:44] if you resist the devil
[1:52:47] he'll flee
[1:52:49] that's all you got i don't care what
[1:52:51] you're going through this morning if you
[1:52:53] would just offer the devil a little bit
[1:52:56] of resistance
[1:52:58] a little just a no just know i ain't
[1:53:00] doing that no i eventually you're not
[1:53:02] gonna get real strong
[1:53:04] but you just gotta put up a little bit
[1:53:06] of resistance
[1:53:08] when it comes to a stubborn spirit a
[1:53:10] little bit of resistance
[1:53:12] act different do something different
[1:53:14] respond differently
[1:53:16] that spirit will just leave you
[1:53:22] amen hallelujah
[1:53:27] let me see
[1:53:29] i want to um
[1:53:33] let me bring in two other thoughts here
[1:53:35] and i want to move to something else
[1:53:36] here
[1:53:38] updates
[1:53:42] um
[1:53:43] oh my
[1:53:44] they happen all the time
[1:53:46] as long as the
[1:53:48] the business or the software
[1:53:50] the church
[1:53:52] the person as long as they're living
[1:53:54] as long as it's still being used
[1:53:57] in these updates
[1:53:58] it needs updates so we don't we don't we
[1:54:00] don't run from it we welcome him
[1:54:02] and uh here you know i want to just kind
[1:54:04] of show
[1:54:05] the church itself received update it was
[1:54:08] you know uh
[1:54:09] in the days of luther luther came out
[1:54:13] with the message that just shall live by
[1:54:16] faith
[1:54:16] we call that justification right and in
[1:54:19] those days luther was preaching that
[1:54:20] message and why my what a wonderful
[1:54:23] message it was it went contrary to what
[1:54:26] the catholic church was teaching and
[1:54:27] here god was actually updating the
[1:54:30] church with the message of martin luther
[1:54:33] but you know martin luther still smoke
[1:54:35] pipes and all these things like that so
[1:54:37] god had to actually a man send another
[1:54:40] update
[1:54:41] glory to build on the foundation of
[1:54:43] justification he sent wesley with the
[1:54:46] message of sanctification amen and and
[1:54:49] and and as he begin to preach that no
[1:54:51] we're not going to keep smoking we're
[1:54:52] not going to keep drinking we're not
[1:54:53] going to keep doing that we got to live
[1:54:55] a sanctified life before god i'm not
[1:54:57] going to be looking at ladies and
[1:54:59] lusting after them amen i'm not going to
[1:55:01] be looking at men and lusting after them
[1:55:02] i gotta live sanctified
[1:55:07] uh uh here wesley began to preach the
[1:55:09] message of signification that was an
[1:55:11] update to the church but after that you
[1:55:14] know after justification technication
[1:55:15] god sent another update the baptism of
[1:55:18] the holy ghost
[1:55:20] amen and that's what was poured out at
[1:55:23] azusa street amen uh uh william seymour
[1:55:26] believing that god would visit his
[1:55:28] people again and kept praying and kept
[1:55:31] and kept believing god till they got a
[1:55:32] mighty outpouring on azusa street god
[1:55:35] sent that as an update to the church but
[1:55:38] it did not stop there
[1:55:40] amen now it's the holy ghost himself
[1:55:42] becoming one with us
[1:55:45] the very person brother branham makes
[1:55:47] this statement in the message the
[1:55:48] masterpiece
[1:55:50] hallelujah the church has constantly
[1:55:52] been receiving these updates
[1:55:54] amen look at this he says notice here
[1:55:57] the life that was in the husk in the
[1:56:00] stalk and in the tassel in the husk all
[1:56:04] gathers in the seed
[1:56:06] and the light that was in the stalk went
[1:56:09] on uh went one went to make the other
[1:56:12] justification hallelujah made a way for
[1:56:15] sanctification an update amen
[1:56:18] sanctification made a way for the
[1:56:20] baptism of the holy ghost that's another
[1:56:23] update the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56:26] glory made a way for the holy ghost
[1:56:28] itself to come right down in perfection
[1:56:32] back to the word again to manifest
[1:56:34] itself he goes says but what what
[1:56:37] denominated dies like a like a life loot
[1:56:41] like life in luther went to mate wesley
[1:56:43] and from wesley went to pentecost and
[1:56:46] from pentecost to make the original seed
[1:56:48] on the pentecost comes out of wesley
[1:56:50] until that time the reason that
[1:56:51] pentecost come out of wesley because it

[1:58:53] verily
[1:58:55] i say unto you
[1:58:57] whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
[1:58:59] be bound in heaven
[1:59:01] and west of you loose on earth shall be
[1:59:03] loosed in heaven
[1:59:04] and again i say unto you that if two of
[1:59:06] you shall agree on earth as touching
[1:59:08] anything
[1:59:10] that they shall ask
[1:59:12] it shall be done for them of my father
[1:59:14] which is in heaven here's that verse 20.
[1:59:17] glory for where two or three are
[1:59:20] gathered together in my name
[1:59:22] there am i in the midst of them
[1:59:25] thank god that he has been in the midst
[1:59:26] for 20 years no matter how many of us
[1:59:29] were gathering he has proven that he was
[1:59:32] in the midst
[1:59:33] oh hallelujah let's look at this
[1:59:36] statement out of spiritual adoption
[1:59:38] amen this quote from spiritual adoption
[1:59:40] the prophet makes this statement he says
[1:59:42] sometimes
[1:59:44] god meets in different councils of man
[1:59:48] god has always loved to counsel with man
[1:59:51] and many times in the old testament
[1:59:53] how we could go back to find how god met
[1:59:56] with man and regardless of their numbers
[2:00:00] god meets with man he met one time with
[2:00:04] 500 and he met again with 70 he met
[2:00:08] again with the 12. he met once with
[2:00:11] three and then he met again just with
[2:00:14] one and regardless of the number of the
[2:00:17] council god always loved to meet loves
[2:00:20] to meet with man so even though the
[2:00:23] church this morning may not be as large
[2:00:25] in congregation or in size as many great
[2:00:29] cathedrals today but god will be pleased
[2:00:32] to meet with us
[2:00:34] amen for he said wherever two or three
[2:00:36] are gathered in my name i'll be in their
[2:00:39] midst two or three will gather my name
[2:00:41] i'll be
[2:00:42] in the midst of that two or three
[2:00:44] church i can go back in my mind and amen

[2:00:53] come in your head

[2:00:58] to be in our midst

[2:05:03] laodicea church age the sounding of that
[2:05:06] angel when that church age is done
[2:05:08] denominated and become a church age when
[2:05:11] it's done in its pentecostal
[2:05:12] organization
[2:05:13] when the messenger to that
[2:05:16] what was each messenger what was martin
[2:05:18] luther a rebuke to the catholic
[2:05:20] what was wesley a rebuke to them
[2:05:23] lutherans what was the pentecost a
[2:05:25] rebuke to them others
[2:05:28] where has the life gone now
[2:05:31] away from an
[2:05:33] no more shuck it's the grain what is it
[2:05:35] a rebuke to the pentecost see to fulfill
[2:05:37] the scripture of this hour see
[2:05:40] i think about this you know uh you all
[2:05:42] might not realize you are rebuked to the
[2:05:44] pentecostals
[2:05:45] you know the pentecostals used to dress
[2:05:46] the way you dress
[2:05:48] they used to look the way you look
[2:05:50] but now they don't have that they got a
[2:05:52] form of godliness
[2:05:53] but they deny the power of the keeping
[2:05:55] gospel
[2:05:57] hallelujah amen you are a rebuke to them
[2:06:00] every time you walk out i was walking up
[2:06:02] here to the church and i see two
[2:06:03] churches here and i'm watching the way
[2:06:05] some dress to go in one church and the
[2:06:07] way dressed the way others are dressed
[2:06:08] to go to another church
[2:06:10] since these sisters stand as a rebuke
[2:06:14] to the others hallelujah
[2:06:17] and they won't be able to say that they
[2:06:18] didn't know truth they saw truth walk in
[2:06:20] perform every sunday
[2:06:24] hallelujah they can see they see through
[2:06:26] the windows they see you walking up
[2:06:29] they can see it
[2:06:30] amen i remember if
[2:06:33] somebody came into the church and they
[2:06:35] saw how everybody was dressed they said
[2:06:37] i think i'm at the wrong church
[2:06:38] [Music]
[2:06:42] just by looking at the way the sisters
[2:06:43] were dressed i think i'm at the wrong
[2:06:45] church
[2:06:47] you probably are
[2:06:49] if you don't want an update
[2:06:52] let me just keep reading i'm almost
[2:06:53] there
[2:06:55] notice
[2:06:57] the very day when this messenger not
[2:06:58] when he starts on
[2:07:00] but when he begins to declare his
[2:07:02] message see the first pull
[2:07:04] healing
[2:07:06] second pull
[2:07:08] prophesying or or actually we can call
[2:07:10] it uh discernment it was an update
[2:07:13] right second prophesied third pull
[2:07:15] another update the opening of the word
[2:07:18] the mysteries revealed no more there's
[2:07:20] no more higher order to reveal the word
[2:07:22] than prophets that's my god i love that
[2:07:25] no more higher order to reveal the word
[2:07:27] than prophets but the only way
[2:07:30] the prophet can be vindicated is by the
[2:07:32] word that's why we believe his message
[2:07:35] because god promised it in the word and
[2:07:37] remember the third paul was the opening
[2:07:39] of them seven seals to reveal the hidden
[2:07:41] truth that's been sealed in the word do
[2:07:43] you see it it is then and that day when
[2:07:46] this thing is to take place that janus
[2:07:48] and jamborees the impersonators will
[2:07:50] appear again just like they did when
[2:07:52] moses appeared with the original word to
[2:07:54] say it they appeared to impersonate it
[2:07:56] just exactly right now you see what
[2:07:59] matthew 24 24 is see
[2:08:02] anointed once every time god took the
[2:08:05] prophet's ministry from one level to the
[2:08:07] next level to the next level it was an
[2:08:09] update
[2:08:11] the man didn't change
[2:08:13] just an update to his ministry and i
[2:08:15] want to tell you god has taken us these
[2:08:17] 20 years to another level and we're
[2:08:19] receiving an update
[2:08:22] i want to welcome it with all my heart
[2:08:25] i don't want to be stubborn and stuck in
[2:08:26] my ways
[2:08:27] i want to welcome what god got for me
[2:08:29] next because i didn't even think god had
[2:08:31] this for me
[2:08:33] but for god to god to call me to this
[2:08:34] and allow me to be a part of it i just
[2:08:36] want to give him all the glory
[2:08:38] all the honor i never want to get lifted
[2:08:40] up like nebuchadnezzar
[2:08:42] this is not
[2:08:44] amen uh anything brother jack did this
[2:08:46] is all god
[2:08:48] let me just share a little testimony
[2:08:51] here i i'm gonna pull out i got some
[2:08:53] more notes here amen that i wanted to
[2:08:55] kind of bring but i i don't think i'll
[2:08:57] have time to hit it so
[2:08:59] i will oh lord i i can't i can't i can't
[2:09:03] i might go in overtime y'all just bear
[2:09:04] with me
[2:09:05] i want to share this i want to share
[2:09:07] this
[2:09:08] another update
[2:09:11] was when
[2:09:13] joshua
[2:09:14] led the people into the promised land
[2:09:17] it was update not an upgrade
[2:09:20] the reason i say it was an upgrade moses
[2:09:23] brought the people out of egypt
[2:09:25] but joshua took them into the promised
[2:09:27] land and the reason it was an update is
[2:09:29] because you cannot
[2:09:30] upgrade from a prophet
[2:09:35] you can't upgrade from a prophet
[2:09:38] that's god's highest order of revealing
[2:09:40] things
[2:09:41] so you only update but you never upgrade
[2:09:46] the prophet provides the original code
[2:09:49] and we simply complete what was
[2:09:51] originally started
[2:09:53] amen israel didn't come out of egypt
[2:09:56] just to wander in the wilderness they
[2:09:58] had a promised land awaiting we didn't
[2:10:01] forsake the world and denomination to
[2:10:03] simply wander around the message there's
[2:10:06] a rapture a changing of the body that's
[2:10:08] awaiting us
[2:10:09] amen as moses brought them out joshua
[2:10:13] took them in glory to god the amen and i
[2:10:16] want to say this uh as as the message
[2:10:18] that god gave brother branham brought us
[2:10:20] out of denomination brought us out of
[2:10:23] the world brought us out of state it's
[2:10:25] the holy ghost that is here now to take
[2:10:27] us in
[2:10:29] the holy ghost is our joshua today who
[2:10:32] is taking us into the promised land
[2:10:35] our prophet
[2:10:36] will be one of the dead in christ
[2:10:39] who will rise and present us
[2:10:41] to jesus
[2:10:43] let me read a little something here
[2:10:45] oh i i yes i'm gonna read this as i was
[2:10:49] with moses so i'll be with thee
[2:10:51] look at this
[2:10:52] says and as we find joshua to take this
[2:10:55] commission
[2:10:56] knowing the responsibilities was was uh
[2:10:59] leading them through the land through
[2:11:01] lands now that he have to go over into
[2:11:04] other land he'd have to set up the
[2:11:06] kingdom he'd have to divide the
[2:11:08] inheritance among them he know the
[2:11:10] commission was tremendous far more than
[2:11:13] what moses had done joshua had more to
[2:11:16] do than moses had to do another thing he
[2:11:19] was to lead them along the border
[2:11:22] amongst their brethren and they'd
[2:11:23] already tasted blood he had to conquer
[2:11:26] them he had to keep them quiet as they
[2:11:28] marched on so is it today with the new
[2:11:31] pentecostal group that's rising up
[2:11:33] they've tasted denominationalism it's so
[2:11:36] hard to keep them there
[2:11:39] now this is what the message you know uh
[2:11:42] was to try to pull us out of
[2:11:44] denominations god was upgrading when he
[2:11:46] pulled us out of pentecost when he
[2:11:48] pulled us out of baptist when he pulled
[2:11:50] us out of methodist when he pulled us
[2:11:52] out of catholic it was an upgrade
[2:11:54] a spiritual upgrade
[2:11:58] brother random says you know in this
[2:12:00] quote he says it's hard to keep them
[2:12:01] there people that taste
[2:12:02] denominationalism they always want to go
[2:12:04] back to it
[2:12:06] and when they get there they realize
[2:12:08] how
[2:12:10] how uh
[2:12:13] it's
[2:12:14] it just does it doesn't taste good
[2:12:17] the experience is not good when you get
[2:12:19] there it don't take them long to realize
[2:12:20] this is a mess i don't i don't got
[2:12:22] myself involved in something i should i
[2:12:24] know better than this
[2:12:26] it don't take him long
[2:12:28] look when god give you an update and
[2:12:29] upgrade don't go back don't take a
[2:12:31] downgrade
[2:12:33] keep following following god i want to
[2:12:35] do more for you i was just thinking
[2:12:36] about this uh brother adam you know when
[2:12:38] he preached the message services of time
[2:12:41] he talked about six dreams and one
[2:12:42] vision
[2:12:43] and brother bila had a dream
[2:12:46] and it talked about the cattle wanting
[2:12:47] to go the way of least resistance oh my
[2:12:50] god
[2:12:51] church this is where we are because the
[2:12:53] cattle represent the church they want to
[2:12:55] go the way of least resistance
[2:12:58] they want to go the easy way out they
[2:13:01] don't want to be rebuked
[2:13:04] they don't want to admit that they're
[2:13:05] wrong they don't want that they want
[2:13:07] that easy way out so the easy way out
[2:13:10] sometimes produce a stubborn spirits
[2:13:14] y'all see the circle we're back in there
[2:13:15] now right but sometimes the easy way out
[2:13:17] produce a stubborn spirit this is why
[2:13:19] some people they don't want they don't
[2:13:20] want to own up to it they don't want to
[2:13:22] be told they're wrong they don't want
[2:13:24] headship
[2:13:26] they don't want that
[2:13:28] amen they run from that they'll do
[2:13:31] everything against that
[2:13:33] don't tell me what to do
[2:13:37] right
[2:13:38] but that's the wrong spirit
[2:13:40] it's a wrong spirit
[2:13:42] here you know um brother bill would say
[2:13:45] he saw that the cattle they wanted to go
[2:13:46] the way of least resistance said but
[2:13:47] brother branham told us to keep the
[2:13:49] cattle on this side
[2:13:51] and and what i mean by keeping the cat
[2:13:53] on this side that mean keep the cattle
[2:13:55] away from denomination
[2:13:57] and here just a little statement i won't
[2:13:59] read the whole quote so that's the way
[2:14:00] we hunt for the lord
[2:14:02] and the food for the lord through
[2:14:03] difficult we always go through difficult
[2:14:05] we don't we don't go the way of least
[2:14:06] resistance we actually go the harder way
[2:14:08] you say they say it says uh and that's
[2:14:10] the way and i'm coming to standing in
[2:14:12] the gap you can get that one lined up
[2:14:13] it's the last one i have over there it
[2:14:15] says uh it says um
[2:14:17] and that's the way we hunt for the lord
[2:14:19] and the food of the lord through
[2:14:20] difficult rounding up the cattle was
[2:14:23] this church keeping them on that side
[2:14:25] cattle will actually go on the smooth
[2:14:28] road the denomination if they can
[2:14:31] which the road represented denomination
[2:14:34] we're doing everything we can to keep
[2:14:36] the cattle on this side grazing in these
[2:14:41] lands
[2:14:42] where this message is being preached
[2:14:45] keep the cattle on this side
[2:14:51] some of you all had to leave some very
[2:14:53] very tough situations
[2:14:55] i i i i just thank god for this
[2:14:58] some of y'all went through some
[2:14:59] tremendous
[2:15:01] trials before you came here to spiritual
[2:15:02] tooth tabernacle
[2:15:04] some of y'all had to make some tough
[2:15:06] choices
[2:15:07] some of y'all was criticized by
[2:15:10] by everybody
[2:15:12] but you have to withstand the criticism
[2:15:14] and you have allowed god to prove that
[2:15:16] your decision
[2:15:19] was right
[2:15:21] can i can i can i just share just a
[2:15:23] little encouragement from this message
[2:15:24] standing in the gap and what this was
[2:15:26] was this after after sermon one time
[2:15:29] brother branham preached this man walked
[2:15:30] up to him said man that could have been
[2:15:31] the 22nd chapter of revelation as he was
[2:15:34] talking he just started speaking and
[2:15:36] talks
[2:15:37] and when he started speaking in tongues
[2:15:39] three people rose up real quick saying
[2:15:40] oh that one tongues that was perfect
[2:15:42] french and brother branham says it was
[2:15:44] he said okay you go over there to your
[2:15:46] corner you write out what he said you go
[2:15:48] to another corner you write out what he
[2:15:49] said you go to the other corner you
[2:15:50] write out what he said and bring it back
[2:15:52] to me
[2:15:53] when they brought the words back to the
[2:15:54] prophet
[2:15:56] can i just read it because this is for
[2:15:58] you
[2:15:59] this is for you i know you made some
[2:16:01] tough decisions from heart and even you
[2:16:03] withstanding criticism right now
[2:16:06] but i got good news for you
[2:16:09] look at this in this message standing in
[2:16:11] the gap i'm going right to paragraph 136
[2:16:14] oh
[2:16:15] oh i can't let me just read i victor lee
[2:16:18] do
[2:16:19] i am a full-blooded frenchman born again

[2:16:27] angeles 46. i attend the bethel temple
[2:16:31] pastor arne vick pastor

[2:16:36] prophecy said over brother branham given
[2:16:38] by danny henry in french
[2:16:41] february the 11th 1961 reason i had to
[2:16:44] read that because february 11th is my
[2:16:46] daughter's birthday
[2:16:48] alexandria's birthday and this happened
[2:16:50] on her birthday right february 11 1961
[2:16:53] at the full gospel businessmen's
[2:16:55] breakfast a true translation of the
[2:16:57] prophecy now here's what it said because
[2:17:01] thou has chosen the narrow way
[2:17:04] hallelujah
[2:17:05] oh my the harder way
[2:17:09] thou has walked in your own choosing
[2:17:11] nobody made you do this but you chose
[2:17:14] the harder way thou has walked the night
[2:17:16] on jesus jesus says now i can see that
[2:17:19] moses had to make his choice too see
[2:17:22] thou has picked
[2:17:25] the precise and correct way correct
[2:17:28] decision and it is my way it says
[2:17:32] underline my way the holy spirit
[2:17:34] speaking back it says because of this
[2:17:37] momentous decision
[2:17:40] a huge portion of heaven awaits you
[2:17:44] awaits thee
[2:17:45] my it says what a glorious decision
[2:17:49] now listen close he said what a glorious
[2:17:51] decision thou hast made this
[2:17:54] in itself
[2:17:56] is that the decision that you made
[2:18:00] to worship in spirit and in truth this
[2:18:03] in itself is that
[2:18:06] which will make and come to pass
[2:18:09] the tremendous
[2:18:10] victory
[2:18:12] in the love divine
[2:18:14] [Music]

[2:18:21] you don't have to prove nothing
[2:18:24] you just stay salty they'll get thirsty
[2:18:28] before you know what you'll see a family
[2:18:30] member sitting right next to the same
[2:18:31] ones that was criticizing you
[2:18:34] about coming to the church you'll see
[2:18:35] them sitting next to you underneath the
[2:18:38] same ministry
[2:18:40] this in itself the decision in itself
