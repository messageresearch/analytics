Psalm 34 says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast of all the humble shall hear their other be glad and magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together [Music] I saw what we heard you have delivered me from all my fears they looked at the end of the light when their faces with unashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and see come out of all of his face the age of the Lord at campus round about them that fear him and delivered them and taste and see that the Lord is who blessed is the man that trusted a man a man before we will just open up a word of prayer to my order to quickly just mention location I'm going to say a couple of years we've been playing that our church about opportunities for outreach there are some things that we do there the local church to try to reach other people outside those walls and we just been praying and seeking email about just different chances that we might have to just reach out to somebody that might not know Christ and I feel like that's our responsibility as believers Alabama they identified that he was talking on the scripture revelation 15 I believe and there are some people that come up a man sea glass mixed with blood it was comment that the Prophet made he says on this season people that the coming through the tribulation Saints eating that is mine and your thoughts that they did not reach it so you know you see things like that like Lord I'm going to do what I can to try to reach somebody to Christ and we just afraid of a seeking opportunity and this this kind of came up this type a man and we just jumped them and everything we had it's my first time doing this and we just we just expected God to get all the floor and all the honor and I'm so grateful for everybody's coming out but please be a prayer and we came out to the serious and the bones from the church and they flooded this area with invitations just trying to invite people out we want to pray for the sick invite people to salvation we want to preach messages that they can understand you know that they can grab ahold of and then we're just doing all you can

sister churches they got my safety end of the show because y'all coming to be the product of these services what it means to just a person alone quite sure everybody know that we gone through a little

table they put a put me on three weight and and they were like you know what the devil is the feet we just feel then you want us we want to start tonight I think this is going to be the person many outreach services like this I'm not just here but they want to try to move it just around you know what as long as that that one person is still out there mom avoiding me and I know we sold trust them to be in our own environment and I'm all those [Applause] we was looking at [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] it had the vision you've got that was like buddy we you know Moses was in a battle to children of injuries in the battle and it's not as Moses Hannah's was up they would give their bit bundestag getting look weak you know it's up about human nature get a little weak the two roads came and got a funny so they they saw me and at a place of neatness they're gonna get up under the load as well as you we can keep your hands up [Applause] sometimes people wonder why is he doing [Applause] and we will understand it better by I'm not going to be long maybe a few minutes we want to just try to do some different things to just kind of get the feel and but I just gotta move thought like to say you know it's mostly believers here tonight but but I believe this this atmosphere is just gonna that's what was that but we appreciate out a brother in tonight and I'm gonna be real brief a real simple but yeah I'm just continue to pray for us and as we you know just let the Lord lead us inaudible about having outreach yeah and just going out after the love I believe it's some sick for let's look at the book of math arms tonight what Matthew chapter 11 water read the 28th through the 30th verse is what if it is good to see everybody we appreciate our worship it was either have a say man just come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I mean get lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light this is about hand forward Heavenly Father we just thank you tonight to decide for grace and mercy we just appreciate you for what you're doing in our midst of God tonight and this actually must help us to say something Lord that'll be encouraging Jesus Christ wonderful baby what what we would talk about because we were you know the brothers they came home and they did some passing out flyers and and different things that like to say we were trying to reach a Lawson dying world that's just that should still be our desire as Christmas I just want to talk we feel a promise to the heavenly you know we start with solving God I believe that I believe God has given everything that that we stand in need of in his word how many per say God past makes provisions yeah you know when that I believe knew that what age and our that we will be right God knew that that you know we as a group of people we would be in the worst of Ages that right I believe that everything from the beginning has been congested in this age and and we're we're we're we're seeing things now that like we've not seen before I can recall getting converted in 1988 but you know I can see a chain yeah you got to see where where people are you know where they should be people are unstable like they used to buy on it right people people are humble like like they used to be but I mean you know it just goes along with the age that we're living in then right I don't know about you gonna break for tonight that the goddess has brought something back that we could look at to anchor us in this holiday this is what I believe we had to come back to the right in order to be able to truly survive this age we had to come back to a biblical principle things that we could not see things that we couldn't grasp on our own but the sovereignty of God you know but knew that we would be living in the age of pressure where people people are struggling people people are burdened down the word heavy lateness is burdened by the cares of Bergen physical heavy load trouble distress and you know we can see them on every hand we could see you know just the mindset of humanity young young people for these fools and you know you know 50 years ago when I was a kid you didn't hear about young people and with all the terms and pretty happy my question was it causing us to get ammunition and go and kill a bunch of innocent people but it is it's the agent Liberty television and video games you know week recent message then you know you you can you can see now he preached the message call invasion of the USA and from that message he was trying to show us the tool of the instrument that the enemy are using this power to bring a distress right Jeffrey burn right they just you know at a junction where they don't just don't really know what to do [Applause] other things that used to be wrong in life coming right where the Prophet was talking about just the burden of the ministry and how you know that the paper will put such pressure paraphrase but such pressure on the ministry took to such a degree with everyone it down the book write down the box and not realizing the detriment and letting down the always yes always had a provided see if we let down the standard [Applause] you know change this word nobody would not see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yeah the pressure the pressure people leaving I think every Minister has experienced [Applause] but you know [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] one of the things that I like to use no matter what the world says they still how do you bow you know what you how could you take back what you know you know it's weird that people say God is revealed certain things that is next week no matter what the world say they still lean down to the modern trends of the modern religion mister this is the truth Ministry of the day right no social gospel a man for the men see this is the thing that people walk right we got this modern yes sure sit around and drink coffee just be religious you know rock song whatever and it's really filled you know all right watch yourself not realize it God have a plank that kind of program cost our standard you know ministry what a revelation realizes they made that is it's not the total farm this got to hold the standard you all appreciate God sitting you right an individual with one mission not to build anything but the poorest back to the work make yourself a dynasty none of it goes back to the white to bring us something that we won't get caught up amen and social you know mean that you know won't bow to the moderate trends of religion no social gospel of man they believe God still home we still believe in this met some people that still believe in polls but they believe he requires holiness he requires a new birth separation from see you know what I believe I believe if people will ever get born again but this this is the age of oppression they look unimpressed you in charge why while we are preaching the unsearchable riches of Jesus yes it was [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that don't mean you to place arrest it's just a lot of people like that in a place of distress burden don't know which way to turn yeah don't know which way is invitation right everybody's heavy laden burden come what come the invitation to come right now see I think sometime I probably just satisfied will get people to appeal but gave them to the bill denied duress right you got to take the people all the way into the baptism that's the requirement that's the only thing that'll bring satisfaction all hot for that wrist and you can sleep right people people people are trying to find a recipe for peace and that's what that's what these types of meetings is all about right amen bringing the people into Jesus with the family that's the message [Applause] getting the people in Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because I believe that's what that servant amen mission works alright right to get the people in context by one spirit not just a gathering in the villa building but what they give to people in crisis this apply yeah and the world has a cry in church that's a cry the problem of it is people are trying to satisfy my step-brother Omar to keep evangelism is killing [Applause] this kid right people trying to fight trying to find satisfaction and they will not find it apart from the world [Applause] right the fullness of the word right not not just church all right not just choice join me come on come on did you enjoy the Grundy's try to be miserable [Applause] miserable people around the reviewer no joy [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] what's doing we gotta take people deep enough we'll think about papa I was really struck this week at the property and say what we need is a good old-fashioned Powell's repine one thing about whoa how took the people so far superficial Christian religion the maker see [Applause] gotta get back to go we singsong shut it that's a crime you see it you supply the workers is this a crime right what's this see there's a crime on the Hartford and rest watch this we say but the majority don't know the answer the people don't know the answer what is going to take to create a man that that that thirst that and cry aha but people are trouble enough the body oh god sobbing wait Minister yes sir if you try to approach to you never wake up for that crime you'll never be one of the biggest issues that you have right different than what we had years ago right a man that everybody everybody's got the crime and the problem with people don't know the way that's my brother you got the guy you think you know us brother we just woke up one day and say well praise the Lord I want to pass the race yourself in [Applause] because God knows the heart of right God knows the heart of this community right oh they made their last a head that's a priest unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ and will not compromise is that right it's a modern trick right not not concerned about you know numbers and things of that nature right or whether or not we be got the finest all good clean death I'm saying it in and be the tambourine and everything else amen they tried that wit with the Apostles yeah they tried to get them to stop preaching Christ you each and every thing go [Applause] we realize we have come back to the bike yeah back to pity man that's what you kept you okay you might have a lot of emotions

there and they've got we want to find it right now the name of Jesus no matter what the condition is we come against it but the authority of the power of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you say what we bind on earth shall be found in heaven what release on earth shall be loosed in heaven so we released the the healing virtue of dogs have learned from the crown of the head to the soles of their feet and though she might bring deliverance and rest to them to me those that might be struggling ancillary their life was said while we pray that you may also play the rest of it tonight may they
