[52:04] are given their imagination as to what
[52:08] hell would be like you can't even
[52:09] imagine yeah your imaginations don't

[59:55] the family of mrs. Tommy s Baker and
[59:58] this is coming from her door to the
[1:00:00] theory of Baker's you just want to thank
[1:00:01] the Church of the prayers of just
[1:00:03] everything you did as a service that we
[1:00:05] went to a few weeks ago when we will be
[1:00:07] left Sarasota but this was a lady Lord
[1:00:13] blessed in a sea 93 years here on earth
[1:00:15] and we had an opportunity just to kind
[1:00:17] of sit with her in her home and
[1:00:18] and just go through Scripture and sing
[1:00:20] songs with her you know during her life
[1:00:23] journey and she was that wasn't able to
[1:00:26] get out and go to church so me and my
[1:00:27] daughters and my wife and we would go to
[1:00:29] her house take a little keyboard we sing
[1:00:31] and we would just have service there in
[1:00:33] the church in her house with her and it
[1:00:35] was just a real blessing
[1:00:37] amen to be able to do that and the Lord
[1:00:39] called her home here at 93 years old and
[1:00:41] we had an opportunity to go and just be
[1:00:43] just offer prayer for the family there
[1:00:45] on that day of her home horn service and
[1:00:47] and the door to just want to send her

[1:00:51] church thinks a man for all of the
[1:00:54] support over the years so Amen we thank
[1:00:56] God for that praise the Lord Amen well I
[1:01:00] won't I'm gonna try not to take too much
[1:01:03] of your time because I know how y'all is
[1:01:08] but nonetheless become the church to
[1:01:10] hear the word of God a man in 1/3
[1:01:14] certainly thank God for everything that
[1:01:16] happened I heard it's either one or two
[1:01:18] specials I can't I'm not really sure but
[1:01:20] I know I heard something and and I'm
[1:01:22] grateful for that the worship was
[1:01:24] certainly a blessing and but now we want
[1:01:28] to try to take our attention to the Word
[1:01:30] of God if you would just stand with me
[1:01:32] we'll read a scripture and I'll just
[1:01:36] read this and then I'll let you will
[1:01:39] have a word of Prayer and I'll let you
[1:01:40] be seated a man here at Luke chapter 1 a
[1:01:45] man verse 37 we read this so last week
[1:01:49] and man and I'll read it again on to
[1:01:51] date Luke 1 and verse 37 says for with
[1:01:56] God nothing shall be impossible a man
[1:02:00] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:02:03] let's just pray over what we've just
[1:02:05] read father we thank you for the ability
[1:02:09] to read scripture but God help us to
[1:02:12] really capture what is is really being
[1:02:15] sane and what's spoken to us so take
[1:02:17] control over this portion of service we
[1:02:20] thank you for your spirit that has led
[1:02:22] us here already and we've just enjoyed
[1:02:25] the time of worship but now God let us
[1:02:27] enjoy the time
[1:02:29] of listening to the words of Jesus then
[1:02:31] we pray amen
[1:02:32] god bless you praise the Lord
[1:02:39] so just again we were using our subject
[1:02:44] of nothing shall be impossible a man we
[1:02:47] started down this journey on last week
[1:02:50] and and I want to just kind of keep
[1:02:53] going
[1:02:54] amen and this in this endless thought
[1:02:57] here you know it is it's Christmas and
[1:03:01] you know there'll be many programs that
[1:03:04] have put on at various churches you know
[1:03:07] many that'll happen today and all
[1:03:09] through you know all the way up into a
[1:03:11] Christmas Eve service and and many are
[1:03:13] reflecting a man on what happened here
[1:03:16] some 2,000 years ago when our Lord and
[1:03:19] Savior was was born
[1:03:22] now now again we we do understand we do
[1:03:25] understand clearly that Jesus was not
[1:03:28] born on December 25th we do know that a
[1:03:31] man because being the Lamb of God
[1:03:35] lambs are not born during the wintertime
[1:03:37] lambs are born during the springtime
[1:03:39] right so we know that he would have been
[1:03:42] born in the spring he was died in spring
[1:03:44] and born in the spring but nonetheless a
[1:03:46] man have Christmas it's here to stay
[1:03:49] it's not going anywhere so a man I'm
[1:03:53] just one that I'm very happy to see
[1:03:56] because I love my lord so much I'm so
[1:03:59] happy that everybody is forced to think
[1:04:02] about him during this season a man and
[1:04:06] and and when we put up Jesus is the
[1:04:08] reason for the seed season you can't
[1:04:10] argue that you can't fight that right
[1:04:13] you you not you're not celebrating
[1:04:15] Christmas because of Buddha you're not
[1:04:19] you not celebrating Christmas because of
[1:04:22] you know somebody else right you a man
[1:04:24] that you're celebrating Christmas
[1:04:26] because it was the birth of the Lord
[1:04:28] Jesus amen so so in nonetheless you are
[1:04:32] forced to at least think about them
[1:04:33] right you're forced at least talk about
[1:04:36] them just a little bit and with the with
[1:04:38] with society being the way it is today
[1:04:41] we're almost
[1:04:43] limited as to when we can mention the
[1:04:45] name Jesus a man I mean people don't
[1:04:48] want you to say that in public anymore
[1:04:50] but but but and even even you know if
[1:04:52] you notice I try to put people on the
[1:04:54] spot a man when I when I'm out shopping
[1:04:55] and everything and and I sigh they say
[1:04:58] Happy Holidays I say Merry Christmas I
[1:05:02] put them on the spot right Merry
[1:05:04] Christmas
[1:05:05] it said loud and say it proud right I
[1:05:08] don't want to put merry xmas I'm
[1:05:11] crossing Christ out right but I want to
[1:05:13] keep Christ in the center this
[1:05:15] Merry Christmas we're celebrating with
[1:05:17] the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ right and so so it's a very a
[1:05:22] menace to me it's just a time where
[1:05:24] everybody has has to reflect on the but
[1:05:28] you know when I when I think about it in
[1:05:31] order for crisp Christmas to occur and I
[1:05:35] just my thoughts were just kind of
[1:05:36] centered around this this season in
[1:05:38] order for Christmas to occur it took a
[1:05:41] miracle Christmas would not have
[1:05:45] happened a man had not a virgin
[1:05:48] conceived right
[1:05:49] it took an absolute miracle it meant to
[1:05:53] celebrate his birthday it took a miracle
[1:05:56] I was reading you know uh about a few
[1:06:00] things and and even married her mother's
[1:06:03] name was and right she was the daughter
[1:06:06] and and from my understanding from some
[1:06:09] of the history Mary's father was already
[1:06:12] passed before she was born
[1:06:14] hallelujah and not only that amen her
[1:06:19] mother was so convinced that she was
[1:06:21] going to have a son she was preparing
[1:06:23] for a boy Oh glory and and a mother was
[1:06:27] was a little older in age by the time
[1:06:29] she conceived Mary the mother mary's
[1:06:33] mother had to experience a miracle just
[1:06:36] to have Mary oh my god right mary's
[1:06:41] mother had to have a miracle in her body
[1:06:44] in order to conceive and produce Mary
[1:06:47] then that just goes to show me something
[1:06:50] that if God has orchestrated if God has
[1:06:55] predestinated but some things that
[1:06:58] happen and look God went looking for a
[1:07:00] man if he if he chose Mary in his mind
[1:07:04] he was not looking for Mary Ann come on
[1:07:08] somebody hey man he was not looking for
[1:07:11] Stephanie God said Mary in God's mind it
[1:07:17] was gonna be
[1:07:18] Mary when he gave the promise that a
[1:07:21] virgin shall conceive and Isaiah 7:14
[1:07:24] and bear a son and shall call his name
[1:07:26] Emmanuel they did this is this is
[1:07:28] important because first of all it got to
[1:07:31] be a virgin amen and then secondly if a
[1:07:34] virgin conceived and had a daughter that
[1:07:37] would have been the word but had to be a
[1:07:40] virgin that will conceive and have a son
[1:07:43] Oh hallelujah so so here mary's mother
[1:07:48] has gone through all these things she
[1:07:50] can't even have children and finally God
[1:07:52] blesses her and gives her child she
[1:07:54] thought was going to be a bore but God
[1:07:55] gave a girl and in that girl that God
[1:07:59] gave me that came through a miracle it
[1:08:01] was the same girl that God was going to
[1:08:03] use to bring forth Christ Oh what I mean
[1:08:08] you just think about all the miracles
[1:08:10] that were happening just for us to have
[1:08:11] Christmas I think it's something that we
[1:08:16] would like last week I say Karl timeout
[1:08:19] right Amen before you get so involved in
[1:08:23] all the shopping before you get so
[1:08:25] involved and all and all the opening of
[1:08:28] the presses and what you got do you
[1:08:32] realize what just occurred here it took
[1:08:34] a miracle for you to celebrate this
[1:08:40] hallelujah right so you know we were
[1:08:43] we've been in this this this disdain and
[1:08:46] let's just read the story a man from
[1:08:48] Luke chapter 1 let's just read it out
[1:08:51] and read the whole thing last week but
[1:08:52] let's let's read the story
[1:08:53] amen and we're not even a man we haven't
[1:08:57] even got to the part where you know
[1:08:59] where where he was actually born we just
[1:09:01] talked about the conception part you you
[1:09:03] realize the conception could not have
[1:09:05] happened
[1:09:06] unless Mary believe the impossible I
[1:09:14] mean and what I mean by that and the
[1:09:17] word impossible means incapable of
[1:09:21] occurring in other words cannot be done
[1:09:27] when you say something's impossible that
[1:09:29] means this cannot be done and when when
[1:09:33] I think about you know Mary situation if
[1:09:37] there was ever anything that could not
[1:09:40] be done it's impossible for a virgin to
[1:09:43] conceive
[1:09:44] now that's something that ain't gonna
[1:09:45] happen that I'm sorry
[1:09:48] we know how children are born it is
[1:09:51] impossible for a virgin to conceive and
[1:09:54] have a baby impossible butBut but when
[1:09:59] asked as marriage having this
[1:10:01] conversation with the angel my god she
[1:10:04] said how can these things be right the
[1:10:07] angel respond back say the Holy Spirit
[1:10:08] girl over shouting you and with the Holy
[1:10:10] Spirit over said that's what's gonna
[1:10:12] make this thing happen so so what what
[1:10:14] occurred is that God had to kind of get
[1:10:16] through all the thoughts go ahead to
[1:10:19] take his word and make that make it
[1:10:22] weenus way through all the thoughts and
[1:10:23] then settle down into a spirit where she
[1:10:26] could just say be it unto me according
[1:10:28] to thy word and when that occurred when
[1:10:32] that occur Mary got pregnant hallelujah
[1:10:36] it's just powerful to me big yes cuz I
[1:10:39] want to go a little further with this
[1:10:41] today because uh-uh uh-uh
[1:10:44] I'm getting way ahead of myself we know
[1:10:47] that with with with God nothing is
[1:10:49] impossible
[1:10:50] we know that however we also need to
[1:10:53] know that with you nothing is impossible
[1:10:57] and what we're trying to do is work
[1:11:00] through the your mind and and all your
[1:11:03] your your your your memories and your
[1:11:05] reasoning in your Amen and and
[1:11:07] everything that the devil is using you
[1:11:09] they're using against you to stop you
[1:11:12] from believing that with you nothing is
[1:11:15] impossible
[1:11:17] well we got the part with God but with
[1:11:20] you all right
[1:11:23] let's read let's read this let's get all
[1:11:25] this amen out from Luke 1 and in the
[1:11:30] sixth month the angel gamer's 26 is
[1:11:33] where I'm at in a sixth month the angel
[1:11:35] Gabriel was sent from God it's a city of
[1:11:38] Galilee named Nazareth verse 27 to a
[1:11:41] virgin a spouse she was she was to be
[1:11:43] married a man to man whose name was
[1:11:46] Joseph of the house of David and the
[1:11:49] virgin Virgin's name was Mary
[1:11:52] the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[1:11:55] came in unto her and said hail Dow that
[1:12:00] are highly favored the Lord is with thee
[1:12:04] blessed art thou among women and just
[1:12:09] imagine her talking to this angel right
[1:12:11] and when she saw him the angel him amen
[1:12:16] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[1:12:19] saying and casting her mind what naina
[1:12:22] of salutation this should be let's get
[1:12:25] it amen and the angel said unto her fear
[1:12:28] not and I not just fear not but when he
[1:12:32] called her name it brought a peace and
[1:12:36] when God is able to call your name fear
[1:12:40] not fear not near my eye fear not just
[1:12:47] the Laura you're not just a Mary right
[1:12:52] fear not brother Josue when he calls
[1:12:56] your name like that it just kind of
[1:12:59] brings a piece that that settles you
[1:13:02] hallelujah right since the search says
[1:13:05] and the angel senator fear not Mary for
[1:13:09] thou hast found favour with God now I
[1:13:13] want you to understand Mary at this time
[1:13:15] that what history says she was only
[1:13:17] about 16 17 or 18 years old now that's
[1:13:21] important to me a man being a virgin at
[1:13:26] this age and in
[1:13:27] and preparing to get married amen but
[1:13:31] it's important to me because God
[1:13:32] sometimes is able to speak certain
[1:13:36] things to the young people right where
[1:13:39] where their minds are not as messed up
[1:13:42] or cannot use the word polluted Amen
[1:13:48] that it sometimes it's very easy for
[1:13:50] younger people to say things like be it
[1:13:52] unto me according to thy word they not
[1:13:55] working through a lot of nonsense Oh
[1:13:57] hallelujah right there if I could put it
[1:14:01] this way their mind is still virgin and
[1:14:07] when you're walking with God when you're
[1:14:09] when you're dealing with God right when
[1:14:12] you're at when you're having
[1:14:13] relationship with God your mind has to
[1:14:16] be virgin to the things of God you
[1:14:20] cannot mix doubt with the word of God it
[1:14:25] has to be pure if God promises something
[1:14:30] in his word all you have to respond with
[1:14:33] this with a Amen you only have two acts
[1:14:38] how can this be no God said it hey man
[1:14:45] let's go on let's read this verse 30 and
[1:14:50] the angel said to her fear not Mary for
[1:14:52] thou has found favor with God and the
[1:14:54] hold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:14:56] bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:14:59] name Jesus
[1:15:01] which meant yea yahweh is salvation
[1:15:03] right he shall be great and shall be
[1:15:07] called the son of the highest and the
[1:15:09] Lord God shall give unto Him the throne
[1:15:12] of his father David right and he shall
[1:15:16] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[1:15:18] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:15:22] listen it says then said Marian's an
[1:15:25] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[1:15:29] not a man right and they ain't you
[1:15:32] answer to set in earth the Holy Ghost I
[1:15:35] told you all on Friday night this is new
[1:15:37] language they had never heard anything
[1:15:39] about the holy ghost but here you know
[1:15:42] here but the Angels uses the Holy Ghost
[1:15:44] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:15:47] the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:15:49] therefore also that holy thing which
[1:15:51] shall be born of these they shall be
[1:15:54] called the Son of God now look at this
[1:15:57] and behold Ock and I love the way that
[1:15:58] the angel does this because it's still
[1:16:00] probably in Maris mind you got to read
[1:16:02] between the lines of their mind like I
[1:16:04] ain't never heard of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] how's the Holy Ghost got overshadow me
[1:16:07] when I'm not too experienced imma what's
[1:16:09] gonna happen here I mean what is what is
[1:16:11] this all about so so while she's going
[1:16:13] through that in her mind the angel
[1:16:15] counting stops it gives her testimony
[1:16:18] hallelujah because you know a testimony
[1:16:20] can actually settle you like cannot can
[1:16:26] I put it this way a testimony can make
[1:16:29] you believe for the impossible
[1:16:31] a testimony has a way of igniting your
[1:16:35] face and they say if God can do it for
[1:16:39] them and God has no respect of persons
[1:16:42] then I know the same God is gonna do it
[1:16:45] for me
[1:16:46] testimonies do that hallelujah
[1:16:50] that's why I don't ever let the devil
[1:16:52] take your testimony don't let the devil
[1:16:55] tell you well ain't nobody else talking
[1:16:57] so you need to stop talking no don't you
[1:16:59] don't know who need to hear what you
[1:17:02] need to say don't let the devil take
[1:17:04] your testimony the devil to give you the
[1:17:07] testimony so don't let the devil take
[1:17:10] the testimony hallelujah look at the
[1:17:16] testimony he says him behold my cousin
[1:17:19] Elizabeth now the angel knows this
[1:17:21] behold our cousin Elizabeth she had also
[1:17:25] conceived a son in her old age that
[1:17:27] marason I know she never had no children
[1:17:29] you mean to tell me Elizabeth is
[1:17:32] pregnant now now see you got you got a
[1:17:34] there's a reason for this God has
[1:17:37] connected to impossible situations
[1:17:42] here's the thing when Mary hears that
[1:17:45] Elizabeth can have a baby and I
[1:17:48] have to use it in today's terms oh this
[1:17:52] is you not know you you said Elizabeth
[1:18:00] you do you know I oh she you say she's
[1:18:03] pregnant ain't you saying behold our
[1:18:07] custom Elizabeth she has also conceived
[1:18:09] a son in her old age and this is the
[1:18:11] sixth month with her listen who was
[1:18:14] called barren she was called barren the
[1:18:16] CEO you're not wearing that name no more
[1:18:19] see I mean you can call me bear when I
[1:18:22] ain't got no children but when I bring
[1:18:24] forth a child that title is dismissed
[1:18:28] hallelujah amen I don't know what the
[1:18:31] devil been trying to call you but when
[1:18:33] God delivers you that title has been
[1:18:35] dismissed maybe the devil tried to call
[1:18:39] you broke but we've got put money in
[1:18:42] your pocket that title is dismissed
[1:18:47] leave the devil trying to call you a
[1:18:49] cancer patient but when God brings
[1:18:52] healing to your body their title is
[1:18:56] dismissed
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:59] hallelujah somebody no no that's what
[1:19:05] you used to call me but God has done
[1:19:08] something impossible can't be done
[1:19:13] we talk we talk about God and when you
[1:19:18] when you're using the word God you
[1:19:19] cannot use the word Kate
[1:19:26] you can't do it
[1:19:28] I told there's only one thing that God
[1:19:32] cannot do God came live and you know
[1:19:38] when Mary got pregnant Mary was the
[1:19:41] fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 and God said
[1:19:45] and I've said throughout this prophecy
[1:19:46] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:19:48] to hold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:19:50] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:19:53] when God spoke that some virgin
[1:19:55] somewhere had to receive that because
[1:19:59] God could not lie I'm going on in this
[1:20:03] story I'm gonna try to go a little
[1:20:04] further here today if I can look at this
[1:20:08] verse verse 36 again and behold thy
[1:20:09] cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived
[1:20:11] a son in her old age and this is the
[1:20:14] sixth month with her who was called
[1:20:16] barren and loves what the angel says for
[1:20:20] with God for with God Mary Mary I want
[1:20:24] you to get this mayor we're not through
[1:20:26] you ain't got nothing to do with this
[1:20:28] Mary that's why we're not worshiping
[1:20:30] Mary
[1:20:31] Mary was just a barroom see how to
[1:20:36] borrow room and he had to borrow two
[1:20:40] there's all just bone and where he using
[1:20:43] you he just borrowing you he can do this
[1:20:47] all by himself but once he use it he's
[1:20:51] just borrowing you god but he borrow a
[1:20:55] womb to be born in and there was a
[1:20:57] purpose for that the reason that he had
[1:20:59] to have a womb to come through is
[1:21:01] because in order to redeem fallen man oh
[1:21:05] my god this is what we're seeing this
[1:21:08] whole story of Christmas a man was God
[1:21:11] being made flesh because you know when
[1:21:15] Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden God
[1:21:17] came down now remember God can't go
[1:21:19] against his word hallelujah God can't go
[1:21:21] guesswork when God told Adam the day you
[1:21:24] either out the day you die that's what
[1:21:26] that's when they're saying it as soon as
[1:21:28] they partook of that tree amen
[1:21:32] I'm trying to be good if I could just go
[1:21:39] look further I'm gonna try to go too far
[1:21:42] but everybody in here know ain't no way
[1:21:45] Eve ate an apple and got pregnant come
[1:21:52] on now you tell me a story like that
[1:21:54] when I go to church and I hear a story
[1:21:57] like that you are insulting my
[1:21:59] intelligence it's impossible now that's
[1:22:05] what that's something impossible
[1:22:07] ain't no way somebody ate a fruit in the
[1:22:10] beginning whether it's an apple or an
[1:22:12] apricot or whatever you want to call it
[1:22:15] banana ain't no way to eat that and got
[1:22:17] pregnant because if they did then they
[1:22:20] should be still doing it now and we know
[1:22:26] it has only been two forms of pregnancy
[1:22:28] in the Bible - two forms one of them is
[1:22:34] what Mary's going through the Holy
[1:22:36] Spirit overshadowing her and she bring
[1:22:39] forth the son only child ever born like
[1:22:41] that through pregnancy because Adam won
[1:22:46] I mean
[1:22:47] well actually what I said this is that's
[1:22:49] deep Kanaka I can say it this way in
[1:22:53] God's mind he was pregnant with Adam
[1:22:57] before Adam came forth God had the
[1:23:00] thought in his mind who Adam was gonna
[1:23:02] be but God then carried in his in a
[1:23:05] physical wound God just made him right
[1:23:09] and then he took a rib out of even I
[1:23:11] mean out of Adam and me it made Eve from
[1:23:14] that but now the only other way people
[1:23:16] get pregnant is the same way you come
[1:23:18] here how you got here through a daddy
[1:23:23] and a mama come on somebody me man so
[1:23:28] I'm gonna tell you that Cain got here
[1:23:30] through a daddy and a mama
[1:23:32] Seth Abel Abel got here through a daddy
[1:23:36] and a mama Seth got here through a daddy
[1:23:39] and a mama the only mystery here is we
[1:23:42] need to know who was Kings daddy because
[1:23:47] the Bible declares that came was of that
[1:23:52] wicked one Oh some of y'all know your
[1:23:55] Bible in here well we know Adam one
[1:23:58] wicked because Adam was a son of God and
[1:24:02] even in his fallenness state he was
[1:24:05] still
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:10] so we we need to we need to find out who
[1:24:17] Keynes daddy is can I go back to my
[1:24:22] subject matter if you still got
[1:24:27] questions keep coming to church I will
[1:24:29] answer them for you through the
[1:24:30] preaching of the word amen so here in
[1:24:34] verse 37 says for with God nothing shall
[1:24:38] be impossible we talk about God we talk
[1:24:40] about God with God I mean a virgin can
[1:24:43] actually have a baby through God now now
[1:24:47] now now we're not looking for somebody
[1:24:49] else to jump up you know that's a virgin
[1:24:52] and say well you know what I'm pregnant
[1:24:54] now what would be the purpose what
[1:24:56] scripts are you fulfilling that's not
[1:25:01] what we're looking for there was only we
[1:25:03] only needed one virgin to bring forth
[1:25:05] Christ and that's already happening amen
[1:25:08] but but I want you to understand when
[1:25:09] you think about Christmas when you think
[1:25:11] about what happened it took a miracle
[1:25:14] and-and-and-and and at Christmas can I
[1:25:16] tell you something you might be facing
[1:25:18] something right now in your life and you
[1:25:21] stop trying to figure out how in the
[1:25:22] world I'm gonna get through this I mean
[1:25:25] I don't I don't know I don't know I I
[1:25:26] can't see your way out you might be you
[1:25:30] might be saying that to yourself right
[1:25:31] now whether it's a financial thing with
[1:25:33] us a physical thing whether you know
[1:25:35] what no matter what it is you might be
[1:25:36] saying if this is just impossible I want
[1:25:38] to tell you according to the Bible with
[1:25:42] God that's there now that's a key key
[1:25:47] statement sit with God because if you
[1:25:50] try to do this without God it is
[1:25:53] impossible but with God nothing that can
[1:25:58] I put the jacked up version nothing
[1:26:02] absolutely nothing shall be impossible
[1:26:05] oh my god I love that I don't care what
[1:26:10] you facing it's not it's not impossible
[1:26:13] Amen when you when you talk about
[1:26:15] working with God ain't nothing
[1:26:17] impossible and nothing he can heal the
[1:26:20] sickest of the sick not not only can
[1:26:24] heal the secrets I said even if they die
[1:26:30] if they God he can raise them I say with
[1:26:37] God nothing is impossible
[1:26:40] Jesus let's go on and Mary said after
[1:26:44] she heard all this from the angel of
[1:26:45] Mary said Behold the handmaid of the
[1:26:48] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:26:52] and the angel departed from her so once
[1:26:54] it reached through a man heard it
[1:26:58] settled in her mind and finally you know
[1:27:01] she's accepted us in the womb of her
[1:27:02] spirit now this promise can go a man
[1:27:05] into a thing and let's see what happens
[1:27:07] here verse 39 and Mary arose Mountain
[1:27:10] this is what when a thing settles then
[1:27:11] you get the revelation of what God has
[1:27:13] done and what is gearing to do for you
[1:27:14] Mary arose in those days and went into
[1:27:17] the hill country with haste look at that
[1:27:20] into the city of Judah and entered into
[1:27:23] the house of Zechariah and saluted
[1:27:26] Elizabeth right so here married knew
[1:27:28] exactly where to go and so she's going
[1:27:30] to talk to you Lizabeth her cousin and
[1:27:32] it came to pass that when Elizabeth
[1:27:34] heard the salutation of Mary the babe
[1:27:39] leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was
[1:27:42] filled with the Holy Ghost oh wait a
[1:27:44] minute we got now Mary's being
[1:27:45] overshadowed with the Holy Ghost of nine
[1:27:47] Lizabeth being filled with the Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost just by hearing from Mary look at
[1:27:50] this
[1:27:51] and she spake out with a loud voice oh
[1:27:53] my god my god that's why they don't come
[1:27:56] to church with just sophomores come to
[1:27:57] church were still out but if God done
[1:27:59] done something for you you ought to give
[1:28:01] him your loud voice
[1:28:05] hallelujah glory to God it says and she
[1:28:09] speak out with a loud voice and said
[1:28:10] blessed art thou among women and blessed
[1:28:13] is the fruit of thy womb and and whence
[1:28:16] is this whence is this to me that the
[1:28:19] mother my lord should come to me for
[1:28:22] slow for lower suitors divorce of my
[1:28:24] salutation sound in my ears the babe
[1:28:26] leaped in my womb for Jordan you had to
[1:28:28] be able to read between the the lines on
[1:28:30] that one right because the salutation
[1:28:32] was probably Mary telling Elizabeth I
[1:28:35] heard you was pregnant I didn't even but
[1:28:42] before this you got to read a few verses
[1:28:43] point Elizabeth wasn't hiding she was in
[1:28:48] hiding nobody nobody would have known
[1:28:50] this her husband knew it all right and
[1:28:53] as they say but but but Elizabeth I mean
[1:28:56] she was in highness Oh Mary Mary sir now

[1:28:59] minute Mary well my marriage what you

[1:29:22] I'm having some problems my pregnancy

[1:29:33] y'all this way I don't have so many
[1:29:36] problems with so many pregnancies and
[1:29:39] maybe maybe Elizabeth I've lost this
[1:29:41] baby and lost that baby maybe she's
[1:29:43] thinking to herself again I'm about to
[1:29:45] lose another one

[1:32:35] in the scripture this why we read this
[1:32:38] in the scripture
[1:32:39] oh my god my god I love God's words amen
[1:32:44] verse 43 and which Winston is this to me
[1:32:47] that the mother my lord should come to

[1:33:41] child can hear the arguments that the
[1:33:44] child can hear the discussions the child
[1:33:47] can not only hear but the child can feel
[1:33:49] whether you love mama don't love and
[1:33:55] sometimes the child might Amen you might
[1:33:58] be saying things a certain way in the
[1:33:59] children start acting a certain way
[1:34:01] even in Mama's room they act in a
[1:34:03] certain way because they hear how things
[1:34:05] are happening in the home
[1:34:06] come on somebody that's why you got to
[1:34:10] be careful how you handle things in the
[1:34:12] home the children can hear as soon as I

[1:36:29] season there shall be a performance of
[1:36:33] those things that were told you by the
[1:36:36] Lord and I'm telling you right now I
[1:36:42] want to make it so clear
[1:36:45] nothing nothing absolutely nothing shall
[1:36:57] be impossible nothing and and and you
[1:37:13] know we've seen some some some things
[1:37:15] that we we've been up against when you
[1:37:18] just sit back and just reflect on
[1:37:20] Christmas just just stop and think about
[1:37:22] this nothing church if a virgin can have
[1:37:30] a baby virgin no serious anything like
[1:37:39] this happened I was just reading a few
[1:37:41] things you know I'm I'm not gonna get to
[1:37:43] where I want to go over that's fine I
[1:37:45] wanted you all to just kind of catch a
[1:37:47] couple statements here this is a sermon
[1:37:50] Jehovah of miracles Jehovah of miracles
[1:37:56] let me just catch a couple things and
[1:37:58] then I'll bring it home
[1:38:00] I'm gonna start at paragraph e28 Jehovah
[1:38:03] miracles just let me read this and and
[1:38:05] will will will depart this is not angel
[1:38:09] Gabriel six months later had had visit
[1:38:11] married and told her that her cousin was
[1:38:14] going to have a baby also so Mary knew
[1:38:16] that would be a miracle of that old
[1:38:21] woman well stricken an age having a baby
[1:38:24] but she said to the angel I said and I
[1:38:27] love that God had to use Elizabeth in
[1:38:30] order to be able to help Mary
[1:38:33] believe cuz had she not believed this
[1:38:37] would have never happened
[1:38:39] Amen God will not God will not limb for
[1:38:46] this with God as a gentleman he has to
[1:38:48] be invited in he won't force himself on
[1:38:51] nobody so God will not go he worked up
[1:38:55] himself on Mary
[1:39:03] that would be considered great so God
[1:39:11] wasn't gone raped marry spiritually
[1:39:16] because this was not a physical act
[1:39:18] this was his whole spiritual act and God
[1:39:21] will not rape you spiritually you have
[1:39:23] to heal yourself together
[1:39:31] Mary knew that that would be a miracle
[1:39:34] of that old woman well stricken an age
[1:39:36] having a baby but she said to the angel
[1:39:37] how shall it be with me seeing that that
[1:39:40] I do not know a man and ask and you
[1:39:43] shall receive he said the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:46] going to overshadow you the holy thing
[1:39:48] which shall be born of you shall be
[1:39:50] called the son of God that's how it's
[1:39:52] gonna happen Mary never talked back to
[1:39:54] the angel she never discussed it in any
[1:39:57] way the only thing she said was behold
[1:40:00] the hands may the Lord be it unto me
[1:40:02] according to thy word did you think even
[1:40:06] the priest Zacharias had questioned him
[1:40:09] being an old man at her ode to his wife
[1:40:11] Elizabeth sakurai-san Elizabeth say how
[1:40:14] this would be done and a priest who
[1:40:17] should know the word and know what God
[1:40:20] did but this virgin was just a child and
[1:40:24] she had no husband she had to believe
[1:40:26] the Impossibles something that had never
[1:40:30] happened before me but she never argued
[1:40:33] she never questioned anymore his word
[1:40:36] was enough for her oh my god and and I
[1:40:39] see there's another state me say he said
[1:40:41] to Mary the word was sufficient for her
[1:40:44] and what I want to ask you are you
[1:40:46] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:40:49] your mix if you are sufficiently
[1:40:53] impressed with the word in your mix then
[1:40:56] you know it's also not impossible
[1:41:00] cleaning the fulfill for you nothing's
[1:41:03] impossible for you it's the word of your
[1:41:06] missus bringing you back to that alright
[1:41:09] alright listen listen listen it says oh
[1:41:12] if this church could just get like that
[1:41:15] the word
[1:41:16] settles it if God said so that's all we
[1:41:19] need to know how is it going to be I
[1:41:21] can't tell you but if God said so it's
[1:41:24] gonna be that way because God's that so
[1:41:26] oh that's what I want the church to know
[1:41:29] if there's anything I want you to stink
[1:41:32] faith in is in what God said it has to
[1:41:35] be true
[1:41:36] look at this did you notice she had to
[1:41:39] believe the Impossibles she could not go
[1:41:41] back like Zachariah could he could have
[1:41:43] went back to Sarah and Sarah I was
[1:41:45] almost a hundred years hundred when when
[1:41:47] she had the baby Hannah at the temple
[1:41:49] she was an old woman too and they had
[1:41:52] plenty examples of that where they had
[1:41:54] husbands but Mary had to believe
[1:41:55] something that never had happened you
[1:42:02] got thousands of examples divine healing
[1:42:05] looking at people been healed with
[1:42:07] cancer blindness dumbness deafness all
[1:42:10] kinds of sicknesses and diseases we've
[1:42:13] got plenty of that to look at as an
[1:42:15] example but this little girl didn't have
[1:42:18] nothing but just his word and that was
[1:42:20] the fishing his word was good enough for
[1:42:24] her and I want you to notice she didn't
[1:42:27] wait till she was positive it was going
[1:42:31] to happen
[1:42:31] she started testifying about it right
[1:42:35] away she didn't wait to feel life she
[1:42:40] didn't wait till she felt life so she so
[1:42:42] she could be positive she was going to
[1:42:44] have the baby
[1:42:45] just as soon as she heard his word she
[1:42:49] took him at his word and she started
[1:42:52] testifying and praising God for the baby
[1:42:55] before she felt anything leave you with
[1:43:01] this one give us mo Mary's
[1:43:04] give us more Mary's Lord and at
[1:43:08] Christmas give us mo Mary's give us mo
[1:43:12] Mary's around here that can take God at
[1:43:16] His Word and praise Him whether you feel
[1:43:20] anything or not
[1:43:21] now you know you got you gotta praise
[1:43:24] them when you feel good you can praise
[1:43:28] them when you fit back in actually
[1:43:30] that's a better priest
[1:43:32] oh come on somebody you can praise them
[1:43:35] when you ain't got nothing that's a
[1:43:37] better priest than when you got
[1:43:38] something because that's a priest of
[1:43:40] sacrifice to give us more mary's around
[1:43:50] here that can take God at His Word and
[1:43:51] praise them whether you feel anything or
[1:43:53] not take him at his word God's trying to
[1:43:56] find somebody who would take his word I
[1:43:58] don't care how you feel someone say well
[1:44:00] I don't feel any better I went to the
[1:44:03] meat and I was grateful that don't have
[1:44:04] nothing to do do with it God said so and
[1:44:06] that settles it a man somebody who would
[1:44:10] take his word that's what pleases him
[1:44:12] believe his word that's what pleases God
[1:44:14] that's the only way you would ever find
[1:44:17] favor with him
[1:44:18] see remember the scripture that that
[1:44:21] said blessed art thou marry thou has
[1:44:23] found favor with God if you want to find
[1:44:26] favor with God
[1:44:27] then he says that that's what pleased
[1:44:29] God that's the only way you'll ever find
[1:44:30] favor with him his believers weren't and
[1:44:33] say God knew God knew that this marry a
[1:44:36] man even even the Prophet told us how
[1:44:39] she went to church that day and maybe
[1:44:41] the priest was already reading
[1:44:42] scriptures you know in church today
[1:44:45] maybe reading Isaiah 7:14 and maybe even
[1:44:47] reading Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child
[1:44:49] is born to us a son is given and the
[1:44:53] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:44:54] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:44:56] counsellor the mighty God the
[1:44:58] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:45:00] maybe she heard those things written in
[1:45:02] church that then she said mine's just
[1:45:03] something about the word that she was
[1:45:05] talking with Joseph she just discussed
[1:45:07] no scriptures and and say why she was
[1:45:09] talking about it that's why the angel
[1:45:10] came upon it hallelujah amen
[1:45:14] God give us some more Mary's that just
[1:45:16] when you hear God give you a word what
[1:45:18] was his word nothing shall be impossible
[1:45:21] that's God's word to you and if you just
[1:45:24] hear that and apply it to your situation
[1:45:26] at like Mary start testifying find
[1:45:30] somebody that has already been done for
[1:45:34] and start talking to them don't talk
[1:45:36] nobody never happened to them the phone
[1:45:38] they can't encourage you they never seen
[1:45:42] God make away but you go find somebody
[1:45:45] that this one happened to you befo tell
[1:45:47] me what happened tell me a little bit
[1:45:49] about the process and as they share with
[1:45:52] you it annoys your thing and you know
[1:45:55] what you begin to do believe God for the
[1:45:57] impossible
[1:45:59] can I tell you something if you're gonna
[1:46:01] use the word impossible you have to
[1:46:04] include the word tell your neighbor if
[1:46:10] you're gonna use the word impossible you
[1:46:14] have to include the word possible do
[1:46:24] this cross they cross and Christ out of
[1:46:26] Christmas watch across the I am offer
[1:46:28] possible if you're gonna use the word
[1:46:33] impossible you have to include the word
[1:46:38] possible I'm announcing it again I said
[1:46:43] it before but I must say it again
[1:46:46] nothing absolutely nothing shall be
[1:46:52] impossible with God
[1:47:04] musicians y'all can come in and let me
[1:47:07] just read one scripture for ya I didn't
[1:47:09] get a chance to hit this maybe the Lord
[1:47:11] will let me do it at a different time
[1:47:13] but I'll just read this Matthew 17 sees
[1:47:16] everything and in Jesus life was a
[1:47:19] miracle his birth was the miracle his
[1:47:21] death was a miracle he died and rose
[1:47:22] again that was a miracle throughout his
[1:47:25] life and just so many miracle after
[1:47:27] miracle after miracle after miracle just
[1:47:29] full of miracles but it wasn't just his
[1:47:33] it wasn't his purpose just to come and
[1:47:36] just kind of demonstrate and show all of
[1:47:38] his miracles he was trying to show us as
[1:47:41] men and as women of God what we were
[1:47:44] restored back to what Adam and Eve
[1:47:46] lost in the beginning Jesus came to give
[1:47:48] it all back to us and this is what he
[1:47:51] said even while he was here on earth if
[1:47:53] they had a little problem with the
[1:47:55] disciples let's read this a man in
[1:47:57] Matthew 17 verse 14 I'll read this now
[1:48:00] I'll close it out I won't be able to go
[1:48:03] too deep in it but it says and when they
[1:48:05] were come to the multitude there came to
[1:48:07] him a certain man kneeling down to him
[1:48:09] and saying lord have mercy on my son
[1:48:11] for he is a lunatic and sore vexed for
[1:48:14] all times he falleth into the fire and
[1:48:17] oft into the water and I and I brought
[1:48:19] him to that disciples and they could not
[1:48:21] cure him amen
[1:48:25] so did these people they knew they had a
[1:48:26] problem and they need to get to a
[1:48:28] particular place to get that problem
[1:48:29] solved
[1:48:30] I want this church to be problem solvers
[1:48:33] oh gotta be able to bring there there's
[1:48:37] there situations here and have them
[1:48:39] dealt with and we're we're equipped to
[1:48:43] know that yeah you don't have to be a
[1:48:44] Christian to get a miracle but if you
[1:48:47] want to keep your miracle you need to
[1:48:50] become a Christian hey man listen he
[1:48:52] says and I brought him to the other
[1:48:54] cycles they could not cure him then
[1:48:56] jesus answered and said o faithless and
[1:48:58] perverse generation how long should I be
[1:49:01] with you how long shall I suffer you
[1:49:03] bring him hither to me Jesus when
[1:49:05] running from nothing amen and Jesus
[1:49:08] rebuked the devil and he departed out of
[1:49:11] him and the child was cured from that
[1:49:14] very hour then came two disciples to
[1:49:16] Jesus apart and said why could not we
[1:49:19] cast him out I notice they did that
[1:49:20] privately hallelujah
[1:49:23] even want to embarrass him they did that
[1:49:25] they asked a question properly why could
[1:49:27] we not cast him out and Jesus said unto
[1:49:30] them so there's not for everybody but
[1:49:33] y'all included in the devil
[1:49:35] jesus said of them because of your
[1:49:37] unbelief that's why we got to get this
[1:49:39] thing through the womb of your spirit
[1:49:41] amen
[1:49:42] because of your unbelief for verily I
[1:49:44] sent you if you have faith as a grain of
[1:49:47] mustard seed and y'all got mustard seed
[1:49:50] with y'all Bible if you have faith as a
[1:49:53] grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto
[1:49:55] this mountain remove hence to yonder
[1:49:59] place
[1:49:59] and it shall remove there it is Jesus is
[1:50:04] teaching us nothing shall be impossible
[1:50:10] unto you we know nothing is impossible
[1:50:14] into God but now we need to take it up
[1:50:16] another notch nothing is impossible unto
[1:50:21] you he said howbeit this kind goeth not
[1:50:26] out but by prayer and fasting and in
[1:50:32] fact it just get one other thing I mean

[1:51:04] even in you to the end of the age Christ

[1:51:48] our you know just negative everything

[1:51:54] we get to the place that Mary can give
[1:51:56] us some more marriage they can just stop
[1:51:57] tie them out be it unto me according to
[1:52:01] your word God that's what I want
[1:52:04] that's what I meet amen amen
[1:52:09] let's pray
[1:52:15] or this this Christmas season is upon us
[1:52:19] and yes we have understanding and
[1:52:23] revelation that you did not come from
[1:52:28] December 25th that's that's a pagan
[1:52:31] tradition that was introduced a number
[1:52:33] of years ago when God is here to stay no
[1:52:36] way that will get people away from it
[1:52:37] but what I'm grateful for O God is that
[1:52:40] we get an opportunity to talk about you
[1:52:42] the world has put you out
[1:52:46] they have excluded you in so many things
[1:52:49] we can't talk about you in the workplace
[1:52:51] certain places that we go we can't
[1:52:54] mention the name Jesus God here amen at
[1:52:58] this time everybody gets an opportunity
[1:53:00] to say something and oh god help us Lord
[1:53:04] to just be able to share the light of
[1:53:07] Christmas and what it's all about a
[1:53:09] virgin actually conceived and bore child
[1:53:11] it took a miracle for Christmas to occur
[1:53:15] it was nothing short of a miracle and
[1:53:19] God if we look at that we look at it
[1:53:23] father Lord we can take faith and take
[1:53:28] courage and have our faith anoint it to
[1:53:31] believe for the impossible things that
[1:53:33] Satan told us it'll never happen that
[1:53:36] can't happen that that I mean you can't
[1:53:39] have that job you can't do this you
[1:53:41] can't do no no no we don't have to
[1:53:43] listen to any of that but with God
[1:53:45] there's nothing impossible
[1:53:46] and now that we know that you're also
[1:53:48] dueling on the inside of us Lord there's
[1:53:52] nothing impossible that's either that's
[1:53:54] what you just why you were you on earth
[1:53:55] let us walk according to this God let us
[1:53:59] come to this place where we would no
[1:54:03] longer doubt but we will stand like Mary
[1:54:07] regardless of our impossible sounds will
[1:54:09] stand and say via them to me according
[1:54:12] to thy word and not just saying but
[1:54:14] really mean it with all of our hearts
[1:54:18] Lord we love you we thank you for your
[1:54:23] birth we thank you for your life we
[1:54:28] thank you for your death and most
[1:54:31] importantly we thank you for rising

[1:54:38] religion our founder did exactly what he
[1:54:41] said he said take this temple destroy it
[1:54:44] but I'll raise it up in three days and
