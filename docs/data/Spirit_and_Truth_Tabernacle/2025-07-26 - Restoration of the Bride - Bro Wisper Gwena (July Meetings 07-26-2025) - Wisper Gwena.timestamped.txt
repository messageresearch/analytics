[1:09:49] Precious Father
[1:09:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:55] Father, we approach your throne of grace
[1:09:57] at this time.
[1:10:00] We're so thankful, Father, for the grace
[1:10:02] that you've given us, Lord, to be here.
[1:10:06] We thankful, Father, for everyone that
[1:10:09] has made it to these meetings.
[1:10:13] More so, oh God, we thank you for
[1:10:15] brother Jack
[1:10:18] with his spirit and truth tabernacle.
[1:10:21] Father, for putting this burden upon
[1:10:24] their hearts that they can have these
[1:10:27] meetings.
[1:10:29] We thank you for amazing grace.
[1:10:33] How sweet it sounds.
[1:10:36] You serve the wretched people such as
[1:10:38] us.
[1:10:40] Once we're lost,
[1:10:42] but thank God we are found.
[1:10:45] Once we're blind,
[1:10:47] but thank God we can see.
[1:10:51] Lord,
[1:10:53] what an honor and what a privilege it is
[1:10:56] to be identified with your holy precious
[1:10:58] name.
[1:11:00] Father, we come before your throne now
[1:11:04] coming to this part Lord that we can
[1:11:07] never be able to handle.
[1:11:09] We invite you that you can step in. Oh
[1:11:12] God, come and take control.
[1:11:15] Come and have preeminence in this place.
[1:11:18] Lord, we surrender ourselves to you in
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And all
[1:11:24] the saints shall say,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; amen and amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I greet you all in the
[1:11:30] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:11:31] Christ.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So glad to to be here together
[1:11:35] with you. You may be seated.
[1:11:39] Amen.
[1:11:41] Just want to appreciate um brother Jack
[1:11:45] for the invitation for for us to to come
[1:11:48] to these meetings. Um came together with
[1:11:52] my wife sitting somewhere at the back
[1:11:54] there and um with some saints from the
[1:11:57] spoken word ministries in in London and
[1:12:01] um also some of our friends that um
[1:12:06] follow us online. Amen. And I've got a
[1:12:09] good friend of mine all the way from
[1:12:11] Australia together with his family. Um
[1:12:14] just came for the meetings. Amen. Um
[1:12:19] just so glad that we can all be here to
[1:12:21] to fellowship with you.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many have enjoyed the meetings
[1:12:25] this far?
[1:12:33] I'm so glad that South Florida has
[1:12:36] decided to carry on with the vision of
[1:12:39] brother Wesco.
[1:12:43] You know, I first came to Florida
[1:12:46] uh maybe some 20 or so years ago and um
[1:12:51] I came at the invitation of brother
[1:12:53] Wesco
[1:12:54] and just to be back again and see that
[1:12:58] you you're carrying on with exactly the
[1:13:00] same vision, it just gives me a lot of
[1:13:03] joy.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just appreciate the Lord for
[1:13:06] that.
[1:13:12] The first time that we came into
[1:13:15] Florida,
[1:13:16] uh we we just fell in love with the
[1:13:19] place and uh my children, they really
[1:13:22] loved the place from back then and uh
[1:13:26] you've attracted them to here now.
[1:13:29] So, they're now part of uh the Florida
[1:13:32] team.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh
[1:13:40] By God's grace, I now have three
[1:13:44] grandchildren
[1:13:46] that are born in Florida.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So that makes Florida home to us.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a pool that comes with
[1:14:00] these grandchildren.
[1:14:02] They just pull you to come to where you
[1:14:04] you you don't even want to come in
[1:14:06] certain times.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Florida has become second home
[1:14:10] for us
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; by the power of grandchildren.
[1:14:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. Um let's let's
[1:14:19] get to the word. I'm going to invite you
[1:14:21] to stand to your feet.
[1:14:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:30] Amen. You can follow with me on the
[1:14:33] projector screen. Um Joel chapter 2.
[1:14:39] Um we're going to read verse 25.
[1:14:43] And I'll restore to you the years that
[1:14:45] the locust had eaten the cankerm and the
[1:14:48] caterpillar and the palmer. My great
[1:14:51] army which I sent among you. And then in
[1:14:55] the book of Revelations chapter 1
[1:14:58] verse 10 and 11, I was in the spirit on
[1:15:02] the Lord's day. And I heard behind me a
[1:15:05] great voices of a trumpet, saying, I'm
[1:15:08] Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.
[1:15:12] And what thou seeest, write in a book,
[1:15:14] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:15:15] which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and
[1:15:18] unto Smea, unto Pergamos, and unto The
[1:15:21] Tyra, unto Sardis, and unto
[1:15:23] Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia.
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; May God add his blessing to the reading
[1:15:31] of his word. We may be seated
[1:15:36] as we bow our heads yet again.
[1:15:40] Father, we have read your word.
[1:15:44] We come, Lord, to this sacred part,
[1:15:47] the part that is beyond man.
[1:15:51] We can only depend on you, Lord. I pray
[1:15:54] that you can take over now. Lord,
[1:15:58] consume my inabilities with your great
[1:16:00] ability.
[1:16:02] Father, our weaknesses, hide them in
[1:16:05] you. Lord, I invite you to just take
[1:16:09] over from now. Father, we commit all
[1:16:12] things to thee. May we sit together in
[1:16:14] them heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:16:17] Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Allow me to just take off my jacket.
[1:16:41] Praise the Lord. I want to take a title
[1:16:45] tonight and I want to speak on a
[1:16:48] restoration of the bride.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for a subject, I'll be looking
[1:16:54] at the bride age.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet preached a message, the
[1:17:01] restoration of the bride. Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; But I want to look at it as just the
[1:17:07] restoration of the bride.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Let me start by taking a quote on what
[1:17:13] the prophet said, which is the quotation
[1:17:15] that was put on the flyer for the
[1:17:17] meetings. The prophet of God says in
[1:17:20] paragraph 473, somewhere in the middle
[1:17:22] there, he says, "That insect started on
[1:17:25] Luther to kill all the Lutheran
[1:17:28] branches. It come right over to Wesley
[1:17:31] and killed all the Wesley branches. But
[1:17:33] the main part of the tree keeps coming.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Now notice in the old time when the tree
[1:17:40] was killed, it was killed when plump to
[1:17:44] the roots when it killed it back then.
[1:17:46] But this time because the word is
[1:17:48] predestinated, there's nothing going to
[1:17:51] stop it.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] God said, "I will restore."
[1:17:59] No matter how much they organize, how
[1:18:02] much they do this, that or the other,
[1:18:05] I'm going to restore it. That settles
[1:18:08] it.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the prophet saying it. And
[1:18:12] that settles it for me.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God in the highest.
[1:18:17] Now here the prophet took the scripture
[1:18:20] of Joel and showed how the bride tree
[1:18:23] was attacked by these little rascal
[1:18:25] insects as he calls them. But God said I
[1:18:29] will restore.
[1:18:31] Now the allegory that the prophet used
[1:18:34] when he preached the message the bride
[1:18:36] tree he was using the tree amen as the
[1:18:39] allegory there. But by God's grace,
[1:18:42] tonight I want to look at the same
[1:18:44] process but from the point of view of
[1:18:46] the seven church ages.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Now, but before I get into the message,
[1:18:53] let me start by saying that when God
[1:18:56] gave us the Bible, he gave us a book
[1:19:00] like no other.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:05] The Bible is a packed book
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; which I believe we will never be able to
[1:19:11] fully understand.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We'll never be able to fully comprehend
[1:19:15] the Bible until we see him face to face.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; When we think we have gone so much into
[1:19:23] the Bible, then you come to find out
[1:19:25] we've only scratched the surface.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; We ain't even started to understand the
[1:19:30] word.
[1:19:31] You know, when when you've gone through
[1:19:33] the Bible so many times and then a
[1:19:36] preacher comes and he takes a scripture
[1:19:38] from an angle that you have never seen,
[1:19:40] that's when you realize how much little
[1:19:42] you know. Now I I'm talking about what
[1:19:46] happens to me.
[1:19:48] Because when these men of God stand to
[1:19:50] preach and I see them taking a scripture
[1:19:53] and I wonder, wow, was this in the word?
[1:19:56] And that tells me we only scratched the
[1:19:59] surface, church.
[1:20:01] Lord
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and that is when you realize that the
[1:20:04] Bible is a packed book
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; and indeed it is God in letter form.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Now God took time to detail things in
[1:20:14] the Bible and there is not a single word
[1:20:17] that he placed in the Bible that is for
[1:20:20] spare
[1:20:23] like you have a spare time.
[1:20:27] There is not a single word that is in
[1:20:29] the Bible that is for spare.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Every word that is placed in the Bible
[1:20:35] is very intentional.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Now when when you look at some Bible
[1:20:43] translations, they they don't get this.
[1:20:45] They don't understand this. And you know
[1:20:47] the way they look at the translations,
[1:20:49] you can see that they are looking at it
[1:20:51] from a logical point of view.
[1:20:56] And yet the Bible is not understood by
[1:20:59] logic.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; It is understood through revelation.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Spiritual things are spiritually
[1:21:07] discerned.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; What do you mean, preacher man? Let me
[1:21:10] give you an example of a scripture that
[1:21:12] we all know very well. Malachi chapter
[1:21:14] 4. The Bible says, "I'll send you Elijah
[1:21:17] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:21:19] great and dreadful day of the Lord. and
[1:21:21] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:21:23] to the children and the heart of the
[1:21:25] children to their fathers.
[1:21:28] Now we we we we we understand this very
[1:21:31] well because this is the foundation of
[1:21:33] the message of the hour.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; But when you go to other translations
[1:21:37] like when you look at the good news
[1:21:39] translation, look at the way they
[1:21:41] translate verse six,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; he says he will bring fathers and
[1:21:45] children together again.
[1:21:49] And they call this the good news
[1:21:51] translation. That's bad news translation
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; because you can see they have missed the
[1:22:00] revelation so completely. There
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; you go to the new century version. It
[1:22:09] says Elijah will help parents love their
[1:22:12] children and children love their
[1:22:14] parents.
[1:22:19] Sounds like an AI translation, isn't it?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Sounds like somebody just took
[1:22:28] the original Hebrew and they threw it
[1:22:30] into a chatbot and they said, "Please
[1:22:32] give me a translation that can easily be
[1:22:35] understood." And AI did its thing.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; AI don't have revelation.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Revelation is in the hearts of the
[1:22:44] believers.
[1:22:52] God help us. So you see when when you're
[1:22:56] looking at these Bible translations, you
[1:22:58] see that many of them, they miss
[1:23:00] important things in the Bible. But we
[1:23:03] thank God that when the prophet came, he
[1:23:06] left us with a recommended translation
[1:23:09] to use.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; How many know the prophet left us with a
[1:23:13] recommended translation to use?
[1:23:16] Or let me read what the prophet says. He
[1:23:18] says, "Here we find now in the Old
[1:23:20] Testament, there's many words in our New
[1:23:22] King James Version that seems very
[1:23:25] strange. But for me, the rest of you,
[1:23:27] brethren, can teach from any version you
[1:23:29] want to. But I like the King James.
[1:23:33] Just seems more like the Bible to me."
[1:23:38] Not only does he say this in the message
[1:23:40] Israel in the church, he says, "I'm
[1:23:43] satisfied to take the King James version
[1:23:46] for mine.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It's waved the storms longer than any
[1:23:50] translation yet." And I just believe it
[1:23:53] that way.
[1:23:55] Now, we are followers of Malachi 4. And
[1:23:58] if you are followers of Malachi 4, then
[1:24:00] we got to stick with the recommended
[1:24:02] translation,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; which is the King James translation.
[1:24:07] Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Now, when it comes to the way the Bible
[1:24:11] is written, words are not just placed
[1:24:14] anyhow.
[1:24:17] The Bible lays out certain words because
[1:24:20] there is a purpose behind it. The
[1:24:23] prophet of God says, "Now let this be
[1:24:25] known." Scripture does not play with
[1:24:28] words.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever is in the record is there for
[1:24:33] the anointed eyes to see. It is there
[1:24:36] for a purpose.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I pray that there be some anointed eyes
[1:24:40] in here tonight. Or do I have some
[1:24:43] anointed eyes in here tonight? He says,
[1:24:46] "Whatever is in the record is there for
[1:24:49] the anointed eyes to see. It is there
[1:24:52] for a purpose.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; So the words that are laid in the Bible,
[1:24:57] they are laid there for a purpose.
[1:25:00] Malachi 4 is laid out the way it is laid
[1:25:03] out because it is distinguishing two
[1:25:06] Elijah.
[1:25:08] Now when these people say for parents
[1:25:10] and children to love one another, they
[1:25:13] are missing the two Elijah in there.
[1:25:17] You cannot identify John's ministry and
[1:25:19] you cannot identify brother Brham's
[1:25:21] ministry when you say children and
[1:25:23] parents love one another.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible is written in order to bring
[1:25:30] out something important.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; In John 8:58, the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] said, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[1:25:42] Put that into a grammar check. They will
[1:25:44] say that this is totally wrong. The
[1:25:46] grammar is not correct.
[1:25:48] But Jesus was not looking at grammar.
[1:25:51] Jesus was looking at the word. What was
[1:25:53] he looking at? He was looking at the God
[1:25:56] of Moses who when Moses wanted to to
[1:25:59] know who shall I say has sent me. He
[1:26:02] said, I am that I am. So what Jesus was
[1:26:06] saying in John 8:58 was I am the God of
[1:26:09] Moses. I am the Jehovah of the Old
[1:26:12] Testament. who is the Jesus Christ of
[1:26:15] the new. So I am
[1:26:19] present tense God.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. When the
[1:26:25] prophet looks at the serpent seed, the
[1:26:27] way the words are arranged, the the
[1:26:29] prophet of God says here since three
[1:26:32] sons were born from two eggs by Adam,
[1:26:35] you know positively that one of those
[1:26:37] three was not the son of Adam. God has
[1:26:41] recorded this in this exact manner to
[1:26:44] show us something.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; So the prophet is teaching us here that
[1:26:50] when things are laid in the Bible, they
[1:26:52] are laid out in order to bring out
[1:26:54] something.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 17:9, the Bible
[1:27:02] tells me that this calls for a mind with
[1:27:04] wisdom.
[1:27:06] So when when you're a student of the
[1:27:07] word, it takes a mind with wisdom. You
[1:27:11] can't be simple and understand
[1:27:13] revelation. Can you say amen, somebody?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And this is not the wisdom of this
[1:27:18] world. It is the wisdom of God which
[1:27:22] comes by the Holy Ghost because it's the
[1:27:25] first of the nine spiritual gifts. Can
[1:27:27] you say amen?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So this calls for a mind that has got
[1:27:32] wisdom. But yet when you turn around,
[1:27:34] you also find the Bible says, "Amen, he
[1:27:38] has hidden these things from the wise
[1:27:40] and from the prudent, and he has
[1:27:42] revealed it unto babes such as we would
[1:27:45] learn."
[1:27:46] So there is a revelation that comes to
[1:27:48] babes and that revelation, it comes
[1:27:51] through the wisdom of the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:54] Can you say amen?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Christ said to you it is given to
[1:28:00] understand the mysteries of the kingdom.
[1:28:03] Ain't you glad, church, that to you it
[1:28:05] is given to understand the mysteries of
[1:28:07] the kingdom? Ain't you glad, church,
[1:28:10] that you have an ability within you to
[1:28:13] catch revelation.
[1:28:15] You have an ability within you to read
[1:28:18] in between the lines.
[1:28:20] You have an ability within you to know
[1:28:22] that every word that the Bible has got,
[1:28:25] it is placed for a purpose. It is placed
[1:28:27] for our anointed eyes to catch something
[1:28:30] out of it.
[1:28:32] Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] Why are you in the message anyhow? It's
[1:28:36] because God gave you the ability to
[1:28:38] catch the revelation of this day.
[1:28:42] You are born with something special
[1:28:44] within you.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your neighbor and
[1:28:48] tell your neighbor, you are born with a
[1:28:50] special ability.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; That's why you are in here. It is
[1:28:55] because you are born with an ability to
[1:28:57] catch the message of your day.
[1:29:00] The prophet says Moses was born with the
[1:29:02] equipment within him. How many know the
[1:29:05] quotation I'm talking about? He says he
[1:29:07] was born with that equipment within him.
[1:29:10] You are born with an equipment that is
[1:29:12] able to decode the message of the hour
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; that when you heard Malachi 4, something
[1:29:19] inside of you echoed and he says that's
[1:29:22] nothing but the truth. I believe it
[1:29:24] 100%. So let me say you are blessed.
[1:29:29] Blessed are your eyes for the things
[1:29:31] that they see. You are blessed. Or do me
[1:29:35] a favor and tell your neighbor you are
[1:29:36] blessed.
[1:29:38] You don't have to have money in the
[1:29:40] bank. You don't have to be a rich man to
[1:29:42] know you are blessed. You just need to
[1:29:44] know I am called by God and I've been
[1:29:47] called to understand the message of my
[1:29:50] day. I am blessed.
[1:29:53] Or do you believe it tonight? You are
[1:29:55] blessed.
[1:29:57] I don't care who is telling you what but
[1:29:59] God says you are blessed. Blessed are
[1:30:02] your eyes. Blessed are your earsh.
[1:30:09] Many prophets of old they inquire
[1:30:12] diligently. But God said, "Go thy way to
[1:30:15] Daniel. Go thy way to the prophets of
[1:30:17] old." But when it came to this day,
[1:30:20] glory to God, uh God said, "I will allow
[1:30:23] you to catch the revelation of your day,
[1:30:26] you are blessed."
[1:30:29] Oh, give God a hand of praise somebody
[1:30:31] and just thank him for the blessing that
[1:30:34] God invested inside of you.
[1:30:39] Glory to God in the eyes.
[1:30:44] I think my my monitors have been tweaked
[1:30:46] down just a little bit. Just keep mine
[1:30:49] at the same level and deal with the
[1:30:51] house.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, sir.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, by God's grace, I just want to
[1:31:00] go into
[1:31:03] some details of scripture.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; How many love the Bible?
[1:31:08] And today I want to look at the
[1:31:10] prepositions
[1:31:12] that are used when letters are written
[1:31:15] to the church ages.
[1:31:18] Now in order for you to understand where
[1:31:20] I'm coming from, you need the King James
[1:31:22] version.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Because if you've got another Bible that
[1:31:28] does not follow the King James version,
[1:31:30] you might miss what I'm going to talk
[1:31:32] about. And that's why I started by
[1:31:34] showing you we need a recommended
[1:31:36] translation.
[1:31:39] It is the recommended translation. It is
[1:31:42] that the storms longer. Can you say
[1:31:44] amen?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; It is what the prophet of God left us.
[1:31:48] So can we get into the Bible now?
[1:31:51] Revelations 1, the Bible says in verse
[1:31:54] 11, "What thou seeest, write in a book
[1:31:58] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:32:01] which are in Asia."
[1:32:04] So John was given a clear instruction
[1:32:07] and the instruction was whatever you
[1:32:09] see, write in a book and send it unto
[1:32:11] the seven churches. Then he gets into
[1:32:14] Revelations chapter 2. And now he begins
[1:32:16] to write the letters. And when he begins
[1:32:19] in Revelations chapter 2 verse number
[1:32:21] one, he writes the letter to the church
[1:32:23] of Ephesus. But I want you to watch the
[1:32:26] preposition that the Bible uses there
[1:32:29] when it comes to Ephesus. It says of
[1:32:32] Ephesus.
[1:32:36] And then when we move to smea, it
[1:32:39] changes the preposition and it says in
[1:32:42] smea.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And when it goes to pamos, it uses in
[1:32:48] pegamos.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; And when it goes to Thotyra, it uses in
[1:32:52] Thotyra.
[1:32:54] And then amen. When it goes to sadis, it
[1:32:57] uses in sadis. And when it goes to
[1:33:01] Philadelphia, it uses in Philadelphia.
[1:33:04] But when we go to Laia, he changes it
[1:33:07] and it brings back to us.
[1:33:15] Oh, glory to God.
[1:33:18] Oh, glory to God.
[1:33:21] Ain't that striking, church?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And the question that I ask is God
[1:33:31] playing with words?
[1:33:34] No, our God does not play with words.
[1:33:37] Everything is laid down for a purpose,
[1:33:40] for anointed eyes to see a revelation.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Every word is intentional.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible in the book of
[1:33:50] Matthew says, "Till heaven and earth
[1:33:53] pass, one jot or one title shall in no
[1:33:56] wise pass from the law till it be
[1:33:59] fulfilled.
[1:34:03] Now, what is a jot?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew is called a y
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; and it is the smallest letter in the
[1:34:13] Hebrew language.
[1:34:15] And that little stretch that you've got
[1:34:17] there, this one,
[1:34:20] that's a jot.
[1:34:24] It looks so small, but it's actually a
[1:34:27] letter in the Hebrew language.
[1:34:30] And when they talk of a T2, it is the
[1:34:33] stroke that is put on a letter in order
[1:34:36] to distinguish it from another one.
[1:34:39] And it is an example. You can look at
[1:34:41] the letters R and D.
[1:34:45] You see it is constituted of a vertical
[1:34:47] part. But the bit that is at the top is
[1:34:50] what they call the stroke.
[1:34:54] And the way that stroke is put, it
[1:34:57] distinguishes those two letters.
[1:35:01] Then God said, "Not one jot, not one
[1:35:05] title shall pass away." In other words,
[1:35:08] God is so interested in the detail of
[1:35:11] the letter.
[1:35:14] Are you catching something, somebody?
[1:35:18] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So the words are laid out in order to
[1:35:23] hide a mystery somewhere. So in God
[1:35:25] using the prepositions that we find in
[1:35:28] Revelations chapter 2 and three. Amen.
[1:35:31] When he says unto the angel of of the
[1:35:34] church of Ephesus.
[1:35:37] He's not playing with words.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Then he comes to the next five ages.
[1:35:41] Smina it is in.
[1:35:45] Pamos. It is in
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Thotyra. It is in
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Sardis. It is in
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Philadelphia. It is in. And when it
[1:35:57] comes to la then it changes and it comes
[1:36:00] back to off.
[1:36:02] And not one j shall pass away. Not one
[1:36:06] t2 shall pass away. Not one preposition
[1:36:09] shall pass away.
[1:36:12] Glory to God in the heart.
[1:36:14] Are you following me this far?
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Now the question that has got to be
[1:36:18] asked is why?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Why? And in answering this question why,
[1:36:27] this is where we are going to see the
[1:36:29] restoration of the bride.
[1:36:32] Praise the Lord in the highest. Can we
[1:36:35] get into it, church?
[1:36:38] Can we get into it, church? I just love
[1:36:41] the word. Now I see I have all your
[1:36:44] attention.
[1:36:46] Praise God for it. Do me a favor and
[1:36:48] tell your neighbor, buckle up
[1:36:51] and sit up straight
[1:36:54] because you you don't want to miss
[1:36:56] anything here.
[1:36:58] Can we get into it now?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God in the highest. Now when you
[1:37:04] use the preposition the church of Amen.
[1:37:09] That tells me that when you get to that
[1:37:12] church, when you or when you get to that
[1:37:14] area, when you get into that age, there
[1:37:17] is only one church.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; So when you're using the preposition of,
[1:37:27] it is telling me that they can only be
[1:37:30] one church. Because the moment you say
[1:37:33] the church of Ephesus,
[1:37:36] you have excluded the possibility of the
[1:37:39] existence of any other church.
[1:37:46] In other words, when you walk into
[1:37:47] Ephesus and you ask where is the church,
[1:37:50] nobody is going to ask you a question.
[1:37:52] They will just tell you, oh, the church
[1:37:54] is here.
[1:37:59] Are you with me? because there's only
[1:38:02] one church in there.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; The same thing when you come to Leia,
[1:38:07] there's only one church in there.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; But when you go to Sman, Amen. In Sman,
[1:38:15] the preposition that is used is in.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you get into SMA
[1:38:21] and you ask somebody where is the
[1:38:23] church, they will ask you a question.
[1:38:25] Which one?
[1:38:30] It's like me walking into West Palm
[1:38:32] Beach and I'm walking in the streets and
[1:38:34] I ask a stranger and I say, "Where is
[1:38:36] the church?" What is the question they
[1:38:38] are likely to ask me? They will ask me,
[1:38:40] "Which one?" And I say, "I mean the
[1:38:43] church." They'll say, "Which one?
[1:38:47] We got the Roman Catholics here. We got
[1:38:49] the Presbyterians here. We got the
[1:38:51] Methodists in here. We got the
[1:38:53] Pentecostals in here. We got the
[1:38:55] Assemblies of God in here. We got a
[1:38:58] message in here. Which one?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's when you're using in. So the
[1:39:07] church in it is telling me that there is
[1:39:10] more than one church in there. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Now with God,
[1:39:17] when God is looking at this, there's
[1:39:20] only two churches.
[1:39:23] And the prophet calls it a true vine.
[1:39:26] and a false vine.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; All churches, no matter who they are,
[1:39:36] they fit under these two.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; So when the Bible uses the preposition
[1:39:41] of, the Bible is talking of one church.
[1:39:45] When the Bible uses the preposition in,
[1:39:48] the Bible is talking of the two vines
[1:39:50] that are now in existence. Are you
[1:39:52] catching it, somebody?
[1:39:56] Now let's prove this by the Bible. When
[1:39:58] you get into the book of Revelation
[1:39:59] chapter 2, the Bible says unto the angel
[1:40:02] of the church of Ephesus, right?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Now look at the message. I know thy
[1:40:10] works and thy labor and thy patience and
[1:40:13] how thou cannot spar them which are
[1:40:15] evil. And it goes on there and he says,
[1:40:18] "You have tried them that say they are
[1:40:20] apostles and you have found them liars
[1:40:23] and is born and is patience and for my
[1:40:25] name's sake has labored and has not
[1:40:27] fainted.
[1:40:29] Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:40:31] thee because thou has left thy first
[1:40:33] life."
[1:40:35] Now, we know Ephesus was the first
[1:40:38] church age, and this is the church age
[1:40:39] that started in AD 53. And we know the
[1:40:42] messenger was obviously Paul.
[1:40:45] It was an example church.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; It was a nearly perfect church.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; You look at the message, it is
[1:40:54] commendation upon commendation.
[1:40:57] I know thy works and thy labor and thy
[1:40:59] patience and how thou cannot bear them
[1:41:02] which are evil. In other words, there
[1:41:05] were certain people that were evil that
[1:41:07] were living in the area. But those that
[1:41:10] were evil, the church could not suffer
[1:41:12] them to become part of them.
[1:41:17] They couldn't bear them
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; and they kicked them out of the church.
[1:41:22] Keep the church pure.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; So the church remained one.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Thou has tried them that say they are
[1:41:32] apostles and you have found them liars.
[1:41:35] Others came and they tried to penetrate
[1:41:38] into the church and saying we are
[1:41:40] apostles but they tried them with the
[1:41:42] message of Paul and they say Paul never
[1:41:44] said it that way.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore you are a liar and they kicked
[1:41:50] them out and they kept the purity of the
[1:41:53] church. Can you say amen?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; And thou has born and has patience and
[1:41:59] for my name's sake has labored and has
[1:42:01] not fainted.
[1:42:03] There's only one thing that you find
[1:42:07] wrong with the church of Ephesus.
[1:42:10] Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
[1:42:12] thee because thou has left thy first
[1:42:15] love.
[1:42:18] But I want you to look at the way that
[1:42:19] scripture is written. It says, "Thou has
[1:42:22] left thy first love." In other words, at
[1:42:25] the beginning
[1:42:27] they heard this love.
[1:42:31] So if at the beginning they had this
[1:42:33] love that makes Ephesus a perfect
[1:42:36] church.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; It was only further down the line that's
[1:42:41] where they lost the first love. But at
[1:42:44] the beginning they had the original love
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; and now if you're looking at it at the
[1:42:50] beginning when they had their first love
[1:42:52] it means that that church age was
[1:42:54] perfect.
[1:42:58] Now the prophet when he preached when he
[1:43:00] taught on this church ages he then drew
[1:43:02] the pictures of the church ages and when
[1:43:04] he drew the picture of the Ephesian
[1:43:06] church age he put a little dark mark at
[1:43:09] the bottom here.
[1:43:13] But I give you to understand that the
[1:43:15] reason why he put that dark mark at the
[1:43:17] bottom it is because they had now lost
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; their first love. But if the prophet had
[1:43:24] drawn this before they lost their first
[1:43:27] love, he would have presented it like
[1:43:29] this.
[1:43:31] Pure.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the eyes.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Now, Malachi 4 comes to come and restore
[1:43:48] us back to the hearts of the Pentecostal
[1:43:51] fathers. Now I ask you, which
[1:43:53] Pentecostal fathers, are they the ones
[1:43:56] that had lost their first love?
[1:43:59] No. God cannot come and restore us back
[1:44:02] to an era. The restoration is got to be
[1:44:05] back to perfection.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; So it tells me Ephesus at a certain
[1:44:10] point was a perfect church age. Ephesus
[1:44:14] at a certain point produced the
[1:44:16] Pentecostal fathers that we got to be
[1:44:18] restored back to. and we can be restored
[1:44:21] back to something that is an error.
[1:44:27] Give God a hand of praise somebody.
[1:44:31] Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] So if we're going to blow the church
[1:44:35] age, Amen. of Ephesus, hallelujah. This
[1:44:39] is the way the church of Ephesus looked
[1:44:42] at the beginning.
[1:44:45] Not a single dark mark in it. Not a
[1:44:48] single blemish that you find in it. Not
[1:44:50] a single thing that you can point to it.
[1:44:53] Everything is just running so perfect in
[1:44:56] that church age.
[1:44:58] Now if you walked into the church of
[1:45:00] Ephesus and you asked where is the
[1:45:02] church and it is looking like this, who
[1:45:05] will ask you a question?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; They will just point you and say there
[1:45:09] it is.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; They don't need to know what name it is.
[1:45:14] The church of Ephesus.
[1:45:16] It's enough to be able to identify what
[1:45:19] that church is.
[1:45:21] But now when you go into sinner, now the
[1:45:24] preposition that is used is in
[1:45:26] Revelations chapter 2 unto the angel of
[1:45:29] the church in sinner. Right? Now look at
[1:45:32] the message. I know thy works and
[1:45:34] tribulation and poverty, but thou art
[1:45:37] rich and I know the blasphemy of them
[1:45:39] which say they are Jews and are not, but
[1:45:42] are the synagogue of Satan.
[1:45:45] So now we have the synagogue of Satan
[1:45:49] and the prophet of God when he talks
[1:45:51] about sinner he says these people were
[1:45:53] saying that they were actually Jews real
[1:45:55] Jews by birth they were liars they were
[1:45:58] not Jews by birth and they weren't Jews
[1:46:00] by religion if all this is true what
[1:46:03] were they a deceived people who were
[1:46:06] already part of the church
[1:46:13] they belong to the false vine.
[1:46:16] So now there is a true vine and there is
[1:46:19] a false vine. Are you with me? They were
[1:46:22] not of the true church but of the false
[1:46:24] church because God says they were the
[1:46:26] synagogue of Satan.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; So now you see we have got two vines
[1:46:32] when you get into and that's why the
[1:46:34] Bible uses the preposition in.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:43] Glory to God.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; So when you walked into Smen and if you
[1:46:50] wanted to find which one is the church,
[1:46:52] someone would ask you which one because
[1:46:54] there is a true vine and there is a
[1:46:56] small there and there is a false vine.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Somehow Satan had crept in. Somehow he
[1:47:03] had now taken root in that church age.
[1:47:08] But no matter how much the devil had
[1:47:10] climbed in, but still there was a true
[1:47:12] vine that was there.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; And you glad church that no matter what
[1:47:17] the devil does, there will always be a
[1:47:19] true believer somewhere.
[1:47:22] I don't care how many people will leave
[1:47:24] the message, there will always be a true
[1:47:26] believer somewhere. I don't care how
[1:47:28] many fine fault with brother Branham,
[1:47:31] there's always somebody that still
[1:47:33] believes that prophet.
[1:47:36] They can say what they will. They can
[1:47:38] believe the sign whatever they will. But
[1:47:40] brother, sister, there's always somebody
[1:47:43] who has been caught with a hook of the
[1:47:45] message who says, "Give me the message
[1:47:48] and nothing else." Or do I have somebody
[1:47:51] that says, "That's me."
[1:47:53] Oh, that's me. Glory to God in the
[1:47:57] highest.
[1:47:59] But you can see there is two vines that
[1:48:01] are in there. Now we get to Revelations
[1:48:04] chapter 2. The Bible says in Revelations
[1:48:07] chapter 2:12 here and to the angel of
[1:48:09] the church in Pergamas
[1:48:12] and watch the message. I know thy works
[1:48:15] and where thou dwellest even where Satan
[1:48:17] sees and thou holdest fast my name and
[1:48:20] has not denied my faith. So there is
[1:48:23] Satan's seat somewhere.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; But there is a group that has not denied
[1:48:27] his name.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; But he's also saying I know where Satan
[1:48:32] dwells. when you go to verse 14. But I
[1:48:35] have a few things against thee because
[1:48:37] thou hast there them that hold the
[1:48:41] doctrine of Balam.
[1:48:44] Not only do we have those that hold the
[1:48:46] doctrine of Balum, so has thou also them
[1:48:49] that hold the doctrine of the
[1:48:51] nicolatans.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; So you can see there is an intermingling
[1:48:57] of the vines there. So the preposition
[1:48:59] that the Bible then uses, it uses the
[1:49:02] preposition in.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God looking at the
[1:49:09] Pamian churches. He says it was a city
[1:49:12] of great sin given over to lentious rise
[1:49:16] of the worship of Eskealup Escalupellius
[1:49:20] whom they worshiped in the form of a
[1:49:22] living serpent which was housed and fed
[1:49:24] in the temple. In this beautiful city of
[1:49:27] irrigated groves, public walks and parks
[1:49:31] lived a small group of dedicated
[1:49:33] believers who were not fooled by the
[1:49:36] veneer of beauty and above the satanic
[1:49:39] worship that filled the place.
[1:49:44] So, praise God, you still find some true
[1:49:47] believers in there.
[1:49:49] Then we move to the Titarian church age
[1:49:52] in the book of Revelations 2:18. unto
[1:49:55] the angel of the church in Thotyra, I
[1:49:58] know thy works and charity and service
[1:50:00] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[1:50:04] and the last to be more than the first.
[1:50:07] So God is commanding this group here.
[1:50:09] Then he goes to verse 20.
[1:50:11] Notwithstanding, I have a few things
[1:50:13] against thee because thou sufferest that
[1:50:16] woman Jezebel.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; So now Jezebel is in the church.
[1:50:26] which call it theirel a prophetess.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Two vines can clearly be seen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says the name
[1:50:35] Theotyra it means a dominating female
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; speaking of the existence of a Jezebel
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; and the prophet tells us that it was in
[1:50:47] Thayyra that is where the tree was
[1:50:49] reduced down to its roots.
[1:50:53] This is when we got into the dark ages.
[1:50:56] The bride tree looked like it was
[1:50:58] completely destroyed. But praise be to
[1:51:00] God, the life that was in there was the
[1:51:04] life of God.
[1:51:07] And there is one thing that you can
[1:51:08] never do. You can never kill God.
[1:51:16] The life that was in there was a Zoe
[1:51:19] life and you can never be able to kill
[1:51:22] Zoe. So Zoe went and hid in the roots.
[1:51:25] Praise the Lord in the highest. We heard
[1:51:28] in the morning that the predestinated
[1:51:30] was in there and he went down to the
[1:51:32] roots hiding the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:36] Oh glory to God. Oh glory to God. And
[1:51:41] God in that condition, he spoke and he
[1:51:43] said, "I will restore."
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That was in Thotyra.
[1:51:54] Can I move on?
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Then we move to Revelation chapter 3.
[1:51:59] Unto the angel of the church in Sardis,
[1:52:04] be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:52:05] which remain. They are ready to die. For
[1:52:08] I have not found thy works perfect
[1:52:10] before God.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; False vine. Thou has a few names even in
[1:52:16] Sardis which have not defiled their
[1:52:18] garments. True vine.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture, church?
[1:52:25] Then we go to Philadelphia. Verse number
[1:52:28] seven. To the church in Philadelphia. I
[1:52:31] know thy works. Behold, I have set
[1:52:33] before thee an open door and no man can
[1:52:36] shut it. For thou has a little strength
[1:52:39] and has kept my word and has not denied
[1:52:41] my name.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; True vine.
[1:52:45] Behold, I'll make them of the synagogue
[1:52:48] of Satan. We say they are Jews and are
[1:52:50] not, but do lie. False vine.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; So, we can see the two. Amen. In each
[1:52:58] one of these ages, are you with me? So
[1:53:02] all the way from Smya until we get to
[1:53:05] Philadelphia, you can trace these two
[1:53:07] vines.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; The devil playing his tricks. But in the
[1:53:14] midst of the devil playing his tricks.
[1:53:16] Amen. Yet God still has a true church
[1:53:20] that is in there.
[1:53:23] So that's why God could write a letter
[1:53:25] unto the angel of the church in in other
[1:53:29] words God is saying there might be two
[1:53:31] vines but I still have my people.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; So write a letter to the angel of the
[1:53:37] church in
[1:53:39] I have mine in there.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:44] So we have the five ages and with the
[1:53:47] five ages the Bible uses the preposition
[1:53:50] in and it is showing me the presence of
[1:53:53] that little rusco insect trying to
[1:53:56] destroy that bride.
[1:54:00] Then now we come to Low here. The Bible
[1:54:03] then switches. Amen. And it takes it to
[1:54:06] the preposition of
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; and I've said when you use the
[1:54:13] preposition of it means there is one
[1:54:16] church.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody says where is he going now?
[1:54:26] When you use the preposition of, you are
[1:54:29] speaking of one church.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at the message to love
[1:54:34] the sea.
[1:54:36] I know thy works that thou art neither
[1:54:40] cold nor hot. I would that thou were
[1:54:42] cold nor hot. So then because thou art
[1:54:45] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I'll
[1:54:47] spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:54:51] Verse 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich
[1:54:54] and increased with goods and have need
[1:54:56] of nothing. And knowest not that thou
[1:54:58] art wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:55:00] blind and naked.
[1:55:04] Nothing good said about that church age.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; They think they are rich, but they are
[1:55:12] poor.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; They are wretched. They are miserable.
[1:55:16] They are blind. And they are naked. And
[1:55:18] yet don't know it.
[1:55:23] They are so bad until God says I'll spew
[1:55:27] thee out of my mouth.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; So clearly you can see there is only one
[1:55:34] vine.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; And it is the false vine.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; You go to Laia and you ask can I see the
[1:55:46] church they will show you one church.
[1:55:53] They might ever call it Methodist. They
[1:55:55] might ever call it this and that. But it
[1:55:58] is all one church. And that one church
[1:56:01] is a false vine.
[1:56:04] Oh God help us.
[1:56:09] Now when the prophet drew the picture of
[1:56:11] the church ages, when he got to the
[1:56:13] church age of laia, he drew lower dea
[1:56:16] and he put a little light at the top
[1:56:18] there.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me church?
[1:56:24] But yet when you look at the message of
[1:56:26] the lower to to the lower desians, amen,
[1:56:29] there is nothing good that is said in
[1:56:31] there. Zero.
[1:56:34] In other words, according to the
[1:56:36] message, Amen. There is no light in
[1:56:39] lower dea.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; So it means when the prophet drew this,
[1:56:46] something had taken place.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; But before this took place, if he was to
[1:56:53] draw the picture of Laia, this is the
[1:56:56] way Laia would look like totally black.
[1:57:04] Glory to God in the highest.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] And to prove that that church age was
[1:57:12] totally black when the pope visited uh
[1:57:15] Israel for the first time, the prophet
[1:57:18] of God says the Lord drew the pictures
[1:57:21] of the church ages in the skies
[1:57:23] supernaturally.
[1:57:26] And he drew it through the solar
[1:57:28] eclipse, Ephesus, Mana, Paggamos,
[1:57:31] Thotyra, Sardis, Philadelphia.
[1:57:34] And those were the only ones that came.
[1:57:36] And he says, "And when it came to the
[1:57:38] last one, what did he say?" He says it
[1:57:42] was a total eclipse.
[1:57:49] So in other words, when God now drew the
[1:57:51] picture, he drew the picture and he
[1:57:54] showed us that there is nothing. There
[1:57:56] is no light. It is completely dark. It
[1:57:59] is black. There is no hope at all.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; So I give you to understand when you
[1:58:06] step into Leia, there's only one church
[1:58:09] and that one church that is in Leia, it
[1:58:12] is the false vine.
[1:58:16] And I want you to watch the way the
[1:58:17] Bible also phrases it which is different
[1:58:20] from the church of Ephesus. The Bible
[1:58:22] says of the church of Ephesus. But when
[1:58:25] it comes to Leadosia, it doesn't say the
[1:58:27] church of Leosia. It says the church of
[1:58:30] the Lordians.
[1:58:34] In other words, it does not even belong
[1:58:36] to God. It belongs to the Lordians.
[1:58:41] God has got nothing good. God has got
[1:58:44] nothing to do with it.
[1:58:47] It's not of God.
[1:58:51] It belongs to the lowerians.
[1:58:56] Are you with me, church? Are you with
[1:58:59] me, church? And that's why the Bible
[1:59:01] says in verse number 20, behold, I stand
[1:59:05] at the door and I knock. In other words,
[1:59:08] I'm outside of the church. I'm not part
[1:59:11] of the church. This has got nothing to
[1:59:13] do with me.
[1:59:20] Glory to God in the eyes.
[1:59:22] Glory to God in the eyes. So when you
[1:59:26] blow up the church, Amen. of the
[1:59:28] Lawians, it is a totally black church.
[1:59:32] There is no hope in Ladicia.
[1:59:35] Are you with me, church? It is totally
[1:59:38] dark. There is just nothing in there.
[1:59:41] There is no hope. There is no light. It
[1:59:44] is total darkness.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But I want to say church in that total
[1:59:51] darkness that is where you and I
[1:59:55] have got to live.
[1:59:58] That is where you and I, we've got to
[2:00:01] raise our children.
[2:00:03] That is where you and I, we got to find
[2:00:06] a way of survival in that total
[2:00:08] darkness. Where is our hope then?
[2:00:14] Because when I look at that, there is no
[2:00:16] hope in LA this year. There is nothing
[2:00:18] that can come out of LA this year.
[2:00:22] It is totally dark. But where is our
[2:00:25] hope then?
[2:00:28] If we have to raise our children in
[2:00:30] there, if we have to raise our families
[2:00:33] in there, where is our hope then? I give
[2:00:36] you to understand the hope. Amen. Was in
[2:00:39] the promise. Joel chapter 2. And I
[2:00:44] I
[2:00:47] will restore.
[2:00:49] I will restore. I don't care how far the
[2:00:55] devil has gone, but I will restore.
[2:01:00] Oh, say amen, somebody.
[2:01:06] I will restore.
[2:01:09] Oh, praise be to God. So it might be
[2:01:12] dark. Hallelujah. It might be all black.
[2:01:15] But I have a promise in there that I
[2:01:19] will restore. Oh, praise the Lord. In
[2:01:22] the highest God is going to turn on the
[2:01:25] light somehow. So there is going to be a
[2:01:28] something that will take place in that
[2:01:31] total darkness. There is a man uh that
[2:01:34] can turn on the light. Uh God is the man
[2:01:38] uh that can turn on the light. Uh but
[2:01:40] God sends a man that can turn on the
[2:01:44] light. And now I can say behold the man.
[2:01:50] Behold the man that can turn on the
[2:01:54] light.
[2:01:55] Oh come on Florida.
[2:01:58] Oh come on Florida. Give God a hand or
[2:02:01] praise somebody.
[2:02:03] There is a man that can turn on the
[2:02:06] lights.
[2:02:09] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] Praise God in the highest. Oh
[2:02:14] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And let me say
[2:02:20] church of the living God, our God is not
[2:02:23] a reactive God. Our God is a proactive
[2:02:27] God. He does not react because the devil
[2:02:30] has done something. My Bible tells me
[2:02:33] when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[2:02:36] the Lord will lift up a standard.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought exactly how the
[2:02:42] word is written? He says he will lift up
[2:02:44] a standard. He will not create a
[2:02:46] standard. The standard is already in
[2:02:49] existence. It is somewhere hiding behind
[2:02:52] something. But when the hour comes, then
[2:02:55] he lifts up the standard. It was in
[2:02:58] existence already.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Before the lowerian age started, the
[2:03:08] promise of Elijah was already in the
[2:03:10] Bible. Can you say amen?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Our God is not a reactive God. He is a
[2:03:16] proactive God. God knew that Israel was
[2:03:20] going to go into famine and he needed to
[2:03:23] prepare the people. So he sent Joseph
[2:03:26] into the land of Egypt way before the
[2:03:29] famine struck. Our God is not a reactive
[2:03:32] God. Can you say amen?
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; God knew there was coming a Hmon who
[2:03:37] would want to exterminate the Jews. So
[2:03:40] God uh he caused a beautiful baby to be
[2:03:43] born
[2:03:46] by the name Esther.
[2:03:48] Oh, glory to God. And by the time Hmon
[2:03:52] rises, Esther is already in the palace.
[2:03:56] As a solution to the Hmon plot, I'm
[2:03:59] saying our God is not a reactive God.
[2:04:03] Our God is a proactive God. God knew you
[2:04:07] will be born in sin. you will be sheep
[2:04:09] in iniquity. So he provided a lamb
[2:04:12] before the foundation of the world.
[2:04:15] Before the devil got you to sin, God had
[2:04:18] already provided a lamb for you. Can you
[2:04:21] say amen?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; God knew the devil would throw a
[2:04:24] sickness on you. What did he do? He said
[2:04:27] by his stripes you are healed. So let me
[2:04:31] tell you, your sickness came amen after
[2:04:35] the promise. Well, I got some bad news
[2:04:38] for the devil. I got some bad news for
[2:04:41] the devil. He came too late. You are
[2:04:45] God's healed daughter. You are God's
[2:04:47] healed son. You were already healed
[2:04:51] before the devil came in. Can you say
[2:04:53] amen? Our God is a proactive God. He
[2:04:57] provided his stripes. or right now,
[2:05:00] right here. If you are sick, you can
[2:05:02] stand up and you can jump and you can
[2:05:05] say I am well. Let the sick say, "I am
[2:05:08] healed." Let the poor say, "I am rich."
[2:05:12] Let the weak say, "I am strong." Let
[2:05:15] somebody praise the Lord. As you praise
[2:05:18] the Lord, the devil is coming down. Uh
[2:05:21] oh, come on, church of the living God.
[2:05:22] Uh you are already healed.
[2:05:29] You are God's healed daughter who the
[2:05:32] devil is trying to make sick. You are
[2:05:34] God's healed son who the devil is trying
[2:05:37] to make sick. Come on, wake up somebody.
[2:05:42] Give God a hand of praise.
[2:05:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:47] So our God is a proactive God. Can you
[2:05:51] say amen? Can you say amen? So before
[2:05:55] Leodia had gone into total darkness, God
[2:05:59] had already provided the light. Amen.
[2:06:03] The age of Leia, it started in 1906, 3
[2:06:07] years into the age of Laia. What did God
[2:06:11] do? He sent down the pillar of fire
[2:06:18] in the hilly plains of Kentucky. There
[2:06:21] was a boy that was born. Uh a pillar of
[2:06:24] fire came down. Uh there is a man that
[2:06:27] can turn on the light. There is a light
[2:06:31] that can light up lower.
[2:06:35] Oh, glory to God in the highest. Ain't
[2:06:38] you glad church that we have a message
[2:06:40] that is a supernatural message. We have
[2:06:43] a message that is a packed message. So a
[2:06:46] mystery unfolded in that little cave in
[2:06:49] there. But the pillar of fire came down
[2:06:52] 1950. Then God said, "I will now display
[2:06:56] the light that can change things in LEA
[2:07:00] to the rest of the world." And he
[2:07:02] allowed his prophet to be taken a
[2:07:04] picture.
[2:07:05] Oh, give God a hand of praise.
[2:07:10] Now I repeat, you are blessed.
[2:07:14] I repeat, you are blessed.
[2:07:17] Blessed are your eyes. Oh, I'm looking
[2:07:18] for somebody that believes it here. You
[2:07:21] are blessed
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; for you to be able to see this great
[2:07:24] mystery of Elijah. You are blessed.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Do me a favor and tell your neighbor,
[2:07:30] God bless you. Blessed daughter of God.
[2:07:32] God bless you, son of God. You are
[2:07:35] thoroughly, thoroughly blessed.
[2:07:39] You are not here by accident. You didn't
[2:07:42] come here by accident. The Holy Ghost
[2:07:44] laid you here. You are blessed. There is
[2:07:47] an equipment that is inside of you that
[2:07:50] is able to decode the message of your
[2:07:52] day. You are blessed. Oh, I don't care
[2:07:55] how much money you don't have. I don't
[2:07:58] care how much your boss is persecuting
[2:08:00] at your word work. You are blessed. I
[2:08:04] don't care how much what is in your
[2:08:05] home. You are blessed.
[2:08:08] Oh, somebody shout I'm blessed.
[2:08:12] I'm blessed. I'm blessed. As you shout,
[2:08:16] I'm blessed. Let the blessings come on
[2:08:18] you. Let the blessings come on you.
[2:08:22] Receive your blessing. Receive your
[2:08:25] blessing. Come on, church of the living
[2:08:28] God. You are blessed. Oh, glory to God
[2:08:32] in the highest.
[2:08:35] I'm going to say it until you believe
[2:08:37] it. I'm going to say it until you feel
[2:08:39] it. I'm going to say it until you know
[2:08:42] you are thoroughly, thoroughly blessed.
[2:08:44] for you to be in the message of the
[2:08:46] hour. It's not an accident. Uh it's a
[2:08:49] designed program of God.
[2:08:55] Your name is called blessing.
[2:09:00] You attract God's blessings. I don't
[2:09:03] care how much the devil is trying to
[2:09:05] throw at you. One of these fine days,
[2:09:08] things are going to change because you
[2:09:10] are blessed.
[2:09:14] You might as well give that devil a
[2:09:15] warning right now and tell the old man
[2:09:17] devil, "My blessings are coming." Uh,
[2:09:20] because I am God's blessed son. I'm
[2:09:23] God's blessed daughter. I am blessed.
[2:09:28] You can start to thank God before
[2:09:30] anything happens because it's going to
[2:09:32] come your way. The devil is a liar. You
[2:09:35] are blessed.
[2:09:41] Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Yes,
[2:09:46] I am blessed. Yes, I am blessed. I don't
[2:09:50] care how many enemies come against you.
[2:09:52] But brother, when the blessing of God
[2:09:54] begins to speak, you will know that you
[2:09:57] are blessed.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Why are you blessed? Because you come
[2:10:02] out of an age where there was no hope.
[2:10:08] When it was totally dark in Leodia, then
[2:10:11] God because of the light, he turns on
[2:10:14] the light and he says, "Now I change the
[2:10:18] picture."
[2:10:21] Who is changing the picture? It is you
[2:10:23] and I.
[2:10:25] We are the ones that are in the top
[2:10:27] there. And what does God then say? He
[2:10:30] says this, "Now I will not call it less.
[2:10:34] I now call this the bride age.
[2:10:40] So you are not related this year. You
[2:10:43] are living in another age. It is called
[2:10:46] the bride age
[2:10:50] because there is no hope in Leot here.
[2:10:53] There is nothing good said about Leos
[2:10:55] here. But when it comes to the bride
[2:10:57] age, there is everything good that is
[2:11:00] said about the bride age. Can you say
[2:11:02] amen? Can you say amen? Can you say
[2:11:06] amen? Shout amen somebody. Hallelujah.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] Glory to God. The prophet of God then
[2:11:14] goes on and he says this is not a
[2:11:16] Pentecostal age. This is the latter day
[2:11:19] age. This is the bride age.
[2:11:23] This is the evening light.
[2:11:26] Woo. To take away the darkness out of
[2:11:29] Leia. This is the evening light. This is
[2:11:33] when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to
[2:11:36] follow God's pattern. This is Luke 17:30
[2:11:39] to be fulfilled. This is the second and
[2:11:42] Jeremiah and all the rest of them that
[2:11:44] Joah has spoke of these days. This is
[2:11:47] that day I have heard,
[2:11:50] Lord, it was coming, but now I see it
[2:11:55] with my eye.
[2:11:57] Oh, how many can say I see it? How many
[2:12:01] can say I see it or shout I see it. I
[2:12:05] see it with my eye. He goes on and he
[2:12:08] says hallelujah. The word that fell on
[2:12:10] the day of Pentecost will not work for
[2:12:12] this day. No say that was for Pentecost.
[2:12:16] This is for the bride. Going home of the
[2:12:18] bride. We got something different. The
[2:12:21] Pentecost house represented that again.
[2:12:24] We are in the bride age.
[2:12:29] Somebody shout amen.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody shout amen.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Now I can say arise
[2:12:37] and shine for thy light has come. You
[2:12:41] see when you were in darkness you were
[2:12:43] in bondage. And when you are in bondage
[2:12:46] you are kind of like under slavery. But
[2:12:48] when your light then comes praise God in
[2:12:51] the highest brother sister slavery days
[2:12:54] are over.
[2:12:56] The prophet tells me that when slavery
[2:12:58] was abolished in America,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; amen, that they were told that the
[2:13:04] emancipation proclamation was going to
[2:13:06] be on such and such a day.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; And then that day came, we had some
[2:13:11] people that climbed right on top of the
[2:13:14] mountain and they went all the way up.
[2:13:18] The weak came a little lower and the
[2:13:20] weaker came a little lower and the
[2:13:22] weakest were in the valley. But the ones
[2:13:24] that were on top of the mountain, when
[2:13:26] they saw the sun rise, they shouted, "We
[2:13:30] are free."
[2:13:34] Others were not yet seeing the light,
[2:13:36] but they heard the message and they
[2:13:38] echoed, "We are free." And it went down,
[2:13:41] "We are free." Or is there somebody that
[2:13:44] shouts, "We are free." Is there somebody
[2:13:47] that shouts, "We are free." Shout, "I'm
[2:13:50] free." I'm free. I am free. Let your
[2:13:54] neighbor be anointed with your
[2:13:57] proclamation of your freedom. Shout
[2:13:59] again. I am free. I'm free from bondage.
[2:14:03] I'm free from condemnation. I'm free
[2:14:06] from death. I'm free from persecution.
[2:14:09] I'm free across the board. You are free.
[2:14:13] I said you are free. Give God a hand of
[2:14:17] praise for your freedom. You are free.
[2:14:22] Oh, glory to God in the eyes.
[2:14:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] Praise the Lord. The prophet says, "We
[2:14:30] are not living in a Pentecostal age. We
[2:14:32] are living in another age. We are not
[2:14:35] living in the Methodist age. We are
[2:14:37] living in another age. We are living on
[2:14:41] up here to the bride age." And I like
[2:14:46] the phraseiology on up here. Where? Take
[2:14:50] me to the picture. We are living on up
[2:14:54] here.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you see where you belong?
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see where you belong?
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are living on up here.
[2:15:05] The calling of the church and getting it
[2:15:07] together for the rapture. That's the age
[2:15:09] that we are living in. To my honest
[2:15:11] opinion, that's exactly the truth.
[2:15:18] Now let me move on and say this bride
[2:15:20] age is not another age
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; as in an eighth age
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; because there are only seven ages.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; So this bride age is an age within an
[2:15:36] age.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Come on church of God. It's an age
[2:15:42] within an age. Somebody says, "Hey,
[2:15:44] where do we get this in the types?" I
[2:15:47] can ask you the question. In Egypt,
[2:15:50] there was a place that was called Gan.
[2:15:54] Where was Goshan? Gosh was not in
[2:15:57] another country. It was within Egypt.
[2:16:00] But when plagues were falling in Egypt,
[2:16:03] in Gosan there was not a single plague.
[2:16:07] When frogs were falling in Egypt, in
[2:16:10] Gosan there was not a single frog.
[2:16:13] When there was lice in Egypt, not a
[2:16:15] single lice was found in Gion.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; When there were flies everywhere, not
[2:16:23] one came into gion. When the water
[2:16:26] turned into blood, the waters of gion,
[2:16:29] they became pure.
[2:16:33] Somebody woke up that day and he says,
[2:16:35] "The water just tastes so sweet today. I
[2:16:38] wonder what is going on."
[2:16:40] God showing that I have put a
[2:16:42] difference.
[2:16:44] Oh, glory to God in the highest. Oh,
[2:16:46] glory to God in the highest. What
[2:16:49] happened in Gosan? What is it that
[2:16:52] secured gosh? There was a man there that
[2:16:55] could turn on the light. And that man
[2:16:58] was the prophet Moses.
[2:17:01] He turned on the light and he says, "Not
[2:17:03] in Gion."
[2:17:05] Now, we have received a prophet like
[2:17:07] unto Moses. And because we have received
[2:17:09] a prophet like unto Moses, we have a
[2:17:11] right to declare a goshion.
[2:17:16] Or did you hear what I said? I said we
[2:17:18] have a right to declare a goshion
[2:17:22] because we believe the word. We can
[2:17:24] declare a goshion also. Before I close,
[2:17:27] I want us to declare a goshion
[2:17:30] to the bride of Jesus Christ. What
[2:17:33] happens in Egypt cannot happen in gan.
[2:17:36] What happens in your neighbor's house
[2:17:38] cannot happen in your house. What
[2:17:41] happens to your neighbor's family cannot
[2:17:43] happen to your family. When they get
[2:17:46] fired there, you can't get fired because
[2:17:49] you are in gosh. I want to declare
[2:17:51] goshion here. I want to declare goshion
[2:17:54] here. I don't care what the devil has
[2:17:57] tried to do, but I'm here to say that
[2:17:59] devil is a liar. He has deceived you.
[2:18:02] But now the word is waking you up. The
[2:18:05] word is telling you you are in gion. In
[2:18:09] gionh there is no suffering.
[2:18:12] I refuse. I say there is no suffering in
[2:18:15] gion. Are you hearing me somebody? Are
[2:18:19] you hearing me somebody? There is no
[2:18:21] suffering in gosh. God is going to put a
[2:18:24] difference. Exodus chapter 11, the Bible
[2:18:27] says, "And there shall be a cry
[2:18:29] throughout the land of Egypt, such as
[2:18:31] there was none like it, nor shall be
[2:18:34] like anymore. But against any of the
[2:18:36] children of Israel, shall not a dog move
[2:18:40] his stand against men or beast, that you
[2:18:44] may know that the Lord God put a
[2:18:46] difference between the Egyptians and
[2:18:49] Israel."
[2:18:51] Oh, you are spiritual Israel. There is a
[2:18:54] difference that God has got to put on
[2:18:56] you. No dog shall bark at you. Somebody
[2:19:01] says, "What dog are you talking about?"
[2:19:04] When Jesus came, he spoke to the
[2:19:06] Syphenician woman. And he says, "It is
[2:19:09] not meant for me to give the children's
[2:19:11] bread unto the dogs." Who were the dogs?
[2:19:14] Those who were not in the commonwealth
[2:19:17] of God.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? So not a dog
[2:19:24] shall bark at you. I don't care. Your
[2:19:27] boss is not a believer.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; As long as he's not a believer, he can't
[2:19:34] back against you.
[2:19:38] Go in your secret corner and say, "I
[2:19:41] condemn this.
[2:19:43] No weapon that is formed against me
[2:19:46] shall prosper.
[2:19:48] Every tongue that shall be spoken
[2:19:50] against me, I shall condemn it. This is
[2:19:53] the heritage of the children of the
[2:19:55] Lord. Do you know your inheritance? Oh,
[2:19:58] let us declare goshion in here. Let us
[2:20:01] declare goshion in here. Every sick
[2:20:03] person must be healed right now.
[2:20:07] You came with blood pressure, let it go
[2:20:09] down.
[2:20:12] You came not being able to walk, start
[2:20:14] walking now.
[2:20:16] You came with a desire. I give you your
[2:20:19] heart's desire in the name of Jesus
[2:20:21] Christ. Receive it right now. Oh, I
[2:20:25] believe in the power of the word. I
[2:20:28] believe that God can do something for
[2:20:31] you right now. I can declare situations
[2:20:35] are changing. Lives are changing. God is
[2:20:39] already visiting somebody. Somebody's
[2:20:41] getting touched right now. If you feel a
[2:20:44] touch, don't be quick to think it is
[2:20:46] your brother. It might just be an
[2:20:48] angelic touch. Your theophony might just
[2:20:51] be touching you to provide healing for
[2:20:54] you tonight. Can you say amen somebody?
[2:20:57] Can you say amen somebody? Right now,
[2:21:00] right here, there is a caution that we
[2:21:02] are creating. We are banishing all
[2:21:04] demons from here. We declaring this
[2:21:07] place a no-fly zone for devils.
[2:21:13] So every disease out,
[2:21:17] every problem out, every situation out.
[2:21:22] Oh, let's give the devil a notice,
[2:21:23] somebody. Let's give the devil a notice,
[2:21:26] somebody.
[2:21:28] I don't know how many minutes notice you
[2:21:30] want to give the devil. Do you want to
[2:21:32] give him 5 minutes?
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Do you want to give him 3 minutes?
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Do you want to give him one minute?
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; No. Even now get out of this place. I
[2:21:44] declare now receive your healing.
[2:21:47] Receive your baby. Receive your heart as
[2:21:50] desire. You are in goshion. I will
[2:21:54] restore. Says the Lord. Now let me say
[2:21:58] to you this church, if God could restore
[2:22:00] us as the bride,
[2:22:03] why can't he restore what you lost?
[2:22:09] Why can't he restore your employment?
[2:22:12] Why can't he restore your home? You are
[2:22:16] already a candidate for restoration
[2:22:18] because you have been restored as the
[2:22:20] bride. So restoration is your second
[2:22:23] name.
[2:22:27] I said restoration is your second name.
[2:22:31] I am restoration.
[2:22:34] I am restoration.
[2:22:36] So tell the old man devil, rejoice not
[2:22:40] my enemy when I shall fall because I
[2:22:43] shall rise,
[2:22:45] my name is restoration. Don't laugh at
[2:22:48] me when I'm downh because one of the
[2:22:50] fine days you shall find me at the top.
[2:22:54] And you wonder how did he make it?
[2:22:56] Restoration.
[2:22:58] Restoration.
[2:23:00] Oh hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I will
[2:23:04] restore.
[2:23:05] Thus says the Lord. The yes,
[2:23:09] the yes,
[2:23:11] the yes. You have been losing for too
[2:23:14] long. But God is going to pay back. When
[2:23:17] God pays back, he pays back with
[2:23:20] interest.
[2:23:23] You heard it in the morning. When Job
[2:23:25] lost, he lost everything. But when he
[2:23:28] started coming back, it didn't just come
[2:23:30] back. It came double fold.
[2:23:34] It came double double.
[2:23:37] Can you say amen? Double for your
[2:23:39] trouble. I declare this evening, receive
[2:23:44] double for your trouble.
[2:23:50] I'll never forget a message that brother
[2:23:52] Jack preached when he came to our church
[2:23:54] one of the Easter meetings and he says,
[2:23:56] "The devil stole your childh when they
[2:23:58] are to be restored. They're coming back
[2:24:00] double
[2:24:03] because I'm hooking the other one and
[2:24:05] I'm winning both of them. Or let me say
[2:24:08] to sister right, receive your children
[2:24:11] right now. Receive your children right
[2:24:13] now. They are coming back. The devil has
[2:24:16] not taken any. He is a liar.
[2:24:20] Claim back what the devil stole from
[2:24:22] you. Your marriage is down. I will
[2:24:25] restore.
[2:24:27] Your finances are down. I will restore.
[2:24:31] Your family is down. I will restore.
[2:24:35] Whatever the situation is, I will
[2:24:38] restore.
[2:24:40] Oh, come on, praise God, somebody.
[2:24:43] Come on, praise God, somebody.
[2:24:46] Come on, praise God, somebody.
[2:24:49] Thank God for your restoration.
[2:24:52] I'm finished now. I'm going to give you
[2:24:54] just a few minutes to thank God for your
[2:24:56] restoration.
[2:25:00] This is restoration.
[2:25:02] I will restore.
[2:25:05] Thank God for your restoration. Whatever
[2:25:07] was stolen from you is coming back. Or
[2:25:11] as you are thanking him right now, he's
[2:25:13] coming back. I said he's coming back.
[2:25:17] You lost the joy of your salvation. He's
[2:25:19] coming back. You lost the baptism of the
[2:25:22] Holy Ghost. He's coming back. I said
[2:25:25] he's coming back. is coming back. He's
[2:25:28] coming back to somebody. He's coming
[2:25:30] back. The presence of the Lord is in
[2:25:33] this place. He's coming back.
[2:25:36] The devil is a liar. He's coming back.
[2:25:40] Oh, thank God for what is coming back.
[2:25:43] Oh, give him some praise tonight. Give
[2:25:45] him some praise tonight. He's coming
[2:25:48] back. God bless you, church. He's coming
[2:25:51] back. It's a restoration time. Brother
[2:25:54] Jack, you can come forward. He's coming
[2:25:56] back.
[2:25:58] God bless you. He's coming back.
[2:26:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:26:06] Glory to God in the highest. Oh, give
[2:26:09] him some praise, somebody.
[2:26:12] Shout hallelujah.
[2:26:14] Shout hallelujah.
[2:26:16] Shout's coming back.
[2:26:19] Shout restoration is mine. Oh
[2:26:22] hallelujah. Thank God for restoration.
[2:26:26] Thank God for these meetings. It's
[2:26:28] coming back.
[2:26:31] God bless you, brother. It's coming
[2:26:33] back.
[2:26:36] I'm finished.
[2:26:38] God bless you.
[2:27:03] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:27:05] Thank you, Father.
[2:27:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:27:12] Amen. Don't leave here empty-handed,
[2:27:14] church.
[2:27:16] The presence of the Lord is here to give
[2:27:17] you everything you have need of.
[2:27:20] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:27:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:27:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:27:31] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:27:34] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:27:38] My God.
[2:27:41] I'm reminded of Brother Random telling
[2:27:43] the story.
[2:27:45] He said the they went over to England
[2:27:48] looking for the Welsh Revival and they
[2:27:51] happened to run into a police officer
[2:27:54] and they began to talk to him to see if
[2:27:56] he could give directions as to where
[2:27:57] they could find the Welsh Revival. And
[2:28:00] when they asked for directions, the
[2:28:02] police officer responded and said, "Uh,
[2:28:04] I don't I can't send you to a place, but
[2:28:07] I can tell you where it is. I am the
[2:28:10] Welsh Revival." And if somebody's
[2:28:13] looking for restoration, they ought to
[2:28:15] be able to look right into your eyes.
[2:28:17] Amen. And get an answer from you tonight
[2:28:19] that you are the restoration. You don't
[2:28:22] have to look any further. Praise God.
[2:28:25] Amen. You are the restoration tonight. I
[2:28:28] tell you the truth. I thank God for the
[2:28:30] words. It's something about the word
[2:28:33] that sets us free.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:38] You saw how brother Whisperer just put
[2:28:41] the the pictures there to show, you
[2:28:44] know, it was darkness and Leodysa, but
[2:28:46] we're not Leodysans.
[2:28:49] We're the bride. And the prophet just
[2:28:51] put a little slither of light there
[2:28:53] representing you. Before you even knew
[2:28:56] what the picture was all about, he was
[2:28:58] representing you. In this dark age,
[2:29:02] there was a promise that was laying in
[2:29:04] the roots. And we are manifesting that
[2:29:07] promise. I'll restore
[2:29:10] saith the Lord.
[2:29:13] I think it's time to shout.
[2:29:18] I I think it's time to praise God.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; If you feel a little bit confined,
[2:29:26] I want to invite you to get out of your
[2:29:28] seats. Yes, sir.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship the Lord just a

[3:00:39] they they asked for one more song
[3:00:43] and it's a song
[3:00:45] we heard last year said I got a feeling
[3:00:49] everything going to be all right. Come
[3:00:52] on now.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Wait before y'all go there. Before
[3:00:55] y'all go there cuz M get yourself ready.
[3:00:58] Amen. M get yourself ready. A couple
[3:01:00] things I just need to announce. First of
[3:01:03] all, uh those of you that have fans, uh
[3:01:06] just make sure you give the fans back as
[3:01:08] you're going out of the doors so we can
[3:01:10] have them for tomorrow, uh if we need
[3:01:12] them. We hope that the air conditioning
[3:01:14] be up and running with no issues. But uh
[3:01:16] just make sure you give them to the
[3:01:18] brothers at the door as you are exiting.
[3:01:21] Amen. The other thing I wanted to do
[3:01:24] now, uh, as you know, it's always my
[3:01:28] secret to keep who the next preacher is,
[3:01:30] and I'm going to keep that one. You got
[3:01:32] to come and see. However, I'll give you,
[3:01:36] Amen, a revelation that on tomorrow
[3:01:39] night, the preacher that preached
[3:01:41] tonight will be preaching again on
[3:01:44] tomorrow night. Hallelujah.
[3:01:48] Now, I told y'all the Lord made you a
[3:01:51] promise.
[3:01:52] God told you that you're going to eat
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; in plenty. Yes, sir.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; And
[3:02:00] be satisfied.
[3:02:03] Does God keep his word?
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; And if he'll keep that word, he'll keep
[3:02:08] every word he spoke to you.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; Just hold on and don't give up.
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a word of prayer as we
[3:02:15] prepare to leave. But those of you that
[3:02:17] want to stay in fellowship a little bit,
[3:02:18] you're welcome to do that. Do so. We do
[3:02:21] have food trucks outside and uh you can
[3:02:23] get food right here. So, you can have
[3:02:25] some fellowship. I think we can be on
[3:02:26] the grounds until about midnight. So, uh
[3:02:29] please enjoy the fellowship. Let's have
[3:02:31] a word of prayer. Amen. As they get
[3:02:33] ready to sing this song. Father, we
[3:02:35] thank you for all that you have done in
[3:02:38] this place. We have been edified by the
[3:02:42] word of God. The prophet told us that
[3:02:45] once the bride recognizes who she is,
[3:02:48] then the rapture would go. And we thank
[3:02:51] you that Lord, the revelation was
[3:02:53] brought, just watch how it dovetail with
[3:02:55] the sermon uh this morning. Oh God, we
[3:02:58] just appreciate what we see you doing.
[3:03:00] Amen. In the ministry, it's the mind of
[3:03:02] God flowing through the ministry. And we
[3:03:05] thank you, Father, thus far for all that
[3:03:07] has happened. We know as we prepare for
[3:03:10] service in the morning, God, that you
[3:03:11] would just be with us in another in
[3:03:13] another uh special way. And God, we pray
[3:03:16] for all the other churches that would
[3:03:17] have service also in the morning that
[3:03:19] you would just move by your spirit,
[3:03:21] Lord, in every local congregation. We
[3:03:24] give you all the honor, all the glory,
[3:03:25] and all the praise as we leave this
[3:03:27] place, but not your presence. It's in
[3:03:28] Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
