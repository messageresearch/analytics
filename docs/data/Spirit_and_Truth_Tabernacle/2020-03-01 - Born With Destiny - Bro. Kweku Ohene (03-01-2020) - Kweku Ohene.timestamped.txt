[1:06:42] dedicated the baby and then January 20th
[1:06:45] the Lord kome dad home and it's just
[1:06:50] been a a wave of emotions and there's so
[1:06:54] many things have been going through
[1:06:56] during this seat but God has a way of
[1:07:01] encouraging
[1:07:02] when you're going through to let you
[1:07:05] know he's still with you he promise
[1:07:07] never to leave you nor forsake you and
[1:07:09] one of the big things that the Lord did
[1:07:13] even during the season God has blessed
[1:07:16] him with a new church I had a chance to
[1:07:26] go by and see the building on yesterday
[1:07:28] and you know I walked inside and saying
[1:07:31] oh my
[1:07:32] oh this is nice it went through another
[1:07:35] door and opened up and it was a big
[1:07:37] fellowship hall I say thanks kitchen and
[1:07:41] everything as it ran that's nice
[1:07:43] then he took me through another door it
[1:07:45] was an the sanctuary
[1:07:47] I say Lord Jesus I mean I was just blown
[1:07:56] away by what God did you know and I just
[1:08:01] as I looked at but I didn't get jealous
[1:08:04] I rejoiced begin to thank God for less
[1:08:07] than my precious brother Nasir
[1:08:10] especially during the season with them
[1:08:12] going through so much but my faith got
[1:08:14] ignited say Lord I know you got some
[1:08:20] and when I looked at that I say now this
[1:08:26] is what I call exceeding
[1:08:30] oh we can ask a thing all right that's
[1:08:36] the type of lesson that I saw there in a
[1:08:37] sec or I thought you ain't got much just
[1:08:40] saving the planet just to be saving
[1:08:41] money that's not what this is all the
[1:08:44] time we didn't really walk into some you
[1:08:49] know I'm just we just gonna wait on God
[1:08:51] we don't kinky keep calling it here hey
[1:08:54] man keep speaking the Scriptures over it
[1:08:56] is amen you know I mean he say I rejoice
[1:08:59] o you do you do it hey plant you so you
[1:09:04] know you know he wants to plant enough
[1:09:06] Senate place right he go he don't
[1:09:08] rejoice all this - it's good give us
[1:09:10] something right so I'm under expectation
[1:09:13] and and I'm looking for God to do some
[1:09:16] some miraculous things
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:25] a lot of churches out there God has done
[1:09:27] it for them so I'm just on the
[1:09:28] expectation for what you're gonna do for
[1:09:30] us soon
[1:09:31] and they
[1:09:32] a man a man a man you ain't in the right
[1:09:36] time to be a part of this miracle
[1:09:39] we all will be all in at the right time
[1:09:42] to be a part of this miracle a man I
[1:09:44] believe that I want to read a scripture
[1:09:46] before we call her the queen qu l get me
[1:09:49] Esther chapter four as we were just
[1:09:54] speaking in the dispensing that I don't
[1:09:58] even know how many years it's been now
[1:10:00] but typically we take as a church and
[1:10:04] what I like to call a corporate fast
[1:10:06] with us where everybody in the church
[1:10:08] gets involved in doing something as far
[1:10:10] as fasting for the next 21 days and
[1:10:14] we've been doing the Daniel Fast which
[1:10:16] is a just you can eat but you modify
[1:10:20] what you eat you actually don't eat it
[1:10:21] sweets no meat it's just more of
[1:10:25] vegetables and whole grains and
[1:10:28] things like that sister Erica can give
[1:10:31] you a lot more detail than I can on that
[1:10:36] but uh but it's it's kind of what Daniel
[1:10:39] and the Hebrew boys did you know they
[1:10:41] just ate a lot of pulse which was
[1:10:43] vegetables during that time for 21 days
[1:10:47] you know that they they didn't know if
[1:10:49] the toriel days but they did it for
[1:10:50] seven days but Daniel is waiting 21 days
[1:10:53] on a prayer to be answered so they they
[1:10:55] kind of to put them two together called
[1:10:58] the Daniel fast so I don't require that
[1:11:01] everybody do the Daniel fast if you want
[1:11:04] to do fasting the way that you fast
[1:11:06] that's fine you know there's something
[1:11:09] that might not be able to fast because
[1:11:11] of a health condition that's
[1:11:14] understandable I was telling my wife the
[1:11:17] waiter with the way she's feeling I
[1:11:19] didn't want her to try to take on a fast
[1:11:22] you know like that do something
[1:11:24] something else a little to find a
[1:11:26] different fast to do
[1:11:27] don't don't don't change too much when
[1:11:29] you when you're going through this much
[1:11:30] of your body don't do that
[1:11:33] and if anybody else is going through it
[1:11:35] what I know she's going through please
[1:11:37] use wisdom amen and what you're doing
[1:11:40] but just try to find something and
[1:11:43] technology is certainly something you
[1:11:45] can fast right technology if you're a TV
[1:11:48] watcher you can fast TV
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] praise the Lord if you're a basketball
[1:11:59] you know March Madness person you go
[1:12:03] you're gonna get mad watch your
[1:12:06] basketball
[1:12:08] hey man get mad and get glance alright
[1:12:13] but whatever fine and I'd like to call
[1:12:18] it corporate because we all should fast
[1:12:21] individually everybody should do that
[1:12:24] that should be a normal part of the
[1:12:26] Christian routine to fast and pray
[1:12:29] that's no but we do corporately and that
[1:12:32] means everybody get involved in this
[1:12:34] scripture NESTA's where everybody got
[1:12:36] involved in a fast this is Esther
[1:12:39] chapter 4 and verse 10
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:46] and again as the speaking to talk and
[1:12:49] gave him commandment unto Mordecai all
[1:12:52] the king's servants people of the king's
[1:12:54] provinces do know that was that
[1:12:58] whosoever whether man and woman shall
[1:13:00] come unto the king into the inner court
[1:13:03] who is not called there who's my call
[1:13:07] there is one law of his to put him to
[1:13:10] death except such to whom the King shall
[1:13:14] hold out the golden scepter that he may
[1:13:17] live but I have not been called to come
[1:13:19] into the King these thirty days and they
[1:13:22] told to Mordecai Esther's words the
[1:13:25] Mordecai commanded to answer as to think
[1:13:28] not with thyself
[1:13:30] that thou shall escape in the king's
[1:13:33] house because there was an edict etic
[1:13:35] going out that they were going to
[1:13:36] destroy all the Jews and even though
[1:13:38] essa was in the king's court our
[1:13:41] acquaintance in the house she was still
[1:13:44] Jew and the law said she would have to
[1:13:46] die here it is think not with ourselves
[1:13:50] that thou shalt escape in the king's
[1:13:53] house more than all the Jews but if thou
[1:13:57] altogether holdest that peace at this
[1:14:00] time then shall there enlargement and
[1:14:03] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:14:06] another place but thou in thy father's
[1:14:09] house the but thou and thy father's
[1:14:11] house shall be destroyed and who north
[1:14:14] whether thou art come to the kingdom for
[1:14:17] such a time as this I love that then as
[1:14:21] the being then returned Mordechai
[1:14:23] disaster go gather together all the Jews
[1:14:25] and a president shushing and fast be for
[1:14:29] me and neither eat nor drink three days
[1:14:33] night no night or day I also my man fast
[1:14:36] likewise in the soul will I go in unto
[1:14:39] the king which is not according to the
[1:14:41] law and if I perish I perish
[1:14:45] so Mordechai went his way and did
[1:14:47] according to all that and that commanded
[1:14:49] him and what it was was a corporate fast
[1:14:52] but all of them got involved they had a
[1:14:54] need they had a need they were about to
[1:14:57] lose their lives
[1:14:58] amen and everybody had to get involved
[1:15:00] on this before fun for an ester to go
[1:15:04] before the king God gave a favour and
[1:15:05] the Jews were delivered during that time
[1:15:07] we may not be in a situation where we're
[1:15:10] going to lose our lives but we all have
[1:15:12] needs
[1:15:13] all have needs I want to see I want to
[1:15:15] see restoration I won't see deliverance
[1:15:18] I want to see freedom hey man I want to
[1:15:23] see God do some things and a magnet and
[1:15:25] I believe through fasting a pretty well
[1:15:27] seat and I wanna I'm watching the devil

[1:15:32] I want to see God put a stop to the
[1:15:35] Devils Tracy I'm looking for God to do
[1:15:42] something I believe it started I believe

[1:27:12] God to them who are the called according
[1:27:14] to his purpose for whom he did foreknow
[1:27:17] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:27:21] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:27:23] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:27:26] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:27:28] he also called and whom he called them

[1:38:36] a head
[1:38:37] is a human church amen a church without
[1:38:41] Christ is just women because one is a
[1:38:44] church but if there's no hair there's no
[1:38:46] man to rule the church to control the
[1:38:49] church to prune the church to direct the
[1:38:52] church to be the king of the church to
[1:38:54] establish the church that is just one's
[1:38:56] name amen
[1:38:58] there's not Christ in the church they
[1:39:00] can clean Christ but is not Christ and
[1:39:03] I'm talking about individual amen we are
[1:39:05] a church if you claim to be a Christian
[1:39:08] you cannot femine a book when they ask
[1:39:11] you your religion what good some job or
[1:39:12] ask what religion religion you belong to
[1:39:14] or school I'm a Christian but if Christ
[1:39:17] is funny the French which is the woman
[1:39:19] then you are in the man's covenant you
[1:39:21] have a reason to the man's covenant amen
[1:39:25] so Jesus was as was a ram of God that
[1:39:29] was born for a purpose
[1:39:30] he had a destiny so forth destiny
[1:39:33] be born in April it wouldn't be won in
[1:39:35] any month he was ordained to be born as
[1:39:38] a tribe line of the tribe of Judah and
[1:39:40] it was around to be sacrificed for the
[1:39:42] world and for this purpose he has to
[1:39:45] come in April that's why they couldn't
[1:39:47] let him be born in in the e in the in is
[1:39:49] like a hotel or like a motel 6 some
[1:39:54] hotel when they wanted to go and lodge
[1:39:56] but God ordained him to be born among
[1:39:59] the RAM among the Sheep so God Himself
[1:40:01] put blacks in Mary and Joseph sweet they
[1:40:04] went to this Motel 6 they said no we
[1:40:06] can't let you guys in
[1:40:07] they want to motivate no if you want to
[1:40:09] pay even twice the price no way we don't
[1:40:12] want you here they went to a lot of
[1:40:14] plays no no we don't want you guys here
[1:40:15] because the Lord was little Mary and
[1:40:19] Joseph so that Jesus will be born as a
[1:40:21] ram emotion for your destiny and so
[1:40:27] certain things that you go through got a
[1:40:29] black you here you black you this way
[1:40:32] you move you here just leading you to
[1:40:35] the right place
[1:40:35] amen we are blessed reading them in the
[1:40:40] scriptures but when it was going going
[1:40:42] on they couldn't read in a screw so it
[1:40:45] was a trial it was a present a trial
[1:40:47] before Joseph and Mary why they have
[1:40:50] money to pay for it for the police why
[1:40:52] would they not accept it why were they
[1:40:54] not allowed in the inn because Jesus has
[1:40:56] to be born among sheep because he was
[1:40:58] around praise be to God amen glory
[1:41:02] hallelujah glory to God every one of us
[1:41:06] work was born under a certain month

[1:41:46] daughter of God under your feet to
[1:41:50] circumstances under your feet no matter
[1:41:52] how they are
[1:41:52] amen two quarters into situation to spit
[1:41:56] into assistance amen because you are
[1:41:59] born with a destiny as we read from
[1:42:04] Romans 8 the destiny is actually from
[1:42:08] predestination sorry destinies from a
[1:42:11] destination you are destined to arrive
[1:42:13] at some way now when you go back behind
[1:42:16] out what is predestination preemies
[1:42:18] before so before the destiny you have
[1:42:21] been ordained free ordained to arrive in

[1:42:28] arrive in wherever you have been ordered
[1:42:29] to go so that is your destiny
[1:42:32] but now between your predestination and
[1:42:34] the destiny you have to go through
[1:42:36] certain processes and that's what got a
[1:42:38] jack read for us you have to be
[1:42:40] justified you have to be called and
[1:42:43] justified and sanctified and then
[1:42:46] glorified for the destination that it
[1:42:48] wouldn't be amen so before the

[1:43:07] your ancestries we go back behind the
[1:43:09] generations
[1:43:10] put your ancestry in certain way so that
[1:43:12] you'll be born on a particular time to
[1:43:15] receive the weight that God has ordained
[1:43:17] for you to receive amen
[1:43:19] glory hallelujah amen if maybe you have
[1:43:22] one in the White House
[1:43:23] you didn't come near the weight but we
[1:43:26] are born as a team for family not in
[1:43:28] maybe in a minute not even a marriage
[1:43:30] but God or tendency God is not looking
[1:43:33] at the picture of your wedding what is
[1:43:36] looking at is seeding you a man
[1:43:38] what is not looking at your fault Amen
[1:43:41] this we cannot see a man when he went to
[1:43:45] the well in Samaria this was a wonder
[1:43:48] those who she was despite she could even
[1:43:50] go among the young girls who were
[1:43:52] virgins - well fetch water she was an
[1:43:54] outcast
[1:43:55] but it says seed that was his seed
[1:43:57] inhale and Jesus was looking directly at
[1:43:59] the seed not that not a caricature not a
[1:44:03] shack in the shack that was a seed so
[1:44:06] you wanted to bring this it out and
[1:44:08] everything we take his pleas and so when
[1:44:10] the word caught the word the seeds come
[1:44:12] out and all the seven husbands they were
[1:44:15] done away with the success banner and
[1:44:17] you've got married to Jesus Christ the
[1:44:18] Son of God amen
[1:44:20] all your cents or your combinations God
[1:44:23] has a look at it is looking at this seed
[1:44:24] that is placing you and when you accept
[1:44:27] their way when you get obedient to their
[1:44:29] word and the word captivate your heart
[1:44:30] then the word trans from your heart and
[1:44:32] all that shock and not the atmosphere
[1:44:34] come under the suggestion of the way
[1:44:36] glory hallelujah
[1:44:38] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:44:41] glory to God so now we're going to start
[1:44:44] with a I am Aries Jesus was born in
[1:44:47] Aries which is April much improved there
[1:44:50] about actually if I remember exactly but
[1:44:52] ROM give at this that Jesus was born in
[1:44:54] December 12 if I remember there was one
[1:44:56] goods if you bring it to our time it
[1:44:59] will disable when Jesus was born of
[1:45:01] Ramos Bonnie sorry April 12 forgive me
[1:45:04] but I was born in April and sexy and
[1:45:06] Christ was born in April the 12 amen
[1:45:10] they were all under the sign of Iran
[1:45:12] when Jesus was born
[1:45:14] Trista's cross because there was a gift
[1:45:17] of God divine healing on to the eighth a
[1:45:19] Cecilia when he was born the devil knew
[1:45:23] this guy was Assyria
[1:45:24] because of him they killed thousands of
[1:45:26] children just to make sure that by
[1:45:28] statistics they could get rid of Jesus
[1:45:29] but in love the Lord took Mary and
[1:45:31] Joseph take the child and send it to
[1:45:34] Egypt when highly until I tell you so
[1:45:37] Jesus was peacefully kept in Egypt when
[1:45:39] they were slaughtering young boys in
[1:45:41] Judea amen so goddess L suppose for your
[1:45:45] life nothing can touch you because of
[1:45:48] their purpose because of the destiny
[1:45:50] that is encompassing your life that is
[1:45:53] enclosing you no demon can take your
[1:45:55] life no sickness can terminate your life
[1:45:58] because you have a destiny on this earth
[1:46:00] to fulfill blessed be the name of the
[1:46:02] Lord so after that Jesus was brought
[1:46:04] back to fulfill his destiny he was
[1:46:07] around and let's read a Exodus chapter
[1:46:09] 30 Exodus 3:14 Exodus 3:14 and God said
[1:46:15] unto Moses Moses was called by God and
[1:46:19] he wanted to find out everybody has got

[1:46:49] wow you are who you are what kind of
[1:46:52] limits this you should have a name Moses
[1:46:56] was Martino garrison name but it wasn't
[1:46:58] a for the Lord to review so he just said
[1:47:00] that I am that I am he that created
[1:47:03] heaven and earth he that put bread in
[1:47:05] Pharaoh tell him that I am that I am
[1:47:07] sent you so he said and he say
[1:47:11] and God said unto Moses I am that I am
[1:47:14] and he said thou shalt thus shalt thou

[1:47:21] so but a jacket is sent himself Here I
[1:47:23] am send him on to you Amen God ordained
[1:47:27] your posture for you
[1:47:28] amen if I remember that Solomon probably
[1:47:31] last year he was sick if I remember he
[1:47:33] said he'd even to the family and he
[1:47:35] didn't want his wife to worry didn't
[1:47:37] want children to worry but he was going
[1:47:38] through some sickness issue and will
[1:47:40] move himself to come to church on Sunday
[1:47:43] he went to brother Jack's office said
[1:47:44] the moment he touched me pray for me the
[1:47:46] sickness would vanished amen I am that I
[1:47:50] am has sent you if you receive that one
[1:47:53] God has sent to you if you want to do
[1:47:55] the will of the Lord then we receive he
[1:47:57] who has sent unto you Amen if you reject
[1:48:00] he who he sent to you you have a refine
[1:48:03] difficult times on this earth but you
[1:48:04] receive His Word from the Hamas 7 of God
[1:48:07] the way is going to lead you into
[1:48:10] prosperity and blessing glory hallelujah
[1:48:14] Jonah so under I am John chapter 8 verse
[1:48:17] 24 I said the phone to you that ye shall
[1:48:20] die in your sins for except you believe
[1:48:22] that I am he he shall die in your sins
[1:48:25] so Jesus was when was on earth he was
[1:48:27] also used I am except you believe in me
[1:48:30] that I am the god of Moses I am Jehovah
[1:48:35] the same Jehovah has put on a skin you
[1:48:39] die in your sins because the people
[1:48:41] could not believe with your intellectual
[1:48:42] how can you tell us that way you annoy

[1:49:03] because they are reason from here that
[1:49:06] everyone know enter your mind
[1:49:07] and he's speaking from his heart amen
[1:49:10] light and darkness they don't be
[1:49:11] together amen
[1:49:13] glory hallelujah but he said I am and
[1:49:17] just a we didn't preach I am I am the
[1:49:20] son of God I am the son of David I am
[1:49:22] the son of man let's read let's read
[1:49:26] that is I am I use certain examples for
[1:49:29] you now in the olden days certain cities
[1:49:32] named their cities the fence before God
[1:49:35] roots that is the one God Himself root
[1:49:37] was the zodiac it wasn't a Bible that a
[1:49:41] man can tamper with it you can revise
[1:49:43] that Bible is what God made a man and
[1:49:48] the zodia is that is the universe is the
[1:49:52] Stars the moon the Sun the Sun
[1:49:54] represented Christ the Son of God
[1:49:56] su and s when the moon is the wife of
[1:49:59] Jesus Christ and all the stars as we
[1:50:01] read represents us and daughters of God
[1:50:03] in the various manifestation remember
[1:50:06] Jack was in a Hawkinson brothers live in
[1:50:08] a cold country it's comfortable here in
[1:50:11] West Palm Beach when everything's all
[1:50:13] green beautiful godliness different ways
[1:50:16] somebody can live in a good country
[1:50:18] Canada there's any place in Canada is so
[1:50:20] called Russia you want a hug they live
[1:50:22] over there
[1:50:23] some people can also live how do you
[1:50:24] live in the heat in Florida in such a
[1:50:27] steal
[1:50:28] how do you do that so God ordained each
[1:50:31] and every one in various manifestation
[1:50:32] to manifest himself amen I am that I am
[1:50:36] amen so God was a ram born in April as a
[1:50:42] savior to bleed to blood and lamps and
[1:50:45] don't they don't their life is making
[1:50:47] their life easily they are sacrificial
[1:50:49] animals they use them to sacrifice so
[1:50:51] Jesus as a sacrifice or their power to
[1:50:54] even called angels or speak for the
[1:50:57] world to even move out of existence to
[1:51:00] destroy those who came to crucify him
[1:51:02] but because it was around he willingly
[1:51:04] gave His life that you
[1:51:07] if I die you and I will have a place in
[1:51:09] the kingdom of God glory hallelujah amen
[1:51:11] so he called you by your name Amen
[1:51:14] he didn't call you by your good works
[1:51:16] you conned you and perfected you he
[1:51:19] called you and qualified you didn't call
[1:51:22] it because you qualified by you called
[1:51:23] you and I and qualified as as sons and
[1:51:26] daughters of God amen by the old faith
[1:51:29] none of us could claim sonship of God or
[1:51:32] in total shape of God but by the new bed
[1:51:34] by grits and predestination he wash all
[1:51:37] your sins he consumed the old person and
[1:51:39] Christ himself took over his house
[1:51:41] renovated the house watch all the census
[1:51:44] records diseases watch diabetes watch a
[1:51:47] cancer watch politician watch
[1:51:50] drunkenness or abortion watch crime
[1:51:53] watch criminal spirits consume all of
[1:51:55] them so that means of can't dwell in
[1:51:57] this Tabernacle to manifest himself amen
[1:52:00] blessed be the name of the Lord so for
[1:52:03] the round that is a sacrifice now let's
[1:52:04] go to another house Taurus Taurus is
[1:52:07] another means I have every Smith I am
[1:52:11] Taurus is I have let's read a scripture
[1:52:14] john 6:66 t 8 john 16 then Simon Peter
[1:52:17] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[1:52:20] thou hast the words of eternal life I
[1:52:23] have Jesus had a waist of eternal life
[1:52:27] to give so Peter saw that we've been
[1:52:30] with this high priest for long the hours
[1:52:32] are just denominational ways we have
[1:52:33] been sacrificing lambs and bulls we
[1:52:35] don't see no supernatural we don't see
[1:52:37] divine healing but we saw this young man
[1:52:39] Jesus of Nazareth do the column demon
[1:52:41] they are the customer from among
[1:52:43] themselves but he lay her something when
[1:52:45] they are healed the West that come from
[1:52:47] his heart is healing to my heart how am
[1:52:50] I going to desert this man and go away
[1:52:52] go back to my old Pharisee church or go
[1:52:55] to the Sadducees who are full of crime
[1:52:57] hypocrisy
[1:52:58] I'm not going to go back our stick with
[1:53:00] Jesus do an honest adronis not all his
[1:53:03] weight though his words are mr. Collier
[1:53:05] mysterious but I could see Jehovah God
[1:53:08] in him
[1:53:08] man I'm gonna stick with him glory
[1:53:11] hallelujah now to loose a I have let's
[1:53:14] read a Jeremiah 29:11 to 13 11 for I

[1:53:24] thought that I have for you their
[1:53:27] thought not just thinking but I have is
[1:53:29] real substance for you says the Lord
[1:53:33] thought of peace and not of evil to give
[1:53:35] you an expert an end then shall ye call
[1:53:38] upon me and he shall go and pray unto me
[1:53:41] and now he came unto you and ye shall
[1:53:43] seek me and find me
[1:53:45] Anisha says for me with all your heart
[1:53:49] amen if you seek the Lord with all your
[1:53:51] heart you find him amen
[1:53:53] because it have you already in his hands

[1:54:02] godliness
[1:54:02] you were solely in the palm of his hands
[1:54:05] his love covered you he said an angel
[1:54:08] around you you could have been dead HIV
[1:54:11] could have killed you Karuna my virus
[1:54:13] would have infected you and have died of
[1:54:15] tuberculosis drowned adaboost live and

[1:54:20] amen covered around you because of the
[1:54:24] seed not because of your anything that
[1:54:26] you did but he was another seed in your
[1:54:29] heart
[1:54:30] and appointed time because he was good
[1:54:32] toward quitting the seat at the right
[1:54:34] time so when the right time came the way
[1:54:36] it touched away and there was a
[1:54:39] manifestation of a man
[1:54:40] glory be to the Lord amen I have now

[1:58:54] was the death of Lazarus and the Jews
[1:58:57] also within which came to with her he
[1:58:59] groaned in the spirit and was troubled
[1:59:01] and said where have you led him they
[1:59:04] said unto Him Lord come and see
[1:59:07] jesus wept that was the only place if I
[1:59:09] remembers recorded that Jesus wept
[1:59:11] because it can be touched by the feeling
[1:59:14] of your infirmity then the Jews then
[1:59:18] said the Jews behold how he loved him
[1:59:20] even the Jews saw that he really loved
[1:59:22] Lazarus Mary and Martha because when he
[1:59:25] went they he wept as a human being he
[1:59:28] felt what Mary and Martha were going
[1:59:30] through the only brother maybe he was in
[1:59:33] the olden days is not like a time that
[1:59:34] women can work on their own if you have

[1:59:38] you can even her even in America in
[1:59:40] about maybe 200 plus years ago if the
[1:59:43] father or husband died they should be a
[1:59:45] man to take off the family land or
[1:59:47] whatever because women cannot inherit

[1:59:50] cousin somebody a near kinsman to take

[2:08:52] you if they smell you around you are in
[2:08:54] trouble they're gonna hunt for you
[2:08:55] because you're territorial militia so
[2:09:00] they're protective of what they have do
[2:09:04] mess around your tail tree do mess
[2:09:07] around a son or daughter of God if the
[2:09:09] Lord see you touching his daughter
[2:09:11] touching his son sit down you're in
[2:09:14] trouble
[2:09:14] amen because gotta get around you
[2:09:18] Revelation chapter 5 is 5 and one of the
[2:09:21] elders said unto me weep not that was
[2:09:24] John weep nor behold the Lion of the
[2:09:26] tribe of Judah the root of David has
[2:09:28] prevailed to open the book and to lose
[2:09:31] the services they're off
[2:09:32] amen Romans 8:32 he that spared not his
[2:09:37] own son but delivered him up for us all
[2:09:39] how shall he not with him also freely
[2:09:43] give us all things
[2:09:44] let's go to Genesis 49 811 Judah thou
[2:09:49] art he whom that British I priests the
[2:09:52] hand shall be in the neck of the enemies
[2:09:54] the fairest children shall bow before
[2:09:57] thee Judah is a lion's wall from the pre
[2:10:00] my son thou art grown up he stood down
[2:10:03] he couched as a lion and as an old lion
[2:10:07] who shall rouse him up the Skepta shall
[2:10:11] not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver
[2:10:13] from between his feet until Shiloh calm
[2:10:15] and on and on to him shall the gathering
[2:10:18] of the people be shallow is Christ
[2:10:20] so Jagger was prophets and when he was
[2:10:23] about to die colors it all his children
[2:10:24] and the professor prophesy upon Judah
[2:10:26] Judah was standing for the tribe of
[2:10:28] Judah when Jesus Christ out of which
[2:10:30] Jesus Christ will be born amen David
[2:10:34] son of David they came for the same
[2:10:36] lineage amen if you look at the nitrite
[2:10:39] is so interesting but we want to go for
[2:10:41] it
[2:10:41] so the Judah is a protector is a
[2:10:43] possessor nothing you can't take nothing
[2:10:46] from a lion when you go to a African
[2:10:48] certain places they said Abram he was he
[2:10:51] went to some of those pleas that when I
[2:10:52] lie on screen even the elephant keeps
[2:10:56] quiet even the cricket the talking
[2:10:58] cricket the elephant doesn't a lion
[2:11:01] doesn't eat cricket but I know that they
[2:11:03] skip the akina's booking so even the
[2:11:05] cricket the aunt all of them salute
[2:11:08] they cannot spoken there must be a news
[2:11:10] so when a lion is about to go out to eat
[2:11:13] eat give a certain sound to know that I
[2:11:16] am The King I am going out to eat don't
[2:11:19] mess around stay away from my arena stay
[2:11:22] away from my horizon if I see you you
[2:11:25] end up in me so you give a sound amen
[2:11:29] the Lord give a sound sit on one of my
[2:11:32] children if you have got one of my
[2:11:34] children I'm coming after you I all did
[2:11:37] them they are my eaglet you can keep
[2:11:40] them under chicken cook for a while but
[2:11:42] you cannot possess them they are mine I
[2:11:44] know them by name descriptions for four
[2:11:48] I took my children amen
[2:11:53] so nothing no son of cannot even one out
[2:11:55] of the millions and billions of sons of
[2:11:57] God God owner value is not even one
[2:12:00] because you loose you by your name
[2:12:04] hallelujah that's why I said I've
[2:12:06] applied in talking on your loved ones on
[2:12:08] your children on your grandchildren on
[2:12:11] your appearance on your wife on your
[2:12:14] husband on your ankles on your family
[2:12:16] just pick the way to them there when is
[2:12:19] life form and when you speak from your
[2:12:21] heart we defeat there when it's an
[2:12:23] embodiment it to go with a transforming
[2:12:25] power of God and wake up on them amen
[2:12:27] remember sister hid your eyes children
[2:12:29] they were a vagabond they were laughing
[2:12:31] in the face of the prophet but is she
[2:12:33] said the right thing and a few of the
[2:12:35] Lord came to us and tell us tell me what

[2:13:04] your way so that it fit and you come out
[2:13:06] why didn't the Lord allow Jesus to go
[2:13:10] any Lazarus when he was sick he never
[2:13:13] felt led to go he never felt led to
[2:13:15] improve for her for him sometime the
[2:13:18] past might be that intense is not in his
[2:13:20] power is the Lord man lead why didn't
[2:13:22] the pastor visit me when I was sick the

[2:46:43] run in your life God put it there for

[2:47:08] of Christ and the rainbow is Atena is
[2:47:12] heavenly is Silesia
[2:47:13] dimension and so Christ and his wife has
[2:47:16] become United
[2:47:17] is living in his wife he's become one
[2:47:20] with him it's manifesting in our heart
[2:47:22] and so God has put said in telling you
[2:47:25] to give you a blessing if you can be
[2:47:27] sensitive that what is sensitive to him
[2:47:29] there's too much noise in our mind

[2:49:04] time so I use the two E's exactly two is
[2:49:07] they call me back and restore me to the
[2:49:09] internship death in real I know the Lord
[2:49:12] was speaking to me so it was it was on a
[2:49:13] vehicle so you have to open your eyes I
[2:49:16] said son of God if you can't get
[2:49:19] sensitive to the Holy Ghost because we
[2:49:21] are born for a destiny with
[2:49:23] for eternal purpose a lot of the
[2:49:26] problems to be done I would be silent
[2:49:28] and listen to the Annamma the lost speak
[2:49:31] from within out to you to us but many a
[2:49:34] times we don't listen
[2:49:35] many times what we hear here is good
[2:49:37] even what you hear from the pulpit when
[2:49:39] you go back when digested again when
[2:49:42] think tank or even blessed with a
[2:49:44] technology we can listen to sermons you
[2:49:47] know what are you rooted or not you can
[2:49:48] go and listen to it backward but I
[2:49:50] preach but a job preach and not absorb
[2:49:52] it in your hands and your hard to build
[2:49:55] your your your chest was swell would
[2:49:57] revolution business Christ because when
[2:49:59] trials comes it's not your power is the
[2:50:01] revelation of Christ in you that will
[2:50:03] become their trials is a revelation you
[2:50:05] now bring victory in your situation so
[2:50:08] the more you practice revelation in you
[2:50:10] the more they would understand Jesus was
[2:50:11] not a big magic giant who was able to
[2:50:14] fight the devil no you just about it was
[2:50:17] fasting all the time so he wasn't he was
[2:50:19] skinny person he didn't have too much
[2:50:22] flesh on him because my pattern your
[2:50:24] brain was on him but the authority there
[2:50:28] praise the fasten the word the
[2:50:32] revelation was in him so when the devil
[2:50:34] comes demons are attack him yes God
[2:50:37] Allah redeem us to attack him they tell
[2:50:39] you a devil you are you are even notice
[2:50:41] that a demon you are Beelzebub visible
[2:50:43] means king of all the devils look at the
[2:50:45] devil challenges us is a devil that's
[2:50:48] how the monster the most won't be
[2:50:50] exposed so they point to that you you
[2:50:52] you are the devil you are the one that
[2:50:53] troublemaker one time Elijah Kin Kin Kin
[2:50:57] and this was husband wasn't in a hub he
[2:51:01] was I mean blaming like Elijah then all
[2:51:05] the troubles in Israel Elijah you are
[2:51:07] the cause of it unless said I'm not a
[2:51:10] cause but your sense and it was of your
[2:51:12] wife disable that is causing the frozen
[2:51:14] Israel so that always quick to point
[2:51:16] fingers but when you know your position
[2:51:18] and when this is reached in your heart
[2:51:21] my sister it doesn't matter I don't have
[2:51:23] to be a brother you do have to be
[2:51:24] brother Jack to overcome your situation
[2:51:26] but but you cannot be at your way please
[2:51:28] you can
[2:51:29] be in your home you and your home you
[2:51:32] are new to school you're on the street
[2:51:34] you are driving a highway you have to
[2:51:36] have the Holy Ghost and you should be
[2:51:38] sensitive and tightened down when
[2:51:40] situation arise don't be quick to act
[2:51:42] don't be quick to judge calm down let it
[2:51:46] in a man talk to you and see what the
[2:51:48] inner man you see it's not everything
[2:51:50] you have to see something they are
[2:51:52] certain that the answer is silent and
[2:51:55] let it in a man wake him so far because
[2:51:58] in you in your situation when you
[2:51:59] quickly act you can act wrongly you
[2:52:02] could act not based on what Christ
[2:52:05] wanted to do but based on your flesh
[2:52:06] missing on your right
[2:52:08] America is what people's right you're
[2:52:10] gonna be a judge and your lawyer but let
[2:52:13] Jesus Christ represents you calm
[2:52:15] yourself down when you see one you think
[2:52:17] you are getting angry don't talk
[2:52:20] if you somebody's upsetting you don't
[2:52:23] talk whatever please home whatever relax
[2:52:27] let the Holy Ghost come down Jesus had
[2:52:31] all their power they accused him falsely
[2:52:33] it is nothing they pull his beard
[2:52:36] it is nothing he says when the Holy
[2:52:39] Ghost lead him to see you Lisa when they
[2:52:42] said when what what the king is that I
[2:52:45] can't set you free care responds then
[2:52:47] you don't have you can set me free what
[2:52:49] I'm going through the Lord God allowed
[2:52:50] me to go through the only who see me
[2:52:51] tell me if you don't have power over me
[2:52:53] and listen nothing no more because was
[2:52:56] anointed and led of the Spirit like a
[2:52:59] ram you just got a lie on site when it's
[2:53:02] time to use it to defeat the devil but
[2:53:05] you don't use the lie on that hey I'm a
[2:53:06] child of God
[2:53:07] how dare you touch me this really aren't
[2:53:10] this you're gonna act this on pride but
[2:53:13] not on their way and if a lot away
[2:53:16] situation would take out themselves at
[2:53:18] the situation the Holy Ghost knew take
[2:53:20] off situation somebody can slap in your
[2:53:23] face you know have to be good you are
[2:53:24] going to act pray for him or her and let
[2:53:28] the Holy Ghost think of the situation
[2:53:30] maybe didn't say where he kicked you in
[2:53:32] the face you prove god bless you that is
[2:53:35] more than punching back in the face
[2:53:37] because it's not normal for you to point
[2:53:39] somebody in America
[2:53:41] and the person tells you god bless you
[2:53:42] it doesn't happen so that is more of a
[2:53:45] punch than punching him back do you get

[3:01:25] never heard a sermon like that and all
[3:01:29] my years I just loved the way that he
[3:01:33] set it up taking us through some quotes
[3:01:37] there and tying it back to the Zodiac
[3:01:42] brother brand under the random talked
[3:01:45] about he met me when amongst
[3:01:49] Pentecostals for the first time and he
[3:01:52] says there was a few preachers there but
[3:01:55] he said it was a older gentleman that
[3:01:57] got got the preaching they say he he
[3:02:00] said he went way up and brought him down
[3:02:03] the horizontal rainbow and just say he
[3:02:06] just preached and and he preached Christ
[3:02:09] said at a level is this
[3:02:10] he said just really you know you know
[3:02:13] talking about how job said where were
[3:02:14] you when the sons of God shouted for joy
[3:02:16] and Morningstar so sing sing together
[3:02:18] say he was way up there and you know we
[3:02:21] know that he talked the brother Braylon
[3:02:23] told us about the Bibles of the zodiac
[3:02:25] being the first Bible that got wrote and
[3:02:28] but I just never heard anybody just take
[3:02:31] the zodiac and put it in a script and he
[3:02:39] every every sign was identified
[3:02:43] everybody know who they are
[3:02:46] and if you were born under Sun then you
[3:02:50] should know what your destiny is oh come
[3:02:54] on
[3:02:55] right hey man I'm if you if you were
[3:02:58] cancer I feel that's gonna be part of
[3:03:02] your nature
[3:03:03] right if you were Sagittarius I know
[3:03:06] that's gonna be part of your nature
[3:03:08] right Taurus I have that's gonna be
[3:03:11] partyi nature Aries I am that's gonna be
[3:03:15] part of nature
[3:03:16] leo possess that's gonna be part of the
[3:03:25] nature man I tell you the truth that
[3:03:30] Scorpio penetrates right I've taken this
[3:03:34] distance just bless my heart not like I
[3:03:37] never heard nobody do that before just
[3:03:42] glad it happened that spirit and truth I
[3:03:52] just felt like a good foundation was
[3:03:55] being laid there right a good foundation
[3:04:00] and and and and I'm one that I believe
[3:04:02] that enemy is certainly getting us too
[3:04:05] busy where it's hard to hear the voice
[3:04:09] of God
[3:04:10] all right and so when we could just kind
[3:04:13] of slow down a little bit and get this
[3:04:15] there maybe it helps us in our journey
[3:04:18] you know I mean and like I said I don't
[3:04:22] know
[3:04:23] I'm I don't want to make light of you
[3:04:30] know different trials that we go through
[3:04:32] and and things like that but understand
[3:04:34] no matter what the trial is that the a
[3:04:37] name is bringing or being allowed to
[3:04:38] bring into your life that is an attack
[3:04:41] to try to get you off of the destiny
[3:04:43] that God has for you right and so so if
[3:04:48] you can't allow the trial to get you
[3:04:49] wrapped up in your emotion a man and you
[3:04:52] know just you just miss what God is
[3:04:55] doing because you because of the way you
[3:04:56] feel I feel I feel well what does the
[3:04:59] Bible say you know what does God's Word
[3:05:02] say about it right and at some point in
[3:05:04] time you got to come back to that and
[3:05:06] declare you stand based on the Word of
[3:05:08] God not based on how you feel a man a
[3:05:11] man a man you know I had a little
[3:05:14] something just come up here recently you
