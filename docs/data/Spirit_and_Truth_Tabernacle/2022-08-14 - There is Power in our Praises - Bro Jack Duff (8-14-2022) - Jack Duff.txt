give brother brother Troy a chance to really think about a song that he want to sing because that was very fitting the Lord has been good to us praise the Lord we've been wanting to move here to West Palm Beach for a long time even before we came from South Carolina this was the place that we wanted to come but the Lord didn't provide a job here he provided a job near my hometown so that's where we moved but we've always wanted to come here so back in may we decided to put our house on the market and the real estate agent he came by the house and he was there and um we signed the papers and he said you know I have a client that's supposed to close tomorrow but I want to call them so he called them and uh they wanted to to come by and see the house they came by that night and that morning we went on a contract strange thing is after a few weeks things didn't go the way that they needed it to go so they had to pull out of the contract so we put our house on the market on the market and we had somebody else go on the contract but they seem to want everything fixed they they had shopped around in every house that they liked they said we need this fix and the people said no we're not going to fix it we're not going to fix it so with us they said we need this fix we say we'll do it because we want to give them the best we don't want to give them something bad it's going to be their home so we agree we'll fix this okay will you fix this we'll fix this what about this we'll give you credit towards that you can get a new uh dishwasher they pulled out a contract so we come to the third time and uh but actually as we were preparing the house we were going to get the roof fixed so the roofer that came by his name was Paul he was a very very nice man so Paul he set it up where we had this this way we can pay it off real quick quickly so and we spoke with Paul and then um we got the house inspected so when the inspector came by his name was Paul it's like this is this is strange didn't think nothing of it not too much but then when we had to get someone to look at the air conditioner two guys came out it was a Matt Matthew and a Paul so we were speaking to the real estate agent and Nell was like man that's three paws I know about Paul where's my Elijah so um they pulled out they actually pulled out the date of the meetings that Friday of the meetings so we came to church had a great weekend while we were in between the services on Sunday we had an open house people came by and then we had a few visitors uh Monday morning well Monday night the real estate agent called about nine o'clock said can I come by I said yeah you can come by so he came by the house and it's like I have two offers for you one is from a corporation and they are offering this amount of money I said oh that's good that's real good I said and then we have another buyer he's actually a FHA buyer so there may be some problems but this is his offer he said you know I did some research on the company they're a legitimate company and I did some research on a this buyer so right before I go there Sunday Naomi was out out talking about speaking with two of the sisters from London and as they were talking they almost telling them about the open house and everything and she was just speaking with him and the sisters both turned at the same time and said I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus they looked at one another and started laughing because they they said it both at the same time so when he began to tell us about this buyer with the FHA loan said his name is Eli that's what I said wait man isn't Eli short for Elijah yeah that's all about it praise the Lord so different things are going on everything just seemed to just keep rolling keep rolling we had our appraisal come up I asked the brothers to pray and sister name Naomi I guess she had the sisters to pray so when the appraiser came out he came out and he was an hour late he came in the house and he was there four minutes and he was gone and then that night was it the same night that very night we got results back that it appraised for more than what we thought it would so the real estate agent said hey uh tell them she can start packing because y'all May close by Thursday or Friday so praise the Lord [Music] he's been very good to me amen our heart's desire has always been here amen especially having our children here they need fellowship with Saints and we need to be here every time the church doors open so that is our sincere prayer praise the Lord God bless you and thank you

there to Michigan Ohio and I just had wonderful wonderful time while we were there um the banquet for the Youth and the Lord just put in my spirit to speak to them about turning points and we just had a good time with that and then the concert or the night of worship I should call it on Saturday night just went very very well and they have already kind of put it in the atmosphere that they want to come to Florida and uh I am I'm I just know that if God send them to Florida God got to have a place for them to come hey man here in Florida so uh I was just kind of catching up on some of my Bible reading and I gotta I got a head of myself and uh there was uh the devotion for tomorrow it says the glory of the latter house has promised to be greater than the former house the children of Israel experienced that but God's promises can be applied in all generations therefore I am under expectation and I am claiming this for our first church building the glory of owning Hallelujah the glory of owning will be greater than renting so we're speaking that by faith and we look forward to being able to host the Saints amen that want to come here to Florida so I say Lord you know you have to provide you you have to do it we just trust him all the way through Amen on all things before I get ahead of myself but we we enjoyed that and then um Sunday morning I was there brother Brown is church and you know we are preaching the sermon of their rock is not like our Rock and at the end of that sermon there was a sister who wow they were just in the spirit and the sister began to speak in tongues and I just watched how the whole church just got real quiet everybody they would train train you know and they knew when God would speak just everybody uh wait to hear you know what the Lord's gonna say and uh so the lord gave it a tongue and then God gave it interpretation and I didn't get all of it but I know she said remember this day remember this day and I'm like Lord I'm gonna remember this day you know because uh you know I just believe God has something there amen a force and I'm under expectation for greater things amen from the Lord I had a card here that I wanted to read to you and before I do that let me uh say I did appreciate the specials and it was praise the Lord amen and uh so good uh that our Deacon is celebrating his birthday amen today in the house of Lord a happy birthday decompass amen praise God but we we just appreciate Amen brother Troy and uh my my my big brother my older brother and just just appreciate him uh and all that he does is his wisdom sometimes I when he talk I just hit my daddy talking all through him you know but uh but we learned from Daddy you know so we just we just appreciate the Lord I got this this uh this this this this um um card here says those who give of their time are truly generous and uh since just just saying thank you don't seem enough I hope you know how appreciated uh and loved you really are just blessings to the Saints at s.a.t Tabernacle uh thank you for the warm and Open Hearts that Embrace US during our time spent with you a difficult time with the sudden loss of barrel which is Sister wasting was made more uh bearable because of your love support and generosity Pastor Jack family and worshipers at SCT Tabernacle thank you may He Who rewards openly those things done in secret pour you out uh pour you out blessing that you won't be able to contain amen I'm receiving that amen amen it says love um always this is from uh brother Rupert's Sister video and brother Glenn Roy a man who came to visit with us and uh they were just really really uh blessed uh just with their time here so we thank God that we're able to host them and certainly look forward to them returning again amen amen amen amen uh he probably wouldn't want me to say this but you know before he left he just said he had to be a blessing here to the church and it gave us very very substantial um uh offering to our church and we just we just really appreciate that we like I tell people we don't do things in order to try to get uh but uh but you know the Lord puts it in people's heart to give so we we receive and and don't be so uh uh surprise that you can't receive right because what happens when you receive you actually open up the channels of blessing for the person that's giving right so so anytime somebody's trying to give you something you know just thank you amen appreciate it praise the Lord amen now I don't need it yeah I might not need it but I thank you for it all right Church all right but that's the way we want to be but we we really really thank God for them just having that in their heart to do that amen uh um oh the other thing I want to mention here really quick I know that we we talk about uh our giving and um for some reason and I've been using PayPal for a long time but some reason PayPal has kind of changed something and what PayPal is doing is they automatically assigning it as a good or service rather than allowing you to send to a friend a family member and since you have it as a good of service they automatically take a certain money amount of money out and that's that's my tithing that I'm paying God and I ain't paying that to PayPal I'm paying God right I give God my tithing right so so so uh I want to encourage y'all if PayPal can't get this fixed use some of the other means sale or cash app amen use use one of them because we ain't giving it the PayPal amen PayPal be need to give it to us right but uh but but I want to just encourage you you know to do that if you can because uh they they just and I went through trying to do all kind of things how come this thing won't let me change this and I went men multiple times but I noticed they just keep taking it keep taking say okay I got it I gotta I gotta fix for you his name is Zale [Music] God is good all right so keep that in mind musicians thank y'all so much I sure appreciate y'all amen amen so on today Brothers uh want to just ask that you all would just help us and today we have to do something a little different than we had to do since we've been here today we actually have to take everything out of the room and not just across the hall but we have to use our storage that the that we've been using we gotta unload uh put it all on the back of the trucks and and and and out and uh we got to bring it back so Wednesday night we got to bring certain things back and this is why we what I'm trying to do is kind of um yeah simplify things that's why you see me using this and I like using this because this is something my daddy made right so it's special to me amen my daddy designed this sometimes he would like to get to working with wood and and he left something behind uh for all of us to be able to enjoy so so I like working with this a little different a little different but nonetheless it's it's uh it's precious to me so uh we're trying to simplify some of the things that we're doing uh so that it's not as much to do but but yes we do have to break everything down and Fridays and I mean uh Wednesdays and Fridays we'll be doing you know a little setup and breakdown and all that and to the Lord and I'ma just be honest it's frustrating to me uh to have to and I know other churches do it all the time but I prayed a long time and Lord I just don't want to be in a situate just give us a place we ain't got the breakdown to set up and and God has always honored that prayer and it seemed like it's I just feel like it's the devil right and uh so so uh but it it's you know it's just it's one of those things and I even took off this week I said I got to find us another place I got to find us something you know but then the Lord was kind of telling me say um you got to stay with your confession amen you believing for the church in school just stay right there with your confession just be patient just wait wait I got this thing under control you just I I I I I I went to listen uh to a old sermon um I think it was the title of the sermon was the sixth sense went to work The Sixth Sense went the word and God was rebuking me with my own servant I sat there I say Lord yes Lord yeah but the Sixth Sense meant the word and and there the Lord just saying how we don't we don't put the Sixth Sense out of work he he he got uh put off his job he he not he's not able to even work anymore but God give a situation so the Sixth Sense can go to work and that's a sense of Faith right amen believe God for the impossible so we in one of them situations where our sixth sense is at work amen so I had to take my medicine I said Lord I'm sorry forgive me help me to only believe amen I only believe and and I'm thanking God for for for what he's already done amen well I I I'm gonna read a scripture today and and I'm going to uh um um uh give you the title of this sermon um we're going to preach today on there is power in our Praises amen there is power in our Praises amen and if you would just stand with me I want to read from acts 16 um verse 6 through 9. and as I read the scripture you're going to be like where is brother Jack getting this title from these verses don't worry just hang with me amen it'll all come together amen Oh Glory to God all right here in Acts 16 Verse 6 it says now when they had gone throughout phrygia uh and the region of galatia and we're forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia after they were come to Meijer they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not and as we're reading this I want you to uh be sensitive to the spirit of God we have to learn to be sensitive to the spirit of God sometimes God will forbid us to do certain things amen we might try something else and God will say no don't do that right and we have to learn to be sensitive to the spirit of God all right and here uh verse verse 9 says and a vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them therefore loosing from trois we came with a straight course to some samatra Shia and the next day to neapolis amen let's pray over the word of God father we uh thank you for this opportunity to read the scripture but Lord we know it takes the Holy Ghost to make known what it is that we have read and God we also know takes the Holy Ghost to Quicken it and make it alive for the the day and time in which we live the Lord let your word be quickened and as we come farther into the house of God gathered here to hear from you speak we take every Spirit that's against the spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost and God may you get all the glory all the honor and all the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated amen um again our title for uh today is there is power in our Praises amen there is power in our Praises um I uh the know the scripture tells us in Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication Hallelujah with Thanksgiving amen let your requests be made known unto God and uh here so there's one thing to pray about something uh but it's another thing to add Thanksgiving with your prayer praise God and what the scripture is really telling us is that Thanksgiving actually occurs before the answer before the manifestation amen you need to exercise Thanksgiving that God has already heard your prayer oh hallelujah hallelujah amen so so we we uh we we want to operate like this and this is why I said when I read that little uh uh a devotion for for tomorrow amen that I'm already thanking God that the the uh uh I said it's gonna be a greater blessing to be an owner than to be a renter amen and I'm already expecting God gonna make us owners we've been renters for a long time but God is going to make us owners and what I'm doing is not just praying over that I'm thanking God for becoming an owner A Hallelujah somebody I'm thanking God that he's already made a way hey I thank God for supplying the need that I have I I thank God in advance for what he amen for what he's going to do Oh Glory to God Amen there's power in our Praises amen I want to read a little statement here from uh this message this day this scripture is fulfilled uh here you know brother Brandon makes a statement here says the Pentecostal Pentecostal church is in a laodicea and condition it says oh they still jump and holler and carry on when the music is beating my but when the music stops beating or the beatniks uh beatnik music some of them play and call it Christianity and whenever that stops all the glory is gone see I like this statement if it's a real praise Hallelujah somebody if it's a real praise of God amen there isn't enough whistles and enough power in the world to stop it I I I I'm I believe this I I believe our praise don't just stop when we come in here on Sunday morning or Wednesday night our praise will follow us home Oh Glory to some glory to God you know I've been in situations sometimes where you know you're going through this and your mind bombarded with this and bombarded with that and and you just I mean the devil just just just just just just rough shot I mean running rough shot in your life but all of a sudden God will inspire you with a song amen and and when you begin to praise God in the midst of that song all of a sudden your attitude changes your shift begins to focus Hallelujah you feel like you got power over the devil your praise has released an anointing come on somebody amen there is power in your praise and you ain't even said a word of prayer you ain't even bound the devil Amen in the name of Jesus but you just begin to worship and when it's a real sincere word set ain't nothing can stop it when you're not feeling good in your body you begin to praise hey when the bills are passed do you begin to praise because you know God is gonna make a way if he'd get It Before He'll Do It Again there is power in my praise glory to God it's got to be a real praise Hallelujah amen if it's a real praise of God there isn't enough whistles enough power in the world to stop it when it really comes from God it don't take music to be beat up I'm telling when it's a real praise that you already got the music on the inside of you you already got your own beat in the inside of you Hallelujah amen and don't take music to beat it up it takes the spirit of God to come down on it and that's what does it he said they long forgot it because they've classed the gift of the Holy Ghost initial evidence of speaking in tongues and I heard devils and witches speak in tongues says the Holy Ghost is the word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting that word outside of that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit and denies one word of the Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not Hallelujah so real praise would be anointed by the spirit it'll Quicken the word that's already in you and that that that there just begins to change situations and circumstances that you're going through I I um I was reminded of uh a couple times or once once a couple of instances where we just Just Praise change atmospheres and one time we were at Pinnacle palms and uh we were there just worshiping and you know and and we didn't even have music sometimes you know we would have it but as as the years uh developed a man uh musicians just wanted to go and not have to worry about playing that's fine amen but uh but we were saying in our in the melody and and you know just just just the worshiping song If it was create an atmosphere and I remember there was a lady walked up to the mailbox she didn't even know he was in there but you know usually they would use that room to play uh games and all kind of things like that but she walked up to the mailbox and outside the door she just hear amen the the the the singing of the songs and feel the presence of God should say I got to go in there and something pulled that lady from the outside hallelujah amen right into the inside it was the praise that created the atmosphere do you realize when we created an atmosphere and here with our Praises this is this is an opportunity for the shackles to be broken [Applause] you people coming here in shackles people come in here in bondage but when we get into when we begin to praise God I'm talking about a real Prince it's an opportunity for the shackles to be broken they don't have to leave here the same way they came praise can change any situation remember we were just at the old church and and and we here we down in a corner having a service and a lady was in in Dollar General and somehow she heard it all the way down in Dollar General and just hearing the worship because of to come and open up the door and she sat down inside the presence of the Lord and just really got a got got what she needed from God Amen praise this changes people's atmospheres oh Hallelujah glory to God hear this message show us the father and it will satisfy us brother Brandon makes a statement here Glory Hallelujah says right if it can ever settle in your heart you in the wheelchair amen you in the cots you out there with heart trouble cancer you and radio land in hospitals wherever you are wherever you may be if you can receive God's word in your heart and water it with praises he first received God's word in your heart and then water it with praises and thanks to God for giving it to you oh Hallelujah hey I got a promise of my healing now I want to give him a thank you Jesus we got a promise for the church now I want to give him a thank you Jesus thank you for touching my body a thank you for touching my children thank you God for the new church thank you for the new school hey thank you thank you thank you thank you for the new house thank you for the new car thank you for the new job thank you Jesus thank you for every need being met hey Hallelujah thank you for touching me thank you for keeping me thank you for making a way out of no way thank you for opening up doors I cannot see thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory to God hey I thank you for yesterday I thank you for today thank you for what you're gonna do on tomorrow thank you for saving me Hallelujah [Music] Glory Glory I'm awarded every promise with my praise my praise is what's gonna make it come to pass Glory [Applause] thank you for filling with the Holy Ghost thank you for delivering thank you o God for setting free [Applause] thank you for restoring my children thank you Jesus Glory Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah my God he says if you can receive God's word in your heart and Ward it with praises and thanks to God for giving it to you it'll grow into a tree or whatever the seed represents healing salvation whatever is for that tree will blossom through your praises but you've got to drink you got to water it feed it let it grow amen and the more you trust in God if you're in a wheelchair and in the hospital and you're so paralyzed you can't even move but one finger just keep moving that one finger to the glory of God Hallelujah tomorrow you'll move your hand the next day you'll move your arm praise God and you'll be moving on pretty soon if you'll just keep watering it pushing out growing getting bigger and bigger take God's word it's a seed certainly it's a seed look at this says God gave Abraham a promise as we've been studying Abraham let that seed get into his heart the promise and kept wording it with praises and Thanksgiving to God for the child and waited 25 years but the tree came forth just the same because he watered it with faith I like that let's just uh catch this over here in Romans 4 when he makes a statement about Abraham Romans 4 17 is where this is being a a pull from and and I like this you know no longer how no matter how long we have to wait we just keep watering it and you know just uh I was thinking uh I believe I saw sister Naomi uh post something there on social media about uh uh every eight years there's a new beginning and I believe that they were uh they got the house there in um in Palm Bay Area eight years ago and how uh how perfect God is that in the eighth month of the eighth year that they would get a closing because it's time for a new beginning that's the God we serve but while we waiting we got to learn the praise and this is a rebuke to me because I'm not looking for other things that we got that we got to find something this is not our home I feel like we got to get out of here soon amen and I'm I'm ready for God to open up that next channel that church and that school because the glory of owning gonna be greater than renting we don't want to rent again we want our own Lord hey I'm I'm under the 40-day prophecy I'm on to the 40-day prophecy and I've been watching God do things here amen and in this 40 days and uh uh there's a number of saints got blessed with cars right amen how's this being a soul glory to God uh uh brother and and sister Robles uh just about seven years almost seven years had the opportunity to return back here all this happened and they have been waiting a long time to get that house so and God sent a doctor amen that not just by the house but I'ma buy you a car and it forced them to have to buy a new car God know how to do things these are some of the blessings that we're seeing in these 40 days I was telling some of the Saints a few weeks ago I was I was uh I came to we got here started late on a Wednesday night well what was going on um you know brother brother Smiley was texting me he's like brother Jack you know uh uh you all right and he was online I'm like yeah I'm all right brother I'll be right there I've got I'm running five minutes late right before I came to church um God had somebody call me about some work that they needed done and I was leaving town on um on Thursday morning so they needed someone to start a 24-hour shift for nine days for uh starting Thursday morning here it is six o'clock and I'm getting ready for church I'm like I gotta get somebody to work gotta get somebody to work and and and here we are uh uh putting out messages and getting all this and I and I I start running late but the Lord the Lord provided we were able to secure the client right after I got out of work I got out of church work got out of church uh I went back to work and uh and I had the caregivers already lined up ready to start at seven o'clock the next morning it was a ten thousand dollar deal and as I was sharing it with my mama she said she said oh yeah something Supernatural in 40 days yeah because that don't happen all the time and I did I begin to think say now if God you're doing these things on the natural these are what we call blessings in the in the nether Springs oh yes we see all the blessings in the nether Springs new house new car new this do that those are blessings in the up never speaks but brother in in the Book of Joshua the actual blessings in the upper Springs and in the nether Springs so I'm looking for God to fill with the Holy Ghost thank you for feeling with the Holy Ghost thank you for refilling with the Holy Ghost thank you for every healing thank you for every Deliverance thank you Jesus we're looking for the blessings in the upper Springs he's a God that can do both thank you for the new church and for the school glory to God I just began to think on all these things that the Lord's been doing and say you know we and we don't want to miss this God is moving in this season and I just want to be involved with everything God's doing I'm in on this 40 days I think we got to go to September 3rd expect anything expect anything before September 3rd Hallelujah glory to God let me read this amen this he said this uh God gave Abraham a promise and Abraham let that sea uh get into his heart and kept watering with praises and Thanksgiving to God for the child and waited 25 years but the tree came forth just the same because he wore it with faith and this is out of Romans 4 17 as it is written I have made thee father of many nations and this man had no children but I've made thee God is already looking at what he's already made you don't look at what you are what you got right now hey look at what God has already done for you as a reason I have made your father many nations before him who hath uh whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not a glory to God as though they were look who against hope uh I Feel Jesus it's against hope oh my God hey oh God I'm so glad that we got testimonies already in our midst amen you know and God God um when I told y'all a few weeks ago that people say well somebody else already put a cash offer in and and and I say well so they said that I just thought about sister Nelly and brother Calvin I said they had the same situation and God manifested himself I said God you got to do it for us and I said even when you're against hope look at what Abraham did and to see to Abraham does the same thing we they say who would give so believed in Hope all right that he might become the father of many nations look at this according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be all right and being not weak in faith he consented not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb now this this this is uh again a very challenging statement if you read your Bible and you read the story of Abraham you can see this man was very weak in faith and what I would consider Faith this man was giving up his wife twice and you're gonna and but this this is what I like about it hey Hallelujah you can't look at yourself the way you see yourself [Music] you have to look at yourself the way God sees you and what God wrote about Abraham is that he was not weak in faith he consider not his own body amen now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not the man gave his wife up twice but God said about Abraham he staggered not A Hallelujah at the promises of God through unbelief and was but was strong and faith-giving glory to God and this is the part that I think we need to catch in in in in our faith now let's just add to our faith some praises that's it it's a matter of reasons some thank you Jesus amen amen thanking them for what's already been done every promise he made is yeah and amen not one gonna fail amen y'all get ready get ready I'm giving y'all a new address soon I'm gonna give you a new address soon don't miss it I'ma update the Church website with a new address soon yeah Hallelujah [Applause] and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform now I might not be able to get it done but God can the Earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof the world and they that's weather in glory to God and therefore was imputed to him for righteousness so here we see how Abraham responded in the midst of him waiting praise God the Bible says stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to God he was praising God Amen as he was making preparation he was praising God that's the way we want to be I was just moved by this uh this word praise it just really just just just begin to stand out to me and I went to my some Bible software I got called aluminum and I just put in it got different definitions for the word praise and and they uh they said praise is giving thanks to God for who he is oh my praise is giving thanks to God for who he is and I love this it says praise is saying thank you for each aspect of his divine nature our inward attitude becomes an outward expression when we praise God we help ourself by expanding our awareness of who he is right I mean so so I like like sometimes you can start praising them for what he's done for you in the past God you touched me before and I know that you're the same yesterday today and forever if you hear me before then I know you can hear me again and here's another thing it's not only I know you can I I need to change my vocabulary not that I know you can heal me again I know you will heal me again Lord help me change my vocabulary no if you did it before you will do it again because you can't fail glory to God Amen it's helped expand our awareness of who he is my God my God they said in each Psalm you read look for an attribute or characteristic of God for which you can thank him so when you start reading through the book of Psalms and we're gonna we're gonna pull some scriptures in a second out of the book of Psalms hallelujah amen we begin to thank him for who he is amen another thing you know I just I just kind of uh uh uh I I I put this amen this next little statement that they said praise is a spiritual offering praise what is praise praise is a spiritual offering oh and I just love this amen I love this there was a scripture that came uh to me uh while I was just looking at this in this Psalm 34 verse 1 through 3. amen it says uh oh magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together hallelujah amen uh and and what's the uh uh start at verse one I'm sorry go back to verse one on that uh I will bless the Lord at all times look at that his praise shall continually be in my mouth when I ain't feeling good his praise gonna be in my mouth when I am feeling good his praise still gonna be in my mouth it don't matter what I'm going through his praise gonna be in my mouth amen uh the next verse says uh glory to God it says my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble share hear theof and be glad and here in verse 3 says o magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together now I I thought about that because uh the the little uh story of the Belgian horses came back to me and they talked about the Belgian horses how these are really big strong animals and they they use them to pull concrete especially in in in in in the War uh one of the wars they would use them to build the the walls and things like that they were they were pulling concrete and I said one horse could pull up to 8 000 pounds by himself amen strong horse and then they would try to put two horses together he says now when two horses were working together as a team glory to God you would think that these two horses working together as a team would pull 16 000 pounds but when they're working together as a team they do three times their strength amen they pulled twenty four thousand pounds glory to God it keeps magnifying as another horse is at it amen and this is what this is what I'm saying I can praise them by myself but when I can get you to join with me when we could come here together we'll put more demos on the Run than we thought just through our praise pray sometimes there's a spiritual offering it's not easy always to praise God I think about job and it wasn't easy for job to praise God there he was you know they told him about his oxen and his donkeys his sheep his camels and eventually his children had a storm came and destroyed of a house where his children were living and even took his children amen job I love his response because it's something that I believe all of us amen ought to learn how to do we ought to get get get get get strength from what job did job in Job 1 verse 20 and up through 22 it says then jobber Rose after he got all the bad news rent his mantle saved his head fell down upon the ground and the Bible says this and worshiped in the midst of everything he was going through he began to worship he began to praise God and he said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return this look at this in verse 22. it's I'm in verse verse 21 the lord gave and the Lord have taken away blessed be the name of the Lord that was his praise no matter what I'm going through amen I'm still going to worship God I'm a praise God here this other statement that they made in Illumina said praise is focusing our heart on God praise is focusing our heart on God now now they they uh they took an example from the last five Psalms Psalm 4 146 147 148 149 and 150. and I want to just take a few scriptures you know out of that here's uh here's some of the statements that they made said praise um uh the last five Psalms of filled with praise each begins and ends with praise the Lord so maybe we should try to do some of that start the day with a praise the Lord end the day with another praise the Lord wake up in the morning with another praise the Lord just because I got out my pants praise the Lord I got strength in my feet praise the Lord I can still lift my hands praise the Lord I got a voice that I can raise praise the Lord I got a car that I can get into praise the Lord I got a house I got a roof over my head praise the Lord my bills are paid come on somebody we got so much to praise God for [Music] start with a praise the Lord end with a praise the Lord so they show us where why and how to praise God these Psalms show us where why and how to praise God what what does praise do the question it says praise takes our minds of our problems and shortcomings and focuses them on God praise leads us from Individual meditation to corporate worship see I mean just when I just begin oh the song say when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he's done for me my soul Cries Out Hallelujah and I'ma tell you when I begin to praise it gets contagious next thing you know you begin to praise and we end up in corporate worship and we driving Devils out with our praise another thing they say praise causes us to consider and appreciate God's character and I love this praise lifts our perspective from the Earthly to the heavenly let's read a couple of these uh verses here out of out of Psalms 146 147 148 149. amen I I was trying to cut some of it down but someone I got to read all of it because it's just it's just that good all right hallelujah hallelujah amen here in Psalms 146 just a couple verses um uh David says praise ye the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul amen that not just on your flesh but your soul right says while I live will I praise the Lord while I sit I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being I'm gonna stop there because that just just this week a precious brother sent out a text and um while I'm thinking about that if I forget to do this there was another sister they've been asking prayer for she just had a baby up there in Virginia and uh after the baby um had some major complications and they were talking about taking her life and all of that they just didn't know what to do but right now I think she is breathing again on her own but they still have some uh they have a ways to go yep you know what let's let's let me stop and pray amen father we come before your presence for sister Solis uh they they requested prayer and God we want to thank you for touching our sister oh God we know that you are the Healer amen and even as I was reading a little early brother Branham said that even if they have to set this and set that or whatever you still the one that heals and God we're asking that you would just intervene we've seen your hand thus far God this mother new new mother Lord want to be here to raise a child and a husband standing there by by her side I pray that you would touch it even right now we send your word because you said you sent your word to heal so we send your word to Virginia claiming that you were wounded for transgressions Bruce for her iniquities and chastisement of her peace is upon you with your stripes we declare healing so in between her and her condition we place the blood of the Lord Jesus amen and we pray in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen the glory to God Hallelujah one time I did that at a service I don't remember where it was but I was we were in a service and right in the middle of the sermon I stopped and I prayed for somebody like that that was away uh some other city and I stopped and pray that person reached out to me uh late uh a few months ago and said you know when you did that I won't let you know that my daughter's uh well now she's doing much better much better God God does these things last I got a testimony last week while I was there in um in Ohio I was there last last year and I preached and there was a young lady that had a really really bad condition like I don't even remember all the things that she had uh but uh but she uh very young lady and she came to me this time she said brother Jack I don't know if you remember me but uh last time you came and you prayed for me and now you know I stopped taking that medication and they could understand how did I get better after stop taking the medication but I'm I'm perfectly well and this is the results of my past that shows that I'm well God is answering prayer I'm trying to get somewhere I'm trying to get somewhere but I know God is moving while I was in Ohio this time praise God I got a call from a sister and I and I and I when I got the car said oh my I wonder what she needs and I told my wife I got to call this sister back you know because she needs something and uh so the sister called me and she says uh brother Jack um I just wanted to let you know I didn't get a chance to make it to the meetings you know that you all had they were brother brother Gwen and the Saints from uh London I didn't get a chance to make the meetings she says uh but um uh I was uh I was listening to the sermons and I was listening to the services and I was just really blessed just listening to them streaming them you know well actually she went back and and caught the the recordings so I was listening to him and and our brother Gwen and began to talk about a uh a sister that had been prayed for by a brother from Zimbabwe they called a brother from Zimbabwe and this sister had cancer and uh and and brother Gwen began to tell how to how the brother prayed and how God delivered that sister from cancer she said brother Jack the reason that struck me is because I went and I was uh told by the doctor that they seen something abnormal and and what happened is that they began to make all kind of arrangements for me to do this to do that and do and I had never even agreed to any of these things I told him and said she said I told him I respect what you do as a doctor I understand say but I am a Christian and I know God is able to heal so so just give me a little time just to kind of process this and as she was talking to say well you know and as as she was saying I remember Sister Tanya's testimony I began to share about sister times testimony and as I'm sharing that last weekend since it's Tanya's standing here sharing her testimony all right I mean so so I was just telling the sister and encourage us that we've seen God do it you know she wanted to wait till after she was prayed for before she would go on with anything the doctor I'd say our sister did the same thing my sister-in-law she did the same thing and God manifested himself I know he's the same yesterday that damn family I say so she said she'll say what I'm calling you for brother Jack is because I felt that maybe it just it just struck My Heart by four o'clock and once you said if I can just call Brother Jack maybe he can call the call brother gwinner and maybe he can get the number to the brother and and uh in in Africa and maybe that brother can pray for me she said I want to exhaust every one of my resources before before I let them touch me like that so so I you know I was going through the week going through the week and I and I got Brothers grim and he gave me the number and I got in touch with brother Mike and um and and and we were just you know trying to get everything worked out and I know he tried to call me like I think it was midnight I was I told y'all I sleep hard I was gone you know and I'm like oh Lord I missed the call so he we texted back and forth when can I call he went I said brother you can call me now well I guess I missed it I stay up tonight I'll be waiting on your call and I'm telling the sister sister just be I don't know when you're gonna call just be ready just say I'll be ready I'm just waiting patiently say okay well yesterday brother Knight brother Mike text me he says brother Jack are you available now I say yes I am brother and he uh he called me and uh and and when he called me I said okay brother I said this is the situation this is the condition say and we just want you to pray that's all we want you to do just pray and it says okay brother I'll gladly do that we got the sister on the phone I let it I let because he loves to try to build your faith before he prays for you he's going to tell you about some of the supernatural things God has done and that's his ministry the pastor acknowledges that God hears this man's prayer so anytime they have a hard case in the church the Pastor said I want y'all to see brother Mike we need gifts like that and brother Mike will sit there and just uh just uh just keep testimony after testimony trying to get their faith to level where he can pray for and my god when that brother prays the brother prayed with authority now just just listening to him share testimonies and getting the faith and and then it didn't begin to make some comments you know about you a Christian and as a Christian the devil have no right to attack your body like that you're a daughter of God the devil have no right and so he said he said so he says so there's cancer that's attacking her body I command you in the name of Jesus Take Your Filthy Hands off of her you are we we we we we we we rebuke you right now in the name of Jesus pack your bags and leave he was praying with such Authority like he knew who he was and he knew who she was sister just began to thank God and praise God and and and I'm not sharing the name intentionally because I want her to come and tell her testimony when the doctors say that it's no longer there we saw the doctor say it for sister Tanya so the doctors will say it for her and she would come and share her own testimony and I told brother Mike I say I'll be calling you back with the testimony brother Hallelujah hey I believe we serve a living God hey I'm not worried that you should come under my roof but if you would speak the word only I know my servant will be made well Lord Jesus Psalms 146 oh I didn't I I I missed this testimony verse verse 2 while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praise unto my God while I have any being early this week a brother put out a a little note says Brothers my my mother is leaving we know that she's leaving she's a a warrior in the faith and she's on her way out so just pray that I can get there to see her before she go so all the brothers began to pray and and says that uh when he got that to his mother the very last thing his mom was trying to do she was trying to sing a song what a defeat to the devil mama trying to give God praise through a song what a way to go what piece what piece that the last thing she I mean and the last thing I believe when I'm leaving this Earth You're Gonna Hear Me worshiping God through a song and that's what when I thought about the scripture while I live will I praise the Lord I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being amen skip to verse 10 in that same chapter says the Lord shall reign forever even thy God or Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord my God look at this uh Psalms 147. Jesus Jesus Jesus uh look at this in verse verse 1 says praise ye the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant and Praises calmly you know what Praises calmly mean it means Praise Is Beautiful they have a song that say praise looks good on you praise is calmly praise is beautiful right says uh the Lord doth build up Jerusalem he gathered together the outcasts of Israel he healeth the broken in heart now now wait a minute who who does the Gathering Together the Lord does it so you're looking for something to praise God for praise him for bringing your family in [Applause] because you that you gather the outcasts he healeth the broken in heart and binders up their wounds he telleth the number of the Stars my he called them all by their names if he know the Stars by name and they don't even need no Redemption I know he knows my child by name glory to God hey look at this David say great is our Lord and of great power his understanding is infinite he knows everything you're going through you can praise him for that Lord I praise you because you know exactly what I'm going through Glory Hallelujah look at this now amen all right it says uh uh uh verse verse 6 the Lord lifted up the meek he casted the wicked down to the ground amen sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving and that's why I was just loving that there was some song but I think we started out this morning with us thank you Lord sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving amen sing praise is upon the heart unto our God I'm just skipping you there's y'all can go back and read just let this be part of your meditation amen but verse 20 in the same chapter says he hath not dealt so with any nation and as for his judgments they have not known them praise ye the Lord so it starts with a praise it ends with a praise let's go to Psalm 148. look at this here David's starting again Praise You the Lord praise ye the Lord from the heavens Praise Him in the Heights my God praising him all

see uh because that no musicians was actually in place when I started singing and then all of a sudden somebody picked up on the organ so what I did when I you'll see on the video I turned to look back and say who in the world is playing that okay it was brother Kenny over there said Lord have mercy man and man and man and they just you know then the whole congregation just kind of got into it just began to enter into that little that little time of worship and and um and and the Lord just kind of inspired on the spot said maybe the reason we haven't seen victories in our life is because we're the ones still fighting foreign but the scriptures say The Battle Belongs to the Lord [Applause] so rather than fight praise [Applause] praise it's already done it's already worked out he already finished it he already won the battle Praise Him right but but I heard that brother playing an organ I'm like hey Lord now you told us according to your word to praise you amen with the instruments and organs we want to do that we want to fulfill your word [Applause] thank you for the church so we can fulfill your words and I was praise God uh I was out you know as we were going
