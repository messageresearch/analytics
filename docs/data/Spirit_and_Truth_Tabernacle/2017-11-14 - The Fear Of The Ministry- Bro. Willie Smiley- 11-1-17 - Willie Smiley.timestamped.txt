[8:32] glory of God and the firmament showeth
[8:35] his handiwork day unto day uttereth

[8:42] knowledge there is no speech or language
[8:45] where their voice is not heard there
[8:49] their line is gone out through all the
[8:51] earth and their words to end of the
[8:54] world and them has he set a tabernacle
[8:59] for the Sun which is a bridegroom coming
[9:04] out of his chamber and rejoices as a as

[23:53] to really sit down but we just ask that
[23:57] you just said a special anointing anoint
[23:59] me O God I just kind of just been going
[24:03] all day long but we hear the fellowship
[24:06] around the Word of God and we ask that

[24:14] let's get our Bibles out tonight it's
[24:17] good to be here tonight just remember
[24:21] brother jacking in prayer man you're
[24:29] gonna join himself over in Israel just
[24:37] grab a hold to his coat tear one of
[24:39] these days and I'm going along with him
[24:42] second Corinthians chapter 11 but just
[24:45] remember him and press just a whole lot
[24:49] going on in the world today and
[24:52] traveling abroad
[24:59] talking about a guest Jack have this
[25:01] idea about doing things go to tap or
[25:15] there go you know and their leader
[25:17] resting everybody who want to do it I
[25:19] feel the same way sometime but I still
[25:23] want it going look it overseas but I
[25:25] pick and choose you know I know
[25:30] missionary that straight right quick I'm
[25:35] not going back in the jungles and all of
[25:37] that you got to be built for that I'm to
[25:40] Americanize to culture but we appreciate
[25:45] him Lord just remember exact second
[25:49] Corinthians chapter 11 we want to start
[25:53] at the first few verses there now y'all
[25:57] just gonna have to bear with me
[25:59] it says would to God ye could bear with
[26:03] me a little and my father and indeed
[26:05] bear with me says for I'm jealous over
[26:08] you with godly jealousy before I have
[26:12] exposed you to one husband that I may
[26:16] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[26:20] but I feel this by any means as the
[26:24] serpent beguiled Eve through
[26:26] subtlety so your minds should be
[26:29] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[26:32] Christ for if he that cometh preaches
[26:36] another jesus when we have not preached
[26:39] or if you receive another spirit which
[26:44] ye have not received or another gospel
[26:46] which you have not accepted you might
[26:50] well bear with him I'm gonna stop right
[26:54] this it's a lot of reading you may be
[26:57] seated tonight we want to use as a
[27:03] little topic tonight the theater
[27:06] ministry as a little topic and as a
[27:10] maybe a subtopic the commission of the
[27:15] Father to present the right kind of
[27:18] woman now I've been I've been working
[27:23] with the book of second Corinthians for
[27:26] some months now and y'all pray fun
[27:31] because they can get lifted but I want
[27:36] to maybe for a few moments so that you
[27:39] can get the picture I think when it
[27:42] comes down to really understanding the
[27:47] Bible it really takes going back and
[27:51] really picking up the history and the
[27:55] whys I think my understanding has been
[28:00] revolutionized over the last few months
[28:03] this this entire year I've done
[28:06] something that I haven't done probably
[28:11] in all my years of preaching but I just
[28:14] felt inspired to maybe go back and just
[28:18] take a scriptural approach to help us to
[28:21] really understand the Bible and pull out
[28:25] different things to help us to see that
[28:27] this just we we know that and I'm a
[28:31] preacher on something tonight and this
[28:32] is I don't want to just necessarily look
[28:35] at it from a historical standpoint
[28:37] because one of the things I do believe
[28:39] that the Scriptures are irrelevant the
[28:43] things that were going on in the days of
[28:47] the Apostle Paul we can clearly see a
[28:50] lot of things transpiring now and I miss
[28:54] that right and one of the one of the
[28:56] things that we find in looking at the
[28:58] scripture maybe in the previous few
[29:01] chapters um one of the issues that Paul
[29:04] had was that were influences outside
[29:10] influence clergy related that were
[29:14] trying to influence the church about
[29:18] Paul's ministry and and a priest a
[29:24] priest a lot of stuff on this line and
[29:27] one of the things that I did preach was
[29:29] spiritual warfare leadership a lot of
[29:33] times I think people misunderstand
[29:38] leadership when it came down to Paul's
[29:43] Apostleship it was harshly harshly
[29:47] criticized and I made a statement to it
[29:51] to the church at home and I are kind of
[29:54] preached on these lies that brother Remy
[29:56] on Sunday I think you should not judge
[30:01] anything haphazardly I think sometimes
[30:08] we we judge things that we know very
[30:12] little of and about and especially
[30:16] especially when it comes down to to to
[30:19] ministry a lot of times we we judge
[30:24] ministers and week we judge pastors we
[30:27] we just the different offices real
[30:30] harshly but I think a lot of times the
[30:34] the approach is intellectual and not
[30:37] spiritual a lot of times you know I
[30:43] don't that try not to fight with folks
[30:45] over things but a lot of times
[30:47] and I realized that people are taking a
[30:51] intellectual approach and feelings and I
[30:57] feel and you know the Prophet preached
[31:00] the message for us not to lean to our
[31:02] own understanding but but I think a lot
[31:06] of times we link to our own
[31:09] understanding and we totally totally
[31:12] miss God we met you miss God when you
[31:16] lean to your own understanding and and
[31:19] one of the things they they were they
[31:24] had this thing where it were Paul at one
[31:27] point Paul they had an issue put it this
[31:32] way you know how he is
[31:34] you know how Foca they had issues with
[31:36] the past about all kinds of stuff
[31:40] issues with the ministry I don't like
[31:42] how he look I don't like I don't like he
[31:46] always got something going on but one of
[31:49] the issues were was the fact that Paul
[31:52] when Paul was with them Paul he operated
[31:58] a little what they thought was timid and
[32:02] and humble and things of that nature but
[32:06] then when when Paul wasn't with them it
[32:09] seems like his writings right his
[32:14] writings to the church was harsh
[32:17] was was worded strong and and one of the
[32:22] things I was telling my church you know
[32:24] I was saying that you you know people
[32:29] say well be direct be straightforward
[32:33] but then when you're directing you
[32:35] straightforward people can really handle
[32:37] it right I wanna priest weeping tonight
[32:41] right people say give it give it to me
[32:44] straight but then when you give it to
[32:47] them straight
[32:47] they've been out of shape huh
[32:52] see and when people people don't realize
[32:55] you know if you really look at Paul's
[32:59] ministry the thing that they were
[33:02] missing was the fact that Paul was being
[33:06] led by God right because you don't want
[33:12] anything I don't like all up in my faces
[33:15] right I you know all right you know you
[33:20] want people to have tact I've been I've
[33:23] been working this week with a guy
[33:27] started for Monday to the day where I
[33:29] almost quit every day old fella and and
[33:34] he just kind of been getting under my
[33:37] skin it's like whew why don't he know
[33:39] I'm 55 I mean just the way that he he'd
[33:44] been you know just talk to me talk to me
[33:46] and I hang on you know he this and and
[33:51] it's like and then I got a I got a
[33:54] Jamaican guy working then he he have to
[33:57] catch them is like oh Jesus I'm being
[34:00] tried I'm being tried you know it's like
[34:05] man but you know it just really shows
[34:09] you something the church should have
[34:13] really been able to appreciate Paul's
[34:16] approach because what Paul's concerned
[34:20] mostly was about them realistically
[34:28] pause entire ministry if we look at
[34:32] Redemption was really trying to get them
[34:35] in a place in a position to line them up
[34:39] right i'ma say this and I pray be they
[34:44] don't really hurt your feelings I've
[34:47] really come to a place after 20-some
[34:49] years and sometimes we take it for
[34:51] granted we think because people have
[34:54] been in the church 20 or 30 years they
[34:58] understand they do not and sometimes we
[35:03] might think because people have been in
[35:06] been in the church and around the you
[35:08] know the message of the hour that their
[35:11] spiritual and their mature if they're
[35:13] not I'm realizing that more and more as
[35:18] we we get closer to the rapture right
[35:24] the the light is shining and explosive
[35:27] things that you realize wait a minute
[35:28] wait a minute wait a minute
[35:31] the seem like we're going backwards
[35:33] instead of all right
[35:36] but Paul they date harshly justice
[35:40] ministry with no real you shouldn't
[35:44] judge anything unless you fully
[35:48] understand it - its - if that's a word
[35:52] with Rebecca and I had to watch that
[35:57] stuff with Rebecca Uncle Willie what was
[36:00] that word y'all ought to know I ain't
[36:05] graduated from high school so it felt
[36:08] good coming now then I said the smallest
[36:13] detail but but watch this if you're
[36:18] looking at something from the mind of
[36:20] God you'll get yourself to a place where
[36:24] we won't judge it unless we're judging
[36:28] it on the world we judge a lot of things
[36:31] in the flesh right I'll tell you I'm
[36:36] human I look at things sometimes and and
[36:40] you know we we get so caught up in the
[36:42] flesh and God it's like wait a minute
[36:44] what you're doing you're supposed to be
[36:48] able to adopt this son you're supposed
[36:50] to be a mature son you're supposed to be
[36:52] writing the checks right but but look at
[36:59] your approach look at how you comment
[37:01] and what you comment now gonna have to
[37:06] get on brother Jack he invited me but
[37:10] I'm not saying this I'm not I'm not here
[37:12] to beat beat me
[37:13] harsh anything that's just where I am
[37:15] I'm preach this full five time right
[37:21] if you can't with just things we'll see
[37:25] they were judging Paul because of
[37:27] outside influences right be careful in
[37:35] this hour who's feeding you be careful
[37:43] of whose table that you eaten from right
[37:49] come on because because the devil still
[37:54] the devil right and people might be
[37:57] alright but people might be anointed
[38:00] right just took just so see right but
[38:05] let me Clemmy move on how much time I
[38:08] got at least 45 minutes Paul says here I
[38:13] work to God that you would bear with me
[38:16] a little in my folly and indeed bear
[38:19] with me and and and in so many words and
[38:23] studying the the commentaries on the
[38:27] scriptures and everything that I could
[38:28] find it's right be patient in so many
[38:33] words he said you know I hate to even
[38:35] and you'll get into the twelfth chapter
[38:37] a little bit in some instances he's
[38:40] sarcastic like it's sad that I have to
[38:44] be here trying to explain to the people
[38:49] that I brought to the message of the
[38:51] hour my my ability look if you really
[39:00] start to look at the the Corinthians
[39:03] right he said power all apostle of Jesus
[39:05] Christ
[39:06] call the things that like that's just
[39:08] not writings this is this is a man in
[39:13] the defense of his calling and then one
[39:18] thing about it I learn
[39:20] mr. state me say you cannot be what
[39:22] you're not hmm
[39:25] you know no matter from the outside
[39:28] looking in no matter how much you might
[39:31] look at brother Jack and say well well
[39:33] you know what uh I can faster if God has
[39:40] an ordained for you from the foundation
[39:43] of the world to be a pastor you'll never
[39:46] be able to accomplish it you won't be
[39:48] able to do it you accept that you won't
[39:51] be able to do it properly
[39:54] I'm Jason it's difficult to manage
[39:59] people huh I'm gonna say that again
[40:03] it's difficult to manage people but
[40:10] because you know we got a different
[40:13] upbringing as our different thought
[40:14] patterns are we're all different and and
[40:19] then you you have one one objective in
[40:22] one goal and you're looking at the
[40:26] people and the people looking at you and
[40:27] the people look at you so he picking on
[40:30] me
[40:30] then he go again why he'd have to say
[40:36] that why he had to say it like that
[40:41] right and he's looking like Lord I need
[40:45] just I need inspiration
[40:47] I need your leadership one thing I could
[40:50] say over 20-some years 20 years now of
[40:53] working with a group of people
[40:55] I'm totally trusted in the leadership of
[40:58] the Holy Spirit
[40:59] right I'm not perfect God is the word is
[41:04] and my whole objective has been to point
[41:09] the people to the Word of God see
[41:12] let me bring us 2017 a lot of people
[41:16] look at the promise ministry and grossly
[41:20] misunderstanding right not not realizing
[41:25] what his ministry just like Paul what's
[41:29] the point to people back to the Bible
[41:32] back to God right because like the
[41:36] Corinthians the Corinthians had drifted
[41:38] right God sins Malachi form the scene
[41:44] because the people had drifted right the
[41:48] people the people no longer resembled
[41:52] the APUs time trying to I said the
[41:55] original life we're gonna strike it
[41:57] tonight huh
[41:59] see the doctor God was working in the
[42:03] star masterpiece see wait wait I don't
[42:09] know about folk I don't know about folk
[42:11] anymore but but I believe that we needed
[42:15] Malachi 4 if that we're realistic and
[42:21] we're not in the flesh and in God is
[42:25] giving a spiritual insight you could
[42:29] look at you this has nothing to do with
[42:32] people cuz we get caught up on people
[42:35] there's good people might make a
[42:37] statement I'm gonna make a real strong
[42:39] statement here big because I know that
[42:43] people do not understand we just talk
[42:46] people don't realize good people died in
[42:49] the days of Noah y'all gonna come talk
[42:52] with me see I hear people talking I just
[42:56] get y'all get you're missing the entire
[42:59] picture you're missing God we know God
[43:03] God is long-suffering in because he is
[43:06] in this age but what we better realize
[43:09] you look at dated and quarter when they
[43:11] got away from the word when they got out
[43:15] of source and they started coming
[43:16] against God serving up what God did open
[43:20] up the earth and swallowed up people see
[43:24] weekly sometimes we think the God is and
[43:26] he is this great loving God but God is a
[43:29] God of judgment you right look at look
[43:33] at the days of life right look at the
[43:37] days of life when the two angels went
[43:39] down the side and that's hold like to
[43:42] come hither because we can't do that to
[43:45] you
[43:46] come on Oh blacks wedlock they had to
[43:50] drag that drag you out I and his wife
[43:55] got to looking back turned into a pillar
[43:58] of salt right look look what happened it
[44:04] would good folk right and in in the
[44:10] midst in the midst of in the midst of a
[44:13] bunch of bad folk that was some good
[44:16] folks but some of those good folks when
[44:21] it came down to the light of the day
[44:22] they missed it
[44:25] days of days of Noah everybody ain't bad
[44:29] but that sometimes that's our concept
[44:33] they go to church and they good people
[44:39] don't doubt it don't doubt it but see
[44:45] God has called us to positionally place
[44:47] us amen in the body right amen
[44:54] not saying that you know everybody in
[44:56] denomination is only way to hell right
[45:01] cuz when it comes down to eternal life
[45:03] and and and rapture things of that
[45:07] nature that's all been predetermined by
[45:09] God before we haven't even got here
[45:12] right see you just got to know where you
[45:17] stand your your place in scripture see
[45:25] but sometimes folks try to worry about
[45:28] other folks place in scripture and don't
[45:31] even know what their own place in
[45:33] scripture right see the hardest thing
[45:38] the hardest thing outline even at home a
[45:41] lot of times is you know they they get
[45:43] me brother Smalley you know that get
[45:45] people because you know we got good
[45:47] friends and all that
[45:49] hey listen I'm not gonna put the people
[45:51] in Hell right but
[45:55] in every age they had to hear from the
[46:00] spirit of that day right he that has an
[46:04] ear let him hear what everybody's not
[46:10] gonna everybody's not going in the
[46:12] rapture everybody's not in the body but
[46:15] everybody is not in the body they start
[46:18] going to the rocks ain't going the hell
[46:19] let me move on
[46:21] somebody say move on brothers yeah you
[46:24] gotta take a text so net right look what
[46:29] Paul was like let me move from there now
[46:33] watch he says I remember our
[46:36] texting like the fear of the ministry
[46:40] right and the Commission of the of the
[46:45] Father to present the right kind of
[46:47] woman right now not here he says for I
[46:52] am jealous over you now this jealousy
[46:58] that he's speaking of is it's not carnal
[47:02] jealousy right - see that's an effect of
[47:16] human jealousy in its negative right
[47:23] humanistic and pilots not dealing with
[47:25] anything calm anything natural but it's
[47:28] all spiritual right but you human
[47:35] negativity is is negative the results of
[47:38] it is all negative but but godly
[47:42] jealousy watch this is is a concern for
[47:47] holiness integrity purity of ethics and
[47:53] the whole of the Christian standards
[47:57] right and that's the thing that
[48:01] sometimes laypeople miss
[48:05] right relevant jack just I tell you what
[48:09] he did we just can do nothing but you
[48:16] got to understand godly jealousy right
[48:21] golly jealousy the concern for holiness
[48:26] see cuz without you will see the Lord
[48:30] integrity purity of ethics which this
[48:35] world has done right in the whole of
[48:39] Christian standards
[48:41] see if that wasn't a man that that stood
[48:48] for something could you imagine the
[48:50] condition of spirit and truth and Bible
[48:52] true tabernacle the we could look back
[48:59] in some of the oldest a system arose and
[49:03] some of them system Brown them that kind
[49:05] of group came up you know looking at I
[49:09] could mother burns Church foot for
[49:11] instance many further living when he was
[49:13] a little boy right Pentecost um but that
[49:17] was a time where it was just pure
[49:20] holiness integrity and everything else
[49:24] but but look what happened when the
[49:27] standard was was dropped but when one
[49:32] person one person came through the trust
[49:36] with Larry King huh one person came
[49:42] through the church when Larry Cain
[49:45] probably was a prominent person in the
[49:48] church huh and look what happened over
[49:55] time
[49:58] see and God trying to move a church you
[50:04] know into the head but then somebody
[50:07] anointed that comes in with Mary Kay and
[50:14] in a ministry I'm telling you it's hard
[50:17] to manage people huh me because
[50:25] something uses this time well you know
[50:31] I'm telling you something no matter
[50:34] whether it's your children whether it's
[50:38] your spouse it's hard to manage people
[50:43] it's hard to keep a a word standard
[50:48] because there's so many impulses it was
[50:51] influences in the days of power right
[50:54] it was influences I wish I could get to
[50:58] it tonight it was it was seducing clergy
[51:03] spirits in the days of Paul that were it
[51:07] through us in the church and sometimes
[51:12] and sometimes you know they call to it
[51:16] sometimes they parking lot and sometimes
[51:20] they work out women preacher hat song
[51:21] but you know it's all the same
[51:24] especially in the days that we're living
[51:26] in about to say move on brother smother
[51:33] now I've got a lot now my mom I got a
[51:36] whole lot here I'm loaded now this
[51:40] tablet fool hmm but so so that what what
[51:48] is Paul trying to do powerless trying to
[51:52] get them to see his position and what
[51:55] his concern is and what he's actually
[51:57] trying to do that's the hardest thing to
[52:00] get people to see we we have an
[52:05] objective we have something that we are
[52:09] looking at based upon the word of
[52:11] God and sometimes you got to be patient
[52:15] because people people sometimes just
[52:17] don't see it and I learned that hey you
[52:20] know I change that I try that doctor
[52:22] yeah I have to really be patient right
[52:25] because you don't want to damage the
[52:27] people sometimes people get spiritual
[52:30] amnesia it's just a whole lot that goes
[52:32] along with it right and you want to be
[52:36] long-suffering with people because
[52:37] sometimes God is long-suffering with you
[52:40] see I'll tell you man I can't flip the
[52:44] script because I know that God is
[52:45] long-suffering with me now I'ma preach
[52:48] with me
[52:51] see you see how sometime we was short
[52:56] with sharp at the preacher we shot with
[52:58] our children with you with this short
[53:02] and I realized and what if God was just
[53:05] short
[53:05] somebody said move on brother smiley huh
[53:13] we've got to have we've got to have have
[53:17] patience right but he said I'm jealous
[53:20] over you with Garland Jeff jealousy for
[53:22] once he says for I have espoused you to
[53:27] one husband right what hit you cannot
[53:33] serve God and Mammon at the same time
[53:35] right yeah you know what church we went
[53:40] we're right ever we're right at a place
[53:42] where you gotta make a choice right
[53:46] everybody's given a choice we choose the
[53:49] church and the children of a ride he

[54:16] provide it with you know that would seem
[54:21] like well don't look like God's doing

[59:16] and from that point I can work with them
[59:19] to bring them to a place of perfection
[59:20] other than other than no matter how much
[59:24] emotions you know we don't we don't did
[59:26] the emotional thing but for 20 years
[59:28] right and I I'm not against emotions up
[59:32] that's wonderful but I realized if you
[59:36] scripturally look at the damn penny
[59:39] crops right Peter preached and the other
[59:44] brothers stood up and Amen the word the
[59:48] the per it was the preaching of the
[59:50] gospel come on
[59:52] it was the preaching of the gospel that
[59:56] prick the heart of the people huh and
[59:59] they said you know meaning brother what
[1:00:03] must we be saying they was willing to
[1:00:05] make a choice they heard something that
[1:00:08] they identify with that they have greet
[1:00:12] with men and brethren what must we do to
[1:00:15] a man be sane right
[1:00:18] come on that has not changed it still
[1:00:22] takes the preaching of the gospel
[1:00:25] how can you hear less a preacher preach
[1:00:28] he got to be sin see how this other
[1:00:32] stuff is nonsense you got it because
[1:00:35] because if we don't approach it this way
[1:00:38] then what
[1:00:39] we saying is that we're smarter than God
[1:00:42] come on come on come on
[1:00:47] when God set the standard when there was
[1:00:50] nobody but for God to communicate with
[1:00:54] God set the standard it's God's program
[1:00:57] God's plan God's a you if you follow it
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] you you know it's almost like following
[1:01:03] a yellow brick road you get back to
[1:01:07] Kansas you'll find your way back but
[1:01:15] what if you deviate from the plan of
[1:01:17] God's plan see it can't be you're
[1:01:22] planning your thoughts and all of this
[1:01:24] stuff and your pillow well if we will do
[1:01:29] it it will not work it really won't work
[1:01:33] if I implement anything outside of a
[1:01:37] goddess implement it will not work right
[1:01:43] God will have to reject him cuz I say
[1:01:45] what smiley you were smarter than me
[1:01:47] your plan was was a hole it don't work
[1:01:49] right there if if from from point eight
[1:01:54] from the bad Pentecost when they came
[1:01:57] out they preach souls were printed came
[1:02:01] in and really receive something right
[1:02:06] see a lot of time people be screaming
[1:02:08] and hollering and rolling around down
[1:02:10] then when they get a copy me I did I
[1:02:16] mean my first experiences it you know
[1:02:20] before I came to Florida I had some
[1:02:23] experiences know I was in Florida it's
[1:02:27] right I was a foot well I had different
[1:02:29] places but I was in Florida I remember
[1:02:31] what they had me in pretty this is
[1:02:36] come on baby come on come on come on
[1:02:39] come on him
[1:02:40] geez I'm a slob cause y'all telling me
[1:02:42] to sky but when I got up I went straight
[1:02:44] back to the corner and got a deal that's
[1:02:52] right but I came to a point where I made
[1:02:56] a decision right I say Lord you know
[1:03:01] what you'll do something for me today
[1:03:03] I don't like John Ranas I'm one of them
[1:03:06] guy whoever that was you saying you
[1:03:10] don't do stuff for me right there you go
[1:03:11] come back you'll find my balls in the
[1:03:13] field you see people just saying
[1:03:16] desperate enough cuz cuz when you hit
[1:03:20] desperate desperation moves God move God
[1:03:24] on the scene but I can't people be
[1:03:26] playing see they think they come to
[1:03:30] church thing and that's why they stopped
[1:03:31] coming because they come in and the word
[1:03:34] they become condemned they be condemned
[1:03:40] right beat me because they they know
[1:03:43] better so they say when we went with we
[1:03:47] right but the problem is the image I'm
[1:03:51] gonna keep moving how much time I got
[1:03:55] Troy I got about 30 more minutes
[1:03:57] what's how about that close don't tell
[1:04:02] me that tonight now I'm not home so I
[1:04:05] feel a little freedom on Sunday I had an
[1:04:12] interpreter that I ain't got no
[1:04:14] interpreter sir well but he says why I'm
[1:04:20] jealous over you I have exposed you to
[1:04:23] one husband that I made now let me let
[1:04:28] me read this and then we come in I may
[1:04:30] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[1:04:33] right Wow what what inspiration see you
[1:04:42] said what I was trying to do Paul is
[1:04:44] trying to really get them to see and
[1:04:47] understand what
[1:04:50] his ministry entails what he's actually
[1:04:53] doing right
[1:04:55] something that parle is looking back to
[1:04:58] I was I was telling the church and then
[1:05:02] I was thinking about the scripture there
[1:05:03] in in Genesis just dealing with a
[1:05:08] version and and I was telling them you
[1:05:11] look at Eloisa right see you you can't
[1:05:18] break you cannot break the theme of the
[1:05:22] Bible when you go back to go back let
[1:05:27] that watch Redemption Redemption takes
[1:05:29] us all the way back to the beginning
[1:05:31] right and what we find if we go back to
[1:05:36] the G to Genesis the first first church
[1:05:38] right what God gave his son was a
[1:05:43] version right she played the part of a
[1:05:49] harlot but what but what God presented
[1:05:54] to Adam was pill was perfection right
[1:06:00] that's what God presented that thing
[1:06:03] can't change that thing can change I'm
[1:06:06] getting this up in a second that thing
[1:06:09] cannot change Paul Paul white Paul
[1:06:12] Paul's looking back to Genesis right
[1:06:16] then he picks up he picks up Eloisa
[1:06:20] right could you see the responsive bit
[1:06:25] I don't realize this and people want to
[1:06:27] be preachers you want to be discipline
[1:06:29] you don't really realize the
[1:06:31] responsibility that goes along with me
[1:06:35] that's a real serious responsibility
[1:06:37] you've gotta have to give up our real
[1:06:41] true ministry ain't about being popular
[1:06:43] because a lot of times you aren't
[1:06:45] popular right it went with Abraham
[1:06:50] called Eloisa
[1:06:51] and told him to go get a bride for his
[1:06:56] son Isaac could you imagine the pressure
[1:07:00] go back and redo the press
[1:07:03] sure the elegies was up under like whoa
[1:07:07] this is a big task this is a big task
[1:07:12] it's like because I can't bring I cannot
[1:07:16] present right what will be I cannot
[1:07:20] present to my master son anything
[1:07:25] outside of a version outside of what is
[1:07:33] pill outside of what is hopeful huh
[1:07:40] because it deals with character right
[1:07:44] look at the fella who was looking for a
[1:07:48] little bride right rich man the rich
[1:07:52] man's son went to the culture all right
[1:07:55] and what was he looking for what was
[1:07:59] wholesome what was peeled coz what was
[1:08:01] his Chicago was horrible
[1:08:03] y'all don't talk to me now I see how
[1:08:07] easily that he could not present to
[1:08:10] Abraham son a horse something that
[1:08:14] something that was already tampered with
[1:08:17] in touch it had to be clear it had to be
[1:08:20] a version and you see the responsibility
[1:08:24] is like old man like oh god this is
[1:08:28] pressure Abraham told him look let me
[1:08:30] tell you something but you know it's
[1:08:33] good that they get follow the
[1:08:34] instruction well all right I guess
[1:08:39] because kids don't want to follow the
[1:08:41] father he he's old fogey he'll
[1:08:43] understand and he didn't need that we'll
[1:08:46] leave that alone
[1:08:48] somebody say boom oh brother fire I took
[1:08:54] responsibility that he had maybe he'll
[1:08:57] say listen don't you go to the streets
[1:09:01] don't you go to the world well I go to
[1:09:05] the world and and it's uh no you go to
[1:09:11] you go amongst my people
[1:09:13] we've changed that since the brown the
[1:09:16] one that happened to folk now folks we
[1:09:19] brought to our folk used to believe that
[1:09:22] we used to you know folk used to but now
[1:09:28] we go to the world
[1:09:30] I heard it's been a good little minute
[1:09:34] ago I heard your sister grew up around a
[1:09:37] message say I don't want no message boy
[1:09:47] you want to talk huh somebody go slap
[1:09:52] that head up five or six time cause you
[1:09:55] daddy to go to jail huh what you should
[1:10:03] want somebody to love the Lord
[1:10:05] somebody's gonna treat you right I don't
[1:10:08] want no Christian boy oh mercy
[1:10:12] anybody have said but should go much my
[1:10:14] people right amen
[1:10:18] and you what but what was he looking for
[1:10:21] he was looking for character something
[1:10:25] that was hosting something that was a
[1:10:27] virgin because he can't break it can't
[1:10:31] break amen the the the types of
[1:10:35] description right it's what is it still
[1:10:40] the father went up what the father is
[1:10:43] gonna present to his son it can't be
[1:10:47] horrible right it can't be a heart right
[1:10:52] Amen didn't watch the Prophet watch the
[1:10:58] Prophet I said what's the process
[1:11:01] he picks up cuz he said people Paul
[1:11:04] preached right watch inspiration see
[1:11:10] Bible School theology don't give you
[1:11:13] this what but the thing that the prophet
[1:11:15] of God had he didn't get some theology
[1:11:21] right amen
[1:11:24] he he looked back to the beginning say
[1:11:28] man the first time God God gave his son
[1:11:32] a wife he gave her version right looks
[1:11:39] down and evening time if if my son is
[1:11:43] going to get anything it's got to be a
[1:11:46] version
[1:11:47] it's got to be untouched it's got to be
[1:11:50] pure come on come over this is why the
[1:11:56] prophet of God constantly we're trying
[1:12:01] to drop it in showing the fallacy in all
[1:12:05] of this all of this all of this all of
[1:12:09] this right see a man why trying to get
[1:12:15] us back to the world back back to the
[1:12:19] Bible back to the word not
[1:12:22] denominationalism right you can't
[1:12:25] approach God when I miss not even in the
[1:12:27] message that's a tight statement now if
[1:12:31] you approach when I'm just in the
[1:12:32] message you gonna miss it you you gotta
[1:12:36] come you gotta come down with God
[1:12:39] provided wait no that's not no strike
[1:12:41] got some revelation I hope that didn't
[1:12:43] go over your head
[1:12:45] right because some people some people
[1:12:48] have that same type of mentality and
[1:12:51] attitude but you still gotta be born
[1:12:55] again see the Prophet never took us
[1:12:59] outside of the way he brought us back to
[1:13:02] the Bible back the Pentecost right back
[1:13:07] to the word because he realized what's
[1:13:10] got to be presented the crisis got
[1:13:13] because what came look what came the
[1:13:16] thing that God gave Adam came from
[1:13:24] right amen
[1:13:27] anything that Christ is getting come
[1:13:30] from him I might take off through here
[1:13:35] I got soft shoes on tonight I'd like to
[1:13:40] take off and run right now right see
[1:13:46] what came from Christ at Calvary this
[1:13:51] smitten bride was a perfect work bride
[1:13:56] it's got to be worried on work right now
[1:14:01] ain't got a bunch of clothes up here but
[1:14:03] I know what I'm talking about
[1:14:06] now if y'all need them I got a phone and
[1:14:09] Jack got a computer but I hope y'all
[1:14:13] don't need them I hope I hope y'all got
[1:14:16] our spiritual thinking cap song right
[1:14:20] amen we could we talk about Christ and
[1:14:25] any time we're looking at Christ we're
[1:14:27] looking at perfection we're looking at
[1:14:29] purity we're looking at ethics right
[1:14:33] we're looking at Holy Week we're looking
[1:14:35] at all things good right see there's no
[1:14:42] way that Christ will ever marry a hearty
[1:14:46] come on come on there's no way that
[1:14:51] Christ ever marry a harlot something
[1:14:54] that's been manhandled test for winning
[1:14:58] touch hang on do it right chica
[1:15:02] she's got to be worried upon world upon
[1:15:04] world upon world upon word upon word
[1:15:06] brother branham crazy no gang he's a
[1:15:11] false prophet no he wasn't the man had
[1:15:14] spiritual insight huh the man that
[1:15:18] spiritual insight don't take some I
[1:15:23] couldn't couldn't have saw all of this
[1:15:25] the things that I've seen I danced but
[1:15:27] wasn't for the message of the hour
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:35] then watch this I got 15 minutes okay
[1:15:42] so then he says I made position as they
[1:15:46] changed version to Christ but watch this
[1:15:48] he says but I fear lest by any means
[1:15:53] right as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:15:56] through his subtlety
[1:15:58] now watch Paul see Paul still working
[1:16:02] with Genesis look at look at inspiration
[1:16:05] look at Paul Paul looking at the church
[1:16:08] right look at brother smiling looking at
[1:16:10] the church the fear the fear of the
[1:16:15] ministry power looks Paul looks back a
[1:16:18] minute and Genesis at the first church
[1:16:21] and he see
[1:16:22] and then the serpent which was to some
[1:16:25] slavery something but but but a man
[1:16:28] well apart beast apart man closest thing
[1:16:32] was the man right that could speak that
[1:16:36] that could reason that could talk right
[1:16:40] the prophet of God said the problem that
[1:16:43] Eve had was she stopped to listen
[1:16:48] hmm amen she opened up the water her
[1:16:52] mind so you watch you watch people in
[1:16:58] this hour this stopping and then they're
[1:17:02] opening up their mind they opening up
[1:17:06] their mind that sounds reasonable
[1:17:09] that's exactly what he did but that's
[1:17:12] enough Eve the simplicity of God the
[1:17:18] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:17:21] God as long as she went to stay with
[1:17:24] that she would have lived she would have
[1:17:30] lived but the moment she stopped she
[1:17:35] opened up the wound of her mind I go
[1:17:36] back to spoken words the reason you see
[1:17:39] right he sold the scene
[1:17:43] right look at the look at the see that
[1:17:48] he sold it when it was a seed of dead it
[1:17:53] was a hybrid seed a seed of discrepancy
[1:17:59] from from from that to the adultery and
[1:18:03] then look at the wreckage the oneness
[1:18:08] was broken the hymen in the family was
[1:18:11] broken why because she stopped huh
[1:18:17] comeback a reading right she stopped she
[1:18:22] opened up the water her man
[1:18:24] saving right subtle Paul comes on the
[1:18:29] scene safe huh
[1:18:32] I see the same thing happening here
[1:18:34] right I see it's the same spirit right
[1:18:39] that's a just anointing men in this day
[1:18:43] when I would I brought y'all the reveal
[1:18:46] word of the hour right
[1:18:49] I can't y'all the hidden mysteries
[1:18:52] things that were seeing from the
[1:18:56] foundations of the world is that what
[1:18:58] Paul said then what I got what I'm
[1:19:01] getting is that the things that's been
[1:19:04] here from the foundations of the world
[1:19:08] huh
[1:19:10] and then these anointed was right these
[1:19:16] are anointed ones they come on this
[1:19:18] scene and say well who was Paul who was
[1:19:22] Paul science fair
[1:19:23] who was Paul who is Paul I mean if in
[1:19:29] part how can power say he's something
[1:19:33] when when he look at him he got him one
[1:19:37] coke
[1:19:40] huh he got one coat he kind of work
[1:19:50] hey that's the to what time you know his
[1:19:55] buddy
[1:19:55] his buddy walked away from him Dean
[1:19:57] missing the saint that you a man of God
[1:20:05] God was here to reveal the simplicity we
[1:20:09] missed God and simplicity I'm here with
[1:20:21] the kind of ministry that you've been
[1:20:23] given the kind of revelation that you've
[1:20:25] been given even you going to the twelfth
[1:20:27] chapter second Corinthians chapter 12
[1:20:30] where Paul was just kind of playing with
[1:20:32] in mind I was talking about how could
[1:20:35] have had something to boast but God gave
[1:20:37] him because of the abundance of
[1:20:39] revelation a messenger of Satan to
[1:20:43] buffing him to give him blow out the
[1:20:45] blow huh because of the depth of the
[1:20:49] revelation power operating upon the amen
[1:20:52] uh-uh
[1:20:53] a lion anointed a teaching anointed to
[1:20:56] rightly divide the word of doctor to the
[1:20:59] church but then those folks annoyed it
[1:21:01] was come the upon by inspiration
[1:21:04] inspiration picks him up and looking a
[1:21:05] man the Genesis right he sees the
[1:21:09] serpent he sees this the serpent amen
[1:21:13] uh-uh-uh approaching the church from an
[1:21:17] intellectual standpoint you can't reason
[1:21:22] with the devil huh look what he did at
[1:21:26] lasya that same devil after the church
[1:21:32] was established on the world right from
[1:21:38] the correct Godhead the correct order
[1:21:41] baptism I mean watch you see it the book
[1:21:46] of Acts you said they had everything in
[1:21:49] common one mind they believe the same
[1:21:51] thing
[1:21:52] but then the devil you can see in the
[1:21:57] Seventh Seal when the prophet of God he
[1:21:59] makes this statement he said what why
[1:22:01] why God kept that thing back because he
[1:22:04] said he'd Allah if he to put it out
[1:22:06] through the Angels he said the devil did
[1:22:08] a lot of damage look what the devil has
[1:22:11] done since the seals has been open look
[1:22:16] at the damage that he's done since the
[1:22:19] seals has been open so could you imagine
[1:22:27] what it would have been and he would
[1:22:29] have released those things in the first
[1:22:31] age Oh Lord
[1:22:34] we wouldn't know how to get back to God
[1:22:43] yeah he says I fear lest by any means as
[1:22:52] the serpent beguiled Eve we spiritually
[1:22:57] huh through his subtlety not right in
[1:23:02] your face right just a little like look
[1:23:07] at look at look at you know the Ephesian
[1:23:10] age right went with a little little seed
[1:23:14] a little little something that seems so
[1:23:18] in offensive this ain't gonna hurt
[1:23:22] nothing right a little little deep and
[1:23:27] that age a little bit Dean a little sin
[1:23:29] you know say that but look but look at
[1:23:33] look at the thing it was taken from it
[1:23:35] wasn't added to the church it was taken
[1:23:37] from the church right taking your
[1:23:41] position taking your place where we give
[1:23:43] it to one man I just finished in search
[1:23:47] engines or something we'll give all the
[1:23:53] the ability and anointing and everything
[1:23:55] to this just one man and and and and
[1:23:58] everybody that's kind of you know we sit
[1:24:01] we try to sit and absorb the things that
[1:24:04] he's saying
[1:24:05] and then you know we could just kind of
[1:24:07] live any kind of life we want to live
[1:24:09] you know it just seemed like it's like
[1:24:14] you see whether that's era the devil
[1:24:20] trying to take your position your place
[1:24:22] your authority to do that to do that to
[1:24:29] give all of the the power in the
[1:24:32] position to one man what that does for
[1:24:35] you where's your adoption
[1:24:38] what's your adoption where's your places
[1:24:41] where's your power huh you know I said
[1:24:46] it's in that one fella they in right
[1:24:50] there
[1:24:50] see you see the error we go back we go
[1:24:54] back 30 years right when we were up
[1:24:58] under a certain ministry well well you
[1:25:05] know all of the power and the position
[1:25:07] was given to this one man in this
[1:25:09] one-man church but then where's your
[1:25:11] power where's your position where's your
[1:25:13] place in the body and the show that it
[1:25:19] was error one year after the man goes
[1:25:22] off the scene the whole thing is in
[1:25:25] rumors huh why because it wasn't based
[1:25:31] upon the word right look at the hour
[1:25:35] that we live in in look at the subtlety
[1:25:37] of the serpent this is the thing as a
[1:25:40] ministry I fear right
[1:25:43] look keep moving keep it moving
