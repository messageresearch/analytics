========================================

got a gift she's trying to hide it let us bow in a quick word of Prayer dear heavenly father Lord we thank you God for your grace and your mercy father you are worthy tonight that we would all come here and be at your feet at your table father Lord God you said in your word it is better to be at your table than to be who father Intense or or dwelling in the counsel of the ungodly but father God we have made a choice this evening father that we would come and serve you and come and hear your word Lord we believe that you have prepared a word for us tonight so God I pray that you would speak Thy word Lord speak thy truth father that God your bride once more Lord would be edified your bride wants small love will be unified in your spirit father God I pray that you would meet the needs that are present tonight father God you know all about them Lord even before we ask father God you are aware so father God we commit ourselves to you and we pray that you'd be merciful to those that are still on the way and God those that are even watching online father God we pray that you would oh Father anoint what is being transmitted father God through the technology and God made change and transform and fulfill what your word has purposed to do god father God we also pray to you watch over our pastor and Lord our brothers father that has traveled God to fulfill your word Lord God we pray father that you would use them in a mighty way oh God and have your way with them Father we thank you tonight we commit all things into your hands move me out the way father God and may you have the preeminence tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I want to turn our Bibles tonight in the Book of Luke chapter 24 and we'll start at the 44th verse if you all would stand with me praise the Lord and just say Amen when you're there it's Luke 24 the 44th verse praise the Lord and it reads and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and I like that word behooves because it means a Duty or responsibility for someone to do something and I like that word because you're not Christ's burdened you are his duty so anytime you find yourself in a need you realize that your need is not a burden to Christ it's his duty as we continue reading uh it says thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to arise from the dead the third day and that repentance in remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry here Terry Yee in this city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high and he led them as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed him and it came to pass while he blessed him he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and last verse it says and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen you may have your seats may God add a blessing to his word and if I could use as a subject tonight I want to use uh the attributes of receiving the manifested word the attributes of receiving the manifested word in our theme this evening is Terry here now as we continue this little study tonight we find that God has always had a purpose in his word and in his word God will allow all things to be scripture says Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word of God will stand all circumstance and In This Moment here we find that Christ is telling his disciples that he would send his promise of his father upon them but before this promise he said Terry here in the city of Jerusalem until you're being due with power now these disciples had something that they could rest upon and it became their expectation that there would be a Witnesses of something God was getting ready to do now I said that it behooves Christ to endure the suffering it behooves Christ to actually go to the cross and I like it because Christ did not pay a price haphazardly for our lives he committed himself unto death right and when we realize that we find that God's not obligated to us because of who we are he's obligated to us because of who he is and he's made a way for us that we can all find peace and rest tonight and a message hear ye him in 1957. 0105 it says Jesus confirmed it he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first it is God seeking man you have nothing to do with it if you ever felt the hand of God knock at your heart you are a privileged person no man is saved not what you do but what he done notice no man is saved by law and I'm glad that he dismissed Moses Moses represented the law of the Sabbath keeping non-meat eating and all those laws and shadows he said away with it and we find in John chapter 1 verse 12. it says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believed in his name which were born not of blood not the will of God nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten son full of grace and truth the law was fulfilled through Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ right and now we find the title that I chose the attributes of receiving the manifested word now in the New Testament one of the first Miracles we find even before Christ was born and it was roaming through the ages and it took so many years for it to come to pass but it was that aversion shall conceive and when when this encounter came forth before Mary there was a family member that also got to be a witness of God's miracle of God's manifestation it was her cousin Elizabeth and Elizabeth was the Bible says blameless her and her husband's Zacharias blameless before the Lord they were righteous people but when it came time for Zacharias to receive the manifested word of what was told that would come to pass he he doubted it he had some art to some doubt in his heart and the scripture says he was he was a dumb man until his son was born now we find in the same in the same scene the the same Angel Gabriel visits Mary and tells Mary that uh we'll read it here in Luke the first chapter and it says and of 26 verse and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a version of spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her and said hell they are highly favored she the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be as the son of the highest and the Lord shall thou the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and I like how Mary's attitude throws this Angel was because she didn't understand what was happening but she was willing to submit herself to the prophecy Now The Story Goes On verse 34 then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing that I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousins Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Barren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her Mary was able to receive the message of the angel of that day to her and because she received it she was she became the Fulfillment of what was prophesied from ages before her time now the purpose of the word was was never for it to become to be to remain written the purpose of the word was that it would bring forth life to produce a substance of life right that's the purpose of the word now Mary receiving the word she became the carrier of the word and her became the manifestation of the word now she was predestinated we know that the promise was made since Genesis and she was the predestinated vessel to receive the promised word and because she was the predestinated word when she met what was said of the word by the angel Gabriel it became the manifested word in Luke 24 9 again it says behold I send the promise of my father upon you and Jesus spoke these things to the disciple and told them but Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now the power could not come without a tearing the power could not come without a tearing and I like that because the disciples had to understand not when Jesus would send the power but that Jesus would send to power they had to rest on that word it didn't matter where it didn't matter when but they had to rest on that word and God's promise for them was to Tarry as long as they were under that word and obeyed it they would receive what was spoken now we find that in Second Kings chapter 2 the first verse and it says and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah with Elisha from gilgal and Elisha said to Elijah Elijah said to Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave them leave thee so they went down to Bethel and now Elisha had a very specific attitude towards this word his attitude was that no matter the circumstance I will tarry hear now when we look at that it's easy to realize that perhaps Elijah meant for relation to Terry at a physical location where they were or perhaps to tarry at some place but the way that the word said it in the way that Elisha received it as though it was a dual meaning is that Elisha said as thy soul liveth and as the Lord liveth I will not leave thee and Elisha had to stand grounded to follow Elijah wherever he was going and we learned that gilgal Brownell says was just the first stage that represented justification and as they continued we find that in the third verse it says in the sons of the prophet that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto him know his doubt the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he says yea I know it hold ye your peace this was Elisha's attitude and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said have the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave him and that word Terry means to abide in expectation it means to remain or to stay in a place to sojourn and Elisha could stand no matter where Elijah was going he had an understanding of Revelation of Eliza's life that he wanted to be a witness of now we find in the fifth verse it says I in the sons of the Prophet that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him know it's that the Lord will take away thy master from the head today and he answered yay I know it hold your peace and Eliza said unto him Terry I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he has said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on and Prophet did uh certainly just brought out uh the the understanding of this scene as he went from gilgal to uh the the school of the prophets and from the school of the prophets unto Jordan and at this point we find that they had to try they had to cross over the other side of Jordan and Jordan represented death Elisha was willing to go all the way even unto death to be with Elijah and I believe that's what it requires of the believer going until death where where where death can be placed in you everything that is contrary or everything that is connected to our flesh can come to a complete death right if we if we just think on the things that are just physical attributes we will live as physical beings and we will die that way but if you think on the things that are Eternal and spiritual you will live as Spiritual Beings and you inherit God's Eternal Rewards now we find that in verse 9 at verse 8 rather it says and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided hither and hither so that they too went over the dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Eliza said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou Hast has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and I can imagine how fixated Elisha had to be on Elijah he had to keep his eyes only in Elijah brother Brado said he couldn't have one eyeball on Elijah and one eyeball on the on the students of the prophets and I believe it's the same thing because Eliza was a type of Christ you can't have one eye on Christ and one eye on the things of the world it takes having both eyes fixated on Christ at all times and Elisha was convicted and convinced that what Elijah had said would come to pass now Elijah I like how he said thou has asked a hard thing but nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be unto thee now this was not the Lord himself that granted this request to Elisha it was not thus saith the Lord this was Elijah he said this in authority of his of his position now it came to pass verse 11. that as they went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire imparted them both asunder and Elijah went up by Whirlwind of Heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and Horsemen thereof up also unto the matter and he saw them no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle from Elijah from him and smoked the waters and says where is the Lord God of Elijah and we can ask the same question where is the Lord God of Elijah the Lord God of Elijah is manifested in you tonight the Lord God of Elijah has manifested himself through Elijah and I like it because the manifested word produced the manifested word and notice how Elisha was an attribute of the manifested word when he received it that's what he became the very thing that he was fixing his eyes on is the very thing he came a product of and John John 14 12 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shaeedu also and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do and the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it I believe this is the the position that Elijah was standing on that whatever that Elisha had desired it would come to pass and Elisha was entrusted with a greater work of Elijah because he had a double Spirit of Elijah and the bread of Jesus Christ is entrusted with that same greater work we just read it says Greater Works how you do because I go to my father and we know brother Branham says it's not a greater work but it's a it's not a greater measure of what Christ did it's more of what he did now a question and answers preached 1964 0 8 30 in the morning it says paragraph 88 now brother Branham could you just look uh could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that now this was a question that was asked brother Branham if he was Jesus Christ and this was based on the way that he lived the the way he conducted himself but he answers the word he answers the question he says one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist for that person of the Lord is sitting at the right hand of majesty on high and will come again with great power in glory and we'll just jump to paragraph 89 it says remember my message on Messiahs see the word Messiah the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one then there's all kinds of anointed ones now watch if the Bible many of them are anointed the whole thing is such in a great conglomeration saying with all of his kindness come in and impersonate it just to the dot almost to the dot there's only one way you can absolutely be sure that's check the word by the word word by word there's only one way you can and he goes on to say in paragraph 92 it was so beautiful beautifully typed in Elijah and Elisha when Elisha was taken up the Elijah the old Prophet going home and he was tired and rarely and there was a chariot hooked across the river and he take him up home with horses of fire and did you notice when Elijah and Elisha crossed the river the school of prophets was up there watching him and Elijah took his mantle and struck the river and when it did it divided and he ran across and he said to the young Prophet what are you following me for what do you wish he said a double portion of your spirit come upon me a double portion of that Mighty Prophet come upon me he said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me when I go away then it'll come upon you so you can imagine how he watched the prophet paragraph 94 says now in that day the prophet was the word for he was the manifestation of the word to the world see he know that he had to be a greater Ministry come because it required a greater thing and when Jesus was here on Earth he was Elijah these things that I do you will do also greater than these things shall you do because I go unto my father now you're going how are you going to do it watch him who is he the word see watch him praise God and I encourage you tonight Saints to watch Jesus as you watch him you'll become him and we'll continue here now when Elijah when the double Spirit of Elijah Came Upon Elisha Elijah said this was a hard thing this was a hard request this was a hard desire but this week this this this initiative that whatsoever you would ask was was initiated from Elijah and Elisha just asked he says a double Spirit a double portion of that spirit and if we turn to our Bibles to Matthew 20 verse 20 and while we turn there I'd like to read this other quote from the prophet it says it says the message the prophet Elisha preached in 1954. paragraph 20 he says after Elijah had crossed over God over on the other side he said to that young prophet and them two prophets represented perfectly Christ in the church Elijah was going away leaving the authority with the church was a type of Christ going away leaving the authority with the church but the church had to come through Lutheran age through the Methodist age through the baptism of the Holy Spirit die out to itself in order to receive the blessing there's got to be a death that comes before the blessing and it goes on to say that's the way to ask ask plenty God likes to give that way that's that's the trouble people say I asked the father for so much oh my don't be scared to ask him ask and ask just all you can ask he likes to give you just as much as you got faith to receive he won't run out God's got plenty of blessings and he's got a blessing for you tonight you can't be afraid to ask him you see when you ask him you have to be expecting to receive of him and and I believe it's not just asking for big things it's asking for things that that that are almost impossible what Elisha had asked Elijah was a hard thing but he received it and that's the that's the word that the bride of Christ stands on today where the bride can ask confidently for things that only God can do now we find in this Matthew 20 verse 20 it says then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what will thou what is your request in other words she saith unto him Grant these that my two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said ye know not what you ask and if I could just add this was something that was asked that was not even into existence yet what's uh the mothers that the zebedes as brother gwinner would say sister's ebony that's what she was asking she was asking for something that didn't even come into existence yet and Christ had to put them back in position to say you don't even know what you're asking for now it goes to say are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he said unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not my to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and this is a very interesting response because Christ knew what the request was he knew what it was which is why he could say it's reserved for them whom is prepared for of my father and and I like this because we know that Christ has gone to prepare a place for you and I he's gone to reserve a place for those that are consecrated in him for the manifested word of the manifested word now what is this place that a a sister Zebedee was asking Jesus what was this place if we read Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 it says to him that overcometh will I regret to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath in here let him hear what the spirit say it to the churches so this was something that uh a sisters ebony was concerned about her two sons being James and John that they would sit one at the right hand and the other at the on the left hand now if we read from the prophet we find it says in paragraph 94 the message how can I overcome you know one time the mother of James and John he says we won't have time to read it do you know that Lord you remember that Lord let my son sit on one side and my other son sit on the other side says there's a mother's desire for her son but watch but that place Jesus was predestinated this position was not in existence at that time why notice it will be granted to them who is met for watch the one that sat on the right hand and the other closest to him was yet an overcomer he said I don't Grant this I can't Grant this but it will be given after the trials come he said amen I can't give this but after the trial comes they'll sit on the right hand and on the left there's a predestinated seed waiting out yonder for that it will be given to the ones that is promised to it'll be given but the test hasn't come yet and we know that we're living in the great and terrible day of the Lord that that predestinated a a a place was reserved for you and I because there Christ knew that'd be a a a age that would be filled with Darkness a age where there would be tribulation after tribulation but he also says there will be Overcomers right they would overcome by the blood of the lamb and the and the word of his testimony and we know that if God has said in his word we will overcome we will overcome no matter the circumstance but God has allowed us to be in a season where we can ask because God says ask abundantly that your joy may be filled he wants us to ask of him of these things that he would bless us of these things now if we continue here we find that at the day where day of Pentecost where scripture says that they will receive power after the Holy Ghost would come and we find that Peter and John once they receive this power once they receive this anointing in their lives the first thing that they one of the first things that they did they went to this Temple and at the gate of beautiful the scripture says there was a certain man and we'll read it together here verse 2 in Acts chapter 3 says there was a certain man that that came that was laying from his mother's womb was carried away whom they lay daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask of alms of them that enter into the temple and I like it because this man wasn't just sitting there asking but he was sitting there expecting to receive something and as he was sitting there the scripture says he looked upon Peter and then Peter fixed his eyes on him first thing Peter told him is look on us just like Elijah told Elisha to to watch me now look on us it wasn't talking about the flesh but Peter and John at this point in their lives was the manifested word look on us and Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give unto thee this was a substance that only God himself could produce in the life of Peter in the life of John you see and one of the attributes of receiving the manifested word is that you become an enforcer of the word you go to certain places and people will have to check their lives and act in a righteous way because you're there because your life calls for a higher standard your life calls for those two have a reference for the word of God right now this man went from being a beggar to a worshiper right he got healed the scripture says he's uh he immediately come on he immediately received strength in his bones and his feet and he he got up and he walked and he entered into the temple walking and leaping and praising God this attitude of this man allowed him to receive the manifested word right he he had an attitude of being under expectation to receive something it was his season to receive that now we find here that as Paul as Peter has done these things that was questioned that arose and I can imagine at this point after such a miracle after such a supernatural occurrence that questions would arise we see if the word does not challenge you it's a moment to reflect because wherever Peter went wherever John went no matter what they were surrounded by the word allowed them to find a way of Escape right now we find here in second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16. and I like this because verse 16 it reads for which cause we faint not but though our outman word outward man perish yet the n-word man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us are far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory which means if you're not going through something there is not a weight that you'll be able to bear that will allow you to overcome and it reads why we look at things which are seen but at things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal and when we think about that the disciples that Jesus Christ chose he gave them power he gave them power over serpents power over the devil he gave them power that that the the threat upon serpents and scorpions power over the enemy and he says nothing shall by any means hurt you but after he said all of that he had to reassure them he had to tell them he says notwithstanding in this Rejoice not because the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven he had to realign their eyes so they weren't looking at the physical power that they had or the power over spirits right this was a power that they were defaulted with but Jesus had to tell them that there's one thing to have the power over spirits but it's one thing to have the power to believe the word and that's why Judas was not able to go all the way because there was something in him that was lacking it takes power of believing the word and as you believe the word you become the manifestation of the word and in closing I want to I want to add this here and a message an exposition of the seventh Church Asia this is the Ephesian Church age it says the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened until pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes is his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord and all his work are perfect in fact and her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot un do though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God had spoken it and how can all-powerful God look upon us and choose us for this purpose it's because like I said earlier not because of who we are but he's obligated to his word because of who he is his nature causes him to be perfect in all of his ways and when we receive that word we carry the same nature when we receive that word we carry the same power where we can be unified in the spirit now in second Corinthians chapter 5. though we don't understand it there's a longing there's a desire in our hearts to be clothed with our Eternal Tabernacle in verse 1 it says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in Heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is in heaven if so be that being closed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothe upon that mortality will be swallowed up of life now he that had wrought us for the same self thing of God who also have given us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord in verse 7 for we walk by faith and not by sight praise the Lord and we find that scripture says we have the earnest that means we have the down payment that means we have the substance in us to walk in this power to walk in this manifested word and as we walk in this manifested word the manifested word allows us to overcome all things allows us to oversee all things right scripture says when the enemy will come in like a flood the spirit would raise up a standard against it the standard is reflected in our lives no matter where we go because there is an attribute of resurrection power there's an attribute of righteousness there's an attribute of Holiness all these things God allows to flow when we become the manifested word of our day praise God let us bow the word of Prayer thank you dear heavenly father Lord God I just thank you Father for your word Lord and God we know that your word that can never fail Lord we receive it father and not only do we receive it Lord but we are under expectation that father as you have God in your word just through your Prophet Elijah what would allow him to ask what Elisha's desire would be refine Lord sisters ebony went on to asking oh God for something that was not even present at that time but Lord You've challenged Us in this hour to ask and ask abundantly that our joy may be filled so father God we ask for great things we ask for things that are impossible to man but that are possible to you we ask for things that only you can move upon that you will be glorified Lord and father God we realize as we believe for these things God Lord God you've made us to also carry this eternal weight of Glory this power that you've promised through your Holy Spirit so father God I pray Lord that your word will continue to nourish our souls that father in every circumstance Lord God will will be faithful and will pass the test Lord and as you've promised in your word we will overcome and sit at your right hand father God we ask tonight Lord that your word Lord would just enter into the very depths of our hearts and that throughout each day father God will live in an atmosphere where where we can't give someone finances or or or different things of man-made material but we can give him Jesus Christ so father God we just thank you
