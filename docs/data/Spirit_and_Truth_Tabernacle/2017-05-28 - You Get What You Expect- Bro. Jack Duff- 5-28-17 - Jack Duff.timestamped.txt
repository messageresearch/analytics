[45:05] I'm Matthew 9 verse 27 it says and when
[45:10] Jesus departed then two blind men
[45:13] followed him crying and saying thou son
[45:17] of David have
[45:18] mercy on us and when he was coming to
[45:21] the house the blind men came to him and
[45:23] jesus saith unto them believe he that
[45:26] I'm able to do this they said to him
[45:29] yeh Lord been touched he their eyes
[45:32] saying according to your faith be it
[45:34] unto you and their eyes were open and
[45:37] Jesus straitly charged them saying see
[45:39] that no man knowing now you know that's
[45:43] almost impossible right two blind men
[45:45] get healed hi-hi are they not going to
[45:48] be able to tell it right when people saw
[45:52] them yesterday you couldn't see but now
[45:53] all of a sudden you are seeing I can may

[46:04] departed spreader brought his fame and
[46:07] all that country as they went out the
[46:11] hole they brought to him a dumb man
[46:13] possessed with a devil so brother
[46:16] Branham brought out brought to attention
[46:17] that when a person has a dumb spirit
[46:20] where they can't speak that's a devil
[46:22] that's finding them stopping them from
[46:25] being able to speak verse 33 says that
[46:27] when the devil was cast out that's all
[46:30] that needs to happen when the devil is
[46:32] cast out the dumb spake and the
[46:34] multitudes marveled saying it was never
[46:36] so seen in Israel but the Pharisee said
[46:40] he casteth out devils through the Prince
[46:42] of the Devils
[46:43] and Jesus went bout went about all the
[46:46] cities and villages teaching in their
[46:48] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[46:51] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[46:52] and every disease among the people the
[46:56] Lord and a blessing to the reading of
[46:58] his word let us bow in a word of Prayer
[47:02] amen on today God we are grateful for
[47:05] the privilege we have to read the word
[47:07] of the Lord but we know it takes the
[47:10] Holy Spirit to help quicken what we've
[47:13] read and make it come alive to our
[47:15] hearts make it live for even right now
[47:18] we trust God that is not just Bible
[47:21] stories but that we can look deeper into
[47:23] this and see that you are the same
[47:25] yesterday today and forever so if you
[47:28] did it back then you can do
[47:30] again today so help us got to apply our
[47:33] faith to the word that we have heard and
[47:35] may you God just get glory and honor out
[47:37] of everything that happens here we take
[47:39] control every spirit that is against
[47:41] your spirit and we bind it now in the
[47:43] name of Jesus we cast it out and access
[47:46] you God will come and have complete
[47:48] authority in Jesus name we pray amen god
[47:52] bless you you can be seated a man this
[47:54] morning praise the Lord
[47:58] a man we want to just take our title
[48:02] this morning you get what you expect a
[48:05] man you get what you expect and just to
[48:11] identify a man this word expectation and
[48:15] define it for us this morning it's a
[48:17] strong belief that something will happen
[48:21] and man when you have an expectation you
[48:24] have a strong belief a man you might not
[48:28] be able to put your your finger on when
[48:30] it's going to happen a man you might not
[48:33] be able to tell people how it's going to
[48:35] happen Amen but you have a strong belief
[48:38] that it is going to happen praise the
[48:41] Lord and as Christians we should always
[48:43] be walking around in under expectation
[48:46] maybe we should always have a faith a
[48:48] man in the Word of God that whatever God
[48:51] has promised you ought to be looking for
[48:53] it all the time looking for it to be
[48:55] fulfilled no matter what comes against
[48:57] you it may be your expectations still
[48:59] say there's going to happen praise the
[49:01] Lord if it's healing you got to expect
[49:03] that it's going to happen even if in
[49:05] your body you're going to feel worse you
[49:07] still have to have an expectation that
[49:09] it's going to get better
[49:11] Alleluia if you're going through a man
[49:14] of trouble sometimes even in your
[49:16] finances and you know that God promised
[49:18] you a man that he's going to rebuke the
[49:21] Devourer for your sake you might not be
[49:23] able to tell people when it's going to
[49:25] happen but your expectation says it is
[49:29] going to happen and if you can keep your
[49:31] expectations then you get what you
[49:33] expect
[49:37] and I know everybody going through some
[49:39] type of trial here today but my
[49:41] encouragement is that and don't let the
[49:43] devil take your expectation well
[49:47] whatever you do don't let them take that
[49:49] and I mean everything is coming against
[49:51] you right but don't let the devil take
[49:53] your expectation that's a strong lean
[49:56] belief Amen that something will happen
[49:59] and it's in the narcissus as there's
[50:02] something what happens or is going to be
[50:03] the case in the future so expectation
[50:06] deals with the future our event my
[50:10] expectation you don't have to have
[50:12] expectation with something that you see
[50:13] them right now but expectations what you
[50:16] see in the future and faith is the thing
[50:18] that annoys your expectation things has
[50:21] long-range vision faith is now looking
[50:24] at the current circumstance this is not
[50:27] looking at the sect of the current
[50:28] situation case does not listen to what
[50:31] the doctors say it tastes not looking at
[50:33] anything so take his long-range vision
[50:36] if I think kissing is beautiful bring it
[50:40] to pass come on somebody Amen you don't
[50:46] get what you expect
[50:50] hallelujah somebody so if I tell you I'm
[50:53] under expectation for some great things
[50:55] let me just try to slip myself down
[50:58] because you know I just I feel my I feel
[51:00] my help
[51:01] like they say I film I help copy a man
[51:06] let's listen at this the and the sermon
[51:08] believe about this the Prophet says here
[51:11] 300 years ago it says a French scientist
[51:15] proved that if you go the terrific speed
[51:19] of 35 miles an hour gravitation would
[51:21] take you off the earth you say you think
[51:24] science would refer back to that today
[51:26] it says are there going 1900 miles an
[51:31] hour and still going on they're pressing
[51:34] forward looking for it but we want to
[51:37] look back and see what moody said and
[51:38] thank you say it Finley said knocks
[51:40] Calvin some of those what they said was
[51:43] all right that was for their age but
[51:45] we're going on
[51:46] my grandfather rode rocks
[51:48] I'm driving a Ford v8 my son will fly a
[51:53] jet plane amen
[51:55] that's where that's we're moving on
[51:57] that's what religion ought to be the
[52:00] coming of the Lord is at hand
[52:01] the church ought to be moving on into
[52:04] the powers now I like this you know that
[52:07] this discernment believers out if you
[52:09] say the church ought to be moving on
[52:11] into the powers glory to God
[52:15] science can only climb so far and then
[52:19] it has to drop off but look at this but
[52:22] we got untapped sources come on church
[52:28] amen
[52:28] I haven't even began to in there enjoy
[52:32] y'all clock out for me and then I got
[52:35] some untapped sources and I'm ready to
[52:39] tap into them right I'm ready to
[52:41] experience them say he said we got
[52:43] untapped sources that never been touched
[52:46] it says of the power a limit of God that
[52:50] we ought to be moving into we're living
[52:53] a million miles under our privilege
[52:56] tonight our privileges of Christians to
[52:58] be enjoying I'm looking for that you're
[53:03] I'm supposed to be enjoying this FSS I
[53:06] feel ashamed of myself when I look out
[53:08] here see the institutions and the
[53:10] sickness and the troubles that's going
[53:12] on right now our search ought to be walk
[53:17] in the street I would search ought to be
[53:23] welcome the street let me put it this
[53:26] way our church ought to be healing the
[53:29] sick all at search ought to be raising
[53:33] the dance how it search ought to be
[53:37] casting out Devils
[53:39] amen our church ought to be doing signs
[53:42] and wonders making my whole world
[53:44] realize that Jesus Christ live that's
[53:48] where our churches they're supposed to
[53:50] be
[53:51] it said that's what we need to be done
[53:55] of doing a man so my expectation that
[53:58] we're going to be moving into that
[53:59] sphere
[54:00] not many days hence glory to God
[54:03] expectation is a strong belief that
[54:05] something will happen or be the case in
[54:09] the future glory to God let me just kind
[54:13] of drop into another little thought here
[54:14] on a bleeding of the Spirit of God a man
[54:18] leading of the Spirit of God the Prophet
[54:21] makes this comment also says
[54:23] expectations says if you're expecting it
[54:27] you will receive it I want you to get
[54:33] that one if you're expecting it you will
[54:37] receive it
[54:40] glory to god I'm just really I got some
[54:44] things that I want to just kind of drop
[54:45] in there when I went I'm just waiting
[54:47] but but there's you know we got to see
[54:50] ourselves you know getting that promise
[54:52] we got to see ourselves receiving what
[54:55] God spoke you know that we can receive
[54:57] we got we got to already see tax a man
[55:00] says expectations if you're expecting it
[55:03] you will receive it so you usually get
[55:06] what you expect to get hallelujah you
[55:10] know sometimes you know your expectation
[55:14] is that strong belief right of something
[55:17] that will happen and and and sometimes
[55:19] you know you can have a strong belief
[55:22] internally even though you have not
[55:24] expressed it externally like not now
[55:27] stay with me on this one because you
[55:29] know oftentimes you can be saying one
[55:31] thing with your mouth right but on the
[55:34] inside you don't believe what you just
[55:36] said you said it because that's the
[55:39] right thing to stay around Christians
[55:41] that's the only reason you said it
[55:44] because you know you you ain't gonna
[55:45] talk no doubt round no Christians you
[55:47] already know what they gonna say let out
[55:49] you know it I was I was just talking
[55:51] with brother Diggs and we were just kind
[55:53] of sharing and said when he came down
[55:55] here and you know and he was going
[55:56] through that blindness you know in his
[55:58] eyes so every everybody had a quote for
[56:01] him everybody had a scripture you know
[56:03] everybody says you know just just just
[56:05] say this to just do that and just
[56:08] believe it just keep repeating five
[56:09] strikes I'm here then I've been doing
[56:12] that for real
[56:13] right he's saying and it's not that it's
[56:15] not that I don't believe that of course
[56:18] I believe that what my expectations say
[56:21] I don't want to just get it I want to
[56:23] experience it right so you know when we
[56:29] went you know often times up when we
[56:31] call through different things you know
[56:32] we just kind of say the right expression
[56:34] when we get around Christians right with
[56:36] this we go we know exactly how to put it
[56:38] but on the end of you know in the back
[56:42] of your mind even though you have
[56:43] confessed you know by structure meal
[56:45] you got a but but the doctor said now
[56:50] you know but this about that is he's
[56:53] been the reason that that but that you
[56:55] have that's your expectation even though
[57:00] you have not actually ceremony enough in
[57:02] your heart that's what you believe and
[57:04] you don't get what you expect see but
[57:09] with faith I need some of that
[57:11] expectation amen you have the right
[57:14] mental attitude towards what God has
[57:16] promised you then the darkening say one
[57:18] thing saying you can tell everybody not
[57:20] a doctor said this but my god a mentor
[57:25] either got a hit of all my diseases see
[57:28] your expectation has change of not based
[57:30] on what the doctor said your
[57:32] expectations based on what the Word of
[57:34] God says and that type of expectation
[57:37] you don't get what you expect stay with
[57:41] me here expectation if you expecting you
[57:44] receive it you usually get what you
[57:45] expect to get if you come to the meeting
[57:47] tonight expect you to find something to
[57:49] criticize Amen something to criticize
[57:53] the meeting the devil will show you
[57:56] because that's what you're expecting you
[57:58] were looking for something wrong so the
[58:00] devil going to show you something wrong
[58:01] and you're gonna go home with something
[58:02] wrong right
[58:04] but if you expect them to get some from
[58:05] God then you leave here with some from
[58:07] God hallelujah say he will sin he will
[58:10] see that you get satisfied the devil
[58:13] will meet your expectation and if the
[58:16] devil can reach expectation what do you
[58:19] think about God
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:23] see he said he talked about the devil he
[58:26] will see that you get satisfied says you
[58:28] get what you expect if you come to get
[58:30] up sing hallelujah anybody come to get
[58:35] one of them today if you come come on we
[58:38] got safe test driving a long way they
[58:41] didn't come to play games with this they
[58:44] need blessings they come to get a
[58:46] blessing then often many times the fakes
[58:50] have come into the church not knowing
[58:52] what the message was going to be that
[58:54] day but they knew they had something
[58:56] that they needed to call and the right
[58:58] one will be spoken right to their
[59:00] situation they leave with a blessing
[59:03] come on church it's the way that we
[59:06] approach this thing look at this we face
[59:08] there's our said you get what your spec
[59:11] if you come to get a blessing God will
[59:13] see that you get it I love this I wanna
[59:17] I want to hold on I want to work with
[59:19] that just for a little bit God will see
[59:20] that you get it
[59:21] if you come to get saved God will see
[59:24] that you that you get it if you come to
[59:27] get he'll be expecting to get healed God
[59:30] will see that you do it is whatever you
[59:33] expect him now sir today is the Simeon
[59:37] they didn't have telegrams and so forth
[59:40] like date like they do today and they
[59:42] did have televisions and the radios and
[59:43] so forth amount of slides as we have the
[59:46] message whip was from lip to ear and you
[59:49] know only those only those who expect
[59:51] and usually get what they're looking for
[59:52] now let's pick up send me in here in the
[59:54] scripture turn with me to Luke chapter 2
[59:56] and I will pick him up my god if you
[1:00:00] expect that God will see that you get it
[1:00:02] God will see to it if that's what you
[1:00:06] expected Alleluia but also if you got
[1:00:09] something negative a man the devil gonna
[1:00:11] see to it that you get it glory to God
[1:00:14] you're going to get what you expect
[1:00:15] either way you're going to either get it
[1:00:17] from God you're going to get it from the
[1:00:18] devil praise God
[1:00:21] Luke chapter 2 verse 25 let's look at
[1:00:24] how Simeon is approaching a man church
[1:00:27] glory to God Amen when you look at this
[1:00:30] and verse 25 says behold there was a man
[1:00:32] in Jerusalem
[1:00:34] whose name was Simeon and the same man
[1:00:37] was just a devout waiting for the
[1:00:40] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] was upon him and it was revealed unto
[1:00:45] him by the Holy Ghost that he should not
[1:00:49] see death before he had seen the Lord's
[1:00:53] Christ now when I look at this man
[1:00:55] Simeon I just begin to think of my mind
[1:00:57] how many times this man by the might
[1:00:59] have been that close to death maybe
[1:01:01] laying on this sick man doctors don't
[1:01:04] start they pulled a glass was down they
[1:01:06] shaking their hands there ain't no hope
[1:01:07] for this man but Simeon got a promise
[1:01:10] that I am NOT going to see death until I
[1:01:13] see the Lord's Christ and simming that
[1:01:16] look the doctor now I say doctor maybe
[1:01:18] you can't help me and I understand you
[1:01:20] don't did everything you possibly could
[1:01:22] you don't mix this up and mix it up you
[1:01:24] don't did Avery and I appreciate your
[1:01:26] efforts but I got a promise and Simeon
[1:01:29] can look at us enough maybe you ain't
[1:01:31] got the same promise that I got but God
[1:01:33] told me I will not see death until I've
[1:01:37] seen it was quite Benny hair to his
[1:01:41] revelation and Simeon got what he was
[1:01:44] expecting it was a friendly he could
[1:01:48] explain if anybody but he has strong
[1:01:50] belief that God made him a promise
[1:01:51] and he was going to hold on to that I
[1:01:54] could see sympathy even if I died God to
[1:01:57] raise me up well as they say say and he
[1:02:02] came by the spirit and this is this this
[1:02:05] is the critical Amen component here -
[1:02:08] what Simeon did that day he came by the
[1:02:12] spirit unto the temple and my question
[1:02:15] to you is how did you come to church
[1:02:17] this one not that's the question how did
[1:02:21] you come are you coming out of tradition
[1:02:23] how are you coming it because I got
[1:02:26] nothing else better to do or Sunday but
[1:02:28] are you coming in the spirit expecting
[1:02:32] God to do something for you today
[1:02:35] sisimiut gain by the spirit into the
[1:02:38] temple and then opinion when the parents
[1:02:41] brought in the Child Jesus to do for him
[1:02:43] after the custom of the law
[1:02:46] and took him up in his arms and blessed
[1:02:48] God and said Lord now lettest thou thy
[1:02:52] servant depart in peace according to our
[1:02:55] words
[1:02:55] since when my eyes have seen thy
[1:02:58] salvation you know what Jim you could
[1:03:00] even go blind he can die he can go
[1:03:07] bloody with cover with promises and in
[1:03:12] his promise with a revelation that was
[1:03:14] given to him as an individual
[1:03:17] nobody else got this but never even had
[1:03:19] it and he's done on this relation don't
[1:03:25] you go out to stand on your own personal
[1:03:27] revelation and when you do that you
[1:03:30] don't get what you expect glory to God
[1:03:34] glory to God glory to God I am plan on
[1:03:37] losing nothing Amen I lose enough that I
[1:03:41] lose in my house I'm losing my tie
[1:03:42] losing nothing
[1:03:47] hallelujah look at this it's a thought
[1:03:51] now let's stop serving that servant
[1:03:53] depart in peace according to that word
[1:03:54] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[1:03:56] which thou has prepared before the face
[1:03:58] of all people light to light the
[1:04:01] Gentiles and the glory of thy people
[1:04:03] Israel
[1:04:04] Simeon God what he expected a man and
[1:04:09] went you know we think about this
[1:04:10] expectations is usually based upon faith
[1:04:13] brother Branham made some comments in
[1:04:16] the sermon expectation 1961 February 5th
[1:04:21] and I'm just kind of making and just
[1:04:23] given a few quotes from here so
[1:04:24] expectation useless based upon faith you
[1:04:27] have to have faith before you can expect
[1:04:29] anything right says now like many of the
[1:04:33] servants of God no Testament faith
[1:04:34] cometh by hearing and hearing other
[1:04:36] words so you got to have faith before
[1:04:37] you can expect anything
[1:04:39] another thing you say you can't go to
[1:04:40] people and say now do you think I got my
[1:04:44] healing
[1:04:45] you can't go nobody acts in that you
[1:04:48] know using the same service I was in do
[1:04:50] you think I got it
[1:04:53] what you think about it it ain't what
[1:04:56] they think it's what you think right a
[1:05:00] man you know you often time to go
[1:05:03] looking for people to give us
[1:05:05] confirmations know that Bible gives us
[1:05:08] the confirmation and then God speaks to
[1:05:10] you you got your own confirmation you
[1:05:12] don't need nothing else
[1:05:13] Holly I don't care if God spoke to you
[1:05:15] twenty years ago you hold on to what he
[1:05:17] said to you 20 years ago and keep
[1:05:19] expecting hallelujah see you say he says
[1:05:23] he says you can't go around you can't go
[1:05:26] to people say now do you think I got my
[1:05:27] healing you think it's nothing what they
[1:05:30] think that has nothing to do into it
[1:05:32] it's what you think it's up to you you
[1:05:34] also say when we get all the little
[1:05:37] disbelieving spirits away from us now
[1:05:40] this is important God it's important
[1:05:44] because once the disbeliever spirit come
[1:05:46] away then you begin to see what you
[1:05:48] expected and i'ma try to say you by the
[1:05:52] gray sky Abraham had to get the
[1:05:54] disbelievers spirits away from him
[1:05:56] when the disbelievers Pierce was there
[1:05:58] must every time he did things that he
[1:06:00] should not have done he tried to help
[1:06:03] God out God promised him a son and here
[1:06:07] was this especially now ain't no way
[1:06:09] darker touched my body I better help
[1:06:10] children are sick just take my hand made
[1:06:12] taketake Haga and here just just leave
[1:06:15] in spirit sitting there Abraham's house
[1:06:17] and he follows my road that this
[1:06:19] principal person Ishmael but when the
[1:06:22] disbelievers fear got away then he
[1:06:24] popping eyes all right Church glory to
[1:06:30] God let's stay with it here says this
[1:06:32] and said when we get all that little
[1:06:33] just believe in spirits away from us
[1:06:35] here's what I want you know what I was
[1:06:37] coming to see when I looked at Abraham
[1:06:39] we all have to kind of go through this
[1:06:41] time of maturity even when it come to
[1:06:44] the promises right you know oftentimes
[1:06:46] we can receive something from God and we
[1:06:49] think we really got it right but but
[1:06:52] here coming enemy to try that and the
[1:06:54] test to see if we really got what you
[1:06:55] know what God told you that he was
[1:06:57] giving you and sometimes we make
[1:06:59] decisions we make choices that show that
[1:07:03] we don't truly believe all that God said
[1:07:06] and you know and we might get something
[1:07:09] out of it but we didn't get the perfect
[1:07:11] perfect plan of God out of it hallelujah
[1:07:14] church right Abraham did get affirmed
[1:07:16] but now the promise on hallelujah we got
[1:07:20] a little harlot I mean God want to bring
[1:07:22] it to a perfect face right where I mean
[1:07:25] if God said it that settles it I ain't
[1:07:27] changing nothing imma stay right with
[1:07:28] this no matter how long it takes my
[1:07:30] expectation will not change all right
[1:07:33] stay with me here let's go on he says I
[1:07:36] don't care
[1:07:36] it says when we get over this little
[1:07:38] just leave the spirits away from us and
[1:07:39] just take out at his word I don't care
[1:07:42] what so-and-so said and so and so that
[1:07:44] God's made the promise I stand right
[1:07:47] here then God will go to answering a lot
[1:07:50] of statement he makes say the longer the
[1:07:52] wait the greater the miracle you make
[1:07:58] sure I've been waiting a long time
[1:07:59] brother Jack the longer the wait the
[1:08:00] greater the miracle it just means so
[1:08:02] much when someone say I was waiting 25
[1:08:04] years right another person I was waiting
[1:08:07] on hundred and twenty years but I was
[1:08:09] waiting this the longer the wait the
[1:08:11] greater the miracle it sure that God
[1:08:14] didn't forget glory glory glory listen
[1:08:19] says I'm reading also from just a few
[1:08:22] notes here from a sermon that he
[1:08:23] preached if anything too hard for the
[1:08:25] Lord says it happened because he
[1:08:28] expected it to happen the Abraham had
[1:08:30] the baby after 25 years the reason that
[1:08:32] happened is because Abraham expected it
[1:08:34] to happen since when something anchors
[1:08:37] in your heart where you know it's going
[1:08:39] to happen then something is going to
[1:08:41] happen say if it don't happen right now
[1:08:44] it will happen after a while if it don't
[1:08:48] happen today it will happen tomorrow if
[1:08:51] it got up tomorrow it will be next week
[1:08:53] whatever is going to happen anyhow God
[1:08:57] said so there you are
[1:08:58] now you're getting down to where you
[1:09:00] have faith when you start talking like
[1:09:04] that now you really got things because
[1:09:06] it's not being changed by the
[1:09:07] circumstances it's not being changed by
[1:09:09] you know whatever whatever whatever else
[1:09:12] occurs you still got faith believing
[1:09:14] that God makes your promise and and it
[1:09:16] can not fall to the ground of return boy
[1:09:17] so if it don't happen
[1:09:20] right now it's going to happen after a
[1:09:22] while if it don't happen today
[1:09:24] it'll happen tomorrow if it don't happen
[1:09:27] tomorrow it will be next week a man
[1:09:32] whatever is going to happen anyhow
[1:09:34] thought that so that's my faith church I
[1:09:38] got some things I'm holding on to and I
[1:09:40] tell you this is where my faith is they
[1:09:43] say say I am going to be the one that's
[1:09:46] going to be healed when you're walking
[1:09:48] into a service it might be a whole bunch
[1:09:50] of people but because I'm coming to
[1:09:52] church in the spirit I'm not counting
[1:09:56] testicle just where they buy together
[1:09:58] I'm coming because of atmospheres comfy
[1:10:00] created and this place in a girl nobody
[1:10:03] else get the healing I'm gonna be the
[1:10:06] one I'm living in Church of my healing I
[1:10:10] mean with my deliverance I'm moving with
[1:10:13] my promises reveal the earth expectation
[1:10:20] hallelujah hallelujah you know when you
[1:10:23] can imagine how and some of the prophecy
[1:10:26] meanings different people come with
[1:10:28] expectations Angelo will be with
[1:10:30] Minnesota here and then move over there
[1:10:32] didn't move over it's just moving all
[1:10:33] over the place because all these people
[1:10:35] had expectation I could just imagine
[1:10:37] somebody maybe how the Holy Spirit
[1:10:39] beginner deal with some other situation
[1:10:41] to call out this this one condition and
[1:10:44] said sister you got this that you're
[1:10:45] dealing with and this other so so I said
[1:10:47] I got the same thing in a God can speak
[1:10:50] to huh then let us speak to me and you
[1:10:53] let you to enjoy Lord just need faith to
[1:10:54] stop building up and everybody getting
[1:10:57] in getting their deliverance
[1:10:58] that's expec and you're looking the
[1:11:00] reason that they are doubt it because
[1:11:02] each one came on the expectation if your
[1:11:06] family first you call me second if you
[1:11:08] don't comment second you commentary you

[1:11:28] blessing to your heart these these you

[1:13:57] I went on across the street and I
[1:14:00] started to go across to the drugstore to
[1:14:02] get some little coloring books we had to
[1:14:04] keep the baby locked up a little
[1:14:05] three-year-old girl in the room all day

[1:14:51] would come across the street and they
[1:14:52] walked there with the lights and and I
[1:14:54] stood there for about 10 minutes and
[1:14:55] just kept standing there and after a
[1:14:58] while but whistle blows again the group
[1:14:59] of people cross the street just as busy
[1:15:01] as they could be and I noticed coming
[1:15:03] behind was a lady with a little
[1:15:05] checkered dress on she had on a little
[1:15:08] Canadian and she's carrying a pocketbook

[1:21:45] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:21:48] to God listen listen I got a couple of
[1:21:50] things I want to just kind of share here
[1:21:53] you know I'm going back to that same
[1:21:54] sermon I'm going to paragraph e 29th
[1:21:58] glory to God
[1:22:00] the day was expecting God to deliver him
[1:22:03] from the lion's den the Hebrew children
[1:22:06] when they went into the fire first they
[1:22:08] said o our God is able they was
[1:22:10] expecting God to deliver them and they
[1:22:13] made the last step of the way before he
[1:22:15] came but he all he's always there at the
[1:22:18] last end Jesus comes in the darkest of
[1:22:22] hours then Jesus comes along they was
[1:22:25] expecting it the woman with the blood
[1:22:29] issue was expecting if she could touch
[1:22:34] the hem of His garment it was over when
[1:22:36] she touched the hem of His garment her
[1:22:38] expectations were fulfilled if you come
[1:22:40] tonight or today expecting to be here
[1:22:43] you're going to be healed if you come
[1:22:45] expecting to find something to criticize
[1:22:46] the meeting you'll certainly find it you
[1:22:48] get what you come for
[1:22:49] that's right now we go back to look at
[1:22:52] the story here that we ran out of
[1:22:53] Matthew 9 a man that just blessed my
[1:22:56] heart you know just reading this because
[1:22:59] the scripture tells us Amen there in
[1:23:01] verse 27 praise the Lord Amen the
[1:23:05] scripture tells us says and when Jesus
[1:23:07] departed thence two blind men followed
[1:23:09] him crying to stand down son of David
[1:23:11] have mercy on us you know as I was
[1:23:14] reading that I say wait a minute how can
[1:23:17] blind men follow him we called our
[1:23:22] I can blind me and follow him right it's
[1:23:26] impossible for blind men to follow Jesus
[1:23:29] they can't see right and notice that
[1:23:34] especially when Jesus departed thence
[1:23:36] now what we need to understand is there
[1:23:39] were a couple things that happened
[1:23:40] before these blind men got hold of them
[1:23:41] one was that this is the ruler gyrus the
[1:23:46] ruler you know at the time he came
[1:23:48] seeking Jesus to come and bring healing
[1:23:51] to his door to that God right you see
[1:23:53] were seeking and as she was on sick she
[1:23:56] actually died and they come and tone
[1:23:58] saying I don't trouble the master your
[1:23:59] daughter's already dead you might as
[1:24:01] well just go ahead and accept reality
[1:24:03] right this was this encouragement from
[1:24:05] significant reality and just coming home
[1:24:07] and more and just don't trouble the
[1:24:09] master but as Jesus said no I'll go I'll
[1:24:11] go with you I'll go to your houses and
[1:24:13] as he's on the way to the demands house
[1:24:15] because of the crowd that's following
[1:24:17] there was a woman that have been also in
[1:24:20] a condition for 12 years and that woman
[1:24:22] say all know this is my opportunity and
[1:24:25] you got to see Church every time you
[1:24:27] come in it's an opportunity glory to God
[1:24:31] it's an opportunity for you to get
[1:24:33] something from God and then when the
[1:24:35] saints begin to gather in the atmosphere
[1:24:37] is being created it's an opportunity for
[1:24:40] me to get something right so that way
[1:24:42] they say no no no no I know he's not
[1:24:44] coming for me but I'll tell you what if
[1:24:45] I could just touch the hem of His
[1:24:47] garment I know I'll be Meho this
[1:24:49] condition that I've been suffering with
[1:24:51] for 12 years it'll be over my
[1:24:53] expectation says it will be over now if
[1:24:57] you know Scripture Jesus couldn't even
[1:24:59] go a pro turn because of the condition
[1:25:01] that she had I mean people can sit with
[1:25:04] her people can do that she couldn't even
[1:25:06] go to church with the condition that she
[1:25:07] had but it did not say she can approach
[1:25:09] him so she went and she touched for him
[1:25:13] his garment when she got that she turned
[1:25:15] and walked away in and she thought she
[1:25:17] got hers and she just I'm done but Jesus
[1:25:20] a who touched me when Jesus a who says
[1:25:23] they're not might not be the same out
[1:25:24] you know all these people touching you
[1:25:26] Jesus why would you say something like
[1:25:27] that who touch me you realize that
[1:25:29] everybody is touching it's like no but
[1:25:32] ain't nobody touched me the way that she
[1:25:33] touched me hallelujah
[1:25:36] when they say he's looked around the
[1:25:38] audience Candy's found to say okay
[1:25:40] sister what is it you know say your
[1:25:42] faces made your whole what is it that
[1:25:43] you know what what happens to he say she
[1:25:45] say I've been dealing with this
[1:25:46] condition for 12 years and you know and
[1:25:48] and and I and the doctors can help me
[1:25:50] but I told myself that if I could just
[1:25:52] touch the hem of your garment you don't
[1:25:54] need to touch me but if I touched you
[1:25:56] then I knew my situation would be sound
[1:25:59] and say oh that that's a what faith you
[1:26:02] say your faith has made you whole and
[1:26:03] the Bible say immediately I don't know
[1:26:07] about you but I'm looking for some
[1:26:09] immediate lesson sometimes God gives you
[1:26:14] immediate blessing sometimes you got to
[1:26:16] wait on some of others he encouraged
[1:26:18] your faith by giving it to you
[1:26:19] immediately and you might have one that
[1:26:22] you need right now it means me I'll tell
[1:26:26] her after when I by the time I leave
[1:26:27] Church that's the type of blessing I
[1:26:30] leave immediately and if you come with
[1:26:34] that type of expectation God will read
[1:26:36] it but Dyer said now I'm glad you got
[1:26:42] your blessing but I need to take the
[1:26:44] master home he already promised he'd
[1:26:45] come home with me and he got there
[1:26:47] raised that young girl adding up now
[1:26:49] before he raised her up he had to do
[1:26:51] something he had to kick everybody out
[1:26:52] that was that was in unbelief and a
[1:26:55] different people in your life Amen that
[1:26:57] speak a lot of negative stuff you're
[1:26:59] gonna have to get them out of your life
[1:27:00] give them the boot I'm sorry we can't
[1:27:03] talk no more every time I talk to you
[1:27:05] take my promise from me you have to hang
[1:27:09] up on them come on somebody for he is
[1:27:13] the Lord Amen they keep you defeated
[1:27:17] glory to God Amen Jesus had to do it
[1:27:21] y'all get out out I only want believers
[1:27:23] in here right now we got a real neat
[1:27:25] amen and when they got got the
[1:27:28] atmosphere just right then he did
[1:27:30] something in the atmosphere and that
[1:27:32] twelve year old girl came back alive
[1:27:34] hallelujah it's because of father and a
[1:27:37] mother had expectation that if we can
[1:27:39] get Jesus inside our house no matter
[1:27:42] what the condition is it's going to be
[1:27:44] taken care of
[1:27:45] well these blind men they don't heard
[1:27:48] about this woman being he
[1:27:49] they don't heard about gyrus daughter
[1:27:51] being raised from the dead and the Bible
[1:27:54] says when Jesus departed density coming
[1:27:56] out the house right two blind men
[1:27:58] followed now the reason that they can
[1:27:59] follow is because they can hear the
[1:28:01] commotion they can't see nothing but
[1:28:04] they can hear the commotion and their
[1:28:07] sense of hearing actually tells them
[1:28:09] something is happening so I can't see it
[1:28:11] I heard about him I can't see him I
[1:28:13] heard about it I need him to do
[1:28:14] something for me and I could just see
[1:28:16] him stumbling trying to find where Jesus
[1:28:19] is and maybe some y'all stumbling trying
[1:28:22] to find where Jesus did I can tell you
[1:28:25] where he is this morning he's helping
[1:28:27] the mr. Jeffrey glup
[1:28:34] I can see him just stumbling trying to
[1:28:37] find them maybe they asking people in
[1:28:39] the streets they where where you know
[1:28:40] what was here Jesus
[1:28:42] so where is where is we don't hurt about
[1:28:44] them healing blind people we gonna get
[1:28:46] our site today they have to make sure
[1:28:48] they got to the Prophet the Bible said
[1:28:51] they followed look at it and when Jesus
[1:28:54] departed this two blind men followed him
[1:28:55] crying and saying stop summoned David
[1:28:58] have mercy on you got to stay on the
[1:28:59] trail don't let it up don't let I mean
[1:29:01] and when God gave problems you stay on
[1:29:02] the trailer till you get your promise
[1:29:04] fulfilled
[1:29:04] go oh and when he and when he was come
[1:29:07] into the house the blind men came to him
[1:29:11] we're not letting you leave the city
[1:29:13] until we get our blessing listen and
[1:29:16] Jesus said unto them believe me that I'm
[1:29:19] able to do this they said to him Yale or
[1:29:23] Yale or yeah we believe we believe
[1:29:26] exactly that you're able to do and then
[1:29:28] he said then touch me there I say
[1:29:30] according to your faith you understand
[1:29:34] you can't go around actually nobody what
[1:29:36] you think is the promise for me or not
[1:29:38] for me it's according to your faith you
[1:29:43] think I'm going to bless me with this
[1:29:45] that I'm asking him for it's according
[1:29:46] to your faith it's your face it's not
[1:29:52] their friend Jesus have cording to your
[1:29:54] faith be it unto you and their eyes were
[1:29:59] open and Jesus straitly charged them
[1:30:01] saying see that no man Oh
[1:30:03] and verse 31 say but they when they were
[1:30:06] departed spread abroad his fame and all
[1:30:08] the country could not keep it today so
[1:30:10] had to go tell somebody else I got
[1:30:14] something this morning I can't keep to
[1:30:15] myself I'm have to tell somebody else
[1:30:18] let me keep going here just for a little
[1:30:20] bit longer see we have to learn the have
[1:30:24] to face that Abraham hat and let's reach
[1:30:29] this out of God's covenant with Abraham
[1:30:30] and his seed let's read a little
[1:30:32] something there my Lord Jesus hold on
[1:30:38] one second let me at this before I go
[1:30:42] there let me just just share a couple
[1:30:43] things here with you oh my so much I was
[1:30:48] reading you know I was telling you all
[1:30:50] just just recently how if you looking
[1:30:53] for God you find him in the midst of
[1:30:55] your priests when you're going through
[1:30:57] something you got to learn how to just
[1:30:59] just praise God in the middle of it I
[1:31:02] see the Word of God is the seed and when
[1:31:06] the feet come in and you receive that
[1:31:08] seat into your heart you've sleeve it on
[1:31:10] good ground into your heart when you get
[1:31:12] that now you have to give that seat
[1:31:15] water and if you want to see the word to
[1:31:19] grow if you want that promise to
[1:31:20] manifest now you have to give it water
[1:31:22] and what waters your personal see your
[1:31:25] revelation is your praises that that's
[1:31:29] what worship is all about right and I
[1:31:33] got sure I don't share with you many
[1:31:34] times the Bible say open you I mean
[1:31:36] that's one open your mouth wide now fill
[1:31:38] it but the other one say they came they
[1:31:40] came and they worship God with a loud
[1:31:42] voice right they loud was so so as you
[1:31:47] begin to worship God people don't know
[1:31:48] why you worshipping but you know why you
[1:31:50] were lord I thank you for that thing
[1:31:52] being for field I thank you for speaking
[1:31:54] to me today I thank you for everything
[1:31:57] that I need I got him you you you just
[1:31:59] begin to worship God it's reading this
[1:32:03] recently you know George Mueller was
[1:32:05] telling a story in this innocence of
[1:32:07] this book released the power of prayer
[1:32:08] this missionary had six children you
[1:32:11] know six boys and he had been praying
[1:32:13] for them boys he stay for many years and
[1:32:15] say just seemed like
[1:32:16] one of them boys would ever turn a heart
[1:32:18] towards the Lord so when the man start
[1:32:21] telling us condition of George Mueller
[1:32:22] he say he totally went to let me say his
[1:32:24] advice to the message they continue to
[1:32:26] pray for your sons as you pray for me
[1:32:29] say expect an answer cease not just pray
[1:32:34] for them but now you have to expect an
[1:32:35] answer and many of them prayed about
[1:32:37] things but we have not expected the
[1:32:39] answer right continue to pray for
[1:32:41] yourselves expect an answer to your
[1:32:44] prayers and you will have to praise God
[1:32:47] so three things you do keep RAM expect
[1:32:51] the answer and please God in the middle
[1:32:53] of it so when a master man say are the
[1:33:02] missionary here to see you know mr.
[1:33:03] Miller - six years later six years
[1:33:05] passes mr. Miller come through that city
[1:33:06] again and when he saw him again the
[1:33:08] second time he said now within two
[1:33:10] months of you telling me to take that
[1:33:12] advice within two months of taking the
[1:33:14] advice five of my six sons were
[1:33:16] converted and then we converted within
[1:33:19] eight days of each other imagine that
[1:33:22] right the man of entire years but all
[1:33:24] day was missing was the expectation and
[1:33:27] the worship and maybe that's what
[1:33:32] someone's missing the day some
[1:33:34] expectation and a little worship you
[1:33:38] know you have to praise God for it
[1:33:40] already being done one of these days we
[1:33:45] gonna give God a place where I let it
[1:33:47] being done we ain't waiting to see
[1:33:49] nothing then it's already been done
[1:33:54] you also been based on what you see what
[1:33:58] you see in the future as based on your
[1:34:01] expectation and you'll care fat rich
[1:34:03] thick my my mind John Lyon got what he
[1:34:09] expected he was praising God expected to
[1:34:12] be healed and why he was worshiping his
[1:34:14] eyes popped open
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:17] hey man why we working for one day this
[1:34:19] door gonna pop open and your loved ones
[1:34:21] going to come walking in and you're
[1:34:26] going to be already in a please before
[1:34:27] they got here
[1:34:28] so when they get here you're going to be
[1:34:29] tired hallelujah but you'll get some
[1:34:32] ministry you'll get a second way in
[1:34:39] since the man began to worship you know
[1:34:42] he said within two months of taking them
[1:34:44] by five of his six clubs were converted
[1:34:46] within eight days and those five or six
[1:34:49] four five or six boys had already been
[1:34:51] serving God for six years
[1:34:53] right by the time mr. Miller came back
[1:34:56] he said my boys two weeks after you left
[1:34:58] five of the six of them got converted
[1:34:59] and they've been serving out for six
[1:35:01] years since you left right it shows that
[1:35:04] God hears our prayers but our
[1:35:06] expectation
[1:35:07] aid man and you know and our worship has
[1:35:10] to be the same glory to God I just

[1:38:18] good a good sign that that the revival
[1:38:21] is going to break we don't have to have
[1:38:22] five hundred the altar week we just have
[1:38:24] to take God's word for and start
[1:38:26] rejoicing we don't have to have five
[1:38:29] hundred also we just have to take God's
[1:38:31] word for it and start rejoicing
[1:38:33] something will happen that brings the
[1:38:36] word to life as we water it with praises
[1:38:38] see that that brings the word to life as
[1:38:41] we water it with praises what makes a
[1:38:44] seed grow water water makes the Word of

[1:38:55] just going to have to continue to praise
[1:38:56] God amen and to that thing comes to pass
[1:38:58] he goes on to say when Jesus told him to
[1:39:00] wait in the upper room or the city of
[1:39:02] Jerusalem today was a do with power from
[1:39:03] behind that word fell on their ears they

[1:39:49] we've seen now I'm going to skip down in
[1:39:51] the same message to paragraph ether tea
[1:39:54] now this is a man that has some
[1:39:56] expectation since South Africa recently
[1:39:59] a man had
[1:40:01] who had never had a pair of shoes on his
[1:40:03] feet in his life been waved back in the
[1:40:07] jungles has born back there years ago by
[1:40:09] missionary parents he was born with
[1:40:12] deformed feet when they come walking up
[1:40:14] through there
[1:40:15] clubbing his feet alone he had a shoebox
[1:40:18] under his arm and someone said to him
[1:40:20] what you got in there he said a pair of
[1:40:23] shoes said what do you expect to do with
[1:40:26] them are they going to be your father's
[1:40:28] he said I'm going to wear them and when
[1:40:32] the service was over he had those shoes
[1:40:34] on running down through that lot just as
[1:40:37] hard as as he could go not a man came to
[1:40:41] church shipwrecked Simeon came in the
[1:40:43] spirit that man came in the spirit with
[1:40:46] a box of shoes they said well shoes that
[1:40:49] they they for me I'm leaving here
[1:40:51] walking I'm putting on these shoes maybe
[1:40:55] I don't know what his feet had to do in
[1:40:57] order to get inside them shoes but they
[1:40:58] did exactly what he expected search I
[1:41:03] tell you we got to come on expectation
[1:41:05] it says and when the service was over he
[1:41:07] had those shoes on running down through
[1:41:10] that lot just as hard as he could go
[1:41:12] praising God what did he do he took on
[1:41:14] at his word he had so much when he was
[1:41:16] asked he said I've seen others coming
[1:41:19] that was crippled it was healed and I've
[1:41:21] seen those who were blind to see again
[1:41:23] and God would not God would not turn me
[1:41:26] down that's the way to believe that God
[1:41:28] won't turn me down oh I thank God for
[1:41:34] that
[1:41:35] hallelujah you know there was a another
[1:41:39] little testimony where if you know the
[1:41:43] prophets talk about how this man was he
[1:41:45] was at home he was blind and he'd been
[1:41:48] blind for about ten years and there he
[1:41:50] was just you know under expectation and
[1:41:53] what God did for him he sent his mother
[1:41:55] to him his mother passed away and he
[1:41:57] sent the mama to him in a dream and the
[1:41:59] mama told us saying I go down to
[1:42:01] such-and-such city in a dream went good
[1:42:03] I'm such a city look for a man by the
[1:42:05] name of Branham he's going to pray for

[1:42:50] expectations don't let the devil take
[1:42:53] that from you you get what you expect
[1:42:57] can we look at Abraham just for a second
[1:43:03] here this is out of a the sermon God's
[1:43:07] covenant with Abraham and his seed
[1:43:10] so notice them when he got the promise
[1:43:13] the Bible said in Romans 4 that Abraham
[1:43:15] was strong in faith giving praise to God
[1:43:19] see that's the thing you got you got to
[1:43:21] be giving praise to God before even
[1:43:23] happen you got the phrasing
[1:43:24] so Abraham was strong in faith giving
[1:43:27] praise to God I can hear him go back and
[1:43:29] say Sarah I just talked to God and he
[1:43:32] told us we was going to have a baby and
[1:43:34] the first thing we ought to do is go
[1:43:37] down and get some bird eye and some pens
[1:43:39] and get everything ready because the
[1:43:41] baby's coming the Lord said so that's
[1:43:44] the way to believe it that's the way to
[1:43:46] believe it believe that's the way to
[1:43:49] believe every man that says if a person
[1:43:50] is sick like this lady like this sick
[1:43:53] lady here how do we sister take my pill
[1:43:55] over there God said so if I could
[1:43:57] believe it and I do believe that I'll be
[1:43:59] healed make ready for it so that if God
[1:44:04] spoke something to you amen and you got
[1:44:07] a promise it hasn't happened yet but
[1:44:09] what you need to do if you notice the
[1:44:10] promise that God gave you now make ready
[1:44:12] for it
[1:44:13] I just love brother gene testimony
[1:44:17] brother gene he was here Friday night

[1:45:16] for they man get everything ready gets
[1:45:18] that when time comes you're going to
[1:45:20] receive it God said so now just just
[1:45:23] real quick before I go into just Abraham
[1:45:26] I want you to understand something this
[1:45:30] was out of the message the ark but
[1:45:33] around say there's three elements that
[1:45:35] people live in three elements first is
[1:45:39] the humanistic right first is the
[1:45:41] humanistic second is divine revelation
[1:45:44] and then third is vision but these are
[1:45:47] three elements that we live in
[1:45:48] humanistic divine revelation and vision
[1:45:52] so now this like in prayer when you pray
[1:45:55] for anyone and humanistic we say well I
[1:45:58] hope you'll get well so that's your
[1:46:01] human side I hope you get well see says
[1:46:04] i'll see i'm hoping i'm believing with
[1:46:06] you try to use all the faith that I can
[1:46:10] that's human
[1:46:11] right the second divine revelation when
[1:46:15] something's reveal to you you know where
[1:46:19] your heart is going to happen yet
[1:46:21] there's nothing but just a revelation
[1:46:23] now I remember you know sister Wesco
[1:46:26] going through that the doctor that come
[1:46:28] and told say y'all better get ready your
[1:46:30] mama is going to die and since the
[1:46:32] Westco she had a revelation
[1:46:34] sister-in-law God ain't told me that
[1:46:35] I've got a say by stripes she's healing
[1:46:38] our darling told me she gonna die and
[1:46:39] she stood on her
[1:46:41] relations that God gave her even though
[1:46:42] the rest of the family now you need to
[1:46:44] just get you know with the program the
[1:46:46] doctors say Mama's on the dial you might
[1:46:48] come on you know stop this sitting on
[1:46:49] the ligado until me and she was standing
[1:46:51] on her own revelation then I'm mama live
[1:46:53] for 13 more years because she stood on
[1:46:56] her revelation brother Branham when you
[1:46:59] know when he was just reading the Bible
[1:47:01] about Joseph's reasons the life story
[1:47:04] just haven't got to say you know you're
[1:47:05] gonna have a son named Joseph and I hear
[1:47:08] hear hear he waiting on Joseph all he
[1:47:10] had was a revelation and he went and his
[1:47:12] wife got pregnant and with which she got
[1:47:14] pregnant she brought forth her daughter
[1:47:15] and everybody start criticizing not as
[1:47:17] you said you must amend Josephine not
[1:47:19] Joseph right everybody start Christmas
[1:47:22] he says they know God told me I have a
[1:47:23] Joseph I don't know what I'm able to go
[1:47:25] through but I might have a Joseph where
[1:47:27] his wife got pregnant again and at this
[1:47:29] time the doctor said you better not let
[1:47:30] her go through this pregnancy because
[1:47:32] she might lose her life we say doc I
[1:47:34] don't know what's gonna happen to my
[1:47:36] wife but I know God told me I'm gonna
[1:47:38] have it Joseph all he had was a divine
[1:47:40] revelation but with that divine
[1:47:43] revelation Joseph king and his wife was
[1:47:46] spared you don't have to stand on your
[1:47:48] own personal divine revelation that goes
[1:47:53] beyond hope that's when and when like
[1:47:56] God spoke to Simeon God will speak to
[1:47:58] you listen second is divine revelation
[1:48:03] when something's real to you you know
[1:48:04] you just know your heart it's going to
[1:48:06] happen
[1:48:07] yet there's nothing but the revelation
[1:48:10] and that's all it needs to be is the
[1:48:12] revelation and third is a vision of
[1:48:15] course that's the stay at the Lord
[1:48:17] that's perfect and positive because a
[1:48:19] vision a man even a dream God can give
[1:48:22] you a dream but a dream when it's
[1:48:23] correctly interpreted is a vision when
[1:48:25] you get a vision from God to know that's
[1:48:26] exactly the way it's going to come to
[1:48:28] pass in church we got we got we if we
[1:48:32] don't if we don't have the vision but we
[1:48:33] got a revelation stand on that
[1:48:35] revelation don't let nothing shake you
[1:48:36] keep your expectation there were seven
[1:48:39] keys to Abraham receiving his promise
[1:48:41] seven keys to his victory you find it in
[1:48:44] Romans 4 verse 16 through 25 I won't
[1:48:47] read it all but I'll just I'll just
[1:48:49] share these things that I saw there
[1:48:52] verse 18 and Romans 4
[1:48:55] he was against hope but but he still
[1:48:57] believed in hope and and I looked up
[1:49:00] that word hope I got this little book
[1:49:02] that sister Michelle gave me years ago
[1:49:05] called keys to the Bible and I looked
[1:49:08] that up it says hope is defined as
[1:49:09] expectation of a future good so when
[1:49:14] you're against expectation believe in
[1:49:16] expectation hmm the hope is defined as
[1:49:22] an expectation of a future good so the
[1:49:24] Bible say that he was against hope but
[1:49:26] still believed in hope right the second
[1:49:29] things that he was not weak in faith now
[1:49:31] I want to just drop in and I said this
[1:49:33] earlier when were you looking at this
[1:49:36] for Paul to write these things about
[1:49:39] Abraham we know Abraham got with Hagar
[1:49:42] we know that right and so when when
[1:49:46] Abraham got a Hagar it was show that he
[1:49:48] was weak in faith everything that he was
[1:49:50] doing to try to help the promise was it
[1:49:52] showed that he was weak in faith but
[1:49:54] here's the thing about this I started
[1:49:56] looking at this from a different angle
[1:49:57] Amen as I was reading the scripture this
[1:49:59] morning because I'm saying in Romans 4
[1:50:01] that he was now about a hundred years
[1:50:03] old now when he had Ishmael he was 80
[1:50:07] something years old but he didn't have
[1:50:09] Isaac until he was about a hundred years
[1:50:11] old it showed that there was a time of
[1:50:13] progression it showed that there was a
[1:50:16] time of maturity in Abraham's faith so
[1:50:19] God we're looking at the mistake that
[1:50:21] happened with Ishmael King God was
[1:50:23] looking at perfection when I became
[1:50:25] we've made some mistakes along the way
[1:50:27] but we also go through a time of
[1:50:29] maturity and god of looking other mature
[1:50:33] Christians now and it's not holding your
[1:50:36] mistakes to your account so in fact God
[1:50:42] this was our God describes and he's
[1:50:43] looking at the finished product he
[1:50:45] looking for that point A to point B to
[1:50:47] tell his not what happens in between man
[1:50:50] look at this it's a the first thing he
[1:50:52] was against hope but he still believed
[1:50:53] the who second he was not weak in faith
[1:50:56] this is God describing him at the end of
[1:50:58] the trial oh my god my god
[1:51:01] up he considered not his own body which
[1:51:04] was now dead the other thing he did he
[1:51:07] can say
[1:51:07] my set the deadness of Sarah's room
[1:51:10] verse I mean number four amen in verse
[1:51:13] 20 he staggered not at the promise to
[1:51:16] run belief now you got to get in your
[1:51:17] mind he's not talking about when he was
[1:51:19] 80 something he's talking about when he
[1:51:21] was a hundred all right he talked about
[1:51:25] when he mature he staggered not at the
[1:51:28] promise he weren't going to get no Mohan
[1:51:30] Lee's right Amen that that is done and
[1:51:34] go I made a mistake now I'm not
[1:51:36] repeating that again
[1:51:37] glory to God I'm keeping my expectation
[1:51:40] the other thing here he says this it
[1:51:42] says he second out the promise of
[1:51:45] Opteron believe number five he was
[1:51:47] strong in faith number six he was giving
[1:51:51] glory to God that means he was watering
[1:51:53] his seed of promise with his praises and
[1:51:57] number seven he was fully persuaded that
[1:51:59] what God promised him he was able to
[1:52:02] perform anybody here fully persuaded
[1:52:05] what God promised you he's able to
[1:52:07] perform i'ma tell you just I'm gonna
[1:52:11] tell him myself this morning I'm going
[1:52:13] to tell him myself this morning
[1:52:15] I was I was this sermon I've had this
[1:52:18] for a few weeks and I got to the point
[1:52:21] where I said you know i'ma wait for a
[1:52:24] certain thing to happen and then i'ma
[1:52:27] preached a sermon then I got rebuked
[1:52:30] because that's not what Abraham did
[1:52:32] Abraham then wait first either to come
[1:52:36] before we start telling everybody about
[1:52:38] Isaac Abraham was testifying about Isaac
[1:52:41] before Isaac came so as the seed of
[1:52:44] Abraham I'm gonna testify before it
[1:52:47] happens you want to know why I'm testify
[1:52:50] because my expectation I got a show me
[1:52:56] I really strongly believe that that's
[1:53:02] something that something good is in my
[1:53:04] future Anna you know I had a little
[1:53:08] situation come up here recently and I
[1:53:10] was uh man I I knew I had to pay some

[2:07:19] apartments and things that nature and I
[2:07:20] watched god bless him with that first
[2:07:22] house and when he moved into the house
[2:07:24] say that the the people the mortgage
[2:07:26] people's call them saying
[2:07:28] learn that we can do anything that we
[2:07:29] can do but let's go say well you keep

[2:07:37] numbers trying to find somebody take
[2:07:39] them off I'm gonna keep doing what I do
[2:07:40] what you do I pray and as he pray and
[2:07:44] his friend in Danny was reading
[2:07:45] scripture and proverbs in the Bible said
[2:07:47] the heart of the king is in in the
[2:07:51] Lord's hands right and when he when
[2:07:53] inside that scripture said not just the
[2:07:54] heart of the king the heart of the
[2:07:56] mortgage Linda is in God's hands
[2:07:58] and he held on to that and he will let
[2:08:01] he had bulldog faith will let it go and
[2:08:04] you know what he moved into the house
[2:08:09] then I remember walking into the house
[2:08:11] for the first time I walked through
[2:08:13] every room I didn't look that it just
[2:08:16] pays to serve God I say it pay to serve
[2:08:20] God but God God did the exceedingly
[2:08:23] abundant ask a thing that was the first
[2:08:25] house God wasn't finish it
[2:08:29] then put him in the house whole family
[2:08:31] that moved out and everything and here

[2:08:35] sister let's go with a pool that God
[2:08:40] wants you to enjoy your blessings he had
[2:08:47] two houses at one time that's what God
[2:08:50] does
[2:08:51] I don't tell me what it can't do they
[2:08:54] say I remember when brother brother
[2:08:55] let's go he's the sheriff testimony
[2:08:57] about going full-time of ministry he
[2:08:59] used to tell it to us all the time I

[2:09:11] do appreciate the ministry but I
[2:09:13] couldn't see it but when God turned the
[2:09:16] tables on me see I got bored off face to
[2:09:19] my faith is a little different when God
[2:09:21] gave me something I won't turn it loose
[2:09:23] he gave me a job I won't let it go I
[2:09:26] don't they can be taking me through all
[2:09:28] kind of stuff I want gently
[2:09:31] you know they got to kick me out of
[2:09:34] there they have to sit down I have
[2:09:36] meetings with me we don't I lead out on
[2:09:47] my feelers and everything because of my
[2:09:49] brother cocaine but but God make us all
[2:09:56] different like that but I can tell you
[2:09:58] this much since seven months ago since I
[2:10:01] left and I said I was forced out God has
[2:10:06] provided God has provided and I'm
[2:10:11] grateful to God for providing oh my
[2:10:14] Jesus my god I know he's a real God
[2:10:18] faithful God he's not a God I'm just
[2:10:21] read about him a book somewhere but he's
[2:10:23] the same yesterday today and forever he
[2:10:26] still provides if you're just trusting
[2:10:28] you'll do what he asks you to do I
[2:10:30] guarantee he will not let you down I
[2:10:38] never seen a blessing like that just the
[2:10:41] way I just saw it I ain't never
[2:10:43] experienced that later but when you walk
[2:10:44] in my faith and not by sight living
[2:10:47] under expectation now I go every day I'm
[2:10:50] looking in the mailbox I'm waiting on
[2:10:51] the next one huh it ain't coming today
[2:10:53] tomorrow be him and if it ain't in the
[2:10:56] mailboxes be in my hand somebody's come
[2:10:58] shook my hand and so I I don't know I
[2:10:59] was gonna get it but God that showed me
[2:11:02] that he's on my side so I'm just I'm
[2:11:08] just crazy enough to believe anything
[2:11:10] now I'm I'm becoming just like my
[2:11:13] spiritual father I'm becoming just like
[2:11:16] I'm too crazy I believe it I just made
[2:11:19] man incredible God does incredible
[2:11:23] things even that's incredible well going
[2:11:28] i'ma preach that one day that's
[2:11:29] incredible glory to God all right let me
[2:11:34] let me go on a man lord I thank you
[2:11:38] since we He healed all and so forth that
[2:11:43] seeing the power got here
[2:11:44] here it go for ignoring this for
[2:11:46] everyone and you walk out and say well I
[2:11:48] feel just as bad as I did when I went in
[2:11:50] he couldn't do a thing for you you say
[2:11:53] well I accept it now and then in the
[2:11:55] morning you get up and say well I still
[2:11:57] got that headache I still feel as bad as
[2:11:59] I did then you drop right down you'll
[2:12:02] never live above your confession
[2:12:05] let the saintly person in the building
[2:12:08] right now just make up in your mind that
[2:12:10] you're not a Christian anymore that's
[2:12:13] when you become not a Christian see when
[2:12:16] you go out to say are you a Christian
[2:12:18] no I used to be but I'm not no more
[2:12:20] you're falling from grace right then see
[2:12:24] it's faith see it's either faith or
[2:12:26] unbelief you're possessed with those two
[2:12:30] powers which one dominates you I have a
[2:12:34] faith or unbelief if you got faith
[2:12:37] you're saved because you are a believer
[2:12:39] if you haven't got faith you're a sinner
[2:12:43] so Church let faith dominate your life
[2:12:45] because you don't be possessed of one or
[2:12:48] the other and I'm gonna tell you you're
[2:12:49] going to get what you expect the devil
[2:12:51] going to bring it to you or God don't
[2:12:52] get it to you but I'm just choose to
[2:12:56] serve God choose to believe God receive
[2:12:59] that all God has for me I'm tired of
[2:13:00] living beneath my privileges and I'm
[2:13:02] it's time for me to tap in some of these
[2:13:04] untapped resources amen I'm tap it in I
[2:13:08] just experienced one of them I got this
[2:13:10] more where that come from the man that
[2:13:13] ate the watermelon brother brother
[2:13:15] random you know if it's a the brother
[2:13:17] ate the watermelon it was actually did
[2:13:19] you enjoy this it yeah I enjoyed that
[2:13:21] watermelon but it's more where that come
[2:13:23] from so I need another piece of action
[2:13:26] and when God bless you one time like wow
[2:13:29] is more where that come from
[2:13:30] I need I need some more that's hardly
[2:13:33] the man I'm gonna tell you another thing
[2:13:35] sometimes what happens that he has needs
[2:13:38] that arise in your life and that need is
[2:13:41] to draw you closer to him because
[2:13:43] oftentimes when we get a little bit too
[2:13:44] ahead of ourselves we get too blessed we
[2:13:48] forget where it came from
[2:13:51] and that's another sermon to bless you
[2:13:58] can tell what somebody to bless they
[2:14:00] start missing church remember the truth
[2:14:03] they listen they got a car usually when
[2:14:06] they were walking to catching the bus
[2:14:07] they catch it you used to met church all
[2:14:09] the time when they get to blast they
[2:14:11] stopped making excuses all right God
[2:14:15] know how to just humble you right back
[2:14:16] down and help you get your priorities
[2:14:21] the car was up you get to church not the
[2:14:26] work the car was for church all right
[2:14:29] for you to help pick up people brain in
[2:14:32] the church what was something else that
[2:14:35] you did but the cause for you to bring
[2:14:37] people to church so people in all broke
[2:14:39] down on the side road of trying to go to
[2:14:41] church that's why you got the car all
[2:14:43] right all right let's pray y'all
