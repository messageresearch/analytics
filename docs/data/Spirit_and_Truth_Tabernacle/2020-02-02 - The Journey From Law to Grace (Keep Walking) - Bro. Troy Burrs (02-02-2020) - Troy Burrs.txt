lives a man he has equipped us for this hour they may understand an age when wickedness is at its peak a man but he gave us something he gave us his own life law that we can withstand in his own praise Lord sister Rachel ss you I did not come to church planning to sing brother Solomon asked me to sing this song and I think it's very fitting with sister Rebecca's special because you have to think of who coined that phrase in a way I know my redeemer lives and what Joe was going through he was going through the very worst time of his life and still he was able to look up through all of it and say I know my redeemer lives and I think it's so important for us to understand that even through hardships God God got our back and everything is gonna be ok so pray for me [Music] you [Music] I used to be so broken first empty with no meat a singer with no soul to see [Music] so I know fulfilling silence is deafening but in your pain lies sweeter sound the victory so keep walking and walking and walking no it's Itza [Music] [Music] but you must be me but it gets better [Music] right [Music] it's hot and you must believe [Music] and your haunts me [Applause] so what are you having it [Music] [Music] [Music] but you must believe but it gets bad [Music] it's alright right [Music] but you must believe [Music] almost starting here I was almost going jeez [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] but you must believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] try the prayer to design in the bread No [Music] my but it gets bad [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] you know how many times I've shown this but this time it's more personal ever I was ready to give up the only people I told were my cousins that's it I was ready to go and every night I'd lay down and I'd prayed and Stephen sue and I'd say God let this be the last night I just can't do this let this be it I can't anymore some nights I just wanted to get in the car and drive and you you all look and you say oh you look at people and we all look at each other and say we all got it together but we don't sometimes we really don't it's just comforting to know that there's a God that does there's a common so when I say I was almost out of here I was almost gone and I wanted to die from how I was that's real and I know I'm not the only one that feels like that the devil wants us all to feel like that because if he can make us feel like that he's got us but I'm here [Music] [Applause] [Music] not even I could take me out not even you know Jesus looked at Pilate and said I have the power to lay my life down and pick my life up I thought I had that power but I didn't I tried but I couldn't cuz God's got so much more for me to do he's got so much more my flaws in my trials all that stuff it doesn't matter to me and it doesn't matter to God cuz at the end of the day it gets better and I know he's got so much for me to do so look at yourself and say it's [Music] no matter what you're going through it gets better hold your head up and look the devil in the eye and let him know it gets better I don't know it gets better see you miss this time you miss this time you can't take my life you can't take my life you can't take my life you can't take my life you can't take my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right try your ride Cinda breath it's hot but it's alright dry your eyes in the prayer all right rewrites in the brain it's hot but you must believe that it gets bad [Music] [Music] praise Allah hallelujah there's no reason to get better all things are working together for your good [Music] praise the Lord praise alone [Music] you know God has a plan for your life but Satan has a plan for your life also what Satan does is called divide and conquer he loves to make you feel like you're all alone when he gets you the filler all alone he gets to plan with your mind then he brings own depression once he brings own depression he brings only suicidal thoughts after he brings home Souter the suicidal thoughts he calls you to take your life Jesus Christ came that you might live and live more abundantly but Satan call came to cause you to die that's his purpose so when you get along like that and you start to feel down you feel that spirit of depression coming upon you because that is a devil just anointing you when you feel that devil coming on trying to anoint you and get you the press put only him pick up your Bible start reading it word call her brothers sister get the print get the praying getting that devil class offer he wants to defeat you he

can reveal this word to our hearts may we all just get into the spirit of the great composer Lord and you direct us Lord blessed heroes of this world Lord God the Lord God hide me behind the cross that only you be seen Jesus precious name Amen amen if you could grab your Bibles this morning you don't from Genesis now let's take Hebrews the 13th I'm sorry Hebrews a tenth chapter we'll start there a man thank you Lord Jesus Hebrews 10 chapter amen and reads for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into this world he says sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body has now prepared for me amen a burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has had no pleasure then said i lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will amen Genesis first chapter amen the 11 verse Genesis first chapter the eleventh verse and God said let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind and the God and God saw that and it was good well all we ask you to bless these scriptures Lord God just have your wait Lord God bless the heroes or father God and Jesus precious name I pray man you may be seated a man this morning Amen I'm going to take for a a title thank you brother felon or I swivel I said let me go on and give himself a night amen this morning I'm going to take for a title the journey from law to grace the journey from law to grace and for an inspiration or subtext amen I'm gonna say keep walking amen keep walking we know Amen that it was taught to us that the spoken word of God is the original seed in a beginning Amen we start there in Genesis because we understand that Genesis is the seed chapter God spoke let there be let there be let there be and there was a man his word a man his spoken word a man was the see that produced everything we see the world was framed by the Word of God Amen now now if you notice God said let it bring forth of its kind whatever it was it must bring forth of its kind amen that is a lot everything in nature is governed by in law amen God is not a fireable person he's not like men we can have a good idea one day and have a better idea tomorrow we can come up with something and we can improve on what our thought was or what our idea was just by maybe it's studying a little bit more or looking into it a little bit more but God is God his first thought is his best oh and his only thought his first way is his only way it is perfect so when he established in Genesis and he said he went through and he framing earth and he set everything in order and man that was the way it was everything was established the law by the Word of God amen now we see in the Prophet said in the message restoration of the bride tree that we see the fish have a law the fish amen he has a law he can he can live the water I would like to see you try to do it because that law is not in you there's a law of the birds a man that he can he's an earthbound creature but he can lift his wings a certain way and so in the heavenlies amen his whole entire makeup was designed in order for him to carry out that law amen he has the ability in him to defy gravity amen that was the way God made him amen he has a law a man that he could fly man try to copy it and sometimes we don't quite succeed amen but uh we see a man just like I said but gravity is a law so everything in nature everything is controlled by a law it has the goal a certain way in order to get to a certain place that's just the law of God amen the law of Christ the law of man is you can bury him amen in the deepest grave and in the deepest sea and in the lowest hail the law of the Spirit of God is that he'll raise the game Bible says if that same spirit dwells in you that it will quicken your mortal body amen to raise from the grave but amen we see that in the beginning the Prophet was talking about there in the message why some people can't keep victory and he was talking about in there he said the holy spirit any man when the earth was void and without for a man that was see laying there because God's spoken word is a scene so we don't know when he said let there be and let there be the manifestation of what he said didn't appear right away but the seed was there and in that scene was the potential amen for it to manifest itself it's appointed time hey man everything was set in order it had to be placed in its right condition and then everything had to go according to his perfect timepiece a man if something would have came out of order it would have threw everything in the chaos that is a trick of the devil to try and get us to move ahead of God that's the mistake that Eve me she moved ahead of God and and God was going to give them a child it was going to happen his way and in his time but Eve got a little excited and she didn't wait oh God she went another way and see she defied the look amen how you wit me I want you to see here the prophets say it the Holy Spirit came down when the earth was formed without forward and brood and cooling over the earth in another place he said that the Holy Spirit and the earth got to know one another read between the lines he said and it brought forth it was the German ization of the seed that was already laying there amen and he said that out of the dust came to burn and all of a sudden out of the dust came the Beast what was it that seed that was laying there coming into manifestation he said that dust came in a man after his image and after his likeness a man you wonder how Satan got in brother Solomon and I were having a little conversation about this and a real wonderful conversation maybe we say say everything that uh he said at the beginning say this was good this was good and this was good and this was good but there was one thing that came not quite the same way it was a byproduct and saved and say oh there's my door I can get in right there hey man little bitty no God had already made preparation hey man he had already thought knew see that this would happen and he said well I'm gonna make preparation before the foundation of the earth I'm gonna make temperature now to redeem man are you with me amen so we see him in the message Christ the mystery God revealed I'm sorry sirs will we see Jesus now when in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the world was God now what is the word the word is a thought expressed and made manifest then before God did anything he thought it and when he drew the plane in his mind and then expressed it by the word he could never take it back it had to be forever be that way it can't fail it can't change because God is infinite he's omnipresent he's omnipotent and infinite surge that serves what we see Jesus 5701 Oh for I thought I wrote it down this system amen let me go on if he was if he's infinite if he only present an impotent he is if he wasn't this way then he isn't God and if he is infinite at the beginning before the world was ever form he knew the end from the beginning he knew every flea he knew every fly he knew everything that he knew every person everything that would ever happen he knew just exactly what it was before the world began he's infinite so he by being that way could predestinate or for all day even for the wrath of his enemies to praise him even for the rest of his enemies to praise Him amen now we see we see that we were a thought in the mind of God so we were in a place any man that's a wonderful place to be in in God's thoughts in his mind but then when he came in and the seed farm in Genesis and we when we were day in a perfect place but what happened we fell from grace is that right now when man fell from grace his nature changed amen you're born in sin shaded in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies and there's not one good sound part about anybody so who are you anyhow who are you anyhow what are you you are about 84 cents of dirt that's all about 84 good singer a man however you have a soul that's worth 10,000 words God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth him can have eternal life God could not change his law law required a penalty a man in that penalty was death law required judgment amen the 12th chapter of st. John the 17th verse 8 verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it brings forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hated his life I want you to prepare attention today he hated his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal amen I heard the testimony this morning of the sister was saying that she felt like a man just giving up a man that's a good place to be to give up to your own will give up to your own way and man I just let God take complete control Amen sometime God allow us to get to that position to call on his name Amen we look at the children of Israel they they want found themselves Amen in a journey that they went to Joseph there was a famine in the land God had made preparation for their salvation and you give me some water brother God had made preparation for their salvation there under Joseph a man but before I go into that story I want you to see in the message Melchizedek the Prophet said this he says now see here plainly that the complete secret of our lives in journey and death is where we go after we die where we go out to be done amen thank you there there are stages to your eternal purpose he had in his secret now has been revealed did you catch what I'm saying let me let me let me back up and I might have put some thanks too close together there are stages to your eternal purpose this was a secret that is now revealed that is now revealed amen there are three stages a man that we must that we must go through now in that same message with no further on in the in the in the text F the Prophet said now Abraham's journey he met God along the way in different forms and so forth which he could take it and show it just we are Abraham see if we're in Christ so he stopped that he says Isaac was his lesser son he was his son sexuality bisexually but spiritually Christ was Abraham see his royal see his faith now we find that his royal seat it is travels the same journey his Bride of Christ travels the same journey and I want to speak to you this morning that we must travel the same journey a man bear with me you must travel the same journey a man as the sister song the song just keep walking amen other problem is in order to keep walking you have to start walking a man so now during the time of Joseph we see the church original has failed some grace and when their roles of Pharaoh that knew not Joseph what happened they went through four hundred years of dark ages they made four hundred years of trouble a man but you see God had promised them a land that was floor with milk and honey what happened to the children of Israel they found themselves in a good place there there was plenty of food to eat amen Joseph or was a store doctor the granite stumbles down with all with the grain in and everywhere else was in family I'm not you know what they was living pretty good the Egyptians gave them jobs they had good jobs they was working a man and everything was good it was in a good place step probably you know had you know come home every night to a warm meal and things of that nature it started off it was pretty good but see God had told them promised him a land that was flowing with milk and honey Egypt one memory but they like the cat hold my god they like the cares and comfortable with the riches of Egypt they got comfortable with the provisions that was in Egypt they forget all about they they were supposed to be looking for a city like their father Abraham they stayed during Egypt and see God had to let some things go a little salad some time when when when your a job just I had a situation like that my wife can attest I was comfortable on my job but slowly and surely I would come home oh I got the best job in the world oh we had another pot look all these people so nice when my father-in-law passed they took it offering in the office to give to my wife I said I mean and things was just going great but all of a sudden they brought in another supervisor they rolled the Pharaoh who do not chose oh here we go things started changing and started changing and so you know being a kind of person I am I can yeah I'm good work out tough guy get through this little did I know to know God was trying to tell me something get me it's time to move but I was comfortable a man the project was saying how precious lot chose the the bright lights inside and they got down there and they got comfortable hey man if Locke had his day of grace when those angels came down and say light you gotta go it's time to get out of here this thing is fitting to be destroyed the ceiling has reached it now he's finished let's go well I've had a choice to me if his heart was still dancing oh I'm good here he would have perished but he chose to follow the leading of the Lord through an angel a man that came to him amen and so that's to go it's time you can't wait any longer grab your children grab your wife let's go it's time to move on it's time to move on Amen I believe that's where we're at today you can certainly draw a comparison but we see the children vigilant got comfortable leaving Japan and things that slowly got worse and they and they had to go through some persecution but uh we see when things like that come in our lives as long as everything is good we're comfortable we won't pray hey man we won't seek the Lord amen we begin to put our trust in man we begin to put our trust in our paychecks when we're supposed to put our trust in God but God had to make things uncomfortable mm amen and along there come a baby born named Moses and then what was that my brothers and sisters God was making preparations God was making preparation you see when a baby is born when a baby is born its mother and its father make preparation for that baby's arrival amen they go out and buy a crib they maybe prepare a room my wife had a whole room full of Pampers already just turned up from the floor to the ceiling we got to never buy no fan for all to eat bamboo so we made preparation and see that's what was happening here there God that we're getting ready to move God was making preparation amen for them to take a journey he was preparing things while they was going through but see he let him go through two things had to happen one Moses had to come to a place of maturity because he we like she came lead ourselves he had to come to a place to where he was ready to lead people out and made but all along God was he had this going over here and over here to you that the children of either died in Goshen he had to wait until they got desperate they had to get desperate he see because before they was living so good they went praying but see after things got so difficult than me lives the things got so rough in the live then beginning the crowd to God send in the delivery Lord he's not gonna move until you crowd until you ask for amen but all alone he's making preparations he's making preparation a man for you on that journey so we see amen the children of Israel mine Moses was ready raised in the house of Pharaoh and educated in the finest schools and we see it took him 40 years on the desert amen to get all of that paint out of him amen to a place where he could leave a man the message there was a question and answer the prophets saying cranium is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world and they come out of the wilderness is where they were sanctified called out church can is where they settle down with the Holy Spirit cause they still had wars if you don't believe it you just if you don't believe it you have Wars just get the holy spirit once amen we can attest to that they still had wars so know what we getting is even after you get the Holy Spirit amen you're gonna have to fight I heard a preacher say one thing about a Christian a man you better learn to fight and enjoy it because you are gonna fight until you get out of here amen because the devil is not gonna give up but you know what he ain't nothing but a palmer worm that's all he ain't nothing but a pommel worm amen so in the message of paradox 1965 a man Joshua here the Prophet said Joshua here's a book actually of the book of redemption of the Old Testament Joshua we would have to consider it to be a and the Old Testament the book of redemption because this redemption have two parts amen Redemption anywhere has two parts that is coming out of and going into it takes two parts to make redemption out of and into Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and whereas Joshua represented grace that took them into the Promised Land another way was love and grace were two different aspects of God's command amen now the law brought them out Moses and Joshua took them in it also represents something for our day now it represents as they were in the journey coming from Egypt into the Promised Land so have we come out of the world a man a vision of chaos on our road to the promised land in my father's house there are many mansions if it was not so I would have told you coming out of going into it's law that bring us to recognize that we're wrong but it's grace that forgives us the law has no hope of redemption because our aunts who completed it it has no grace in it because lo only points this to the two that you are a sinner but grace tells you how to get out of it law is the policeman that puts you in jail but redemption is the one who come and paid your fine to out they paid your fine and out of and into and integrase so I want you to understand my brothers and sisters you don't just have grace grace is there waiting for you to claim it grace is there you have to come through the law you have to recognize the law to get to grace amen my god grace is there but you have to clean your grace if you reject your day of grace there's nothing left but judgment if not had it rejected his day of grace there was nothing left for judgment there's another fella in the Bible a man we know him as a young ruler for wealthy rich young ruler his day of grace had came to him Jesus say it to him sell all you have give to the poor and come follow me come take this journey with me come and take I'm the law my word is law come follow me to grace he rejected grace and found judgment amen you have to accept grace when it comes to you he is not obligated to keep him but his grace and his love will keep coming and give you chance after chance after chance after chance I heard a preacher once said that you have to fight to go to hate you have to grace comes to you by the law of the word and it's up to you to continue to fight with the law no I don't want it no I don't want grace is sitting there Christ God is ordering he's making preparation through your trials and tribulations and things that you're going through he's pushing you integrate pushing you into this direction he allowed things that get difficult in your life so that you were recognized that grace is right over there but you say no I don't want it why because I may have to give up my friends I may have to give up the fellowship that I have with the people that I currently associate with my god and you rejected and rejected instead of yielding a man we see the law Amen of that scene that scene outside of the right condition outside of it it's the desert and man has a hard shell amen in other words it has a stony heart amen it has to go into the ground amen and under the right condition so the children of Israel for 400 years any man they was in the right condition a man that they could pray amen to find God they say what a lot we know that this is no way to live they begin to cry out to God what God had to put them in that position what he had to put them into a place of struggle amen he had to bury them in Egypt amen and then calls amen the water day amen so touch each other knowing that see that hard shell had to break in order see the life it's in the sea amen sometimes we plant seeds and we get impatient well you look check every day well nothing's come up yet okay what nothing's come up here all right nothing's come up yet then after Wow well let me check it leave it alone if the life isn't that see you just put it in the right condition and leave it alone if you go to messing with it you're getting cards wait thank you Jesus sometime you see a person going through something leave it alone don't get in God's weight God know what he doing there in that condition God is trying to drive them to a condition when they get on their knees and cry out to God to where they realize that they're tired amen of this condition they want to press out of the dirt amen this condition amen they want to break free and they began and then to press out of their condition press suitable price to the dirt price to the soil amen and then they shoot and the leaves get suddenly yes oh we but the churn is not over it's about producing fruit you're just beginning the journey I say some haven't even begin the journey yet why because they won't stay in the right condition for birth they keep rejecting grace I'm trying to push you into a place where you can go free you don't know freedom until you experience you can be in bondage and think you're free and in bondage all alone you don't know freedom Oh tasted see that the Lord is good amen let us go on Israel came to a time of decision they had to make a decision amen to leave Egypt not knowing where they were going they didn't know they knew the journey was going to be difficult some got along the way and said well maybe it was better where we were after God had vindicated through all kinds of signs wonders and miracles to free them of the condition that they were in they had to steal pick up their feet and make footprints grace was in Canaan the condition was right down in Goshen in Egypt but they had to make a choice I'm going to accept this journey and receive grace all along the way God had already made provisions he took them to the Red Sea a man performed a miracle they went through the Red Sea prophet said it was the waters of separation a man representing that they went through the water a man testified that there's no going back now I'm going all the way I can't go back I can't cross this sea God opened this sea the waters of separation there was no turning back now the wilderness represented sanctification any man they had to lose their rights a man they had to learn to follow the world they had to submit themselves to a prophetic word along the way some begin to murmur some began to complain the journey was tough some began to doubt themselves did we make the right decision maybe it's better back in Egypt in the garlic pits of video amen shame on you keep moving forward no matter how hard it is keep moving forward we're on a journey from law to grace amen one of the things is uh we have to learn how to let loose their rights to let go of all of their Egyptian ways they had to let go of those things a man [Music] the Prophet said here and enticing spirits amen paragraph 96 he say how do you let go so many people are wondering today saying what brother Brennan how do you let go I know you heard a lot of theology on it let go a lot of people just work up a sweat amen tried to let go many people come around and say I was going to go on a 40 day fast so I can do something now you don't need no 40 day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things and take God's Word in your heart you got to be taught how to do that you don't do it by jumping up and down neither do you do it on a 40 day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to Almighty God amen let go amen same paragraph 111 their prophecy don't condemn the sinner have mercy on him let him go ahead and smoke his pipe let him drink his liquor let him have his card partes that is his pleasure don't blame him come home and everything tired and worn out he wants some pleasure the thing you do is to live such a godly life that you can prove to him that the gospel holds 10,000 times more for him [Music] amen now and when he dies in that state that he'll go to hell on his liquor on that devilish intoxication if he dies dragging on that old pipe God is his judge amen because he saw the way he solved your life you proved to him that there's a better way and he rejected his day of grace amen he rejected his day of grace he dies going out there dancing running around with immoral clothes God is his judge but there's one thing if you die under the anointing power of the Holy Ghost like Stephen did when he looked up in the face of God I see heaven open and Jesus standing at the right hand your heaven bow like like a Marten in a box enticing spirit versing the Word of God let loose let go how did you do it brother Brennan how do you do it brother branham just let go that's all you have to do take that is worse don't try to work up nothing don't get down at the altar and beaten hallo God give me the Holy Ghost give me the Holy Ghost he ain't coming you're beating on the altar that that don't do no good see that ain't the way it comes it comes by taking him at his word by taking him at his word amen now Elijah 117 says now Elijah what about Elijah when he come down off the Mount Carmel been up there for a long time and he met a poor widow woman she was an alien a Gentile and when he met her down that she was picking up some sticks in the yard and and gold told him go down there God told Elijah go down there there is a widow's house the process said oh what a place for a preacher to go then he goes down there to the widow's house and when he did she had two sticks said what are you doing picking up some steaks I got just enough meal to make a couple of corn cakes that's all I have left there's three that's been three years since we've had any rain she didn't realize who she was talking to and say when I'm going to make these cold cakes and me and my boy is going to eat them and die Elijah said make me one first mine I know I'm a little bit crazy but I'm on the lowest side anyhow said make me one first for that's thus saith the Lord there you are what is it seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness amen not the kingdom of God a little noise not the kingdom of God and a little emotion not the kingdom of God and a little fist or a little debt but God and His his righteousness and all these things will be added to you put first amen now the widow heard that and faith comes by hearing hearing the word of the Lord here in the word she said that the word of the Lord man though that's a holy man of God she recognized that he was a prophet God's prophet and I know it's the truth and that's the word of God now she didn't run and ask the neighbors how to do it she didn't want to she did it want to go to share her she didn't go tell the neighbors now what oh what you what do you think the preacher has come to my house miss Susan what do you think about this she went in and begin jumping up oh my god she went in and began dumping out anything she had in her pots a man she went in and began jumping out hey man you want to let go first you got a dump out a man you got a dump out he can't fill the vessel that's already food you have to surrender to Almighty God amen dump out amen let's read on she went to begin to dump out so oh she let go she let go of what she had that she might get that's what the world needs today is a good old-fashioned letting go amen of what you got hallelujah she dumped out she could she could get filled so she could get filled up she dumped out she dumped olive oil she had all of all of her oil she had and all of her milk she had to the preacher to the kingdom of God and when she dumped it all out God come down and fill up her mill barrel filled it up the oil job she dumped it out again in the preachers plate and they come by and filled it up again he dug she dumped every he knocked in every time she'd uh he feel amen and every time we done he feel sometimes we just came too much baggage Amen we come and we can fill up it's not your job to hold it you leave these doors dump it up and come back and be revealed again dump it out give you all for the kingdom of God and you won't go empty you will never be empty if you hold it my god you lose it if you lose it you keep it amen it's not yours to keep it's yours you will get there a Christian life is the life of sacrifice amen I don't want to get ahead of myself amen the preacher's plays hey man let's see what were you out here and let the Holy Ghost come in and take its place nothing let me back up and I say today if a man will talk all out this nonsense and carrying all this impersonating of Christianity and let the Holy Ghost take its place there will be a revival start amen Oh Nathan Penn Street that will sweep the whole country quite quite quit the nonsense get back to the Word of God don't pout that you might be filled up let it go amen and God will let come you dump out God will feel all the petty let me let me say this again you dump out God will feel in all of the petty things you got to do this and you got to do that and you ought to do this and you ought to do that forget it dump it out of your soul amen we're talking about a journey from law to grace our destination a man is back to grace I want to hear a story a man of a man had two sons and the younger son said father give me my portion of goods that I may go that's he said give me my portion of goods that falleth Rumi and he divided unto them his livings and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey to a far country and there wasted his substance on riotous living see he fell from grace he had everything he needed in his father's house but what was it he got pulled by the flashing lights I'm grown now I can do what I want to do see that pommel worm then ate down at the tree now change form and now you grown and sexy I can do what I want to do got a little money in my pocket got a job oh man don't let him get a car not only can I do what I want to do I can go where I want to go see no longer was he under the rule of his father he was just old enough to step out of the rule of his father his father said Oh King I'll divide give you an your inherited your money he went out and don't they do it this oughta turn squandered it away on riotous living but God began to make preparation and women speak all his money their roles are mighty famine in the land and he began to warn not for food but there was a famine for the Word of God and he began to once maybe he had sat down of the trough of Pentecost sat down at the trough of Methodists sat down at the trough of Jehovah's Witness and sin because he he had experienced good food was he had already experienced it and now he said my father's servants eaten better than this this is garbage but he said a hunger man to eat out of a garbage can but what happened he went and joined themselves and it to a citizen of a country and he sent him to the fields to feed with the swine and he would fain have filled his belly with the husk and the swamp that the Swan did he and no man gave unto him God making preparation and when he had come to himself see he came to himself and he said how many higher service does my father have bread enough to spare and I perish with hunger he said I will rise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and AM no more worried that you be called son make me as one of the heart service and he arose and he came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion read to him and fell on his neck and kissed him he was glad to see him I had the father I've been waiting on your son I've been praying for you see I got this prayer journal and you right here you're right here in my prayer journal I've been praying for you I know you went out there but God was making preparations all alone amen but he had to come to a decision to arise and make the journey back home and make the journey back home he recognized a man this was no life for him that disturb this is what this wasn't the life that I'm supposed to be living he came to a place of realization that why am I going through this way I'm not doing this to myself why not killing myself why am I doing this you know the devil a usual and spit you out but God is making preparation making preparation for a journey from law to grace amen so we see Amen the son and then his father a man gave him a met a roll say when he yeah a great weight loss and he saw her and he had compassion ran from his fellow his neck in the Sun said unto him father I've sinned against heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more worried that you'd be gone son but the father said to his servants bring me his best robe and put it over put a ring on his head shoes on his feet the boy you name had most and bring hither the fatted calf fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry amen for my son that was dead is alive again he was lost and he is fine and they began to be merry Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see amen and the message things are to be we see a man that Jesus was talking the parable of the sheep folk and he says he says you have to come to the door jesus said I am the door of the sheepfold I am pentecost on this on that that don't mean a thing you must come by the door and if you come by the door you get a robe and this man when he said sir how did you get in here friend it showed he didn't come the right way he didn't come through the door he come in some back way but not through the door because he didn't have the robe on not to the door and the way that Jesus came he didn't come the way that Jesus came now I want you to pay attention sit is because we're traveling my brothers and sisters he said you have to come through self-sacrifice give you all to God the same way Jesus had to walk to Calvary you must walk to Calvary and be crucified with him and rise again to wear his garment of sacrifice and death to the things of this world if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in you if you still have the love of the world won't want to act like the world and don't I like the world and do like the world you try your yet you're in church but a cover in the patch with the we shout with the rest of them rejoice with the rest of them all the spiritual blessings is upon you you say well i prophesy so did Kay Ephesus so did Balaam that has nothing to do with it hold on to your son he says I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that still has nothing to do with it that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you the real gift is in your soul down there amen see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and the we love God and there you grow up see I want to make sure you get back that was born of God Nicodemus said you must be born again and that control so you can have this thing on your first trip that's the problem that so many make we start on its journey but we have to complete the journey we sometimes will go through a man to read see and go through the sight of Satan occasion of the wilderness and right there is where we think we got it but we have to cross Jordan we have to die out we have to let go we have to dump out dump out let go oh right they didn't take Christ life he let it go we have to be like sheep to fulfill our rights that's the door that we must come through to get the road a man so the Word of God in the will of God and you grow up and see that you're a son of the daughter of God and a child of God and these things as you come up like a mother now you're in the bowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a son of God come forth and you see the word says I should do this I should be born again well I belong to the church that don't mean one thing don't mean one thing amen you must come to a Calvary amen I'm reminded here of a man by the name of Daniel curry any man is that a wonderful man of God a sainted man a real Christian a man that everybody thoughts so much of such a wonderful person and the story goes that he died and went into a trance and he said I went up to heaven of course and he when he died he went when he got to the pearly gates The Caretaker come to the door and said who are you he said well I am evangelist Daniel Curie I've won thousands of soul to Christ and I want to come in this morning my life's journey is indeed amen on the earth I have no place to go that's the way it's coming to you some morning Center that's the way it's coming to you backslider that's the way it's coming to you that grieves the Holy Spirit away from you a man if i'ma take liberty who grieve that day of grace away from you not to be gentle and tender anymore you haven't cried for years you haven't blushed for I don't know when all the modesty is gone from you but it's going to come to your door one of these mornings and as the gentle holy spirit comes and knocks why don't you just let him in so when Daniel Kerr had come to the gate and they went and he said well see if you if you got your name here they look all around they couldn't find any name no there's no Daniel Carey here he said Oh surely there must be he said I'm an evangelist he said I've won souls to Christ said I've tried to do the things that's right and the caretaker said I'm sorry to tell you because I'm sorry to tell you but there's no Dan euchre you here said I'll tell you what you might do he said well we have no rights here to take your case but he said what you do you can appeal your case you can appeal a man it to the white throne judgment my god you can appeal it through the white throne judgment and if you want to but he said but say we have no mercy mercy is gone if we have no mercy here for you at all because we don't we don't have you here there is no mercy for you do you want to appeal your case he said sir what more can I do but appeal my case he said when then you go to the white throne judgment and appeal your case there Daniel Kerr said he felt himself going through the space for about an hour said he come to a place and it got lighter and lighter and lighter said father the further he went the lighter regarded it was a hundred times 100 times thousands of times brighter than the Sun ever shine and he said he was trembling and he said when he got to the middle of the light he heard a voice say was he perfect on earth just come out of that light and he said no I wasn't perfect he got the trembling did you always play honest with everybody he said no said a few things come to my mind that I wasn't just quite honest about I guess I was an honest did you always tell the truth in every case in your life said no I remember some things I've told that wasn't that was a little shady that was shady I never was truthful just exactly then did you ever take anything that did not belong to you in him anything money or anything else that didn't belong to you he said on earth that he was pretty good fellow but he was condemned so no I took things that didn't belong to me he says then then it wasn't perfect he said no I wasn't perfect he said it was looking any minute for he was looking any minute for a blasts a man to come from the great light that that from that great light from where the Dove rested condemned he just in he heard a voice behind him say that was the sweetest then any mother's force he had ever heard said he turned to look in the sweet face he had ever saw Sweden in his mother's face was standing before him he said father Daniel Currie stood for me on earth it's true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me on earth now I'm going to stand for him in heaven now all this take all of his sins and put them over on my account who's going to stand for you my brother if you grieve him a way today who's going to stand for you amen you may have come here this morning you woke up this morning you got out of bed and the law of gravity as the musicians

baptism utter Holy Ghost Wow his literal corporal body was on the mercy seat you just have to accept grace tell you something grace is there but it's not gonna fall in your lap there's something you
