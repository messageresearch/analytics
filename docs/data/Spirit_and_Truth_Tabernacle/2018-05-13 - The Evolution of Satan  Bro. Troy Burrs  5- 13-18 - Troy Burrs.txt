our strengths speak to each one individually Oh God as only you can do piracy administering of the gospel in Jesus name I pray amen amen thank you musician man you love the Lord this morning a man kind of tossed a little bit of where I want to start at let's let's turn my Bibles to Ezekiel 28 chapter and hey man ZQ 28 and I should've pray for Miss all the time I get before my son did not do it with me as it might just and the evidence on the mornings a different mosque but I'm excited to be here amen ZQ 28 we're gonna start at the third chapter a man we just hold up just for a little bit ever gotta get settled zekiel 28-30 behold thou art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and with our understanding that has gotten the riches and has gotten gold and silver into their treasures but that great wisdom and by thy traffic has thou increased thy riches and on heart is lifted up because of that riches therefore thus saith the Lord because thou has set thine heart as the heart of God behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty and thy wisdom they will draw their swords against our beauty and my wisdom and they shall defile that brightness I made a law that a blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated any man this morning I want to bring a little I love something from on the thought of the evolution of Satan the evolution of Satan we see that in this day and time that uh as the scripture read here that he's he's certainly very wise we understand through the scriptures that he was the angel that was cast down a man that wisdom and beauty was his tools and he's still using those things to deceive mankind even today I'm going to read another set of scriptures here you can take your seat you don't have to stand to give us a little background in context as soon as I find it I just place up in there don't squish there so bad about our King you want to it and then my brother dev will be all right he might praise the Lord y'all don't mind if I take my time this morning amen First Samuel chapter reading from the fourth verse he says then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto him behold there are old and our sons walk not in their ways and now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased the prophet Samuel when they say give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of that people and all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them according to all the works which they have done which I'm sorry according to all the works which they have done since the day that I the Lord brought them out of Egypt even unto this thing and I'll say even unto this thing wherewith they have forsaken me and served of the gods so do they also unto me now therefore hearken unto the voice howbeit yet protests solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them and as we look oh here Samuel begin the sake night now you ask for this thing not now what's going to happen is this week this this man is going to select a group of men okay and what they're going to do here is he'll take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots not ride run before his change him making himself a big man in London when the Samuel was just the opposite meek lowly and put God first not puffed up and was all about himself and his own desires so we see it goes on that he says he will appoint him captain's over thousands and captain's over the fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest we're talking about king man to ear his ground let me know what the word is among the people who among some and befriend some and hear what he's saying it's about control now I want you to be aware they came out of Egypt by the strong hand of the Lord and through deceit trickery and unawareness slip right back into bondage the same thing Pharaoh did he had taskmaster they just had different names but it was the same bondage we're gonna get into some in a minute here a man y'all bear with me I might be slogan we thorough amen a man now though the word religion means a covering it means to cover something now we look back in Genesis and we see that uh Adam had started though first religion well I would say first Adam they had the first church to members Adam and Eve they met in the Kulin evening to meet and fellowship with God and then what happened we see that uh sin Christine and we'll just leave a day we won't go and all of that but see it crappy and just like man instead of embracing it and going into the bank and confessing it then Lord I'm sorry I did this they ring realizing because of the sin that they were naked before then they had no awareness of it they were veiled to the whole situation much like the dogs cats animals they walk around naked but it don't bother him see they not working around said lord I got to put something I know they just being who they are because they are veiled but because of the sin in the garden we now have to cover it just came naturally so what happened Adam started the first denomination when he took some fig leaves and sold them together and for covering to cover what his shame we didn't go somewhere y'all to cover his shame when God forgot God's provided weight was a death for atonement the Adam Adam walked out they hid themselves and came up with that denominational covering on but first of all we got to address this hill so he went and killed two lamps now not because of your shame an innocent lamb has the gun perfect type of Christ and took the bloody skins from that innocent lamb the Prophet said that that lamb skin was still wet with the blood of the Lamb put the cloud road of this freshly slaughtered innocent lamb the blood running down the back of Adam's leave and they realize them now not only their shame but their guilt this lamb at that time nothing had to lose its life it was a perfect situation it's the cruelty of sin that it brings death it's going to bring death you know if it'll bring that to you those around you it'll bring death to things that you're not even aware of it is a law that sin brings death now they got this covering off and we go home that we see that there's a vast difference a man between religion and salvation religion is a covering salvation is a birth salvation is the birth it is a gift of God and it cannot be achieved by any man or in a group of men it is an individual that God brings to this gift Adam started that and failed he tried to start his own religion and it failed now we see that uh there was another fella that tried to start his own religion followed by the name of Nimrod Nimrod tried to make an organization after the ants alluvion flood and they began to civilize civilization they begin to select men of renown supposedly educated and Nimrod this man of sin took Babylon and his sister churches and places around which a type of it in the last day the apostasy of Christianity today fraud with their education and man knowledge and wisdom to reach God they built the tower that say okay if it's loud again we'll just go up to the top of the tile and be safe but God provided a way from the beginning all you had to do was listen to the prophet Noah get in the boat very simple there was a provider now if you want to circumvent around God's Way with your own intellect select a man or group of men as your leader and they say well they had a council meeting say will fill the tower that's man stinking God's thinking this will tear down and will go to the altar will listen to will go God's provided wait and God destroyed that denomination because that's what it was those were not sinners building this power they were religious men men of renown if not the people wouldn't follow them the devil is not crazy he is not going to come to you with something that's altogether out the scripture he is going to come to you with birth and then don't slip a line now amen y'all pray for me we see in the scripture Cora tried to do the very same thing he got all the Levites together Levites were the ministers of that day and he got a the Levites in some of the celebrities at that time so now you got ministers who being influenced by popularity with the celebrities and these habían and great men and holy men Nathan got together saying it's not right that one man be over us and so they tried to get an organization started and they come up and for Moses in there and God had chosen for the work and told them they took too much upon themselves Moses you evil you're doing too much you're doing too much and the whole congregation was only the whole congregation was solely Clara I believe he was a sincere man believe that demand that it means to do wrong it was his ignorance or lack of understanding that he didn't see the hand of God moving and know the scriptures and that's the reason he just brought it to I'm sorry he just brought it to reasoning now we try to inject our own thinking and to the program of God we're not supposed to try to interject our thinking into God's program but what we're supposed to do is surrender to his will surrender our thinking to the will of God clora with good intent went around with false doctrine telling these brothers showing them by reason that God had only blessed Moses the Prophet the messenger he said the whole congregation was holy Moses is not just you mr. hope the whole congregation is holy and so they got men and Levites that is God's choice not to leave ice so would be called today ministers did not Moses called Levites he called them and there he never went and run and and got a revenant talking about core 9 he told them to take sensors put holding fire in it and put the incense over the top and to wave the holy incense which was the commandment of Lord oh it seemed pretty good it seemed like a pretty good Church day going through all of the right steps are all the right motions God said to Moses and Aaron separate yourself get away from them come out from among them for later oh they would call sinners and unbelievers but they thought they was going in the correct way but they was deceived by a group of men instead of following God's prophet they were deceived by a group of men now amen most of the time religion is the convenient cover for Satan all of us that are Christian today have come out God out of some sort of a struggle and we can maybe look back and said well I'm glad God delivered me from that and I'm where I'm at but make no mistake about it he is always trying to pull you back into a world of sin that you struggle so hard to get out of he's not going through in the way that you Willis expect he has no problem with you not running the streets he has no problem with you not drinking liquor rebel rouser murderers whoremongers thief most of us wouldn't break in the bank we got the courage to do it but what he will do is use religion to get you off track to where you were worship him without knowing it his whole plan is to be worshipped as the Most High now you know he taught my life is look Satan is wise he realized how I got this gotta get you if I can get you going I'll pray behind the road you gonna be son lost you won't know how to get back proper guy said this big i'ma say it in half cause it's on my heart he said the Catholic Church with the first Pentecost and he said look at how far they are from the truth today he say instant i'ma say if the current Pentecostal Church in two thousand years there be so much farther from the truth if they continue to travel off the word at the rate that they're going we we we have to recognize if we don't recognize the state's tactics will fall fall it's the same tricks all through time is to get you to worship Him without doing it to get you off the mark but be religious you don't mind being religious because he knows no power in there there's no power there's no birth there's no transformation Satan knows that there is one God I'm gonna put that out there he was there he knows that there is one God but harmony no he's a deceiver and a liar at one time all the people of the earth believed in one God a man supreme eternal invisible who vowed a world of his mouth spoke all things into existence and and that in the character he was loving good and just but I Satan will always come up whatever he can we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the troops he always attempt to receive worship as though he were God and not the servant but the creation of God he drew his worship away from God to the end that he might draw worship unto Him unto himself and so be exalted he certainly did accomplish that desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world amen later but you see the sovereign God displayed himself a man as a savior to reconcile me and back unto himself now we see the Bible said the serpent was the most subtle beast of the field he was the smarter he almost had a soul he had a place for soul but what did he do he sold out to deceive God to try to Satan himself the spirit knew that was the only scene that would impregnate the woman the chimpanzee wouldn't do it couldn't do it it wouldn't mix and everything else so all he know that the germ of life that was in that chimpanzee would not come to the field of a woman but he know the serpent she would do it and Adam had new Adam had never knew Thank you very that me I could be done had no need to know it he never knew they didn't know they was naked he had these I wasn't even over there but Satan knew a man he uh they made y'all pray from the government look some mixed up here a man any man a double life any man hey man we realized that Adam knew that uh the uh what uh my more at the freelancing manner but be the lower want me to do the law that that that Satan knew a man that uh he must have left some someone knows was back in the bag that Mister someone knows a man that uh he knew what God's plan was and Satan wanted to be a worship as a man the Messiah now now one of the things that Satan desired to do was to get people off he if he can get the people off for the word just a little bit so what what he what he did is he introduced a polytheistic form of worship now at that time when they came out of the flood you had him Sam and Jacob now him that his genealogy keep the got cush cush begat Nimrod Nimrod built the tower and out of that Babylon they begin this polytheistic worship now remember that I say say knew that there was one God knew it but they began in this polytheistic form of worship that mean the worship of multiple gods no say so well there maybe that's an open door I could probably get in there amen and that's how he's going to draw worship Him to himself I stay with me he he they they build this tower and they begin to fall on this religion he went when God destroyed the tower he confounded the languages and they spread out to all parts of the earth Buddha has a representation of God as a man with three hands also India they have a representation of God as a man with three hands all throughout the world there's different forms but it's a polytheistic form of worship that there is multiple gods started through him to cush who never because of the scene now we look on the other side through well Seth they win oh and if she said hero is real now if we talking about the same time frame one week this week and did one thing started civilization why would another way and begot Abraham Abraham begat Isaac and Jacob and they say here o Israel the Lord our God is one now over here they got this polytheistic form of worship and and we we see here in this country is the most deceiving polytheistic form of worship representing the father has an old man representing the Sun as a baby in the manger and representing the Holy Ghost as a dovetail so we do things in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost polytheistic where does it come from they come right there from the same cush Nimrod wait he's introducing a seed that cannot produce itself and through his trickery and through his deception has deceived many we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the first thing you curl up when you scared of something to happen bumpy with a large egg has helped me we don't say Lord father son Holy Ghost come quickly we do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but he wants you to baptize in the name of the Father Son in the heart of good what is that nobody will argue with you when you say your you crazy I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you got no argument none whatsoever but the minute you say have baptize you in the name of why because you cannot receive the baptism of Holy Ghost any other way and if he can keep you know listen then the new birth and the fact of the middle Holy Ghost is different you're born into this body by election I didn't choose to be averse I was chosen it wasn't an idea as it showed up and they I was already born into it the fact that you're sitting here the fact that you're here and if this word is producing a car shows that you weren't chosen for him elected and that you are elected to the birth yeah what you have to do is to go out to be placed in him he knows that what that baptism of the Holy Ghost is gonna do give you power power to overcome power to withstand there will be a bride without a spot or wrinkle why because he promised it simply because he promised it Abraham and Sarah he says Abraham I will bless you according to the time of life Abraham already being wailed in age his wife buried well over the yay age of childbearing years he had this promise he held that his promise the older he got it seemed less likely to the next rely for this to happen the worst it get in this world it's seen the less likely that the full manifestations of the sons of God how in this evil place with all of the calamity and destruction of men wait this is the most all of the scenes of every age is congested bottled up right here in this time but the Bible says when Satan comes in like a flood that means wave after wave after wave the Spirit of the Lord a raise up a standard against it why because he promised it and he's a God that cannot lie there will be a full manifestation those three angels came up to the tent of Abraham he said Lord now remember on the other side of town faithful worshiping three gods Abraham saw one Lord saw one Lord so it show he was right on the scripture he was right there he was it wasn't it wasn't something that somebody taught him it was in his heart it was a party knew cuz he talked with God he prayed he had a fellowship with God talking to Abraham I will visit you according to the time of life Sarah laughed in the tent within a heart he said why does Sarah laugh he said I will visit her the promise of that flesh the child became the full and complete manifestation when she gave birth she gave birth to the promise she gave birth to the promise I'd like to say to you today we have a promise we will give birth to the promise there will be the sons of God that will produce in flesh [Music] the promise of this thing that we will cast out devils in his name that we will be in do with power from Oaxaca that will prove that there will be a pride without a spotter Winkle wrinkle that's manifesting all the promises all the gifts of God again on this earth but say what he wants to do is to try to confuse the people he know that if you don't know God's provide away you'll never get it you'll never get it the reason so many people a love is because of the confusion there's just no doubt that many people good people of the burning in their heart to be right I want to do right I want to do better just thunder what a turn just don't know what a turn but see what the devil does is he'll use now you got so many different religions and so many and they've seen so many different fallacies things that well I don't know that I've know that guy over there and he's the preacher and he did this see he's using that as a scarecrow they keep you away from the gospel just as sure as there was appearance in the Fellowship of Almighty God in the beginning of the Bible Adam and Eve fellowship in the penis of the holiness there is going to be another time again before this earth on this earth before Jesus returned before Jesus returned there is a right a way that seemeth right to man but in the end is destruction a man I want to bring to your attention a man I have here pretty Lord just found the rest of my notes I have here something that I would like to read and not not to offer on any denomination or anything like that I believe they're good people in denominations but I'm here to tell you that come out of her my people come out of her my people that we can't be afraid to see it in this hour come out of her my people because they God is building the bride any time a system organizes and we have some things going on now that uh they'd ever try to do is if he can if he can discredit the man of God he's gonna always attack the man of God to try to discredit him the Lord told mother if you can only to get the people to believe there'll be nothing be able to stand before and all kinds of things that came about that try to discredit why - no way standard you look I visit him he's trying to deceive you that scarecrow look the farmer put the Scarecrow world the farmer knows the Scarecrow you know what it is he trying to keep the birds away but every night then you'll see them click grow big fat good in clothes over there and the bubbles up their mind going to do with that look at that scarecrow 9 now let's get that man time that opponent this is a man with some straw and us in a plaid shirt on you think the man he know then I tell you it's the Scarecrow don't be on the Scarecrow and you can get him to see what those other grow so much right now see somebody got here today I'm going to God with a ratchet coming back to fit exactly and y'all look there today is a miracle his pants hey oh this the creatures ain't no good may all about money I ain't going to strike even though man my money I gave them those are weak-minded people up there looking down at the Scarecrow if you just preface ate it like this you see the Scarecrow that's what a good food anytime you see the Scarecrow that's where you won't be eating but that would have good food that ain't gonna put the Scarecrow up in the in the bag I'll field over there what a good apples that the devil is gonna always put up a scarecrow to keep you away because he does not want to see you become manifest a full manifestation of who you are a son and daughter of God who he intended for you to be you'll be you'll be one way or the other you will make it but you just have to eat that the Word of God is calling you urging you pulling you Satan is pulling you pulling you into the opposite direction using schemes and tactics not like I said if the target is straight in front all he has to do is nudge you just a little bit and you miss the target it has to be line upon line precept upon precept now I want to go back into this now that I found my nose no let me go back over here we see that anytime an organization organizers and a lot of people try to say that we're denomination as well but I say unto you that it's not the case we don't have bylaws and we don't have the headquarters we don't have a boy neither do we have a board of directors we have of sovereignty of the pastor the local church that is led by the Holy Ghost to preach to a body of believers the unsearchable riches of God and that's the way it should be I see here I have this I cannot just did some low research says Amy McPherson after the death of a mimic spiritual in 1944 her son Roth Kate McPherson became president and leader of the Church a position held for 44 years the 4-square Church formed the Pentecostal Fellowship of America in 1948 in Des Moines Iowa in the alliance with the Assemblies of God and the Church of God the open Bible standard churches the Pentecostal Holiness and others in in 1994 46 years after the founding of the Pentecostal fellowship it was reorganized as the Pentecostal charismatic churches of North America after combining with African American organizations most significantly Church of God in Christ built by Amy McPherson a man as one organization under one body under one board that is where the Pentecostal church went to they just said they all bound them together up under their leader of Amy McPherson which she was not a bad lady she pre started she new headquarters in Los Angeles California which spurred out of a revival of piece of the street in Los Angeles California when the gifts first failed in this country the gifts first fail in this country there was a great revival people was coming from all over the world right there started from a prayer meeting at a house went to a barn people were being healed speaking in tongues the power of God was moving people come from all over and from this there was a revival started God was moving revealing themselves to people all kind of denominations spear from that time people meeting will just like Cora but not staying with the word the word always always you look from Genesis to Malachi to the day the word always come to a prophet God is always but another present on the scene to direct the people to truth and it's the only way that you're going to be able to escape the trickeries of the devil the only way to have a puff is God's provided way you see that that common Christianity is so far off the word that they're accepting anything accepting anything they're not preaching the true on adultery they're not preaching repentance anymore come have coffee socials be a good person many a good people died in the flood because they did not heed to the word of the Prophet it's going to take more than being a good person it's gonna take being on the word it's going to take having the baptism that already goes it's going to take dying out to your whole self to your own wheel it's gonna take surrendering you all to Almighty God it's gonna take a thirst and hunger in your soul cuz he that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled if you think you're a starving man to eat out of a garbage can and feel full but there's no nutrients to it it's not gonna build anything it's not gonna be a sale you're just gonna be a weak Christian it's not gonna produce what it's supposed to produce let me move on Satan truly became the god of this world an exact worship that he grew to cause them to believe that he was the Lord through this polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the Trinitarian doctrine it was way back there in a there where God in three persons the idea came into existence how strange that our Martin theological ogres have not spotted this but evidently they're just as do this justice duped by Satan as their forebearers is it not strange that while the descendants of him went on their way in satanic worship involved a basic concept of three gods one trace of the descendents of sham believing such thing having any ceremonial worship involved even a type of it it is not strange that the Hebrew believe here o Israel the Lord thy God is one a man Bev wit might want to get to a certain point and now and we see that Satan amen took them a step at a time away from truth the evolved concept of deity the Eternal Father the spirit incarnate and the human mother a devil is not content he has to achieve worship for himself now he diluted the water he diluted the gospel by hitting them off the word first with these three gods okay now he has to achieve worship for himself expect except in a indirect form he has it in an indirect form but he want it directly he takes the people away from the truth still further through his mysteries he revealed to the people that since the great invisible father God does not concern himself in the affairs of men but remaining silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshiped in silence see so now what is he trying to do they saying that well okay we got three gods or three concepts of three people in heaven now we going to take you a little bit further from the truth and let you know that well you know God is somebody powerful and you can just pray in your heart you can just worship him silently it's an individual thing so you just bother throughout halibut yeah hallo would be thy name remain quietly let's not upset the Holy Ghost real quiet when the people of God sing praise our God if he can take the worship away from God now he can direct it towards himself his first plan is to get you to not worship God to not worship God holy we don't take all of that just like I said earlier this is the quietest place you've ever gonna be the quietest place you've ever gonna be he said since it's not necessary to worship creator the Father it was only natural that the worship swung to the mother and the child as the objects of adoration sweet baby Jesus ain't no baby they got him in the manger steel but what he going that's all about it's all by design let's look on all about design y'all have become a notes all this stuff amen his whole point amen Egypt there was the same combination of mother and son call Isis Norton in Oriya and in Rome in the Greece it follows suit in China same thing it all went to the mother and the son amen in her arms let me see here most of classic writers but we want to see want you to see that that uh the whole thing he's trying to get you to is I'll put it this way my wife called me earlier this week and she said you know I would just listen to the radio and that was a lady on the radio preaching and she was just oh man the Catholic Church is so long and all they decently that not saying wow you know she could see all of this about the Catholic Church and it called him the great woman agree or is pretty amazing that they can't see that she has seven daughters that they cannot they can see the Catholic Church because now like I said it is so far off they not even confess in the god no more they confess it to me they go into a rooming our Father well I've done this and I've done that got a lot a lot around and they feel like where they go out little like they want a little come back and confess again everybody no that's that's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous how far is off the word but they can't see that that same spirit has crept in under the form under the cover of religion in denominations in denominations if come out of her my people yeah you'll never be Hangul within them see the true light of the gospel because it's cluttered with all of it garbage in the field you wonder well why can't you know I try I go to church and I and I try to live the best that I can I do the best that I can and I just failed I just can't come out of her my people come to the true light of the gospel the system just broken cisterns are all full of with the tales and and and things you come out and into the true light of the gospel we're not putting at one time they were truth but what happens is they organize and instead of following the Holy Spirit when Moses came out when he when he when he delivered the people out of bondage of Egypt and the people followed Moses but Moses followed that pillar of fire that same vilify that got his attention on the mountain and spoke to him I the pill if I say I have heard the cry of my people what does that tell me dead car here's your cry don't believe the devil's life when you pray pray talk to God never harkening he he proves over and over that he hears your voice your voice your voice science this microphone is amplifying my voice right now and carrying it further at the day of judgment there will be a everything that you've done so as you know some people say that they've got my father dealing my father was getting ready to pass on over he say his life came back before him he said he just seems they thought they've been able to see everything that happened from a childhood all the way up it never dies it never goes anywhere you think it just goes out and falls short that's why you got to be careful of what you say careful of idol communication but if that never dies neither does the praise and the worship neither let's praise worship and your prayers they go straight to the heart ago you want to be you if you get tired of playing Church sin such hypocrisy at every turn and it's gotten you to a point to where you say that's just is there a god anymore we see where things have degraded to in the lie in mankind we've been here before and it's said he said it i repent that I even made man do you think we've got there again look around a blind man could see that but this shall be like in the meantime there will be a bride without a spot or wrinkle that would manifest the fullness of God in flesh not some angelic being in flesh and we will have fellowship with him again just like he intended for it to be before sin came into the picture but will be better than because we know where we came from we will realize that it was the love of Almighty God just like I said earlier when I started he knew that it took death for the atonement of that sin they so sig fig leaves know and after the blood of that man I'm still dripping down the back of his leg we had a savior they committed him to death they put him on this white outfit robe and they began to beat him he said then it started out as a little blood spot on the back of that road and as he went to through the crowd they shove thorns in his head now a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief had done nothing wrong he was that spotless lamb from the throne of Almighty God came to reconcile us back to where we had lost that position to where we have pure fellowship with him and that lamb skin that he had put on Adam and Eve as they walk thinking on the kill of what they had done all of a sudden the animals wasn't their friends anymore it was a little bit tougher to find food everything was provided for him it was just a beautiful place and they would go and sit and just talk with God and have a wonderful evening but then after all of that ended they had to put on this cut skin realized that this lamb died for them and the blood running down their leg and our Father Christ bleeding bloody carrying his cross to Calvary the blood running down the back of his leg as he's bearing all of our sins upon himself reconciling us back to where we came from hung on that cross he had the power to come down as I said before we go through this life and through our day-to-day tasks not realizing that we travel with an entourage of bodyguards angelic bodyguards all around us imagine the hosts of angelic bodyguards around them all you had to do was say one word and it would have killed every soldier around but he said not a mumbling word because he had to bear our sins that sacrifice why so that Isaac can be produced again so that the promise can come forth again in this hour he wasn't looking at those people of that day when he hung on that cross those people were there you know who he was thinking about that group way down in the 20th century where all of the scene is gonna consist up into this one time they're gonna need this they're gonna need this blood to keep them how sad would it be to reject such a greater sacrifice such a greater sacrifice it's a trick that a enemy to try to give us off the word all those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be fear are you hungry are you thirsty are you ready to go home are you ready to be to come the full manifestations are the sons of God first you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you were baptized any other way any other way then god of Lord Jesus Christ it won't happen it's a trick of the enemy you must become you can't come to God now that isn't done Savior first you must have regardless are within your heart and repent of your sins that's the call that's the call if you can't even first repent of your sin there's no call you repent god I'm so sorry that showed that you got to love a God in your heart now he takes you from there until what perfection perfection in him which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this corruption of one day put on incorruption and will be fully manifested as the sons and daughters of God later church save me musicians come a man you know we've come a long way I couldn't remember a man I was a young lad going to church with my grandmother and as a young man had experience with God I used to have asthma real bad my parents to tell it a state in and out of the hospital but I would go to church grandmother was taken to the church in every church they would had a prayer line and my mother my grandmother didn't have to ask me you want to get in the prayer line she didn't have to ask me I was maybe 7 8 years old and I would go up and get in the prayer line and believing that I would not have to go to the hospital no more believing at that age that I wouldn't have to go to the hospital no more I knew then that God was real and I'm sure at some point in your life you know you know God is real but through the deceit of man through the failures of man through the trickery of Satan he put up scarecrows to try to keep you away from God if you just seek Him seek Him he shall be found amen don't feel no waste time I come too far from where I stopped from nobody told me that a row would be easy I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me [Music] don't be special feet no waist hurt I come too far from where I started from [Music] nobody told me that the Rope would be easy I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me a second here I come too far yes nobody told me

sons and most gracious Heavenly Father Lord God we just know we bow our hearts Lord towards your Lord Lord is just chopped up message or Lord God and how I kind of got my notes on a rat girl but I believe Lord you said what you want to say Lord Lord let us realize our Father that there's such a stigma upon the gospel in this hour maybe we just look beyond the Scarecrow's it's trying to keep us from such a glorious wonderful event and in this hour that we live in this evil age so much all around us the level of sand-filled fest congested in this age through man's wisdom and social media television the music I was just disgusting in this age Lord and I believe we're right back again to where [Music] you repent it that you made man it stinks to your nostrils the things that go on in a run of a date but Lord in the midst of all of that filth there's a bride there's the people that's hungry and thirsting for you there's a people of father God that are worshiping you not believing a lot of devil that says uh worship him in silence but Lord was holding to your word to every promise Lord God as we fellowship with you day by day law looking to you to [Music] Lord God changed these

[Music] principal how many appreciated that message safer Satan is very very deceitful he's doing his best to make our job hard even the medicines with his brother Armstrong brother Troy brother Jack know sometimes Satan he gets into government he legalize a sin and when the people when the people realize that sin is legalized they have no no guilt so there's no crying their heart from God because there's no guilt nothing to penetrate their conscience so it makes my job also we gotta pray more honestly and we have to be more yielded to the Lord that they could see Jesus some ways we are his his hands we are his eyes we are his voice he own the earth we have a position in Christ Jesus and it's gonna be Christ along that we have to stand with us sing this song together before you go to Christ
