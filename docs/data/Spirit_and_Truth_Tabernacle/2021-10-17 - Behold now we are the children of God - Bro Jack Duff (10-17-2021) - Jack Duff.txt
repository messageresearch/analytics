today and it's good to have everyone in the house of the lord uh and uh appreciate the specials and everything that has gone forth uh god bless you all um i will dismiss the musicians thank you all so much amen as brother trove was saying earlier uh sister lois mother was um they had the homegoing service on yesterday but they are burying her today so the family is there and we just want to remember them in our prayers and um that god would just strengthen them uh lord bless her to see a a fruitful life 96 years on the earth and um generations i mean multiple generations that she had a chance to witness and you know just we just thank god for that certainly his grace that was given to her and uh you all keep brother smiling prayer i know that he is in orlando uh preaching at brother stacy's church amen this morning so we thank god uh for that opportunity that he had amen to go there praise the lord um let's turn our bibles to a uh a scripture here in john chapter one last week and we had a wonderful time with brother diggs and man and um you know he uh he he it kind of picked up where we were in in some of our messages we had just preached the message on traits and he came and just hit all of that and uh and then i had another sermon that i was just waiting to preach here uh this morning and and he stepped right into that with uh uh with his uh uh the scriptures and you know we'll probably go from a different angle uh than what he presented to us but nonetheless it is the word of god amen and we trust that we'll all be blessed amen by this so let's uh let's look at this uh john chapter one amen uh verse one says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and i'm skipping over to verse 10 uh in the same chapter i'm gonna i got a little ring coming back to me here just maybe lower my mommy just a little bit um it says here in verse 10 says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not uh he came into his own in his own received him not can you imagine all this just just just i mean ponder you know what john is was speaking to us here he says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we built we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's just bow in a word of prayer lord jesus we are grateful for the opportunity to read the scripture god and we pray that your word would just rise up off the pages and speak directly to us amen on today god be glorified and magnified in this place i want to remember sister louis and god of family brother solomon and sister sharrell their bearing mom grandma lord just as they're going through this process today we pray that you give them strength to help them god during this time and what we thank you for the 96 years that you did give her here on this earth what a what a wonderful blessing that is and and god we just ask that you just just strengthen them and just be with them uh during this all the other saints lord that are not here today you know whatever the reasons are just actually to be with them want to remember brother smiley as well as he's there in uh orlando minister in the word of god use them for your glory and for your honor god is our prayer in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen good to see you sister for you god bless you amen amen um i um want to use for a title today beloved now are we the children of god amen beloved now are we the children of god and um when i i'm just i was just kind of i'm gonna hit another another passage of scripture here in a second and um but i was just uh really really blessed by this scripture that we just read and you know last week when when brother um diggs had actually read it i said this was the one that i needed uh because it it connected with something else that i that i had so just bear with me here uh i'm just looking at this as we just read here you know in the bible john 1 verse 10 it says he was in the world this is talking about our lord and savior jesus christ he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not this just really strikes me the creator of you know of the universe the one that spoke let there be had become flesh and here he was dwelling amongst mankind amen um my uh if i could just use words like this he was going to school every day come on somebody and and as he was approaching school these kids had no idea who was their student the the student that was next to them when the teacher would call him up to the board and he would figure out the math problem the teacher had no idea who this child was right uh maybe the neighbors a man in the neighborhood had no idea who was living next to them right i want you to try to get this amen in your mind when he when he went to work praise god because his uh he he was a carpenter amen when he went to work the co-workers had no idea who was working next to them this is the creator of mankind this is the one that gave you breath to breathe hallelujah this is the one that put life in your body this is the one that's made a way out of no way this is the one when you when you when you when you heard the testimonies in church about god opening up a red sea amen when you heard the testimonies about a man a lion's den and an alliance not being able to to take advantage of daniel when you heard about the three hebrew boys in a fire and a fourth man stepped in this is the one that is standing there this is the one that is sitting there he came into this world came into this world the bible tells us this he was in the world and the world was made by him good god almighty and the world knew him not you know it it it just it i have to say it somewhat bothers me that they didn't know how how is it that they miss uh the lord jesus how is it that they missed it right because um you know the same way today i want to put it this way the same way they miss the lord jesus they're also missing us oh yes they're also missing us they don't recognize who we are come on somebody i i'm not here just delivering a package right i'm not here just fixing computers glory to god amen whatever your job is you're not they're just uh running numbers hey man right you not just volunteering where you're volunteering you're not there just teaching a class glory to god amen there's a daughter of god walking into your presence every day there's a son of god walking into your presence every day the world knows us not we're not just an ordinary church we're not just another group of people sitting here gathered we have come from god and we're going back to god we know who we are blessed be the name of the lord and our names may not be written in who's who but we know our names are written on the lamb's book of life oh hallelujah church i think it's important that we recognize who we are even though the world didn't know jesus jesus knew who he was and you know and and i think you know there we will get to this in a little bit but there were there was some in the world that knew who he was and and and one of them amen that that i believe it clicked uh somewhere along the way that this wasn't just an ordinary baby right i mean mary got a revelation at some point in time because um when jesus came of a certain age and and the family hadn't been invited to a wedding and here they all are headed to this wedding and and when they get there to the wedding uh you know somehow some way they run out of wine glory to god and and mary though uh i believe it's just my imagination i believe mary had gone through certain things in the home where she knew that when trouble arose she could go to jesus hallelujah we got to know the same thing when trouble arrives as we can go to jesus hallelujah you might not be able to get to mama you might not be able to get to daddy glory to god when you call maybe that they're busy and they can't take the telephone call but you can always call on jesus [Applause] and he's always there to answer but maybe mary had some experiences there in the house that she could give the people advice they now whatever he tells you to do just do it oh glory it may it may sound crazy it may sound ridiculous but if he tells you to do it just do it and hear a mary saying no now this is what you do so jesus come and say now i'll tell you what it's really before my time but but just go get some water pops and fill them up with water and just you know just get water pots and just bring them and and they're uh and at this wedding glory to god he turns the water into wine right she had a she had a revelation she had an understanding of who this was this was the creator that was in her presence glory to god and i believe everybody else that tasted of that wine also knew the creator was present they never seen a man turn water into wine glory to god now i want to just maybe read something here because uh i'm i'm kind of uh intertwining some things here uh my title's beloved now we are the children of god see i mean jesus certainly was the the first begotten of the father but but we're also sons of god we're also daughters of god we are the children of god now i want to just read something and and my prayers that um in recognizing who we are we'll come to uh our spirit man will get settled amen that you know we don't have to be worried about this and worried about that we are the children of god now i want you to understand i want to i don't want to i want to say this we're not uh using that in a way of arrogance amen but it's just recognizing that as a son of god the devil can only go so far only as far as god will let him hallelujah somebody some of us should have already been dead accidents that we had and all kind of other things that we ran into the reason you are not going right now because god said not so hallelujah god said not so amen if satan has boundaries he can only go so far now as children god we got to go through things now understand that that's part of life we're going to have some trials we're going to have some distresses we're going to have some tribulation that is part of this journey even jesus had to go to the cross so we're not running from trials and we're not trying to stop that it's through that that our characters develop so we thank god for it but but i want i want to say it's not a place of arrogance but it's a place of certainty i know who i am in christ i am a son of god i am a daughter of god amen look at this now i want to read from this sermon gyrus and divine healing the prophet makes a statement it says it's the atmosphere it says you you you gotta get away from it from that old confusion it says oh am i gonna be you're scared look at this it says you're scared it says that's what's the matter say you're scared that's what's the matter you'll be frying your meat of a morning for breakfast and the first thing you know you're filled with the holy spirit now i'm going to shock you a little bit now listen to what he says i'm going to shock you a little bit you don't mind do you he says all right for instance the meat's frying and all that once the grease pops out on your hand my god says now if you'll shake it off now now i want you to catch what the prophet is saying if you will shake it off not when the grease prop pop get your phone and try to call the pastor or try to call somebody else with prayer no when the grease pops oh i don't know if we get that church i'm not just talking about when greece pops i don't care what comes against you hallelujah god is for you who can be against you when anything comes against you just learn how to shake it off oh glory to god [Applause] i'm reminded of the song amen of the amen i i think i forget who the songwriter was that was singing about the uh the the mule that was count uh caught inside of a uh a whale yeah and and they would just take the dirt and they would just put it in there amen on the mule inside the well and and every time some dirt would come on the mule them you would just shake it off and then put some more dirt in them you would shake it off and everybody see if you didn't have a understanding as to what the mule was doing you think why is this mule doing that but every time it was shake it off it was stepping up a little higher so they post some more dirt in it and shake it off step up a little higher shake it off step up a little higher when this trial comes shaken off step up a little higher when track trial comes shake it off step up a little higher please come amen the trial did not come to destroy you but the trial is coming to bring you to perfection glory hallelujah my i forgot to start my timer forgive me those first few minutes are free oh glory hallelujah look at what the prophet says here he says if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat i don't don't just quit oh i got burnt um no shake it off and keep frying the meat don't let nothing

once agree grease pops out on your hand now if you just shake it off and go on for our meat it wouldn't bother you now i know you didn't get that just right because that didn't settle into people's spirits brother branham tells me i'ma shake you now i'ma shock you when i say this he said now you frying meat and the grease pops out and you just shake it off and keep on frying meat and then you also say it won't bother you you ought to use that i will i will put that quote over my stove shake it off and he said it won't bother me well i see a little something that's a lie it's not supposed to bother me i'm not going to accept it praise god all right all right let's keep going he says um it uh it says i know you didn't get that just right look the first thing oh where's the ungenting something you see grabbed your hand see it scares you to death that's what does it it's fear and brother brother brother brother dick spoke you know casting down fear glory to god peter walking on water on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared jesus said why'd you fear amen that's what's the matter with the holy ghost people today they got a lot of fear right say the devil's just trying to scare you out of something even so even the devil know you you getting ready to get a blessing so what the devil got to do is try to scare you so you don't get your blessing get you operating in fear you know the same strength it takes to operate in fear is the same strength it takes to operate in faith [Applause] it's just where you're gonna point it where you go where you import what target you're gonna point towards i'm gonna point towards faith faith can change anything all right let me keep going here he says uh uh uh that's what does it uh he says that's what's the matter with the holy ghost people today they got a lot of fear the devil's just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else say some of these days you'll be this you are now now we're sons of god now we're seated together in heavenly places now we have all powers in heaven and earth see now we have it not in the millennium we won't need it then we got it now glory hallelujah and if we got it now we ought to use it now amen uh he says uh right it says uh uh uh uh now we are the sons of god it does not appear what we shall be but we know we should we will be like him what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else those who he called he justified is that right those who he justified he have glorified already in the presence of the father we have a glorified body he says woo wasn't that deep all right we'll find out whether it's right or not if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting is that right that's right so right now uh what we are there is a reflection what we are here is a reflection of where we are somewhere else so if your deeds are evil you know where it comes from you know where your other body's waiting that's if your deeds are evil but if your deeds are good and righteous you also know where your other body is waiting glory to god glory to god i thank the lord for this amen now i want to slip into another little thought here um as we just you know again the scripture tells that he came to his own uh they didn't receive him not only that he was in the world the world knew him not and then he came to his own his own receiving not just just very negative you know when you look at the world don't know him the very place that he created they have no idea who he is and then the ones that he's coming specifically for actually reject them think about it they actually reject the word i mean these are the ones that he's coming to die for and they reject him that's a sad situation to be in right i mean you you can imagine you know just as a just as a human certain people that you might want to i want to do this and i want to do that maybe for a family member for a loved one i want to do this and you do it and they reject you it's not a good feeling but yet he does it anyway hallelujah now look at this i want to just kind of pick up something out of the message expectation the prophet says all right now let's give a little drama here let's give a little drama here it says let's say there's a prayer room out at the temple say it's monday morning and oh there's about 2 million something jews in palestine then probably many hundred children was born overnight right he's given a drama says and every day there would be a line of women lined up there for circumcision of the male child offering turtle doves of lambs if if it was a peasant they had turtle doves it was a rich person a lamb he says a lamb the rich person says for the purification of the mother and circumcision of the child and so forth you know the jewish laws let's say this was monday morning says all right i see the temple is busy people coming and going around and around it's all going around after a while i see a long line of people women standing all up and down that line so the prophet is kind of putting us on the scene amen of what's happening when jesus is coming amen to be offered at the temple all right the dedication time for the babies and everything like that purification for the mother he goes and says and i see some of the women where are there with the little babies with their little pink knitted needlework gowns on them and little shawls and little blue shawls and each one leading a little lamb rich women and oh how pretty way down the line let's look i see a little lady standing down there with a head bout my god just a little girl with a baby in her arms oh my poor oh glory to god said oh my poor two turtle doves clothes wrapped in swaddling cloth now notice what he said about the other mothers they had little blue sharps amen for the for the boys for the boy babies and maybe some pink songs for the girl babies but this mother my god had her baby wrapped in swaddling cloth amen that's the that's what they take off the yoke of an ox you know when he when he's plowing keep him from rubbing his shoulders there was nothing in the manger so she just didn't have no clothes good god almighty i i need y'all to see this amen when our lord and savior was coming to this earth they had no baby shower for him nobody to buy diapers nobody to give some little onesies nobody to do any that i'm talking about he came into this world and they knew him not and look at the way he came look how humble he came into the world amen sometimes we think we we owed something we need to realize we are nothing without god glory to god look at this now it says uh uh uh uh oh my he said just didn't have no clothes you talk about poor there's not a family in phoenix that poor charity would do more for you than that but he was the very god of creation standing here born in a manger come by the way of a manger and went out the way of capital punishment came to his own in the world and the world was made by him the world knew him not and he was laying there in his mother's arms rapping wrapped in swallowing clothes now i want to you know just inject a little bit here before i go further amen and and that particular quote actually i'm going to be kind of moving around uh back and forth uh i'm going to probably next i'm going to go back to the uh raising gyros door and i'm going to go back to that but i'm going to come back to this expectations but let me just kind of move around here a little bit amen as i you know i'm just looking at a lord and savior a man uh coming to the earth and and looking at how humble it was his parents so poor you i mean i'm talking about god god could have made a decision to come uh through a palace he could have been born in a house where there was a king already on the earth but but he didn't do it that way amen he came to a man a place where they i mean they could barely rub two nickels together i want you to think about it amen here you know he chooses just this couple uh that he's gonna use as as you know uh amen just just thought he could become kin to mankind i want to put it that way we know that moses i mean mary was not his mother and joseph was not his father amen it was god created this entire body inside of mary mary's just an incubator carrying a man christ but they did have a responsibility to to raise him and to teach him and to and to do all these things they had that responsibility but yet he was god in the flesh i want to i want to say this jesus was more than the cousin of john the baptist glory hallelujah jesus was more than a teacher when they called him rabbi he was more than just a teacher amen jesus was more than a carpenter hallelujah amen jesus was the second adam who came to redeem his own glory to god the reason the world could not receive him is because the world was not his own but he came to redeem his own jesus was god in the flesh this is what we read in scripture the word was made the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth i remember you know a little story here of a sister brother branham ran into a she said he says you know um you brag too much on jesus so you brag too much on him you say you try to make him divine he said oh my sister i can't brag enough on the lord jesus i can't preach enough about the lord jesus i can't talk enough about the lord jesus she said you just brag too much on jesus she said i can show you in your own bible where he was not divine he said you can show me in the bible where jesus was not divine she said please pull up that scripture for me sis and she went and turned her bible and and she got the story of lazarus and she looked and she saw uh the shortest verse in the bible two words and she had a she thought she was prudent before and said so it said right here jesus wept that shows how could he be divine and crying at the same time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and and i like this because i wrote this note he was human enough amen to be touched by the infirmity but he was god enough to raise lazarus from the dead [Applause] and you know brother brother branham said sis you know that's a very weak argument i mean just you got to keep reading the rest of that story right because you got him you know jesus wept yes he did weep as a man he was touched by that he says but when he straightened up his shoulders amen and he said lazarus come forth that was more than a man that spoke that and the prophet even told us had he not called lazarus by name everything that was in the grave would have come forth at that time say he was human enough that when he got a little weary and wanted to lay on the back of a boat amen as he was going across to the other side he was human enough to be tired enough to want to go to sleep hallelujah but when they woke him out of his sleep glory to god because trouble was all around i'm telling when jesus saw trouble he didn't panic he shook it off praise god he looked at the wind and the waves and he said peace be still we need to wake up sometime and shake some things off and speak to the wind and waves in our life peace be still glory to god hallelujah he said took more than uh took more than a man to do things like that that was god almighty veiled in human flesh oh blessed be the name of the lord let me uh i think i'ma just keep reading here amen and that message expectation glory hallelujah oh my my my thank you lord oh yes let me just keep reading that so so she was coming along i can hear some of them say hey that's that girl there says you know that's the girl that had the baby without being married don't stand near her they kept their distance put your mind or some of them sisters people today a bunch of holy rollers don't have nothing to do with them little mary knew where she was standing so does the church that's born again of the power of god knows where they're standing don't make any difference what you say you can say they're crazy whatever you want but they know where they're at don't you worry just go ahead and say it said she never opened her mouth she rocked the little fellow and patted him on the cheek he looked up amen in them little uh eye staring little uh like little stars looking at his mother she pat em some of them say look at that isn't that awful and they didn't know what that was their very creator laying there in that arm so it come on down there he there he was holding her arm like that and she was patting the little fella playing with him and i can see the mothers keeping their distance from her you got you got to put yourself on the scene amen oh there was the christ of the temple in the temple poor humble i can see simeon sitting out there reading isaiah hallelujah see everybody amen uh wasn't like these ladies that were criticizing there was some people on the expectation looking for him and now he picks up simeon oh my my my my my glory glory glory it says uh i can um uh uh uh let me find my place again here uh and simeon sitting out there reading isaiah oh we like sheep going astray and the lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we were we were healed now he's meditating on the word of god and we need to learn how to meditate on the word of god unto us a child is born amen unto us a son is given i can hear simeon say wonder who wrote that you all believe in being led by the spirit of god sons of god are led by the spirit of god is that right he said now the holy ghost told him i love the way the prophet puts it now the holy ghost told him he was going to see christ before he died and there he is reading you know and on like that and i can hear the holy ghost say simeon stand up my simeon say yes lord yes lord start walking simeon amen where lord just walk simeon amen that's all just keep walking oh my hallelujah i like that just keep walking and if i can encourage you this morning whatever you facing praise god keep walking keep pressing on glory to god god gonna bring you through sometimes you can't explain every step of this journey but know that god is with you and if god is with you who can be against you [Applause] it says keep walking glory glory glory glory look he says uh i made you a promised simian you don't know nothing about it right now but you're walking right into it come on let me get rid of this amen thank you brother thank you amen so just it's and i i just i like i like this as you walk in church you're walking right into your promise now you can't see the promise you know something there but but but you got to understand you're taking a step of faith and with faith you can't see every step of the way but just keep pressing on keep walking don't give up oh my just because this one said no don't mean all i'm going to say no [Applause] man brother west coast got that first house yeah i mean it was it was against it was against preachers to buy houses they said their income was not stable they didn't know what they was going to get from week to week oh come on church can i talk about it just a little bit because sometimes saints amen they go through in their finances and the first thing that that gets challenged when you're going through your finances is your tithe and your offering amen glory to god you i mean you start that's the first thing say oh lord you go i need you to understand what god understands that you don't trust him [Music] that's what y'all understand you don't trust him right because when you're going through action that's a test where god trying to see what you're going to do now amen bring break bring that tithe and then offer right to the house of god i mean even when it seemed like that bill ain't gonna get paid and that bill ain't gonna get paid i got news for you if you just bring it and give it to god before you get back home the bill will be paid you will never see the miracle if you don't put god first take me a cake first then you'll see the miracle and everybody got to be tested in that area i had to be tested in that area oh gloria i feel jesus in the place [Applause] tithing adolf man i i'm coming back here i i'll get back there in a second but and let me just try to find where i was amen but you know i i shared a testimony but i'll share it

tennessee and and a sister was there on the ground praying saying now lord i'm just true to my woman and i can identify myself in the scripture i see my condition in the bible it says but where is your elijah now she asks the right question because elijah was flying right over the top of this of the city and the plane had to be grounded mechanical failures they didn't understand what was gonna it was god answering the prayer of one woman and everybody had to be disrupted because one woman was getting a prayer answer oh i love that church amen everybody else will be disrupted if god wants to bring the answer to you the doctor will be disrupted the nurses will be disruptive amen the car dealer will be disrupted the bank will be disrupted whoever got to be disrupted for god to bring the promise to pass they'll just be disrupted hear this hear the lord you know the lord allows the great the plain the plane to be grounded and and the next morning brother branham gets up and say he

my situation is i'm the shooter mike woman i got a child in there and he's dying and say look i don't even want him to get healed i just want to know that he's safe because if he's safe i'll see him on the other side he ain't got to be healed just let him be saved oh if we have some more mamas like that i don't need him to be a millionaire god i just need him to be safe i don't need her to have

the bed and a young man that's just saying he just screaming out it's dark in here it's dark in here it's dark in here and uh and aj he's like man a very dreary situation say mama say auntie that's what he calls it if you don't mind you pray first and he got down there on his knees and they both got down that he said that woman began to pray and it brought tears to a prophet's eyes they hear that lady praying like that let me tell y'all something she wasn't silent she wasn't calling out and saying no i ain't gonna pray tonight no no she opened her mouth wide and began to ask god things concerning her son prophet heard it brought tears to his eyes and as he began to cry say my say he he knew the presence of the lord was there he'd say lord you know uh he started praying lord i don't

gonna pray for the sick and god i gotta go catch my plane he said he said so lord in the name of jesus touch this board and while he praying he heard the boy change his testimony in the middle brain stop saying it's dark in here now he's starting to say it's light in here it's light in here it's light and his whole his whole situation changed in a moment of time just through prayer let me tell you something whatever you're going through it can change in a moment of time through prayer [Applause] got up ran back to the airport so i probably don't miss my plane but he heard him say as he was getting all the stuff together and running through the airport last call for louisville kentucky made it just in time so when brother branham's giving us this i mean it's just this thought here he's already had experiences like this amen let's pick it up now amen is to talk about simeon how simmons just walk him glory keep walking glory glory glory is that far enough lord just keep walking walks over and sees where this line of women well i think i'll walk down and as he got closer something began to move on him don't you believe that led by the spirit of god sons of god the promise is there the messiah was in the temple the very one that the holy ghost promised him he walks down he sees this little woman he reaches over and he takes that baby out of her arms tears running off his white beard now he was drawn to the one that had the swaddling cloth oh hallelujah amen simian is drawn to this one right so he says reaches over takes the baby out of her arms tears running off his white beard said now lord let thy servant depart in peace according to thy words for my eyes have seen your salvation oh my lead of the holy ghost yes he was expecting to see him and if he was expecting to see him god is under obligation to let him see him see there were some people that was looking for him simeon was one of those and at the same time you know she came and you go back and read it in in the scripture uh i i wrote it down i don't have it in front of me i think it's in the book of luke there but you can go back yeah luke chapter two you can pick up the whole thing but anna was there also as a witness that's just to prove that it was the lord jesus he was not just another child coming to be dedicated amen he was just uh amen this was the god of heaven that was coming the redeemer that was coming salvation was coming you know and as i thought about this because beloved now we are the children of god let's pick up a scripture let's pick up a scripture first john 3 first john 3 i was at my house a few weeks ago and and uh i was just trying to read a little scripture before we leave amen in the morning we have a word of prayer and we read a scripture and and that morning i just you know picked up this and i started reading it and as i picked it up i said my this this really speaks to me but here in 1st john chapter 3 verse 1 and 2 it says behold what man of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not now that that's the part that really got me the world knoweth us not because it knew him not when you you you you students that are amen going to school your your classmates have no idea who you are those of you that report to work amen every day your co-workers have no idea who you are they don't realize a son of god or daughter god had just walked into the room oh hallelujah they have no idea what they're connected with and i was saying earlier jesus was not just the cousin of john the baptist i want you to know something your family don't even know who you are this is my cousin ah i'm i'm more than your cousin i mean in mary and joseph's case he was more than a son right he was more than a brother to them siblings he was more than that hallelujah it's time for amen us to first recognize who we are because here the scripture says uh the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen beloved now are we the sons of god we uh and and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now as i was just you know thinking about you know this this just pondering on this this poor family glory that's coming to the temple one day just to offer uh uh for purification for the mother and you know dedication of this child and everything and nobody really understood here these these these sisters are just talking oh that that's her look at her that's the one that you know had that babe without being married and she said she said the holy ghost came have you even ever heard of anything called a holy ghost this new language she using come on what's she expect us to believe we know we we know how children are born we know but didn't know that that was the very their very creator they were speaking of like that hallelujah as i pondered on it just hit me i thought of another poor family that came to this earth gave birth to a son and when this boy was born there just so happened to be a a dove i think flying through the route flying through the room amen the supernatural happened when this boy was born amen uh this this boy that was born in this house a man was predestinated by almighty god to fulfill certain prophecies in the scripture amen he attended school at one time and i'm talking so poor he attended school one day he went to school with his mama's shoe on one foot and his daddy's shoe on the other foot you talk about paul can you imagine a man sending your kids out to school like that and it's cold and they need to have their feet covered so he got to go to school with one mama shoe in one daddy's shoe you know he was ridiculed for that you know he was made fun of for that and i thought about what this this young man was experiencing throughout his life and life and i just wonder how i mean maybe most of his classmates had no idea who this boy was that had one daddy shoe and one mama suit they had no idea who this guy was amen and they were ridiculing him and picking at him and doing everything they could amen uh i mean just to try to destroy him but they had no idea this man was the very fulfillment of scripture i said little did they know that they were attending school with the seventh messenger of revelation uh one two and three little did they know that they were attending school with the man that was fulfilling malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. glory to god see the scripture says uh uh we came into the world and the world didn't know i see the world knoweth us not they didn't even know this prophet that god had put on put on the earth i thought about that look at this amen amen i want to say this i don't know your story i don't know all your story but can i can i just say this my family grew up poor too hey man we come from pleasant city amen and now i'm gonna tell you that's not even you won't find that on the map amen it's a part of west palm beach but but but the area is called pleasant city and anybody from pleasant city knows where pleasant city is oh hallelujah oh glory to god amen i mean but i thought about it some of y'all i know your story and i know amen what some of your background is amen and it just just i just want to say that some of y'all come from cocoa beach some of y'all come from west palm beach some of y'all come from south africa and belle glade and clewiston amen new york and ghana south carolina haiti alabama new jersey zimbabwe riviera beach jamaica you come from all kinds of places with all kinds of stories hallelujah amen but there's something in each one of us that's connected to this word that we have glory come from puerto rico amen but something drew our attention to this word glory to god the world might not know us but we know who we are amen we are believers not just believe us we are children of the most our god i'm fellowshipping with god's children here this morning amen our classmate classmates did not realize who we were our cousins may not realize who we were the co-workers may not realize who we are but we are sons and daughters of the almighty god i want to tell you something that you are the second eve because jesus was the second adam but you are the second eve that was ordained not to fall [Applause] amen behold beloved now now now are we the children of god i'm not talking about we will be we are right now we are right now we we know who our daddy is we know who our father is glory glory glory glory amen here amen in uh john 1 verse 10 through 13 we read a little earlier says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not glory he came into his own and his own received him not but i love this but as many as received him that's us to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name and i want to i want to go another step in that because john was writing about you when he wrote this which were born not of blood let me tell you something your parents didn't plan to have you amen and in some situations some of your parents say well now you know we really wasn't trying yes you were trying if they were born you was trying amen but now we really weren't trying to have no children you a mistake don't let your parents tell you that you was a mistake i'm i'm because the scripture says that you were a man uh which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh amen nor of the will of man but of god i am here because god wanted me to be here and i couldn't help how i got here amen but i'm here because god wanted me to be here hey we're children of god amen amen amen so there's something greater than my my natural lineage yeah there's certain traits that may follow through that natural lineage but but there's a heavenly trait that's been following me glory hallelujah hallelujah amen all right hey man i wanna i wanna uh pick up oh my just a a couple of things here let me go back to a little little little quote that i had this is out of smyrna church h god came down in a blood cell not through a man by the holy ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god that is who jesus is and that holy one was filled with the holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went to jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of john in the river called jordan when the acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water god came and in dwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of of out of god was liberated to come back upon the sinner who accepted the accepted the christ as his savior look at this it says oh how striking it is jehovah born crying over a manure pile he's in a manger right amen uh born crying over a manure pile jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own theology and denied the truth of god look jehovah amen god a crying baby can you imagine that now i'm gonna tell you something amen uh you know brother branham says this now and i i i'ma just have to take what the prophet said uh he said that anna was blind when she came to jesus you know simeon and anna said anna was a blind woman that came came to jesus she had spent all the years there in the temple you know after the husband had passed away and he says anna was blind a blind prophetess that was coming to the lord jesus and i just imagine you know she got there and she was um uh uh uh just worshipping and praising and identifying that this is the savior of mankind and i can just imagine even as a baby knowing who this was even as a baby had anna maybe picked him up and just maybe he mistakenly you know how babies can get their hands and extremities and everything all together and maybe just mistakenly oh yeah i just believe if if anna would have just got a little touch from jesus i think her blindness would have went away even without them ever saying a prayer because the bible say lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i just believe that would have happened oh glory to god jehovah amen let's look at him now jehovah jehovah god a crime baby in a stinking barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our nose criticizing and acting as though we were somebody man here's your real sign this is the right one jehovah playing as a boy i want to ask if it was jehovah playing the day jehovah playing football jehovah playing soccer jehovah playing basketball jehovah playing baseball my god wouldn't you want jehovah on your team and i can imagine every time he got the ball glory to god maybe they give it to him and he start running and guys approaching them like they're going to tackle him and they just fall down and guys can't figure out what is going on here this man got some type of shield on him hallelujah amen he can't be hurt he can't be touched and that's the way we are we can't be hurt we can't be touched when when the devil tries to bring something that will hurt us what do we do glory to god and we keep pressing no [Applause] amen look at this jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter shop jehovah washing the feet of fishermen i would give you a sign and god another sign of white-collar priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all jehovah's standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow see i told you we got to go through if jesus went through some things we're going to have to go through we got to face our trials we don't run from them amen we run to them amen jehovah amen bleeding with thorns on his brown spit on his face mocked and said it no jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross i want you to get that while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross jehovah dying jehovah praying and nothing happening now that one get me right there i like that one jehovah praying and nothing happened how many of jehovah's offspring have prayed and seemed like nothing was happening but i'm gonna tell you when you're praying and it seems like nothing's happening just be certain of god hey i'm gonna tell you even when it looked like he not working he always working he never stopped working can i share just a quick testimony can i just inject this testimony we you know we're here in a different season we had our church that we were fellowshipping under and you know with uh there for 13 years but we knew it was the almighty god that allowed for a uh another church to come in and say we want to pay market rent for this spot market rent was 6 dollars a month now i think that's just way too much to be paying i think that's not good use of the finances that god gave us so we had to make a decision saying now we're not gonna take a three-year lease six thousand dollars a month we're not gonna do that and then on top of that now some of y'all might think this way but i don't think it's good as a christian to do this don't sign your name to a contract and say you're gonna do this and then break it in the middle of the contract that's not christianity that's a that's a pair that's a terrible testimony if you told them people you're going to stay there for three years it got to be something supernatural to get you out of that otherwise you owe them people that money we don't say amen to that but it's the truth in the house you sign your name to that contract your name got to be worth something so i was i said i'm not going to sign the name to the contract like that and and and we we owe this for all the time and we know that we're believing god to to to find our own space we're believing god for that so um uh you know we we've been working with a couple different people we got a particular building in our mind that we're we want to go after and amen and the lord bless me to have conversation with the pastor and just you know just just inform we're trying to put a formal offer together for him that's what we're trying to do so god kind of connected us through a number of things amen my daughter was at work and just happened to be working on this guy teeth my daughter sarah and and um while she cleaned the teeth to hear it hear him with the bible in his in his ear she's like well this guy must be a christian so actually going to get him checked i'd say but uh what church you go to they tell the name of the church and say well he said well what church you go to say well i go to this church and we're in the process of trying to find our own property we're trying to do this he said you know i think i can help you a lot say what he said she said okay well you called my daddy then amen here's his number you called my daddy amen that's the way to do it no you think you can help us out now you ain't talking to me you're going to talk to my daddy all right so so he called and and he put me in contact with somebody else and and then i set out me and the brother sat down and had lunch i mean breakfast with him and after we had breakfast uh he put us in contact with somebody else we just going through all these different people getting contacts i said okay all right we'll uh we'll just give them what they ask us for and and and recently they finally told us that you know y'all been approved up to a certain amount of money y'all been already approved i said well can y'all put that on paper and tell us you know so we can give this to to the people let them know that we're ready to close now right he said okay we'll work that out y'all just give us all this paperwork and we'll get something you know worked out for you and uh i said okay so as we're going through the process of of of getting all the paperwork from them uh i got an email this week from a guy that's working in the company that's trying to provide us financing and the guy you know as i saw the name he said jack duff it's so good to see your name on this paper he says uh he says i started this company after i left our previous job i started this company to help small churches get financing i started and so the guy that is that sent me an email used to be my boss i should say my boss's boss my boss's boss started this company and he said he said and and now he's watching over the process and i i i went to sister sister michelle because she told me when i got that job i was so i'm like well why you want me on this job why you want me why do you want me working here i mean i you know god i don't understand it and she said she said she said bro jack god gonna have you on that job you're gonna meet somebody's gonna be able to help us get our new church she told me that five six years ago and now this this guy was my boss's boss which means i know him personally all i can say is this he never stops working even when it seems like he's not working he never stops working hey and i and i can tell you something else all things work together for good to them that love god and to them who are the called according to his purpose what i'm learning to do is enjoy the journey [Applause] there's testimonies that's coming that's coming that's going to come along the entire journey let's just worship god in the midst of it my my my and i want to say thank you to your saints that believe god with us amen y'all standing with us thank god for you i appreciate that you know you you got the vision too you know we get ready to step into something we just going to wait on god and while we're waiting we'll keep praising oh hallelujah hallelujah amen jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross jehovah dying jehovah praying and nothing happening then jehovah died that is the sign for all men now there isn't another like it is the great one it goes on my it says then the darkness came upon the earth they put them in a tomb there he laid those three days and nights until until an earthquake shattered the gloom of night and it and and it came forth jehovah came forth said the story ain't over i don't care how how gloomy it looks for a son of god and for a daughter of god the story is not over and that that's that's why that's why brotherhood sweden can sing it's already done oh my amen you got to know that by revelation it's already done saying i'm just i'm just going through the motions but it's already done says this as he says uh they put him into very late three days and nights until the earthquake shattered the gloom of night and and he came forth jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on high then jehovah returned to indwell his church where is jehovah now where is jehovah jehovah's in you jehovah's in me glory to god amen to indwellis church jehovah came back with a mighty russian wind and flames of fire jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his people once more jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again jehovah heals the sick jehovah raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his plate on his face and lay unconscious in the gutter yes jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh jehovah came guarding us the hope of glory hallelujah this last says yes jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he come and redeemed his lost sheep glory he gave them eternal life they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raise them up at the last days hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them for they are the lambs and they follow him wherever he goes you know as i was just you know pondering this i went back and and looked at the scripture first john 3 that we read amen verse 1 and 2 i want to read it to you from the emphatic diaglot it says see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of god it's a it's a it's a honor it's an honor to be a child of god oh i i no i i i i i'm not just the son of of jack and ellen no i'm a child of god you're not the son of just whoever your parents are no you're a child of god and you weren't born here by the flesh the will of flesh or the will of man you were born by the will of god oh hallelujah you're not a mistake you're predestinated to be here for this season for this time for this hour amen beloved we are the children of no god where we come from no matter what nation we we represent we're the children of god because we all represent heaven oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it says beloved now we are the children of god and it has and it has not yet been seen what we shall be we know however that if he should appear we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is now i don't care what the devil tells you that you fell here you fell there that ain't got nothing to do with it amen my failures don't separate me from my position oh i love the lord jesus let me just read a few more quotes to you here is out of the message what was the holy ghost given for it says you know in the same chapter john 14 philip said lord show us the father and it will satisfy us jesus said i've been so long with you philip and you don't know me when you have seen me you have seen the father and why sayest doubt unto me show us the father god was made flesh now here it is the father was god over you that was the father we're saying we're saying we've been since adam god the father was over moses and the children of israel and a pill of fire then god with us in christ walk with us glory amen talk with us ate with us slept with us god over us got with us and now god in us all god was coming to christ oh christ was coming to the church what is it god working in you anywhere in the world if he want to call on you you're right here working in you to do his will how we ought to thank god for that god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in his church moving through each age working out his divine will he goes on when when when men make fun of you i love this when men make fun of you that thing about i was telling you how brother branham coming to school one day with his mama she won with his dad issue on that was man that was children children don't they don't have no filters they just let it fly man you can just imagine the embarrassment that he must have felt but they had no idea this man standing there with mama's shoe and that issue was the very fulfillment of scripture think about maybe some of the times people might have laughed at you because of who you were but they didn't realize they were laughing at a child of god look at this when men make fun of you they're not making fun of you say that when men make fun of you they're not making fun of you they're making fun of him that sent you oh i want to say that again when men make fun of you they're not making fun of you they're making fun of him that sent you so jesus said blessed are ye when men shall say all men of evil against you falsely for my sake blessed are you and again all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution for when god made himself known in christ they hated him who hated him worse the church the church hated him worse they hated him worse than the drunkard they hated him worse than than all the other people it was the church that hated him so therefore when you see cosmos the world order the world knoweth him not means means the church so-called knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as did receive him to them gave he the power to become sons of god to them that believed on his name oh how we should love him and worship him the purpose of god wanting to become in fellowship all right i i i thank god for this let me uh skip on a little bit more amen let me see here this last amen this this would be my last quote coming out of smyrna church age i just want you to understand church we got to recognize right now we are the sons and daughters of god we're not we're not going to be and can i can i can i can i say this you know when you're born into a particular family they want you to be on your best behavior because you're always representing that family name right and if anything goes down your name comes up and you represent the family right your name comes up your name is shown on the news and all that your name is what's representing the family your cousins know you you know and all and oh that's that's so and so that you don't want to do anything that's going to bring shame to your family i want to i want to encourage you don't do anything that's going to bring shame to your spiritual family you got to recognize who you are no you you're not just a man can i cannot you're not just some person just walking the earth god had a purpose and a plan for you being born that job that you have it's the god got a purpose and plan for you to have that job somebody he wants to reach while you're there amen you have to see yourself as more than what you really are you are a child of god that's i mean that's the greatest heritage that anyone can have is to know that i'm connected to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah here this is one of my favorite quotes i want to just read this and i'll i'll close here out of smyrna church it says now then uh here we are coming to a conclusion it says as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts and our term became the many member-spoken word seed i i i want y'all to get this one this is this is important we i mean in his thoughts we became the many members spoken word seed see he was manifest in the flesh but now we have been manifest in the flesh manifest in the flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we received and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened that's why we're in this church it's i mean look you could go to any church that you want to go to but no you come where they feeding you the word feeding you the truth right and it's because there's something in you that that that that longs for that you know when we heard this word uh no matter what our background was when we heard this word we've gone to church we don't we not been to church before we don't heard about what happened in the garden of eden but that stuff never settled with us somebody eating a fruit in the garden that just don't that don't seem to make no sense we just accepted it because everybody said it but it didn't make sense but when we come to this word and somebody said no it was adultery in the garden i said hey hey hey that makes sense hallelujah glory to god this word connects us this word bypasses amen uh all of our our our nationalities and all that this word is what connects us hallelujah in non-seed there is nothing to quicken hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word see bride my sheep hear my voice that means they hear the word and they follow me you are you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there's no change in species as we were in the thoughts of god and expressed in flesh there had there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of god amen we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i am returning to thee says the son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son amen we got we got many children of god out there just wandering aimlessly not recognizing that they are children of god we're praying for them amen a son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he's a son in fact a lot of true christians are like the story of the baby baby eagle that was hatched out under him you know that eagle is a type of the true believer amen well a farmer took an egg from an eagle's nest and he placed it under him in due time all the eagles under the hen hatched out the baby chicks got along fine with the mother hen but that little eagle could not figure out the clucking and scratching for food in the manure pile he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all hallelujah but one day from way up in the air the mother eagle that had laid the egg spied that little eagle on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to meet her he had never heard an eagle cry my god but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it but he was afraid to try amen there's that fear again amen again that mother screamed for him to rise in the wind and follow her and i noticed mama didn't come pick him up he had to use what he had he was born to fly and somehow he had to get over his sphere and start flying and some you're gonna have to overcome your fear and start doing what god called you to do glory hallelujah hallelujah uh he says uh he but he was afraid of trying again about that mother screamed for him to rise in the wind and follow her he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he tried amen beating his wings i love that i just got it all in my mind beating his wings he hurled himself into the air he'd never done this before he just jumped up my god hurled himself in the air and he and answering the cry of his mother he saw it off into the blue skies see i'm gonna tell you nature just kicked in once he got up glory hallelujah hallelujah amen says uh uh sought off to the blue skies you see he was always an eagle he acted like a chicken for a little while but it could not be satisfied see sometimes we act like the world we look like the world but we'll never be satisfied we might as well get back and start acting like a child of god because that's who we are hey i got representation somewhere else and it's not in the lower world amen it's in a heavenly atmosphere and it's time for me to act like heaven on earth all right you see he always wasn't he acted like a chicken for a little while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard the call of the great eagle he came to his own place and once a true son of god here's the cry of the spirit and how you're going to hear it by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in heavenly places in christ jesus i like that i like i'm seated right now in heavenly places you know i'm gonna tell you when you see it in the heavenly places you respond to things differently you act differently you know there's a lot of a lot of stuff going on in the world and and as christians we don't have to get all caught up in a lot of this stuff we don't you know one thing for me as i see you know they're everywhere you turn everywhere you turn i don't care where where i don't care what you do everywhere you turn somebody got some conspiracy somebody got another theory and we just be tracing this one and chasing that one so we don't need to do that as believers we got scripture that we're watching to be fulfilled amen hallelujah we got we got scriptures that that we're being watched i'm gonna tell you right now they cannot wipe out the population they can't do it and the reason they came to is because their scripture left to be fulfilled there's going to be a rapture there's going to be 144 000 come it's going to be a tribulation right some somehow they gonna make it through all this that i don't know how but they're gonna make it throughout god's word and it's not gonna fall to the ground and return void i don't care what people say so ain't no sense in us as believers walking around in fear amen i'm i'm not coming to church because of a vaccine or a virus that's not why i'm coming to church because i'm afraid i'm coming because i love god and i and i just can't wait to get in the presence of god with his people singing praises it just blessed my soul when i come but i'm not running from nothing that the devil's doing i'm not afraid of any of that amen if if i drink anything deadly it won't harm me that's what the bible says amen i might as well say this while i'm while i'm here you know somebody was asking me it's like uh bro jack can you give me a scripture or something uh for us for me not to take the vaccine that you can you know give to support not taking the vaccine so now i'm gonna be honest i i can't give you a specific scripture now you might have your own personal scripture but from the past i can't just give you something like that all right i mean you know there's a lot of stuff out there but i can't really get that because i i can go to this message and i can show you where brother branham prayed for these things they prayed that god would help them find a vaccine and and the reason i say that this is it's not the market obesity i know that much i know that much and the reason i can say that is because you know they had uh in in early days the salk vaccine is for people that was suffering from polio right and they had a vaccine for it now if if a vaccine is the mark of the beast it would have been the mark of the beast back then so i can't give you nothing like that but i will say this you have your own choice i will tell you that much you have your own choice but but you know you can't put this on god like that now this is not the mark of the reason i'll tell you what the mark of the beast is i can tell you what it is i know the vaccine is not that but i'll tell you what it is it is to reject the reveal not just the word the reveal word for your day that's the mark of the beast you can go back to cain and see that he had a mark placed on him and that mark was given to him because he rejected the reveal word because god told them exactly what to do and this vaccine ain't got nothing to do with the bible nothing now i'm not telling you to get it or not i ain't telling you none of that that's up to you but i will tell you you don't have to walk in fear whether you get it or don't get it you got to walk in fear i don't want people that got it fearing knows oh lord help me jesus i had i had an old friend of mine i had an old friend of mine she sent me a a i just all i did was say happy birthday i sent a text and said happy birthday and um she said jack i didn't know you were living here in palm beach county um maybe um maybe we can catch up for lunch say but she said do you have the vaccine and she put it out on social media for everybody to read it you know what i know what i did i never answered her i never answered it so if you won't go out with me because i don't have the vaccine we shouldn't go out you won't come to church and worship me with me because i don't have it where are your faith at where your faith at right i mean that's why i say this should never never be a thing to divide people don't let it divide people that's just nonsense actually this is a trick of the enemy this whole thing is a trick of the enemy and if you can't if you can't see that it just it just we just get a sight we don't we don't want to do that not here not here amen and i know there's closer quarters so if we have a meeting and we invite more churches y'all don't get afraid well it's going to be more people so what did that what that mean what that mean it's going to be more people you know you don't do that when you walk in walmart and see the see the parking lot full of cars you don't you don't never oh it's a lot of people in this walmart no you get out you find yourself a parking space and you walk right on in say man somebody [Applause] so if you if you can have faith to go to walmart you can still have faith to come to the house of god amen beloved now are we the children of god god richly bless you let's have a word of prayer amen as brother troy prepares to come father we just thank you for um your word helps us to see who we are and where we are not what we're gonna be no this is who we are right now sometimes it may not look like it may not feel like it but god we are who you said we are we are your children manifested thoughts of an eternal god brought forth in this season to show the world christ our families need to see christ our co-workers need to see christ amen uh whoever we come in contact when we're going into the restaurants people need to see christ lord we want them to see christ in us sometimes we walk through this world and just as you walk father the world that you came into the world in the world absolutely knew you not how could they miss the creator how could they miss the redeemer how could they miss the savior how could they do this blinded by other things in the world they missed you lord just trying to show even uh how many even miss your prophet that you sent and now they're missing your children your bride they're missing us but

the problem is a lot of us don't recognize who we are amen recognize who we are amen it was just so much so much in that message amen i trust that something was said amen to uh uh uh uh that you pack it under your feet and raise a little higher amen something to give you the little a little bit of strength and the courage to to just keep going amen we say keep walking amen so when the trials and the tribulations come amen shake those things off pack them under your feet and keep walking amen says amen that we are we are victorious amen you know another song here i i have on my heart amen and
