in the tomb but he's risen and i tell you there's thousands of sermons being preached today and no doubt this morning they're preaching about christ on the cross they're preaching about christ in a tomb they're preaching about baby jesus in a manger but we're preaching jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's alive and well amen i just want to declare this morning he's still given the holy ghost he's still saving the loss amen he's not lost any power he's not lost any ability but he's alive and well amen god bless you this morning we're certainly happy to be here with you we count on the privilege and honor and we certainly appreciate brother jack and giving us the opportunity to come and the invitation we want to remember him in prayer today and other services there in london we certainly appreciate him and just putting confidence in us to speak to you while he's away and amen i guess last time we was here i felt like we left a little piece of our hearts here with you amen and we're always thinking about you and praying for you with your building situation we know that god will make a way amen we're just looking to the lord just to speak to us and my what uh what a easter that they see as you know we we hear about having burdens sometimes and bearing burdens but could you imagine bearing every burden of every human being that would ever be born amen he buried those burdens upon his shoulders and i mean no wonder that his sweat turned to blood and we're just thankful for the price that he paid we could be here and i wonder just before we look to the word of god if we could just bow our heads and our hearts and maybe if you have a need on your life and you'd like to lift your hand and ask god to remember you and then maybe a sickness and maybe something you're battling and going through and you want him to remember you and let's just ask him to bless his father lord we're so honored to be in your presence this morning lord and we're thankful father to be in the presence of one another and to have fellowship with our fellow brothers and sisters but lord it's incomparable to the fellowship that we have with our lord and lord we're so glad to know that you're not in a tomb this morning lord but you're risen and what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is lord as your sons and daughters of god you have resurrected us lord or the gentile people that that didn't know your lord and gentile people that had nothing to do with you but oh father you resurrected us from deadness and you brought us to life as your sons and daughters we're thankful for this morning lord and lord we want to just invite your presence and your grace upon this service today lord we don't want you to be in the corner unwelcome and uninvited but lord i pray that every individual here would just begin to invite you to where they're standing at lord lord your arm ain't too short that it can't still reach lord there's not a situation that's too great lord there's not a problem to great lord that your hand of mercy can't reach to father and lord i pray that you would just come lord and make yourself visible this morning in the form of your word lord lord we're not here to see or to hear from one another but father we're here to see you high and lifted up in our midst lord you're the reason that we're gathered together this morning lord i pray lord may you take every word into your control every thought that's spoken lord may it be under your auspices lord your direction father or for every hand that was raised this morning behind that hand was a need lord and i pray this morning you'd meet each and every need according to your riches and glory lord we thank you lord for being here in our midst lord i pray that you'd anoint the gift of god in our lives which is only to get out of your way lord and may you anoint your children that they could hear and receive what they have need of when we leave the building lord we'll give you the praise for it in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we prayed and the church said amen and amen may god bless you this morning if you have your bibles i will go straight to the word of god i know you're in a school building but i don't know is there any time restraints as far as how long the service can be amen he said have my way so i mean we won't hold you all day but we do want to let the lord have his way we'd like to read in the book of romans in the eighth chapter we'll read in the second verse and we'd like to greet you this morning from our pastor for the josh bennett uh back in maiden north carolina we we just sent you greetings from him amen we're just looking forward to what god would do in our midst the book of romans in the eighth chapter we'll read the second verse we'll also turn to romans 7 and uh we've got just a couple places to read so we appreciate you standing with us the book of romans in the eighth chapter the second verse the bible would say this for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death amen the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free aren't you glad to know that we're free from the law of sin and death and therefore he's made us free the book of romans in the seventh chapter that will be just a chapter before and we'll read the 12th verse there the bible says this concerning the law amen we we live in a time that everybody you read something in the old testament and they say well that was the old testament that's just the law amen but christ never did away with the law but he fulfilled all the law is that correct and when romans 7 and 12 would read how the law was pure and holy wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good now to break the word of god is what we would call sin or in other words we would call it unbelief amen and to break the law it throws you into a state of debt amen so we understand that a law without a penalty is not a law so when you break the law you're under a penalty you're under a debt is that right amen romans 6 and 23 would read this for the wages of sin in other words the debt of sin to be paid is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord final place in the scripture the book of genesis the second chapter we'll read the 15th verse down to the 17th and then we'll let you be seated genesis 2 and 15 the bible says this in the beginning and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in that day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die we pray that god will bless the reading of his word as you may be seated just for a short amount of time i want to speak to you by the help of god on the subject of grace has met law's requirement amen grace has met law as a requirement david in the psalms and psalms 51 would teach us the way that we come into this world and we know that we were born into this world shaped in sin and iniquity and and david covers that here in psalms 51 and 4 he says now against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judge us and behold i was shaping in iniquity and then sin did my mother conceive me so we we can all agree this morning that when we were born we were flat-out lawbreakers amen we were born automatically breaking the law we was born a sinner we was born shaped in sin amen the very human nature was the nature to to send a man and to have unbelief and brother i'm going to say this in the message how can i overcome in 63 he was saying no see as i said at the beginning you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated amen you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people amongst defeated creeds i mean it's a pretty damn picture he's painting isn't it amongst defeated creeds defeated nominations and you've got to come to victory some way so so i just want to build a foundation in this and to show you by the law we are defeated creatures amen by the law we're a hundred percent defeated we've got no hope amen to keep the law and to live by the law we're a defeated people amen now in the book of leviticus it teaches us that a murderer shall be put to death in leviticus 24 and 17 in the law of moses the bible would say this and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death and you say well brother solomon i never killed nobody and never murdered anybody but actually that's that's incorrect amen we will amen when christ died amen he paid for the sins of the past paid for the sins of the present and paid for the sins of the future amen so even though you wasn't born amen there was still a amen christ still paid for every sin you would ever commit amen that was upon his shoulders amen and it was our sins that put him upon the cross so so that does away with the thought that we're not murderers we were born a murderer amen it was our sin that nailed him upon that cross is that correct i remember the man covers it here he says no you're just as guilty of his blood as pilate was it's on your hands you can't wash it off did you ever think about that so so by the law amen the law says that we should surely be put to death is that right amen a murderer shall be put to death now now that's the law that's in the bible amen so so we could say it this way this morning when we were born even as children i mean you're born with a debt that hangs over your head and when you're born and you see that debt is a debt that we have broken the laws of god we've broken the wall of god amen then that's the debt that amen any child amen even a child must come to the lord and receive salvation is that right amen so we're born with all of this debt that hangs upon our shoulders that's a 12 year old boy a 13 year old kid you're born with a debt that hangs over you that weighs upon your shoulders and what that dead is it's a debt that you have broken the law of god and you've broken the word of god amen but i want to give you some good news amen we focused on some negative here for a moment and i i want you to know everything that's in you you're completely defeated without him amen there's no hope amen without him amen there's simply no way to make it amen but grace met the requirement of the law amen we were born with all this debt hanging above us but grace has met the requirement of the law amen now law would keep us out of his presence amen if we would all be living by the law and didn't have grace we wouldn't be here this morning amen we could not step into the presence of a holy and pure god amen underneath the law amen amen let me just say it to you like this amen we're without hope to live under the law amen if it was just by the law none of us would be here we couldn't be in his presence amen we can never even get close to his presence because of the law amen let me say it there ain't anybody in here that has had any hope within yourself amen to come into the presence of the almighty god amen but because grace has met every requirement amen it has enabled us to come into the presence of him amen it's enabled us to be gathered together and to be in his midst hallelujah amen grace has met all the requirement of the law amen it's grace that has brought us into the presence of god now brother adam would pick this up there in the beginning amen and would teach that the first covenant that god established with man would be the adamic covenant it's the covenant that god made with adam amen and what that covenant was it's a covenant that means if you do this then i'll do this amen if you do this then i'll do this now you can eat of every tree in the garden but the tree in the midst of the garden you cannot eat so if you don't do this i'll do this amen it's a covenant that relies upon the works of a man amen it's a law that god establishes that relies on what you can do amen and that's the law that god established in the beginning was a law that if you do this then i'll do this that's the way that god started him amen god established a law with mankind and we find that immediately man broke that law amen man could not keep his side of the covenant up amen man it's in the literal dna of a man that he can't keep the word of god with his own strength amen the first man adam that was born and yet even himself he did not have enough string to keep the covenant of god to keep the law of god now listen that was not a surprise to god being that god is all-knowing god knew what adam would do before he did it but it was all in the great plan of god that god would even give him this law was to be able to display grace at the end amen so it was not a surprise amen that adam did what he did i mean it wasn't amen god wasn't shocked when adam couldn't keep his end of the deal amen he was not shot he wasn't surprised when adam couldn't keep the word he knew amen that adam didn't have the strength to keep the word of god and to keep the law of god but y'all would make a way even now see whenever there's a law there must be a payment of the penalty of the law you just bear with me as we build a foundation in this amen i'm going somewhere in it whenever there's a law amen the law is broken there must be a payment or there must be a penalty of the law now the message is the all-coming storm but the mom covers it here he says now god is just and he has law any law that is broken has to have a penalty to it now any law that is broken but has no penalty it is not a law you cannot break the laws of god without having to pay for it somewhere we i mean we agree with that you cannot break god's law without having to pay for the law somewhere amen you can't break the law without there being a penalty you must do what the bible said i mean now i want you to notice what god did after that the children amen in the garden of eden they broke the law of god amen now now god didn't say well you know i i guess you broke the law it's okay i'll just figure it out it's okay you amen no god kept up his end of the covenant he said the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die now listen god didn't just you know fold his arms and say well i guess it ain't a big deal he couldn't keep up his end of the deal he couldn't keep the law that i came but no god actually meant the law that he gave amen and when god puts the law in the bible even god himself must live by that law and god himself must operate by that law you say how can you say that because when god gave the law in the beginning that that day amen now listen no doubt god loved adam and eve as his first two children he loved him with all of his heart but yet when they broke the law god said i've got to keep what i've said i've got to keep the law i wrote this law my law was holy my law is pure i can't do away with it i've got to keep it because i god have put this law into effect but i want you to notice this god made the law amen and the law was pure the law is holy the law is just amen and he he knew brother solomon that he would break that law amen amen upon the knowledge of knowing he would break the law he would also make grace and he would make a way back from them that it broke the law i want to give you a picture here by the troy amen after they had broke the law of god god did watch amen god took a lamb i said god took a lamb amen they had all the debt of the law on them brother they now had condemnation for breaking the law of god they now had guilt they aim and adam can look over to eve and say i've never felt this way before i've never i've never felt sorrow like this i've never felt condemnation like this amen they have all these strange emotions that they're now dealing with amen they have all of this battle because they broke the law of god but notice when they broke the law of god it put god in action amen when they broke the law of god it put god in action and you say preacher what did god do god immediately what'd he do as he sent him out of the garden by the random dramatized it he said god went and took a lamb and he slayed that lamb is that right he slayed the lamb and he took the skin of that bloody lamb and he put that skin around his children amen and a parallels in the book of hebrews amen that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin amen amen in the scripture as it shows that how god even covered that lamb around his children he was given a prophecy all the way back in the book of genesis amen i'm covering you with the animal i'm covering you with the skins of the lamb and god was putting the prophecy in the scripture amen that one day amen there's gonna be another lamb that's gonna come there's gonna be another land and it won't be the last it won't be the blood of an animal but it will be my very own blood amen god put a prophecy all the way in the book of genesis as he put those lambskins around his children but let me say it to you like this brother all it did was cover up adam and eve all it did was cover them up even but he put a prophecy in there and it was a greater it was a greater lamb that was going to come into lambskin amen listen church amen the lambskin there in the beginning all it did was cover them up but the lamb that would be coming it would not only cover up the believer but it would abolish the sin it would not cover the sin it would take the nature of the sin and it would wash all the sin out of the believer i say o lamb of god how great thou art hallelujah i want you to notice this amen adam and eve didn't go kill a lamb adam and eve didn't go say well there's a lamb but god himself brother i said god himself went and slew a lamb amen you say preacher what are you saying this is what i'm saying god himself has made a sacrifice amen god himself has made a sacrifice for you brother amen god ain't looking for you to kill a lamb god ain't looking for you to say a lamb he's looking for you to accept the lamb that's already been given hallelujah amen now the first covenant amen was a covenant it would be called a workspace covenant thank you brother amen i want you to realize something though there wasn't anything after they broke the law of god there wasn't anything they could do to mend the fellowship there wasn't anything they could do to redeem themselves back to a pure estate amen let me say it to you like this there ain't any good works that you can do that can redeem yourself back to a perfect estate as a son and daughter of god amen let me just throw that out the window amen listen the the first covenant got started in the beginning it was a workspace covenant but we're not under the old covenant no longer we're not under a workspace covenant we're under an abrahamic covenant which is i have already done i have already you just accept what i have done i've already done it it's no longer relying on your works it's no longer relying on your ability i mean i don't know about you but that's from shouting ground god ain't relying on my ability god ain't relying on my good works god ain't relying on what i can do but he's relying on my lamb amen that has took my place hallelujah the faith of abraham by the way talks on that covenant he said no you know he said to abram amen adam and the adamic covenant if you'll not do this and you won't do that he said but see adam turned right around and broke it another place i want you to notice when god made his first covenant the adam covenant the adamic covenant he made it between him and adam and man turned right around and broke the covenant amen now listen these are the first two children of god and they couldn't do it brother and when they couldn't keep the law they couldn't fulfill the law they must say why would we think i mean why would we say that we we've got enough good works and a good i mean good enough church attendance that we can do it on our own brother let me say this your your very best works is a filthy rag in the side of god your very best ability god ain't looking for your abilities looking for your heart hallelujah amen every time god makes a covenant with man man breaks it every time he made a covenant with man man breaks his cabinet he does it yet today man will always break his covenant with god amen but god can't break his covenant with man amen man always breaks his covenant man has always tried to find some way to save himself isn't that the nature of man right there i mean we're always trying to figure it out on our own we're always trying to work ourselves into it i mean some of y'all know what i'm talking about some of your brothers i mean to get yourself in a bind and you know you can't fix it you know you can't do it and but as a man as human nature you're like well i'ma try it anyway even some of you know what i'm talking about well i don't really know how to take apart that engine but hey i'ma try it anyway i mean that's the nature of man want to get in want to fix it want to get in and make it better i remember listening church listen what the prophet saying man has always tried to find a way to save himself or to make himself he said it comes from a strand in the garden of eden when man realized he had sinned he tried to make himself a religion make himself a covering amen adam and eve sold fig leaves together and made themselves a religion he says and since it's been a strain of man down through the age trying to do something to save himself but you are saved by grace amen you are saved by grace not ability you are saved by grace not by law you are saved by grace not by good works hallelujah amen man cannot keep up his side in the covenant amen now i want you to notice amen the law of god you you you read and i mean throughout the whole book of leviticus it's very amazing if you actually study it out and look at the law in the book of leviticus it's very staggering to live by that law i couldn't imagine amen all the little ordinance to keep all the little things you can't do you can do amen but i want to cover just a little bit here amen and this is the requirement of being a priest in the bible in leviticus 21 and 17 we read it this way now speak unto aaron saying whatsoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god amen so there we have having a blemish don't let him approach the bread of his god for whatsoever man he be that hath the blemish he shall not approach a blind man or a lame he that hath a flat nose or anything superfluous or a man that has broken footed or broken hand or a crook back or a chore for amen or that hath a blemish in his eye or be scurvy or scribed or as stones be broken no man that hath the blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire he that hath the blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of god amen listen church this is amen this is covering probably most everybody in here those that have a crooked back those who have a flat nose though the cab those that have a blemish those that have this and this and this among those that have broken a bone i'm gonna listen these are the requirements of being a priest amen in the old testament and i was going to preach on this for a minute i mean amen ever since a young boy i got in an accident and i've had problems with my back keeping my posture straight now i know according to the law those were the crooked back you couldn't be a priest and some of y'all you've broken a bone according to the law you couldn't be a priest i mean you couldn't come to god and offer the bread of god amen according to the law those that have a blemish on their face those that have a scab on their face and when they couldn't approach god and offer the bread of god you say preacher what are you saying amen i want to show you the law in the bible amen listen church i mean this would disqualify many people in here as being a priest but listen church grace has met the requirement of the law amen grace has met the requirement of the law brother and those with the cricket nose and those with the with the blemish and those with their broken bone and those amen that's full of bodily problems and issues in the new covenant the new testament and the bible says that he hath made us kings and he has made us praise in the old testament with the joy it was impossible for you to come in and give our offering unto god it was impossible for us to come to the presence of god and give us our offering but ever since grace has met the requirement underneath the new covenant we can come into the house of god whereas presence he is and we can offer bread of praise and bread of worship those that were full of issues those that were full of problems those that were full of sin by the troy we have now been able to come in as a priest unto god and give sacrifice of praise and worship you say how can we do it because grace has met the requirements and god ain't looking at me god ain't looking at you he's not looking at your good words he's not looking at your clean living and your ability he's looking at your lamb hallelujah i want you to notice this even a priest in the bible he can meet all this criteria he could be i mean listen church this cuts this cuts out a lot of people doesn't it i know many of us we've had i mean these qualifications that cut out me i cut out many of you that's here amen but even if they fit all this criteria they still amen had to slay a lamb even though they met all this criteria they still had to slay a lamb and had to offer the lamb showing that the believer amen even your best amount of works even your cleanest living you can do brother even the greatest ability you've got it still requires a lamb hallelujah in other words the very best we can do still ain't enough our very best abilities still ain't good enough even the very best things we can offer is still ain't good enough amen now you still haven't islam and that just ain't fair we're we're not here living by the law and i i want to say this because there's some confusion in this amen people say well the law of god that was just the law and law don't mean nothing the law ain't good and allowing this do you realize that god himself wrote that law god himself brother so you're saying what god said don't mean anything amen god wrote something now don't confuse me i'm not saying we're living by the letter we're not but give me some grace in this amen god himself with a willie he put that law and ordinance it was the mind of god and god wrote that law and i want to read to you what god and what david would say about it in psalms 19 and 7 the law of the lord is perfect the law of the lord is perfect so when you want to say the lie no good go quote this scripture instead the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is pure making wise the simple the statutes of the lord are right rejoice in the heart the commandment of the lord is pure amen so let me go on record and say this there ain't nothing wrong with his word there ain't nothing wrong with his law i mean the only thing wrong is ask people amen they're not good enough to keep the law amen there ain't no problem with his word there ain't no problem with his law even the promised humanity that looks at the law and says well well i just don't know about that amen but let me give you some good words here amen we're not here trying to keep all the letter but we are here under grace amen for grace has met all the requirement of the law i want you to keep that in your mind even the law is good the law was perfect it's the mind of god and god established his law in the old testament and the message hear ye him but the womb talks about the law he says now the law only puts you in jail if he was under law probably most of us well all of us wouldn't be here because we're murderers we wouldn't be here if it was to the law everyone says the law puts you in jail the law puts you under condemnation the law magnifies it was to policemen that come and it caught you by the arm and said you're guilty and you're under the penalty of death amen the law has no redeeming grace but grace has come by jesus christ not by the law i don't plead the law i don't want nothing to do with the law i want grace this is the prophet of this generation i don't want nothing to do with the law i want grace hey man listen law was a policeman that caught you by the arm and said you're guilty amen law was a policeman that ran after you when you broke the laws of god and it said you're guilty let me just go on record and say it like this there ain't a single person in here that's not guilty under the law we are all guilty amen let me say that to you like this amen the devil didn't have to make anything up about us he didn't have to lie on us we we were actually sinners we actually sinned the devil didn't have to write a lie about us he had evidence brother we broke the law we were sinners i'm trying not to get ahead of myself i want to get to the good some of these other parts amen but listen church under the law we're completely guilty the devil didn't have to lie when he said you're guilty we were guilty but grace hallelujah but grace has met the requirement of the law as i said the penalty amen of breaking the law is death in romans 6 23 the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord so so in other words the penalty of our sin is death pretty hopeless case is it not the penalty of us breaking the law is death you say but it's on your awful negative i'm not i'm showing you something i'm in the penalty of breaking the law is death unless somebody else takes your penalty oh god unless somebody else pays the penalty now listen we're born debtors are we not as a little boy me being a little 13 year old kid i i had dead on my shoulders i i walked around as a teenager with debt i walked around as a boy with beds and then hanging up on my shoulders and the debt had to get paid brother the debt was death oh brother i said the debt was death so unless one came and paid the debt i was on death row you was on death row you was under a death sentence brother amen he was under 100 death sentence and you were guilty unless somebody else paid the debt unless somebody else paid the penalty amen now now we're going through the law here in leviticus 25 we'll talk about a kinsmen redeemer hallelujah amen in leviticus 25 and 48 after he that is sold he may be redeemed again one of us brethren may redeem him oh brother this is a kinsmen redeemer scripture this is the law saying that wants to be redeemed then it must be kin either his uncle or his uncle's science may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him or others family may redeem him or he be able he may redeem himself so according to the law the only one that could pay the penalty of redemption had to be kin amen now listen church god wrote this law did he not god wrote this law and in the back part of god's mind as he was writing it he was thinking one of these days i'm going to fulfill my very own law hallelujah one of these days i'm going to fulfill my very own law and the law said that it required a kinsmen redeemer to redeem a son or daughter so what did god do god said i wrote the law i must abide by my own law and he took a blood sale and created it and wrapped himself in the blood cell and he put it in the womb of a virgin and then jesus said i'm not just your master i am your brother hallelujah and god himself became one of us god himself became our friend he became our brother he became kin to us that he may redeem us you say preacher what are you saying i'm saying god has made the law and he had provided himself a sacrifice where he made the law and then he fulfilled the law hallelujah [Applause] he made the law he said well the law says it requires a kingman's word and a kinsmen redeemer so i guess the only way this is going to happen is i'm going to have to put on flesh oh brother amen so we were under the penalty of death hallelujah we was under the penalty of death and then grace wrapped himself in a blood cell and grace put himself in the womb of a virgin and then grace was a child and a manger amen then grace he fulfilled all the law hallelujah i feel like preaching on this i said grace fulfilled all the law amen the law said brother troy that the lamb must be spotless the lamb must be pure the lamb must be without blemish i say our lamb he was spotless he was sinless he was without blemish even pilate himself said why are you condemning him i find no fault in him and our lamb fulfilled every requirement to be our redeemer he fulfilled every requirement amen to be a kinsman redeemer to be our lamb and lamb paid the price hallelujah he walked the shores of galilee fulfilling the law fulfilling the law amen what did christ himself say brother willie he said i didn't come to do away with it i didn't come to abolish the law i didn't come to put away the law i come to fulfill so now you just don't have my words you have his i didn't come to do away with you say what was he fulfilling he was fulfilling every requirement that it took to be a kidsman redeemer he was fulfilling every requirement amen that it took to be the lamb i want you to notice something powerful in this i mean in the old covenant i remember when you was a sinner amen you went to go give a lamb is that right amen amen the sacrifice of the lamb sacrificed them an oxen when you went to shed blood aiming the priest would come to your household the priest would come to your household and whatever lamb you gave but you was looking that lamb over he was looking underneath his ears you were lifting up his leg he was being sure there was no blemish in the lamb he was being sure that the black that the lamb had no problems had no issues you opened up his mouth be sure all the teeth was in there i mean he did all you he was very careful on what lamb he was gonna give oh god he was very kind because your future relied on that lamb your future relied on that lamb so you was really careful when you was inspecting it and god i can imagine it they'd go and set that lamb out there and i want you to notice something in this the high priest wasn't looking at the person who gave the lamb the high priest wasn't looking for the solomon at the person's faults the person's failures the person's problems amen hallelujah amen the high priest wasn't looking at none of that but the high priest brother he was focused on the lamb because the lamb had to meet every requirement hallelujah brother and no doubt the person that gave that lamb they were all nervous thinking oh god oh god i hope that the lamb makes it i hope because he realized his future rested on that lamb amen and the priest examined the lamb and if it was spotless if they didn't have a blemish he said this one will do and let me say this amen god tested him god tried him amen god put him through everything he could go through amen at the end of it amen he came down and said this is my beloved son and who i am pleased he has fulfilled every requirement he has fulfilled all the law and then my debts my debts for breaking the laws of god hallelujah he paid it in full oh god the lamb took our place brother grace met the requirement he was fulfilling the law hallelujah aiming the priest brother the priest inspected that land very carefully i find no fault in it i want to give you some good news there was not any fault in our lamb there wasn't any problem in our lamb there wasn't any issue in our lamb he was the sinless virgin-born son of the almighty god and brother he fit every criteria to pay our debt amen he fit every i mean all the law it fit him just perfectly and he fulfilled everything that he had to hallelujah how many's thankful for your lamb and the message is the token brotherhood covers this here he says no he becomes both judge judge jury and attorney my stop what stopped so well no it's still going praise god amen he became both judge jury and attorney he pleaded our case and we found guilty by his own law amen that comes back into view now we were found guilty by his own law found guilty by his own law and he came and took the guilty person's place amen that was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and died and paid the price and shed his blood and give back his own token his own life remember him says it so beautifully he says why we are perfect and the case is dismissed amen there is no more sin to the believer amen we were found guilty but one took our debt and paid for it hallelujah as i said earlier even the devil had hard evidence against us we were guilty amen no doubt he could come to god say god he has broke this soreness he's broke this law he's broke this he's done this amen but then but then god amen turns to the jury amen and what's the jury say well i say he never done it in the first place turns to the attorney i mean the defendant what do you say i say i was there with him he never sinned in the first place church amen if god is your judge your jury is i mean if god is cheating or if the judge is jesus and the jury is jesus and the defendant is jesus amen church amen there ain't no way that we can stand here guilty any longer there ain't no way we can be condemned under the law any longer used to be brother we had the debt of sin on us we had the condemnation of sin that held on our shoulders but the scripture says there is there now for no condemnation to them that are in christ you say why preacher because he paid for it he paid for your condemnation what a price to pay amen isaiah 53 who have believed our report and and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground he had no form nor conless that we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire and he fulfilled that he fulfilled exactly what the scripture said he is despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all amen listen church every person under the sound of my voice god laid all of our iniquity on this man's shoulders amen church every sin you would commit he laid it on his shoulders i mean i i could just imagine so beautifully the man part of him he's thinking i don't know if i can do it brother joy he began to think of your sin he thinks of the time that you let him down he thinks of the time you failed him amen and no doubt it got hard for the lamb every now and then and he kept putting one foot in front of the other even brother solomon maybe he was seeing your sin and he hung his head down low and he saw the times we would fail him but he kept putting one foot in front of the other he kept putting foot after foot after foot but and he walked up that lonely hill you say why was he doing it grace was meeting all the requirement of law and the church it was not the three nails that kept him on that cross listen he could have called legion upon legion upon legion of angels at any moment but he thought about us and he said i want to pay their debts so they don't have to i want to pay their debt so they won't have to let me just preach to you on a minute amen church there ain't any debt that you owe there ain't any debt you've got to pay but your debt is paid in full and i want to let the devil know the devil i used to be guilty but he paid my debt devil we used to be bound but he paid my debt devil amen we used to be under your control but he paid my debt hallelujah amen and while he was here he figured you know what i'm just going to start paying for some stuff while i hear now what's the bible teach us the bible says brother willie he ascended on high and gave gifts to men now to give a gift you gotta pay for it don't you if i want to give a solomon a gift i gotta go to the store and go buy it do i not amen if christ was gonna give us something he was gonna pay for it so you know what he did amen no doubt he was walking the streets of jerusalem and then a little devil would get on his shoulders and say you know jesus you ain't ever going to make it who do you think you are and you know what jesus did he said devil who do you think you are and he took that devil and put it under his feet paid for it paid for it and then a headache come to him one day and here he is battling with a sickness amen the devil said you know why you you really ain't who you think you are and what did jesus do amen no doubt he could i mean give me some grace in this i mean maybe he rebuked that sickness i said you know what i'm going to pay for this and i'm going to conquer it and put it under my feet you realize the bible teaches that he subdued every devil and he must reign until he had put every devil underneath his feet is that right he must reign until he put every devil underneath his feet he said preacher what are you saying this is what i'm saying every single battle you will ever go through every single spirit you will ever face amen every single guilt every depression every anxiety every nervousness every sin everything on this slide by the joy that you're ever gonna face amen jesus paid the debt brother so you didn't have to hallelujah i said he paid it so you didn't have to and you say preacher i just want to be free this morning and i don't have freedom in my prayer life and i don't have freedom in my life brother oh god would you free me god would you free me amen you realize what the prophet taught us can i teach you what a prophet taught he said if he was here in a suit of close he would say i can't heal you i've already done it i can't free you i've already done it i can't deliver you i've already done it i can't heal you i've already done it i say church it's about time we start accepting what god has given us he paid for it i said he paid for it hallelujah if you're under condemnation this morning why don't you lift your hands and say god you have paid for my freedom if you're bound this morning and brother brown said i can't lay my hands on you and free you i can't do it i can't lay my hands on you and free you he's already freed you hallelujah i say jesus went on a shopping spree while he was here every devil he conquered it he conquered it he conquered everything he would ever come against he conquered it and he paid for the power to overcome it church we are now the sons and daughters of god he has made us accepted in the beloved and we are free our debt has been paid we are not bound we are free this morning hallelujah we are free from death we are free from sin we are free from addiction jesus has paid every debt and we are free y'all ain't hearing me this morning i said you're free church there ought to be a freedom in the house of god there ought to be a liberty in the house of god i don't know about you but if he paid for it by the way i'm gonna say jesus screaming jesus screaming i'm gonna say lord i receive your freedom this morning and if he paid for it he's ascended on high and he's giving gifts to men i'm going to be standing near with my arms open oh church he has won the victory this morning he has conquered every devil and i say if christ has conquered every devil so will we if he conquered depression so a way that they conquered complexes so will we hallelujah if he conquered discouragement so alive he paid for it and death is swallowed up in victory he paid for my victory you say preacher you look awful free this morning it's because i am he who the son of god has made free is free indeed we might as well be free we might as well aman be a free son of god he has paid for it and lord we receive it we receive it this morning he ascended on high and gave gifts to men and we receive it thank you sir you say preacher i don't think you ought to be shouting like that i don't think you ought to be acting like that you realize jesus himself i'm gonna get in trouble you're gonna go ahead and call me pentecostals i might as well keep going but the bible said jesus himself rejoiced in spirit he rejoiced that these things were hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed church and jesus could rejoice i tell you i studied that word out and it said a sudden burst of emotion that would cause one to spin that would cause one to jump so i say god if you did it when you was on earth so am i i'm gonna study it out it's in there the hebrew lexicon covers that church i see the liberties that my lord had when he was on i guarantee you this he was happy he was happy when he was on earth he had the victory over everything i'm in church there ain't no use and that's letting some devil have his way with our lives there ain't no use to not being free this morning there ain't no use to not being healed this morning there ain't no use to not being delivered this morning church he has paid for it i mean how long do we have to be taught these things he has paid for it just receive it in the name of the lord hallelujah thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ he led captivity captive that's what he did spirit of captivity would come grabbed a hold of it led captivity captive why'd he do it so you don't have to be captive hallelujah so you don't have to be captive he led captivity captive and church that ain't into the story he thought you know what while i'm here i might as well gonna conquer death go conquer hell go conquer the god i might as well i'm the virgin born son of god i meet every requirement of the law so when they put him in the tomb he said well i guess i'll just make my way to the devil's house and he descended where he was and there was the devil hallelujah there was the devil brother amen he opened up the door and said where are you at where are you at tell depression to come here tell anxiety to come here get all of them out here tell them to come to the door i thought you was just a prophet i i thought you were just i thought you were just another man of god he said look up to calvary my blood is still wet on the cross i am the virgin boy son of the living god give me the keys to death give me the keys to hell and get back to where you belong hallelujah give me the keys to bondage give me the preach the sickness give me the keys to every devil and get back where you belong he has conquered every devil [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so you ain't going to be finding me bound you ain't going to be finding me bound he's paid for it i mean you're getting it aren't you he's paid for it we ain't waiting for him to pay for it church i ain't trying to be mean but i'll say it this way you mean people say brother brother solomon i need deliverance i need freedom i need deliverance and they're saying god deliver me god deliver me must we crucify him again must we crucify him again lord heal me lord heal me must you crucify him again lord i lord free me must you crucify him again he's already done it hallelujah no wonder this is called the good news we are free [Applause] the bible in the book of hebrews says what he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities is that not what it says we can he can he can be touched by the feelings you realize by the choice he had to pay for that every emotion you would experience as a man he had to suffer through it he had to pay for it now now we read that scripture we think why it's nice he can be touched by how we feel but we don't grasp the depth of that amen every young person in here amen he went through he grew up as a tender plant he went through he knows what it's like to be a 10 year old he knows what it's like to be 15. what a paradox he knows what it's like to be 20 30. i mean everything that a man could go through he knows what it's like he paid for it amen so he could be touched when we're going through something man he hey man in his great mind he's like i remember what that felt like i remember what it felt like to be rejected i remember what it felt like to be turned down i remember what i felt like to feel like i didn't fit in nowhere i remember what it felt like aiming to have all kind of oppression around me amen the way that you feel church the way that you feel the infirmities amen he is touched by how you feel and i say he has paid for that he paid to know how you feel hallelujah god's covenant with abraham and a seed there's no need the christian people seem to get back in the corner oh i'm afraid what are you afraid about why you ought to be the most freest people in the world well brother adam when i get to the millennium i get to heaven i'm going to be free i get to head brother solomon i'm really going to worship god all by the time when i get to heaven i'm going to give every saying of god church i ain't waiting for the millennium i'm not waiting for heaven let me say it to you like this if jesus gave everything he had can i not if he gave everything he had can we not when i come to the house of god with a choice i'm there to give every saying that i have knowing that he gave every saying that he had so will i lord hallelujah already done it you see all it takes is accepting what he's done all it takes is accepting what he's paid for but listen let me say it like this a gift ain't a gift unless it's accepted now i could have something about buy it for brother choice over the troy i bought you this pocket watch brother brother i'm good i'm good but troy i bought you this pocket i want you to have it i thought about you i bought it for you but psalm you shouldn't have you really shouldn't have you shouldn't have done that now it ain't his if he don't accept it it ain't his you you're following me it ain't his unless he takes it from me amen let me see like this salvation ain't yours unless you take it from him the holy ghost ain't yours unless you take it from him sometimes we come to church god you really shouldn't have oh god come on somebody god you really shouldn't have i i know you paid for freedom you paid for healing but you really shouldn't have and we sat there with our needs not being met we sat there with chains of bondage come on church i'm not beating you up i'm trying to help you we sat there sometimes with chains of bondage saying lord you really shouldn't have and let me say this church you will sit there just as bound as bound can be you'll sit there just as sick as sick can be you will sit there just as guilty as guilty can be amen you will say they're just as condemned and just as low as low you can be church you can sit in that condition but i would to god this morning we would rise up from that condition and say lord i receive your free gift i receive what you have paid for the gift ain't a gift unless it's received even the gift ain't a gift and brother i'm cover said amen talks about abraham there a pardon ain't a pardon unless accepted as a pardon if you want liberty this morning liberty's here if you want healing this morning healing's here come on if you want salvation it's here you're staring it in the face this morning if you want to refill another holy ghost it's here if you won't deliver us this morning it's here stop looking for it and look at it stop
