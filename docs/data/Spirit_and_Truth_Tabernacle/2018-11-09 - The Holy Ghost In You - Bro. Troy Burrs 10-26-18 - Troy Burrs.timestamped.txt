[30:58] [Music]
[31:05] we've been doing some good things
[31:07] [Music]
[31:24] first of all I like to really think I'm
[31:26] for touching one spot something you
[31:31] might have heard Wednesday night
[31:33] Wednesday she went into the hospital we
[31:36] went away over the weekend comes back up
[31:38] a little bit we are went away for the
[31:40] weekend it's Orlando and after that trip
[31:43] on Monday she was supposed to fly on to
[31:47] Cleveland for doctor it's a pumpkinette
[31:49] in Cleveland and the whole weekend she
[31:52] wasn't feeling well and he said Sunday
[31:54] we went out and she just stayed in I'm
[31:56] sure the film but also she decided that
[31:59] she wasn't gonna make that trip she
[32:01] wasn't feeling good she was gonna come
[32:02] on home so she came back at home and
[32:06] Wednesday she wasn't really feeling good
[32:10] I woke up when I fixed the breakfast and
[32:12] she couldn't get out of bed and after
[32:15] after that I went on to work and my
[32:17] sister called me and said they'd taken
[32:19] her to the hospital you know because the
[32:21] doctor cause she had a test down
[32:23] previously the day before and they told
[32:26] her that she had blood clots on both our
[32:28] lungs and I'm said if she would have
[32:30] taken a trip she could she was that high
[32:33] risk for a stroke or a heart attack so I
[32:36] just we're gonna think up for the
[32:37] meeting
[32:38] you know this whole you know this leader
[32:41] hurts a state also just this yesterday I
[32:48] put an office in my supervisor and what
[32:52] so well I happened on full-time but it
[32:55] was like borderline force I know it's
[32:57] just the minimum time brings the one for
[33:18] that anybody else got a testimony they
[33:21] want to share tonight all right
[33:24] raise the Lord well amen don't worry
[33:28] y'all I'm gonna tell you I'm thinking
[33:33] God already in advance that bother you
[33:42] trying to get a job with sister Shonda
[33:44] working it cuz they given raises
[33:52] we try to build a building right so but
[33:56] we just thank God for things like I said
[33:58] we learned to appreciate where God break
[34:04] you from I remember a time where we was
[34:07] next to a bar and they would they would
[34:11] playing a lot worse music than this and
[34:12] you know it you you think you have my
[34:14] father's not trying to sit here and they
[34:18] play old Jam I'm trying to try to do
[34:22] that right and you're trying to get into
[34:24] the spirit and Oh glory count yourself
[34:29] so Mankato camera tap yeah hey but uh
[34:33] but you know we got a problem mighty
[34:35] long way in you know and I mean well we
[34:38] had the school next door we didn't have
[34:40] to worry about none of that so when we
[34:42] had to you know really relinquish the
[34:44] school anything could have happened and
[34:47] and we knew that this our landlord they
[34:50] constantly trying to get churches
[34:53] especially in this area because nobody
[34:56] wants to bring a business back here in
[34:57] the corner right you don't get any
[35:00] exposure anything like that so it's very
[35:01] hard for a business to be successful but
[35:04] as a landlord what they're doing is
[35:06] there's a business thing to them and
[35:07] they just got to bring in wherever they
[35:09] can get money and so churches are easy
[35:12] target when it comes to this but that's
[35:15] okay that's that's quite a rank we have
[35:17] to we've done it before we uh we gotta
[35:19] keep pressing though I will say if we
[35:21] can turn the game down on this ceiling
[35:23] might but we won't pick up that on the
[35:26] on the recording a man so but praise God
[35:30] a man God is good isn't he big man

[1:09:11] to the altar and the Lord visits you the
[1:09:16] law you you you you know something this
[1:09:18] happened he the promised saying you
[1:09:20] ought to with this thought you have laid
[1:09:21] the foundation of faith to do what now I
[1:09:27] read the scripture and seek you first to
[1:09:30] keep it our own advantages and things
[1:09:32] may be ad white fang's add to your faith
[1:09:34] virtue
[1:09:36] and to your virtue knowledge right
[1:09:40] temperance right patience brother the
[1:09:45] colonists and brother the times they man
[1:09:47] these other things that we are added to
[1:09:51] our life all right
[1:09:53] these are the things that must be able
[1:09:55] to man listen in the midden the message
[1:09:57] our blasphemous name
[1:09:58] he said now get this lesson here is
[1:10:01] what's wrong with the brand of Chavanel
[1:10:05] thing he said you see there is two
[1:10:10] different kinds of faith there's two
[1:10:15] different kinds of virtue all right he
[1:10:19] said there's two different kinds of
[1:10:22] match there's two different kinds of
[1:10:26] temperance all right hey man there's two
[1:10:29] different kinds of godliness
[1:10:32] he says one thing as prohibition is to
[1:10:40] know about talking about your the two
[1:10:41] different kinds of temperance he says
[1:10:43] one thinks it's prohibition they got
[1:10:46] they ain't got the kind of chippers that
[1:10:49] god is talking about
[1:10:50] it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper
[1:10:55] you got and the thing and things of that
[1:10:59] side fact that fast banking
[1:11:03] he says patience and so forth yeah he
[1:11:06] said there's a mockery of it listen I
[1:11:10] ain't pretending to be a nature giving
[1:11:15] faith a nature giving virtue there's a
[1:11:20] nature giving temperance all these
[1:11:24] things are nature giving and the biggest
[1:11:28] part of our faith is mental faith huh
[1:11:31] yeah ba get this and that by here
[1:11:38] the word it brings us to a mental
[1:11:43] recognition of God but if this coming
[1:11:47] from above
[1:11:49] oh brother if it ever strikes this there
[1:11:57] is a godly spiritual faith then what
[1:12:02] does that faith - faith recognizes only
[1:12:06] the word no matter what
[1:12:08] anything else says it only recognizes
[1:12:11] the word because in the beginning was
[1:12:14] the word and the Word was God
[1:12:17] in the Word was with God amen and the
[1:12:21] word is still God and the Word was made
[1:12:24] flesh and dwelt among us and when the
[1:12:27] word itself is pouring into our faith
[1:12:31] our mill - because our mental faith
[1:12:35] becomes a spiritual revelations and upon
[1:12:40] this fund this foundation now he said
[1:12:43] you've laid the foundation upon this
[1:12:46] foundation I'll build my church upon not
[1:12:51] upon the mental conception of Church
[1:12:53] joining a mental conception of that but
[1:12:56] upon the revelation right amen he goes
[1:13:00] into just a shepherd's dream now I don't
[1:13:07] know how you think you gonna give a
[1:13:12] faith of Revelation without coming to
[1:13:16] church
[1:13:16] how long I just don't see how you're
[1:13:19] gonna do it why because in any time you
[1:13:23] knew you wanted something that the Bible
[1:13:25] says how about amount the two or three
[1:13:27] later thank you establishment here
[1:13:29] everything gonna be staffed for two or
[1:13:31] three right he said when you shoot know
[1:13:34] whether be rightfully yeah you lighten
[1:13:38] up because you're gonna hit the target a
[1:13:40] rifle has two sights on it has one up
[1:13:44] here close and then it has another one
[1:13:47] down at the end of the barrel yes sir
[1:13:49] now what you have with the target
[1:13:55] because so what do you have to do
[1:14:19] but what do you have to do when you on
[1:14:25] your knees at home Mutato if the only
[1:14:29] time you get word is when you come to
[1:14:33] church you have no point of whether
[1:14:37] that's the only time you got nothing
[1:14:40] compared to compared nothing to you have
[1:14:43] to spend some time all set in the word
[1:14:47] was wonderful it's wonderful this is the
[1:14:51] Word of God and this is what we go back
[1:14:52] but I promise you my brothers and
[1:14:54] sisters unless that thing is filtered
[1:14:57] they had the scrolls in Jesus day and
[1:15:02] they missed him yes sir because they did
[1:15:05] not recognize Johnny back and what'd he
[1:15:09] say right they were listening to that
[1:15:12] wild man-eating locusts and honey coming
[1:15:15] out of the woods
[1:15:16] see he didn't think love right right see
[1:15:21] so they let that man crazy
[1:15:24] that meant crazy I know I didn't listen
[1:15:25] to him but see if the word always come
[1:15:29] to our administer say this and I haven't
[1:15:31] found it yet I may but I trust this
[1:15:34] minute he say the Prophet is the usher
[1:15:36] you went to the presence of the Lord all
[1:15:37] right all right
[1:15:39] amen you have to not only read your
[1:15:44] Bible but you read your Bible through
