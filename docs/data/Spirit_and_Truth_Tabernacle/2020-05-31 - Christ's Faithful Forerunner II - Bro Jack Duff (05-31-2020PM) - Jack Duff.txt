the email address that you use is giving that John four to three or if you have cash app also the church uses katnappe forgiving as well online so if you desire to do that just send it to cash simple spirit and truth tea amen praise the Lord let's just pray over our giving as a man and our service got we thank you for the opportunity we have to give you have been so good to us you've provided you've made a way you and you just done things in such a way God they don't even seem like we've been in a pandemic when it comes to giving Lord you you are on your mighty God an awesome God and Lord is it's our joy to be able to come back and bring something to the house of the Lord then the work of the Lord will prosper and the work of the Lord would go forward and God even how we look at throughout this time some churches will not open up again because of what they just experienced but God somehow someway you you supplied somehow someway God you made a way for us and we realize that scripture tells us except the Lord build the house they labor labor in vain accept the Lord watch over the city they that watch watch in vain so thank you for building this house and thank you for watching over it Lord have supplied every needs thank you I think that you have done and continue to do max look that you just continue to bless your people me you get back to them as they give to you

you'll see [Music] his son [Music] in a strength for each new day you see [Music] we were made the way [Applause] thank you sister ma'am let's turn our feet and read the scripture to scriptures ma'am like like my god my god what a very familiar scriptures we read this last week and we want to continue I thought on Christ's faithful forerunner want to read from Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 and then also from Revelation chapter 10 and verse 7 as we just continue our thought and it was just to me it's a blessing that we get a chance to open the Bible and then actually understand what we're eating right I mean if I just read it to this congregation you all know what that means right I mean you already know what it means and and it's just to me it's a beautiful thing you know we here are the folk you know and see how the Fogo to church and then you want to the purpose what was the purpose behind people gathering all right and some just want to go for shout some wanna jump you know or something like that but we come a man because we want the Word of God that we can draw closer to God a man he told us that if we were drawing not to him then he would also draw nigh to us a man I'm trying to become more like Jesus a man I want to walk like him I want to talk like him I want to act like him I a man you you trying to be like Jesus yes yes I sure am a man that is my goal to be like Christ I want people to mistake me for Jesus name so a man we have purpose for what we're doing a man we thank God for all things but let's let's read amen these scriptures Malachi chapter 4 a man - and I like to say to message believers this is very familiar a man verse 5 it says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet a man before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord a man and that's that's important is even before the coming of that greeting dreadful day of the Lord Elijah suppose have come and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse Amen so before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord actually occurs somebody's heart would have already been changed amen had their heart not been changed God would have come and smooth the earth with a curse so if I could put it this way because you hear judgment hasn't struck a man not the real thing a man we what we see is just kind of you know I would our practice a man but we ain't seen nothing yet the whirling see nothing yet but that's because you're here a mandate the blessings of God is upon you and you holding up some judgment all right all right let's look over here in Revelation 10 and verse 7 it says this but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen the mystery of God should be finished as you have declared two servants the prophets let's pray over God's Word father we thank you once again for the word of the Lord that has been arraigned and God as we would just endeavor upon this thought of Christ's faithful forerunner we trust Lord that she would just bring clarity and understanding to us and Lord I know sometimes as a believers that have been walking in this way for such a while we may take for granted some of the things that we we hear the things we believe but there are people God that are watching this maybe for the first time and maybe just through this season Lord of this pandemic they they didn't know where to go and they decided to tune into to this stream they could have tuned in anywhere you don't make mistakes you don't you know do things haphazardly you work according to predestination and father we just believe through your foreknowledge you would have people to be tuned in you have different ones that would come into the church in this season just a visit and in life circumstances put them in a place where they have to be here now again you're not making mistakes when you do things like that so help us to take our responsibility as believers and Lord to share truth with people because we realize we don't have much longer here so the truth is what's gonna make us free so Lauren speak truth to each and every heart today and bring revelation understanding your prophet said if revelations beyond us look up and ask God for so we're asking you Father to bring revelation today in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen again we are just continuing a thought on Christ's faithful forerunner we started this last week and we were using a quote about the faithful forerunner and I used it from spoken words original see but this this this this this particular sermon will will start from permian church age and I want to start with paragraph 170 3-3 a man perfect me in church age 173 - 3 this is pretty much the same quote that I was using last week but in the church age book it has been modified a little bit and you know we had different people just kind of writing and helping shape the words that the Prophet was presenting and so we get it a little different than the church's book but nonetheless the message is still the same a man in the census then King John the Baptist's Christ faithful forerunner so that's where our title is Christ faithful forerunner the mighty prophet for his date now and that whole statement says dim came John the Baptist Christ faithful full running full Runner the mighty prophet for his day so we know that the forerunner or a forerunner was John the Baptist we realized that a man let's go up says the mighty prophet was day he did not go to his father's school nor the school of the Pharisees he went to no denomination but out to the wilderness called there by God there he stayed unto the Lord sent him out with the message crying the Messiah is at hand praise God when we were in our denominational churches we didn't even know God sent a prophet a man they couldn't pick these things up in Scripture and share this with us amen most people that actually came to the understanding of God sent a prophet our people that actually left somewhere hallelujah somebody people that might have left a denominational Church people that might have left the things of the world people that you know left somewhere to come into this you you you you ran into a place where you got sick and tired a manner just playing games in church glory to God you got sick and tired of maybe somebody preaching the exact same thing over and over again with no substance amen to it you know you got sick and tired of Amen people avoiding certain parts of the scripture you just got tired of this you were you knew there was more to this than what you were hearing he meant you had to leave somewhere to come to this let's see be the name of the Lord hallelujah so you know we thank God it was God dealing with us why we were there and he brought us to this truth amen for a reason now you know I want to just saw we're gonna go back and circle back around to Amen some things we said last week and then we're gonna go forward that that quote that I just read said then came John the Baptist now that's not brother branham writing I mean I'm saying that that is actually the angel of the Lord tellin brother Branham to sing that amen the Angels identifying that John the Baptist was Christ's peaceful forerunner and I got I got a a man I was asking the question here last week the angel said that he was a mighty prophet for his day now if the angel gives a description of John and calls him a mighty prophet yet when I look in the Bible John never worked one miracle nobody was raised from the dead nobody was healed in his meetings nobody gave testimonies like that but he had a message to call people to repentance amen and then an angel says his man I mean he was a mighty prophet in his day the angel cornet and when you go back and look at all the other prophets Isaiah and Ayinde your knee and heel and heel I Jenny like shut you know Moses all these are the prophets how could the angel describe John the Baptist amen as a mighty prophet in his day well the reason that the angel called him that is because John's ministry and John's amen is it what his responsibility was is to introduce the Messiah Amen what greater ministry could you have than to introduce the Messiah and my other question is his first coming he has somebody to introduce his first coming should he also have another forerunner to introduce his second coming Amen we're not living in the days of the first coming so we can look back in scripture see well John a man fit this in John the indented and jogged in this for me we can see all that but we got to see how does it apply now because we're ready for his second coming blessed be the name of shirts don't let nobody take these scriptures from you [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we're not here by accident we're here because God promised that before the great and terrible day of the Lord we would be here he said somebody's heart was going to be turned he didn't put my name there but he put my condition there my heart needed to return Oh hallelujah man you just begin to think about how you got here some of the folk that brought you here where they act hey man hey man think about it glory to God but but you know you start losing now thank God for you being a conduit to bring me here Amen but I ain't going back now that now that I see what I see I'm not hallelujah all right now hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory all right so you know we were saying here if you were going to be a forerunner a man of the person said to take observation or act as a spy a scout a light armed soldier one who come in advance to a place where the rest are to follow there's so much there even a brother Brandon's ministry we see his ministry as Amen what we would call first fruit and the harvest amen he was a wave sheaf his ministry was wave sheaf ministry a man even in the manifestation of God in his life that he proven that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today forever that was wave sheaf type ministry amen because now when we face a problem our God is not we seen he lived a man in brother Brandon's ministries which shows that he still lives today Amen so if we run into some situation we need healing from a sickness if we apply the same promises and we watch God manifests himself hallelujah wave sheaf a many he was a forerunner went before showing us where we were coming light-armed sure the one who comes in events a place where the risks are to follow all the way up to going over there going into across the the bed of time Amen and going to heaven describing what it was like that's why I say anybody on YouTube that come up with a video Tom but I went to heaven amen I'm that's not following everybody that was ever a man if it don't line up with what the Prophet said amen I'm not following I put no confidence in it I don't care how good it sound appropriate already scouted the land he told us what it was like hallelujah hey man chirps glory to God so you know I'm gonna go on a prophetic understanding of these things so now let's look a men another definition set of forerunners one who comes in advance to the place where the rest will follow not use ie miles and and cushy on and on last weekend the the rest of the soldiers were get ready to come back in and report to David what had happened a man there in the battle and and here ah Hamas want to take off running but he he didn't see anything he had no message he had nothing that he could share but yet he wanted to run anyway my but but who she had something that he saw enjoyed saying tell the King what you saw and when he got there even though he was the last one to get there he was the one that had something to say hallelujah kind of reminds me you know we would you know if you come from the type of church that I come from with a what a preacher oh Jesus I feel good yeah I mean he'd get the girl you know his sermons about to close I'm not too close John God told me and then uh the organ player get the corn in the piano man and everybody get on they feel you to start worshiping they have to wait for the preacher to settle up hallelujah glory to God so so so I come from an environment like that if I could just be honest so when I started listening to the Prophet it was a little hard for me because he never wound it up preach the gospel Jesus probably never went around holding this here because it's not coming for you you know hard to hear some of the things because he was so accustomed to listen to other things that I was missing the truth I was looking for the show missing the truth a man gotta put on a show for nobody a Mary just brings you truth so when you listen to the Prophet you like you ain't on getting no humming a man you don't get no singing you're just gonna get straight to glory to God that's what we want amen so here the statement was made and we see John the Baptist fulfilling Isaiah 40 and 3 says the force of him that crops in the will disrepair either way in the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God we see John the Baptist fulfilling Malachi 3 and verse 1 the whole I was seeing my messenger that's a forerunner I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts now you know I finished last week's sermon with this quote out of influence a man because the scripture tells us plainly that John the Baptist was the forerunner we got that there was there's no doubt about it Jesus himself identify that and we'll hit that a little bit later but but here I just wanna I want to say I'm not this week I'm not talking about John the Baptist I mean that was for his first coming this week I'm talking about William Mary and Brandon because that is for his second coming glory to God even if you can say Amen the John the Baptist then you got to say man to who God is sending a man in this day for the second coming of the Lord and I asked the question over and over again if William area Branham is not the one that fulfill these scriptures please show me who the one you don't wanna do you want to know why I asked that question because in the world I see that somebody was sent to me you understand this was a problem at home I said you know I've said this before and I'm gonna say it again you know God was being nice I was being inclusive when he said behold I send you because my interpretation of that verse is behold I sin he made me Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day Lord I believe God was talking to me personally hallelujah so so so what I'm asking is that you know I mean since it's a personal scripture to me you have to tell me who the messenger was if we're your man Branham was not the messenger hallelujah glory to God alright and that shouldn't just be my feeling that should be everybody's feeling behold I see you I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gone I'm I'm trying to save something but I'm a humma I'm a glory to God glory to God glory to God let me see what I got here let me just see what I got here because I I might just need to change my my course yeah I'm gonna change it imma change my course praise the Lord I say you got to make that thing personal alright now we talk about a message and you know we just used a term so lightly a message the message the message the message and the senses you so lightly the quest and comes up at times from people that ain't gonna call them eight believers I'm gonna call them unbelievers i'ma call them confused and just need a man our supernatural fingers to unravel the knocks in their mind Amen so when they get a little knot in their mind they were asked you to question what is the message if I would suggest actually to raise your hand I can't see you online but if I just actually raise your hand I mean how many have been asked the question what is the message anybody been asked that question what is the message alright okay okay all right I'm glad she was honest amen so I'm gonna give you some answers to that particular question all today right amen and and what I did cuz this is if they want to know what is the message they can actually take the same program that you got on your telephone and they can actually put a little search criterion and say the message is this put that search criteria and then if you put the subscribe to you able to it would give you some things some quotes back to show you what the message is what did the prophets say that the message was now when I put in that search criteria I got 124 hits now you know what I can't read are 124 quotes to you I mean this service would never eat so what I decided to do is just get 20 is that all right I broke it down from 120 fold to 20 can you handle that alright so anybody answer the question what the message is you gonna have a take that you can point them to say my pastor preach Christ amen faithful forerunner part two and he answered that question just for you hallelujah my pastor he didn't have enough time to actually get all 124 quotes but if you want to here is the table put this for your phone and just put it in the search the message is just put that it and read 124 and if you don't get an answer after that I'm not sure if the message was for you so I got my own answers I'm gonna give you my answers I got seven and then I'm gonna give you twenty from the Prophet a man so my answers the message is a message of change and then the message is a message of redemption Amen the message is a message of God's love man the message is a message of salvation glory the message generates worship Amen the message is a message the message that's just my definition let me give you the prophets definition he says the message is of Jesus Christ and his glory you want to know what the message is the message is of Jesus Christ and his glory another thing he says about the message says the message is not altogether right on the letter they say the message is not altogether right on the letter but it's between the lines if you want to know what the message is you have [Music] because the message when between the message together write on the letter but it's between the lines the third thing the message is predicted to come for just exactly the way it is and before judgment strikes that's malachi for this message glory to god somebody another thing he says the message is so the message urgent we can't play games with we're gonna have to let people know what the truth is amen we happy to have people join us alive but the message is urgent hallelujah amen when when Locke was down there Amen in Sodom oh Jesus well I was in Sodom amen and the conditions were bad it was so bad that God was was coming to destroy brought himself into angels created bodies for himself and two angels they went down to visit Abraham and then they begin to reveal to Abraham what was getting ready to happen Abraham begin to enter soon you know just to be coming they were scouting out the land to see if what they heard was a bit about the wickedness and how evil it was talented in Sodom if it was time to destroy that place hallelujah when they saw the wickedness and here these men so fulfilling Minds a man that they want to get with lots lots visit us where the men that came in the sea we wanted we want them to come out we want to get to know them how wicked these men were right and we're not in those days again cuz Jesus said as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man so when Jesus comes again we're supposed to see wickedness like that in the land I ain't gonna even talking about politics but we know where certain political parties get into office more that it's promoted hallelujah it's the truth in it huh hey man it's all just a manifestation of Scripture I don't I don't have a problem I don't matter me what party you belong to the best part you can belong to it's the Christian party a man be a Christian above all things be a Christian alright alright alright but but the message became urgent because here the angels are coming to destroy this city and I&H a lot now for what we experienced of what we heard and not only what we heard but what we've experienced ourselves it's time for you to get your belongings and get out of here give whatever you can and get out of this get out of this side you haven't seen it now I'll tell you God is the message deserves a hallelujah don't be tryin to sit there and say maybe I could give them to change they're not gonna change come out now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ glory to God the message was urgent and he'd say hurry escape hither because I'm getting ready to destroy this place and as you leave don't even throw don't look back Oh hallelujah brother if you hear not can I tell you don't you look back don't you think about going back to where you came from God told you out and don't you turn around and go back to that Amen I speak that in the name of the Lord hallelujah the message is urgent amen another thing that the message is the message is the Holy Spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you do you want to know what the message is the message is the Holy Spirit taking the Word of God and giving it to you God sent me a prophet the message is come see who we found [Music] come and see man stop asking questions and comments even we found we found Chilly's us glory to God the message is come see you we found amen another thing the message is correcting the message is cutting the message is bruising if the message don't straighten you up something wrong somewhere Amen you come to this church in your tea I'll give you your toes again stepped on some time but you know it is Mickey better Christian glory to God amen the message is true glory them and the message is to God's children you want to know what the message is the message is to God's children not in a certain organization but to God's children a brother asked me a question say how come they don't notice on TV and they don't want this on TBN and the message is to God's children not ever you can't cast your pearls before swine they will trample on it can I go a little further tell you what the Prophet said now I'm only at number 9 can I go further number 10 the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is what he is Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same works that he did Marisa manifests himself through you the very same thing he did is the evening light it's English spoken of it's a hard way the message is heart oh that's one statement but here's another one the message is wonderful hallelujah Amen I got another one here amen the message is right that's why the prophecy I'm reading you cultural prophet amen the message is to you behold I said the message is to you glory to God the message he goes on the cities and now now we're looking at revelation 3 from this statement amen revelation one two and three we're looking at this he makes the stem say the message is address to the leader of the church that's a church age right the leader of the church god help that guy that'll pull away from that message amen but it was given to an angel and the angel was in his hand under his own control giving it thriving power from him from Christ right from his right hand there in his right hand that is there in supreme power wild here on the earth because they are the lights from him given the light to that church AC unto the Angel of the church addressed to the star of the age that is responsible the age of the church is responsible if he doesn't preach the word that's right and that angel will have to answer in the judgement so the message was given to the leader of the church you want to know what the message is that's what we're following what God gave the messenger for this age that's all this is God God said that in Revelation 1 2 and 3 these are not things that are outside the scripture here's another now you're gonna be you're gonna be kind of shocked at this one the message is over message is over and now we know that because revelation 10 told us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound has been already so people get upset came to a prophet because the message is over alright now watch this well sis now I said the message is over if you ain't got spiritual understanding you're gonna miss everything I'm saying the message is over finished alright oh and then the number 16 the messages have been being poured into the church the message is over but it's also be important to the church because we keep preaching the same thing over and over again God ain't sending another message so when we say the message is over God has already called his messenger his forerunner has already come did his job and now he's gone praise the Lord so I'm not looking for no eighth messenger to rise up nobody so you know the Lord said this was no no no if it ain't with what the prophet already said you can forget about it you you I can just already tell you yeah the only I told you a few weeks ago if you want to get an amen for me always give me what the Bible say and give me what the prophecy you're gonna get an amen for me but you start moving a little bit away from that it's gonna be Tiffany it's gonna be tough hallelujah we already have some vindicated oh my all we got to just follow that so the message is still being poured in to the church glory to God the message is still ringing through the halls can I get a gig give him two more I mean three more the message is on tape if you want to know what the message is [Applause] [Music] cuz the message is on tape here's one other the message is according to the Word of God and it's scientifically proven the message I'm telling the message is typically hanging in Washington DC now Olivia maybe maybe your messenger that you following got some in Washington DC praise the Lord tell us about it glory to God alright so the message is according to the Word of God and scientifically proven now here's the last one that I wrote I tell you I've just got there's 124 I just pulled 20 here's here's the 20th one the mat that's the way the message is you can't sympathize with it and say it's right but you got to take it to yourself and become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointest with you as it is with the others sorry man so the message must be accepted and you become part of and the message become part of you not sympathize with the actually become int hallelujah alright I'm sorry I just got tween I got it's 124 I just brought 220 I just want you to understand when we talk about this God had a full run in this day I mean no matter what has happened I've told you people people end up leaving church over over over hurt right and and the problem is this and I can tell you another reason why folk get hurt they faith in the wrong place they faith is in their own place your faith is in a human being but your faith should be in Jesus Christ right I mean Jesus won't hurt you right so so so I mean when you when you got your faith is in a person hey man you gonna get all you're gonna get all mixed up you know when that person falls you fall right a man as long as that person strong you strum them as soon as start having that person you know my faith thing like that look I've been I've been holding to this word for a long time I don't see many come and many go but to know what I'm still standing in the same place I was standing before they left praise Allah I'm standing with this word hallelujah Church amen I become one with my message there you already know when you're looking at him he's a message believer a man some some call your brand of mics and all that you just got the wrong interpretation yes I do follow what brother Brandon talked Amen but I and I do believe the message but this message is Christ revealed in this day alright let's go a little further hallelujah hallelujah let's go back to a man this this just quote out of pergamene church eh now I'm going back and bringing a couple sermons all together just through these quotes this is out a paragraph 172 4 is what we'll start and and with with with understanding what the message is now you know you realized that even in the children of Israel's days they were going into the promise then they had a message that they were following a man to come out of Egypt they had to follow a message right so as they were going into the Promised Land there were certain scriptures that were a men predicted for them to go they were holding to that message what was said to Abraham now this is this is uh what the Prophet was told to write he says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader this is what the angel saying Caleb represents those that stay true with Joshua my God my God my God Caleb represents those that stay true with Joshua remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word now you know if when you read your Bible when Joshua was called home there were still some others Amen that were left on the scene that was still holding to a Joshua and Caleb was was was was standing with right there was some others that what I would like to call elders in the camp and you know the children of Israel hallelujah they stay faithful as long as those elders were there as soon as the elders were taken off the scene they begin to grow in chaos and if we're not seeing the repeat of that that pain soon as the eldest left to see soon as they stop being able to hear us eyewitness testimonies they begin to succumb to the things of the world not me I'm not trying to hold hold on to this with everything I got how do I know you somebody listen it says Caleb represents those that stay true with Joshua remember God I started Israel as a virgin with this word but they wanted something different so did the last date church amen no that's how God did not move Israel or let her going to the promised land until it was its own appointed time the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader says the land is ours let's go and take it just one you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly something is wrong with you Amen I says but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them just take that down just for a second this testimony just kind of comes back to my spirit and I'll just share it we got an eyewitness a man that was living during the time of brother Branham experience the supernatural and it just so happened that during this time of even a pandemic I don't know how it happened but but they felt led to start releasing a whole bunch of videos from brother at Bisco and on YouTube they just got a whole bunch of our witness accounts he kind of refreshed the videos and and and made it more modern things like that same story same testimonies but it just made it more modern and you know as I've been just sitting listening to the videos my faith has just been reignited and I brother you know brother Brandon when we when we when we were listening to the message he's telling his own personal testimony different supernatural events that happened one of those supernatural events to happen was a God showed him he said I don't know whether it was a dream of whether was a vision he says when I go hunting I'm gonna get this animal I've never seen Adam before animal before but I saw hands in the vision and they measured the horns that animals 42 inches I don't know what it is but I normally get that because God showed it to me he says no on top of that God said imma get a Silvertip grizzly bear in the same hunt so brother Brandon was sharing all this and brother had been so happened to be the brother you know in that was supposed to be taking brother branham hunting and and brother branham shared all these things with brother and he said now they're supposed to be a young man he said about 18 years old to go with us and it's gonna be his hands and division he said now they're smothering a man with a green checkered shirt my brother Eddie as soon as he said green checkered shirt for the Eddie said now I know I got a green checkered shirt it says but because my it had been getting torn so much my wife had passed it up too many times I told my wife throw this shirt away give me another shirt well his wife a man was was trying to get to the store to get him another shirt couldn't make it to the store so she sewed it up again put it back in his bag and she said you don't even realize why you'd be doing certain things even she had to sew it up because that green shirt could not be in the garbage the green shirt was a part of the fishing it was part of the vision amen so she had to put that shirt back inside that luggage and when brother Eddie winter where he got him to he fell into some water when he went to change his clothes he saw the shirt he was upset that the shirt was there didn't even realize that he was a part of the vision well they had to begin to share so you know sometimes he said to be happening you just don't even know it just it's it's just unreal so he said but brother branham was so sure that he was going to get this this animal and it was it was in a certain area say he said this is the area I believe it is and he just they couldn't find arms he say all of sudden looked up he said what's that over there say they went over and guide the animals come back he said now before I get down to that camp there's supposed to be a grizzly bear brother brother but south would say ain't gonna be no grizzly I don't see no grizzly coming from nowhere brother say I'm sorry brother I don't mean to doubt you brother branham said andito brother they say it when God gives a vision it's gonna be exactly the way he said ain't nothin gonna stop it I got encouraged when I heard that because I know that angel has wrote a vision for the people in this day and I'm telling you right now ain't nothing gonna stop the vision you're singing gonna stop it your doubt ain't gonna stop it your unbelief angle stop it nothing will stop the vision if God had a prophet pick up spin and write somebody goes step into this kitchen brother Eddie say you know they were sitting there for the brother but say I'm sorry I don't see no no bear no where no what's my brother branham tells a story Little Dipper brother but being there he said not what happened he says we'd stop before we got back down to the camp and brother Branham kept looking around after where this bear was gonna come and I said brother I'm sorry nothing I'm being between here and now I started out you and brother branham looked up at the top of the mountain counter he said brother but what's that standing up there brother bud say oh that's that's sho nuff of grizzly that's a grizzly he said but brother and brother but was carrying the caribou back down he they shot the caribou he say ain't no way I'm gonna be able to either caribou here and try to go up there and get that grizzly he says why don't you just why don't we wait till tomorrow we'll go back up there and get him that's not what the vision sent the vision said I'm supposed to get the grizzly before I go back down into the camp brother branham knew what the vision saying so he thought brother bud say ain't no way you're gonna be able to shoot that animal from where you sitting brother Brahim said I can take them down right from here one bullet brother bud said I've been look man I've been hunting with people for all my life ain't no way you can do it he said if you give me permission i'ma shoot to shoot this grizzly brother branham pulled his gun out shot the grizzly and brother buzz story is when the buzz when the grizzly got shot the grizzly came down the mountain after brother branham and brother bud but he got so far maybe to the back of the church he was coming and when he got to maybe to the back of church he just dropped dead right there see when God give a vision it's gonna be exactly the way said brother branham set there knowing that when nothing gonna happen to him because God had given him the vision that was his trophy hallelujah see that's why when I look at these these quotes here I'm preaching vision to the church and I and I'm just preaching what God has already called us to I'm just I'm all I'm doing this echoing what he said and this what we're gonna walk in I don't I'm not looking at this I'm not looking at that I'm looking at what God said in his word hallelujah the vision don't lie everything that he told those brothers came to pass with that we're getting that bad I mean getting to get in the Silvertip grizzly and getting the 42-inch caribou everything brother brother but son was supposed to go on the hunt and brother brother Eddie knew that this man was supposed to go in the hunt he was supposed to be somewhere else and it went down there to pick up brother blood and here comes the Sun walking out the house and brother brother Eddie said I thought you're supposed to be working so yeah they let me out for a couple days so I can come join the hunt and I brother brother Eddie just it just problems say how old are you young man how old are you you say wow I just need to know how old are you 18 that's exactly what the Prophet said a young man about 18 years old his hands would be there measuring the animal mmm god is good we not we're not we're not following a man a man to be following a man we following a man as he follows Christ can I feed can I keep reading this quote here I want to keep reading just a couple of things I want to share it says but Joshua was a godsend property and he knew the promise of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time come to move God placed a full leadership in Johnson and now I was I was saying all that to say this brother brother Eddie Bisco said the vision took six hours to actually complete so you got to learn to be patient when you're dealing with a vision so as a pastime preaches but I got to be patient and wait for the people to come in line with what they what they hear so yeah you might be living here but I'm not gonna preach here i'ma preach here because that's gonna make you come up here glory to God hallelujah amen amen God see what you're doing God see it everybody else see it amen but we sit on preached here because you're a part of a vision all right listen he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time come to move place the full leadership of Josh in Joshua's hands because he stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so will it repeat in this in this day same problem same precious people can't stay with the word they get ahead of the word get too excited and actually get ahead of the work we're gonna stay with the word let the word do the leading let the word do the leading amen no I'm gonna say that again we're gonna let the Word of God do the leading that means gifts will not do the leading the Word of God will do the leading amen all right Moses gift got him in trouble y'all ain't heard it Moses stop following the word and start following his gift the word said speak to the rock but the gift said hit the rock do you know what the gift got what it wanted but a miss miss what God had intended for it and he could even go to the promised land because he disobeyed the word all right now I'm reading the vision this is what the vision says right so look at this now same problem same pressures he says think is that what we see in Moses this mighty anointed prophet of God had a peculiar birth well really got being born at the right time for the deliverance of Abraham's seed from Egypt he never stayed in Egypt to argue Scripture with with them nor fussed at the priest he went to the witness until the people were ready to receive him God called Moses to the wilderness the waiting was not on Moses part but the part but because of the people who were not ready to receive him Moses thought the people would understand but they did not hallelujah glory to God let's go on now it's very easy for us to try to take these quotes and apply them to ourself but keep them keep them in context now he's talking about his ministry we talk about Christ's faithful forerunner and from what I know none of us have been called to be the forerunner can I say that again from what I know none of had been called to be the forerunner the forerunner has come and gone all right praise the Lord I told you we're not looking for our minds I'm gonna take off running you ain't got no message bro since you ain't got no message don't take off running nine and Joab total you ain't got nothing to say let me run anyway you ain't got nothing to say and when he got that to the king he just praise the Lord King live forever yeah you try to you know stroke his ego and it is thank you thank you for that my son Absalom anything you got any news about him I saw a pile of rocks but I didn't know what was behind the rocks stand in the kkona stand to the side we don't even need to hear any more you got to say we'll wait for cushy cushy could tell him what happened praise the Lord hey man we already had it we already got a cushy will your Marion Brandon he's already tell us what happens we got that we don't need nothing else glory all right now let's go on I'm going on it says then there is Elisha whom the word of the Lord came when he got through preaching the truth and that group back there that this that is the forerunner of American Jezebel group would not receive the word God called them off the field and plague that generation for rejecting the prophet and the messenger that God had given God called him to the wilderness and he would not come out even for the king those who tried to persuade him to do so died but God spoke to his faithful prophet by vision out of hiding he came and brought back brought back the word to Israel then came John the Baptist's Christ faithful forerunner the mighty prophet for his day he did not go to his father's school nor the school of the Pharisees he went to no denomination but out to the wilderness a man called there by God there he stayed until the Lord sent him out with the message crying the message is at hand now I just got a couple of statements that I want to make here I read a quote I don't know if I don't remember read this again but brother Branham just made the statement there was never a man born of woman like John like him or could compare with him until that time a man until that time now we got somebody can compare to John because his ministry is also called amen to introduce Christ at the second coming Amen now look at this I wrote this when the angel said take the example we see in Moses he was called to the wilderness and had to wait for the people that catch up with the vision amen the people did not understand that God was trying to fulfill his word of promise through the life of Moses do you know the same thing that's happened today Amen God has got to still wait for people to catch up with the vision of what he has already done through the Ministry of we American Brenham amen also says Elijah came on the scene with mighty supernatural vindications he called down fire he called for ring he outran a horse-drawn chariot and was commissioned to turn the hearts of the people back to God yet with all that supernatural the people still rejected this ministry and were plagued hey man brother Branham wrote was wrote the angel told him write about John the maps says Dave came John the Baptist Christ faithful full runner the mighty prophet for his day the angel described in his mighty even though he had a ministry that only lasted six months he never performed the miracle he only preached repent of parish and was considered the greatest prophet of all prophets he was Dean mighty according to the scripture and the reason he was given that title is because he introduced the Messiah where did he introduce the Messiah John 1:29 look at this John 1:29 he introduces the Messiah in this verse he says the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto Him where did John introduce the Messiah in water baptism why Joe was baptized Jesus comes to charm in the reason Jesus came to John is because the sacrifice had to be washed before it could be hurt and here comes Jesus out to John in the water at water baptism and John says a man jumped out the Bible say the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin Jesus Christ faithful he was the supernatural Curt somebody in the same place that John was in the water turn turn introduced Messiah in the introduced Messiah and notice where they say your message your message you want to know the message is the message is an introduction to the Messiah [Applause] all right now I want to read a quote for you she does not air with a shucks even it's his his titles it's there was a message even in the title the seed is not air with the shucks look at this way to say just about six months after that I had my first baptism down here on the river when the light came down right here at Spring Street many of you people might want to go down and take a look at it at Spring Street and water now you know we take that down just for a second I just gotta I there was a recent video that come out where they they they criticize people for coming to Jeffersonville and just you know looking at prop of the prophet's grave and going to so many places that he talked about where these supernatural experience they like you know they they call us a cult for doing these things look when you know I've gone to England to John Wesley's house seen his pulpit seen his prayer room John Wesley who was the leader not really he just started a Methodist Church they started after him right but John Wesley now when I go to John Wesley's house you call me a cop no the supernatural was in his house in his prayer room brother Branham said he went there and he still felt the presence of the angel so when I go to follow that minister that God used in this hour now not when everybody go to Billy Graham's they not considered a cult but as when we go to William Branham that we consider the coat right a man no no something wrong the God God used this ministry in a very unique way right so you know there's been a lot of criticism you know that's been been coming up and everything but this is so quote was just saying here it says many of you people might want to go down and take a look at it now when it when you can leave it there so she could leave it there to say this real quick brother Mike a man a few years ago went down to this same spot a man while he was visiting in injection severe went down to Spring Street where where brother Brad was baptizing these people glory to God and brother Mike and and I think I can't remember the other young brothers name right now military they took a picture and the pillar of fire showed up on the picture I'll tell the people that live right here in West Palm Beach Amy they took a picture the pillar fire shut up in the in that same area where brother Brandon was baptizing years later the pillow-fight still showed up in there you want to tell me this ain't this ain't got hallelujah glory to God now I'm not saying it's gonna show up when you go I'm just saying praise the Lord he's still here he still vindicated his words glory to God and I might as well say like this when we share testimonies like that that isn't for everybody to believe it's for the believer it's just an encouragement to the believer everybody else to look at you like you're crazy but I believe accepts it they believe the believer beliefs glory to God let me finish reading this Pope now he says how many of you people might want to go down and take a look at it at Spring Street and water right at the riverfront and there is where the angel Lord appeared in public first and at two o'clock one afternoon and a voice came from it and said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming this is 30 years later and Here I am still tonight proclaiming that message and around the world is whipped and I'm glad to be back in my hometown tonight to represent this Lord Jesus Christ that I still love with all my heart each day he stood grow still sweeter than he was today before I've never changed one iota in my doctrine the first thing I started with I still believe the same thing tonight he's the same yesterday today forever now I have a message that I'm responsible for I like I like these statements that he makes I have a message that I'm responsible for a man I want to read another quote here out of I heard but now it's but now I see I have a message that I'm responsible I was just thank you say you know even when I was a lad there was a calling on my life yeah I'm gonna go a little further before I was born there was a calling on my life but I want to say it like this I'm glad that I did not come to the maturity of that calling until I actually come underneath the influence of the message otherwise I'd be standing you in my ear trying to work out look no I'm just gonna preach the word hallelujah Amen brother branham ordained brothers to preach the message so you told him say brother we are ordaining but we preaching a message we're preaching to met God is holding us accountable to a message to preach to the people we're not just we just not sitting preaches out do you want to preach the message amen he had that and the brother said yes that's what I want to do all right now will ordain you to preach the message you know you know in the in the Baptist Church they do ordain you to preach Baptist doctrine Oh y'all ain't heard that's why brother Branham ended up leaving the Baptist Church because he could support the doctrine it was against the word Pentecostals want you to preach Pentecostal doctrine Methodists want you to preach Methodist doctrine and this message we want you to preach the message all right any number the truth anyhow look if I wanna if I wanted that I just Amen it's the truth in it huh I want to hear the message that's what that's what I feed off of glory to God don't give me that hey man I've been there and done it I don't want no more that hallelujah no all it does is just satisfy your flesh hey man girl you want and if some I'm a preaching against no sin and nothing anything going to church your toes never get stepped on God loves you and you wake up like that sister that was in the hospital preacher told her you know it's all right he outside smoking cigarettes why he tell her it's all right you're gonna be all right there and then other son she saw she saw demons with chains coming to take away and she looked at the preacher he they say it's like she's going crazy no she was going crazy she said you preacher you lied to them and you lied to me now I'm lost I'm lost you lied to me she was on her way out of here going to hell nobody I told her the truth so we might as well since the message is so urgent we need to tell you the truth we ain't got much longer here the world can't take too many more pandemics like this and i'ma tell you this I can't take too many more I'm praying even so come Lord Jesus you come out of pandemic and then other things start happening and craziness it's all over the place amen glory was locked up in our house now we come out oh lord have mercy Florida God hey man I'm trying to stay away from these things but we're not gonna get into politics here in the pulpit amen but I tell you it's just a devil that's been loosed in the land y'all better be be mindful this don't get yourself all wrapped up in all this type of stuff it's a devil that has been loosed in the land a man glory to God and you find yourself all wrapped up and saying this and you got a sign in your hand and you I hear next thing you know you and you you know I got swept away into something you don't even know what you in and you take the fall for somebody thanking you representing something now I tell you what you represent represent Christ amen amen amen glory to God the only thing unchanging is Jesus a man the only thing gonna change it is Jesus if people don't get Jesus it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse a man Oh God and two wrongs don't make a right two wrongs do not make a right a man glory to God you know you now you came gee that don't give you a license to murder you understand that'll give you a license to kill and man that's murder is wrong whether it happened to anybody is wrong and they'll give you a just because I mean you got to look at how God handled murder at the beginning amen I'll tell you God Oh Lord I mean nice now they they don't want you to give no grace to know about it grace yeah pray for everybody yes pray for everybody everybody's impacted here pray for everybody amen that's right what a God do it to get beginning with King and what it Adam Eve do we came right just just go back to the beginning if we start in Genesis we end up right if everybody go back to it if they'll go back but someone don't want to be led by the scripture so let me let me finish I want to read this I'm coming home this is not a message I've heard but now I see Oh Lord says now we're promised a church age to reformers and we've had them but but but he promised in Malachi 4 he keep his powder in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic father for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms this is why God had to send a forerunner a voice to call us out of denominationalism and call us back to the word the scripture says that our hearts would be turned back to the faith of the fathers which means our hearts were turned back to what God said in his word from Genesis all the way to Revelation we would believe a man so it says for that very purpose in the churches so broke up in denomination and isms it is so tore to pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier that means you were there you had some life but you had to come away from that amen and and then he promised and the hour of the 7 angels message revelation 10 7 and our the seventh angels message and let me also tell you revelation 10 7 is the fulfillment also of revelation 3:14 alright glory to God it's the same angel since the ministries of God would be declared revelation 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message now look at this not the healing service the message that follows the healing service si si si si or Roberts had a healing service brother Branham had a healing service Jack Co had healing services a man there was many others during that time they all had healing services everybody had healing campaigns but the message was following the healing campaign it was a it was just not the sign of the healing services but it was the voice after the sign hallelujah do you know Jesus had a healing campaign Amen but then when he forgetting to preach his message unless you eat this flesh drink this you have no part of me when they begin to preach this message that's when people reject it and when brother Brandon begin to bring truth that's when people begin to walk away it's the same thing repeating itself today hallelujah but we're holding on to the message what what are these things that that was you know I'll just i'ma just say this Jesus himself identified John the Baptist ministry as the first forerunner amen Jesus identified it I'm gonna go back and just read this real quick Matthew Matthew 11 verse 10 and 11 I read this last week but I'll read it to you again this is Jesus identifying John's ministry and I got good news for you that same Jesus identified William branham's ministry hallelujah I told you the message is on tape all you gotta do is go and listen to the tapes read the books amen his messages his sermons you'll get everything that I'm giving you hey man here Jesus says Matthew 11 10 through 11 for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is at least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and as I told you Jesus could say that because up until that time there had not been one born as great as John the Baptist and the reason John the Baptist minister was so great is because he introduced Messiah so if you have another person with the same spirit of Elijah on them introducing Messiah at his second coming or his message is introducing it in the side the second he's just as great as John the Baptist and Jesus eyes amen now I could tell you you got to read between the lines if you want to know the message now how do we know that it's just as great and Jesus asked I told you early in 1933 the angel the Lord was heard declaring as John the Baptist for ran my first coming your message will forerun my second coming amen another thing that happened when brother Branham preached revelation chapter 1 revelation chapter through 2 and Revelation chapter 3 1 1 2 and 3 he titled the sermon a man exposition of the seven Church Ages after brother Branham which we have this right here on the wall amen he preached he preached what the seven churches well he preached who the stars were the messengers he gave us the revelation of this in the scripture according to scripture and then he told us that the the timeline of the ages he gave us everything about it he preached it and that they preached it where most are to stay away from the book of Revelation we feast in we feast now and at the end of preaching after he wrote at this chart himself he wrote it out and then preached it and at in the preaching on the back wall of the church the angel the Lord's the same angel that came in Nebuchadnezzar's day and wrote on the wall the same manger came again and wrote the chart that we see right here on the back of the wall now you tell me who preaching the Book of Revelations and having an angel coming right on the wall and tell me that that's not God vindicating his word the same Jesus that vindicated John the Baptist same Jesus that was vindicated William and Brandon brother Branham when he preached before he preached the seven seals they're found in the Book of Revelations before he preached that supernaturally was of it was visited by seven angels who commissioned him and the angels had their picture taken they were in the form of a cloud mystery cloud they have a recorder in and I believe Life magazine they got a record at 1963 here this mystery clown there some have actually said it was a jet that formed this cloud but a prophet told us that it was not eject it was seven angels and he said now they see the picture one way but he did not go to them and tell them what to do with the picture he only came to us and he said turn the picture to the right you'll see is Jesus that was Jesus vindicating his prophet Christ faithful forerunner and I got one more for you doctor best in Houston was just upset by brother Branham preaching and people in his church being healed he said now this Saint this same true I know and say I will debate you on it for the RAM state no I'm not gonna argue over the scripture but brother Bosworth who lived in Miami but I'm saying look I take up the argument brother brother brother he say I'll take him to debate he says I just don't argue with him brother Bosworth they say no I want to argue with him I promise you I won't argue with him they say okay if you won't argue with my alleged I let you do it brother Bosworth walked out there you talk about a soldier in his 80s walking out there to the platform and had just one question doctor best we're here to talk about the word doctor bass they said yeah he said go get that go get that that healer I'll show them right now I show me he's just doing all kind of crazy things got his fist and brother Bosworth face and you know just do it and take a picture take a picture you know don't all kind of all kind of crazies brother Bosworth said I've just got one question are the seven compound names of Jehovah that's found in the Old Testament are they connected to the Lord Jesus Christ Bosworth knew right there he had him the man couldn't say nothing right because if he's the same yesterday today and forever they got to be connected amen and Bosworth say he he gonna demand was done had all that feel theology all that schooling was was reduced down to one question is is the seven compound names of Jehovah that you read in the Old Testament are they connected to the Lord Jesus Christ because if they are then he's gonna be healing today just as he healed back then you say no just go get there go get the faith healer I don't need to talk to you say I mean you just alright this debate is over it's not even a debate it's done brother ran was sitting up in the top of the bleachers there and and and and and just so brother Bosworth said you know brother Branham is in the building if he want to come down and greet the audience he's certainly welcome to but this debate is over dr. bass had nothing to say so brother Branham got up and slowly walked on down in Houston Coliseum he walked down to the platform they got there to the platform and you know just thinking the brothers for you know how they handle things and everything and and there was a photographer that doctor best hired he hired right he was supposed to be on the enemy side so the photographer taking pictures just snapping off so so so so when brother Brando get up there the photographer taking pictures taking pictures went back to the after the service was over went back to Winnie where they process the pictures and all the ones he took a doctor bests nothing but the one he took a brother Brandon was taken and then there was a supernatural halo on the top of brother branham's hand and he looked at us and I this is kind of strange nobody saw the supernatural being in the audience but yet he showed up on the picture and when they when they certainly had to get that they wanted to get the like an FBI specialist to come in and look at this picture and you know and just kind of confirm and they they confirm and now it's hanging there in Washington DC what's the name of that place again Library of Congress hanging at Library of Congress in Washington DC and say say it's the only supernatural being actually record it on a picture like that now I would say this maybe into that time because when brother Quentin came here this church moving down from the Washington DC area he had a little video and we saw the pillar fire going in and out of the seats here praise the Lord he is the same yesterday today and forever now it's not that we got a new message it's because we're preaching the same message that the Prophet gave us that's why we're still seeing the supernatural see there's a supernatural element that remains despite the revelation oh I love the Lord Jesus God has had himself some faithful forerunners we don't have much longer just s oh I got to give you give you this last quote I'm sorry I got to give you this from this is not a program in church H 176 to run this and I will wind it up right here oh Jesus now this quote that I'm reading to you actually is the end of the the the right pick up your pen and write this just this portion that I'm reading to you is the end of where the angel told brother Brandon pick up his pen and write now I thought this would be appropriate to read now but it doesn't mean that we're at the end of step into the vision we got some other things we want to share but here I want to bring this I thought was very appropriate says the last day messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for Israel is in the homeland any time now he will come to come according to Malachi when we see him he would be dedicated to the word he will be he would he would be dedicated to where he would be indicated pointed out in the in the word revelation 10 7 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth don't mean it's the truth has just been taught that way right it says when it comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers now this is the important thing right here but this prophet will come and as the forerunner of the first coming cry behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out behold the lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for even as John was the messenger of truth to the elect so is this one the last messenger to the elect and were born bright he's not everybody's messenger but he is mine because the message was not to everybody but it was to me thank God for his faithful forerunner amen let's bow in a word of Prayer father how grateful we are for truth we would never be where we are had we not had this truth presented to us you called us out of something to bring us into this it's not my accident it's not my chance it's by for knowledge by predestination God that you would allow us to fellowship around this God our prayer in our desires that you would open up the understanding of each and every heart that they wouldn't miss what you were doing in this power people missed it in John's day people missed it and Jesus day God don't let him miss it today that's our sincere desire [Music] God you had a faithful forerunner to come and and he's coming he's gone but Lord has left this message and in the form of books and tapes all we gotta do is listen to it all we got to do is here in God it would it will open up our understanding so Lord let us be faithful God as our prayer let us stand like Joshua and Caleb standing against all the criticism and everything else and all the other evil reports let us stand guard with the truth that has been given to us in this hour we know it won't be long god you'll be coming for us some Jesus name that we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord but God's Word is right I know it's right amen and I tell you Church we're not just here just to be here we're here
