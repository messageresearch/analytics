[1:06:09] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:06:13] hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:06:15] praise
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:22] so we certainly think the Lord for his
[1:06:25] presence here today in the worship amen
[1:06:30] the songs that were sung here specials
[1:06:33] we just appreciate each and every one
[1:06:35] just seemed like we just kept elevating
[1:06:37] and you know our capping portion of the
[1:06:41] service sometime you go to church and
[1:06:43] all people talk about is the singing but
[1:06:45] we want to come to church we want to
[1:06:47] talk about the singing and we want to
[1:06:48] talk about the word and I just felt like
[1:06:52] it was elevating just getting us just
[1:06:55] right for the spot they man where the
[1:06:56] Word of God can come forth and do
[1:06:58] something special for some today man
[1:07:01] we're certainly happy to have our
[1:07:02] precious brother Nathan Bryant a man
[1:07:04] with us from Indiana a man as son Philip
[1:07:09] and a man we thank God for both of them
[1:07:11] just being here this this weekend and a
[1:07:15] man and just real precious friend of
[1:07:18] mine we we have a number of years
[1:07:21] together a man in friendship and you
[1:07:24] know we were friends before we were
[1:07:27] pastors a man and you know God just I
[1:07:31] think it was later in 2000 and 2001
[1:07:34] something like that 2001 when we when we
[1:07:36] met so 18 years of just friendships and
[1:07:42] and I just I just loved the way the Lord
[1:07:44] uses him and in just last night that he
[1:07:47] preached on my friend I just walked us
[1:07:50] through the journey of Lazarus and amen
[1:07:52] just a real real precious precious
[1:07:54] message and then at the end of that he
[1:07:57] prayed for the sick and I'm just under
[1:08:00] expectation that testimonies will come
[1:08:02] forth from last night God God was God
[1:08:06] was here God was moving in this place
[1:08:10] God was right here so many things that
[1:08:13] were just happening and and and I was
[1:08:16] just I'm just sitting I said look at God
[1:08:17] look at God look at God look at God any
[1:08:20] time you come here God don't speak to
[1:08:22] you gotta speak to your condition now to
[1:08:24] speak to your situation whatever it is
[1:08:25] you need God will speak to him and this
[1:08:27] morning I believe God got something else
[1:08:29] in store for us and even as he comes a
[1:08:33] man that we would just open our hearts
[1:08:35] from to receive from the Lord I believe
[1:08:37] it may you'll get what you come for
[1:08:39] today I think he told us the story of
[1:08:42] the daddy and the son that went to
[1:08:45] church and amen and as they went to
[1:08:48] church to offer him by the book it came
[1:08:49] by and daddy put that dollar in offering
[1:08:52] and you know and it's you know son watch
[1:08:56] that and then as as a service was coming
[1:08:58] to an end the daddy that really didn't
[1:09:00] like what the preacher said that day so
[1:09:02] as as the the ushers were walking by the
[1:09:05] daddy reached over and grabbed a dollar
[1:09:07] how to offer mask it put in his pocket
[1:09:09] what a daddy so his son said daddy
[1:09:13] so if you were to put my win you would
[1:09:15] have gotten more out I see lord have
[1:09:17] mercy the babies right I think God for
[1:09:24] that so I trust it we've all come to put
[1:09:26] something in this morning and I believe
[1:09:29] God is going to give you what exactly
[1:09:31] what you need as I press his brother
[1:09:32] Nathan Bryant will make his way forward
[1:09:34] a man less sing a courser song

[1:11:41] Thank You musicians god bless you amen
[1:11:44] the keys brother Jack picks I think he
[1:11:47] just likes to test out my white vocal
[1:11:49] cords and see if I can keep up with them
[1:11:50] but I can't brother Solomon I can't keep
[1:11:53] up with him mm-hmm at the risk of
[1:11:56] blowing out my voice I did Ecclesiastes
[1:12:00] chapter 11 and verse 1 if you turn this
[1:12:04] morning good to be in church again and I
[1:12:09] was had a word of prayer on the way over
[1:12:12] from the hotel this morning with my son
[1:12:14] Philip and we were just thanking God for
[1:12:16] the healings that took place here last
[1:12:17] night a man I believe there'll be many
[1:12:20] testimonies that come forth not because
[1:12:22] I was here this weekend but because
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ was here amen wherever he's
[1:12:27] at good things happen you know brother
[1:12:31] Branham preached a message one time
[1:12:32] called the presence of God unrecognized
[1:12:34] and I was actually in a car wreck right
[1:12:37] before my wife and I got engaged I was
[1:12:40] driving a little Ford Ranger and got
[1:12:42] rear-ended by f-350 the man had dropped
[1:12:45] his cell phone and reached down to pick
[1:12:47] it up and wasn't watching where he was
[1:12:49] going trying to pick up his cell phone
[1:12:50] out of the floorboard and the car two
[1:12:52] cars in front of me locked up and the
[1:12:54] car behind them locked up and hit them
[1:12:56] and I locked up and got about this close
[1:12:58] from hitting them and I thought praise
[1:13:00] God I got stopped I looked in the
[1:13:01] rearview mirror and f350 just surrounded
[1:13:04] me full speed didn't slow down at all
[1:13:05] and it was just a miracle of God that I
[1:13:07] walked away I had a little bit of glass
[1:13:10] in the back of my head from hitting the
[1:13:12] back window with my head and other than
[1:13:15] that I didn't have really any injuries
[1:13:17] and and knocked the - the the radio and
[1:13:21] the vents and everything out of the dash
[1:13:22] and just knocked things all over the
[1:13:24] place bent the truck bed like that and
[1:13:26] bent the bumper down around the mufflers
[1:13:28] and and and I happened to think on my
[1:13:31] way to the hospital and the ambulance
[1:13:33] you know they put me in a neck brace and
[1:13:35] everything because these afraid my neck
[1:13:36] was broke when they saw the vehicle and
[1:13:38] I was out checking on everybody else
[1:13:40] helping they said sir you got to sit
[1:13:41] down and stop and I said I'm okay and
[1:13:43] then I reached back and I begin to feel
[1:13:44] some blood and look back and had glass
[1:13:47] in my head and was trying to pick out
[1:13:48] all the glass that I could on my own and
[1:13:50] they put a neck brace I mean I really
[1:13:52] wasn't in any pain brother Solomon until
[1:13:54] put that neck brace on then that pushed
[1:13:55] the glass into my head more and on the
[1:13:58] way to the hospital begin to think you
[1:13:59] know the tape I was listening to in the
[1:14:01] car when I got hit was the presence of
[1:14:03] God unrecognized and so if we believe
[1:14:06] that he's omnipresent by his
[1:14:08] foreknowledge by being omniscient and
[1:14:11] omnipotent then then we recognized that
[1:14:14] he's always present but the many times
[1:14:16] you know sometimes you go to church you
[1:14:18] say my didn't we feel his presence there
[1:14:20] this morning well if we came in his name
[1:14:22] he is there all the time but sometimes
[1:14:25] we just get in a condition to where we
[1:14:27] let all the toils of the road and all
[1:14:29] the busyness of life and everything fade
[1:14:31] away a little bit to where we can
[1:14:32] recognize his presence but he's here
[1:14:34] every service whether you recognize him
[1:14:36] or not some services we feel like
[1:14:39] running and shouting and some services
[1:14:41] we just sit there and but he's there
[1:14:43] whether you feel it or not amen the the
[1:14:45] our job is to get into a condition where
[1:14:48] we can recognize his presence
[1:14:50] Amen Ecclesiastes chapter 11 and verse 1
[1:14:55] cast thy bread upon the waters for thou
[1:14:59] shalt find it after many days amen let's
[1:15:03] bow our heads together dear Heavenly
[1:15:05] Father lord I don't know for who or for
[1:15:08] how many people this will be for this
[1:15:10] morning but Laura and I know in studying
[1:15:13] last night you placed this on my heart
[1:15:15] and I just asked it to be a blessing to
[1:15:17] the people here this morning help me to
[1:15:18] get out of the way so you could use me
[1:15:20] help me to get into a channel Lord where
[1:15:23] the Lord it wouldn't be me but it would
[1:15:26] be you Lord that would be speaking to
[1:15:28] your people the Lord may you come again
[1:15:31] do the supernatural this morning I pray
[1:15:32] father will give you the glory in the
[1:15:34] praise for it in Jesus Christ's name and
[1:15:37] the church said amen god bless you can
[1:15:40] be seated
[1:15:49] you know brother Jack was talking about
[1:15:52] how that you know God working and and
[1:15:57] and how many times it's a god thing that
[1:15:59] we see God God speaking through
[1:16:00] Ministers and things and and and we
[1:16:03] recognize that by the grace of God but I
[1:16:06] want to say that he doesn't just use
[1:16:07] ministers in that way but many times you
[1:16:10] know we recognize it at our church and
[1:16:12] I'm sure you do here maybe you had a
[1:16:14] need or a burden or maybe you had a song
[1:16:18] on your heart all week and you come into
[1:16:19] church and you sit down and the
[1:16:21] musicians get up and and whoever still
[1:16:23] leading the music that morning gets up
[1:16:25] and they just begin to play softly and
[1:16:27] it's that song that you needed to hear
[1:16:29] or if they don't do it maybe the song
[1:16:32] leader will get up and maybe and maybe
[1:16:33] he struggled and thought of I don't know
[1:16:35] what to sing this morning I just don't
[1:16:37] feel impressed to sing anything all of a
[1:16:39] sudden the song strikes him and he
[1:16:40] begins to sing and he say thank you Lord
[1:16:42] that's exactly what I needed I heard
[1:16:44] somebody out here when one of the
[1:16:45] sisters begin to sing said that's my
[1:16:46] song amen why did God leave that sister
[1:16:51] to sing that song why not one of the
[1:16:53] other 500 songs that we sing God works
[1:16:57] on both ends of the line amen and God
[1:16:59] uses us if we can get out of the way and
[1:17:02] get in the channel where God can use
[1:17:03] this whether it's a five-year-old child
[1:17:05] or a 95 year old person whatever would
[1:17:07] be God can use you I want to look at
[1:17:10] this thought this morning with the help
[1:17:11] of the Lord just a simple thought I
[1:17:13] don't have a lot of ones that aren't
[1:17:15] simple but I want to look at this
[1:17:17] thought of sowing and reaping and
[1:17:20] Ecclesiastes here the Solomon tells us
[1:17:23] that if we cast our bread upon the
[1:17:25] waters
[1:17:25] we'll find it after many days and
[1:17:27] brother Brandon picks up this thought
[1:17:29] and a greater than Solomon is here in
[1:17:31] 1961 and he says you're hungry for more
[1:17:34] of God there's more of God somewhere or
[1:17:38] you wouldn't have the hunger a deep
[1:17:40] calling to the deep if there's a hunger
[1:17:42] that God's placed in you I don't care
[1:17:45] how many years you've been in the
[1:17:46] message or how many wonderful
[1:17:47] experiences you've had in prayer in
[1:17:49] church if there's a hunger and a desire
[1:17:52] in your heart for more of God this
[1:17:53] morning then God is obligated to provide
[1:17:56] for that design
[1:17:58] brother branham said that God wouldn't
[1:18:00] have put a fin on a fish's back if there
[1:18:02] hadn't have been a water for him to swim
[1:18:04] in it wasn't some freaking thing of
[1:18:06] nature that that a fish had a fin on its
[1:18:09] back but the reason that God provided a
[1:18:11] fin on the fish's back is there was a
[1:18:13] water for the fish to swim in so if God
[1:18:16] provides the desire in your heart God I
[1:18:18] want to do something for you I want to
[1:18:20] do something for your people I need more
[1:18:23] of you in my life God would not place a
[1:18:25] desire in your heart unless there was a
[1:18:27] way for that desire to be fulfilled he's
[1:18:29] obligated if he gives you a desire deep
[1:18:33] calling too deep then there has to be a
[1:18:34] deep that is able to respond to that all
[1:18:38] I want a greater experience with you God
[1:18:40] I want to see you move more in my life
[1:18:42] than you ever had before if there's a
[1:18:44] desire there if there's a hunger there
[1:18:46] then God is obligated to provide a way
[1:18:49] to quench that thirst or that hunger
[1:18:51] bream says that's only the law of it God
[1:18:55] one of his laws like sowing and reaping
[1:18:59] and so forth so we recognize that God
[1:19:01] has many different laws there's a law of
[1:19:04] faith that brother Branham talks about
[1:19:06] that God operates on a law of faith that
[1:19:09] you didn't have to earn your healing you
[1:19:11] didn't have to do anything to deserve
[1:19:12] your healing brother Branham said many
[1:19:14] times in prayer lines he would see
[1:19:16] somebody come across the prayer line
[1:19:17] maybe a good christian maybe it's a
[1:19:20] prophet of God looking through their
[1:19:21] life and not see anything as far as
[1:19:24] being a hindrance that would keep them
[1:19:25] from being healed right before God and
[1:19:28] all that and walk off the platform still
[1:19:30] sick because they didn't have the faith
[1:19:32] to receive it and God works up for the
[1:19:34] law faith he said then he would see
[1:19:36] prostitutes come through and receive
[1:19:38] their healing because they had the faith
[1:19:39] to receive it and now he tells us that
[1:19:41] you can't or you can be healed and not
[1:19:43] even be a Christian but if you're gonna
[1:19:45] stay healed then you need to come a
[1:19:48] Christian he tells us that just as sure
[1:19:50] as faith will kill whatever disease it
[1:19:53] is that's in your body the fear or doubt
[1:19:55] will resurrect that thing you know what
[1:19:58] I was talking a little bit about David
[1:20:00] last night and when David when he killed
[1:20:02] Goliath you know he didn't just do like
[1:20:04] a lot of us do when we come to church
[1:20:06] and we come down to an altar we say Lord
[1:20:08] forgive us and help us with that
[1:20:09] thing that ms settings sin that we keep
[1:20:11] stumbling with and and he didn't just
[1:20:13] relieve Goliath laying there with a rock
[1:20:15] in his forehead and hope that that was
[1:20:17] good enough he didn't even have a sword
[1:20:19] of his own but he goes over and he picks
[1:20:21] up this big sword of Goliath and he
[1:20:24] takes it and he swings it over and he
[1:20:26] chops the head off of his Giants but a
[1:20:29] lot of us we come to a church service
[1:20:30] and we feel the anointing of the Holy
[1:20:33] Spirit and I hope I hope it's not too
[1:20:35] early for you this morning I hope you
[1:20:36] can stay awake I'll try not to preach
[1:20:38] over an hour I'll do my very best
[1:20:40] so if I'll do my very best to do that
[1:20:43] I'm gonna ask you to do your very best
[1:20:45] stay awake for an hour jesus said to
[1:20:48] Peter he said couldn't you what didn't
[1:20:49] you say with me one hour a man even
[1:20:52] asked him to have an all-night prayer
[1:20:53] meeting he just asked him for an hour so
[1:20:57] I'm just asking you for an hour this
[1:20:58] morning stay with me alright he chops
[1:21:03] the head off of this giant and many of
[1:21:06] us we come to a church service and we
[1:21:08] feel an atmosphere of anointing we feel
[1:21:11] a presence of God the musicians begin to
[1:21:13] get anointed the singers begin to get
[1:21:16] anointed and we don't just want to leave
[1:21:17] the anointing up here on the platform
[1:21:19] but the congregation begins to feel the
[1:21:21] anointing they begin to worship they
[1:21:23] lift their hands to God they begin to
[1:21:25] clap their hands and begin to think
[1:21:27] about all that God has done for him they
[1:21:29] begin to praise them and and it brings
[1:21:31] an atmosphere and then it's the minister
[1:21:33] we get up and begin to preach and he
[1:21:35] maybe you know he maybe he didn't know
[1:21:36] exactly what she was going through maybe
[1:21:39] he didn't know the little things that
[1:21:40] the devil's been trying to tempt you
[1:21:42] with or beat you up about but God gets
[1:21:44] that man in the channel to where he
[1:21:45] starts going down through those things
[1:21:47] and if you've really got any ounce of
[1:21:49] God in your conviction begins to come to
[1:21:51] your heart and you think oh my he's
[1:21:54] talking to me and sometimes you look
[1:21:55] around to see if everybody's looking at
[1:21:57] you in point because God is what a man
[1:21:59] at a channel so specific that you think
[1:22:01] brother Jack did you tell that brother
[1:22:03] did you take him out to lunch and tell
[1:22:06] him about what I was going through
[1:22:07] brother Jack said no I didn't tell him
[1:22:08] nothing in fact I'll just say it this
[1:22:10] way if a pastor got out and
[1:22:12] - tell me now look brother Nathan when
[1:22:14] you come to my church there's a sister
[1:22:16] that she's dealing with this and I'd
[1:22:17] really appreciate if you hit that and
[1:22:19] then there's some brothers over here
[1:22:20] that they won't do this for nothing if
[1:22:22] you if you could just really hit on that
[1:22:24] I'd tell them you've probably invited
[1:22:26] the wrong preacher Amen because you know
[1:22:29] I as much as I respect my brothers and
[1:22:32] as much as I respect other ministers
[1:22:34] there's nobody that tells me what to
[1:22:36] preach but Jesus my wife don't tell me
[1:22:39] what to preach my deacons don't tell me
[1:22:41] what to preach no pastor that invites me
[1:22:43] is gonna tell me what to preach but when
[1:22:45] he tells me you know don't get offended
[1:22:47] if it's Sam laying it on my heart okay
[1:22:49] and so what a man gets to the channel
[1:22:52] where God can use them and you begin to
[1:22:54] recognize that's God walking down my
[1:22:56] aisle that's God giving me warning
[1:22:59] that's God
[1:22:59] placing anointed man in a watchtower to
[1:23:03] look down the road and recognize hey
[1:23:04] there's trouble coming there's danger
[1:23:08] coming and if you don't get right with
[1:23:09] God it's gonna cause you problems down
[1:23:12] the road and conviction begins to set
[1:23:15] into her heart we think Oh God
[1:23:17] you know the man's right he may be
[1:23:18] stepping on my toes he may be hurting my
[1:23:21] feelings but I know it's the word and I
[1:23:23] know that it's right and I need to
[1:23:24] commit myself and surrender myself to
[1:23:26] your word and we come down and say Oh
[1:23:28] God forgive me and help me this time and
[1:23:31] then we leave the stone in Goliath's
[1:23:32] forehead and we go out of these doors
[1:23:35] and then we get out there and we get
[1:23:38] around our work buddies and they begin
[1:23:39] to talk about what they did over the
[1:23:41] weekend and Satan places that you know
[1:23:44] Satan doesn't I don't know about how the
[1:23:46] rest of you brothers were are but when I
[1:23:48] was working you know out in the
[1:23:49] commercial world and and working out in
[1:23:52] the corporate world and things like that
[1:23:54] Satan never put the ugliest woman in the
[1:23:57] business right beside me and my cubicle
[1:23:59] but he would put the most beautiful
[1:24:02] worst dressed woman in the whole company
[1:24:04] right by me why because he wasn't
[1:24:06] interested in getting the drunks and all
[1:24:08] these other guys had already got there
[1:24:10] but he won to get to this guy and so you
[1:24:13] go and you sit down some attractive
[1:24:15] little Jezebel walks by and begins to
[1:24:17] lean over your desk and display your
[1:24:19] body to you and you think oh Lord I know
[1:24:21] I asked you to help me with this and
[1:24:23] Lord I know I laid that down at the
[1:24:25] altar but what do you do you go over to
[1:24:27] your Goliath and you get out the paddles
[1:24:29] and you charge them up and you rub them
[1:24:32] together and you put the Vaseline on me
[1:24:34] say come on Goliath
[1:24:35] I was I was under conviction but come
[1:24:49] back boy I need you instead of chopping
[1:24:54] the head off of the thing and we played
[1:24:58] Church and we come and well it was sure
[1:25:01] good service I felt the presence of God
[1:25:02] not in printed minister sure was
[1:25:04] anointed but but we don't fully slay our
[1:25:06] Goliath and we begin to sow little
[1:25:13] things
[1:25:13] oh it was just it was just a little
[1:25:16] something you know but when you sow
[1:25:18] little things they grow up to be great
[1:25:20] big things I don't know about you I
[1:25:25] don't know how many you know farmers and
[1:25:26] things that we have but you know when
[1:25:28] you go to plant watermelons I've never
[1:25:30] planted watermelon but I'm pretty sure
[1:25:32] you don't take a watermelon
[1:25:33] and dig up the ground and put a
[1:25:35] watermelon in the ground but you plant a
[1:25:38] seed it's something small it's something
[1:25:41] that seems so insignificant brother
[1:25:42] Jiang but you plant that and it grows up
[1:25:45] to be something big something much
[1:25:48] bigger than what you planted oh man
[1:25:51] whatever you know you go out here and
[1:25:53] you get an acorn in a tiny little egg
[1:25:55] horn and you plant it in the ground and
[1:25:56] all of a sudden a huge oak tree begins
[1:25:58] to grow and it might outlive you
[1:26:01] for hundreds of years your children
[1:26:03] might see the oak tree your
[1:26:05] grandchildren might see the oak tree
[1:26:07] line because of one little seed that you
[1:26:09] plant in
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:14] all brother Nathan I just flirted a
[1:26:16] little bit with some of these girls that
[1:26:17] might work and things I you know I don't
[1:26:20] really mean anything by it but you're
[1:26:21] planting seeds am i preaching to anybody
[1:26:24] tonight or I'm at the wrong Church oh
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:29] you know my boss on my job he likes it
[1:26:33] if I wear these outfits that are tight
[1:26:34] and short and and display myself a
[1:26:37] little bit all I'm sure he does I'm sure
[1:26:39] that he does
[1:26:40] oh I dress okay when I come to church
[1:26:43] but but when I get out there with my
[1:26:45] co-workers you know they make fun of me
[1:26:47] because I'm holiness and so I'm just
[1:26:49] trying to be a little bit more like them
[1:26:51] and I'm trying to fit in oh my you'll
[1:26:54] never fit in over there amen Solomon the
[1:26:57] brothers Solomon saying I'm going up
[1:26:59] yonder hey man you'll never fit over and
[1:27:02] over there dressed like a prostitute a
[1:27:05] man if you don't like this tonight don't
[1:27:07] don't come but already this morning
[1:27:08] don't come tonight to the joint meeting
[1:27:10] cuz there's gonna be a lot worse than
[1:27:11] this I'm going easy on you this morning
[1:27:18] but tonight no or no bars hold I'm just
[1:27:22] I'm just letting loose tonight can i
[1:27:27] bread upon the waters for thou shalt
[1:27:30] find it after many days oh my we find
[1:27:34] that there's laws that God places
[1:27:36] there's a law of pro and con there would
[1:27:39] never be an opportunity for you to enjoy
[1:27:41] the good days if there weren't bad days
[1:27:43] and I know in Florida you don't have
[1:27:45] quite of the extremes that we do back
[1:27:46] home but we had what they called a polar
[1:27:48] vortex this last winter and it got about
[1:27:51] negative eight degrees and there was
[1:27:53] about four inches of snow on the ground
[1:27:55] and it was cold and it was miserable and
[1:27:58] my dad who is stubborn and doesn't like
[1:28:00] to go to the hospital and it holds off
[1:28:02] and holds off and holds off till it
[1:28:04] feels like he's about to die decided on
[1:28:06] the day of the polar vortex that he
[1:28:08] wanted me to take him to the hospital
[1:28:09] I thought dad why couldn't you let me
[1:28:13] take you yesterday he was sick yesterday
[1:28:15] why didn't you have any take you
[1:28:17] yesterday when the weather was nice but
[1:28:19] you know when we go through days like
[1:28:20] that
[1:28:21] then we get into a nice day about 70 or
[1:28:23] 80 degrees and all my the breeze is just
[1:28:26] right in the Sun it's just right we've
[1:28:28] come through us a winter and a spring
[1:28:30] and summer begins to creep in and now
[1:28:32] you know an ounce 95 degrees and humid
[1:28:34] here in Florida and you all are saying
[1:28:35] oh let the fall come back probably most
[1:28:38] of you but but you know it seems like
[1:28:40] was human beings were never satisfied
[1:28:42] we're always waiting for the next thing
[1:28:43] when we were more a child we think oh my
[1:28:46] if I could just get out of school if I
[1:28:48] could just get a driver's license then
[1:28:50] I'd be content and then we get a
[1:28:52] driver's license and we realize what we
[1:28:53] got to pay for that car and we got to
[1:28:55] pay for that insurance and then and then
[1:28:57] we get a job and we think oh my this job
[1:28:59] is way worse than school if I could only
[1:29:01] go back to when I was in school but if I
[1:29:05] could just find the right person brother
[1:29:07] Jack if I could just find a wife and I
[1:29:10] could get married and and all my then I
[1:29:12] then I would be continued find a wife
[1:29:14] and then you realize hey you got to pay
[1:29:16] now for two cars and two insurance and a
[1:29:19] house anything Lord if I could just get
[1:29:21] a little better job then I would be
[1:29:23] content and then he gives you a better
[1:29:25] job and you realize your boss is a jerk
[1:29:27] and the job is a lot more complicated
[1:29:28] than your old job you think oh I long
[1:29:31] for the simple days but if you just give
[1:29:34] us some children I think then I can be
[1:29:37] content then I could be happy to see
[1:29:40] some on my own offspring running around
[1:29:42] and then they come and you realize now
[1:29:44] you got to pay for seven pairs of shoes
[1:29:46] and seven suits and seven dresses and
[1:29:50] all this and then you know it's just all
[1:29:53] my drama and this one fighting with that
[1:29:55] one and and now you know to go to Disney
[1:29:57] World it's a lot more expensive than it
[1:29:58] was just for you and your wife and then
[1:30:00] how you think all my if they could just
[1:30:03] get out of the house and we can have
[1:30:05] peace and quiet again
[1:30:07] and enjoy our retirement days if I could
[1:30:10] just get to retirement then then Lord
[1:30:13] I'll be content and you get there and
[1:30:15] you think it's an empty nest if I could
[1:30:19] just hear the children running down the
[1:30:20] house again I wouldn't even care if they
[1:30:21] broke the China just to hear the
[1:30:23] pitter-patter of little feet and that
[1:30:26] job that I hate it I'm so bored and I
[1:30:28] sit here and I look at for a while walls
[1:30:31] I have to almost beg my friends to come
[1:30:32] and visit me and I go to church and my
[1:30:34] joints hurt so bad I can't shout like I
[1:30:36] used to Satan will always keep a carrot
[1:30:42] out in front of you longing for
[1:30:44] contentment but Paul said I found
[1:30:46] whatsoever state I'm in there to be with
[1:30:48] the content this was a man who was in
[1:30:50] prison who was in this in the sea many
[1:30:53] days in shipwreck who was beaten they
[1:30:56] tried to stone him they did all these
[1:30:58] things to me said I found whatever state
[1:31:00] I'm in there to be with content if Paul
[1:31:02] could be content in those conditions oh
[1:31:03] god help us so there's a law of pro and
[1:31:08] con there's a law of different things
[1:31:10] there's a law of free moral agency but
[1:31:12] yet I thank God that sometimes his
[1:31:15] sovereignty over rules my free moral
[1:31:17] agency a man as a young man there were
[1:31:20] many times that my free moral agency got
[1:31:22] me in trouble but if it hadn't been for
[1:31:23] the sovereignty of God holding me back
[1:31:25] it would have got me in a lot more
[1:31:26] trouble but there was something about it
[1:31:29] that God would seemingly allow me you
[1:31:31] know you ever walk a dog on a leash and
[1:31:33] a dog has a certain amount of or maybe
[1:31:35] you don't have a dog maybe you're cat
[1:31:36] people but I'll pray for you if you are
[1:31:38] me and brother Brandon don't like cats
[1:31:40] okay I know that offends people but you
[1:31:44] know I somebody texted me a picture of a
[1:31:46] kitten in a bowl and they said don't you
[1:31:49] hate it when your Chinese food shows up
[1:31:50] completely uncooked didn't even defer it
[1:32:12] I'm offending people already brother
[1:32:14] Jack it's not even barely twelve o'clock
[1:32:20] but you walk a dog on a leash and he's
[1:32:23] got a little bit of freedom yeah some
[1:32:25] you know they've got these things down
[1:32:26] where it's got a little click thing and
[1:32:27] you can stop it you know and click it or
[1:32:29] they got about 20 feet that they can run
[1:32:31] out and you can click it and blind them
[1:32:33] back or whatever and and you know that's
[1:32:35] how I felt like God's free moral agency
[1:32:37] as he gives us a leash that you know he
[1:32:39] puts them in here on free moral agency
[1:32:41] and he allows us to make certain choices
[1:32:42] but hey there were choices that brother
[1:32:44] branham wanted to make that God didn't
[1:32:46] allow him to make and I thank God for it
[1:32:48] I thank God that sovereign his
[1:32:50] sovereignty overrode the free moral
[1:32:51] agency brother branham and those boys
[1:32:53] beat him unconscious and when shake him
[1:32:55] and wake him up and beat him again not
[1:32:57] because he did something wrong but just
[1:32:59] was cuz he was from Kentucky I don't
[1:33:01] understand stuff like that I don't
[1:33:03] understand people that would beat
[1:33:05] somebody up because of the country or
[1:33:07] the state or the color or the
[1:33:08] nationality something that was I just
[1:33:10] don't understand that a man I don't
[1:33:13] understand that but they beat him just
[1:33:14] because he was from Kentucky and they
[1:33:15] beat him unconscious and they take him
[1:33:17] wake him up and beat him again and and
[1:33:19] so he goes home and he gets him a 22
[1:33:21] rifle he goes out there with the
[1:33:22] intention to kill these boys now he'll
[1:33:24] be honest with ourselves without the
[1:33:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost we would've
[1:33:27] did the same thing and he goes out there
[1:33:29] click he puts another shell in click and
[1:33:32] he puts another shell in click and it
[1:33:34] misfires every time and he gets so mad
[1:33:36] he throws the gun down and the boys run
[1:33:37] off screaming and crying he puts the
[1:33:39] shells back in and it suits what the
[1:33:43] boats not there nothing wrong with the
[1:33:45] gun nothing wrong with the bullets what
[1:33:47] was it the sovereignty of God overrode
[1:33:49] his free moral agency now I believe that
[1:33:52] that was because he had a gift in his
[1:33:54] life that God was protecting so that you
[1:33:56] and I would have the benefits of hearing
[1:33:58] this message but I believe that God also
[1:34:01] has that with us and you can look back
[1:34:02] in your life I can think of specific
[1:34:04] times in my life and I don't want to get
[1:34:06] into too many details this morning but I
[1:34:08] can remember its specific details in my
[1:34:10] life brother Solomon that I can look
[1:34:12] back and had it not been for the
[1:34:14] sovereignty of God that said I'm not
[1:34:15] gonna let you go that far
[1:34:18] wouldn't be standing here this morning
[1:34:20] if God hadn't said no you can try you
[1:34:23] can run but I'm gonna stop you I'm not
[1:34:25] gonna let you go any further than this
[1:34:27] why because of my free art moral agency
[1:34:29] my free moral agency I was done a man
[1:34:32] I'd seen how the message people treated
[1:34:34] preachers and I didn't want anything to
[1:34:36] do with it and yet a call of God in my
[1:34:38] life but I found that hey the further
[1:34:39] you run the quieter that call gets but I
[1:34:42] also found that you can run but she
[1:34:45] can't hide well there may be some of you
[1:34:47] here this morning that you're running
[1:34:49] but she can't hide from him Jonah tried
[1:34:51] it he went kept going down further and
[1:34:53] further and further he went he got in a
[1:34:55] boat and tried to run that was it for
[1:34:57] enough he went into the belly of the
[1:34:58] boat and I wasn't far enough and then he
[1:35:00] went in the belly of the whale the whale
[1:35:01] went down to the bottom of the ocean and
[1:35:03] hid down underneath the mountains and it
[1:35:06] still wasn't far enough he couldn't hide
[1:35:08] from God Oh Jonah if you're here this
[1:35:12] morning you can't hide from him he knows
[1:35:13] right where you're at
[1:35:15] he knows how far you've ran but you can
[1:35:18] trout run him David said if I go up if I
[1:35:20] send into heaven he's there if I go down
[1:35:22] to the pits of hell he's there hey man
[1:35:25] he knows where you're at this morning
[1:35:28] but we find that there's these laws of
[1:35:31] and and one of the laws is sowing and
[1:35:33] reaping and we find there's a statement
[1:35:34] that says hurt people hurt people hurt
[1:35:39] people hurt you means if your heart
[1:35:41] you're gonna hurt somebody else
[1:35:43] why because somebody sowed something to
[1:35:46] you and now you're gonna turn around so
[1:35:48] that to somebody else that we find out a
[1:35:51] lot a lot of child molesters if you go
[1:35:53] back and you look into their life what
[1:35:54] was it somebody molested them once upon
[1:35:56] a time nine times out of ten or more and
[1:35:59] we find that somebody hurt them so
[1:36:01] they're gonna hurt somebody else we find
[1:36:03] parents that you know are too extreme
[1:36:05] one way or you know there's a knee-jerk
[1:36:07] reaction many times that either if they
[1:36:09] was disciplined too hard as a child then
[1:36:12] either they're gonna discipline the same
[1:36:13] way and pass that on to another
[1:36:14] generation or they're just gonna say
[1:36:16] well my daddy discipline me too hard I'm
[1:36:18] gonna they're not gonna discipline my
[1:36:19] children at all because the seeds that
[1:36:23] was sowed and instead of finding a
[1:36:25] balance on it they go under extreme or
[1:36:28] the other and so when you when you begin
[1:36:30] to sow
[1:36:30] things you know it's not just something
[1:36:33] that that is just going to lay there and
[1:36:34] just stay the same as it was but when
[1:36:36] you sow something that's gonna begin to
[1:36:38] grow and when it begins to grow it's
[1:36:41] probably not just going to be there for
[1:36:42] one generation but it's going to pass on
[1:36:44] from generation to generation Galatians
[1:36:48] chapter six verse seven st. Paul says be
[1:36:50] not deceived God is not much for
[1:36:53] whatsoever a man soweth that shall he
[1:36:55] read for he that soweth to his flesh
[1:36:57] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[1:37:00] he that soweth to the spirit shall have
[1:37:02] the Spirit reap life everlasting
[1:37:04] whatsoever immense owes he's so reap now
[1:37:07] if you go out here and you plant a if
[1:37:11] you plant some type of a seed we'll say
[1:37:13] if you go out and plant a watermelon
[1:37:15] seed you're not gonna expect for a
[1:37:16] potato to come up if it did you'd be
[1:37:19] very surprised and you say somebody sold
[1:37:21] me the wrong kind of seeds because
[1:37:24] whatever you sow you're going to reap if
[1:37:26] you sow corn
[1:37:27] you're gonna reap corn back and so when
[1:37:29] we sow things whatever it is that we're
[1:37:31] so and how can we expect to get anything
[1:37:33] else back than what we sowed brother
[1:37:35] Jack preferred the story that I said
[1:37:37] last night about the man that is some
[1:37:39] time if you to put more in you would
[1:37:40] have gotten more out if you come to
[1:37:42] church and you don't put anything in if
[1:37:45] you don't put any worship in if you
[1:37:48] don't put any time in if you don't put
[1:37:50] any money in how do you expect to
[1:37:52] receive something back but yet we have a
[1:37:56] lot of people to do that we'll give to
[1:37:57] that maybe it a little bit I don't want
[1:37:58] to get ahead of myself this morning but
[1:38:00] Hosea says they have sown to the wind
[1:38:03] and they reap the whirlwind brother
[1:38:05] Graham said in faith of Abraham 1959 he
[1:38:07] said I'll preach one of these nights on
[1:38:09] sowing to the wind and reaping the
[1:38:10] whirlwind that's what the nation's has
[1:38:13] done sowed to the wind at is reaping the
[1:38:16] whirlwind
[1:38:17] he said we sowed to socialism and
[1:38:19] reaping communism now he's saying this
[1:38:21] back in the 50s but yet we still see it
[1:38:24] today what is it seeds that was sewed
[1:38:26] back then we're we're being it's the
[1:38:28] beginning to reap those things now he
[1:38:30] tells us in one place he said he said
[1:38:32] the the
[1:38:32] the things that the government was
[1:38:34] spending back there 40 years ago he said
[1:38:36] if my grandson lives to be an adult he
[1:38:39] said in 40 years he'll be paying taxes
[1:38:41] on what we're spending back here in the
[1:38:43] 50s and we see this day the Scriptures
[1:38:46] fulfilled Amen what they're spending now
[1:38:49] our children our grandchildren and our
[1:38:51] great-grandchildren will be paying why
[1:38:53] because of seeds that was sold back
[1:38:54] there we would see him strike at things
[1:38:56] like the Elvis and the Beatles and I
[1:39:00] Love Lucy and things that it will be
[1:39:02] real honest with ourselves if you would
[1:39:04] go back and listen to some of that you
[1:39:06] think what is what's what was so bad
[1:39:08] about the hands compared to some of the
[1:39:10] garbage that we have today it seems sold
[1:39:13] so tame and by the way they dressed and
[1:39:15] and the way they did he talked about the
[1:39:17] Beatles and their haircuts the Beatles
[1:39:18] would look like some good Pentecostal
[1:39:20] boys if they live next door to you today
[1:39:22] let's just be honest if the Beatles
[1:39:25] showed up and knocked at your door you
[1:39:26] would think they were a Mormon coming to
[1:39:28] tell you about the Book of Mormon or
[1:39:30] something but what was it seeds were
[1:39:38] being sown and you hear people today
[1:39:41] they'll interview him what was your
[1:39:43] influences who what influenced you what
[1:39:45] was your influence the music and nine
[1:39:47] times out of ten they'll say the Beatles
[1:39:49] or Elvis they took a poll and said what
[1:39:52] was the most influential actor I think
[1:39:54] it was People magazine did about ten
[1:39:56] years ago what was the most influential
[1:39:58] entertainers of the top 100 influential
[1:40:01] entertainers of the 1900s and Lucille
[1:40:04] Ball was number one the most influential
[1:40:07] entertainer a prophet of God saw that
[1:40:10] seeds were being sown and you go back
[1:40:13] and all many of us we wouldn't watch I
[1:40:14] Love Lucy for nothing because the
[1:40:16] prophet of God talked about it but you
[1:40:17] go back and watch something from that
[1:40:19] era you watched I Love Lucy or some of
[1:40:21] those TV shows from the 50s and you look
[1:40:23] at what they got today going on and
[1:40:25] everyone kind of thing brother even
[1:40:26] talked about allowing men and women that
[1:40:29] wasn't married to kiss all over one
[1:40:31] another and things on TV and
[1:40:33] how terrible it was what would he say
[1:40:35] today with men kissing men on the TV and
[1:40:37] women kissing women oh you can get mad
[1:40:39] I'm gonna talk about it anyhow what
[1:40:43] would he say today oh my what is it a
[1:40:45] perversion a perversion you say oh
[1:40:47] you're just an old homophobe brother
[1:40:49] Nathan you you hate homosexuals I don't
[1:40:51] hate them I just think it's a sin I
[1:40:52] don't hate drunks but I think it's a sin
[1:40:55] I don't hate cigarette smokers but I
[1:40:57] think it's a sin it's destroying their
[1:40:59] body
[1:41:00] all right this it's a party it's because
[1:41:03] they've yielded themselves to something
[1:41:04] there's this contrary to the way that
[1:41:07] God originally intended it to be a man
[1:41:09] whatever the sin there's no big sins and
[1:41:11] little sins I know some sins it will
[1:41:13] make us more uncomfortable than others
[1:41:15] but it's just sin whether it makes you
[1:41:17] uncomfortable or it doesn't make you
[1:41:18] uncomfortable sin is sin and so these
[1:41:22] seeds that were sold way back there now
[1:41:24] we see you know I can't imagine you know
[1:41:27] if there had been Miley Cyrus's and
[1:41:29] Kardashian's and some of these things
[1:41:30] that we have today they would have put
[1:41:32] them in jail back in the 50s but today
[1:41:36] you can't even check the news you can't
[1:41:38] even go on Fox news.com and check about
[1:41:40] a weather update or see what Donald
[1:41:42] Trump's doing it or whatever without
[1:41:44] having to see what everybody wore to
[1:41:46] every event and what somebody put on
[1:41:48] Twitter 90% naked or whatever they was
[1:41:52] they would have never allowed it back
[1:41:54] then but seeds were being sown seeds
[1:41:58] were being sown and it's continually got
[1:42:01] worse and worse and worse and it'll
[1:42:03] continue to get worse and my Everitt
[1:42:05] everywhere you look there somebody has
[1:42:07] done something perverted and instead of
[1:42:09] instead of preaching against it instead
[1:42:12] of condemning it they smear it all over
[1:42:14] the newspaper and all over the news and
[1:42:16] everywhere you go you can't turn hardly
[1:42:18] without looking at it brother man said
[1:42:19] he would back there he said he said God
[1:42:22] healed my eyes I was almost blind and
[1:42:24] had to be led around he said I hang a
[1:42:25] little cross in my car because he said I
[1:42:27] promised God that I look at the right
[1:42:29] thing as well my today brother Jack
[1:42:31] would have to have one
[1:42:32] in every window and on the sunroof the
[1:42:37] windshield the left window the back
[1:42:39] window the right window the right back
[1:42:41] window the back windshield we'd have to
[1:42:44] have about 100 crosses dangling from the
[1:42:46] ceiling just to keep from looking at it
[1:42:49] today the cedar discrepancy 1965 now we
[1:42:57] notice that today our churches all our
[1:42:59] churches has sewed to the winds and are
[1:43:01] reaping the whirlwind we don't have the
[1:43:03] prayer meetings we don't have the
[1:43:05] services we used to
[1:43:06] what's the matter we've let down the
[1:43:08] bars on everything we've let down the
[1:43:12] bars on everything now we recognize it
[1:43:15] out there in the world but it tries to
[1:43:16] creep right into our churches he says
[1:43:19] and why are we not anno domination 1950
[1:43:21] he says you girls that's out here
[1:43:23] wearing these little old shorts and
[1:43:24] things around you know that's reflecting
[1:43:26] on your daughter did you know your
[1:43:28] grandmommy was a flapper and your mammy
[1:43:30] a chorus girl and that's the reason
[1:43:32] you're a striptease today it's certainly
[1:43:34] he said what will your children be what
[1:43:39] were your children to be why because of
[1:43:41] seeds that were sown because of seeds
[1:43:44] that were sown in one generation and
[1:43:46] then the daughter of that raised up and
[1:43:48] said well my mammy did this so I'm going
[1:43:49] to go even further oh we used to talk
[1:43:51] about Madonna and how that she dress and
[1:43:53] how that she acted back in the 80s and
[1:43:55] now some of these people you know that
[1:43:59] come out today and the things that they
[1:44:01] do on their music videos and things
[1:44:02] would make her look like a Catholic
[1:44:03] schoolgirl but what is it become so
[1:44:09] normal because we're in inundated with
[1:44:12] it I think that's a word isn't it and
[1:44:14] undated inundated thank you brother
[1:44:17] inundated we're overwhelmed with it
[1:44:20] constantly oh my I feel bad for you all
[1:44:24] we walked through our land oh and it was
[1:44:25] it was bad enough you get down to Miami
[1:44:27] it's even worse than that why because
[1:44:29] it's just public flesh on display
[1:44:30] everywhere and now you know they wonder
[1:44:33] why so many young people are molested
[1:44:34] and things we walk through Disney World
[1:44:36] in 12 year olds dressed like street
[1:44:37] prostitutes I don't say that to be a
[1:44:39] judge
[1:44:40] say that to be hateful but my goodness
[1:44:42] when you wouldn't when they've got
[1:44:43] little children out here that they're
[1:44:45] displaying and perverts out here
[1:44:46] everywhere
[1:44:47] oh and then they wonder Wow can you
[1:44:51] believe brother Jack yeah I can believe
[1:44:54] it I can believe it I'm surprised there
[1:44:57] aren't more rapes and things that go on
[1:44:58] the way that women are dressed today all
[1:45:02] brother Nathan you can get thrown in
[1:45:04] jail well I had some friends that got
[1:45:05] thrown in jail one time for preaching
[1:45:07] the gospel they sang and the jail shut
[1:45:12] down the Elvis sang about a jailhouse
[1:45:15] rock but they really had won the jail
[1:45:17] shut down what were you what will your
[1:45:23] children be the things that we set
[1:45:26] before our children and we think what's
[1:45:27] just a little thing you know this movie
[1:45:29] over here it only had 15 cuss words and
[1:45:31] and you know there was only there was
[1:45:33] only two or three love scenes and there
[1:45:35] was only you know it wasn't it wasn't
[1:45:37] too bad and and what will our children
[1:45:39] be a blessing prophet 1956 he says do
[1:45:44] you realize old men when we were boys
[1:45:46] our boys has got ten times the
[1:45:49] temptation that we had sister do you
[1:45:52] realize that your daughter has ten times
[1:45:54] the temptation you had when you as a
[1:45:57] girl what will her daughter have look at
[1:46:00] the things that pictures the Devils are
[1:46:02] painting all how we need to pray he said
[1:46:04] now we'll go back to you again brother
[1:46:06] do you realize we don't pray half as
[1:46:09] much as our fathers did pastor do you
[1:46:12] know we don't put as much time on our
[1:46:14] knees as the pastor's did before us
[1:46:16] women do you realize you don't instruct
[1:46:18] your daughters and pray with her at
[1:46:20] night like your mother did you then what
[1:46:22] about it who's guilty we're guilty
[1:46:25] there's no way around it he says we're
[1:46:28] guilty you know I'm sure you don't have
[1:46:31] this problem at your church but I'll
[1:46:33] just tell on our church a little bit
[1:46:34] okay I'll preach on our church a little
[1:46:35] bit while I'm here and I'm away from
[1:46:37] them but we've got some people you know
[1:46:39] that they they can't show up to church
[1:46:42] on time to bring their kids to Sunday
[1:46:44] school and maybe once a month they'll
[1:46:46] get him to Sunday school and so the
[1:46:48] Sunday school teachers have them for
[1:46:49] about 45 minutes once a month
[1:46:52] then they expect their children to know
[1:46:53] everything about God and everything
[1:46:55] about the Bible and everything about the
[1:46:56] message giving them to us for 45 minutes
[1:46:59] a month and yet they can't put anything
[1:47:01] into it they can't have devotions and
[1:47:04] they can't have prayer time with the
[1:47:05] children they can't sit down and teach
[1:47:07] them about the Bible because they're too
[1:47:09] busy because they got to work two jobs
[1:47:10] so that momma can have a boat and daddy
[1:47:12] can have a Mercedes and they can get
[1:47:14] more square footage to the next person
[1:47:16] on the next view or the guy at their job
[1:47:18] and so they work two jobs and the kids
[1:47:20] have babysitters and our grandma watches
[1:47:22] them or whatever and the she's she's too
[1:47:24] tired and too old so she puts the TV in
[1:47:26] front of them to be the babysitter well
[1:47:29] praise the Lord
[1:47:30] yeah we're guilty we're guilty and my
[1:47:41] son I thank God that the technology and
[1:47:44] stuff that he'll face that it wasn't
[1:47:46] around when I was a kid brother Solomon
[1:47:48] because I did a lot of stupid stuff but
[1:47:50] at least I wasn't stupid enough to put
[1:47:51] it up for everybody in the world to see
[1:47:53] what I was doing I did a lot of stupid
[1:47:59] stuff that I thank god there's no
[1:48:01] Facebook account that somebody can go
[1:48:02] back to and say look what brother Nathan
[1:48:04] did 20 years ago well praise the Lord I
[1:48:11] guess I must be at the right church
[1:48:13] after all our boys has got ten times the
[1:48:20] temptation that we had technology was
[1:48:22] just starting to get a start I was the
[1:48:24] first one of our family to have a
[1:48:26] computer and my parents didn't know
[1:48:28] about the Internet they had never had
[1:48:30] the Internet my parents weren't they
[1:48:32] were first-generation message believers
[1:48:34] and they they just assumed that because
[1:48:37] we was in the message that all message
[1:48:38] kids were good they had came out of my
[1:48:40] dad was Pentecostal and then he back
[1:48:42] slid my mom was Methodist and when they
[1:48:44] got married they got married in the
[1:48:45] Methodist Church and and and then
[1:48:47] eventually they came back to the
[1:48:49] Pentecost and they were in the
[1:48:50] Pentecostal denominations for a while
[1:48:52] and then they came into the message and
[1:48:54] I was raised as a message boy so I'm
[1:48:55] sure they thought well he's a message
[1:48:57] boy and he's playing with message
[1:48:58] friends and he would never get into
[1:49:00] anything inappropriate so they put a
[1:49:02] computer in my
[1:49:03] at 13 years old with an internet
[1:49:04] connection in my bedroom
[1:49:06] and I found out that there were things
[1:49:08] that you could stumble across without
[1:49:09] even intentionally going and looking for
[1:49:11] him that I didn't have any idea about
[1:49:13] and it became a stumbling block in a
[1:49:15] trial for many many years it's okay for
[1:49:19] me to preach this morning brother Jack
[1:49:21] and now it's not in the bedroom now my
[1:49:25] boy he's got it right in his hand a cell
[1:49:27] phone that he can take around and
[1:49:29] thankfully his dad I don't see that to
[1:49:31] throw off on my parents they weren't
[1:49:33] intentionally being bad parents they
[1:49:34] didn't want anything bad for me they
[1:49:36] just didn't know about technology it was
[1:49:38] something new but now then God my son
[1:49:41] the phone that he has to slog down he
[1:49:42] can go to four websites he can only
[1:49:48] listen to the music that I've downloaded
[1:49:49] to it he can't download any other music
[1:49:52] if he tries to add an app that he
[1:49:54] doesn't have approved or download music
[1:49:56] it pops up on my phone and says hey your
[1:49:58] son's trying to download this can do you
[1:50:00] want to approve it yes or no and I'm
[1:50:03] gonna leave it that way till you about
[1:50:04] forty brother Solomon but a lot of
[1:50:10] parents don't know that a lot of parents
[1:50:12] don't know that you can lock it down
[1:50:13] like that and so they've got little
[1:50:14] fourteen-year-old boys out here with in
[1:50:17] their hand access to anything in the
[1:50:20] world that they can pop into their mind
[1:50:21] or that they can stumble their way
[1:50:22] through YouTube links or Google Links or
[1:50:25] Google Images define and it becomes a
[1:50:27] stumbling block and it becomes seeds
[1:50:30] that are sown in their life that'll
[1:50:31] cause them problems the rest of their
[1:50:33] life if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and
[1:50:35] grant them deliverance used to if we
[1:50:44] wanted to do something bad brother Jack
[1:50:46] we had to sneak down to the liquor store
[1:50:48] and buy a bottle of alcohol and risk
[1:50:50] being seen or or the boys would go down
[1:50:52] and buy him a pack of cigarettes so
[1:50:54] maybe drive 30 miles so they wouldn't
[1:50:56] risk running into somebody that they
[1:50:58] knew to buy him and they'd have to go
[1:51:00] down and sneak a magazine from a book
[1:51:02] store from from a gas station or
[1:51:04] something but now you can get it all
[1:51:06] right there on your phone if you want an
[1:51:07] alcohol or cigarettes through ever you
[1:51:08] can have Amazon deliver in a nice little
[1:51:10] box and even if you know the Amazon
[1:51:12] liver he don't know what he's delivering
[1:51:13] in the package ten times the temptation
[1:51:21] that we had and half the prayer now I'm
[1:51:25] not a mathematician I don't claim to be
[1:51:26] some some deep college professor but but
[1:51:29] that's some bad calculations right there
[1:51:32] when you have ten times the temptation
[1:51:35] that the previous generation you had
[1:51:37] really you ought to be praying ten times
[1:51:39] as much if you want to overcome but
[1:51:43] instead we pray half as much as the last
[1:51:46] generation with ten times the amount of
[1:51:49] temptation you say oh I don't know about
[1:51:51] those statistics all trust me they're
[1:51:53] good statistics you can look around I
[1:51:55] can see where things have come in the 20
[1:51:57] years since I was a teenager it's come a
[1:52:00] long ways there's a lot of things that
[1:52:02] go on that didn't go on when I was a
[1:52:04] child the technology wives I mean still
[1:52:07] the same sins but it's just been made a
[1:52:09] lot easier Satan's give us easier access
[1:52:11] to it and we saw these seeds and if
[1:52:15] we're not careful it won't just impact
[1:52:17] you it'll impact the next generation
[1:52:19] that's coming along we find that what
[1:52:23] you sow into your church you're gonna
[1:52:26] reap the same thing what it Church sews
[1:52:29] or what you as an individual shows into
[1:52:32] the church if it's Church sews false
[1:52:34] doctrine what is he gonna reap if it's
[1:52:38] church you know when you highbreed
[1:52:39] something brother man talks about you
[1:52:41] know the spoken word was the original
[1:52:43] seed but then how that seed became high
[1:52:45] Brittany said when you high breed
[1:52:46] something you can't breed it back and he
[1:52:48] said when when you take and he said he
[1:52:50] went down there and he was sitting there
[1:52:51] fellowship and with the brother and and
[1:52:53] there was talking he said they had a
[1:52:54] radio playing of the 4-h club there and
[1:52:57] he said they begin to talk about how
[1:52:58] they had this corn that would looked
[1:53:00] exactly the same they had replicated it
[1:53:02] so close to where to lay it down and
[1:53:04] look at it with a microscope you
[1:53:06] couldn't tell which was the real corn
[1:53:07] and which was the manufactured corn and
[1:53:10] he said but there's one way you can tell
[1:53:12] you put them both in the ground and you
[1:53:13] bury them and one will die in rot and
[1:53:16] life will spring back up again and the
[1:53:18] other
[1:53:19] just died in rot right you want to know
[1:53:21] how to prove if I got the Holy Ghost or
[1:53:23] not bury me in the ground when I go if I
[1:53:25] tarry if I if I go before he comes and
[1:53:28] if I come back up again I had it and if
[1:53:30] I don't then I didn't have it you bury a
[1:53:34] quart of wheat in the ground and it dies
[1:53:36] and if it's got life it comes back up
[1:53:38] again and so when you see churches even
[1:53:40] around the message and they begin to
[1:53:42] highbreed the truth with false doctrine
[1:53:45] and with legalism and man-made creeds
[1:53:47] and things and what does it produce you
[1:53:50] see their congregation with it's a
[1:53:52] personality movement once that
[1:53:53] personality goes on it crumbles because
[1:53:57] it was built on a false foundation and
[1:54:00] you see the people and all they can talk
[1:54:01] about is whatever their little false
[1:54:03] doctrine is that they rally around and
[1:54:05] they've got their keywords and they've
[1:54:07] got their triggers and they've got
[1:54:09] things that you can say and they'll just
[1:54:10] make them shout and rejoice and and half
[1:54:12] of them don't even know you ask what is
[1:54:14] it that you believe oh it's a revelation
[1:54:15] I can't tell you well you know what that
[1:54:18] tells me that tells me that some man has
[1:54:20] duped you and you don't even know what
[1:54:22] you believe but you just feel like he's
[1:54:23] anointed and so you're blindly following
[1:54:26] and because starving children will eat
[1:54:27] out of a garbage can and you can't
[1:54:30] produce a real birth from something like
[1:54:32] that
[1:54:33] hey man why because they're reaping what
[1:54:36] they're sowing and then you see a lot of
[1:54:37] those that they get so legalistic and so
[1:54:40] organized that the young people realize
[1:54:41] hey we can't live this and we that we
[1:54:43] don't see anything real in this so they
[1:54:45] all go back to the world and then the
[1:54:47] old people begin to die off in a church
[1:54:48] of 300 or 400 and 500 suddenly becomes a
[1:54:51] church of 12 because they didn't have
[1:54:53] anything real to so you so hurt and
[1:54:57] bitterness
[1:54:58] whether it's coming from the leadership
[1:54:59] of the church or whether you're sowing
[1:55:01] it as an individual in the church what
[1:55:03] are you gonna reap hurt and bitterness
[1:55:05] but you sow encouragement and you're
[1:55:09] gonna receive encouragement now you come
[1:55:15] and and you know we talk about money a
[1:55:16] lot at church and and you know it's
[1:55:20] something that you know gets a little
[1:55:21] touchy and and and I don't know a
[1:55:24] brother Jack can he can talk to me
[1:55:25] afterwards or correct me afterwards once
[1:55:27] I go or
[1:55:28] tell you brother Nathan was wrong on
[1:55:30] this if he feels like I am but I believe
[1:55:31] there's a difference between encouraging
[1:55:33] giving and preaching prosperity now
[1:55:37] there's a lot of people that'll preach
[1:55:39] prosperity oh if you give to the church
[1:55:42] you know that you see them get up with
[1:55:44] their smiles and their million-dollar
[1:55:45] tuxes and they'll tell you God wants you
[1:55:48] to have a Ferrari well I'll just be
[1:55:50] honest God doesn't care if I have a
[1:55:52] Ferrari or not God really doesn't care a
[1:55:56] man God wants me to be able to get from
[1:55:58] point A to point B and if I want to go
[1:56:01] in debt and have to scrimp and save and
[1:56:04] stress and and be pressure on me and my
[1:56:06] family because I got a more expensive
[1:56:08] way to get to one at point A to point B
[1:56:10] or if I get something that I pay cash
[1:56:12] for and it gets me to point A to point B
[1:56:14] without the stress and the debt and all
[1:56:16] that you know God God doesn't really
[1:56:18] care at the brand of vehicle that I
[1:56:19] Drive I know there's a lot of people
[1:56:20] that they want to preach their vehicle
[1:56:22] brand doctrine or whatever because of
[1:56:24] whatever they lean - oh brother
[1:56:25] branham's drove a four-door all the
[1:56:27] disciples were in one Accord so we're
[1:56:29] gonna drive Honda's or whatever would be
[1:56:30] but but Jesus really doesn't put a lot
[1:56:37] of thought I don't think into what car I
[1:56:39] Drive he didn't promise me a mansion
[1:56:44] that over here and I promise me one over
[1:56:46] there he didn't promise me a Rolex he
[1:56:50] did give me an Apple watch that I like
[1:56:51] cuz I can text people when I'm driving
[1:56:53] just talk to it and it'll text them you
[1:56:55] have to make sure sometimes because
[1:56:56] sometimes Siri makes you say say things
[1:56:58] you didn't mean to say and you say God
[1:57:00] forgive me I didn't say that word how
[1:57:03] did she say that she's trying to get me
[1:57:06] in trouble he didn't promise me a Rolex
[1:57:15] he didn't promise me thousand dollar
[1:57:17] suits and things he promised that my
[1:57:20] needs would be supplied and I can say by
[1:57:23] the grace of God this morning my needs
[1:57:25] are supplied I don't have the biggest
[1:57:28] Church the biggest hero I don't have
[1:57:30] that either I don't have the biggest
[1:57:31] Church I don't have the biggest house of
[1:57:33] all the people in our church I don't
[1:57:34] have the newest cars but I've got cars
[1:57:36] that get me from point A to point B I've
[1:57:38] got some
[1:57:39] cars are better than some of the people
[1:57:41] in our congregation then we got other
[1:57:42] people in our congregation to have
[1:57:44] better cars than I do and I don't look
[1:57:45] at them and say say well God why do you
[1:57:47] why didn't you know I spend more time
[1:57:48] praying than brother so-and-so does why
[1:57:50] didn't you bless me with a car like he
[1:57:52] did he blessed me I'm content if he
[1:57:55] blesses me more I'll be content with
[1:57:57] that and if he takes away what I got by
[1:57:59] the grace of God I'll be content with
[1:58:00] that because Paul said I've learned
[1:58:02] whatsoever state I'm in there with to be
[1:58:03] content does that mean that we shouldn't
[1:58:06] learn something better for our family no
[1:58:08] it's okay to want something better for
[1:58:10] your family as long as that doesn't
[1:58:11] become an idol to you and become more
[1:58:14] important to you than the Word of God
[1:58:15] and and coming to church and having time
[1:58:18] with God you know it's okay to 1 good
[1:58:19] things but our ambition should be for
[1:58:21] more of Jesus it's okay to have ambition
[1:58:26] but our main ambition should be for more
[1:58:28] of Jesus let me just say this and maybe
[1:58:35] I'll get in trouble again but if your
[1:58:37] ambition is so focused on your career
[1:58:39] that it's taking you more and more and
[1:58:42] more away from church then you need to
[1:58:44] reevaluate your priorities all brother
[1:58:49] Nathan I got this job offer and it's ten
[1:58:51] thousand dollars more a year but I'm
[1:58:53] gonna have to travel ninety percent of
[1:58:54] time what would you do I would be
[1:58:56] content in the state that I'm in because
[1:58:59] if you sit out at church the prophet of
[1:59:02] God said you will spiritually wither up
[1:59:04] and die and ten years down the road you
[1:59:11] might have a bit better car than brother
[1:59:13] Jack has you might have a nicer home
[1:59:15] than brother Jack has and your children
[1:59:18] might be sitting there saying daddy they
[1:59:20] said this in Sunday school about Noah
[1:59:21] why haven't you ever told us about Noah
[1:59:23] I was too busy traveling so that we
[1:59:26] could buy a bigger boat what are you so
[1:59:30] you'll reap what would you do brother
[1:59:33] Nathan I've had people ask me about
[1:59:34] moving to different places and things
[1:59:36] what would if he was gonna move would
[1:59:37] you move for a job if there was a good
[1:59:40] Christian Church that I could go to and
[1:59:41] I felt led to I would move for a job but
[1:59:45] I wouldn't move to a job out in Timbuktu
[1:59:48] where there's no church well I just stay
[1:59:49] at home and streamed I'll just say
[1:59:51] home and listen to tapes yeah I've seen
[1:59:52] families like that and I've seen what
[1:59:54] their children are like and I've seen
[1:59:56] what what it produces in their marriage
[1:59:58] and I wouldn't encourage it to anybody a
[2:00:01] man if somebody offered me a million
[2:00:03] dollars a year to move somewhere where
[2:00:05] there was no church I wouldn't do it oh
[2:00:09] you just say that brother Nathan cuz
[2:00:10] you're a pastor not promised you before
[2:00:12] the Lord I wouldn't do it I wouldn't
[2:00:14] move somewhere where my children would
[2:00:15] suffer because they couldn't be in
[2:00:17] church and wither up and spiritually die
[2:00:19] so that I could say hey see what I'm
[2:00:21] driving we think about that I'm the man
[2:00:24] no he's the man and that job situation
[2:00:32] might change and then you're stuck in
[2:00:33] Timbuktu without enough money to get
[2:00:35] back home to where you came from
[2:00:37] well I believe in encouraging giving but
[2:00:40] I don't believe in preaching prosperity
[2:00:41] all if you just give a little more in
[2:00:43] the basket then God's gonna bless you
[2:00:45] little bit more well he might but if
[2:00:46] you're given with those intentions then
[2:00:48] you're given for the wrong reasons God
[2:00:50] loves a cheerful giver not a stingy
[2:00:52] Giver Lord I'll give you 20 if you'll
[2:00:54] give me 40 but like like we said you get
[2:01:00] what you put in oh my then there's
[2:01:03] people that won't support the church
[2:01:04] they make too much to pay tithes or they
[2:01:07] make too little to make tithes you know
[2:01:08] there's never any you never do seem to
[2:01:10] find somebody that's just right there in
[2:01:11] the middle and they they make just
[2:01:13] enough to where they can pay tithes you
[2:01:17] know it's like Goldilocks and the three
[2:01:19] bears oh you know is this not enough
[2:01:21] tithe to pay I'm too poor I can't pay or
[2:01:24] or Lord I've got too much money I
[2:01:25] couldn't pay tithes on this but well
[2:01:27] then there's the ones that's just right
[2:01:29] right in the middle lord I finally
[2:01:30] reached that exact dollar amount where I
[2:01:32] can pay tithes for a little while and
[2:01:36] people won't support the church they
[2:01:38] want to see the church dragged on but
[2:01:40] then but then when they need help and
[2:01:42] when they don't have a job who's the
[2:01:46] first person they come to buy the jagan
[2:01:48] you know that job that I've been missing
[2:01:51] church so much for then I made too much
[2:01:55] money to pay tithes because I was yeah
[2:01:58] they they eliminated my position and you
[2:02:03] know that house that I bought because I
[2:02:04] was
[2:02:05] taking so much I'm having a really hard
[2:02:06] time making that payment so you think
[2:02:08] the church could help well you get what
[2:02:10] you put in god help us
[2:02:22] laying up my treasures in that home
[2:02:24] above how much are we laying up over
[2:02:25] there and I'm not just talking about
[2:02:27] dollars and since this morning but how
[2:02:29] much time do we put into it a lot of
[2:02:32] times people dragging in an hour late
[2:02:34] instead of getting there half an hour an
[2:02:35] hour early and praying for the service
[2:02:37] and they say I didn't get much out of
[2:02:39] church well you did you missed the whole
[2:02:42] worship service and you came in you were
[2:02:44] still thinking about what you and your
[2:02:45] wife argued about in the parking lot and
[2:02:47] how she was yelling at you for running
[2:02:49] that stoplight and I'm sure there's
[2:02:50] nobody like that here this morning but
[2:02:52] we're just talking you know and and and
[2:02:54] and you still all worked up and
[2:02:55] frustrated and and you know her hairs
[2:02:58] hanging down in her face cuz she ran out
[2:02:59] the door and didn't get it all up or
[2:03:01] just right and then the Sun just began
[2:03:03] to wilt it all down and and you get in
[2:03:05] your frazzle and you sit there and then
[2:03:06] you think now I was so busy and so late
[2:03:09] that I didn't get any breakfast all you
[2:03:10] can think about is lunch all the way
[2:03:11] through the service you know then you've
[2:03:18] got people that they want to tell the
[2:03:20] pastor who they can help now look
[2:03:22] brother Jack I'll pay tithe but I don't
[2:03:25] want you helping so and so with my
[2:03:26] tithes don't you help so-and-so you know
[2:03:29] because I they're they're just too lazy
[2:03:31] no good for nothing nobody and either
[2:03:33] you can do what you want with my tithes
[2:03:35] but don't you help son so well whose
[2:03:37] times do you think it was to help she
[2:03:38] when you needed help and then we've got
[2:03:43] people that they sow seeds of talking
[2:03:45] bad about the church or talking bad
[2:03:47] about the pastor or talking bad about
[2:03:49] the musicians or the song I didn't like
[2:03:51] the way they did this they sang too long
[2:03:52] well this guy over here says they didn't
[2:03:54] sing long enough and this one says they
[2:03:56] sing too loud and this one says I
[2:03:57] couldn't hear it I wish they would have
[2:03:58] turned it up and and you know this one
[2:04:00] says they had the temperature too cold
[2:04:01] and I was about to freeze to death and
[2:04:03] I'm have to start bringing two blankets
[2:04:04] instead of one and then the other one
[2:04:06] says oh no I was about I was about to
[2:04:08] roast to death they couldn't turn it
[2:04:10] down low enough for me is there
[2:04:11] something wrong with the
[2:04:12] see and when we leave church that's the
[2:04:16] things that we take away instead of all
[2:04:18] my the presence of God was there and the
[2:04:20] pastor preached and we're talking about
[2:04:22] the thermostat and we're talking about
[2:04:25] the temperature of the water is the
[2:04:26] water heater broke because I can never
[2:04:28] could get the water hot enough to really
[2:04:29] get my hands watched the way that I
[2:04:30] wanted to and and we begin to focus on
[2:04:33] all of those things and and what do you
[2:04:35] get you get what you receive you get
[2:04:37] what you put in you receive what you put
[2:04:39] in you know there was some parents in
[2:04:41] the days of Elijah that they said around
[2:04:43] the dinner table and they'd all they had
[2:04:44] was to say was negative things about
[2:04:46] Elijah's ministry he preached too long
[2:04:48] he preached too hard he got on this
[2:04:50] topic doesn't he know I've got a nephew
[2:04:51] that struggles with that why would he
[2:04:53] preach that with me sitting there and so
[2:04:56] he came out one day and these little
[2:04:59] children that said at the dinner table
[2:05:00] came out and said hail ball head why
[2:05:02] don't you go up like Elijah did they
[2:05:04] didn't make that up on their own they
[2:05:07] said at the dinner table and heard that
[2:05:08] and a prophet got angry and curse those
[2:05:11] children to see bears came out and ate
[2:05:13] them we were worried about kittens
[2:05:15] earlier what about little children the
[2:05:18] Bears came out and ate them brother him
[2:05:20] said that wasn't the Holy Spirit it
[2:05:21] wasn't the nature of a Holy Spirit it
[2:05:23] was an angry prophet and it wasn't the
[2:05:26] children's fault it was the parents
[2:05:28] fault because what they had put before
[2:05:29] him and many times will show things well
[2:05:31] I don't agree with brother so-and-so and
[2:05:33] I don't like the way he runs his service
[2:05:34] and I don't like this over here and over
[2:05:36] there and then our children go to a
[2:05:37] youth camp or something and sitting
[2:05:38] there and that Minister gets up and
[2:05:40] maybe the Holy Spirit wanting to use him
[2:05:42] to impact those children to make a
[2:05:44] change in their life and they said their
[2:05:46] thing I remember what daddy said about
[2:05:48] him ain't nobody he a nobody he teaches
[2:05:52] this and he's up here and he's up there
[2:05:53] and and Satan has soda seed that hinders
[2:05:57] that child and undermines what God is
[2:06:00] trying to do before your family through
[2:06:03] that ministry but you so love and mercy
[2:06:06] and forgiveness and then what's going to
[2:06:09] come back to you love and mercy and
[2:06:11] forgiveness the leadership of the church
[2:06:12] souls balance they sew the word they sew
[2:06:16] faith they're gonna receive things from
[2:06:18] that it's gonna produce things and the
[2:06:20] people that they're leading what are you
[2:06:23] so into your marriage
[2:06:24] you sew into your family I'm trying to
[2:06:26] close but I feel like we're maybe not
[2:06:28] done quite yet what he's so into your
[2:06:32] marriage what are you so into your
[2:06:33] family you're gonna reap back those same
[2:06:35] things if you saw an atmosphere of fear
[2:06:39] what's it gonna produce now there's
[2:06:43] different types of fear there's a fear
[2:06:44] of you know some some Overlord that's
[2:06:47] gonna bless God you better shut your
[2:06:48] mouth boy I brought you into this role I
[2:06:50] can take you back there's that type of
[2:06:53] fear rule in a house with fear like that
[2:06:56] with a ruler of iron but then there's
[2:06:59] another type of fear that's just afraid
[2:07:00] of everything that all did we lock the
[2:07:02] doors and we check it 500 times and did
[2:07:04] you sanitize your hands and and oh don't
[2:07:07] go outside because you might get my mitt
[2:07:08] my mosquito that's packing a disease or
[2:07:10] and if we're not careful we live in an
[2:07:12] atmosphere of fear afraid to do anything
[2:07:15] and you saw an atmosphere of fear to
[2:07:18] your children and it's gonna produce a
[2:07:20] child that grows up afraid of everything
[2:07:22] you so anger maybe oh maybe you say I
[2:07:25] don't get angry with my children I don't
[2:07:27] get angry with my wife maybe it's not
[2:07:28] that maybe it's somebody at church that
[2:07:30] you're angry with or maybe it's somebody
[2:07:32] in your extended family that you're
[2:07:34] angry with and all you can sow is
[2:07:35] bitterness because of that bless God if
[2:07:37] I ever get a chance I'll get even with
[2:07:39] them and you allow that bitterness and
[2:07:41] that hurt towards family you you so that
[2:07:44] and what's it gonna produce in those
[2:07:46] children that you're raising up you talk
[2:07:49] bad about your spouse in front of your
[2:07:51] children and then you expect them to
[2:07:52] treat their spouse the right way when
[2:07:54] they grow up what have you sowed brother
[2:08:00] branham said he said I'm a Kentuckian
[2:08:02] united we stand divided we fall and he's
[2:08:05] talking about as a nation and as a
[2:08:06] church but I want to bring that down to
[2:08:08] the family as well brother Graham said
[2:08:09] when that when the family when the
[2:08:11] children lose respect for the parents he
[2:08:13] said the family's gone that home is
[2:08:15] ruined and he said when the when the
[2:08:18] church loses respect for the pastor that
[2:08:20] church is gone why because of things
[2:08:24] that have been sowed and when we begin
[2:08:27] you know if we don't stand together I
[2:08:30] believe it was it was one of the
[2:08:32] founding fathers said if we don't stand
[2:08:35] too
[2:08:36] then stick together then we'll surely
[2:08:37] all hang together and many times the
[2:08:42] very things that destroys families and
[2:08:44] destroys homes and destroys churches
[2:08:46] maryam said it's not the Robin that's
[2:08:48] pecking away from the outside somebody
[2:08:50] come in from the outside trying to
[2:08:51] destroy it's the worm that's eaten away
[2:08:53] at it at the core and many times we're
[2:08:56] sewing things that destroy families and
[2:08:58] destroy churches why because we allowed
[2:09:01] that to come in and we allowed it to be
[2:09:03] projected and many times if we're not
[2:09:04] careful where the very ones that's
[2:09:07] hurting ourselves if we're not careful
[2:09:10] we'll destroy the example of how our
[2:09:12] children should treat their spouse but
[2:09:14] if you saw an atmosphere of love and
[2:09:17] acceptance not just saying the words I
[2:09:19] love you and I accept you but it's
[2:09:21] really truly showing that child you know
[2:09:23] I told my children many times I've tried
[2:09:26] to encourage them don't lied to me a man
[2:09:28] if they just tell me the truth or
[2:09:30] whatever it is that they've done the
[2:09:31] punishment will be much less if they
[2:09:33] just tell me the truth and don't lie to
[2:09:34] me about it and I'm trying to create an
[2:09:36] atmosphere where they can be a confident
[2:09:39] to come to me and tell me look daddy hey
[2:09:40] I made a mistake I did this and I want
[2:09:43] to be that person brother Solomon that
[2:09:44] they can come and talk to you about that
[2:09:46] because if not they'll go and talk to
[2:09:47] somebody else about it brother Ben said
[2:09:49] you Mother's he said all nice and some
[2:09:51] of the doctors had said oh just let the
[2:09:53] babies cry it out he said sounded like a
[2:09:54] witch doctor to me more than a real
[2:09:56] doctor and he said that child needs your
[2:09:59] love that child needs your love II said
[2:10:02] if you don't give it love it'll find
[2:10:04] somebody that will you wonder why
[2:10:07] there's so many sisters that run out and
[2:10:09] they wind up having children out of
[2:10:11] wedlock and having all kinds of problems
[2:10:12] and things why a lot of times it's
[2:10:14] because they had daddy issues or mommy
[2:10:16] issues that nobody would love them at
[2:10:18] home so they had to run out and find
[2:10:20] somebody that would show them love
[2:10:21] because of seeds that were sown because
[2:10:25] of seeds that were sown let me tell you
[2:10:27] this morning young people Satan will try
[2:10:30] to destroy your life if you'll allow him
[2:10:32] to he will try to destroy your life at a
[2:10:35] young age he'll put some slicker in your
[2:10:37] way that'll just say all the right
[2:10:38] things and do all the right things and
[2:10:40] you think oh he loves me and I've never
[2:10:42] been loved before no no he's probably
[2:10:44] got different intentions than just love
[2:10:50] but I pray that God will send somebody
[2:10:52] along to you that will really love you
[2:10:54] that won't just look into your eyes and
[2:10:56] compliments your body but he'll
[2:10:58] appreciate your mind and your spirit and
[2:11:00] your stand for the word of God because
[2:11:03] let me let's just be honest and may I
[2:11:05] may have said it here before but I'll
[2:11:06] say it again you know if you're looking
[2:11:08] for somebody I don't know how many
[2:11:09] single here I want to ask you to raise
[2:11:11] your hand but if you're single and
[2:11:12] you're looking for somebody there ain't
[2:11:14] nobody that go shopping down at the
[2:11:15] nursing home
[2:11:19] there ain't nothing attractive there
[2:11:27] brother Jack might go to preach to
[2:11:29] people in the in the nursing home I
[2:11:31] guarantee you when he was when he was at
[2:11:32] the dating age before him and sister
[2:11:34] Erica met he wasn't going down to the
[2:11:36] nursing home saying oh I'm gonna find me
[2:11:38] a honey because time time fades away a
[2:11:45] lot of that attraction part and so a lot
[2:11:47] of times we go out just looking for
[2:11:49] attraction and I thank God that I found
[2:11:51] an attractive wife I thank God that
[2:11:52] there was attraction but I didn't marry
[2:11:54] her for attraction because if we live
[2:11:55] fifty more years a lot of that will have
[2:11:57] faded and I'm not just talking about her
[2:11:58] and trust me it's already starting to
[2:12:00] fade right here I didn't have all these
[2:12:07] gray hairs when I married her brother
[2:12:11] Solomon had hair when he married his but
[2:12:15] thankfully brothers Solomon has a nice
[2:12:17] shaped head I don't think I would look
[2:12:18] as good bald as he did so I pray that
[2:12:21] God gives me a full head of hair till
[2:12:22] I'm about 90 but if he doesn't you might
[2:12:25] look at me and if you're sitting behind
[2:12:27] me in a service you'd be be distracted
[2:12:29] by the knots and things sticking out and
[2:12:30] think my goodness his head ain't shaped
[2:12:33] like brother Solomon's God God must be
[2:12:36] paying him back for something but I
[2:12:44] married her because of character because
[2:12:47] I recognize she loved the word and she
[2:12:50] loved me and it wasn't just because of
[2:12:52] my hair it wasn't just because of my
[2:12:54] brown eyes it was because there was
[2:12:58] something there but I REM said
[2:13:00] said when you really find somebody that
[2:13:02] you love and it's not just some physical
[2:13:04] thing because hey trust me if it's just
[2:13:08] a physical thing then 20 years agos down
[2:13:10] the road and he'll trade you in for a
[2:13:12] newer model or vice versa
[2:13:16] you see we just said that about the men
[2:13:18] but in this age it's the women doing it
[2:13:20] too
[2:13:20] they like those younger boys a lot of
[2:13:22] the women today I don't it's six some of
[2:13:25] the stuff that goes on out here but a
[2:13:31] lot of it's because of seeds that was
[2:13:32] sown seeds that was some one but we
[2:13:38] should so we should so an atmosphere of
[2:13:40] love an atmosphere to accept our
[2:13:43] children and say look even if you make a
[2:13:45] mistake I love you anyhow I won't agree
[2:13:48] with it I might not agree with your
[2:13:49] lifestyle may not agree with your
[2:13:51] decisions but I'll love you anyhow and
[2:13:53] I'll be here and Jesus will be here
[2:13:55] waiting for you when you get as
[2:13:56] desperate as the prodigal son didn't you
[2:13:58] come back home I'll be waiting right
[2:13:59] here for you
[2:14:00] we saw those kind of things and it'll
[2:14:03] produce something in our children's
[2:14:04] lives Oh mine see marriage is a two-way
[2:14:08] street give and take a lot of times
[2:14:12] people you see marriages and you can
[2:14:13] tell which ones the giver and which ones
[2:14:15] the taker but it should be give-and-take
[2:14:17] a friendship just a friendship brother
[2:14:20] Jack and I you know he's one of my
[2:14:21] closest friends you know why because we
[2:14:24] have a friendship that's give-and-take
[2:14:26] and he doesn't always come to me and
[2:14:28] just brother Nathan I need this and
[2:14:30] brother Nathan I want that and I don't
[2:14:31] just always go to him and say brother
[2:14:32] Jack I need your time I need your
[2:14:34] attention I need your money I need this
[2:14:36] I need that but it's give-and-take and
[2:14:37] sometimes he's encouraging me and
[2:14:39] sometimes I'm encouraging him and
[2:14:41] sometimes he's inviting me to preach and
[2:14:43] sometimes I'm inviting him to preach and
[2:14:45] and sometimes you know he's asking me a
[2:14:47] question of something I've dealt with
[2:14:49] and sometimes I'm asking him a question
[2:14:50] of something that he's dealt with but
[2:14:52] one-sided friendships don't work
[2:14:54] one-sided marriages don't work one-sided
[2:14:58] churches don't work when the leadership
[2:15:01] is trying their best the son leader is
[2:15:03] trying his best to get you in an
[2:15:05] atmosphere and you're sitting there
[2:15:08] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:15:13] them well why don't you tell your face
[2:15:14] to show it every once in a while what we
[2:15:21] sell we reap what you put into church
[2:15:24] you're gonna get out what you put into
[2:15:26] your marriage what you put into your
[2:15:27] children you're gonna get those things
[2:15:29] out now sometimes it's not instantaneous
[2:15:31] sometimes we sow something if we're not
[2:15:33] careful we go back out there you know
[2:15:36] our our children were a science project
[2:15:38] that they had recently was to plant some
[2:15:40] seeds and two of them their seeds came
[2:15:42] up real nice and one of them it wasn't
[2:15:44] coming up at all and finally mama
[2:15:45] switched the pots around I think and
[2:15:47] gave one of the kids her pot because
[2:15:49] that seed must have been a hybrid or
[2:15:50] something it wasn't coming out but you
[2:15:52] know what if you plant a seed and then a
[2:15:54] day later you go out there and you say
[2:15:56] oh my that that seed I wonder how it's
[2:16:00] doing you pull back the dirt and you
[2:16:01] look at it I don't see nothing I don't
[2:16:04] see no roots I don't see nothing you put
[2:16:06] it back in bury it back up and give it a
[2:16:09] little bit of water and scoot it out
[2:16:10] closer to the Sun and you come back the
[2:16:13] next morning you keep checking it up
[2:16:14] what are you gonna do it's never gonna
[2:16:15] grow because you keep digging the thing
[2:16:17] up and that's why a lot of problems
[2:16:19] marriages and friendships and church
[2:16:22] relationships fail because you keep
[2:16:24] digging stuff back up
[2:16:25] I thought we buried that yeah brother
[2:16:32] Jack I know I heard she but I thought
[2:16:34] you forgave me of that why every time I
[2:16:35] talk to you on the phone you got to
[2:16:37] bring it back up again you got to throw
[2:16:39] it in my face again why you keep digging
[2:16:41] it back up and we plant you know Oral
[2:16:44] Roberts talked about sowing his seed
[2:16:45] faith and we put some money into the
[2:16:47] church so we we want to dig it up all
[2:16:49] the time well why hasn't this happen and
[2:16:51] why hasn't that happen why hasn't God
[2:16:52] blessed me of this stop digging it up oh
[2:16:55] you plant something in your marriage and
[2:16:57] all mine you know I'm gonna do something
[2:17:00] for my wife I'm gonna do something I'm
[2:17:02] gonna show her that I still
[2:17:04] got a little bit of romance I'm gonna
[2:17:05] buy her some flowers for Valentine's Day
[2:17:09] anybody still do that god bless you
[2:17:17] brother it's their birthday I'm gonna go
[2:17:21] out and get her some chocolates so I'm
[2:17:22] gonna go out and do this so I'm going to
[2:17:23] I'm going to show her that I can still
[2:17:25] wine and dine her like I did when I was
[2:17:27] 18 and thought I was something you say
[2:17:30] oh we don't we don't do just don't go
[2:17:32] there brother Nathan we know where the
[2:17:34] RAM said she's still your sweethearts
[2:17:37] now don't you go home and tell mommy I
[2:17:39] said all this no she still gets flowers
[2:17:44] and chocolates maybe not as frequently
[2:17:46] as she used to but she still does she's
[2:17:49] still my sweetheart brother Bram said
[2:17:50] she should always be your sweetheart
[2:17:52] said that honeymoon should never die the
[2:17:57] problem with a lot of marriages is you
[2:17:58] let the honeymoon die life got too busy
[2:18:02] the kids got too noisy your priorities
[2:18:05] got different and now what did you sow
[2:18:10] into it you can tell sometimes at a
[2:18:14] church I don't want brother Jackson
[2:18:16] awful far away from sister Erica for me
[2:18:18] to preach on this but but he's the
[2:18:21] pastor so he's up here because of his
[2:18:22] position but sometimes you see in a
[2:18:25] message church you see the the you know
[2:18:27] that those two that used to you couldn't
[2:18:29] tell you know where his part of the pew
[2:18:31] stopped and hid her started and they
[2:18:33] were so they was holding hands in church
[2:18:35] and when they worship they was
[2:18:37] worshipping together clasp fingers up in
[2:18:42] the air thank you Jesus and then you
[2:18:46] look and there's a Bible case in between
[2:18:48] them and now his hand goes up during one
[2:18:53] song and then her song her hand goes up
[2:18:56] in the next song
[2:18:58] pastor starts preaching on the women he
[2:19:00] amends a little ladder starts preaching
[2:19:03] on the men she amens a little louder
[2:19:05] then before you know he was gonna be
[2:19:07] real spirit so he's gonna sit on the
[2:19:08] front row
[2:19:09] leave her back there
[2:19:11] here's many spiritual he's spiritual
[2:19:14] he's got to be closer to the anointing
[2:19:25] you wonder why don't get invited out to
[2:19:28] preach as much as I used to
[2:19:32] somebody said brother Nathan's just
[2:19:34] meddling tonight this morning he's metal
[2:19:36] no come tonight if you want to see
[2:19:38] Medellin God's good isn't he
[2:19:43] I mean what are you doing brother Nathan
[2:19:45] he's trying to beat people I'm trying to
[2:19:47] encourage you so the right seeds so the
[2:19:51] right seeds you want to get something
[2:19:53] out of church put something into it
[2:19:56] somebody said all my you mister good
[2:19:58] service the other night I know but it
[2:20:01] was double overtime now that might mean
[2:20:04] you pay your job or it might mean you
[2:20:06] know the Miami Heat or whatever but when
[2:20:08] the preacher goes into double overtime
[2:20:10] you're upset but when your favorite team
[2:20:13] does you're ready to run the aisles
[2:20:14] shout hallelujah maybe we should just
[2:20:19] dismiss and go home so the right things
[2:20:23] so the right things into your children
[2:20:26] you won't regret it
[2:20:27] it'll produce real men and women of the
[2:20:29] next generation take the time for them
[2:20:32] all we take time for golf and we take
[2:20:34] time for fur and watch our favorite team
[2:20:36] we take time to go see our favorite
[2:20:38] movie and we take time to go do this and
[2:20:40] go do that and we take time to
[2:20:41] fellowship with brother so-and-so who's
[2:20:43] our buddy and we take time to spend with
[2:20:45] our boss that we're trying to get a
[2:20:46] promotion from many times the kids sit
[2:20:48] there and daddy when are you gonna spend
[2:20:49] time with me when you gonna do so when
[2:20:51] are you gonna take me and throw a ball
[2:20:52] what are you gonna do this oh there
[2:20:54] might be a lot of things that you regret
[2:20:55] 40 years down the road but spending time
[2:20:58] with your wife and children I've never
[2:20:59] seen anybody on their deathbed say I
[2:21:01] wish I'd spit last time they might say a
[2:21:09] lot of things but that's not what they
[2:21:10] say no I wish I'd spent less time
[2:21:16] reading my Bible you don't hear things
[2:21:18] like that what did they regret I wish I
[2:21:21] wish I hadn't been such a workaholic I
[2:21:24] I hadn't been chained and whatever this
[2:21:25] was setting sin was so much that I lost
[2:21:27] out on time with my wife and my children
[2:21:29] I wish I hadn't worked so much overtime
[2:21:31] and missed so much Church I wish I had
[2:21:34] been there when sister so-and-so got the
[2:21:35] Holy Ghost I wish I'd been there when
[2:21:37] that crippled brother ran the aisles I
[2:21:39] wish I had been there so the right
[2:21:42] things a man we could go on and on but
[2:21:45] I'll stop let's bow our heads
[2:21:48] Heavenly Father Lord we just asked that
[2:21:50] you'd help us help us to sew the right
[2:21:53] things Lord whether to the church to our
[2:21:56] family our children our life our friends
[2:22:00] Lord if we don't put anything in we're
[2:22:02] not going to receive anything out lord
[2:22:04] help us to sew the right things I pray
[2:22:06] father help our priorities Lord so many
[2:22:09] times the pressures of the age
[2:22:11] the fast pace of the age everything fast
[2:22:14] and super and incredible and Lord it
[2:22:17] gets so much pressure and so much time
[2:22:21] consuming on us that if we're not
[2:22:22] careful we turn around we realize we
[2:22:24] forgot to read our Bible today and we
[2:22:25] forgot to spend time talking to you
[2:22:27] today and we didn't have time to really
[2:22:30] talk to our wife at the end of the day
[2:22:31] and see how her day was and we didn't
[2:22:33] have time to tuck the children in bed
[2:22:35] and do devotions with them and and we
[2:22:37] lose out on so many of these
[2:22:38] opportunities that we could be sowing
[2:22:40] Lord sometimes with good intentions Lord
[2:22:42] sometimes it's just Lord we want to
[2:22:44] provide for our family or we want to do
[2:22:45] different things Lord to relax our mind
[2:22:48] or whatever it be Lord sometimes it's
[2:22:50] not an evil thing that we're doing but
[2:22:52] Lord may our priorities be right lord
[2:22:54] help us to put you at the very first and
[2:22:56] foremost in center of our life Lord
[2:22:58] Jesus may nothing become an idol above
[2:23:01] that father the Lord helped us to sow
[2:23:04] the right things for the kingdom of God
[2:23:05] Lord may we not look back in the years
[2:23:08] to come with regrets of if I had only
[2:23:10] did this differently if I'd only spent
[2:23:12] my time more wisely
[2:23:13] but Lord may we may we cherish every
[2:23:16] moment Lord Lord some of the most
[2:23:19] valuable things that we can have is our
[2:23:21] time Lord that how we spend that Lord we
[2:23:24] might we might waste money here and
[2:23:26] there and we might waste different
[2:23:27] things but Lord if we waste our time we
[2:23:29] can never get that back help us Lord
[2:23:32] Jesus to spend it wisely
[2:23:33] help us to be up and doing things for
[2:23:36] the kingdom of God
[2:23:37] things that's going to Lourdes instill
[2:23:39] the right characteristics and our
[2:23:40] children and things that's going to be
[2:23:42] of value to them and things that'll be
[2:23:44] fond memories that we can look back in
[2:23:46] years to come and think all by I'm so
[2:23:48] glad I did this with my wife and my
[2:23:50] children I'm so glad I took the time so
[2:23:53] glad I made them a priority Lord but

[2:29:08] [Music]
[2:29:12] we certainly thank the Lord for his word
[2:29:16] on today
[2:29:18] the Bible tells us that whom the Lord
[2:29:20] loves he corrects and you know a few
[2:29:26] weeks ago I came here to the church and
[2:29:28] I preached a sermon on it's an inside
[2:29:31] job
[2:29:32] there's things that need to have it on
[2:29:34] the inside and I believe brother Nathan
[2:29:38] just kind of picked up on some of that
[2:29:39] because you know I was even this morning
[2:29:42] I had a little thought in prayer about a
[2:29:44] seed if you take a seed and you place it
[2:29:46] in the ground you have to commit it to
[2:29:49] the earth you have to commit it to the
[2:29:52] earth because if you dig it up
[2:29:55] you'll never get fruit from what you
[2:29:57] planted a man and the only way you gonna
[2:30:00] get fruit is you have to leave it on the
