to see familiar faces and amen and brother Troy good to see you and uh amen of course we're the Capers we never miss him I miss seeing him I mean we miss him when we don't see him but we know amen so God bless you and all the other familiar faces amen as our God bless you we uh we had a service last night uh down in Pompano with the Spanish group down there and brother kwaku and uh Josue came down and the other brother up again name he's back there God bless you they can come down to be a part of his service and uh so we because brother Josue was there we we uh roped him into interpreting for me last night so so it was a real blessing and he did he did very well amen so we were certainly encouraged by by having them there it just added to the service and so we we trust that that will be maybe a continued uh encouraged me for the Saints down there uh they did it they they don't have a pastor and so so just keep them in prayer in prayer and we're hoping that maybe these brothers brother cueco maybe can uh uh maybe go down there and help them once in a while so so we don't have to make the trip across the state so often amen we don't mind doing it I mean whatever we can do for the kingdom but but they're right here much closer than we are so amen so we're very very happy for that so amen so let's let's turn our bibles if you have your Bibles this morning and bring your greetings from the church back home it was always called The Church in Sarasota but it's really the church in Myakka city so amen so greetings from all of you and uh from them to all of you from the Danny and the the Saints there so amen so let's turn to Luke chapter four and let's look at verse 14 for our scripture reading this morning and I want to I want to take a thought from this uh power power is knowing who you are power is knowing who you are so I trust you'll be a blessing to you so Luke 14 let's start verse at verse 14. and Luke 4 14 sorry Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for the Reed and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and he opened the book and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were into synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bury him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which preceded out of his mouth and they said it's not this Joseph's son this bar has one more time lord we just ask now as we have read your Eternal Word we ask that you'll bless it and make it real to our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated power is knowing who you are the African slave that we always talk about conducted himself as the son of a king because he knew who he was and knowing that he was a King's son empowered it empowered him to act accordingly amen the knowledge of knowing where he came from gave him the courage that he needed and his captivity and the condition he was in had nothing to do with who he was and I I think that's what we need to remember for ourselves the condition we're in whatever it might be has nothing nothing to do with Who We Are amen amen so as we we read uh read the scripture here and amen about Jesus and uh Jesus had just returned from What's called the Great temptation of our Lord Jesus and uh he returned from this and and you know it was a it was not an easy thing for the Lord Amen in this condition because you know Satan knows when to come to you and how to come to you amen he knows your weakness and when he came to Jesus here was when Jesus was in his weakest condition perhaps physically speaking because he had just come over 40 day fast so we know that no matter even though you are even though it was a fast unto the Lord you know there's you know Jesus had to be weak in his body you know and and when you're a weak in your body like that you do become weak in your mind and we understand yo of course we understand we all we know Jesus was God in flesh we understand that but we also know that he was a man and he suffered as a man he hungered as a man he was tempted as a man the Bible said he was tempted in all points like as we are so I I have to believe that Jesus in this condition have become weak in body and perhaps weakened mind but when he returned from this temptation the Bible says that he had returned in the power of the spirit amen so why because because Jesus knew Jesus knew who his father was amen the Temptation had nothing to do with his sonship and I I I want you to to let this sink into your hearts amen no matter what you go through it has nothing to do with who you are and the temptation of Jesus had nothing to do with his sonship as a matter of fact it only proved his sonship amen so the Bible says that Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee amen because you know the reason he returned was because he returned in power was because he knew who his father was and I want to say that there is nothing that the devil can do amen that would change who Jesus was oh Jesus is are you with me but you know not only does that apply to Jesus but it also applies to every one of you if you can accept it come on Church don't let the devil lie to you we have been taught by the word Who We Are and because we know who we are there's nothing the devil can do to shake us from that no temptation no trial no sickness not even though backsliding no mistakes you can make well change who you really are amen so Jesus came back amen after his his temptation and the Bible says the open he would turn back into spirit and as you went he went into the sin into the synagogue now remember this is this is where Jesus grew up he went back to the same place where he grew up and as his custom was he when the Bible says he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day now you remember when Jesus was here there was not yet a resurrection and the Jews worship on the Sabbath so he went according as the custom was on the Sabbath day amen but we gather on the first day of the week because now we are after Jesus had come the resurrection to take place and listen the resurrection took place on the first day of the week remember Jesus went on the seventh day the last day but we go on the first day which is back to the age day which speaks of Eternity are you with me so so so Jesus went as their custom was but let me just say that today their custom of going on the Sabbath day is not our custom today because Jesus has Resurrected amen but when Jesus was here in this scripture he was not yet resurrected so he went to church on Saturday is that right so so he goes into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and the Bible said he stood up to read and and that was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and Jesus is standing there now and and and and the Bible says when he had opened the book now aren't you glad that he opened the book Amen to us and that but when he had opened the book The Bible says he found the place where it was written no no I I I want you to notice amen that Jesus could find this specific scripture because he knew who his father was and he knew that this scripture was speaking of him so he could take the book open up the book and look at the scripture that was directly referring to himself and then he read the scripture the spirit of the Lord is upon me oh come on Church you think about what a power this was for the Lord himself to stand there in human flesh and pick up the word the scroll and say the spirit of the Lord is upon me amen now what about us we ought to be able to pick up the word and point to certain scriptures and say the spirit of the Lord is upon us the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel hell my he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach delivers to the captives recurring your side to the Blind and instead of Liberty them that are bruised Amen to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he said and he gave it again to the minister and sat down now and then the Bible says that the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears now you stop and think about that here because Jesus had been prophesied to come for years right the Messiah but now the Messiah is here and he picks up the scripture that is speaking of him and he says this day this is fulfilled in other words no more are you looking for the Messiah to come no more are you looking for this to happen Jesus stands up and he says this has happened Hallelujah and there comes a time for you and I that most of us we are looking back at at prophecies already fulfilled do you realize that a lot of the prophecies prophecies for the end time have already happened and we are looking back at them or we're looking at depression and there's still some of course that are the future and remember many of them were looking back and we can say this day amen this scripture is fulfilled there's a bride on the Earth that's ready for a rapture amen amen I wonder I wonder if I would can I get a little more volume is is that possible or is that the only reason my we we preached a little longer and anticipated the preach last night and and the devil's always fighting my throat so if it doesn't blast your ears too much the more volume I have the better and if it gets too loud you just turn me down a little bit okay all right amen I want the devil to hear me Hallelujah he knows who we are he knows who you are but I want him to hear amen not only here but I want him to see a life in me amen amen so Jesus stands there and he says this name this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now uh you that are are familiar with the message of the hour uh you are well aware that this scripture and this and this happening right here in Luke chapter 4 has repeated again in this day how many members I believe it was the message birth pains Amen brother Brandon is is looking for his scripture and uh his wife had just given him a new Bible and you know what is the the pages stick together sometimes and so so he's looking for the scripture and he can't find the scripture and he he turns to the scripture he goes and and he and he starts reading and he says no he says that that doesn't sound right and then he tries again and no it doesn't sound so he turns to brother Jack Moore and he says brother jack isn't that so-and-sodian he says yes brother random he says yeah I saw it so he goes back and he turns to the Bible again he says and I always kind of chuckle but he goes yeah he says there it is all right here we are and he starts reading again he says no brother Jack that's that's not right now you know you have to remember we are looking back at that and we understand it but he didn't understand what was happening all he knew is he wasn't finding the scripture and and he came he came to the conclusion that there was a pace missing in the Bible Hallelujah but God was fulfilling his word amen and there was a Catholic priest sitting on the on on the platform I believe it was Bishop Stanley if I'm not if I'm correct and and he walks up with the book hey he has the two brother Branham and he says Be steady my son God is fixing to move he will show you wonderful things yes sir a Catholic priest what did he know about it probably nothing but he somehow something was Quicken to him so he gives the he gives the Bible the brother Branham he reads the Bible and he handed the book back to the priest now brother Bradham still didn't know what what had just happened and this is what I love about the message of the hour because brother Branham had to find his way through life and through prophecy many things you didn't know but God would lead him so after church was over as it is many times if you have children they were crying for a hamburger they were hungry you know and so he pulls oh he stops at a place to get them something to eat and as he's as he pulls over excuse me the Lord calls him over behind a car and reminds him of the scripture what was the god fulfilling his word without brother Branham even knew knowing what was happening right so then he goes back to Jeffersonville and then he preaches this day hallelujah oh what was he declaring he was making a declaration that the same Jesus that was here two thousand years ago is here right now amen fulfilling his word amen and he stood up and he read the scripture he said this name this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and I just might want to say to you if you haven't heard that tape for a while or or or or that series of take of messages you ought to go back and listen to it again it was a powerful powerful this day this scripture is fulfilled and my my my wife's grandmother was into in those services and she said it was such a power she said we literally would have done anything he said if he would have said get down on the floor and roll down the aisle we would have done it without even question power amen power knowing who you are knowing where you are knowing you are in the scripture maybe so it was not just brother Branham standing up and saying things Jesus amen the Messiah was on the scene this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Jesus identified himself in the scripture and this message is identified in the scripture the same Messiah that was here 2 000 years ago the same Messiah is here today he showed himself through that gift of of the Prophet thank you I'm just going to take my time I just refuse to be nervous [Applause] I always feel like I gotta hurry Russian then you stumble over words and don't say things right you know we have we have all day and you know I don't know where you all live but I'm probably driving further than any of you after service amen but that's all right that's all right amen let's let's let God have his way amen Hallelujah so Jesus identified himself into scripture and the only way you can identify yourself and overcome the only way you could overcome is you overcome temptation overcome trials is to know who you are and when you know who you are you don't give up after every mistake you make come on Church the Devil beats many of you over the head oh you made a mistake you did something wrong therefore you're not a son of God no I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God amen when you know who you are you don't just give up and when you know who you are you don't have to call the pastor every time you make a mistake you know who you are you don't need to pass you to confirm Who You Are because you know what the pastor could say oh you are a son of God but you may not be I want God to confirm me God to say you're a son of God Hallelujah then when you stumble when you make a mistake and you will come on you'll make mistakes but you still know who you are it doesn't change the seed on the inside Hallelujah oh hallelujah amen I I'm gonna get into something I hope you you you'll understand where I'm going and I'm well worried about Jack would probably listen to the service to see if I preach something Falls so you stay with your pastor but I just want to say this that fleshly manifestations don't give you overcoming power are we are you with me so far amen fleshly manifestations don't give you power overcoming power right now the Bible tells us uh Jesus speaking he said blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen so Satan cannot move you from that Revelation you are built on the Rock and Satan cannot move you amen but if your faith now listen to me if your faith is in how you feel you can be moved from that feelings will lie to you every time amen feelings don't have holding power because feelings are not lasting oh come on Church amen feelings don't last amen we could talk about anything in life anything that gives you a feeling it doesn't last that's why people that have to drink and take drugs and all these things it doesn't last that's what I have to keep taking them to have the same feeling because they're living that feeling but when God gives you the drug off the lily of the valley you don't have to keep coming back and get the same drug hallelujah amen because it lasts amen and you're not depending on that feeling you're depending on what God said you are oh Hallelujah hey man I'm gonna read something here out of the message the unchangeable word of God in 1960 brother Branham said now look he says a while ago when the Holy Spirit was falling he said that was the blessings of the Lord he said now he says this that you see operating this way is the power of the Lord he's talking about the discernment right he says he said that's the blessings now he says don't get blessings and power mixed up I hope you hear what he said don't get blessing and power mixed up you can have a blessing and not power enough to cure a toothache but power of the Lord is to manifest God and you know to manifest God is more than just an expression or an emotion or whatever right you know uh another place here 1958 he says I I just wish I had some vocabulary to explain this he's he's into no just so you know he's in the line of discernment now yo and the angel has come if you hear the tapes well nobody hears tapes anymore I guess but you know when you hear the service you know you can tell by when you're listening you can tell when that angel comes in and when that angel came in there was no doubt in brother Brandon's mind what was happening he had complete control so he says I can't explain it there's nothing can do it he says every person in here is under my control now if you're not familiar with the message you know that that might stumble you but he's not talking about necessarily under his control but under the control of the holy spirit that is in him right amen every person in here is under my control that's right now he said this is a very strange statement he could die he says the holy spirit is here the anointing it doesn't make me jump up and scream that's the blessings of the Lord now listen I believe in jumping up and screaming whatever whatever the spirit moves you do so don't go home and say well brother Bill you know yeah man so but but that's the blessings of the Lord amen we should rejoice amen but but he he says when the anointing he says the anointing is here the holy spirit is here and he said it doesn't make me jump up and scream it was a power all right and then he goes on he says a lot of times your Pentecostal people gets fooled by that he said Jesus had the greatest anointing of any man and he read a scripture just as I have read now and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and what did he do he read the scripture he never run over the place he sat down in Precious words proceeded from his mouth now if I read the scripture and I'll go back here and I sit down and start preaching to you you're gonna say oh boy he is so boring foreign we misunderstand what power is you know and we all believe in the in we all believe in in the emotion all I'm trying to say today is don't trust the emotion Hallelujah Amy had the greatest anointing that ever was because the scripture said it and it goes on down you know and so on so because he said he had power to heal the sick and all this but that was the greatest anointing when Jesus Took the word he stood up read the scripture close the book gave it back to the man and went and sat down and gracious words proceeded out of his mouth and they all wondered what school what about the greatest word right they were amazed and brother Brandon said that was the greatest power that a man ever had the greatest anointing he said in one place the greatest anointing was when Jesus did that hallelujah oh my right because it was it was power because he was the one reading what applied to himself that's right amen he was reading what applied to himself he made the word that was spoken he made that word live because he knew he was that one oh I tell you when you know who you are the devil can do nothing he can't do nothing with you that right he knew he knew he was the one now let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians chapter one just for a minute I want to read something that applies to us that was Jesus but what about you amen we are included amen uh Ephesians 1 3 the Bible said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we let's say we we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now I don't care how you feel this morning we may not feel holy we may not feel without blame but the Bible says we are that's why we can't trust in feeling you might have come to church today not feeling like a Christian I don't know but it has nothing to do with what the Bible says we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love Hallelujah so I'm going to take what the Bible says and not what I think are not what I feel amen having predestined us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will there's power knowing who you are amen Ephesians 5 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word notice it didn't say bye the feeling washing up Water by the sensation by the word that he might present it to himself in glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish said it twice in the book of Ephesians that we should be holy and without blemish now let me say if you have come God's provide a way you can believe that this applies to you this applies to you First Corinthians 15 51. behold I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed that's a promise we the Believers shall all be changed Hallelujah this is you right now let me just say this a good feeling will never give you that assurance amen a good feeling will never give you that Assurance you could have a good feeling and be lost all right right you can have a good feeling and be lost but you can have a bad feeling and be saved Hallelujah oh you got a good feeling and be lost but you could have a bad feeling and be saved Hallelujah amen you believe that amen we don't trust I don't trust my feelings if I trust my my feelings I would be very discouraged sometimes I'll just be honest be very discouraged but I don't trust my feelings because they will lie to me every time your feelings will disappoint you every time now I'm gonna make a little turn here and go to Hebrews 6. Hallelujah everybody doing all right Hallelujah amen Hebrews 6 verse 4 it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted up the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again into repentance seeing They Crucified them to themselves the Son of God are fresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which strength in the rain that comes off the Bonnet and bring us forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receive his blessing from God watch the next verse but that which Bears thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh under cursing whose end is to be burnt so there there there is a a seed there is a seed that receives blessing but the end of that seed is burnt are you with me amen why the rain that is sent to form the wheat also grows the weeds and the thistles and the thorns and whatever it is right the same rain now and we're just going to slow down a little bit and let that rain soak in okay and in the same rain that Waters the wheat Waters the weeds also and even though both of them will receive blessings of the rain and they do everything that's out of the field will receive blessing from the rain right amen the end in their end of the weeds and Thorns amen they are burnt even though they rejoiced even though they received the blessing let me just say once God opens your eyes to this it will clear out a lot of questions for you it will answer the question that you have about you know well so and so you're prophesied and so as though it hit Miracles but they weren't living right when you understand this you won't question anymore you will wonder how how they did it because listen the church world gets results there's many people out there pray for the sick they see miracles right they get results they're they are receiving blessing from the rain they're anointed with the true Holy Spirit come on Amen it's not a different rain that falls under wheat and weeds it's the same rain and the same Holy Spirit can fall in the meeting today and there could be a wheat and there could be a weed but it's the same spirit that will fall down and both of them can react to it is that right amen amen oh I tell you when when God opens your eyes today as you'll understand why you can't trust emotion as your evidence amen you have to know you have to know that you are of the right seed because the seed is what makes the difference not you as a person you're just a person like anybody else but the seed makes the difference when Jesus was here he had a he had a very hard time with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and he was trying to get them to see who he was because but remember they they also had claim to Abraham as their father and they let him know that Abraham was their father everybody told them you know you know you you claim Abraham to be your father but you seek to kill me Abraham didn't do that so there were the natural seed right he says I know you're Abraham's seed but uh but you seek to kill me because now watch this you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you wow my word has no place in you that's why you try to kill me you know I I just have to just speak as it comes but but listen let me just say I I wonder sometimes when when you know when people preach and they kill one another over the pulpit there's something wrong there's something wrong with that is it because the word has no place in them I don't know I'm not the judge you you understand because Jesus could know and he said my word had no place in you that's why you're trying to kill me and if we're trying to kill one another's influence as a wrong spirit Hallelujah yeah we might not kill one another physically but we kill your influence amen amen it's a dangerous thing amen I speak that which I have seen with my father that's why I said the seed is what makes the difference I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father okay okay hey and people don't believe in serpent seed don't believe in the seed lines Jesus believed it and he let them know he told the right straight to their face you're at the same seed line I am because you're seeking to please your father and I'm pleasing my father amen so Jesus and the religious people had different fathers amen now I know we're talking to two thousand years ago but let's let's bring it in your mind up to today amen so Amen brother Brandon said both prayed he's talking about Hebrews 6 both prayed both received help from God for he makers his son and Reign to fall on both Good and Evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations listen to me at both at the same wonderful manifestations there was still one great difference they were of different seed Hallelujah they were a different seed even though they received the same rain the same Sun amen so this scripture is speaking clearly of different sea lines right so true power comes in knowing who you are knowing what seed is in you amen that's how Jesus could return in the power of the spirit at this great Temptation he knew he was the word and the word always defeats the devil in the true seed the true seed the word and the true seed always defeats the devil is that right amen but so many times we substitute true power for the blessings of God as I said we enjoy the blessings we want the blessings amen but what we're reading is the power of God power to overcome Satan's temptation because you could have listen you can have the blessings and you can still lie you've been at the blessings and you can still cheat you can have the blessings and you can still run around on your wife come on Church the blessings are not the power that holds you amen Hallelujah now I just want to I want to go back if you are familiar with brother Brown's first experience with the Pentecostal people because remember he was raised a Baptist he was ordained in the Baptist Church so he was very very fundamental to him it had to be the word Yo God listen God does everything was purpose he brought him up through that organization why to get the foundation of that it has to be the word or it's wrong right but there was a lot more to it than what the Baptist organization was teaching him and when they want to ordain women preachers he said no no now isn't it isn't it something that because of his Baptist background it had to be the word or nothing but yet there ordaining women preachers and he says no he says if you're going to do that he said just take my name off the book right God was training him and moving him and bringing him into a into certain conditions in certain situations because there was a message that had to be brought for you and I and that message had to be balanced able to make a perfect bride we couldn't go too far to the left and too far to the right amen we have people that if there's any emotion at all oh you are Pentecostal and then you go away the other side but let's go down the middle of the road hallelujah amen just because I get emotional don't make me a Pentecostal other than if I have the Holy Spirit it will make me a true Pentecostal not 1906 Pentecostal but he a day of Pentecost Pentecostal and then that one I believe in but I don't want to go back to 1906. we're not going backward we're going forward Hallelujah the grain the grain always goes forward amen if you know anything about farming you know that when the grain comes up into husk forms around it amen the life that's in that grain it never goes back down in the in the leaves to stalk or whatever when it comes in that husk forms around it there's only one other step left it goes to the Garner amen the grain go what it's taken home it has come to maturity so we are not going back to 1906 Pentecost I want the real Pentecost and we believe in the real Pentecost so here is the prophet of God still not knowing these things but he knows that he's called for something right he knows that he's sent but he has a lot of misunderstandings and God has to teach him right so one day he's coming back from Mishawaka Indiana from a fishing trip and he's coming down the road and he sees cars sitting everywhere license plates you know stickers or whatever Jesus only Jesus name and you're all these things and he said oh my you know what is this and so so he stops he stops to see what it was now remember you have to remember he was raised very poor they had no money hardly right hardly enough to eat and he says I I went to the meeting and I saw what was happening and and you know and everybody they made him you know they made meal everybody ate there and he said of course I was welcome to eat with them he said but I wouldn't do it this might go on a different subject but but it'll be a good lesson for you he says I wouldn't eat with them because are you awake I had nothing to put in the offering some people just come to church for something to eat I'm sorry he said I wouldn't eat with them because I could I had nothing to put in the offering he said all I had was some some old you know some old dried biscuits or whatever and he said I slept in the car I ate in a car and he says I pressed my trousers in the car between the back and the seat I'm sure they were still wrinkled you can't press trousers it's not going to make it nice you know and he dressed in a t-shirt because remember he was coming from a fishing trip so he didn't have a suit probably the right cut he had a t-shirt but he wanted to know what those people had there was something burning in him so he goes in the meeting you know and and you know they had you know uh uh and they had all all the I've I believe this was the same meeting maybe I'm getting a meeting mixed up I I believe this was the same time they had all the ministers come by on the one service and just you know give the name where they're from he gets up William random Jeffersonville Indiana sit down so I know a night or two later whatever it was they they they called on him to bring your message and uh the old man the old brother I forget his name was up there and he says does anybody know what a whereabouts of William Branham he said I just started scooting down and you call it two or three times anybody know what William Branham is anybody know where abouts of him and you know finally the man sitting next to him looked over and says do you know where he is he says come here yo you see I'm he he says but I can't go up there no you know the trousers and the t-shirt and he's going up there those people don't care how you dress he said yo because his old Baptist ways all right wouldn't allow him to do that and the brother on the platformer says anybody knows whereabouts of William Brandon yo burger here he is here he is oh when God's seeking you out you cannot hide amen and that's where he got his start he preached the message got in the spirit and didn't even know what happened right and he got out and all these people standing there you know come over to my church come over here come here dude you know all these invitations oh he was so excited he goes home he tells his wife oh I met the cream of the crop I met the best thing you have ever seen look at all these invitations yo we'll go and preach for them and uh oh his father-in-law got a hold of it says you're not going to drag my wife over to that bunch of trash oh my and but you see his wife would have went with him she said bill I'll go with you no matter what my parents say but he says no it's you know he and he compromised he didn't go and you remember when the when the flood came the 1937 flood and he was stranded and stuck on an island out in the middle of a river about to die and God said you know what about that group of people you call trash can you imagine how the man that would not compromise no matter what happened and that's why he he put him through such severe trials even taking his wife and his baby teaching him a lesson that you must obey me because there was a message coming for you and then God was thinking of you in West Palm Beach and he says there's got to be a man that will not compromise that will preach the unadulterated word of God so that I can have a bride out of this part of the world for the Rapture and because of that brother Brad who had to go through all that suffering and trials so he would stay true you really think about how easy you have it first many times at home and says you know he had to go out in the woods and pray for days and sometimes weeks and whatever to get you know find out what the Lord wanted him to do find the word from the Lord you have it on your phone you don't have to go to the woods and pray to see what the Lord said now you might do that for a special occasion or something or you know but I just generally speaking you can you can get your phone out and push play or you can tell Siri to play it or Alexa whatever you know I wonder what I I've never done it maybe someone you have I wonder what Alexa would do if you say Alexa play William Branham she might say William Branham is a cult probably not but I'd have to say have you ever noticed when you're when you're when you're when you're texting and or you're typing something you got auto chat and your auto spell all that have you ever noticed that Siri is not a Christian Siri doesn't understand words and you know a phrase is that she knows nothing about when you start typing in by you know Holy Ghost Holy Spirit for the most part she can't spell it out until you finish it but if you put in a cuss words you'll get it quick [Music] and you better read it before you sent it I'm sure most of us have sent some terrible texts I'm going to tell on myself I won't tell what it was but I'm going to tell them myself I have one of these emojis that I didn't know what it meant and I was talking to brother Danny and we're talking about the taxes in the church and this that and the other and so I I sent this thing that you know had all these had this face and all this you know uh like oh yeah the sign of you know you know what I'm going dividing multiplication percentage all this stuff yo I development we're talking about money I just said [Music] but brother Danny text me back right away he says don't you send that to anybody else you know what that means I said no I don't know it says you don't know you don't want to know what that means don't you he said don't send that to all your message all your preacher friends you'll never preach anywhere else again so be careful amen when you speak your text you better go pack and read it because they don't always understand what you're saying and they will interpret what they think you're saying I texted a customer mine here not long ago about a job and trying to schedule it and and she texted me back I've known this lady for years uh a Jewish lady a very nice lady just you know almost like family and and so I I got this text back and I looked at the text and I said oh my goodness I know she didn't read this it was horrible and she texted back about it oh man I'm so embarrassed it happens I understand Siri amen she's not Siri don't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah amen where was I I'm sorry amen so brother Branham had to go through these things and so as he's in this meeting you know the spirit is falling now you have to remember this is this was in his early early Ministry and there's a move of the spirit still in the in the end from the outpouring of 1906. right and and that was the restoring of the gifts that your uh tongues prophecy you know all these things was restored back to the church right and so so does the spirit is falling in the meeting and one brother speaks in tongues another brother interprets and brother Brandon was just thrilled he thought oh my you know he said I I thought I'd come amongst angels right he never he had never seen such a thing and so he thought well yo with with the gift I have he said I would like to just talk to these people these brothers you know I just find out you know he had a little way of talking to you and knowing who you are or what you are so he talked to the one brother and and he says a real genuine believer and so he he he uh was able to meet the next brother and he said if I ever met a hypocrite that was one of them now think about it so here he is he does he knows nothing about this yet but he but the spirit is falling they're both anointed and they were telling the truth he said there's many here to need to be at the altar I would call out certain things and the person would stand up and witness that's right so they were not they were not prophesying falsely they were actually telling something true but one was still a devil oh my amen he was one was a plot let me let me back up a little bit here I am again trying to hurry if I ever met a hypocrite that was one of them that man was actually his wife was a blind-headed woman he had children by two hey two children by a black-headed woman I thought well now what here it is I'm all mixed up I'm a fundamentalist it must be the word or it isn't right amen and there's a spirit that rang out according to all I know genuine the other one was not good at all the spirit falling on both and now it's just how can that be it had me puzzled we should have the same attitude right so now so he goes back home and and now he's all all confused he was so thrilled about what he found is oh this is the best thing ever and now he's wondering he's amongst devils and he said I want nothing to do with devils right so he goes back home and as his nature was he had to find out aren't you glad it's like shooting the gun it's got to hit the target if it's off just a little bit I'm not satisfied even the even the weather begun company told him about a certain gun said she says Mr Branham that gun will not you know do such and such he says I know better because I've done it before that's the way he was with the word I know it would hit the target it would see what in right so that was his nature so he goes home and he goes out in the woods he goes in the cave and so he's in the cave for how many days it was and finally one day he walked out of the caves like a kind of you know get some fresh airs all you know musty in there and dark and damp you know and and uh listen he he did these things because he wanted to know what the word was you ought to thank God that he was that way or you wouldn't have what you have amen and so he walks out there and God shows him a vision he saw the Earth all you know uh turning out in front of him all dished up and saw a man dressed in white going around he's scattering seeds sowing the weed and after you went around the curvature of the earth there was another man come you know it looked horrible dressed in black it was throwing weed seats all over and both come up together you all remember the story he come up together and when they did he said they both became thirsty because there was no rain everything was dry and so they were in need of rain and both of them listen both of them started crying out we need rain we need rain what are the church denominations doing today do you realize that right now there are still many Pentecostal people are calling for the spirit of Elijah they want the spirit of Elijah in their Church why they're hungering that's the day we live in right when the foolish Virgin Goes to get the oil they never got it but because while they were looking for it the bridegroom came and those that had oil in their land went in to the marriage supper is that right so they both are crying out and the rain comes and the weed stands up and rejoices praise the Lord praise the Lord and we stand up next to the praise the Lord praise the Lord you know some of you might even know people like that that you wonder why they're praising the Lord because you know their life but you know we we leave it alone because God knows and God will separated when the time comes amen we just let the Spirit Fall as it wants to fall because I can benefit from it no matter what the next person does I mean so they both rejoiced the same Reigns same Sun and both of them had results but Branham said everybody can rejoice in it Hypocrites Christians all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known by their fruits they are known as that's the only way we can ever know amen let's give over somebody goes over over some of that the the same things and how God has showed him that Vision but he comes on down he and he says again that that that the seed is what makes the difference amen hallelujah amen people have prophesied and prophesied true because they were in a certain office like cafes right so you can prophesy true and be a false vessel amen that's true but I want to be a true vessel don't you amen hallelujah so Jesus knew who he was the power of knowing who he was is what kept Him and caused him to fulfill what he was called for now one more thing and I'm going to bring it to a close in just a little bit The Prodigal Son we've heard the story many times him and his brother and whatever family there was the father was rich one day the one son decided you know I don't want to wait for my inheritance I want it now and the father you know being a good father no doubt the father gave it to him he divided it between the brothers and gave The Prodigal gave his portion to him and after he got the inheritance got all those things he went out he left his father's house went out into the world lived his own life and the Bible said he he wasted his substance was riotous living all kinds of immoral things and horrible things he got into listen let me tell you something young people the devil will take you further than you want to go you give him just a little bit he will take more than you'll ever get he'll take you further what's that song sin will take you further something like that I believe it goes sin will take you further than you want to go you think I want to have a little pleasure I want to have a little fun this is the best fun I could ever have right here amen amen maybe not always fun for the flesh but there's a rejoicing in the spirit Hallelujah this is our pleasure this is our fun you know fun is such a cheap word right I mean for lack of a better word what's that this is a whole fun this is our joy this is our pleasure but the prodigal thought he could go out and you know wanted to experience the world listen I'm not young anymore I denied it for a long time but I I've kind of went beyond the point of no return so you know uh but I was young ones believe it or not I was as young as you are right now at one time I didn't come in I didn't come into this world fully grown right so I was young I know what it's like to be young I know what it's like to grow up I know what it's like to have friends that want to pull you you know the wrong ways and I also know that that as long as you have your world in nature you will always go with your friends it's a pull it's just natural you're all born in sin right so you naturally want to go that way you want to experience those things but I also would like to add to that but now listen I was young I experienced certain things but I'll tell you it's not what you think it is the devil will never tell you the real picture oh come on he'll paint something beautiful oh it looks so nice and all this yo look at all the Hollywood movie stars and all these things if you knew their life behind the scenes you would run from them as fast as you could let me just try look how many of them are committing suicide why they're not happy they got millions they got whatever but they're not happy amen and you know I'm miserable and how ugly that life is you and if you could see those evil spirits you wouldn't even want what they got but the devil hides it from you and oh they're so happy we got the uh what are they called uh um influencers you know instagramers and influencers and tick tockers and whatever they all are and all those things and you see all those things oh they're so happy it doesn't know life is good and they're miserable as they can be but you follow them and like them and all in that wonderful oh I want to be like that I want to jump off a cliff into a river don't you realize the devil has one purpose kill you destroy you before you could have have opportunity to accept Christ that's his goal and all these things are working into his hands oh yeah the wisdom of Cain I guarantee you Seth didn't invent Instagram or any or any such thing and if you want to be influenced let's be influenced by the Holy Spirit hey man I'm looking right now at some influencers and you look more I don't even look normal I wanna I see somebody I'm sorry I just feel free but I see some of these things and I want to say what sister what was her name uh Forney Vanessa Vanessa Vanessa whatever whatever her name is you know the jewel preached at our place one time years ago and you know and tell him about himself and he's you know standing before the mirror and flexing and doing this and yo she comes out you don't think you look good do you I tell you when I see some of these creatures out here on the on the street I wanna I wanna look at them and say you don't think you look good do you know what's what's the matter with your pants they're all ripped back home we warm did it looked like that and threw them away or mom put a patch over and we kept wearing it if I'd have known that I would have kept some of those I could have sold more a lot of money now Hallelujah the world is insane they pay hundreds of dollars for that nonsense for ripped jeans I don't understand it but it happened to the world amen it's a prodigal and listen don't don't follow that way because the Prodigal Son yo maybe he thought well I I want to experience so many things but I'm only going to go so far I've done that many of you probably done that I'm only going to do this and I'm not going to go any further the next thing you knew you were going further because there's nothing to hold you because I didn't know who I was [Applause] but once I knew who I was the devil has no more power over me and over you because you know who you are amen so The Prodigal Son kept going down down down until he listen listen where you ended up at he ended up in the pig pen foreign come on church that's where you'll end up if you leave the word if you leave Father's House you'll end up in a pig pen and the Bible says he would have been happy to eat the husks from the corn but nobody gave him that's a terrible condition how many of you know what a pig pen smells like just a few it's bad it's bad and that's where he was in the stink of a pig pen but that didn't change his position of who he was his daddy was still the same Daddy Hallelujah he was still his son and one day the Bible said he came to himself oh I hope some of you come to yourself he came to himself and he remembered oh I remember who I am I remember my daddy I remember the farm I remember where I came from oh church this morning I remember where I came from too Hallelujah I came from the mind of God and I'm going back to the mind of God Hallelujah he said oh I remember who I am I will I will go back listen that's what you have to do if you are a prodigal this morning you have to come come to yourself and tell yourself I'm going back but he realized what he'd done it and he says now and you know this is this is what Satan puts on you once you do something wrong you fall you sin you do whatever he puts a guilt trip on you so heavy to try to keep you from rising up sort of the prodigal raised up and he says I'm going back to my father's house I'm not worthy to be a son that's what he thought that's what the devil told him I'm not worthy to be a son but I'll go back and be his servant right but he was not a servant you are not a servant you are not Israel spiritually we are Israel yeah but you are Gentile and the Gentile is not a servant they're Sons Hallelujah so he goes he raises up he starts back there's a good lesson here he goes back and as he's going back now the the daddy no doubt had applied to token yes sir and no doubt he was watching for him all the time believing that one day my son is coming back right right so as the sun is is approaching to farm of course his daddy sees him oh and you're like a real father listen I don't care what your children have done they could do whatever they're still your child and as he looked out he saw his son and he ran out to meet him now think about it he came from the pig pen probably smelled like a pig looked like a pig but the daddy ran up and no not gave him a hug he didn't care what his son smelled like and God doesn't care what you smell like just come to him Hallelujah [Applause] so he embraced him but now there's another problem he had a brother that got jealous [Music] so he sees what's happening because you know the father oh this my son came home you'll kill the best calf the fat of calf make a piece he's come back and his son is looking he sees all this he says if he goes out he says Dad what's going on here you've never done such for me a jealous Spirit right you've never done such for me you never made a face you never killed if had a calf you've never done any of that stuff you're and and my brother comes home which has wasted your substance wasted your living and live with harlots drinking whatever and now you make you kill a fan of cat for him I can see him going over to your dad he said Son you must understand something you are in my house you've always been in my house you were a good tithe prayer you always came to church right you never disbelieve the message you always did what was right faithful in church you're always my son all that I have is yours he says but your brother was dead and he's alive Hallelujah that's why we made the federal Cav that's why we made the feast because he was dead in sin and trespass but he's alive now now look he was alive but he still looked the same he still looked like a pig I'm talking about when he first came smelled like a pig but as far as the daddy was concerned he was alive because it was still his son Hallelujah the pig pen couldn't change it his sonship [Applause] glory to God let me say laodicea cannot change your sonship it cannot change your citizenship Hallelujah [Music] the devil has nothing he can move you with no matter how low down you become no matter how sinful you come you are always the son or daughter and the prodigal was always still the same sun he had just Fallen Hallelujah he was dead but now he's alive take him and clean him up wash him put the best robe on him [Music] amen and God brought you into his kingdom to clean him up with sanctification and put the best robe the Holy Spirit on him [Music] Hallelujah like when they came to the weddings in the East they they washed their feet and gave him a robe and everything so they all looked the same there was no poor no Rich no this that they all look the same when you're born again of the spirit of God Amen you come to be a believer receive the Holy Ghost we all look the same there's no little eye big you and poor you know I I'm poor you're rich in the kingdom of God we're all equal Hallelujah amen let's come to ourselves if you're selfish I will go to the father's house listen even though he he was in
