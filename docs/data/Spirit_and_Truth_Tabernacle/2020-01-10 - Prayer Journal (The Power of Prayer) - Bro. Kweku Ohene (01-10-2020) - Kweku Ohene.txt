through he's still worthy of our praise - gah [Music] a man a man a man a men it can be seated in the presence of the Lord a man just happy to come to the house of Lord tonight there just looking at the scripture and David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and sometimes we go through moments in life where it's just it's a certain excitement about going to God's house and you go with an expectation that he's gonna meet you there it's a man and he told us wherever two or three gathered in my name there my name is man so I came I came with an expectation tonight hey man I'm just I just just just just love the Lord I I was so grateful for him visiting us on Sunday amen but I know there's more where that came from man glory to God so anytime we get together we ought to expect him just to move amen and I miss praise the Lord I know that tonight there was at least one person shared with me that they had a testimony that they wanted to share and I want to make room for that but also wanted to give space for any others that might have something that they want to share tonight you know this is testimony something Lord has done for you a man but if you want to share just let us know in if it will make a room for you tonight a man but it's time I've had Brotherhood sway come he's gonna come in and share and it will lead us often anybody else that want to come a man come on a man you can god bless you all I really got bless you all I appreciate all you guys I'm excited to be here I'm always excited to come to church it's always a battle so every time I get here it's like I already won just just to even walk through this door I already won the Lord is fighting he is truly fine I actually want to read a scripture because this scripture kind of backs up my testimony so I think if you have a testimony that's backed up by Scripture is a testimony you know so it's a second Corinthians 6:10 says as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things and then another one that you guys probably never heard this Romans 8:28 and it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose that we ought to remember that his purpose you know a lot of times we want to according to our prayers so those those scriptures I wanted to read it because I wanted to say exactly but I know those and I used those on a daily basis for me and something happened the other day and out of many other things to happen and I'm pretty sure it's the same situation with all of you guys because we have daily hourly testimonies but this one like kind of stuck out and it was kind of like burning inside to say so I was coke brother Jack I said there's a testimony that's just been burning for me saying it so I wanted to share theirs all God cares for us and he truly when when you have something as small as as as that thing could be if it's something that means something to you then he actually will give it to you if it's according to his purpose so as long as you your your with the word if you can even if it's something naturally I believe that God will like just like our kids you know like our kids they there's certain things that might not be like exactly like me like you really need it but we love them and we'll kind of like sneak you know behind my wife kind a little bit and kind of like you know so God does the same thing to us and and and I he proves that to me so much so I am personally in my vehicle I I love my vehicle my vehicles just smells really well I like to keep it smelling brand new and people tell me they did so good and I in sometimes it's dirty on the outside but I always keep the inside key it's just something that makes me feel better and so I do that and um my other truck the previous truck one time I had got in the morning with a cup of coffee and something happened I spill the coffee all over me all over the car I literally this montón that whole car took the dash out of the seats the center console to clean that vehicle because I was not driving with the vehicle to smell like coffee so it's something small but there's something within this testimony that shows God and that's all I'm trying to do you know is for you guys to see that he cares for us you know so when I bought my new truck I actually out of all the things that were going on when I was buying that vehicle I this this little thing that I say God I said lord please don't ever let her cup of coffee spilling this one I I literally asked God that that this why this testimony is big to me because I remember that little thought as I was buying the truck I said do not please don't take coffee it's spelling here you know so so basically I when I leave my house I am really strong he grabs my kids and my wife I'm really strong about being prayed up we need to be prayed up so I I'm gonna say that I pray every single second sometimes the devil really fights you but I make the point of always praying in the morning and particularly with that when I get in my vehicle before I leave my house I always pray and sometimes the double wants to give you like this this starlight you keep praying like protect me protect me give me a make sure this is happy every single the God already heard the devil like literally puts these stars in your hand so I make a point of praying a couple of days before that as soon as you leave in the house I'm thinking where I'm going I'm calling this customer I'm gonna do this so the devil wants to make you really busy because he knows that I make a point it means something to me for me to pray before I leave this said protection that I like to carry so I've been leaving the house I hit the corner I'm driving down the road getting pray I stopped right there in the middle of the road and I pray and I just closed my eyes and like really pray now you know sometimes we say well I'm driving and I'm praying and no no no I want it stopped and I wanna I want God to really look at me and look at my situation I must stop everything and I'm going to pray so I've been did that a couple of times and I stopped in the middle of the road this particular day which I believe was yesterday of the day before I got in the vehicle I have my cup of coffee and I have it on the top like this and I'm thinking of all the things that I'm where I'm going and all that and I'm I'm pulling out I'm gonna cross the gay and I say not today I'm praying before I I I slam on the brakes and when I slam on the brakes the cup of coffee like that I just brewed when everywhere like on me like all over my clothes like I had to I put it in park I jump out of the vehicle coffee it was I had to literally go inside and change socks boxers sure every like cuff coffee all over me so as soon as that happened and the way I could explain it was like the Holy Spirit really really like it's like it works it works it's the only thing I believe the Kipps keeps us in line with God because without it I would have stepped out of the car I would have been cursing I would have been like my whole day would have been ruined this like so when I step out I can actually feel something wanting to go a certain way and something directing me to say something things so I stepped out I said all those feelings were saying but I said all as well you know I said all it's well and I thought right then and there of Romans 8:28 that's the first scripture they came so I left the trunk open like that and think you know like what happened in there like I didn't want to look in there because what was gonna what I'm gonna find so I said I'm just gonna go up there I took out I have a another cover I have like a bunch of covers on the seats took all those things out whatever through when insight changed all my clothes in as I was going inside I was opening the door I started praising God I said thank you Jesus I said praise God coffee all over my truck thank Jesus praise the Lord I was I went inside and praising God I said thank you Jesus glory be to God but inside I'm literally hurting to where what I'm gonna find so change there was a quote a birth Brandon that he said if the spirit of Elijah when make John act like Elijah then the Holy Spirit should make us act like Jesus you know so I believe that that's what was happening at that at that point with me so I change I walk outside it's still dark yeah that day I was trying to leave early I wanted to get it a nice head start wanted to pull up to the place when it was just getting daylight I'm gonna have a good day today so anyways I go back to the car and I'm like here we go so I go in there and I start looking and there's no coffee on the center console I'm like okay well it came off the center console there's no coffee there there's not one drop of coffee on the seat right my I have a all weather map like a floor mat and there was coffee all over it was full but it's an all weather map so I carefully grabbed the weather mat and I pull it out and I'm looking around and I'm like alright so I grab some rags and I'm like I'm about to clean this thing up it's gonna get clean right now before I leave so I can't find one drop of coffee in that view I start putting my nose on the carpet that's me I'm lying you're gonna find I go in between the seats on the seats I'm looking around brothers and sisters not one drop of coffee touched my beautiful it was all over me it was all over the carpet it was all over they covered their I had on top of the seat but that car I was in and I'm driving so I I got in the vehicle and I'm kind of like like like not realizing exactly what's happening or what's going on you know there's not one so I said you know praise God I'm I'm gonna pray so I pray and I take off and then I'm like there's gotta be some coffee here so that it was like like there was the the flesh was like naw that that didn't happen God didn't just do like there isn't pop it's impossible for that to happen but the Bible tells us there will God oh these are possible so there was not one drop of coffee on my vehicle it did not smell like I got to buy my the first barn and I the God is working there I said walk to my car man like what is that car smell like this man it smells cleaning here I was just checking because I thought that I was smelling coffee but I was not smelly there was no coffee whatsoever in that vehicle so God hurt my little request when I bought the vehicle and I asked him I said lord please don't let me spill now in the mid one time I rather brother Troy was preaching a message in this really stuck with me he said that the chill with the faith that they went in there but he took the heat out of the fire you know in many other testimonies that I asked through the day was going that I could just like like like see how God will protect you know and we are gonna the Bible also says many are the afflictions of the righteous but he will bring you out of all so it just proves proved to me right there and it was amazing through the whole day and I walked into a couple places in and I started sharing my testimony I've shared this testimony we're like five people shared with one guy today and in in he's like how you doing man I said man I'm doing good by grass by God's grace he said hey man I said bro you just to ask me to tell you my testimony this happen so hours I started talking to him and I shared the testimony and he was like he was standing there and he was like wow like he couldn't really believe it but I believe and I wanted to thank God and I wanted to the Bible says to do good and to communicate forget now which is such things I got is well pleased in so I had to tell you guys because that was on incredible that was so within another year but he still is still incredible doing the incredible things so I just wanted to share that with you guys and let you know that God is with us when we pray ask God to just be with he is not gonna we're gonna go through a bunch of things we're gonna go through certain trials and tribulations but he's gonna be with us and I I just love the lorry and I I just wanted to give him all the praise all the glory all the honor all the things and and in the name of Jesus we just keep walking with him god bless you all the Lord certainly appreciate that testimony and always good to be reminded of how good God is to us a man everything he is concerned about so appreciate that brother oh sweet anybody else tonight wanted to share okay sis come on up come on up and man you got you coming next Sasori praise the Lord amen God is so good he did say he was supply all of our needs according to his riches and glory and my car is coming upon a hundred thousand miles and I say about ninety five thousand maybe a little bit more than that even before that my car I had a problem when I was turning 2 left 4 right the axles so I took it in to Lexus because I bought it from there and they said that they couldn't hear anything the man took it out and everything and he didn't hear anything he said well take it to Toyota because you know this is a Toyota and they would be more sensitive to the sound so I said you know what I'm gonna wait until this get real bad so I know that they won't be sending me back and I did so while I was gone doing the Thanksgiving holiday my son-in-law took it to Toyota and where he thought it was one side I knew it was two they said was the left and the right I said great so I had been praying and asking God I said Lord before this car hit 100,000 miles everything that's major that's under warranty I'm asking you to get it done for me so one Sunday morning I could have been about ninety-eight thousand by then I got up in the air there was no air I say wow okay so I took it in and they said it was something I don't know what it was and they fixed it and the air started blowing well say now I'm about ninety nine five four then the car I noticed I was driving and I had someone in the car and I kept feeling I said god there's something going on with this air here it's just not right and then I had someone else in the car and the young lady said yes you need to get that check I said yes so you driving people around so I did and I called my son-in-law he said take it there right now take it right now so I did and they said when I took it I seen I believe the first yeah I've seen a manager and he said where you gonna have to pay a hundred twenty-nine and you'll get the money back and this and that what the warranty I said no I don't have to pay anything before I said look it up so anyway when he it happened and he said okay so whenever he did look at it they have put dying it from before and they realized they said this is something going I don't know what the compress or whatever it is but now it is blowing very very cold and I'm at ninety nine five ninety nine six so I said well Lord is not a hundred thousand yet I still a I think if there's anything else I know that you're gonna do it and I give Him praise falling [Applause] praise the Lord thank God for watching over sis just the birds you have something you want to share god bless you Saints many of you've already heard this testimony but I feel like it's be robbery not to share with the whole church the sisters I shared some with the accident that I was in on the way to church over New Year's Eve night like brother Josue was saying you know praying before you leave and I remember just sitting at my drive praying not just for myself but all the driver drivers out down the road with it being New Year's Eve night you got all kind of people coming out so I'm on my way to church excited about coming for the new year you know Lord I made it I just about made it into the new year and I'm sitting there at the light at our community and military just sitting there thinking about the service glad to get here and the traffic was going north and south they had to ride away and there was a man in the left hernán lane he was headed south and he was in the left turning lane and traffic was really really moving pretty fast and he decided that he was gonna try to make a left-hand turn and you know I'm watching this play out before men I can't believe this man is trying to make the sternness of course there it caused him to be hit by at least a couple other vehicles and he hit another man too in the center and he his car started spinning start spinning and that car I'm looking at this car coming straight at me this is right and there's no nothing to cover me because I'm the first one in line there and all like the only thing that would come out of my mouth is Jesus Jesus Jesus this car coming Lord Jesus and I tell you truly there's power in the name of Jesus the car came that car hit me but it was buffeted that's the only way I could see it because the impact that it should have had it did not have that car hit me and either it bounced back or it pushed me back I'm not sure which one it is and I couldn't believe that it was such a low impact that he hit me and looking at his car his car was totaled it was on both sides both sides were just all messed up wheel was all dangling what have you and my car that was very minimal damage that was done and about the worst thing happened to me as I sat there and I froze up I just froze up and once I realized I was okay I got out of the car and made some phone calls and what-have-you but I was telling the sisters it's like the enemy tries to steal that from me because looking at everybody else so damaged and yet me with minimal damage in them each other you know that didn't happen that didn't happen to you but you know I the Lord allowed me to get just enough damage to say well if it didn't happen to me what happened to my car how did this damage get on my car cause it wasn't that way before and what-have-you but I truly thank the Lord for being a ever-present help in the time of trouble truly he was and that's something that I'll never forget it was just that close to coming into the new year in my life could have been wiped out just like that and he was right there on the scene thank you thank God for the Lord allowing sister Gina to be over here that night because has she heard that her mom was in an accident she's over in Okeechobee I can imagine how the enemy with a play with her mind and for sister Carmen sister Tina to come stand with me because I was shaken up about it I really was shaking out I'm okay I went to get myself checked out it's very little it's just concerning but I just I just had to share that again I'm sorry if I talk too much about it but it was just it's just amazing it really is amazing what God did for me that night it truly was a year of the incredible down to the very end to the very end certainly thank God for proving himself to be Jehovah Nissi a man a member of the Troy I saw you had your hand up a man praise God praise the Lord since the brief I see testimonies about cars this this evening and I just want to give a testimony about this past Sunday after communion my wife had to go to the stop by the store and I finally made it home and she give me a call and say well the car won't start she said well I'm gonna see if I keep trying to we had once before had a little issue with it not starting but rest let it stop for a while and after about three minutes or so it finally started so I felt like it was finally start it'll ever start just keep trying I think it's that's been a flat spot on the starter or something along those lines so she just kept trying to kept trying I kept texting and saying how about now not yet on that so about an hour or so passed by and she said well can't you come and get me I say yeah I'm gonna come on up there and she said well what we gonna do I say just leave it here cuz I was off the next day and I'll take care of it tomorrow so she had to go to work the next day so I got up and took her to work and I dropped her off and all my way back to go and check on the car my truck overheats so I'm on the side of the road and the one cause in the parking lot at the store and my trucks overheated on the side of the road so I finally got my truck too worried about it just water pouring out off from underneath everywhere and so I've got some water and I refill my reservoir and my radiator and everything and it was able to get me where I was going so I went straight to a mechanic that I was gonna have look at her car and as I was talking to the mechanic I went inside when I came back out and I'm looking at this part of this stream of water coming from my car and it's oil and water mixed in so yeah I pay me that's what I would look on my face oh no oh no not oil right that's exactly how I felt so I was like oh gosh what I put on it was head gasket if i crack a block or whatever so that basically and you know you my mechanic I called him I totally said well he said uh how you think how you feel about my heart to get you a new vehicle so I'm like well a lord if this was your your hand on pushing me and nudging me in that direction it's time to get a new vehicle you know then it's just time to get a new vehicle so I was kind of you know just kind of just kind of distraught by that I was able to put more water in it just enough to get me home and when I got home I prayed about it I said you know I'm not gonna let the devil have the victory so I talked to Lord say Lord whatever your will is you know I spoke with my wife I said lord I thank God that you've that you've given us this transportation and Lord we've put these automobiles to your service so and the devil is just trying to disrupt what what you're doing this is not our battle this is a battle between you and the enemy and we're just kind of in the cart in the middle so whatever you have prepared for us or whatever you're doing loyal I you know I've just be willingness whatever so I'm not gonna let this get me down I'm not gonna get upset I'm not gonna get razzled about it we're just gonna trust in the Lord and we're just going to go on so I was then I found out I put more water in the in the reservoir and I went to the to see about her car finally got it towed to the mechanic and the mechanic said I went and got the part he looked at it he said well as this and that night her car was back on the road he fixed her car that night and the next night he looked at my truck and the next night fixed my truck two days both cars back on the road now I'm gonna tell you the good part about this testimony my car had had a slow water leak for about two years and I had just been adding water and water I had two mechanics looked at it I can't tell water water coming from I don't know where the water coming from we can't find anywhere and I thought I was losing water in the engine I said oh man so I I this is gonna be a big cost and everything so I'm gonna just keep adding water I drive around with a five gallon jug in my truck just in case you know I could just refill the water and keep going you know so but in the midst of this situation not only did my truck get fixed but that leak yeah you know just trust him I just felt like I needed to give that testimony man he's a good god he's a good guy certainly appreciate that a man thank God for all the testimonies tonight we are gonna just turn it this moment just prepared for the word of the Lord a man up or the quake who's gonna come and speak for us tonight and I believe that the Lord has placed something in his mouth foster here and I know that uh you know we'll all be

but we are not going to read more about the mysteries or the seven seventh messenger but something that pertains to you and I amen revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to 11 and a voice which I heard from heaven speak unto me again and said go until the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went on to the angel and he said unto me and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as a knee and I took a little book out of the Angels hand and added up and it was in my mouth sweet as a knee and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again for many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen so our emphasis will be on the eleventh miss and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings amen and now revelation 10 as God is a three-foot scriptures verse 1 the mighty angel is Jesus Christ himself who put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea the land sees the multitude of people it's not just a it's not a physical see a physical land but a lot put his power this is people the land is people he's put his power in you and I by the Holy Ghost by the eternity new by the new birth amen so the Lord has fulfilled a portion chapter 1 the Lord has done it already now chapter 7 which you already know in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to speak the mysteries of God should be finished as is given to seven a profit which is what this william brangham elijah he finished his portion or the mysteries of God writing from Genesis to Revelation the last verse of Revelation is cleared up is open to us amen there's no more mysteries it as a mystery is already been opening maybe the Lord have not seen it yet amen it might be mystery to me but a lot has remember a jack has seen it already but maybe I'll come to it amen glory hallelujah so there's no more mystery in the Bible there's nothing that God is now going to bring another measurement messenger to reveal no it's already finished explain he said read an amen now this 8 to 11 but braum if I searched a message maybe I could be wrong but I never found an aversive abramius in the scripture each to 11 for himself just like Jesus when you read a read a I think Isaiah 55 he read about the first coming and he put a stop because it came as a lamp he didn't touch the second coming and he closed the book and put it there because it was one at a time so it's impotent william brangham it was an inscription he didn't touch it and God does in British scriptures each eleven is reserved for the wife of Jesus Christ amen that is you and I amen that is our scripture and if you don't fulfill it is going to light it the devil cannot fulfill it they don't know nothing about this if you give a kick to a cut maybe the kick will not do over the card but if you get a kick to a man or a woman you do you take you take of it amen so you and I it is our scriptures to fulfill the trance the people's the tribe the tongues the kiss are you and I amen and that is our scripture that is the scripture that God has given to you it is your power amen that when you stand on this which are no demon no devil can defeat you because it's the Lord wait for you praise be to God because when we no opposition we just inheritance this is for you you don't know is for you how you gonna inherit it but if you know that is my inheritance from a has history from my father from my mother I just go with boldness and step into it plant my corn plant my apples cultivated do farming livestock's do whatever you want to do on it amen the same thing God has given it a strip just like a lamb is modern a land is more than gold that when we step into the scriptures it open another world is Vanessa lesser dimensions for us blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can stand on that scripture and defeat every enemy you can get rid of every Amalekite you can possess your inheritance you can claim your family you can put your ticket talking on your loved ones you can receive your promises that God has given to you was the word of the Lord for you amen and nothing no creation as I cannot come in for Philly for you know Jamie I cannot do it for you Elizabeth cannot come and wait for you by you at the modern-day Isaiah not in the Elizabeth in the Jeremiah in the Jesus Christ on earth - for full descriptions blessed be the name of the Lord our Lord is good amen we pray posture that I'll show you a more excellent we pray all of us we've got the Holy Ghost as we pre but a lot less free one time last year with somebody that I was in Oberon and a police guy from West Palm Beach Airport to Stuart and so on the way you asked me that how do you pray and so I turn back and look at him he was not a passenger seat and as oh how do i preside showed him how I prayed I prayed in the woods I love niche that's why I pray Lord in the woods I pray in my kitchen in a bedroom bathroom I preview a closet and it's okay there was a time he was struggling with prayer and a lot bless me went to the Lord you wanted to find an effective way of praying and Allah bless in the loss put to him that John I of praise in other ways write your prayers what you desire write them in a book in a notebook and I will show you write them in a notebook you come added dates the topic something specific that you want a lot to do for you and pray on the notebook demonstrate I just did a little sample here this is a notebook on [Music] the left side you write your prayer topic and I'm just using a sample that church the school our church our school and a manifestation of gift of God in the sins amen today's date is generate to attend 2020 and I just Kusum scriptures first Chronicle for 9 to 10 that is the prayer of Jabez his name or job as bitterness but the Lord changes in the money pretty simple prayer now Esther chapter 4 15 to 17 and then chapter 5 1 2 3 esta and his and her people they were in trouble and that I've wanted to wipe them widely juice hour from the earth extended from existence but then they went to prayer with his uncle Dupree for three days and three night and on a thirty he went before the king and the King said even half of the kingdom I'll give it to you and I was thinking about it half of the kingdom the scriptures are all types and shadows now esta it was the natural kingdom and half of the King know but now we are not looking for natural kingdom but now we already have that celestial kingdom you habits you find it before you drop on earth so it doesn't you already have eternal life you only needed to know by the Holy Ghost baptism so that is already settled but then what is the half of the kingdom you and I are looking for right here on earth amen you have a kingdom here when you free the lost prey I said a lot our Father that will be done on earth as it is in heaven so having it's already settled but on earth there are certain terms that is yet to be settled amen that is the half of the kingdom we are battling now amen so that is esta esta what is that type and type is a scripture that was relating this time but one is for food become a platform for you and I so in this time that was a reality the kingdom that they were looking for because they were going to kill all the Jews but then when he prepared with his uncle or cousin and all the Jewish people for it and went before the king which wasn't lawful because if you go to the king without being invited you can't get your head cut off so she went with boldness and in didn't look at the law but it went before about the law and move in the supernatural they meant the supernatural is beyond a loss of Nietzsche is beyond a loss of men amen the Lama said that you can do this but when God comes in God can override a law and give you a heritance amen the law can say that when this has happened there's no way God can do it amen the law was given a charge means to a woman who never had a woman whose room was operated and taken away the Lord can even overcome is the law of nature amen so your judge can be your lawyer at twenty as well amen so Esther had this fever but now you and I have inheritance that we need to possess now glory hallelujah so that is one of the scriptures the other one is revelation 10 8:11 the promise for the wife of Christ now not in the future but the nations the tongues that tribal people akin issue an I go inheritance amen then the last one is 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 9 that is before Elijah was taken to glory he asked Elijah what do you want me to do for you he said I want double portions of your anointing I said now has a very hard question but if you see me go you get it amen and it was so diligent nothing was able to change him from focusing on Elijah nothing has changed you from deviating from the Elijah's message so if focus your eyes on the largest message every promise the double portion is yours amen going away from a ladies message but you have kept your faithfulness in good times and in bad times you sustain him with the largest message but I like Elijah able to please the sons of the prophets said Elijah your master is going to be taken away as I shut up I know it it doesn't make no difference he crossed over the first one tried his feet he crossed over Jordan he went to another land is the same today you know your mother's gonna be taken away say I know shut up it doesn't matter he stood kept Elijah he didn't let that distract us take his focus take his concentration take his mile from his target he just aim at a target and go to a place the target asked him now is the time and the Lord gave him the double portion he asked for Elijah Elijah gave it to him amen because the Lord was in Elijah Elijah was a god on to Elijah amen the Lord of Moses who was God on to us Guardian skin and a double portion that you have given you all your life to forsake in the world you forsaken everything friends are forsaken you jobs prosperity portion is yours amen so this man asked me and we said the Lord shoot him to pre right here right on the left side the topic of the prayer the title sorry Tropicana he simply did and you can write a scripture whatever you want on the right side is a testimony and Thanksgiving so whatever you want to thank me son for to the love for like the testimonies the Lord has done for you you can just write it the way you want it you can write whatever the love of God in your heart whatever comes is the lot is pass your heart you can write briefly then you leave the rest of the pages for testimony when the law does it Amen so when you should have testimony we got to Stuart where we went and he's a businessman we went his Baba home we prayed for like probably 30 minutes with no time when freedom freedom freedom period and he asked me a request that I should pray for him regarding a lawsuit so I said okay give me a notebook as okay I'm gonna put your request at the first prayer Jonah in the notebook and I'm gonna ask God of heaven to do it for you so after a couple of months I think around me there about he said he did send me a paper works there was something legalese that he spent already fifty thousand and the sound plays so much which is bringing so much pressure on him his wife is taking ill and it's kind of the toll is too much on him so we prayed with him and I that was my first topic my first prayer Jonah that I did and a lot answered his prayer the Centrify ways and the case was cleared his of the oligarchies he's I put my own requests a lot of things that I needed to do I put it in the Jonah the law did it my school and different things it just came in succession the law did it for me and a lot of requests that I put so many of them so when brother Gabriel came I shared with him about the prayer request we got to meet the man so when he went he said his wife has been praying about Freyja as well and they also looking for a way to prayer so they read DUP the probe jabus and he got a book he read I gave him a copy of the book he read it and he went back to Columbia you know Berg a bro the minister from Columbia so he went and he showed his people and they took it to another level they just like the hood different people have some testimonies I'll share with brother Jack and rajaka and share with you sisters and brothers and one of them as funny ones was a sister that she was going through some problems the husband the family the husband has lost a job so the first thing she did she said the first pitch he didn't ask any requests she just wrote friends given unto the Lord so one foot patrol of thanked thanking the Lord not asking of nothin the second page she confessed a fortune since and mystics she just wrote Lord forgive me for this forgive me for that forgive me for this believe in your word forgive me for doubts and your promises so she confessed all as sins and the third page she put a desired before the Lord on the 15th day they call a husband for jobs there was healing in her family and blessings were just flowing her cousin she's crosses the Andreea her cousin had cancer she preferred a cousin she was going to do a surgery honest and I forgot the type of cancer but I have it on my cell phone so when she preferred the cousin the day she was due for for the surgery it was a couple of dishes the cousin how was the surgery said they didn't do the surgery so what happened is it well the doctor said there's no need to do the surgery because the cancer is not day glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord the cancer is gone so it has no need for the surgery and it's a des miracles of Americans over Morocco's another family I think that little boy that was I don't know bitten by a cat or the cat jump on the ice under like that he's pitch change he couldn't talk properly and also his eyes cross at one of the eyes cross they prayed for the boy and speech speech impairment and I problem was healed completely and a boy is normal this series of suits of testimonies but a but a Gabriel send it to me the speaking Spanish they hit translate in English and is so many things so many things even is testified to new believers people would even know the message and give them Jonah they did it and America says overwhelming what the Lord is doing is changing one sister said children they didn't go to church they just stopped going to church so she started praying to the Jonah rudia names in the inner Jonah and it wasn't long the children said mom we want to we want to do what you are doing and so really so but you want you to bias the notebook so it's a sure about the note we bought a notice for them and said we want to go to church with you she asked them but I said we want to go to church with you because we can see the power we can see the prayer prayer is like an order when you pray smells you can hear it it doesn't matter how far the person is let him go let it let they would take him or her how fast fast he can go he's still in a palm of the Living God amen because if the devil is in the palm of the Living God it's just an instrument for God to use to create a negative contrast so that you can see the positive contrast amen and the children are now back to the church back to the word of the Lord so if you have any requests for your family for loved ones for the sins anybody for your minister for your pasta write the name Francis answered Jesus wrote the names of she first so much in love with the Lord she just would join as educated Jonah where they ought to wake everywhere because the Lord will inspire on something she doesn't want to miss it so she has a Jonah everywhere it a lot Devere it something she just write it that is your personal Bible that you ready because the Bible that what up into esta it was recorded hadn't no be recorded you and I would have had it to read it it was something that was done the Lord Almighty did for them and somebody took pen did he have the pens that we have now where's my pen didn't have the fanciful prints alrighty know something used to putting in a what they call it a ghost thread this stuff like that and whatever they could write within those times and if somebody had a patient to pin it down on a table tablets and stones and what screws and furniture or wood or something like that and now we have it on purpose and iPad and fanciful technology to read you know you can just lie in your bed and read from your iPad but I didn't have it that way so we are writing Bible maybe the ababa may not last too long we will not live here for that long we don't know but at least you have a Bible something that you pin and when you do it the good thing about it is if I pray for somebody for example I pray for people from different countries a lot of my whatsapp sometimes sure but I would sweep people different when you go to Mexico before every country has their own problem cocaine cocaine is like candy cocaine is just nothing when I was in England when people can sell cocaine openly the police don't have time for that unless they catch you with like a huge portion my like if you and your girlfriend are selling crack the college can it's nothing I mean please I've got more crime to do with they don't care about scam people come and party a BMW with his girlfriend and just come they just sell it they come to good pharmacy by certain drug and added to it to make it more high so I can hire more police don't have time they have time for like keys knife crimes twelve-year-old assisting year-old attacking old ladies taking their handbag cell phone stabbing them if you try to resist so with crack if you want to mess your life that's your own business they don't have time for you with my own eyes put people are selling like I'm selling to buy a whole suite and police is coming by cell and see what the police is gonna do to one female one male and it came by and said you're right she's men you're righteous and they went by as a while this guy's Celica killings and she's graduating is nothing for them when I came to the US I saw they could see somebody with Jessie the suspect you have a cocaine they can choose you the police can change in Mexico you believe in a public public you be you been a public restroom and they bring it to you Coquina one time I've one of the felt ready understand nothing about Spanish one brother one that I went with and his wife they were my translators so we're coming back and is that ask him to buy antibiotics you come go to the pharmacy and buy whatever you want you don't need to have prescription so he that asked him to buy antibodies for him so we went in front of they have Walmart and everything we bought this antibiotic and this guy came in on bicycle and I didn't understand so he was impolite rokka rokka so their brother was laughing in his wife laughing and idea and said you know what you see is that you know do you know what he's asking for said no I said you wanted to buy cocaine draaga oh wow do with that so cocaine is nothing please use cocaine anyway marijuana is just it just like ice cream is nothing a lot of kids families their kids have been taken by drugs died in jail somebody could be sitting years old and it's already been in in prison before because of cocaine and drive like that so people send me requests pray for my children so john allen will help you to focus on your prayer it will help you to you write one page what the request is about and the brother said he prayed when he prayed you can put your left hand on their prayer and your right hand on the testimony and the thanksgiving where you are expected a lot to give a testimony and is that it could pray and pray and got really sick vibration and you know the Lord has already answered a prayer is a lot can do it for is called Greek the Lord can do the same for you amen the same power of God is in you and when you write it one it helps you to focus one your mind you can go back if the Lord does it for you today tomorrow it could be your testimony or testament to another brother somebody might go through situation you can show that the Lord did this I have a testimony here this person was in this problem the Lord will heal this person from cancer not country listen for you or for your loved ones amen praise be to the Living God there's nothing like the Lord's who is been a blessing for me it's been a blessing that will help you and I spoke with a person eyes cook something with brother Jairaj I could give you more details that if you want to start prayer Jonah you write whatever is on your heart write it what I shall request what I say laughs you want to share with the Lord just lord I love you for saving me that's even good enough amen once as I said she writes she never fell in love with a lot that much it's not fall in love with the Lord and she just write about the love of God it just on ending she came home and she said at the dining table and she just right for the Lord said I've never had that intimacy with a Lord and thank God prayer Jonah has helped me to have that intimate relationship with my husband his wife supernatural husband I'll have my natural husband is not jealous about that because we all have the same husband Jesus Christ amen so he writes about the love of God and he said exchanger writer brothers the ministers are write their names and pray for them I write my brothers and my sisters in the church and pray for them I write a nice of people amen and pray for them and you know when you are praying for somebody the Lord knows you have a need so just like you are washing I give you my handkerchief or my clothes to watch for me as you are washing my clothes your hands are being washed without even knowing so as you are interested in for other people the Lord knows you have a need to the load know you have your own problem and as you put your problem that I am praying for others the Lord would solve your problem without even you cream for it amen the Lord would do for you without even laboring I mean trying or struggling sometimes blesses who come to you when you have not even asked the Lord because you are standing in the need of prayer for others a meant as a song that is he said it's me it's me Lord not my standing in need of prayer right not my past I love my brother not my mom not my dad but it's me a lot so if you put yourself in that intercessory position put your Salah Jesus Christ as a sacrifice Jesus was an Aries was born in April somewhere as a sacrifice for us william ramos an Aries it was one as a sacrifice to shed his blood all his life was sacrificed for God's people amen he wanted to be a cowboy William Bramley couldn't get to be a cowboy he went to buy a Levi's jeans because was from the tribe of Levi so his natural life was typing in supernatural life him n1 away from it wouldn't be a cowboy so he was writing his destiny even when he was a little boy he was writing poems about his ministry when he didn't know amen so since that you are going through the hardship is a Bible you might not know it you might have even understanding why do I have to go through this why this suffering why this issue why this problem why me Lord why not other person by your by your life is a Bible you might not see it now but the Lord will shoot you that my son my daughter well done for the father used to phone amen for your rights in you a you are an a under ink holder your body your life was a paper that I was writing my scripts on amen and so Lord thanks to you if I was I was found worthy to be the pepper that you prescribed you could scream or something on it amen so what you go through the clutter to get a lot is put in your life through the problems and afflictions it's a Bible on to others amen glory hallelujah to the Lord the Lord is good the this some more testimonies I wish time is not I wish I wish a trade off so that you can take your time and listen to it but a few things praise be to God the Lord is omnipotent and whatever whatever the Lord dwells there's so many Putin's around him let's even take naturalistic in the time of Moses when the Lord came to Mount Sinai the sauna became sacred and ora koutou the law because that was where the Lord was manifest and giving the laws like Vibram was in sunset mountain the load was bringing a new covenant through mooses so not even an animal could touch Sinai because it was a sacred ground for the Lord now son son I mount wasn't him service son Oh son said son I right Thomas son I thank you my sauna is not a sacred animal because a lot is no day by the time of Moses it was a sacred ground applause I was well now Ramazan I you Adam a sauna of this hour you are the omnipotent of this hour you had a little mess out of this hour so when you when you recognize who you are as the you added a little omnipotent just like esta esta was a little opening potent and prayer open the door for the omnipotent see to manifest prayer is the key not open the omnipotence in your life to manifest it's already there it just like a crowd you can have a beautiful craft fanciful for whatever Chevy if you don't have the key to studied or remote or something like that is useless it can transport you the same thing the power of God is not in heaven the power of God is in you and I amen but an if you know it will anoint your soft with prayer so that the power manifests the power be detained in you forever and once it manifested the power is less like MgO God has been Jelena in else but when we list the Lord through praise the Lord goes to wait is that when you talk about me is that when you talk about now let all men onto myself so when you talk about him through praise through testimonies through the love of God through songs through Thanksgiving through whatever means a lot gives it to you you bring a lot into manifestation in your life and in the life of other people amen so let's start this year with praise generally that even our children the little ones give them a new book by Cobra so you have no books to write it right whatever and you fill your house with praise don't worry about a trance whatever you think is a headache for you put it down and just let the left side that is your prayer that's a battleground and the right side is your victory amen is a double portion and you just free and believe it go from we're good - we're good to school wherever you go to come back home look at your pressure now pray to the Lord the way you wanted you don't have to put your left hand and right hand if you forget to do it as a lot lease you but you keep your prayers on whatever you are like this as I said I've fallen in love with the Lord so much like I've never done before you just generally my prayer and said it flows and Allah speak to them when I listen to this testimony for that anointing it flows from their heart the Lord comes out and they do it and the poor that started they were struggling with it and said each time I hear that testimony about what the Lord is doing I was compelled and I begin to do it and now see my own testimony it's going to Deborah - are you somebody in Cuba and it's taking fire in Cuba as well about prayer because what a devil use of the face God's children is that you can take your power but if you can stop you from manifesting your power you Dan the power he cannot take it is a fire but then you can create an atmosphere that you lose confidence in yourself in the goddess is in you you lose your self-image that you a daughter you are omnipotent you wanna hear to fulfill Revelation chapter 8 so Revelation chapter 10 8 to 11 you have a scripture that a Lord ordained for you before you drop here and nothing can take your place that no devil can take your children away from you no devil can take your loved ones you got all the power of God to chase after them with faith and bring them back to the Lord amen so let's start this yeah with prayer left with all our hearts don't worry about the past put the past behind and now less from now going let's do this support our minister our pasta the church in prayer and this weed and I do overwhelm you amen because it allowed did he for one he's already done for the race amen the law doesn't discriminate he loves you amen and so he wanted to pray he want us just to Yoda us off to him you don't have to drop us off about a lot of things which are worse off with if we come pray sudden things to take care of themself cause there's a dimension in you there's a supernatural meaning you that certain things you don't have to struggle to use of physical force for a supernatural force going to display there are certain times I'm working I see people fightin and I I don't want them to fight I know who is behind a fight a devil it could be a family could be being friends but they would create confusion but I feel in my heart I wish I can go stop them but I can't go do that but I pray my heart Lord let peace be in them and I see peace riding them right there so there's something in you beyond your physical limitation in the physical we are limited you can do so if I can go through this war physically but if they say need behind these walls this is supernatural been in you and I that a supernatural not limited to this meets this means is not limited to your flesh is no limit at your finances is not limited to the number but he is supernatural it means his was beyond the natural limitations and you can go beyond your natural capabilities and do the incredible the outstanding things that you can you cannot even imagine you do the things that is beyond your thinking is do the things that beyond how much you can imagine for you so let's take it with all our hearts and you put a lot to test the Lord I've heard about this prayer Jonah I want to try I want to try you to see your power just like Elijah when you got is the largest mantle he also tried a mantle that all that Elijah said is true yes should try God and God was to want to be put to the test so it's a lot if the where's the god of Elijah I've given all my life I've been your seven I had my family a hard land and farm you call me from my lands I left my horses and my cow and donkeys and whatever and I footed Elijah all these years I want to see that what I've got the mantle of Elijah is for real amen and there was a Jordan one of the rivers into the mantle and the river and the river open the Bible said that if the ether open here and there and it passed through so if you have got a little ideas for the sort of the kinnison's what about trad that you are going through take it to the Lord in prayer and straight a problem with phrase amen just like Elijah's try the water with with it with a lady's mantle the same thing strike the problem with praise thank you god bless you strike your problem with praise it doesn't matter put it before the Lord I've seen it I've in my prayer Jonah since about before the Lord things about people things that I want a lot people's issue this the Lord revealed to me when I was came to the message add a little bit of that but not to that degree I used to write ministers and people's names and pray for them sometimes when I had a church in Ghana I pray for people's issue when the Lord does it I told every part we thank a lot and threw it away I didn't know that I could keep it as a testimony but now God will always use somebody to bless you somebody that I just met in a way is been a turbo blessing for me amen is going to everywhere different please Mexico different places so let's start here with all our heart families get a notebook but a Jaguar could get it for you don't worry if it is some people I get some I'm not a good mother Jack about you working outside but a jack take your time from they will come and you write your notes you can go to de la shop you just rise whatever buy some notebook one dollar you can get it over they write your desires write what you need write what you think is hard for the Lord one time William Brown the law say Culebra ham you want to squirrel and a lot said a sport how many you won three and it's okay let the first one come from this angle he showed it you got so excited he forgot he asked three he was booing the loss and how many the USA three okay go ahead and show the result is okay is what make it harder for the Lord let his second or the third one come from a sycamore tree and squirrels don't go on sycamore tree and blue and behold this escorting sycamore tree he shorted the third one said I wanted on a certain stack it went right there he spoke it into creation and showed a squirrel so when you are going through difficulties sometimes good should a lot Pam incident you could easily get this but you are trying and you can't get it you try it's like it's far away from you you get closer but you see don't seem to get it the lot is working your feet to get a third Pooh you could be disappointed or not why can't I just get this it's just right here why can't I just this be done this way but a lot is bringing the third Pooh is well in you I just I William Brown it went to the woods he never found nothing but I was a third waiting for him amen Putin is purple went for fishing when the Lord died and resurrected didn't get no fish and it fried into a great fisherman did he fish they tried and did everything that wasn't even a single fish to eat their food to eat their food but guess what a man just appeared and I said children what's going on years while we fish all night okay take your net go to this side so we've we fished on the whole river I was a raw fish our money know it from from coast to coast we've already gone through this split there's no school of a school of fish here and say you just three three or net they threw it in the cooling wind it was so much than they who asked for so when there's battles around what you are praying for don't give up it's a sign that a lot has done it for you when you pray for sickness and the signal is getting ways don't give up is a sign the Ramseys a son of divine healing proof of situation switching get out of control your mind is all we know what lambda is I mean there's no need there's no need keep praying amen and keep believing and a lot want you to be open important they wanted to express or many possessing you assist you believe them and bring them to as this where you want em to be if you want is treat to move from this place to this place you put it in your heart that is trees know where I want it to be this is my heritage I want these two to be moved from this angle to be position here don't worry about how the tree said no I'm not going I'm going to be here I'm not leaving this my put this where I'm going to be I'm not going to be on this side don't worry just just a bluff amen he's already there and we're singing right here and we would say you know what I'm sorry I want this way I want to be you'll be right there because they said there's poking where they see you and the rapture that you are waiting for the resurrection that you are looking for I see you amen it's a person of Jesus Christ in you and when you get that revelation and the Scriptures my brother my sister there's nothing I can limit you god bless you so Jonah here having my book I wrote this one here I'll give it to my dad will give it to whoever I want to give it to you after your strike here I will just write here so I use one

Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord how we certainly thank God for this word it may you can be seated just for a moment brother quick who was sharing this with me and and I just felt it was quite important for us to come on this first Friday of the year and just kind of get the church in this in this particular channel when prayer is our key prayers are key and I know we have been I feel very successful with the concerted prayers where we've been coming together with us with the sisters and with or with the brothers you know that's that's something that in all honesty my wife is she she had the desire you know just to kind of get the sisters together and start praying and you know she came to me with it and you know and I okay well this let's do it this way and let's do it that way in and the sisters came I think this has been coming I don't know how many years doing the prayer I don't know how many years it's been a seven or eight roughly six or seven somewhere in there six or seven and the brothers I think picked it up about four years ago but we have been seeing God move ants the miraculous ways just through through prayer through prayer and and and I just believe that where the Lord is taking us now is not just to the group our concerted effort now is getting personal now it's getting personal right and if we would be honest with ourselves one of the biggest areas that we would all fight him is an area of Prayer right and you know recently I was you know just with some just in this little whatsapp group with some ministers and in different brothers would would put requesting pray over this and pray over that and pray over this and and I would see different brothers they would say they put the pray enhance or they're like you know brother I'll pray for you now I'll keep I'll remember that but when I respond I would say things like father in the name of Jesus touch my brother meet this situation now God in the name of Jesus and that's all I would do and you know I happen to look in the group just the other day and if somebody put a request out and I saw a lot of people saying father in the name of Jesus it just changed the whole dynamic right just just just one prayer can change the whole dynamic of things right and it's not not you know somebody saying pray for me and you you never get to it right yeah I mean yeah you and you had good intentions but you forget because our schedules are so busy that we you know we want to do right but but I think this is a way for us to really get a hold of all that we're gonna let nothing slip by you know that do you know when you forgetting that's the devil blocking you from praying for that person the saint you know that if you start praying do you know I mean the brother branham told us that when the weakest Christian you know what they get power yeah you know what you know what a weak Christian get power the weak Christian get power not just coming to church the weak Christian get power when they hit their knees I don't care how weak you are if you would just hit your knees like and can you imagine this is a man don't know nothing about the message he's just no prayer right he came up with this this idea he said Lord I want to be effective in my prayers and God showed them write it down and the scripture even tell his right division and after you make it plain and say he got run oh come on church he's gonna run after you read it right so so you know I tell you when I heard this I say this would be a perfect way for us as a church start this year would have with a prayer journal a prayer journal writing your prayers down on the left side and then on the right side just Thanksgiving and - and when God has done it you write the testimony as well on the right side and what this does is allows you to go back and see what God has already done for you and you just begin to just you know you know that if he's done it before he'll do it again now what we're doing actually is trying to get a number of these for the church we're gonna order a whole bunch of them for the church to give to everybody and we're gonna kind of specialize them for spirit and truth tabernacle and we'll give them to the church but I didn't want to wait till the end to give them to everybody so do we have any okay just let's start with the 10 let's do we have at least 10 families let's start with families first and let me get this let's start giving it to 10 families there you just gotta bring them on out give it a 10 minutes let's start with the families then we'll get down to the individuals after after we get it so I know we got I think 10 families praise the Lord we don't we gonna get we're gonna you know we're gonna catch division then we gonna step into it amen amen so praise the Lord all right give give give one sister that's good that's good that's good that's good your prayer journal this is your prayer journal

brother Troy's car but he had cars but he had the right attitude in it and God within hours everything was was reversed everything had turned around and not only that you fixed a problem that he didn't even go to get fix Lord that's the type of God you are that's the type of God you will just like you answered for Abraham when he was interceding the Lord for the righteous in in Sodom he was interceding Lord he never did come out and acts for lot in his family he never didn't come out an accident but you gave it to him you gave it to him I believe Lord there'll be things that you'll give to us even if we didn't ask for it hallelujah God because we're approaching it the right way Lord let us receive what you've spoken tonight and let it not be just words that are coming out of a man's mouth but lord may we hear the voice of God speak to us tonight the Lord may we be ready to fall a man and subjection bless us Lord as we leave this place but not your presence and we trust Lord Jesus that you would bring us back at the point of time and Lord me the testimonies begin to flow through this church Lord from this night may testimonies begin the flow Lord every week may we hear something of how you even answer somebody's prayer that it would encourage others Lord to join us in this journey goddess in Jesus thing that we ask it amen amen amen amen praise the Lord we'll prepare to dismiss but I you know there's a person that I need to pray for and I forgot to mention it so before we go brother John LaFontaine has been going through a number of things we pray for him once before but we want to pray for him again tonight I know he had to go to have a surgery and the city was doing well and all of a sudden just kind of took a turn for the worst but we want to pray that God would just intervene for brother John la Fontaine I told the the family that we would pray and that's exactly what we're gonna do and then we're gonna create this [Music] [Music] sure will shew it praise the Lord let's take these requests before God's throne father we become amen on behalf of brother John my fontaine and also on behalf of this neighbor god it's not by accident that you're loud brother tries to sit on you to live next to this lead god that we could bring requests on behalf of others into the house of God a man knowing that we serve a God that not only hears but he answers prayers our God is not a God of stone the god of woodland but our God is a living God and Father we we just come a man asking that you would intervene in both of these situations you know the conditions God and we placed the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ in between the patients and their conditions law believing that you were wounded fought transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes god we declare healing for both of these people God and Father we just believed that there would be a lot of return on this prayer and we believe God that you'll raise them up father for your glory for your honor and Lord of dis neighbor does not know you and the part of the sin we pray God that somehow she would come to know you and the pardon of Sammy Lord dis servant of God that a man is just going through he's preached the gospel for a number of years and Lord just in a real truth servant of God but not a enemy's attack in his body we come against the devil right now and father you told us that whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so we lose the power of God the healing virtue of God to flow through every vein God and that to raise your serving up for your glory father what we send the word to him right now in Ohio that you God would just get glory out of this situation we know there's nothing too hard for you God so we thank you in advance for these requests being made manifest bless us now goddess will leave this place but not your presence it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen God richly bless you you can be seated well the brothers were coming to dismiss you if you desire a man to place offer it you can just put it in the wooden box Amen there on the table as you're leaving tonight god bless you we'll be back on Sunday morning [Music] [Music]
