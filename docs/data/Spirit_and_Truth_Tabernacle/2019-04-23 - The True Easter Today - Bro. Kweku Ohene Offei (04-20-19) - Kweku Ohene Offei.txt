there are pleasures forevermore amen Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word and as we just prepared into the service tonight 2,000 years ago our Lord and Savior went to a cross and where the world thought it was over at the cross there was something going on and a man there in hell and he was setting some captives free praise the Lord for that a man and not only did he set captives free and hail but till still today he still said in captives free and and we're grateful they meant for His grace and for His mercy that had set us all free again as I said last night had he not gone to

before we go further I'm just gonna have pastor smiling just come greet us just for a little bit a man and I mean appreciate thank for Instagram I just got a little snippet but I have to go back and get the rest for the Troy talking about faith nation want a when I see what God is doing great things you know been appreciate we have brother David over I'm grateful for what God is doing in this hour raising up you know raising up young men take a stand for the takedown just stay with it and be consistent so in spite of everything when I see that it gives me courage [Applause] continue to press on I tell you what I was sitting there I've been in the book colossus for a bit and i said 'i just listening to the song [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] we certainly thank God for all things I was mentioning last night one of our prayers has been that God with our prayer was Lord either raisa hel or sin help and then God said no now I'm gonna do something different I'm raise up hell and send help I'm gonna take all round and I'm gonna give you a time won't even know how to ask God for things right we don't know we don't know how we put whatever you got on your list right now put a handle [Music] hallelujah God can do that plus plus plus a man so we just state the Lord and tonight we're we're happy to be able to welcome a man a brother Queen cou to the pulpit he's one that the Lord has sent a man as helping and and a couple things that I appreciated about brother quick ooh is the first time when he came here he never told nobody that he was a minister they didn't say anything to anybody the man used to pass the church and he just sent here to say a Mantid word and I think the first service that I saw him cuz he come I wasn't here the first service but the second when I got back the Quaker was sitting in the back I think the brothers you know put him in the back and as he come visa no no no I make his way to the front you know and he and he said Danny hold that down and he was sitting there just so home when just you know never never really saying anything and I found out that he was a minister I said brother we woman we want to use you you know and and and things of that nature and I said I'm if you don't mind we got us preacher for New Year's Eve service but if you can just come and maybe get 15 minutes of an exhortation or something you know just just share something and then let the preacher come and that's always a test for a minister right I mean if you get the the mic and you can't stay within the 15 minutes that's that's a problem that's the truth I had to go through the same train and I went to a church one time and they'd wanted everybody to talk for seven minutes they had about seven speakers everybody get seven minutes well I went up and I think I spoke four full minutes and drop something just sat down pastor looked at me like what any and after everybody got through speaking cuz some of them went over these seven minutes and if they everybody got through speed and he looked down at me and saying I that's what I'm talking about it's a test right so I'm brother quit cool company I say 15 minutes for the quicker come up here and drop the bomb woloson and put the mic down and when I saw that I say I can trust this man glory to God glory to God so I'm just so so so happy and and as the Lord has sent us help of this year we have done a lot on trying to Amen just develop here the church and you know and God has been been really good typically when we leave town brother brother smiley always fill in for us and it's just been a mainstay and I appreciate that and I'm not gonna kick him to the curb the next month I think next month we're gonna be having brother smiley come over and speak for us and a man and we're gonna be looking forward to that and and and and you know but I appreciate what the Lord is doing on how he's just using the help that we have and I'm grateful for that and and and and I appreciate a man just brother quick cooing and I won't also say this I'm half-brother smiling but I'm also be created sometime brother Jill we gonna have you this year you're gonna come anytime I see preachers coming and sit and just enjoy the service I like that I mean you know because everybody want to put what this might you know you don't understand what's behind the mic right if you typically person that longing for the mic [Music] ain't got nothing to say I'm gonna be honest with you right under sink but it's the one that really ain't trying to get behind that make them the one that we want right so don't know what we're looking for so if my brother Joe I appreciate your coming tonight and we'll have you this year I promise you you'll be here to preach for us a man we appreciate appreciate that so let's stand to our feet a man and less uh prepared to welcome brother quake ooh they man and I hope you come under expectation tonight I hope you come under expectation

life that we lost through Adam in Christ we found that life and that is eternal life that we cannot die we are Atena father Lord you've shown us who we are Lord that we are part of you we haven't rise Lord we are not about everyone father we don't have a beginning our flesh may have a beginning but cry seen as does not have a beginner Lord Jesus raised this same creative spirit in you lord is in

magnify your name Lord Jesus Christ our brother Chad said we on the greatest petition law yes better than miraculous in our lives we are expecting a big breakthrough Lord in every areas of our life in the church Lord the Lord will give all the glory back to you in your service law we thank you who they're sick Lord we give you the glory give you Anna in Jesus Christ we pray amen hallelujah shall we give up inaudible all the time he is Christ amen we are not here by coincidence because there's no coincidence in Christ's way before the foundation of the world they are not elected you to stand here where you are right now you put you here in West Palm Beach to be his glory to miss Anna so all of eternity is within you and is behind you amen the Lord is we died when Adam died but Allah begin to resurrect us a little to call a Monisha and then bring us to who you were before the foundation of the world because you as sons and daughters of God or did unto good works and the Lord is bringing it to pass amen shall we grab our Bible if you can let's read a couple of scriptures from John chapter 12 verse 24 John 12:24 John 12:24 verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruit amen and if you want to read the 25 he that loves his life shall lose it and he that eateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life and let's jump to 1st Corinthians chapter 15 1st Corinthians chapter 15 verse 22 23 first Corinthians 15 22 23 1 Corinthians 15 22 23 but now in but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept 21 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead 22 for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive and we have been made alive at the new bed 23 by every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then cometh the end when he shall deliver deliver up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and the power amen god bless you shall we be seated we want to pick east as rain east are going to pick a little scripture on a lot of thought on Easter what is Easter weekend we know about Easter we know it is relation of the Dead is about death burial and resurrection so we want to caption our Simon the truth is that today the truth is that today amen today when you go to different part of the world probably the time might be a little different in different parts they already into Sunday between the Philippine in they are really celebrating Easter I mean Sunday some actuality are certain countries that they kind of imitate Christianity we have people across and they whip them just like they did to Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago I think if in southern countries people sacrificed himself to be killed but what is the truth is that today because that is not Easter weeping somebody killing somebody putting a cross on somebody like Jesus in a Roman cow enemy teaches something 2,000 years ago it's just a painted fire if you paint me if I'm cold I'm freezing and you paint me and fire on the wall which you know is like a flame it's not gonna warm me up I need a live fire so imitation of Easter 2,000 years ago is not Easter but it's an e-stop going on right now because every scripture has got compound meeting a compiled revelation amen now in star 2,000 years ago when Adam was planted on this earth he came by the spoken word of God so the Lord wanted him to speak his offspring into creation to populate the earth with the spoken word of God but an instead of Adam doing that Adam showed all of us into death by the sexual bathe as we know sittin Eve cross or serpent Eve cross that brought all mankind in creation into death but the movement are implanted into that death Christ Jesus Elohim begin to crittendon's from death back to life amen because the program was the program program of God to bring the attributes of redemption amen so without a death there could not be resurrection without Adam being platanus into death sickness and problems God cannot bring us back into resurrection Redemption and into glory so the Lord had to have Adam to do the contrast by planting all creation into death so the scriptures say that in Adam or dies but in Christ or shall live EMEA because as a master plan there's Christ himself behind the scene so now in time the lobby need to bring justification upon the earth because this earth is gas own heart God has got different planets other universe Jupiter Mercury but if mankind right on earth and if I'm right is the third planet three is the number of perfection so God water to marry the earth and you choose out of the planet the planet earth to bring forth his wife on this planet amen this is where God put us we are not going to live in Jupiter no we are not going to believe in mercury science is trying to go to mass in 2234 I was in Houston I think 2023 sorry 2012 and we were talking about the were actually prophesying about going to mass around 2035 getting ready to put man on mass but that is not a program of God the program of God is right here on this element God will raise his sons and his daughters from this element so the Lord brought no one on earth and no one when Noah was on earth there were two prophets Enoch was on earth but God does not deal with to make a profit at the same time so no I was having his eyes on Enoch who was his adding a great grandfather because Noah came from Lamech Lamech him from Methuselah Methuselah came from Enoch so if I'm right he was the fourth generation very long so you can see your grid probably great-great-grandparents cause the way they were sown well I found it before they go marry Adam was 130 something so it wasn't like our time we're probably wanna see your great-grandparents so sorry I said Adam no one had his eye on Enoch and he knew that as soon as you know leave the earth it was time to begin his ministry amen just like Elijah and Elijah Elijah never kept his eyes on Elijah he kept his eyes on Elijah all the time he didn't think it's like off the nationís God raptured Elijah Elijah began his ministry and as soon as God ruptured Enoch and Noah begin his ministry and that's not a rupture Alijah of Rd the Minister of the wife began and God before he not left God made and not to build a pyramid the pyramid what the first Bible God wrote was the zodiac the skies let me just backtrack a little bit now before we had this paper Bible and electronic Bible and what we have I didn't have a Bible to use computers from self who know Adam had a Bible which was the sky the zodiac was very simple right his Bible was the Sun the Moon the Stars and all the glories of the heavenly now when you go to the zodiac the Sun depict Christ s UN s Co and son of God the moon is the wife of Christ so when the Sun does his wake and go to sleep then he put his power authority over the moon to these pleased attributes in the night amen just like when a man travels out of whom he has fathered a wife and the kids that when I'm not here honey let my children free let him go to sleep at this time because the woman is the coming of the man amen the bride is a revolution of the husband the wife is the ministry of the husband amen so God put all those stars and moons there now they're stars we have 12 the first Bible had 12 characters or figures they call it the houses of the zodiac as we have 12 months all of us were born in one month or the other so those were the 12 characters major characters you can name them we know that the Aries Christ was born in Aries because it was a sacrifice on to the world and whatever please are you a born you have that nature is new amen I was born in Libra and that is my husband each other as a Libra is in the natural inner spiritual so God ordained you before the foundation of the world now all the stuff that we see in the atmosphere they represent sons and daughters of God India attributes amen every star in the atmosphere is talking about you and I amen we don't worship them but then they depict our glory on earth so the provinces are before God even does something on the upon the earth he reveals it in the heavens amen and we have three kinds of heavens we have eternity since dimension we have the atmosphere the skies and the church is heaven amen the church is not a Foursquare Bolton the chess is you and you are having buddy-buddy goose baptism so when a demacia he read us that that Bible that was his Bible now God oh did not end up to to read a second Bible the first Bible God rooted himself now the second Bobby knock where profit was a profit and profit have got ability to speak things into creation and to speak things out of creation amen when Adam went go let's go back to other sorry Abraham when God spoke a ram into creation for Abraham to sacrifice the next moment Abraham took the RAM out of creation but but up from creation but out of this creation amen prophet can speak things into creation they can't speak cancer out of creation this can speak healing into you and what our prophet don't look at Jeremiah Isaiah Jesus Christ yes they were Prophet William Brown by you a prophet if God only listen you amen you may not travel around the world seven times but you can travel in your home seven times [Music] maybe mono go to Europe or your life but in your home and your loved ones you can stab little random seven times and below the power is in you because price is you you are not less than God you are Christ in an attribute in a manifestation so if you've got Christ to you by the Holy Ghost baptism what about Christ can do whatever the Prophet can do you can do it all the creation everything going on here they are doing according to the Word of God Christ in you all of them consists because of Christ and if Christ is in you the creasing consists because of you so when a knock spoon scientists are trying to find out how they build a pyramid in Egypt there's a kind of found out hard critic as turns rock Wayne at Haun's 20,000 tons are putting put in the atmosphere it wasn't a fiscal humor me but there was a creative power of God because it not has to live a symbol of justification so enough body primate by speaking into creation as a symbol that God has justified the earth God wasn't going to destroy the earth is was going to redeem the eighth so when he was raptured quickly and Noah went to wake we don't know what know about the act and now in those times they had a scientists who a more advanced than what we have now and they can shoot atoms into the skies we can do things and so trillion the Rhydian things they did it they kind of they kind of dislodged the earth induce time before Adam like I said I hardly didn't read this vibe would hurt the skies didn't even have Klaus clouds begin to form when Noah came into the air amen Noah was a critter because he was part of Christ and the Klaus will also be part of the Bible we're going to talk about Jesus coming in Klaus soon as you meet Klaus for Jesus to come in so their prophet a prophet Noah has to bring crap clouds into creation so that Jesus can come in cloud they may 1963 they a class of glory not only the natural class but a few funnies you and I were they in 63 amen we went our Father Jesus Christ our husband Jesus Christ to reveal our self that we are a tenor and we live here gloriously eternal amen so now in the pyramid that not a sorry Noah built the prophet has got seven steps like the zodiac has got twelve houses it has got Christ who is God on the Sun the moon with the wife of Christ twelve stars who added boost up with the twelve tribes of Israel and all the stars that represents you and I and all the sons of God from Adam on to the last one everyone is represented in the Klaus now the pyramid has got seven steps which were to foreshadow the seven church ages seven messengers that will come now when you go to the permit every prophet has to have a piece the base is the Alpha you come bought a house in the skies you have to have a foundation so the foundation was the Alpha that was Jesus Christ who laid the cornerstone for us then he bought seven Church ages out of the seven Church ages who was going to marry from the seven through the seven steps from Paul up to brown up to Elijah now they were all body of one wife the wife is no mean is one but we are many it has a matter of billions or trillions we are members of the one wife of Christ we don't believe in Trinity we believe in one Christ and Christ has one wife amen glory hallelujah now when you plug the parameter first step to the service that before you go to they have a capstone that's really good keys Simba now when you get to the seventh step there's a there's an there's a messenger who is standing there a strong messenger that if you want to go to the King's Chamber want to marry to the king they can ask goddess orders through the messenger now you have to strip yourself as brother I was preaching yesterday we have to come and strip ourself not naturally but spiritually naturally one can strip yourself or a husband but a natural type the spiritual so we strip ourselves we come as naked before the Lord the Lord nothing I brought nothing I take away Here I am save me Oh Lord so the only cover ask you do you want to marry Jesus Christ if you say no then you go back if you say yes the condition is you have to strip you take off your clothing now Christ or the king will give you his clothing through the seventh so there's seven who put his clothes on you it doesn't matter how well you dress it doesn't matter the price of your your shirt or your dress or your skirt or your your head - it doesn't matter you shoe your high-heeled uou sneakers doesn't matter where nice night what is puma whether it doesn't matter your handbag how expensive versace or whatever three Messier [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God hallelujah it doesn't matter how expensive your clothes how nice you have to throw all of them there cabbage before they clean then put these clothes on you good into the King's Chamber you are now mrs. King Jesus Christ you're now mrs. King feel funny you are not a queen of heaven when you speak you know what is as good as the King amen but then you have to come up before this messenger with the Word of God who's the seventh angel who is really Umbra ham the word is not here physically he's here in the dimension is n establish a dimension but the word that God sent through him is our weight amen you take a word and wash yourself you go to the kitchen as valetroy DB to s the fastest today kitchen and give us to eat take and eat your body and so that Manya outgrew and you go through growing pains because you are growing amen so intended weight may not be pleasant but it's so good in your body sometimes you take medicine that are beta and sour but it's going to kill some gem in you it's going to help you going to provide some vitamin so we take those vitamins anyhow Here I am Lord I believe the word belief is not intellectual belief and all Scripture is natural language to to to to interpret scripture Athens beliefs to take and eat you believe what you believe is what you become what you eat is what you become amen so you eat Christ what you become Christ you in a way you become the way you eat eternity you become in Tennessee so we believe me as we believe in we take it in into our system and that become us and we become it amen so when you believe Christ not just intellectual years I believe Christ a buret row is telling us but you come naked and a lot of you strip you of your pride of the arrogance of your position of your fame in the world consumed all of them then is put on his garment the only goose not on the physical garment but he put Christ in you what is the hope of glory and the manifestation of your life on this earth without a holy cause you can manifest Christ having feathers to fly you cannot fly if you tell me to fly I can't ride maybe jump as far as I can go but I cannot fly but best have got their feathers and their wings to fly into the atmosphere amen so when you have the feathers of the Holy Ghost we can fly into the deep blue sky we can see the unseen amen problem that depresses people you walk through that problem and come out as pure as gold

something you'd as a control tower there's a keen in you please kill the Queen the queen is the flesh King Jesus is in it and as long as he's married to this this man this earth here the one year you

face fruits to many of them that slept we slept in Adam we were dead in sin and iniquity but when Jesus Christ rose from the dead we became the firstfruits manifestation sons and daughters of Jesus Christ became messiahs amen glory hallelujah so now we've come if you want this life of Christ you can go by ourselves you have to come before the messenger the word for what you paid you for the chance that the world putting you all the chance you can name it everything that was a junk in your lively Trinity doctrine three three persons God has to consume them goddess to consume the old face and what your parents put in you by the sex Beth got us to annihilate them completely then he Christ who put himself in you then you become Jesus Christ walking upon the earth amen your rapture is in you petition from here praise be to God hallelujah God is wonderful glory to God hallelujah let's read a message from God hiding in simplicity then revealing himself in the same 1963 God hiding yourself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same paragraph 3 7 9 it's talking about resurrection is that and when they say their griefs who open how is the graves going to open well when I haven't got a time to get into this what I wanted to I'm going to have to take this see just to show you the simplicity of God and that calcium put potage and everything everything that is in you of materials only mix a spoonful their flesh when you burn it is just a spoonful that's right and what that does it breathe back into that spirit and life God speaks and the rapture will come it ain't going out there and NGOs come down and shovel up the graves and get up get out and old dead carcass here what is this it was born in sin paragraph paragraph 161 cities sorry let me read further down but now a new one made in his likeness you know if you have this if you have this flesh will die again see the graves will open the dead shall rise that might be true but not open the way you say open scene so let's pause here the Prophet is an aggressive book in the Dead will rise thou be true but not the way you say open so we have to find out a way you and I say open how do we say open we think that one day God is going to come go to I don't know where the cemeteries are I think there's one close to Palm Beach and God when Ray's dead bodies angels will come and she'll go and get a caucus no that is not that is not resurrection and that is nobody day and he said now even if you bring that one out just like Lazarus you should go back to the dust amen but then he said not not the way you say open it will be that way now when is God opens God comes by the spoking wait gas grill opening is what we came to this earth through death of Adam by in our graveyard the F sin was the graveyard we were buried into my all in the tombstone of sin and unbelief because we were born wrong when Obama is cooking with just life but at Troy towards that drinking smoking is nice and I just attribute arson but sin is unbelief what is unbelief Satan Lucifer Satan if Crossan was contrary to what God wanted so now what is sin and that was how we came by so we came as dead people do we were strong and working in crying as babies but we're dead in sin and iniquity so Christ comes by the Holy Ghost baptism and come and resurrect us by the voice of resurrection what is that voice voice coming from the ministry speaking the word into creation just like God speak his children from his hat and mouth amen God is an echo echo has got the greatest scene of all the animals or the best and animals and God can speak and his peace his children by the spoken word into creation it's a supernatural creation amen as we are speaking are discrete in sons and daughters Albert a job preaches critten sons and daughters but you cannot see it physically just like Ruth you can take your child children are growing you can buy a post I will not let you sleep for three weeks you will see how to grow your hair is growing you can keep watching it for this and this without even if you don't wanna sleep you never find out it's a mystery in Supernatural the symptom is the Holy Ghost baptism it doesn't come like and now a baby being born but now it's a supernatural creation as we were here there's another dimension that is going on right here but it's a faster dimension as we are here people are going through hell before drinking fornicating smoking is a demon which lives in man the devil and he manifests himself now Christ is here on earth in you and he is manifesting himself by the attribute that is in him now on the system ation there are angels right here the Astrid right here the aspect of God Holy Ghost yet this year is you and I we have got endless right here you've got your guardian angels but if God permit you to see your own garden and you probably you pass out there was a time I was preen when I had it I had a message first one that's a Lord I wanted to see your glory should be your glory I was in college and I was praying I have a tree that I pray and elaborate I said find your own color I like Brittany woods half pleased that I free my house so I was praying and like a like a wind coming it was scary to death I got on my knees and ran away the glory of God is different for the blessings of God you can't come in his blessing you can't dance and shout and rejoice that is Christ in his blessing but when it comes personally to you he in you it is not a joke that's what the professor that they don't even get used to angels because the holiness of the angel is sooo supernatural and so cool in that this earthly man which has what blast system is not meant to encounter it so it is got Greece to encounter it i'ma buy in my room San Antonio I was praying one time I have I pray my closet I pray my kitchen I have different before my bedroom please that I pray so I was praying my back just in a bed a bathroom me before my before Mike a sink and I saw like a being around me you could see the frequency vibration right here somebody standing there yes I was the only person pray there was nobody in my house but I could see this man right here in the in another dimension yes I could see the present so holy and so fearful I back off some went out from the bathroom to the living room then came back on 2 to 3 it is not a joke so crisis in you but he also break himself in a form that you can take it when you are sleeping the Holy Ghost doesn't go to sleep he's waking heal sickness who doesn't be manifesting a symptom that's how much he loves you some signals can come in a symptom and you Pro Lord bring prayer requests but some things you don't mean see the sickness the takes it away certain attacks the law doesn't let you see it the devil could have taken your life in the night but as angel of the Lord there's a pillar of fire in you that's said this is my child seat and you cannot touch him until I'm done with you he loves you and I get sensitive to that presence the more we see the glory of God in our life that's why we pray and fast that when you free Yousef read this guy here so that the one on the inside can have the preeminence glory hallelujah he's here God is not many up is not in thousands of miles away no he's right here in this dimension one time I was driving I remember in San Antonio and I liked singing I don't have a good voice but I like to sing so I was making a little noise on to the Lord and I was at traffic so I stopped red light and it's like somebody push my foot on the bricks and I was wondering what's going on here little did I know that I didn't completely stop a break so my vicar was moving slowly you could have hidden this vehicle but it's the one who lives he that is in you I knew what this guy didn't know so he pushed my left foot or what to start a brick and I said Lord how loving you are that is how much he loves me sometime I don't think that is with you you might know everything is in you you might think oh look at my problem that's what your mind tells me yeah look at all these problems before me in my family in mind this in this but when he that is in you when he appears that he loves you see you amen [Music] [Applause] blessed be the Lord remain now back to our topic the true is that the Easter we had 2,000 years of Easter 2,000 years but Jesus Christ our Father our our elder brother the firstfruits who resurrected who said I've got power to live and live my life down and I've got part to pick it up back amen when he died his body was on a cross one person his soul was in hell judging the sinners and unbelief who didn't believe their prophet in the terms of Adam in the in the other times up to Jesus the Lord was judging those who's now his spirit was in heaven wasn't was in heaven judging the universe controlling the universe one person his flesh was on on earth his soul was in hell and his pit was in heaven I'm the son of man who lives on earth and live in heaven at the same time so you yes you're his body was dead as dead could be but in Christ God cannot die he only died in the flesh that's why the Bible teaches the Christians do not die in the flesh years in this dimension we cry we lose our loved ones and we cry be sure we go through peace but in the other dimension there's another man in you that does not die his antenna is right here amen when his brother Brahms wife sister Bella's mom died and she was true friend crying of course she didn't see their mom she was thinking oh I see a Sunday in glory but her mom was standing right there watching her own cups they made system it up sister Hooper Browns first wife died everyone was going through painful times could even commit suicide his wife came literally and put his arms around him said bill don't cry keep on preaching the word I'm so happy where I am angels coming to meet me women in white garment best singing trees beautiful and everything good in streets but the Prophet himself didn't you know at that time I didn't have the revelation yet so he was brooding and going through pains but his wife was right there I came in a few funny to comfort him and after he vanished into rainbow and he went back to the blue the element back to the Silesia amen the Lord is right here is you amen and you only believe as what a Troy Taurus is the happy let's have the belief don't doubt don't disbelieve God always believed him what is ABC always believe Christ amen the more you believe God loves your cheerful our cheerfulness he permitted problems to come because he's want to do something so when you see a problem don't look to the problem be like a Elijah Elisha Wenger has he was crying because they were surrounded he was I mean drink elaborate Jeffrey Lewis was like drinking his coffee okay he's going to die it doesn't case Rinka coffee so we do elijah when we've got a miss of a a miss of I mean whatever Philistine standing Aramis you are taking breakfast drinking coffee because you could see beyond amen they could see the unseen you can see pillars of fire he could see few funnies you can see angels around that you were surrounded yes you were started in the natural but as most surrounding in him and around him amen and just by speaker wait it's a lot opened a young man's eyes and the Lord open his eyes and he saw the plots of fire all around them glory hallelujah so on time you know we don't even know how much God loves is one time John Wesley was going to preach and somebody decided to kill him on the street went to hide under a bridge you know they didn't have vehicles they have horses so he was on a courage we are going to preach and this person wanted to kill Wesley Wesley didn't know singing and going this man short tried it issued try several times when we didn't know but then he opened it the Lord open his eyes and he saw a fireball of fire all around John Wesley that is symbol of fire is around you amen William step the ball of fire step then the killer finds them dead when you speak the pillar of fire speaks when you smile the profile smiles when you preach the blow fire preaches when you show your heart a laugh is the pure fire in you showing the love of Christ amen [Music] let's read one one more code here on a spiritual food in due season talking about who you are what is the resurrection right now what is Easter today special food in due season 1965 once paragraph 167 now he's talking about Jesus it's a now if he appeared to us in a physical body look just exactly like Hoffman's head of Christ in 33 at 33 and blood running out of his head and so forth newscast all over him I wouldn't accept it no no no no four times if Jesus you appear physically with the nails cast just like he was crucified on Calvary the way Hoffman had a vision and drew him 3303 1/2 I said I won't believe it no no no four times that is not there is going to be it's a larger now I would accept it no no no no when he comes himself or himself every eye shall see him every ordained priest predicted that I shall see me every tongue shall confess him every tongue of fire those we deplore find mo confessing and as the lightning come from the east onto the West is typed eternity the sunshine from the east and settles in the West the word come from eternity eternity is right here in a higher dimension sometime we use the word above about a demon is in disguise but that dimension is higher so we use the natural language above above look above afternoon here but in Christ's language about means a stronger and a higher more magnificant dimension a more stronger rim it means that is more great greater than this beam that is above that is a higher is that is cometh from the Lightning the Holy Ghost come from the east eternity to the earth into your earth we don't believe in this coding clan we believe God is the way but he embodies himself taking your body and my body and gives you gifts gives me gifts and through those gifts he makes himself known that is a secret food amen now God is that when it comes if it comes to appear here with blood and nice cars I'm not going to take it because that would be Jesus nobody passed through this earth twice no you live on this earth put on cysteine element where are you you die or you Arab shed like you know you done in this dimension you know going to come back and pick another blood so we who believe my ram is coming to come as a human being a divinity ministry who is going to be his mother then God has raised his mother and father and started a father is Indian background then his Irish background is all his region and bring them back and then you have to conceive him again his father has to be a drunkard again no here's what I would know good who like but we don't like to go through that again a purpose if you will around him go through that again no he suffered enough at that it was you wouldn't like to go through that again he's happy why he is now he's right here amen so he wouldn't like to come here in a physical form as a human being but it's a human being in the world in the solution I mentioned he can support on this flesh just I may kiss a neck we are not let me tell you they feel funny and we are not limited to the earth when Jesus was here they wanted to kill him he didn't know didn't had another pocket he just broke his flesh and it moved into the dimension and put him back home that attribute is in you and I amen the rapture fit is in you amen the way that is in you is the rapture Jesus Christ is the rapture amen let's let's read a little bit one here please praise God hallelujah let's read from a ditch h/h book praise God hallelujah the Lord is so wonderful glory be to God is the true Easter Christ in you and I praise be to God right it's a nice position of the seven church edges the Sedition Church age said our confess his name before my father and his angels roko in heaven if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time time will I wait so my change comes thou shall call and our answer thee thou have a desire to the work of thine hands the greased Shepherd presented the Grisha but is calling his sheep by name the creative voice of God is calling them from the dust or changing their atoms even though they have they have not fallen asleep it is a rupture it is a great marriage supper of the Lamb and it's bright Amen is the last we have not fallen asleep doesn't mean you go to bed and fall asleep no dying as you are here in your body the Grisha pit holy goose is calling in sons and daughters from the from the dust what is the does your flesh is a dust your flesh is on at home and changing you're at home where I'm said that when you are born again your body if I born again your body is not the same assassin I was not born again although the same system element but your body has been glorified is becoming a spoken word of God because Christ spooked the body into creation it is not a same body that came from your mother and your father is the same element by goddess who recreates you so that you can live in you Amen God can only be you in your ancestral cases in your incident spirit so goddess I take your lineage and cut you and give you the supernatural DNA that is coming from what the second atom that is Jesus Christ and that is your resurrection amen that is a true Easter now that is the Easter day we are eating on that the resurrection that we are resurrected 2,000 years ago elder brother father Sylvia our all in all Jesus Christ resurrected on Calvary died on Calvary and resurrected for us that will become the firstfruits of the resurrection right now so the Easter and the resurrection now is the spoken word of God Christ in you quicker than your motor body from a simple rested on to a glorified estate that you become Christ working upon the earth man glory hallelujah there's no impossibility in our lives if the third is in you so I'm waiting for the third Pooh it's writing you it manifests what is necessary ordinary man maybe five foot six or something like that he was fast not that time he didn't have it wasn't fat it was maybe a skinny person all your burdens and my bearings were on him so he couldn't eat so much like maybe we can eat but then he was God Almighty he was a hundred percent human being and had a percent man when he was born they had to circumcise him you don't circumcise few funny circumcising my beans he eats food you funny doesn't eat food you funny when he put on flesh amen but he was he preached and he was so tired he was sleeping on the boots just like a bug preach it and he's tired maybe somebody has to drive him and his baby sister Erica we driving him and his fast asleep as a human being now there was a storm that was said is the right time to drown this guy that I've had a little revelation by no match so he knew that there's something in him there's something in this guy he's messing up my kingdom is going to take my kingdom for me so I have to drown him so he created a strong the water have got power over the element of his head so get it a storm from no way they were talking about the pmq I haven't Reviva talking about the way the Lord preached trying to digest the way oh he said this one that was a wonderful could right I never saw it that way and all of a sudden a storm here coming tempestuous tone and protract didn't know what to do or the disciples so they went to shaking the Lord Lord Lord it was just fast asleep Lord don't you care we are perishing so he woke up from sleep as a human being and saw the storm coming he said peace bestow and a storm just destroyed off because he that was in him Jesus Christ was greater and order stone and the same Jesus came into Peter Alba Latroy told us yesterday that Peter was impetus shadow Peter was a human being by the pillar of other people's faith and below firing Peter was the one that was doing the healing and the simple of fighting you and when it becomes necessary you come out of you and do what he needs to do one time 2014 if I remember I went to Mexico to preach and I didn't know much Spanish by then I think the last time I went they made me to preach in Spanish for like 30 minutes so they asked me to preach their brother said he had a lot of Twitter father said brother preaches English the Lord the Holy Ghost cannabis understand in Spanish but I didn't have that faith that he had so I didn't so there was a younger brother who was my friend about 18 19 year old boy so he loved the Word of God whenever I go he was already at the bus stop waiting for me he comes and take the Word of God so we asked him to preach his called Israel he preached wonderful same one and after preaching the past experience invite us to their home to go and eat it's in our sitting opposite him and something was going on I didn't see this boy fell down and a pastor saw it was the pastor quickly pick him up

they come and check him up the past and his nephew went with him to the hospital they came back 30 minutes what answers there's nothing wrong with him so when the Lord does something it doesn't be on [Applause] permitted the ambulance to go and check him at the hospital does absolutely nothing so they call him he was very close to me they call his parents and they came he said we have three sons he's a the first one is Santiago with his James and Israel Israel and who is the last three boys but we knew the hand of God is upon Israel and the devil were to take Islamic God is with him depress sang a song and the boy asked me something like that I was laughing I always remember life is a brother prefer prefer before a wife I said brother you died when I gonna watch you die on us anymore okay I'll prefer why for you and it was damn serious crying and you came back and asked for a wife and last year he got my bride I want to come for a wedding he's married and is living right now our Lord said Living God even he can do whatever he wants to do for you there's no limitation keep praying keep believing and the power is in you there's a man in you that you cannot see with this eyes if I don't touch you operate you he's not going to find nothing if all my software doctor to operate me not going to see any spirit this will see materials but then there's somebody in another dimension that is a Christ in you he's right there and the more you you it just like food when you do a little baby a child is born you give him milk if you couldn't put on weight we're gonna cry begin to do things you might be into the movie if we take away and we pretty fast we hear the tips we listen now that is what it's you funny the Holy Ghost feed upon it doesn't feed upon the food away the rice and and and the natural food is filled up on the celestial weight so the more you feed upon the word the more we pray and fast even in our private life amen is my friend and our prayer our pray fast doesn't it doesn't end after the [Music] 2051 be fastened and give us a quickening power both as change and as individuals that you take that anointing but where you are so when you get back you who find your choice at it I like it said fine your comfort comfort zone where you come free if it's in your closet if it's in the bush if isn't your car if it's within you if it's on your bed if it's on your knees find where the Lord is with you because that blesses is beyond what you can contain and when you keep praying it's gonna break to various things that you couldn't overcome yesterday today is going to be so easy for you that's that is our Easter now amen when I came to a message that even understand what is divine healing I didn't know what it is but the first thought it was pretty to me there's something in me said wow there's going to be my life for my time because I didn't like medicine until I take medication so I begin to believe it and before I realised I could believe for my own healing when I was sick just give me my Bible my checkbook give me a CD give me something I can read I don't care what kind of sickness I read them believed and a lot human and one day in Connecticut one brother asked me that there's a lady who he pretty study about the five comings of Elijah is that brother let's go ed he's the lady went to Bible school so she was giving me some questions I could understand let's go and helped me out we went and we explained the five comments of Elijah to the lady after she broke into tears she was an african-american lady she said I've got cancer and the cancer still eating into my wound and all my chest I had a tumor like four years ago and they wanted to treat me with chemo but I refused to me because chemo kills you faster than the cancer so I didn't accept it I was trusting the Lord to heal me she was a Pentecostal lady and said that the cancer has gone beyond out of proportion and it was life and then she has only one son brother the moment she told me that just like her life was on my hands so the brother that took me is a white brother I said brother Dominic let's pray we pray a simple prayer pre pre pre for like 50 minutes and as if I've never eaten in my life before I was sooo so I mean we and as a brother I pray us a lot if it's your wall just like you took two more from system either take the cancer from the lady so we pray for her and we ask her one condition she was wearing pants and we ask it I the Lord heal you are you gonna stop wearing pants she said I didn't love it to begin with but my friends push me to do that she was I think around she was about 57 something like that my friends told me that when I wear pants I'm gonna be I'll be more pretty or some black dancer that I wasn't raised that way my mom didn't read me that way and I said a lot if you believe it it would be according to your weight is that I've never put it on again so we pray for and she said you know you could operator in University of New Haven invest over you another year Hospital Cancer Center so she asked us that we should visit she thought she wasn't gonna make it so she said well if I don't make it she told her brother how things will go and so we visited the I think on the Tuesday she had a surgery on Monday we went we call it and this the husband told us there's nobody like that she's got Enola Walker I said well don't let's go has done something we went it does that go to today elevator go choo god bless brother Jack I love the numbers when he was given the numbers yesterday where his grandson or granddaughter I was born so he said go to the eighth floor East she's the epidemic listen eat before you go let's make some analysis here the it is an amorphous tennety it is a new beginning it is healing it is joy and peace and blessing its eternity that's where the Sun shines I believe that son of God I shall open the lid we went and she was in bed said there was no cancer so what they said the cancer has been there for four years tomorrow and now it's growing out of proportion he said there was an Indian doctor who didn't believe in God and I testified swear there was God said oh there's no there's no God she said when she went of course they put her to they were Indians and they couldn't see the cancer they put in machines they tried it from a CD when he located so they said what maybe just believe me detective so they went I had to open her up when they did there was not even a trace of cancer [Applause] they sue here up and later when he came out of what you call it a necessity to the wall we can understand we can explain but for some reason the cancer is not day she says she jump out on the bed and prison the Lord running out a hospital telling everybody in the doctors came and grabbed her that you are not strong enough to be jumping around so we went and Anessa you can do whatever I can give you all that time like we give the nest the nest the nest a message book a message a piece of message and we sank take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there so the creative power is in you my sister my brother whatever you need is already in you so then why do I go through challenges the Lord put a circumstances there is not only the devil the Lord is using the devil to create a circumstance to glorify you him in you amen so the challenges that can be for you the Lord permitted for a purpose so that he'll be glorified without a challenges or the attribute in you not come out but the challenges led attributes the divine attribute that the Lord put in you before the foundation award to come out out of you into manifestation that is our Easter amen that is what we are doing that we are our resurrection right now the Lord has brought it upon the graveyard of sin 2,000 years old the Lord did his portion my brother Troy preaches the day I was and join his preaching then when he ended I said let's pray for a quick two or two more so Wow he

was just preaching there tonight I was thinking about the sermon that he shared with us once before how you can't take your your phone charger to the FPL power plant and try to plug it in you know to the big power plant so you go out there and try to plug that you'll you'll get fried and it's if you didn't even if you try to touch one of the Transformers out here you want to take it I'm gonna just plug in and get some power and get this thing charged you'll get fried and they say what happens is that they have to step it down they have to keep stepping it down in order to this that that better electricity is so powerful that if they didn't step it down amen it would just do damage to you and I just love the way that you know the Lord use them because you constantly have to just step it down step it down step it down so make sure the people catch him what he's trying to say you know and just just God as God is good god is good god is God is real good I was just blessed by that Easter is not like he said is you know how people taking crosses and putting them on their backs and some acting out the crucifixion but they're missing that jesus is alive and doing the very same thing he did when he was on earth and then Easter has a lot to do with us today the truth Easter true Easter is when you begin to see yourself in the word right they may you begin to see your place so we thank God for this Amen tonight let's give the Lord another hand of praise see ah [Music] what I decree cuz I believe it belongs to me don't say that again I said our showerhead [Music] when I decree [Music]

atmosphere so I'm gone come on give the Lord a hand a breeze [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] father we are grateful for the word of the Lord just come to our hearts understanding what the true Easter is all about it's not just the event that happened some 2,000 years ago but oh god it's it's fresh it's a living amen even today and when we think about the Prophet told us that a resurrection a man is not a replacement but it's the very same thing that went down came up again and the reason that we can declare that you are living because we see you manifested in our hearts and in our lives
