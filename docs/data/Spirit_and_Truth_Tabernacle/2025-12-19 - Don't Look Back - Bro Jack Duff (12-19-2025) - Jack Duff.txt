Uh I know he got something that he'd like to sing for us. He'd be posting stuff by singing. So, Amen. Yeah, he got a song. Okay. Praise the Lord. Huh? Okay, no problem. I'm just messing with y'all. Y'all y'all can be uh appreciate y'all so much. Thank y'all. Amen. For your service on tonight. Appreciate Brother Maris. And I heard I believe it was Sister Linda. Was that Sister Linda? Thank you, Sister Linda. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Um I um when I heard about the youth service, I was just kind of debating some things. I know I got a lot of ministers here uh in the church and uh I just kind of settled in my spirit that you know what sometimes I need to preach the youth service and uh and I decided that I would do that tonight uh just to be an encouragement to our young people. Well, I want to say that I thank God for all of our young people. Amen. I I thank God for each of them. Amen. Truly. Um you know, I know it's not easy. Um you know, we live in a a world where it's not easy being a young person. uh there's so much that they they have to go through and and we have to you know uh be patient with them just kind of work with them uh through some of the things brother Brandham said uh in his day said I think his children it would be 10 times worse in their in his children's day than what it be in his day. So you can imagine it's multiplied even more uh even now so much uh temptation so much they have to fight uh but I will tell you that the uh the same thing that we use to overcome uh is the exact same thing that you have to use to overcome and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. It will give you strength. It'll give you power to say no to the devil. Amen. He He's an inside keeper. And if and and he if he can keep your inside, then your outside will also be kept. Amen. But you have to let him come in. When the song writer say, "Won't you let him in?" And they used to sing it like say, "Heist up your window." That means let up your window. Open up your door and won't you let the Lord in. Amen. Praise the Lord. We thank God for all things. Let us uh read a a scripture here. Um you know, let me There's I have I usually have a little timer, but I realized that my lap my iPad was running out of juice, so I brought my laptop and I don't have my timer. Uh but my my objective tonight was to try to preach a little shorter for the young people. Uh if I can. Uh but let's just we'll we'll do the best we can. Uh 8:00. All right. Let's look at Philippians 3 uh verse 10-14. Amen. The scripture reads, "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained. I either were already perfect, but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, uh, and reaching forth unto those things which are before. I press toward the mark uh for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. Uh let us uh just bow in a word of prayer. Father, we are grateful for the ability to read the word, but we trust now that the Holy Spirit will come and help us to apply uh what we've read. May it um speak to us in our situations and circumstances uh as God we just endure daily. So bless Lord our time together here tonight. Take control over every thought presented and every thought received. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Uh praise the Lord. Uh we want to just use for our title on tonight. Don't look back. Amen. Don't look back. Amen. And as we uh just reading here from uh the Apostle Paul as he's writing a letter to uh the Philippian church, he uses the language there in verse 13. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and um uh and reaching uh forth unto the things which are before. When we think about Paul writing something like this, uh certainly he was a man in the Bible uh that would need to forget things that were behind him. Amen. Because Paul was a man that had actually persecuted the Christians. Uh he was um you know he was he was one that uh you know he he was happy to go and put somebody to death uh if they call themsel a Christian which you know just just understanding that uh young people I need you to realize that uh being a Christian is not supposed to be an easy life. Amen. Being a Christian uh does not mean that you won't be uh picked at and criticized and uh you know uh made fun of. Actually when you become a Christian these things uh the normal part journey uh where you'll see people that will differ with you and they'll persecute you. They uh they they'll they'll do all kind of things. They'll they'll they'll they'll they'll um you know do anything to try to discourage you from walking with God. And it's it's very important that you understand that is part of the journey. And you must uh guard yourself. You must prepare yourself, prepare your mind for the battle that you will endure on a day-to-day basis. Every time my sister step out in skirts, they become a target, you know, for criticism. Uh every time the brothers show up on the basketball court with long pants rather than short pants, they they become a target for criticism, right? And and people have all kind of questions and and here, you know, I am in my 50s and I just went out to play golf just a few weeks ago. Actually, I think it was last week and one of the guys asked me says, "Jack, do you ever wear shorts?" I say, "No, I don't." He says, "You never said, "No, I don't. I don't I don't wear shorts." He I said, "It's a part of my faith. I don't do it." He said, "Oh, okay. Well, I get it." He had never seen me do it for years. I've been around him. He never seen me do it. So, he was wondering why I didn't do it. it's a part of my faith. That's I just don't believe in doing those things. Right? So, so at no matter what age you are, you're going to have to go through things where you have to explain that this is what I believe. And if they keep asking questions, you can tell them why you believe what you believe. Right. But but but being a Christian, it's a target on our back. Amen. It it's it's it's something that we have to prepare ourselves. Amen. Uh for for everything that comes with it. But uh but there's a great reward also on the other side when you endure these things. Hallelujah. Praise God. But Paul was one when we look at scripture. Amen. When when he was one that persecuted the Christians, he he he he was the one that wanted to put them to death. So when he comes and he says, "I have to forget the things that are in my past." And and what I want to tell you as young people, you're going to make mistakes in life. You're going to do things that Amen. that that might that might make the pastor disappointed in you. You'll do things that might make your parents disappointed in you. You'll do things that might make some of your friends disappointing you. But you have to come to a spot in your own journey where you forget the things that are in your past. Hallelujah. And then it tells us to press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God which is in Christ Jesus. Now I need you to understand something about a press. That means it won't be easy. &gt;&gt; You gonna have to put some work in. You You're gonna have to put some determination. Amen. And and I want to say it like this. You gonna have to have a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you have a madeup mind, no matter what anybody say, they can't dissuade you. They can't persuade you. They can't discourage you. They can't do anything because you got a madeup mind that you're going to serve God. One person say, "FOR GOD I LIVE AND FOR GOD I WILL DIE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For the young people, I want to encourage you. You have to have a madeup mind. Christianity is a press. It's not an easy life. Luke 16:16 actually tells us this. Says, "The law and the prophets were until John, but since that time, the kingdom of God uh suffereth violence." Uh I'm I'm sorry. The kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it. So when the kingdom of God is preached, but every man has to press into the kingdom. It's very important that we understand it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be a cakewalk. It's not going to be a picnic. Amen. You have to press into the kingdom. Hallelujah. You're going to have to have something that you have overcome. And the reason you got to have something that you have overcome is because on the other end of all this pressing, the Lord Jesus will be standing there say, "Blessed is he that hath overcome." Right? Not not him that pushed it that got pushed through or pulled through, but he that actually overcame something. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You gonna have to overcome drugs in your day. You have to overcome drinking in your day. And and I mean you even you even see that you know you don't just uh my I hate to say it like this but you know overcoming drinking even amongst message believers. &gt;&gt; Huh? I mean it's one thing to overcome it out there in the world. But when I got people that believe the same thing I believe and they out drinking, I got to overcome THAT TOO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Like like like they used to tell me when I was young, if you had friends and and and sometimes you had bad influences that were friends, they say IF YOUR FRIEND JUMP OFF THE BRIDGE, &gt;&gt; are you going to do the same thing, &gt;&gt; right? You got you you you going to have to take a stand against a friend that's going to jump off the bridge. And you tell, look, IF YOU GOING TO JUMP, THAT'S ON YOU. But I'm going back HOME WHERE I WHERE I come from. Amen. Same thing when it come to drinking and smoking. I DON'T CARE what you do AND WHAT YOUR CHURCH DOES. I AM NOT DOING THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's important that you press. &gt;&gt; I I I I love I love Amen. I just love the way uh you know, Paul puts this and and and as we're approaching this end of the year, preparing for a new year, I simply want to encourage the young people, forget the things that are in the past. uh for forget the things that are in the past. Put put it behind you. Don't don't look back. Amen. At those things. Reach forth to the things which are before you. And God has so much more before you. And and I have to tell you like this. If you're still here tonight, that means you got victory over the devil. &gt;&gt; You overcame this year. You You overcame this year. Hallelujah. There was a lot you went through this year, but you you overcame. You're here. So, so I want you to just just forget about the past. Amen. And press towards the future and what God has before you. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's let's let's um um I need to change mics. Okay. Praise the Lord. All right. Let me just read a a a quote here out of questions and answers part two. Uh brother Brandham makes a statement. It says now Christian don't do that. It says uh a Christian don't try to be what he used to be. He's not looking where he's been. He's looking where he's going. See? See? Don't pay no attention to what you was then. You done lived that out. So uh what what all the other time before uh uh to December 19th, you done lived that out. Ain't no sense in trying to go back and get that. That's gone, right? You done lived that out. He he says you'll never return to it that's in the past. He says and any man that drives life's road looking through a rearview mirror will go to wreck. Right? He says and so will you on this on this Christian road. Don't look back what you was. Look what you're going to be. Paul said forgetting those things which are in the past. I press towards the mark of the high calling. Now I I I I I I I mentioned earlier you got to prepare yourself for rejection as a Christian. You got to prepare yourself for rejection. You got to prepare yourself for suffering. You got to prepare yourself for losing friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it comes with the territory. Uh because what happens is as you as you begin to walk in light, you begin to show up the darkness in your friends. And those friends that don't want to walk in light, they will walk away from you. So, so it's it's it's a part of the journey. Amen. When you become a believer in Christ, however, I will tell you this is that when you when you when you when you when you allow God to remove bad influences from your life, God will always send somebody else into your life that would be a good influence. Amen. Somebody can strengthen you and encourage you. Somebody that will pray with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I'll tell you this much. If you're looking to do dirt, God g I mean, not God, but Satan will align you with people in the church to do dirt with. &gt;&gt; But if you really want to be right with God, &gt;&gt; if you really want to serve God with all of your heart and you will take a stand for Christ, God will give you friends that will also support you in that manner. And let me tell you, sometimes your friends are not limited to the people that you see. Amen. On a everyday basis or every week basis when you come to church, God will give you friends all around the world. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FOLLOWERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE THAT WILL PRAY WITH YOU. PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN CONFIDE IN AND THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. PEOPLE THAT WILL ADVISE YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS. GOD WILL PUT PEOPLE LIKE THAT in your life. &gt;&gt; People that can speak truth into you and people that are not afraid for you to speak truth back into them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must prepare yourself for rejection. You must prepare yourself for suffering. Amen. These are things that you must overcome. And and and and I mentioned it earlier. I'll say it again. To not look back, Amen. is to uh is to have a madeup mind. That's a old time term that we used to we used to use. Young people, do me a favor. Just look at your neighbor. Young people, look at your neighbor. Say, "I got a madeup mind. I got a madeup mind. I got a madeup mind." You know, they used to sing a song, I got my mind made up, &gt;&gt; and I turn back because I want to see my Jesus someday. &gt;&gt; I got my &gt;&gt; Yep. And I won't turn back because I won't see my Jesus. Now to some it's just a song but but from my day that was those are words that we actually meant &gt;&gt; from our heart. I got my mind made up and I won't turn back. I I ain't going back to the things God delivered me from. Right. And then then then they would change the song and and and it was they would combine these songs and make a whole medley out of it. I mean Donna Donnie Mccclurken did it first, but then they say goodbye world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't let that just be words coming out of your mouth. Let it be truly, Amen. Uh something that happens in your life. Goodbye, world. I stay no longer with you. I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO GOD'S WAY THE REST OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's got to be your testimony. &gt;&gt; That's got to be your conviction. When we talk about having a madeup mind, I I I I just put it, you know, in in a Google search. What does it mean to have a madeup mind in the Bible? And uh AI always wants to speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And AI an overview uh gave it back to it says in the Bible having a madeup mind means a firm settled decision to follow God. &gt;&gt; And it's characterized by an unwavering trust that no matter what direction God takes my life, he's got everything under control. Amen. And it's an unwavering trust in God. It's a commitment to obedience. Amen. And that's following the word of God. So whatever God's word tells me to do, I'm going to obey that and follow it. Amen. To the best of my ability. So a madeup mind is having a commitment to obedience. Another thing that it is is to prioritize spiritual truth over worldly desires. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so, SO IF I DESIRE SOMETHING BUT IT'S AGAINST GOD'S WORD, then I got to I GOT TO FORSAKE MY DESIRE AND follow God's word. &gt;&gt; See, that's the pressing part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says often uh and and say we can it's often seen in figures like Daniel and exemplified by Jesus resolving Gethsemane contrasting with instability which means double-mindedness, right? We don't want to have that or anxiety and involving a conscious choice to set your focus on the spirit rather than the flesh. It's a conscious choice that I'm going to set my focus on what God wants me to do rather than what my flesh wants me to do. It's about resolve to have a madeup mind. It's about to a resolve to serve God, a resolve to stand for Christ, a resolve to face hardship, and a resolve to reject sin. That's what it means to have a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I thought of a story of um that was written uh there was a song entitled I have decided to follow Jesus. And um the way that this song was actually written because there was a man that had a madeup mind. uh what what had happened a missionary had come to his village and in India and this gentleman a man uh by the name of um Knox Singh uh he was in the village and a missionary a Welsh missionary come to the village and start preaching about Christianity and this man Knox Singh and his family uh in the village decided that they wanted to follow Christ they had a madeup mind that they wanted to follow Christ now now you you you know uh young people when you all make a decision and you you whether you go to an altar, whether you do it in in at, you know, at home or whether you do it, you know, when I when I made my decision to follow Christ, I was in the parking lot of a grocery store. I wasn't even at the church, but I was in the parking lot of a grocery store and I made up my mind. I I'm I'm not this is from here I'm going forward. I'm serving God. I asked the Lord Jesus into my heart and and I can take you to the spot to the place where it happened for me. Everybody ought to have their own personal testimony where they know exactly where they surrendered to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; They know where they gave up their heart. Amen. And and complete surrender to the Lord Jesus. There was many times I went to an alt at church, but you know it did not stick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there was a time where I I knew that when that lady witnessed to me that night at the grocery store, I said, "Okay, tonight is the night that I'm giving my heart to the Lord." And she's the one told me, "You don't have to wait till you go to church to give to give your heart to the Lord. can do it right here in this parking lot. And I took that lady at her word. First, she asked me, "Do you want to give your heart to the Lord right now?" I said, "No, ma'am. I don't want to do it right now." And she went on about her way, but she planted a seed in my heart that I could not get away from it. And before the end of that night, I gave my heart to the Lord right there in that parking lot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but you know we all have moments like that where we where we we we we settle in our hearts. We settle in our mind. We settle in our spirit. We settle in our soul. From this day forward I'm going on with God. So you know this man uh come to this spot. He heard about Christianity and you know him and his family decided you know what we going to convert to Christianity. Whatever their faith was uh they moved from that. Maybe maybe it was a Muslim faith but they moved from that. They moved to Christianity. Now, for us, when we do things like this, it may seem simple to go to an altar or or or to go to one of the youth meetings and and God do something. But for this man, when it when when he accepted Christ as savior and his family accepted Christ, that that was like a death sentence to them. They knew what this meant. But no, no matter what the consequences were, they were determined that they were going to serve God from from a from from from some some sermons they heard a missionary preach. Now, this man, Nox Singh, be to share within the village that, you know what, we're Christians. Begin to tell others in in the in the village. And and when when when the chief of the village heard this, he was upset to hear that somebody in in his village had converted over to Christianity. So, he approached this family and he demanded that they either renounce their faith in Jesus or face death. See, this is this is what I mean to have a madeup mind. So, he had he had to they had to either renounce their faith in Christ or face death. Now, uh when Knoxing heard this, you know, he said, "Well, you know, I'm not going to I'm not I'm not I'm not going back. He he he he quoted the words, I have decided &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus." And it says, um, "No turning back." Hallelujah. Glory to God. When we sing songs like that, we need to understand where it's written from. That man, that man had to give up his life and and we sing the song as if it just means just another song in church. No, a man gave up his life because of his faith in Christ and and him wanted to follow Christ. He truly had a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; The man says, "Uh, I've decided to follow Jesus, no turning back. They uh they told him says, "You know, if you don't if you don't if you don't um if you don't if you don't turn and uh and and and and give up on Christ, we're going to kill your children right here in front of you." Then he he he's he made a statement says, "Though none go with me, &gt;&gt; still I will follow." Now, so he he's the second verse of the song comes out of the experience of the man watching his own children be killed because of his faith, &gt;&gt; right? But this is a man that has a madeup mind. And and as young people, we don't have to go through things this drastic. But yet, we still need to the same type of mindset that this man had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When it comes to OUR CHRISTIANITY, THOUGH NONE GO WITH ME, IF mama don't go with me, still I will follow. IF DADDY DON'T GO WITH ME, still I will follow. If my BROTHERS AND SISTERS DON'T GO with me, STILL I WILL FOLLOW. YOU MUST HAVE a madeup mind. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A MADEUP MIND, YOU CAN'T look back. &gt;&gt; The man says, "Though none go with me, yet still I will follow. His children are dying." Because the chief said, "If you don't denounce Christ, then your children will die." This is his response. though none go with me. Still I will follow. He watched his children die. Well, the chief saw that this still did not change no scene. So, um he uh he he told him says, "All right, um if if if if you won't if you know that you you losing your kids, if that won't change your mind, then what we're going to do is take your wife's life." And when he saw his wife also dying, he says, "No, none go with me." still I will follow. My what a testimony. What a testimony. And finally after all of his family is dead, the the the chief looks at him and says, "You know what? We've killed your children. We've killed your wife and you're still willing to follow Christ." He says, "Okay, now it's time for you to lose your own life." And then he said these words. He says, "The cross &gt;&gt; before me, the world behind me, &gt;&gt; no turning back. &gt;&gt; NO TURNING BACK. UH THE CROSS BEFORE ME, THE WORLD BEHIND ME, no turning back. This man LOST HIS LIFE THAT THAT DAY BECAUSE he had a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; His children died, his wife died, he died. But after all of them died, the chief looked and said a whole family would give up their life for their faith. The whole village converted to Christianity. &gt;&gt; God needs people that will not turn back. &gt;&gt; They needs young people today that have a determination that they will not turn back. No matter what it is that you're facing, no matter what it is that you're going through, don't turn back. You see, you know, there's many examples in scripture where we can see people that think about going back. One of them was uh the children of Israel when God was bringing them out of Egypt and taking them to the promised land. And and here's the here's the problem is that in between Egypt and the promised land is a great trial. Because here's here's what here's what what most of us most of us want. We want to give our life to Jesus and we want the rapture to happen immediately where we ain't got to go through nothing, right? But no, in in between you coming out of Egypt or coming out of the world and then us going into rapture, there's a lot of trials and tribulations in in between all I mean lots of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. But no matter what the trial or tribulation is, we have to have a determination. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I'm not going back. &gt;&gt; I'm not turning back. &gt;&gt; I come too far &gt;&gt; to turn around. And and like like one preacher preached, we have reached a point of no return. &gt;&gt; That's that's the way you have to feel. I I've reached the point of no return. So there's no sense in anybody trying to discourage me from following Christ because I reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; I'm all in. Amen. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they got to a spot in their journey where they begin to, you know, think about, man, we we we're going to the promised land and we've come out of Egypt, going to the promised land, but we ain't made it to the promised land yet. And then, uh, because of all the trials and things that they were going through, amen, in the wilderness, they began to long for the garlic of Egypt again. And and when they're longing for the garlic of Egypt, what they're doing is in their minds, they're already going back. You have to watch and you have to guard your mind because when you start thinking about going back. If your mind is already back there, eventually your body will follow your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you got to guard your mind. You got to cast down every evil thought that the devil will give you. It was not better where you were. It was worse. That's why you came to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. It was it was it was worse back there. Don't ever think it's better where you left from. No, it's it's it's better where you are right now. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel began to long for the garlic of Egypt. They were turning back. Another one that we pick up here and I I want to read this this scripture. Let's turn to Ruth chapter 1 verse 8. Hallelujah. Ruth chapter 1 and verse 8. This is uh an example of it's a contrasting example of someone that that was determined not to look back and another one that decided uh to look back. Verse eight says this. And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, "Go return each to her mother's house. The Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me." And now these daughter-in-laws were married to her sons. Both her sons passed away there in the land of Moab. And now Naomi is on her way back to Israel which is she should have never left Israel in the first place but now she's on her way back and she's u invite first the daughter-in-laws you know they said we're going to go along with you but she said no no no why don't y'all stay here so she's giving them permission to stay. Now verse uh verse 9 says uh the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of uh uh in in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept. And they said unto her, "Surely we will return with thee unto unto thy people." Now, now notice both of them are saying this, but both of them don't mean this. And can I can I just mention something to you young people? Don't say one thing out of your mouth towards God, but not really mean it in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be sincere with God. God knows whether you're sincere or not. Right? Hallelujah. Don't say it because it seems popular to say it, but be sincere with God. Be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be committed to him. Verse 11 says, "And Naomi Naomi said, "Turn again, my daughters. Why will ye go with me? Are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands?" Um uh they may be your husbands. Turn again, my daughters. Go your way, for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have an husband also tonight and should also bear sons, would you tar for them till they were grown? Would you stay for them uh uh stay for them from having husbands? Nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me uh much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me. And they lifted up their voice and wept again. So they're crying again. Now what? Notice this. And Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her. Hallelujah. Now, now, now here's what we here's here's what we got. Because when when Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, that was Orpa saying goodbye. You just gave me a a a free pass and I'm out of here. I'm going back. I'm not obligated to be with you anymore. My husband is gone and I ain't got no obligation. You just released me. I'm going back. goodbye. When she kissed her mother-in-law, it was over for Orpa at that time. &gt;&gt; Now, look at the very next verse, verse 15. Uh, and she said, "Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods, return thou after thy sister-in-law." Now, now in the previous verse, it says Ruth claved to Naomi. We don't know how much and how how tight she might have been holding on to Naomi like, "No, I I I I know Orpa is gone. I know she went back, but I'm going to stay right here next to you, Naomi." Now, you need to understand something. Ruth had no um she she had no no promise of what would be her future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She had she had she had uh uh uh uh she had already had one husband who had already passed. There was no promise that she was going to get married again. There was no promise that she would be accepted when she went to back to Israel with with Orpa. Ruth had nothing. Hallelujah. But the one thing Ruth had, and we're going to read in the scripture, Ruth had a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I'm going tell you, if you can get one of them, A MADEUP MIND, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES to God, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT BLESSINGS MIGHT BE WAITING for you on the other side. But before you GET TO THE BLESSINGS, YOU MUST HAVE A madeup mind. AND THAT MADEUP MIND SAYS, "I WILL NOT be going back." &gt;&gt; We sing the song, I won't go back. &gt;&gt; I won't go back to the way things used to be. See, you got to have a madeup mind before you can say things like that. Otherwise, it's just words in a song. &gt;&gt; But let it be your testimony. &gt;&gt; God, I'm not going back. I thank you for what you've done for me thus far this year, and I'm not going back. I'm looking I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not looking at the things behind me, but I'm pressing forward to what's before me. &gt;&gt; Let's go on and read a little bit more here in the scripture. says, "Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave thee, or return from following after thee. For whether thou goest, I will go, and where thou lodest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Where thou dieest will I die, and there I will be buried, the Lord do so to me, and more also if ought but death part thee and me. Verse 18 says, when she saw that she was steadfastly minded, what is that? A madeup mind. When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. And see, I like that because Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Ruth demonstrated, um, I don't know what's going to happen when I get to Israel. I don't know what's before me, but I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to I'm just going to follow you because I feel like that's what I'm supposed to do. And you know, the beautiful thing about Ruth's decision is that Ruth ended up going, if you read the rest of the book of Ruth, she ended up going there with Naomi and and and she began to work in the fields. and she happened to work in a field of her kinsman redeemer. His name was Boaz. And Boaz had not been married before. So when he saw Ruth come, he's like, "Who who is this young lady that's in the field? What's going on? What's the story behind her?" And they told her how she made a decision to come with Naomi back. And and he was like he was really impressed by her character. &gt;&gt; He's impressed. And you know, we heard that she had another daughter-in-law, but that one took off. But this one stayed right by her mother-in-law's side. She had no promise of nothing. He says, "I tell you what, I I got my eye on this lady." And uh and and and and and as as the story went on, eventually what happened is that uh uh Ruth asked, you know, uh Boaz to perform the the the what a kinsman should perform. And uh he says now in performing that he was going to get everything Naomi uh owned but he's also going to be he have to take Ruth on as a as a wife. And that's exactly want to do what he wanted. He got a gentile wife because this wife was willing to go all the way. Young sisters, young sisters, before God gives you that husband, &gt;&gt; you need a madeup mind &gt;&gt; that I'm going to serve God &gt;&gt; no matter what. What what if God gave you a husband and then your husband got sick and and and couldn't be who you thought he could be? You got to have a madeup mind before God gives you a husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to have a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ruth had a madeup mind before anything. And and God end up blessing her with Boaz. And not just blessing her with Boaz as her husband. Do we if you read the rest of the scripture, you realize that the Lord Jesus Christ came down through this lineage of this story of a sister that had a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your God going to be my God. Where you die, I'm going to die. Where you buried, I'm going to be buried. You know, your people going to be my people. You got to have that kind of mind when it comes to serving God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm in this. I ain't going nowhere. I'm stuck here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, um let me just give you, you know, one other story here and then I'll I'll I'll I'll uh cut it off for tonight. Um there was another uh person in scripture that we'll read that didn't have a madeup mind. And let's let's let's pick this up in in Luke 17 verse 28. All right. Luke 17 and verse 28. It says this. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot. Now, uh before I go further in that, this is why I say young people, we know that you all have it so much harder uh today, especially those that are in public school and and things like that. There what the way it was in the days of Lot, this was a time on earth that God was so upset with the sin of the people. In the center of the people at that time was a lot of uh homosexuality, lesbianism was happening all around. And God was so displeased with what mankind was doing that he came down to destroy the earth himself or at least those that the cities that that that was going on in he came to destroy that himself. Now you need to understand if God came down to destroy Sodom Gomorrah uh because of that sin. Today he have to destroy the entire world &gt;&gt; because that sin it used to be there was only certain cities. People knew that if you went to San Francisco that was one city that that had a lot of that rampant. The Key West is another city like that. Hallelujah. That's why if you go to Key West, Amen. It's probably good that you don't go into the city at night time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to go hang out at a restaurant? It's a lot of spirits all over there. And and and and and what happens when when people know that that's an area that's like that, uh people with those spirits congregate from all over the world to go to that one area and you find yourself wrapped up in something. You wonder how in the world you got here, right? But when it say Jesus said before his return, it was going to be just like it was in the days of Lot, that's the day that we living in right now. That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Homosexual. Homosexuality is everywhere. &gt;&gt; Even in churches. &gt;&gt; Can I Can I go a little further? &gt;&gt; In the pullpit of the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Standing there preaching to people and telling them they don't see no need to get delivered. &gt;&gt; But then want to pray for you to get delivered. You first get delivered before you pray for anybody. &gt;&gt; But but this spirit HAS BEEN ACCEPTED ALL OVER. And this is a THIS IS A SIGN OF THE TIME. WHEN WE SEE THINGS LIKE THIS, we got to get ready for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And this is in order to be ready for the coming of the Lord, you need to have a madeup mind. Politicians do it. Teachers are doing it. I mean, you just people that you would you would look up to, policemen in the military. &gt;&gt; Huh? I mean, the I mean, it's all over us. This is why we need to have a madeup mind. And and it's going to take a madeup mind to say, "No, I think that's wrong." &gt;&gt; And it's not hate speech. &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody make you think that it's hate speech to tell them that that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Homosexuality is wrong. Lesbianism is wrong. Adultery is wrong. &gt;&gt; Uh, all of these things are wrong. &gt;&gt; If you had sex with an animal, that's wrong, too. &gt;&gt; All of that's wrong according to God's Bible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to say these things. is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Go back to Leviticus. You'll see it's all wrong. God outlined it. &gt;&gt; Hey, can I give you another problem that that happened in in that day? Y'all want me to tell you the truth &gt;&gt; or you want me to lie to you? &gt;&gt; You want to know another problem that happened in in Lot's day? Lot &gt;&gt; had relations with their own daughters. &gt;&gt; That's wrong, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They got their daddy drunk and had a relation with their daddy. Both of both daughters came up with this thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me tell you something. He was not that drunk &gt;&gt; that he couldn't say no. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't tell me he was that drunk that he couldn't say no. I can tell you why. Because David got uh Bashibba's husband drunk. Uriah got him really drunk and tried to send HIM HOME TO HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; Uriah said, "Me go home to my wife?" No. where the men out there on the battlefield, no, I'm going to sleep right here in the king's palace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HE HE WAS THAT DRUNK, BUT STILL COULD MAKE A a a determination &gt;&gt; that I'm not going home to my my wife. &gt;&gt; So, Lot was not that drunk. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; These are spirits that fight that people are fighting in today's world. Don't don't tell me I know about it. &gt;&gt; I know about it. I know about it. So look, you go back to Levitical law and speak against a lot of these things. And young people, I'm going to tell you something. You going have to have a madeup mind that you're going to keep yourself. &gt;&gt; I'mma wait on the Lord &gt;&gt; to give me a wife. I'mma wait on the Lord to give me a husband. I ain't going to be running around here with everybody. I'mma just wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. and and and and and I'm going to tell you when you have a madeup mind to serve the Lord, I I remember, you know, Brother Brandham sharing a um story about a might have been brother Perry Green might have shared the story about this sister who had um um uh they went out to Indian reservation and uh they they they prayed for some people and there was a lady there on the Indian reservation and she said, "I'm going to run to the city and I'm going to get myself a husband uh brother Brandham and and she said he said no sister don't don't go to the city. Don't don't go and do that. Just stay right here and God will send you a husband. And she said, "Brother Brandom, if you knew the things that I had done, the life that I had lived, if you knew the things I had done, ain't nobody in this reservation going to marry me." And sometimes, young sisters, you all get to the spot where you feel like, "Well, ain't nobody in the church going to marry me. You want to you want to go out? Don't do that. Just wait on the Lord." He will send you a husband. &gt;&gt; And and the sister say, "No, no, no, no. If you knew the things that I done, ain't nobody going nobody want to marry." He say, "Sister, just trust me when I say if you stay right here, God will send you your husband. &gt;&gt; God will actually bring him to you." &gt;&gt; Right? And he she said, "I don't know." And so, so, so, you know, finally she agreed and she stayed uh and she got the husband, but but one of the brothers uh had asked Brother Brandham said, "Brother Brandom, when she asked the question, if you knew the things that I did, uh you know, what what was it that she did? What I mean, what was that? What was so bad?" cuz they knew that the prophet had the ability to see visions. But brother Random told the brothers said, "Brother, what God put underneath the blood, &gt;&gt; he don't even show his prophets." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, when God what God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness, then you put it in the sea of forgetfulness and you press on towards the mark. Don't don't look back. &gt;&gt; Go forward to what God has for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you sisters, you stay, you stay faithful to God. You have a madeup mind. God will send you your husband. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; That young lady got a husband. God sent her one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, God got You don't know where where your husband might be. This is a big world. &gt;&gt; Don't limit your husband just to West Palm Beach. &gt;&gt; He might not be here in West Palm Beach, but he might have a desire to come to West Palm Beach, &gt;&gt; and he need a way to get here. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Uh verse 28 says, "Likewise also it was in the days of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded." But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, he which be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down or take it away. And he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. And it says this verse 32, remember Lot's wife. The problem that the what we have with Lot's wife is that she looked back. Not just necessarily in with her eyes, but it was with her heart that she looked back. God had made a way for them to come out of what they were in before he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. But Lot, Miss Lot looked back, right? And you don't. And when the scripture say remember her, this lady turned to a pillar of salt because she looked back. Don't look back. And I encourage all my young people, go forward this year. Go forward in all that God has in store for you and don't look back. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. But I I have um um uh let's see here um this this quote out of shalom. It says now about the new year that we're facing. We have we could have more to say on this in between from the darkness to the light. He says the intro introduction of the light coming in between but now we want to get right straight to the new year. says, "New year, new year. What about it? Brings new hope. We're one year closer. We're one day closer than we was yesterday. We're one hour closer than we was when I started. 15 minutes to 11. It's still 15 minutes uh 15 uh till 12. Now we're 1 hour closer. We don't look back. We look forward." See? Oh, yes, sir. New year doesn't mean turning a new page. Uh-uh. No. like the the man one morning uh I was I was hurted. A man got up early and went out and picked up a paper come back and sat down put his feet up on the uh on on the diving put his uh glasses on began to read his paper. His wife out getting breakfast she said John anything new said no same old things just new people. Yeah that's right murders rape and everything somebody else done it. see truth, not turn a new page, is turn to the word, right? See what the word promises for today. See what the light of the day is supposed to be. What we ought to do this year is not go back to creeds and things. Go back to our old denominations. Not go back to old denominations, but turn to the word. See what kind of light is supposed to shine today, old church. Turn to the word. Get back to the word. Flip the right switch. Quit punching around on electric light. see artificial, man-made. Turn to his word and see the promise of today and then see what the promise is and watch for its identification. When it's vindicated, then you know uh whether you're in light or not. See what the promise is. Changing the pages or changing the calendars doesn't change time. A lot of people say, "Well, the old year's gone. Throw away the old December calendar now and put up the the other one, a new year." That's what a new year means to them. to me. I want to see what's promised for the day. I I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it. I want to know where I'm living, what age I'm in, how far up the road I am. As Paul said, I could stand quoting again, forgetting those things that are in the past. Now I press towards the mark, the high calling, the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes. Don't look back. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I was thinking as I was preparing this um sermon, there was a a song that came to my my memory. Um, and it's one of those old songs, but I'll just give you the words. It says, "I started on this journey, many years ago. I've seen a lot of things while traveling to and fro. I've been through the storm. I've been through the rain. And sometimes all I tried to do is seem to be in vain. But one thing I know for sure, I'm going to get my starry crown because I have come this far and I just can't turn around. The things I have to do, you may not understand, but my main concern is that I'm in the master's plan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the second verse would say this, Satan comes around playing with my mind, but I got a job to do. I can't afford to waste my time. He pretends to be my friend. He pretends to be so kind. But see, when I got a madeup mind, I say this, get behind me, Satan, cuz I got heaven on my mind. And it says, you know that I'm I'm going all the way. And I care less of what you may do or say. Oh, I made the Lord a promise if he would lead the way. I told him I'd follow. Oh, and after all that I've been through, I'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go now. Oh, see, I have made up in my mind. Yes, I'm going all the way. Sounds real good. Let's try it again. Oh, you know that I I'm going all the way. Oh, say I care less. I care less of what you may do or say. You see, I made the Lord a promise. I said if he would lead the way, I told him I'd follow. Told him I'd follow. And after all that I've been through. Oh, I'd be a fool to turn it loose and let it all go now. Oh, you see I have made up in my mind. Well, I'm going all the way. Is that just words to somebody tonight or is that your testimony? I'm going all the way. I'm not going to look back. I'm going all the way with Jesus. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Hallelujah. Let us have a word of prayer. Father, we are grateful, oh God, for your word and just want to say something that would be a strength and encouragement to our youth. Um, so much that we have endured throughout this past year. But many of them, Lord, are still still standing. And I'm grateful to see them standing. Lord, I realize that uh they had some trials that they had to overcome and there'll be others as we approach this new year that they'll have to overcome. But oh God, as we uh prepare uh ourselves, fortify ourselves with the word of God. I I pray for each and every one that God you would give them strength and that you would give them a heart that uh is determined to serve you, a mind that is made up, God that they they will not turn back. They they will not go back into the things that uh you have brought them from. Father, I pray that you would just give them that resolve and that God, they we realize that the enemy uh has so much more to to bring against them in this time and in this day. But God, we know you gave us a weapon that is stronger than anything the devil can ever do. And that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, I pray that every heart would be filled with the spirit of God. And that God, you would just make the difference in each and everyone their lives. And Lord um uh uh as they Lord just some facing different decisions that they have to face in life. I pray that you give them direction, instruction, peace in their mind, peace in their walk with you and Lord that you would just bless uh every step that they would take. Let this group of young people be an example to so many others Lord that um Lord that would see them. And Father, I just trust that you would you would help them, Father, in their journey. We commit each one, Father, into your capable hands. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord another hand of praise. Amen. Amen.
