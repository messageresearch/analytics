TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you i want to welcome you to the house of the lord tonight those that are joining us online say god bless you uh just want to open with a word of prayer and then we will read our scripture we are continuing our uh just a little teaching on dreams that we started on last last wednesday and i just want to continue that tonight we've kind of taken a uh just a detour typically we are teaching uh in the book of ephesians but we just wanted to start the year off with this teaching on dreams and then if the lord would allow if we finish it tonight then we'll get back to our teaching on ephesians but let's just bow in a word of prayer as we start this tonight father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to come into the house of god lord our prayers that you would minister to our uh needs tonight that you will speak to us the only way that you can we trust oh god that uh you would use this to bring glory and honor to yourself bless the saints that have gathered bless the saints that have joined us online those that are still on the way god give travel and mercies to and just ask that you would be glorified and magnified and all that happens uh in this place tonight it's in jesus name we pray amen amen uh if you all just stand with me we'll turn and read out of the book of acts chapter two okay uh starting here verse 15 tonight and as i mentioned as we started the year off uh just talking about the seven junctions we preached on the first junction uh at the first of the year this scripture is what brother branham used uh when he preached on uh the junction of time here out of acts 2 and i thought it was very appropriate for you know our discussion on dreams as well so here in acts 2 verse 15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy uh it says and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we will again just continue this teaching i did a part one on this on last week and if you did not get an opportunity to hear that i want to encourage you to go back and just listen to that this is just something to help give guidance to the church as we go forward uh i really believe god uses dreams i believe god just as we read the scripture this is a promise for this day uh but just as we know it's a promise for this day it's also satan it's something that satan can get involved in right and he can create a lot of problems if it's not handled the right way right so our our focus amen and our goal is just to put structure around it uh so that it can be edifying a man not uh not something that's used to destroy but something that's used to edify brother branham made a statement he says gifts are to magnify and i actually i keep forgetting to do that um the other verse i won't read it but i'll just quote it romans 11 29 it tells us that uh for gifts and callings are without repentance right so uh gifts are used to magnify uh to assist in the church gifts are not used to rule the church praise the lord they're not used to rule the church what rules the church is the word of god right so uh we want to make sure that we get that we get that right gifts are used to magnify you know to to just help uh strengthen the church but not to dominate and rule the church uh uh brother branham made a statement says the more simpler you become that's a gifted person the more simply you become the greater you'll become before god that's right don't try to lift yourself up when you do you bring yourself down so anytime anytime a person is trying to lift himself up with a gift they actually bring themselves down uh and they don't a lot of times people don't don't don't catch that um you know the first thing we'll say is that nobody is receiving me no it's you're trying to exalt yourself and when you exalt yourself you actually bring yourself down right praise the lord he says when you do you bring yourself down he that exalts himself shall be abased praise god now i want to uh start with this quote out of church order and i want to make this statement we welcome the gifts at spirit and truth tabernacle we welcome them it's according to the bible we welcome and i'm going to read you a quote where brother branham actually uh makes it very clear that they welcomed it at uh at branham tabernacle so here in this message church order it says now may the lord bless you all uh and i trust that this will be carried out to the very best of your knowledge i'm in paragraph 64 in the in the quote church order it says and may the holy spirit watch over each one of you may every officer of the church feel his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church each one will have to give an account amen for how they hold their office in the church and it says this into the laity amen to the laity and the dear gifted saints that's in our church praise god those who prophesy or speak with tongues or interpret or have revelations so these are gifted saints that can prophesy speak with tongs interpret and also have revelations it says we are just so happy to have you in the service now this is what the prophets say we're just so happy to have you in the services and we will give you full cooperation glory and everything that the holy spirit shall prove that he has said to you now that's a key statement the holy ghost got to prove it amen we give full cooperation when the holy ghost proves it not just somebody proving it themselves but the holy ghost got to prove it amen so he says we'll get we will give you full cooperation everything that the holy spirit shall prove that he has said to you and we love you praise god we love you and we believe that these gifts are in you and if you have a right opportunity and a scripturally presentation of it that you will make great workers in our midst he says and may the lord bless you all is my sincere prayer amen i heard that quote just a couple of weeks ago brother troy read it and and i just thought it was very fitting for you know what we were talking about here tonight i want i want people to know we welcome the gifts but it's just got to be done the right way amen that's that's all that's all now here in deuteronomy 13 uh verse one through three i read this last week just gonna read this really quickly and um and just just give us some scripture foundation as well as you know as what what the prophet said i believe that as we get these things settled amen in the church then we will be strengthened glory to god so here deuteronomy 13 verse 1 says if they arise among you a prophet notice what the bible say or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder so you can be a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and and and i read this last week everybody does not have the the um everybody's not given that ability to be able to dream dreams you know uh sometimes some people have it typically one that dreams dreams is one that sleeps light the one that sleeps um uh heavy they typically don't dream a lot of dreams so everybody everybody uh is not in that category but uh but here we say if they're the scripture says they're if they're arise among your prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or wonder and the sign or the wonder comes to pass right so it's it's vindicated uh so it seems where have he spoken that he's saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them he says thou shalt not hearken even if it's vindicated right uh thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams if they say something it seemed i mean that thing vindicated but it's going against the word hallelujah the the bible tells us moses said don't hearken unto it he says uh he says uh the words of that prophet or that dream of dreams for the lord your god proveth you now that's that's the the the the the beautiful thing i see in the scripture is that god will allow it to come in god would allow it to a man to manifest and look real good but what god is doing is testing you to see whether what you standing with hallelujah are you gonna stand with the word are you gonna stand with a gift amen hallelujah you know uh moses gift got him in trouble oh church moses gift calls him the mr promised land his gift got ahead of the word of god when god told him to uh to speak to the rock he struck it twice he got a manifestation he got water hallelujah but he also did not get the promised land amen so we don't want a gift to get us in trouble with god this thing has got to be kept in line with the word hallelujah thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet or or that dream of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether you love uh whether you love your love your god with all your heart and with all your soul now uh i i put these notes here the dream could be perfectly right but if it leads us away from the words the dream was a test to see whether we would whether we hold to the word or not and i'm gonna just be honest with you i'm gonna just be very clear i will always hold to the word always this is gonna be my absolute what the word of god says right so so i'm not i'm i mean we thank god for supernatural things but the word has got to be first amen amen so look at this now i'm going a little further uh and then the reason i'm the reason i'm holding to the words because the bible says heavens and earth will pass away but my words will remain forever that's why i hold to the word all right if we can just get everybody to put the word above the gift then we will be a blessed and spiritually prosperous church as long as we keep the word above the gift and i need you to understand every dream is not of god every dream is not of god hallelujah so you know i i told you all about the man that you know came to you know the prophet was had to have a talk with him he was running around town uh he left his wife and family in another country he over here running around with uh with another woman um and uh the woman had been married multiple times and brother man i'm saying now uh brother do you know who this woman is yeah yeah i know and he had some dream about you know um uh his wife did something to him in the dream and then he forgave him it's like you know just the same way he said somebody the same way god forgave me i can forgive her brother graham said that sounds mighty good brother but that's off the words they say your dream is off to work now i'ma tell you the reason the man was running with that woman is because of a dream oh lord the reason that man was running with that woman is because of a dream even though the dream was off now can i go a little further with that statement the reason some people run because a woman represent a church the reason some people run with a church is because of a dream and sometimes the dream can be off the word yeah hallelujah i got some things to read i'ma just keep reading uh here um gifts god's gifts always found their places look at what the prophet said in this says very strange here how that god in a lesser way god does speak to people through dreams now this is what he say god's gifts are always found in place god does speak to people through dreams i believe it it says but how that god in this case use a secondary my god says now dream if it's interpreted rightly it is the same as a vision if it's a dream and being interpreted god's used it since way back in the old testament and down through age so god uses dreams we know that right it says he says and promise in the last days to use it again amen it says now people can overeat glory and so forth and get nightmares and it's not real spiritual dreams it don't ring up when you read it amen so that means sometimes somebody get a prophet a dream brother random what you think it is and he's saying in his heart this ain't ringing up glory to god this ain't ringing up hallelujah it says it don't ring up when you read it and some of it might seem right but yet there's real spiritual dreams and we know here at the tabernacle that god gives people dreams and they are interpreted and they come to pass and they're real but i want you to catch this statement from the prophet but it's a secondary way of doing it a dream is a secondary way of god actually getting something to us the primary way that god wants to bring things to his people is through his word a vindicated prophet gives us his word that is god's primary way he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets praise the lord so so it's very important for us to understand that dreams are not supposed to amen dominate or rule or run a church that's that's not that's not the way it's supposed to be and i know you know there's there's uh i know of uh some certain situations where man you could the dreams actually just dominate the church the person gets something uh that they feel like the lord gave and vetted it through nobody vetted it through nobody no no no person with the spirit of discernment heard it they just went right before the church and shut down the whole church with a dream hallelujah things all kind of things begin to change in church because one person stream no that ain't the way we're gonna run things here that's just not gonna be it amen we welcome dreams i i want to make sure it's very clear we welcome just got to come a certain way a certain order and we're trying to establish that order through this teaching now let me go a little further here this is out of the message questions asked questions and answers part two hallelujah i said that that man had the wrong dream about this woman thinking that this woman was um you know was you know he got something from god saying the same way i forgive you you can forgive her brother ram say that sound mighty good brother but it's not in the words it's not in the word and this is thing sometimes sometimes things can sound mighty good but you're trying to see if that thing fit the word now watch this watch this this quote right here this is out of questions and answers says uh brother branham what shall we do there's something that's settled over me that i cannot break through last fall i dreamed i was lost in white sand says it was getting dark i couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now not only did it stay with them now i want you to watch what's happening here in this question it says this dream has stayed with me since last fall now i am as one groping in darkness says my son irvin and wife were included in my dream so this this this lady had a dream she shared it with her son and his wife because they were in the dream glory to god they were in the dream so she decides i'ma share with them and she say i'm groping in darkness now i want you to also understand this lady interpreted her own dream oh lord jesus she interpreted her own dream and uh and when she interpreted by giving the wrong interpretation y'all stay with me here tonight by giving the wrong interpretation it actually impacted her son and impacted the daughter-in-law the wrong interpretation of the dream look at this now it says now they're also in darkness we are in desperation i believe god will show you what is what uh what is in our hearts now uh all right if if we are wrong or sitting in place uh sitting places tell us we want to be right uh messed up over dream for months not just her but her son and the daughter-in-law messed up over this lady's dream and her own interpretation this is why it's important to you know get three uh get three two or three feet with the spirit of discernment to interpret your dream don't try to do it yourself hallelujah glory to god watch this watch it it says i don't know the lady he says but i just i just feel if you hear lady that here is your trouble he says you have let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in white sands represents purity and righteous the lady's dream is that she was in white sand but her incorrect interpretation made her feel she was lost and not only made her feel she was lost she made her son and the daughter-in-law feel that they were lost as well then realized that the dream had a positive meaning see it take a profit to bring this uh bring this up to uh break break break the uh the understanding he says represents purity and righteous and and you're just letting satan good god almighty you're just letting satan put one over on you how did the devil put one over on him through a dream the devil got one over on this lady through a dream hallelujah that's why i say you got to watch this the devil no the devil can use it just like god can use it amen it says he says you just let him satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous look at what the prophets say stop doing it claim your god-given rights that mean take a stand on the word right claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you are in white sand everything's all right it's you oh my goodness it's you yourself nervous amen it says you let one member of the family get nervous look at what they say and it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on glory and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset it's satan then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them rejoice with it so every one of the family try to do that now he goes on says try each one of your children to help your pop and mama mama papa you try to help the children don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you you are christians you are born of the spirit of god you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think about the wrong thing he says and sister i think that's your trouble sister dear i could i could dwell on that a long time but according to what i promised just 20 minutes and i'd like to get just many of these if it ain't put it put it back on the desk and i'll get it again so he interprets this lady's dream tells us that the white sand represented purity and righteousness but because she herself had the wrong interpretation it caused her to have this gloomy spirit and it also brought her abroad it brought her son and the daughter-in-law under that spirit of gloom because she had the wrong interpretation i'll tell you there's some folk that's really messed up today because they had the wrong interpretation of a dream i want to tell you something we're here to try to help people in this hour we don't want to see people hurt in this hour we want to see people helped but the only way we're going to get your help is that we got to bring some type of structure some type of order to it it's got to be that way now now um i can just uh uh plain and tell you i mean just just come out and tell you that brother branham didn't necessarily give a specific way to handle this the bible said that you know back in the old testament they had the urim thumb that they had to go before now who had the urine thummer the priests priests would have the european thunder so basically they had to bring it to the priests amen and they passed through that priest now we don't brother branham say the euro thumbnail today is the word of god amen so when you bring it through the priests not just take off running through the church but bring it to the pastor let me see it and i'm gonna just be honest with you i'm not the only one looking at it it's other folk in this church that's gifted with discernment and as they're looking at i'm assembling a team of people that have the spirit of discernment let them come together pray over that dream that you submit let them pray over that dream and let's see what the lord tell them most people give a dream and they already know what the interpretation is if you already know it why are you submitting it praise the lord right you know but i can tell you this much the reason you want to submit is that you want to make sure your interpretation is right see what god does with people with the gift of discernment now i just want to just mention this i i've been presented with a number of dreams uh i i started working on this topic last year and and i was just kind of waiting on the right time to bring it and i knew that when i brought it it was going to be a very sensitive area this is you know um unless you just praise everybody in their dreams you you you become a a bad guy almost right and unless you just come out and say yeah your dream of the lord yeah you're dreaming of the lord yeah and i can't say that i can't say that i'm reading your quotes from brother branham had people that ran into him with dreams that he couldn't say that that was of god amen and the other thing as a as a pastor trying to uh get the word of god to the people i can't interpret i can't i can't interpret everybody's dream i can't do it right but but i think we can put a structure in place where we can get some of those things addressed now i do want to tell you this as well um some dreams might not get interpreted because god ain't gave nothing to nobody and if god don't give it to nobody you just gotta wait don't try to make nothing out of it hallelujah right but but but you know i i've been called by people not even people in our church you know sometimes people of other churches uh sometimes you know what has happened that you know if i if maybe if i i've walked i've talked to somebody about a dream and maybe the lord showed me something and i will you know i'll share something with them and and it might be right on for that person but then sometimes they share with another person like hey you know talk to brother jack well i get calls from other churches and it's like i appreciate that but uh but i i'm not i'm not for the other churches right i'm here for spirit and truth tabernacle you know if we're fellowshipping around something we just you know just happened to be talking maybe the lord might show something and we'll try to do whatever we can but but here's spirit and truth tabernacle we're just trying to get things established a certain way so that people won't make bad decisions praise god don't won't don't don't let a dream a man over over overtake the word and now you are doing something that you should have never been doing my all right it so i've been presented number dreams lately from various sources some of the people don't even attend our church so i started meditating and praying about how to embrace the gifts uh and also provide an environment that allows the gifts to be effective so what i'm trying to do is create a successful structure amen around of these gifts and um and and the other thing i notice about dreams you know different different ones that i would i would read i would you know uh different people share dreams uh god deals with people uh and dreams on different levels i'ma say that again god deals with people in dreams on different levels just the same way he deals with singers on different levels just the same way he deals with musicians on different levels just the same way he deals with preachers on different levels preachers when they stand up here everybody come from a different angle my god my god some amen like me i like to read a lot of quotes others just preached by inspiration amen but that's the way god built them to be able to present the gospel hallelujah and it's the same way when it come with a dream if you go back and listen to cersei's time brother branham had six dreams and one vision and in them six streams they was coming from from different angles but yet brother branham interpreter said they all mean the same thing glory to god see everybody come from a different angle you got to be able to understand that that's why if you don't understand it and you would judge a dream just like if if it didn't match up the way that you understood it then you just call it wrong it might not be wrong hallelujah you need spiritual people with discernment that can be able to kind of you know uh judge that look at this so i i wrote this down uh services of time was based upon six dreams of one vision each dreamer presented something different but a prophet put it all together now i also want you to know something about a dream if you want it to be um credible if you want to dream to be credible you can't come and tell us you had a dream after something that happened hello church right you can't come after the event that occurred and then you say i had a dream about it if you want to be taken credibly notice before brother branham priest the seals six dreams one vision all that was told before the seals were revealed praise god right the dreams on the vision was told before the event occurred on sunset mountain so the structure here is that it must be told before it occurs and not afterwards if you want it to be credible all right now i want to just kind of i'm taking you know just some some thoughts from the prophet and i'm trying to put it around this amen just uh if i can i'm going to uh go to message questions and answers on the holy ghost and as i as we get this pulled up i just want to say this brother branham established a structure of having gifted people meet an hour before service to share what they heard from the lords in that gathering he says in that gathering there must be three people with the spirit of discernment to confirm whether it is of the lord or not i want you to get that now this is what this what the you know the prophet set up a structure around prophecy and all i'm doing here is taking the structure that he used around prophecy and i'm using the same structure for dreams all right it's going to fit and if we have people that was prophesying a lot we want to use the same structure that the prophet established will see success in the church questions and answers on the holy ghost watch this the prophet says this says now we're going to have a revival and i say amen to that we're going to have a revival now watch this real close now you ministers we're fixing a revival all right or maybe we're just having regular church service the church is on fire it says it should be all the time well maybe we got five or six people that's gifted people one speaks with tongs two or three maybe speaks with uh speaks with tongs four or five with tongues got the gift of tongues speaking in unknown tongues two or three of them can't interpret maybe there's one two or three of them that's got the gifts of wisdom it says all right they all meet those gifted people them gifts are given to you not to play with not to say glory to god i speak with tongues hallelujah you're degrading yourself now that that's that's a very important statement that he makes out of questions and answers on the holy ghost he says you're degrading yourself right when you when you say i got this gift amen uh hallelujah uh glory to god i speak with tongues hallelujah i got when you when you do it that way you actually degrade yourself i want to put it this way when you lift yourself up you actually bring yourself down i'm just saying like that when you lift yourself up you actually bring yourself down hallelujah now i mean the way that a the way the scripture tells that a man's gift will make room for itself that means you never have to do anything to promote yourself you never have to do it people will people will come to you rather than you having to go to the people oh glory to god it's the truth anyhow the truth i mean uh lord knows the lord knows i mean it's just you know uh my my my personal experience is that you know i you don't have to call you know uh and just beg people for you know give me an opportunity you ain't got to do none of that i mean people will call you glory to god people will call you they say no it's a gift in your life brother we want that to go forth do you mind coming to do this people will call you amen hallelujah when you're you're you says uh you're degrading yourself they're given to you to work with and your part in the church should come before the main service starts because the unlearned is going to be among us now he's talking about you know the gift of speaking in tongues and interpreting and all of that but now but we're using this same structure amen even here and when it did when we're dealing with dreams he says then you get off into a room and you sat there you people together because your co-workers in the gospel hallelujah co-workers in the gospel when you got a person that can't co-work you got a problem yeah hallelujah amen one gift does not dominate all the other gifts amen i mean if we get it that way then uh you know it goes back to what paul was saying about the body you know we got all these different parts to the body if uh i mean my my head can be the intelligence and it can guide the body but my head can't pick up nothing my head can't can't walk me around and carry me come on praise the lord it can be the intelligence but i still need some hands right glory to god and on the hand i need some fingers amen on on on my foot i need some toes amen and that need to be connected to a leg it's a i need a i need a knee bone and all this other if i have to bend down that's where the knees come into play i mean the body is still needed so just because i have a head i still need the rest of the body amen hallelujah glory to god right amen otherwise it's a deformed body and it'll never get it'll never get nothing accomplished right all right church glory to god let's go home says then if you get up into the room and you set that your people together because your co-workers in the gospel then you sit there lord is there anything you want us to know tonight speak to us oh heavenly father offering prayer supplications sing songs directly down comes the spirit falls on somebody speaks in tongues one rises up and said thus saith the lord what is it listen go tell brother jones to move away from the place where he's living but tomorrow afternoon there'll be a cyclone sweep through that country and it's gonna take take his house take his goods and get away now that sounds good he says but wait a minute there has to be three men there that's got the spirit of discernment one of them say it was of the lord the the other ones say it was of the lord uh that's two against two or three witnesses all right they write down on a piece of paper that's what the spirit said all right they go back to praying thanking the lord [Music] god give you something you go back to praying and see if the lord want to give you something more yeah that's the way brother branham said when you got people with revelations people with you know um uh the gift of prophecy and speaking in tongues this is the way that they're supposed to conduct themselves just actually sit sit up in a chair don't even get out on your knees sit up and just sit there singing songs praying and just waiting on the lord and don't try to make it up now the other thing you say do this before the service do this now that does not mean that people can't have a you know like a few weeks ago we had somebody speak in tongues uh and then interpretation before that was perfectly fine that was pretty it was after the word of god had gone for i mean everything was in order i felt in that situation now you know i'm saying people that that that do this all the time you know you got the gift of tongues you know you got to get the interpretation if you know that come early praise god come early and i find that people that's not able to subject themselves to what the prophet has actually said something wrong with their gift amen something wrong with the gift all right i want you to remember this the prophet said there must be three people with discernment to confirm whether the prophecy was of the lord or not we're using the same approach with dreams and the interpretation of dreams uh we're using people with the spirit of discernment that can confirm uh confirm or at least give us the interpretation of what that dream is praise the lord now here um uh let me just uh just drop this in another little quote just to confirm that what i just said this is how the message influenced uh paragraph 672. uh brother branham says this we found out that this king uzziah was a shepherd boy in the days of isaiah the prophet isaiah was a prophet prophets are born they just not they just not laying their hands on them and making them prophets they are born for ordained of god now i'm gonna i said this last week and i'll say this again right now uh when people don't want to subject their gift to spirits of discernment the first thing they'll do is claim that their profit now they have to be careful when they claim i'm a prophet the reason they have to be careful because we know what a real prophet is praise the lord we know what a real prophet is so that's why they they won't just come out and say i'm a prophet they won't just use the word that they'll say it like this i mean just be honest i gotta gift what gift come on church i got a gift what gift yeah praise the lord if you say you got a gift to play piano we gonna put you behind the piano praise the lord and see whether you really got a gift if you're just up there banging like the the chip the the chimp or whatever the chimpanzee was banging on sunday amen if you banging like that it's not a gift glory to god church right and maybe you just took a few lessons you might be able to you know help that but but don't claim that you got a gift and really can't identify yeah hallelujah amen it's your gift i got a gift to do this i got you know what is the gift well i'm just waiting on the lord to reveal it to you well what if i tell you god didn't reveal nothing to me do you still have a gift right amen church right so so look we're just trying to bring some order right structure we we accept it we we we i believe you got a gift but it's just got to be done the right way and if you really got to give your subject the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets so here i i as the prophet and priests of the house i'm just trying to establish how we want to do things so so god can be glorified in our midst amen amen brother random says it's um prophets are born they're just not they're just not laying their hands on them and making them profits they are born for ordained of god gifts and calls are without repentance there is a gift of prophecy in the church and it must be judged by three people before the voice should ever be heard amongst the congregation amen can i say that again the prophet gave some structure it must be judged by three people glory to god now that don't mean you go firing three people that you don't told it to but they judging it how i know they got the spirit of discernment they might just be doing that because they don't want to tell you that you're wrong amen but no no you just submit it and then just wait to see what god said about it now against the prophecy in the church and it must be judged by three people before the voice should ever be heard amongst the congregation but that's just a gift of prophecy but a prophet is absolutely ordained with thus saith the lord from childhood up glory to god amen amen and we already know ain't no other uh messengers coming we already know that right so so when you when you go claim around i'm a prophet i'm a prophet you know you mean you got the spirit of prophecy that's what that's what you're really trying to tell us amen i mean you know some people just want titles right i mean you know and they just want you to call them by the title my god i mean i i i don't see so much you just you know you got to have this time you got to be you know uh made something before the people and that's if you're doing it that way you're doing it you're doing it for the wrong reasons amen i was talking to somebody they felt that there was an apostle is that right you know what an apostle does it's not just in the title that you wear you know what apostle does apostle goes and establishes churches establish one here get it up and running and then leave it and then go on to the next city and not just leave it he leave it uh with a structure right right so a pastor can carry on with the people yeah right it says apostle you just don't claim to claim that you're an apostle you ain't established not one church no you can't do that praise the lord now in denomination you can be whatever you want to be but here we're not just giving out titles glory to god we're not giving out flattery of titles amen all right i'm going on a little further so the the structures submit the dream now i'm not saying every dream cause some dreams just pertaining to you and god just wanna deal with you you ain't gotta like brother trevor came up here and had that dream that you know uh uh and he actually he didn't think it was a dream that came from god so he had to rebuke it he had to rebuke everything that come from god right so so some dreams what i'm saying things that might pertain to the church amen and then maybe it's somebody in the church you know something that might contain just submit it and then can i put it this way submit it and commit it once you submit it just leave it alone amen glory to god hallelujah sometimes we might not get interpretation right away and i want to show i want to just tell you we got to wait on the lord on everything submit it and you can submit it by via text by email whatsapp just just get it to me and then i got uh people that i feel that god has given the spirit of discernment i submit it to them we pray over it together and we just see what the lord says about it right but now there's some dreams that may come and there might not be an interpretation and i'm going to read to you a little testimony from brother branham of what happened in his ministry see look uh in pentecost you know they made vote prophesied i saw it happening at a grocery store i'm just what is this we are here shopping and this lady saw this guy that i guess that coming to church said oh man of god man of god went and stopped shopping for groceries went and grabbed his hand said give me a word give me a word give me a word get right there at the grocery store give me a word just making this man prophesy the spirit was not even annoying uh only anointing him to prophesy he just start coming up with something right there on the spot to satisfy this lady people don't even know how this works you don't just you don't walk up to nobody give me a word give me a word like brother brandon say how many can i just tell dream your dream right now no you might be a dreamer but you got to wait for god to give you a dream praise god amen you might be a somebody that has a spirit of prophecy but you got to wait for god to give you a prophecy amen look at this he says uh in the message influence paragraph 105. was that a little girl come to me the other day she may be said and present now she said brother branham i give you a dream now she was upset with the prophet because she had given him a dream he never gave an interpretation he it says brother branham i give you a dream and in this dream i had a certain thing now can you imagine maybe her going to church and hearing him interpret other people's dreams but never interpreting her dream now she began to take an offense like was the gift given to you for you to take an offense or was the gift given to you for you to help magnify the body right look he says uh i get she said uh brother brandon i get i gave you a dream in this dream i had a certain thing i want you to tell me i sat down now if there's any out in here outside of the pentecost room let me excuse myself to you a moment says she said you never told me my dream i said honey just set down just a minute i said your father and mother are very good friends of mine retired farmers who came from a long ways to sojourn with us oh lord help us and and i want to tell y'all if you want to be credible i'm going to say this again submit the dream beforehand what doesn't happen also recently is that people that already made a decision and then they tell me the dream that that helped them make their decision and when i hear that i mean you you didn't want me involved in it you didn't want me involved in it so so you already made your decision before anybody can tell you that i don't know if that's even accurate or not and i'm never gonna if you got a decision that you want to make i'm gonna always say god bless you i will not try to force you to make some other decision especially you tell me the lord told you all right that's what the lord told you and that's what the lord i got nothing i can say about that i won't fight with you i won't argue with it i'ma just let it prove i whether it was god or not and i'ma tell you if it don't prove out that it was god i will not be holding it over your head amen i'm trying to help us so that people don't end up in a bad situation all right all right i'm going a little further he says uh uh let let me uh uh it says honey just sit down a minute say i said your father and mother are very good friends of mine retired farmers who came from a long way long ways to join with us and i said they believed me as a servant of christ you're just a child about 12 years old i think she goes to school with my becky and i said look you're going to meet a lot of things out here honey in the name of christianity you're going to meet a lot of things in the name of christianity i said when you find a man that's got every i want to read it again when you find a man that's got every interpretation just like this what he's saying what he's saying saying he ain't praying about it he ain't there ain't nothing he just as soon as you said it i got the interpretation you better watch that oh lord i can just see it right now i see it right now here i'm setting up a structure and then i can see somebody say they ain't getting no interpretation yet you went to the pastor didn't get no interpretation yet what was your dream and then they got it all right i'm just giving you what the prophet said says when you find a man that's got every interpretation just like this he says god every he says uh and he doing like that just like that somebody got interpreted he says just like that in the name of the lord i say you better you be careful about that that's contrary to the scripture jesus said there was many lepers in the days of elijah but only one was sent to him one many widows in the days of elisha but only one was he sent to many things that jesus did not do many times he says those gimmicks that's got every answer be careful when somebody stands up and speaks in the name of the lord that must be true it must be exactly the truth you might in your mind be impressed i said now honey i believe i can tell you what i think you your dream is but to tell you in the name of the lord no sir because she knows the things i said have i ever spoke to you in the name of the lord but what had happened i said thousands has come and said this and that i said i cannot tell you what your dream is till i set said it over again and then he tells me when i can then i can say the lord told me until then i don't know i don't want to make my own influence in my own opinion i can't say thus saith the lord because that's me thinking it that's the best of my opinion uh we must be sincere because we got the greatest thing in the world the greatest treasure of heaven is christ among us the greatest treasure of heaven is actually having christ in our midst and that's all we want is christ we don't want to see nobody flesh we just want to see jesus you you always i mean quick quick interpretations there's something wrong with that somebody you go to they go you go to them they always got something to say there's a spirit there there's a spirit there because even the prophet didn't handle himself that way and the prophet just even just gave a scripture jesus didn't have himself that way either glory to god so anytime you see that you know there's something wrong with that spirit all right i want to just say a couple more things here ultimately okay no no no let me finish reading that quote it says we must be sincere because we got the greatest thing in the world the greatest treasure of heaven is christ among us why do we want to substitute some little influence to try to make ourselves somebody big among somebody here and that's what happens when a person is giving interpretations all the time what they're trying to do is make themselves bigger he says why not be humble be a humble servant to christ i want to say this ultimately we want to see how the dream compares with the word everything must run through the filter of the word see the lord established the process for us as we have dreamed uh dreamers interpreters of dreams in our midst and i just feel glad to start slow with this and pray about how to expand it over time so this starting slow is submit your dream via text by email whatsapp send it to me you know and and you know i've had people uh and you know uh you know they'll come right into my office i want to tell you a dream the reason i'm actually not to do it that way is because i am taking the dream to somebody else and if you tell it to me uh i actually may forget some of the parts that you're telling me i got a lot of things in my head a lot going on in my head so just by telling me i just i just want to get some okay type it up write it down submit it so i can get it to others praise the lord that's all i'm actually to do right uh uh uh it just makes it so much easier when we follow the process but you know i don't want people to be offended you know because you know you come to me and brother jack didn't take my dream no no you don't understand i i can't do it like that i can't have the whole church busting to my office with dreams and then i sit there trying to interpret that that ain't gonna work that ain't gonna work that that'd just be a you don't want a church like that and you also don't want to be where you just depending on one man in the church you don't want that's why god gives these other gifts to the church let's use what god has given us so the the process or the structure is when you have it submit it don't don't try to interpret it just by yourself because some people do that and they actually have the wrong interpretation but see what happens you don't interpret it by yourself you got the wrong interpretation and you have already made up your mind before you even talk to me i'm telling the truth you already made up your mind so if you don't made up your mind what can i do because if i actually say well i don't think that's in the word now that's gonna look real bad it's just me against you now i don't want to do it that way and if if you want to be taken credible submit it let's get it amongst these people with the spirit of discernment and let's see what the lord say through them and then we get it back to you now if they don't get anything you just gotta wait on god you can't get upset and say damn gave me nothing ain't got the spirit of discernment no maybe your dream didn't mean nothing amen church that may be the reason they ain't got nothing because it didn't mean nothing now because sometimes we want it to mean something oh glory yeah i mean you've been you you you already have a leading to do something or let me put this away you already have a desire to do a particular thing and you're gonna use the dream as something to uh justify and validate and vindicate what you already wanted to do let's let's try that spirit by putting it underneath the spirit of discernment all right send your dream via text email whatsapp and i'm saying only if it's something that deals with the church or something uh somebody in the church you know if it deals with them you know please please give it to us uh i i we have a couple people that will pray over any dreams of significance to see if the lord gives an interpretation and i said the reason why we got a couple people is because the scripture tells us that out of the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now if they these people with the spirit of discernment come back and that thing is not right you know we got they have to actually pray and get that spirit off of them too if a prophet gives a prophecy and that thing ain't right it don't come to pass you gotta pray to get that spirit off of them if a dreamer gives something and ain't right they gotta pray to get that spirit off because the devil is trying to get in the midst of that amen and i want to say this all also if you're really spiritual because that first thing go through people's mind brother jack said he got two or three people i wonder who the two or three people i'm gonna just i'ma just say this i wrote this down in my notes if you spiritual i'm talking about really spiritual you're not worried about who the people are that's praying over it if you're really spiritual if you colonel that's the way you think but if you're spiritual lord i thank you that we got some type of structure here god that we can we can submit these things and get answers from you god i lord use these gifts that's what spiritual people do carnal people trying to figure out who it is that who who well i want if you want to be there let your gift make room for yourself i told you we starting slow to see how this go and then if it goes well then we'll see how the lord adds to it amen hallelujah i put this if you're spiritual you're not worried about who the people are that are praying over this that actually shows your carnality and demonstrate spiritual immaturity i think i want to read just a couple more um things here this is going to come out of god's gifts always finally places this paragraph 37. i told you god uses dreams as a secondary means to speak to his people his primary way was actually speaking through a prophet revealing the word of god to us and here uh in the message god's gifts always finding places brother branham makes this statement says now the reason it was done then is because there was no prophet in the land at that time so joseph had a dream about taking jesus into egypt joseph's dream fit right back with scripture right but there was no prophet that joseph could take the dream you know to and get an interpretation so god had to give it to him and god had to give him you know just give him make it very plain do this joseph right so it says the reason it was dumb is because there was no in the land of time to interpret the dream see there was no prophet to interpret the dreams like joseph daniel and those prophets of old they hadn't had a prophet for 400 years god used a dream for the welfare of his own child god used his dreams for the welfare of his own child he did he told joseph when he was a just man not willing willingly to make her a public example was minded to put away properly no doubt she told him the visit of gabriel and so forth what he had said but when he saw her to be mother it was too unusual you know it was something very different and you know that's the ma that's what's the matter that god does things unusual and it's so unusual even just man can't see it so in joseph's situation god had to use a dream to actually settle joseph's spirit sometimes things happen in the church and god can use the dream to actually settle people's spirit you know you all when we came before we came to this church i was just really i was debating because i knew that you know the cost of us coming we were getting ready to double amount and rent and we weren't doubling the congregation we had the same amount of people you know getting ready to come in here and we're getting ready to pay double amount of rent so i was very concerned about doing this very concerning i was talking over one of the brothers and and one brother told me he says uh brother jack you're the pastor you don't got to make the decision well i i realized that i do understand that i said but i'm just looking for some type of confirmation and also the other thing i'm looking are you with me if i make this decision that that's what i rather i'm with you if you're making that decision i'm standing by your side now that means a lot more than just saying you're the pastor you don't got to make the decision yes i i realized that i was just praying and just waiting and i just wasn't gonna make the decision just just willy-nilly like that you know i just lord just help me help me and uh brother caleb who has this gift of you know prophesying he was there preaching at the other church and he turned to me say brother jack you know you lean in a certain way on a decision god said go forward in that direction he gonna be with you i just bust out crying i said lord that's what i needed to hear and and from that i took that word and strengthened my faith and i come and make the decision and i can look back now 13 years or more i stopped counting i think it's been 13 years god has kept us here not only kept us here but blessed us in a way uh where we were we uh we've been able to meet the needs of this three over three thousand dollar a month uh rent now some people hear that online probably backup yeah about 50 people paying almost 4 000 a month in rent 13 years god has met the needs 13 years hallelujah amen i thank god for you know a word in due season i thank god that god can use somebody to speak just to kind of settle your spirit i believe in i believe in those things and you want to see it going forth the way that god wanted to go forth in the church praise god god can give somebody dreams that the lord just showed me the dream i just want to submit this dream come to help magnify and edify the church can i put up can i can i can i put it this way as well i don't believe god give dreams to come divide the church if you got a dream that's coming to divide the church something wrong god don't do that god don't god don't send it like that to come divide the church you know and i mean i've heard people tell me that there's a black cloud over the church well black cloud you know that and brother branham's ministry you know what that meant death that's what that's what but now they're saying is the black cloud the church gonna fall apart and it hasn't falled apart i don't know when the black cloud left i don't even think it came but god has been strengthening his church and now as we get you know we're stepping into the vision as we're doing that i just want to put some structure around this because i i see how the devil is also using it to bring division gifts are being used to bring division that's the devil that's the devil that's not god hey god i i i let me let me let me uh i'm gonna share something tonight i'm gonna so let me just read this last quote i'm gonna just share something this is uh this out anointed ones at the end time i want to show you how deceiving the devil is one day he was setting in a study talk about martin here upcoming mighty angel crown on his head golden shoes on on on lace around his garments of gold said martin do you know me said i am your lord and savior i'm the one that saved you worship me martin but the prophet knowing there was a little something strange there he kept looking looking at him he said martin i'm your savior jesus christ worship me don't you know me martin martin kept looking at him scripture running through his mind see that he got the filter that thing through the scripture scripture running through his mind he said satan get away from me he said you got a crown on your head and the word of god says his saints will crown him at the end of the age wouldn't that have been a pentecost debate watch the word brother that's where it pays and that's what we're doing we're watching the word amen i'ma say something i don't think i ever said this not and i pray that this i want to say this but i don't i don't want to say it in a way that it hurts anybody that's that's not my intention you know before we started spirit and truth tabernacle i was going through some things spiritually i was in church and even though i was in church and not necessarily agreeing with everything i was going through i stayed faithful i stayed committed to the church even when i didn't agree with everything that was going on in the church i was still there doing song service i never let the people see that there was something wrong i just whatever there was something wrong i tried to take it up with my pastor and him alone talked with him alone nobody else knew just maybe my wife that was it but i kept it from the saints amen so um i remember you know they're they're coming time and like i tell you i don't dream i really don't dream often that's that's i'm a hard sleeper and uh and when i when i go down that's it man somebody can break in my house and they would the the the the whoever was robbing the house they'd have to wake me up and tell me what they was doing because i'd be sleep i'd be knocked out right so um you know i was uh there was one one one morning i was sleeping and i had this dream and then the dream i uh i was in church and you know we were doing what we normally do i was singing a song and something happened in the dream and i just got i just got to the point where i was like i just can't take no more of this i just i'm tired i just can't take no more so when it happened you know the pastor was in a dream and he walked up to me and um and and i just i just just handed him the mic and um so when i did that in the dream physically my telephone started ringing there at my house my telephone start ringing it was actually my pastor calling me from another country and he woke me up out of the dream and i just handed him the mic i say lord i don't know what that's all about but for for me to hand the mic and he the one woke me about the dream i just and i ain't telling what the dream was all right not at that time he calling me i'm guess what i just had a dream no just wait on the lord i didn't tell him i just kept kept doing what i was doing kept doing but then there come a time where i had to sit down and just talk to him about the dream and uh when i talked to him about the dream i said you know this is what happened you know and i i don't know what it all mean but i'm just just sharing with you and we were talking you say i pray i pray that ain't that don't happen brother i pray i don't i don't know i'm just sharing it with you well things begin to continue to progress a certain way and i just got to the point where it's like okay that's that's that's it for me i have to make my decision i have to i have to leave and um and i did i had no idea that we were gonna be starting you know the way we're starting uh now i didn't i i didn't know what was i didn't know what was happening i was just i was completely lost i was i was at a loss but uh when i made my decision all of a sudden two other people come to me one brother come to me say brother jack i had a dream what was your dream he says in the dream we were doing this we was doing that and then the voice of spirit the voice lord told me that brother jackie quit say brother jackie quit brother jackie quit i said what he said he say now i see that since you're not coming to the church anymore now understand what the dream was telling me that you quit coming to the church so well that was i had and i ain't tell him my dream and i now see i could have right you know what the lord showed me i ain't saying nothing to him i just let him share with me then i found out another sister that was coming to the church uh she had a dream about me and she said i was inside the church and all of a sudden i got pushed on the outside of the church when i got pushed on the outside of the church i was pushed down on the ground and i and i got got up off the ground dust myself off and i went trying to force my way back into the church and she said she said but i just saw you got you got put out now jesus got put out of the church it's the word that puts you out i hope you can agree between the lines it's the word that does that so when when when i heard about her dream and i heard the other brother's dream and i had my own dream out of the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and there i could i could i could stand on something i could understand that where i'm at is where god wants me to be at but i didn't just move because i had my own single dream and i moved when i got the dream i waited on the lord i was faithful until god said otherwise and i've seen god bless that all these years even now some of y'all i mean i'm going what 18 years nine 18 years of ministry and i ain't really shared that with everybody i ain't really shared that with everybody but uh you know but but the other thing that i do know is that uh i've been very respectful not only when i left but even now when i go back very respectful i can still work hand in hand with my pastor because i did things the right way praise the lord the church don't let dream we're not going to let dreams not here they're not going to dominate and rule the church there's a system a structure that we're establishing using the same structure that the prophet used for prophecies we're using that same structure somebody have it they submit it let it be discerned and uh and through that discernment then we give an answer if we don't have an answer just keep waiting praise the lord because i can tell you right now that test that that test the spirit of the desert because if they always got an answer now you got to watch them praise the lord so you're actually looking for them to say i ain't got no answer that sometimes you're looking for that amen that's how you know you're in the right place glory to god so church i just want to take this opportunity just to teach get this uh off the uh uh uh kind of out and open at the beginning of the year and if anybody got any questions they can go back to the tape and then pull up the same quotes that i pulled up i gave you the the titles and you know and we get we put it on the screen now you can pull up the same quotes you can read it just see what the prophet said because we are standing on the word amen we're standing on the word praise god god bless you let's just have a word of prayer uh at this time amen and i want to there's a prayer request that i also want to just mention in prayer mr brown says please pray for me as i faced an oral surgery the doctor stated it's a little serious and they need to go into my sinuses pray for god's grace protection mercy and he would got the doctor's hands so i want to do that sister brown when is this supposed to happen in the morning okay uh we will anoint you with oil tonight before you actually have that surgery um also another prayer request here

studying your word together and lord as we um lord just trying to set up a structure here for the church that we can all follow god that you might get glory and honor out of all things we know how the devil can come in and wreak havoc it's only because things are not handled properly god i just pray that the church will be receptive uh to what we're sharing and that they would trust that the holy

there the plague struck the people and i believe 70 000 men died lord uh you got to spot where the death angel was passing through the land of jerusalem but you said that's enough and you stop the hand of the death angel god may you raise amen uh the stop sign again in this hour and stop the plague from going to and fro lord and and wreaking havoc and and all these lies we heard about the church over there in south africa that lost their pastor and then with hours the pastor's son was going to lord from this plague lord we just ask that you just move amen in these families and their lives there's another sister that they sent in requests for lord she had been battling covet seem to be doing well and then today lord just had a heart attack and and god uh just families just going
