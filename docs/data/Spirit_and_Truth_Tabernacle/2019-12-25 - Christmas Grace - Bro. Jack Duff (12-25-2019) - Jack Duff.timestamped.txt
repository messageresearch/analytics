[43:29] publish this is a poem that I wrote
[43:36] three years ago and we did it three
[43:39] years ago and the way the poem came
[43:43] about I was sleep and I woke up saying
[43:46] the words away in a manger in the whole
[43:49] world sits in danger because they pushed
[43:51] me away and kept me in a manger you find
[43:54] they find more pleasure singing about a
[43:58] red nose and of that fictional character
[44:00] with wet clothes that they have no idea
[44:02] of the joy that I came to bring and I
[44:03] was like what did I just say so I just
[44:06] started typing the words out and as more
[44:10] things came to me I just started typing
[44:12] out it came out to a poem and then the
[44:15] more I roll the more it turned into a
[44:17] conversation so sister Rebecca and I did
[44:20] a couple of years ago we decided to do
[44:22] it again we have not really practiced it
[44:31] we haven't really had a lot of
[44:34] opportunity to practice it forgive us if
[44:36] we make mistakes been three years so so

[45:31] you should be getting into me I do how
[45:33] oh I forgot you read a chapter or two
[45:38] from your Sunday only books so I can
[45:40] keep somewhat into perspective what the
[45:42] holiday really means it's tradition
[45:44] exactly how do you expect to celebrate
[45:47] me you're born living dying raising King
[45:50] when you forgot what you're celebrating
[45:52] I mean it's not that I'm not listening

[45:57] the wrapping traveling food one more
[45:59] purchase that's it I'll be through will
[46:02] that be credit or debit credit what
[46:06] declined like your time with me will be
[46:08] if you keep pushing off your eternity
[46:11] saying you'll pay me later all the
[46:13] praise that I'm due now trying to get as
[46:15] close to your limit with me without
[46:16] going over without the swipe decline
[46:20] away in a manger and the whole world
[46:23] shakes in danger as I sit in my anger
[46:26] because you pushed me away and kept me
[46:28] in a manger you sing silent night yet
[46:31] not so silently you all lake italy and
[46:34] wonder what's so and so cut from me
[46:36] surely I don't take it for granted the
[46:38] day you stretch your arms and died for
[46:40] me I celebrate it every day I thank you
[46:42] religiously as the blood drip drip drip
[46:46] down your side you I bled for you you
[46:48] might hung there my time I'm thankful
[46:51] that with my final breath you see of
[46:53] your eternity in a moment then why don't
[46:55] you show it I do I do this time of year
[46:59] I got it all down to a science it is
[47:01] tradition

[47:05] the lines sang all the songs every ding
[47:07] dong ding dong ding dong ding dong of
[47:09] the carol of the bells in the story that
[47:11] that song tells that that well that one
[47:16] doesn't speak of you technically but
[47:17] it's Christmasy so it still counts right
[47:19] I mean I'm not really all like to the
[47:21] mistletoes and here in South Florida
[47:23] Jack Frost is nipping at my nose but I
[47:25] hear it said everywhere I go many times
[47:28] many ways merry Christmas
[47:31] although Xmas is one of the ways but
[47:35] really I promise it's just a paraphrase
[47:37] a way for me to serve me religiously
[47:40] without looking silly to those who don't
[47:42] know my practice Christianity yeah I
[47:45] admit some of those do exist I guess I
[47:47] messed up I guess in the hustle and the
[47:49] bustle of the holiday rush I forgot to
[47:52] mention you to a person or two but they
[47:57] see my long skirts daily they know I
[47:59] serve you I get it you don't get it you
[48:02] think it's about those things but you've
[48:04] forgotten what it really means everyone
[48:07] is rushing around asking Mary did she
[48:09] know but nobody's asking me what it is I
[48:11] came here for peace is in pieces all
[48:15] hell is beginning to break loose and the
[48:17] needs of the Christians are growing weak
[48:19] because no one is speaking to me they're
[48:21] all singing God rest ye merry gentlemen
[48:23] and the only gentleman merry are the
[48:25] ones with the Heineken I know that's not
[48:27] you but it might as well be you find
[48:30] more joy and singing about a red nose
[48:33] and a fat fictional character with red
[48:35] clothes and and you don't have any
[48:37] understanding of the joy to the world
[48:39] that I came to bring I seen about what
[48:43] about you song that sing bring praises
[48:47] to your ears like what Emanuel you sing
[48:51] that one every year it's tradition do

[50:08] certainly thank God thank you all
[50:11] musicians I'm just gonna try to share a
[50:14] quick fault with everyone tonight thank
[50:18] you all so much for being so spontaneous
[50:22] a man in coming to service tonight and I
[50:26] pray that the Lord will bless you richly
[50:29] but I tell you what this is what when we
[50:32] as Christians come to Christmas I mean
[50:34] this is what it's all about us bringing
[50:36] our worship amen adoration to our Lord
[50:39] and Savior we thank God for his birth we
[50:43] thank God for his living we thank God
[50:46] for his death but most of all we thank
[50:48] God for his resurrection the Bible tells
[50:50] us that if there be no resurrection that
[50:52] we are without hope so we thank God for
[50:55] that
[50:56] I want to read two scriptures from you
[51:00] before you tonight and we want to just
[51:02] speak on the subject of Christmas grace
[51:05] a man Christmas grease I will read from
[51:12] Matthew 1 verse 21 and 22 and then also
[51:15] a one
[51:16] take a scripture from 2nd Kings chapter
[51:18] 25 if you would stand with me tonight
[51:20] and we'll just read these two scriptures
[51:24] Matthew 1 verse 21 and 22 says and he
[51:28] shall and she shall bring forth a son
[51:31] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[51:35] he shall save his people from their sins
[51:40] now all this was done that it might be
[51:43] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[51:45] by the Prophet saying let me keep going
[51:48] behold a virgin shall be with child and
[51:50] shall bring forth a son and they shall
[51:53] call his name Emmanuel which being
[51:55] interpreted is God with us let's also
[51:58] turn over here to 2nd Kings chapter 25 a
[52:02] man 2nd Kings chapter 25 praise the Lord
[52:10] starting here verse 27 man somewhat
[52:17] ironic that this story is found in the
[52:20] twenty-fifth chapter of 2nd Kings a man
[52:25] and we know that the Lord Jesus was not
[52:28] born on the 25th day of December but yet
[52:31] the world is celebrating it and I find
[52:34] it ironic that God would put a story
[52:36] like this in the 25th chapter of 2nd
[52:39] Kings and it came to pass in the seven
[52:42] and thirtieth year of the captivity of
[52:45] Jehoiakim king of Judah in the 12th
[52:49] month on the seven and twentieth day of
[52:53] the month that evil married a king of
[52:56] Babylon and the year that he began to
[52:59] reign did lift up the head of Jehoiakim
[53:03] king of Judah out of prison and they
[53:07] spake kindly to him and said his throne
[53:09] above the throne of the kings that were
[53:10] with him in Babylon and changed his
[53:14] prison garments and he did eat bread
[53:17] continually before him all the days of
[53:19] his life and his allowance was a
[53:23] continual allowance given him the king a
[53:27] daily rate for every day
[53:29] all the days of his life in man the Lord
[53:32] at a blessing to reading of his work was
[53:34] just by a brief word of Prayer father we
[53:36] thank you for all that has gone forth
[53:39] tonight Lord and we just pray that you
[53:42] receive it as a sweet sound in your ears
[53:44] we just bring our various gifts and
[53:47] talents and Lord just our even our
[53:50] attention here tonight to focus on you
[53:53] to put things in perspective because you
[53:56] are the reason that we're even here not
[53:59] just for the season you're the reason
[54:00] that we're that we live we breathe and
[54:02] have our being you're the reason Oh God
[54:04] and we thank you for that and as we just
[54:06] enter into the word of the Lord tonight
[54:08] take these scriptures Lord and use them
[54:11] to encourage our hearts and draw us
[54:12] closer to your father's in our prayer in
[54:14] Jesus name we pray a man a man a man you
[54:18] can be seated a man again we just want
[54:21] to take a for our subject tonight
[54:25] Christmas grace Christmas grace just
[54:29] reading a couple statements here from
[54:32] the Prophet I want to read from the
[54:34] message God's wrapped gift a man praise
[54:40] the Lord it says way into East and many
[54:43] hundreds of miles away from there
[54:45] the Magi was already on their Road
[54:47] they'd seen his star was coming to
[54:49] worship god's little gift package that
[54:52] he was sending to the world just a
[54:55] little while from then and the world was
[54:57] going to receive his greatest gift that
[54:59] had ever received a little package
[55:01] wrapped up the little first little
[55:04] Christmas package that was ever wrapped
[55:07] in all the world God wrapped it up I
[55:10] want to break in on my thought and say
[55:12] this the greatest thing was ever wrapped
[55:15] in human flesh was wrapped in it a man
[55:19] God Himself wrapped his own self in a
[55:24] Christmas package and sent it to the
[55:26] world
[55:27] a man Amazon ain't got nothing on this
[55:31] hallelujah hallelujah God Himself
[55:34] wrapped his own
[55:35] so in a Christmas package and sent into
[55:39] the world why did they refuse him why
[55:42] couldn't they see it why did they turn
[55:46] it down why is it that they didn't want
[55:49] it the same reason they don't want it
[55:52] tonight
[55:53] it wasn't handed to them in the custom
[55:57] that they were used to gifts being hand
[56:00] dipped ma they rejected it because it
[56:02] wasn't handed to them and the custom
[56:05] that they were used to gifts being
[56:07] handed that's the reason it's rejected
[56:10] yet tonight is because it's not handed
[56:12] to the people in a custom that they had
[56:15] been used to receiving gifts oh my but
[56:18] God wrapped his own package he's got a
[56:21] right to do it he's the one that's
[56:24] giving it he has a right to wrap it any
[56:27] way he wants to wrap it doesn't make any
[56:29] difference how it is he's got a right to
[56:32] do it because he's the one that's giving
[56:35] the gift and we thank God for the gift
[56:38] that he gave the gift of himself
[56:40] praise God amen amen so now as we just I
[56:45] want to go forward here tonight there's
[56:48] another quote that I want to read it out
[56:49] of surgery would see Jesus this gift
[56:53] that God wrapped they man this gift that
[56:57] god wrapped if a man there there's so
[56:59] many ways that we can take this but one
[57:02] of the gifts that God gave a man to his
[57:05] people when the Lord Jesus was born one
[57:08] of the gifts that he gave was Grace a
[57:10] man one of the one of the gifts that he
[57:12] gave us was Grace and and how grateful
[57:15] we are that we have received that on
[57:17] tonight
[57:18] Amen here in this message sirs we would
[57:20] see Jesus the Prophet says so God did it
[57:24] that way because he said he would he
[57:26] would hide it from the eyes of the wise
[57:29] and prudent and would reveal it to babes
[57:31] such as would learn God is not known by
[57:35] how much education you have Amen God is
[57:38] known by what faith you have see God's
[57:41] not known by
[57:43] science a man neither is he know by any
[57:47] culture glory to God but he's known by
[57:50] faith a man and through grace he
[57:54] projects himself to his belief oh I love
[57:58] that a man it's through grace that he
[58:01] projects himself to the believer it's
[58:04] through an act of grace that God
[58:06] protects himself to the people they man
[58:10] he man we thank God for this Greece he
[58:12] says if we would start to follow him for
[58:14] a little bit then we would know more
[58:17] about what type of person we would look
[58:19] for well we know his birth as we're
[58:22] going to celebrate that soon the Lord
[58:24] willing at Christmastime how he was born
[58:26] in a manger and so forth but then we
[58:28] find out that find out that wasn't just
[58:32] exactly the Christmas story many times
[58:35] if you read the Bible we find out that
[58:37] this Christmas story that I find out
[58:41] this Christmas story have gone to Mary
[58:42] at the manger and a little baby so
[58:44] that's fiction
[58:45] a man so you know brother Branham gives
[58:48] us very clear understanding through
[58:49] Scripture some of the pictures that we
[58:52] might see of the the manger scene would
[58:53] with though the Wiseman there that
[58:56] that's fiction that's not the way things
[58:57] work when we really look at the things
[58:59] that look at things in the Bible he made
[59:02] a made a statement he says when when
[59:05] Jesus was born
[59:06] typically anytime a king is born they
[59:10] always sing to announce the king being
[59:12] born amen it says but I but it came so
[59:15] humble that none of the people knew that
[59:18] a king was being born so God stepped it
[59:20] up a man and not only he didn't have men
[59:24] there to sing at the birth of our Lord
[59:26] and Savior but he had angels come and
[59:28] sing Oh hallelujah amen the king of
[59:32] kings was being born and made flesh amen
[59:35] to die for our sins thank God for that
[59:37] but he was coming and there was a gift
[59:39] that was wrapped there
[59:40] there was a gift of grace that was being
[59:43] given to the people if they could only
[59:45] see it amen grace is free grace is
[59:51] unmerited a man Grace's
[59:54] a man is something that you can never
[59:56] work are good enough but do anything
[59:58] good enough in order to get it from God
[1:00:00] God just gives it to you because he
[1:00:03] loves you
[1:00:04] amen this world was in turmoil this
[1:00:07] world was in a mess but God sent a
[1:00:09] package called grace and he wrapped it
[1:00:12] and he gave it to us and what we need to
[1:00:14] do tonight it's unwrapped this grace
[1:00:16] hallelujah amen we need to unwrap it and
[1:00:20] appreciate it glory to God but here it
[1:00:22] says a grommet now the definition of
[1:00:25] grace says it's the free and unmerited
[1:00:27] favor of God amen as manifested in the
[1:00:30] salvation of sinners and the bestowal of
[1:00:34] blessings praise God a man now I want to
[1:00:38] just take a little time here tonight and
[1:00:41] I'm gonna read a little bit here and
[1:00:42] there but did you know I was just
[1:00:45] reading this scripture and that what we
[1:00:48] read here out of out of second Kings 25
[1:00:53] and you know I've just it just kind of
[1:00:55] struck me here you know just just some
[1:00:57] things here certainly grace is being
[1:00:59] extended to this this individual but I
[1:01:02] want to let me just before we go too far
[1:01:04] in that Scripture I want to just bring a
[1:01:06] quote out of crisis and mystery of God
[1:01:08] revealed hallelujah glory to God the
[1:01:12] Prophet makes a statement it says he and
[1:01:15] that's talking about the Lord Jesus he
[1:01:17] is the principal theme of the entire
[1:01:20] Bible a man he's the principal theme of
[1:01:24] the entire Bible says if you read the
[1:01:27] Bible and don't see Christ in every
[1:01:30] verse of it go back and read it again
[1:01:33] so somehow tonight we got to find Christ
[1:01:37] in the mix of second Kings 25 a man says
[1:01:40] go back and read it and see if you can't
[1:01:42] see Christ and every verse of the Bible
[1:01:45] then you you read it again because you
[1:01:48] missed something the Bible is Christ he
[1:01:51] is the word when you read in the
[1:01:52] beginning God created there is Christ
[1:01:55] and from that to the amen and
[1:01:58] revelations is everywhere testifying of
[1:02:01] Jesus Christ so that's why of these
[1:02:04] added blue stick that they call
[1:02:06] the second book of Daniel and the book
[1:02:08] of the Maccabees and and an agus
[1:02:10] purgatory and stuff like that see it's
[1:02:13] not spoke of in the scripture see it
[1:02:16] doesn't theme up with the rest of it
[1:02:18] there's no place to place purgatory in
[1:02:20] there there is no place to place the
[1:02:23] intersection or intersection of sinks
[1:02:26] and things there is no place in there
[1:02:28] for that there's no place for
[1:02:30] denomination there's no place for Crees
[1:02:33] outside of it of the Bible see when you
[1:02:36] see those things they just don't come
[1:02:38] into the picture and that's why people
[1:02:40] it's added those got their jigsaw puzzle
[1:02:43] all mixed up see they can't make it
[1:02:46] right same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:48] you know I was just looking at some
[1:02:50] recent videos and you know I find it
[1:02:52] shameful that churches amen are having
[1:02:57] worship services for a man for Jesus at
[1:03:02] Christmas time but they bring in Santa
[1:03:03] Claus into the house of God I find that
[1:03:07] you know that that that's offensive
[1:03:08] amen to bring Santa Claus into the house
[1:03:11] what does he have to do with Jesus
[1:03:12] hallelujah right you know so so you know
[1:03:16] here here when we get this when when
[1:03:18] when we're looking at script we want to
[1:03:20] find Christ and everything that we look
[1:03:22] at brother Adam goes on to say the sense
[1:03:24] but if the thing is put together right
[1:03:26] there is the entire picture of the fall
[1:03:29] and briefie regeneration the whole
[1:03:32] picture of creation and God's whole plan
[1:03:34] revealed right in Jesus Christ a man
[1:03:38] that's the whole picture set together
[1:03:40] every little crook in corner now I don't
[1:03:44] mean to be sacrilegious by this but it's
[1:03:46] just like putting a jigsaw puzzle
[1:03:48] together that's why we got pictures
[1:03:50] today that looks looks that looks
[1:03:52] horrible say we are believers in the cow
[1:03:54] picking grass up in top of the tree hey
[1:03:58] man it doesn't work that's when they say
[1:04:00] yeah he's every way but just of a
[1:04:03] certain know he's the same yesterday
[1:04:04] today and forever all but a certain
[1:04:07] thing see then you ruin your picture now
[1:04:10] he goes on a little further he says the
[1:04:12] Bible says
[1:04:12] he's a saint st. John 5 verse 8 in John
[1:04:15] 14:12
[1:04:16] say he he anybody he that believeth on
[1:04:19] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:04:20] well that was fun another age there you
[1:04:23] got to picture wrong again
[1:04:25] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[1:04:27] a man for a fish and a bunch of hot sand
[1:04:30] where there is no fish that see you've
[1:04:32] got to bring them back to where he's
[1:04:34] fishing amen at Galilee where there's
[1:04:37] plenty of fish you see you've got to
[1:04:40] make the picture look right it's God's
[1:04:42] great picture and there is only one way
[1:04:45] you'll see it that's when you see Jesus
[1:04:48] Christ there is the entire Bible he's
[1:04:51] the principal thing of the Bible
[1:04:57] hallelujah so we want to go in here and
[1:04:59] look at this scripture tonight because
[1:05:03] he's our principal thing as I was
[1:05:06] looking at this a man this this
[1:05:09] particular passage and second Kings we
[1:05:14] have a king by the name of Jahi akin
[1:05:17] when he was a king of Judah and and what
[1:05:22] what what struck me is that the
[1:05:25] scripture made make reference to a
[1:05:27] couple of things that happen let's go
[1:05:28] back and read it a man let's go back and
[1:05:31] read it Oh glory
[1:05:32] a man let's go back and read it says
[1:05:35] verse 27 and it came to pass in the
[1:05:38] seven and thirtieth year of the
[1:05:40] captivity of Jahi ik and king of Judah
[1:05:43] in the 12th month on the seven and
[1:05:46] twentieth day of the month that evil
[1:05:49] Mara that king of Babylon did lift up
[1:05:53] the head of Jehoiakim king of Judah out
[1:05:56] of prison and he spake kindly to him and
[1:05:59] said is throne above the throne of the
[1:06:02] kings that were with him in Babylon and
[1:06:04] changed his prison garments and he did
[1:06:07] eat bread continually before him all the
[1:06:10] days of his life and his allowance was a
[1:06:13] continual hours giving him the King
[1:06:16] giving him other King a daily rate for
[1:06:19] every day all the days of his life
[1:06:22] now this
[1:06:24] and being a king of Judah you know went
[1:06:28] into into captivity there in Babylon but
[1:06:31] there come a time in his captivity where
[1:06:34] he was lifted up pretty much what means
[1:06:36] that he was free from amen the state of
[1:06:38] being in prison he he came out of prison
[1:06:40] somehow hallelujah Amen when and when I
[1:06:44] look at this man I say that he was
[1:06:47] undeserving of what happened very
[1:06:50] undeserving because you know when you
[1:06:52] follow his life amen the scripture said
[1:06:55] that this man did that which was evil in
[1:06:58] the sight of the Lord Amen Jahi akin did
[1:07:01] that which was evil in the sight Lord
[1:07:04] and if I could just be honest tonight we
[1:07:06] all have done some things that have been
[1:07:08] evil in the sight of the Lord Amen we
[1:07:11] were born and seen shaped in
[1:07:14] iniquity and we came into this world
[1:07:16] speaking lies amen this man was
[1:07:19] undeserving but also we were undeserving
[1:07:21] of the grace that was given to us
[1:07:23] through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:07:25] he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:07:28] hallelujah amen stuff so when I look at
[1:07:31] this man a man I didn't see you know
[1:07:35] before he had his his head lifted up and
[1:07:38] and before he was released from prison I
[1:07:40] didn't see in Scripture with its men
[1:07:42] ever repented of the evil works that he
[1:07:45] had done oh there there was a lot to be
[1:07:48] said
[1:07:48] amen about this man he was uh he was
[1:07:51] only he was eighteen years old when he
[1:07:53] was raining
[1:07:54] he only rained for about three months
[1:07:55] and he was taken into captivity and he
[1:07:57] was in captivity for 37 years carried
[1:08:00] away into captivity for 37 years but you
[1:08:04] know here in second Kings 25 they made
[1:08:07] it set on the that the seven and
[1:08:10] twentieth day but it reads a little
[1:08:12] different in the Book of Jeremiah so
[1:08:14] let's read Jeremiah 52 glory to God a
[1:08:20] man just a little bit different in
[1:08:24] Jeremiah glory glory glory glory verse
[1:08:28] 31 and Jeremiah Christmas grace Jeremiah
[1:08:36] 52 it says in a king
[1:08:38] the past in the seven and thirtieth year
[1:08:41] of captivity of Jehoiakim king of Judah
[1:08:44] in the twelfth month in the five and
[1:08:48] twentieth day so I'm Christmas he would
[1:08:53] have been delivered on in the five and
[1:08:57] twentieth day hallelujah and see this is
[1:08:59] why I call it Christmas grace because
[1:09:01] this man did nothing to deserve this
[1:09:04] this I can't even remember finding a
[1:09:07] script tonight is possible that the man
[1:09:08] repented but it just wasn't recorded in
[1:09:10] Scripture that he repented and received
[1:09:12] this grace hallelujah you know I just
[1:09:16] you know grace is something that's given
[1:09:18] to us even when we don't deserve it
[1:09:20] hallelujah that's that's what I see here
[1:09:22] amen grace is something given to us even
[1:09:25] when we don't deserve it
[1:09:27] listen look at look at look at this he
[1:09:29] says in the fireman 20th day of the
[1:09:32] month that evil married a king of
[1:09:34] Babylon in the first year it's reign
[1:09:36] lifted up the head of Jahi akin king of
[1:09:39] Judah and brought him forth out of
[1:09:41] prison and speak kindly unto him and
[1:09:43] said his throne above the throne of the
[1:09:46] kings that were with him in Babylon and
[1:09:48] changed his prison garments and he did
[1:09:51] continually eat bread before him all the
[1:09:53] days of his life and for his diet there
[1:09:56] was a continual diet giving him of the
[1:09:59] king of Babylon everyday apportioning to
[1:10:01] the day of his death all the days of his
[1:10:04] life this happened on the 25th day of
[1:10:06] the 12th month this man received
[1:10:09] Christmas grease let me go on a little
[1:10:14] further here because when I look at all
[1:10:17] of these things that that that Judge
[1:10:20] Ohia can receive there was five actions
[1:10:23] a man that were given him first
[1:10:26] was he had his head lifted up he had his
[1:10:29] head lifted up and when were talking
[1:10:32] about having your head lifted up this
[1:10:34] compares to what happened to Joseph down
[1:10:37] in Pharaoh's prison a man fair I mean
[1:10:41] Joseph might have thought he was
[1:10:43] forgotten about Joseph might have
[1:10:46] thought that a man he would never come
[1:10:48] maybe Joseph thought that the dreams
[1:10:50] that God gave him would never come to
[1:10:53] pass but there came a day that God amen
[1:10:56] aloud plus a couple dreams to strike the
[1:10:59] land and if Pharaoh had nobody could
[1:11:02] interpret him and God God allowed Joseph
[1:11:04] to be remembered at the right time and
[1:11:06] when he get when he got remembered he
[1:11:08] got brought into pharaoh's court and
[1:11:10] when Pharaoh
[1:11:11] a man thought that there was nobody else
[1:11:13] able to interpret the dreams and give
[1:11:15] him counsel away Joseph gave him counsel
[1:11:18] Joseph had his head lifted up and he
[1:11:22] didn't go back to prison
[1:11:23] hallelujah I pray tonight that somebody
[1:11:27] will come out of the prison cells that
[1:11:30] the devil might have them bounded there
[1:11:32] have their head lifted up and they
[1:11:34] receive some grace on Christmas
[1:11:38] hallelujah amen the other thing that
[1:11:41] happened is that the man speak kindly
[1:11:43] unto him this new king a man evil
[1:11:47] Marivic he spake kindly unto him and
[1:11:52] when I when I just Briton you know we
[1:11:54] reflected I said well how did the Lord
[1:11:56] Jesus speak kindly unto somebody I
[1:11:59] thought of the woman that was caught in
[1:12:01] the act of adultery hallelujah when they
[1:12:04] brought this woman to the Lord Jesus and
[1:12:06] they became the accuser of all the
[1:12:08] things that she had done Jesus just
[1:12:11] began to write in the sand and and he
[1:12:13] acted as if he was ignoring every
[1:12:15] accusation I thank God for grace like
[1:12:19] that a grace that would ignore every
[1:12:22] accusation everything that the devil can
[1:12:25] pinpoint are on you anything the devil
[1:12:28] can accuse you of Jesus ignores bless it
[1:12:33] be the name of the Lord for grace like
[1:12:35] that Jesus ignored everything that hurt
[1:12:38] uses brought to his attention and then
[1:12:42] he spoke kindly to it after he told he
[1:12:44] accused us he that's without sin let him
[1:12:47] cast the first stone
[1:12:48] when all of them dropped their rocks and
[1:12:51] begin to walk away Jesus spoke kindly to
[1:12:53] say woman where are your accusers
[1:12:59] if she looked around because I can I can
[1:13:02] see her maybe balled up ready to get hit
[1:13:04] by a rock but she looked around saying
[1:13:07] Lord I have none I have none he says
[1:13:11] neither do I accuse you
[1:13:13] he spoke kindly to her oh Jesus
[1:13:19] the third thing he brought them forth
[1:13:22] out of prison and we know Joseph was
[1:13:25] brought out of prison but I thought of
[1:13:27] how the Lord Jesus a man enter he sent
[1:13:30] his angel to the prison one night and
[1:13:32] got Peter out of the prison hallelujah
[1:13:36] while Saints were praying and I and I
[1:13:38] just found this out this week I was so I
[1:13:40] was so glad to hear this you know we had
[1:13:42] our last night of Prayer last night for
[1:13:46] just further for the brothers a man and
[1:13:48] we had seven brothers show up for the
[1:13:50] last night of Prayer ain't that
[1:13:52] beautiful
[1:13:53] seven is a number of completion and if
[1:13:56] we're coming to the end of the year with
[1:13:57] seven brothers to complete the prayer
[1:13:59] that was perfect then I was telling my
[1:14:01] wife but I should say you know what when
[1:14:02] we had sister's prayer last week
[1:14:04] we had seven sisters hallelujah God know
[1:14:09] what he doing right amen them sevens
[1:14:12] means something glory to God but but as
[1:14:15] the Saints were praying for Peter God
[1:14:17] amen brought him out of prison
[1:14:21] hallelujah and I believe as we pray for
[1:14:24] others God is gonna also bring our loved
[1:14:27] ones out of prison praise God this is a
[1:14:32] season for them to be released this is
[1:14:35] not the season for them to be bound this
[1:14:38] is the season for them to be released
[1:14:41] gonna bring our loved ones out of prison
[1:14:44] I don't care how deep they in gotta
[1:14:50] bring them out of prison if you have to
[1:14:53] if we have to blind my eyes of other
[1:14:56] ones that's keeping in prison gotta do
[1:14:58] whatever he needs to do to bring them
[1:15:01] out hallelujah Peter was locked in
[1:15:04] prison but he was delivered through the
[1:15:06] prayers of the Saints and that's the
[1:15:07] same way many are gonna be delivered
[1:15:09] today through the prints of the Saints
[1:15:11] the other thing that the scripture says
[1:15:13] he said is throne above the throne of
[1:15:16] the kings that were with him in Babylon
[1:15:18] I love that he said his throne above
[1:15:21] because you know about the the the the
[1:15:25] Babylonians they had actually taken over
[1:15:27] so much they took over Egypt and and
[1:15:30] Israel and just a number of kingdoms so
[1:15:32] this man had his throne set above those
[1:15:35] that were in Babylon did not now and
[1:15:38] we'll read something a little bit later
[1:15:39] if I can I want to read a quote here for
[1:15:41] you really quick the scripture I've
[1:15:44] quoted real quick Revelation 3:21 just
[1:15:47] took my when I thought about this said
[1:15:49] is throwing the butter throwing the
[1:15:50] kings that when Babylon
[1:15:51] I thought about revelation 3:21 says to
[1:15:53] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:15:55] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:15:57] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:16:00] his throne that's the promise of the
[1:16:02] Lord Jesus to us as overcome us and here
[1:16:05] in the legacy in the aged brother Adam
[1:16:07] says now now what we ought to overcome
[1:16:10] that is the normal question that asked
[1:16:11] here but that is not the actual thought
[1:16:14] of this verse for some it's not so much
[1:16:16] what we are to overcome but how we are
[1:16:20] to overcome now this is logical for does
[1:16:23] it matter much what we ought to overcome
[1:16:26] as long as we know how we can overcome
[1:16:29] it says a quick look at those scriptures
[1:16:31] which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming
[1:16:33] will bring out the truth of this
[1:16:35] proposition in Matthew 4 where in Jesus
[1:16:38] is tempted of the devil
[1:16:40] he overcame the personal temptations of
[1:16:42] Satan by the word and by the word only
[1:16:45] in each of the three major trials that
[1:16:48] comprehend
[1:16:49] that correspondent exactly to the
[1:16:51] temptation of the Garden of Eden the
[1:16:53] lust of the flesh the lust that I have a
[1:16:55] proud of life Jesus overcame by the word
[1:16:58] he failed to the personal temptation of
[1:17:00] Satan by falling by failing to use the
[1:17:03] word Adam fell in direct disobedience to
[1:17:05] the word but Jesus overcame by the word
[1:17:08] and right now let me say this this I say
[1:17:11] that this is the only way to be an
[1:17:14] overcomer also it is the only way that
[1:17:17] you can know if you're overcoming
[1:17:19] because the word can't fail so if you
[1:17:22] want to be an overcoming this out you
[1:17:23] can't overcome with the word it's gonna
[1:17:25] take it natural fillers not your
[1:17:27] emotions you're gonna need the words
[1:17:29] hallelujah Amen I'm skipping down at the
[1:17:32] paragraph 366 Amen they're in the same
[1:17:34] same page there it says now then there
[1:17:38] will not be one person who will sit in
[1:17:41] the throne of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:42] unless he has been living that word your
[1:17:46] prayers your fastest your repent assists
[1:17:48] no matter what you present to God none
[1:17:51] of that will gain you the privilege of
[1:17:53] sitting in the throne and it would be
[1:17:54] granted only to the word bribe as a
[1:17:56] throne of the King gets shared with the
[1:17:59] Queen because she is united to him so
[1:18:03] only they who are of the word even as he
[1:18:06] is of that word will share that throne
[1:18:09] as Joe Hiatt Kim Amen he was given a
[1:18:14] throne above the throne of the kings
[1:18:16] that were with him in Babylon we as a
[1:18:18] bribe of the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:18:21] overcomers will sit in his throne god is
[1:18:26] so good
[1:18:28] the other thing that happened here the
[1:18:30] fifth thing that happened is that they
[1:18:33] changed its prison garments and anybody
[1:18:37] that's ever been in prison knows what it
[1:18:40] feels like to be able to wear normal
[1:18:41] clothes don't have the way to Orange and
[1:18:44] whatever it is that look you have to
[1:18:46] look and identify yourself as a prisoner
[1:18:48] but people want their garments changed
[1:18:51] as soon as they get out they want to
[1:18:52] change them gums they don't want to be
[1:18:53] identified with that anymore
[1:18:55] and I'll tell you what when you come a
[1:18:57] man out of bondage you come out of
[1:19:00] bondage you're going
[1:19:01] two garments change too when people are
[1:19:04] really free Oh y'all it hurt me yet
[1:19:07] but when they really get free that
[1:19:08] garments gonna change I'm gonna say that
[1:19:12] again when you really get free I'm talk
[1:19:14] about really free your garments gonna
[1:19:17] change
[1:19:17] you're gonna identify yourself with the
[1:19:19] world no more hey man we're now now we
[1:19:23] try to get as close as we can to the
[1:19:24] world but we're but when you when you
[1:19:28] when you when you went when he changes
[1:19:30] your prison garments hallelujah you look
[1:19:34] like the world no more and won't even
[1:19:36] care that you don't look like them
[1:19:39] hallelujah hey man Church let me read
[1:19:43] this say man this is coming from the
[1:19:45] sardian Church each the Prophet says in
[1:19:47] revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the
[1:19:49] same shall be clothed in white raiment I
[1:19:52] would not blot out his name out of the
[1:19:55] book of life but I will confess his name
[1:19:56] before my father and his holy angels he
[1:19:59] that overcometh the same shall be
[1:20:01] clothed in white raiment says this is
[1:20:03] actually a repetition of verse 4 where
[1:20:05] an has made the reference to the few who
[1:20:07] have not defiled their garments we used
[1:20:11] to have a saying years ago that no doubt
[1:20:13] was taken from this verse it said it was
[1:20:15] keep your skirts clean it meant don't
[1:20:19] get involved in questionable things as
[1:20:24] believers this is this is how we keep on
[1:20:26] starts clean don't get involved in
[1:20:29] questionable things a man others will be
[1:20:33] involved you might be tempted to be
[1:20:36] involved or someone might even try to
[1:20:38] involve you but stay clear of it all by
[1:20:41] steering a course away from it now God
[1:20:45] is going to reward those who follow this
[1:20:46] advice a man they are going to be
[1:20:49] clothed and white even as he is clothed
[1:20:52] in white Peter James and John saw him on
[1:20:55] Mount transit Transfiguration and it's
[1:20:57] close where it's white it's like
[1:20:58] that is how the Saints are going to be
[1:21:00] clothed their garments will be shining
[1:21:02] exceedingly white and the only ones get
[1:21:05] that exceedingly white garment are those
[1:21:07] that overcome you're gonna have to
[1:21:09] overcome something a man you know
[1:21:12] fashion is something that people have to
[1:21:13] overcome a man fashion is something that
[1:21:17] people have to overcome glory to God
[1:21:20] it's very easy to look like the world
[1:21:23] and act like the world but as believers
[1:21:26] we got to overcome that amen
[1:21:28] that's not our example hallelujah some
[1:21:32] some some some model on Instagram is not
[1:21:34] our example praise God the scriptures
[1:21:37] are example a man glory to God so I just
[1:21:43] believe somebody gonna have big the
[1:21:45] prison garments changed we notice here
[1:21:52] in second Kings 25 has stated that the
[1:21:55] release of jaya can occurred on the
[1:21:58] twenty seven twenty seventh day of the
[1:22:00] 12th month but in Jeremiah is stated
[1:22:03] that he was lifted up on the 25th day of
[1:22:05] the 12th month now I hate to be the one
[1:22:12] to bring it out but that is somewhat of
[1:22:14] a discrepancy and we have many people
[1:22:17] that are turning away from the message
[1:22:18] today because they find these little
[1:22:21] things and they feel like they can't
[1:22:22] trust it anymore
[1:22:23] and and I and I hate to say if we apply
[1:22:27] that same principle to Scripture
[1:22:29] somebody's faith might be shut by the
[1:22:32] two scriptures I read tonight but I want
[1:22:35] to a man just take you back a little bit
[1:22:37] theologian state that is possible that
[1:22:40] the or that the order for him to be
[1:22:43] released actually occurred on the 25th
[1:22:45] but the actual release may occurred on
[1:22:48] the 27th now they say that that's that's
[1:22:49] possible that's just something that they
[1:22:51] concluded and I what I like to call
[1:22:54] speculation as no one really knows why
[1:22:57] those dates are different but they
[1:22:59] speculated this so since the theologians
[1:23:02] can speculate I figured I could as well
[1:23:04] and man and I believe the dates are
[1:23:07] different because
[1:23:08] God does not want us to approach him
[1:23:10] through knowledge but God wants to
[1:23:14] accept everything that wants us to
[1:23:15] accept everything by faith hallelujah
[1:23:19] what does it matter about the date the
[1:23:22] fact of the matter is that his hat was
[1:23:25] lifted up the fact of the matter is that
[1:23:28] he was set on the throne above the other
[1:23:30] Kings the fact of the matter is is that
[1:23:33] his prison karma sinks the fact of the
[1:23:37] matter is that he received unmerited I'm
[1:23:41] being served grace that's the facts
[1:23:46] halu so don't get caught up in a little
[1:23:49] itty-bitty things that don't mean
[1:23:51] anything that's just a devil trying to a
[1:23:54] make it you focus on something so small
[1:23:57] hallelujah amen but look at the facts
[1:24:00] the fact is the man was deliver and did
[1:24:03] not deserve it hallelujah
[1:24:06] that's that's that that man takes me I
[1:24:09] was delivered and didn't I deserve it I
[1:24:11] was set free and did not deserve it
[1:24:14] somebody else took my place on the cross
[1:24:16] I deserve to be there
[1:24:20] but he took my place that's what I want
[1:24:23] to keep my eye on look at this statement
[1:24:26] made here from Matthew Henry just in his
[1:24:29] commentary
[1:24:30] Jahi can fell from a thrown into a
[1:24:33] prison think about that he was a man
[1:24:37] that fell from a throne into a prison
[1:24:41] but here and his advant
[1:24:46] in this scripture he's advanced to a
[1:24:48] throne of state now when it says that he
[1:24:50] was raised to the throne and his throne
[1:24:53] set higher than the other kings it was a
[1:24:54] throne of state not a throne of power
[1:24:56] right because the king of Babylon Eve
[1:24:58] Ameritech was the one of the throne of
[1:25:00] power but he was wrong a race to us a
[1:25:02] throne of state says as before the robes
[1:25:05] were changed to prison garments so now
[1:25:09] they were converted back to rose again
[1:25:12] glory though the night of affliction be
[1:25:16] very long he was Devon years though the
[1:25:20] night of affliction
[1:25:22] be very long yet we must not despair I
[1:25:25] don't know how long you've been waiting
[1:25:26] on God to do something for you I want to
[1:25:28] tell you tonight don't despair the day
[1:25:31] may dawn at last July a chemist 37 years
[1:25:36] of prisoner in confinement and contempt
[1:25:38] since he was 18 years old
[1:25:40] let those whose afflictions have been
[1:25:43] lifted lifted out be encouraged a man
[1:25:46] encouraged themselves with this instance
[1:25:49] with this scripture the vision will add
[1:25:51] the end speak comfortably and therefore
[1:25:55] wait for it
[1:25:56] Alleluia God can make his people find
[1:26:00] favor in the eyes of their oppressors
[1:26:04] like that God can make his people find
[1:26:09] favor in the eyes of their oppressors
[1:26:11] and turn their hearts to to pity them
[1:26:14] God know how to change things and turn
[1:26:17] things around and this man that again I
[1:26:21] never saw and script to where he
[1:26:22] actually repented of his deeds I never
[1:26:24] saw that
[1:26:25] I mean Jeremiah prophesied against him
[1:26:28] and and one of the other things that
[1:26:30] happened in the Book of Jeremiah this
[1:26:32] man when he went to when he went into
[1:26:34] captivity there was a man by the name of
[1:26:37] Hananiah that rose up and prophesied
[1:26:41] that in two years
[1:26:43] the hyenas coming back and jeremiah said
[1:26:48] amen when the church said amen and after
[1:26:53] church it got Hananiah to decided say
[1:26:56] thus saith the lord because you lied in
[1:26:59] your prophecy and you and you gave them
[1:27:01] a false prophecy you won't live another
[1:27:04] year and he died within a year but Jahi
[1:27:08] can Amen he went on into he never came
[1:27:11] back after two years but in 37 years his
[1:27:14] hand was lifted up now he didn't come
[1:27:16] back to Jerusalem but where he where he
[1:27:18] was he was no longer eating prison food
[1:27:20] he was eating the King's food he was no
[1:27:24] longer sitting in the prison cell he was
[1:27:26] sitting at the Kings table and this is a
[1:27:28] man that I don't see in Scripture ever
[1:27:31] repented that's why I called it
[1:27:33] Christmas grace
[1:27:35] and if the Hika can't treat it like that
[1:27:41] what do you think you'll do for us his
[1:27:45] bride that's been washed in blood Oh
[1:27:49] church glory to God I certainly thank
[1:27:54] God for this grease a man a man a man
[1:27:59] let's just look at two other little
[1:28:01] statements here from the Prophet why
[1:28:03] little Bethlehem and then the last that
[1:28:06] I'll read would be sirs we would see
[1:28:08] Jesus he says poor people Joseph and
[1:28:14] Mary both real poor you hear they was in
[1:28:17] this little stable how humble God makes
[1:28:19] itself then we try to make ourselves
[1:28:21] something great can't you see how God
[1:28:24] humbles himself and takes the things
[1:28:26] that's not that he might bring to pass
[1:28:29] his great promises how that little
[1:28:31] Jehovah laying in a manger wrapped and
[1:28:33] the cloth taken off of the back of a
[1:28:37] yoke the neck of a yoke where ox had
[1:28:39] been and wrapped the Prince of Peace in
[1:28:42] it my who are we then what do we deserve
[1:28:47] if God can humble himself like that
[1:28:52] oughtn't we to be able to humble
[1:28:54] ourselves to become his servant if he
[1:28:58] did things like that can't we forget our
[1:29:01] great dignities and things of this of
[1:29:04] this world and pass from that and humble
[1:29:07] ourselves before him this Christmas show
[1:29:11] him our appreciation of the of that
[1:29:13] birth and that humility by humbling our
[1:29:15] own selves and receiving his word no
[1:29:19] matter what the tradition says it's his
[1:29:22] word that counts that's what he'll take
[1:29:25] his word and that only and I just
[1:29:27] challenges a man just to reflect on how
[1:29:30] ho my Lord and Savior came and my you
[1:29:33] know you just imagined brother Branham
[1:29:36] said they were poor Mary and Joseph both
[1:29:39] poor God that owns the entire world a
[1:29:43] god that Amen that made it all and what
[1:29:47] he chooses
[1:29:48] do is come to a poor father a poor
[1:29:52] mother rather can barely take care of
[1:29:54] whatever they got but come to these poor
[1:29:56] people say I'm gonna be born here got
[1:30:01] some people that couldn't I mean they
[1:30:03] they they they were looking for and
[1:30:04] couldn't get any room in the end but
[1:30:06] decided we'll go to a stable and then in
[1:30:09] a manger and then we'll have hay and
[1:30:11] we'll have all of this and then this is
[1:30:13] the way I'm gonna choose to be born the
[1:30:15] King of Kings the Lord of lords come
[1:30:18] with such humility church is time for us
[1:30:21] to kind of start reflecting in this Lord
[1:30:23] if you would that humble when you came
[1:30:25] don't let us I mean can you imagine even
[1:30:27] Mary if I could just ask some y'all
[1:30:30] sisters put yourself in Mary's place if
[1:30:35] you were carrying Christ how would you
[1:30:39] act if you would have one chosen like
[1:30:43] Mary was chosen how would you act would
[1:30:46] you be round telling everybody guess
[1:30:48] what I'm carrying Jehovah when we think
[1:30:56] about this thing's church it puts things
[1:30:58] back into perspective our God was so
[1:31:00] humble so humble and like brother
[1:31:03] Branham say he gave us a wrap package
[1:31:05] that many people just refuse to unwrap
[1:31:07] but what we need to do is go back and
[1:31:09] look at it grace was given to us when
[1:31:11] Jesus came don't reject that grace sir
[1:31:19] as we would see Jesus the Prophet says
[1:31:26] God bless you just scroll down a little
[1:31:29] bit there says God bless you
[1:31:34] not exactly a Merry Christmas
[1:31:37] but God's blessings of Christmas be upon
[1:31:40] you may the Christ of Calvary hide you

[1:32:00] is my prayer I want to pray amen at this
[1:32:05] moment for us we thank God for His grace

[1:32:17] share with the Saints tonight as we've
[1:32:20] come out to worship you well we look
[1:32:23] back in Scripture and see this manager
[1:32:25] hyah cannon king of Judah Lord who it
[1:32:30] walked away from you the entire nation
[1:32:33] of Israel or were God turning from you
[1:32:36] at that time and God it reminds me of
[1:32:41] many of us today Lord that are not doing
[1:32:43] the things that you're asking us to do
[1:32:44] we've turned from you we've forgotten

[1:33:22] mankind to be able to redeem them God
[1:33:25] how grateful that you would humble
[1:33:27] yourself to be born the way that you
[1:33:31] were born to live the way that you live
[1:33:34] to die the way that you died sometimes
