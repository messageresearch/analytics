also you heard brother Solomon say earlier we want to just say once again how much we appreciate by the Cleveland sister D and the family being here with us a man spending a vacation in Florida a name it's always good to have them a man here with us and just it's just something about having both brother Cleveland Church anytime I see him walk through the doors I know we getting ready to have church a man I know that let's so praise the Lord the the see here after after the service today I need to pray amen for our children and as well as the you know the administrators that be going back into school we want to have just prayer over them today so please just keep that in mind out those that might need to leave will make sure that we we dismiss you but for those the parents with the kids everything we want to pray for them today there's a couple of things that's going to be happening over the next few weeks where they're going to have a lot of people out in one one two weeks from now I'll be out in Tucson Arizona so I want to do that today a man since we can the other thing that I want to do today is we have a dedication a man for two of our little ones a man brother Andrew and sister Candice has been blessed a man with two wonderful sons and we want to dedicate them to the Lord and I want to just read a scripture if you all would just get bring them in from the field of sin I want to read here from mark chapter 10 a man as we would just get prepared for the dedication anytime we are doing a dedication amen I'm always reminded of the story in the scripture with Samuels mother a man how she went back to the temple of God and she she told God that if he blessed her you know with the child and she would give that child back to the Lord and you know and he was raised up there in the house of God and and God even called him to be a prophet so you know we always think of those things and and here we don't believe in infant baptism things that nature but we do believe in dedicating the children back to the Lord as God has given them to us right here mark chapter 10 verse 13 says they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God and he said verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them amen so we want to do it the way the scripture did it amen as they brought the kids to Jesus He blessed him and this morning we want to bless Ayden amen and Jackson and we want to just pray over them and dedicate them back to the Lord as I just think about Andrew and Candace and my god I just remember them being you know I mean Candace for sure being dedicated right I was I was there you know and just seeing how the Lord has blessed them the devil certainly attacked her body and the midst of the pregnancy but God brought it through and anytime I see the devil attack like that I believe God got something special for that child right it got something special for the child for the parents and you know so it's an honor for me just to be able to do this today and I want to invite the the mother and the father the kids I want the grandparents as well we have both grandparents set the grandparents here that's a blessing that that's a blessing a man that's a blessing so we want to invite them to come on up in amen we are going to pray over these little ones praise the Lord for them and praise the Lord amen let's sing say bring them in bring him Oh ring from the fields of sinner bring bring them in yes bring them hope ring sing it again I say bring them here ring yes ring from the fields of Silla we bring them in yes bring war bring the little ones to Jesus I'm sorry about that got a grandma a

and also the text let's bow is he ready to take it already so you something special about it let's pray let's pray father in the name of Jesus God we had the privilege of dedicating Aden back to you as parents and brought him to the house of the Lord today just as Samuels mother brought him to the house and God we pray that you would just take this child we've already seen your mighty hand upon him watching over him keeping him protecting him we've seen it God and we know Lord that the enemy doesn't like them but father we thank you that you ordained his life to be here and we believe you have purpose for this child so we pray God that as he's raised up in the house and his parents take the responsibility to train him up and the way to each that go that when it gets old he will not depart we ask God to a bless their family that you would bless this child and that you O God would just put him in an environment that he could develop and grow into a relationship with you we give them back to you today as you have given him to them and Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you [Music] the Lord let's pray over Jack's father we are privileged to hold Jackson in our hands this morning and to dedicate him back to you God we thank you for watching over sister Candace through the pregnancy the enemy just attacked on every hand but could not take the life of this baby could not take the life of the mother god we notice you have ordained their life a purpose and you have planned for them so doctors we give the child back to you as you've given it to them we pray that you it bless their home that you have blessed the environment the grandparents great-granddaughter your word you told us to train up our children the way that they should go God that when they get old they would not depart so help us do what we've been called to do according to your word we dedicate Jackson to you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless [Music]

for a little bit a man thank God for bringing her back here safely a man if you all would just stand with me we'll read from the word of the Lord today a man will go back to the book of first Peter and man I see all this black and red did I miss something I think I'm supposed to have a black Andrea too but thank the Lord for the Saints here in 1st Peter 2 best verse ones we continue our journey through a man the scripture says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as into a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head the corner stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient weren't also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy the Lord of the blessing to the reading of his word let's pray amen over the scriptures that we've read father we are grateful for the privilege to read but father we know it takes the Holy Ghost to make it clear as to what we have ran so we trust God that the Spirit of God would come now and take control over this portion of the service as you have already blessed in the prior part of the service we thank you for the specials we thank you for the worship we thank you for everything that has happened in this place and and now God made you minister to our hearts today through your word in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated we will continue our journey a man with the topic of a royal priesthood a man and I know this morning that I am standing in the midst of royalty a man it's a whole bunch of kings no Queens Kings right kings I'm standing the midst of kings and you know as I thought about that a little bit more you know sometimes what sisters like well how do I take that title you know as a king you know I'm a queen I cannot you know I can I take the title King was the same thing those brothers taking on the title Bride of Christ all right a man we take on the title bride and that's a feminine turn but yet we still call ourselves bride right so that's this is you call yourself King praise the Lord Amen because he hath made you kings and he's made you priests Oh glory now we want to make sure we line it up just right because we're not saying that giving right for the sisters to preach the gospel a man but it's a place it's a it's a position that we are laying claim to and and it's something that the scripture has told us that we we have been given this I want to read a man from this sermon the Messiah and let's just start here and you know and we'll work our way through this start on today amen the by the Prophet says that he says then when God was made flesh and the king the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that's God's church his standing light is the light of the Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages now if you all remember last week I was how about how Jeremiah was the light for his day and Isaiah was the light for his day well we the light for our day right amen we can't look at everybody else that song going by we just build upon the foundation that they laid amen we not changing the foundation we build upon it and we just keep walking it and we become the light for our day listen it says is standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ and its people the anointed was carrying forth its light into all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out then it comes back again God's anointed one God let the Messiah church if Messiah means Anointed One and means king then if the Church of the Lord by the Messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still a Messiah when he some titles for the church now you the bride your king your priest your Messiah a man I see man to it because the prophet said it it man you little lights with this thing your lesser he our huh alright okay well just tell me who you are maybe you didn't know that hey man but it's time for us to recognize who we are Messiah the world is looking for Messiah when they see you they have seen Messiah all right a man become a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain the trouble today we've organized the church to death and we got organization instead of Messiah like we got wrestle light Proctor light and all other kinds of light but we need my fire light what the church needs today is a lot of the Messiah oh I love him for his goodness and he goes on now that is true God called messiahs God called us and we become kings and priests unto God like Jesus was God's High Priest we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in the fullness and God included swirling him to shine forth the expression of God to the world but God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and have God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoint him some Messiah amen not all the church agon get it but I believe I'm a part of the group that God is going to come in to and anoint him supplements at Amen I don't even know if that word is in the dictionary but it's in the message and I understand exactly what he's saying right oh my do you see it the same thing he did in his church the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his Dominion and he's king over this Dominion and we are kings and priests my question is is winner we kings and priests you got the answer you already you know we read it last week right now we're kings and brief we're not waiting on the Millennium now we are kings and priests all right glory to God we are Kings the priests offering spiritual sacrifices of God the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name amen oh my there you are Messiah Matthias little Matthias a little Anointed One I'm not an upper what the main one anointed off of the great one all right I'm going on I want to go a little further in this I said you see what messiahs Messiah is the kingdom of God anointed ones Oh glory am i I'm down a paragraph 29 I'm sorry I skipped on that e 20 9 says that you see what Messiah is Messiah the kingdom of God anointed ones them an orchard with the Saints fear he was anointed with one said to him when they will will my son said it the right and the left hand he said can you drink the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with she said yeah and he said you will but the kingdom that's it right left is not mine to give so it showed that we could drink the same cup of persecution be called Beelzebub or whatever it might be and still be baptized with the same spirit he's baptized with so if he if he was calling Masai which he was because he was anointed with the holy spirit and any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah a little smaller God I like that you know brother branham share and one place you say now you know you could go in amen and get into the ocean and you got all this water you know in the ocean but then you just take maybe just a bottle full of the ocean amen and you be put in a bottle you still up you still got the ocean in the bottom if you just got a spoonful amen of the ocean in your spoon you still got the ocean even if it's just a spoonful in still the entire it's the ocean all the contents of the ocean are in that spoonful if you just got a little bit of God that makes all of God inside of you if you got a little bit of God all right church amen listen so someday when this body is resurrected I hope before hand that God can get a look at this that's why I have to read these things if they I hope beforehand that God can get a hold of a bunch of people God does want to get a hold of just a few people you know even even the Marines want a few good men God just want to butcher people and I'm determined to be in that bunch of people if I can just get a gossip you can just get a hold of a culture people that'll manifest his power in every dimension that is supposed to be in Messiah Anointed One a king to deliver a king your kings and priests teams to bring in priests to minister to a messiah his science was to follow in all ages reflected his light his practice with his kingdom people let me just go a little further then now don't you you don't have to die to get this to become a king in pre she ain't got to die remember last week I saw you now but sometimes the court that that son is born to his father that said makes that son first one son he was usually on particularly the kingship but you know often times you know the boy have to wait for the daddy to die before he become king right but you know there there are some situations where the daddy did not die and the boy became king I'm going to try to read one to you a little later on in the sermon there was one a man that out of something happen to the daddy so he couldn't be king no more but they're known at the blow him he took his place a man see our God can't die he is king of kings he can't die so we can't wait for him to die to become king he can't die right but he can still give you the authority and the power to be a king he can anoint you and place you at King and he's still alive whoo all right let's go on let's go on you don't have to die to get this you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die the inside is where God gets in and to control you and he and he presses his self forward and you don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strife that will run him right back again see that now if you go back to the 1st Peter 2 and see where it says laying aside all malice and all guile hypocrisy and envies and all evil speaking that's not you praying and asking God to take that from you that's actually you deciding I'm a little side are we going to get somewhere today I you know if you actually make it that shorts yourself if this one don't want to do it I'm still gonna do it oh god I'm trying to save something I'm trying to say something here but but I'm just running it you see that the spirit is not just written just to be written but God is calling us to something right here here here listen this what Robert said you say he say he is president he presses himself farting you don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strife that will run him right back again just get all the meanness and the superstitions and the unbelief out of you and every time you move out a little unbelief God steps right in and takes over just move out down belief all right I'm done with that quote I just you know I'm I'm dropping this in because the church we once we realize who we are it you know the brought the prophecy the rapture gun going when the bride recognizes who she is you say the rapture will actually go oh my god y'all got time for just let me read one more I got this one last week from brother Solomon I want to read it to you and I'm we gonna get into something I promise I promise just then just coasting that always enjoy the ride enjoy the ride amen it's coming out of belief in style did you know that there's a sermon in the title believe it's down this there's always a message in the message right but but this listen at some of the things that the Prophet tells us you know watch this watch this it says here 300 years ago in French science has proved that if you go the terrific speed of 35 miles an hour gravitation would take you off the earth you think science will refer back to that today but they're going 1,900 miles an hour's still going on they're pressing forward looking forward but we want to look back and see what moody saying thank you said Finlayson Knox Calvin some of those what they said was all right that was for their age but we're going on my grandfather wrote an oxcart I'm driving a Ford a v8 my son will fly a jet plane that's what that's how we're moving on that's what religion ought to be the coming of the Lord is at hand the church ought to be moving on interest into into the powers science can only climb so far then it has to drop off but we got may not tell our science science can only go so far they gonna have to drop off so we're gonna be on science we got untapped sources then a negative never that's never been touched that is a powerful statement these are things that you ain't never seen before you ain't even read it before but we got untapped sources that's never been touched and I believe every trail that we're facing God is preparing his people through the trial to tap into several sources you know Abraham had never seen what he saw before in his day he'd never seen anything like that he'd never seen he never seen a man somebody have they body changed like that he was the first one to do something like that that's Genesis and if it was that way in Genesis a first time for something it might be their way at the years hop our first time for something the Prophet says is he says we got untapped sources that's never been touched all right of the power unlimited no no but y'all now you know people like unlimited stuff they love it you know can we just talk just a little bit I got it I got to break things down I got to slow down talk to y'all just you know I mean you know we used to go to a little restaurant I'm telling on one of my relatives I ain't gonna tell you who it is I'm just telling on one of my relatives we've got we go we go to that little restaurant and they go on a certain day and they have the same we call endless rise endless fries and that that relative will just be the table saying like you know they got English pride and we're just sitting there filling up on it for now you know that play get empty you know they got endless fun and we just cry I mean played out to play to just five people like to go where things are limited when you when you get a drink is that right just we get a drink justice as this free cuz if it ain't really believe on it you want to know if that he got sweet Lucille I mean freedom you feel you want you want to know if that soda got free refill inside rates that ain't no free refill so you don't get that people want to go with these are lunatic when I come to church and experience your God that is a limited [Applause] we're going to talk about what happened years ago we put out a column right now on top sources unlimited we even seen it yet unlimited of God that we are to be moving into we're living a million miles under our privilege tonight of privileges of Christians to be enjoying we suppose enjoy this and we just fighting the trying to get in the Lord how do I yield that you might just get everything out of me you place me at this time and this season this hour this age you want to get you want to get the most out of me how do I yield listen we got it we know we no longer can we be slaves to passion slaves to fashion slaves to the things of the world it's time for us to tap into some of this stuff a man church glory to God amen alright listen he said I feel ashamed of myself when I look out here and see the institutions and the sickness in trouble that's going on right now our church that's what the prophecy our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick what not not the Prophet the church our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize that Jesus Christ lives that's what we need to be doing that's what we need to be done are doing now you know the Prophet had shared a situation one time where he was on he was away he was out of out of town and somebody in the church had had died while the Prophet was away from his church somebody died and when they died they called the the Undertaker in they come in and bomb the body and a few of the brothers in the church had heard about this person dying and brothers kind of got together like wait a minute they died then what is this it just felt something I write about that so the embalm body the brothers of the church went down to the Undertaker said could we just see the body and they got there to see the body and then brothers pray for the body embalmed that person came back to life the prophet went there but the brothers in his church did it and when he came back he says they say they was taught right they was taught right that's why they knew what to do they were taught right they did not even care about embalming Jesus did that he went to the grave of Lazarus nas was already embalm four days in the grave and when Jesus brought Lazarus come forth I don't know what the parts worth while Lazarus came for the same power that was in Jesus is enough all right okay let me just uh here we go let's let's just jump into something here glory to God he has made us priests kings and priests now I want to go to this sermon the seven church ages paragraph 53 and I will slip into something here all right now the seven spirits that are before God these seven spirits was represented as the seven spirits that would be sent forth for the seven churches seven spirits before God we could pick up from the Old Testament and pick it out there if we just had time and from Jesus Christ was the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us my just look at John get all wound up there when he looked he just goes to speak and he said he had an half and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God his father to him be glory Dominion for ever and ever amen and he has made us priests and kings under God us it's plural not made me priest and a king but made us the church now he's addressing these seven churches for it is it's seven Church ages now he said Dominion and glory and be to him for ever and ever he has made us priests did you ever know what a priest is what his office is a priest is to make sacrifice to make intercession and over in Hebrews that said that we the church is the royal priesthood of rooibos of the holy nation now that we read that out of first Peter right that's back to my statement for last week is in you know what I'm saying it says a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people see our holy nation a peculiar people royal priesthood offering here it is now offering spiritual sacrifices every man and woman that comes to God enters into the veil now there is so many different directions on this thought that I could go just right there from that statement but I'm trying to keep my keep us in a certain channel today as far as you know going you know when you talk about God and every man and woman that comes to God can go and come to God enters into the veil I want to just kind of focus on this part of the priest their responsibility was to make intercession right their responsibility was to make intercession now Jesus would be a primary example of of a priest because Jesus interceded on our behalf right we were guilty we should have died for our sins but Isaiah 53 and 12 says therefore will I divide him a portion with the Great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors that's me and you Jesus made intercession for us I believe Jesus was also interceding a man for the Jews when they they they they said crucify him they yelled out crucify me but you know what what has he done he's done nothing wrong we don't care crucify him anyway when it when he got on the cross he said a prayer to the public Father forgive them they know not what they do hallelujah as a priest we're called to intercede on behalf of others alright just stay with me here Judah interceded on behalf of Benjamin when it was time amen when Joseph had uncovered you know everything and he finally got Benjamin in his presence he sent the brothers up and put that cup inside of a business bag and when he got the when he got the city service Dennis another one or two finds of the cup in the back only bring him back he's going to be my server from here now well when they got back in Joseph's presence and they realized it was the couple since I've been rows back Judah stepped up and he say I'm done I became surety for the last he began to intercede Oh on business I say don't let Benjamin stay but keep me he was into ceding Abraham interceded for lot when he knew that destruction was on his way the Angels that come to visit he knew destruction was on his way he began to plead with God peradventure there be 50 and 40 and 30 and 20 and 10 if you find 10 righteous will you destroy the city he began to intercede and when you recognize that you are priests you can't help but intercede on behalf of others I was talking to a friend last night and I told us a I'm gonna have to use what you just shared with me in the sermon tomorrow and he was saying how he got this job and as he you know went to do the work somebody called him out to do the work and they got it called him he hadn't talked to that guy since they've been there probably two months here and talk to the guy God just they come take care of this fund me and you know and we'll pay in you know just just take care the guy had confidence in them so he got them is doing the work but as he's working with different people but there begin to come some problems and one of the guys that was there one of the other hat guys was was working behind my friend's back and they were trying to get him fired they were doing their best to get him fired - get him off for that job and this man was just going through this person and that person he was just creating a a you know just a little group we're gonna get rid of this guy he just got there left his family to go out here to take this job and everything and say man this guy that start work so so why he you know when he kind of caught what was going on he called a guy that hired him the guy that recommend said look man I come out and I'm doing this but I'm doing that and they doing this they doing this don't know what's gonna say well you know we'll try to work through it they'll try to work through it so if you know he found himself in all kind of situations and you know got it - got him - argument with another superintendent that's all kind of stuff going wrong like man I don't think I'm gonna be able to last through this job much longer the way this stuff is coming against me so he said he said just kind of it was praying about it and then you know one day you know you come into the office and the superintendent another superintendent just start yelling and screaming and cursing them out and they said look now we we mean and you know you I don't use that kind of language you can't talk to me that way we men you just can't do that to me so they say just let it go for a little bit but he felt so bad he got something in his heart against a man so he said he went back to work the next day and he went to the man and apologize he didn't do nothing wrong but he went to the man and apologize and when he went and apologized for that super did it he said well what your presidents would say well I just have something of my heart against you and I didn't really want to have that in my heart so I'm sorry so after that they begin they almost become best buddies well this other guys still working you know to try to get rid of them and he got everybody coming against them where he just kind of waiting and I waited out and and then one night by 10 o'clock he gets an email and the email say we are looking at making some changes you know on the job and so on so which was the guy that was trying to get him fired if say we don't let him go and we want you to take his position but the testimonial stop there he say I was he said because you all are offering it to me I want to take it but I didn't want to take it under these conditions but because you are offering me I want it I will take it because you offered it to me he said but please don't fire that man please find another place for him to work but don't five a man and they said look we can't help it he's caused so much trouble I mean we saw her we can't promise you that we're not going to do that he said I'm just asking if you find another place for him to work please don't fire the man now what was happening he was becoming a intercessor [Music] so so so so so I'll you know he got a call back and say well we you know we told other guy that we was going to let him go and he began to ask us please not to fire him to just reassign him somewhere else so we felt we gave in to and we reassign them to another state but what happened is that God heard the the intercessors cry and provided for his enemy [Music] [Music] the man's interceded for his enemy not his friend his enemy the same way Jesus was on the cross and said Father forgive them the people never known him to the cross Father forgive them they know not what they do so we talked about being kings and priests this takes it to another level oh that's not so you can just dress some kind of way and look some kind of waste you got your robe none on the fisticuffs while life his enemies and this was this was a young man that don't go to church every Sunday I say man that's nothing but Christ King you reflected I mean you intercedes don't fire him I'm taking his job but don't fire him give him another job the man got a family to take care of oh that thing that's just stop us praying against our enemies get him Lord get him no get you he's made of kings and priests and a priest is one that intercede on behalf of somebody else even Jesus asked the question if you if you pray for those that like you and do this and do that what say what beg have you what you think he done did say when you pray for your enemies oh my god when you when you get to that level you pray for your enemies and I mean brother Branham had a life that was so that you could not tell his enemies from his friends oh we talked about royal priesthood this is what royal priesthood looks like we've been interceding here at this church we've been interceding in and you know I want to say that the Tuesday night prayer meetings every other Tuesday that's been a time of intercessory prayer right that's what priests do they intercede when a person can't stand for themselves I pray for themselves somebody's got to go and intercede on their behalf we couldn't stand before God but I said so Jesus interceded on our behalf right so when people can't do anything then we try to intercede this is this is why we come together of a prayer and and and I just you know just through the Tuesday night amen prayer services I've been just keeping along things that we've prayed about that God has responded to the first time we came a man as brothers not you know and I'm using this as brothers but the sisters were interceding three years before the brothers got there my the sisters are already been interceding right but you know I'm so grateful for the system's catching a burden and then some brothers catching that same burden and not everybody begin to act like priests and the part of sister started there was another group of people that would come in 7:00 a.m. every Sunday morning Oh glory to God I thank God for a couple like brothers sister wisdom then again uh pop a band all the way in Port st. Lucie to get here at 7 o'clock I don't know what time they have to leave a house but they leave them pretty early but they come ask please when they walk you through the doors they walk it in a suite you want to fit every time amen brother Kenny comes from his childhood to come the intercessory box please coming in as a queen when the sisters come in they're coming in it please they're coming in to seat we started interceding we started praying amen and I remember you know our first brothers prayer meeting we were we're praying that God would make a way for other brothers to get here amen and be a part of the prayer services and we you know we were just doing that and and lo and behold the very next time we got together the first brother walked in brother Kenny and when brother Kenny came and then brother Kenny felt loosen it says something he one day he'll testify about it since I'm in here inside they say then it's something in here is it it's something about this plan he'd say I feel rejuvenated I feel something in here hallelujah and God has been doing a mighty work your brother Kenny flash since that time right one night one night we hear and we pray for other brothers are coming we didn't even know but it was a brother after don't knock and trying to get in but we could hear him because we was caught up in prayer God answered the prayers we had a we praying interceding on behalf of those that wanted to relocate to this search we knew God had to open up some doors and make some ways amen and and we were praying and interceding I'll never happened and we come to church one Wednesday night and a brother showed up out of nowhere we have too many brothers here that night I think only brother Jeffery might have been here that night we have two minute and a brother came out of nowhere now you know you got somebody you ain't never seen before in a mystery like okay now okay now okay and we sit here and we just go on through the lesson and everything and we hear the brother back there Sam amen amen now if you sent a man to this word it's got to be something to you so we had to wait it up and after service we greeted the president and when we greeted let me say well yeah I'm from from from up north and I live here and I live there now and I'm and I'm you know I'm just here visiting to say okay well let's go out and have a little fellowship and you know fell should we say well you know actually my intention is to move here to West Palm Beach I say wait we just finished praying about that we just finished interceding on the Hat we never we I met the brother years ago but did not remember him but when he reminded me of where we made ourselves Cal remember that I remember I said well I've been praying I've been trying to I've been trying to move right here God has blessed that pain brother [Music] I'm giving his news before he give it but God has blessed I say brother amen to put a contract on a house in Cypress lakes that's right next door the neighborhood right next door to this church the brother got a contract on the house will be closing on August 31st intercessory plan please when priest pays nothing happens and when the priest plays with confidence recognizing his position in Christ something happens Church the sisters chained as priests and they were here praying for relatives of sister Brown who was medically induced in a coma and when the sisters took on the prayer requests they took it before God God touched the person's body and raised him up out of that condition a hopeless condition but when the priest began to pray as priests we've been praying that God would give us opportunity to win more souls to Christ and I went back and looked a man in the past few months probably by the last two months God has opened up so many doors for us to kind of go in and speak at home going servicing and every time we go in we offer everybody an opportunity to accept Christ we don't give you a chance to raise your hand repeat this prayer to me and if it's something there you go find your way to truth but the priest had been praying and God has been responding let me go on a little further hallelujah I told you about this one already there's a sister that came to prayer one time to the prayer meeting sister's prayer meeting and she hadn't heard from a loved one for months but when the priests begin to pray after the prayer I believe the very next day that love when coal [Applause] one time we come in here praying and one brother caught a burden for the church and for the school and he just as a priest begin to enter feet and that very week that after he prayed that very week we had an opportunity to put in a bid on a church it on a school now we didn't get it but God heard the prayer maybe not that one but God got something else for and priest gunky fan search I'm telling it as as SSS priest it is our job to intercede on behalf of others you want to know another thing that priests pray for the restoration of our loved ones priests afraid and God is doing exactly what the priests of Acts for a week kings and priests I just thought about this royal priesthood and to be a king and a priest according to the Old Testament a king could not be a priest anybody ever read the story Uzziah desire was a king in the Old Testament and he took on the he took it upon himself he got lifted up in his heart right he wasn't supposed to get lifted up God gave him a position as a king and he had two priests the sons of Aaron as as the priests but this King got lifted up as our he had done so many great things he got lifted up in his heart he said I'm gonna stop offering things like the priests offer they wanted to simply start making sacrifices as a king but notice the scriptures say we are kings and priests but here Uzziah as a king took over the role of a priest and he ended up getting struck with leprosy because he got rebuked by a man lift up the priest so that that he got refused a you're not supposed to be doing this desire this is wrong he did not take well to their comments they got a little upset and because he got upset he ended up taking on leprosy you know what else happened when he got became leprous it's fun got an honor to become king so here he was a living King but his son became King because he was a leper and he could not compete couldn't manage the people in leprosy when you took on leprosy you got cast out away from the people oh my but while he was King his son also became king he didn't have to wait for his daddy to die oh my all right can I just read a little something on that out of influence y'all go back y'all read second chronicles chapter 26 verse 16 through 21 you find out about Uzziah Uzziah a man here I want to read this and then I wanted to strike something else this man I was a king but when he tried to take on the office of a priest he got struck with leprosy well how is it that the scripture allows us to become kings and priests all right stay with me let me read this person then we'll give him an answer to that influence we find that as long as the King felt that way god blessed him but when he got to a place that he wanted to not abide in his own calling he wanted to take the calling of something else he thought because that God had blessed him that was alright he could do that but how sadly we make them mistakes how how bad you must absolutely be honest you mustn't you mustn't do nothing less God has directed you to it and proves it and vindicates it and you know that is God that's done it usually man of God God has to run him down and catch the real man of God I like that statement because anybody find something I'm trying to do it something wrong God has to run them down and catch the real man of God it ain't those guys that wants a whole lot of something to do a whole lot with you heart you you heart tell what they went wha what they do with if they received it see but God usually has to catch his man like Moses and Paul and like that to run him down to get glory out of his life to let him become a prisoner to the Holy Spirit listen now we notice that this king and another thing we learn here on Uzziah that when he was called down by the man who had the authority to take the sensor in the consecrated man for the service when he called him down he got angry with him oh what a curse thing that would be when a man tries to point out a fellow that you're in the wrong and prove it to him by the Word of God you're in the wrong and the man because that he feels himself he'll do what he wants to and won't submit to the word then he gets angry you notice what happened to the king leprosy broke out in his face and he was still in his anger leprosy struck his eye on the face and the priest and those recognized it and threw him out of the temple and he died a leper the great life that started out so well ended up to be a leper and cast out and had to live in a separate house to himself all the days of his life the man that the man that the life that God wants influence I say this respect we got men today on the field young men and middle-aged men and old men who started out on a good run and trying to meet a good showing to God but we find them today out yonder alcoholics and broke up out there in the other way from us some of them back split all together some of them have went money crazy and some went women crazy and there's other women that wasn't their wives and all the things and disgrace that's been brought on every denomination we one can't call the other one bad because we're all guilty the whole or every denomination we found men like that that's once that influenced by God and had a great influence to the people and yet when they felt self-sufficient when a man gets the place where he could influence for God he ought to Humble himself all the time constantly we find out this king died in disgrace a leper then he was a lesson to the young prophet not to put his hopes upon any man but to look to God only when he began to look at to a man for an example this man fell yet being a good man so it's a lesson to us tonight to keep our minds upon God regardless of what man it is let him be Cardinal priest prophet whatever he might be he is not immune from mistakes and and even death and sin but there is one who is and that's Jesus Christ he is the one by this isaiah learned a lesson god orders his man to place let me go on it says oh okay i'll leave that right there God ordered this man's to this place now when we when we when we you go back to you read that and second chronicles like I said chapter 26 verse 16 through 21 Uzziah was a king who tried to take the place of a priest and got struck with leprosy but yet the Bible declares that we are kings and priests how could that be the Bible does not contradict itself the answer is found in Revelation 1 verse 5 and 6 we read it last week we'll read it again today the answer is found right there in the scripture of how we became kings and priests this is why we won't get struck down with leprosy verse 5 and from Jesus Christ I could just stop right there the answer is found in Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth on to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood wash means he loosed us from our sins and the reason that we can become kings and priests is because we've been free by the blood of Jesus oh that's power in the blood and have made us kings and priests on the God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen back in use I'd say there was no blood sacrifice but in our day there is a blood sacrifice that's why we've been made kings and priests Oh glory to God now let's go back to the quote that we stopped with last week and I just got a couple more things I want to share with you back to revelation of Jesus Christ out of church days boo all glory church when you just begin to think about the blood the blood the blood you stop thinking about your problem your problem your problem the blood took care of it he has made you a king in the priest now it's time for you to intercede for somebody else the way that people have interceded for you look at this paragraph 35 - 3 he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose listen he brought he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual Kingdom and he goes on says it says in Romans 5:17 but of any man if for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of a gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who have to live it us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom rain of a dishonor right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil I just love that statement right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil Shawn forces his praise and glory Shawn puts himself for it is Christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now I stopped it there last week because we want to focus on the Royal part but today we're folks can focus it on the priests part and look at what it says in the next paragraph and made us priests yes priest unto Him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto Him worshipping Him in spirit and in truth I like that worshipping Him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning priest intercede on behalf of others the priests have been coming in here interceding on behalf of others and God has been honoring their request oh we didn't realize it but we're priests that's why we're doing what we've been doing 7:00 a.m. prayer interceding on behalf of others tuesday night prayer interceding on behalf of others I'm going on I'm going to just precinct Kings untie God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous them to get works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our Father Church I got a two things that I want to read for you out of the scripture you see before of Israel was under the law God gave them grace God gave them a prophet God gave them a number of things and brother Branham say they actually went under the law they accepted law right there in revelation I'm sorry Exodus 19 that's where they took it but Exodus 19 also had a couple other things in it and I want us to read that and then after we read that I want to I want to read one other scripture for you I'm gonna let you go Exodus 19 verse 1 through 8 I believe is where I want to read we are kings and priests a royal precent glory to God glory to God and if you are royal priesthood you can't help but enter feet on behalf of others they man Abraham did it for light when he knew the impending destruction he began to intercede Church we know what's going to happen we got to enter see listen here in Exodus 19 verse one sits in the third month when the children of Israel were going forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came day into the world whistles tonigh Sinai and for they were departed from reffered them and were come to the desert of Sinai and that pitched in the wilderness and their Israel camp before the mountain and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto Him out of the mountain stand us shelled out state to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye are seeing what I did into the Egyptians and how I bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so here God is telling that if you will follow me if you'll just stay with my word the Israelites were totally saying you'll be a kingdom of priests you'll be a holy nation you'll be a peculiar treasure to me and we saw Israel become that and God saying when you read the Old Testament you see all the signs one of the miracles happening amongst Israel primarily Israel God showed me they were a kingdom of priests before they received law Exodus 20 they got law but here David they've got tongue I'm gonna make you a kingdom of priests oh I love this I love this so you're your royal priesthood before before the mistakes before anything you are a royal priesthood now I got something to tell you as we find ourselves over to Isaiah 61 because you are priests you get double for your trouble I was there 61 a week you know we got to get this I you know I think about when I think about double for your trouble I have to think about Joe because of what job went through all the great trials and tribulations and de-stresses but at the end of jokes trial job got double for his trouble and look at this promise in that Isaiah 61 verse 6 but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord men shall call you the ministers of our God you shall eat the riches of the Gentiles and in their glory shall you boast yourselves for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them I'm talking to the priest of the Lord the ministers of our God you receive double for your trouble oh my a king and a priest Oh blessed be the name of the Lord well I'd say that Develin did so much to us but now we recognize who we are and we can know what to expect from God just being a king and a priest that double for your trouble Oh glory to God church I tell you what there's one little statement here that I'm making we'll let this go for the day I told you there's another angle there because I some point in time I want to come back and hit that those presets right the the Aaronic priesthood or what we call a vertical priesthood but how that's changed and we got into the order of Melchizedek right that's the royal priests the order of Melchizedek is the royal priesthood and after Jesus died the Aaronic priesthood ceased oh my but we entered into a new priests lift now the the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek all right unveiling of God this is my last quote oh no no no that's not it that's that's for later give me a let me just find this last one and then we will we'll close it here oh my I thank God that I'm getting double for my trouble a man that devil I'm Rob long enough I'm no longer living beneath my privileges I'm going to tap into these these resources or sources that ain't net and he said they never been tapped in they've never been tapped in so I'm get ready to walk in that church I'm looking forward to it oh my Oh God I think I misplaced this quote if I did it that's fine that's fine and I don't want to misquote it let's see okay here it is the children of Israel isn't it is the title discernment the children Israel says I guess it's not against the law to state and Phoenix hallelujah so I mean praise our God and I think he's worthy of every praise and hallelujah we could wring from these motor lips the Bible saying you are a royal priesthood a peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of your lips giving praise unto Him oh my the fruits of your lips pouring up praise daily before the people what a high priest we have what a priest would that priesthood that we're in the priesthood of the circumcision not of the flesh but of the heart amen the heart circumcised by the Holy Ghost that's right then you can offer praise and adoration to god but spiritual sacrifice your lips pouring out praise unto Him I tell you what when you think about that my hallelujah belongs to you right if it belongs to you Church there was a time the Kings could not be priests but he's told us in this season we are kings and priests and the only way we can come to that is because of the blood don't ever don't ever amen don't ever don't ever don't ever discredit what the blood is done in your life don't care how low you were the blood lifted you up the blood didn't save you grace save you but the blood is what's keeping you safe thank God for the blood let's pray father we've been made kings and priests and and it's because we were washed in blood that we could become kings and priests not just any blood but the blood of your son Jesus thank you for that Oh God when we just look back in Scripture and see how others could not Lord a Uzziah was he got in trouble because he tried to take the office of a priest he was a king that tried to become a priest he got in trouble with you but there was no blood sacrifice for him but today what we stand underneath that and we can look back now and realize that no matter what it is that Satan may think that he has on us the blood has washed us and cleanse us from it so we can walk in our authority as kings and as priests before the Most High God as priests it's our responsibility to intercede and petition on behalf of others and God there are things that occur in life just sharing the testimony of that precious brother who interceded on behalf of his enemy lord help us to realize that's what you've called us to Jesus did the exact same thing when he interceded on behalf of his enemies those that caused him to go to the cross he's still interceded for them now God we've been called to this and we will have to intercede on behalf of those we love and those that are still considered our enemies that's true royal priesthood let it be manifested in every heart god as my prayer know let this just be something that goes in one ear not the other but let it be something that we meditate and reflect upon that it might become a manifestation in our lives if you can just get a hold of a group of people a bunch of people God then you just began to manifest the glories and amen the great things of God the things that have been untapped people have not even seen it yet but God you have it for us and we're ready to walk in it Lord we give you all the glory we give you all the honor we give you all the praise in Jesus name
