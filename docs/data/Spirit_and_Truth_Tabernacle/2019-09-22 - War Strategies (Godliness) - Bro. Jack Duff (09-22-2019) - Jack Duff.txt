thank God to bring us sister Ruth back home safely and to us and thank God for just working everything out a mani agency just knows how to take care of things so we appreciate the Lord Jesus also wanted to just again just thank God for His mighty visitation a man or last Sunday she was and you know just we were here and we have been praying actually for service that Lord give us one of them services by the minister can't even stand the minister you know I put that in the brothers prayer group and you know we we've been praying about that and and God did it God did just that and the last week you know when when God moves the way that he moves like that that is a perfect time for everyone just to kind of enter in and just just allow the Lord just just yield of God you don't know how you'll speak to us and last week you know one of the brothers just began to kind of speak in tongues and while he was speaking of tongues it was praying like lord please give an interpretation you know because we've been in we've been on both sides of this one they speak in tongues and get no interpretation and the other is they afraid to speak in tongues because there's no interpreter we've been on both sides of this and we're trying to get in the middle of it a man so what's supposed to happen and if somebody speaks in tongues everybody should start praying for the interpretation not not wandering is this correct or is this not correct when you do that you actually hand in the Spirit of God right so you started praying God Lord Lord sitting the interpretation if you had anointing this person speaking tongue somebody got to have the interpretation and I guarantee if you begin to pray like that you might be the one that God would use to interpret his words right so you know we were you know I was just encourage everybody shield just yield just yield and and you know and and and and and I know one of the brothers just began to pray and he was praying for an interpretation and and then just brother Troy just began to kind of speak some some words just about freedom about freedom and things like that and and you know so after I heard brother Troy speak what he spoke it it brought a confirmation to me so I called for an altar call for people to come free right and so after service we all kind of got together and talked the rest you know brother Quinton was speaking in tongues brother Troy I believe I got the interpretation it was it was for the people to go free because when you said in a pulpit I knew that was the confirmation to me yes so as God was working on all these ins I said Lord we know that you're doing now what's gonna happen is that God just gonna fine-tune this as we yield you're gonna see God fine-tuning but these are things that we prayed about now it's one thing if you start fixing up your hair and your stockings and you know what I'm saying while I'm trying to preach and then you gotta you got a word from the Lord no we're not talk about that but when he come in like that when he come in like that everybody needs to yield but God moved in this place God moved in this place you don't you never know when you're gonna stop by you never know and I want to encourage y'all y'all better start pressing through everything y'all can the given to the presence of God because what the devil gonna be fighting you in every way he possibly can to stop you from being able to enter in so but we had it we had a wonderful time and I encourage you if you don't haven't had a chance go back and listen to the service you'll be blessed a man you'll be blessed by God's mighty presence a man praise the Lord I want to read a man since I didn't get a chance to preach last week I preached this week they ran by God's grace and I'm okay with not preaching you know like my cousins say I'm content a man a man a man a man she's content but we won content a man a man let's stand Tuffy let's turn in our Bibles to 2nd Peter chapter 1 as we just continue our journey a man a man a man a man a man a man 3 Scott here in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 3 through 10 when I saw brother Larry on Friday I believe what I say when y'all leave when y'all leave Lynette leave he say on Sunday night oh wow put in a worship service I was feeling led to have a worship service but but we understand brother and sister daily so good to see y'all amen and the housework god bless y'all god bless y'all from North Carolina they meant always good to see them in God's house here the Bible says in verse 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue this whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness we'll be talking about that on today a man godliness says and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins where form the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure but if you do these things you shall never fail fall let me give you one more scripture a man here in Matthew chapter 5 a man verse 43 through 48 glory to God Matthew five a man a man man thank you Jesus verse 43 says says ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy that's what you heard it being said but I say unto you love your enemies this is the words of Jesus love your enemies bless them that curse you now this is how heart cuz some of us almost lose our religion when folk curse us huh they man your language bout to change like Peters come on somebody but the Bible declares that we are supposed to bless them that curse thee so if we cursed by some others that god bless you god bless you what god bless you all right now I guarantee you'll change some situations if you do this but I say to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you thank that's something no I mean you ain't you ain't you ain't ready to pray for nobody out there they despitefully use you ain't man but this is what Jesus told us to do right pray for them which despitefully use you're not only that and persecute you amen hallelujah that you made me the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only Lord ain't that's something as you know we walk right by people don't even say god bless you hello and nothing we don't even acknowledge for the world does that type of stuff they won't acknowledge it but you know at some time I see somebody hey how you doing man you don't alright let them know you there hey man hey man its salute your brother and only and and I've seen folk they let's say I'm walking up with my cousin you greet me and don't greet my cousin there's a problem I know my cousin ought to believe it but greet my cousin greet my cousin right here hugged in the way you just love me let them see there's a difference here right I know they don't look like nothing but still greet them anyway if they got breath or a body they deserve a greeting that's how we can win folk right if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for your word that has been read god we pray now that the Holy Spirit would bring clarity to the things that we've read as we continue our journey Lord through war strategies talking about godliness today we pray God that you take control thank you for your anointing that has been here thus far the service and we've enjoyed the specials the work the worship we've enjoyed all of that but now God the word is the most important thing that we come for so now speak to us through your word God as our prayer in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated we want to use a man war strategies godliness war strategies godliness we've just been in this journey a man where we are taking a foundation from the virtues a man of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity we're taking a foundation using that and then going back into the Old Testament and showing where that virtue or that strategy a man was used to overcome in a battle and so I pray that the Lord would just direct us today as we go through war strategy or strategies godliness I want to start did I give you all my quotes I think I might have put it on the table already from last week it might if it's not there then it's in my office just on my desk but I might have put it right on the top there war strategies godliness and if not brothers just checked my desk real quick for it I have it there here's the date that I'll give you a 62 oh you got it okay convinced and then concerned convinced and then concern I want to read the brethren the time is at hand the prophecy says it pays the Christian not to just join the church or to depend upon some maneuver or some sensation or something on that way but to be sure that you're right right it pays for a man the Christian not to just depend on some maneuver or some sensation or something on that way but to be sure that you're right because see you can come to church and shout and then go out and live like a devil right but God has called us to a much higher plane than that a man he's caused to a place where he wants to be manifested a man in our sixteen elements so you know let's go beyond the sensation amen let's go beyond the feel-good Amen let's go all the way into the life of the Lord Jesus Christ he says now there is so much today that we have some allows it to schooling some allows it to learning Creed's some allows it to little funny feelings some allows it to different things which I don't have nothing against that that's all right but that's not what I'm talking about you have that without having the real thing see it said and that's what we're trying to say we must be sure because the time is at hand for the real pouring out of the Holy Spirit he promised he would pour it out in the last days we felt that last week we feel it every time we come together the pouring out that he promised in the last days he goes on to say this now there is so many people say if you quiver a man hold your eyes shut do all kinds of things and get sensation you get spirits friends a man when you start depending on that you get spirits friends he says but if you if your life don't tell you to what your profession then there's something wrong with the spirit to God glory to God see and it's true see and you must be sure the Holy Spirit will bring forth a holy life I say I say amen to that the Holy Spirit will bring forth a holy life that is right and if the desiring is in your heart if you have to force yourself constantly to try to press and do what's right then the world is still hungry in you can I say that again I mean if you got to make yourself live right if you can't live right to the pastor call you or you can't live right to you surrounded by the same steps there's something wrong with your experience a man if that's the way it is with you you got to be able to live right no weapon no matter where you are and if you got the Holy Ghost on the inside it'll keep you huh it'll keep you in Jamaica when you have all by yourself it'll keep you in Africa if you were there all by yourself it'll keep you in San Francisco if you were there all by yourself the Holy Ghost is [Applause] come on somebody a manly I mean when you're in school and ain't nobody looking it's supposed to keep you how were you on the job praise the Lord either keep you from going the happy hour the Holy Ghost to tell you know that in the right place for you to be a man Church Hollow I'm just networking watch that the devil setting you up right a member the Holy Ghost of all to keep you even in business the Holy Ghost keep you you won't work like a shady in business it'll keep you come on church look he says this he says if you have to force yourself constantly right you force yourself constantly to try to press and do what's right that the world is still hungry in you then there's something wrong see the Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for the world the Holy Spirit in you won't hunger for the world it'll hunger for God amen if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open there is something wrong oh I like that that's what that's what I was thinking that's what the prophets say if it's hard for you to get the church man it's just hard for me something's wrong there was a time your life you can wait for the church doors to be open right so when you start lifting I've seen that just kind of wait awaiting away something has gone wrong somewhere praise the Lord any high listen he said there's something wrong with that spirit it's trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship yes sir see so you've got to be sure this now the time is that him if I could just encourage you do your own personal evaluation amen and make sure that you you you where you need to be in God you know sometimes we get blessings and we actually get further away from God we really got blessings with this I mean I I learned a long time ago as God give me more I'm giving him more I'm trying to find more to give him more time more that's my ask God give me more I got to give him more praise the Lord this is not this should not work the opposite God just blessed with this and you testify about two blessing and then we can't see you in church Oh hallelujah glory to God somebody but we are you know we want to make sure that we do a self-evaluation a checkup and then just make sure that we're on the right path it's not just about a feelings not about an emotion a man what are you doing after that feeling all that emotion comes upon you what life are you live in then that's what we're watching let's go onto this message the statue of a perfect man the prophet makes this comment says but if you got genuine faith then put genuine virtue to it since then genuine knowledge then genuine temperance then genuine patience glory to God it says see you're moving right on up the line all right fifthly at godliness since oh my god leanness to be at it what does godliness mean since I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeffrey's there we found it in a dictionary godliness means to be like God it's a very simple simple definition godliness means to be like God and and as brother Branham was just kind of teaching on this when it's preaching the message the statue of a perfect man he took us to two scriptures one is gonna be in what we just read in Matthew chapter 5 and the other is going to be Ephesians 4 but as he talked about about this virtue godliness it many took us to these two scriptures and just made a few comments on try to get some of that today but it says first godliness means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue knowledge temperance patience then like God glory to God didn't then be like God that is our objective to be like Jesus amen I'm not trying to be like my brother I'm not trying to be like my sister I'm trying to be like Jesus in many sense you say I can't do that brother branham it says so yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute here Matthew 5:48 will take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says ye are gods jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in God Oh hallelujah all the things that same God is in you hey man Matthew 5:48 he says be a jesus speaking in a beatitude being therefore PE RF EC T what's that perfect even as your father not just you know I gotta inject there just for a little bit because you know we'll use these comments you know nobody's perfect we can't be perfect you know and and and you know and we just we just we harp on that you know I saw somebody post something like that I couldn't like it I couldn't know in the scripture right amen I think I get what you trying to say Amen but you got to be careful with what you putting out there hallelujah because hallelujah can I can I just tell you if you're not balancing what you stand with scripture don't say it right if you ain't balancing it with scripture just don't say it because cuz it's very easy for somebody said now what about this scripture right here right you're saying you can't be perfect but Jesus said to be perfect hallelujah Lord Jesus says if they say this is a mandate this is the commandment we must come to perfection let me just put it this way if you're not perfect you will not door in the rapture I mean if you if you don't reach this status then you won't go in the rapture what we need to do is always look at our sin side look how am I meant or not when it comes to these virtues how am i expressing this to my fellow man I think as it pertains to these virtues because business was bringing me to perfection let's go on let's read this now cuz I got some cool cyma give you and a manager says you say say PE RF EC T what's that perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect you got way up here now before you ask to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness sons and daughters of God that's right how many things I could say along that line now he goes on and and and he reads Ephesians 4 let's just read that really quick because you know he brings this in he brings Matthew 5 and he brings he fusions for when he's talking about perfection godliness a man is being like God it's coming to a place of perfection and he brings ephesians 4 11 through 13 we'll just read this glory to God amen just for you know just so we see what what the ministry is even all about alright glory to God verse 11 says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers hallelujah right so God gives us these gifts a man and and they have a very specific purpose the reason that God gives us this we come to this distance earth imperfect a man we come amen into the world speaking lies amen we we come boring and seeing but but God has to give us a mint some things to help bring us to perfection amen when God is using a sermon to come from the pulpit that's not something just to go in one ear not the other remember God is trying to get something to register down in your spirit man that it might bring you to a place where God can be pleased with the life that you live in hallelujah amen we gotta understand that amen life is not a picnic there will be some tests there will be some trials and in the midst of every testing and the myths of every trial God is trying to see how you gonna respond email hallelujah he goes on to say this to Paul says further he says he gave some some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints so so so so your past has been given to to you to help bring you to perfection Oh y'all ain't get it a prophet was given to you to help bring you to perfection glory to God amen in tongues him interpretation of tongues are brought into the church to keep the church clean amen it's bringing us to a place of perfection the fivefold ministry is designed not to pick on you but to because you know Jesus amen for the perfecting of the Saints you might fit may he just always after me yes God see some menu and he wants to bring you to perfection [Applause] hallelujah amen if he didn't love you he wouldn't be after you come on search for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry so I love this I love this I love father and I'm going to tell you another thing I can appreciate folk that got respect for ministry I can appreciate that when you know you ain't that you ain't you doing something you weren't supposed to do and then a minutes to happen to walk by and you feel a different way I actually appreciate you feeling that way hallelujah right because if you didn't feel that way something would be wrong amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so the ministry supposed to bring you to this place and we're gonna do that by using what the prophets saying not just our thoughts not just ideas but let's go and use what the prophets saying amen now I want to just also let me read a little quote here y'all just bear with me I got a little bit to say Amen this is coming out a massive statue of a perfect man a brother branham is commenting on these scriptures that he just read it says let's turn to Ephesians 4 and find out over here what in the book of Ephesians it says about this thing - about how we should how we should do Ephesian the fourth chapter and begin with the 12 first Ephesians 4 begin with - a verse alright let's begin he says up here at the eleventh verse says he gave some apostles and some prophets now notice it makes a statement remember last night don't try to take the other man's office now now he says this while he's why he's teaching statue of a perfect man it says remember last night don't try to take the other man's office now I'm gonna i'ma stop there I was gonna read on but i'ma stop there if he's telling us to remember last night well what did he say last night right so so when we were me when we went back a man we saw that brother Brandon preached a sermon the influence of another right when they say remember last night he's talking about the influence of another you know you can get underneath the wrong influence oh lord help us here amen you can get underneath the wrong and plus a husband can get underneath his wife's influence a wife to get underneath her husband's influence the children can get underneath their parents influence and people forget to be influenced by the Word of God huh you know so so he's preaching this amen the influence of another what is what is what is referring to is Isiah because that was his that was his scripture that he was using amen Isaiah the King was under the influence and I'm sorry there the prophet was under the influence of a king King Uzziah Oh hallelujah you got to learn you cannot put your trust in any man because he will fail you every time you Trust has got to be in God hallelujah you can't discourage with a man get discouraged you can't get discouraged with another one and get discouraged you gotta be determined to keep pressing on because your confidence it's an almighty call and I'm gonna tell you this man may fail but God will never fail brothers you give up wanna keep pressing on but sometimes we are underneath the influence of another we do things based on what this person said we haven't even checked the Word of God [Applause] right even if they religious are yelling with me even if they religious you can't be under the influence can I preach this for a little bit there was a prophet in first Kings 13 went into the city and prophesied God told him when you go prophesied don't you sit down and eat with nobody when you go into the city go out a different way don't fellowship with nobody you know the Prophet did he when I was sitting away he went have a different way but why he was on his way going he got caught up by a man two young men they were sons of a prophet they said my daddy wants to invite you to come in and eat with us no I'm not supposed to go I'm not supposed so so some kind of waiting the daddy shows up to to this prophecy I'm a prophet too I'm a prophet too and God told me to tell you to come to my house be careful you bringing yourself underneath their fuel influence of another you better stay with what God told you to do [Applause] Jesus went back to the house under the influence of this older prophet sat down got his belly full ain't real good licking his fingers and after you lick this last finger Ravi stood up and did water Papa sighs [Applause] see that's the way the devil do you sexual and after you done did wrong they rise up and let somebody prophesy and then the mayor promised silence because you came home to eat with me it's gonna be a lion wait for you on the side of the road and don't matter which road he took home no matter no matter when he left to go home he might a waiter to hold three months maybe thinking God forgot but a lion gonna meet you on the side of the road prophesied and when he got the long side road guess what a lion met him he was under the influence of another hallelujah you got to stand at influence of what God's Word speaks to you a man even man see so so so here he stole my Isaiah because Isaiah as a as a as a prophet is influenced by this King Uzziah you know he was a godly man but you sire got to a spot where he did something that he wasn't supposed to do he and when brother Branham say remember last night don't try to take another man's office Uzziah try to take the priests office Oh y'all y'all ain't hearing me amen can you know you you you you know you might desire to be in an office but you gotta wait for God to put - they're yelling with me don't don't don't don't try - don't try to manipulate and navigate to put yourself in places that God actually called you - a man you might desire that but you gotta wait for God I'm a living witness amen and i'ma tell you something you know that I could I could go back in my in my in my younger days and you know now when I would go to funerals and things like that I sit there and now when I go when I went to the funeral I want just what's just there just for the you know just for the person that was being buried I'm watching everything at the funeral right I'm watching everything now I say you know what one day I might have to sing I need to be prepared you know one day I might actually have to preach a funeral I need to be prepared now I don't know when that day gonna come I'm not I'm not waiting on the next feeling to go knock on the funeral directors door say do you need a preacher see that's that's you pushing yourself come on right that's you pushing yourself it's one thing for you to call them it's another thing when they call you when they call you God has placed it on their heart to get in contact with you but when you call then you trying to push yourself and sometimes you can get ahead of God by pushing yourself you create no problems I know I'm preaching this morning I know I'm preaching that's why God blessed our last week he knew this message was coming [Music] amen don't try to take the other man's office hallelujah you gotta wait on God man you got to learn the wait on God I mean you get one person you know let's start preaching the gospel next thing you know everybody feeling anointing God Comey [Music] you got to wait on the Lord get somebody learn how to play the piano and you know one little note C and you ready to play no that ain't the way this thing work what you doing behind the scenes what kind of time you spinning can you play like David when ain't nobody looking only thing here you as a bear a lion but you and the will this just playing why you watching sheep you play in praise God be faithful over a few things God will make you ruler over many but don't try to take the other man's office you sire try to take the office of a priest and when he did he end up contracting leprosy right you know because he actually got in the way of I mean this was a god called office and when it went up when the Bible say he gave he gave that mean God gives God gives a man I know what I'm talking about here this morning it's got to be God a man's gift will make room for himself and before a great man but when you see people scheming and conniving and doing a yoga spirit just facts you can't do it that way and expect God to bless it don't try to take it another man's office right so so you know I looked at I was just looking at this I said watching King Uzziah try to take the place of an anointed priests and and he ended up dying a leper see you sire got out of his place and the Prophet mentioned in that message influence of another because it would be a good one for you to go back and listen to the influence of another 1962 10 13 he says I says the mms says the prophet mentioned that men and women were also getting out of their place so here that prophet got out of his place you know men and women today I starting to get out of a place you got to know your place in a household a husband got to know his place the wife got to know her place praise the Lord a man the wife follows the husband not leads them amen the wife gotta always find myself subjecting not leading praise the Lord Amen glory to God right I mean you got to you got to know these things because when things get out of chaos if it starts at home out of chaos you'll bring that to the church and then we gonna have problems cuz God and colder women to lead the church can I say that again God did not call the women to lead the church I'm saying a lot here today we're trying to be like gods amen praise the Lord don't try to take another's place a man Church all right all right we you know we're not when I met we you know we pray that God would send us the right people for the right positions I will not put nobody in position just because you understand I'm watching things things that I might not even tell you I'm watching but I can't and let me tell you another thing when God gives these gifts Lord help me to get back to my thought but when God gives these gifts God they were already born with certain qualities leadership is something you born with it ain't something you go to school in a quiet how you know that let's talk about them bucks brother branham tells us about some ducks right he said they all pulled on the same link praise God they all bought on the same link and at a certain time of year every duck knows they have to get off that Lake and start heading south and he say there's one done praise God let's go and just beginning say huh huh huh and the other ducks can identify with the anointed leader and when they when they hear is something about his honk there might be other dogs honking - but is something about his huh God gave him a different hump than they gave you so I don't care how much you Hulk I'm not travel with I'm listening to that huh and when he said go south brother I'm on my way south you better know what doctor follow him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and you are born with the hunk don't try to take another's place don't try to take another man's office don't do it hey man that's why I said a few weeks ago we got one deacon now we believe in God from oh but until they come you follow let me tell you another thing about a good leader what you say a good leader will always be a good follower if you can't follow ain't no way ain't no way you gonna lead I'm a living witness I still follow my pastor and I have expressed that and lived at in front of y'all for years any time I go to underneath his church I'm not trying to rule nothing I follow what you need brother wesco yes brother wesco sure brother Wescoe I may not agree with it gree with it but I'm still yes brother wesco yes brother Wescoe I learned how to submit myself humble yourself in the sight of God and He will exalt you see men and women also getting out of a place the nation is losing this place to brother Branham saying all that and this it talked about how this this young lady was sent home from school because she wore shorts to school back in his day she wore shorts in and in school they saw her with the shorts on say um this is not appropriate home home that was in his day and then also in his day he said times change because then there was some there was a there was another young lady expelled because she wouldn't wear shorts to school parents had to go to court because they didn't believe that right he said times were just change day the nation was getting out of this place the daddies was getting out of their place a husband's getting out of a place wives getting out of a place you got to understand your place if you don't know read it in the Bible but everybody got to find a place a man a man sisters should always prefer to brothers when it come to leadership always always sister should not be trying to push yourself to lead nothing now that something sisters need to take care if we understand that but if a brother kind of you know and that you should always kind of prefer that brother because that's his role a man now and I know and I know that the other side discusses up some other brothers don't sometimes some things we don't know what we doing and just because you're a man you ain't got the kind of show ever say I'm a man I'm here you don't even know nothing about nothing praise the Lord so I want to keep a balance that but the sister should act in a way what she's preferring him you know brother I respect you and you know you you cuz you lead in prayer could you this could you that could sister should always be doing that always a man a man glory to God alright I'm coming I'm coming let me uh let me just read this quote out of influence for another look at this the profit makes this statement and the same sir me says remember last night so this is what was happening last night right the influence of another it says when you're playing a ballgame as as it's football season is this an appropriate quote when you're playing a ball game as it's football season the things we want to do is is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it he is trying to guard that man protect him let him get through right we're trying to make a goal see but but could you imagine a team so untrained glory has to find one man their own man with the ball running to the field goal now you can tell brother branham didn't follow sports like a man running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it every man trying to take the ball out of his hand while you're bound to lose seven today we have the same thing when we see God come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's let's use our influences as tackles not runners now you know I played football let me finish reading this as tackles not runners tackles that protects to run them lets him pack the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running we should be tackles now you know if you understand football you know that that is a position in football a tackle that's a position guards and tackles we have that but but but the other thing about a tackle when I was playing football everybody that come out for the team want to be either the quarterback the running back y receiver they want to do something that that shines y'all ain't gonna work with me they want they want to do something that gets a teach nobody want to be no tackle you know a tackle don't get no attention he gets no commercials huh he I mean that nobody even knows his name but if he wasn't on the team the team would not win he's extremely important he protects the quarterback he opens up holes for the for the running back to go through right if that tackle was not doing his job no way that team were we so what we need him brother and say we me tackles not quarterbacks not wide receivers not running backs tackles and if I was on the defensive side of the ball amen the tackle would be the one that's right over the ball amen he's on the front line getting him he's the first one to get here the linebacker just stand behind these guys and read what is going on the safety in the quarterbacks can just read everything but this guy could get hit soon as they say hi he's gonna get hit brother and say we need tackles anybody ready to get hit right how many want to be a no-name some writers say I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody that can save anybody we all need to learn to beat tackles hallelujah humble yourself become a tackle all right let me let me go on and talk about perfection the Prophet made this statement we read it early I just go back and quote it out of thinkers paragraph 299 and in a statue of a perfect man around paragraph 301 so this godliness means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue knowledge temperance patience then be like God Wu says you say I can't do that brother Branham says oh yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute Matthew 5:48 will take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says ye are gods jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you Matthew 5:48 so now he's referring there so again he refers to Matthew 5:48 he refers also to Ephesians in Man chapter form and and there in Matthew 5:48 says be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect we're called to this perfection this is what godliness is all about being like God a man and he makes a statement I'm gonna go on to a couple quotes here oh my it makes a statement out of the message the Lamb's Book of Life says now the but these worshipers who came under the shadow could never be made perfect says les dwell on that word there never were offered year after year continually make the comers unto perfect says I won't you says haven't you heard many times that people say oh there's none perfect that's right you can't be perfect in the sight of your fellow man and I think that's not problem we're trying to reach perfection in the sight of a brother or another sister look let me tell you some I'll never be perfect in your sight and I want you to know something else you will never be perfect in my sight but it's not based on your site or my site this is based on God's sight all right he says haven't you heard many times that people say oh there's none perfect that's right you can't be perfect in the sight of your fellow man but you've got to be perfect or you'll never go to heaven the Bible said Jesus speaking in Beatitudes Matthew said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect then you've got to be just as perfect as God is or you're lost now how you gonna do it see now one little mistake and you lost sense one little flap of the eye and you're gone because nothing can enter into those into those places but perfect it goes on God put Satan up there one time as an angel which he was the son of the morning and he took the good things of God and perverted them to evil into evil God sure that nothing will enter there that'll do that I'll ever do it again so you cannot take the good things of God and pervert them to evil can I go a little further if God has given you abilities God has blessed you with certain gifts and characteristics you cannot give those gifts and characteristics to the devil and convert or pervert them for evil what God of do is take his hands off of you a male a man a man your talent belongs to God your gift belongs to God you cannot pervert it and give it to the devil hallelujah says God that's what that's what Satan did at the beginning and that's why he would endure as he got kicked out of heaven and he'll never ever have a chance to go back look at this says God sure nothing will ever know nothing will enter there that I ever do it again see now you've got to be perfect Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now how you're going to be when you continually singing how you're gonna be perfect you just keep on sinning over and over and over again how you ever gonna get perfect but Jesus said be perfect right you continue to sin when you're continually doing what's wrong you can't right leave here and go do something wrong so now this would kind of put a a little kink in a legalist but notice it wasn't it wasn't you it isn't what you do it isn't what you do it's what God has done it's not what you do it's what he done see you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in Christ you are perfected I like that in Christ I am perfected since you're not trusting in your own good works all your own church you belong to but you you're trusting in the shed blood of the Lord Jesus there you are that's what makes you perfect that's what anchors your faith it's not what you do but it's what he's already done oh my goodness the Bible says in Hebrews 10:14 by for by one offering for about one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified thank God for what Calvary produce it produced the perfection inside of us you're already perfect because he's not looking at what you've done he's looking at what he did let me go a little further let me go a little further this this message law and oh Jesus yes I got a couple of these just just bear with me actually you know what Israel in the church let's go nope no I'm going back to LA I'm gonna read this since now the blood could not perfect could not be perfect by any animal but the blood in Christ was perfect now I will never be perfect and you will never be perfect and I will never be perfect in your sight you will never be perfect in my sight but let's lay it lay that aside what about in God's sight I look at you as a human I look at you as a brother but God looked at you through the blood of his son as a redeemed one see says Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and not what you've done you haven't you have nothing to merit it but it's what Christ did for you says oh do you see it for about if these offerings would have continued why we would have we would not have needed any more sacrifice but for the worst worshiper once purged let that sink way down deep since the worshiper once purged will have no more conscience or desire of sin right so if you truly been purged by the Holy Ghost you won't even have a desire for sin right it said it says if these really purge you know what purging anything is if it has been purged to believer once purge has nobody that moves no more desire sin it should been he says so therefore the blood of bulls the bulls and goats the burning sacrifice was the life went to meet the Creator as an animal creation says but the life that came from the blood cell of the Son of God was none other than God himself who had come down and was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the great Jehovah blood of God but there's no other male but God and in God's a spirit that I says the the the great yoga there was human not human life it was God's life the Bible said we're saved by the blood of God for there's no other male but God and God's Spirit it couldn't have been actually sexual it had to come supernatural that's why his church believes in the supernatural go on and a man that's ever confessed his sins standing laying his hands on the head of the dying lamb Christ and look to Calvary can never be the same no more that's right for by one sacrifice Hebrews 10:14 for by one sacrifice he had perfected forever those that are sanctified or cleanse by the blood of the Lamb i'ma stop there but you know I was just thinking on that you all know I read you the quote where brother branham talked about this it's a little mayor a man that might be born in a family and you know it's thinking to himself you know he's he's maybe disfigured and and just just all messed up and maybe brother Bram said if he could talk to his Monson mama when I go to church today I know they're gonna kill me because I ain't worth nothin I look like this and I look like that I ain't worth nothing I know they're gonna kill me as a sacrifice today and I must say no son you ain't got to worry about nothing I don't care what you look like you ain't got to worry about nothing because you were born as the firstborn there is a promise on you right and there's a there's a there's something else got to take your place because you firstborn oh my right so what happens that should say the priest won't even look at you the priest gonna look at this other sacrifice amen and I want to tell you tonight I mean this morning God is not looking at you but he's looking at the sacrifice of Calvary that was made for you a man walk underneath that perfection Oh hallelujah can I just read you something else Israel in the church look at what he said I'm gonna Street these statements I can't read the whole quote but you can go back and get it says God has already glorified his church now y'all with me God has already glorified his church that mean you ain't working towards this it's already happened through the blood that was shed at Calvary is cross God has already glorified oh my god is already glorified this church those who he justified he also glorified in the church in Christ if you're justified in Christ you're glorified in Christ already as far as God is concerned jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ tonight every born-again Christian is perfect oh I like that every born-again Christian is perfect I'm just that's perfect and God as Christ was and you know brother Brennan you know brother Brendan lied about the taxes and that he went in the house when the man called not the taxes but but in the house being in the house he told the truth out the taxes but but he lied when the man called say you know can I speak to brother and said tell him I'm not here but this same man is saying that I'm just as perfect as God was that perfect in God as Christ was not think about that now not that he lied and just never repented he lied and he repented right a man we got some repentance or two but I understand that the devil can't hold that over your head once it's under the blood search it is under the blood hallelujah once you confessed it don't allow the devil to bring it back up again and you walk in your perfection I'm not looking at me Satan I'm looking at him and not only that God not looking at me God's looking at him let me let me go forward here this is let me switch gears for you in a second says I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was you are to every other believer for it's not my holiness it's his holiness God can't accept mine I have none but I come in Christ by faith and by Christ I'm by Christ I'm in him and perfect in the sight of God see so when you know we can't use the term that I'll never be perfect right you'll never be perfect you're only talking about in each other sight but underneath God's sight we're standing perfect already glorified justified just as if we've never done it in the first place we ought to think off a blood like that blood that can cleanse us like that how we how we certainly appreciate the Lord Jesus Oh God so brother branham took us to Matthew 5 and it told us to be perfect as Christ was perfect that's that's what as his father was perfect that's what Matthew 5 told us and and as I was just kind of meditating on that because this is what godliness is all about Amen this is what godliness is all about it's bringing us to look exactly like our Father in heaven be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect this is what brother Branham felt led by the Holy Spirit to go to the scripture and so as I was just meditating on this and we're dealing with this war strategies I just began to just kind of think about Lord now who what strategy could we go to inscription amen where this might have been applied praise the Lord and as I was just praying and seeking the Lord God took me to a particular scripture there was a war happening I'll give it to you you already know the story it's in 2nd Kings chapter 6 starting at verse 8 and I'm only gonna read a little bit of this and I'll give you the a man just the highlights a man 2nd Kings chapter 6 I'm sorry starting at verse 5 let's go to verse 5 is that right Oh hold on ma I'm in the wrong verse verse 8 2nd Kings chapter 6 verse 8 says since then the king of Syria war against Israel so we know that this is a war that's happening war against Israel and took counsel with the service saying and such in such a place shall be my count hallelujah that the king of Syria wants to battle with Israel and now verse 9 says and a man of God sent him to the king of Israel saying beware that thou passed not such a place for the other the Syrians are come down hallelujah God had a prophet in the land that could actually tell the King exactly what was getting ready to happen so every time the king of Syria went were playing a strategy in his battle hallelujah God will over overcome that strategy by revealing to the Prophet what was going on the Prophet was shared with the king and the king of Israel with a man constantly avoid trouble because he was listening to a prophet I want to tell you something you will also constantly avoid trouble if you'll just listen to a prophet hallelujah somebody Amen but but here we see them you know just trying to find what is going on why why every time we go and I'm just kind of summarize this every time we come up with a strategy God just kind of Amen I mean if this King is not where we expected him to be right so so so the king of Assyria a man I'm in the king of Syria he got a little discouraged he got a little upset about this sin and later on the scripture we found where he gathers his his leaders together and he says who among us is a spy who among this group is a spy you know why is it that every time we go down here we can never find this king and then an attempt send our king I want to tell you say there is no spy so put up your sword don't kill anybody you put this water because there is a spa but what I will tell you is that they got a profit in the land he said that profit is revealing the very things that are happening your bedchamber hallelujah he say say say that prophet of death so the king says now where is this profit let's let's go to his house and and we take care of the profit that I guarantee we'll be able to defeat Israel it gets his coordinates together I can see him put them in his GPS and he marches his army down a man to the prophets house Oh hallelujah glory to God church and as they get down there amen to the prophets house it's the Prophet is there and brother branham say that Elijah was just so cool I like that statement right because you got to learn how to just keep your cool when you're under stressful situations and then you got to learn how to keep your cool with the devil store and everything gets you you gotta learn how to keep your cool huh don't don't don't don't lose it don't lose your top when the devil's throat listen throwing that keep your cool he say say loud you're just just just just just cool and he said so so so jahaziel servantis is there and Gahan Xia's is it's waking up in the morning looked at me see that all these chariots and horses and and warriors all around the house and brother branham say they slipped in at night they slipped in at night now I like this right because when the enemy is slipping in at night that's what he doing at y'all when you sleeping he's slipping in why are you sleeping he planning soon as you wake up he got something to throw at you he's slipping you wake up in the morning why where did this from right he's slippin in at night but I want to taste something when the devil is slipping in at night God is already prepared for God is already ready for him Oh hallelujah when he trying to slip in and and make me surprise you God was surprised the devil see God already knew what he was about to do and not only did God already know what he's about to do but but the reason it be life that could be so calm it's because he knew God had a plan I want to tell you something oh my god when Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus God already knew what he was about to do hallelujah he went going down there just to play games but God knew that he would raised Lazarus from the crane when Jesus was in the midst of 5,000 that did not have any food God already knew what he was about to do when he got amongst 4,000 that didn't have any food God already knew what he was about to do I don't know what you're facing this morning but I can't tell you this God already knows what he's about to do praise God God already knows how he's gonna change it God already knows how he's gonna fix it God already knows what he's about to do nothing catches God by surprise here the Prophet is there and just you know just relaxing drinking his coffee eating his toast not even worried about this great army that surrounded his house let's listen I want to just kind of pick this up in Scripture we're gonna skip forward a little bit amen verse 15 oh my for 14 verse 14 look at this Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah since I therefore sinned he did the horses and chariots and a great hosting that came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and go behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and a servant said unto him at last my master how shall we do so he's a little a little frustrated like what are we gonna do about this Elijah how we gonna get ourselves out of this they got to surround it they got to encompass how're we gonna get out of this right and he says verse 16 says an answer and any answer fear not can I tell you all the same thing you might feel surrounded this morning but fear not powers of Beals all around you fear not they threatened to take your house fear not why because you paid your ties and there's a promise that he will rebuke the Devourer for your sake so just confess the word of God over your situation and fear not hallelujah fear not for they that be with us not a prophet could say this because he was seeing something that the young man was not seeing hallelujah glory to God he says he says fear not for they that be with us I'm more than thing that be with them great is He that's in you than he that's in the world hallelujah church right so so so so now now we need winning winning when he said that Eli's just speaking of sahaja God's like how could he speak words like this then then Eli sure had to pray a prayer hallelujah amen and this prayer brought forth the manifestation and immediate manifestation in Kahala situation where he can see something that he wasn't seeing before and the reason I say that God already knows what he's about to do those angels were there Wow the enemy's army was there even the enemy didn't see the angels of God there Oh even the enemy doesn't realize what God has so here you try to surprise attack me here you trying to come against me but God I got my back [Music] God got my sides God is covering the front God is covering all around me my enemy could not even see the Angels down you can if you could ever just get a glimpse in that realm look at this now look at what he say see ya Elijah once gajala they have the same piece but it's kind of hard for him when he's just looking around and see I'm surrounded I'm surrounded I'm surrounded but look at this he says he likes you prayed said Lord I pray the open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw now what was he looking at now he didn't see the armies the enemy's army he couldn't see that y'all stay with me he couldn't see that he just couldn't see God's army see this is why I told y'all last week some started for the angel of the Lord and campus round about them that fear him and does what delivered them from all their troubles hallelujah now he could see Amen the natural army but he couldn't see the spiritual army you know brother branham makes some comments here you know it's and we don't we gonna read this a little bit more in Scripture and say some people say he say spiritual blindness is worse than natural blindness spiritual blindness he says so what happened this man was spiritually blind to what God was doing and say now when we read about this army they also had natural eyesight but they're spiritually blind to who the Prophet was now you know you can have the same thing today people can have the same Bible and be reading out the same Scripture you read now but be spiritually blind to who God sent them look at this verse 17 he launched the praetor said lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see in the Lord open eyes at a young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots a fire round about Elisha now you know he likes you types you but put yourself in the scripture you got mountains I mean you got you got you you got mountains that you faced and where their horses and chariots of fire all around you for your protection look at this and when they came down to him Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said smite this people but can you match they smite this people glory to God I pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha oh I think so much that I can see how I'm just I'm running out of time he smote it according to Elijah's word so would it be like you say he acts for blindness that's what he got what did you ask for what that's what you gonna get don't change it you know how to profit dip when them three squirrels was coming he almost changed it lord I thank you for - no no no no no God had a telling you the next 102 you acts for three and I don't care how long you got to wait you wait for the third one verse 19 and Elijah said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city the GPS coordinates let them to Elijah's house they knew this was supposed to be the place but yet they're blind to see the Prophet now they can see but they can't see him they can see to think they said enough to follow wherever he's leading them right and then I know they're not on getting lead I'm sure let's see where he led them let's just read this let's read this let's see what let's let's see where he lied she took him they follow in a very man that they went looking for the kill but God blinded them to him I want to tell you that some people blind it to see the world in this day Oh glory to God let's read this verse verse 19 says and Elijah said in them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and I will bring you to the man whom he seek but he led them to Samaria and it came to pass when they were come now you got to get this in your mind Elijah walking a man right towards Samaria not eat some areas this is where the Israelite King was living with a I mean they were these are the people that are that that God was that the King in Israel was being protected from the Syrians but here they are marching probably one by behind the profit right down into Samaria and then they come in like they came this is so much that they miss they missed that this was the profit they missed that they were actually in the enemy's camp there's many things that they missed God know how to do things but look at this look at this lets you know first 20 cents and it came to pass when they were coming to Samaria that Elisha said Lord open the eyes of these men oh my god that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of Samaria now I don't even know these men are probably afraid now how did this stop him the very I mean we come to kill the man to stop this man from from from from from defeat in the army but now we end up right in the midst of the Israel army with no plan of attack how did this happen I mentioned the first scriptures that you know the Bible tells us you know we've heard it said to hate those that that hated us but Jesus said I'm telling you to love them that hate you you know if you want to just love those that love you what what think have you what you doing different from what everybody else - he said no no I want you to love your enemies and then he goes on to say 10 she say he say now be perfect as my father in heaven is perfect he uses all of that material to tell us be perfect this is what God is looking for from us so when your enemy is in your myths and God has brought them to you what is your response is it godliness or hatred remember from yesterday hatred has an in but love is eternal so in your spirit if hatred is rise enough then there's something wrong Oh God you set my enemy to not for you to get revenge I said show anything now Amen to see what you're gonna do with your enemy because when Jesus has his enemies surrounding him at the cross he said Father forgive them they know not what they do oh come on church see you know it's easy to shout when we think we we got the enemy defeated but it's another since one thing with you know the Bible say you know he will you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies but I got a question for you today can you prepare a table for your enemies [Applause] [Music] this is what godliness is all about I was wondering what scripture connects to this here it is which watch what happened in this verse first win again a came to pass when they were coming to Samaria that Elisha said Lord open the eyes of these men that they may see in the Lord open their eyes they saw him behold there were in the midst of Samaria and the king of Israel city of kunti Elijah when he saw them my father shall i smite them he was so excited maybe pulled out its wart father Elijah shall I slay them shouts murder Elisha types you so what I'm saying this should be your response with your enemies I ain't say with the people you love and can I also say this ain't no brother a sister your enemy there your brother there your sister if they've been washed in the same blood you've been washed in they are not your enemies so don't sit in in your mind yeah that's my don't know that devil lying to you that's not your enemy that's your brother and you need to sometimes speak back to the devil no that's my brother that's my sister king of israel said unto elijah when he saw them my father shall i smite them sure let's make them and he answered thou shall not smite then put your sword up what is now smite those whom thou has taken captive with our sword and with that Bo look at what he's saying set bread go cook a meal for your enemy that's it but be perfect as my father in heaven is perfect set bread and water to refresh them make sure they get a good meal let them lick their fingers set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink then after they finish where they going to their man well now when they go to master what you think these folks gon say what you think they gonna say by the time they get back to the master and start sharing this great testimony I can almost assure you they wouldn't want to come and fight no more actually your enemy just became your enemy just became your friend you want Ohio Amy became your friend by your actions verse 23 says and he prepared y'all know I'm I'm gonna skip over that part he prepared for vision I mean he emptied his covers I'm again I'm gonna give him motive what you asked for hmm he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the hands of Syria came I mean so the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel see if you gonna love them that love you you really ain't done nothing but if you can love your enemies now we talked about godliness remember one time I'm closing I'm getting ready to leave here I remember one time brother branham was in the car thing goes with brother Perry greening and he was talking about it's just sharing and so let me clarify this it's one thing to gossip it's another thing to share gossip you're actually trying to test somebody's character down but sometimes you just got to share truth this is what happened I'm not I'm not trying to say that stories you can stop fellowship with them because you know you know people do that right you know people do that you know if something something happens you know that what I'm telling this because I don't want you to hang with them to either a man Church that's why I'm telling you this that's gossip that's gossip you know you're trying to in official but you are you know I'm telling you this I'm just telling you truth but I'm I don't want to see your relationship change they didn't do that to you so you don't have no property you shouldn't have no problem with them amen so did this um this brother brother Green was whit brother brother branham and brother Browns tell me this happened that happened this brother didn't me this way and therefore it's just man it was really really something brother and brother green was getting real upset see next time I see them brothers I'm gonna give them some fivefold ministry he was just ready to you know the attack so they driving down the street and brother Brett brother Brandon tell brother Green that he was actually on the street where the brothers leader driving down the street where the RAM say oh this brother saw some house let's go in and greet him the parents say what go in and greet him know the way he did you say brother Perry I didn't tell you that so you can act the way that you acted I was just sharing true with you say but they still are brothers let's go in here and greet them you learn how to love your enemies you know they said they had a statement about God's prophet they say you could not tell his enemies from his friends and if a prophet of God could come to that spot what about the people of God this is godliness and it's not just a sermon to go in one ear and out the other but it's what God is calling us to this is a war strategy so if you had some enemies want to cook a meal I'm tough I give them your best smorgasbord buffet set it in a presence and then send them their way is that all right church war strategies godliness god bless you thus power his we have a prayer request here that we want to acknowledge it for brother Larry and man just one of the relatives there in the hospitals so we want we want to pray amen forth for that a
