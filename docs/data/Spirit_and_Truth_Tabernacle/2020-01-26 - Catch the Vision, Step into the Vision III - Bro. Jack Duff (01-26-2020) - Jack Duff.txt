know yesterday I got a chance to see brother Wes Co he said brother Solomon the Lord surely is faithful he said it to me about 10 times likewise brother Wescoe keep telling me that and that is truly his testimony and I believe you know sometimes ministers well brothers and sisters really get tendered at a time and they they can sense there's a need that you have in your life they just got to give him a word to encourage you and faithfulness was a word that he really pressed into my soul so I thank you very much brother Jeffrey for that special is very timely to me I needed that and god bless you my brother praise the Lord Amen sister Liz I heard you have a testimony about the faithfulness of Almighty God [Applause] [Music] god bless see sounds Loki hope in there brother Jack forgot but he remembered so God has a reason for this um I just wanted to come for the church and just give a small little testimony I know a lot of people see me here I haven't like actually come up and given my like small testimony about what God has brought me through and what he's been doing for me sometimes you see me in the back and I'm screaming and I'm yelling I'm saying hallelujah there's a reason behind it and last Sunday I believe it was brother quake who I don't remember no brother Jack it was a Bible study he was saying sometimes you got to tell people your life story like your testimony and so that they can understand why you're yelling and why you screaming why you're saying thank you Jesus I'm sorry I'm shaking right now um so as many of you guys know I work in an emergency room it's already a very stressful environment when I had first started there it was very difficult getting adjusted I was going through so many things I felt like I just no matter what I did I couldn't fit in there was three people in particular that would like literally like bully me and it was just like so much going on to the point where every small time I walked into work I would have so much anxiety like I was feel like I was gonna vomit and I'm not that type of person like I walk into an environment and I'm really common but for some reason every small time I would walk into there and I know these people were there I just knew that something was gonna happen and it was just it was always trouble in my heart it came it got so bad to the point where they I was sent off the unit I was sent out of the ER for a whole month and I remember I never cried in my life that night I cried that day when my boss told me I'm gonna put you on another floor for a month I called my mom on the phone and I cried I bust out crying I was just like why is this happening to me like I'm really trying to figure I'm really trying to do the best thing but whatever but I I don't like how people are just talking to me any type of way and how they're treating me like this like it's not fair so I was sent off the unit and knows why he sent me off that unit when I was in this other unit I found a family and I built more experience in another type of environment and I remember speaking to brother Jack and sister Erica about it and I was like I think I'm gonna quit and I remember speaking to Rachel's like I think I'm gonna quit like this is just too much and then just sitting down with them and talking to them brother Jack and sister Erica reminded me that this is what I was praying for that God have put me in this place for a particular reason that I was studying really hard to come to this ER and that no one was gonna kick me out unless God wanted me to leave so I told my mom this also and my mom said it's okay all we're gonna do is just pray about it so she had me write down the there names of three names and then we prayed over it and then slowly but surely like things just started happening I came back to the unit in the ER one of the one of the nurses that was bothering me that was bullying me he transferred to another unit the other one that was bothering me she resigned my director that was bothering me she was suspended for a while and I was just like god I don't know what's going on I'm like did I pray too hard but my I see you moving though God I see you moving and ever since I've been back on that unit no one has bothered me it's just it's been God and I'm just so thankful and grateful for everything that he's done and it took a while but it happened just in time when it needed to happen and I'm so grateful for that and the people that didn't know that we're helping me pray thank you for your prayers and I just I just had to give that small little testimony if you're going through something no matter how long it takes you just stay firm and strong you just came to to pray and just know that God will take care of you I just wanted a small little short course soon as I stopped worrying worried in how the story [Music] that's when they start [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Paolo [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Music] let go reco crazy black god they're gone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you [Music] put me on your will No me spend me me and your friend until you see [Music] after

went home to be with the Lord and so they are gonna be doing something here and then I think sometime in February and I'm gonna try to go and be a part of of the the event there and there's a couple of things that are getting ready to come up and hit my schedule and I thought you know I think I was looking at the beginning you're saying got nothing until Easter and then all of a sudden Lord said no you gotta you know this you got that and you know I gotta think a Thursday night and Friday night service that I'll be preaching in in Arizona there and sometime late February as well so just keep us in prayer just trying to do all we can for the Lord and this week amen I'll be taking a short little vacation with my wife and we're gonna go on a cruise and so I won't be here Wednesday night and Sunday a man will be a wave on the cruise so y'all keep us in prayer but I need it I'm gonna show need it yesterday I you know we were there supporting sister Verna's family and you know I got to the church and said Vernon said you know brother Jack and I need you to officiate the wedding I mean that the funeral and then I said okay no problem so I you know I was prepared for that and and when I got the church I was looking for the preacher and he was in Texas so you got the BGE also ready and so we called another preacher that you officiate brother Jack come preach and the Lord Lord helped us you know so we thank God you know and I know that that was a prayer request assistant and she wanted me to be able to speak the sermon there and and and I'm grateful that the Lord gave us that opportunity you know God is God know exactly what he doing he never never made no mistakes like my mother-in-law say no to preacher one in Texas the preacher was in West Palm Beach as a way man so you

a man and just appreciate beautiful they men taking care of the service I've got many great reports I haven't had a chance to view the service yet but I will certainly do that and I'm just grateful for the help that God has given us and grateful that amen I didn't say the church almost exploded at one time and a man so that's that's that's alright that's church that's church we thank God for that amen so let's so let's turn here in our Bibles Genesis 21 is where I want to read from a man and just a couple verses here we're still in this channel of cash division and then step into it a man once you catch it you got to step into it don't don't just sit there and watch it pass you by Amen but get involved get active amen and what the Lord is is presenting to you here in Genesis 21 says in the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did and Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God has spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him from Sarah bare to him Isaac a man praise the Lord let's just stop right there and just have a word of Prayer father we thank you for the word of the Lord we thank you God for your spirit that comes too quick in the word to us we thank you Lord that were able to gather here in this place today and distrust at this the Spirit of God would have the preeminence and this portion of the service thank you for the songs that have gone for the Lord the the worship that has happened father everything that has been done we know that you have been behind it and we just ask God that you would now God get glory out of this portion of the service Lord speak to every heart in this place you know exactly what we stand in need of so Lord minister and only way that you can as our prayers in Jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you you can be seated praise the Lord again catch division and then step into the vision is where we want to focus our attention but if you would just allow me amen before we get to started down that path today a man let me just read something here I want to read from the message the second coming of the Lord and I want to start at paragraph 54 my man in this particular sermon the second coming of the Lord paragraph 54 it reads as follows it says it's later than we think my god and I love this the Prophet makes the statement says we don't come to church to occupy a Pew that's not the purpose of coming to church that's the occupier seat it says we do not come to church to hear a good sermon a man or come to church to hear good music oh that's good but that's not why we're coming to church he says they all got their place but what we better come to church to do is check up with God oh I like this a man we need to come and check out with God and our soul salvation for the day of redemption is near amen and I wanna I'm gonna just stop right there but you know I was just thinking on the spot here this week you know church is like a spiritual hospital amen and we're certainly grateful that we can come to the spirit to hospital and get our our needs met get cared for but just like in the natural amen when you go to the hospital the objective is for you to go and actually change conditions praise the Lord it's not to go in with one condition and then stay in that condition the objective is that the condition would be modified by the time you leave and if you come here to the spiritual hospital today with a particular condition the objective is that the Holy Spirit will take care of your condition before you leave hallelujah church a man we're not coming just to hear good music we're not coming just to hear a good sermon amen but we're coming here to do a check-up with God hallelujah now you know we are we we we had a significant week this week and a man I thought it was very appropriate for us just to kind of talk about something that that occurred and you know just saw you know these people that are doing these things these are just scientists that you don't have kind of come together and they decided to to change the Doomsday Clock that the scientists you know are the ones that they look at certain things that happen here in our earth on the earth and they look at how countries do certain things they they listen to the president's freaking you know they just watch all kind of stuffing and then they decide that we're gonna have to set this Doomsday Clock one way or the other hallelujah there's been times that the doomsday doomsday clock is actually going the opposite way any man if you studied it goes the opposite way but but based on where we are right now they decided to set it and that they put it out a spot that a man that it has never gone before a man it used to be two minutes used to be three minutes there was one time in history was sitting at at twelve minutes and I believe in 1991 I think that seventeen minutes but but they decided to put it less than a minute at 100 seconds hallelujah this is what scientists feel that we're that much closer to doomsday now now now now now I want to go beyond science because as a believer if they are doomsday then I'm looking for options please God interview and you put me at a hundred seconds to how much closer am I to rapture than they are to Tuesday's so if we are that close if science is picking up on it then we asked believers need to pick up on this and we need to do a checkup glory to God I was just reading Amen a little bit here on the internet when I'm talking about this Doomsday Clock this is they say humanity continues to face two simultaneous existence dangers to things that can put us out of existence it says nuclear war and climate change my god say nuclear war and climate change says that a man glory to God let me get this cuz I be preaching for a long time and I gotta put myself on a timer he say he says that are compounded by a threat multiplier it says cyber and amyl information warfare amen hallelujah you know glory to God you know I did these things uh you know when we even look at politics and all that and how things happen people break it into this and break it and Riaan fluence and decisions oh my and then it creates a problem because somebody gets upset how did they do that who did that why did they do that naughty ready to go to war right amen somebody hacked into this and did that from some other country amen it's creating property creates a tension in the world Oh glory to God amen look he said they say compounded by a threat multiplier cyber-enabled information warfare that undercuts society's ability to respond the international security situation is dire this is their statement it is dying not just because these threats exist but because world leaders have allowed the International political infrastructure for managing them to erode now now you know I said early that it was about 17 minutes back in 1991 and that this distance clock was set at 17 minutes at that time you had the US and you had Russia coming to an agreement that they were not going to have any nuclear warfare that they were going to kind of eliminate some of this stuff stop talking about all that so when it wouldn't win with science say they say if they're gonna disarm themselves then we're gonna set the clock to 17 17 minutes but now amen they're looking at something else a man they're not talking about disarming a time I actually added more arms all right watch this in the nuclear rim national leaders have ended or undermined it major arms control treaties now here we silent agreement that we gonna do this and then you get another political leader and office that forgets about what the other agreement I mean forget about what the other presidents I'm not even thinking about it we're gonna do what we want to do the scientists are picking up on this so my and they reset the clock alright watch this now it says in the nuclear rim national leaders have ended or undermined it several major arms control treaties and negotiations during the last year creating an environment conducive to a renewed nuclear arms race amen to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to lower barriers to nuclear war political conflicts regarding nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea remain unresolved and are if anything worsening US and Russia cooperation on arms control and disarmament is all but non-existent now when they saw these things are they looking at this they said you know what we don't have to set this truck and they moved it to a hundred seconds and that's the that's the that's the shortest time it has ever been in since the clock existence I think it started in 1947 here's the shortest time it's ever been eight they say doomsday within 100 seconds 100 seconds to midnight 100 seconds to midnight that's short y'all that's short they may if they don't have any confidence in the end leadership how we gonna put our confidence in leadership any moment the clock could strike midnight and are we ready to go in at that moment all right look at this I want to just bring a quote in the Prophet makes a statement and the message the second coming of the Lord I'm going back to paragraph 46 hallelujah he says now I have a picture at home he says or I believe it's loaned out at the time called by the scientists three minutes before midnight now this is 1957 that he's writing this and actually in 1957 it was actually two minutes to midnight because 1953 to 1959 they had it at 2 minutes 1960 they put it at 7 minutes and then I found something striking in 1963 they put it at 12 minutes what happened in 1963 some angels came down and sent sent a prophet back to Jeffersonville and they put it at 12 minutes oh my right but here the probably pick this up it says now I have a picture at home or I believe it's loaned out at this time called by the scientist three minutes before midnight if the scientific world have said the clock has went around until it's three minutes before midnight and I think they cut that down now till about one minute before midnight now that's what the brothers say oh my I think they cut that down and that's exactly what happened this week they cut it down it's a minute it over a little over a minute and a half listen he says I think they've cut that down down till about one minute before midnight when they discovered hydrogen or oxygen atomic and all these great all those great powers that they could harness could completely cause a total annihilation in five minutes time nothing you can do about it if they press the button nothing you can do about it you're done for that's why you can't come to church a man just like it's a visit this is not a picnic that we're going on this is time for a checkup is your life ready that if they press the button you wouldn't even have time to repair you understand you wouldn't even have tied you didn't you wouldn't even know it was coming my god they got this thing so designed that not even I mean I believe Russia said they had something now that not even the US could detect what they was doing and I don't let if you tried to block it it has intelligence inside it to go around what you try why are you trying to block it my church we are in we are at zero time glory I know we want our career so now I know we want this and I know we want death but but you better want a rapture more than anything else you must get ready for a rapture if you don't have the Holy Ghost I will leave church till I knew that I was baptized with the Spirit of God glory to God listen listen he says if the scientific girl has the clock cast went around till it's three minutes before midnight and I think they cut that down now till

waiting a man not just being changed back to a young man or young woman he says but now they were waiting for the complete body change and that's where we are amen our body change that's gonna actually not limit us to sting in these earthly conditions hallelujah glory glory glory glory let me go on and read a little bit more Sodom and Gomorrah little knew that night that they were living their last hour little did Egypt know that the death angel that had been predicted to come would come that night little did Pearl Harbor realize that raid that took place we are weighed in the balance and found wanting we are near the interim it says what could happen if they write in Moscow could direct their missiles guided by the Stars and radar could land that bomb exactly on 4th Street in Louisville if they wanted to that's right and get now y'all y'all y'all you all are aware that you know this D talk about nations but we understand terrorism is a big thing too and you are aware what y'all think terrace won't attack where places you think they don't really want to attack look people that actually hate Americans will go where most Americans are gathered if it's just two or three people that you know that they want to do go somewhere where there is damage much damage so what you think they're gonna go football games huh basketball wherever it is multiple people gather that's where they want to be Oh hallelujah and church we have a desire to be in these environments there's time for a checkup amen that should not be our desire that we want I want to be in church that's where I wanna be right hallelujah glory to God but but watch the things of the world coming into your life watch that this is time for a checkup they just reset the clock science is picking up on that don't be so a man spiritually out of tune that you're missing what God is doing in this out hallelujah if science if you look I'm not gonna be here for doomsday a minute so I got actions a few amens because they're not gonna be here either we will not be here for doomsday if they looking for to say that that's or never before Sodom was destroyed before Sodom had fire raining down oh my god do you realize that uh mcbomb could be in that same type of fire but before fire could rain down God pulled a lot out and lot was a he wonderful he wasn't a full believer we call him and make believer and God had enough concern for make believer that he pulls him out before destruction I'm nobody gonna do for the bride [Applause] that's why I say I'm not gonna be here so if it's if it's that close to science dinners cold side for us all right let me see let me let me let me just finish trying to read this he says that's right then we can stand out there in the sea somewhere on our ships and direct one right straight on the capital Moscow if we want to what would happen my brother if that great missile turning would take place in this country which perceive a shape at the same hour we turn loose the same things and shake it to the other side my sense and we're living on a little bitty tiny thin crust anyhow when the earthquakes have eat around and eat around until it's like hollowing out an egg I mean just just recently Puerto Rico just shook multiple times multiple times and I thought how close is that to us a man church you know think about these things amen hallelujah look and say it says it should it should make if she make one big burst and this eight thousand miles thick of lava was spurred into the air it would do exactly what God sent would take place we're at the end time we're here no way to stop it all the begging we might put an Eisenhower in every country and it will never stop it Jesus Christ said these times will come we're here the fig tree put them forth this bud so I'm just you don't want to just kind of bring that in church this is a lot closer these are not just news events we need to kind of keep our eyes on what's going on and it's and it's closer than we think it's absolutely closer than we think now can I just kind of shift gears here oh my I want to talk about Sarah you know we've been talking about this catch division and step into it and and we use a man these two women Martha and Mary as Jesus was coming to the grave of last and and Jesus came to the grave by a vision hallelujah he knew that God had already showed him that he was going to raise Lazarus from the grave so as we begin to do with the disciples about let's go to our friend Lazarus he's sleeping and Jesus used different terms than than what they were using it said well if he's sleeping we shouldn't go wake them same y'all don't get it Lazarus is dead oh let us go and die with us y'all still don't get it they they were they didn't even realize what was going on just say let's just go and visit visit Lazarus and as they were going over there Martha heard that Jesus was coming hallelujah and this woman Martha had a different spirit on her I like to say that Martha had the ability to shake herself from an atmosphere I want to say that again Martha had the ability to shake herself from a particular atmosphere amen and I'm gonna tell you something this hour you gonna have to st. you're gonna need the same ability to shake yourself from different atmospheres hey man the devil want to try to keep you in a certain atmosphere of unbelief the devil will to keeping the atmosphere down the devil want to keep you in an atmosphere of groaning and complaining it and moaning and why me and I know you got to shake yourself know that God is in control of everything Martha had the ability to shake herself from the atmosphere of unbelief and declared her faith that even now whatsoever you ask God I believe he'll give it to you I know my brother been there for four days but I believe even now whatever you say Jesus will turn this situation around Martha declared our faith and I'ma tell you gonna need to be able to declare your faith in this hour no matter what you're going through a man marry on the on the opposite side had she could not shake herself from the environment that she was in marry even though Jesus was president Mary still a man stayed in this atmosphere of love you know and like I said it's okay they lost a brother it was okay to grieve nothing wrong with that amen but Jesus was not there just to visit Monson Mary when Jesus was showing up he was coming by a vision so so even though America not shake us up she was still required a mentor taking action before she saw the miracle I want to say that again you might find yourself in a situation where you can't shake yourself out of this and you can't shake yourself on that but before you experienced a miracle from Almighty God you must get involved you will take an action what was this action that the Lord Jesus Dave Martin Mary all these men around all these brothers around but I want you involved in this Mary and actually according to the vision you were involve I don't know if y'all getting that according to the vision that the angel had concerning you you were involved so God will allow some things to happen II say roll the stone away Jesus a roller stolen away and mob the mayor maybe look around it and everybody else said now why don't we get set up lying ain't tell him I want y'all I want you to put some action in this I know I know it's right it's probably very difficult for you to do this I mean you're probably looking at how frail your body is it I can't Road that big old stone but no you better find a way roll that's thrown away if you want to see a miracle roll the stone away hallelujah if you want to go to the next level roll the stone away come on church is time for us in our individual lives roll the stone away roll away praise God I'm looking for miracles this year I'm looking for the supernatural this year I'm looking for God to do even I'm in the exceeding be a part of the public eye all I can ask the thing I'm looking for that this year but I got a catch the vision first I got a catch the vision first and when I catch it then I can step into it all right hallelujah I know I know I know I know I know the Lord is kids it's challenging us now I'm bringing I will use Mary and Martha look at these women and their actions around Jesus two different actions that they had around Jesus now I want to bring us a man to a Sarah and we want to look at Mary as well but we might just introduce a little bit of Eve in this watch this statement here Oh glory to God from the the message the spoken word is the original seed part to watch this statement of the Prophet mates hallelujah says now look Eve what does she do she received the wrong seat how did she do it believing Satan's lie Eve receivers for the wrong seat by believing Satan's lie how many says that's right he says why sure it's right sure she receives sayings lie what did she bring forth by doing it Satan said you know this is glorious this is wonderful thing do you know you were made for that why you were actually made for this purpose Oh was I oh its pleasant to the eye it's good you should you should try it but the Lord God said no not that not yet wait wait a minute no no but but you know oh if we do well oh you do surely won't die brother branham say that slick tongue devil he ain't got hooks in a forked tail no like they try to make you believe he's a slicker look at this behind the pulpit you gotta watch the devil behind the pulpit right he's a slick guy behind the pulpit right uh-huh awesome little Ricky with this hair comb down like a duck that's the never that we watch tonight amen sitting on this back out there no out to harm some mother's daughter that's the guy come around with a little cute like look oh I'll let that go the Prophet is right on top of you you gotta watch that there ain't got no snow no no no pitchfork and horns Amen but he's a little slick stir all right listen since now the womb Eve receives the wrong seat the wrong seat word now listen real close now we're gonna drive this right down if the Lord willing she receives the wrong word what did it do it was Satan's lie she would be wise well she could belong to the big church she would be she'd be well thought of in the city while she'd be like the rest of the people huh sure that's exactly what your host Brian believe that's exactly so that's exactly what Satan would have tried to that's think that that's exactly what Satan would have tried to say when the word came to Mary but she shook him away remember I said Martha was able to shake a certain atmosphere hallelujah Mary had a problem shake in the atmosphere Martha could now in this example brother branham assure South Eve was not able to shake the atmosphere but Mary could hallelujah amen Mary was able to shake that split this even devil and if there was ever time for the chirps - shake that slick deceiving devil that time is now don't be like Mary Martha's sister but be like Mary that was married to Joseph Oh hallelujah Mary amen when she received the promise from you know from from the angel Gabriel she cheated just kind of you know just this justice state their reason I want to just kind of show something here if I can she didn't stay there just kind of reached in with everything she said she said she said be it unto me according to your word by using terminology like that she was sick in the atmosphere of the enemy she knew that there was a promise sitting in Scripture and residue look at the promise in saying why me she could say why not me rather than you looking at the promises and not me God can use me I did this and I did that it and God can't do anything with me stop listening to that devilish a diverse field [Applause] [Music] shake the atmosphere and say God have you sad it's gonna happen to me then be it up to me according to your word let's just let's read this amen about Mary here oh my my mind go to Luke 1 Luke 1 thank you Jesus look at look at this you know I was telling you that the transformation is actually taking place even right now while we're sitting here you might not realize it but you being transformed you've been transformed you don't have to feel it but I can tell you it's happening to you and the first thing that has to happen is God got to transform our thinking Oh glory to God God got a Gaga got to get us thinking the way his word has called us well I mean we we got to see ourselves the way the word since we are a man Church a man but look at this look at this and we know we can look at as we're getting ready for this we can look at Eve she didn't shake the enemy she didn't shake the enemy and she fell and now that's why we have all the problems that we have today because Eve Eve didn't then shaken and even we can look at Sarah and Sarah had a hard time shaking Sarah mixed some doubt in with everything she was doing too but she had already given a hand mate to Abraham and say have a son by her and that'll be the promised son that's not what God said said God say Sarah thy wife not your hand me don't give me the hand mate I want your wife and if Sarah's looking at her condition now I've never been able to bear children all these years I've never borne a child and and and at this age bad child come on she didn't know what God could do that's why he asked the question is anything Oh church that's why you asked the question is anything too hard for the Lord hallelujah not just changing Amen your body to be able to produce a child but he also changed them back to a young man and a young one Oh multiple changes occurred the change is happening right now I wish I wish that the Lord to help us really get that way multiple changes occurred hallelujah it wasn't just a change to have the baby but there was another change took place amen whether we're we're not she's looking like a young woman he's looking like a young man and what I'm trying to get you to cysts that you are being changed right now you were being changed and then when Abraham and Sarah saw me the change took place Abraham begin this is my sister hallelujah glory to God Oh hallelujah look at this now Sarah doubted a little bit a man but God still came around and visited her anyway I thank God for that because I see Sarah in the when we when we preach about women and script we got to think about the church because the church sometimes we doubt a little bit but now I could tell y'all right now someone's been doubting whether we gonna be changed or not but we shall be changed in the moment and the tweaked liver I you look at your trials and you look at your tribulations you look at your the stresses you look at your failures and you can't you just can't see yourself you looking at everything that devil wants you to look at but what I'm trying to just present to you a promise you're gonna be changed and this change is not based on anything you're doing I'm gonna try to show y'all this is this is why it's so important that the Spirit of God comes in the connects with the word because the change actually takes place by the Spirit that comes on the word so you realize when we come here a couple weeks ago and we just had this shout and good time everybody you know it caught that even now and that there was a change taking place there was a shift sometimes a certain work and come at a certain time it shifts the whole atmosphere not only did it shift the atmosphere but people throughout the week begin to recoat that even now you keep reminding yourself of God's promise no matter how bad your situation is see that that was Martha's face I noticed things look bad four days dead my brother stinks hallelujah but even now what have you asked God for I believe I believe you'll get it we got to come to that that's the faith that God is looking for in his believers your faith that will not be shook by circumstances or situations I think that's only moved by what God said let's read let's read because we're looking at we're looking at Mary now hallelujah Mary if I could put it this way was a part of a vision can I put it that way because there was a vision that God showed a prophet that our Virgin shall conceive and bear child I just begin to think all about the shalt bear with me today right but-but-but-but why didn't God get a virgin that was not married to any man because she was married to Joseph even though they had not had a a formal wedding the vows that's what married them hallelujah young young man young woman you're married to that young lady if you yeah I mean you know when y'all engaged y'all are married you're not supposedly touching each other hallelujah don't touch each other until you actually ghost go before the preacher a man search right but but in God's eyes you're married so if a young man or young woman give engaged a man God sees it as marriage you can't break that hallelujah that's why you better pray before you go through the engagement don't let some fellows set you up specially nowadays where they want to video everything and they got you on the video saying no you better tell them you better delete it and you bet my facebook live and you might get surprised god help us here Jesus but you know when women when we look when we look at these things they were already married God God elected to choose a man that was already married to a virgin and I thought to myself I said Lord you came down and and I and Joseph in discontent in this position I have to take Mary now Joseph thought to himself privately he's saying that because it was already a few years older to marry say it say I'm gonna put her away I'm not gonna I'm not gonna deal with this I'm not you know too much criticism I mean this is hard to believe you pregnant by what an angel said this an angel said dad and I'm pregnant marry that come on I mean how you expect me to believe something like this Mary Mary I'm sorry I just maybe something I said nah you know just so I know she telling you but I saw Mary with you know I John was I saw I saw I didn't want to tell you I don't want to tell you that Joseph but I saw John coming by and you can imagine what Joseph was going through this is what they tell me this were they they said this they said that you say it's something that's so far-fetched you know one of you I mean come on you're gonna blame it on God that God did this can your marriage and Joseph and I want to say this way because if you put yourself on the scene and you were a Joseph would you have been able to stand with Mary i'ma tell you what helped Joseph stand with marry when God did something supernatural to Joseph Oh stay with me here God gave Joseph a supernatural tree and say fear not to take unto you Mary's my wife but that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now when Joseph had his personal experience with God there was nobody with any story that would be able to shake Joseph and what I'm here to tell you this morning you're going to need your personal experience with God no devil will be able to shake you no criticism will be able to shake you know love from the pits of hell will be able to shake you because you had your own personal experience I'm happy to see you but I won't God to do something from me to make me shout I'm happy to see you get the Holy Ghost but I want to receive the Holy Ghost glory to God amen what Saturday with Joseph what settle it for him was a personal experience see here you'd go around tell his dad and his mama's to look ya'll don't understand you didn't have the experience that I had you didn't hear from the aim to the way I heard from the engine I wasn't even looking for a dream but God told me fear not to take him to me marry my wife that was just because conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost the language that the Angels use was the same language that Mary was sharing and it was very easy for them to connect lord have mercy Mary was a part of a vision a prophet it already spoke that you know Mary not even know he'd actually didn't use Mary's name let me let me go back he didn't use Mary's anybody say a virgin shall conceive not only have a prophet already spoke God God spoke way back in the Garden of Eden when Eve fail God spoke and he said he said oh let us read this James it's 3:15 oh my oh god help me Lord Jesus y'all just bear with me today I thought I was gonna go a particular direction in God's God's in just slow down slow down slow down here Jeff James it's 3:15 this is where God speaks this was this was after Eve had failed not a punishment so being dished out glory to God and it says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now we know a men according to a man test the way our bodies are designed a woman does not carries a seat it's the man that carries the seed a man the woman cares the the man carries the sperm seat right so so so here the God himself says that Vasi said I put in between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed this was speaking of the coming of the Lord Jesus this was speaking of the virgin birth when he said her seed so here God himself has prophesied this is a vision Isiah picks it up and in a sense of urgency I can see this just making more clarity to the vision and the reason I keep preach this because I want to bring more clarity to 20/20 we got to get ourselves in a rapture condition haha I don't know about you but I don't want to stay here I'm looking forward to one year being my last year I thank God for everything that he has done for me and I know some of the other people say Lord don't let him come before I get married be careful what you pray for amen after you get married you might be her Lord let the Raptor Conine some stuff you start going through a whole lot even so come Lord Jesus amen but by here-here-here this vision that God has given us in genesis 3:15 and i'm saying nine amen speaks to this and and now we pick it up over Luke because Mary has to step into the vision catch it catch it and then step into it do something with it after you catch it Luke whirling twenty-five I mean 26 says and in the six month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse so she was already engaged a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and the angel came unto her my God my God my God see all this individual stuff that an angel did come to her and Joseph the angel came to her and she had to be the one to take what the angel said and go back out and tell cani cani cani tapes it's gonna be up to you to start testifying about yourself glory to God you testified your own personal experience listen he says and the angel came in unto her and said he'll that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now what kind of worse is this do y'all remember Mary was was a young lady she lost her father at an early age her mother was actually buried for years and when Mayor was born you know they were hoping for a boy but God given Mary now you can imagine because I know some households I'm gonna scan I just seen some house walls will tell their children you a mistake I wasn't expecting you I went looking for you huh and that's a shame for some how to tell that to a child right I mean if God give you that that's what you'll get God gave me three girls I would have loved some boys I got girls and I love my girls when I get old and really great I believe in girls to be there for me if I have some boys in my dad sing you twenty dollars or something but God God give you them girls for a reason hallelujah it pull out certain qualities in you you got the answer sir as a father I don't care how tough I am a man I gotta get soft I'm talking to girls with a boy it might be able to grab them buy a shirt Colin boy did not say but a girl no no no no no you never told all that God know how to balance things over in our lives and then you got a tip a problem got to give you a girl whoo praise the Lord in your heart even if mama got a typical problem gotta give our girl hey man you go to pulling her hair and you have to learn this touches be delicate with that amen look boy you just cut all his hair off keep on going now you got a girl you have to learn some patience God know how to do things but Mary could have looked at her life and said now I have my highly favorite I lost my daddy when he was young I mean when I was young I mean I I don't even know if I'm supposed to be here how you gonna say I'm highly favored just being me and my mama and now I'm getting married to Joseph and and Joseph is a lot of years older than Mary I want to say almost 20 years older than Mary right man Joseph's already got a family his I've passed away and now he's getting connected with Mary hallelujah hi Mary you know now I'm stepping into a situation where I'ma be kind of like a step mama and these kids are probably just as old as me I won't try to get the whole story look at what she did think about what you'll be dealing with now looking at marriage a highly favored Karen can I put it this way for you cuz you're doing 90 now you wit me in the midst of your trial right now highly favored look at this when she saw him she was troubled at his singing and casting her mind what manner of salutation this should be now I'm glad that she only said it in her mind see Sarah was the type of woman that will laugh and then lie about it so we got all these different characters in Scripture and and somewhere here you gonna find yourself but here Mary just said in the mind what kind of salutation is this ain't nobody ever said it like this to me it says and the angel said unto her fear not Mary now he had to call her name there's any time person hear a name it just kind of wait a minute it loosens you up a little bit this person knows me amen hallelujah fear not Mary for thou hast found favour with God they behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb what wait a minute and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David oh this just beginners just Minister them to Mary what maybe she even thinking I'm not even from the royal lineage I don't I mean what is all this how's this gonna happen so just don't worry about it watch this watch it he says it says and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not man I know you just gave me a promise but how is this gonna come to pass I'm a virgin and I'm supposed to conceive in my Emma I don't know a man cause it's gonna be me and Joseph not scheduled to be married until such-and-such a time how shall this be there's a legitimate question but this is where I want you all to see because what I say we being change Mary receive her pregnancy from her response [Music] let me put it Mary received her pregnancy from her response to the promise I want to say that again no sensation no emotion never felt anything but yet pregnant and when I'm when a woman is pregnant she's going through changes and here today you might be sitting here not feeling anything you might be having mind battle after my battle because some of the stuff you're going through hallelujah but even though you don't feel nothing something is still happening and I'm gonna tell you at some point in time spirit and truth go catch the vision and they go step into it look at the scripture because she got a legitimate question how shall this be seeing I know not a man watch this and the angel answered a seven her the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what's going to produce this that's why we want to preach the Holy Ghost we've need mo Holy Ghost we can never have enough Holy Ghost I'm gonna tell you I come to church every room every Sunday looking for the Holy Ghost they're just pouring out in here because it's the Holy Ghost what is he like can i connect can I tell y'all something the Holy Ghost is not just coming to give you a shout the Holy Ghost is not just coming to give you a scream the Holy Ghost is not just coming to give you an emotion now it's no problem for you to have any motion but I want you to understand the Holy Ghost is coming to actually make the promise that God gave you come to pass the holy that's what he is here for sir is here to make the promise that God gave you come to pass yeah who made the promise come to pass in Mary the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you I'll just I'm gonna just keep reading Oh God watch this watch this the angel answered and said to her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall we call the Son of God now this has just got Mary all messed up and I never even heard terms like this the Holy Ghost Church I go to tenean preaching about no Holy Ghost what is this so then the angel had to go love father in order for her to catch the vision and hear the angel says and behold my cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was cold barren they can't call it that no more after I have a child so you can call me that before I had ceiling but after I have a child you can't call me barren no more call me mama didn't angel with a little further this is just an aunt of faith but with God it sounds like the same words have you told Sara is anything too hard for he didn't get an answer back then but this time he was not gonna even ask a question he was gonna make a statement and I'm here to make a statement to you for with God nothing shall be impossible I'll talk about with God now if you try to do this without God it's gonna be impossible but with God nothing shall be impossible now finally after these words Mary done caught the vision and look at what Mary does she steps into the vision look at this mercy and Mary said see this this good God looking for you to speak some things it's got to come out of your mouth hallelujah somebody and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me I make this promise I know I come up with this I didn't pray for this I didn't act for this I want I want just keeping myself so I can bear Christ that was my purpose I knew it was the right thing for me to do but you found favor with God because you've been doing the right thing well behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her her message come through an angel your message has come through an angel I got just give me a couple quotes that I want to really even get back to I can get back to Sarah I got some things I want to say that but I'm trying to be mindful of our time we can get into subjects like this and we can go I ain't even finished reading the last quote that I was all cannot finish reading at at least I was at spoken word original seed that's exactly what Satan would have tried to say it when the word come to Mary but she shook him away in paragraph 195 on spoken words the original seed said how can this be said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you it's the Word of God say it be it unto me according to thy word that brought the life did y'all get that just by just by Mary's response to the promise that brought the life let the church say Amen I want to tell you some that brought the life you're a man means be it unto me so be it glory to God that brought the light watch this there you are since well do you know same says they they're all laugh at you that little rosy cheek girl didn't pay any attention to that right up in Judea she went you know I'm going to have a baby before she felt anything because the word had already been set there my that was all she didn't have to go through the prayer line a second time Oh glory you know no no no sir no sir she believed it she didn't have any sign of life she never had no sign of pregnancy at all she never felt nothing amen everything had been just like it was but she went telling everybody I'm going to have a why God said so brother branham say what's that the ROI of seed of Abraham so if you want to know what type of faith you supposed to have same faith that Mary had same faith that Abraham had hallelujah even though Sarah laughs Sarah did start making preparations amen glory to God and I'm so glad that when God looks at two accountants bet over and over in in Romans for I believe it was he even talked about Sarah laughing and all that and and we saw Abraham Downton but he never even considered it oh I just love God he not even could sit in your doubt he's gonna make it come to pass anyway let me let me let me let me try to finish says I'm gonna have a baby why God said what's that the ROI seen Abraham gonna have a baby Abraham buy that woman God said so will you tell me well you told me that 25 years ago I know but God says so that's it there you are that's the same thing what you do what what do you say today well you know the denomination will kick you out but God says so God said so well you know if you get baptized like that well God said so that's it that's it there's your virgin there she is not only to baptism but anything else the rest the word see anything God promised you you can have now let me read this message I just love the way God do things this is gonna come from them it's a quote from the message called the confident I love the way God does things I didn't I didn't even connect this myself but the Holy Spirit just did it because he told Mary the angel told Mary that the Holy Spirit which is the comforter it's going to overshadow you and cause this promise to come to pass I want to tell you all this morning it's gonna be the Holy Ghost that's gonna cause to promise to come to pass where you catch the vision and step into it I'm talking about all God got for you I got I got I got I got some things and I'm gonna be sharing and I just pray God will help us church if I can just encourage you spend some time with the Lord that way when you come to church you you count already listen be listening to tapes throughout the week you might happen to catch a tape that I might read a quote from write and then it make it much easier to preach it makes it much easier and everybody else kind of already in that and in a channel but if you if you are in the channel of the things where I'm not up here talking about no football no basketball I'm not coming to church to talk about that I'm not we're not here for that alright I mean some of y'all get so excited you start to talk about things in the world movies and that's that's fine it's all fine but make sure you prepare for church a man a man Church I'm telling you God God is trying to elevate our thought process here the conception has to happen in your mind Mary moved away all my own battles Martha moved away all mine battles now mother said Jesus here and in the merit probably sitting in the house he he'll be here soon Martha just wait for him no I'm calling to Jesus I'm not waiting for him to come he's in terror what if he don't come here I know you I know I'm going I'm gonna find where he then I could see Martha's it now if you want to sit here you sit here and she had can i'ma tell you something when Martha left she left by herself but if I'm a sadist without offending nobody if you want to sit in certain atmospheres there are people that will join you and they will help create the atmosphere around you for you to stay there but if you want to see something different you're gonna have to do something different and Martha gelled up and did something different yes this this is a perfect time for me to be morning perfect time but Jesus is here Jesus is here and since Jesus is here I'm gonna shake myself from the atmosphere that I'm in and I'm going to Jesus the tarp in because he's the only one that can do something about it one day we're gonna recognize that Jesus is still here I like this statement now I'm gonna read this and I pray it don't go over your head watch what the prophecy in this message the comforter there it is and how long he's going to buy forever then what is the Word of God what is our comfort today is when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Living God living in us your comfort is receiving the baptism the Holy Ghost amen watch this what's this and that's and that's with the word of the Living God we stand that words may flesh and dwelt among us now that was in Jesus that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now watch this now that same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become anybody still waiting on a change I tried to tell you it's already happening the Prophet said that word the same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh who felt it when it happened who thought that wouldn't happen but me when I heard that I had to rewind because in my spirit I say be it unto me according to that word we're not waiting it's here and once we catch it we don't step into it and there'll be a we're different we'll talk different we'll walk different everything will be will see different everything will be different once we catch this and step into it look at this that same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh he is with you now but he shall be in you now that same word that the Prophet spoke that same word that was made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh whose it my my flesh is a mess that's the devil's lie where God just told you is your flesh is holding his promise dude do you realize that Mary Joseph's wife her flesh was the flesh that God chose to reproduce himself through her flesh every issue in her body every cell in her body was holding that promise with her angel to you holding this promise God God God God's promise cannot be fulfilled and let's have found some flesh to dwelling I'm not gonna be like Sarah laughing that promises I'm not gonna be like Eve compromising with the words but I'm gonna be like Mary be done to me according to thy words I love this your your flesh I'm read that again that same word living in you were produced the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it that's the reason visions can break through the sound barrier that's the reason a may set a revision can break through the sound barriers and say let's say at the Lord it shall be so and so and that's the way it is what is it it's the word coming forth from a spirit church I am I'm just under expectation I just I just I'm looking for God that just do some some mighty things mighty things we got to catch the vision let's be like Mary Mary caught this it was things that she had never heard before and maybe you know some of the quotes that God might give us like this quote I just read I don't think I ever caught them I just happened to be listening this weekend you know brother Branham preached this at a time that he was going through his momma was very ill didn't know when mama was giving me to be call home to go to the Lord and said Lord and told me if Mama's leave and brother Branham made a statement says until God tell me that he'd taken her I'm gonna hold on and believe that God got healing that's what he said God didn't tell me God and she say maybe Guardian told him because he don't want me to be worried there's some things that he just didn't he don't show his prophets everything he said but he ain't told me say but but until God he say I know the doctors say this and and the nurses say that and they say she getting worse and worse but God didn't say she leaving so imma just hold on I said man if a prophet get standing there like that what about us we got to have that same kind of faith and if God decided to take it take take it and God did it took his mama home he kept on going but why he was in the midst of that trial he preached this message the comforter and he dropped that he dropped that nugget off the words that became flesh has now become our flesh change is taking place now there be a final change where these bodies will not be held by gravity anymore and we're looking forward to that but I'm letting you know right now change is happening now you've been transformed right now the Word of God is doing it and the Spirit of God comes too quick in the word and makes it even more real so when you pray and you got your prayer journal put that put on the top of your prayer journal God released your spirit into the midst of this church now I'm gonna tell you one way to stop the spirit from flowing zyne so whatever we do keep sin out of the church I started off by saying this and I'm gonna say it again this is a spiritual hospital so we love for people to come that might be dealing with some sin conditions but the objective is not for you to stay in that condition that's not the objective when you go to a natural hospital look they trying to get you out of there they welcome you come on in once they diagnose what you got knotti trying to get you out as soon as your surgery's over they want you out right amen they need the bed for somebody else you understand come on we need the altar for other people you keep coming how many spirits you got all right and I'm not saying that the block can't stop you from coming to the altar but I am saying that look you need to get free and stay free praise the Lord Amen get serious about this it's time for a checkup God if I'm right I want to get right now I want to leave Church not right anymore amen hallelujah but this word is word that was me flesh and dwelt among us it's been made flesh again and it's dwelling among us right now I don't know if we realize it be it unto me according to you let me tell you not something else God don't bring sermons like this to you just to play games with you if God didn't mean business with you you wouldn't be sitting here I'm gonna be honest there's just too many other churches for you to go to and can we uh can we just be honest you try them you try them amen right I hope you get what I'm saying and especially when you're running from God do you run into a denomination church so quick running from God and some just push you right back you just be like in somebody action how was church Oh Jeff we had a blessed time you know you didn't have no blessed time you know yeah that's why you couldn't stay there now that you back get back for real amen give God everything praise the Lord don't come half steppin give them everything all right Church III have to keep going y'all just bear with me I imma stop there for the day but I'm still in this catch division I'm still hearing and and after we catch we got a run you know we don't we catch it we got we got to step into it I mean just like mayor once she caught it it was no more wrestling with it after that no more no more you know no more questions she had no more questions you know how could this thing be okay spirit Holy Spirit on overshadow okay okay okay I don't know a man okay this is it and and and by the way you your cousin you know Elizabeth yeah she pregnant not six months live if God if you can do that free Lizbeth I know what you can do for me and then had to take us that father for with God with God nothing is impossible but I just got Mary right there that just that was it that was it and she couldn't take no more behold a handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to work can I tell y'all something stop fighting with God stop fighting with God and let God be gone however he want to do it that's how he gonna do it if you want to change it back to a young man first right and then change your body that's fine I'm gonna bring you a quote for that one later on amen I can't give it all I can't preach it all in one day but I got a quote for that one too so just remember that statement Amen catch the vision and step into it let's pray Lord we are grateful it were Jesus becoming more and more real to us not just a story that we see in Scripture but God as the Prophet suggests these little nuggets he said the word that became flesh and dwelt among us has now become our flesh he also told us that Lord these promises say our flesh holds it Lord how grateful I am that you would choose me that you would use me Lord for our like this for such a time as this pray father that you would help us to to get ourselves out of the way don't don't let us get so caught up father the things of this world that we miss what you're doing we want to be more involved in the things of God we wrapped is upon us they they reset the Doomsday Clock scientists realize that with the current leadership in multiple countries we got a problem our hands the Prophet is warned us of this that we just one infidel some infidel don't even believe in God that would just strike Lord there be them push the button in the whole world is annihilated just like that you told us that it would that you
