life it's hot Y'all Gonna Make Me open up a door in here it's hot Lord Jesus Merry Christmas to everybody so good to have you all in the house of the Lord amen on on today and anywhere the church has gathered it becomes the house of God amen I was sitting out there getting things ready and I heard some people say they brought a whole church in here today yeah [Music] they said they said we put 50 chairs out on the brother first thing he walked in and said y'all got more chairs [Music] and I said wait you know whatever we need that's what we're going to do and I'm happy to see one of one of the young ladies I just let them talk I just let them talk they see I was sitting there and um so one of the young ladies to say that's the pastor sitting over there so the girls say um is that right so I was getting ready to leave to come in here and she said uh Pastor could I just talk to you just for a few minutes and I say sure she say I go to church all the way down to Miami but I'm looking to go to a new church because my pastor is Apostolic but he curse all the time thank you I can see why you're looking for a new church and um you know so you know we got to talking and I began to explain to them you know we just Bible believing Christians and we just love the Lord and um and I say the reason that we're here today is because we're meeting right now in a school and they had no one to open the school for us today so we we asked if we could just come here and just use it for the day and they say oh that's that's great I say you know what and from what I'm seeing right now if our only purpose of being here today was for you amen [Music] we'll get shifted from place to place until we get into our Promised Land amen but we will pick up one here and one there as we hey man take our journey so and man you all just remember her in prayer I got her name here and um have to pull it up on my phone because it wasn't like you know uh you know they want to uh yeah but I got it it's in my phone and [Music] God knows her name God knows her heart [Music] one Mary nothing like that but uh but we we thank the Lord I'm not going to try to call all the names but I thank God for everybody being here amen uh this morning I really do thank God and um a couple of things that I just need to mention before we would get in the word of the Lord today I want you all to make sure you give a special greeting to our sister uh Verna Amen on today this will be her last service with us she and brother Jimmy are relocating to Ocala Florida and they'll be going there in fellowship with brother Joe Underwood uh brother Jimmy got a wonderful job a good City job you know up there so the Lord has opened up a door for him and um and I was telling sister Vern I say that's it's it's the right thing to do and uh and I'm happy to see them go amen this next season of Life there starting in Ocala so uh God bless you we're gonna miss you sis amen but God bless you and and uh trust the Lord will use you in a mighty way while you're there amen you and brother Jimmy amen also uh I I needed to make mention that um we have two of our saints that um were taken to the hospital over the last couple days uh brother Robles is in the hospital there in Port St Lucie and um there on Christmas day they're gonna keep them until sometime next week I believe uh just having a few issues with his blood pressure so we want to remember brother Robles in prayer and um and then uh last well throughout the week Brother Joseph has been uh complaining about headaches and he's been going back and forth to the hospital into the doctor and they just could not figure out what was happening with him and so they got him to the hospital last night and I had a chance to get there and pray for him because they were going to be transferring him down to Joe DiMaggio hospitals to Children's Hospital down in Hollywood and when it got him there I guess they ran a scan and they found a couple of spots on his brain and this morning brother Josue called me and said that they wanted to do an emergency surgery where they wanted to drill some holes there in his head that said there was a like pus or something like that that was developing there and they did they didn't understand what it was so Brother Joseph on this Christmas day is is there in the hospital having surgery so we want to remember our precious brother in prayer when I was talking to him on last night he said brother Jack I'm gonna just share this with you and he says he says you know we were in our new church and uh in the new church you say it was time for us to receive the word and my brother Jack you called me out to preach I said well brother Joseph if God gave you that Vision you ain't going nowhere until it comes to pass [Applause] and so um we just want to remember him in prayer I mean you know young man is just God's given him just a little something just you all heard the testimony of him praying stopping and wanting to pray for the man that was in the ditch and uh you know after that they went to get tires changed on the car and brother Jose was telling me that um you know this big gentleman walked out to change the tires big old fella and brother Joe looked at him to say sir you mind me telling you something it's a uh yeah go ahead it's a uh be careful what you complain about because it might be your blessing the man looked at me who is this little fella where he come from it's right on time you know and you know God gives gifts like that and um you know so we thank God for a young man and I think the thing of it is you have to raise him up the right way and just put them in the right uh channel to be trained and God can use them and that's what we want to see is God use them amen so I don't want to do anything to discourage a gift like that I want to encourage them you know and my thing is anytime you know the Lord gets a hold of somebody at an early age we know that that was just waiting to attack him uh so let's keep him in prayer and this morning we're going to pray for him because he sent a a text say please have the whole church pray for me amen today so we we want to do that amen and while we're praying for him we'll also pray for our brother Jimmy and sister Vernon as they're making their transition there to Ocala that the Lord would just use them amen then pray for we'll play Pray for brother uh real blessed amen let's stand amen um and we'll just briefly have a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we thank you that we can come into your presence we thank you for this time of worship and adoration that you have allowed us to have on this Christmas Day Lord while we're here and uh in worship God we have some of our brothers that are not able to be here with us today because of situations that are happening in their body but not only did you bring Salvation to the world but you brought healing because there was a dual atonement at Calvary and father in between both of these conditions we placed the blood of the Lord Jesus believing that you were wounded for our transgressions bruise for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon you with your stripes we are declaring healing god brother Robles is they're suffering with blood pressure issues Lord we pray that you are stabilized and that you would bring things under control Lord that you would raise them up out of that sick bed that he'd be able to go back home and enjoy himself Lord our precious Brother Joseph has been Lord uh uh the doctors have have stated that they need to do emergency surgery Lord and what a way to spend Christmas in the hospital father doing surgery we ask that you would be with him be with brother uh and sister Morales as they're with him oh God that the children Lord watch over them and keep them Father my God give them strength to endure this oh God and we pray that you would Lord just God the doctor's hands the nurses everyone that's involved made no mistakes be made oh God and Father whatever precious there may be relieved and father may he come out with with flying colors give him a testimony that will be used Lord to draw people to the kingdom of God use it for your glory father we commit them now into your hands believing that you're more than able to take care of them Father as we turn our attention now to the word of God we ask that you would just Minister Lord to our hearts speak to us the only way that you can take control father this portion of the services in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen praise the Lord [Applause] amen let's get our Bibles amen and we'll turn to a scripture they were afraid that our drums has gone [Music] really create problems in the in the hotel but they didn't know there was the electric drums and they not as loud as the acoustic so uh we thank God we thank God we thank God let's go to Saint Luke chapter 2. just a couple verses here and I had to makeshift the pulpit uh we left ours at at church but God is good uh Luke chapter 2 verse 8. the Bible says and there were in the same country Shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated [Music] um just you all I don't know if we made it clear but service certainly on Wednesday night and next Sunday but being that we are in this transition period we are unable to have a watch Night Service which would have been Saturday night that would have been Saturday night rolling into Sunday we can't do a watch Night Service but next Sunday is first Sunday and the first Sunday of the year and we will have our regular service that'll be back at the school uh we'll be using the school again on Wednesday night it was just only for today that we were not able to get the school but we'll be right back there until God moves us to amen our final destination amen um this morning I would like to just take a thought on the attribute of salvation and man the attribute of Salvation And um just follow me on the journey here this morning we celebrate the Savior being born a man we celebrate that and um had he not come to the Earth uh we would be without hope but we thank God for the Savior being born but what actually makes him save is because the Savior not only born but he died and he rose again amen and uh and it's through his death that we're able to claim our salvation but I want to just just read a few uh uh quotes here and then we will hopefully he'll be able to kind of follow me with with this in this first um quote why are we not a denomination I think this kind of uh funny I didn't you know I didn't even recognize this but while we were sitting out there uh the young lady my wife had walked out and the young young lady said what type of church are y'all and she recognized how the sisters was dressed being from Apostolic background what kind of church are y'all are you on my wife said non-denominational she's like um that was lost she hadn't heard that one before so she waited when she got me like what does it mean she said I heard the lady say none something none not non-denominational and I say well that means we're not Baptist we're not Pentecost we're not Catholic we're not Episcopalian we're not no none of those names those titles that's denominational names we are just Christians who believe the Bible a man from Genesis to revelation we believe the Bible Hallelujah so that's what it means when we're non-denominational amen uh so here this this first uh uh quote is coming out coming out of why are we not a denomination here brother Graham says why which was first a savior or a sinner which was first a savior which was first A Healer or a sick person why was there permitted to be a sinner because the attributes of him is a savior Hallelujah if there had never been a sinner he'd never been known as a savior Hallelujah he can make all things wind around to his glory can the Potter say to or can the pot say to the Potter you made me thus who's on the wheel who's got the clay whose hands is it is it in Paul said oh foolish man didn't he say he raised Pharaoh up for this purpose certainly he knew that it he knew it before the before the uh there was a world he knowed who would be what and he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness glory to God Amen that he might be a Healer he let there be hate that he might be loved sure he did he's God and that's his attributes and he has to have the same something he has to have something to display his attributes how would you ever know there was a night how would you ever know there was any if it was all daylight how would you how would you ever know there was night there's a night so it could prove daylight sure there is amen you see what he did I like this you know because and before there was a sickness there has to be a Healer before there's a sin there has to be a savior someone stronger than your sin someone stronger than the sickness that has you bound someone that can make a difference in that right amen and our lord Jesus is the one that can make make a difference and and I want I want us to try to uh get this when I'm talking about the attribute a man of Salvation just you know brother Brandon made a statement there he has to have something to display his attributes and uh and we're going to take a journey here through scripture because we we realize today um you know now let me let me be clear um we know about as Believers we know Jesus was not born on Christmas Day amen we know that Jesus was born in the springtime amen and we realize that hallelujah amen but I am happy that we at least get one day here that we can bring everybody attention to this amen yes they have paganized it and everything else but let's try to bring them back to the truth Jesus was born and he was born savior right now now here's the other thing I want us to get is that these attributes have been expressed throughout throughout the years in different situations the attribute of Savior has been expressed not only in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but even in other human beings he is let's just let this attribute be expressed let's just follow the path Amen on today now this is something I want us to remember all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ is amen if if he is savior glory to God if he is Redeemer if he is healer all that Christ is he is pouring that into his church oh Hallelujah somebody amen amen you got to realize what attributes are now going to be expressed through you amen amen listen to this if a lion gives birth praise God you expect another lion if a zebra gives birth you expect a baby zebra if a dog gives birth you expect a little dog amen if a human gives birth you expect another human to come forth if God gives birth hey you expect another God to come forth amen and God has given birth to his sons and his daughters and his attributes are being expressed through each one Hallelujah hearing this message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and notice when you when you uh I didn't even know what it's all this but it's just my God there's so many little things uh that God let us know that he we write where he want us to be this one this quote was actually in Fairfield and I think his main Fairfield Maine and here we are at Fairfield all right Church here that the quote says God gave Jesus his Spirit without measure and him and him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God manifested In the Flesh the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself but when he gave out his Spirit to the to we adopted Sons he give us a bucket full out of that ocean he had all the fullness of the godhead we just have a portion of it as a gift of the Holy Spirit but if I took one bucket full of water out of the ocean or even a teaspoon full of it out of the ocean the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean would be in that spoonful hallelujah amen look if there's uh every every every attribute that is in God once he gives birth to another son those attributes are now in the children foreign all right now that's amen every he says uh uh the the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean would be in that Spoonful but just less in quantity not less in quality just less in quantity but not less in quality is the same God it ain't the same God that they were looking for in the manger it's the same God dwelling in your hearts today Hallelujah and if he's the same God he got the same power he got the same Authority he got the same anointing it's the same God but just less in quantity not less in quality so the same holy spirit that was in Christ is in his church I I love this I love this y'all just bear with me here we read the scripture Luke 2 11 it says from to you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord I was just looking at a man that definition there and a portion of this definition out of this book I have the key to the Bible and it says a savior is a preserver it's a Defender a man a deliverer amen and and uh they they put God is preeminently the savior of his people as their creator preserver and deliverer but like I told you amen we'll be able to kind of go back in scripture and see that God has allowed this attribute to be expressed through other people hallelujah we're going to go back in the Old Testament and pick up he was allowed on this attribute to be expressed in other people because he himself would be the ultimate savior oh Hallelujah y'all just stay with me here all right I want to just bring in a man just another little thought out of that day on Calvary Hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord all right um that day on Calvary says this and When sin struck the Earth back in the beginning like a sheet of Blackness falling from the heaven it literally paralyzed the Earth it thrown every creature on the earth and all of God's creation in bondage this was the need for Jesus right it says man was under bondage of death sickness trouble Sorrows all nature fell with it sin was an anesthetic that actually paralyzed the Earth and then we were set here hopeless because every creature on Earth was subject to it and everyone born on Earth was subject to it so it had to come from some place where there was no sin oh Hallelujah this is why Jesus had to come to Earth he had to come from a place where there was no sin it came from glory and he's going he went back to Glory came from God and went back to God we also came from God and we're going back to God we came from a place where there was no sin we came from a place where there was no sickness we came from a place where there was no disease that's why we always land for healing Hallelujah we know what it's like to be in a place where there was none of these things hey there was a place where there was no heart trouble there was a place where there was no diabetes Hallelujah there was a place where there was no surgeries there was a place and I longed to go back to that place praise His holy name oh my my my my he had that so he had to come from uh uh he says everyone born and subject to it so it had to come from some place where there was no sin it could not come from the earth one of us cannot redeem the other it had to come from another therefore when man realized that he was separated from his God he become a Wanderer they wept they cried they toiled they wandered about through the mountains and through the desert seeking a city whose building make it was God for he knew that if he ever got into the presence of God he could talk it over with his with his uh with him but there's no there was no way back he become lost he didn't know which way to turn so he just took out wandering trying to find somewhere that he could find a way back to that place something on the inside of him told him that he come from a place that was perfect something told him that he come from a place that was perfect we realized we needed a savior because man could not save himself Hallelujah and he got to understand there are situations that happen in life that require a savior oh my just normal situations can happen in life uh I was trying to save this to a little later but I'm gonna have to inject it now um as a young lad a very small boy I was uh in a um situation where I needed a savior and as a little boy I was there playing with my cousins at a pool and um you know they were at one end of the pool swimming and and I had three cousins they really they couldn't swim a man so they stayed in the shallow end of the pool but they were babysitting me all of my cousins were older than I was and they were babysitting me and I was going just around the pool and I started in the shallow and I would throw a rock in and get a rock out throw a rock in and get that rock out scoop it right out and I moved myself down to the deep end of the pool and and while they're playing they didn't see me at the deep end of the pool and I threw the Rock in and I went to scoop to get it out and uh this time the rock went a little bit too far in and all I you know all I know that happened is that I fell into the pool and my cousins could not get me out because they didn't know how to swim and it just so uh be uh what happened is that the Lifeguard that was not on duty that they happened to be skating by the pool at the same time that I fell in and she had skates on right and she she took one skate off but couldn't get the other one off but she jumped into the pool with one skate on and she got me out of the pool and they called 9-1-1 at that time and and all I remember is is uh waking up and all these people were surrounding amen this little fell in the arms of a of a fireman and uh and and somehow they pumped the water out and and and they had a helicopter there and all these people and the firemen did something I'm laying in his lap they probably thought I was gone and all of a sudden my eyes just popped open Hallelujah I want to tell you something that lady that day [Music] became my savior she'd not been there that attribute would not have been expressed I don't even know if she's a Christian I'm gonna tell you another thing I don't even know her name I haven't kept in contact with her whatever happened that day that it ended on that day but that day that lady became a savior to me the attribute was expressed in her but I'm here to tell you I needed a greater savior than that oh I was trying to save it the reason I needed a great escape because I was sinking open sin open the peaceful Soul very deeply Glory staying with him I was seeking to rise no more hey Superman [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] than that now I know my savior's name Hallelujah not every relationship with my savior Glory Hallelujah we needed a savior see my my life was Justice I mean my spiritual life was worse than my natural life drowning in that pool some of us are drowning in a pool of sin but my God got somebody who can rescue you and let me tell you something mama can't do it Daddy can't do it Pastor can't do it but Jesus can this is why you gotta have a personal experience with the Lord Jesus you're wandering drowning in sin don't know which way to turn but there's a savior somebody can save you from that put you on the right path Hallelujah he's a savior glory to his name my God my God my God my God man cannot redeem himself he needs a redeemer man cannot save himself I was drowned I could not save myself I needed a savior God begins to tell the story salvation or Redemption through the various characters in the scripture one of them a man is in the uh uh the character of Joshua and we just look at a man Joshua 10 and 6. the scripture says something about him and you know Joshua was um he was the one that was ordained to lead the people into the Promised Land and uh you know and as he's taking a man he brother Brandon even say he had a greater responsibility than even Moses did because they had to take a man then he had to divide the land up to him you know all appropriately and uh you know and one of the things that happened with Joshua my God uh uh he he made a an agreement with some people that he never should have made an agreement with and when he made that agreement he had to hold to his word no matter what conditions the people was in he had to hold to his word it kind of showed one of the attributes of God that when God makes you a promise no matter what the condition he has to hold to his word surgery no surgery God the heart to his word thank you hey he will never he'll never go back on his word brother I I tell you he'll bankrupt the heavens before you can call him a liar you're gonna find a way to make that thing come to pass Joshua you know was there he made this agreement it's people to give me a night so I believe their name was and uh um you know after he got tricked by them and made disagreement but he had to hold to his word now there was a situation where the Gibby Knights got themselves in trouble Hallelujah in Joshua 10 6 it says this the men of gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp of gilgall my saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us so this attribute of Savior was being manifested in Joshua now yeah this is a little deep this is going to go a little deeper now look at this they weren't even asking for God to come help right where was God represented when your family is calling calling to you for prayer they're not going directly to God why are they coming to you because the attributes of God are expressed through you [Music] oh imma read it a little bit later I might as well say it now we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but we worship in Christ and young the hope of glory oh Hallelujah the man of giving Senator Joshua to the camp uh to the camp to gilgall saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains that gather together against us so salvation came through Joshua's Ministry amen all right let's go on a little further his name actually meant Jehovah's savior that's what the name Joshua means so let me just read a little quote out of the way of a true prophet of God the way of a true prophet of God it says this says then I gave the illustration of how that Israel on the march to the promised land they had never seen that land they know nothing about it they just had a promise of God there was a land and it was full of milk and honey and good and a great place they had never seen it nobody had ever been there or know nothing about it but they had the promise of it and by faith they sojourned through the desert and when they got right to the borderline they had a warrior there by the name of Joshua which means Jehovah's savior so he crossed over to Jordan into the promised land and brought back the evidence that the lamb was there I like that he says and it was a good land two-man pack one bunch of grapes it was a good land so he brought back the evidence that the land that they were going to possess was there all right he goes on it says now to the church we adjourning him to the land of immortality a land where there is no death a land where there's no dads raised up and we had a great savior in our camp and Jesus means Jehovah's savior beloved and he crossed the Jordan of death over into the other land and come back and brought the evidence that we live after death amen so where is death at my God can't stop us so here I want to just kind of show something Joshua crossing over amen into the promised land and bringing back the evidence that it was a good land was a perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ crossing over amen and bringing back evidence that there's life after death I just wrote These down he crossed Jordan and brought back a good report that the land was flown with milk and honey Jordan and the spiritual represents death and Jesus went across Jordan and rose again amen after the third day he proved that the lamb was good on the other side of death amen father believer it's an eternal land where we never get sick and we won't die again it's a land flowing with milk and honey amen I'm gonna tell you can live a life where you ain't got to be afraid of death sometimes you live a life where you scared you you're running in fear all the time like oh I hope I don't die I hope Lord if you get me out of this you ain't got to live like that Lord if you get me out of this there's a reason they got you out in the first place amen but by here here you can live a life where it's like if God take me right now it's it's Well with My Soul yeah we're about calling home and can't can't connect with Mama Can't Catch daddy can't catch nobody on the phone you wanted the Rapture took place you ain't gotta live and feel like that just give your heart to Jesus and you can have this peace that passes all understanding God began to tell the story of Salvation and Redemption through various characters in the scripture I want to pick up another scripture here really quick um and this scripture is actually where my thought was was uh originated from I referred to it um in the past but I never read it to you Nehemiah 9 verse 24 Nia Maya nine Lord while you had me save this scripture for the day Nehemiah nine verse 24. God is a good god Nehemiah 9 and verse 24 says this so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subdue us before them the inhabitants of the Lamb the Canaanites and gave us them into their hands with their kings and the people of the Lamb that they might do with them as they would and they took strong cities and a fat lamb and possess Houses full of all Goods Wells dig Vineyards and Olive yards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thou law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations therefore thou deliverest them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cry unto thee that's all you need to do when you're in trouble just crying to him when they cry unto thee thou hurteth then from heaven and according to thy manifold Mercies thou camest him not just one savior but the Bible say thou gave us them saviors plural so you see that the attribute of Salvation is expressed through the members of his body you know I I there's another quote I ain't got it here with me but I brother Branham said that the bride is the blood of Christ on the Earth today you realize the great place that we play you are the blood of Christ yes sir thou gave us them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies I was just looking at this because the Hebrew lexicon when you look click on that word savior's there it means to be delivered to be liberated be saved um uh to be victorious in battle right it also means this to save from moral trouble amen all right that's good so sometimes God can send you a savior that might be bringing you advice might be speaking to you amen advice and it's Godly advice and they could be saving you from moral troubles because those moral troubles will lead you to Greater trouble your moral failures will lead to Greater troubles oh hallelujah hallelujah but God wants to send Save Us he'll send the pastor as a savior he'll send Mom and Daddy as a savior he'll send a mother in the church as a savior to save you from your destruction let's look at a scripture I'm gonna just just write this a little bit Exodus 2 17. this when you click on that word savior there in the Greek Lexicon it just kind of goes through all kind of scriptures amen uh and and here's one that will find Exodus 2 17. this is Moses Hallelujah Moses was there uh watching he wasn't even watching he was just he just happened to be at a well one day and uh and and Jethro's daughters came out to get some water for that for the sheep and for the animals and Moses saw these men come and just kind of Bogart their way so Moses stood up and he had to step in and become a he had to be a savior and the Shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them when the Bible said he helped them that means he became a savior amen and helped them and watered their flock here's another one in Exodus 14 and verse 30. Hallelujah this is God himself showing that he's a savior thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore God himself expressing this attribute of Salvation let's pick up another one in second Kings chapter 13 verse one through five God just showed him that this attribute was always there but something had to be in trouble before he could actually express it Hallelujah see I'm going to tell you um sometimes we don't we we know God through our parents experience we know God through our pastors experience but we don't know God through our own experience and the only way you're going to get to know God through your own experience you're gonna have to go through your own things and when you when he delivers you from your own things then you can stand up and testify and say I know him as a savior because he saved me my God my God that that that that some mean a little bit multi when you got your own experience when I think about the goodness of Jesus and all he's done for me because I ain't talking about for you I'm talking about for me my soul Cries Out Hallelujah I thank God for saving me yes sir amen all right Second Kings 13 verse one through five and the three and twentieth year of Joe asked the son of a has he a king of Judah Jehovah has the son of jehu began to Reign Over Israel and Samaria and reigned 17 years and he did that which was even the sight of the Lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the sons the son of nabat which made Israel a sin he departed not there from and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and delivered them into the hand of Hazel king of Syria and into the hand of binidad the son of hazia all their days and Jihad has be sought the Lord he began to cry out to God now anytime you're in trouble just begin to cry out to God and Jihad Jihad has but sought the Lord and the Lord hearken unto him for he saw the oppression of Israel because the king of Syria oppressed him look at this and the lord gave Israel a savior so they would that so that they went out from under the hand of syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before time now according to history this this uh savior that they got was actually somebody from a whole nother land that came and fought the king of Syria and it brought Deliverance to Israel God used somebody else to bring Salvation God used somebody else to bring Deliverance God used somebody else to express that attribute through and if God was sinned amen the Israelites when they were in trouble a savior what will he do for you Abraham was a savior to life lot got himself in trouble and see here's the thing about a savior you got to understand this this attribute the thing about the same is that you so far messed up you can't do nothing about it you so deep in you can't help yourself out of it you need a savior you need to say the same times your doctor can be a savior huh amen because they got they can they can help you get out of the situation that's you in your body's so messed up you need a savior [Music] God allows this attribute to be expressed in so many different ways amen oftentimes we want to limit it to just just just just this Christmas day but this attribute has been expressed throughout history and it is still being expressed through his bride brother random makes this statement here uh in the message the faith of the the faith of Abraham he says when when you're saved when you're saved God gives you a checkbook at the bottom of it it's got Jesus's name signed on every check any Redemptive blessing belongs to you are you afraid to fill it out and Abraham's children and are you afraid he won't recognize the name of Jesus whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do that's the promise your Abraham's children you're not afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize the name of Jesus on any Redemptive blessing that his body's setting at the right hand of God making intercessions for that's what he died for says now Abraham sure he was Heir then after a while a lot got in trouble says now we'll close in a minute lot got in trouble and you always get in trouble when you backslide wish we had time to dwell on that but he got in trouble what happened the enemy come and packed him off took him somewhere he never thought he'd be at right says now Abraham played the part of the Savior again all the way back in Genesis this attribute of Salvation is being expressed when when lot found himself in trouble he couldn't save himself let me let me let me just finish reading this he gathers himself and went after the enemy that's took away the his poor Bachelor corrupted brother that's what Jesus did sickness bound you sin bounds you poor backslid and corrupted and Jesus came in and went after you he brought lot back Abraham did look at this now Lord was overtaken and captured he had he he uh had he and his City been strong enough they would have defeated the opposing Army hallelujah amen had he and his City been strong enough they would have defeated the opposing Army but lot needed someone greater than he was to bring Deliverance amen he had he had a man a savior got to be willing to put it all on the line a savior got to be willing to Amen to take uh take it right to death's door amen amen a savior got to be willing to die for you Hallelujah we just can't go around amen claiming it's time to not be willing to Amen to put some skin in the game [Music] Hallelujah but Abraham shows that he had this attribute he was willing to take whatever he had all he had was Farm instruments he didn't have a gun he didn't have a cannon he didn't have a spirit he had Farm instruments but he took his farm instruments and with them and conquered that army a savior put it all on the line oh Hallelujah I'm thinking about a amen a a young lady a man that one day let me just get my place here one day she was uh she was coming home from college and she was uh on the train glory to God coming home from college and her and a friend was there on the train and and a friend looked out the window said oh wow they was talking about everybody amen if they were coming home and look at this person look at that person and they had they done got underneath that anointing glory to God and uh and so so now today under the anointed see she should have broke that anointed don't talk about them they don't you don't know why they like that she should have broke that as soon as it started but she allowed herself to get caught up underneath that anointing amen and then they get to a spot and a friend takes it a little further than the girl wanted it to go she said now look at that lady my why did she why is she even outside looking like that and then officiency I don't know why she like that Hallelujah and then she gotta get off the get off the train like she'll know the lady what a conductor got both on a friend say I I ain't taking the train no further I need to have a conversation with you how can you let sit here and let that girl talk about your mama like that call all them kind of names say say now you a pretty young lady and I give you that but your mama was way more prettier than you are but you want to know what happened there was a fire one day in a house amen and when and when your mom was outside they didn't realize that she didn't realize if they would come to fire for her house she knew you was upstairs in the crib and and the firemen would not go upstairs to get you so she sacrificed her beauty she ran through the flame to the fire she would have been got you and took the clothes off her back wrapped you in the clothes so she could protect your beauty and she came running down the stairs she sacrificed everything she had in order to save you and you're gonna sit here and let somebody talked about her like that mama was willing to be [Music] you got to be willing to put it all on the line for your family you got to be willing to be a savior [Music] see oftentimes in family we want to be judged but he sent saviors what are you willing to sacrifice for the family what are you willing to give up for for the family for the sake of the family a lot needed someone greater than he was to bring Deliverance and he had a relative that was willing to do whatever it took to bring Salvation see when we look at that scripture that he sent save us over in Nehemiah 9 27 thou gave us some savings you can just go all through scripture um go back to the Book of Judges and you would see there was a number amen of different times that God used saviors um men that were raised up as judges and that they would bring Deliverance to the people um shamgar Barack Gideon Jeffy Samson even himself was a savior and I recently this year the Lord just kind of put that in my spirit when I looked at Esther Esther's highest position was not to be Queen that's what she thought but our highest position was to be savior and God put us there just to see if that would be expressed to her and then put her under pressure because Esther had to come to a a a a a a revelation herself if I die let me die you say look look let's say I know if I if I don't get that scepter I'm gonna die but if I die let me die I'm gonna go in and see the king there was only two people higher than Haman in the Kingdom that was that was a king in Esther but nobody else can invite Haman to dinner he'd show up and go to dinner only Esther could do something like that but Mordecai had to let her know how how do you know how do you not know that God didn't bring you to the kingdom for such a time as this and what time was that it was time for her to express the attributes [Music] oh I just love Jesus my God my God rehab no rehab was not a prostitute God had a higher position for Rahab she just needed an opportunity [Music] and and when these these two they took it back and I got a quote for this I got a quote let me read something to you about rehab this is out of the sermon God's wrapped gift brother Brandon preached this on December 25th 1960. look at listen to something here bear with me are y'all with me rehab the Harlot that we're all familiar with she being a young girl that was turned on the street by a heathen father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring an income to them on prostitution her mama and her daddy cited because she was beautiful that they could make some money off their daughter and turn her into a prostitute I'm trying I I can't even read the rest of the quote I'm gonna just have to just inject because this just this as I was reading to say wait a minute her mama agreed to this I can dad has got some strange thoughts sometimes especially if they're not working men [Music] but Mama agreed or something like this that you would put your daughter out there in the streets and make money off of have her bring the money home to your house to pay bills now now this is this is a thing to me if Rahab lived today and she went to a man a counselor for therapy I can understand rehab being upset with her parents I'm upset with both my mama and my daddy but when the when the spies came rather than rehab showing amen how upset she was with her parents rehab begin to act like a save feel like shouting the word makes me sound rehab begin to act like a savior the saving Jesus acted on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do perhaps said I'm happy about my house having this token but what about my father and my mother what about my brothers and my sisters the two spies say if you can just get them you just get them in the house and whoever's underneath this token they blood be on us she had a right [Music] she had a right to hold the grudge against her parents [Music] but a savior got to be willing to sacrifice [Music] you [Music] can see this attribute being expressed through characters of the scripture when you look at me to see man salvation he sent saviors all all along up Abraham all the way up he's sin and save you save your save you save your savior but why did we need Jesus [Music] Matthew 1. verse 20. primary reason you needed Jesus because man can't redeem himself there's a lot of folk when I got saved by that lifeguard out of water it's one thing to be saved out of water it's one thing to be saved in an accident maybe somebody get you out of a fire that's one form of salvation but a greater form because there was nobody that could save me from my sins that's why I needed Jesus Matthew 1 verse 20 says but while he fought on these things behold the angel the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to taking the mayor thy wife of that that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and he and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins that's why we needed Jesus a savior is a preserver Defender deliverer is also a further uh definitionist Jesus Christ saves the soul from condemnation to holiness and the and the body from the ruin of the grave and constitutes every believer in the heritor of immortality and eternal glory being the Son of God he became incarnate that he might by his obedience to the law of God and his enduring of his penalty or the curse he made atonement for the sin of the world and and by that he became the author of Eternal salvation to all them that obey him let's pick up two last quotes here and we will bring it to a close here smyrnian Church age one of my favorite I want you to just think about our Lord we we get the opportunity to go back and and talk about his birth specifically amen talk about his birth especially on this day we know he was not born on this day Jesus was born in the springtime and he also died in the springtime how do we know he was born in springtime because he was the Lamb of God and Lambs are born in the springtime hallelujah amen amen but let's talk about Jesus smirnian Church age says this oh how striking it is see we had to have something that was stronger than us to be able to bring us out of what we were in let me if you if you're bound in sin today you got to have something that's stronger than that sin that can bring you out and I'm telling you he is able Jesus Christ is able to do it you call the pastor all the pastor can do is pray for you but if you really want to come out you get to talking to Jesus he'll bring you out how striking it is jehovah-born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your Everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own Theology and denied the truth of god Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking Barn I was just you know sharing with somebody a few days ago uh sometime I just get you know I'm human I'm human sometimes I just get so discouraged I'd be like Lord come on I knew you got something for us open it up God open it up and I just I just be ready and then during the Lord just kind of Quicken something to me and I then I stopped complaining I said Lord you went to a cross and you died for my sins I can go to a school I can I can go to Fairfield Inn you didn't ask for a cross you're just sit there feeling I can do that sometimes God has to put you in check get your attitude right my attitude anyway thank you Lord Jehovah got a crying baby in a stinking Barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our nose is criticizing and acting as though we are we were somebody he's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah watching the feet of fishermen I will give you a sign uh said God not the son of a white collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you'll want or think suitable but it isn't an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and and spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked on the cross while the Hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah dying look at this one Jehovah praying and nothing happened then Jehovah died that is a sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one then Darkness Came Upon the Earth they put him in a tomb they relay those three days and and nights and Earth and earthquakes shattered the Gloom of night and he came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to dwell in his church that's why those attributes are now being expressed through US Jehovah came back with with a mighty Russian wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people what's more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people glory to his name and again Jehovah heals the sick well how's he doing it because he on on the earth when he when he was walking to face Earth with his own Natural Body he was healing sick but now he's died he's raised again he's empowered his people so now how is he Healing The Sick through his people you are an expression of his attribute and again Jehovah heals the sick raises the Dead you can pray for the day at the race amen and manifest himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation Jehovah came down and raised a prostitute to sin no more the same God that raised up Rahab you know because everybody else in the city died rehab was able to get married and she married the general of the army the Israel army and you know they stood there and they were they got to the part of the serum sea if there be anybody if there be one just one here that that could speak against this woman mayor and this man or this man marrying this woman speak now or forever hold your peace and I'ma tell you Ray happen to have to sit there wondering who was gonna speak hello somebody she realized that everybody that was outside of the house was dead her past was dead and today your past can die and you can come alive in Christ no condemnation to them who walk after the spirits Hallelujah amen I just love God amen look at Jehovah came down raised he raised The Prostitute to sin no more the game came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh yes sir can I say that again they came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh will anybody just yield they flesh to God you can use my flesh Jehovah Cain God in us the hope of glory one last quote here we'll call it the service man I'm happy to be here on this Christmas Day brother random preached another sermon on January 25th I went and tried to find a sermon every time he preached on January 25th I mean December 25th tried to find a sermon and we got one amen a little earlier uh that just seemed to just fit right in on God's rap gift just talking about Rahab the Harlot I just just oh I just love that are now picking up one the deity of Jesus Christ amen he says something there and and it's just it's just so important for us to realize who we are in God what he's done for us what he is doing for us all that God was he poured into Christ but it didn't stop there oh that Christ not was all that Christ is and the good thing about he is pouring it as we're sitting here we're actually receiving an outpouring can we put it like this we're getting a download you're getting an update and don't be afraid to click on your updates because

app again it'll be better [Music] [Applause] the deity of Jesus Christ and that same power that same Christ Hallelujah now brother Brandon spoke this in 1949. let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say is wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost all that God was is inside of you now it's just less in quantity but not in quality that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little Trot down something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quits the violence of fire they escaped the edge of Sword they raised the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity and brother sister that deity is in you a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the
