for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor calmliness and we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief we had and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely he had borne our grace and carried our sorrows yet we dared to steam him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened out his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from from prison and he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation but he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to prove him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall many my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore will i divide him a portion with the grave and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he

of life to your people that you for knew before the foundation of the world further before the earth came into existence before the universe was created we are he one time told the people that before abraham i am and before coronavirus we are and in time of cover 19 we are and after covet 19 we are because we are as eternal as you are we are not different from you and you are not different from us

god bless you our seraphims will bring us a praises and worship the lord bless you mightily amen glory hallelujah to the lord even without uh taking time let's pick our bible it seems the lord has a few things to speak to us so we want to make it while the sun shine blessed be the name of the lord we want to go to book of isaiah the gospel of isaiah chapter 60 verse 13 to 22 isaiah 60 13-22 to see what the lord has for us for the team or for the subject we want to speak on beulah the land of new possession beulah which if this is the third phase of that seminar we started last year so we want to continue and look it in another angle of what the lord is doing in this hour amen so let's read isaiah chapter 60 verse 13 to 22 and when you go home try and read the whole book of isaiah study it it's you it's the lord is talking to you amen we didn't have time to read the whole chapter else we will read the whole chapter i rise and shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon you darkness shall be upon the earth but you will receive light for the sake of time let's jump to the 13th verse the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fair tree the pine tree the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious amen it's talking about you the builder land the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee situations that are overwhelming will bow to you amen and all that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the source of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord if you take the word of the lord yes you're going to be rejected you're going to be despised by your friends and even family but stick to the word of the lord they will come and bow to you amen and they shall call it the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel whereas thou has been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellence excellency now he started talking about a city we know the city of west palm beach but now it's switching to eternal excellent city what is eternity it's christ amen it's not the city of west palm beach or miami you are the city of the living christ amen glory hallelujah to the lord thou shalt whereas thou has been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i'll make thee an excellent eternal albedian eternal excellency a joy of many generations thou shall also suck the milk of gentiles of the gentiles and thou shalt suck the brace of kings thou shalt know that i the lord am thy savior and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob for brass i will bring gold for iron i'll bring silva for wood brass and for stone's iron where you were lacking where you were missing the lord will give you abundance amen i'll also make thine offices peace and then exactly's righteousness violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting no destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and i get praise how do you call salvation amen i can see something on the wall but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for their father search to worship him amen so even in our natural sense we've got our walls is being beautiful by salvation but it's not the wall the bible is talking about you are the wall amen your sistine element is the wall that the lord is going to beautify with salvation and blessings amen let's finish quickly so that you can take your seed the sun this uh verse 20 okay 19 the sun shall be no more the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither the brightness neither for brightness shall the moon give give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an excellent and everlasting light and thy guard thy glory the sun shall no more go down neither shall the moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be the neverlasting light and the days of thy morning shall be ended thy people shall also be righteous thy people shall also shall all be righteous they shall inherit the land for for forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified and the last verse is a little one shall become a thousand and small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time shall we be seated glory hallelujah to the name verse 21 says that people shall be righteous your loved ones people that you are praying for as esther prayed for his people for her people to be redeemed and the lord the king gave esther the favor to redeem the people of esther all your people all that you are crying for the lord gave it to you amen your family your loved ones the lord has already redeemed them before the foundation of the world and they are righteous amen a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in time amen god bless you we want to talk about a subject biula the land of new possession glory to the living christ and we want to tie in what the lord is doing on earth and then tie into the church and then tie into your individual life amen because before the lord does something on earth he manifests it he show it in in the heavens and when the bible talks about heavens heavens is a three-fold language one fold is the sixth dimension before anything manifests before a tree comes upon the earth there's eternal tree in the celestial dimension and the image the elevation is what we see around the cocoa trees and all the pine trees and different trees that we see around before a human being would drop upon the earth from the womb of their mother or from their lords or their father that human being is a seed of god and that human being was already existing not as a human thinking but as a theophany a celestial being and then the celestial being creates or drops a terrestrial aspect called brother brother salomon kobadaku give me your name gary god bless you so before but again existed he was in the man of god not as a thought of a human thought but he was a celestial being amen so he's eternal as eternal can be amen because he came from elohim so before the lord does something he he announces it in the celestial dimension and the second fruit of heaven is the skies because the first bible god created is not this paper bible that we read it's not the torah and the scroll but the first bible was the zodiac the nature the universe it's all the bible of god the sun is christ the moon is the wife of christ the stars are the manifold sons and daughters of god from adam to the last one the lord will ever create amen and the third fault heaven is the church that is you so we want to look at it in one fold so let's go to a few quotes just to create a background and then we go from there let's read from the the first six the first seal six three zero one one eight c one paragraph sixty two the first seal 630318 paragraph 62. he cometh in this age he's talking about christ the efficient age revealed sent the messenger paragraph 63 notice what happens as we go along here is the plan of it the first things happen is this announcement in the heavens first that is before the lord will do something he announces it in the heavens the sixth dimension the zodiac and in the church what happens a seal is open what is that a mystery unfolded see and when a mystery unfold then a trumpet sounds it declares a war a plague falls and a church age opens see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war amen so just for you to know that before the lord will do something before the seven seals that we have now been revealed to us it's no longer mystery the lord revealed it in the zodiacs the lord revealed to the celestial dimension because he closed it he kept his secret from adam until the seventh angel messenger until 1963 for six thousand plus years mankind didn't know those mysteries portion of the bible was mystery people read the book of revelation and they feel like it's some figurative language i think somebody told abraham that i think john uh had some hard paper and the puppet kind of got into his brain and he scribed a book of revelation because it doesn't make sense you know grasshoppers and uh a woman with a hair a grasp of the hair that just doesn't make sense but it's the word of the lord in cold form amen and when the time came the lord began to declare in the zodiac in the heavenly dimension in the church even in politics in science before the lord unveiled it to his people amen so whenever the lord wants to do something he proclaims it in the celestial dimensions first before he brings it to this earth i want us to read another quote from the message communion 620204 1962 communion paragraph 74 we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part or first part of the month beginning on the second or the fifth or somewhere along this month the indian astronomers predict that the world the world to blow to pieces and the american newspapers made make fun of it i do not believe that i do not believe that the walls is going to blow to pieces but i do but i do see it's wrong to make fun of it because something is fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so on he didn't mention the two of them come fought into the orbit now that was their lineup they never have did it oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back there to know it now this is where i want us to know this word belongs to now he comes to the church paragraph 75 i predict that this has a spiritual application i believe that is the coming in of the issue of god that the great revelations of the word will be opened during this time remember the claim it was three stars came into their orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace the number of grace there is a number of perfection five is the number of grace j-e-s-u-s that's jesus grace g-a-g-r-a-c grace faith f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace god ever sends his power to the church it will be by his grace it will be the obedience of the people glory hallelujah let me repeat that if god will ever send his uh grace his power unto the church it will be by grace amen it's not going to be by the obedience of the people now if you flip it you say oh hallelujah praise god i don't have to obey god to get blessing hey let's go drink let's go party let's go have fun you know because god is going to bring his blessing anyway you never understood the word of the lord if that's what you think then you miss you miss the revelation entirely god is going to bring his blessing you you can't wait to get it you don't deserve it but by his predestination and his love and grace he forgive your sins and your errors and everything about you and give you his grace but you don't turn grace into this grace that oh praise god the lord is gracious whatever i do the lord loves me so i can do whatever i want i can go and kill i can go and run with women and men the lord doesn't care it means you have made the revelation you didn't start you didn't even get an iota of it but the grace is what you don't deserve you were supposed to be condemned you and i but he came down to give his life so that he died that you will give get life and life eternally amen blessed be the name of the lord glory hallelujah so that will be by his grace god sent anything it will be by his grace not our merits so it means so it may mean something i predict that there will be a change that's what i want us to note i don't know what it will be but i believe it's fixing to happen we are on it right on the if of it and if any man hungers let him come to christ if any man is thirsty let him come to christ he quenches the thirst he's the satisfier of all our thirst and hunger amen so whatever you desire just come to christ it's in christ he satisfied the thirst and quenches your hunger blessed be the name of the lord so before the lord will do something as we read from those two coats the lord already give a prelude of what he's going to do by sending it in the zodiacs and recently i think just barely a month ago but a jack preacher someone here it was wednesday service sometimes blessings a lot of deep revelation comes during the wednesday services sunday services sometimes it's just like sharing food everyone get their portion but when wednesday teaching fewer but merrier so let's let's try and make it to the wednesday service because certain things i preach on wednesday that you don't get them on sunday so i remember preaching about they talk about the two planets that line up that was in december somewhere 21st uh two planets which is uh saturn and jupiter line up and they call it the great uh what is it the greek junction is what conjunction thank you the great conjunction so that was the true planet and thank god god blessed by the jack i said wow the lord is doing something here why two planets why the great conjunction to the earthly man is beautiful the admired is the beauty of creation yes we all thank the lord for giving those things but there's spiritual connotation to the true conjunction let me just make sure i have the dates at the times right just give me one second it looks like i left one of my my notebook in the office oh it's right here it's hiding right here got it praise god hallelujah so now just right after that january 9th and january 12th there was another conjunction this time it was a triple conjunction now the two planets which is uh saturn and jupiter line up already the mercury the smallest planet also line up with these two planets in a form like a triangle and triangle is just a circle which has been extrapolated to get three corners so triangle is actually a circle if you remove that three corners you can form a circle out of the triangle it means the lord is doing something all the planets used to go by themselves now two planets line up they almost came close together they became a conjoint like so close according to scientists you can put it in your finger that is the wonders of the lord if two planets collide the whole orbit will change into chaos but there's a person who controls the planet the one who's put that planet into into creation you can let them come so close yet so they won't hit each other that is what the lord does amen the lord can permit trials and tribulation and the devil to push you so close to death but the lord will bring you right back to life because his love is greater than whatever any power can do amen glory hallelujah to the lord so now these two planets sorry these three planets line up on earth and according to scientists when those three planets line up they they don't happen usually but when they line up then there's something according to astronomical data we don't study astronomy but from the church it's aquarius gemini and libra also line up aquarius is the teaching ring the lord bringing the blessing gemini is a twin the blessings in double portions and libra is the fifone ministry what is a fight for ministry it doesn't mean but a jaguar it's all of us every one of us is a minis is part of the fifo ministry you might not stand here to preach but your your heart is your pulpit your life that you testify outside here is a fifo ministry amen mothers are fight for ministries sisters are fight for ministries brothers are fightful ministries children are fight for ministry the life the life of christ that you portray to people out there not necessarily here you can dress up here as a holy christian man or woman but if your life doesn't have till with your holiness then you are fake people will not see that life of christ in you but when jesus christ is on the center of your of your heart and when you have not even spoken people can look at you this lady this my co-worker this guy there's something about him i want to find out because there's a deep in you and that deep is calling is calling it's an attraction unto the person to see that there's something about you there's something in you and he find that that is christ in you and that is the fight for ministry so the libra is not just somebody who was born under the sound of libra but it's just for the whole body of christ glory hallelujah so this uh what they call it lines houses the zodiac houses also line up when you have this planet lining up and now in the wall sense it said we it outshed the earth into the air or the mind age remember when this is the the bible the lord uses certain elements of the earth god uses the earth the water the the fire and the air to manifest his glory now god use animals or creation like uh the lamp uh the bear is it a bear no i'm not talking about the bed the cow or the buu and also the ego and a man to manifest his attribute the messengers the seven church ages so the last messenger was under the sign of an ego he could see william brahm had a discernment he could turn his back at the audience and tell your name where you were born where you came from what sickness that the doctors cannot diagnose it wasn't william brown because jesus christ who took a redeemed son of god and used his flesh to manifest his glory just like he's taking your flesh and my flesh to manifest eternal attributes if you let him amen so that was and also that is going to usher the earth into a great technological advancement we know of ai artificial intelligence that is where we are going now right now when uh around the night uh about two decades ago the earth was ushered into the planet pluto took an influence on earth what was that influence great advancements in science and technology and communication there's communication people can live in uh on their moon they go to the moon and they communicate with people on earth there's communication everywhere you can just press button click your cell phone someone in asia africa will get it in instance just a second it doesn't have to be a you just press button age that's what the best i can call it because technology has gone is so advanced but now we are going to move into a higher version of that advancement way beyond what we have now we still have is it 3g now where are we going to 5g it shows that the more we do those things the more we bring problems upon ourselves because it goes it comes with cancer depression with the wi-fi that we use they have their effect of course the companies want to make their billions and trillions so they will not disclose everything to you but they have a deleterious effect on human body because sometimes when you when it happens to me personally when there's an incoming call and my phone is around me my heart miss a beat and i realize that the radiation is coming on so they affect our body the hanging of the vehicles pain pain they all affected that's why we don't live long like the time of the time of abraham or even about let's say five generations back people used to live more than they were strong they could walk from here to boca rat is what whatever they call it right people can walk from here to miami it's like a mystery walking to miami are you crazy what's wrong with you just even if you don't have a car just go by the bus get a train get to uber we have uber so we don't walk you know we have things are easy you just sit on the jet it will take you to asia like six eight hours it will take you to africa 20 hours you take you to india 21 hours so we've got all this technology yes we use them i'm speaking to a microphone we use them for the things of god as sons and daughters of god but it's got its negative aspect as well so the earth is going to go into science now there was it's even changing the way we fight militaries change it used to be we used to have the old fashioned way of fighting people military will meet like the bible times people fight soldiers will fight kill people no no now it's colloquia it's a kick let's use technology right we can send a missile into wherever you are we've got gps right global positioning what satellite one pastor one brother said he said a gas provided a spirit on the flip side on on the on is a type of the holy spirit so we have the holy ghost so now what they do is they use missiles to kill people there was one uh iranian scientist who was one of them who helped develop their new nuclear station in iran and israel you know iran and israel is so close so they find a way to eliminate him they didn't send a soldier they just sent a weapon a controlled weapon in his car and he blew him to pieces he just killed him so it's defining even how we're gonna fight countries are gonna fight they don't have to come out your back door and come and fight your people no they'll just send a missile they'll just uh press a button and something will come and hit you so now we are going to go into more advancement and we see that in politics as well there was a time that women could not even vote women were relegated to their back door they couldn't go out their husbands and brothers and fathers have to go and maybe buy newspapers and come and tell them the story because they were women but over the years women have gone so forward and now we have them have them at the helm of politics of course we've got women in in high places in politics we've got clinton was a secretary of state she was even a presidential candidate she didn't win though but she got so close but now we've got a one vice president we've got a donald trump we've got a joe biden and i could see them in the three planets that are lining up in the political sense now the two planets where the main competitors were biden and trump it looks like trump saw that biden was a strong competitor so he started fighting his way up with a rush air with his son and different things and it kept on going but now when uh was the name when biden took carmela as a vice president candidate it changed the ball game now the attention is not so much of course there's a fight what you know went on in washington but the attention is coming more on women the natural is typing the spiritual if the natura is allowing women to come to the helm of politics the lord is bringing his wife like esther and ahi soros to where he's supposed to be amen so the natura is just a type of the spiritual app praise god hallelujah and the planet mercury is in in the word mercury is coming from it came from a roman word it was a roman god of comets travel and eloquence and it's also cunning and deceptive in the natura the women are coming into power i mean they are very eloquent it used to be that women like i said women oh they don't even have they used to be up in america here about 100 200 years ago if your husband or your father died you can't even inherit your brother has to step in it and take care of the land and different things for you but not now no women are just saying yes ma'am that's what we do now women are at the affairs women have more a master's degree than men if you go to medical schools there are more women than men i'm an eyewitness so women are climbing so high and what is happening in the natura has a spiritual connotation glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen so the lord is using and these natural things set it up to type what is doing on earth what is doing in his church the church is the woman the church is the wife the church is the bride the queen the body of christ and so the lord is using as the natural one in politics in religion in science the lord is also using typing what is happening is bringing the anta type the reality in his church what he's trying to achieve in the church of the living god if the whole world men and women are trying to get women to be a president to be at the helm of our face what is the lord doing with his wife what is the lord doing with this church what is the lord doing with you and i he's trying to bring you to the helm that this is my missus this is my wife this is me this is my body this is manifestation of my character message jesus christ queen jesus christ the body of jesus christ is the same thing jesus christ glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the lord is good amen let me just take a sip of water the lord is good glory hallelujah amen now that is the the world system that is science but let's come back home to the church glory to the lord amen as this planet are lining up in triple conjunction double conjunction the lord is lining up his people in triple and double conjunctions remember the year 2020 was the year for double blessings and we had about blessings too coronavirus was a blessing under disguise [Music] the lord sometimes allowed things to come on earth to purge us to bring things into manifestation so the lord permitted this and nothing will happen that the lord hasn't permitted that will happen nothing can take your life no demon no sickness no satan can touch you if the lord jesus christ didn't permit it and if he permitted it and he permitted for his glory that he will heal you he'll resurrect you rapture you give you millennium peace and rest in your life to identify his attributes to show you his love for you amen blessed be the name of the lord glory hallelujah now the builder land our titus the builder the land of new possession we've already possessed a lot of things but there's a new possession as we drop into the year 2021 possession does not destroy means having buildings and houses and business those are the attributes those are the benefits of eternal life because we are seed of abraham royal city of abraham the lord give you celestial blessings and give you earthly blessings as well so the lord will bless you with whatever your finance money husband wife children whatever just name it whatever you want to achieve the lord has them for you amen but there's more greater than that than the earthly blessing because those things we are not going to take them with us when you draw from the earth if i leave my earth i'm not going to take this with me no you can't take a house with you you can't take your wife and your children with you you can't take your husband with you the only thing you take with you is the character of jesus christ the theophany the holy spirit baptism and that's the most important thing in any person's life that you have to ask yourself lock yourself in a room and ask yourself do i have what it it takes to transition to this from this earth to my next destination if the lord should take my breath now if you don't have it then don't get out of the room be on your knees so you get what it takes amen because your life is not in your hands your life is in the hands of the lord amen so be like the land of new possession we have definitely already but billa means ownership master lord married and claimed as a wife it's a heavenly zion and then another word that also explains in manifestation is half ziba my delight is in her hair is who the church you the lord the light is in you the delight of the husband is in the wife amen because the wife is expression it's just a feminine part of him it's part of him amen just like the husband is the masculine part of the woman so the two are one they just separate in manifestation as an attribute on earth glory hallelujah now the law doesn't if the lord is showing uh triple conjunctions and uh great conjunctions onto the world what is he doing in his church the lord is doing nothing in his church no he's doing great things in his church even right here amen and i want to take my next scripture it's just a short scripture psalm 81 verse 10 psalm 81 the book of psalms some of david 8-1 verse 10 it reads i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth white and i will feel it glory hallelujah this is the male portion of the scripture i want to read i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt opened thy mouth wide and now i will feel it what is egypt i've never been i was born in africa i've never been in egypt before i've flown past egypt so what egypt is allowed talking about some of you have never gone to egypt africa some of you never go to africa so what egypt is allah talking about is that country egypt no egypt is a condition right the country gives us a condition of the world condition of the old bed now he brought you from the old breath from the old civilization to the new civilization the eternal kingdom of the holy ghost baptism where everything is possible there's no impossibilities in your life amen because when you have the holy ghost christ is in you amen if you profess that i could you know have the holy ghost what i'm trying to say is that i am jesus christ because jesus christ is inhabiting in me and if jesus christ is in this flesh what is my limitation i do not have any if i have to pass through this wall my iman cannot do it but a christ in me can pass through this wall without any breakages and damages amen if you have to pop through this roof if it becomes necessary let's say there's a fire in this boat the doors are locked and you have to pop through this roof with children and everything the christ in you will make your way you pop this roof without any breakages and damages it has happened before before man invented automatic door the holy ghost in the time of peter was in jail he thought he was dreaming he saw somebody tell him to get up and put on your clothes and like was dreaming did dreaming and he was following somebody without really wasn't aware of what he was doing and before he could realize he's going through a door meanwhile the door has got military people standing there strong military with attention to make sure peter doesn't escape and they were vigilant they were awake and they passed through the door without even them noticing for greater he that is in you is greater than all the other things in the world amen so if you have the holy ghost that's who you are if you don't have it forsake whatever you have that is prevent you from having it and get this jewel of great prize if you know and you know and the lord knows and you know that you don't have the holy ghost christ on the inside you have a void an emptiness on the inside which cannot be satisfied by nothing in the world no money cannot satisfy us if so millennials and billionaires will not kill themselves people commit suicide when they've got millions and billions when they've got mansions when they've got properties beyond what you can imagine they just hung themselves killed themselves take tap pulse and die so that would not satisfy sex will not satisfy you the last of the flesh will not satisfy you attractions of the eyes will not satisfy you but there's a man jesus christ the lord himself the seed that was in you before the foundation of the world the house that you live in the celestial body the man who can speak and his word is here in amen when he activate himself in you when he quickens you and let you know that you are mine you are my daughter you are me and i am you amen and if you let me live in your flesh all things are possible the old things will be gone they'll be bygone and everything will become new you become a beulah the land of new possession all your inheritance that were missing that got lost it will be redeemed unto you glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen we just want to stay in the church now so that was a masculine scripture let me read the feminine scripture the female portion john 7 30 38 the book of john chapter 7 verse 38 and we put them together we're going to have a wedding today marrying two scriptures amen glory hallelujah he said he that belief on me as the scriptures have said out of his belly shall flow reverse of living waters reverse of living water out of your belly how can my belly water come out of my belly that'd be a sickness if you see water coming from your belly there'll be no that'd be no joke you'll probably run to your doctor quickly you're going to cover the jaguar jack i've never seen this before so it's not the the scriptures the lord and the prophet and men and women of god use the natural language to portray to a reveal unravel spiritual things that the lord is doing so out of your belly your heart is your belly your heart is your faith so when you believe you become what you believe believe means eating when you eat the lord jesus christ you become the lord jesus christ if you say i do as you are having aware then lord i do i believe you i accept you i am you i want to be you i want to save you i want to be see jesus christ and when you accept the lord get into get into your heart now you become the lord jesus christ and whatever attribute that is in the lord jesus christ is imparted on to you and when you speak your word is not the word of a man or word of a woman what the what your word is the word of the lord jesus christ and out of you your faith your revelation shall flow blessings rivers of living waters it will bring people of the lord it will bring sins into manifestation amen just as one person believe the word of the lord start a church call it a spiritual tabernacle and out of it has flown living waters all the people here there are living waters amen water is people amen water is not just water it's what people the people of the lord is referred to as water amen glory hallelujah the lord is good amen so now the first scripture was the masculine portion i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i'll feel it let me quickly read some two codes before i narrow it down blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ let's read uh endlessly contending for the fifth five four zero four zero four m endlessly contending for the fifth five four zero four zero four m paragraph 20. i'll just keep the first portion and i'll go to your questions that i depend on the holy ghost not knowing not knowing one thing god knows that what to say this morning i never take thought of what to say i go to the platform let him do the leading that's all but he promised if you open your mouth i will feel it i'm repeating certain words and setting freeze take note if you open your mouth i'll feel it so that he's done that for 20 23 years and i'm not worried i'm not worried in the road i trust him amen in other words the lord promised him that if you will abraham open your mouth i'll feel it so he's been opening his mouth since he accepted the lord and the lord has kept feeling it feeling it and it's not tired of it you want more feeling amen feeling and refilling keep feeling now it's not naturally filling things up food in your mouth shoving some delicious uh kick in your throat no it's the word of the lord that fills your superman supernatural being amen when the lord fills you when the holy ghost fools you it activates you it makes you a living being it makes you a supernatural being it makes your way beyond the worst of a person become the person of the lord jesus christ so let me see i think yes so for let me read the second quotes that is the true vine and a false vine 550607 the true vine and the false vine paragraph 9 and may the glory of god come down upon us and bless us like it was in the day of pentecost shakana pentacles god repeated again tonight give us an outpouring of thy blessings may we sit not with an umbrella over us and i want to post a pulse of anticipation do not sit with umbrella over you just like if it rains and you don't ruin the rain to fall upon you what do you do you get your umbrella and the rain will not touch you now some of us are spiritually doing that god i want a blessing for you but we've got an umbrella on top of us and the blessing are not hating us they're blessed not trekking to other places but it doesn't come into our life they're naturalized about their spirit if you've got anything that is hindering you from getting the blessings of the lord getting the holy ghost baptism just let it go and let the lord take place if you have something holding on to something whatever it is you know it that is hindering your blessing that is not satisfying your heart right let it go and let the lord take take his abode in your heart if i'm holding on to your condition that condition could be a relationship it could be a wrong desire it could be pain in your heart it could be unforgiveness and actually unforgiveness scientists found that unforgiveness can lead to cancer if something somebody does something against you you might be innocent you might be the one on the right side but if you hold unforgiveness in your heart you end up getting cancers and tumors and diseases so it doesn't matter how close a person is the most painful thing is somebody who's very close to you when that person hits you it's most difficult to take it away but that is when you show that you are divine your human mind cannot do it but here that is in you the holy ghost in you can take it away and then you become stepping the condition for that person amen now moses was a man like you and i we know moses right he was a short-tempered person he was a brutal man he could kill you and bury you under under the sand without pharaoh and the military knowing moses did that he had a temper he had a wife that had a temper too two tempers together to to to to settle each other now about the lord touched moses when he came to uh the burning bush he saw a bush burning moses had never seen that he had seen visions before but he's never seen a bush burning and it wasn't being consumed so moses said you know what let me find what is going on here he went and there was no science science egypt ruled the world in science at that time yeah but there was no egyptian scientific basis that could uh that could uh explain why the bush was burning and not being consumed and a voice came from the bush moses this ground is the holy ground take off your shoe you are stepping the celestial dimension take off your reasoning mind and let the holy ghost let me lead you amen so that you can understand your life so that i can move you from being a failure on to being who i called you to be and moses yielded amen and the lord changed him there was a time that his own brother and his sister was teasing him mocking because he made an eg ethiopian ethiopian is a colored person like you and i but the lost choice the mind of the lord is different from your mind amen god can go outside the box and do what you want to do he's a sovereign god so the lord moved the anger of the lord raged against miriam and aaron and the lord wanted to slaughter them but what did moses do moses could have found it found a flame yes they mocked me lord kill them slaughter them is that what moses did no he's stepping the guard for them he said lord don't touch them and he pleaded for them because he has got their grace to speak to the pillar of fire the lord spoke to him face by face he showed visions and dreams to miriam and moses and uh and aaron but for moses the lord could come visibly and say moses my servant upon all the men on earth moses had all their problems that are already narrated but upon all the men on earth that i've created there's none that i love like you moses and that's what the lord is talking about to you now of all the creation beautiful women and men on earth rich and poor ugly and beautiful you are the one the lord has selected elected to be his wife to be his son to be his daughter to be his buddy buddy the closest person to to be scrawny that he want to communicate with best friend if the lord wants to speak something to the earth he comes to you and show you amen you don't want this position what do you want if the almighty the one who give breath to human being want to be your friend he said i don't want it i want the opposite i want the world i want sin i want death i want satan to rule me i don't know who you are no forsake the world and let the lord jesus christ because you can't even get enough of him amen there's something about the lord that the more he gives you the more you want even more because it's an uh eternity means it has no beginning has no end it's an unquenching reverse of water that you drink and drink and drink and you push out the attribute in you and you keep pushing out and you keep pushing out and you become like him amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so moses stood in a god voice for his people glory to the lord now let's drive it back home we're coming back home open your mouth wide and i will feel it right oh my lord help us just a couple maybe a few months ago the lord gave a prophecy here we've been praying about the gift that the lord has put in the church and we see gifts and many gift manifestations manifesting and i remember when i came here probably the last three years ago we used to before they covered we used to pray right at the back of the church the brothers we pray and we see the gift of the lord manifesting in brother quentin there was a time i remember right right at the back the holy ghost was so strong our brother was moving up and down it wasn't him he didn't know where he was the lord just said time the lord anoints you but there's another one he possesses you that your human mind and your human body is not yourself you do things that you won't even think of doing it as i wouldn't have prophesied that a a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son in his normal human reasoning he wouldn't have done that but someone possessed him and spoke through his lips so that the lord possessed our brother and was give that word of the lord he was speaking in the the other dimensional language that was not early language and we've seen that gift before i remember jack pray uh preached he said let's keep praying that the lord will give us the gift of interpretation because if the lord put a gift in there to speak in terms then the lord who put a gift there will give an interpretation glory hallelujah so i remember jack used to preach one day i was in my house and i was close to my kitchen and the voice said somebody from himself mother jack himself is going to interpret so my first thought was oh let me go take black jack and another said no just let the lord have his own way so i kept my silent i didn't say nothing to jack and i remember we were here in church having a normal service and the president of the lord came so strong and i remember that troy and i were praying for for he had a prayer line and the lord the holy ghost possessed our dear sister sister naomi johnson to speak the word of the lord in a language that is not any earthly language that we could understand and i remember i was standing somewhere here and i opened my eye and i saw the dimension circulating around my sister so strong beyond what you can think about it was an anointing but it was possession and the lord ought to said what he wanted to see and after that we kept praying for people me and jack were here and out of the blue sister rebecca gave the lord an utterance in english language clay as as clear as anything i mean as clay as as you can understand in a language that we know earthly language and i think i have it written here let me see if it's right if i had it right i want to quote it and then narrow certain things down prophecy um say have i not spoken this was to you if i'm wrong please correct me have i know spoken this was on to to you i'm doing a new thing and i want to underline have i know the first one is a question have i not spoken this way to you statement i'm doing a new thing i the lord who's i am i am that spoke with moses and moses asked him hey lord if i'm going to tell the people that you spoke to me they're going to ask me who your name is he said tell them i am that i am that is not that is sufficient for now i am i exist he said i am doing a new thing i am doing a new thing in my bride so he repeated the same thing again i'm doing a new thing then he said i'm doing a new thing in my bride just wait on me and i will do what you have asked me to do so you already asked the lord to do something for you and he said wait on him when he say wait on me let's break it down when is it wait on me we've all been to a restaurant before waiting that if you tell the waitress that okay i'm going to wait on you then the waitress will come and sit down i'm waiting on you are you going to be having that waitress no you want food f-o-o-d it's not just to come and wait and stay at you and your family you want food so that is a waitress so wait a minute save me save the lord with none the lord has me just sit down okay the lord said but i quit what i do you know the lord said i should wait on him i'm waiting i'm sleeping i'm with no that's not the waiting say the lord so waiting of the lord means serving with all your heart with all your mind with all your body with all your substance so waiting means serving the lord wait on me wait on me and i will do what you have asked me to do you don't have to worry for i am here oh man what an assurance i am here we know who i am is who is i am jehovah the lord jesus christ and he's in you he's here where is he in you in you so i am here be rest assured just like a child when children sometimes when it's dark they're afraid of darkness or when they see something that they're afraid but when they have a family daddy mommy uncle grandparents grandma i'm scared oh i'm here don't worry junior oh okay grandma is here oh that is here so that is an assurance i am here sometime when parents are going out and maybe their kids are younger they lock them don't go out because i'm not here don't open the enemy can come in a dog can come and bite you so stay in the room don't go outside because parents are not there but then when parents are here i am here amen amen it's okay don't be afraid amen know that i was not that i will be but i am here amen where you see in you amen i am here amen now we go father said i am he oh my father said have i not he brought the negative to bring the positive he so he started with a contrast the lord sometimes permits afflictions and trials to bring their blessing so when you see trials on your way when you see afflictions and limitation there's an abundance of world amen coming into your life there's a big frequency beyond what you can understand so when you see afflictions yes you're a human being you've got blood in you but you look beyond the pain yeah look beyond the breath pain looking beyond the affliction look beyond the trials and just narrow your eyes through the affliction that the lord is not punishing you no he doesn't punish people that he loves he blessing them he's building a contrast he's built an attribute so that when the blessings come you appreciate a blessing glory hallelujah it doesn't matter whether it's sickness whether it's job loss whether it's family there's a blessing for you and it's on the way it's here amen is coming out of you amen because the scripture said out of your belly shall flow reverse of living water glory hallelujah i am he so now he's making a reference i am here who speaks to you right now spanish would say ahora but ahora right right now not yesterday not tomorrow but right now oh glory hallelujah [Music] let me use an experience that i had in uk working in a pharmacy they have a program called a needle exchange program where people that drug pushers who use cocaine and whatever they inject themselves and they use the same needle to inject each other in doing so they transmit hiv so they have a program where drug pushers can come to the pharmacy and come and get new um new needles to do their stuff so we were working and normally the pharmacy i was working on my boots the cameras we opened at 8 o'clock but then we are not open to customers until 9 00 am right so eight o'clock we do our inventory and do stuff that we need to do internally so we were there during our staff and this lady came she said i want uh i want needles and it's oh go and come back nine o'clock she screamed and yelled i need my needles right now before she could finish we just gave her the needle because you don't want that on your head just take your nose right now and she call right now so she had it right now and our lord is a right now god he's not the god of yesterday amen he said um i i am here i am he who speak to you right now you just say what you need and i will give it to you what do you need from the lord say it's whatever you need and the lord will give it to you open your mouth wide and i will feel it those are the scriptures and the code that i read open your mouth wide and i will feel it that's what i promise that i will give you i'll give to you open your mouth wide open it wider and wider and wider and i'll give it unto you my bride relationship a family you are not a stranger you are not a beggar you've got the genetics of jesus christ in you you've got a blood which is the holy ghost in you you've got the dna you've got the genes whatever jesus christ is in you and so whatever you need open it your mouth and speak it let it come from your heart don't look at the condition no don't look at the circumstance but look at your desire and speak it to the lord and the lord has it already for you amen don't look at your children don't look at your wickedness don't look at your husband's weirdness don't look at your back sliding off your brothers and your sisters but speak and it shall be amen amen amen and sometimes i'd like to die sit said i said i think i am just that little prophecy i am was mentioned three times if i'm correct i am new thing two times twice said i'm doing a new thing and repeat it again i am doing a new thing in my bride so now he qualified it further he's doing new things in politics new things in the world in communication in the zodiac even in the celestial dimension but it doesn't pertain to me if it's not new things in my life but i'm doing a new thing in my bride in my wife in my body in my message in my in me because you are jesus christ himself amen you are we are the female designation designation of jesus christ we are him amen open your mouth a new thing i will five times it means there's more to come [Music] there's more to come amen there's more gifts in the church and as we step into the frequency the lord has the time it's in them it's in people but there's a time that the lord brings into manifestation and the lord opened the frequency and the gift of the holy ghost begin to manifest just like he gave us surprises right sister naomi and sister rebecca just look at the names of the two sisters that's right naomi and rebecca amen when the lord calls a person he calls his family and the lord transcribed and manifests himself in the family of the person that he calls amen look at the life of naomi in the bible she was a prophetess she led ruth onto onto boaz to christ look at rebecca rebecca was married to isaac the type of the son of god the love of christ so the lord used brother john's own daughter but a solomon's wife to bring an attribute a wife and a daughter there's no coincidence in the lord it's not by mistake that the lord used our two sisters to bring those manifestations you want to show that there's a relationship marriage going on another there's children being produced and those children are what spoken with sons and daughters of god amen the lord is doing a new thing it's not a man it's the lord and when the lord says something nothing can hinder him not even your own belief can hinder him he'll just go right ahead and do it amen glory hallelujah and so you accept what the lord is doing in you in the church in the world and you'll be rejoicing and dancing glory hallelujah to the lord amen [Applause] glory to the lord let me use william brown for example when he had an accident he knew already he already saw the vision he even told a friend he told one brother i think one of the friends is the one who heard that the lord the lord is going to take me home when you hear the lord has taken him out take your wife and go to go back to i think they are the denominational church because they won't survive in brahms tabernacle because after he the church became different story became fight and struggle and whatever so he said the lord told me that i'm going to leave and when you hear him left i'm going to glory take your wife and go to that church your wife will be far better over there so he was driving amarillo means yellow yellow means death and resurrection that's the same the symbol of the color yellow blue is heavenly dimension green is new beginning red is sacrificed redemption white is purity and all the colors have got meaning so the prophet was coming from amarillo texas the largest state in the u.s if i'm right and was driving and somewhere along the line i think about abraham his wife sister meda uh two three daughters no two daughters rebecca says sarah and joseph were in babram's car but i believe his wife sister lois were in his car i don't know i think if he has his son there i don't remember but then somewhere along the line brother joseph he was a little boy he said can i go to my brother's car i'm saying yeah go to your brother's car so when the accident happened but billy paul was behind we're behind by abraham so he didn't see you drove to find out that oh there's a wreck and he got to know it was his father so billy paul locked that car locked his wife and his son his brother because her little brother because he can't see it was too graphic for him to see so he looked you said be in the car i'll be back he went his testimony was so i've been with my father i've traveled with him to africa i share different countries when i saw my daddy i know he was gone he's dead and for whatever reason how it happened the lord knows but joseph was locked in the car little joseph but he came out of the car not opening the car how he came out and he saw his father wrecking the car he said daddy and when he mentioned daddy abram opened his eyes the amanda was dead he opened his eyes and said where's mommy put put my hands on mommy that is his wife and they managed to put his son and he said a simple prayer oh lord remember me and my family at this hour and he just went back into the other dimension and sister meda came back to life resurrected his daughter i think the lord gave them unconscious they didn't see much of it so when the lord calls you he cost your family brother billy was the old church and so he was typing like dead he saw my daddy was dead but joseph was a new beginning so when he came yes he did see his father dead he saw his father that he wanted to speak to and he called his father from the dimension and his father came back to life so when the lord calls you he calls your family because the people around you to play a part in the ministry and every one of us every one of you here has a part of the ministry of the lord jesus christ and what we need to do is to know our position in the lord how do you know your position in the lord yield to the lord just yield your heart your mind your body your spirit your
