[25:00] Brother Willie
[25:02] mcgaan from
[25:05] Alaska is coming to be with us on
[25:07] Wednesday night Amen Brother Willie
[25:09] McGaw so we'll be looking forward to
[25:11] having him uh on on Wednesday and uh
[25:15] don't forget our streaming continues
[25:16] through Twitter and Facebook and then
[25:19] also on our church website John 423 org
[25:23] um we there are two things kind of
[25:25] happening we we have the corporate fast
[25:26] still happening and as I mentioned to
[25:29] you all what corporate means is that
[25:31] everybody get involved uh it is very
[25:34] similar to what happened in the book of
[25:36] uh Esther when Esther was getting ready
[25:38] to go before the king uh she was so
[25:40] afraid because she knew her life was at
[25:42] stake and she uh told her uncle
[25:45] Mori she says please have everybody fast
[25:50] before I go and to see the king and said
[25:52] if I perish I perish but I'm going to go
[25:56] in to see the king Amen on on
[25:57] everybody's behalf so they all went into
[25:59] a corporate fast and that's what we do
[26:01] here we don't make it we don't try to be
[26:03] legalistic about it whatever the Lord
[26:05] leads you to do some are doing
[26:06] technology some are doing fast into a
[26:09] certain time of day some are changing
[26:10] their diets you know whatever the Lord
[26:12] leads you to do that's that's fine but
[26:14] we just ask that everybody be involved
[26:16] in this corporate fast we'll be running
[26:18] through March 9th which is next uh
[26:21] Saturday I believe amen our fast will
[26:23] come to a close then uh so keep that in
[26:26] mind and the other thing that's coming
[26:28] to a close at the end of the fast is
[26:30] that God gave us a
[26:33] mandate 40 days of not saying anything
[26:38] negative I hope y'all been keeping up
[26:40] with what God
[26:41] say if you ain't repent just repent but
[26:45] 40 days of not saying one thing negative
[26:48] praise the Lord cuz that's how Israel
[26:50] got in trouble they just kept
[26:52] complaining saying it delayed their
[26:54] promises we don't want our promises to
[26:56] be delayed by what we say out of our
[26:58] mouth you know what you speak out of
[26:59] your mouth can bring your promises to
[27:01] you or it can delay them from you so be
[27:04] careful what you say Amen but we're
[27:06] going to be going through to next amen
[27:09] next next week uh the the March 9th will
[27:11] be the end of our 40 days of not saying
[27:14] nothing negative now I hope on the 41st
[27:19] day I just hope y'all ain't been saving
[27:22] up all your' negative statements and
[27:24] just
[27:24] go you just canceled out everything
[27:27] don't try to keep control of your
[27:30] tongue praise the Lord so uh but that's
[27:33] that that'll be uh through the through
[27:35] through next week uh also don't forget
[27:37] our Sunday school is um uh happening
[27:40] 9:30 to 10:00 a.m. every Sunday um the
[27:44] youth ages 4 to 12 and then the young
[27:46] adults ages 13 to 20 and everyone is

[39:35] the Lord amen so um on
[39:39] today the Lord had just kind of placed a
[39:41] little something in my heart uh to do
[39:44] just a little differently and um we like
[39:48] I mentioned we had a actually I in the
[39:51] month of
[39:52] February um I didn't preach one sermon
[39:56] on Sunday because we had um visitors I
[40:00] want to say three Sundays and then I was
[40:02] away for one Sunday uh in South Carolina
[40:05] but nonetheless I have been
[40:07] enjoying uh the services that God has
[40:10] been given brother Simba make reference
[40:11] to it uh this morning that God has
[40:13] really been bringing ministers here to
[40:16] just feed our souls and and we have
[40:18] really really been enjoying oursel but
[40:21] um the the I want to say back in January
[40:24] I was just kind of praying over this and
[40:26] uh the Lord just put in my heart to do a
[40:28] Mishawaka service on the very first
[40:32] Sunday here in March and what some of
[40:35] y'all might say what is a
[40:37] Mishawaka service I'm going to explain
[40:40] it to you all right so when brother
[40:43] brandom uh first came amongst the
[40:46] Pentecostal
[40:48] people uh it I believe it was in mwaka
[40:51] Indiana is where uh he he met them and
[40:55] and he was he got there and he was like
[40:57] Wow never never seen anything like this
[41:00] and and uh when he was there you know uh
[41:04] he said he saw the the old preacher come
[41:07] out and he said um he was criticizing
[41:09] and like why would they let a old man
[41:12] come out there and preach like that all
[41:14] these preachers in here why they got
[41:15] this old man he say the old man uh got
[41:19] to talking about uh where were you and
[41:21] the sons of God shout it for joy and the
[41:23] morning Stars saying together and he
[41:24] said he was all over the horizontal the
[41:26] rainbow and bringing Christ all over the
[41:28] place and they said the man got so
[41:30] stirred up he jumped up and kicked his
[41:33] heels and said y'all ain't got enough
[41:35] room for me to preach up here and the
[41:37] brother Adam said whatever that man got
[41:40] if it make him act like
[41:42] that I need some of that and uh he
[41:46] talked about how you know he was um uh
[41:49] sleeping in his car you know didn't have
[41:51] room money for a hotel but sleeping in
[41:53] his car uh he talked about the sear
[41:55] sucker uh um pants or something like
[41:57] that and how he you know just just uh
[41:59] the way he was living and and he was he
[42:01] was um just at this meeting just
[42:03] enjoying himself amongst the
[42:05] Pentecostals and uh when he got um they
[42:08] they call all the ministers up say
[42:10] introduce
[42:11] yourself you know uh to the congregation
[42:14] all the ministers in the congregation so
[42:16] everybody come up and introduce and
[42:18] brother brandham one of the ministry say
[42:19] William Bram Jeffersonville Indiana and
[42:21] he go sit down and you know that was it
[42:23] well the next day and M walk
[42:27] they uh they said there was a minister
[42:29] that came to the platform last night by
[42:31] the name of William Brandon anybody know
[42:34] where he at cuz we want him to bring the
[42:36] sermon this morning brother Rand say oh
[42:38] my begin to sink down in his seat and um
[42:43] they say well anybody know where he at
[42:45] anybody know William brandom no he would
[42:48] brother Brandon wouldn't say nothing so
[42:49] this one fell looked at brother brand
[42:51] say do you know
[42:55] him yeah I know
[42:57] him well go get
[43:00] him well I can't go get him cuz I'm
[43:04] him he said you him they want you to go
[43:07] up there he said I can't go up there in
[43:09] the t-shirt and I can't go up there
[43:10] dress like this he said no they don't
[43:12] care nothing about that going up there
[43:14] go on up there and preach he's like no
[43:16] no no no no no no I'm not going up there
[43:18] so they say anybody know William R said
[43:20] yeah he is he is got told
[43:23] out so brother R and went up there to to
[43:26] minister and you know he said he took a
[43:29] a
[43:30] text um and uh then he cried he talking
[43:34] about the rich man you know and that
[43:36] that open his uh lifted up his eyes in
[43:40] hell he says and then he cried say there
[43:43] was no mama there and then he cried
[43:46] there was no Daddy there then he cried
[43:49] brother random said then I
[43:52] cried but during that um um service this
[43:57] is kind of where the idea of Mishawaka
[43:59] comes from and I I I was introduced to
[44:01] this when I went to London uh a few
[44:04] years ago at brother whisper church and
[44:06] they would have uh they would give a
[44:08] certain topic and then one Minister
[44:11] would come and read the scripture for
[44:13] the topic and uh he would you know take
[44:15] off and just everybody would kind of
[44:17] take State on that theme on that theme
[44:21] uh so the Lord just kind of you know uh
[44:23] they had about four ministers at that
[44:25] time to do it when I first was
[44:26] introduced to it and when brother
[44:28] whisper said it being from him being
[44:30] from Zimbabwe when he said Mishawaka I
[44:31] thought this was something from Zimbabwe
[44:34] but then then it struck me said oh you
[44:37] y'all done took something from the
[44:38] prophet and I said okay I got you
[44:40] brother brother GW I said okay I like
[44:42] this so today we're going to have
[44:44] actually five ministers to come now
[44:47] don't don't don't be alarmed don't be
[44:51] alarmed because they all
[44:54] limited as to how long they can speak
[44:57] they have a limit on their on their on
[44:59] their speaking and now what I didn't
[45:01] tell them and what they do in Zimbabwe
[45:03] is that if a minister goes over his time
[45:06] the next Minister just bumps him right
[45:08] on off and just keep on
[45:10] preaching but hopefully they all set
[45:12] their timers so that they don't they
[45:14] don't go on time but uh each one will
[45:17] just have a certain amount of time to
[45:19] present their thought and um um I won't
[45:23] tell you what the theme is you already
[45:24] know what our theme is for the year you
[45:27] already know the them so if you know the
[45:29] them for the year then you know what
[45:31] they're going to do a portion of what
[45:33] they're going to do today amen and uh
[45:36] some since some don't know I I'll just
[45:38] say uh the Lord has had us on the theme

[46:11] want to say this before I give the pull
[46:13] pit I'm so glad God has blessed our

[46:50] father of this meeting and father Lord
[46:52] let your word that you ordained before
[46:54] the foundation of the world for your
[46:55] people today manifest them Lord Jesus
[46:58] that Lord surely we shall be restored
[47:00] and we are restored father whatever Lord
[47:02] the enemy has stolen from us families
[47:04] individuals the church Lord father
[47:06] Ministry in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:08] Christ even as we hear restoration May
[47:11] each and everyone be restored in your
[47:13] name Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless
[47:16] you so we go right ahead and if I can
[47:18] have the slide we're going to read the
[47:21] scriptures we're going to use that is
[47:24] Joel chapter 1:4 and Joel
[47:28] 225 the first one is that which the
[47:31] Palmer worm had left had a locust eaten
[47:33] and that which Locust has left has the
[47:35] cankerworm eating and that which the
[47:38] cankerworm had left had the caterpillar
[47:40] eating amen but thank God for
[47:42] restoration so the second portion is the
[47:45] Lord restoring what this insect to from
[47:48] the church so Joel
[47:51] 2:25 I will restore to you this is
[47:54] personalized to you
[47:56] Hallelujah the years I go over again I
[47:59] restor to you so take it personally I
[48:01] take it
[48:03] personally the years that the Locust has
[48:05] eaten the canker worm and the ctip and
[48:08] the Palmer worm my great Army which I
[48:11] sent among you amen the Lord has sent a
[48:14] great Army to you amen GL praise be to
[48:18] the name of the Lord so let's go to the
[48:19] next slide my portion is to talk about
[48:21] Palmer worm now Palmer worm I wanted to
[48:24] find what is the mean of pal poem Pama
[48:27] is actually WR from French word pom
[48:30] which means a pilgrim an insect that
[48:33] migrate somebody that can change it form
[48:36] metamorphosis we can take our seat sorry
[48:39] metamorphosis so in the old French where
[48:41] they used to be real Christian Nation
[48:43] they used to go and pilgrimage to Israel
[48:45] and now when you go to Israel the Holy
[48:46] Land and you come back to France to show
[48:48] that you went to Israel you have to
[48:50] bring a palm leaf so that's why they had
[48:52] the word pomel to prove that you had
[48:54] traveled to the Homeland land and then
[48:56] the Hebrew word for Palama is gazm which
[49:00] means to cut off CU this animal will
[49:02] come if you take it the natural this
[49:03] insect will come to let's say cornfield
[49:06] and they take all the leaves they will
[49:07] chew eat everything that they can chew
[49:10] and as we talk about the natur taking
[49:12] the spiritual whatever the enemy has
[49:13] taken from you so that was it so it's
[49:16] said inser like a caterpillar which wers
[49:17] like a Palmer or a pilgrim which travels
[49:20] like a pilgrim in the bands Joel
[49:22] 24225 It's wingless Locust it migrates
[49:26] in the lover stage let's go to the next
[49:28] slide now before we go to something that
[49:31] was destroyed let's go to what what
[49:34] there should be a beginning there should
[49:35] be something Where's My Water there
[49:37] should be something here right to be
[49:39] removed from its place before it could
[49:40] be restored so let's go to what happened
[49:43] in the alha church the Lord you look at
[49:45] the church like a pyramid form the Lord
[49:47] set the basis he was the rock of the
[49:49] church the roots of the church but the
[49:51] root cannot be destroyed thank God for
[49:53] that the root is the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:55] himself eternity amen the tree the
[49:58] leaves and the flowers and things could
[49:59] be destroyed but the root beneath the
[50:01] Earth could not be destroyed same thing
[50:03] what eternity has declared in the mind
[50:05] of God about you your family the devil
[50:08] can never destroy amen so in the CH the
[50:11] Lord himself laid the foundation then
[50:13] the Lord put uh Paul to set the church
[50:16] as the basis so Church uh Paul was like
[50:18] the alpha age that was around 833 to
[50:22] 8055 and then other Messengers came
[50:24] around then
[50:26] said that the Roman demons came in to
[50:29] take away what God planted what the
[50:32] ministry planted that there's only one
[50:34] God oh Israel the Lord your God is one
[50:37] they chop it off and then they
[50:38] substitute Trinity God in three person
[50:41] which is a lie of the devil so now so
[50:44] this H animals Palmer worm Locus canker
[50:46] worm caterpillar they are from the pit
[50:48] of Hell they are from The Fifth
[50:50] Dimension it's just Satan the Old Devil
[50:53] death hell and grief same insect same
[50:55] Old Devil who translate or who
[50:57] metamorphosize himself from pal to
[51:00] Caterpillar to whatever the same devil
[51:02] who brings about false Doctrine
[51:04] destroying families bring destroying the
[51:06] church is the same old devil but thank
[51:09] God for the restoration amen let's go to
[51:11] the next slide glory to the Lord now
[51:13] here is where I got this uh message from
[51:16] he said listen close there were four
[51:18] four death Messengers kill that tree
[51:20] what was it pal Locust caterpillar and
[51:23] so on four messengers of Roman Devils d
[51:25] kill the tree one took it root back
[51:28] leaves and so on and so forth then said
[51:31] four Messengers killed the tree all by
[51:33] the
[51:34] roots and then if four messengers of
[51:37] Death kill the tree four messengers of
[51:38] Life restores the tree Glory Hallelujah
[51:42] Before Destruction there's Resurrection
[51:43] already for you amen so let's go to yeah
[51:47] so he said by four death Messengers kill
[51:48] the leave I will restore Martin Luther
[51:51] was one of the life Messengers He
[51:53] restored justification to the church
[51:55] amen Wesley was one of the life
[51:57] Messengers he restor sanctification
[51:59] Holiness to the church then Pentecost
[52:01] William S was one of the messengers He
[52:03] restored the gift to the church then
[52:05] William Braham was the fourth Messengers
[52:07] He restored the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:08] himself to the church amen let's go to
[52:11] the next slide Glory Hallelujah so these
[52:13] are the messengers Luther justification
[52:15] Wesley sanctification SE the gift and
[52:18] William Braham Christ and all the
[52:20] messengers came from the hand of
[52:22] Eternity God himself the six Dimension
[52:25] the Jesus Christ himself restoring
[52:27] everything that the devil has stolen
[52:28] from you Glory Hallelujah don't look at
[52:31] church don't look at building but look
[52:33] at you what has the the devil stolen
[52:36] from me what has he stolen from you the
[52:39] Lord is restoring to you this day amen
[52:41] Glory Hallelujah let's go I think that's
[52:43] the last slide let me make sure I want
[52:45] to okay thank God so I'm done so the
[52:48] everything that you need the Lord has
[52:50] given it to you Hallelujah you are

[53:40] knowledge and so on and so the Lord has
[53:42] resorted back to the church is part of
[53:45] what the Lord did for us amen sometime
[53:48] when you go to certain Mage Church they
[53:49] don't accept the gift they said the gift
[53:51] is for Pentecostal we are Pentecostal
[53:53] the day of Pentecost is when the church
[53:55] began so we are the original Pentecost
[53:57] amen so whenever there's a day of
[53:59] Pentecost the Lord restores what
[54:01] happened in the first Pentecost amen so

[54:15] that we have they do one good here they
[54:17] do many 10 evils in another places
[54:20] because it's what man made but what the
[54:22] Lord has made is perfect amen only we
[54:25] should rise up and by faith receive
[54:27] whatever the Lord has for us Glory
[54:29] Hallelujah to to the Lord if the enemy
[54:31] has taken your family from you taking
[54:34] your son your daughter your husband your
[54:36] wife and they running around the Lord
[54:38] has them restored for you it's already
[54:40] in your heart amen the root is in your
[54:43] heart which is the Holy Ghost baptism
[54:46] that is what you need amen restoration
[54:48] is not complete without the Holy Ghost
[54:50] baptism all right if I restore to
[54:52] justification is Holy is good if I
[54:54] restore to Holy living but the real
[54:56] restoration is the man Jesus Christ in
[54:58] your heart Hallelujah which is Christ in
[55:01] you the hope of glory GL and not just
[55:03] the hope of glory but the real
[55:05] expression of Glory in real time in your
[55:07] skin amen God want to be be in your skin
[55:10] Christ was eternity and Jesus was the
[55:13] flesh but the flesh of Jesus is not here
[55:15] but you are the morning Day Jesus you
[55:17] are the flesh that Christ want to dwell
[55:20] in and bring restoration God bless you
[55:22] and I'll make a way I'm just a PL man
[55:24] I'll let real preachers come and do
[55:25] their
[55:27] thing God bless you amen so I'll call
[55:30] the next preacher Amen brother Mark God
[55:34] bless you
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:41] glory that was a little click quick I
[55:43] thought a little more time to prepare
[55:46] right wow praise the Lord amen let's get
[55:49] started so the Locust so I look the word
[55:52] up what the Locust is is devour every
[55:53] green thing and when they migrate that
[55:55] fly an immense Cloud devour every green
[55:58] thing look in the spiritual sense the
[56:00] Locust like wants to come in your life
[56:01] and devour everything that it can amen
[56:03] and so our Locust is a a grasshopper
[56:05] it's it's like a short horn grasshopper
[56:07] in the same family so let's take it's
[56:09] Tak in Deuteronomy 28:15 and 42 but it
[56:12] shall come to pass if thou will not
[56:13] hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy
[56:15] God to observe to do all his
[56:17] Commandments and his statutes which I
[56:19] command thee this day that all the
[56:21] curses shall come upon thee and overtake
[56:23] thee and then verse 42 says all the
[56:24] trees and fruit of thy land shall the
[56:26] Locust consume so we see that God has
[56:28] given a certain commandment if you
[56:30] follow my word right and if you don't
[56:32] follow my word these things will happen
[56:33] to you so the same thing we see I will
[56:36] restore sayth the Lord all these things
[56:37] happen in the church ages because they
[56:39] went away from following the Lord's
[56:40] commandments so the same thing can still
[56:42] happen to us today if we don't follow
[56:45] the Lord's word so we don't want these
[56:46] things to devour our spiritual walk with
[56:48] Christ so we got to be sober and be
[56:51] vigilant so now and in John 10:10 it
[56:53] says the thief cometh not to but for to
[56:55] steal to kill and to destroy I am coming
[56:57] I have life I have it more abundantly so
[56:59] we see what the devil's tactics are is
[57:01] to steal kill and destroy if he can
[57:03] steal the word away from you then you
[57:05] will die spiritually so we got to be we
[57:08] got make sure we're looking this let's
[57:09] go to uh 1957 I will restore now the
[57:12] next great thing come up was the Locust
[57:14] we're going to see what the Locust job
[57:15] is and was one to destroy the unity of
[57:18] the Believers so his the the enemy's job
[57:21] is show the unity amongst the brothers
[57:23] and sisters of Christ takes the unity
[57:25] away from us how can God move in
[57:28] miraculous ways how can God uh give us
[57:30] the things that we desire in our church
[57:32] desire in our spiritual life because if
[57:35] I can't get along with you one another
[57:37] how I'm going to get along in heaven
[57:38] with everybody cuz in heaven is going to
[57:40] be perfect Unity not one ISM not one
[57:43] Schism so we got to take isms and
[57:45] schisms out the Church of God you may
[57:48] like chicken I may like pork but we
[57:49] still got to be able to love one another
[57:51] a a suit a suit coat and a overall
[57:53] should be able to hug one another
[57:55] amen let's keep it going these people
[57:57] with one heart one Accord so we see in
[57:59] the book of Acts they were one heart one
[58:01] Accord they have differences but they
[58:03] still with one heart one Accord right I
[58:05] believe in Romans chapter 8 it says the
[58:07] love of God nothing SE separate us from
[58:09] the love of God that's in Christ Jesus
[58:11] so nothing should separate us not one
[58:13] thing amen so we see the job of the
[58:15] Locust is destroy the unity so the enemy
[58:18] came in and begin to take slowly take
[58:19] the unity away from the Believers and
[58:22] and and the fellowship and all these
[58:23] other things we can talk about let's go
[58:25] and uh I will restore 1957 but the think
[58:27] that old Locust what it done and then
[58:29] another thing that it had back in the
[58:31] Bible times now besides Brotherhood
[58:33] perfect Brotherhood no notice that word
[58:35] perfect Brotherhood amen perfect Unity
[58:39] they had a worship of one true God and
[58:41] it's too bad that we got away from that
[58:43] I think we've gotten so busy in this day
[58:45] and age that we forget to connect with
[58:47] one another and I remember our brother
[58:48] brandom said back in the day man when a
[58:50] brother and sister when sisters would
[58:52] see each other and brothers see they
[58:53] would cry when they had to leave one
[58:55] another that's that perfect unity and if
[58:58] I can have Unity with you how must have
[59:00] Unity with
[59:01] Christ I treat my we got to treat each
[59:03] other the same way we treat Christ cuz
[59:06] if I treat you bad I'm treating Christ
[59:07] bad just simple as that amen amen now
[59:10] now listen close whatever happened in
[59:12] the first place with the insect of the
[59:13] perar wor and just became a caterpillar
[59:15] and the caliper became a locust and
[59:16] whatever it was started in the beginning
[59:18] is still the same thing that's causing
[59:20] the trouble today so think about that we
[59:22] have all these denominations because one
[59:25] person took an idea and and went with
[59:27] this idea another person took this idea
[59:28] and the call all is disunity I looked uh
[59:31] the statistics I think there over 30,000
[59:33] denominate Christian denominations in
[59:35] the world today and brother Bram said in
[59:36] the 60s was 900 so do the math on that
[59:39] how many more there is so we have all
[59:40] these isms and schisms amongst so-called
[59:42] Christian Believers but they all say we
[59:46] in the word of God but they took one
[59:47] thought and went away with it and it
[59:49] caused Unity amongst the the bride of
[59:51] Christ and God didn't intend for his
[59:53] family to be unify in fact his plan was
[59:56] to get everybody together under the same
[59:59] headship under the same God but they've
[1:00:01] taken uh what they thought is God and
[1:00:03] ran with it and and God is a million
[1:00:05] miles away from that amen no wonder why
[1:00:08] we can't have healing campaigns the
[1:00:10] churches are tore up no wonder one will
[1:00:12] say oh this and that other so disagree
[1:00:14] no wonder there's such isms Among Us is
[1:00:17] because we can't bear the real fruits of
[1:00:19] patience longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:00:21] gentleness the lifeline has been cut off
[1:00:24] from the tree and we're never to bring
[1:00:26] it up through Creeds of some rag or any
[1:00:28] other substitute it bark it'll take
[1:00:30] power of almighty God to grow that tree
[1:00:32] back to condition again and so we see in
[1:00:34] the message there's disunity we got one
[1:00:37] person believing this Doctrine one this
[1:00:39] Doctrine the prophet didn't come for us
[1:00:41] to be disunified he came to point us
[1:00:44] back to Christ and if we really follow
[1:00:46] what the message says we're going to be
[1:00:48] unified with Christ and we should all be
[1:00:50] together building one another because if
[1:00:53] my body goes this way and that way I'm
[1:00:54] not going to be able to go the way I
[1:00:56] need to go I got to walk straight just
[1:00:58] like this not left and right at the same
[1:01:00] time and the same thing with Christ I
[1:01:01] need my hand I need my toes I need my
[1:01:03] arms so we need one another to be a
[1:01:06] functioning body we want God do all
[1:01:08] these things in our life personally but
[1:01:09] are we making sure we're being unified
[1:01:11] with our brothers and sisters that's
[1:01:13] what God is looking for if we can just
[1:01:14] be like a building has to be perfectly
[1:01:17] built from the foundation up amen let's
[1:01:19] keep it going so then during the Dark
[1:01:21] Age they come forth with an organization
[1:01:23] they come forth a man-made policy the
[1:01:26] Locust begin to fly then the same devil
[1:01:28] that broke up Brotherhood is trying to
[1:01:30] break up the unity of man so the devil's
[1:01:33] trying to get into our church and he
[1:01:34] wants to use any and anybody he can to
[1:01:36] cause this unity and we got to make sure
[1:01:39] that we can recognize that know your
[1:01:41] enemy how he works because he used the
[1:01:44] same tactics he did in the Garden of
[1:01:46] Eden is using the same tactics today and
[1:01:48] you got to think about this that the
[1:01:49] enemy knows your weaknesses and your
[1:01:51] strengths so don't leave your guard down
[1:01:54] you got to make don't be make yourself
[1:01:55] vulnerable that he can come in and and
[1:01:57] and use something in your life and don't
[1:02:00] let anything get in the way of your walk
[1:02:02] with God don't let anything I don't care
[1:02:04] job I don't care your family I don't
[1:02:06] care what it is you safeguard that walk
[1:02:08] cuz if you safeguard that walk you can
[1:02:11] defeat any and anything the enemy throws
[1:02:13] at you because you're hid in Christ amen
[1:02:16] amen so let's go from go to 1962 the
[1:02:19] restoration of the Bride tree this
[1:02:21] little fellow died out and became a
[1:02:22] locust that was the next stage was a
[1:02:24] locust now what does a locust do a
[1:02:27] locust eats the leaves that's right a
[1:02:29] locust takes unto the leaves when with
[1:02:31] the Paw worm left he left the leaves he
[1:02:33] eat all the fruit of the tree then what
[1:02:36] he took in the Locust came to eat what
[1:02:38] the pal wor left now what did he do what
[1:02:40] did this pal word do destroy the leaves
[1:02:42] that's what the leaves for destroying
[1:02:44] Define fellowship so if he can destroy
[1:02:47] Divine Fellowship then we can't have the
[1:02:49] promises of God that we're Desiring
[1:02:51] because we got to have that perfect
[1:02:52] fellowship with God but God is looking
[1:02:55] how how can we uh interact with others
[1:02:57] if a brother and sister does something
[1:02:58] to you are you going to hold a grudge CU
[1:03:01] I know my I know my Bible says that he's
[1:03:03] not going to forgive your trespasses
[1:03:04] unless you forgive another person's
[1:03:05] trespasses so I think I think the key is
[1:03:08] we don't uh emphasize forgiveness cuz
[1:03:11] God won't even hear our prayer for not
[1:03:13] willing to forgive somebody it's like
[1:03:15] that Parable Jesus talking about that
[1:03:16] man that uh he owed a certain debt to
[1:03:19] his Lord and uh the Lord was going to
[1:03:21] throw him in jail but uh he begged and
[1:03:24] pleed with them for Grace see we're so
[1:03:26] easy to ask for Grace but we're not
[1:03:28] willing to give Grace to somebody else
[1:03:30] see we want it much as a possible we're
[1:03:32] not willing to dish it out so we got be
[1:03:34] willing to dish out Grace to somebody
[1:03:35] else we're all humans we have mistakes
[1:03:38] we do all these things we're not perfect
[1:03:40] I make mistakes but the thing is don't
[1:03:42] make the same mistake over and over and
[1:03:44] over again just like it's like we're
[1:03:46] repentance we we repent to God but we go
[1:03:48] back through the same thing again how we
[1:03:50] expect God to to honor or bless and to
[1:03:52] restore us so we got to make sure we're
[1:03:54] get back in step of true repentance we
[1:03:57] got to make sure we're in step of that
[1:03:59] amen but the Bible said that we're able
[1:04:01] or uh we we are to assemble ourselves
[1:04:04] together in Heavenly places look at that
[1:04:05] together oh my what all like well I tell
[1:04:08] you what this will do it'll make a pair
[1:04:10] of overalls in a tuxedo suit pair their
[1:04:12] arms around one another and call each
[1:04:14] other brothers sure it'll make an old
[1:04:17] Calico dress put her arms around a silk
[1:04:19] stained one and say sister how are you
[1:04:21] this morning praise God that's right
[1:04:23] it'll uh it will it's joy peace love
[1:04:26] Faith and the word of longsuffering
[1:04:28] gentleness patience set down in Heavenly
[1:04:30] places in Christ Jesus cool off a little
[1:04:33] see what those leaves would did so we
[1:04:36] got to get back to the basics get back
[1:04:38] to how the Church of how God started his
[1:04:40] church and we see how he started I'm not
[1:04:42] saying we got to sell everything and you
[1:04:44] know do that but the thing is get back
[1:04:46] to the spirit of unity and it's
[1:04:48] something you got to strive for it's not
[1:04:49] something that's going to just fall in
[1:04:50] your platter cuz brother Brandon said
[1:04:52] this statement he he uh talking about
[1:04:54] the church in Jeffersonville how he
[1:04:56] loved the unity and all these things and
[1:04:57] the gifts were just flowing together but
[1:05:00] he said be aware that the enemy does not
[1:05:03] want to see that he said you got to
[1:05:05] fight to keep the unity so it's each one
[1:05:08] of us it we all have a job and
[1:05:10] responsibility to do to keep the unity I
[1:05:13] don't care what this brother did to this
[1:05:14] sister did to you make peace with it
[1:05:17] because if you don't make peace with you
[1:05:18] going to you're going to hurt and hinder
[1:05:20] our church from getting blessings so and
[1:05:23] I believe the prop
[1:05:24] he preached Unity on a daily basis you
[1:05:28] got to keep the unity amen so this in
[1:05:31] closing be careful be sober be vigilant
[1:05:34] look out for the devil cuz he's going to
[1:05:36] throw everything he can because he knows
[1:05:39] his his work is short so he's going to
[1:05:41] do every and anything to get you off
[1:05:43] track so stay in the word of God stay in
[1:05:47] prayer stay in the message of the hour
[1:05:49] these three things will keep Unity not
[1:05:52] only in the church but in your family
[1:05:54] and in your life amen praise God
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:14] amen amen amen God bless you all we'll
[1:06:17] get right into it uh so the next
[1:06:20] evolution in this uh brother Brandon
[1:06:22] referred to as a life stealing beetle
[1:06:24] one Wicked spirit that came in four
[1:06:26] purposes and the next uh evolution is is
[1:06:29] uh the canker worm and so I looked up
[1:06:32] online the definition of a canker and it
[1:06:35] said a destruct destructive fungal
[1:06:36] disease of apple and other trees that
[1:06:38] results in damage to the bark and it's
[1:06:41] important to remember the word bark it
[1:06:43] also says an ulcerous condition or
[1:06:45] disease of a human or animal and the
[1:06:48] definition of ulcer is an open sore or
[1:06:51] an external or internal surface of the
[1:06:53] body caused by breaking the skin or
[1:06:55] mucous membrane that fails to heal so
[1:06:57] this thing is not healing back and
[1:07:00] healing is the children's bread so
[1:07:02] that's something that God has always
[1:07:03] focused back so when he sees something
[1:07:05] that's not healing back he he there
[1:07:07] there there's a question there right so
[1:07:10] and then they had another definition
[1:07:12] here and um it says a moral blemish this
[1:07:15] is an ulcer a moral blemish or
[1:07:17] corrupting influence and the example
[1:07:20] sentence that they G that they gave here
[1:07:21] this is from Oxford dictionary is he's a
[1:07:24] man with an incurable ulcer called
[1:07:26] gambling so we haven't read the Bible we
[1:07:29] haven't reached out to the prophet but
[1:07:31] man itself knows from a spiritual
[1:07:34] standpoint that uh uh you can be
[1:07:36] corrupted spiritually you can have
[1:07:38] spiritual issues uh uh not just focused
[1:07:41] because a lot of times when we think
[1:07:42] about uler we tend to just think
[1:07:43] physical things and a lot of people they
[1:07:45] talk about problems they talk about oh
[1:07:46] yeah you know sick in your body I'm
[1:07:48] feeling like I'm feeling this and this
[1:07:49] and that sometimes it's spiritual issues
[1:07:51] the prophet there was a woman that went
[1:07:53] to the prophet prophet and she had paid
[1:07:54] the psychiatrist to tell because she was
[1:07:57] going through some issues and she went
[1:07:59] down to the prophet and the prophet said
[1:08:01] hey is your life right she said yeah I'm
[1:08:03] a Sunday school teacher brother Brown
[1:08:05] said yeah okay and he kept looking and
[1:08:07] he says I see you in the car with a
[1:08:09] blond head boy and she said don't you
[1:08:11] tell nobody about that see she thought
[1:08:14] it was a physical problem but the
[1:08:16] prophet was able to look past that to
[1:08:18] see a blemish or a corruption he said
[1:08:21] you got to make that thing right or that
[1:08:23] devil will stay right
[1:08:25] there right amen so the prophet said
[1:08:29] that the cankerworm is the one that gets
[1:08:31] into the bark and destroys the covering
[1:08:34] the bark is the covering it's your
[1:08:36] covering right in the restoration of the
[1:08:38] uh of the uh brid tree uh paragraph
[1:08:42] 234 uh the prophet says but the third
[1:08:44] stage of him was a cankerworm h that's
[1:08:47] got a bad name to start with the
[1:08:49] cankerworm what does a cankerworm do it
[1:08:51] gets into the bark that's the lifeline
[1:08:53] there yes Sarah gets into the bark and
[1:08:55] it destroys the covering of the tree the
[1:08:56] covering what is religion covering
[1:08:59] that's what the word religion means a
[1:09:01] covering and I have to admit when in my
[1:09:03] early stages of a Christian I used to go
[1:09:05] with this saying that said um I don't
[1:09:07] believe in religion but relationship and
[1:09:10] I did I did I did some uh I did a search
[1:09:12] online and it says that uh there's a
[1:09:15] phrase that the Evangelical Protestants
[1:09:17] say which is a denomination that says
[1:09:19] Christianity isn't a religion it's a
[1:09:21] relationship and I remember that early
[1:09:23] on in my early on in my Christian walk
[1:09:25] there was this guy that had made a video
[1:09:27] on YouTube that says I hate religion but
[1:09:29] I love Jesus Christ but you always have
[1:09:31] to look behind the spirit of things
[1:09:33] right you can't just look at you can't
[1:09:34] just look at the physical side of it if
[1:09:36] the prophet would have just stayed
[1:09:37] looking at her physical condition he
[1:09:39] would have never got down to the issue
[1:09:40] so you have to look at the Spirit behind
[1:09:42] the behind that thing right so religion
[1:09:44] is not an evil thing right religion can
[1:09:47] nether be good or bad wow it can be used
[1:09:49] for good or bad and in fact you have to
[1:09:52] have a religion in order to have a
[1:09:53] relationship with Christ first right
[1:09:56] Israel Israel so people think
[1:09:58] denominations is started during the time
[1:10:00] of the pro no the children of Israel
[1:10:03] their covering was Moses right Moses was
[1:10:06] their covering Moses was the word of the
[1:10:07] day Moses was the representation of
[1:10:09] Christ for them which is a covering and
[1:10:11] they want there is one time they said we
[1:10:13] don't want to hear from you Moses we
[1:10:14] want to hear from God directly see they
[1:10:17] thought God was going to come and talk
[1:10:18] to them as a buddy buddy so now notice
[1:10:21] that request wasn't bad because God
[1:10:23] wants
[1:10:24] to restore us cuz there's no there's no
[1:10:26] going to be any more preaching and stuff
[1:10:27] in heaven right uh when Jesus uh
[1:10:29] descended down to Hell and he preached
[1:10:31] to the lost souls that doesn't happen to
[1:10:33] Believers in heaven there'll be no more
[1:10:34] preaching in heaven right but the
[1:10:36] israels Israel was looking for a
[1:10:38] restoration out of season right right
[1:10:41] they were still living in sin the blood
[1:10:43] had not been shed in order for them to
[1:10:45] be able to approach God so when the
[1:10:47] voice came out of Heaven he said okay
[1:10:48] y'all want me to talk to you the voice
[1:10:50] came out of Heaven they thought that
[1:10:51] they were getting a buddy but God was
[1:10:53] calling out sin right they lost their
[1:10:56] covering God was calling out sin and
[1:10:57] they said okay no no no let Moses talk
[1:11:00] to us so there's a way that you have to
[1:11:02] have in order to approach God and have a
[1:11:04] have a relationship with God right so
[1:11:06] the prophet referred to religion as
[1:11:09] Doctrine right Doctrine is the law it's
[1:11:12] the word so you can't have a
[1:11:13] relationship with God without Doctrine
[1:11:16] amen and we're going to prove this
[1:11:17] scripturally as we turn to Genesis
[1:11:21] 39-11 we're going to prove you can't
[1:11:24] have a relationship with God without
[1:11:25] Doctrine without
[1:11:27] law and it says here and the Lord God
[1:11:29] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[1:11:31] art thou and he said I heard thy voice
[1:11:34] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[1:11:36] was naked and I hid myself and he said
[1:11:39] who told thee that thou was naked hast
[1:11:42] thou eaten of the tree whereof I
[1:11:44] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:11:46] eat so we see right here that Adam was
[1:11:49] in a state before that he had a covering
[1:11:52] that he didn't realize he was
[1:11:54] right he didn't understand what sin was
[1:11:57] but when they had made a choice now this
[1:11:59] covering is off and now God is coming to
[1:12:02] them and telling them who told you you
[1:12:03] were naked right I hid you from that
[1:12:06] there was a covering and I want you to
[1:12:07] know cuz a lot of times people people
[1:12:09] would say oh uh you know um I I don't
[1:12:12] tell lies because I don't want to go to
[1:12:14] hell or they say uh you know being a
[1:12:16] Christian is hard you have to understand
[1:12:18] the covering that God gave them which
[1:12:20] was the doctrine he made them that way
[1:12:23] so living the word is natural you're not
[1:12:26] just trying to follow it just to get to
[1:12:28] a a specific situation no the word is
[1:12:31] who you are right that's where you find
[1:12:33] peace that's where you find Joy that's
[1:12:35] where you find Love by living the word
[1:12:37] you're not following the rule book God
[1:12:39] made Adam with that covering amen right
[1:12:42] Adam was Adam wasn't trying to put that
[1:12:44] covering on himself God made him with
[1:12:46] that covering right yeah right so so
[1:12:49] even in the even in the garden Adam Eve
[1:12:50] they both had a covering and what this
[1:12:53] cover did was it produced a Godly
[1:12:56] innocence right It produced a Godly
[1:12:58] innocence and um I want to say I I'll
[1:13:01] say a testimony right now because um at
[1:13:04] my job see I don't tell people that I'm
[1:13:06] a Christian right and it's okay to do it
[1:13:08] if you tell people you're a Christian
[1:13:09] that's fine as long as you have a life
[1:13:11] behind it the prophet said that you can
[1:13:13] shout and you can jump that's all that's
[1:13:15] all fine and well but if you ain't got
[1:13:17] no life behind it it doesn't mean
[1:13:18] anything so if you come to church if you
[1:13:20] shout if you don't shout it's fine as
[1:13:22] long as you're going out and there's a
[1:13:24] life behind it that people can identify
[1:13:26] with right so I never said that I was a
[1:13:28] Christian and this one of my co-workers
[1:13:30] she asked me well do you drink and I
[1:13:32] know it always comes down to The
[1:13:33] Showdown to show who you are so I know
[1:13:36] those questions come up and she said
[1:13:38] well do you drink I said no I don't
[1:13:39] drink I'm a Christian and she said oh
[1:13:42] wow really and so she said I was
[1:13:44] wondering because when they curse and
[1:13:46] stuff I don't curse with them right she
[1:13:48] was she said oh wow I she said no wonder
[1:13:51] no wonder the uh um because because of
[1:13:53] the way I was acting she was like no
[1:13:54] wonder because of the way that I was
[1:13:56] acting was it was a it was producing a
[1:13:58] Godly innocence by submitting to the
[1:14:00] word now if you would looked at Quinton
[1:14:01] Jr 10 years ago in college I was cursing
[1:14:05] up a storm right right I was cursing up
[1:14:08] a storm but when the man Jesus Christ
[1:14:10] came on the scene and put a covering on
[1:14:14] you know what she said she said oh wow
[1:14:16] that's sweet it produces an innocence
[1:14:19] not your innocence but a Godly innocence
[1:14:23] right produces a Godly
[1:14:26] innocence amen right so this cover this
[1:14:30] covering which is a h is a is a Doctrine
[1:14:33] now now what the cankerworm is trying to
[1:14:35] do he's now trying to replace this he
[1:14:37] comes to destroy the bark uh and and the
[1:14:41] prophet says he replaces it with dogmas
[1:14:43] or Creeds just like Adam he came and
[1:14:45] destroyed the covering that was on Adam
[1:14:47] and in Adam all of a sudden now he's
[1:14:49] putting on fig leaves now I want you to
[1:14:51] realize that those fig leaves were
[1:14:53] natural process the covering that God
[1:14:56] put Adam on he was a spoken word they
[1:14:58] weren't born by sex it was a spoken word
[1:15:01] it was a spiritual covering and now Adam
[1:15:03] is trying to put on a natural covering
[1:15:05] no wonder God had to reject it right no
[1:15:08] wonder God had to reject it right and um
[1:15:11] one of the Creeds uh if you read in the
[1:15:13] message the restoration of the Bride
[1:15:15] tree one of the Creeds that um that he
[1:15:18] talked about that the um that the enemy
[1:15:20] trying to replace was baptism in the
[1:15:22] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[1:15:24] Ghost right now that's a problem that a
[1:15:27] lot of message Believers especially if
[1:15:28] you're born in the message you may not
[1:15:30] have it because uh you weren't born in
[1:15:32] that denominational time to be
[1:15:34] transitioned but it's important to
[1:15:36] understand the significance of why we do
[1:15:38] this thing right just so if you meet
[1:15:41] someone on your Trail if someone is in
[1:15:42] denomination you can explain it to them
[1:15:44] but so that you also have an
[1:15:46] understanding of the word for yourself
[1:15:48] right so now the problem with this Creed
[1:15:51] right this covering because uh baptism
[1:15:53] in the name of Jesus Christ is a
[1:15:54] covering right it's doctrin and it's a
[1:15:56] covering for us now the problem with
[1:15:58] this Creed is that it takes away the
[1:16:00] name right it takes away the name
[1:16:04] because power lies in the name right not
[1:16:07] in titles right so you see how dangerous
[1:16:11] this can this cankerworm can be if he
[1:16:14] can take away the name of Jesus from a
[1:16:16] Believer you have no power I don't care
[1:16:19] how you're living I don't care how much
[1:16:20] you're going to church you have no power
[1:16:23] G power has always been in the name
[1:16:26] first right so praise God right so when
[1:16:30] Eve was tempted uh what did she do first
[1:16:33] we're going to turn to Genesis
[1:16:35] 323 when Eve was tempted right it says
[1:16:39] uh we'll just read I'll just read from
[1:16:40] ver one it says now the serpent was more
[1:16:42] subtle than any beast in the field which
[1:16:44] the Lord had made he said unto the woman
[1:16:47] yay God ha God said ye shall not eat of
[1:16:49] any tree now notice what she said and
[1:16:51] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[1:16:53] eat of the tree we may eat of the fruit
[1:16:55] of the Trees of the garden but of the
[1:16:57] tree of the fruit which is in the midst
[1:16:59] of the garden God hath said ye shall not
[1:17:01] eat of neither shall you touch it least
[1:17:03] you die now that should have setted it
[1:17:06] right there because that was the word of
[1:17:08] God and the prophet said when you speak
[1:17:10] the word of God to the enemy that is
[1:17:12] finished he's defeat the word will
[1:17:14] defeat the enemy under any condition any
[1:17:17] circumstance I don't care what it looks
[1:17:19] like the word will defeat the enemy
[1:17:21] right but it didn't do it in this case
[1:17:25] right it didn't do it in this case right
[1:17:26] so we have to realize uh then another
[1:17:29] important thing to realize here is she
[1:17:31] didn't have a name here it just said
[1:17:33] woman right because she was taken from
[1:17:35] Adam her identity was in Adam right
[1:17:38] right so she didn't have a name her name
[1:17:40] was with Adam right and that's where a
[1:17:42] lot of her power was because she was
[1:17:45] approaching she was approaching the
[1:17:46] serpent without her husband without a
[1:17:49] name right Satan's not going to fear
[1:17:52] nothing like that even though it be word
[1:17:54] right even though it be
[1:17:57] word right so
[1:18:01] um right so we're going to look at the
[1:18:03] uh uh if we look over at the New
[1:18:05] Testament there was a uh there was a
[1:18:07] scripture in the New Testament where
[1:18:09] they these guys saw Paul casting out
[1:18:11] these demons and then they tried to go
[1:18:14] and then cast out demons and the demons
[1:18:17] testified themselves they said Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ we know head first name first
[1:18:23] Paul we know right now you have to
[1:18:25] realize you say well that's Paul's name
[1:18:26] no Paul was Saul God changed his name to
[1:18:30] Paul brother Jesus we know Paul we know
[1:18:34] but who are you who are you it was a
[1:18:35] body without a head trying to operate
[1:18:38] Satan's not afraid of
[1:18:40] that Satan's not afraid of that right
[1:18:44] Satan is not afraid of that you have to
[1:18:46] have a name so that's why when we
[1:18:48] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ it's power behind
[1:18:53] in the name of Jesus Christ we we
[1:18:55] approach everything in the name of Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ and when and when we have the
[1:19:01] word of God when we have the of Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ first then the demons tremble
[1:19:06] otherwise they will not and the word
[1:19:08] literally the Lord the word shows you
[1:19:10] that the demons weren't afraid of the
[1:19:13] word without a head right they weren't
[1:19:15] afraid of the word without a head
[1:19:17] because you have to understand that
[1:19:18] people that believe in the father Son
[1:19:20] and the Holy Ghost it's in the word come
[1:19:23] on it's not something that's outside of
[1:19:25] the word right a lot of other doctrines
[1:19:27] like the Apostles Creed you won't find
[1:19:29] that in the word um people's you know
[1:19:32] another another of the dogmas that they
[1:19:33] tried to replace was uh um uh joining
[1:19:36] the church by a handshake you don't find
[1:19:38] none of that in the word but you'll find
[1:19:40] Father Son and the Holy Ghost in the
[1:19:41] word but you need a head in order to
[1:19:44] reveal to you what that means and where
[1:19:46] the power is first and now you have
[1:19:49] something right yeah so the canker
[1:19:51] worm's purpose was to take away the
[1:19:53] covering and replace it with dogmas and
[1:19:55] we're going to turn to uh Genesis
[1:20:02] 35-7 and do do do a little bit do do
[1:20:05] some more reading just to show
[1:20:07] you uh this covering and it says for God
[1:20:12] doth know that the day you eat thereof
[1:20:14] that then your eyes shall be open and ye
[1:20:17] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:20:19] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:20:21] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:20:22] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:20:25] make one wise she took of the tree took
[1:20:27] of the fruit and thereof and uh gave to
[1:20:29] her husband with her and he did and he
[1:20:31] did eat and the eyes of them were uh
[1:20:34] eyes of them both were opened right and
[1:20:36] they knew that they were naked and they
[1:20:38] sold fig leaves together and made
[1:20:40] themselves aprons so God had a covering
[1:20:43] not just on the eyes he had a covering
[1:20:45] on the ears a spiritual covering on the
[1:20:47] eyes and the ears right uh uh um in
[1:20:50] order for them to withstand the test and
[1:20:53] as soon as they fail they tried to fix
[1:20:55] the situation themselves and that's the
[1:20:58] nature of man when man falls and makes
[1:21:00] makes a mistake they try to do things
[1:21:02] themselves so you know sometimes if you
[1:21:04] if you are um if you were um if you did
[1:21:07] somebody wrong right or you may have you
[1:21:09] may have said something wrong to
[1:21:11] somebody and then it's like okay well
[1:21:12] I'll just go buy him ice cream just to
[1:21:14] kind of make things better no that's a
[1:21:17] covering right you need to go back and
[1:21:19] tell them hey I'm sorry for doing this
[1:21:21] thing and then give them the ice cream
[1:21:24] right you can't patch it up and that's
[1:21:27] the that's the problem with human beings
[1:21:30] is when we try to fix the situation we
[1:21:33] try to patch it up to make ourselves
[1:21:35] look good and then it just comes off as
[1:21:37] a self-righteousness because the prophet
[1:21:39] when the prophet saw that that uh uh
[1:21:41] that vision of her he said he he said it
[1:21:43] was way down in her subconscious she had
[1:21:47] hit it way down in her subconscious to
[1:21:49] the point where she didn't know that was
[1:21:51] the issue so man tries to patch things
[1:21:53] up God comes down and says no no no no
[1:21:56] no this is the problem and I want you to
[1:21:58] know that we're speaking about
[1:22:00] restoration because the lamb that God
[1:22:03] slayed for Adam and Eve it was a
[1:22:06] temporary lamb right the Bible says the
[1:22:09] uh the blood of bull and goats won't
[1:22:11] satisfy but it was a temporary covering
[1:22:13] so this restoration that we're looking
[1:22:14] for God's looking to restore us back
[1:22:17] spiritually those spiritual eyes that
[1:22:19] Adam and Eve had that they didn't know
[1:22:21] that they were naked God is God is uh is
[1:22:24] recovering that's why when the Bible
[1:22:26] says when a man sees a a naked woman on
[1:22:28] the street he'll turn his head amen
[1:22:30] because there's an innocence there they
[1:22:32] don't know about that stuff and that's
[1:22:34] why the world when so when you saying
[1:22:36] that you're a Christian right and
[1:22:39] partake upon the things of the world
[1:22:40] you're looking at naked women or all
[1:22:42] those kinds of things it shows there's
[1:22:44] something wrong but they want they want
[1:22:47] the relationship without religion just
[1:22:49] like the children of Israel did but
[1:22:51] God's looking to to restore back our
[1:22:53] covering right God's looking to store
[1:22:56] back our covering um uh brother um in
[1:22:59] the the first fruit that was lost was
[1:23:01] the uh the uh the fruits of Joy love
[1:23:03] peace and then we talk about fellowship
[1:23:04] and now the doctrine has been lost and
[1:23:06] repaced God wants us to give back our
[1:23:08] innocence because when we have innocence
[1:23:11] it that innocence is actually what makes
[1:23:13] God do things right so I remember one
[1:23:16] time uh I was just upset at work but
[1:23:19] then I saw some kid come inside there
[1:23:20] and I saw them smiling in your Dem meor
[1:23:22] just changes innocence does something to
[1:23:26] you no matter how you're feeling and so
[1:23:28] when you're looking for God for
[1:23:29] innocence when you're looking for
[1:23:30] healing when you have the covering of
[1:23:32] Innocence on on you and you say Lord I'm
[1:23:35] sick I don't know what to do Lord help
[1:23:37] me that innocence will cause God to come
[1:23:39] down on the scene right praise God Amen
[1:23:44] so we'll take the next
[1:23:51] person
[1:23:58] GL to God God bless you
[1:24:01] all what the cankerworm
[1:24:04] eaten that which is the Lord will
[1:24:06] restore what the canor left the
[1:24:08] caterpillar came and ate and uh Church
[1:24:12] the caterpillar very interestingly see
[1:24:15] after the same insect the prophet says
[1:24:18] it's the same bug but different forms
[1:24:21] and you see it's started off with the
[1:24:23] leaf with the fellowship and it started
[1:24:25] off with the with the doctrine taking
[1:24:27] that away and then it started off by
[1:24:29] going to the very bark of the tree and
[1:24:31] then it goes to take the very uh the the
[1:24:34] the very covering of what that tree
[1:24:36] stands for but this caterpillar comes
[1:24:39] now and and and all that is left after
[1:24:41] all that's been eaten is just a stump
[1:24:44] and that's all that's left it goes and
[1:24:46] takes the very life out of the tree and
[1:24:49] nothing else is left just the stump you
[1:24:51] see but but there was something in that
[1:24:53] stump that God put before the foundation
[1:24:56] of the Earth can I say Amen somebody
[1:24:59] before the foundation God placed
[1:25:01] something in there you see if that
[1:25:03] insect continue eating it would have to
[1:25:05] be converted cuz there was a seed on the
[1:25:07] inside and that seed had a life and that
[1:25:11] life had a promise and that promise had
[1:25:13] to come to pass I will restore is that
[1:25:16] right and what was the original resur
[1:25:19] restoration see in the in the in the
[1:25:21] garden of Eve when God created man God
[1:25:24] said let us make man in our own image is
[1:25:27] that right and when he made man God had
[1:25:30] a desire to reproduce himself he put man
[1:25:33] and he says I will put man and there's
[1:25:36] something he says interestingly here in
[1:25:37] Genesis one Genesis uh 2:7 actually it
[1:25:42] says and the Lord formed God then the
[1:25:44] Lord God formed man of the Dust of the
[1:25:46] ground and breathe into his nostril the
[1:25:48] breath of life and he made this man to
[1:25:51] become a living so and he planted a
[1:25:54] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[1:25:57] the man who he had formed and the Lord
[1:25:59] God took the man and he put him in the
[1:26:00] garden he says to dress it and to keep
[1:26:03] it you see the man was in a position of
[1:26:06] Dominion in Genesis 1 127 he says that
[1:26:10] he created man in his own image and he
[1:26:13] says let them have dominion over all the
[1:26:15] fish of the sea over the foul of the air
[1:26:17] over the cattle over all the Earth over
[1:26:19] all creeping things upon the Earth
[1:26:22] God had a desire for man to rule for man
[1:26:26] to recognize his position of authority
[1:26:29] his position in dominion and the prophet
[1:26:32] says there was threefold purpose of God
[1:26:34] res restoring it was God it was Christ
[1:26:37] being manifested in flesh it was God so
[1:26:40] that he could have the preeminence in
[1:26:42] the church and it was to restore back to
[1:26:44] Ed in condition before before Eve ate
[1:26:49] that fruit there was a perfect
[1:26:51] Fellowship in Eden there was a Dominion
[1:26:54] there in Eden and you see as this
[1:26:56] caterpillar continues to eat and eat and
[1:26:59] eat there was a position that was lost
[1:27:02] the identity of that tree begin to
[1:27:04] become compromised you see so there you
[1:27:08] have a tree that has no power a tree
[1:27:10] that has no Dominion No Authority now
[1:27:14] the prophet goes on to say here in the
[1:27:15] message of restoration of the brid tree
[1:27:18] he says the fourth stage now as a
[1:27:21] caterpillar he sucks the life that's
[1:27:24] what he does it goes right down to the
[1:27:26] pope and goes to sucking caterpillar
[1:27:29] here he is who we going to call him
[1:27:31] denomination that's the guy's right name
[1:27:34] and you see when you denominate the
[1:27:36] Bible uh the prophet says that you
[1:27:38] destroy the works of God right there
[1:27:41] when you start to denominate you form
[1:27:43] yourself a a form of creed or dogmas
[1:27:46] that's when Christ has to exit because
[1:27:49] there is no place for him to have his
[1:27:51] habitation you see but I can think of it
[1:27:53] like job right when God had a challenge
[1:27:56] to the devil and told hey you can go
[1:27:59] ahead and touch job and he can go ahead
[1:28:02] and take everything he has take all of
[1:28:04] his substances all of his possessions
[1:28:06] but don't you just touch his life you
[1:28:08] see with that caterpillar that life that
[1:28:10] he was eating there was somewhere that
[1:28:13] life came from brother brenon preach the
[1:28:15] message what is life the life some
[1:28:18] people might regard life as as as a good
[1:28:20] time some people regard life as as as as
[1:28:24] pleasure or or or regard life as how
[1:28:26] much you have at the bank you see but
[1:28:29] job had a revelation the life that he
[1:28:31] had was that he knew who he was he knew
[1:28:35] what God made him to be as a Son of God
[1:28:37] you see so when his wife came and said
[1:28:40] why don't you curse God you see job says
[1:28:44] um shall we so shall we only enjoy good
[1:28:46] things you see job had a revelation of
[1:28:49] what life was and he got to a place he
[1:28:51] said says I know my redeemer lives you
[1:28:55] see when he can say I know that was a
[1:28:58] representation of that seed that was in
[1:29:00] him that could speak that life is that
[1:29:03] right praise
[1:29:07] God
[1:29:09] now I want to read this quote here the
[1:29:11] prophet
[1:29:13] says he says God's going to raise up
[1:29:16] people who believes in signs and wonders
[1:29:19] going to raise up people who's got joy
[1:29:21] unspeakable and full of glory and when
[1:29:23] the rushing Mighty Wind comes it gives
[1:29:26] right into it and frolics and dances and
[1:29:28] glorifies God hallelujah green leaves
[1:29:31] are clapping hands and having a
[1:29:33] wonderful time what a Frolic that little
[1:29:36] undergrowth was having but that big old
[1:29:39] tree standing there just moaning and
[1:29:41] groaning same wind look that same wind
[1:29:44] was making one moan and groan was giving
[1:29:47] the other one a big time and I happen to
[1:29:49] think well what's the one what's this
[1:29:51] one doing and every time that little
[1:29:53] tree would twist and what would it do it
[1:29:55] would pull the roots loosen up the
[1:29:57] grounds that's right so it could grow
[1:30:00] deeper and get a deeper hold Hallelujah
[1:30:03] and every time God sends his blessings
[1:30:05] upon a born again man or woman it only
[1:30:08] loosens up the roots to grow deeper
[1:30:10] higher better Freer glorify God but I
[1:30:14] will restore and I want to say this when
[1:30:16] God restores church he restores what
[1:30:19] better is that right when he rest
[1:30:22] he restores with better you see I
[1:30:25] remember when Joel when he lost
[1:30:26] everything he had he had more on his
[1:30:28] latter end than he did when he started
[1:30:31] is that right Joseph was in a prison
[1:30:34] where he was where he God placed him
[1:30:37] there for a specific specific purpose
[1:30:40] but when it came time for his
[1:30:41] restoration there was a pharaoh that
[1:30:44] placed him in a position of dominion
[1:30:47] right it placed him in a position so
[1:30:49] that he was above all the palace
[1:30:53] there was three Hebrew boys that was in
[1:30:54] the fire but when they got out the fire
[1:30:57] there was a a promise waiting for them
[1:31:00] or rather a promotion waiting for them
[1:31:02] when they were restored there was a
[1:31:04] declaration by the king that they would
[1:31:07] be respected among all nations that who
[1:31:10] don't ever serve their gods will be cut
[1:31:12] into pieces is that right when God
[1:31:15] restores church he restores with better
[1:31:18] so in this season of restoration I say
[1:31:21] expect God to give you better expect God
[1:31:24] to give you more expect God to give you
[1:31:26] double because God doesn't take away God
[1:31:29] doesn't subtract God multiplies God adds
[1:31:33] and God desires for you to be in a
[1:31:34] position of dominion this morning praise
[1:31:37] the
[1:31:39] Lord and the restoration of the brid
[1:31:41] tree the prophet says all the bugs that
[1:31:44] hell can turn loose on her will never
[1:31:47] stop no communism Catholic Catholicism
[1:31:51] nothing else will will ever stop it I
[1:31:53] will restore said the Lord all the
[1:31:55] man-made Roman trees will never hang
[1:31:58] there all the graves will never keep it
[1:32:00] there all the big denominational Stones
[1:32:02] laying at the door will never keep it
[1:32:04] there I will restore sayith the Lord
[1:32:07] there will be in Easter I'll bring forth
[1:32:10] that same church and its same power I'll
[1:32:13] bring that brid tree just like she was
[1:32:15] back there when the same signs the same
[1:32:17] fruit the same thing that they did I'll

[1:32:34] when it starts when it gets to this
[1:32:35] point where it can't eat no longer
[1:32:38] that's when God activates that
[1:32:39] predestinated seed God remembers his
[1:32:42] promise and I say this morning God
[1:32:44] remembers his promise to you because all
[1:32:46] the years that the the cankerworm ate
[1:32:48] the Locust the the the Palmer worm the
[1:32:51] the caterp pillar all the years God will

[1:47:49] amen I want you to understand that it
[1:47:52] says here that the in in Luke remember
[1:47:55] what he said they began to understand

[1:48:09] supernaturally amen he came through the

[1:48:39] amen the life amen into the body again
[1:48:44] hey M I'll give you a little story here
[1:48:48] there was a a woman
[1:48:51] amen she wanted a a a dining room set
[1:48:54] she asked her husband let's go out and
[1:48:57] buy this dining room set because I want
[1:49:00] to be able to entertain and have people
[1:49:03] over for dinner amen and so uh uh they
[1:49:07] went out to this store very fine fine
[1:49:11] store amen and she walked and walked and
[1:49:15] and picked up the furniture picked out
[1:49:17] the best one she could find amen but the
[1:49:20] thing of this is each chair amen was a
[1:49:23] little bit different each chair had its
[1:49:25] own characteristic amen but it was but
[1:49:29] it was made all together different all
[1:49:32] of the carvings on the one was different
[1:49:35] all of the carvings on that one was
[1:49:37] different from the other amen and they
[1:49:39] brought it home amen and they had a real
[1:49:42] good time on that table amen they sat at
[1:49:45] that table amen and they ate the meal oh
[1:49:48] man that was prepared for them amen they
[1:49:51] ate plenty and was satisfied amen the
[1:49:54] children sat at that table and maybe did
[1:49:57] their homework amen maybe there was many
[1:50:00] discussions going across that table amen
[1:50:03] that table served them well but after a
[1:50:06] while what happened amen they begin to
[1:50:09] get tired of that old table amen so they
[1:50:12] took that table and went out and they
[1:50:14] bought another table maybe a little
[1:50:17] glass and Brass amen and they said was
[1:50:20] real pretty amen this look good because
[1:50:23] it glows and it Glitters amen so they
[1:50:27] took that old table in them chairs and
[1:50:29] they moved them to another section maybe
[1:50:32] set it out in the garage amen and then
[1:50:35] they ran out of room in the garage and
[1:50:37] maybe they took the one chair and sat it
[1:50:39] outside man Sat one on the porch amen it
[1:50:43] and over the years amen through the wear
[1:50:46] and tail the screws begin to get a
[1:50:48] little bit loose amen man the the chair
[1:50:51] the cushions get worn in amen a little
[1:50:54] discoloration happened to the chair amen
[1:50:57] so when trying to prepare this chair
[1:51:00] amen they come back and they do it with
[1:51:02] denominational decrees say well I take a
[1:51:05] little paint and I paint over the
[1:51:07] blemishes I paint over the scratches
[1:51:10] right I'll paint over this flaw all
[1:51:12] right and try to bring this chair back
[1:51:14] all right amen but that wouldn't do it
[1:51:17] amen they put it out and the chair was
[1:51:20] exposed Amen to the elements of the
[1:51:22] world Amen and it begin to wither and it
[1:51:26] begin to get destroyed all right amen
[1:51:28] but one day what happened amen Jesus

[1:51:42] in order to restore the chairs amen each
[1:51:45] chair individually Amen to be put
[1:51:48] positionally in their place the first

[1:56:41] Shak and the winds may blow but your
[1:56:43] roots will go down deeper it's just God

[1:57:18] all
[1:57:28] praise the
[1:57:29] Lord I'm not
[1:57:33] preaching I don't have nothing to say
[1:57:35] after all this I tell you I think we ate
[1:57:38] in
[1:57:39] plenty and I hope you
[1:57:48] satisfied
[1:57:51] um thank God for each of our brothers um
[1:57:55] and and I was looking at my watch I'm
[1:57:58] like y'all y'all can still keep going a
[1:57:59] little bit longer but uh each one just
[1:58:02] kind of came in their own very unique
[1:58:04] way and just to see how the Holy Ghost
[1:58:06] just tied these thoughts all together um
[1:58:11] just um I'm I'm sitting here just blown
[1:58:14] away by by how God does things and um um
[1:58:18] there was a a lot being said in a very
[1:58:22] short amount of time and uh but there
[1:58:25] was enough being said where I think if
[1:58:28] you're spiritual you can catch what God
[1:58:30] is trying to do uh one of the things
[1:58:33] that you know and I haven't even gotten
[1:58:35] to this part in my whole series um on uh
[1:58:38] on restoration but um restoration kind
[1:58:41] of happens in a natural form and brother
[1:58:44] brother quu was kind of saying that take
[1:58:45] this personal I'll restore to you that's
[1:58:50] personal I restore it to you right all
[1:58:53] the years that the the the Locust and
[1:58:55] the cankerworm the Palmer worm the the
[1:58:58] caterpillar all everything they eat I'll
[1:58:59] restore to you so there's a natural part
[1:59:03] to this restoration and then there's
[1:59:05] also a spiritual part part to the
[1:59:07] restoration and the reason that we are
[1:59:10] in a message
[1:59:12] church is because God made a promise
[1:59:17] that he would restore all
[1:59:19] and brother brother Troy walked us right
[1:59:21] through even the seals right he told us
[1:59:23] about the four horse riders the the
[1:59:25] black the the White Horse the red horse
[1:59:27] the black horse The Pale Horse that was
[1:59:28] something that happened during the
[1:59:29] church ages right so all that was taken
[1:59:32] as this denominations brother Mark said
[1:59:34] 30,000 I think it's up to 45,000
[1:59:37] something like that but all that God
[1:59:38] said he had to restore that that's why
[1:59:40] we are in a message church because we're
[1:59:43] part of the
[1:59:47] restoration and let me tell you
[1:59:48] something you couldn't help yourself
[1:59:49] like brother tro say we was in
[1:59:51] denominations I know I come from it come
[1:59:53] from the Baptist Church but we were in
[1:59:55] there and we were eating but we were not
[1:59:59] satisfied when they taught us about uh
[2:00:02] one of the brothers got to talking about
[2:00:04] um uh what happened in the Garden of
[2:00:05] Eden when they told us that it was an
[2:00:07] apple something inside of us say
[2:00:11] something ain't right about that a apple
[2:00:13] you sure and they come out with their
[2:00:16] Sunday school lessons yeah this what it
[2:00:17] was and in our in our hearts we're like
[2:00:20] this cannot be right I don't know what
[2:00:22] this is but when a prophet came and told
[2:00:24] us what really happened in the Garden of
[2:00:26] Eden this is
[2:00:28] that we know that this was the truth
[2:00:32] praise the Lord like brother and even
[2:00:34] baptism couldn't get that right but
[2:00:37] brother brother brother Quinton show let
[2:00:39] us know if your baptism is in titles you
[2:00:43] have no
[2:00:47] power amen and why is it that people um
[2:00:52] especially when a demon attacking them
[2:00:54] man they in the name of
[2:00:57] Jesus why don't you say in the name of
[2:01:00] the
[2:01:01] father in the name of the son in the
[2:01:04] name of the Holy Ghost why you don't use
[2:01:05] that when when you being attacked by a
[2:01:07] devil you realize ain't no power in
[2:01:10] titles but there's power in the name of
[2:01:13] Jesus and if you can cast out Devils or
[2:01:17] try to cast out devils
[2:01:19] in the name of Jesus then you should be
[2:01:21] able to be
[2:01:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:24] Christ I tell you the
[2:01:27] truth we we we just appreciate the
[2:01:30] inspiration that God has given the
[2:01:32] church for the year and you know I was
[2:01:35] I'm going say this I'm I'm going try to
[2:01:36] get out of here this this is a this is a
[2:01:38] warm spot right
[2:01:42] now but you
[2:01:44] know restoration brother Quinton told us
[2:01:47] a few weeks ago that restoration just
[2:01:49] been something that's been on God's mind
[2:01:51] even brother Jerry I love the way he
[2:01:53] brought that uh that uh there was a
[2:01:55] three-fold purpose that God had he
[2:01:58] wanted to reveal himself to his people
[2:02:01] brother brandom says he wanted to reveal
[2:02:02] himself to his people then he wanted to
[2:02:05] have the preeminence in his body and
[2:02:07] then the third thing that God wanted uh
[2:02:10] was to take us back or restore us back
[2:02:12] to eating conditions again and um you
[2:02:16] know this restoration is something like
[2:02:17] I say very spiritual and you know um
[2:02:20] just loved all these brothers brother
[2:02:21] Mark with that Unity my God uh I I I'm I
[2:02:25] was just blessed but one of the things
[2:02:27] that uh the Lord put in my heart on a
[2:02:29] natural standpoint I don't believe that
[2:02:31] this day happened by
[2:02:34] chance I don't believe that this service
[2:02:36] was was was pre-planned by chance God
[2:02:39] knew every one of us that would be here
[2:02:41] today and he knew what would be said
[2:02:44] today and um you know one of the things
[2:02:46] that the Lord put in my heart
[2:02:47] restoration being uh just the the mind
[2:02:50] of
[2:02:52] God there was a a
[2:02:56] boy that left home one day and when he
[2:03:01] left
[2:03:02] home he he he he he took everything that
[2:03:06] belonged to him and he got out of his
[2:03:07] father's house so I I just I don't want
[2:03:10] this anymore now he had a a good life
[2:03:14] but somehow the enemy come in and got in
[2:03:16] that boy's mind and say I'm I'm leaving
[2:03:18] and he went out on his
[2:03:20] own and um and while the boy was out on
[2:03:23] his own some really really bad things
[2:03:26] began to happen to him uh the Bible says
[2:03:28] that he got involved in riotous living
[2:03:31] and when he got involved in riotous
[2:03:32] living what happened was that um uh and
[2:03:36] here's the thing it's it's just amazing
[2:03:37] that the protection the covering that
[2:03:41] God has over us even when we ain't
[2:03:43] living
[2:03:45] right how many of y'all been protected
[2:03:47] by God and you know
[2:03:50] somebody should have shot you somebody
[2:03:52] should have killed you you was in a car
[2:03:53] accident and you should have died your
[2:03:55] life went right with God and had you
[2:03:57] been had you died then you know you
[2:03:59] would have made it to
[2:04:01] Heaven amen we don't we the covering the
[2:04:04] protection that God gives us even when
[2:04:05] we ain't living
[2:04:07] right this boy was out there living like
[2:04:09] that and lost all of his
[2:04:12] friends and when he lost all of his
[2:04:14] friends he he lost all his money and
[2:04:16] it's it's amazing how friends love to
[2:04:18] hang with as long as you got a little
[2:04:19] something in your
[2:04:21] pocket but when you ain't got nothing in
[2:04:23] your pocket now you ain't got no friends
[2:04:26] praise the Lord when you get broke when
[2:04:28] they done spent all and exhausted all
[2:04:30] your resources now you're broke they
[2:04:31] don't want nothing to do with you but
[2:04:33] even in a moment like that God take that
[2:04:35] little piece of furniture that's sitting
[2:04:37] out there on the side say I still got
[2:04:39] use for
[2:04:43] you that little boy just began to
[2:04:46] think see I'm out here and I got got a
[2:04:49] job that I even shouldn't have I done

[2:05:01] to do but I got this job and it's the
[2:05:02] only job I can find it was on hard times

[2:05:06] afford even though he's working ain't
[2:05:09] that something I'm working but I
[2:05:11] still I can't pay my

[2:05:36] than this and I know where I come
[2:05:38] from I know where I used to be and see

[2:06:21] and and and when he came to himself that
[2:06:22] was a part of the restoration process
[2:06:24] that was taking place right there when
[2:06:26] that boy came to himself he said you
[2:06:27] know what in my daddy's house even the
[2:06:30] servants live better than the way I
[2:06:33] live so I'm going get up from
[2:06:36] here and I'm going back to my daddy's
[2:06:38] house now I'm I'm I'm going tell you
[2:06:40] something when you get up to go back to
[2:06:41] Daddy's house you're swallowing a lot of
[2:06:44] Pride but see that's why you got to be
[2:06:46] sanded down
[2:06:50] God got to take that Pride out your life
[2:06:53] and when he's standing you down taking
[2:06:54] that Pride now he can work with you a
[2:06:55] little bit and and and the way this boy
[2:06:57] approaches that he wasn't going back uh
[2:06:59] like like he came you know brother
[2:07:01] brandom told the story how the how the
[2:07:03] preacher went to the pull pit and he had
[2:07:05] his Bible tucked a certain way and you
[2:07:07] know he walked up there and he said
[2:07:08] I'mma lay this thing out and I'mma give
[2:07:10] it to him and and he couldn't get no
[2:07:12] amens out the congregation and before
[2:07:14] you know it he uh he he took the Bible
[2:07:16] and he put his head down he walked on
[2:07:18] that the pull pit and one of the old
[2:07:19] Saints it had to be one of the old
[2:07:21] Saints I don't know why she had to say
[2:07:22] this and embarrass that man like that
[2:07:24] but she say if you would a win
[2:07:26] up the way you came downlu then you
[2:07:30] would have came down the way you went
[2:07:34] up that boy when he was on his way back
[2:07:37] home he said I'm not going
