heads for word of Prayer dear Heavenly Father we come before you today in the precious name of Jesus Christ we asked Lord that you would come in a special way to go with a service Lord the Lord we are just man and we can't do anything but it takes your presence I pray father that you will come and move us aside each individual Lord move our thoughts aside that the thoughts of the Holy Spirit to come in and minister to your people speak to them Lord through your word O God we pray father we pray that you all come in a special way and anoint your lips Lord to speak the ears to hear father that every person that's here Lord of theirs is sick here they can go home healed by the power of the Holy Spirit there's a backslider hearing never be brought back to the presence of God there's one here it's lost lore that they would find you today I pray Lord God that your presence would be so real to us father we commit this service to UBS Florida the God that you blessed his assembly in a special way best for the Jackie's family and all the church family here we asked for that your presence will ever abide with them father we pray Lord now as we get ready to turn back the pages of your Bible Lord we pray that you would make it real to us real to our hearts Lord I pray father anointed Lord for this service and the needs in this congregation we ask these things fathers we commit ourselves to you the glorious name of Jesus Christ amen unless you a man's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and see all of you again amen to be back in your in your presence and most importantly the president of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I won't be seen anymore god bless you hey man number just happy to be Christians amen I want to thank for the Jack Duff for his confidence and to have us come over to fill in for him while he's out of town and and I know we would do our best not to do anything to hurt yet confidence we love for the jack we love to church here and and we went our fellowship to continue with one another and I know it will so so we would want to do anything tomorrow and confidence amen to ask us to take his pulpit because we know a pastor watches over his flock carefully and so and he has a right to you know the Prophet said that a pastor is suspicious he has to be suspicious and because he's watching for the Sheep he's watching for any sign of anything that would come in that would you know discourage sorry or interfere with the plain of God and so we're we're thankful for people like that and God makes him that way Amen for that purpose so it's good to see all of you as I said again and just when also it's already been mentioned here but just invite you all to our meetings if you are able to come it's always good to see you and we're looking for a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord brother Wayne Lawson and I think you all know him here I think he's preached here before and brother Mike walls which you may not know I don't know but also a wonderful brother and does that we're just looking for a good time in the Lord most importantly we're glad Jesus will be there and that's the one we come to see is Jesus Christ amen so god bless you all we're just happy to be here and having to have my wife with me today also so if you have your Bibles if you want to turn to Saint John chapter 5 st. John chapter 5 and let's read let's start from verse 21 and we'll read down to verse 24 I believe it is so st. John 5:21 for as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judges no man but has to committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honoureth not the son honors not the father which sent him verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life hey man what a beautiful scripture hey men verily verily I say to you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life you may be seated this morning lord bless the reading of his word I went on I'm gonna read verse 24 also out of the Greek diagnose it reached like this it says indeed I truly say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has a own ian's life or eternal life and comes not into judgment but passed out of death into life and I want to title it this morning did all of that and title and we're standing where the fire has already been we are standing where the fire has already been and also going to read to you one more verse second Corinthians 5:21 very familiar verse to you for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him and when I got my thought from this for of course I'm st. John 5:24 but Amen if you have read any of the history at all a little bit and I read very little because I'm not really a reader but what's the model looking few things up and we find out that in in America in the early years the the natives had a term what they called fireproofing fireproofing and it says here each like this it says the Native Americans knew how to fight fire with fire fires were deliberately set near settlements and other special areas so that if a fire would move through the area and might go out when reaching the already burned area because there was no fuel so in other words as they were traveling you know across this land and moving westward they had a lot of prairie fires and you know they always they always traveled from the West that the fires usually came from the west back to back east and so as they were moving in that direction you know when you get out onto the plains of the country where it's flat lands and you can see from miles and miles and miles and and they can look out and they could see it there was a fire coming because they could see the smoke and so as they saw the smoke way in the distance and then they prepared themselves and what they did is he started a fire themselves and he started to fire on the other side of them from the opposite side of the fire that was coming and he led the whole area burn however big of an area that would burn they just let it burn everything that was in its way so after it was burned and they would take all of their families and all their wagons and the horses and whatever they had their cattle and never move it all over all of it is burnt area that was already burnt and then because they knew that when the fire that was coming they they believe that the fire when it would hit the area that was already burned it would die out and their families would be safe not all appraisal hoarded that wonderful and then to know that there is a place that we can go maybe there's a way that we can fight the fire of judgment that's coming and I believe as a believer we can look into the distance and we could all see that there is a fire there is a judgment that's coming we can all see that but the only way we can overcome the only way that we can be saved from that part is coming is to have our old fire within us and that fire is called the Holy Spirit amen so you must have the Holy Spirit listen I still believe in the old fashioned Holy Spirit I don't believe you can be saved outside the Holy Spirit I don't believe that theology will save you I don't believe that any Cree can save you from the judgement that's coming it's going to take the fire of the Holy Spirit in your life to save you from the judgment that's coming hallelujah amen because they knew that the fire Amen that would come and would hit that spot and they will die out because there was no fuel there was nothing there for the fire to burn to keep it going so I would die out oh I trust this moving then you have so much of the Holy Spirit in your life that when the fire the wrath of fire judgment comes would try to come to you and would die out because there's no fuel there's nothing in you to be changed hallelujah we're gonna get to a little bit amen amen but their state their safety wasn't standing where the fire already was hallelujah and our safety is standing where Jesus amen our safety is standing in Jesus Christ amen where the judgment already was hallelujah he made him to be sin for us so the judgment was already in him hallelujah amen notice this version he that hears or understands not just hears it but understands it or receives it many people can hear anybody can hear it but did you understand what the preacher said or did you receive what he said or did you just hear and go away I said oh that was a good service but the question is did you receive what he said he that hears or understands and believes that him who's him god police on God that sent the Holy Ghost in the form of the Spirit of Truth to you amen notice he is the one that his past is past that will be past is passed from death unto life hey man you believe that not a will pass I want you to I want you to focus in with me putting on this a man that you are already secure in Christ if you are born again of the Holy Spirit we're not waiting to be secure we are secure already we are safe in him hallelujah him as a noted he that hears or understands it or receives it is already passed from death unto life hey men you have everlasting life right now not when your body is changed not when you step in the next dimension but you have eternal life already if you believe the word if you believe what he said amen all right hey man you know the Lord oh my I feel good this morning hey man listen Jesus came to me judged in your place it's all right he took the fire out the judgment from you so we will not come into condemnation or the judgment because he was condemned in your place you will come to that place is that right not coming the judgment I've already passed from death on the line because we're standing where that fire has already been oh we can rest in that now let's look at that useful for a little bit Cameron Israel you know Israel was uh ah you know they had on or let's say God had an awful time with Israel because there are always disbelieving they were always getting in trouble they were always falling short of the glory of God as it was but God always hate grace for them and then every time they fell into idolatry and sin and all these things every time they cried out God was always there and made sound probation for them oh listen brothers and sisters he will do the same for you today every time you cry out and that he has a provision for you and he's waiting for you to cry out to him because you're gonna make mistakes you gotta fall short but don't stay down there amen Israel him as they were traveling I mean it fell in the sea and once again amen and God sent the fiery serpents amongst them amen and the service was biting them and and Israel was dying because of the serpent end but they cried out having it cried out - what don't you cry to Moses and Moses cried to God and God said here's what you must do you must make a fiery Serpent and it's something that God took the service that was biting them and told Moses to make something similar to what was killing them and they put up on a pole anyone ever come out and look up on them they could be deliverer but they had to look upon that serpent with spiritual revelation because I'm sure there was some that looked at it didn't live you had to look at it understanding that that serpent was there in the form of a serpent showing that sin was already judged yeah let me read my brother Branham says all right you still believe for the RAM don't you the devil don't like it don't eat my voice already it's that cold air blowing on my army my brother will make it we will overcome I'm used to this but I also know that God always somehow it works out yeah brother Troy I don't want the people to be all sweaty and okay amen praise the Lord so he says he says when the true believer come out there and looked upon the serpent was the spiritual revealed truth that suddenly self being it was in the form of his serpent it represents sin already judged they seen sin their unbelief already under judgment as they looked on it was already under judgment from the serpent from the Garden of Eden and the sermon was made out of brass he said which shows divine judgment divine judgment soon Israel came out they looked they looked at that serpent amen and it reminded them because you remember back in the Garden of Eden amen when God cursed the serpent because remember the serpent was not a snake the sermon was not a snake amen we know him as a snake because that's all we've never seen him in but when Eve met him he was not a snake he was an upright creature that could walk around and could talk to them and could reason with them he had reasoning power but when God cursed him he took his legs off and that's why he could only crawl on the ground hold on that's why science can't find him that's why they don't know what a missing link yes amen because there's nothing in him that resembles what he wants a member lenzi changed every bone name a complete different form came in to hide from the world what it really was but to the believer we know what it is we recognized that sermon and let me say that the bride of Jesus Christ today still recognizes that serpent and had the church world might not recognize that deceiving spirit but you recognize that serpent hey man oh my that's why they call them snakes in the grass because that was the slime yes slickest thing you see and those priests reminded him of a snake yeah and I believe it was spiritual high side today can recognize that there is that serpent now don't look at your brothers and sisters and call him a serpent no that despair a bad thing comes in people hey man and the bride of Jesus Christ has been given a spiritual discernment I mean to recognize that serpent even though God is here from the touch world they don't recognize him but you recognize him you know what the market of beasts is oh yes mama noise might sound funny but it's gonna sound horrible into any ears of the devil but your believer no sound just fine listen you have been given a spiritual insight into the Word of God and you recognize who that devil is oh my and we recognize and that's what is looking look upon him with spiritual revelation and know that that snake on that under on that Paul represents that spirit that came from the Garden of Eden nobody else could recognize that and then and then nobody could recognize that Egypt couldn't recognize it but is worker recognizing by spiritual revelation they said that's the devil that's that spirit that has been charged from my seat hallelujah thank you brother that's the one he's hanging out but he's made of brass which is divine judgment and taking a look on that serpent and they're gonna look at but it was revelation and they can live when we see Jesus on the cross hey man we can look about sin already judged oh and you are free I wonder when you look on Jesus this morning what do you see do you see you were coming into the Christmas season and most people only see is the baby in a manger k-member let me tell you when the wise men came he wasn't a baby he was a child that's right they killed the babies from two years old and under he was a little time little tiny baby but the world knows him as the baby in a manger but you know him as your Savior the one that was hanging on the cross and when I look about him I see sin already judged Oh then of the sins are already judged brothers and sisters what are you worried about if your Shin has already been judged what are you worried about hallelujah Paul said this some men sins are open beforehand going before due to judgment some men they follow after listen I don't want my sins to follow me here I don't want my sins follow me how would I confess it before the Lord I'm a my confession to be in the Lord Jesus then my sins go before me oh I can send my sins to the judgment so I don't have to go you can send your sense attachment so you don't have to go hey I would think your Christian should feel this good but listen if there's anybody on the field but it's us because your sins are gone you ask me why I'm happy I'll tell you why because my sins are gone that's what I'm happy that's why we feel good that's why you do only people on the earth that have the right to feel good to know that your sin is not only covered and it's forgiven justified hey so many went to the judgment he took it with him to the cross and nailed it there oh my lord help us to get a real revelation of that hallelujah let your confession be in him then your sins will go before you and they'll be touched your sins are Church but you've not judged then you're not a part of your sins hallelujah hey banana I believe that a mezzo he says the serpent represented sin already judged from the Garden of Eden he said he had his lane he said that's why his legs was taken off judgment Carson be thou open your belly shall you go - usually the rest of your days cursed oh ma you know what he's never gonna have legs he's never gonna be in heaven I don't think snakes are gonna be in heaven what are you thinking as much as I hate him I sure hope I hate thanks people saying why you live in Florida oh I don't know it's what God put me I don't know but I hate snakes but yeah like I know that that crawling thing on the ground won't be in heaven you know why I know that because there was not in the creation so it's not gonna be there Tory - oh boy on your belly you shall go hey man and think about it Adam was the one that should have been cursed but God didn't curse at him he touched the ground it's all right he cursed the ground for Adams sake home I wonder how many things gods curse for your sake [Music] hallelujah how many times has God cursed seven for your sake when you should have been cursed and God said I can't curse them they're my children and that don't give you a license to do wrong now no but God knows you're gonna make mistakes man he knows you make mistakes that's what has the sacrifice on the altar in heaven hey man hallelujah so Israel looked upon that sin already judged in the form of the serpent in the head that I had to listen they could not if they wanted to live they had no choice but to look on that serpent they could not look at their troubles I could not look at their problems not so they had to look from their troubles that was biting them and lift the head lift your hand your Redemption draws nigh you can't look at this world in the trouble in this world if you want to live if you look at the trouble in this world you're gonna die hey-oh but as a believer we're looking away we're looking away from my trouble looking away from your trouble we're looking to seen already changed I'm gonna lift my head up hey man is is there he is there he is he took my sin with him to the cross I don't bear them no more he brother bill what about your mistakes now that's why there's a sacrifice as I said for my mistakes hey man you take that sacrifice off the altar you have no blood you have nothing for your mistakes to cover you hallelujah amen so he was cursed he made him to be sin for us hallelujah judgment kids strike we're just ones already been it's not right judgment cannot strike where judgment has already been and Jesus took our judgment hey man we are in Christ judgment cannot strike damn again because he was already judged hey man I hope you believe him brother Brandon because I'm gonna read him as I say at home if you don't you in the wrong Church or maybe you're in the right Church and just haven't found out yet hey man and God's chosen place of worship 1965 he says he's actually praying he says their God one by one we are called one by one we have to meet the challenge to walk down through the valley of the shadow of death and it's due to every one of us as mortals but tonight you have offered us your petition that if we wouldn't believe on him and be baptized in his name that you would take us in listen I want to say say that's God's promise to you it does anybody here that's not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's God's promise to you and you take his name in Baptism and you've repented and then he will take you in I didn't promise you that he did he says and then in this body not not spirit and truth Tabernacle but in this body of Christ see the body of Christ not in the church but in the body of Christ that body has already been judged come it will not have become the judgment God poured out his wrath upon that body and that body is free from sin and being in him it puts us free from sin by His atonement that died for us in Christ in the body Paul said by one spirit we're all baptized into one body so right don't matter what you aren't you checked our Greek whatever you are everything about one spirit we're all baptized into that one bodies that right and brother branham's that and dad we have fellowship with one another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's Son keeps us clean from all sin and defilement hey man I'm gonna read that last part again because I think we overlooked a lot of times in there where in the body of Christ we have fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's Son keeps us clean keeps us clean listen it's not just one day you say I repent of all my sins that only takes care of your past sin that's what Brad said that takes care of your past sin he said it had nothing to do with your future that's why I believe he says here godson keeps us Lee he just keeps cleaning you all as you recognize your mistakes and recognize your shortcomings and confess them to him he keeps cleaning you that's why I believe there's a sacrifices in the table there that's on the altar listen brother man said if there's no altar in heaven your prayers cannot even be heard so I believe there's a sacrifice but it doesn't alter there no yeah I believe he's there I believes there this morning for you and I honey but when you accept him and are baptized in his name and he accepts your repentance you're already forgiven already challenged is that right it's we're in him hey man then we're free from the scenes I want to reach something else here you know you know you know the beautiful thing about being in him he already died he was already buried and he already resurrected and already ascended into heaven so if you're in him where are you and why are you worried about going why are you worried about it am I going to make it if you're in him he already made it so in his mind you already made it you know already died in his mind now you're still here I'm I'm looking at you so you're not physically there you understand I'm looking at you but in his mind you're there because in his mind it was finished from the foundation of the world oh my and then we stumble around and fall around and get discouraged Oh God can I make that oh god of my Christian got him outside my daughter of God it was already settled in his mind from the foundation of the world that you own are no home amen let me read something else here I love this story how many remember him mentioning build-down but the build out from Lima Ohio that traveled with him you know and come to the Lord way late in his life an old man he meant but he when he come to the tabernacle you know and one day you know what the property god says one day the light just struck and he was at the time when I go and he didn't have any clothes other than his good clothes good suit but he says he couldn't wait he our gold to the water was this him and white the light struck him him in and so and so from then on the oh they they followed me they followed brother branham all over the country back and forth so one day he comes to rod Rama he says he says hey I'm getting old I'm getting weak he was 91 at this time he says do you think I'm ready to die do you think I'm ready to go do you think I'm safe three questions how am I welcome a measured in a secrecy how many are old and weak but I want to ask you but I said do you think you're ready to die do you think I'm ready to go do you think I'm safe he says now I say in this case I'm going to give it a soul examination your doctor can only examine your body they have no instrument they can examine your soul he said but I'm gonna give you a soul examination see he says in God for the soul only has one instrument that's right and that's his word that's his word jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he hears my word he says that here doesn't mean just to listen that annoys but that here means to receive it who can receive my word Amen he hears it you know don't just stand still and call of nonsense he says he says then think there's nothing to it he says I don't believe that he said he that hears my word then that's the word of Jesus which he is the word is there you are he says now you can hear my word he said unbelievable him that sent me he has passed from death unto life and shall not come even come to the judgement but has already passed from it amen I said how's your heart beating now toward the bill now how's your heart beating now he said I believe it I heard it I received your memory and asks me question now answer three times and I believe it I heard that I receive it you know we we sometimes even in this message we make salvation so complicated but it's so simple God is still simple I don't care amen how many seals opened up and I'm not making lies the seals I believe in your William the seals but salvation is still simple and you don't have to understand my certain revelation to have salvation [Applause] Amen I said then according to the head specialist the chief operator the chief doctor of eternal life says you have passed from death unto life and shall never come to condemnation you can't be judged if you've already passed into eternal life you've accepted the remedy he imagined what a peace that was to an old man that knew his days were probably pretty few you know whether you like it or not as you get older it becomes obvious they dependent your days here in front of you are less than the days are there behind you hallelujah and what a peace what a comfort to know that you have taken God's remedy you've done it according to the doctors book you follow his instructions hallelujah and if you have followed his instructions you will receive the same results amen amen and then Paul said in Romans 8:1 there's therefore now no condemnation no condom let's say no condemnation no condemnation to them that are in the church I do have classes owned they still work do that much are in Christ because you can be in the church and be full of condemnation but if you are truly in Christ there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah you know people it's it's so strange to me people people say ho if you're so condemned now I just feel so you know well have you been walking you're walking up to the flesh or after the spirit if you're walking up to the flesh don't blame God you don't want to did it you're the one that walked in that place you don't want to walk through the flesh and if you walk in the flesh there will be kind of nation but if you walk in the spirit there's no condemnation but thank God for conviction there's a difference between conviction and condemnation conviction makes you repent of what you've done and you've done something wrong it'll make you replenish that right but you got to do it according to the doctors book you can't just sweep it under the rug and say all everything's fine no you've got to come clean your confession has to me in Jesus Christ amen everything everything be done according to the book amen then you can say let the death angel pass God's right safe it lands it's alright but only you're in Christ hallelujah you confess your sins then you can sing that let implants like that Death Angel pass Oh listen let me just show you a little bit something here listen it may ask the life moves through the stalk of corn wheat whatever it might be okay hey man so life moves through I want you to notice as it went from Luther that Wesley to Pentecost amen to Malachi 4 it was picking up all the life that was back here and brought it up with it it's not right so we have justification we have sanctification we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we have the revealed Word I want you notice one thing that once that life has passed from the shock into the seed or even from a men do run from losing the Wesley it never goes backwards our face is set came in for one thing and God's fate is set for one thing move forward we're looking straight amen straight to our goal and the life of Luther moved to Wesleyan alive but once they moved to Pentecost the life of Pentecost moved all up into the bride now where's the bride gonna go we're not going back to Luther we're not going back to white slim we're not going back to 1906 Pentecost but we're going into the garner hallelujah we can't go back oh that's why I don't understand how could we and we really believe this message how can we go back to denomination you can't go back to the nomination if you back to the nomination you left the message hello because this message will never go back to two denomination because it never came from the nomination no that's why God had to take a little unlearning man a man out of a system and ungodly system at that a man didn't know anything really about Christ and then his parents was brutal Eggers had to bring him out of that what to bring us a message outside of the nomination and that's why we cannot go back into the nomination that's why when somebody tells you you've got to see it my way or you're lost you just tell them goodbye because that's a lie you don't have to see it the way that I see it or or the way they see it you gotta hear my special revelation no I don't this is the revelation I gotta hear it's right in the Bible hallelujah hey man we're not falling man we're not pulling the nomination and then the day of falling a man is over we're not even well but brother Troy is your hill-hill hill-hill relate a jack we're not even falling for the brain um for the bill it was feeling good so now you got left me I'm filing with a Branham I want you to know Paul said follow me to follow Christ yes I know that and you know what do exactly what he said follow me as I follow Christ in other words follow Christ because for the brand are always pointed to Christ show me one place that he ever pointed to himself but he pointed to Jesus Christ and when you find a ministry or find a man that always points to themself there's something wrong every minister every ministry every 5 Foley you know whatever the gift is all to be pointing people to Jesus Christ if I point you to myself I'm pointing you to the wrong place because I will fail you but he will never fail you hey I'm gonna one brother one time he said the song we sing he never failed me yet never failed me yet he says I refuse to sing it that way I says why is that because when you say he never failed me yet it's like you expecting him to fail hey I'm just gonna see never failed me he never failed me no yet behind it not like I'm expecting one day he might fail me no he will never fail me so I might have been simple but I was pretty good never failed me yet and you know maybe tomorrow he'll fail me know he didn't feel me today he won't fail me tomorrow he won't offend me the next day he's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever hallelujah and I think as message believers it would behoove us amen to look back into the Bible say what does the Bible actually teach because that's what brother Branham used amen I probably better clarify what I said when up find with a brand is I hope people you mean in this thing for 30 years and nothing J I'm not fine brother man that sounds like the people have walked away from the message no this message is all we got there's no other message to follow listen you know Israel follow Moses is that right do you know that today Israel is still following his message my day follow Moses Moses died you know some people get offended when you talk like that I was at a place where he did he got offended because he thought I went to follow that way that we're getting away from the messenger but God was not afraid to use those same terms we talked to Joshua the first thing he said was Moses my servant is what dad now we know what a believer don't die but he had to say it that way so they'd understand he's not here the body is gone he buried the body in Jefferson Hill okay everybody gonna savor the rest of the service laughs hey man there's no message that will come to perfect you outside the message of William bland but we're following the message not the man because even the man made mistakes oh I know there's people trying to tell you he didn't make no mistakes but that is a mistake well glory to God that is a mistake ever make a mistake then I would agree with them he is God right because the only person that never made a mistake was God so I take that way that yes he's God if he never made a mistake but I can point you to place after place after place after place where he himself said I make so many mistakes now I got one question for you is that dust saith the Lord [Music] you see what happens he just run into a dead end you strap yourself every words that say the Lord well what about when he preached things differently before the seals and then different afterwards well what's the first part of the second part does say his Lord he can't all be just his Lord oh thank god the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he'll still work the same in these people and he wants a living people amen amen oh I'm having a good time pray so hard I hope it helps you I hope it helps you we're not here to deceive you we're not here to to try to get you away from the message no sir this message and I have all I have the highest respect for William Ray hey I'll gladly put him in the place where God put him in the others of a true prophet of God and uncompromising prophet of God that would not compromise on a part of the word I will give him all that honor I respect him at all that manner but I will not fall down to worship him no sir because he himself said when he went to Rome and he had the opportunity to meet the Pope and bow down he said no sir all worship belongs to God hey man let the church say Amen Holly I will not bow to him to worship Him and furthermore he wouldn't want me to that's why he dead see yo that's another just a simple little clue that lets know that Jesus was God because when Jesus was on earth and the people fell down before him to worship Him he never stopped him he never stopped him oh my you know what that tells me one thing then is that the Angley in Revelation 19 and 20 or 20 21 wherever it is somewhere in there that when the angel fell down before John fell down before the angel he says don't do it that was not Jesus then he couldn't have been changes because Jesus receives all the worship but when John fell down he says don't you do it don't do it I'm having I am of your fellow servants the prophets and you can argue with the Bible all you want but that's what it says him and that was not Jesus that was showing those things oh I know that stumbles a lot of people at home you mean there's a prophet or there's some some it ain't jellybean deck the shoulders thanks to John I don't know just go ask John at home the Bible just says but he fell down before the angel he would not receive the worship and Jesus on earth in a mortal body we're not receiving I think Matt would receive it would receive their worship so he is God that's why brother Branham would never receive worship when they tried to worship Him he went off the field he said that makes me an antichrist then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then if their worship him today it would still make him an antichrist hallelujah amen praise the Lord I hope I made it clear enough listen if I was on it while I was alive the first four years of my life I was four years old my mother and went off the scene so I was obviously too young to know anything but if I had been alive and old enough and would have known what I know now you know you know sometimes we we look at people so how could this be how could those people do that to him how could they worship him how could you do all these things but you know what if you were back there and you saw all those things and I say that because of my wife's grandmother's testimony that that knew two dolls a new brother branham very well and you know she said one day she said you know she says I understand why people thought he was Christ he said because they saw so much supernatural so much of God that they got it confused yeah well yeah we're real quick why those people had no rebel and they really didn't but we want to condemn them but you weren't back there but there was some there even then that knew better it's not right and I believe if I would have been there and you would have been there we could talk about them all we want but I think we would have done all we could have do follow the means we would have become a follower of William Branham in that hour because we saw so much of God we wanted to be there whatever God was doing me we wanted to be there that's why God had to take him from the scene that's why God had to take him for two reasons because of that and also because his message was finished hallelujah people are just waiting for him to come back and tell us what to do here what he did I say this morning if he wants to come back he wouldn't tell you nothing different where you already told you [Applause] because if he did he would break his own word he would break the word that Paul said positive I come see Paul knew did the revelation that he had given that even Paul couldn't change it later so if brother Branham wants to come back he wouldn't change nothing he tell you exactly what he already told you because you just preached out of the world hallelujah hey man if I cut that all skewed up you just go to Jack and say don't have that guy back I'll leave that and let him clean up the rest welcome home jack no a men you know pastors work he's never finished you can go to job and go home and rest sleep at night or whatever but he's always on call maybe the only time he's gonna cruise and there's no Sun and there's there's no phone service might be the only time he has any relief I'll let you touch the phone off and woe unto him Oh if he turns the phone and all but I have a need you know this is this age this this agent we're in it and we have no patience whatsoever I wondered how some believers today how would you have function 40 years ago 30 years ago how would you have made it when there was no cell phone when you add the weight do you got the tailor he got home to make a phone call and then you call the house of the pastor and maybe he's on a trip and you don't have a phone but you know what the church survived the church was did just fine without it the pastor's probably had it easier amen but we are everything's right now we went to McDonald's drive-through and we want everything everything is just push-button drive-through fast food all that you know everything we want now we want God to answers now on the pastor better answer the phone now if he doesn't answer maybe he doesn't like me patience where's patience why has it gone hallelujah hey man I better go on you can have a few more minutes [Music] praise the Lord and then he says sin looking unto Jesus he's thought about it every time that something major was happened there was in preparation he said John made a preparation for the escape and then he said so it's the Holy Ghost today for running the coming of Jesus Christ it's Megan a construction the body of Jesus Christ of the Holy Spirit but for running the coming of Jesus no we don't believe in two different cheeses are now you know but some we we say well the Lord has already come yes he has come and the manifestation of his word but blood Ram was still looking for it's coming in 1965 and this is in 1964 the seals open when all supposedly happened right and then in 1964 yes so is the Holy Ghost a for running the coming of Jesus listen I still believe that one day I'm gonna meet him I'm gonna meet the person Jesus Christ he's here today that's true he's here and his spirit in his bride a man manifesting who you are but one day we're gonna go see him the one that died for us oh I want to see him look upon his face hallelujah he's making a construction the body of Jesus Christ we are baptized into it not by creating up by the nomination or a handshake but by the Spirit of God we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ into the body of Jesus Christ he's an a construction that will stand the judgments because it's already been challenged when I see the blood I'll pass over you maybe so God has a place that has been fireproofed now you're with me a place that has been fireproof a place that the judgment has already burned all the trash all over your land hallelujah it's called the Holy Ghost hey man it's all ready and listen if the Holy Spirit is in you now he goes on he says and Christ the mystery I'm gonna try to hurry through this is we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot past just report he's already judged that body in which I am a part of he says what how am i a part of it here it is if you abide in me and my words about you asked what you will I'm a part of him hallelujah another place he says he says it don't have to be judged he said the church already is is it don't have to be judged it's already been judged for a judge Christ and Christ is judgement when we when we are in him we are free from judgment hallelujah if God touches you then he's unjust he says what a statement Christ ago a judgment for us and by one spirit we are baptized into the body he that believes in Me has everlasting life but should I come to judgment st. John for his calling and the sixth seal he says cause see she has not one sin not a thing against her the grace of God has covered her over and the bleach has took every sin so far away there is not even ever a remembrance of it not a thing but purity perfect in the presence of God hallelujah hey Makenna miracle more back the word in there and you can go home and digest hallelujah just once more 1963 says he promised me that I would be there and he has already given me eternal life hey because he said he that can receive my words and believe on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the judgment but it's passed from death unto life that's good enough for me is it good enough for you that's good enough for me hallelujah right there that's my absolute that's my absolute he promised it there is no way for it to ever fail and never failed me yet no never failed me notice that why you're in that body you are just as free from condemnation as he is let me ask you something how free do you think Christ is from condemnation do you think he has any condemnation at all then you shouldn't either if you are in him you're just as free from condemnation as he is you'll never have to stand any judgment God costs judgment to be struck upon his body and if you're in him God cannot judge you he's already judged you when he judged crying and you can't be out of judgment no more Christ took it when you're baptized into the body of Christ you're free from God's judgment the wrath of God will pass over you hallelujah I'm so glad aren't you hey men hallelujah Paul says in 1st Corinthians 3 he says every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire you see when the judgments of God come it will prove what you have but you notice we men if you really are sealed away by the Holy Spirit you won't be here amen we can see we can see it coming now we see the shadows we see the clouds all of it now is that right we can see that judgments coming honey but she won't be here when it's totally unleashed upon the whole world because you've been sealed in by the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost fire in your soul and the wrath cannot touch that's all hallelujah and then father says because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is you're gonna have to prove somewhere alive you're gonna have to prove what you got you're gonna have to prove if you got the fire or just the church confession or do you have the Holy Ghost living in you that's keeping you hanging man the Holy Ghost and fire it's keeping me alive is that a ski holiday is it keeping you alive this morning hallelujah hey man when you read when you receive the Spirit of God then you can fight the fire with the fire hey man so listen as we get ready to close when Satan tries to bring condemnation on you you tell him I'm standing where the fire has already been I'm standing where the fire has already been judgment has already passed from me there is no condemnation hey man do them were trained in Christ Jesus and I mean in Christ Jesus you have to tell him that hallelujah hey man just one more here conferences 1960 Jesus was brought himself to a decision let's stand together as we get really close and before going to Calvary the father brought its own son into conference in Gethsemane while angels taken their positions to see what the decision would be oh he said it might not have been this way but let's think maybe it was I could hear him say son do you desire to go on to Calvary there's a band waiting for you that's persecution there's theft and murder laying in the way there's exposure of your own body they'll strip the clothes off of you they'll beat you into pulp they'll pull a crown of thorns over your head and you'll die screaming for mercy should you go on think about it what a time that must have been any what your eternal destination was hanging on his decision should you go on he says look at the decision sometimes when we stay in our seats and the Holy Spirit says you must do this or you must do that you got someone you won't speak to you won't speak to them you won't make it right you're just ashamed to go up and say if you're on the wrong or what if you're not in the wrong to go up and say brother let's forget it and talk it over he brought it right from the decision that Jesus made had to make the decision you have to make somebody in this assembly that you won't speak to you got to make a decision this morning we know what the Father's will is no when you do it or will you not do it hey man he says brother let's forget it and talk it over Jesus when he looked up into the face of the Father oh and this is what you gotta say it's not my will it's yours to be done he says what a decision think about it this morning why he would have made the wrong decision we wouldn't be here today you wouldn't be looking at me I wouldn't be looking at you but rest assured he could not make the wrong decision because there was God in the flesh any man and that was the very purpose he came was to make that decision to say I will but not a question this morning is what will you do hey man he said that decision anchored and swept the world and still comes tonight to every penitent soul not my will but time be done let's bow our heads this morning every one of you this morning you are standing in your gifts M&E you're standing in the same place that jesus stood and the father is asking you this morning what will you decision be you have fought against somebody you won't speak to somebody he's asking you this morning what is your decision what will you answer back he's asking you are you just going to sit there and clam up are you gonna sit there and crawl back in your shell and say I just can't speak to them or will you do what Jesus said not my will but thine be done Lord I wonder there's somebody here this morning that has a need like that I'm gonna give you the opportunity to raise your hand to the Lord Jesus and say I'm standing in Gethsemane I'm standing at that place but this morning I want to raise my hand and say not my will but time be done if I need to go speak to that sister if I need to go and speak to that brother not my will but yours be done Lord today this day I'm gonna go speak to them because I

that important any hello he's important not my will but thine be done you have a spirit of jealousy on you this morning maybe you want to raise your hand just say not my will but his will be done I'm raising my hands this morning I will not be jealous over that brother I will not be jealous or with that sister hallelujah amen [Music] not my will but time behind brothers and sisters we're standing where the fire has already been we're standing in a place where there is no scene we're standing in Jesus Christ if we're willing to confess our sin confess our own and let the fire of the Holy Spirit
