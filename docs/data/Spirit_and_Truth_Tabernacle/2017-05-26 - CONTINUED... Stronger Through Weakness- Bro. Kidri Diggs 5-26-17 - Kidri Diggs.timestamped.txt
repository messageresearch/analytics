[7:44] Lord Jesus like my uncle says what a
[7:49] word what a word what a word aren't you
[7:54] happy you came to church tonight so much
[8:02] was just was brought there you know the
[8:06] sermon a strong and weakness and justice
[8:10] brother Diggs was just kind of sharing
[8:12] about prayer and you know how prayers
[8:15] it's a worship right even brother
[8:17] Branham taught us that it's a worship
[8:19] right we're not just going with a bunch
[8:22] of complaints and a bunch of you know
[8:24] requests but it's a worship right even
[8:28] even when the disciples asked the Lord
[8:30] Jesus to teach us how to create the
[8:34] widget Lord this just teaches we haven't
[8:36] heard the Pharisees praying we don't
[8:38] hurt the Sadducees pray we heard mommy
[8:41] and daddy pray we heard all these people
[8:43] pray but we want you to teach us how to
[8:45] pray and the Bible's a response to just
[8:48] just start by saying our Father who are
[8:51] in heaven and as he was I was just
[8:53] thinking about that tonight you know
[8:54] heaven represent
[8:55] atmospheres right if they our Father who
[8:58] are in heaven he's able to change
[9:00] whatever atmosphere you're in right our
[9:02] Father who are in heaven hallow in see
[9:07] when you get to the word hallo it just
[9:09] at the beginning of that prayer it's a
[9:11] time of worship
[9:12] Halla would be your name is just what I
[9:14] glorify Lord I bless you Lord I I praise
[9:17] I exhausted because I know you the only
[9:19] one that can be exalted and you know it
[9:22] ne ne ne ne ne ne ne child understands
[9:27] how to butter up their parents they
[9:31] young lady knows how to make sure she
[9:33] stroked at his head and do something
[9:35] right and you actually got she got she
[9:37] gonna butter them up tell them how
[9:38] nicely looking and all kind of stuff she
[9:41] got a purpose for saying that but after
[9:44] she gave him a little worship then she
[9:46] gonna come with a request and typically
[9:48] daddy cannot deny specially she don't
[9:52] work them up real good she just daddy
[9:54] just came to mine and you know what
[9:56] we're made just like I'm father I tell
[9:59] you what we just go to them with that
[10:00] worse if we go with adoration we'll get
[10:03] into tension church if your motive in
[10:06] your heart is right you'll get his
[10:08] attention
[10:08] I like that just just bring them into
[10:11] the environment bring them in with your
[10:13] praise I've always told the churches say
[10:15] if you ever looking for God when you're
[10:17] really going through and you like man I
[10:19] just can't see God I can't feel God I
[10:21] can't hear God I don't know if God hear
[10:24] me I don't know that you're ever looking
[10:25] for the Bible says that he inhabits
[10:28] which means he dwells in the midst of
[10:30] your praise that's why when job was
[10:35] going through you know that if you just
[10:37] just read your Bible you see when after
[10:38] all of this bad news that job's got I
[10:41] mean for different people came with four
[10:43] different reports the last one was his
[10:45] children being killed in a house
[10:47] together but you know joke day rather
[10:49] than complain joke did something that
[10:51] most us just need a revelation that we
[10:54] need to do job out his face to the
[10:57] ground and he began to worship
[11:02] that changes the whole situation and you
[11:05] ever want to give a devil of mom that or
[11:07] worship when you're going through a man
[11:10] just worship while you're going through
[11:12] Oh glory to God amen that that's when
[11:17] your praise really means something yeah
[11:20] you got to be able to shout when you
[11:22] don't feel like it hallelujah hallelujah
[11:25] a man a man god bless you brother Diggs
[11:29] we appreciate you tonight he got to
[11:39] talking about so many things there and I
[11:41] was I was I was like Lord I'm trying to
[11:44] save my sermons but he was he was into
[11:47] some new sermons you know that the Lord
[11:49] had just kind of put in my heart and and
[11:52] you know I'll just one thing I'll share
[11:55] with you there was a man by the name of
[11:58] George Muller and George Muller wrote a
[12:02] book on releasing the power of prayer
[12:04] and just many things that he you know he
[12:07] shared just in his own life he born
[12:11] 1700s 1800 something like that and the
[12:13] rand orphanages about ten thousand kids
[12:16] came through his orphanages and in his
[12:18] lifetime God used them in a very mighty
[12:21] way but there was a time with George
[12:23] Muller had run into this gentleman and
[12:25] and the man was you know it was
[12:28] encouraged by George's testimony sort of
[12:30] answer you know I've been praying for my
[12:31] my son's I got six points I've been
[12:35] praying for these boys for the years the
[12:37] years just seemed like nothing happened
[12:40] but George encouraged me say look you
[12:42] know what you need to do is keep praying
[12:44] for so keep praying for as they not only
[12:47] expect that God's gonna answer your
[12:50] prayer
[12:50] so keep praying and then expect that God
[12:53] gonna answer prayer you're saying and
[12:55] the last thing you need to do so you
[12:56] need to start praising God for the
[13:01] demand apply George's uh advice we say
[13:04] within two weeks of applying that advice
[13:07] five of five or six six boys out giving
[13:10] their heart to the Lord within an
[13:12] eight-day period
[13:14] has been serving God for years the next
[13:17] time we saw Julie they've been serving
[13:18] down for six years but after I begin to
[13:20] bless God right not just complaining but
[13:23] I begin the freight I begin to worship
[13:24] Him in the midst of my prayer then I
[13:26] thought God changed that thing around
[13:28] within two weeks so church may be
[13:31] praying for something I don't know it
[13:33] could have been a long time but now it's
[13:34] time to start worshiping because he's
[13:37] already heard your prayer oh he's a good
[13:40] good father he's a good good father and
[13:49] I believe some things were released in
[13:51] this place tonight I believe that I
[13:54] believe that y'all such a degree know
[13:56] some things and my and and you know
[13:59] sometimes you you have to be able to
[14:01] catch the moment right and it was like
[14:05] when when the angel would go down in
[14:06] trouble the water they had to be ready
[14:08] for the moment and tonight as the you
[14:10] know he just started talking about them
[14:12] laws and everything and I mean God knew
[14:14] exactly what was in my heart I had some
[14:16] things that I was you know he ain't
[14:17] saying he over there touching my hand
[14:19] but in my heart I had a request and as
[14:22] he was touching and agreeing I'm God
[14:25] know what was in my heart that was going
[14:26] forward I didn't get a chance to tell
[14:27] brother Diggs but got new ones in my
[14:29] heart right and I'm touching I say I'm
[14:31] agreeing on that I'm receiving it
[14:32] tonight hey
[14:36] I'm receiving it tonight so i'ma just
[14:39] start praising God for it Amen it's
[14:42] already done it's already done I believe
[14:45] that I believe that my god
[14:47] Amen God God bless you let's have a word
[14:50] of Prayer and I will prepare to dismiss
[14:54] you tonight father we're so grateful
[14:57] your your word is it's real
[15:01] your presence is true and God has a Lord
[15:07] your Minister just got himself out the
[15:10] way just administer at our hearts
[15:12] tonight God we leave here strengthened
[15:14] and encouraged no matter what the devil
[15:17] is thrown in our direction and the
[15:20] Gottis seem like we've been distressed
[15:23] cast down not destroyed persecuted not
[15:28] forsaken God we've gone through many of
[15:30] these trials and tribulations but
[15:32] because of the seal we couldn't be
[15:35] broken god we couldn't leak so god we
[15:39] thank you for that we thank you that
[15:40] vasila the Holy Ghost is upon my life we
[15:43] might not have realized it but God
[15:45] that's just a demonstration tonight of
[15:47] lords of how we've gone through some
[15:49] things but yet we're still holding on
[15:51] what what a mighty God we serve father
[15:55] as we Lord just prepare to leave this
[15:57] place there are many things that people
[15:59] touched an agreed on it was in their
[16:02] hearts God I believe they're going to
[16:04] have exactly what they asked for and I
[16:07] believe the process started here tonight
[16:09] made a stake be placed in the ground
[16:11] that Lord it was on that night that I
[16:14] was at the church that my state was
[16:16] driven down and I'm and I'm holding to
[16:18] it no matter what I feel no matter what
[16:20] I hear no matter what I see I'm holding
[16:22] to what what what happened there that
[16:23] night God we thank you for this we
[16:27] realized Lord that the reason that we
[16:29] have trials is because we found favor
[16:31] with you and Lord the devil come with
[16:36] all kind of temptation what that is it's
[16:38] the lures from our destiny Lewis from
[16:41] you know your purpose and plan for life
[16:43] that's what the temptation does it pulls
[16:45] us off of off of the tracks but God we
[16:47] realize tonight
[16:49] you don't send that God to knock us down
[16:51] but you give it to us so we can get
[16:53] stronger and you so help us Lord to
[16:56] accept count it all joy no matter what
[16:59] it is that we're going through we pray
[17:01] that you continue to bless your servant
