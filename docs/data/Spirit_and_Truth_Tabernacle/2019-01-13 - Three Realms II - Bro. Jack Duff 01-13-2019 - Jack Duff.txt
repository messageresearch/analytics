here just a few weeks ago we had everybody buy some stuff of teachers and and sister Tina put it all together a man in little bags we found the school right here down the street had 52 teachers we took 52 bags down there to the school and when I got there I'm like lord I can't find nobody to give this to and I said look please open up a don't let me find somebody man pull around back of the school event you know I saw a guy coming out in the back so I'll pull around the back found a janitor say hey we want to give you all these you know these these bags here and he said I says they're place for me to put him he say yeah he says this is a donation I said yeah for my church to the school they say I'm going to get the principal so he went and getting the principal and principal came he's like is this a donation say yeah we heard that y'all had 50 to just so we brought 52 bags and and we're gonna give you all this he's the principal well let me help a little some of this I say sir we'll take the help and God sent about three other people to help us unload everything and and we bless that school you know with some supplies and the the the the principal is very very appreciative of that so I want to thank everybody for just contributing to that and as we come to the business meeting we'll talk about some of the things that we do as outreach for the church and how everybody can be involved in helping make an impact in our community a man so praise Allah we thank God for all things let's go back to Joe - we started a path on Friday night and I felt that it would a man be good for us to kind of keep going down this path it must give a disclaimer amen as we get started here we are moving into some things that pertain to this day scriptures that pertain to the day that you live a man and now so we're gonna be kind of talking about some things and it might be very what I would call message centric a man but God sent a message in your day to get you prepared for a rapture and and I need to tell you about some of those things right Amen God sent a message and no one's day to get them ready to get in a boat all they had to do is listen and get in the boat right hey man God God always sends messages to his people so this gonna be very message centric my intention is to point you in the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ but understanding what God is doing in your day is extremely important a man we're not just going to church just to go to church not just going through the motions but we got a purpose we're trying to make a rapture a man and we need the food the necessary food to prepare us for rapture a man so we're gonna be talking a lot about that and I'm gonna do my best just to kind of take my time and let the Holy Spirit just have his way I'm not gonna rush we'll get as much as we can and then we'll go from there but here in Joelle to a man I'm reading two scriptures today Joelle - in Revelation 10 Joelle 2 verse 28 says and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions a man and also upon the servants and upon the hand mates in those days will I pour out my spirit amen let's just slip over here to Revelation 10 a man and just verse 7 - most of you this is a very familiar scripture Amen but it says this this is a scripture that was actually manifested in this time by God it we look at revelation and most churches run from it but this is something that actually happened during this time I'm talking about over the last you know within the last hundred years this was manifested a man a man says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let's pray amen over the Word of God father we thank you for the ability to read scripture but we trust that the Holy Spirit now will bring clarity to the things that we are reading help us Lord to enter in and receive from heaven even at this time we take control over every spirit that is against your spirit and father we ask that you would just be free to move in this place everyone that has come here today Lord you ordained to be here so father may you speak from heaven and may we all draw closer to you through the words that we hear today said in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated so good to see brother Dave back there Amen haven't seen him in a while god bless you my precious brother good to see you a man we were talking on Friday night a man on the subject of the three realms three realms amen and we're going to continue in that vein today we're in that channel if I could put it that way just start me off with this quote from the message the Ark amen three realms is what we're talking about here today amen here this first quote just kind of says there's three elements that people live in and I want to call it realms right but three elements that people live in first is the humanistic second is divine revelation and third is vision amen these are the three realms that we're talking about humanistic divine revelation and vision now this like in prayer when you pray for anyone in humanistic we say well I hope you'll get well Oh hallelujah amen it's a difference when it's divine revelation but but and humanistic is always a prayer of just hope I hope you get well you know I'm just going back to the testimony I heard on yesterday amen one of the sisters was sharing you know just break that down just a little bit for me it's just sharing with me how you know I want to say this when God puts you in contact with people amen it's for a purpose right people that he bring into your life is for a purpose it's not just you know just wasted time or anything like that but but this system was telling me how you know she was working on the job and she used to have to take telephone calls from this person all the way out in Oklahoma and here she's standing in Florida taking telephone calls from Oklahoman and they the lady would be sending a fax and they have to stand there and guard a fax machine so they would you know talk on the phone before the fax was coming and and over time they built a relationship and the lady beginning to talk a man about you know just just some of the things she was going through and one of the things was her daughter couldn't have children because she had no room hallelujah is she had in a womb and so the sister just began to just kind of you know just take that and and just you know it's just kind of you know I mean being a you know if that lady would have told that to a man it might not have had the same impact that I had by her telling it to a woman right because a woman understand how to you know she desires to have this child she wants to have this child so she sympathizes with and she beginning to pray for the young lady and and and one day you know just standing there the Holy Spirit said tell that mother that her daughter will have a child when you get on the phone tell her she will have a child this says or pretty much right she will have a child now you got to understand this this girl ain't got no wound how she gonna have a child right so so but divine revelation came down it managed divine revelation say she will have a child right so so you know kind of got around and danced around a little bit and then you know when the when the mother got on the phone you know she just kind of didn't say too much then she say you know I just got to tell you you know you have that baby she's a UH she's got no woman why she gotta have a baby I say I'm just letting you know like the Lord told me to tell you that you look your daughter I don't have that baby and now she say okay alright we'll just see well time goes by and she never said another word to the lady who should take them faxes and never said another word but one day that lady didn't have a fax but she had a telephone call to me one day she got on the phone say I ain't got no fax today but I got some news to share with you my daughter is pregnant the world without the womb she's pregnant her final revelation dropped down into that situation and said tell your daughter now remember this goes back to last Sunday's message because Joshua when he stopped the son a man it was not simply because the Israelites was in battle the Israelites were helping the Gibeonites it's the Gibeonites that was in trouble right but God can anoint you to help your brother God can anoint you to help your sister hallelujah somebody here she's standing in Florida the other person in Oklahoma Maine even never met the person but God connected them hallelujah God don't make no mistake God don't make no mistake come on somebody amen amen IIIi believe God is own time God and he's a a man he's a God that has has he has structured or what he's doing he every time something happened he no one's getting ready to happen come on somebody a man but divine revelation can strike like that this quote goes on the city says like in a prayer when you pray for anyone in humanistic we say well I hope you'll get we'll see I'm hoping I'm believing with you trying to use all the faith I can that's human right you say second is divine revelation when something's revealed to you you just know in your heart it's going to happen yet there's nothing but just the revelation no sensation no emotion all you got is the revelation and can I tell you something that's all you need a man all you need is a revelation as Jesus says upon this upon this rock rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it hallelujah say I said nothing but just a revelation and third is a vision course that's thus saith the Lord that's perfect and positive now you know I share with you all last week how you know the Prophet got a man a divine revelation just to read in the scripture about about Joseph and it felt so in love with the character in the scripture that God told say I'm gonna give you Joseph and you know in due time he had a Sarah but a man we know that was all God's plan but but and even though people's criticized said I thought maybe you meant Josephine not Joseph no no God told me at Joseph and do time God gave him exactly what he said through divine revelation can I tell you something you all are sitting in this church today based on divine revelation i'ma just share quick testimony I'm gonna go to find it but you know I remember years before this church got started I was just reading my Bible and I was going through John 15 and as I was reading John 15 it was just talking about how you know a tree in order to be more fruitful a tree have to be cut a man and I say say even though the tree might be bringing forth fruit in order to be more fruitful it has to be cut it has to be proved right and I was like okay Lord watch what you try to tell me out of scripture like okay you're speaking something to me and I just I was like okay I'm holding on to that and I went to a convention maybe about a month after that and the first preacher come out of the gate turn to John 15 and he preached a sermon fruit much fruit more fruit I say Oh God say I know you speak him to me if nobody else is here to hear this this one is for me and as he preached that sermon i sat there a man listening to them preach and I said okay Lord I'm yielding I understand what you I mean you you're saying something here to me on yielding what do you want me to call name of the church now what he was telling me is that I was in a fruitful church but in order for me to bring forth more fruit I had to go through a purging hallelujah amen I know he's telling the truth because I'm looking at you today hey man and this is more fruit hallelujah can I tell you something amen sometime when God do that is because your ministry will will reach people that the other minister will never reach God got purpose for everything hallelujah some folk will grow better underneath your ministry they will underneath another ministry it's nothing wrong with you it's a very fruitful ministry but God want to bring forth more fruit that's all a man I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm sending away not to put nobody down I'm lifting everybody up huh God using everybody for his glory come on somebody but I said then that media and say Lord what do you want me to do with this he said I say what do you want the name of church be say spirit and truth Tabernacle after I read John 15 after I heard that Minister preached that's when God gave me spiritual tabernac now I had to wait on that I couldn't just go start immediately in strife feelings of spiritual time and I had to wait and it took about two years before I even told anybody before I even told my wife what God has said to me it took me about two years and you know we had about two years later she and I had this conversation in the car and and we knew God was transitioning us and you know and and and she said well what the name of the church gonna be I say Spirit of Truth type of that cuz you say well how you said why you said so fast like that I say because God did this and God did this and God I say old she say oh okay so when I knew that you know oh come on you got to have a wife that's gonna support you you ain't really got a ministry if your wife ain't supporting you somebody save me right but but but when God just beginning to do a third than I knew that we could do this thing right so but but the way that I got that in the way we got here is because God dropped divine revelation down and that's all I stood on I had no vision I had no emotion I had no feeling I had to find revelation and I stood on that thank God for the fruit of it so sometimes you're gonna have divine revelation you have to stand on that and it like I said on Wednesday night when a person a man has has faith or revelation because faith is a revelation when a person has faith and they can see things what they're doing amen they cannot they see things that other people can't see because the others are blind to it now in the natural if you have a person that's blind you don't fuss settle you don't you don't yell and scream say can't you see that watch where you walk him can't you see that bit the car almost hit you no you don't do that with a blind person but you're patient with them hold on to my arm walk with me and I'm gonna make sure you get through this thing safely huh it's the same thing spiritually you got to be patient with full and wait for God to bring them to the level where you ask can I taste them even if God show you something in a dream even if God show you something on vision you have to learn to be patient with others hallelujah somebody I got something to say here come on now I'm gonna say this let me see where I got this time limit I want to say it just right if a gift is not handled right it could destroy a family or even a church can I say it again if a gift is not handled right destroying family or even a church give me questions and answers part to see oftentimes dreams may be symbolic vision symbolic so you have to pray over interpretations amen and I want to say this before I get started we're not afraid to accept what God has promised us 1/4 - Joel - we simply want to align it with the word now watch this this goes along with that stop that statement gifts I'm not if they not handle right they could destroy families even churches look at this question brother branham what shall we do some something has settled over me that I cannot breakthrough last fall I dream I was lost in white saying it was getting dark I couldn't find it I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now I am as one groping in darkness my son Irvin and wife are included in my dream now they are also in darkness we are in a desperate we are in desperation I believe God was show you what it is what is our hearts what is in our hearts now all right if we if we're wrong or sitting sitting places tell us we want to be right look at the answer now I don't know the lady but I just feel if you're here lady that here's your trouble you have let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in white sands represents purity and righteous zcc I tell your dreams and things are sometimes symbolic you got to pray over amen it says being a white sand a man represents purity and righteous you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream prove that there's nothing wrong come on now since you're only nervous and by doing this because you nervous by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it I like that and then because she nervous she making a family nervous start doing it that's why I say a gift can destroy a family if it's not handled right right say start doing it hey man he says I'll say it's a claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you aren't white saying everything is all right it's you yourself nervous and you let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset it's Satan since then if one member the family rejoices let the rest of them rejoice with it so everyone of the family try to do that try each one of you children to help you Papa a mama mama you papa Papa you try to help the children don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirits get around you can I say it again doubt your doubts don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit take over your family a man you are Christians you are born of the Spirit of God you are the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the Bible said if there be any plates if there be any virtue think on these things see put the dream back in the scripture think on these things don't think about the wrong thing and sister I think that's your trouble sister dear so all she needed just a little correction on a dream to understand what the what the purity what the white white represents she's drowning and white saying what means if she wasn't she was pure right and man it was pure was righteous in a devil trichter with our own drink hallelujah that's why you need people that can actually interpret these things glory to God and I'm gonna tell you if God has given people the ability to dream he's also giving somebody else two-bit liability to the turf it alright can we go a little further hey man I want to show you something here in Scripture we've been talking about Mary for a couple weeks and I want to pick up Matthew amen one 18 through 25 we read this few weeks ago I want to come back to it again a man Matthew one Oh God these three realms that God deals with people in humanistic aim and divine revelation and visions sometimes a vision can also of be a dream because if the dream is correctly interpreted it's a vision a man if the dream is correctly interpreted now every dream is not from God hallelujah okay and no matter how spiritual it is every dream is not from God sometime the devil wants to anoint you in that room as well right the devil will attack you why are you sleeping and y'all know it's the truth hey man that subconscious that you're in the devil would love to try to get into that you got that sometime that's why it's good just pray over your mind before you go to bed and man that way the devil don't look just don't run roughshod all over and have y'all up at night you're scared to go to sleep praise God if you having bad dreams put on a tape y'all didn't hear me if you having bad dreams put on a tape I'm talk about the word not music the word let the word play inside your bedroom and yet watch the atmosphere change in that bedroom you'll be surprised there are certain things that even go into your subconscious while you're sleeping hallelujah glory to God you'd be wondering the Prophet said this surprised how do I know that it went into your subconscious while you were sleeping get the word in there you want if you want the devil's I put the word in hallelujah glory to God I never see no devil overcome the word he always running from the word come on charge alright let's go on a little further here I'm in Matthew 1 verse 18 I want to just read this rather quickly but I want to just kind of substantiate these things a man this is this is another realm that God was using a man at this time look at this it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was to put her weight privily a man but while he thought on these things behold angel Lord appeared unto Him in a dream the angel Lord came to him how in a dream so the angel or could come to you how in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now for me I believe that angels still talking in the next few verses I believe it's not an insertion by you know by the one that wrote this by Matthew I think this is the angel still talking look at this he says now all things was done that it might be fulfilled all what things she was pregnant she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us now I believe that angel took Joseph back to the scripture and by taking him back to the scripture with the dream hallelujah that could settle him when you can get the scripture involved with what God showed you then that should settle you come on somebody because now look at the next verse then Joseph being raised from sleep so after that angel shared amen what was going on how it was connected to prophecy then Joseph raised amen from sleep did as the angel of the Lord and bidding him and took him to him his wife let me just kind of just drop a couple of things in here and you can get this quote lined up for me God as its own interpreter I want you to understand a man something about that oh my god let me read this quote first before I say that a man look at this God is not his own interpreter the Prophet makes a statement says did you ever notice how God dealt with Joseph there in a secondary way so the dream was actually the secondary way this isn't the reason being is because if people don't get they don't get control over their gifts then they would try to use dreams to dominate the church the church saying with me they when you will use your gift to try to dominate and influence how things work in the church huh but that's not the way to supposed to go the Word of God is the thing that should dominate the church the dream is secondary all right we are we together now did you ever notice our God dealt with Joseph day on a secondary way in the way of a dream we know there's dreams we believe in dreams I believe in dreams God always dealt with people in dreams but dreams is secondarily see it could be right or wrong unless it's interpreted but he didn't need an interpretation it was God Himself speaking directly to Joseph because there wasn't a prophet and a lanthanum based interpret there had there hadn't had a plate of there hadn't had a prophet for 400 years so the next best that God cared for the welfare of his own son will speak to Joseph through a dream and without interpretation said the woman is right the holy thing which is conceived in her is the son of God didn't need any interpretation listen God does his own interpreting doctor - honest sincere hearts can I say that again God does his own interpreting - honest sincere hearts men and women that look upon this thing that's mysterious if you're honest and sincere and we believe God has a way of interpreting it to you if you stay honest you stay sincere God has a way of interpreting that thing to you oh my god gonna interpret something to somebody today let me go on a little further God gonna interpret something to somebody today and if you just send searing your weight on the Lord he has a way of showing you can I go a little further a man God has a way of interpreting G first find out if it's promised if Joseph had just went back and got away from the traditions and went back to the Bible and found out Isaiah said she was gonna do that and the things that were spoke of in his birth and all about it it was spoke by the scriptures by the holy prophets as Peter said and no man has a right to put any private interpretation to that it's just exactly what God said would take place he was the manifestation of the Word of God promised for that day God said it so there was that settled it now I want to say something here we know that dreams are a secondary way for God to get his reveal will to his people will to his people dreams are secondary way the primary way is through his word or through the sinning of a prophet the Prophet comes and it gives you the interpretation of the word that's not that's God's primary weight hallelujah now let me go in a little further we know that dreams are secondary wait for God to get his revealed will to the people but when God brought Christ to the earth during his first coming he used dreams and supernatural experiences to confirm his first coming the secondary way but God used a dream to confirm his first coming that's why he went to Joseph in a dream it was to confirm his first coming that a virgin would conceive hallelujah are you with me because I want I gotta say something here if God use dreams to confirm his first coming is it possible that God can also use dreams a secondary method of speaking to people can't God use dreams to confirm his second coming see now we just turned a corner now we just turned a corner y'all still with me I lose nobody at dinner because I'm not trying to lose you but I want you to stay with me because I'm bringing you I'm bringing you correct Amen I got you I mean everybody know about Joseph and Mary hallelujah everybody can read about that and we believe that but can I bring you father can I take you to Revelation 10 and show you that before that was manifested God whose dreams to confirm that all right Church hallelujah hallelujah what's the purpose of Dreams the purpose and never neck Nebuchadnezzar's day a man when he called for Daniel come forth and interpreted the dream because he was getting ready kill everybody he said don't man and not a man had a dream and he knew the dream was important but he forgot it he had no idea what he dreamed he liked now and I know it's important he said now you magicians y'all supposed to have gifts one of y'all better come tell me what I dream they say now this has never been heard of that a king tells the people to tell him what date you want us to tell you what your dream no you tell us what you dreamed them we'll give you an interpretation he say if you don't if you don't come up with what I dream I'm a kid I'm a hack everybody in pieces the man was serious he knew the dream was important the dream was actually a dream for the entire the dream was a dream for this day Nebuchadnezzar had it way back then but he was looking into a future day come on somebody sometime the dream is to help you see something that's coming in the future and God is using that to warn you about something oh my god my god hallelujah let me go a little further he say he say he say he's saying now y'all ready y'all better y'all better give me the interpretation my dream you've not only given interpretation tell me what I dream and give me the interpretation he wanted both so when they went to took the e-tag out to kill everybody and see this is why it's good to have relationships because Dania had a relationship and he kind of stopped the guy that was coming saying I'm going to just give me a little time out here why I was so why are you being so hasty so he said look now you can kill all them but not not me and my fellows over here these three Hebrew boys leave us alone you can take care of wrestling but but but but leave us alone give me a little time when he three now dad you say he say he got to the king and he taught to say just give me a little time my teeth and the Bible say Daniel begin to pray and seek Lord he act the extra you know this is why I even also acts the Hebrew for that's why I said on Friday night if you need something from God that's why we come and pray and then God can use a gift in order to give you the answer to what you need come on somebody amen the brought the Bible tells us that these things are going to happen in the last days so don't be afraid of them just get them lined up according description so so Danny and the Hebrew boys beginning to pray and then the Bible say in a night vision God brought that thing to Daniel and with Daniel heard he began to rejoice he beginning to thank God he went to the keys and I need to tell you what your dream and he told the King everything that he dream and he said yeah that's exactly what I dreamed and I it came back to him he said brother branham even said he can't give the interpretation unless God gives the vision of what you dream if you went to the Prophet with a dream he could not give you the interpretation of the dream until God gave him the vision of what you dream and there were many times that the Prophet would tell the people you forgot this part of your dream and you forgot that part of your dream and you forgot that part and this happened and that happened so yes that's exactly right because God was showing him the vision of what was in the dream it was God show Daniel the vision of what never kanessa hat in his dream then Nebuchadnezzar could get free he gave him a dream and then he also gave them the interpretation hallelujah let me go a little further here oh my god remember there's three elements three realms amen that people live in humanistic divine revelation and visions Oh glory now what's the purpose of the dream of Neven and Nebuchadnezzar's day they needed clarity hallelujah can I also say this a man and Joseph before he married Mary he needed direction anybody here need direction today God can use a dream to give you some direction I only had one person neither direction only one person in this church need direction all of us need some direction all of us lose okay which way should I you know you always operate like that right but sometimes God could give the dream to somebody that you wouldn't even expect him oh my god and here they come to you well you know the Lord said something like this to me and I don't know why he said that I and can I tell you something if God give you a dream just give the people what God gave you don't be fishing Oh y'all leg y'all they hurt me don't be fishing because God gave you gave you something now you fishing you know the Lord Gaming it's know what you think about that no they what God told you to see that what you think about that part is you keep that to yourself just give the people what God gave you and get out of the way you want to know why because it's not about you it's about God I'm going a little further I'm going further so to dream a man and Joseph date was for direction right and in Nebuchadnezzar's day he needed clarity and Joseph day he needed direction as to whether he should marry her a lot right so so the dream gave him it gave him direction it settled his heart it did all these things right the other thing hallelujah in the case of Joseph in the book of Genesis the dream that he had showed him future status the dream that Joseph had in Genesis of his of the 12 stars coming to bow before him and all of this it was showing him future status now it did not show him what he was gonna have to go through to get to future status let the dream did show future status and if God ever shows you future status you can hold to that knowing that somehow someway God gonna bring you to it come on church make sure it's lining up with the Lord oh now come on now cause every dream ain't from God if it's against the word it's not from God but but the dream can show your future status now I want to tell you something amen oh my god God used after Joseph went through everything he went through God use the interpretation of dreams to actually bring him into future status he used the dream to show him future status and then when when when Pharaoh had a dream it he could interpret Lee when he got Joseph out of the prison God used the interpretation of trees to bring him to future status God can use a dream come on church all right all right let me go a little further here you know I let me just give you a quick testimony had a brother right here in our church that had a dream of future status and he had a dream about working for a particular company and he uh he didn't never thought about even applying applying to work for this company God gave him a dream didn't gave him second dreamed in a game of third dream and why would he give three dreams it's to confirm it right three dreams that he was going to work at this company now he went and uh he just kind of mentioned it to a brother because he knew brother in the church that was working that's like brother I wouldn't mind joining your team he's like you joining my team I never even thought that you would I would never even considered you to join the team never even thought about you he said yeah when I went mine join your team you said well go ahead and apply for it then so he applied and you got to understand the job that he was applying for he had no credentials he would I say none was not qualified in the least bit for applying for this job so when HR got a hold of it no just a quick no it's not gonna even take us time to to call the committee together no this is not gonna happen send it right on back to email no thank you for applying but no but the brother was holding on to the drinks and see when I'm telling you when God speak through these means this goes beyond know this is why you want to get yourself in position which I can speak to you you got to stop watching north since that night on TV how you give your mind ready when you go to sleep with that nonsense get your spirit prepared for God to speak to you brother they sit back and said know that you know I want qualified they say they did he said okay hold on I'll call you back I'll call you tomorrow so he went to the the boss and went to the HR department say I want to interview that guy the guy ain't got no qualifications yes I want to interview him my god my god and and I'm gonna tell you you know sometimes it's good it was a book I read you know some years ago but sometimes when you're when you're looking for if I got any pop anybody here hiring some time are you looking to hire people hire people that might be outside of the skill set that you're looking for like this one job they needed somebody that was real good with filing they went to the library and got a librarian right because they had the skill set that they were looking for even though they might do it in the library no I want you to brain that that knowledge of that amen that no skills over into this position thank outside the box so here this brother he say say I'm gonna talk to him and I'm gonna get them the car you he went talk to him they say okay he said but the interview HR said at the interview same people that told him no and if he would have stayed with that rather than with the dream he would have never got a job you know where he got the job with no skills because God gave him the dream oh my god now I'm not talk about Martin Luther King type stuff here that's not one I'm tougher I'm talking about God speaking to you through a dream all through a vision because these are three rails that God uses two of the three humanistic is another room like that humans live in but God can use that to get his divine will reveal to people now can I go a little further a vision don't heal you I was you know looking at and I'm coming I'm coming here in a little second a man but a vision if God gives a vision of visions not what heals the person I was looking going back and looking at congressman Upshaw testimony and he was he walked into the meeting and the prophet said I see a man the young boy he failed and he heard itself and now he's in a wheelchair and you know but I see him he's coming into manhood and he's becoming a great man and now he's becoming a greater man and now he's becoming a greater man so I see this man but I don't know his name I don't know who he is that's all the knows this man and he's in a wheelchair so uh the people raised up real quick say sometimes I'm gonna tell you something God don't have to call your name he just got to call your condition and the people that was around say say that not that's that's uh that's congressman Upshaw that you're talking about and he's here in a meeting so he say he want to talk to you brother branham and say he say he say okay you say son how did you know that happened to me he said I'm just I'm just telling you what the vision said he say you know I've been holding on for 60 years that God went healed me do you think God will heal me he said I don't know the vision and show me that it just showed me this and he said you hold it on just keep holding on God to do something for you so he say he said okay I'm just holding on so he uh put the mic down and brother Brandon begin to pray for others Danny saw another vision of this young lady young girl that was operated on and the doctor did this and the doctor did that that's why you got to pray before you go underneath the doctor right because the doctor did this is the doctor did that and and and and the young lady lost something and then some ability to do something so the mother was there and brother branham just kind of calling out and and the mother said that's my daughter she didn't know the name but knew the condition that's my daughter that happened huh will she be here he said I can't tell you that all I saw was a condition so he went on in the prayer lines and also he saw a little girl standing there with a little baby walking down the street a little baby doll walking down the street he said mama auntie thus saith the Lord your daughter is healed and he says she said she say she say parson when is she healed he said right now when the vision came it was right then oh my god I hope y'all get that see I mean a vision came the sister shared last week I'm expecting things right now you say you see so you say right now and the girl drop whatever she said mama look at me say that girl jumped up and began to run around that place say they had to get had to get some muscles over there settle them down so then after that happened in the vision popped about the about congressman nutshell say he say saw brown suits with a stripe in and then all these other things and he said congressman do you have a brown suit with Australia say yes I just bought it yesterday he said well thus saith the Lord you can receive your healing at 86 years old and congressman Upshaw said well when will I woke he said right now put your sticks down and get up and start walking in the Congress congressman put them sticks underneath them and before he could get them all up he dropped them down they start walking at 86 years old the vision is the set the Lord and it it's positive because you know if God's prophet was here giving you a vision you'd be all over that but the Prophet not here but those gifts are still here and if somebody else came to you with the vision are you able to accept that are you gonna look at them and say well nice coming from you and if you doubt it you might miss it I accompanied y'all had a meet how many y'all need direction God is able to use things like this to give you direction just satisfy the need but you gotta be in a spot where you can receive it and let me also say this if you gotta give your life got to be an income in alignment with your gift I tell you how long you know we don't want we don't want a game time game time Christians you know what I mean they only show up at game time they're not at practice we want we want we want we want people that's gonna be a practice and also at game time then we can trust you we know what you're doing when you get on the court because we've done practice we know what to do when we get on the field because we don't practice I ain't running some different routes and you throwing interceptions come on somebody we can avoid that if we just come to practice so we're not just looking for gifts just to be going run running why we want it we want to in control what the Holy Ghost come on somebody all right I'm going further I'm going further oh Jesus Jesus Jesus Amen all right now let me read a little statement here out of the sermon is this the sign of the answer I'm going to paragraph 237 in this and we're turning this corner and trying to just I'll bring it home somewhere here but I need to get to six visions I mean six dreams in and one vision a man I want to get to this and I said God might answer somebody's I believe God gonna answer somebody's question even through this glory to God this is a this is a statement I need to read though I believe that the seventh angel of revelation 10 is church age messenger revelation 3:14 now this now this is what the Prophet is saying this is his quote he says I believe that the seventh angel revelation team is the set of angel or 7th aged messenger of revelation 3:14 now I just read rebel I mean a revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of God will be finished I just read that but now if you want to know what angels he talking about you got to go back to revelation 3:14 hallelujah amen it's the seventh angel to the seventh church age which is leav SIA amen the first angel to the first church age happened to be Paul Ephesus but throughout the years to the Gentile Church ages a man not just to the Gentile church but to the Gentile Church ages from the time of Jesus coming to Earth and and them and the Jews rejected him to paul picking up and saying we turn to the Gentiles God has been dealing with Gentile people hallelujah glory to God amen his attention has been on the Gentile people all the way up until this time and amen at the time of the tribulation it goes back to the Jews come on now he's already started working a little bit with them amen but but when we will look at that there's what he's saying here revelation 10 amen he says I believe that the seventh thing to relation 10 is the seventh church age messenger of revelation 3:14 remember now let me read look where I can read now that this was a seventh angel now he goes on to say this song in Revelation Tim seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he says when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets that's revelation ten seven he says now notice this was an angel and it's the age of the seventh church age because it says here the seventh angel of the seven churches found that I found that if you want to see who that where that answer is revelation 3:14 the angel to the Laodicean church and that's the age in which we live in in right now this is the last age before Jesus will come amen this is the lair to see in church age Laodicea actually means people's rights and if we're not live age where everybody got rights not just people animals trees I never had never been sued by a tree but because somebody hugging the tree right hey man they upset and they want to bring a lawsuit in children can take their parents to court and the courts will listen to it when God told me in my Bible spare the rod spoil the child I told my girls me was coming out if I'm gonna go to jail it's gonna be for something good I got to be able to go to jail and smile i'ma give you something to call them for now glory to God but this is the age of people's rights so what was being spoken of a man in in the book of Revelation was symbolic to something that was going to happen in a future day do you realize John when he wrote revelation was caught up in a vision he was calling for a vision and he was writing from a vision so if John amen caught it by vision it would take a prophet to interpret the vision that's why in the days of the voice of the fourth angel then the mistress will be finished yeah me you don't have to stumble around and try to figure this out in law just listen to the voice of the seventh angel can I go further he made a statement if the vision was spiritual it must be interpreted by the scripture then he says or a continuation of the same scripture so the grip is if the vision is scriptural it must be interpreted by the scripture or a continuation of the same scripture now I'm not just I'm gonna take time and just drop this in here and then I'm going to do six dreams I'm watching my time because I know how y'all we read let's let's read revelation 10 7 again if the vision was scriptural it must be interpreted by the scripture see when Joseph a man was told by the angel to fear not to take Mary as his wife that they were fulfilling Scripture with this Joseph could be settled in spirit once he knew scripture was actually at play can I tell you something when you're looking for a church you're looking for somewhere to just settle once you know scriptures come into play that's what settles you can I tell you that it's not it's not the feeling it's not the emotion I mean we if y'all wanted to shout there was a time in the service that you could have shouted when they hit that song of the early could well you could have broke out one but now we talk about settling you we talk about you talk we talk about you finding a man a place to settle you know you know the the doves could not find a place to settle when the flood came the crows could eat up everything they didn't come back to the art man they had a smorgasbord idea hallelujah they were going from church to church that's eaten anything and everything but the dog said I ain't built like that I can't eat that nonsense huh I need to get back to the ark i'ma just bring a little leaf back but the rest of the stuff I can't even touch they built different can I tell you the reason you sitting here today because you built different hallelujah you Eagles that was in a chicken coop trying to learn how to fly didn't even know what fly was all about but when your mama came screaming over what's your mama no word of God the truth that your mama gave birth to you the Word of God gave birth to you mama came screaming over the word say die set your wings this way and flying up here lead them chickens alone and when you heard from mama you start flying and your wings ain't settled down yet come on somebody glory to cut what I'm talking about you you flying into revelation ten seven you flying into revelation 3:14 you're planning to Malachi 4 this goes beyond Daniel the Lions tears come on somebody hallelujah is right here in the Bible ain't saying no not the Bible right here can I read a little bit glory to God I said a vision if it was scriptural it must be interpreted by the scripture or a continuation of the same scripture now revelation 10 7 just told us that but our days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as if the clear to serve as the prophets that was being continued from revelation 3:14 give me that one see that was a continuation of the same scripture revelation 3:14 let's pull that one up and then after after you get that one an extra gonna be Malachi 4 5 & 6 revelation 3:14 says and unto the Angel of the Church of the lettuces and I see most people looking for a angel from heaven this was a human oh my Paul actually says that he was an angel to the church that's what the Bible's saying right so so so this ABC 7 angels were seven men messengers that God used their ministries what the purpose was is to bring the church back to his word that's that's all God used these ministries to bring the church back to his word and he used them supernaturally onto the Ange of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of God so revelation 3:14 was continued in revelation to him 7 but God didn't just speak of it in revelation 3:14 in Revelation 1070 also spoke of it in the Old Testament Malachi 4 or 5 and 6 the whole I will send you now notice that notice that you is very personal not behold I was sinned then that's why I still got friends in the old church that I left when when I read this scripture I thought God was talking to me all of us did see it so I'm just patient with them y'all still with me well I will seem you Eli to the Prophet can I say something not Elijah the prophetess Elijah the prophet now notice when Elijah comes how many know we live in an in town before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord that's when Elijah comes it's a continuation of the scripture but go on to the next verse and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with the cursed last two scriptures in the Old Testament Old Testament closes with this now we all know most people clearly see that John the Baptist fulfill the first part of that scripture pull that scripture right back up for me again he fulfill the first part where it says then he should turn the heart of the father's to the children John the Bible plainly says in Luke that John the Baptist did that but what we're looking for is the other part of the scripted be fulfilled and that was fulfilled in the Ministry of William Miriam Branham who was born in 1906 1909 his souza revival I mean a sudra Street happened to 1906 he was born in 1909 died in 1965 already been fulfilled God sent a prophet I wasn't even born before he came but his ministry influencing me thank God for - I'm glad to be walking underneath this truth can [Music] we go a little further now you know before a man he could get into what his real ministry was because his real ministry wasn't just a signs wonders and miracles the real ministry was revelation 10 7 can we read it again the real ministry was revelation 10 and 7 that was the real purpose of God sitting her turn the hearts of the children back to the faithful Files which meant tear on hearts back to the word look we only do things in this church that's based on the word if it ain't in the word we ain't doing it I don't see praise dancing in the word I don't see it well we gotta you know let him minister minister hi only time I saw dancing like that was with Herodias and I prophet ended up losing his head over something like that praise God and you let that keep flowing on church a lot of other brothers gonna lose their heads you might as well say a man huh lust fear just running all over the church we want to keep that down we don't want we look and you know y'all just watch these brother they just tojust minister [Applause] hey brother I'm looking at your eyes my friend that ain't no ministry its ministering to the wrong spirit inside of you see can i i'ma just be so bold and say this it used to be you kit you only watch stuff like that on TV nine o'clock after nine o'clock you know what I'm saying it had to be on HBO or Showtime now you can go to church and see this nonsense not here praise God a man in anyhow I don't even know what what happened if you try to get up here in praise there's I don't even know what what happened praise God alright hey man not here I'm trying to go further in this y'all I really am I don't even know where oh ok revelation 10 7 is his ministry this his ministry revelation but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as you have to clear to service the profits now now there's many mysteries that we're talking about here that the scripture is talking about and I don't have time to go through all of them but I can tell you one mystery is what what really happened in the Garden of Eden did they really eat an apple or an apricot like some say did they eat a fruit and this lady recognized she was naked not only recognized she was naked but also ate a fruit and had a child from it come on we know people don't eat no fruit and have children we know how people have children so that's if there is it wants something so supernatural boy this this fruit ain't even here no more it's still here it's still here cuz they still having children the same way right amen so what happened was adultery in the Garden of Eden and that's why the Bible even says to plate one place it says King was of that wicked one that's not Adam Adam was not wicked Adam was God's Son who willfully went into sin huh in order to not he couldn't redeem his wife but in order to be identified with his wife only Christ can redeem fallen man can't redeem right so Adam identified himself with his wife just like Jesus identified himself with us by leaving his throne of glory coming down the earth and dying for us right but but but but we know it was it was adultery she yes she got a man for the Lord do you realize that any woman that gives birth to a child naturally God had to be a part of that you know it'd take a miracle for her body to do what it does to bring forth that baby because if the body don't do it then they have to do some cutting come on somebody right so it'd take a miracle so whether you saved and not save it still take a miracle for God to touch your body to bring forth that time that's why you can use terms like I have got this child from the Lord she had twins Cain and Abel right Abel was from Adam Cain was from the devil the devil got into the serpent that's why in Genesis 3 you see when God called everybody to give out the punishments he'd come for no alligator he didn't call for a chimpanzee then call for a gorilla God called for Adam he called for Eve and he called for that serpent and the serpent the punishment for the serpent y'all remember y'all Bob the punishment for the serpents that the serpent had to go on his belly that tells us something that means the serpent stood on two feet at one time and the serpent was the closest thing to a man then man himself now you know what I didn't know that when I was at my Baptist Church I found that out when I found out God sent and reveal these things that was one mystery another mystery is how you how you really supposed to be about to us cuz we got church this baptized the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus I said yeah I know and now you tellin me ten days later the same man that was walking with Jesus sleeping with Jesus talking with Jesus same man that got keys to the kingdom got it wrong when ten days ladies say baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ he didn't have it wrong he had the revelation right he didn't have a role C in it but it is people are lost to Revelation but but Peter say the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ how you gon pray and bind Devils in his name but can't get baptized in his name you don't you don't be praying that we know with you something happened on top.i something real go down you ain't said no in the name of the Father Son and Holy Angels like our Toria that plane was going down there fella spoke in two languages in the name of Jesus and ain't nobody Zeus make sure you get this but that truth had to be restored to the church otherwise we'll be walking around and darkness stumbling around still trying to find my way but God brought this truth back I'm trying to get somewhere there are so many other truths is I mean is it one God mm three gods no it's one God it was God the Father God the Son God the Holy Spirit but all those are just titles or offices of the same God in Old Testament he was God the Father the God above us in the New Testament a man Jesus Christ walked with the disciples he may email and many well got with us that was God with us it's the same guy all he doing was changing his mass it's the same God Alleluia and then in this day since Jesus is not physically walking with us he sent his spirit and not ask the same God dwelling in us not three gods one God but we don't got this all mixed up not Christianity look like it's pagan these are mysteries that had to be restored and and see brother Branham taught those truths there's a lot of healing campaigns porno but people teaching truth that was different his ministry was an administration after after a man all these I mean the scripture said in Revelation 10 7 there it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished all those truths were already finished as you have to clear to servants the prophets now let me let me also say only a prophet can give you truth theologians can't only a prophet can give you truth that's the way God speaks that was his primary way of getting his words as people is through a prophet alright here's what I'm trying to go so before he actually came to Revelation 10 salmon and the manifestation of that scripture in his ministry he was continuing for Malachi 4 continuing from revelation 3 and coming all the way into revelation 10 7 and now God wants to do something with him sorry and I didn't read all this but it was the seven thunders other than their voices that was revelation one through I'm revelation 10 verse 1 through 7 it's talking about the seven thunders uttered voices which was the revelation of the seven seals that the Prophet brought us nobody else could bring that revelation so God used the Prophet to bring that revelation to his people and that's what settles to church all the revelations that are contained in the seven seals so it was a literal revealing of revelation five and six messages that God would give him but before he could give him these messages he had to prepare him to go a particular place now I told y'all Friday brother Branham when a vision come he couldn't he couldn't put people in certain places to make the vision happen if the vision say this person sitting here this person sitting here and then you're gonna pray for mundane gun that they had to be exactly according to the vision one time we went to pray for that boy and it wasn't according to the vision the boy almost died he had to wait for everything to get in place before the vision could be fulfilled now I want to tell you something that was training that was training getting him ready for revelation 10 oh that was all training to get him ready because he could not go West to get the seals until everything was in place and God you sent six dreams and one vision to get him out there to the west all I can do is give you the six dreams right now I'm trying my best to get out of here kid I'm a killer so just just stay with me and let me let me give you this let me give this six dreams this is all out of the message services just a time first dream brother Jackson had a dream in February of 1961 about the top of the rock they said brother Branham was interpreting the mysterious writing on the stones that was in the rock it says the Prophet picked up like a crowbar and ripped the top of the rock off and told the people light had never shined on this before look on this and the people began to scatter after the prophet went west he said only a few stayed to look on the stones that had never been interpreted so when brother Brennan was preaching the message services at the time he was actually trying to tell the people look I'm getting ready to leave my church not not leave Branum Tabernacle but I gotta go west because God got something else for my ministry he said but while I'm gonna stay with this night stay with this don't don't get up and leave just because I'm out west don't leave Church keep coming to the church when God gave me something I'm coming back but I got to go west according to a vision so this vision I mean this dream is connecting to the vision that God gave him and and brother Jackson saw this in a dream God use a second drew I mean six dreams here's a second brother Billy had a dream he says he dream he was going down a stream of water going west and C notice eyes everything is going west sending the Prophet west right he says you say he dream he was going down the stream of water going west it seems as if he was hunting for cattle he saw the Prophet rounding up cattle after he got them rounded up the Prophet was noticed motioning to brother bila to watch over the flock watch over the cat or I should say he says watch over them and he told him he told brother Billy in a dream keep the cattle on the right side in the dream a man he knew the cattle would want to get thought away of least resistance but they must stay on the right side of the river now what did that mean in the dream he said the cattle stand on the right side means stay out of denomination get him how to keep amount of denomination still the right side of the river amen and when brother Brent gave my brother Bill of the cattle he took off and went west so now so now you know here we see right here in this dream God speaking stay out of denomination how you're gonna go back in stay out I'm going to show you a courting dream how people go back in it's right here in these dreams the next 1/3 dream was brother Roy Robeson he had a dream that he and brother Brandon were rounding up cattle and all the brothers were eating eating dinner and brother brother soft been raised up while they were eating dinner and said he larger the great prophet will speak today at noon you know but unfortunately people heard that the people didn't wait around at noon to hear what the Prophet had to say they took off and did not hear he lied to the Prophet numbers number four this was sister Kalos the pastor's wife where actually she was the Deacons wife at this time but eventually became the pastor's wife so the college dream the dream of a wedding in the church and the bridegroom came in she said the bridegroom was perfect says but the bride under said but the bride didn't really look that good and it seems she said seem like a communion or a big dinner was being served in the church by brother Neville who was the pastor at that time and when she saw the big dinner Amen being served in the church sister Collins got upset but she said she said the food that was being served what's the best food that she'd ever seen but because it was being served in the church she thought that she should leave and go somewhere else she was upset and I just I'm talking about the dream and the dream she got upset about the food being served she influenced her husband to leave this is a dream she was influencing our husband to leave now notice what what happened now this is her dream now say if so so they were leaving to go elsewhere to eat since she was feeling it was wrong for them to have food in the sanctuary and this is this is a statement when they did when they was getting ready to leave her or go somewhere seat say the light on the right hand side went out this is the direct quote he said when when they did the light on the right hand side went out and now the prophets say man you didn't know what that is now set me up said we know what that is David get ready to leave because she was upset notice the wife was upset that they were serving food in her dream there she was upset that they were serving food in the church so she encouraged she encouraged husband and they would give it a leaf and as they were leaving the light went out now the prophets say you know what that is let me go a little further prophet said the bridegroom is perfect but the bride is not perfect yet it says and he said the food that they were eating with spiritual food and he also said we know what it was when the light went out in a dream I want to say this your light will go out if you stop eating the revealed word for your day so as they were leaving the reason the light was going out because they stopped feeding on the food for their day can I say it again your light will go out if you stop feeding on the word for your day can I go a little further to mow brother Parnell had a dream that he was coming to a meeting in a new church I like that brother Devin thank you you called it you called it glory to God a man he called it now all I need is one to agree with me if two of us touch and agree we can have anything because that's the same thing I said when I read it brother the brothers say he was coming to a meeting in a new church see he went somewhere else he went the same place I went to because I'm coming to a meeting in a new church brother partner had a dream that he was coming to a meeting a new church he was told and is is good it's gonna be good so he was told this is a closed meeting and it's only for the Deacons he felt stepped on the little and went out at the door but once he got outside he saw brother Branham standing there and looking westward see all these a lot of important westward westward this was before he could going fulfill revelation 2:7 he had to go out west that's where he met the seven angels 1963 come a man of seven angels and revealed to him told him to go back east and preach the stills before that happened he had to be out in the West he knew he had to be in Arizona God showed him that look at this he says says once he got outside he saw brother Branham standing there looking westward the Prophet told him not to feel stepped on I like this don't feel stepped on but I will direct you what you should do this is important the Prophet told him in the dream he would first come to Zipporah which meant - or stop he says but when you but but but pretty much but when you get to the pora don't stop there then he says his second stop will lead him to an old woman but don't stop there says brother Parnell go until you see my wife and when you find my wife stop there so in the dream brother Parnell looked back and he saw his own wife pumping water from a whale and he saw a minister trying to pull away from the pull away from the pump my brother Branham says Zipporah in this dream representatives of Zipporah and the old woman represented churches in the dream hallelujah look at this since no matter how old the organizations were they were not supposed to stop there but when you find the wife his wife which was the Church of God the church that God had called out in the last day stop there I said it because sometimes we've been looking and we've been we don't been a part of this organization that organization we don't stop that many of them and can't find what we're looking for but when you find Christ's wife his pride you can stop searching you ain't gotta wait for nobody putting a chair out for you to join the church you know where to stop stop there okay I want to say it again let the Holy Spirit let this one sink stop there stop searching stop there this is the last dream just a step he came to the prophets house she had a dream she said she came to the prophets house before prayer house for prayer before she went to surgery so it's a Stepford dream she was out west and she saw a really old man standing on top of the mountain looking eastward she couldn't understand who the old man was but she kept drawing closer and closer and let me tell you something you might not understand what I'm talking about just keep drawing closer closer it all makes sense she kept drawing closer and closer she then realized that the old man was Elijah the prophet she said I must see him and ran towards Elijah to speak to him and when she got his attention it was actually brother brother and brother Branham Acts assisted in a dream what do you want sister Steffi and seeing and so she woke up from the dream but the thing of a thing of it was is what she wanted was the prayer to be prayed for before she went into surgery and when she came to the prophets house before she went into surgery her dream was actually manifested but God gave her to dream about him being in the West to confirm some things to him before revelation 10 7 was fulfilled because he had to go west and then come back east to bring the seals brother branham had a vision and I'll close with this one here this vision went along with the dreams this is out of services just a time and this is going to be paragraph 114 I'll close with this year before revelation 10 7 and I and I and I could just also go a little further to you amen that the fulfillment of Revelation 10 7 the fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 & 6 the fulfillment of revelation 3:14 all of those things are connected to our Lord's second coming all of those scriptures are connected to the second coming of the Lord just as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming God had another messenger in this day sent to forerun the second coming we're not here just quoting things just to be quoting things but God has a way of getting his word to his people before destruction strikes says one day coming down five years ago brother Norman from brother Norman's I was driving down the road he just had a meeting up there and the Lord God appeared to me in a vision I was sitting in front of my gate up up here at my house and it seemed to be bad weather many of you people will remember the vision as wrote in my book of visions I put them down so I'd be sure that I don't forget them and in this vision I saw there was something that had come through the lane and there were stones laying all over my yard and there was graders and scrapers up and down the lane and trees had been cut down and routed up and I started to turn in to the gate and it was all blocked off with stones I got out this is a vision now I got out to say to the man why this and he got very hostile shoved me backwards and said that's the way with you preachers I said I only asked you why did you do this you're coming over on my side of the street here why did you do this and he just almost slapped me and shoved me back and I thought I'm just gonna tell him that he doesn't know what he's talking about in the vision and a voice spoke and said don't do that you're a minister can I say something don't do that you're a Christian don't do that you're gonna destroy your testimony don't do that don't post that don't go there don't do that I can preach it just I can call it don't do that don't do that your Minister and I said very well and I turn around until my right sitting in front of the gate was an old Prairie schooner you know what a covered wagon now I told you dreams sometimes a symbolic the Prairie schooner actually represented his station wagon he owned the station wagon and so he at the after this event happened to his front yard they were getting ready to widen street come right down the lane he have to actually take his gate and move it it was it was a stone gate and you have to take it up and move it back a little bit so they can get the street in there and God has showed him when this comes to pass go west he says now turn he says says now turn around and to my right sitting in front of the gate was an old Prairie schooner you know what a covered wagon with horses hitched to it what's the horses representing horsepower in the car yeah y'all get that you know you know you know nay hum said he saw who uh carriages they call them horseless carriages in the city jostling in the street now that's how he that's how he described it he didn't know what to call it but we call them cars horseless carriages what they mean just in the streets accidents may harm saw at a profits order and start describing it oh my god hallelujah look at it he says in say the opposite the driver saw was my wife I look back in the back of my children was sitting back there I climbed up on the wagon I said to my wife honey I stood all I can stand and I picked up the lines and pulled the lead horse and started heading west and a voice said to me when this comes to pass then go westward now he had the other dreams that was also telling him go westward so he knew at the beginning of 1963 he had to go westward and he made some statements say if God don't speak to me while I'm out west and you know and in a short amount of time then I'm going further I'm going on up into Alaska he said God won't speak to him while I'm in Alaska then I'm going without food so it for a long time until God speak to me he knew he had to go west another thing that happened in some of the dreams one of the people said that after brother Branham went he pretty much disappeared they didn't see him no more and can I tell you that after he come back he went to went west March of 1963 got the Steel's brought him back here to the east start preaching them and now we got the revelation of what rebel I mean revelation five and six what it means we got that now you know within about two years after that God called him home it was finished the mysteries were finished but all of that happened and all it was connected just like Joseph had a dream at the beginning at the first coming of the Lord here got using all these dreams at the second coming the Lord to show us where we at and I'll bring you things that happened back in 61 62 63 how much coal are we now how much close are we now I can tell you this much have you been searching and trying to find this and trying to find that stop you found what you're supposed to be you know you now you know you're supposed to be and now let this get you prepared for this great rapture let's break father your word has been spoken these different rims that you deal with people in visions dreams sometimes in the humanistic realm of just believing that you will do it just hoping and believing that you'll do it my prayer Lord is that people are here the still small voice of the Spirit speak to help them O God to find peace and to settle them Lord in their searching and we know God that there's a place that you could have for us to go where we can fit Elijah when the famine was on and there is certainly a famine in the land a day is famine for spiritual things but Elijah had a place that he could go and be fed he couldn't go everywhere there was only one place that Elijah could go and be fed Lord is the same thing today it's only one place that we can go and that's where ever the reveal word is being spoken if we're not hearing the reveal word God we're missing it our attention should be on you you being the the great bridegroom you were perfect and as a dream said we weren't perfect yet but Oh God we're coming into that because the word is bringing us into it Lord my prayer is that to us help us to hear what the Spirit is trying to tell us in the
