and we thank you God even now father for you began our miss said lo ever two or three are gathered father you promised to be their father God we thank you Lord and you got Hyde I saw behind your cross Lord God Lord God your word would God have its preeminence father in every heart we thank you Lord and we commit all things into you tonight father in Jesus Christ and we pray amen god bless you church I trust that everybody had a prospering day it's been a it's been quite the day for me but uh I think the Lord anyhow he allowed me to make it here tonight and he allowed us all to making it tonight which means you got a plan and he's got a purpose now I won't take too much time I would like to turn to a verse here Genesis chapter 22 and we'll start at the first verse so we reads and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham and he said Behold Here I am and he said take now thy taking out our son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moria and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the other and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood off for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young man abide here abide ye here with the ass and I in the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you I just want to stop there you see he said and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again unto you you see Abraham knew not only that he was coming back but his attitude was that he was going to worship he goes on to say and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on pond Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father he said Here I am my son and he said Behold a fire and a wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both so they so went both of them together I also want to read a scripture in James chapter 2 verse 22 it reads seest thou how faith fraught with his works and by works was faith made perfect may the Lord a blessing to his reading now if I couldn't you guys may have your seats thank you if I could use as a title the Lord inspired me just place this in my heart it would be the right mental attitude towards a perfect faith now I believe is going to take a perfect faith for a perfect rapture and just going through the story of Abraham what I really like here is that Abraham had a big trial after 25 years of a promise son he was put to a final test and God didn't give him a test without knowing the result God gave them a test knowing that Abraham was going to overcome but Abraham had to realize himself that he was an overcomer and Abraham's attitude towards this test was quite remarkable and to me Abraham's faith was bigger than his trial right the reason why Abraham's faith could stand bigger than the trial was because his faith was in the big of God you see ever hams attitude has hit the right his the fact that he had the right mental attitude allowed God to show him that in every situation every trust in God God will always make a way now faith asks no question right when when Abraham was asked by God to go in and take his only son Isaac Abraham's response was his reaction the scripture says he rose up early in the morning right and he sat at his ass and took two of his young man and with him and Isaac his son and cleaved the wood for a burnt offering now Abraham didn't waste any time he rose up early in the morning and he saw first God's command and not only does faith ask no questions but faith moves faith moves and expects God faith moves the doubt out the way faith moves the sickness out the way faith moves that the feet out of the way faith moved on but out of the way and it expects God the the objective of faith is expecting God to come down seen the objective of faith is knowing that God has already completed the work now I like what the Prophet says here he says in the message the sin of unbelief 19:58 zero 5:17 he says and there's only two spirits that control a man there's that's either it's faith or unbelief when you catch Christ in the heart no symptoms bother you from then on no matter what takes place you still call God's Word the truth and when a person finds that place in Christ that faith that says by His stripes I'm healed there could not be enough doctors in the world tell you he was fixing to die no matter what your symptoms are you believe in anyhow he says faith is positive faith needs no booster faith knows what it's talking about faith is strong faith has hairs on his chest it speaks and the rest of them shut up symptoms can't even speak at all when real godly faith speaks it's got the floor I know where it's at it's had an experience but you know there's something about faith doesn't know any fear and faith is calling you you don't consider any fear any doubt you just go on God is calling you and I like this how the Prophet put this because when when when faith is standing before God's Word something's bound to have to us right because God's Word as a seed is supposed to produce after its own kind and if God says that by His stripes we are healed out of the out of our own confession God is bound to move right because a God honors faith now with faith it has its associated with the right mental attitude right because you can you can misrepresent hope with faith now there's a difference between having hope and faith when you have faith you use the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so with faith is the fact that though what you're believing for is already accomplished what you're believing for is already done if you if you're wanting something from God it's the very fact that what you're wanting from God you already have it right now a perfect a perfect way to put this is the Bible says everything was crew everything we see was created by things not seen but it was by faith that the world was created right and the reason why we can believe that is because by faith and it's the same faith that can allow us to believe in something we don't have now the right mental attitude I'm gonna take this out of the message the hour is come the Prophet says the right mental attitude all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude you right meant your right mental attitude towards God's divine promises will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart now that's something you see though that's the right mental attitude even though your faith is weak what's coming out of your mouth even though your faith is weak what is your actions like even if your faith is weak what kind of atmosphere are you setting because the right mental attitude has everything to do with God with with with with the result of the situation that you're in so God honors faith and and in faith though it's to believe but you're right mental attitude about it will bring the word to pass and the Prophet says he said if if you don't have if your faith this week he says I wouldn't confess it don't let the devil know I always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart don't testify nothing of the devil and when you accept them as your healer don't never act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over it's all then it's all over on God then and it's not on you as long as you take God at His Word then the word will produce what it promised to do is that right now you have faith to believe him with all your heart and while reading this it kind of strike me it kind of strike me because there's so many things that that that can take up our attention whether it's we whether it's just things that we are listening to or things that we're watching and just just this little thought just came to me and it was it's time to put the world on mute you see it's trying to put the world on mute and and put the word on live because when the once you put something on mute it's characterized by spite by absence of sound something you don't even see something you're only here and I was reminded of what on what the Prophet went to a store and they were playing music and he was so in tune in such a channel he didn't even hear what was being played right so what would that be said I want to say put your symptoms on mute if you have a sickness put that on mute if you have a trial going on right now put that on mute and turn the word on turn the word on and turn your attention to God's promises right put your defeat on you and walk in the victory that God has promised to you and I want to continue to say here the Prophet goes on the same message the sin of unbelief no I'm sorry I just read that I want to turn the attention to another story here it's in Daniel chapter 3 starting at the 15th verse want to read about story of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego it says here starting at the 15th verse now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery or the dulcimer and all kinds of music you thought you fall down and worship the image which I might have well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of that hand O king but if not be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve that gods not nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up now anybody want to tell the devil be it known unto thee now I like this because many times the devil comes in different ways and if you're not careful you'll find yourself subjecting to the devil without even knowing it right and sometimes it's all a matter of fear doubt right maybe worried right worrying is subjecting yourself to the enemy's trap and if we're not careful we'll put God's promises to the side and say I'll just come back to it later when really in the way that that that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right they had in the surance not only an assurance but a decision a decision that if God didn't show what they knew that they would find more pleasures with God than the pleasures of anything that would conquer would be contrary to God and I'm gonna continue reading here it says but but if not be it known unto thee O king that we will serve we were served that we were not served by God's nor worship the golden image which thou has set up then was never Knesset full of furry and the form of his visit was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more then it would then it was wont to be heated and he commanded the most mighty man that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast him into the burning fiery furnace and that didn't that servant the fact that the fire was heated seven times more was was nothing why because it was a God that that had already placed something greater in Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right the scripture says greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world and I and and the prophet said something imagine the devil trying to burn a holy ghost out of a man that's just not possible why because the Holy Ghost itself is what burns a man within right it's what burns our desperation it's what burns within us the joy the salvation and I want to continue here and the 23rd verse I'll pick up it says now after they the the three Hebrew boy the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego after they went into the fiery furnace the scripture says that never kanessa the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto the counselors did not we cast three men bound until the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king trullo King he answered and said lo I see four loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God you see it goes on to say then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego ye servants of the Most High come forth and come hither then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the myths of the fire and the princes governors and captains and the Kings counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the counselors the fire had no power nor was in hair of their heads singe neither will their cloaks change nor the smell of fire had passed on them now they they went through all of this and yet they were not affected not even a little bit and I can say this much that the their faith and God allowed them to overcome the symptoms or their faith in God allowed them to see beyond the fire right because at the point of death you realize that death is only a vehicle and oftentimes death is what what comes with many fear before us wince wind when it's sickness death is right there standing out the door right and when you see death and you're face to face with death you realize that there's only a vehicle death is only what draws you closer to God why because we also have to die to ourselves and the Prophet says and our and the message the hour has come he says now that's what the devil tries to do all the time burn you up on something makes you sicker when you're praised for make you think you've lost your experience with God he's lying to you the time comes when you have to stand on God's Word stand alone but when that time comes stand there there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith that's the time it is tonight and I believe Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had to separate their feelings base with their faith right because their faith was connected to God now we don't serve God out of feelings we serve God by faith why because we can't please God outside of faith and the time also came not only for them to separate their feelings in their faith but they had to seal their faith and theirs they sealed they were able to seal their faith with their testimony and that's what happens you seal your faith with the testimony and God comes immediately and he's the one that seals it now I want to continue here the Prophet says he says could you imagine burning the Holy Ghost out of a man can't be done notice I can't I can see the king himself upon a throne the hour time came they bound these Hebrew children book them in the front of the spear and started walking up a platform that they were to fall into a great furnace I can hear Shadrach say to me Shaq say you sure you pray through sometimes when Satan puts the heat on we have to stop and check up Lord do I truly believe you I hear Shadrach say yes it's all prayed up now the guards say you want to take that back boy there were a time of decision he says no willing to seal our testimony with our own life we're ready now I can hear King never kissed King Nebuchadnezzar say now if you'll bow down to this image I'll take it back no we've took our way what the Lord despised phew I'm going through with it the time was for decisions just a few minutes left I can hear him say alright walk them up now that heat began to get a little bad don't worry if you accept him tonight as your healer saying we'll put the heat on tomorrow don't you worry about that now I'm gonna say the same thing the very minute that we take the stand for God's Word that he turns up the very minute we take a step towards God promises the he turns up and when the heat turns up it's like whenever whenever that whatever the devil is set loose God always sets his angels Luc's whenever all hell is set loose all heaven is set loose and many times when we take that stand of faith to acknowledge God in the midst of the trial God Himself becomes that fourth man in the midst of our trial he becomes the very son of God in our very trial profit goes on to say here he says I see coming to his right hand a great angel his name Gabriel great at great Archangel he comes running he comes running up pulls his swore he said master you have looked down at babbling your peoples taking a stand for you down there the hour has come for them to stand and they're taking a stand but that bunch of people there is going to push them into the fiery furnace let me go down there I'll clean that thing up I believe he could have done it yes sir he said he will give his angels charge over those and I believe the angels of God are encamping about those who fear Him I can hear Gabriel say I go down there and strike babbling off the map if you let me go down there have you considered them I can hear the master say yes Gabriel you're a wonderful angel you've obeyed me and set at my right hand ever since the day I created you but I can't let you go just can't let you go and I'm gonna fast forward the Prophet goes on to say oh he goes on to say in paragraph 26 have you considered them yes all night long I've been watching them brother his eyes is on the sparrow I know he watches me he's watching you he's seeing how much faith you got how much you got he wants to see what kind of stand you'll take the hour has come what are you going to do he said I've watched him all night I've heard every prayer they pray your angels have been good angels but I can't let you go for I am going myself God comes to the scene himself and many tar God is waiting for us to act he's waiting for us he waiting to see what we're going to do what kind of actions is going to come out of the trial or test that's being put upon us many times the test is meant to prove what's already been placed in us and God has confidence in you tonight that whatever situation you're facing you're gonna be you're only going to be proven to be a manifestation of God's Word because God's Word says the sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God and I believe tonight that if you're led by the Spirit of God then victory is leading you healing is leading you whatever it is that you need God has already have it for you now I believe God has already made the deposit and when God makes the deposit it's your responsibility to cash it right if he's made a deposit for your healing then you have to cash that check if he's made a deposit for your deliverance or for your victory you've got to be able to cash that check now I'm gonna take this out of message whatever he says to do do it paragraph 11 this is 1953 0 6 or 1 it says now perfect faith just like perfect love cast out all fear all doubting if you believe it no matter what the symptoms are or what the results you believe it's just the same do you ever have something you just knew was going to happen no matter what it looked it looked like it was not going to happen but it's going to happen anyhow because you believe it that way now when Jesus says anything his word is a seed and every word would bring forth after his kind if it's a seed of promise for your salvation it'll work for salvation if it's for healing it'll work for healing if it's for joy peace anything that you have need of all the reduce all the redemptive blessings is in Christ and he's setting tonight as a high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of majesty and heaven to make intercession upon your confession now your confession gives God permission to move when you can confess God's Word now you allow God to move upon your situation and faith when you can have faith in the mists of your situation now you're giving God the authority to take control and faith knows no defeat because faith is perfect right faith brings things that when there are no things to be brought faith creates so whatever you're in need of you actually have the authority to create out of the faith you have in God now we've been redeemed to a promise and we the promise we've been redeemed to is the promise of this time prophet says then it is a fact that God's Word is eternal and the very world that were sitting upon tonight is nothing more than the Word of God materialized he spoke the word and said let there be and the world came into existence all things that you see was made by faith in the spoken word of God God said let there be and he believed in his own word well after Redemption a taste of God in our souls and hearts how much more are we to base our faith on the God on what God give us the promise for and sent Jesus to die to redeem us to that promise now what promise I believe he redeemed us to the promise of his word right the word itself was promised to his to us and we are that word scripture says if we abide in him and his word abiding us we can ask whatever we will and I believe that places us as as as as heirs with Christ to ask and the word that that we are that we are carrying the word seed we have the rights to ask according to God's will and I believe God will fulfill it now we are the very word because before the word was a word we were already on his thoughts and we were there before the word came a word and the beautiful thing about that is that God has made us a promise that the word itself will bring forth after its own kind and if the bride has at the brightest supposed to bring forth after its own kind we are producing the very word of Christ and the very word is as a person of Christ right now in the message the perfect faith the Prophet says in paragraph 213 he says this is coming into that third pole I'm believing it I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see it's a kind of race faith and a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith build it up here and watch perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which is sharper than to any two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith looking for it it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen and I believe we're gonna make it by the grace of God because it requires a perfect faith and having the right mental attitude will provide will grant us that perfect faith having the right mental attitude will allow us to know that God has an expectation of us his expectation is that his word is going to carry us through no matter what the situation is his word has already given us the right and we've already been the place to confess what his word has already done and I believe as we near the rapture doubted waiting for our faith to be perfected and what's going to perfect our faith is a perfect word a perfect or perfect Christ a perfect God a perfect promise and as an encouragement is whatever you're going through tonight know that every step that you take that was right under your feet know that every step you take you've already stepped all over what the devil has put in your way God has already made a way and if God has said it then you have the right to receive it because it sent His Word and if it's in his word then God is waiting for your faith to believe it god bless you have a quick with a prayer dear Heavenly Father loyal God we thank you for a perfect word we thank you Father for a perfect faith Lord God we know at this time it's going to take a perfect faith for a perfect rapture Lord God you see all that we have lead up tonight Lord God would thank you for the faith that you've given us Lord to believe in your word a perfect word father that we can walk and take authority and take positions Lord that father we can know every step that we take Lord with step in steps of victory we're taking steps of healing why because you promised it Lord and father god help us to to know who we are Lord that God whatever the devil would come in our direction with your Lord God just like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego father even if Lord God will know they will not serve or bow down but that God would continue Lord and the fight of faith father God just like Paul says we fought a good fight we've kept the faith the Lord God that's what we want our testimony to be doing that God we kept the faith Lord we contended Lord God for the faith father God may you continue to anoint our faith Lord perfect it god no we thank you for that you was able to do tonight father and Lord as we would continue our weekend Lord God when you prepare for Sunday father Lord may we continue to be an expectation Lord that father we have faith Lord to believe that Lord we would give you the permission Lord God with every confession that we make on confess the right things by having the right mental attitude Lord Astor would annoy I didn't know that even now fine though we commit all things into your hands in Jesus name [Applause] [Music] maybe let's get along pretty low amen which is in themself out of the way just a beautiful a
