and more praise the Lord God is good babe man y'all can be seated just for a moment just so good to be here in the house of God man I know some y'all little war out from the event on yesterday but we thank God for brother Troy sister time you renewing their their wedding vows 30 years marriage is a long time and man we were certainly grateful for how good god has been a man demonstrated himself to them and I'm sure that they also appreciate everybody's support and just being there does everybody get me and where they fit in and just doing what you could just to make their celebration a man that that much more special so we certainly appreciate that and I always think that when we have opportunity to to just gather together and moments like that there's a great there's a it's a great opportunity for those that have maybe walked away from the faith or maybe just in a moping period but when they when they get into familiar places it's just something that the Spirit of God begins to move and folk just begin and miss old times and you know we were just there when the sisters we got to sing a little song and a man and the sister ran up to me and she say yeah she says Kui we don't get this too often so could we do it again could we do it again do another song do another song I said well we'll we'll do the best we can but I'm like we do this every Sunday [Music] if you want some you know way to get some but we we just love the Lord and you know just gives you an opportunity to also remember people in prayer you know and but we just were just just very very grateful just to see everybody a man somebody hadn't seen in a good while that was just so good to see him in and just give him a nice big hug and stop bless you in man and ain't nothin but love over here you know and you know you just you just you just appreciate that but we're very grateful brother Daniel man so good to see you we were texting and he said I'll be a bee home I be in West Palm Beach and I said that intentionally could be home she's got the be into but they said he said I'll be there in West Palm and it gave me the date so I'm like okay all right landed be good to see brother thank you for Christmas you know and then come to find out brother Danny was making a special trip down here to be a part a man a brother Troy such a tiny event and it coming all the way from Connecticut all the way down and you know we we were great very grateful he certainly got him where he fed in and and just made up made a world of a difference there and now but daniel has eight more months he'd given leave here and go to North Carolina and he'll be there for about eight months and y'all keep them in prayer cuz he after that he only got to serve no mold then he can find a place where he can settle down and he can come home so y'all keep them in prayer oh it was certainly a L Amen looking forward to that and just just just just just just all that God's doing brother Caleb we appreciate that testimony a man of what the Lord is it's doing for him and and I was just telling him just make God decisions not not good decisions God decisions but God firsts see you put God first and god bless his dad right and the devil Gumby never challenged it alright because everything that you do you got both Satan and God Amen right there but we love what the Lord has done all the people that told him that it couldn't and I see God elevates him a modern-day Joseph we're very grateful for that a man hallelujah you see Joseph had to keep his testimony before he could get elevated man sometimes sometimes you're going through trials to see if you're gonna maintain your testimony in the midst of what you're going through but God already know what he want to bring you a man you know I'm just I'm just looking around the church and man that y'all bless me bless [Music] watch let's do some you know some things and and it's just some of the things that he's doing those that he's opening ways that he's making only God could do with Ryan only God could do with him and we never wanna forget to take time and to begin to thank him for so this Friday night we having a Thanksgiving service but y'all need to think on something that God done for y'all this year y'all need to come to church on Friday night and give God praise for amen this morning brother Stephen read the script rather Isaiah 12 and in our prayer time and and it said in verse 4 I was there 12 it says and in that day shall ye say praise the Lord call upon his name and I like this declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he have done what well in my Bible say excellent things he has done excellent things this is known in all the earth and now so Friday night is a time when we gon come and and we gonna open the mic and we want people to come and just just give God praise you know just think of something special that you want to share that God did for you this year and I don't care if you shared it before it's worth hearing again right but if God has done something for you not everybody here we gonna give you an opportunity to share you can't say I think if you can only say I thank God for having breath my body that's enough to give them praise for but we want to make known is with his feelings his deeds a man and we're you know just before we go into the next year we want to just remember what he's done for us this year and you all know that we'll be having the combined service with brother smiley a man and the church there and Okeechobee they'll be coming over on New Year's Eve night for the smile of a preaching force and we're certainly looking forward to that and man that service will start at 9:30 New Year's Eve night and we'll go right into the New Year just worshipping and praising God so and then everybody's welcome a man after 210 so man I saw Tosh a man and I didn't just see Tosh I saw Tosh man you look good god bless you and

sister Sylvia Marie god bless you're so good to have you with us a man and and I think sister Sylvia come before but I wasn't here to get a chance to meet her but I'm so glad she came back and a man just to be in fellowship with her some today good to have brother brother kidding it's just the lower back they were away a man there and New Jersey and I'm just gonna keep him in the family in prayer amen and the loss of their loved one but so good to have them back a man praise the Lord all right musicians thank y'all so much all the specials that went for thank you all amen I appreciate every song man I certainly appreciate that and I want to read a couple scriptures here today we want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas a man and Jesus is certainly the reason for the season a man and and and we want to always put the emphasis on him so just pray for us this morning we want to read from two passages of Scripture Isaiah chapter 7 and then also John chapter 1 praise the Lord here in Isaiah 7 and verse 10 it says moreover the Lord speak again unto a half sing Asti a sign of the Lord like God ask it either in depth or in the height above but it has an eye but he has said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said here you now o house of David is it a small thing for you to weary men but will you weary my God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign since you won't ask for one imma give you one right the Lord himself shall give you a sign the whole a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel a man let's stop turn over here to John chapter 1 thank the Lord for brother Jean you know last week I got a chance to hear its sermon and you know at church just really appreciate the Lord just using him just the way he gets into the story and just makes it live for everybody he's got a very very unique gift and man we thank God for that John one here just a few verses a man I'll go 1 through 5 and then I'll do verse 14 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine a--the and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not alright and skip to verse 14 it says this lecture let me go to verse 10 says he he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not I noticed he was in the world the world was made by him Amen if the world was made by him because we know in the back of the Bible say the beginning God created the heavens and the earth if the Bible say that and then we read over here John 1 that the world was me by him they then Jesus and God must be the same person that this would the Bible see a man so he says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not a man what the world still don't know him the day you know they think this thing about Santa Claus a man Santa's a myth Jesus is real listen he came into his own and his own received or not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray father we thank you for the privilege and to read Scripture but God we we pray that the Holy Ghost would help us to understand what it is that we're reading make it clear God give us revelation of your word today we take every spirit that's against your spirit underneath the control of the Holy Spirit even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated we want to use for our topic today and the word was made flesh a man the word was made flesh just I'll start off by reading a little bit here and then we'll just see how the Lord will just take us I want to read from this sermon servers we would see Jesus and just a title alone a man I should draw attention because we we're living in a season where people don't have their eyes on Christ any more when it comes to Christmas a man and and and just you know so that we're clear about this I I want for one I do not believe Jesus was born on December 25th a man I don't believe that actually it the scripture does not support that in any way it's it came from pagan teachings that has actually infiltrated Christianity and and we you know we've we've we've we've adopted it you know even though I don't believe it you know I'm not depriving people their gifts and all of that you know and it certainly you know look forward to getting gifts and all that but we like to keep the truth make the truth the truth it's got nothing to do with Santa Claus and has got nothing to do with Jesus been born but I am glad that most of the world is force at least once per year to have to acknowledge Jesus well I'm glad about that sec when you as a Christian for us we acknowledge him every day so Christmas is not a man you know when we only time we celebrate his birth right we celebrated all the time as Christians every day is Christmas to me hallelujah for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son whosoever would believe in him would have eternal life right so I celebrated all the time I don't have to wait to December 25th glory to God I open my present every day I open it every day and I enjoy his presence all right hallelujah somebody right but you know we thank the Lord you know for for the world haven't acknowledged it but even in our world today they come to a spot where they've int they put Santa Claus in Jesus place and they've done a lot of other things amen but we as Christians we want to put the focus where it belongs it's on our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and hopefully today we can we can really share what this is really all about the Word was made flesh that's what we're celebrating the Word was made flesh now I want to read here out of store as we would see Jesus says now it not not if you not if you go to the cradles say little baby was born here long years ago nonsense says all kinds of Creed's and fables told about it we know Jesus no at all all that thing would perish and get all mixed up but there's one thing is it mixed up that's the Holy Spirit and I like to say there's one thing that isn't mixed up and that is the Holy Spirit I meant paragraph 31 1 and sirs we would see Jesus and he said said one thing isn't mixed up so a lot of other stuff that's been mixed up but one thing that isn't mixed up that's the Holy Spirit and it goes on says says oh one of them say he was born right there right here we got a church built over it other one said he was born over here you know how many nails they got can prove it original nails that was in the cross 19 each fella holding a nail night that is visa there's 19 people claiming that they got a nail at the cross that it was only for my understanding three nails in the cross but 19 people claiming they got a nail that's true that there's a problem somewhere now and let me just finish reading this i'ma break into a little something here says you know how many nails that God can prove it original nails that was in the cross now they say they can prove it 19 each fella holding the nail this we got it hallelujah we got it they just got some dead bones and say we got it we got it this is the place he was born and others say this is the place he was born in they say this is the place she was born what difference does it make here here's where he was born in the heart glory to God hallelujah I like that church so we thought we not relaxing you know going to Amen Israel just to try to find the place where he was born let me I got a break into this just just give me a second you know I was I was there you know and we went to the place they call it the Church of the Nativity and when you walk into this places you know a Bethlehem and and and and and when you when we were kind of approaching this place is a you know you had to be a little bit more aware of where you were there was a lot of activity that was going on around here and when you walk in this Church of the Nativity there is actually like three congregations meeting in the same search and and each congregation is claiming a certain area as to where the way the birth actually took place and as we were you know what what you got is the Greek Orthodox they claim a certain part of it the Catholics claim a certain part of it and then I call them they called themselves the armenian apostolic right so all of these all of these groups are in one church having three different services surrounding the place where Jesus was born and then as I was going through the church we got in and man there's a line that was wrapped I mean so long I'm like wow I say if we gotta stand in that line to see where Jesus was born I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it I mean and you just took the line of people for I was just just waiting just to get a glimpse of where Jesus was born and they didn't realize Jesus was actually born then the man that was walking right by them he was born in my heart I was carrying Jesus they miss him Dean and they still missing him now hallelujah right but you know if I hear here you know we we lick it and I say man I said nah I'm not to come a long way but I came standing that line just to kind of see where Jesus was born right and that's tough so you know the brothers say well the good thing about is that you know these people you know they're very committed to their faith and they come here from all over the world just to counter see this little spots it but if we go down on the other side over here the line gonna be a lot shorter right because they claim that you know this is also the spot when he was born and this one claim that this was the spot he was born where when you go to the other side they take you down these stairs and up you know some of the spot him and when we get in there you walk back into the area and saying I looked through the peephole in the door and we looked through the peephole and go that's the place that Jesus was born so I'm walking back there what everybody looking at can't look through the people sit man out see you know I don't want to criticize it but you know I don't really see much because we realized that that's not really where he was born when he was born is in your heart glory to God amen everybody want to go back to a manger right but where he wants to go is in your hearts that's where he wants to be born in your heart not and then you know the manger you know that was just part of the story amen but the ultimate place that he wanted to take a person he was in the alternate place where he want to be born is inside of you and he wants your flesh to become the words oh my the word will become flesh all right all right stay with me here he goes on to say this it says well what's the matter he got lost again people's lost him that's right but he's been lost again in the big crowds the crowds have creeds you remember one time he got lost to his parents he's lost again and I want you to just get that it says he's lost again he got lost go to on these streets like like it's been the last few days look at the matte crowds pushing and shoving and drinking and cursing and damli and you know and and it you know what what the Prophet is saying here the traffic get worse people get they got less patients on the road I was I was on the highway this week and I was just trying to just get into a lane and then I saw I saw a little opening so I say nobody gonna let me you can put your blink on all you want to ain't nobody just gonna lift you into the landing people mind that then I lost in mind a lot of times I said I just wanted to get on 95 can I just get in that Lane so here you know this man he's sitting there looking at her cell phone got his head down and I saw him with that I said I'm gonna take this womb I got in so I got in it he realized that I got in front of his head was still down I don't Rove almost a mile well not that long I'm exaggerating but I don't throw backup of cloudlets in front of him and that may have realized I got it from him he was upset he start blowing that horn on me and I and then he started looking at he wasn't even driving them off just looking at me like he like he but don't take my head off I'm all in the name of Christmas Jesus has lost the game we got we got we got we got to bring an attention back to him a focus back on Christ hallelujah but look at this says well you know he says go down these streets like it's been the last few days look at look at the mat crowds pushing and shoving and drinking and cursing and damning jingle bells jingle bells Christ is lost he says he ain't lost the peoples lost him where did they find him where they lost him at that's where we'll find him but he's lost in kreason in the crowds he's the loss Christ is lost in the commercial crowd the commercial crowd saying we got to celebrate Christmas the latest said the other day seven here then went wife and I was done here since I brought brought my dad a quart of whiskey you know other than over said I'm gonna get I'll tell you what I'm gonna get dad I'm gonna get him some cars and some chips we'll play strip poker now you're doing all this to celebrate Christ I want you to think about it oh lord have mercy let me just keep going you know I'm a going in this you do our gifts even on a Christ do the gifts honor Christ the list that you had the kids right now does it honor Christ just think about it right and then when we really really just begin to put the focus back goal in it right it's not about all of that church right and and I pray I pray and hope ain't nobody got no debt you know over this if you ain't have it you just don't have it it's okay it really is just okay and if somebody making you feel that kind of pressure bring them to my office let me talk to him for a little bit because that's not what it's supposed to happen a man you young people you know when y'all getting married John starts our families don't going down over Christmas you can't find that in the Bible where people went in debt when Jesus was born I'm going on I'm going on I don't don't don't know shot me down yet don't shout me down yet I'm going on but he says he says this he says I'm gonna get some cars and some chips we'll play strip poker you see celebrate Christmas other said I got a carton cigarettes for mom would you get her oh god he's lost they lost him in Christmas they lost him in Easter bunny rabbit or a new hat not the resurrection not the birth of Christ they lost him in the crease when they made three gods out of him chop them into pieces and made an idol instead of knowing who he is I and my father are one you lost him I'm going on he's lost in the religious crowd how the religious crowd he's lost to his church in the Laodicean the last church age which we're living in that right now it's saying he was on the outside of the church knocking trying to get in the most pathetic sight in all the Bible is the condition of the church in the last days before Jesus comes before he comes just said not another church age ever put them out they didn't know any difference now when they really know the true power of the Holy Ghost they kicked him out of the place on the outside knocking at the door behold I stand at the door and knock now when you get a glimpse of that a man you go back and read that in Revelation 3 you get a glimpse of that you can see that where we live in that today is exactly where they were living at when there was no room in the end there was no room in the end nobody wanted I mean you know while I was there in Israel the that this is one gentleman I think he was a Muslim and he was trying to because the Muslims own Bethlehem and he's trying to say you know the Bible try to say that we did Jesus wrong by not having a room in the end he said but the Bible say something he quoted something and when he quoted I said and all of the Bible don't say that you know he's like he's like no there was no room in the end that night that they made it like what the violence a lot about that night that they thought it was no room in the end he was born in a manger right this is where he was born say that except not now now I don't know what Baba y'all reading but I Bible tell us that he was born and he was in a manger in a stable at hey he was born amongst animals now now now now now I think that's appropriate because our our Savior also has the title Lamb of God so as the Lamb of God he would have been born just like other lambs are born and the reason that we say he wasn't born a man at on December deep summer 25th the day that they trying to say the reason we said it because it's cold and and there would be no scheppers in they feel watching Fox at that time of year right here if he's the Lamb of God he would have been born at the same time other lambs are born which would have been the springtime hallelujah so this is what this is this is what it's all about and when we look at it you know when we really take a look at this it was the word being made flesh we look at this scripture a man that we're ant here in the beginning was the word lorry to God a man just stay with me here for a little bit I want to I want to line something up yes Lord yes Lord amen in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now now if we were to go to a man a Greek Bible we would see that that's that's spoken up a little differently and it would say in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God now this this one scripture has generated a lot of problems in Christianity a man has created a lot of a lot of issues and and unfortunately Christianity now people have three gods and don't realize they got three gods right they have the Father they have the son they have the Holy Ghost they got three different gods that they trying to give us but the but the Bible say that our God is one right and if he's one of them you can't give us a picture of three and then try to you know try to make it all work E if he was one at the beginning he gonna be one of the end and in the book of Revelation when John looked on the throne John say I saw one sitting on the throne that's always gonna be one from Genesis to Revelation it is one so somewhere in between we got lost some Jesus it's lost again so let's descend let's try to work with this right because the Bible say the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word Oh God or in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God when you skip down to verse 14 it was safe and the word was made flesh for the logos was made flesh now I want to say it like that because I want to try to help us understand what happened it wasn't that there were three God's co-equal that's not what we're talking about the word Trinity is not even in the Bible but yet people believe in it but when we look at this all that happen is that the Bible tells us God was a spirit hallelujah see there was a purpose for him being born we you know people that people don't be people actually forgot why he was born why he became flesh the purpose is because we needed a kinsman redeemer after Adam sold us into sin we needed another second Adam to redeem us back to God again so those are purpose for him to come in flesh and it wasn't that God just sent His only Son God became the son I said 12 times that God became the son he became our Savior through the flesh of Jesus Christ oh my god see if there was if he had not done that the penalty would have never been paid it wasn't it wasn't just a you know a you know I mean it would just be totally unjust for God just a cinder son I mean I don't have any boys but if I had a boy if I only had one boy and I and I said a rule and say anybody crossed his line gonna die then you know maybe one of the brothers walked by and cross the line say old man I love you so much I feel so sorry for you I don't want you to die I've never expected that to happen to you so did I get my my son my one and only son say my son I made a law that whoever cross the line would have to die and this brother just crossed a line I feel so sorry for him I don't want him to die son I want you to take his place my son would probably look at me I you know even if I were of that Sun I would look at my daddy said that I didn't do nothing wrong your friend that you feel sorry for and actually think about it you want me to die for your friend that telling me that you love you're free and money you love me I mean God don't think that way right I mean in order for him to be just he wouldn't just have his thumb come and die for his friend no in order for him to be just he becomes the son and he died for the friend this is what happened so so when we say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God Oh hallelujah what happens that as a spirit that spirit gave forth a light that's what the logo sees it's a light right and and so so so when you go back and read Genesis hallelujah and you see where it says let there be light that first light was not sunlight as you in life that was f om light hallelujah it was s om like because the SU in light did not come until the fourth day when he made two great lights one the ruler there one the room life so the first light when he said let there be light would have been s OE light which is what John was trying to tell us in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and where people get stuck is this with God with God with God and I always go back to you can't miss words God if it was with God and was God do we have two different gods no no no no no this is what we call God's plan of redemption in order to redeem us because he knew we'd be lost I'm talked about before Adam's sin I hope you get it before sin entered into the world God already had a plan in motion okay you know it can I just tell you like this before you real she was a sinner Christ had already died for your sin Christ had already made a way for you to be redeemed Christ had already made a way it meant for you to come back into fellowship with God I've talked about before you made the mistake that you made God had already had a plan in place and that plan started way back in the beginning where says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God all that happens that God was going from spirit form to a light and not now how do we know that that's not that that was God how we know how do we know these things how do we know that was God how do we know that light because Jesus is God how we know that how do we know that well Paul was on the road to Damascus and he saw a great light Paul began to talk to the light Paul was talking to a light and as he's talking to the light he asked them I mean they say they say Paul it's hard for you to kick against the print you know you know you don't do this party he just kind of habit comes in say say say who are down Lord that was Paul's question and the light spoke back to Paul I am Jesus that's the same light that was there in the beginning not only was the light with God but the light was caught and that light was made flesh and dwelt among us he couldn't die as a spirit and he couldn't die as a light but that light had to take on a body and they don't realize on December 25th they are honoring a day where that word or that light became Sammy and got nothing to do with that Santa Claus nowhere near that pigs Oh God read with me here I just want to read something super side and I'm gonna go to paragraph 76 in this when we when we when we look at super Sun the scripture that the Prophet would preach from it all was always Isaiah 7 it says the Lord himself shall give you the whole a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel you know it was important that he was he was born virgin birth now Adam did not have the same type of birth that we have Adam was just created Eve was made from Adam right God formed her from front from that rib that he took out Adam sighs so much can be said that y'all know he took the rear by the side he also took the finished spirit hello somebody he took that out of Adam the dog him I'm gonna say that again God took the feminist spirit out of Adam so if we see the feminine spirit in another ham we know something they right cuz God took it out and he gave it to Eve hello so Eve had a feminine spirit and Adam had a masculine spirit so even today has a masculine spirit and Adam has a feminine spirit we got a problem but see because of sin he had to come and die we needed to save you we needed to save you because of sin and and and and um this this great celebratory day this is what we want to draw attention to it was it was God becoming flesh in order to come and die I said we don't just celebrate in his birth but we also celebrate his death and we don't stop there because there's been many great religious leaders that have come and died but what separates Christianity from everybody else is that our leader rose again so let's look at this oh my even even a scripture Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a son behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that that call his name Emmanuel meant God with us that was the whole purpose God God wanted to be with us a man and not only just with us see God at one time it was God above us then with God with us but today it is God in us that's why I say that the words being made flesh all over again is it me been made flesh in you I want you to just bear with me here I want to just just draw draw a couple things in man as we go on this is out of super sign and paragraph 76 says watch God and his ways of work when it created to heaven earth when he created the heavens and earth he called the angels together and he said let us every place in the scripture where he did anything mostly not me but my father but when it comes to the plan of redemption he come alone nobody was with him he was the only one that could come and angel couldn't do it let me just add this Santa Claus couldn't do it the elves couldn't do it rudolph the red-nosed reindeer didn't do it an angel couldn't do it another man called it see that's why I just said notice that another man called his son it couldn't do it so that's why I wondered just another man called the son it was God himself in the Sun another man call this son can do it one calls something else a holy virgin or a holy mother or some saint couldn't do it God had to come he says now give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and a baby will be born and he will be Immanuel God with us a super Sun God and his people got witness people got become his people God and man became one a sign a stumbling block to the world but a blessed hope for for the believer a sign that would be evil spoken of now go back to the front of that quote I need to go back to write to the beginning of that quote notice this watch God and His ways of work when he created the heavens and earth he called the angels together do you like that that's why I had to stop I don't think everybody caught it that's why I just I'm a slow down 3-1 listen watch go and his ways of work when he created the heavens and earth he called the angels together and he said let us because people got it look confusing you know they look at well if Jesus was the logos and he was like than what he did it was God in Jesus at the beginning that said let us know the logos was God the logos was God so so when you said well who was that when God said let us we just found the answer God call the angels together and he says let us make man in our image that means angels then would have to be in the image of man you mean no wings some of them do terrible ooh Seraphim have wings but there are some others men oh I can't give it away if you want I just gave you a UH this is a key that will unlock some ghosts when God said let us make man it was him talking with angels because angels were already in the image of men all right okay Genesis 32 and 24 now I'm skipping one scripture here but when Abraham in Genesis 17 saw three angels they were men that had come down it was God and two other angels before those angels went down into Sodom Gomorrah hello them fellows in Sodom and Gomorrah they were lusting after men not-not-not fellows with wings on them men men so those angels look like men not only that they talk like men they could sit and eat like men God all right listen approve it by the scripture Genesis 32 24 let me just get this in my Bible I'm telling y'all to get any our Bible but let me let me get this 32:24 says in Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day now some of us say you know and it's you know you go to different Bibles and you know we got all of these different study tools that we used we used so many different static tools to try to understand the Word of God I realized that but if you just used the profit it would just really help out it would really help out just use God's profit that's the study tool use the table the table but there's people that would say well when it said that he rests with a man then that was Jesus there's others ever said well that was an angel and they they people just divided on all kind of stuff well let's let the Bible prove it turn with me to hosea chapter 12 verse 4 because when I'm proven to you now is that man I mean angels can look like men because they said let us make man in our image so angels can look like men Hosea 12 for glory to God it's talking about the story of Jacob here says yeah he had power over the angel glory to God when I just ran in Genesis 32 24 says Jacob was left alone and there he wrestled a man but here in hosea 12 48 he had power over the angel and he and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in Bethel and there he spake with us so here we got clear proof that Jacob was wrestling with a man who was an angel let's give people a little bit more that might not be enough Daniel 92118 92119 92120 will come talk to him that angel had a name his name was Gabriel and in Daniel 9 21 it says this yeh while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening so here we got Gabriel being a man very easy for when God to say let us make man in our own image for angels to be man hallelujah I got another one judges 13 you know the Bible say in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established so judges 13 here's another one Oh glory glory glory glory glory glory all right judge is 13 amen and I'm gonna you know hearing it in this particular passage we could we could read the whole thing yeah let's just read this I think y'all that y'all enjoy verse 1 this is the birth of Samson okay look and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of Danites whose name was Manoah and his wife was barren and bare 9 and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and embarrassed not but thou shall conceive and bear son so she's getting a visitation from an angel now look at this now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing drink not wine nor strong drink did I read that drink not wine nor strong drink something I can say that was with Sampson that's for you to Alleluia I know Jesus turned water into wine but you can't find where he drunk it a man the Nazarites didn't drink wine that's why all right listen there's now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shalt conceive and bear some and no razor shall come on with it now you know can I just just you know back back here you know they're telling this woman's gonna be pregnant don't drink wine don't drink wine now that was just something small back in that time I mean you know from my understanding they really didn't have too many other things a drink you got coke and sprite and then kool-aid and you know sweet tea and all kind of stuff that you drink nowadays but back then was either water sometime the water some contaminate they could not drink anything else so they had wine they fermented from grapes right so you know back in that time so here that the angel telling her not to drink wine but you know if we would just stay with that principle we wouldn't have some of the problems that we got today oh Lord so my kids were not suffer if we were to stay with these principles our kids went suffer because it's tough that enters the mother's body while the child is pregnant that creates some of the problems for the children a man I'll just read listen to a story the other day you know that this this this woman she's pregnant and just addicted to drugs absolutely addicted just could not let them go and want somebody to adopt a child and you know this police officer decided to take the child and adopt it but when they got the child man that child is having all kind of withdrawal symptoms from the drugs and and like and they were the household they didn't do drugs like what are we gonna do this child that child would have never had that happened to it and the mama not been doing what the mom was doing if we just take with basic principles we wouldn't have some of the problems that we got today drink not wine nostro drink no certainly not smoking cigarettes certainly not you know doing drugs none of that should be happening I'm not talk about when you're pregnant even when you're not pregnant oh I know you turn 21 that don't mean nothing I don't mean nothing the Bible still say don't do it even though the law may allow you to do it the Bible say don't do it hallelujah well that devil got loose and be be that they need something I can get me a drink that devil you're in and make a less out of you and one day when we see you on the street no place to live and we want to say is that the same girl yeah that's the same way and brother branham had one she was a Deaconess daughter in the house of God and say you know sister I feel like the Lord telling me that once you give your heart to the Lord tonight she got upset you know I have people come to church people get mad at the preacher boy I'm mad ma D got a hard heart and the heart got hard she decided she she you know she said I'm gonna talk to that preacher after service she came around the corner and beelining towards them don't you ever call me out like that again I have you to know I'm so in Souls daughter and you ain't gonna talk to me like that okay I'm just doing what I felt the Lord telling me to do to call you you know up because he was dealing with your heart no don't ever embarrass me like that okay right a year later pass back through the city here come that girl along walking down the street not in church this time walking down the street and say hey preach hey hey preach yes how about a cigar a cigarette they say a cigarette you offering a preacher that say yeah you know what about something to drink preacher you often a preacher that what's the matter with you they say uh you know she saying look out he said he say just say you know I'm so bad off I'm so bad off that you know what right now if I saw my own mama's soul frying in Hell like a pancake I would sit and laugh at it he said just say you say preach I'm gonna take you the truth that night that you called me out God was dealing with me but she rejected it for the last time and her heart became hard never to hear the gospel again listen for though thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor should come on his head but the child should be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God then noticed this there's the age of the Lord but she's saying a man of God all right the woman came and told her husband said a man of God came unto me and his counsels was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not when she was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear son and and and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death and I know some of y'all might say well you're dealing with the drink of what about unclean things don't eat that either and there's a lot of stuff that you shouldn't be they can actually prove you some of the stuff that you do eat it's what causes some of the diseases in your body a man prays alone lower to God I don't think when we get to the other side we'll be killing animals to eat them it won't be that way amen so if you want to go on a diet like that that's fine I'm not no but I eat meat because God eat meat yeah yeah y'all never read that that's destiny when he when he step with Abraham that was God eating meat that's why I eat meat God eat me fish he ate meat prays alone ain't no but if you want to do something that's fine glory to God all right we can bring we can if you want to have that conversation we can a man but just understand that everything I pray for is bless the Bible say dad's all right come on y'all I'm going on I'm talk about the word with me flesh and it says but he said it behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and and and now drink no wine or strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child should be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death then monoi entreated the Lord and said oh my lord let the man of God which thou didst sin come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child unto the child that shall be born and God hearkened to the voice of manure and the angel of God came again unto the woman and she said in the field but minora husband was not with her and the woman made haste I ran and showed her husband and said unto him behold the man I'm just tryin to prove to you that an angel can be a minyan so when God says let us make man and he's talking to their angels that angels work man hallelujah listen listen I'm at verse 10 says and the woman made haste and ran and showed her husband and said in him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day and my know arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him aren't thou the man that speaketh unto the woman and he said I am and my noah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him and the angel Lord look at what he said the angel the Lord said in the know of all that I said and the woman let her be where I just want to stop there I I wanted to try to get us to understand see when we're bringing the word was made flesh there's when you start going back into some of this especially those that believe in three gods they say they don't believe in three guys but when they got to gods standing at the beginning you believe in three gods right I'm trying to get it it's only one God as a spirit brother branham said he gave birth to himself he became a light because as a spirit people can identify him but as a light they could identify his presence but he see he went on beyond that and when hallelujah when he finally took on flesh that was God going from that light form into a body form the word itself became flesh and there was the purpose for that because we needed to be redeemed and God then just sent his son God became the sign so he could redeem us that's what Christmas is really all about can I just I'm just I'm gonna cut this off a man I get I got I got more but imma cut it off I just love him I like to talk about him at Christmastime I like to talk about him there's give me a few more minutes he and I'll leave glory to God but there's another statement that I want you to understand that you know this word was constantly anytime God made a promise God was setting it up because that word that promise was gonna be made flesh now when he told Abraham that he was going to have a promise son and when Isaac was born the word was made flesh hallelujah there was a time where they they got away from God again they needed a new king to come on the scene and they prophesied about Josiah being born and when Josiah was born guess what the word itself was being made flesh amen the same thing it was with with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you know there was certain promises that were there all the way back from the book of genesis 3:15 I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed so bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel way back then God was speaking of the virgin birth because a woman does not carry a see if the woman carries the egg hallelujah so way back in the book of Genesis after the first sin God was had already made away and we had the wait years before that was manifested but Christmas is when that word or that promise was made flesh oh my God my God my God there are so many other scriptures that were you know that were written concerning our Lord and Savior coming in the prophecies all throughout the Old Testament but uh you know one of the other scriptures that I that I love to read is Isaiah 9:6 that was prophesied about that word becoming flesh and there not just when it became flesh and dwelt among us there was gonna be some other attributes displeased hallelujah some other attributes displayed Amen that that was locked in God that he just could not display Amen and and one of them was when he was when it said to be called Emmanuel that was come out with us now he got some other things that he want to display what it says in Isaiah 9:6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace you know there was a time brother branham's preaching the message service we would see Jesus made a statement says wish I had time I like to take a text on each one of them counseling the Prince of Peace mighty God everlasting father and wonderful and I done did that before I can't do it all today but I do want to tell you he is wonderful honey Amen this Jesus that was born he is certainly wonderful what brother Jack how you know well and I was just listening to a little sermon and brother man say when he stood up and say I am the way the truth and the life that was wonderful he said when he said I am the light of the world that was wonderful when he says I am the first and the last the beginning and the end I'm Alpha Omega everything in between say that was wonderful when he turned water into wine wonderful when he fed 5000 that was wonderful we fed 4000 that also was wonderful when he changed my life wonderful when it saved me from seeing wonderful when he filled me with the Holy Ghost wonderful oh yes he is wonderful it's a he's a counselor you'd go back in the scripture and you look at a couple of things and in one in particular Simon's house when he went to Simon's house Simon and they wouldn't wash his feet you know you supposed to make all your guests feel comfortable see they didn't have no room for him in the end they'd have no room for him in Simon's house and the church and got no room for him in the day but we need with the Simon's house and they just let him come on in with the dirty feet and he just sitting there and with them dirty feet and got his legs behind him and that lady that that that should she was not invited to that party she had a she had a rough life spout a didn't want her Kai at the party but she said I can't let him sit there with them dirty feet I got to do something about it and she went home and got her the little money she had been saving from some ill-fame living and she got I'm running together went down to the shopping and when the shop owner sitting out what what is it that she won't what is he say say get on out of here you know you we don't even stirred your kind but she open her little box and when he saw the money inside the box I said what can I do for you hallelujah people change when they see you money come on somebody but by a saying say what can we do pray say I just want the best pointment that you got and she got that perfume she bought it and she went down there to Jesus and MC and she snuck into the party but by the time she snuck in she ended up right at the place where his feet was right in front of her and she broke down in tears and she began to wipe his feet with her tears and with her styling just say now if he knew what kind of woman that was that was washing history if he really was a prophet then they begin to give some counsel who you think would be more appreciative you know a person that was forgiven little a person that was forgiven much which one you think would be more appreciated instead he say the one that that's forgiven much I think that'll be the one that the most preacher say well stance on so this woman had mini stance but her sins which were many are forgiven that's wonderful that's a wonderful counselor that's a wonderful counselor told her go and sin no more hallelujah it's gonna mighty God you know we was passing through the city as we were driving through Israel and I said that's the city of nain I say name I know Natan because Jesus happened to be passing through the city of nain one day and there was a mama she was already a she had already lost her husband and here she is walking through the city with na burying her boy her only son she's better and she just walked behind the casket crying but you know life and death when they meet something got to happen and from what from what I don't read in the scripture every time life in Jesus is life any time life crosses the path of death death always loses so when it crossed the path of this widow of nain he only did was just woke up and just touch the pyre the Bible said well lift up and begin to talk to his mama because lengthen the carpet that to me was a mighty God he had control over death [Music] that's a mighty God and I just loved this because the Bible could he was the everlasting father and my question is how can a son be an everlasting for her somebody said where he had to have children yeah he do have some children I'm one of him but that's not what Isaiah was talking about he called the son the everlasting father and if this son this baby this word being made flesh if this baby that's being born is the everlasting father what Isaiah is trying to tell us that Jesus was God well jesus said that himself he said it in John 10 verse 30 says I and my father are one he also said in john 14:9 he says when you see me you know I mean they have to say would you just show us show us show us the father show us we want to see him we I mean we were grateful for you but we want to see the father yeah this time sitting out now I've been I've been so long with you just don't know me when you're looking at me you looking at the father Jesus and God were the same Jehovah of the Old Testament it's Jesus of the new he's the Prince of Peace and I'm so glad that he proved that when he walked on water and he come up with him disciples were a little freak the Bible say they were they were scared when you know hey they saw Jesus walking on water and he spoke to me so he says he says be of good cheer it is I be not afraid he spoke peace to this situation and they was peaceful it went from being fearful to peaceful it was so peaceful that Peter himself got out the boat and he start walking on the water he was experiencing the Prince of Peace unfortunate to his eyes off on them and they began to sink a little bit but even in sinking he could call his name and when he come up out that water I think Peter could see he's wonderful he's wonderful why does it say the government should be a punished order what this was it was signifying it was a an Eastern wedding traditions when the bride was surrendering herself to the groom the bride would take her veil and lay it on the shoulder of the groom and when she would lay her shoulder I mean lay that veil on the shoulder of the groom it transferred Authority it showed that she was under his Dominion Oh Lord I know people don't like hearing that anymore we got people nowadays when they get married they don't even want to take the husband's name actually the husband it's taking the wife name I've seen that happen the husband take the wife name that is so completely against the principles of God's Word Christians doing that Christian's going to I'm going to take my wife's name her family name is better than my family name or either you know it's just it's just really messed up but what suppose happened it was it was it was signifying that she was under the authority of her husband hallelujah Amen my thought is that if you can't take his name then you shouldn't marry him you ain't got respect enough to be able to take his name don't marry him praise the Lord listen it says so so where was the transfer of rights to the husband that he was now the head and not only that it was that he was the one that was going to bear the responsibility and the care he alone was gonna bear that so when Jesus when the Bible says that that the government shall be upon his shoulder it means that Jesus alone is the one that bears a responsibility and care for us that's why the government is on his shoulder Church he was wonderful he was a counselor a mighty God everlasting father Prince of Peace he was everything and and and more and I'm so glad that he is my Savior let me finish this off today the deity of Jesus Christ I want you to understand something we're not no I mean I went looking for this little spot that they say Jesus was born that's all very little I couldn't even take a picture of it you know it was that small I couldn't take a picture but I couldn't even get my camera through that little hole to try to take a picture of the show that's that's where Jesus born no when I look at you I can see what Jesus was born because in you the word has become flesh all over again the word has become flesh Oh glory glory glory glory last week we heard a powerful testimony sister uh sister Hannah you know she was she had some some cloth she needed to make something she was short a few yards I think about three yards and I mean a lot of material there's like Lord I need to get this thing done and I don't have the materia and she just praying and and and just not not sure which way to go and and before you know it God just kind of put in her heart you know just to kind of go back and work with that coffin and I don't know if she had the spoke to it or whatever she did somehow that cloth multiplied the cloth multiplied in that sisters hands that's the same God that multiplied fish and Lowe's showing that he was the same yesterday today and forever what is that the word being made flesh and huh and if God can do that for sister Hannah whatever you need God can do the same thing for you listen listen but the word is made flesh in you no longer is he in the manger don't look for him that he's not there he's not at the gravy that I've been there he's not there but I knew that look at it dear to Jesus Christ oh I'm starting at paragraph 80 yes says that same power that same Christ hallelujah let the fun of minutes let the people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women is time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back tell you that you're you're some little trot down something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that Almighty God lives in you in mortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God it's in the human being he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sport that they raised the dead from the day who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity and brother/sister that deity is in you and a little while in the world see it mean no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of life hallelujah the Creator God Himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we but will sweets will see him as he is for would be made like him no room for him but we got some room for him this morning we got room for him in our hearts a man a man church I want know that word has been made flesh again it was made flesh a man in Jesus day it was made flesh and and and an Isaac's day when he was born that promise that was given the word was made flesh it's being made flesh and your day hallelujah it's made flesh in your flesh and I thank God for that glory to God amen let's pray father we are grateful for this time where we see the entire world has to stop and acknowledge who you are Lord many have have completely pushed you to the side they brought Santa in and and so many other things that they're substituting for the real story but God we realized our God our Creator came and human flesh and it's very purpose for doing that was to come as a redeemer to die for our sins we were a lost people we were a hopeless people we were a helpless people our condition was just like the earth was it was without form it was void darkness was upon the face of the deep but when you said let there be light God then you began to go to work because of the light and that was the Esso end like that that begin to shine father that's the same thing that happened in our lives we were in darkness we need it light and so glad that you are the light of the world you came into our lives than you you have made a grand difference how grateful we are for that and as we law it would just celebrate during this Christmas season may we never forget what this is really all about it's about you God it's about
