from a different small tumors in my head so my doctor gave me the results this week and according to the doctor uh the cancer is back uh I I know the God we serve is able and willing to do it again and uh says I'm requesting that the Believers stand with me in prayer for more faith healing and holy boldness to put this devil to a [Applause] [Music] flight say uh as I go meet with the oncology

around the world of what God has done so here come the devil yeah this is what she had notice this is what she had and then after prayer that that's what she had and it it it completely disappeared um so there is just no way we can doubt Our God because he is he's proven this once again so what he told us to do when things like this happen and we're going to do exactly what he told us he says he says um you know if there's any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and then you know so this morning Sister Sister Tanya told Brother Troy I want to be prayed for today so she's calling for the Elders of the church and then the Bible tells us to anoint with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus and then it told us that the prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up so our job is to anoint she's called for us to pray and now our job is to anoint her with oil and I'm going ask just the brothers would come amen at this time and we will anoint our precious sister with oil amen and uh before she goes to the doctor we've seen this before amen we know our God is able he's he's a great God Amen we anoint her with oil amen praise the Lord Brother

few years ago uh I was ministering there and I was sharing her testimony and um and I said before she went to the doctor she said I got to have prayer and um and we had went through three well two services without praying for us she said no this the last service ton night I need prayer before we uh before we go back home so we prayed that night after service and somewhere between here and there uh that thing disappeared praise God and I was just sharing that testimony uh over in the UK and there was a sister uh she came to church that Friday night and she was leaving church going the next day for surgery sister Maddie was her name and and um and she had had a desire she'd been practicing a song with the choir she wanted to sing that song for Easter with the choir she just loved it so much and uh but she had said you know what I'm going to stream the service from the hospital and uh while streaming the service I'm going to be singing with a choir from my hospital bed that's where her faith was but before she went to the hospital she said you said that t ttim morning about your sister-in-law tonight tonight and I said I just felt I needed to come and be prayed for before I go to surgery tomorrow and uh brother brother whisper came and got me and I went to the office and and uh me and him we we laid hands on the sister we prayed for and she went up the next morning reported you know to the hospital for surgery and they got her all prepped and ready said you know let's just do one more test before we do the surgery and when they did the test um whatever she had was gone it was gone and and they told her say you don't need to do the surgery she put back on her clothes came back to church on Sunday morning and got up there and sung her song with the choir some things you can't do streaming I want to sing a song with the choir I need to be present amen so she uh she made it back and and and since that time God has uh God has uh certainly manifested himself to it I think she was telling me this week that she had no problems since that time it's been about I mean I'm sorry she told me the last time I was in in U in UK just a few weeks ago she says since that time there's been no problems at all with that so we know God Is A Healer we know God is and can you imagine the testimon going to go beyond this behind this you know and we say this is what it was and do

you can have some slides here or we can project that scripture first Isaiah 2:2 and if you can but Mar you like to read it for us thank you and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all the nations shall flow into it God the Lord bless you you might take your seat please amen so the mountain house there were there were seven Mountains mountain is a Ministry mountain is what the Lord erect from the earth it's like a lot of mountains have formed through volcanic actions they were already in the Earth but you don't see them and then when there's volcanic and fire the fire brings them it melt like like U something fluid liquid and then when it surfaces comes above the surface of the Earth and then the air blows around it solidified to form racks so whatever the Lord has for you the blessing is already yours you might not see it physically right you might not imagine it you might not be able to touch it but it's there am it's in you it's your blessing before the foundation of the world and as you watered by faith what is the fire is the pill of fire right and the air is your prayer and the Holy Spirit is the self same thing as you water your promises by faith and you believe it and you see it even in existence when it's not existence it will come to pass glory for the Bible said that whatever whatsoever things that you believe or you desire believe it it didn't even say pray for it is that what believe be is an action word something becoming and life live is a life amen so let it be in you a life that is already manifested and whatever you desire you're going to receive it amen our Lord is awesome amen today I don't really have a seron to preach as the Lord but I have a report to give and I believe the report will be a blessing to us amen report from Puerto Rico amen so we had this trip uh somewhere March 12th between March 12th and March 20th and uh to go back a little bit I met those Brothers in Cancun for the first time Puerto Rican brothers and uh we fellowship and we we touch base and all of them were vegans the pastor has been a vegan for 35 years or 30 years and it's associate being a vegan for 25 years so I said sister Amanda here he she is she's everywhere and I remembera when I when I was in school one of my professor was talking about vegan food and I said oh wherever I go I me sister Amanda and the vegan food so they were they they told me about the vegan food and and and they actually told me how it blessed them it started with their Pastor who was a translator for Braham he was sick his lungs were gone and the Lord told him to stop eating meat so he did it for one year and he regain his strength completely and so he announced it to the chair that it's not a Doctrine is not anything by force but is going to bless your health and the church pick it up and they've live it over the years God and I saw one sister in fact I took some the I on purpose took pictures with some of those elderly sisters 86 year old sister she had an open heart surgery when she was 80 plus years and she recovered quickly till the doctors were confounded and I could see some of them 86 they look like 65 and I saw that it's working for you so I remember I think I said something like that some some of us are me Laing but don't eat meat seven days a week reduces as much as possible this is not a Doctrine my disclosure is not a Doctrine it's just a health advice because the Lord want us to prop prosper in the spirit and also in the flesh as well because a lot of our meats are spread with everything you can think about radiations are in the meat that we eat now they want to inject a meat with a vaccination after covid so the meat and the chicken probably going to put covid vaccines in the meat so that the meat doesn't get the chicken doesn't get Co so you can imagine wow the little meat you want to put in your system Every chemical everything is pumped into this little flesh and then when you eat it the the the chemicals is in your body and with time it become casket of event sickness that we have so it it was something that I learned like I said it's not a Doctrine as a disclosure it's not a please I'm not saying don't eat meat eat meat as much as you want but if you can eliminate it as much as possible it will do your health good and let me use my own example I run I I'm kind of I call myself a crazy person I do crazy exercise I don't do in the daytime because if I do the day time where I live they going to call the cups on me I do it in the middle of the night I somersault I run I do kickboxing and different things all by myself so when I eat meat and I run run I feel like I need double twice the energy because I need to break down the meat first in the body to come back to myself and do my running and kickboxing and someting and those crazy stuff that I do but when I don't eat meat let's say fish it's much better and then when I don't eat any of them fish no meat and only plant food I'm like I fly like like I go like the wind just easy so I can tell you for myself that this meat if you can eliminate it as much as possible if you can do without it praise God hallelujah I was there for let's say eight span of 8 days I never miss meat or fish cuz they have vegan food which tastes like meat they have most of them are from H beans they use beans to make them they have chicken that tastes exactly like chicken they have even H what they call it they call it PRS and shrimps which taste like the same thing like the sea PRS but they meet them with with beans and it's more healthy options and Adventure because they meat that we have now is not maybe they made that 100 years ago the one they grow at the backyard natural because these are not natural these are not organic the meat chicken which is will be ready by 45 days could you imagine it's not natural for a chicken to be ready to eat in 45 days so what do they do they put hormones they put antibiotics they put vaccines not vaccines yet vitamins for them to grow quickly and all those vitamins and the hormones stays in your body and in the course of time develop into sickness that sometime we do experience so that was one advice that I I'll give if you can as much as POS especially the chicken that we love the most even the restaurant chicken they put a lot of chemicals to taste sweet in your mouth but it's disease that we e we literally putting disease into our body they put so much quantity of salt into this food which the body doesn't need so your kidney is going to work overw right to get this salt out of the body and if you eat those uh KFC Wendy's you name it h Fried Chicken all the time every day of your life with chicken with with what do you call it salt and oil you are overworking your kidney and the because of now we do have our kidney failures and all those things but if you can drink more water take this things out of your body drink more water eat more vegetables exercise not everybody can run you can walk even if you can run from here to the back of the building keep the heart pumping keep the heart going it's a blessing to our health because the Lord want you to prosper so that he can use you for the ministry that is given to you amen so that is a little one of the things that I learned let's go to so the this trip came about the brothers invited me to go September I couldn't make it because I was going through a lot of transitions so there's a brother don't worry come March we're going to have a church anniversary so prep and come around that time so close to the time they asked me they told me that every year they pray for Israel at I think somewhere February so they were in prayer for I think so many days and after I said brother we are now going to go through three days of praying and fasting for your coming and when I went the brother told me even my 8-year-old daughter prayed the whole day and fasted without nobody instructing her and the P pastor's daughter was she's 14 she did three days fasting and prayer and said brother we in expectation so they gave me a topic to that is not being preached in Puerto Rico adoption and Redemption so said brother pray for that topic and then when you come tell us what you think so I prepare for the topic and I went the Lord put us all of us in the same frequency and the ministers will understand sometime you go for ministers meeting and nobody learns nothing because you go with what you know and you come back with what you know it's just about fighting and this one should that I know more than you ministers can understand but ja knows what I'm talking about so you go and come back empty you didn't learn nothing because it's about I know more than you this my quote this my scriptures this my understanding this my experience we bombard each other with coat and we don't learn nothing but this was on another level it's a different ball game all together we were in the same channel certain things that the Lord has revealed to me years when I was in Ghana they had the same understanding so we went through Friday in the morning everybody get 30 minutes or 40 minutes to preach and explain it was just easy just easy like that because Redemption I remember when I was in my laptop I right Redemption is a called to adoption because Redemption is let's say the mother and adoption is a fine tuning cuz adoption is positionally placing you who you are Redemption is go to what you were before the foundation of the world and adoption is your position on this Earth what God meant for you to do on this Earth so you could be redeemed you might not be adopted you might not fulfill your purpose on this Earth but adoption is God personally telling you that my daughter my son this is my calling for you in this life amen so we just the Lord broke it to us easy then I preach uh the Friday night I preach someone the Bible has become a new book I pick a cont from the pram where he talk about when the SE were revealed the Bible became a new book to him the same Kim James the same whatever version you use but the lord gave a different understanding that has not been unveiled on this earth right from Adam to William Braham that was the first time the almighty brought those understanding and that understanding is for you and I so we broke a little bit of that on the Friday and the pastor preached the Saturday he took uh the numbers of the Bible and then brought it from the Zodiac and you look at the eclipse that was going to happen in the US and it was just amazing so the Sunday we preach on the shba the queen of the South is rising and it was the past says brother there've been a lot of Minister that have come to pre from Canada from from us from Mexico and they were blessing but you're coming as reviv the whole church he said even look at this person look at this one look at this one everybody's Reviving The Church wow and so we we preach we finished on the no Sunday Sunday evening then we had a little get together they have an auditorium they are churches in the wooded area they have a place all by themselves in the woods on the mountain and the pastor's house is just close to the church so the pastor walk like 2 minutes to the church just right there so and they have big land parking lot they don't have to compete with nobody they have an awesome natural atmosphere and they were telling me about Bram experience Bram had when he went to Puerto Rico 1959 he met their Pastor who has gone to be with the Lord called brother candelario and the brother took him to some mountains we went to tra in those mountains andam said he's been all around the world he's been to different places but the closest place that he knew to the Garden of Eden was those M mountain called Yun Forest excuse me so they were saying said he regretted for not taking his wife with him so when BR passed away his wife sister maida and the family went to Puerto Rico to visit their brother and they said the mountain competed for seven wonders of the earth it went through the competition to the last minute and then it dropped but then they found out there the mountain supposed to be the highest mountain on Earth even higher than Karo and Everest because part of the mountain is deep within the Earth and in those they didn't take account of those height and that is where the pastor was actually ordained a pastor that was a testimony I'll share with you and it will help our younger ministers that if you are faithful with the Lord you are faithful with the ministry God knows God Is Watching not just a man but God is watching so this brother was a regular brother and he lost his job he used to work with electricity company of Puerto Rico he lost his job and he went to tell the pastor Pastor I've lost my job I don't have they suspend me from my job he said don't worry today is Wednesday it's my day that I go to the mountain to pray and fast I'm going to talk to the Lord so don't worry they'll restore your job this same this this this same week they said don't worry so he went to the mountain to pray and the Lord told him that he's going to have his job so he came back and the brother didn't call him he called him on Friday he said brother I'm at work yesterday they called me that I should come back to the to my [Applause] work glory and that was a job that he did to retire he's a full-time Pastor now and so the Lord told the pastor candelario that go and anoint Jose osal as a pastor in your place so he called the brother his mother and his sister took them to the mountain I'm not sure whether he told them what he was going to do so they went to one of the highest PE they have two mountains they T abam to one of the mountain that's the highest called the uh the the Eagles mountain and then the other one is called the mountain of the Lord so they took him there and he read second Timothy chapter 1 as Paul read over his son Timothy and said you are the pastor of the church in my place and he brought him to the chair said the same respect that you give it to me give it to brother osalo he's my right hand man and not me the Lord asked me to ordain him as a pastor Wow and his ministry is just amazing wow the love one thing I learned from there when I went the first day they took me to the pastor's place to eat and then they took they gave me a tour i r a church they have a library of all the's message and their Pastor candelario their previous pastor's message and they print every message and the elderly sisters who are 80s and the 70s that's their Ministry so they have some to do every day they go and print let's say the message that is PR by Ja this week they will print it and then put in a they have a library put in a shelf so that you can go to the library and read the messages so they have all the messages stored in the churches it was just amazing and I could see our I said brother you people like the time of Solomon the harmony between them even there are brothers from Paraguay from Honduras uh Dominican Republic who are part of the ministry the love of Christ among the brothers there's not a perfect Church there's not a perfect Pastor there's not a perfect ministry but our Perfection is Christ but I could see that the epitome of what a church that should have the love of Christ and brothers and sisters coordinating as one everybody is a member of the church everybody is a body of the Christ everybody has a position in the church everybody know their Duty and they work in Harmony and I said brother this like in the time of Solomon and also the day of Pentecost when the brothers work in common Glory they support each other I me when it hit my brother it hit me when my brother is rejoicing I'm rejoicing and they all together when I me together so close together wow and it was just aming I said brother keep doing what you're doing because it's very rare in the message you know for CH to stick together so United with their pastor with the ministry and they supporting each other is is very rare so let me go to let me go to a a slide I probably will see a lot not too much let's go can we go to the second slide yeah I think that's the scripture that we read so you can read the rest of them when you get back home let's go to the next one the scripture is not new to you this is a Ministry of the wife of Christ that John was a type you should prophesy again to the nation to the people so that's your your scripture let's go to the next one you can read it when you go on your assignment that's right let's go to the next one you want to save time yes behold Revelation 1:7 these are scriptures that we fulfill them I'm talk about it it said behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which Pierce him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall will because of him even so amen I'm the alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end said the Lord which is which is which was and which is to come the almighty so the first uh Revelation 1:7 was fulfilled when the Lord came on the Mount of sunset all right and talk about it we go some quotes just probably one quotes yeah that's it he said what is the attraction of the mountain and I want you to take this one personally that the Lord is with you eternity doesn't go you know sometime we talk about coming of the Lord the way human we count the Lord came the first time you come the second time you come God doesn't look at it that way he's always in you your flesh may start when you were born but God always forew you amen God didn't come and then husband you don't marry a wife and then go somewhere and come back and be with your wife and go but because we are human beings we look at a major event and call it comings of Christ but the Lord is here this morning the Lord is in your home when you having your morning devotion the Lord is in your heart when you were inspiring to S the sons of Zion the Lord is always with you but we count with numbers so we kind of make bridges but if you can go beyond the bridges and see the Lord as Eternal event Circle and cycle rolling all the time you see God all in your life it just even like the way we see the dimension when you count the dimension First Dimension is what the Earth the universe the space second is the Earth the third is time fourth is uh science communication uh technology fifth is demons hell Satan and what have you death and then six is heaven Angels Saints thees and the Seven is where all the fountain intelligence Christ himself come from but then if you want to flip it around the seventh is actually the first Dimension my God where did the Earth come from God where did the universe come from where did all the DI came from so the real First Dimension is the seven Dimension it's just like when they brought the picture of sunset to BR it was turn upside down and they said switch it your day round and they saw Jesus Christ even his beard his ears nose and everything so sometime when we count we use our human time events we limit God in our life all right but if you can say Lord you are Eternal you have no limitation have your own way you worry about nothing amen even we preach sometime when you going to preach but Jack probably will testify sometime you strug you pray and try to read you never get a sermon that's right and for why am I not getting a sermon sometime your sermon is not in West Palm Beach you have to go to wherever you're going to preach Puerto Rico Australia England when you step there the seron will develop it's just like a scene God has got something there so when you get there you just pray sometime you can get a skeleton skeletal structure of what you need to maybe one scripture maybe a quote sometime nothing brother Smiley you can tell me brother Troy you can all these brothers can tell me but when you get there the holy spirit will tell you this is the sermon this is what I want you to preach this I want to talk about and things begin to develop quickly so we have to let God have his own way and let's you brand for example there was a time God show him visions and dreams and things like that before he go to the place to preach but there was time he said no I'm not going to show you no vision and because he was so used to vision seeing you sister dressing in this color of dress with this hairo with this with his children and blah blah blah blah but there was time God said no you becoming dependent on what you see you are not going to see no vision you're just going to go just as you areall and believe that I'm in you and I will take care of you there was a time Moses used to see uh God changing what do you call it changing um what is it when he met God at the at at the at the at the desert the pill of Fire Lea right burning without consuming and a ro turning into snake and things like that but at the re SE there was nothing for Moses to see and he begin to look at his human senses and these are enemies coming and Rey are you going to drown the 2 million people you can't do it with Mother's children and soldiers were coming and you don't have even a sword you don't have nothing to fight with God wanted you to look on the inside of him to that as I'll be with you even in you am and I promise you that I the Lord taking the people from Egypt to kand I will not fail don't look at the circumstances around you don't look at what the doctor said don't look at what you are going through don't look at your bank account don't look at the US economy don't look at the dollar bill but look at Jesus Christ on the inside of you Hallelujah GL glory to the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah amen so permit me to read this quotes that's the only quote I read and I want you to pay right attention is what is attraction of the mountain 147 said everything that shall never die what can never die is eternity even Jesus died as a human being but the pillar of the Christ in him couldn't die amen your flesh could die but the Christ in you will never die am so you are a etal being amen he said everything that shall never die it's constantly unrolling itself in other words unveiling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us and now exactly on Sunset Mountain so the prophet said that was Jesus looking at us was he Jesus amen it was Jesus right on S M 1963 that's right people we want to see Jesus with nails scar he finish with that Ministry he's not coming with nail scar anymore you want to see Jesus as a lamb he's done with that Ministry you don't want to go through what you went through you've never through do you want to go to become a baby with diapers anymore no you finished with that Ministry that was your ministry in diapers your mom and your dad cleaning you and you know drinking and milk and things like that you don't want to go into baby diapers anymore you want to be a full grown man or woman and that's what God want us to be it doesn't Jesus is not going to go back to Calvary to be crucified anymore no no it's not going to happen that way he said and the evening light has come God vindicating himself what is it it is the fact that God and Christ are one the white how many sees it the white wake upon him as we talk about in Revelation 1 and that's what we read reation 1: 7 Revelation one the Supreme dity supreme authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him dwells the fullness of godhead bodily the Angels themselves was his wake so the Angels were the Wes of Jesus Christ cuz it was a judge who are the Angels the ministry amen the theop the seven Messengers and the ministry who is judging West pal be but jackd all right he's not the senator he's not the governor Glory he's not the mayor of West pal right but the word that you speak the word is going around the atmosphere your life is judging the people around without you pronouncing judgment upon them amen amen if they see the Christ in you and love the Christ in you they will have a new life but if doesn't there they will go on as they are and they go into pedition he said the Angels God confirming his word what was it what what's the all the noise about is God fulfilling his promised word of Revelation CH 10 1-7 so two scriptures Revelation chapter 1 if you read the verse S he come in clouds and that was the clouds of Arizona amen and in the days of the sound of the Seven Angels messenger the mysteries of God should be finished the hidden mysteries of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church fulfills exactly in this age in this age St Luke 17:30 the days when the son of man shall be revealed amen it's not about the fantasy of the seven s revealed but what the Lord has in that Revelation personally to you amen what is the essence of Revelation is not to make our head big right but it's it has to swell your heart your Revelation because you go to certain trials your money will not help you in that in those trials your family will be of little help right you need what revelation of Jesus Christ and when you have the revelation of Jesus Christ you can become like Han Hannah right who was 70 years old but he said it was in her to have a child so regardless of being going after menopause Hannah said I want to have a child even the husband said I more than 10 children but that that didn't fulfill the heart of Hannah's heart God her faith fulfills her heart so Revelation beside eternal life God has given to you by grace but then God on your Earthly Journeys what you going to encounter if you don't have the reation of Christ you're going to crash that's right and we need the more revelation of Christ that we have the more we we walk we fly above the circumstances if you don't have Revelation little thing can upset you throw you off balance and we will and mourn and cry but if you have Revelation you see Way Beyond the circumstance amen glory to the Lord that this God permitted that circumstance for a purpose sometimes not even the devil don't worry about the devil who op the devil who allowed God does aen thank you brother Jack God allowed the devil to temp job without God Satan couldn't have done nothing so don't even worry about the devil but look at the Christ in you Christ in your brothers and sister Christ in the ministry Christ in your family and your Victory is just right there for you amen amen let's go ahead yeah that was when I went that was at the airport the brothers came to meet me with ghanian flag I was surprised I said Brothers I'm not the president of Ghana but I thank you so much for meeting Ghana said brother we do for everybody anybody that come to our land we greet him with the flag of their country we

amen [Applause] Shalom praise the Lord um you know I I think the scripture that brother quu read was just very perfect for what we just saw um there were multiple Nations that were represented there that were went up there into the mountain and even for him not realizing that he was part of a a prophecy uh uh a brother coming from Africa uh because brother quu is from Ghana and um and just going and just you know taking the gospel I don't know about you but it just does my heart great joy when I know that um uh that we're fulfilling a Great Commission you know the Lord Jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the gospel and uh just to have brothers right here from our a church you know going out and and and doing some of these things it's just a it's a it's a it's a blessing it really is a blessing um I wanted to just mention because I wanted him to share that he'd be going there to Mexico now um is it Mexico yeah and uh so he and brother Mark were supposed to be going but I told brother Mark now that's the same weekend we had a picnic but I didn't mean that to stop you from going brother but uh if the Lord put in your heart to go please you know please go but I want to tell the church that um if brother brandom say if you can't go to the Foreign Fields then send somebody right and uh so you know when you know that these brothers are are are actually getting ready to go maybe you can just give them a little something to help them towards their ticket uh towards some of the expenses that they might have when uh when they go just just put a little something in their pocket right whatever the Lord would lead you but you know we want we want you to know when you know different ones are going out um and uh just keep them in prayer because uh the Lord is using uh these brothers in a very special way so I know when brother Mark first decided to come he told me he had a desire to go um into you know some of the foreign lands especially um a mon uh uh maybe in the South americ places like that so I said well brother brother qu could go quite often so we'll try to connect you with him him so you can go with him sometime but now we see Puerto Rico is another place amen that that that that that that we can go Puerto Rico is home to uh brother uh H amen that's where his family's from so uh and you know and there's I I I've known for years different Believers there but I know Puerto Rico has also been a place that has been um the enem has gotten in amongst the people there with some some strange doctrines and things like that so when you got somebody going in with the right word you know and it seasoned just right then it begins to make a difference there in the land so and they're very close to us it's you know very very close I don't know that mountain uh trip it's a wonderful wonderful wonderful experience but my God that brother said two something hours to get up three hours Saints y'all better stop eating that meat [Applause] and and and I'm going tell you something I like the way brother quu did that he say this is not a Doctrine it's not a Doctrine but but I am I mean most people don't know you know but but for for those of us that know brother quu we come out here we call him brother quu but the brother is a actual doctor the man is a doctor so he knows this stuff about the body he know what he talking about amen he he see patience right so so so you know had to work in the hospitals and seeing all kind of things and and so what he's saying for us is very very helpful now I'm I'm I'm going stand and just be a witness to what he's saying you know uh recently I just been fighting y many of y'all know that the devil attacks me with diabetes uh I don't claim it I just keep fighting against it but uh one thing I do notice is that every time I go on the Daniel Fast and my body changes I know it changes when I go to that vegan you know uh vegetarian uh type fast my body changes so you know recently at we come out to Daniel Fast we get back to our normal eating and I'm seeing my numbers just rising and rising and rising and Rising praise the Lord and um and and and actually brother Robles and sister Robles would get me special medication from Dominican Republic to help me and when when when when when I lost brother robless I'm like oh Lord but God maybe didn't want me on the medication so what I had to do is start going back to that that that Daniel Fast making it part of my lifestyle and it's something that I I just made that decision myself recently just to kind of do this I didn't know that brother going to come out here tell me a whole pastor and a whole church is doing vegan that's for me if it ain't for nobody else that was for me amen we can change our health by what we eat I'mma say that again if you going through different problems in your body right now you can change that by what you eat praise the Lord so I I've been watching myself as I as I just went back to and I never told nobody I just I start going back to what I was doing Daniel Fast my number's going down down down without that medication that used to get praise the Lord you see that medication if I bought it here in this well let me not talk too much cuz let me just let me just hush some things you just can't say on on on on on the stream amen but let's just put it this way the um um the doctors and the pharmacist make a lot of companies make a lot of money off of us because of our dependence on medication and then there are certain medications they give you that cause your body to continue to depend upon it amen you know certain foods that you eat that will cause your body to CRA crave for more of that food and you'll find if you drink more water amen it it'll just it won't you won't have those C certain Cravings some some like there's sometimes I would sit down and eat man you just give me something to drink and i' be fine just keep giving just filling up my cup filling up my cup but the more water I drink I don't feel like that I drink because I need to drink not because I want to drink y'all understand Kool-Aid to make you feel like you want to drink all that sugar in there all y'all ain't talking to me boy this A good sermon today that brother [Applause] preach but if we just change the way we eat we'll see a difference in our bodies amen you want to lose weight change the way you eat and you know you've been trying to exercise for years you ain't got out there yet change the way you eat change the way you eat hello somebody brother amen I'm telling you that and and we ain't got no mountains here in Florida so you know we we don't we can't go up there like that but I tell you if some of us went there they have to leave us at the bottom of [Music] the we don't want
