[42:05] Solomon leading and say is certainly

[42:10] know many of the saints were away last
[42:13] um weekend various uh things happening
[42:16] but uh we thank God to see everybody
[42:19] back home and uh we did have a wonderful
[42:22] service on last week and you know just
[42:25] uh towards the uh praise the
[42:29] Lord um just towards the end you just
[42:33] felt an
[42:35] anointing uh coming into the room and um
[42:40] and I believe that anointing is still
[42:42] here
[42:43] today amen and and and and what we have
[42:48] learned to do is that when the angel is
[42:53] troubling the water then we know how to
[42:56] jump in
[42:58] amen so this morning I encourage you
[43:00] just jump in get everything God got for
[43:03] you um praise God as mom was saying this
[43:07] has been a real journey for us uh that
[43:10] started last year and still carrying
[43:13] over into this year and um you know and
[43:17] and I just feel like we are actually in
[43:20] the
[43:21] manifestation of what we're reading in
[43:24] the Bible I feel like we're living in it
[43:27] and uh you know and and and you know
[43:30] once you kind of catch where you are uh
[43:33] then it just it becomes more real to you
[43:36] amen so uh I I I got a couple scriptures
[43:39] that I want to read uh on today you all
[43:42] already know the Joel scriptures but
[43:44] here I'm going to read it I'm going to
[43:46] read it anywhere but I want to go to
[43:47] Revelation 18 after that uh and the
[43:50] reason I'm reading Joel is for those
[43:53] that may not be um aware what I'm
[43:57] reading in Joelle is actually a
[44:00] connection to what I read in Revelation
[44:03] 18 it's a connection to what I read last
[44:06] week in Luke 17 it's a connection to
[44:09] Malachi 4 now the theologians can't make
[44:13] that connection but because uh brother
[44:17] brandham told us that this
[44:20] book this will not be revealed to people
[44:25] that's just got ordinary amen uh
[44:29] understanding of the scripture and they
[44:31] compare verse by verse it says it's
[44:35] going to take a special group uh and he
[44:38] says this special group is going to be
[44:40] one that has to have
[44:42] prophetic
[44:44] insight and when you have prophetic
[44:47] Insight you can say things that the
[44:49] theologians can't
[44:54] say so Joel one
[44:57] 4 praise God this is why it's so
[45:00] important and people just pick up their
[45:02] Bibles and they look at oh Lord Jesus I
[45:06] can't even get
[45:07] started but when we pick up our Bibles
[45:09] you know there different manufacturers
[45:11] for
[45:11] Bibles and every manufacturer has uh
[45:16] pretty much gotten behind somebody that
[45:19] was smarter than them and they say we're
[45:22] going to put our name behind you because
[45:24] we trust what you have studied over the
[45:26] years you know
[45:28] your
[45:31] uh uh
[45:33] Amplified version was written by a
[45:39] sister there was some some people got
[45:41] behind this lady and say we you you seem
[45:44] to understand it better than us so we
[45:46] want to promote you and let her write
[45:48] what she thought the scripture
[45:51] meant and we go there to try to
[45:55] understand can I
[45:57] tell you another source that you can go
[46:00] to so you can
[46:05] understand go to the prophet read the
[46:09] message listen to the message because
[46:11] God sent it through a prophet all right
[46:15] I'm going to read some scriptures today
[46:16] and the only way we're going to
[46:17] understand this scripture is based on
[46:19] what a prophet has told
[46:21] us thank you Jesus all right that which
[46:24] the Palm worm have left hath uh um
[46:27] Locust eaten and that which the Locust
[46:29] ha eaten ha the cankerworm eaten and
[46:31] that which the cankerworm have left ha
[46:33] the caterpillar eaten uh chapter two uh
[46:36] really really quick I'll read 23 to
[46:40] 25 um be glad then you children of Zion
[46:43] and rejoice in the Lord your God for
[46:45] Heath given you the former rain
[46:47] moderately and he will cause to come
[46:49] down for you the rain the former rain
[46:50] and the latter rain in the first month
[46:53] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[46:55] the floors shall be full of Wheat and
[46:58] the fats shall overflow with wine and
[47:01] oil I just believe we living in this
[47:04] amen and um and I will restore to you
[47:09] this is a personal uh thing I restore to
[47:13] you the years that the Locust hath eaten
[47:17] the cankerworm and the caterpillar and
[47:20] the palmerworm my great Army which I
[47:22] sent among you all right Revelation 18
[47:28] is where we will uh go to uh we'll pick
[47:32] up uh and as I said Joel 2 is connected
[47:38] to Revelation
[47:40] 18 amen um and uh we'll hopefully uh get
[47:47] to that today and uh verse one says and
[47:53] after these
[47:55] things now now there's a lot I can say
[47:58] and I'll just in input this after what
[48:02] things after we've seen this kker worm
[48:07] this Palmer worm this Locus and all I
[48:11] mean this this insect in multiple stages
[48:13] after these things right I saw another
[48:18] Angel come down from
[48:20] heaven glory to God having great
[48:24] power and the Earth was lightened with
[48:30] his
[48:31] glory all right and he cried mightily
[48:36] with a strong voice saying
[48:39] Babylon uh the great is Fallen it's
[48:42] fallen and has become the habitation of
[48:48] devils glory to God any devil feel
[48:51] comfortable
[48:53] there y'all know this the truth we
[48:56] talked about it last week it a
[48:58] habitation of devils when when you are
[49:01] ordaining people that ain't even living
[49:04] right one guy called himself a pastor
[49:07] and he also considered himself to be
[49:09] homosexual at the same time and he say

[49:14] from his homosexuality who he going to
[49:17] Pastor praise the Lord uh the Bible says
[49:21] it's a habitation of
[49:25] devils all right right glory to God

[49:43] scripture so we know where we stand amen

[49:48] cried mightily with a strong voice
[49:50] saying Babylon the great is Fallen it's
[49:53] fallen and it's become the habitation of
[49:55] devils and a hold of every foul spirit
[49:59] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[50:02] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[50:05] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[50:07] the kings of the Earth have committed
[50:09] fornication with her and the merchants
[50:11] of the Earth are wax Rich through the
[50:13] abundance of her
[50:15] Delicacies and I
[50:18] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[50:22] come out of her my people that ye be not
[50:25] partakers of her sins and that you
[50:29] receive not of her
[50:31] plagues let's pray father we thank you

[51:05] pass away it's the only sure Foundation
[51:08] I pray God that as we go through this

[51:18] are online Lord let Revelation uh be
[51:22] brought God we just give you glory and

[51:30] service in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[51:33] amen God bless you can be
[51:40] seated so we continue our our thought
[51:44] here through get back and step and um as
[51:49] I mentioned this is not just for us that
[51:52] are sitting here uh but we have a a
[51:55] number of people that watch Us online
[51:58] and you may not realize it but you
[52:02] actually help the people that are online
[52:05] amen now how how do you do that when you
[52:08] pull on the
[52:10] word it causes us to move in different
[52:13] directions and those directions are
[52:15] helping somebody else online thank you
[52:19] Jesus praise God Amen when you get to
[52:22] heaven one day and you see somebody like
[52:25] you know I now you know I never made it
[52:27] to your church but I watch you on
[52:30] video I saw you on video and and you
[52:33] encouraged me sometime just watching the
[52:35] way you praise God while the word was
[52:38] going forth it did something for
[52:40] me when I heard you sang a song it did
[52:43] something for me when you played that
[52:45] instrument it did something for me you
[52:47] have no idea what you did for me praise
[52:51] God so so what we do here is not just
[52:53] for us amen that the min goes beyond
[52:57] amen these four walls but um as we go
[53:01] back you know just thinking on some of
[53:03] the things that we've already been
[53:04] talking about and uh get back in step
[53:08] and um one of the prayers that was
[53:11] Prayed by the prophet I won't read the
[53:13] quote just I'm just going to read quote
[53:14] this prayer uh out of the message proven
[53:17] his word he said let the Bride As she
[53:19] starts getting out of Step from this and
[53:22] that may she come back into the step as
[53:26] the vision showed a few weeks ago now
[53:29] when when when I'm just you know
[53:31] bringing that before the church I I
[53:33] realize that somebody did get out of
[53:36] Step but they also got back into step
[53:40] because the vision showed that they were
[53:43] going to get back into step amen they
[53:46] can't they can't help it they have to
[53:47] get back in Step God God knew that these
[53:49] things would happen uh he sent this Army
[53:52] amongst us and uh but he also makes a
[53:54] way of Escape in the midst of it all so
[53:56] we we thank God we uh we were we were
[53:59] just mentioning on you know we've been
[54:02] uh a couple things that we've been
[54:04] mentioned we were talking of a um a
[54:08] statement out of the church age book
[54:10] where brother brandom said God's going
[54:12] to take the church back to Pentecost of
[54:14] the beginning amen he said also that uh
[54:19] uh when we look at the denominational
[54:21] church today um my brother was asking a
[54:24] question or yesterday when we had a
[54:26] ministers meeting and he asked a
[54:28] question about you know when we say that
[54:30] the church uh won't go I mean the church
[54:34] will go through the tribulation but the
[54:35] bride won't he said now he say the real
[54:37] Church won't go through the tribulation
[54:39] I say okay you're right you're right I
[54:41] said however when you're trying to
[54:43] separate church and
[54:45] bride uh what you need to do is kind of
[54:47] go back and look at the scripture in
[54:49] Revelation 2 and Revelation three the
[54:52] final statement to every age was he
[54:56] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[55:00] spirit says unto the
[55:04] churches exactly pluralized so in every
[55:08] age we find that there is amen a true
[55:12] church and also a false Church yes sir
[55:16] we just not we not playing games we not
[55:18] trying to be just part of a church we
[55:21] want to be part of the true
[55:23] church because when you read in
[55:25] Revelation 2 and 3 for most of the ages
[55:27] there is a rebuke going Amen to the
[55:30] false church but then there is an
[55:32] encouragement happening to the true
[55:34] church but both of them are growing
[55:37] together
[55:39] hallelujah amen when you're driving down
[55:41] the street looking for a church to go
[55:43] till you got the question is this true
[55:46] or is this
[55:48] false hallelujah amen the only way
[55:51] you're going to know whether they're
[55:52] true or not is whether they taken and
[55:54] standing on the full word of God not
[55:57] just the parts that they agree with but
[56:00] we got to take we got to take the whole
[56:01] role so so so brother brandom you know
[56:04] says that you know when you're looking
[56:05] at the the true church and false church
[56:07] one thing that you will find with the
[56:09] false church is that they will out Shine
[56:13] the elect in effort and
[56:19] Zeal oh they got many programs they got
[56:22] this they got that they got this for the
[56:24] young people and that for this and I
[56:25] mean they got everything they got TV
[56:28] night and and bowling night and praise
[56:32] God hello
[56:33] somebody I mean some of these churches
[56:35] they their whole theme for the whole
[56:37] summer is
[56:40] movies and they get their inspiration
[56:42] from
[56:43] movies how you going to get inspiration
[56:45] from something the devil put
[56:49] out look y'all amen it's a it's a
[56:53] habitation of devils
[56:56] all right glory to God Amen it ain't
[57:00] nothing but the truth right and and when
[57:02] you get inside and you see how them
[57:03] Devils start operating people ain't been
[57:05] delivered from nothing I'm talking about
[57:08] a a man that's considered pastor of the
[57:11] church cursing like a
[57:13] saell it's a
[57:17] habitation of
[57:20] devils and they doing this all in the
[57:23] name of
[57:24] Jesus so so so so understand you got to
[57:27] catch these keys that the prophet is
[57:29] given say they outshine elect in effort
[57:33] and
[57:35] Zeal but it says it's Le thean is not of
[57:39] Christ for it looks for big
[57:43] crowds big programs startling signs
[57:47] amongst them they
[57:50] preach the second coming of Christ and
[57:53] and I was telling y'all you know
[57:55] everybody talk about we I I just want to
[57:57] preach Jesus this morning you know what
[57:59] I'm
[58:04] preaching I'm preaching Jesus when I'm
[58:08] preaching anything out of this word I'm
[58:10] preaching
[58:12] Jesus hallelujah amen and and and and
[58:16] don't get me wrong I love amen uh you
[58:19] know the the the about the the fish and
[58:22] five loaves of bread and I love all of
[58:25] that and I mean but but there's there's
[58:27] more in this scripture that's not the
[58:29] only thing Jesus
[58:31] did Hallelujah so we're trying to preach
[58:34] it all but here he says this he says
[58:36] they
[58:37] preach the the second coming of Christ
[58:40] but here's the problem but
[58:43] deny the
[58:45] Advent of the Prophet
[58:49] messenger and uh he says though in power
[58:51] and signs and true Revelation he
[58:54] eclipses them all now now now now when
[58:56] we talk about the Advent of the Prophet
[58:58] messenger we're simply saying it's the
[59:01] arrival of a notable person a notable
[59:04] thing or a notable event the arrival
[59:07] when we say Advent is the arrival and
[59:10] and I'm here to tell you that the
[59:11] prophet has come and
[59:13] gone and and and the scriptures that I'm
[59:16] reading to you have already been
[59:18] manifested what I what I read just read
[59:20] to you in Revelation 18 is not something
[59:22] that we're waiting to to happen it has
[59:25] already happen and people afraid of the
[59:28] Book of Revelation but don't even know
[59:30] many of these things have already
[59:32] occurred amen praise God now this Advent
[59:36] of the Prophet messenger where the Lord
[59:38] has just kind of led me to do here is
[59:40] just kind of take you through scripture
[59:43] by scripture by scripture to show you
[59:46] where God promised us a prophet we're
[59:49] not following this just to follow it now
[59:54] I I I I I mean we got to get Beyond that
[59:56] and and and some would say you just
[59:58] following a man oh I done heard that one
[1:00:00] before I wonder if they told the people
[1:00:02] in Paul's day the same thing that you
[1:00:05] just following a man and and you know
[1:00:07] what we got to be able to withstand them
[1:00:09] that type of criticism you know because
[1:00:11] Paul did make a
[1:00:15] statement somebody know the word in here
[1:00:18] Paul said follow me as I follow
[1:00:22] Christ and can I tell you something Paul
[1:00:24] was what we call a book in
[1:00:28] messenger Hallelujah somebody if you got
[1:00:31] books on the Shelf amen you need to put
[1:00:34] book
[1:00:35] ends and the book ends is what holds it
[1:00:39] all together so you need a book in on
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:44] front and don't put your book in in the
[1:00:46] middle because they ain't going to hold
[1:00:47] it all together everything after the
[1:00:49] book in will fall off the shelf come on
[1:00:52] somebody so I got to put a book in on
[1:00:55] the front
[1:00:56] then I got to put a book in on the back
[1:00:59] and Paul being a book in Messenger to
[1:01:02] the age of
[1:01:03] Ephesus my God my God my
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:09] God I can't help me Lord but but him
[1:01:13] being a booking Messenger to the age of
[1:01:15] Ephesus he made certain statements that
[1:01:18] that only Paul could make he said if a
[1:01:21] angel from heaven come and preach
[1:01:25] something different different than what
[1:01:27] I preach let the angel be a
[1:01:33] curse that's a strong statement from a
[1:01:36] man praise God I got some things I need
[1:01:39] to share here today but but he was a
[1:01:42] book in Messenger on the front side but
[1:01:44] brother Brandon becomes the bookend
[1:01:46] Messenger to hold it all together on the
[1:01:50] on the on the
[1:01:52] inside he's the end time messenger
[1:01:56] thus we follow an end time message and
[1:02:00] the end time messenger preach the same
[1:02:08] thing the same thing the first book in
[1:02:12] messenger preach ain't nothing different
[1:02:15] it's just a restoration back to what
[1:02:19] Paul
[1:02:23] preached so we
[1:02:26] walk you through Malachi 4 God used that
[1:02:29] scripture to promise this Revelation

[1:02:50] that we can look for here in the end
[1:02:52] time
[1:02:54] uh and then then today I want to go to
[1:02:57] Revelation 18:4 all all of these
[1:03:00] scriptures are scriptures that that that
[1:03:02] pertain to where we're living amen uh St
[1:03:06] Luke

[1:03:13] was in the days of
[1:03:14] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[1:03:18] the son of man and these are this is
[1:03:20] Jesus in his prophetic Ministry uh he's
[1:03:24] prophesying about what will happen and
[1:03:28] um so he tells us that they did eat they
[1:03:32] drank they married wives so that that
[1:03:35] that means marriages were going to be
[1:03:37] attacked and we have a lot of marriage
[1:03:39] and divorce situations happening praise
[1:03:41] God now and we need to know the word of
[1:03:43] God we need to know the word of God in
[1:03:46] in God's word he say he
[1:03:48] hate divorce that's what God Said in
[1:03:51] Malachi he hated but the we there's
[1:03:54] going to be an attack on marriages now

[1:08:52] I'm at they did eat they drink they
[1:08:55] marit wise they were given in marriage
[1:09:00] until the day that Noah entered into the
[1:09:02] ark and and here's now here's the here's
[1:09:04] the thing they they they were given in
[1:09:07] marriage they married wives so the
[1:09:09] marriage and divorce issue living with
[1:09:11] people not being married to them they
[1:09:13] did that until the day Noah entered into
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:17] ark they did now so that mean there's
[1:09:19] some people ain't going to break the
[1:09:23] cycle even though they've heard the
[1:09:25] truth they continue to do exactly what
[1:09:28] they want to
[1:09:29] do and you'll pay for it so you're going
[1:09:32] to be judged by what you hear so it's
[1:09:35] important for me to share with you the
[1:09:36] truth and the Bible tells that you'll
[1:09:38] know the truth and the truth will it'll
[1:09:41] make you free look at this he says until
[1:09:44] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[1:09:45] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:09:47] all it says this

[1:12:43] you got to catch yourself like oh Lord I
[1:12:46] was not looking for that the devil would

[1:12:58] it's a spirit attacking you I want to
[1:13:01] give you the word of God because we know
[1:13:02] these things against the word of God but
[1:13:05] yet we will see it in our day that's why
[1:13:07] I going to take the Holy Ghost to be
[1:13:08] able to withstand this amen look at this
[1:13:11] now uh verse 28 says likewise as it was
[1:13:15] in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:13:18] drank they brought they sold they
[1:13:19] planted they build it but the same day
[1:13:21] that lot went out of Sodom it rain uh
[1:13:24] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:13:26] Destroy them all even thus shall it be
[1:13:29] in the day when the son of man is
[1:13:32] revealed now that part is so important
[1:13:35] yes sir even thus shall it be in the day
[1:13:39] when the son of man is
[1:13:43] revealed let us read a few quotes Amen
[1:13:48] on
[1:13:50] that uh I'm going to go to the message
[1:13:54] called out
[1:13:55] but
[1:13:57] um just re just just kind of remind you
[1:14:01] cuz um um even though we see all these
[1:14:05] negative things happening uh when I want
[1:14:07] to say negative I'm saying things
[1:14:09] against the word of God we see uh the
[1:14:11] marriage and divorce issue we see the
[1:14:14] overabundance of eating drinking we see
[1:14:18] uh uh uh
[1:14:21] homosexuality uh and and let me put it
[1:14:23] this way cuz the I think the numbers on
[1:14:25] people that are homosexual it's probably
[1:14:27] like less than 10% of our nation it's
[1:14:30] way less than 10% however it just seems
[1:14:33] like they got more
[1:14:34] power than all the other 85% or whatever
[1:14:38] it is or 90% it is uh 95% they got more
[1:14:42] power because that that Spirit again has
[1:14:44] been released in this day and we need to
[1:14:45] understand that that's what that's what
[1:14:47] Jesus promis will come now in the midst
[1:14:49] of all of that don't don't don't don't
[1:14:51] get your eyes completely on that because
[1:14:52] while lot in the days of lot
[1:14:55] uh uh these was that that was happening
[1:14:57] God was also revealing things to Abraham
[1:15:00] in the tent and there was a messenger
[1:15:03] that stayed with Abraham revealing
[1:15:04] certain things to him Hallelujah that's
[1:15:07] where we find ourselves amen we're in
[1:15:09] that group where God is revealing things
[1:15:11] to us while the rest of the world is
[1:15:13] going on in sin all right glory to God
[1:15:17] Amen like mama said I knew this was it
[1:15:19] when when it came to me when it found me
[1:15:22] I knew this was it I was looking for
[1:15:25] else amen praise God now now now now um
[1:15:29] so what happened with with Abraham he's
[1:15:32] uh God himself is there revealing the
[1:15:34] secrets what's happening in the tent uh
[1:15:36] behind Abraham and I read y'all the
[1:15:38] quote how brother brandom my God God
[1:15:41] used him in the same manner here where
[1:15:43] he turned his back to the audience and
[1:15:45] he revealing the secrets we s we saw it
[1:15:48] manifested right before our very eyes
[1:15:51] and look at this now he made a statement
[1:15:53] here in the message called out this is
[1:15:56] 1958 he says Jesus said when the son of
[1:16:00] man is revealed from heaven right Jesus
[1:16:04] said when the son of man was revealed
[1:16:05] from Heaven he says uh let me close by
[1:16:08] saying this the son the son of man is
[1:16:12] now being revealed from heaven so here
[1:16:17] in his ministry uh this scripture that
[1:16:20] we just read about uh uh uh the days of
[1:16:22] lot the days of Noah what brother saying
[1:16:25] that is actually taking place right
[1:16:28] now oh my this ain't a future tense
[1:16:32] scripture this is actually a past tense
[1:16:35] scripture he he says he say he says um
[1:16:38] let me close by saying this that the son
[1:16:40] of man is now being revealed from heaven
[1:16:44] will it come after a while brother
[1:16:46] brandom it is now he says and I hope I
[1:16:50] won't have to make this so personal of
[1:16:53] this on meeting but that your spirit
[1:16:55] within you that's give you by God can
[1:16:59] read what I'm talking
[1:17:02] about look at it the son of man has
[1:17:05] already come from Glory Oh My My My and
[1:17:10] is revealing himself for the past few

[1:25:21] again oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:25] now it's one thing when amen just a
[1:25:29] preacher says this but it's a different
[1:25:32] thing when a prophet says
[1:25:34] it let's let's read what the scripture
[1:25:36] was telling here telling us in
[1:25:38] Revelation 18 and I I I just got um so
[1:25:42] much actually before we read let's go
[1:25:44] back to Revelation 17 because I want to
[1:25:46] pick up something here and then we'll
[1:25:48] come back to Revelation 18
[1:25:54] oh
[1:25:56] Lord so
[1:25:59] much we already read Revelation 184
[1:26:02] where the angel said come out of her my
[1:26:04] people come out of what come out of what
[1:26:08] Revelation 17 kind of gives us amen a
[1:26:12] little picture of what what what this
[1:26:13] Angel calling us calling us out of now
[1:26:16] Revelation 17 in the most churches
[1:26:19] nowadays most churches I'm going to say
[1:26:22] not even message churches most of the
[1:26:24] would identify that Revelation 17 is a
[1:26:29] direct fulfillment within the Catholic
[1:26:34] Church most people would actually agree
[1:26:37] this is the Catholic church right here
[1:26:39] in Revelation 17 let me let's read a
[1:26:41] little bit let's read a little bit that
[1:26:43] that that way to help us amen amen amen
[1:26:46] amen uh it says and there came one of
[1:26:49] the Seven
[1:26:50] Angels which had the seven vows and
[1:26:53] talked with me saying unto to me come
[1:26:55] hither I will show unto you the Judgment
[1:26:57] of the great that sth upon many
[1:27:01] Waters means you got a lot of people
[1:27:03] following her all right with whom the
[1:27:06] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:27:09] fornication amen and the inhabitants of
[1:27:11] the Earth have been made drunk with the
[1:27:13] wine of her fornication now let let's
[1:27:15] just let's try to break these things
[1:27:17] down so that we're not we're not
[1:27:20] overwhelmed by what we read in scripture
[1:27:23] a prophet helps us understand that
[1:27:25] spiritual
[1:27:27] fornication is when we going against
[1:27:29] God's word amen when we're holding to
[1:27:33] denominational
[1:27:35] Rags instead of Amen standing earnestly
[1:27:39] for the faith that was delivered to the
[1:27:41] Saints instead of going back and taking
[1:27:43] the word of God we hold on to a
[1:27:45] denominational rag let me go a little
[1:27:47] further with that I mean in
[1:27:49] denominations we have a hierarchy right
[1:27:53] Hallelujah
[1:27:54] we have a local pastor but that Pastor
[1:27:57] often times is subjected to a bishop
[1:28:01] hallelujah or a
[1:28:02] superintendent amen or a cardinal
[1:28:06] Hallelujah in the Catholic Church they
[1:28:07] all subjected to a
[1:28:09] pope praise God and whatever the pope
[1:28:12] say when it comes from him it goes all
[1:28:14] the way down to everybody else and and
[1:28:17] and and and I know amen and some of the
[1:28:19] other organizations like a pastor could
[1:28:21] be doing very well with his congregation
[1:28:24] and then he would go to a uh uh what
[1:28:27] they call that uh conference he'd go to
[1:28:31] a conference and the bishop would tell
[1:28:33] him I feel
[1:28:35] led to move you from this church to this
[1:28:39] other church and I'mma put my nephew
[1:28:41] into your church okay y'all know it's
[1:28:44] the truth and and the people will happen
[1:28:47] that they the leaders subject themselves
[1:28:50] to what that Bishop has said that's
[1:28:52] right they don't agree
[1:28:54] with what he said but they subject
[1:28:57] themselves they oh if I could just put
[1:28:59] it this way if I can just say it like
[1:29:00] this they following a
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:18] man it ain't nothing but the truth right
[1:29:22] they following what a man said
[1:29:25] that man feel L of God and he do exactly
[1:29:28] what he want to do Church be
[1:29:31] thriving and they just move them just
[1:29:33] like that don't even care about the
[1:29:35] people don't even care it's it it become
[1:29:37] a political game and they know it's the
[1:29:39] truth but they'll sit there and give
[1:29:41] their time their energy everything to
[1:29:43] that every
[1:29:47] year when when the angel Lord is calling
[1:29:50] us out of
[1:29:51] it all right let me keep on let me keep
[1:29:54] on reading here it says um verse three
[1:29:59] says so he carried me away in the spirit
[1:30:02] in the wilderness and I saw a woman Upon
[1:30:04] A Scarlet colored

[1:30:22] golden cup in her hand full of
[1:30:24] Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:30:26] fornication and fornication they they
[1:30:29] they they have their own Creeds and
[1:30:30] dogmas rather than the word of God you
[1:30:32] can show them in the word where it's
[1:30:33] wrong and they're going to say no we're
[1:30:35] going to go what the bishop say no no no
[1:30:37] no no no no no the bishop ain't got no
[1:30:39] he can't judge me the bishop ain't got
[1:30:41] no heaven or no hell to put me in God is
[1:30:45] the one that's going to judge me so I'm
[1:30:46] going say what God
[1:30:48] say Amen brother brandom had to leave
[1:30:51] the leave the Baptist Den ation because
[1:30:55] they were trying to get him to do

[1:30:59] do TR trying to get him to lay hands on
[1:31:02] a woman preach and anoint her he said no
[1:31:05] what the Bible say I suffer not a woman
[1:31:07] to teacher you suff Authority Paul
[1:31:10] Paul so now so this what we get now when
[1:31:14] when because Paul said that now we hear
[1:31:17] Paul what Paul wasn't married so since
[1:31:20] Paul deducing deducing deducing since
[1:31:23] Paul went married Paul was a woman hater

[1:31:31] the
[1:31:32] truth hello
[1:31:34] somebody oh y'all y'all ain't g y look
[1:31:38] look here why is it that when we get a
[1:31:42] lot of these ladies in the pull pit they
[1:31:43] start sounding like
[1:31:49] men acting like men
[1:31:56] I I can tell you what it is if you want
[1:31:58] me to tell
[1:32:00] you
[1:32:01] spiritual
[1:32:03] homosexuality

[1:32:39] spiritual hello
[1:32:41] somebody right

[1:32:49] cuz I people well we don't never see no
[1:32:51] women behind your pullit you never
[1:32:55] will you actually never
[1:32:58] will praise God because because Paul

[1:33:05] was wrong and you want to know where
[1:33:06] Paul got that from he went all the way
[1:33:09] back to the Garden of Eden and he saw
[1:33:11] how God uh orchestrated things after the
[1:33:15] fall and he and he said now uh Eve you G

[1:33:42] man hello church we might as well preach
[1:33:46] these
[1:33:47] things but the reason that we don't have
[1:33:49] it because we want to do it exactly the
[1:33:51] way Paul said
[1:33:54] amen and the church has gotten away from
[1:33:58] scripture but what happens God sends a
[1:34:00] messenger with a message to call you
[1:34:02] back to scripture come out of that
[1:34:06] confusion come out of that you know I
[1:34:08] mean come out of that Babylonian

[1:34:14] to talk about that in a second but but
[1:34:16] but we call God calls us out of that
[1:34:18] confusion to bring us back to the word
[1:34:20] this is why he said I will restore yeah

[1:34:57] here right mystery Babylon the great but
[1:35:01] look at this
[1:35:02] one the mother amen of harlots and
[1:35:07] Abominations of the Earth let me just
[1:35:10] just just leave that right there just
[1:35:11] for a second I I I got to just talk to
[1:35:13] you we know the Catholic church is all
[1:35:16] over this scripture and and Revelation
[1:35:18] 17 speaks so much about the Catholic
[1:35:20] Church um it's I think when it's talking
[1:35:23] about them uh seven uh seven heels or
[1:35:28] what was it um my Lord Jesus they were
[1:35:31] sitting on um seven seven vows talk with
[1:35:35] me saying uh great hord that sit upon
[1:35:38] many Waters there was something about
[1:35:39] there was sitting oh okay seven heads
[1:35:41] and 10 horns uh I think later on the
[1:35:44] Scripture it even tell you how this is
[1:35:46] seven seven heels of mountains that it
[1:35:49] sit on and uh now there's a couple no
[1:35:52] two cities specifically
[1:35:54] that kind of sit on Seven
[1:35:55] heels one of them is Cincinnati Ohio
[1:35:59] Cincinnati Ohio uh they I mean you walk
[1:36:02] through it it's heels everywhere all all
[1:36:04] over that City when you're driving
[1:36:05] through but but but they didn't have the
[1:36:07] kind of power that what we read here in
[1:36:10] Revelation 17 where they can control the
[1:36:11] whole world Cincinnati don't now the IRS
[1:36:15] is there in
[1:36:16] Cincinnati but but they don't control
[1:36:18] the whole
[1:36:20] world right
[1:36:25] the other city that sit on Seven Hills
[1:36:27] is
[1:36:29] Rome and and and they do control the
[1:36:31] whole world so when you look at this
[1:36:33] scripture it's pertaining to
[1:36:37] Rome I'm I'm going just say some things
[1:36:40] y'all just bear with
[1:36:43] me mother of harlots these are this this
[1:36:45] is these are
[1:36:48] prostitutes these are these are these
[1:36:50] are uh uh women that give free
[1:36:59] samples me and my family went to Rome a
[1:37:01] few years ago for a little vacation and
[1:37:05] um you know as we were going on our
[1:37:07] cruise we had to leave we we we actually
[1:37:10] went to the Vatican we saw the riches
[1:37:11] and the wealth and everything that's
[1:37:13] there we we saw it with our own eyes I
[1:37:15] mean it's it's massive it's massive it's
[1:37:17] it's unbelievable uh what they have
[1:37:20] walking all through the little rooms and
[1:37:23] and everything we even get to the the
[1:37:25] little spot I don't know what's the name
[1:37:26] of that cine chapel and uh they got a a
[1:37:30] picture of of God uh touching the the
[1:37:32] finger of Adam on the on the ceiling and
[1:37:36] when they when you go in you can't take
[1:37:37] pictures and you can't and they just
[1:37:39] rushing everybody in like cattle just
[1:37:41] everybody in move to the middle of the
[1:37:42] floor move to the middle of floor now
[1:37:43] get out of here so the next group can
[1:37:45] get in and we all moving in there and
[1:37:48] and you got to move in real quick and my
[1:37:50] daughter uh Rebecca she like you know
[1:37:52] okay she just moving she just moving she
[1:37:55] and she moving so much that she moved
[1:37:57] out and forgot to look
[1:38:00] up all that time that we don't walked
[1:38:03] through all this and she didn't look up
[1:38:05] to see the actual picture ah you got and
[1:38:09] and now we can't go back into it again
[1:38:12] we got we I mean got to get another tour
[1:38:14] at another at at a later date but
[1:38:17] we but she got to live off our memory
[1:38:20] right but but but there was there was
[1:38:22] there was there was I mean I mean it was
[1:38:24] just it was just so much to to absorb
[1:38:27] there at the Vatican so much to absorb
[1:38:31] um as we're leaving the city going to
[1:38:34] our cruise
[1:38:36] ship we driving down the highway and we
[1:38:39] notice that
[1:38:41] uh on every
[1:38:45] exit there's a prostitute at the
[1:38:50] exit what is this every exit ex it every
[1:38:55] exit so when I started thinking about
[1:38:58] that said now wait a
[1:39:00] minute this place is the
[1:39:03] mother of
[1:39:04] harlots and I mean in the
[1:39:08] natural cuz the natural always tight the
[1:39:12] spiritual in the natural they had
[1:39:15] harlots all up and down the
[1:39:21] exits now let's look at the spiritual
[1:39:24] part of this the mother of harlots cuz
[1:39:26] most denominational churches what we
[1:39:29] call Protestant
[1:39:31] groups well we know Revelation 17
[1:39:34] dealing
[1:39:35] with uh the Catholic
[1:39:37] church but according to Revelation
[1:39:41] 175 the Catholic Church got some
[1:39:46] daughters sir and and these daughters
[1:39:49] are what we call harlots
[1:39:53] she's the great but she got
[1:39:56] harlots which are daughters which is
[1:39:59] every other denominational church amen
[1:40:02] hallelujah anything that goes back to
[1:40:05] denominational stand versus standing on
[1:40:07] the word of God is against the word of
[1:40:10] God Amen Hallelujah I don't care if they
[1:40:13] do change the name cuz you know nowadays
[1:40:15] they done took the Baptist off their
[1:40:17] name
[1:40:19] oh they done took Baptist off and now
[1:40:21] they just got these generic names
[1:40:24] and you just think you're going to this
[1:40:25] generic church that's a mega church but
[1:40:28] they got Baptist
[1:40:29] Doctrine Oh My My My anything that'll go
[1:40:33] against the word of God is Antichrist
[1:40:36] sir let me keep
[1:40:39] reading Oh Glory to
[1:40:42] God
[1:40:45] uh I'm going to the quote now and why
[1:40:48] I'm against organized religion and this
[1:40:50] is where we we get back to Revelation 18
[1:40:55] um here in a
[1:40:56] second oh my look at now look at brother
[1:41:00] brandom he makes a comment here we're
[1:41:02] looking through a prophetic lens it
[1:41:06] says now look immediately after her
[1:41:09] sin her Secrets was discovered we've had
[1:41:13] we've had that a long time ago we know
[1:41:15] it now the next chapter look at
[1:41:17] Revelation
[1:41:18] 18 says may I just turn to it
[1:41:21] just a minute
[1:41:24] it might be a good thing it won't take
[1:41:26] us but just a few minutes longer and it
[1:41:29] might mean a little something to you I
[1:41:31] hope it
[1:41:32] does it says now um we see here in the
[1:41:36] 17th chapter the fifth verse so he he's
[1:41:38] going back to what we just read it says
[1:41:41] uh upon her forehead was the name
[1:41:43] written mystery Babylon the great the
[1:41:45] mother of harlot's the abomination of
[1:41:47] the earth and watched and I saw the
[1:41:50] woman which is the church drunk with the
[1:41:53] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[1:41:56] of the martyrs so that's if you would
[1:41:57] have kept if we' have kept reading verse
[1:41:59] 6 you would have saw that there he says
[1:42:01] blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw
[1:42:03] her I wondered with great ad admiration
[1:42:06] see seeing her she was such a great
[1:42:09] beautiful thing and she was the mother
[1:42:10] of
[1:42:13] prostitutes
[1:42:14] prostitute
[1:42:17] religion now see that that take it a
[1:42:19] little deeper your religion is a
[1:42:21] prostitute
[1:42:29] Hallelujah now ain't too many men that
[1:42:32] would want to marry a
[1:42:34] prostitute is the truth in high amen I
[1:42:37] know in in Hosea he was told a mared
[1:42:39] prostitute but ain't too many men you
[1:42:41] know now now let me just tell you Hosea
[1:42:44] had to be told by God to do
[1:42:50] that cu the average man ain't going to
[1:42:53] ain't going to marry a
[1:42:54] prostitute praise God hallelujah amen
[1:42:59] the average woman don't even want her
[1:43:00] girl hanging with
[1:43:03] prostitutes why because Spirits get off
[1:43:06] on you and if your daughter hanging with
[1:43:08] the prostitute next thing you know your
[1:43:10] daughter might become a prostitute and
[1:43:13] the average woman don't want her
[1:43:14] daughter to have that type of
[1:43:16] reputation that's in the natural sir why
[1:43:19] is it so why we feel so comfortable
[1:43:24] hanging spiritually with
[1:43:32] prostitutes I'm just reading the
[1:43:35] Bible I'm going a little
[1:43:38] further glory to God see this is a come

[1:43:43] have to preach in a way you realize
[1:43:45] where you at is not good you got to come
[1:43:48] out and God is God is actually making a
[1:43:50] way of Escape for you to get out of that
[1:43:53] amen all right let me go on he says uh
[1:43:57] and I saw the woman Church drunk with
[1:44:00] the blood of saints and with the blood
[1:44:01] of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw I
[1:44:03] wondered with great admiration see
[1:44:05] seeing her such a great beautiful thing
[1:44:07] and she was the mother of prostitutes
[1:44:08] prostitute religion denominations
[1:44:11] exactly what she did see because they
[1:44:14] injected dogmas just like she did now
[1:44:17] look at the revelations now that's the
[1:44:20] 17th chapter ends up with the 18th verse

[1:44:37] these things after her mystery was
[1:44:40] discovered after we understood what
[1:44:41] Revelation 17 was all about after her

[1:45:15] something before brother brandom
[1:45:17] preached that the the Catholic church
[1:45:19] was in Revelation 17 there was people
[1:45:21] preaching that for years
[1:45:23] before brother Brandon preached it that
[1:45:25] was no that was no new uh startling
[1:45:28] Revelation most denominational churches
[1:45:30] understood that most of them understood
[1:45:33] now whether they still agree with it or
[1:45:34] not they they understood and they were
[1:45:36] preaching that by themselves but notice
[1:45:38] the the Fulfillment of scripture after
[1:45:41] this has been made known who Revelation
[1:45:43] 17 is God sends down a messenger that's
[1:45:48] right oh glory to God watch it now watch
[1:45:50] it watch it now even though they they
[1:45:53] could preach
[1:45:58] it there you go sis they could preach it

[1:46:27] keep reading here it says uh here comes
[1:46:30] the messenger here comes another
[1:46:32] messenger coming down next chapter her
[1:46:34] mystery was discovered now this is this
[1:46:37] is now the discovery of a mystery and
[1:46:39] her children's mystery oh look at that
[1:46:43] who she is and who her children is who
[1:46:45] are children the denominational churches
[1:46:47] now now now I can make it very plain
[1:46:51] because I don't want to go nobody h
[1:46:53] Luther came out of the Catholic Church
[1:46:57] nailed his 95 thesis to the wall he saw
[1:47:00] things that were afterward and he came
[1:47:01] out the problem was is that the people
[1:47:04] that followed Luther created another
[1:47:08] denomination Wesley came out of
[1:47:12] Luther he saw all the fallacies and what
[1:47:14] Luther then was doing he said no no it's
[1:47:16] it's going to take some sanctification
[1:47:17] you just can't no you going have to live
[1:47:19] better than that right he he said he
[1:47:21] said no no it's going to be more so he
[1:47:22] saw that but after Wesley left guess
[1:47:24] what happened the people that followed
[1:47:26] Wesley out created another
[1:47:31] denomination that was the Methodist
[1:47:33] church Lutheran Church Methodist Church
[1:47:37] I'm giving you a little history and then
[1:47:39] what happened after that the Pentecost
[1:47:41] was come along say no uhuh no we can't
[1:47:42] no we want to see the gifts restored
[1:47:44] back to we want justification we want
[1:47:46] sanctification we want the gifts back in
[1:47:48] the church they start praying God
[1:47:51] visited them on ausa Street
[1:47:55] Reed Pentecostal church was birth the
[1:47:59] gifts were back in the church they came
[1:48:00] out and left that only problem was they
[1:48:03] denominated and when they denominated
[1:48:05] got left what it happened then the word
[1:48:08] came forth and if you will notice in
[1:48:10] this whole journey on uh get back and
[1:48:13] step I'm spending more time on the
[1:48:15] fourth stage than I did on the other
[1:48:18] stages because um this is the stage that
[1:48:20] we're at this is where the word
[1:48:23] has come to set us free amen amen oh my
[1:48:27] God my God my God and let me tell you
[1:48:29] something about this word that we have
[1:48:31] now it will never be denominated amen
[1:48:39] amen I might as well be honest with you
[1:48:43] I've seen many try to rise up and create
[1:48:45] a
[1:48:46] denomination every time they do it you
[1:48:48] just give it a few years it falls apart
[1:48:52] I'm seeing it time and time and time
[1:48:55] again Hallelujah we get these these
[1:48:57] preachers where it's us for no more if
[1:49:00] you ain't preaching what I preach then
[1:49:02] you can't preach you get that yeah you
[1:49:04] get that type of spirit and and and some
[1:49:07] some of the younger ministers nowadays

[1:49:10] want to be a part of us for no more if
[1:49:12] you keep inviting me all the time on who
[1:49:14] are other ministers you know that you
[1:49:16] can get to come here praise the Lord
[1:49:19] amen cuz we don't want that type of
[1:49:20] spirit we don't want to be associated
[1:49:22] with that
[1:49:24] Oh Glory to God church I'm I'm trying to
[1:49:27] get I'm trying to get here I got a few
[1:49:29] things to just just share and uh I'm I'm

[1:49:34] you look at this what he says now it
[1:49:36] says
[1:49:39] um her mystery was discovered now this
[1:49:42] is now discovery of mystery and her
[1:49:44] children's mystery so you understand now
[1:49:46] exactly what made her a harlot because
[1:49:50] she committed adultery against God's
[1:49:52] word
[1:49:54] and that's what made her an organization
[1:49:57] she couldn't stay a bible church and
[1:50:00] accept that right and neither can any
[1:50:03] organization that don't take every word
[1:50:05] of it amen the way is wrote I'm telling
[1:50:10] you as soon as you see a woman preacher
[1:50:11] walk up you already know they off the
[1:50:13] word ain't no sense even trying to
[1:50:15] figure out is this where God lead me no
[1:50:17] God ain't leading you there no God ain't
[1:50:20] LED you there you still homos get up in
[1:50:23] the pullit and start God didn't lead you
[1:50:27] there I'm going just be I you know we
[1:50:30] got to stop putting things on God yes
[1:50:33] God God God God Made You In His Image in
[1:50:36] his likeness so you got to be able to
[1:50:39] make some decisions based on his
[1:50:44] word let me keep reading I'm I'm coming
[1:50:47] I'm coming uh he says um she couldn't
[1:50:50] stay a bible church and accept that
[1:50:52] neither can any organization that don't
[1:50:53] take every word of it the way it's wrote
[1:50:56] ever be a bible church and there's none
[1:50:58] of them that way that I know nothing
[1:51:01] that I know anything about not a one so
[1:51:03] there she as soon as she organizes the
[1:51:05] things she does both by scripture and by
[1:51:08] evidence she dies right there she
[1:51:09] accepts the Dogma now look now now
[1:51:13] that's what happened now look at this
[1:51:15] God sent in this 18th chapter a mighty
[1:51:21] angel
[1:51:23] sir after that mystery was known a
[1:51:27] mighty angel or a
[1:51:30] messenger watch here now he's reading

[1:51:37] it right here actually you know what
[1:51:39] leave the quote there he he's I just I'm
[1:51:40] just telling you what he's reading if
[1:51:41] you want to follow in your Bible you can
[1:51:43] but he's reading Revelation 181 1-4 it
[1:51:46] says this after these things and and I
[1:51:48] like to read it because brother brandom
[1:51:51] also gives us his
[1:51:53] commentary while we're reading
[1:51:56] it glory to God after these things I saw
[1:52:00] another Angel come down from heaven with
[1:52:02] great power and the Earth was lightened

[2:01:40] and a hold of every foul spirit and a
[2:01:43] cage of every unclean and hateful
[2:01:47] bird brother brandom gives us something
[2:01:50] that uh many of us can identify with
[2:01:54] because we happen to be
[2:01:56] people that were in that cage some of us
[2:01:59] come from these cage of unclean and and
[2:02:01] hateful Birds hate the message and
[2:02:04] people actually hate it and hate you

[2:05:56] thank you I'm going down to paragraph uh
[2:06:00] 218 but before I do that I want to just
[2:06:03] I want to leave you a a
[2:06:05] scripture I I'm I'm telling you
[2:06:07] Revelation
[2:06:09] 18 after these things after after the
[2:06:11] mystery of of who the Catholic church is
[2:06:14] and who her daughters
[2:06:15] are she's the mother of harlots who her
[2:06:18] daughters are you know after that's been
[2:06:19] made known God sends an angel down with
[2:06:21] a message to come out that message is
[2:06:23] calling us out and it's calling us out
[2:06:25] to bring us back to the word
[2:06:29] amen I'm looking you might be looking at
[2:06:31] that like well brother Jack how can you
[2:06:33] say that this is this angel that God is
[2:06:35] sending down verse verse 4 Revelation
[2:06:38] 18:4 I heard another voice from Heaven
[2:06:42] saying come out of her my people that
[2:06:44] you be uh be not partakers of her sins
[2:06:46] and that you receive not of her plagues
[2:06:48] uh how can you say this angel that was
[2:06:50] sitting down in verse one is a
[2:06:52] man I want to give
[2:06:55] you Galatians
[2:06:58] 4:14 these little keys to help you in
[2:07:01] your Bible Galatians
[2:07:03] 4 and 14 this is Paul writing in the
[2:07:08] book of Galatians and he says this and
[2:07:10] my
[2:07:12] Temptations which was in my
[2:07:15] flesh ye despise not nor reject
[2:07:19] it but receive received
[2:07:24] me Paul's a
[2:07:26] man Paul's a bookend Messenger right
[2:07:30] Paul writes in his in his own letter you
[2:07:33] receive
[2:07:34] me as an angel of God even as Christ
[2:07:41] Jesus so if Paul can call himself an
[2:07:44] angel a man on the earth an angel then
[2:07:49] we can also see the same thing for the
[2:07:51] book in messenger a man that has come
[2:07:54] down from God to the Earth as an angel
[2:07:59] amen Revelation 3:14 called him an angel
[2:08:01] yes sir Revelation 10:7 called him an
[2:08:03] angel Revelation 18 is calling him an
[2:08:07] angel
[2:08:11] amen amen let me just give you one more
[2:08:16] quote I'mma y'all I'mma tell y'all my
[2:08:18] secret I usually try not to preach over
[2:08:21] hour and 15 minutes to y'all that's my
[2:08:23] secret and the reason I do that because
[2:08:27] um there is so much here you cannot get
[2:08:31] it all in one setting now I've already
[2:08:34] gone over my time but y'all y'all gave
[2:08:36] me Freedom last week and the week before
[2:08:38] to just keep preaching y'all told me
[2:08:39] that but but I'm always mindful I I
[2:08:42] we've had preachers I was telling
[2:08:43] somebody I had a preacher come here I
[2:08:45] had a couple preachers come and they
[2:08:46] came on a Friday night Friday night
[2:08:48] Friday night we all tired we woke out
[2:08:51] and the pre preacher came and he
[2:08:52] preached 3
[2:08:57] hours I think they only came
[2:09:01] [Applause]
[2:09:04] once let's
[2:09:11] read I'm in paragraph 218
[2:09:15] okay now when when I'm when I'm reading
[2:09:18] this paragraph I'm I'm actually
[2:09:22] uh I'm actually looking at Revelation
[2:09:26] 181 where it says that this this a the
[2:09:29] he had he having great p uh and and
[2:09:32] after these things I saw another Angel
[2:09:34] come down from heaven having great power
[2:09:36] and the Earth was lighten with his glory
[2:09:39] now let's look at this in Revelation uh
[2:09:42] in in this in this message why I'm not
[2:09:44] why why I'm against organized religion
[2:09:47] notice this is the angel of Light
[2:09:52] remember the last Angel is the angel in
[2:09:56] the church age to the L de sea now when
[2:09:57] he makes that comment that connects it
[2:09:59] to Revelation
[2:10:01] 3:14 also connects it to Revelation
[2:10:05] 107 okay he not just making these
[2:10:08] comments they're connected to scriptures
[2:10:10] all right it says it's the layer to see
[2:10:12] a messenger it's the last because the
[2:10:15] very next chapter is the 19th Chapter
[2:10:17] which is the coming
[2:10:20] bride and this is in the scripture the
[2:10:23] last angel that came to bring light
[2:10:25] before the coming of the
[2:10:28] Bride oh this is beautiful to me before
[2:10:31] the coming of the Bride to meet Christ
[2:10:33] it was the lean Church H then what was
[2:10:36] the Ley in church age messenger calling
[2:10:40] them
[2:10:41] out of Babylon look at this now look
[2:10:45] churches caught in her cage with
[2:10:49] her with her dogmas denying the word and
[2:10:53] accepting
[2:10:54] dogmas see and this why when people say
[2:10:57] you think just the people in the message
[2:10:59] now look I'm just going to be honest
[2:11:00] with you you can't be in a cage full of
[2:11:02] unclean birds and think you're going to
[2:11:04] be
[2:11:07] clean man amen church is caught in her
[2:11:11] cage with her with her dogmas denying
[2:11:13] the word and accepting dogmas this is
[2:11:15] the angel of Light to the Lan church
[2:11:18] that had rejected Christ and his word
[2:11:20] for Dogma I mean for dogma and that put
[2:11:23] him on out put him outside and he stood
[2:11:25] at the
[2:11:27] door knocking trying to get in see see
[2:11:31] it the church age had rejected the
[2:11:34] Christ and Christ is the word and had uh
[2:11:36] and and and and and had rejected outside
[2:11:39] he was on the outside the only church
[2:11:42] age that we have of Christ on the
[2:11:44] outside knocking trying to get in and
[2:11:47] this Angel's
[2:11:49] message messenger come from God was
[2:11:53] echoing his message on the earth to come
[2:11:56] out of
[2:11:58] Babylon exactly what we just read in
[2:12:00] Revelation
[2:12:01] 18:4 come out of the organization look
[2:12:04] at this now the Holy Spirit
[2:12:08] today cuz see brother brandham is
[2:12:10] gone his ministry is already done but
[2:12:13] yet he did exactly what God wanted him
[2:12:15] to do he came with the message to call
[2:12:17] us out of Babylon amen amen look at this
[2:12:21] now it says but the Holy Spirit today oh
[2:12:25] my my my the manifestation of the holy
[2:12:30] spirit is that angel trying to get the
[2:12:34] people back to the word because the holy
[2:12:37] spirit will only vindicate the word what
[2:12:40] is this what is what what are we saying
[2:12:41] here as we continue to preach this
[2:12:44] message as we continue to Echo what the
[2:12:47] prophet said the Holy Spirit today my
[2:12:50] God my God is that angel still
[2:12:55] manifesting Revelation 18:4 and it's
[2:12:58] through this message that we're
[2:12:59] preaching today we're still saying it
[2:13:01] again come out of her amen come out of
[2:13:06] her my
[2:13:07] people you know I mean no brother brand

[2:13:16] is calling amen come out oh they were
[2:13:19] calling in noise they come in come in
[2:13:22] come in but today we calling come out

[2:13:29] Jesus wants to
[2:13:31] call come up come up amen yes sir come
[2:13:36] up but if you can't hear the
[2:13:39] voice to come out like that little
[2:13:42] chicken I mean little Eagle amongst them

[2:13:47] out you'll never hear the voice come up
[2:13:50] when that little eag
[2:13:52] heard mama say put them Wings together

[2:14:37] today the manifestation of the holy
[2:14:40] spirit is that angel trying to get the

[2:15:34] already been fulfilled I hope you can
