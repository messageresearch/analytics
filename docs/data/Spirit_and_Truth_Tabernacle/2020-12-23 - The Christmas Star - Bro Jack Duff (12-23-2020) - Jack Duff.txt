all about and you know and i and i just i thought to myself you know i know that we were going to try to put together a little program tonight and that didn't work out but that didn't mean that we couldn't come and just worship him a little bit right amen um the one of the greatest things uh i mean the world doesn't realize he wasn't born you know on christmas day but uh still when they when we

christ the lord hallelujah thank you jesus bless it be his holy name my god my god amen um tell you what i will just read a quick scripture here [Music] um you know this is uh maybe i'll just read from matthew 2. um let me just see something here you know i'll save that for a little later but um you know this is this is what it's all about and let's i think it's luke 2 that i want to read uh initially um but i think it's important that we just take time [Music] and [Music] just reflect on what happened some 2000 years ago um we gotta always keep this in mind amen when we get to this season here in luke luke two i just wanna read and this is just the the christmas story [Music] and just reading from verse verse one i was telling brother quentin a little earlier it's not often that we even take too many sermons really on the birth of the lord jesus and i said you know what tonight would be a good time just to take a little thought and just kind of talk about what happened you know during that time and and um just just reflect on what god did for us when he left us thrown in glory to come bring to us redemption story [Music] amen this is probably um i think so many people just we we we we we get so wrapped up and we just forget what the real what the what it's really all about right and and i just want us to just kind of go back and just look at this here the verse in chapter 2 says and it came to pass in those days it went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and i was just thinking about this as we were reading from psalms [Music] 148 and it talked about how [Music] god is even in the midst of a storm and this is a storm condition that mary and joseph find themselves in i mean she's in her third trimester she's on the back getting us getting herself ready to get on the back of a donkey to go and give birth i mean to go back to the city in which they were originally from and didn't realize that that time should give birth she knew she was close to it but this was a very difficult time for her to be traveling but yet she was following the decree of the leader of that day a stormy condition come in their life but yet the word of god is being fulfilled look at this verse 2 says in this tax it was first made when cyrenius was governor syria all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the household and lineage of david to be taxed with mary as a spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and that question still presents itself tonight does god still have room amen to dwell in your heart praise the lord does god still have room have we made room for him have we have we made time for him praise the lord there was no room for them in the end there were the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them in the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore freed the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people amen for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel multitude of the heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory to god in the highest on earth peace good will toward men that came to pass as the angels were going away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us he came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen and it was told unto them amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word um i'll let you be seated just for amen uh for the time being thank you musicians i really appreciate you all um making yourselves available tonight it was just in my heart just to come tonight and amen just offer just a little christmas worship you know just uh some songs that cause us to reflect about our lord and savior's birth amen and um i will read another scripture here in a second but i did want to just kind of take a not much of your time just a little thought here uh tonight on the christmas star and man we'll just uh title this the christmas star um we are we just had a tremendous uh something happen there um i guess it was the 21st which would be monday night um where the planet of i believe jupiter and saturn they in the in in the in the uh when you look at it in the sky at night it seemed like they had become one like you could only see uh one uh one planet they were they were passing uh one another and they called it the uh the great conjunction right and as they were passing one another uh it looked as if it was just one one big bright star but actually was it was they're two planets and they're they're still very far away from one another but yet uh a lot of people are looking at this as some great sign you know and and um i had to be very careful i was you know just trying to figure out what was going on because i know that you know signs um do happen god uses you know things in in the uh the heavens declares glory you know so we know god can use those things but uh you know you have to be careful when you're researching things like that because uh astrologers get a hold of that information and they will have you for thrown for some loops right so you have to be very very careful uh but there was you know a little something that i that i found and and they were just making a statement that you know sometimes when things like this happen they said this hadn't happened uh the way it happened uh for us in like 800 years that that hadn't happened and also there were some sites saying that they believed that this is the same type of event that would have occurred uh when the lord jesus was actually being born you know they they believe that uh people have all kind of things you know uh that they believe in we're not you know we can't put confidence in a lot of that we just put our confidence in the word of god and uh you know what we do know is that um the wise men did see a star amen i'm gonna read a couple quotes for you here tonight the wise men did see a star not only that brother branham told us that mary and joseph saw a star praise the lord amen and and uh and i can tell you tonight uh while everybody else is outside they actually called this great conjunction they actually call it the christmas star right that's what that's what they call it now uh that and and they're unfortunately many of them are uh looking at things and they're tying the birth of the lord jesus into you know this star showing but we with revelation know that jesus was not born on december 25th amen we realized that so you know uh we don't we can't put a lot of weight in things like that but we realize he wasn't born on december 25th our lord and savior was born in the springtime because that's when all lambs are born amen that's when all lambs are born so you know but i wanted to just kind of bring it back to you know i i know the the the uh the the i would say just uh the world you know because this this passing of saturn and and uh and jupiter you know um this i mean like everybody all over the world had the ability to be able to see it you know i mean no matter where you were if there was nothing hindering your vision uh you had the ability to be able to see this so this was this was something very special and uh you know i said mary and joseph saw the star amen the wise men saw the star but i also want to say that we have seen a start praise god amen one of the stars that was in the hand of jesus according to the book of revelation chapter one we saw a star amen and and the purpose of a star is actually to point you to jesus praise the lord amen the the star is not to bring you to themselves but the stars actually to bring you into the presence of the lord jesus hallelujah amen so so we have seen a star and and and and one of the things that i guess that um uh i i i wish that you know the way everybody took out their telescopes and everybody uh took out their binoculars you know and you know some could see it just with the naked eye they would stand outside and they would look at this what they call the christmas star they would look at it and and they would just uh observe it and you know just be take their pictures and post their pictures and you know and everybody saw the star good god almighty and i would just i would i guess the thing that that that gets in my spirits like i wish they could see the other star amen that i that i saw hallelujah that they could see the star according to revelation chapter one amen because once you can see that then you can see more about god amen then you can understand more about god so you know i just i just i you know i look at how everybody uh is just so excited and one of the things that you know i heard that someone said uh i was reading this and they said you know when this this this this conjunction happens this great conjunction see a lot of things begin to change on the earth and they say one of the things that changes is a cultural shift that's what they said now i don't know i i mean i i i don't have any scripture to support anything they say i'm just telling you what they say but one of them that says a cultural shift praise the lord amen and and uh they they say sometimes when this happens it is a change in administration amen government administration right you know so um we got a lot going on in our nation and and i'm gonna tell you it seems like the whole world is watching what is happening here in the united states of america praise the lord and i mean as i talk to different people it's i've never seen a nation divided the way it's divided now i mean i've never seen people get so upset that they will not accept the results of the election amen i mean their churches praying for a reversal oh my god i mean fasting and praying for a reversal of the election my god right and and we don't we don't realize that you know this this world our our leaders amen are not our saviors and let me put it it's not our savior we don't have saviors we got one savior his name is jesus amen so our leaders are not our savior so you know no political party can stop anything but they said that star represents a cultural shift hallelujah and i mentioned this before that uh you know when we already know that certain parties stand for certain things the reason people would pay pray is because they don't want to see certain things go forth in the country i realize that i don't want to see it either glory to god i don't want to see it either every time i talk to somebody and you know they they so excited about this change of administration i say now you realize jesus did say praise the lord as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so when i come to realize i can't pray against scripture amen amen i i can't pray i have to accept scripture i don't accept sin but i do accept scripture and in order for you know in order for hallelujah to the lamb of god in order for us to go on a rapture amen these conditions must be do you realize that when it got so bad down in sodom god sent two angels down to bring his bring his elect out and actually i mean lot was a make-believer and if god was so concerned about abraham's prayer at a time like that that he would bring lot out then what do you think how do you think god thinks about us so i tell you what i'm looking for amen not just a cultural shift amen i'm looking for a heavenly shift praise god as the culture shifts amen i'm looking for the bride to be elevated and taken to another level in christ get closer and closer to him church i'm looking for that body change one of these years we're going to step into it amen it's going to be the last year for the bride on the earth because there's a rapture awaiting us hallelujah so i you know i want to just read a couple quotes here and amen you know they they they have what they're looking at is their christmas star this this this conjunction of amen they call it a great conjunction because i believe these are the two largest planets saturn and and uh and jupiter but uh you know and they're looking at all of that but you know that that's that's hallelujah you know if they get something out of it that's fine but i'm looking at the word of god amen so here you know the prophet makes a statement i'm going to this message church of the living god the church of the living god and it says um when alone came the virgin born divine son of god and he was god's provided lamb provided sacrifice jehovah jireh the provided one and as he was born and the people of that day of his day especially the religious people did not believe him because he never come in a classical way that they expected him but he came humble born in a manger wrapped in swaddling cloth there was no singing at his birth hallelujah notice this there was no singing at his birth and there is a king's uh and he says um and as there is a king's birth so when kings are born the people typically sing right but here the king of kings has been born and there's no singing at his birth hallelujah that's why i like to come to the house of god and like to offer my christmas praise hallelujah i like to sing for him amen glory to god amen and i'm gonna tell you i don't need a lot of people i can do this all by myself amen i like to just bring my gift the one that he gave me i like to present that to him hallelujah i want to sing for my king amen glory to god amen amen so it says this says uh as there is uh as there is a king's birth mortals when a king is born the people sing and have jubilee oh my so when a mortal king is born amen the people sing and have a jubilee what about the king of kings we should we should be doing more than having a jubilee glory to god amen amen we should be in heavenly places at this time hallelujah glory to god say he says mortals when the king is born the people sing and have jubilee but there was no king no people to sing at this king's birth but the angels came down and sang to the shepherds and the city of david is born christ the savior and uh and as we were just reading that uh you know they the angels announce to the shepherd and say you know uh um uh there's a there's a a child that's been born in the city of david and uh you know i was i was just kind of looking at something i was looking at the internet i was like you know what is what what is the city of david what do they you know what do they call the city of david and many of them on the internet was saying city of david was jerusalem and uh now we just read in the scripture here out of luke 2 it said the city of david which is called bethlehem right which is called bethlehem so so these these uh shepherds had it right because when an angel announced city of david the the shepherds knew to go to bethlehem hallelujah go to bethlehem and it was purpose for them going to bethlehem because there was scriptures promised that he would be born in bethlehem my god there was one scripture here that we'll just pull up uh out of a micah praise the lord i think it's micah chapter 2 micah 5 and verse 2 micah 5 2 this is a scripture amen that promised that he was going to be born in bethlehem so the angels knew exactly where to send those shepherds amen hallelujah it says but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruling israel whose goings forth have been from from of old from everlasting so here is a promise that christ would be born in bethlehem so those aims i mean the angels told the uh the shepherds you'll find them in the city of david so they say let's go to bethlehem not jerusalem and people today still think bethlehem is jerusalem no no no the bible actually told us that amen uh i'm sorry they think bethlehem is the city of david but i think jerusalem is the city of david but the bible tells us bethlehem was the city of david and the and the and the the the shepherds knew that and and i just say even if they had caught a revelation they knew where to go to find christ the king praise the name of the lord they knew where to go hallelujah now i want to pick up uh just another uh little quote here from the prophet this is out of the message god uh god's wrap gift god's wrap gift and what he's given us in this particular quote what he's sharing with us is and i love just brother branham had a gift to uh make the story real right i mean the way he describes him sometimes you can tell whether he was looking at a vision or what you just didn't know but he had a gift to be able to make the story real make it very real now he's giving us uh he's picking up joseph and mary and as they're leaving because of the issue of taxation and they're going to the city of his birth amen uh brother branham just kind of picking up their journey and he's he's going to just give us some information here about what this was like so hearing the message god's wrap gift it says joseph must have said something like this says mary dear just think just beyond the city on the north side that's where ruth the moabite gleaned yonder in the fields of boaz yonder just beyond that up or up over the mountain yonder is where david with the slingshot took the lion to the ground and pulled the sheep from his mouth must have been there that where joshua stood that stood here with his gleaming sword the fearless warrior of our people and divided the lands and give this inheritance to the tribe of judah to which we are lineage to my see he's identifying himself amen and um uh with this lineage all these overcomers uh when i was in israel there one time we were driving down a highway and and um and uh you know as we were driving by they uh uh when joshua spoke uh spoke to i can't think of the name of the city right now that he spoke huh say that again agilent yeah so as we as we're driving by here's the name of the city agilent and i'm looking and and the two guys say that's where uh joshua spoke you know sun stand still moon hangover agilent i say oh my goodness i mean just something just rise up in you that man that's that's where it took place my god you know i mean you become one with uh with the scripture amen when you hear testimonies like that this is what joseph and and mary this is their discussion that they're on the way a man back into the city of bethlehem look at this he says um uh it says we are lineage too and at different things of and of how that he must have been explaining to her what taken place all these testimonies just my just we did this d this one did that this one did this and we parted that family lineage hallelujah glory to god you know i mean in order to be a christian you got to be identified with every bible character amen you are part of that lineage part of a lineage of overcomers amen hallelujah to the lamb of god amen and some of the people in your family don't overcome some insurmountable things praise god if they could do it amen i want to tell you that that overcoming gene is dwelling inside of you praise god amen look it says uh and then to hear no sound from behind him he must have turned to look to see if she was still sitting on the rock because she's pregnant in a third trimester right he want to turn and look and and i like the way the prophet said he says uh joseph when he took her off to maybe the the donkey uh you know and just said hey mary sit down on this rock and just get some rest just sit down on the rock amen and get some rest and while he's talking to her you know just look over here mary look over there mary this happened over there and this happened over there and we're part of that lineage mary my god hallelujah said mary look at this look at that and i and and and i love it so he made us sit on the rock hallelujah i thought to myself we need to actually sit on the rock amen what is the rock the rock of revelation we need to just sit on the rock don't move don't don't be moved this way or that way just sit on the rock sit on the rock of revelation glory to god amen so as as as they're sitting there the prophet says this he says um uh to see if she was still sitting on the rock and when he turned and seen her pretty face turned towards the skies he didn't have to ask anymore because the reflection of the star was looking back through her eyes he knew she was looking at something i want to i just need to ask you what you're looking at tonight amen he knew mary was looking at something something caught her attention that's why she couldn't respond to joseph i mean i mean she can't hear the conversation but but you know uh as uh as he was talking about their lineage and all the people that they would came to it what this one did and what that one did my it elevated mary mary kind of came i mean she couldn't even think no more about what he was saying because she was looking at something else something else that was getting ready to happen on that night look at it now look at he says uh because the reflection of the star was looking back through her eyes he knew she was looking at something and she looked at him said joseph have you noticed the star hanging yonder and when he looked in in a surprise say i hadn't noticed it before dear well it's been following us ever since the sun went down my god i've watched it it must mean something glory to god because i have the most wonderful feeling glory glory glory amen i have the most wonderful feeling you know god does things like that sometimes for his people shows us the light or some way that we can know that he's near and he's on the scene i remember a sister one time going through a little trial and amen and and uh and as she was going through the trial looked up in the start in the sky and she kind of saw this cloud amen and uh and when she saw the cloud uh it just began to bring an encouragement to her it began to bring a strength to her and she would ask other people do you see that cloud do you see that like no i don't really see it well it wasn't for them they didn't need the encouragement hallelujah to the lamb of god they didn't need them because god was dealing directly with her amen and sometimes god would do that with you somebody was just sharing with me a dream that they had you know recently and and uh in the dream they uh if i recall correctly uh they were they were they would look up in the sky and they said uh the uh the portals of heaven are open and they would tell people say can't you see it they're walking along with people like look up and the portals are having an open and an anointed come down and and they just feel the power of god and just kept telling people the portals of heaven open seemed like nobody recognized it but her hallelujah amen and then finally you know the anointing got so great that she was down on the ground and somebody had to help lift her up and maybe somebody else come along a little she said they say what's going to say can't you see the portals of heaven are open i say i say now it seemed like what god did was give you that dream specifically for yourself i say but since you told it to me since you told it to me i'm gonna claim the porters of heaven are open amen and since the porters are heaven open because he told me he gonna rebuke to the vow for my sake he said he gonna open up the windows the portals of heaven and pour me out a blessing where i have room not enough to receive so since you told it to me i am declaring for myself the portals of heaven are open sometimes god gives you things just for you but once they're shared it's for somebody else hallelujah hallelujah amen glory to god it says uh uh uh he says uh he knew she was looking at something let me see where i'm at um okay you know god does things like that sometimes for his people shows us a life or some way that we can know that he's near and he's on the scene no matter what the world has to say or do he's still there and everything will be all right he just witnesses back by the holy spirit that we can feel it i love that sometimes you need encouragement like that and god will just do it just for you just for you he says and joseph might have said something like this mary you know what i've never been so happy in all my life when i've been drove around by the roman government but yet i have never been so happy as i am right now and i don't know why it seems like there's a sacredness over the little city tonight where we roamed when we were boys and girls back in our teenage and school age it says way into the east and many hundreds of miles away from there the magi was already on their road they'd seen his star and was coming to worship god's little gift package now so the same time mary and joseph are seeing this christmas star amen the magi are also singing and already packed can you get it oh the prophet is saying that they when they saw it they was already packed and coming oh hallelujah amen i'ma tell you when when god show you something you need to get in a hurry about it amen don't don't don't don't procrastinate my god amen procrastination will cause you to miss the rapture right so so don't procrastinate when god shows you something get in action quickly amen they were already packed and and actually i'mma put it this way i preached a sermon some years ago unpacking getting ready to go because most time we pack stuff when we get ready to take a trip we pack this and we packed that and we put this in the suitcase and we put that in but no on this on this trip to glory we need to unpack we need to take some stuff out of our lives amen we need to take some stuff out of our suitcase anything that is weighing you down unpack it and get ready to go glory to god here the prophet goes on to say way into these many hundreds of miles away from there the magi was already on the road they see this star and was coming to worship god's little gift package that he was sending to the world just a little while from there and the world was going to receive his greatest gift that it ever received a little package wrapped up a a little a first little christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world hallelujah god's god wrapped it up and he said now i want you to notice uh brother branham is preaching this in 1960 and it's on a christmas day it's a christmas day praise the lord and i just love the way he kind of brings all these things in because the you know the world doesn't have the right understanding as to when our lord and savior was born and and that's fine brother brandon made a statement he said um even though it's pagan it's here to stay we're not going to be able to change it it's december 25th but if we can take the opportunity and try to get somebody to see what this was really all about even though they did it all they they started out worshiping the sun god and then they then they tried to bring in the son of god with the sun god worshiped and that's how we got december 25th as jesus birthday it's here to stay pagan took it over but let's try to bring people back to scripture as to what really happened there all right all right man if they if the wise men saw that star that day and we can get people to see the star that we see today lord have mercy oh what a change all right i'm going on in this quote it says um the first little christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world god wrapped it up i want to break in on my thought and say this the greatest thing ever was wrapped in human flesh uh was was wrapped wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it god himself wrapped his own self in a christmas package and sent it to the world god himself wrapped their own self in a christmas package can you see amen this big bowl on the package hallelujah and now when you get a christmas gift what you're supposed to do is open it glory to god and god is watching you open his gift god wants to see how you gonna respond in opening his gift will you just open it and push it to the side to go on to the next gift or will you stop and just say forget about everything else this is the most important thing that could ever happen to me is to receive him oh jesus glory to god amen he says uh the greatest that god himself wrapped his own self in a christmas package and sent it to the world why did they refuse it why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is they uh why why is it they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight look at what the prophet said it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed if somebody got to tell you what's going to happen at the service before you decide what you're going to do or not you got to hear an announcement no i ain't got to hear no announcement i i without the announcement i knew where i was going to be wednesday night amen i already knew before before wednesday got here i knew where i was going to be amen praise the lord church amen glory to god it it's got to just be automatic in us hallelujah look at this it says the same they say it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason they were it's rejected yet tonight it's because it's not handed to the people in the custom that they have been used to receiving gifts and i and i know the holy spirit is not telling me that people are sitting at home streaming and wrapping gifts at the same time i know the holy spirit ain't telling me that's happening put that stuff down and hear the word of god amen streams sometimes become a a hindrance lord god it's sometimes things that are meant for good can actually become a hindrance to us amen amen glory to god all right all right let's go on amen he says uh um because it's uh because it's not handed to the people in the custom that they've been used to receiving gifts but god wrapped his own package he's got a right to do it he's the one that's giving it he has a right to wrap it any way he wants to rap it doesn't make any difference how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one giving the gift sometimes we get upset with how how the gift looked right well you should have did it this way that ain't you just happy to have a gift praise the lord amen and we get upset with how god choose to do things you know you don't get upset with god praise the lord you know just be i mean god help us help us in this hour just to keep our attention on you all right i want i want to just uh let's see i want to i'm breaking into another uh quote here because what uh brother branham said is that at the same time mary and joseph were looking uh at this star mary said it's been following us ever since the sun went down it says the magi uh miles away miles away they actually saw the same star that mary and joseph stall and uh and they had already when they saw it they just began to make preparation to come lord of god let's pick this up and god's gifts always find their places and i love this it says notice god guide the magi with them gifts for practically two years can you imagine this here this man married and maybe got kids at home and he's telling his wife i'm leaving telling family i'm leaving i'm gonna follow this star that i just saw now you know here's the here's the important thing i mentioned to you earlier with this um this great conjunction of saturn and and jupiter uh crossing paths and becoming like one big star in the sky they call it the christmas star and they were saying they felt that that was something that might have happened back in uh in the time of jesus when jesus came to earth you know and they said you know um we're just not sure because how with the mad job they were asking a question just read it on the internet they were asking how did magi see it because when when the two planets crossed it only it only crossed for a a small amount of time and then it just they separate again right and it take years before they actually come back together again they said next time we'll see something like what we just saw it'll be 80 years from now it takes years for it to happen again because they they turn at a different speed they rotate at a different speed so they're saying uh they said how would they say if if they were guided by a star if they were guided by a star it they said maybe it wasn't that this this like this conjunction they don't they just really it's really hard for them to kind of understand how it happened but the prophet just makes a statement here he says god got it not the star the star and let me just put this way the star was simply to get their attention hallelujah and and i want i want to i want to bring that a little further a little closer to home the star in the hand of jesus was simply to get our attention oh hallelujah the star is to is to bring us in the into the presence of the lord jesus glory hallelujah look at i mean he was a true eliezer to bring us into isaac's presence and once we get there he leaves off the scene oh hallelujah but the star is there to get your attention that's what the star is so so here you know the prophet said notice god guided the magi with them gifts for practically two years they followed that star so every once in a while they would see it on the journey said but for two years they were following that stuff see and that shows it couldn't be one of the natural things oh hallelujah the prophet tells us that shows it couldn't be one of the natural things that happened see because if the stars crossing their orbits would have crossed it would show there was something different but but because unless those magi saw it long time before it happened amen and no they had to cross that way that might not take revelation right i mean here the the magi cuz they could not now i want you to understand a little somebody's magi they were actually trained by daniel when daniel was in babylon these guys got their training by daniel daniel taught them scriptures hallelujah one of the scriptures that daniel taught was amen numbers 24 and 17. this is when the scripture says i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star glory to god there shall come a star out of jacob and accepted shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of chef so here they were studying scriptures and they knew something was supposed to happen in the heavens so so by by revelation they could actually prepare themselves and get ready as soon as they saw it they were on their way to come see christ oh hallelujah church we gotta we gotta we gotta be able to catch things quickly catch them spiritually and be ready to move out soon as soon as it occurs i told you there's about to be a shift they are claiming that there's going to be a cultural shift i'm claiming it's going to be a heavenly shift we got to get ourselves ready for what god getting ready to do we just experienced some of it we just experienced pentecostal chicane in here and you think you think god as a like like brother simba prayed on sunday i mean we had we had prayer sunday morning and and just so maybe people didn't notice but the church is still open for seven a.m prayer i i know i haven't announced it but the church is still open for 7 a.m prayer brother simon come here on sunday morning and he prayed closing out closing out the sermon they say he said god i know you're not a one-hit wonder amen i said amen brother he's not a one-hit wonder there's more where that came from and i'm underexpected we got to get ourselves positioned to receive what god has for us amen amen he already showed us our expectations should be through the roof through the roof everything we know god we saw you do it before we know what you can do come here i mean we ought to we ought to come to church early we ought to come to church early and be praying 30 minutes early just sit here praying praise the lord getting your get your mind amen uh in in a spot where god can speak to you sometimes we come right out of the car with all kind of stuff and we just need to be able to come here and sit and when you when you're coming to church early you're not here for somebody to talk and you're in the start you know oh i forgot to tell you you did write that down and then when we get outside you can tell me outside but don't come here telling me i'm trying to get my mind positioned to receive something from god church this is what we got to do so i mean these magi got in a hurry look at it that's why they was able to that's why they was able to uh uh uh uh to you know to to to to to to see the lord you know this is why they're able to come into spread they gotta they got in a hurry to do what they needed to do look at this look at this oh i love this he says uh uh and that shows it couldn't be one of the natural things that happened see because if the stars crossing their orbits would have crossed it would have showed there was something different unless those magis magi saw it long time before it happened and know they had to cross that way see in the past they were coming in and they crossed just at bethlehem at that time started up from there beforehand knowing that these heavenly bodies were moving that way these guys had revelation now god got it the magi because they had the right gifts god guided these wise men because they have the right identified gift to identify his son says oh my do you get it wise men today wise in the name of the lord not with some fictitious something but with the gift that god promised for this day and god will guide you to identify that jesus christ is the same yesterday the day and forever there you are wise men now you know i uh just want to go back and read the scripture out of matthew 2. i mentioned that earlier because this is where we get the wise men we pick them up in their journey they've been traveling for two years the other the one of the things that we we get clarity from in the message is that the wise men did not come on the day that jesus was born the wise men came two years later so when you look at these nativity scenes that people have and you know they're just unscriptural some of the ways that they have it the only the only people that showed up the night that jesus was born were the shepherds shepherds shepherds and i think that's uh that's even special you know i'm going to matthew 2 but let me give just drop this in real quick about the shepherds um god used shepherds there was a prophet that was a shepherd before he was a prophet and his name was amos and in amos 8 9 uh amos prophesied about christ not about his birth but about his death and in amos 8 9. uh just pull that up for me amos 8 9. um amos was prophesying he was a shepherd that god used to prophesy and i i like this because here god's using the prophet to prophesy about uh the the death of christ and god uses shepherds to also be there at the birth of christ it says and it should come to pass and that day saith the lord that i would cause the sun to go down at noon and i would darken the earth in a clear sky when jesus died on the cross some went down at noon right here amos prophesied amos being a shepherd prophesying about his death but when it come time for his birth god also uses shepherds to identify where he was born shepherds shepherds uh all throughout history god has used shepherds right uh moses was a shepherd on the backside of the desert that got called from shepherding joseph's family they were shepherds and joseph didn't want them to say that in front of pharaoh but they were shepherds david himself was a shepherd out there watching his father's sheep god always used shepherds jesus christ is considered the chief shepherd right amen he's the door to the sheepfold and i just want you to know that god always use shepherds shepherds praise god here in matthew chapter 2 verse 1. now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there was wise men from the wise men that there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship these fellows is on a two-year journey when they saw the star it was two years ago praise the lord and here they are on a two-year journey can you imagine that can you imagine maybe some of the perils that they went through and when they finally get to jerusalem jerusalem represented like the most holy city um probably the most spiritual city that that a person could come to if anybody should have had an answer to their question they should have been able to find it in jerusalem hallelujah but when they get there to jerusalem amen they ask the question where is he that is born king of the jews but we have seen a star in the east and i come to worship now here's the other thing how come the others never recognize the star nobody else martha i mean uh dave uh joseph and mary and these wise men recognize there was a stuff hallelujah i'ma just put it this way if everybody in the world is recognizing a star something may write about it glory to god if everybody can see it and everybody trying to uh something may write about it because in the days of jesus only very few people recognize the star and it's only gonna be a few people today that's gonna recognize a star yeah when herod king had heard these things he was troubled in all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded to them where christ should be born he demanded i mean herod had no idea y'all y'all talking about a star uh that brought y'all here and and you said king a king what king so there's harry say i want to know where is christ supposed to be born verse 5 says and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea so they went back to micah chapter two michael chapter five verse two and they knew that was there oh glory to god now i i want you to i want you to see something here uh let me just keep reading that thou but uh he says and they said unto him bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet uh and thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the ark not the least among the princes of judah out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people then herod when he privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared now notice they said we have seen his star in the east if i recall correctly brother branham said when they got to jerusalem the star wasn't shining anymore they was there in jerusalem and the star wasn't shining anymore but they knew that something that just because they had studied you know these guys studied the uh the stars they knew something had happened so as they were coming on their journey they knew it was gonna cross at bethlehem now um they go to jerusalem because they expect them to have an answer in jerusalem but as they see nobody really got no answer here nobody got nothing to say so when when when herod asks you know bring out the scribes and y'all give me the word of god what is promised by the prophets where is christ will be born when they heard that when they heard bethlehem when they heard that uh they realized that you know that star that kind of uh only brought them to you know to to this great city jerusalem the star brought them there but but it was the revelation of the word that actually took them to the presence of jesus christ the star brought them into the vicinity let me put it that way the star brought them into the vicinity but the revealed word brought them into the presence hallelujah and there's many people today glory to god they read the same story that we're reading glory to god they got many christmas sermons going on tonight gonna happen tomorrow night and even on christmas day and and see see the the uh maybe the the the story about the star actually brings them a man into the vicinity but it's when the revealed word comes that they can actually enter into the presence glory to god look at this look at it now they've brought the scriptures out and they revealing the words you know they're revealing the prophecies it says inherit when he had privileged called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared appeared what time did it had it appeared he says and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and we if when you have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also when they heard the king look at verse nine they departed and lo so after they get out of jerusalem lo the star which they saw in the east now after they get out of the presence of these religious leaders come on somebody and can i put it this way after they leave their denominational church after they can leave some of the things of the world now the supernatural can be made known to you again glory says when they had when they heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was now uh i just found it i told you you know it brings you the revealed word is what was actually bringing them and they were headed to bethlehem when i went to israel um you know i noticed how close jerusalem and bethlehem were brother random said you know in order to get to bethlehem based on on on the way that these brothers were traveling they would actually have to come through jerusalem in order to get to bethlehem based on how they was traveling they had to come through these this this this religious hierarchy they had to come through all of that in order to get to bethlehem oh god i want you to think about all the stuff that we had to come through in order to get to where we are right now amen you couldn't bypass it you had to come through it amen yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rob that staff they comfort me right but these these these wise men had to come through all of that in order to get to where they need to be we had to come through some i mean some of us come through catholic some come through methodist some come through baptism come through pentecostal some come through all kinds of stuff but we had to go through it in order to get to where we are right now verse nine again when they heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw him in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when they would come into the house notice they're not at the manger they're not at the manger joseph and mary at the house praise god now they have no room at the end when he was born but god doesn't bless joseph hallelujah they had the house and when they would come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and i want to tell you when you get into the presence of god present him your gifts present them your gifts if you're a singer give them your gift if you're a musician give them your gift amen whatever gift god has given you give it back to the lord present it to him and worship in adoration to him as your your savior these these these these men have the right gifts this is why god protected them because they had the right gifts to identify who christ really was and um brother branham said the goal represented his deity as king of kings it represented his supremeness this two-year-old child represented his supremeness the frankincense that they gave it represented a service offering this two-year child they are identifying some things about his life leviticus 2 and leviticus 16 we find that the order of the priest the order of the priesthood to make an offering to jehovah when he made an offering had to be made and mixed with frankincense for a cent offering they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering for the wave offering frankincense was added because it was acceptable to jehovah if it was anointed with frankincense which means it is a service to jehovah that's what the frankincense was and the myrrh was an anointing for death and brother branham said that jesus christ was deity in service to die this great package that god sent to the earth this christmas package i pray that we just take time to unpack it and just really really fellowship with it love it more than anything else in this world but i i can't leave you a man at um in bethlehem because he's not there anymore he's not there anymore and it's good that the world can go and just stop and and just think about the birth of the lord jesus uh and be forced to maybe even talk about it right reason people are getting away from the merry christmas they actually start putting merry xmas all the place now you don't see nothing you know but uh but uh but it used to be a time they had to stop and think about the birth of our lord and savior jesus christ we want to keep reminding him he is truly the reason for the season but he's no longer in a manger he's no longer in that house let's read this out of the message deity of jesus christ in our clothes right here oh my deity was in service to die but the prophet says this brother sister that that deity that deity that was in services now that deity now that deity is in you it says little while the world a little while in the world sheath me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age christ in the manger no christ in you he says hallelujah and i love this statement we're not worshiping christ in the manger but christ in you the holy ghost the hope of life hallelujah the creator god himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be what will but we'll see him as he is for we be made like him no room for him amen they didn't have room for him but we got room for him amen and and i'm so happy that he's dwelling on the inside of us and and now we recognize um we recognize our place in this whole this whole story this whole story god is good thank god for the christmas star that pointed a man uh the the wise men uh to the lord jesus where he was born amen but it's only after they heard the word the revealed word that it was brought they were brought into his presence and i tell you there's a christmas star shining today many uh will see it in scripture but i tell you what afterward has been revealed to you the word has been revealed to you and you can see what what we see amen i think they sing that song do you see what i see right and uh if you can see what we can see i tell you what god will reveal himself to you in a way that you never ever thought he could there's a star according to revelation 1 that god brought amen in this day and all we got to do is follow that star that star will bring us into the presence of the lord jesus christ amen let's pray father we thank you for your word lord just taking the time just to reflect a little bit on on um this christmas season and we as believers we realize god we realize that the world has really got it all wrong and things that they're seeing we understand that the lord we just want to do our part while we're here to try to be light in the midst of darkness help us oh god to even shine like uh god like um like you would have us to shine in the midst of this lord and uh help us lord to to relax to pull back just a little bit lord and just reflect reflect god on you you coming to earth with a very specific purpose god himself wrapped himself in a gift presented it to the earth our savior our king our redeemer present it to us and god help us to unwrap the gift and lord and as we just sit in uh lord just honor and thank you anytime people receive gifts they say thank you how much they appreciate it but god help us to to really demonstrate our appreciation for you and and what you've done and what you're continuing to do lord jesus for us no gift like your gift no gift can ever compare so lord we just pray that as we would leave even this place on tonight you would go with us that you would just help us oh god to keep you in in the center of all things may you be the truly the reason for the cease in our lives and god i just pray that you just watch over the saints thank you for each one that came out to the house of the lord tonight and god i know some are watching from home and i appreciate
