[30:02] out and she was bringing me back home
[30:05] and we were stopped at this um
[30:07] light and we just sitting there talking
[30:10] and the light turned green and she
[30:14] didn't move the person next to us didn't
[30:16] move nobody moved and when she began to
[30:19] move a car coming from this way just ran
[30:23] the light going full speed and just came
[30:26] straight in front sister Brown just she
[30:28] had just began to take off and uh if she
[30:32] she had taken off just a little bit more
[30:36] it would have hit her side and the the
[30:39] car was going so fast and we just
[30:42] started praising God and thanking God
[30:44] for sparing our lives and you know we
[30:48] just we just really just realized how
[30:51] God's grace just protected US during
[30:54] that time and looking back at it you
[30:56] know the Devil he's always trying to do
[30:59] something but yet and still God puts a
[31:02] hedge of protection around us and you
[31:05] know it's like Devil you may have
[31:06] thought that you got us but we got a way
[31:09] we got a way out of that so regardless
[31:12] of what the devil is trying to do God is
[31:15] always going to give us a way out of it

[53:42] you to different places some places you
[53:45] enjoy going some places you have to go
[53:48] because of the gift you know Jonah was
[53:51] told go to tashes right that was a rough
[53:54] place for him right but sometimes you
[53:57] don't get to choose you have to be led
[54:00] by the holy spirit because God has his
[54:02] people
[54:03] everywhere but but when we are here we
[54:05] are home
[54:07] Hallelujah we love to be
[54:11] here Hall I I gotta be honest with you
[54:15] there are places that people that we
[54:16] have to talk to it's a gift and you have
[54:19] to love people to be able to minister to
[54:21] them you have to go beyond differences
[54:25] you have to go Beyond little politics
[54:28] you have to look at the bigger picture
[54:31] Hallelujah can you say Amen because the
[54:34] prophet says this the tent stretches a
[54:36] little bit amen let's stand upon our
[54:40] feet and read the scripture this morning
[54:43] glory you say brother Aaron what do you
[54:45] believe I believe the whole word
[54:48] hallelujah every scripture every book
[54:51] every quote I believe in that hallelujah
[54:55] amen
[54:57] 2 Corinthians chapter
[54:59] 4 verse 7 to
[55:04] 10 you are such a privileged people to
[55:07] have brother Jack we enjoyed him when he
[55:10] came our way last week oh
[55:13] my that was some really wonderful
[55:19] preaching but we have
[55:22] this treasure in aan vessels that the
[55:26] Excellence of the power may be of God
[55:30] and not of us we are troubled on every
[55:33] side yet not distressed we are perplexed
[55:38] but not in despair we are
[55:41] persecuted but not forsaken right we are
[55:44] cast down but not destroyed always
[55:48] bearing about in our body the dying of
[55:51] the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[55:55] Jesus might be you may manifest in our
[55:58] body you may have your
[56:00] seats for uh a little little time today
[56:04] we want to talk
[56:05] about Earthly vessels and bjer skins we
[56:09] know that this church is a well taught
[56:12] church and um it's uh I believe that we
[56:16] be pulling the word with your amens all
[56:19] right remember you are half of the gift
[56:22] when when brother Jack is preaching you
[56:24] half of the gift but when I'm preaching
[56:26] you are
[56:29] 80% you got to remember
[56:33] that amen I want to talk about ether
[56:36] vessels and benjes skins now from the
[56:40] scripture that we read Paul is saying we
[56:43] have this treasure in Ethan vessels and
[56:47] and and and and the natural wisdom of
[56:49] man would think why would you put your
[56:52] your Treasures in in ethn vessels come
[56:55] on you know if if if if it was a modern
[56:57] day people they would buy a lock box
[57:00] they'll buy like a gun safe you know
[57:03] with with all kinds of you know codes
[57:06] and you know something that cannot be
[57:08] broken and that's where you put your
[57:10] diamonds that's where you put your gold
[57:13] that's where you put your your Rolex
[57:15] watches that's where you put your gold
[57:17] bars you know you have to find something
[57:20] somewhere secure and you don't just put
[57:22] it maybe in a kitchen or a dining room
[57:25] you get find a men's den somewhere in
[57:27] the basement and there you put your safe
[57:31] Hallelujah but here the Bible is saying
[57:34] this treasure is in Earthly vessels and
[57:38] that's where the mystery is and that's
[57:40] where we want to dwell on this morning
[57:43] that God chose to put Treasures in
[57:47] Earthly vessels and if you a natural man
[57:50] that that is a bit comp you know
[57:52] perplexing right right but you see God's
[57:55] wisdom is not like our wisdom God's way
[57:59] is not like our way but he said I'm
[58:01] going to send my word and you shall
[58:03] forsake your way and you shall take my
[58:06] way and God's way is beyond
[58:09] understanding he does things that are
[58:11] beyond our imagination and if you want
[58:13] to work with God you got to put away
[58:16] your imagination put away your
[58:18] understanding lean not un your own
[58:20] understanding but look to Jesus because
[58:23] he's able to do above what we can ask or
[58:27] imagine hall
[58:30] hallelujah sometimes we have desires in
[58:33] our hearts how is my son going to
[58:35] receive the Holy Ghost how is my
[58:37] daughter going to receive the Holy Ghost
[58:38] God knows how he's going to do it all we
[58:41] have to do is to pray all we have to do
[58:43] is to believe all we have to do is to
[58:45] accept and apply the
[58:48] token sometimes we try to work things
[58:50] our way oh if he goes to this Camp maybe
[58:53] he might receive that's fine but God
[58:56] works in mysterious ways there was a man
[58:58] at at the Tabernacle his name his name
[59:00] was brother Charlie Cox I believe it was
[59:03] and he was a very good friend of brother
[59:04] bham and he loved brother bham loved to
[59:07] go to his house and he became a deacon
[59:09] and you know he wanted to receive the
[59:11] Holy Ghost but he could not receive it
[59:14] in the Tabernacle when the prophet was
[59:16] preaching believe it or not and the and
[59:19] the wife was praying for him and he had
[59:21] an experience whilst he was home playing
[59:24] the tape and brother B I'm talking about
[59:26] it you would think that wowow the
[59:28] prophet was there preaching naturally
[59:30] he's going to receive the Holy Ghost
[59:31] right there but what what I'm trying to
[59:33] show you is that God works in mysterious
[59:36] ways in his wonders to perform one time
[59:40] someone came on the prayer line and the
[59:42] prophet says your condition you need an
[59:45] oldfashioned Country Doctor he's going
[59:48] to operate on you and you're going to be
[59:50] healed so how God does it it's not our
[59:53] business our business is to believe our
[59:57] business is to accept whether he uses
[59:59] medication whether he uses a miracle we
[1:00:02] say Amen to the word we say Amen to
[1:00:05] Jesus we say Amen to his
[1:00:07] way
[1:00:09] Hallelujah sometimes we try to make
[1:00:11] things our own way right we Minister
[1:00:14] sometimes we try to make everyone be
[1:00:16] like us now if you want everyone to look
[1:00:19] like you or be like you then you'll
[1:00:21] become
[1:00:22] God we are different friends some are
[1:00:26] cut this way some are cut that way but
[1:00:28] we are all God's
[1:00:31] children amen and sometimes we try to
[1:00:34] convert our own families sometimes we
[1:00:37] try to convert our our spouses our duty
[1:00:40] is to pray God's duty is to convert my
[1:00:43] duty is to teach my children it's the
[1:00:45] holy spirit's duty to convert them to
[1:00:49] Jesus Hallelujah you have to know your
[1:00:52] portion and God's portion but sometimes
[1:00:56] try to do both
[1:00:59] right we try to do both I I enjoyed the
[1:01:03] good singing God bless you Sister oh
[1:01:05] draged cross oh my I could I could I
[1:01:09] could I could feel the
[1:01:11] anointing wonderful Singing Glory and it
[1:01:14] Blends well with what we are talking
[1:01:16] about right and here the Bible says yet
[1:01:20] it says it says it says here we are
[1:01:21] troubled on every side not on some side
[1:01:25] but on every side because the Bible says
[1:01:28] many are the afflictions of the
[1:01:31] righteous but God deliver out of them
[1:01:35] allu all of them God delivers out of
[1:01:39] them because you know what trials are
[1:01:41] part of the journey sir because if you
[1:01:44] don't have trials how are you going to
[1:01:47] overcome if you don't have trials how
[1:01:49] are you going to wear a crown if you
[1:01:51] don't have trials how are you going to
[1:01:53] have a testimony you must have a testim
[1:01:56] morning of your
[1:01:57] own
[1:01:59] Hallelujah and we all have different
[1:02:01] crosses that's right you can't judge
[1:02:03] someone by what they're going through
[1:02:05] just because it's different from what
[1:02:07] you're going through some of us wear
[1:02:10] spectacles that's our
[1:02:13] cross some wear dentures that's our
[1:02:16] cross some have to work out lose some
[1:02:20] weight that's our cross but we have
[1:02:23] different situations but it's the same
[1:02:26] cross Hallelujah some of us have to deal
[1:02:30] with our children that's our cross some
[1:02:32] have to deal with our wives That's our
[1:02:34] cross we all have a cross to
[1:02:37] carry some of us have to deal with our
[1:02:39] finances and that's our cross some have
[1:02:42] to deal with our health that's our cross
[1:02:45] but there's a cross for you there's a
[1:02:47] cross for
[1:02:49] me Hallelujah and sometimes you might
[1:02:52] think why is this brother like that you
[1:02:54] just pray for him God will take care of
[1:02:57] him why is this sister like this you
[1:02:58] pray for him God will help him
[1:03:01] out Hallelujah glory be to God now we
[1:03:05] are troubled on every side now trials
[1:03:09] are part of the journey right and and I
[1:03:12] want you to know that God designed it
[1:03:15] this way the Bible says this is the
[1:03:17] stone that the build has rejected and it
[1:03:20] has become the head of the corner and
[1:03:22] the Bible says this is the Lord's doing
[1:03:25] and it is marvelous in our eyes it was
[1:03:28] God's doing to choose a man who had
[1:03:31] great seven education it was God's
[1:03:33] choosing to choose a man who was not
[1:03:35] eloquent it was God's doing and it's
[1:03:38] marvelous in our eyes and whatever
[1:03:41] family set up you came
[1:03:43] from it was God's doing the angel told
[1:03:47] the prophet your peculiar birth and your
[1:03:50] misunderstood life was for you to bring
[1:03:53] a gift to the world and sometimes we try
[1:03:56] to to to blame our background God
[1:03:59] designed your background like that
[1:04:02] because he knew the gift that he was
[1:04:04] going to give to you and how you were
[1:04:06] going to have an impact on people God
[1:04:10] Hallelujah the prophet always wondered
[1:04:12] why was I born like this why am I messed
[1:04:15] up like that it was God's way of
[1:04:17] bringing a prophet
[1:04:20] up the mother was Indian the father was
[1:04:23] Irish you know and and his father you
[1:04:26] know how many know that he killed a man
[1:04:29] and that's why they to to to to move
[1:04:31] from where they were living and they
[1:04:33] went to live near a city called New
[1:04:34] Albany right Hallelujah and they a b
[1:04:38] name wherever you would go he's a br oh
[1:04:40] is that that that that those vagab bones
[1:04:43] but you know what that was God's program
[1:04:46] and some of you may say oh if I if only
[1:04:47] I didn't grow up somewhere in the
[1:04:49] project or you know as they call it or
[1:04:52] somewhere you know in the high density
[1:04:54] God designed it that way
[1:04:56] and if only you say Lord show me where
[1:04:58] you want to place me God will use that
[1:05:01] for for his own
[1:05:05] Glory say oh brother why did I come from
[1:05:07] a broken family God knew you were going
[1:05:10] to come through
[1:05:11] that you did not surprise God when you
[1:05:14] came up to him to give your life and God
[1:05:16] was like oh this one has come God knew
[1:05:19] all about you he chose your parents he
[1:05:22] chose your father he chose your mother
[1:05:25] he chose your state he chose your city
[1:05:27] he chose everything about your life sir
[1:05:32] Hallelujah sir it was God's doing and
[1:05:35] it's marvelous in our eyes right all
[1:05:37] right so don't spend your day trying to
[1:05:40] regret may maybe I made the wrong
[1:05:42] decision you did not make a wrong
[1:05:43] decision God made it like that you know
[1:05:47] Moses had a wife who had a lot of temper
[1:05:50] her name was uh Zapora but the Bible
[1:05:53] says Moses was the meekest man upon the
[1:05:56] Earth who knows maybe the wife
[1:06:00] contributed to that he was a prophet but
[1:06:04] yet Z poer and the prophet
[1:06:08] says there was a lot of fighting in the
[1:06:10] in the wilderness that's he
[1:06:14] hallelujah amen that's not in my
[1:06:18] notes that's good Exodus
[1:06:21] 39:33 and they brought the Tabernacle
[1:06:24] unto Moses the tent and all his
[1:06:27] furniture his te is his boards his bars
[1:06:31] and his
[1:06:33] pillars and his
[1:06:35] sockets and the covering of ram skin
[1:06:38] died dreed and the covering of bener
[1:06:40] skins and the veil of the calvary now I
[1:06:43] want you to know that the glory of God
[1:06:45] in the Tabernacle of Moses was hidden
[1:06:49] behind bener skins now benjer Skins are
[1:06:52] animal skins how many knows that small
[1:06:55] it's not even a lion or some fancy
[1:06:58] animal it's just a a tiny small animal
[1:07:01] that is very very Fearless a type of the
[1:07:04] believer that God would reveal would
[1:07:08] would hide his glory behind Benes skins
[1:07:12] now the the the Scrolls of old they
[1:07:16] would be kept in in in in clay pots how
[1:07:19] many knows that that's how they found
[1:07:21] the lost you know the Bible you know
[1:07:23] they they would they would go into you
[1:07:25] know
[1:07:26] archaeologist would dig up things and
[1:07:27] they will find a a clay pot in there
[1:07:30] they would find maybe the book of
[1:07:32] Jeremiah because there is nothing better
[1:07:34] that can keep something than an Earthly
[1:07:36] vessel if you put a paper in an Earthly
[1:07:39] vessel you seal it up it can it can last
[1:07:41] for hundreds of years it might it might
[1:07:44] look vulnerable but that's the best way
[1:07:47] to keep the cross so Paul is saying that
[1:07:49] when God gave us this treasure he put it
[1:07:52] in our hearts and we are Earthly vessels
[1:07:56] we are just people of the earth we come
[1:07:59] from the Natural Earth that's why we
[1:08:01] live by the natural substance of life
[1:08:04] because we come from this dirt and we go
[1:08:06] back to this dirt but inside of us
[1:08:09] though we are dirt on the outside but
[1:08:12] inside there is an eternal life inside
[1:08:15] of us there is God who is greater than
[1:08:18] all of our problems yes sir amen
[1:08:21] hallelujah amen and here it's saying
[1:08:23] that the glory of God was hidden behind
[1:08:27] bener
[1:08:28] skins now the prophet says in the Mighty
[1:08:30] God unveiled before us he says we notice
[1:08:33] another thing in the Old Testament I
[1:08:35] have the scripture here in in Exodus
[1:08:37] that the old benjes skins what did it do
[1:08:40] it hid the glory of God from the people
[1:08:43] the bener Skins even people couldn't see
[1:08:45] it because it was a skin that held it
[1:08:48] the skin the glory of God was was was
[1:08:51] was was behind the skin and he says now
[1:08:54] and now the glory of God is behind your
[1:08:58] skin that's it yes sir the glory of God
[1:09:01] is behind your skin so when we talk to
[1:09:04] our neighbors when we talk to our to
[1:09:06] other people we are giving them an
[1:09:08] opportunity to receive Christ all right
[1:09:11] because we are veiling the glory of God
[1:09:14] and the closest that other people are
[1:09:16] going to see God is through your life
[1:09:19] that's why the Bible says let your light
[1:09:20] so shine before man let your light so
[1:09:23] shine before your neighbor let your
[1:09:26] light so shine before your coow
[1:09:28] wakers because you are God's agent to
[1:09:31] the
[1:09:32] Earth and you are holding the mercy
[1:09:35] seat and the prophet says the mercy seat
[1:09:39] is in the hearts of the believer that's
[1:09:42] what he said right we yes it's in heaven
[1:09:44] but it's also in the hearts of the
[1:09:46] believer that's why Jesus Christ said I
[1:09:48] give you the keys whatsoever you bind on
[1:09:51] Earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:09:53] whatsoever sins you remit Earth shall be
[1:09:56] remitted in heaven the church has the
[1:10:00] power Hallelujah because the church was
[1:10:04] empowered by God to give life and the
[1:10:07] prophet says one time the Greater Works
[1:10:10] was to impart eternal life that's why
[1:10:13] when we baptize people we lay our hands
[1:10:16] on them to receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:10:19] may not receive receive it right there
[1:10:21] but we are placing them under the
[1:10:24] promise
[1:10:25] that somewhere down the road God will
[1:10:28] work with them and they receive the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost we are not the ones to give the
[1:10:34] Holy Ghost we obey the scripture and
[1:10:37] upon the basis of the scripture God
[1:10:39] works on his
[1:10:41] word if any of you is sick let him call
[1:10:44] the Elder Hallelujah and the Elder will
[1:10:48] lay hands and he'll be healed but we are
[1:10:51] Gentiles and sometimes we don't even
[1:10:53] need our hands to be laid on we just
[1:10:56] believe the word right where we are say
[1:10:58] I believe God I believe God and that's
[1:11:01] nothing but the truth when you believe
[1:11:03] God like that something is bound to
[1:11:07] happen Hallelujah sometimes people go
[1:11:09] run after you know people with special
[1:11:12] gifts there's no such thing as special
[1:11:13] gifts all gifts come from the
[1:11:16] Bible and the thing that heals you is
[1:11:20] your
[1:11:21] faith your faith heals you and faith is
[1:11:25] a gift from God I've seen people go from
[1:11:28] Camp to Camp they switch churches every
[1:11:31] year that is not going to make you a
[1:11:33] Christian you become a Christian when
[1:11:35] you believe God when you come under
[1:11:38] expectation that I am going to meet God
[1:11:40] today whether it's this brother
[1:11:42] preaching or that brother preaching I'm
[1:11:44] going to receive something from
[1:11:48] God but when you follow
[1:11:50] personalities you going to have problems
[1:11:53] because you know what men changes
[1:11:55] but God Remains the Same you may follow
[1:11:58] brother Aaron today the next moment you
[1:12:00] hear that is preaching another funny
[1:12:02] Doctrine so what do you do stop
[1:12:04] following man and follow the word follow
[1:12:08] the word follow the Bible stay with your
[1:12:11] pastor stay with your church uh stay
[1:12:13] with your
[1:12:14] husband
[1:12:16] GL Hallelujah and you don't have to wait
[1:12:19] for another Camp to receive the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:23] today you can receive the H ghost this
[1:12:25] morning you can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:28] right now if you have faith in
[1:12:33] Jesus GL because when the Holy Ghost was
[1:12:36] given in on the day of Pentecost it
[1:12:39] became available to everyone right now
[1:12:44] because from before the day of Pentecost
[1:12:47] they had to wait for the day of
[1:12:49] Pentecost to fully come when the day of
[1:12:51] Pentecost fully came it was available to
[1:12:54] everyone amen amen amen which means that
[1:12:57] if you need it God can give
[1:13:00] you now James chapter 5 verse 17 let's
[1:13:04] open this one I I love this
[1:13:07] verse now the Bible
[1:13:09] says El lias which is
[1:13:12] Elijah now I like the Book of James
[1:13:15] because it's a book of wisdom and it's
[1:13:18] like the Book of Proverbs wisdom is
[1:13:20] practical you know the Book of Proverbs
[1:13:22] is very practical it will tell you if
[1:13:25] you're lazy you're not going to S
[1:13:28] succeed it's very very practical amen
[1:13:31] says is the door turns upon the hinges
[1:13:34] so is a lazy man who turns in his bed
[1:13:38] Hallelujah so wisdom is practical and I
[1:13:42] recommend young people to read The Book
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:48] Proverbs amen Elijah was a
[1:13:52] man Elijah did did was an angel did you
[1:13:55] say that it said Elijah was a man am I
[1:14:00] reading it right Elijah was a God no
[1:14:04] Elijah was an archangel no Elijah was a
[1:14:08] man subject to like passions as we are
[1:14:13] it wasn't different but as we are
[1:14:15] talking about Elijah of of of old and
[1:14:19] this is where there's a bridge and he
[1:14:21] prayed earnestly that it might not rain
[1:14:25] and it rained not on the earth for the
[1:14:27] space of three and three three years and
[1:14:30] six months the Bible says that though he
[1:14:32] was a man subject to like passion yet he
[1:14:37] prayed and this is the mystery friends
[1:14:40] though we are man though we are subject
[1:14:43] to the same elements that people go
[1:14:45] through but our consolation is that
[1:14:47] there is a power in us that if the
[1:14:50] weakest of the Saints can pray then
[1:14:53] Jesus can hear from heaven and is able
[1:14:55] to intervene on our
[1:14:58] behalf Elijah did not have a different
[1:15:00] blood type than everyone else Elijah did
[1:15:04] not have different eyes than everyone
[1:15:06] else he also had headaches like anyone
[1:15:08] else he had stomach aches like anyone
[1:15:10] else he had anxiety like anyone else but
[1:15:13] he trusted in
[1:15:16] Jesus Hallelujah so sometimes when we
[1:15:19] read about the men of the Bible we think
[1:15:21] that you know their life was
[1:15:24] significantly different to ours they the
[1:15:27] same life that we have it's the same
[1:15:29] road my friend there it's the same Rob
[1:15:32] that we wear some come through the water
[1:15:35] some through some through the fire but
[1:15:36] we all go through the blood we all go
[1:15:39] through the same door Glory so Elijah
[1:15:42] just like the prophet right he had his
[1:15:45] own complexes he had his moments when he
[1:15:47] was up there were moments when he was
[1:15:49] down I'll read you the quotations but
[1:15:51] yet he was a man of God Amen yet there
[1:15:54] was a hidden power inside of
[1:15:57] him now the Amplified version just to
[1:16:01] give you an understanding I I read the
[1:16:02] King James version unless someone will
[1:16:04] check me on that one but for your
[1:16:08] understanding people some people get
[1:16:11] into a lot of
[1:16:12] trivia so brother I'm a King James
[1:16:15] person yes but sometimes you need to
[1:16:19] study Elijah was a man with a nature
[1:16:21] like ours the here it says with the Fe
[1:16:24] physical mental and spiritual
[1:16:27] limitations and shortcomings and he
[1:16:29] prayed intensely for not for for it not
[1:16:32] to rain and it did not rain on the earth
[1:16:34] for 3 years and 6 months so because you
[1:16:37] as long as you are a man the word man
[1:16:39] means you are limited you're not going
[1:16:42] to be able to do everything by your own
[1:16:44] self you're not going to be able to do
[1:16:46] everything by your own power you need
[1:16:49] something
[1:16:50] higher
[1:16:53] Hallelujah First Corinthians chap 1: 26
[1:16:56] let's open our Bibles so it's going to
[1:16:58] be a very simple teaching this morning
[1:17:01] so you know opening your Bibles and
[1:17:03] reading for you see your calling
[1:17:05] Brethren how that not many were wise men
[1:17:09] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[1:17:13] Nobles are called so here he's saying
[1:17:16] that when God called us he didn't really
[1:17:19] call the brightest and
[1:17:21] greatest that's what the Bible is saying
[1:17:23] here sometimes we know we look at
[1:17:26] ourselves and we say oh look at the
[1:17:27] people in the world the Bible says Jesus
[1:17:29] Christ says the children of this world
[1:17:32] are in their generation not not all the
[1:17:35] time in their generation in their time
[1:17:38] wiser than the children of the
[1:17:41] light that's why you see unbelievers
[1:17:44] they Prosper because God has given them
[1:17:46] that because they have no inheritance
[1:17:48] Over
[1:17:49] Yonder how many knows
[1:17:51] that that the the seed of SE they were
[1:17:54] humble Farmers but the seed of Cain were
[1:17:58] the nimrods they were building cities
[1:18:01] they were Building Bridges they were
[1:18:03] building roads but they were not God's
[1:18:05] elect so natural things do not
[1:18:09] necessarily show the blessing of God
[1:18:12] although we need those things but the
[1:18:14] blessing of God comes from
[1:18:18] election election is part is the is is
[1:18:22] the expression of the love of God right
[1:18:25] hallelujah it's like marriage you can't
[1:18:27] say this man loves me because he bought
[1:18:29] me a car he bought me those things are
[1:18:31] fine and brothers you have to do that if
[1:18:33] you
[1:18:34] can but love is election right you know
[1:18:38] when you elect someone you choose to be
[1:18:41] with them you choose to spend the rest
[1:18:43] of your life with them you marry them
[1:18:45] that's love and then in the course of
[1:18:48] that love you express that love you buy
[1:18:50] them chocolates you buy them flowers you
[1:18:54] know you give them AMX to go
[1:18:56] shopping and all those things are fine
[1:18:59] and the sisters
[1:19:04] say you take them on
[1:19:06] vacations
[1:19:08] Hallelujah you buy them dresses every
[1:19:12] month and the sister
[1:19:16] say Oh
[1:19:19] Glory technicians let's cut that part
[1:19:23] from the seron
[1:19:28] now not many were wise after the
[1:19:31] remember the Bible saying after the
[1:19:33] flesh not after the spirit because when
[1:19:36] you have the Holy Ghost of course you
[1:19:37] are wiser than someone who does not have
[1:19:40] the Holy Ghost when we talk about the
[1:19:42] wisdom of God but naturally worldly
[1:19:44] wisdom right says after the flesh not
[1:19:48] many were Mighty not many were Noble are
[1:19:51] called but God chose the foolish things
[1:19:55] of the world to confound the wise and
[1:19:59] God has chosen the weak things of the
[1:20:02] world to confound the things which are
[1:20:04] Mighty and the prophet says sometimes
[1:20:07] our problems that we are too strong
[1:20:09] perfect strength by Perfect weakness and
[1:20:11] he says God is looking for people who
[1:20:13] are weak God is looking for people who
[1:20:16] are who are who are broken God is
[1:20:19] looking for people who are sheep God is
[1:20:22] looking for people who are saying Lord
[1:20:23] lead me Lord show me the way Lord show
[1:20:26] me where to go God is not looking for
[1:20:29] people who know
[1:20:30] everything
[1:20:32] waterheads intellectual God is looking
[1:20:35] for people that can be led God is
[1:20:37] looking for people that are vulnerable
[1:20:39] before him I went to to my eye doctor
[1:20:43] the other time and I had problems with
[1:20:45] my eyes you know and he said there's
[1:20:48] nothing thing other than of course I
[1:20:50] wear glasses but it says the challenge
[1:20:53] with your eyes is that they're too dry
[1:20:55] cry you're not crying so I'm going to
[1:20:59] give you some I'm going to prescribe you
[1:21:01] some artificial tears and that's what
[1:21:03] they call eye drops eye drops are just
[1:21:05] artificial tears because your eyes it's
[1:21:08] not supposed to be too dry it's not good
[1:21:10] for you then I thought wow so sometimes
[1:21:14] it's normal to cry but you know what you
[1:21:16] have to cry before the Lord it's normal
[1:21:19] sometimes to weep that doesn't mean you
[1:21:22] are weak or you are weakling it means
[1:21:24] that you are a human being But You Weep
[1:21:27] to
[1:21:28] God hallelujah weeping can last for the
[1:21:31] night but joy comes in the
[1:21:34] morning those who plant with te with
[1:21:37] tears they will come reaping
[1:21:41] rejoicing Hallelujah when you when you s
[1:21:44] in tears in prayer you you you reap with
[1:21:48] joy how many scriptures how many times
[1:21:51] that the Bible say I cried out unto the
[1:21:54] Lord how many times that David say I
[1:21:56] cried out unto the Lord one time he said
[1:21:58] this poor man cried and the Lord heard
[1:22:01] him and he delivered him this poor man
[1:22:04] cried and the Lord heard
[1:22:07] me Hallelujah I know where I come from I
[1:22:11] know what I've been through and this
[1:22:13] poor man cried and the Lord heard
[1:22:16] him hallelujah praise be to God
[1:22:20] sometimes we try to make ourself too
[1:22:22] strong for nothing
[1:22:25] sometimes you need to lay before the
[1:22:26] Lord and Lord I have no idea how I'm
[1:22:30] going to get through this month Lord I
[1:22:32] have no idea how I'm going to hold this
[1:22:35] together Lord I have no idea how I'm
[1:22:37] going to keep my job I have no idea how
[1:22:39] I'm going to keep pay my bills when you
[1:22:42] do that he will come on the scene he
[1:22:45] will come on the scene he will come on
[1:22:47] the scene call upon him call upon him uh
[1:22:51] call Upon Jesus and he will come upon
[1:22:54] the
[1:22:56] that's why he is called the god of the
[1:22:58] fatherless the god of the widows he
[1:23:01] chooses to identify himself with the
[1:23:06] vulnerable right he's the god of the
[1:23:09] blind he's the god of the those that are
[1:23:11] vulnerable he is the god to those people
[1:23:14] and he is very sensitive to their
[1:23:16] prayers yes sir so when you are
[1:23:18] vulnerable that's when God is sensitive
[1:23:20] to your
[1:23:22] prayers when was David the most
[1:23:25] spiritual those who study the Bible they
[1:23:27] will tell you when he was running away
[1:23:29] from Saul when he was in the palace he
[1:23:31] was a kind of man that's what they say
[1:23:34] you know he had problems when he was in
[1:23:36] the palace you know everything was okay
[1:23:38] but when he was running away from Saul
[1:23:39] that's why he wrought a lot of good
[1:23:42] sounds sometimes God lets us through go
[1:23:45] the through the valley when we go
[1:23:47] through the valley then we can sing
[1:23:49] something from the inside and say God is
[1:23:53] able Hal Hallelujah because you are
[1:23:55] singing from in
[1:23:57] experience there's some there's a
[1:23:59] difference between Theory and
[1:24:01] experience that's why you can never be a
[1:24:04] general in the Army unless you have
[1:24:06] physically fought
[1:24:08] battles that's right for you to be a
[1:24:11] general you have to have gone through
[1:24:13] the battles that's why when I when I
[1:24:15] look to at men like brother Jake Duff I
[1:24:19] I I learn a lot from them cuz as a young
[1:24:22] man you can study the Bible the message
[1:24:24] you can all know about it with your mind
[1:24:27] but this man have experienced they've
[1:24:29] been in the field for a long time they
[1:24:32] know something that you may not know
[1:24:34] they've seen something that you have not
[1:24:35] seen so as a young man you want to stay
[1:24:38] with your elders because you know what
[1:24:40] an elder can see further when he's
[1:24:42] sitting than when a young man can look
[1:24:44] when he's
[1:24:47] standing
[1:24:50] Hallelujah the Bible says in the Book of
[1:24:52] Proverbs the glory of the of the of the
[1:24:54] old man is in his gray hair his wisdom
[1:24:57] but the glory of the young man is in his
[1:24:59] strength but you know strength without
[1:25:02] wisdom is very very
[1:25:07] dangerous strength without wisdom is
[1:25:10] very
[1:25:13] dangerous that's why when you go to the
[1:25:15] army they have to teach you discipline
[1:25:18] because if you are powerful and you have
[1:25:21] no wisdom you are a danger to yourself
[1:25:26] [Laughter]
[1:25:29] Hallelujah and I I see young men on the
[1:25:31] field they just floating around they
[1:25:33] have no Pastor they have no church they
[1:25:35] don't pay their tithe they just going
[1:25:37] around say brother where do you come

[1:26:37] accountable you have to be
[1:26:42] accountable if you don't know the Bible
[1:26:44] says if you don't know something ask
[1:26:46] your husband if your husband doesn't
[1:26:48] know something then you can ask the
[1:26:50] pastor that's God's order that's the and
[1:26:53] the pastor has to be checked by the by
[1:26:56] the spoken words by by other ministers
[1:26:58] in the fivefold ministry you have to be
[1:27:02] accountable you this this attitude of
[1:27:05] you know this modern day attitude where
[1:27:08] I I I'm just going to be myself that's
[1:27:10] not
[1:27:12] scriptural that's a rebellious
[1:27:14] Spirit glory to God I I I just got to be
[1:27:18] me who who are you you don't even know
[1:27:22] who you are God knows who you are God
[1:27:25] tells you who you are you cannot be who
[1:27:29] you are unless God tells you who you
[1:27:33] are
[1:27:36] hallelujah
[1:27:38] hallelujah young people when they get
[1:27:41] come to an age where they want to marry
[1:27:43] sometimes you know it's like when people
[1:27:46] hunt deer there a season which they call
[1:27:49] the rat when deers come to meet they
[1:27:52] lose their mind they they drop all their
[1:27:56] defenses because of that season that's
[1:27:59] the easiest season to shoot
[1:28:01] deer and the devil knows the easiest
[1:28:04] season to shoot young people is during
[1:28:08] the marriage
[1:28:13] season you got to stay with your pastor
[1:28:15] during that season because you don't
[1:28:17] have a
[1:28:18] mind something is happening inside of
[1:28:20] you you don't know what it is the elders
[1:28:23] know what it is they can help
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:29] Hallelujah and people get under pressure
[1:28:32] they become they start
[1:28:34] advertising why are you advertising if
[1:28:37] you not selling
[1:28:44] something
[1:28:51] Instagram
[1:28:53] Hallelujah
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:28:58] may God help us this morning may God
[1:29:01] help us this morning they that wait upon
[1:29:04] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:29:07] shall Mount up with wings as the eagles
[1:29:10] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:29:12] shall walk and not
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] [Applause]
[1:29:20] faint you know why the Bible says that
[1:29:23] because the verse before that says the
[1:29:26] young men shall
[1:29:27] fail says the young men shall fail but
[1:29:31] those that wait upon the Lord those that
[1:29:34] wait upon the Lord Shing you their
[1:29:37] strength and when you do it right God
[1:29:40] gives you a goodly wife the prophet
[1:29:43] would go every year and he would go in
[1:29:46] the woods and pray just to thank God for
[1:29:49] his wife sir because when you marry a
[1:29:52] daughter of meis EDC you become a
[1:29:55] son-in-law of meis EDC but if you marry
[1:29:58] a daughter of
[1:30:01] Bello you become the son-in-law of
[1:30:08] what
[1:30:19] Hallelujah we don't have to wait for for
[1:30:22] camp we have to preach these things
[1:30:25] Revelations chapter 4 part 3 now we are
[1:30:28] living in another age Glory oh I love
[1:30:31] this age don't you God has has a mercy
[1:30:34] seat today today to be guarded so so he
[1:30:38] says you believe that where is the Mery
[1:30:40] City found in the heart of a man so we
[1:30:45] have this Mery seat in Earthly vessels
[1:30:48] but he's saying that the mercy seat had
[1:30:50] to be guarded how many knows that in the
[1:30:53] Old Testament the had shakina glory and
[1:30:56] they had they were the way they were
[1:30:58] camping they had three tribes on this
[1:31:00] side three tribes on that side three
[1:31:03] tribes on that side three tribes on that
[1:31:05] side and the Levites would also be the
[1:31:08] same because they were different types
[1:31:10] of Levites right if you you the me
[1:31:13] meites and and the different ones and
[1:31:16] Judah would be the leader of the Eastern
[1:31:19] tribe right and he would have a burner
[1:31:21] of a lion and Dan would be the leader of
[1:31:24] of of of the tribes in the North and the
[1:31:27] bner of an eagle right how many knows
[1:31:29] that and these were guarding the shakina
[1:31:32] glory they were guarding the Throne of
[1:31:35] God and to and then the prophet is
[1:31:37] saying but now the mercy seat is in the
[1:31:40] heart of the believer and because The
[1:31:42] Mercy Seat it also has to be
[1:31:45] guarded by the anointing of the liion by
[1:31:48] the anointing of the eagle by the
[1:31:50] anointing of the man and the anointing
[1:31:52] of the ox
[1:31:54] that's why proverb says 4:23 guard your
[1:31:57] heart for out of it comes the issues of
[1:32:01] life because if your heart is The Mercy
[1:32:04] Seat that's why Paul says can I take
[1:32:06] Christ's members and unite them with a
[1:32:09] harot you have to guard your heart
[1:32:12] because it is The Mercy Seat am amen
[1:32:16] amen and when you are on the internet
[1:32:18] guard your heart when you are going
[1:32:21] through the websites guard your heart
[1:32:23] Hallelujah when you're going through the
[1:32:25] streets guard your heart be careful what

[1:33:19] your marriage it's a
[1:33:21] spirit getting in the spirit amen
[1:33:24] 106 the other night as I was preaching
[1:33:26] on the subject on the news flash
[1:33:28] greatest in history John his eyes got
[1:33:32] was it was filmed over he was he was
[1:33:35] like Yeah The Spirit of Elijah and
[1:33:37] Elijah had a breakdown when he was under
[1:33:39] the juniper tree and sometimes as
[1:33:42] Christians we go through a breakdown
[1:33:44] we're not always high up on the mountain
[1:33:47] sometimes we are down in the valley
[1:33:50] sometimes you don't feel like going to
[1:33:51] church but you go anyhow some sometimes
[1:33:53] you don't feel like praying but you pray
[1:33:55] anyhow sometimes you feel like things
[1:33:57] are too hard for me I can't pay my tithe
[1:33:59] but you pay anyhow we have high we have
[1:34:02] high moments we have low moments but we
[1:34:04] remain Christians we Soldier on we keep
[1:34:07] moving forward amen and the Bible says
[1:34:10] in the Book of Ezekiel that the living
[1:34:12] creatures they tend not where they went
[1:34:15] if they would move this side they were
[1:34:17] going forward if they were moving this
[1:34:19] side they were going forward and a
[1:34:21] Christian does not go backwards it's
[1:34:23] always always moving forward when you
[1:34:25] get a raise you're moving forward uh
[1:34:27] when you get a retrenchment you're
[1:34:29] moving forward uh when you're in an
[1:34:30] apartment you're moving forward when you
[1:34:32] buy a house you are moving forward when
[1:34:34] you lose your job you are still moving
[1:34:36] forward in Jesus
[1:34:38] Christ
[1:34:41] Glory Glory Hallelujah you are always
[1:34:45] moving forward God knows what he's doing
[1:34:49] that's why Paul says everything all
[1:34:51] works together for good he says all
[1:34:55] things not some things all things all
[1:34:59] things work together for good even the
[1:35:02] boss that is giving you a hard time he's
[1:35:04] working together for good the teenager
[1:35:06] that is giving you a hard time he is
[1:35:08] working together for
[1:35:10] good
[1:35:12] hallelujah praise God Bible says in the
[1:35:16] book of Isaiah who has believed our
[1:35:18] report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:35:20] Lord revealed for he shall grow up
[1:35:23] before him and a tender plant and as a
[1:35:25] root out of a dry ground he has no form
[1:35:28] or kindliness and when we shall see him
[1:35:31] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:35:33] him that's Christ is the message of the
[1:35:36] hour there's no Beauty in the message of
[1:35:38] the hour for people to desire it it
[1:35:42] sounds different right it looks
[1:35:43] different it's different from the other
[1:35:46] denominations but you know what that's
[1:35:48] Jesus Christ amen and the Bible is
[1:35:50] saying who has believed our report to
[1:35:52] whom is the arm of of the Lord revealed
[1:35:55] the arm of the Lord is revealed the
[1:35:56] prophet preaches this sermon it's
[1:35:58] revealed you find the answer in Isaiah
[1:36:01] 28 right says says Whom Shall he teach
[1:36:04] knowledge and to whom whom should we
[1:36:07] explain the message it's just those that
[1:36:09] are wied from the breast those taken
[1:36:12] from the breast those children if you
[1:36:14] are converted like children then you can
[1:36:18] enter the kingdom if you want to see the
[1:36:20] power of God you have to be children
[1:36:24] if you want to enjoy your marriage be
[1:36:27] children there's so much bitterness
[1:36:29] because you've become too
[1:36:36] adulty oh you did this to me in 2015 6
[1:36:40] December at 2
[1:36:43] p.m. if you would apply that memory in
[1:36:46] school you'd be a doctor right now but
[1:36:49] the devil is very
[1:36:52] clever he he will make you
[1:36:55] recall things that are negative but the
[1:36:59] bad the good things he will never show
[1:37:02] you so he doesn't love you he forgot
[1:37:05] about this he forgot your your birthday
[1:37:08] in
[1:37:09] 2016 you know what that's nothing my
[1:37:11] brother have be like little children I
[1:37:14] have a three-year-old old daughter I can
[1:37:17] say I don't like what you're doing you
[1:37:19] know she cries and after after 10
[1:37:21] minutes she comes back to Daddy that's a
[1:37:24] little
[1:37:25] child and our relationship become very
[1:37:28] toxic when we lose that child like faith
[1:37:33] and child like
[1:37:35] attitude when we become too legalistic
[1:37:39] when you become too hard and too tough
[1:37:42] be little children if you want to enjoy
[1:37:44] your home be little
[1:37:46] children that's the difference between
[1:37:49] when you just got married and when you
[1:37:51] stayed in marriage you lost that
[1:37:54] but God is saying go back to that go
[1:37:57] back to being little
[1:38:03] children because you know what we attach
[1:38:05] a lot of emotion and that's okay we have
[1:38:08] emotions but we we have to offload our
[1:38:10] emotions in prayer because prayer makes
[1:38:13] us
[1:38:15] sweet and the reason why women remember
[1:38:17] a lot of things because they are
[1:38:19] naturally emotional creatures that's why
[1:38:21] you never forget something that happened
[1:38:24] to you you know like maybe let's say
[1:38:26] something bad that happened to you
[1:38:28] because because there was a lot of
[1:38:30] emotions involved it's always Vivid in
[1:38:33] your eyes how many knows
[1:38:36] that that so women because they
[1:38:38] emotional they tend to remember things a
[1:38:41] lot it's not their choice right their
[1:38:44] weaker vessels so so Brothers we have to
[1:38:47] be careful when you deal with women's
[1:38:49] emotions don't promise them something
[1:38:51] that you can't do because you're messing
[1:38:53] with her
[1:38:55] emotions be careful how you speak to her
[1:38:58] cuz you're messing with emotions
[1:39:01] Hallelujah because a woman will grab on
[1:39:03] that word because she's a type of the
[1:39:06] church as soon as you see a promise in
[1:39:08] the Bible you grab onto it Hallelujah
[1:39:12] and you say Lord you promised me and God
[1:39:16] is
[1:39:18] faithful Glory don't just brush it aside
[1:39:21] honor your promise we man we are not
[1:39:24] very emotional so that's why we we
[1:39:26] forget things easily we get emotional
[1:39:29] once in a while maybe when we buy a new
[1:39:31] truck or
[1:39:32] something you
[1:39:39] know oh when our child scratches our
[1:39:45] car say John remember how you scratched
[1:39:49] my my my my my my shave
[1:39:52] Cru I didn't like
[1:39:56] that all
[1:39:59] right Glory right sometimes you know we
[1:40:03] minister to families we want people to
[1:40:05] come into church and enjoy church we
[1:40:08] don't want to be too high people don't
[1:40:10] Lear hear anything right amen but the
[1:40:13] prophet says but to be willing to die
[1:40:15] for us he gave freely his blood at
[1:40:17] Calvary that's right he was a man of
[1:40:20] sorrow acquainted with grief he made a
[1:40:24] public testimony so what I'm driving at
[1:40:26] is is that the humanity side of
[1:40:29] Christians that we are not always going
[1:40:31] to be strong we're not always going to
[1:40:33] be
[1:40:34] smiling don't get it confused when you
[1:40:36] say I'm walking with God I'm doing
[1:40:38] everything I'm paying my tithe but
[1:40:40] things are not working out you have to
[1:40:41] remain faithful and keep holding on to
[1:40:44] God because that's part of the journey
[1:40:48] it's not a it's not like a Christianity
[1:40:50] is not like a how can I explain this
[1:40:52] it's not like okay something that you
[1:40:54] can just put your card in a slot and
[1:40:56] then money comes out it's not automatic
[1:40:59] like that you walk with God because you
[1:41:02] love him and because he loves you he is
[1:41:06] able to do these things naturally God is
[1:41:08] able to provide our needs because he
[1:41:11] loves us but that's not that's not the
[1:41:14] reason why we follow
[1:41:18] him just wait until you become a
[1:41:21] billionaire you find people looking for
[1:41:23] you that you have never had an idea that
[1:41:26] they they'll ever look for you because
[1:41:28] you know what they're looking for
[1:41:30] something and it's not
[1:41:32] you looking for
[1:41:36] something just let a young man buy a
[1:41:38] nice
[1:41:39] car you know they'll start coming but
[1:41:43] the Bride is a real woman we are not
[1:41:46] running after gifts we are running after
[1:41:48] Christ because we love him but when
[1:41:51] gifts come we appreciate it but our
[1:41:53] coming to church is because we love
[1:41:58] God
[1:42:00] Amen that's worship when you love God
[1:42:03] from all your heart you say no matter
[1:42:05] what I go through no matter what's
[1:42:07] happening in my life I love Jesus and
[1:42:09] I'm going to go to church I'm going to
[1:42:11] worship God hallelujah even if your
[1:42:14] mortgage payment is behind you say thank
[1:42:16] you
[1:42:17] jesusall
[1:42:19] Hallelujah Glory we love him because we
[1:42:22] just love him
[1:42:24] yes even if Lord you slay me I worship
[1:42:27] you even if he cast me to hell I'll
[1:42:30] still love him
[1:42:33] am oh my
[1:42:36] amen we're not trying to you know find
[1:42:39] some tricks you know just to draw
[1:42:41] something from God we actually love him
[1:42:43] from our hearts amen now because
[1:42:47] Christianity is based on love and
[1:42:49] relationship should be based on love if
[1:42:52] you base your relationships on physical
[1:42:55] things you're going to have problems
[1:42:57] because those elements
[1:42:59] change and you know
[1:43:02] what no matter how much you love
[1:43:04] something if it's given to you after
[1:43:06] some time you won't like it you want
[1:43:08] something different so if you love if
[1:43:11] you base your relationship with God and
[1:43:13] with Man based on elements you're going
[1:43:16] to have problems you'll be wanting to
[1:43:18] shift all the time because our desires
[1:43:21] are not constant because because of this
[1:43:23] Fallen
[1:43:24] nature yes you may may say ah I love
[1:43:27] Chick-fil-A that's my favorite
[1:43:29] restaurant after 3 months you say ah
[1:43:32] their their fries don't taste the same
[1:43:34] you
[1:43:36] know they nuggets they not the same you
[1:43:41] know that's why the prophet says if you
[1:43:43] marry a woman because she looks pretty
[1:43:46] there'll be an end to
[1:43:47] that but if you just something inside of
[1:43:50] you by Revelation you don't know and you
[1:43:53] marry that woman then that's an eternal
[1:43:56] me that's what the prophet
[1:43:58] says hallelujah if you go if you come to
[1:44:01] church because you've got a new job one
[1:44:03] day you're going to lose that job if you
[1:44:04] come to church just because you've got
[1:44:06] new shoes one day they're going to weigh
[1:44:07] out if you come to church just because
[1:44:09] this happened well some people say well
[1:44:12] the pastor didn't make me a deacon so
[1:44:14] I'm going to switch
[1:44:15] church then you know the right person
[1:44:17] for the job oh they didn't acknowledge
[1:44:19] me this they didn't do this it's not
[1:44:21] about you at the end of the day it's
[1:44:23] about Jesus Christ the Bible says that
[1:44:26] all things were made for him and all
[1:44:28] things were made through him and all
[1:44:30] things were made for
[1:44:32] him which means that we don't have
[1:44:35] anything right everything belongs to
[1:44:38] Christ and whatever we have it's
[1:44:42] stewardship when we have
[1:44:44] families we are just stewards when we
[1:44:48] are fathers we are stewards because you
[1:44:50] know what if you're a father you're
[1:44:52] going to give an account is a father how
[1:44:54] you raise your children if you are a
[1:44:56] mother you're going to give an account
[1:44:58] because we are
[1:44:59] stewards and the prophet says you're
[1:45:01] going to give an account of your
[1:45:03] time and he says don't judge the
[1:45:06] prostitute in the Bible because you can
[1:45:08] also prostitute your time that's a
[1:45:11] quote the time that we have we are
[1:45:14] stewards of the time we are stewards of
[1:45:17] our finances we are stewards of our
[1:45:20] resources that's why we don't waste our
[1:45:22] our resources
[1:45:24] God God and when we pay tithe we are
[1:45:28] redeeming that money because it's all
[1:45:30] supposed to belong to God because
[1:45:32] everything belongs to God but God is
[1:45:34] saying you can redeem it by paying a
[1:45:37] 10%
[1:45:38] Hallelujah can you say
[1:45:41] Amen I'm preaching types I'm not
[1:45:43] preaching about man friends don't that's
[1:45:45] good brother I'm giving
[1:45:48] types say we don't want want the brother
[1:45:50] to come back
[1:45:51] here
[1:45:54] amen hallelujah so because everything
[1:45:57] belongs to God whatever we have we are
[1:46:00] naturally stewards the job that we have
[1:46:03] we are stewards that's why the Bible
[1:46:05] says work as if you are working unto the
[1:46:08] Lord and sometimes the reason why we
[1:46:09] don't have success is the way we are
[1:46:12] working you come to church dragging your
[1:46:15] to work dragging your feet you're always
[1:46:17] complaining that's not a Christian
[1:46:19] attitude if you are a Christian you give
[1:46:21] all your heart the UN Believers must say
[1:46:23] there's something different about Aon we
[1:46:25] love Aon we love his attitude you know
[1:46:29] what I had a performance review one time
[1:46:32] and I I I vowed in my heart I said Lord
[1:46:34] I want to mess up anything technical but
[1:46:38] something to do with like coming to work
[1:46:40] early saying hi to people I must pass
[1:46:42] that with flying colors all right
[1:46:44] because that's that that's easy for a
[1:46:46] Christian to do and and the the grace of
[1:46:49] God they say we love your attitude
[1:46:51] you're a positive man yeah there's just
[1:46:53] something about you that's what that's
[1:46:55] the starting point right true and when
[1:46:58] you do that and you come here we pray
[1:47:01] for you then God is bound to bless you
[1:47:03] but when we pray for you and then you go
[1:47:05] out there you forget who you
[1:47:07] are and you join the complainers and the
[1:47:11] memor and you have an attitude towards
[1:47:13] your your boss and you have an attitude
[1:47:16] towards your work that's not the
[1:47:18] attitude of a Son of God when you are a
[1:47:20] son of God when you do something you do
[1:47:22] it well if you a farmer you do it well
[1:47:24] if you're a painter you do it well if
[1:47:26] you're a photographer you do it well if
[1:47:28] you're a doctor you do it
[1:47:30] well
[1:47:32] Hallelujah you do it because of passion
[1:47:35] not because of money you do it out of
[1:47:37] passion but because you do it
[1:47:39] passionately God is bound to give you
[1:47:41] the
[1:47:43] finances because adoption is not just
[1:47:46] preaching you can be adopted as a farmer
[1:47:50] you can be adopted as a doctor when you
[1:47:53] are a Doctor by adoption you are
[1:47:55] different from someone who's just
[1:47:56] chasing the dollar you know there's
[1:47:59] something about you when you wake up in
[1:48:01] the morning say Lord lead me I'm going
[1:48:03] to work Lord I'm going through a surgery
[1:48:06] show me how I'm supposed to do this when
[1:48:08] you have that attitude God is going to
[1:48:11] bless your
[1:48:12] hands when you have that attitude God is
[1:48:15] going to bless you even if you are
[1:48:17] driving a truck do it with
[1:48:20] passion even if you're walking working
[1:48:23] on a drive-thru do it well and pray for
[1:48:26] your
[1:48:27] job until people will say I just love
[1:48:30] that drive-through there's something
[1:48:32] different because you are a Christian
[1:48:34] and before you pick those fries you pray
[1:48:37] for them you anoint them Hallelujah
[1:48:41] Glory
[1:48:43] Hallelujah
[1:48:45] Hallelujah I have a friend in Canada his
[1:48:47] name is Timothy you went there you know
[1:48:50] being an immigrant you said I'm just
[1:48:52] looking for a job you know you know was
[1:48:54] able to get a tracking license and
[1:48:56] everything so first day supposed to
[1:48:59] start work they give him a truck they
[1:49:01] spoke to him and the owner
[1:49:04] said I know you can drive a truck I know
[1:49:07] but I just there's something different
[1:49:10] about you you're just a nice person you
[1:49:12] know what I'm going to I'm going to move
[1:49:13] you from being a truck driver if you
[1:49:15] don't mind I'm going to make you a
[1:49:16] manager of my all my
[1:49:19] restaurants says but but I've never
[1:49:21] worked in the restaurant industry says
[1:49:23] I'll teach you because I love something
[1:49:25] something about you he was a
[1:49:28] Christian when you are a Christian God
[1:49:31] opens doors for you when you have the
[1:49:33] right attitude God is able to open doors
[1:49:37] for
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:39] you sometimes we close doors for ourself
[1:49:42] and we blame the devil the devil is not
[1:49:44] even involved in your situation
[1:49:46] sometimes it's our attitude that close
[1:49:49] doors for
[1:49:51] us am exactly right when you tell
[1:49:54] someone I'm going to send you an email
[1:49:56] tomorrow morning do it if you can't do
[1:49:58] it tell them I apologize I'm not able to
[1:50:01] send you tomorrow morning can I give you
[1:50:03] on Monday that's what a Christian does
[1:50:06] people should rely on you depend upon
[1:50:08] you say this man is honest this man is
[1:50:12] honest you know everyone wants to be
[1:50:15] associated with something like that
[1:50:17] that's what Joseph
[1:50:19] heard that's what what what Joseph heard
[1:50:23] and porer would say you know what I can
[1:50:24] trust this man with all my household he
[1:50:27] would even leave and leave Joseph with
[1:50:29] his wife but some today the unbeliever
[1:50:32] say oh this one I can't leave him with
[1:50:34] my
[1:50:38] family oh Jesus oh well I'm going to I'm
[1:50:41] going on vacation but since my wife
[1:50:42] going to be here you can take some days
[1:50:46] off now Brothers I'm not saying be alone
[1:50:48] with a woman don't be alone with a woman
[1:50:51] that's what the prophet teaches I'm I'm
[1:50:52] just trying to illustrate
[1:50:55] something glory be to
[1:50:58] God even ministers you can't just trust
[1:51:01] everyone with your church you got to be
[1:51:04] Dependable a pastor should say if
[1:51:06] brother so and so comes even if I'm way
[1:51:08] I have TR confidence in him that he's
[1:51:10] not going to bring a funny Doctrine from
[1:51:12] somewhere you have to have that
[1:51:15] stability as a Christian sir amen that's
[1:51:19] good Psalms
[1:51:21] 82:6
[1:51:25] I love the sound of the B the Turning of
[1:51:27] Bibles all
[1:51:30] right and the scrolling of iPads of
[1:51:35] course just don't bring Vision PR to
[1:51:39] church when you know I see a day when
[1:51:42] people are having Vision Pros in church
[1:51:45] say let's turn our Bibles they
[1:51:48] going I hope the Rapture comes before
[1:51:51] that Psalms 82:6 I have said ye are gods
[1:51:57] and all of you are children of the most
[1:51:59] high now people stop here and they
[1:52:02] Rejoice oh we are God which is fine and
[1:52:04] I do that too but verse seven is what
[1:52:07] brings the
[1:52:08] balance but you shall die like all men
[1:52:12] and fall like one of the princes you
[1:52:15] have covid like everyone else and you go
[1:52:17] to the hospital don't say we are bright
[1:52:20] we are bright no you are bright but you
[1:52:21] can get Co
[1:52:27] you are bright but your check can
[1:52:31] bounce you are
[1:52:33] bright but you you can be sent to
[1:52:36] collection though you die like all men
[1:52:39] and fall like the princess but I have
[1:52:41] saved your
[1:52:42] Gods you say you know what though I'm a
[1:52:45] human being though I'm going but there's
[1:52:46] something in me there's a God inside of
[1:52:49] me now I'm not saying this to discourage
[1:52:51] you I'm I'm trying to show you that
[1:52:53] don't look at what is surrounding you
[1:52:56] because remember Jonah the Bible say in
[1:52:58] the Book of Jonah that those that
[1:52:59] observe lying vanities they forsake
[1:53:02] their own Mercy that's the prayer that
[1:53:04] Jonah prayed when he was in the belly of
[1:53:06] the of the well and there was you know
[1:53:11] it's so graphic you know the belly of
[1:53:12] the well everywhere that Jonah was
[1:53:14] looking and touching it was slimy but
[1:53:17] yet he prayed to God it says those that
[1:53:19] observe lying vanities they forsake
[1:53:22] their own Mercy in other words I'm not
[1:53:24] going to pay attention to what's
[1:53:26] happening around me I'm going to look to
[1:53:28] the temple I'm going to look to Jesus
[1:53:31] I'm going to say my help comes from the
[1:53:34] Lord my help comes from Jesus my help
[1:53:38] comes from above my promotion comes from
[1:53:41] above my finances come from above my
[1:53:44] health comes from
[1:53:46] above
[1:53:48] hallelujah salvation comes from above
[1:53:51] peace comes from from above Joy comes
[1:53:54] from above uh all the good things come
[1:53:56] from above my help comes from
[1:54:00] above woo
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:03] hallelujah hallelujah but you shall die
[1:54:06] like all man you shall fall like like
[1:54:09] some of the princess you also make
[1:54:12] sometimes get into arguments just like
[1:54:14] everyone else you can get frustrated
[1:54:17] through traffic like someone else when
[1:54:19] somebody cuts you on the interet
[1:54:22] you say why do they do that but you know
[1:54:26] what there is a life inside of you you
[1:54:29] say you know what but I am different and
[1:54:31] God wants us to have that mindset I'm
[1:54:34] about to close in the next 10 minutes or
[1:54:37] so now in the Old Testament the Jews
[1:54:41] were under the priesthood of Aaron and
[1:54:44] the Bible says that they were under the
[1:54:46] law because the law is for servants and
[1:54:49] slaves because remember the prophet says
[1:54:51] Jews are always God's servants but we
[1:54:55] the the Gentile bride we are Kings the
[1:54:58] Bible says he has made us Kings and
[1:55:00] priest that's right and our priesthood
[1:55:03] is not the priesthood of Aaron we
[1:55:05] receive the priesthood of melchisedek
[1:55:07] because meis was a king and he was a
[1:55:10] priest yes sir because our covenant was
[1:55:12] to walk not by the law but by grace and
[1:55:17] not disgrace but by grace and because of
[1:55:20] Grace we have revelation
[1:55:22] my skirt has to be long but if but
[1:55:26] before you become mature you are under
[1:55:29] the law because Galatians says that the
[1:55:31] law was a was a was a school Master to
[1:55:34] bring us to Christ when you live with
[1:55:37] dos and
[1:55:38] don'ts can I do this can I do this can I
[1:55:41] put my hair right can I do this you are
[1:55:43] living by the law but when you have a
[1:55:46] revelation when there's something inside
[1:55:48] of you you know where to go you know
[1:55:51] which websites to click you know which
[1:55:53] channels to watch you know which friends
[1:55:54] to hang out with you know what to do you
[1:55:56] know which places to
[1:55:59] go amen amen but if you are have a bunch
[1:56:02] of rules and regulations and everybody
[1:56:05] has to check on you and the deacons have
[1:56:07] to ask you why weren't you in church
[1:56:09] last last weekend we have not seen you
[1:56:11] in three weeks oh brother is everything
[1:56:13] okay you are still at the seventh level
[1:56:17] but when you become a Christian and you
[1:56:19] are baptized by the Holy Ghost then you
[1:56:21] are walk working as a king like that
[1:56:25] slave right who was different and they
[1:56:28] asked him do you feed him different they
[1:56:30] said
[1:56:32] no what what's different about shim he
[1:56:35] say I wondered the same until I learned
[1:56:37] that be where he comes from you as a son
[1:56:39] of a king and he conduct himself as a
[1:56:42] son of a
[1:56:44] king Hallelujah though everyone else
[1:56:47] might do this way he will go this way
[1:56:50] because remember we are in an age where
[1:56:53] people want to do things in groups
[1:56:56] everyone is doing
[1:56:57] this we call it Trends right and
[1:57:01] algorithms this is the trend this is the
[1:57:04] trend but you know what as a Son of God
[1:57:05] you always don't have to follow every
[1:57:07] Trend sometimes you need to go your own
[1:57:10] way because God deals with Jews as a
[1:57:15] group but with Gentiles he deals with us
[1:57:17] as individuals and salvation is a
[1:57:21] personal revelation
[1:57:23] of Jesus Christ to you when you have a
[1:57:26] personal revelation even if my wife
[1:57:28] stops coming to church I'll go to church
[1:57:31] even if my family stops coming to church
[1:57:33] I will go to church even if everyone
[1:57:35] criticizes me I will stay with the word
[1:57:38] I've been invited to dinners where I
[1:57:41] know that you know people are going to
[1:57:43] like a just a drinking spray being the
[1:57:46] only one to say no and I've been happy
[1:57:47] about that because you know what I'm a
[1:57:49] Christian I know where to go and way not
[1:57:52] to go I don't have to follow the crowds
[1:57:55] I follow
[1:57:59] Jesus you have to have your own personal
[1:58:03] revelation when somebody asks you why do
[1:58:05] you long you wear long skirts don't say
[1:58:07] our church church don't say our church
[1:58:11] say the Bible says the Bible says the
[1:58:14] word of God says the prophet
[1:58:18] says why don't you drink you don't even
[1:58:21] drink wine
[1:58:22] why it's like you know our church it's
[1:58:25] it's
[1:58:27] complicated it's
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:33] complicated I was in college one time
[1:58:36] and I met a
[1:58:38] sister I said and we had a conversation
[1:58:41] and I said sister would you want to
[1:58:43] receive the Holy Ghost we can you know
[1:58:45] go to some of these prayer meeting I
[1:58:46] think it'll be good and she said I'm not
[1:58:48] ready to receive the Holy Ghost I only
[1:58:50] wear long skirts because my dad dad
[1:58:52] prays for the sick I said wow what an
[1:58:54] what an answer you know you could say
[1:58:57] that there's some nothing had happened
[1:58:59] to this person but when something
[1:59:01] happens in you it's no longer my parents
[1:59:05] it's no longer my mother it's no longer
[1:59:07] my husband it's about a personal
[1:59:11] revelation Hallelujah that even if your
[1:59:14] husband would backslide and say I want
[1:59:17] you to wear this you say no honey I can
[1:59:19] do anything for you but I cannot wear
[1:59:21] this
[1:59:22] there's something that happened in the
[1:59:24] inside of the inside there's an anchor
[1:59:26] in your heart there's an anchor in your
[1:59:28] spirit there's an anchor anchored in
[1:59:31] Christ
[1:59:34] Jesus
[1:59:36] Hallelujah doing all right yes sir 1
[1:59:40] Chronicles chapter
[1:59:43] 4:9 this is a different version so you

[2:21:53] sins of anything that he had done he
[2:21:56] said but this man is blind for the glory

[2:21:59] God and I looked up the word Glory um in
[2:22:02] the Greek and it mean it's uh the word
[2:22:04] is doca and it means weight or

[2:35:58] Joseph in those trials you know God was
[2:36:01] training him the whole time training him
[2:36:03] to be humble hallu Amen to be
[2:36:06] responsible with the little bit that he
[2:36:08] had even when he threw him in prison he
[2:36:10] still had to be responsible amen and
[2:36:12] then God took Joseph from prison to
[2:36:14] power all right there some people you
[2:36:17] know we you know it's your attitude
[2:36:19] while you on that job y you at the same
[2:36:21] spot you asking God to promote me
[2:36:23] promote me promote me you know I worked
[2:36:25] a job brother Jack and my boss she used
[2:36:28] to say derogatory terms to me every
[2:36:31] single day and my wife would hear her on
[2:36:33] the phone my wife said you don't let her
[2:36:35] talk to you like that let me talk to
[2:36:37] her she used to say call me out of my
[2:36:40] name she uh would bring up like slavery
[2:36:44] times and my mentality was like slave
[2:36:46] thinking but I was humble Lord Jes and I
[2:36:49] was was quiet and I was faithful and I
[2:36:51] paid my tithe Amen brother Aaron amen I
[2:36:56] paid my tithe and offering there's a
[2:36:58] conjunction there it's not just
[2:37:01] 10% you see when you just give God just
[2:37:04] enough he'll give you just enough oh
[2:37:06] come
[2:37:08] on Amen you got to watch your attitude

[2:37:14] paying
[2:37:15] [Music]
[2:37:17] ties amen the Bible say says he loves a
[2:37:20] cheerful Giver amen he wants you to give
[2:37:22] with the right attitude amen and so I I
[2:37:25] was doing that for four years brother
[2:37:27] Jack four years and God said because you
[2:37:30] were faithful with that I'll take you
[2:37:31] from working for people to working for
[2:37:34] yourself that's not just for me sir
[2:37:37] that's for you amen but you got to
[2:37:40] believe it the right mental attitude
[2:37:43] towards any Divine promise shall bring
[2:37:46] it to
[2:37:47] pass amen so let's change our attitude
[2:37:52] amen don't just come to this church and
[2:37:53] be satisfied having a seat where you
[2:37:55] sitting you pray over that seat God I
[2:37:57] need you to transform this condition I
[2:37:59] need you to transform this this uh
[2:38:01] building transform us from here and put
[2:38:03] us in another place amen so that we can
[2:38:06] worship more free so that we can run
[2:38:08] circles around the building amen how
[2:38:11] many believe that this morning I I want
[2:38:13] to run circles around the building amen
[2:38:16] I want to see sister cop shout around
[2:38:18] the church amen sister Birds March one
[2:38:21] more time glory be to God Amen y'all got
[2:38:25] to forgive me my cheese is a little bit
[2:38:27] off my cracker amen but I still love God
[2:38:33] Amen so again I I just want to thank
[2:38:35] brother Jack Amen um let's slow it down
[2:38:38] just a little bit amen uh let's just
[2:38:42] sing that Gyra you are
[2:38:45] enough amen amen and then I turn it back
[2:38:47] over to brother Jack but brother Jack
[2:38:49] I'm so happy to be here amen we love you
[2:38:52] we appreciate you appreciate you taking
[2:38:54] all my phone calls all my text
[2:38:57] messages amen appreciate your prayers
[2:39:01] well I told Brother Jack I said you know
[2:39:03] the doctor said that my son have uh
[2:39:05] autism I said but I don't believe that
[2:39:07] he said brother Jo I don't believe that
[2:39:09] either he said because God gave you your
[2:39:11] son he don't give you no halfway
[2:39:13] blessing so he says start calling him
[2:39:17] Miracle amen because that's who he is is
[2:39:20] amen he's a miracle amen I believe that
[2:39:23] God shall supply all of my needs amen
[2:39:26] not some of them you know I was
[2:39:29] preaching I say this last thing and when
[2:39:31] we'll sing it I was
[2:39:33] preaching uh a word about the uh man at
[2:39:37] the pool of Bethesda Bible says he tried
[2:39:39] 37 times to get in but when Jesus came
[2:39:41] he asked him would he be made holy said
[2:39:44] every time I try to go and get in the
[2:39:45] water somebody just kind of jumps ahead
[2:39:47] of me amen you know what the prophet
[2:39:50] said he said you know there was nothing
[2:39:52] wrong with that that man he wasn't
[2:39:55] crippled he said he wasn't crippled you
[2:39:57] know when we read it in the Scriptures
[2:39:58] it looked like he was crippled but the
[2:40:00] prophet of God said he had a
[2:40:03] disease he said he had something in his
[2:40:05] mind that was preventing him from
[2:40:07] believing oh my help somebody I don't I
[2:40:10] don't want to preach behind the
[2:40:13] preacher but sometimes what we think is
[2:40:16] the problem is not the problem what the
[2:40:18] problem is is our faith we don't really
[2:40:21] believe like we're supposed to believe
[2:40:24] and that is causing a condition in our
[2:40:26] mind and we think it's our legs but it's
[2:40:28] our faith because see I've learned
[2:40:31] through my life that the impossible with
[2:40:34] you is an opportunity for God to do the
[2:40:37] possible let me say it again the
[2:40:39] impossible with you is an opportunity
[2:40:41] for God to do the possible because
[2:40:44] nothing is impossible for God Amen so he
[2:40:47] provides I believe it this morning he
[2:40:50] provides I believe he heals I believe he
[2:40:53] opens doors that no man can shut amen I
[2:40:56] believe he's a same God yesterday and
[2:41:00] today and forever amen amen how many

[2:45:07] were leaving I said I thank
[2:45:09] God that when you all serve God the way
[2:45:13] that you serve him then these are the
[2:45:15] blessings that you can look forward to
[2:45:19] and see if the Holy Ghost can keep you
[2:45:21] in West Palm
[2:45:22] Beach then the same Holy Ghost can keep
[2:45:26] you in Paris and keep you in London
[2:45:30] it'll keep you in Sweden you ain't
[2:45:33] trying to get somewhere where you can
[2:45:34] get off to the side and do something
[2:45:35] that you're not supposed to be doing
[2:45:38] you're going to let the Holy Ghost keep
[2:45:39] you wherever you go praise the Lord but
[2:45:42] when you serve God he's able to bless
[2:45:44] you in ways that go beyond your
[2:45:47] expectations
[2:45:50] and I like to just say while they was
[2:45:51] there enjoying themselves we was right

[2:47:24] exactly what we needed last last night
[2:47:27] he was preaching on maturity and how we
[2:47:29] just do some some things that we allow
[2:47:32] the the devil to do in our life that we
[2:47:34] have not matured from and we got the
[2:47:37] Holy Ghost and it's been 30 years and
[2:47:40] like he say sometime the devil give you
[2:47:42] elephant memory you remember something

[2:47:47] that it happened and and refuse to let
[2:47:49] it
[2:47:50] go come on somebody we got to get free
[2:47:53] from that I remember one time somebody
[2:47:56] did something to me and I knew that it
[2:47:57] was wrong they was wrong and um and but
[2:48:01] I I I I I I pretty much said Within
[2:48:04] Myself whether they come to apologize to
[2:48:06] me or not I'm going to forgive them and
[2:48:08] I'm going to keep moving on and when I
[2:48:10] would see that person I would greet them
[2:48:12] God bless you and they know what they
[2:48:13] said to me they send an apology through
[2:48:16] somebody else so don't worry about it
[2:48:19] somebody else didn't say it you said it
[2:48:22] but you ain't you ain't big enough to
[2:48:23] apologize I'm big enough to

[2:49:18] you're you're expecting that you're not
[2:49:20] expecting us to be the same that we were
