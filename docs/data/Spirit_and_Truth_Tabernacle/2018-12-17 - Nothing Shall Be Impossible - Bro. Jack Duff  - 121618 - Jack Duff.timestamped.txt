[55:28] Carolina Amen on today and I I'm just
[55:35] very grateful last night we had a
[55:37] wonderful time and brother Jerry just
[55:40] did a excellent job a man
[55:45] and title last night was a season to
[55:49] prosper and and I'm in that season now
[55:53] I'm receiving that and you know we just
[55:56] we were just blessed you know just by it
[55:59] by the word trying to worship and you
[56:01] know on the statements he made is when
[56:04] you compromise you compensate the devil
[56:08] because when you compromise you
[56:11] compensate the devil say well my god
[56:16] brother that was that was alright I had
[56:19] the right that went down and hold on to
[56:21] it but we don't want to compromise and
[56:23] make any agreements with Satan a man we
[56:26] want to do all that God has called us to
[56:28] do he said a curse can be disguised as a
[56:33] blessing a man they say it's a curse but
[56:38] it's disguised as a blessing say the
[56:41] devil will initiate blessings but there
[56:45] were coming into it and say but when God
[56:47] initiates blessings they are endless and
[56:51] that's a good God brother keep going but
[56:56] he just did a excellent job they men
[56:59] here in the house of the Lord and and
[57:01] and I'm just I'm just very very grateful
[57:04] to see what the Lord is doing a man in
[57:07] our myths appreciate just everyone that
[57:11] was able just to kind of be a part and I
[57:14] have to give some kudos to sister
[57:18] Jessica she had to hold it down by
[57:20] herself
[57:20] and she did a good job she did a really
[57:24] good job and I mean we got into that
[57:29] Baba over on my boy that one that's
[57:32] going bad best that that felt pretty
[57:34] good
[57:34] you know I know but I mean she was
[57:37] playing that on Wednesday night when she
[57:38] opened up the service and I said yeah
[57:40] yes that that we can sing that again on
[57:42] sat on Saturday and just you know just a
[57:46] real real good anointing that was here
[57:49] in this place on last night and my
[57:51] desire my hope is that as we move
[57:55] forward with these services
[57:57] I'll be able to just kind of pass a
[57:59] baton over to some other some of the
[58:03] young preachers in the young Amen song
[58:05] leaders and and you know just just sit
[58:08] and just enjoyed them and just let them
[58:09] take the service say you you do the song
[58:11] leading you do to preach in and then we
[58:13] gonna sit back and just enjoy ourselves
[58:16] in the presence of the Lord and I tell
[58:19] you as a parent there is no greater joy
[58:22] for a parent and to see their children
[58:25] serve in the Lord amen there is no
[58:28] greater joy to see them having the same
[58:30] convictions the same desires a man to
[58:34] follow God's Word that is the greatest
[58:36] accomplishment that a parent can have is
[58:39] the living example and they'll see their
[58:41] children follow that example so we we we
[58:44] were very happy Amen just to see what
[58:47] our our youth was doing there was a
[58:49] testimony that I wanted to be shared
[58:53] today and I didn't hear that
[58:55] I didn't hear the praise report I didn't
[58:58] hear it so we gotta get it
[59:01] a man sister Charisse gonna come in a
[59:03] second and share a little testimony a
[59:06] man praise the Lord
[59:09] but amen praise the Lord
[59:13] and you know just there was a couple of
[59:16] things I won't I really want two
[59:18] testimonies to go forth to team one from
[59:20] sister Charisse and love brother Jerry I
[59:23] need you to just share your testimony
[59:27] that you share it last night you didn't
[59:31] really give everything so just just
[59:35] share a little bit of that testimony
[59:36] again today I think it would be
[59:38] beneficial so I'll have them but before
[59:41] they come on I just wanted to just
[59:43] quickly announce the sister Charisse you
[59:44] can make your way just want to quickly
[59:46] announce you all just continue to keep
[59:49] the sister Rebecca and brother Maurice
[59:52] in prayer they decided to just bring the
[59:56] courtship to a close so just keep them
[59:59] both in prayer as they go forward and on
[1:00:03] their journey so just want to announce
[1:00:04] that I announce from this pulpit that
[1:00:06] they were in a courtship but also
[1:00:08] unannounced
[1:00:09] they're no longer a man in a courtship
[1:00:11] so just keep them both in prayers they
[1:00:13] go forward and man sister Charisse if
[1:00:16] you would come brother Jerry if you
[1:00:18] would
[1:00:19] following her I want you just to kind of
[1:00:21] share cuz everybody don't know your
[1:00:22] testimony a man god bless you praise the
[1:00:25] Lord I've heard this morning to give it
[1:00:33] but okay I can try to remember
[1:00:37] everything but yesterday I graduated and
[1:00:42] got my certification as a dental
[1:00:44] assistant I felt like the longest two
[1:00:52] months of my life but it was good and I
[1:00:55] praise God and thank him for it um while
[1:00:58] in school I was well actually the school
[1:01:03] that I found it really worked out for me
[1:01:06] it was an accelerated course but it
[1:01:10] worked out where I was able to be able
[1:01:13] to work both my jobs and meet the
[1:01:16] requirements that the school had which
[1:01:17] was to find an externship site to work
[1:01:22] and also while there the training that I
[1:01:29] received there was good the doctor that
[1:01:32] was there they were really nice to me
[1:01:34] and just really took me under their wing
[1:01:36] and helped me and while in school one of
[1:01:41] my instructors gave us some information
[1:01:44] about a job that was looking for a
[1:01:47] dental assistant and when she first was
[1:01:50] like oh does anybody live in Jupiter the
[1:01:53] class was like silent and I was just
[1:01:54] like well I'm willing to drive to
[1:01:56] Jupiter and always in my mind thinking
[1:01:59] like I'm not trying to go go all the way
[1:02:01] Jupiter drive up there for a job but I'm
[1:02:03] like you know I'll fill out or send a
[1:02:07] quick email and just submit a resume
[1:02:10] really quick not really thinking
[1:02:12] anything of it and I was actually at
[1:02:14] work when I sent the email and maybe
[1:02:19] about 15-20 minutes later I got
[1:02:22] response back from the office manager
[1:02:24] and we set it up we're on my lunch break
[1:02:27] I would go for an interview so when I
[1:02:31] went for the interview we talked
[1:02:33] everything seemed great and by the end
[1:02:35] of the interview she was she was saying
[1:02:38] oh I like you I think you'd be really
[1:02:41] good fit for the office and she said I
[1:02:45] can't give you a definite answer today
[1:02:47] but I'm gonna submit and put in that I
[1:02:49] think you should get the job so you know
[1:02:51] I was excited happy a little you know
[1:02:53] nervous about it too because I knew I
[1:02:56] was fresh out of school and I didn't
[1:02:57] think you know most offices want like
[1:03:00] experience people to work in their
[1:03:01] office so I mean I prayed but I really
[1:03:06] didn't you know give my all a because I
[1:03:08] just didn't think I would get it so
[1:03:10] maybe a couple days later no Thursday I
[1:03:14] got the final email from the office
[1:03:18] actually I think it was one from the
[1:03:20] office manager and then one from it was
[1:03:22] like some executive person of this of
[1:03:24] the dental office and she was like I
[1:03:26] just wanted to reach out to you and
[1:03:27] personally congratulate you and saying
[1:03:29] that we would like you to join our team
[1:03:31] and it was funny because I was just like
[1:03:34] oh I mean I got excited they wanted me
[1:03:36] to actually start Monday and I'm like I
[1:03:38] can't have to get my job in the two
[1:03:40] weeks notice and they worked it out
[1:03:42] where I would actually start the end of
[1:03:45] this month and there because of the
[1:03:50] situation where they're having another
[1:03:51] doctor come in they would only be there
[1:03:53] three days and the other two days they
[1:03:56] said they still want me to come in and
[1:03:57] basically they would train me on the job
[1:04:00] to meet their expectations she was
[1:04:03] saying like in a couple of months she's
[1:04:05] gonna send me to some classes to help me
[1:04:07] also and I was just really grateful for
[1:04:10] that because I was so nervous at first
[1:04:12] about it but it seemed that it was all
[1:04:14] coming together even down to the pay
[1:04:16] because the pay that I heard you know
[1:04:18] that they usually start with I mean I
[1:04:21] was happy with it I was willing to start
[1:04:23] with it but then I was like oh I prayed
[1:04:25] and I was like money
[1:04:28] and so when I opened the email and I
[1:04:30] read the late letter they actually
[1:04:32] paying me almost like two dollars
[1:04:33] actually than when I asked God to
[1:04:35] blessing would don't really grateful for
[1:04:37] that yeah and I didn't know this until
[1:04:42] yesterday when one of my instructors was
[1:04:44] talking to me and my mom and she was
[1:04:46] saying that immediately after the
[1:04:48] interview the lady her name is Jennifer
[1:04:51] she called the school and she was like I
[1:04:54] don't know who this girl is but I want
[1:04:56] her I want her to work in the office I
[1:04:58] don't know what we have to do and if
[1:04:59] she's first I was cool but whatever she
[1:05:01] whoever she is you know I just want let
[1:05:03] you know that she belongs in our office
[1:05:05] and I would like for her to work for us
[1:05:07] so I was grateful about that is the Lord
[1:05:15] thank God for blessing my precious
[1:05:18] sister and just celebrated our 21st
[1:05:21] birthday a man last week in and then got
[1:05:24] all this good news and and and the other
[1:05:28] part to this is that some time ago I
[1:05:31] don't know who all went but there was a
[1:05:33] few Saints I don't know if it was a
[1:05:35] church or over the church okay and they
[1:05:39] went into it was a concert okay all
[1:05:44] right they so they went to a church full
[1:05:46] of concert and I think at the end of it
[1:05:48] somehow someone prophesied to sister
[1:05:51] Charisse that night and said that they
[1:05:53] saw her working in the dental field and
[1:05:58] and some kind of way to the prophecy hit
[1:06:02] her but then Sarah got a hold of it and
[1:06:05] and she started you know down that track
[1:06:08] and and sister Charisse the prophecy has
[1:06:11] come to pass a man in her life so we're
[1:06:15] affected on for that I thank God for
[1:06:18] that
[1:06:19] brother Jerry one second before you come
[1:06:22] sister Alana Axl she could just share a
[1:06:24] testimony so i'ma let her come and then
[1:06:26] after after that then you'll come all
[1:06:28] right amen now I'm letting sister Ellen
[1:06:32] do this cuz she ain't with us every
[1:06:33] Sunday so everybody please don't get
[1:06:36] inspired
[1:06:38] alright praise the Lord god bless you
[1:06:45] Church is what it's been a while I'm
[1:06:48] glad to see everyone it's glad to be I'm
[1:06:53] glad to be home I am a little nervous
[1:07:00] I thank God for all the goodness that he
[1:07:04] has done for me from all my life
[1:07:09] sometimes he take us through path and we
[1:07:12] question and like God where are you
[1:07:15] going with me so I just trust me child
[1:07:17] I'm taking you where you need to be um I
[1:07:22] started with my move I was nervous about
[1:07:25] it but I'm looking at everything that's
[1:07:27] taking place in my life after my moved I
[1:07:30] know that God was with me he was
[1:07:32] directing me and it was just the season
[1:07:35] for him to do something else in my life
[1:07:38] just when I knew you know my dad don't
[1:07:40] speak English because my dad was in
[1:07:44] Haiti and by the time he came here
[1:07:45] within three week we didn't find jump
[1:07:47] for him he moved to North Carolina so
[1:07:49] right when I move I took him to a doctor
[1:07:51] um unfortunately the result was he was
[1:07:55] diagnosed with cancer so it was a great
[1:07:58] time that I moved to helped him out with
[1:08:00] the process and you know cancer is
[1:08:03] something that's very very big not only
[1:08:07] he has cancer he have other things too
[1:08:09] like diabetic and blood pressure so his
[1:08:13] health is always on the scale when you
[1:08:19] know we we have a lot we have the family
[1:08:21] in Haiti that we've been trying to get
[1:08:23] here and we're immigration with troubles
[1:08:26] harder now so we have been trying it's
[1:08:31] been over three years and the processes
[1:08:33] just keep going backward the more
[1:08:35] backward you go the more money you spend
[1:08:38] so finally I got the doctor we scheduled
[1:08:41] to start treating the cancer and you
[1:08:44] know it was just me and my dad both of
[1:08:46] us nervous and each time we go he he
[1:08:49] wasn't ready and the doctor wouldn't do
[1:08:51] it
[1:08:52] and it was tough for me too because I've
[1:08:54] dealt with two cancer family that was
[1:08:57] close to me sister Sam and sister Eve
[1:09:00] and I know God can heal at the same time
[1:09:03] I look at also to plan B of the two
[1:09:06] people that he took and it was their
[1:09:08] time so I'm going back and forth I'm
[1:09:12] like I have my dad if you know we go
[1:09:15] through the treatment things don't work
[1:09:17] I need to be oh my goodness how am I
[1:09:20] gonna do this funeral all the way in
[1:09:21] North Carolina by myself and not only
[1:09:23] that back home when you have people back
[1:09:26] home you are responsible for them even
[1:09:29] after they get married and have kids so
[1:09:31] I have seven I have six siblings in
[1:09:33] Haiti and hate seeing my dad's wife so
[1:09:37] all that is I'm planning I'm like a god
[1:09:39] I'm praying but also you know in my back
[1:09:41] of my head if that it doesn't happen so
[1:09:45] I'm praying I'm planning and I'm like
[1:09:46] okay if something happened to my dad I
[1:09:48] have me and the seven loved ones that
[1:09:50] there will be my four sponsibility so I
[1:09:53] got the doctor involved before we had a
[1:09:55] another schedule to treat the cancer and
[1:09:58] I asked them please can you write a very
[1:10:01] nice letter for me have your card
[1:10:03] everything so I can send it to the
[1:10:06] Immigration Department so they can see
[1:10:10] if we can expedite it and he did he
[1:10:13] would have let us say they need the wife
[1:10:14] to be present and everything and
[1:10:16] immediately within three days I got a
[1:10:19] lot of respond they X but they shipped
[1:10:21] it to Haiti and everything was approved
[1:10:23] it's supposed to be here a year ago but
[1:10:25] Haiti we got stuck and one thing after
[1:10:29] another did not when we got to the final
[1:10:32] denied in I mean case closed we start
[1:10:34] from scratch more money to be spent I
[1:10:37] called my dad's wife I'm like Stan
[1:10:39] Prayer this is week if I tell my dad
[1:10:42] this is denying he might pass out
[1:10:45] something would take place but you
[1:10:47] cannot tell him if you choose to tell
[1:10:49] him just tell me the casket color you
[1:10:52] want cuz he will die on me so we pray
[1:10:55] she's really a great prayer where we
[1:10:58] pray we pray she had an appointment
[1:10:59] before the cancel cancellation I'm like
[1:11:02] still go to the appointment by faith so
[1:11:04] she went i'ma cut my testimony sure cuz
[1:11:07] I haven't been here a while so a lot of
[1:11:09] good things has been happening to me so
[1:11:12] she went to the she went to the
[1:11:14] immigration and then they just told her
[1:11:18] okay well we're looking into your case
[1:11:20] they gave her the visa back when they
[1:11:22] give you the visa back that's it that's
[1:11:24] it you're done
[1:11:26] so they give it back last month I was
[1:11:30] home my sister came to visit me she
[1:11:34] heard she herself was with child and
[1:11:36] that child was to be was supposed to be
[1:11:38] lost but God blessed her through prayer
[1:11:40] the baby was less than one pound so when
[1:11:44] it was time for me to see the baby she
[1:11:45] came to see me I was off we got a phone
[1:11:49] call I know all the fake calls you get
[1:11:51] because I work at the bank I hear it all
[1:11:53] the time
[1:11:54] and it was like immigration was like
[1:11:56] what it was a Miami number and there was
[1:11:58] speaking Creole and they say they're in
[1:12:00] Haiti I'm like okay this can be more
[1:12:03] fake than fake so we listen and they're
[1:12:06] like is this jean-claude it was like yes
[1:12:09] it was October the 10th time I believe
[1:12:12] it was is this Jean Claude we say yes do
[1:12:15] you have the money to buy the plane
[1:12:16] ticket
[1:12:17] well like plane ticket we haven't have a
[1:12:19] visa interview or to go to the
[1:12:23] immigration and the lady was like we are
[1:12:25] the visa Department if you agree you
[1:12:27] have the money to get them here in two
[1:12:29] days well we'll call on your stepmom to
[1:12:32] come and get the visa I was like today's
[1:12:36] today's look yes how the money yes yes
[1:12:39] but and then they call them they want to
[1:12:41] pick up the visa see when God is
[1:12:44] blessing you it you don't have time like
[1:12:46] two days the once they call you for the
[1:12:50] visa I usually takes about three months
[1:12:51] or four months two days we had to get
[1:12:54] the family here we did apply for seven
[1:12:57] and six was approved so I think God
[1:13:01] because we were the whole case was gonna
[1:13:03] be denied then we were approved for
[1:13:05] Latorre by the grace of God six was
[1:13:08] approved my oldest sister was left
[1:13:10] behind we're keeping her in prayer but
[1:13:13] once I got the ticket I call system
[1:13:18] like I'm coming I'm coming to pick up
[1:13:20] the family I'm not saying at least only
[1:13:21] one day trip we came Saturday morning
[1:13:24] Saturday night we left so I think God
[1:13:27] for that that's the biggest breakthrough
[1:13:30] because with any little news I get about
[1:13:34] the immigration see you learn about love
[1:13:38] when you when you go through love with
[1:13:40] somebody that loved you unconditionally
[1:13:41] any news I get I will hide it from my
[1:13:45] dad because I was protecting him any
[1:13:48] little thing that went through it he
[1:13:50] heard about it he would not eat for two
[1:13:53] week he end up in the hospital something
[1:13:56] I can't let him know so I think God that
[1:13:59] He blessed us it was not the immigration
[1:14:02] that called two days we had to go
[1:14:05] backward and we would have been spending
[1:14:06] about $7000 again just about so in those
[1:14:10] two days it was God and went inside our
[1:14:13] office got our profile whoever was
[1:14:15] sitting in that dance he spoke with them
[1:14:18] it and told him call the United States
[1:14:21] this family need to be here
[1:14:22] so I think God I there's no word there's
[1:14:27] no thank you I can't tell God because he
[1:14:30] has spared the Dylan wah family greatly
[1:14:32] and you I'm pretty sure you've seen the
[1:14:35] news how Haiti is on the trial that go

[1:18:22] it sometimes when you're looking at
[1:18:25] things from a American perspective you
[1:18:30] don't understand the struggle but the
[1:18:33] struggle is real
[1:18:35] but uh but I appreciate that sister Juan
[1:18:38] thank you so much for sharing that
[1:18:39] brother Jerry hey man god bless you just
[1:18:43] come share a little bit of what you were
[1:18:45] telling a writer last night
[1:18:47] god bless you church
[1:18:51] how many thanked the Lord for His
[1:18:53] blessings
[1:18:55] I know a sister Rolande was speaking it
[1:18:59] just brought to my attention that um
[1:19:01] when God is when God is ready to change
[1:19:04] your season there's nothing you can do
[1:19:06] about it
[1:19:07] but it brings me back to the beginning
[1:19:11] of this year I mean I can start even
[1:19:14] beyond that but I remember when I was
[1:19:18] just preparing for my trip and to Israel
[1:19:22] my trip to Israel and it seemed like so
[1:19:25] much happened so fast because at the
[1:19:28] time it was the month of April and I was
[1:19:32] working I had just picked up a second
[1:19:34] job and I was I was working so much and
[1:19:40] all of a sudden things just shifted I
[1:19:43] had lost my job and then I went and I
[1:19:48] continued with the journey of going to
[1:19:50] Israel knowing that I prayed about it
[1:19:52] and the Lord opened that door so I went
[1:19:56] and one of the greatest thing that
[1:20:00] happened was was that I I I know brother
[1:20:04] Jack he he kept mentioning we're gonna
[1:20:06] go to this place we're gonna pray write
[1:20:08] your prayer Nakano on a piece of paper
[1:20:11] and I took that to heart
[1:20:13] and I prayed and I told the Lord these
[1:20:15] things that I'm praying for I'm looking
[1:20:18] for them to come to pass and as I came
[1:20:22] back from Israel it seemed like things
[1:20:26] even got worse but I had a great desire
[1:20:30] in my heart that I've been praying for
[1:20:32] that that God granted and and that was
[1:20:35] to sow seed with with the building fund
[1:20:38] and it was a sacrifice but I was willing
[1:20:43] to I was willing to make that sacrifice
[1:20:45] because I knew that the kingdom of God
[1:20:49] needed to it needed to grow so I sold
[1:20:54] that seed and and and and I had those
[1:20:57] news those those news that I didn't have
[1:21:00] my job anymore my car I had got into an
[1:21:03] incident just before going to Israel and
[1:21:05] my car was still in the shop I didn't
[1:21:07] have nowhere to go no try
[1:21:09] rotation and after a few days
[1:21:13] I spoke to a brother and it was actually
[1:21:15] brother Josue and he just gave me some
[1:21:18] encouraging words and then I heard news
[1:21:20] that I had they had replacement mom they
[1:21:23] gave me another job it was security so
[1:21:25] they had gave me another post that was
[1:21:27] paying more so that was a blessing there
[1:21:29] and and I was thankful for it but I
[1:21:32] still didn't have the transportation and
[1:21:34] with all of that happening I was I was
[1:21:37] in the I was in the process of starting
[1:21:39] my school for my barber license and the
[1:21:45] schooling for that is all the way in
[1:21:46] Orlando and it was gonna be so such a
[1:21:51] long drive and and you're talking about
[1:21:53] not even having a car so it's just
[1:21:56] seeing nearly like how was this gonna
[1:21:58] happen I have to go to Orlando I don't
[1:22:01] have them car yet and and and I'm and I
[1:22:04] still have to work to to sustain myself
[1:22:07] and as I just began to pray to the Lord
[1:22:13] he he it just took a long just took a
[1:22:18] long time so my frustration the devil
[1:22:21] was just there to remind me of
[1:22:24] everything and and that God is not there
[1:22:27] and and all of these things and I just
[1:22:30] remember option came to mind and that
[1:22:34] option was was well maybe you can go to
[1:22:37] the military you've always wanted to do
[1:22:39] that and I that that desire just came
[1:22:44] like a rushing wind and and I wanted to
[1:22:47] act on it and and because I thought the
[1:22:50] time was fitting and and I just thought
[1:22:52] it was gonna be you know convenient for
[1:22:55] me at the time and the mind um the plan
[1:22:59] was I couldn't I can pursue those plans
[1:23:01] later after I'm done so I went to the
[1:23:04] office
[1:23:04] a I went to the office the branch I got
[1:23:07] all the information and and it was it
[1:23:09] was almost as good as done as far as my
[1:23:12] commitment but I consulted with some
[1:23:15] people brother Jack being one of those
[1:23:17] people and and he just told me to seek
[1:23:20] the Lord's will
[1:23:22] but as I began to batter those two those
[1:23:25] two paths that I needed to take I
[1:23:27] realized that one path was gonna lead me
[1:23:31] to the unknown and one path was gonna
[1:23:33] lead me it seemed like it was gonna be
[1:23:36] the answer but I had the question myself
[1:23:39] was was I gonna compromise what the Lord
[1:23:42] has for me that's when I realized that
[1:23:45] if I compromise at any time I'll be
[1:23:47] compensating the devil so I made the
[1:23:51] decision that I was gonna I was going to
[1:23:53] neglect I was gonna deny that and I was
[1:23:56] gonna go with the barber I was gonna go
[1:23:57] to school and when I made that decision
[1:23:59] I was around the month of July and there
[1:24:04] all of that faithfully God had allowed
[1:24:05] me to come to church every Sunday coming
[1:24:07] to Bible study and and just making a way
[1:24:10] out of no way and I've not committed to
[1:24:13] the Lord it was a Sunday where I just
[1:24:15] had no way of getting to work I was
[1:24:18] working overnight I had no way to the
[1:24:20] point I just called off of work and I
[1:24:22] said you know I just can't make it
[1:24:24] tonight
[1:24:24] and they needed me to be I worked so bad
[1:24:28] that they had the supervisor come pick
[1:24:30] me up
[1:24:30] the supervisor came to pick me up and as
[1:24:33] we drove to the work we just had such a
[1:24:35] powerful conversation telling him about
[1:24:38] the Lord and everything and about the
[1:24:40] end of that night he asked me he said
[1:24:43] you know what Jerry I'm so glad I met
[1:24:45] you I needed to hear all that
[1:24:47] you're telling me my mother just passed
[1:24:48] away I just moved from California and
[1:24:51] and I need you to pray for me can we do
[1:24:53] that I said yes we can pray so I prayed
[1:24:55] for him and at that very night yeah the
[1:24:59] Lord just kind of revealed to me he said
[1:25:00] you know what whatever you whatever car
[1:25:04] that your desire and go and get it
[1:25:06] tomorrow so I went to the dealership
[1:25:08] you're not not really expecting much and
[1:25:11] just like that I left that very day with
[1:25:14] the lot with a with a 2000 17 car so
[1:25:17] that was a great blessing that I wasn't
[1:25:21] expected
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:24] and I was able to go with the with the I
[1:25:28] was able to continue and eventually go
[1:25:30] to the school in Orlando so it was a
[1:25:31] drive every week to Orlando by two at
[1:25:33] two hours and a half and that school
[1:25:36] itself it was supposed to be about a
[1:25:38] six-month my program and I went there
[1:25:42] and within within a month and a half I
[1:25:46] just started to prayers like Lord it's
[1:25:48] it's really hard it's kind of you know
[1:25:51] it's kind of just deteriorating my body
[1:25:54] and I'm working and I'm still having
[1:25:56] such a lord I just need you to give me
[1:25:58] the strength or I need you to bypass the
[1:26:00] process and within um two weeks later
[1:26:05] and I spoke to the instructor and she
[1:26:08] told me she gave me some book so you
[1:26:10] know I start studying this and it was
[1:26:12] like study questions for the test and I
[1:26:15] didn't know why she gave it to me but I
[1:26:17] think within exactly three months I
[1:26:20] spoke to her one last time and she told
[1:26:22] me you're you're you're you're done the
[1:26:25] time the time has come you know and and
[1:26:27] she told me I'm gonna give you a
[1:26:30] certificate all I need is for you to pay
[1:26:32] the remaining balance so I didn't
[1:26:35] hesitate I took care of it and when I
[1:26:37] checked the certificate she had already
[1:26:39] at those two weeks that had passed she
[1:26:42] had already made that made the
[1:26:44] certificate so it was already
[1:26:46] predestinated plan so I had thanked the
[1:26:49] Lord for that and going going beyond
[1:26:53] that with me finishing having just
[1:26:56] really walking by faith not knowing
[1:26:58] where I was gonna be placed at what shop
[1:27:02] brother Mike he owns a shop
[1:27:05] he owns a shop right right right right
[1:27:08] near here and when I spoke to him I told
[1:27:11] him what had happened and it seemed like
[1:27:14] as the law was working in in my life and
[1:27:16] in my situation it was working in him
[1:27:18] because he was praying for a new barber
[1:27:21] he was praying because he was going
[1:27:23] through some situations where a barber
[1:27:25] had left and he didn't know how that was
[1:27:27] gonna be worked out so I spoke to him he
[1:27:30] says he said well Jerry you know I I
[1:27:33] would be more than happy for you to be
[1:27:35] with us
[1:27:36] and so much so so much so that he said
[1:27:43] you know what I like for you to come to
[1:27:45] the shop yeah I hadn't got my license
[1:27:47] yet but I had my certificate my
[1:27:49] credentials were there and he says so
[1:27:51] much so that I would like you to come to
[1:27:52] the shop and I would like you to just
[1:27:54] take a look around get familiar with the
[1:27:56] customers and things of that matter and
[1:27:57] I said yes definitely and then he called
[1:28:00] again he's like you know what brother I
[1:28:01] want to go all the way with faith and
[1:28:04] and and I've never done this before
[1:28:07] but I actually want you to start working
[1:28:09] III believe that the Lord has brought
[1:28:13] you all the way this way
[1:28:14] and we're gonna go by faith we're gonna
[1:28:17] go all the way with it I said brother
[1:28:19] I'm receiving that and I'm also
[1:28:21] receiving that the license is already
[1:28:23] mine so I started working and and to the
[1:28:28] very first day and to now I've gotten my
[1:28:31] license and just to see the how the
[1:28:34] Lord's favor both myself and him and and
[1:28:39] and everything around me yeah I've just
[1:28:41] just been so grateful for that so just
[1:28:46] just over in regards to last night you
[1:28:49] know it was it was just such a blessing
[1:28:51] for me because I spoke about putting a
[1:28:55] claim on God's promises and I realized
[1:28:59] often times that we we we can have faith
[1:29:02] um unconsciously as brother branham said
[1:29:05] but we we were not intentional about
[1:29:10] making the claim to the promises that
[1:29:13] God has given us so I made it a personal
[1:29:16] thing for me realizing that I'm not
[1:29:19] gonna shy away from no promises whatever
[1:29:21] promise of God has made me even by the
[1:29:25] end of this year I'm gonna believe it
[1:29:27] and as we all know God is a God that
[1:29:29] bypasses processes god bless you
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:39] praise the Lord just so grateful for all
[1:29:44] the blessings of the Lord last night
[1:29:48] brother Jerry made comedy so he was
[1:29:50] asking all these different people by
[1:29:52] this you know journey to the military I
[1:29:54] said everybody was telling me yeah but
[1:29:57] one person he said that was brother Jack
[1:30:00] telling me no and and I I think I shared
[1:30:04] with him but you know being a young man
[1:30:06] myself I had those same desires to go to
[1:30:09] the military but I had a what we call a
[1:30:11] praying mama a man prayer changes things
[1:30:18] mama had mama was talking to me but you
[1:30:21] know not going cuz mom had served in the
[1:30:23] military herself and she said you know
[1:30:25] um she said at that time I wasn't even
[1:30:30] ministering but um she she knew that God
[1:30:33] had a calling on my life and she said
[1:30:36] the military is not for a man like you
[1:30:38] and she just kind of kept saying that
[1:30:41] but I couldn't hear all that that was
[1:30:44] mama talking alright so I what I decided
[1:30:47] to do was just say no you know I'm I'm
[1:30:50] going on anyway
[1:30:51] and one day she set me up and I went to
[1:30:54] church and brother Westco it pulled me
[1:30:56] in the office after serves I'm like I
[1:30:58] know I did nothing wrong so I shouldn't
[1:30:59] be in the office so he say brother Jack
[1:31:03] I just won't talk to you about this
[1:31:04] military thing that you want to do and
[1:31:07] and so you know you know ya plan on
[1:31:11] going to military sir Air Force I say
[1:31:13] yeah he say brother Jack all I need the
[1:31:15] axes have you really prayed about this
[1:31:18] are you sure God told you to do this and
[1:31:22] I couldn't tell him yes I couldn't tell
[1:31:25] him that God told me yes so I see
[1:31:28] I said well pretty about it well since I
[1:31:30] couldn't get no answer from God I had to
[1:31:32] let it go and now and and and that's
[1:31:35] when you know just recently somebody

[1:35:59] grateful for all that you've done we

[1:36:09] and God many of us might be in trial
[1:36:11] right now might not realize it still the
[1:36:13] tender hand of Jehovah leading and God

[1:36:47] earth shall be bound in heaven and what
[1:36:49] we loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:36:50] heaven so God we loose your mighty hands
[1:36:52] to touch her and then between her in her
[1:36:54] condition we place the blood of the Lord
[1:36:57] Jesus believing that you were wounded
[1:36:59] for our transgressions bruised for our
[1:37:01] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:37:03] is upon you and with your stripes we are

[1:37:27] amen I'll try to preach quick but I just
[1:37:30] want to take a topic nothing shall be
[1:37:32] impossible and man nothing shall be
[1:37:36] impossible let me just start off by
[1:37:39] reading a little quote here from faith
[1:37:41] is our victory a man will dig a little
[1:37:44] deeper in this if we can
[1:37:45] since now faith is a conqueror a man
[1:37:49] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[1:37:53] world what what does it do what is faith
[1:37:55] what is the Conqueror conquer and
[1:37:58] victory is the same right it says to
[1:38:01] conquer it means to beat down a man to
[1:38:06] override it I see I like that because
[1:38:09] you know to beat down if you've ever
[1:38:11] seen something like that you know when a
[1:38:14] beat downs not just one hitch it's
[1:38:17] multiple hits and it's time to give a
[1:38:19] devil not just one hit but but multiple
[1:38:21] hits it son it's a beatdown hallelujah
[1:38:26] glory to God amen amen and on top of
[1:38:29] your enemies are devil not your brother
[1:38:31] not your sister that your enemy is the
[1:38:33] devil if we give it a devil a beatdown
[1:38:35] and if you don't fall with this
[1:38:37] scripture I'm gonna hit him with another
[1:38:39] scripture if you don't follow it that
[1:38:41] script I'm gonna hit them with another
[1:38:42] Scripture right and I'm gonna keep
[1:38:44] hitting to that fella fall and we need
[1:38:46] down I'm gonna hit him some more praise
[1:38:48] God come on somebody say faith is a to
[1:38:54] conquer it means to beat down - to
[1:38:56] override a man to handcuff to throw into
[1:39:01] prison
[1:39:02] amen it means that the sin that once
[1:39:04] rules you you rule it now it means that
[1:39:08] you have overcome it you've whipped it
[1:39:10] alright you're greater then it is oh I
[1:39:13] feel religious right now he says which
[1:39:16] was first a sinner or a savior he says a
[1:39:20] savior for Savior is more powerful than
[1:39:23] a sin which was first the healer or a
[1:39:26] sickness it couldn't be
[1:39:28] Amen heal unless it was over the
[1:39:31] sickness it is a healer it could conquer
[1:39:34] the sickness and Fae
[1:39:36] is the victory that overcomes every
[1:39:39] curse of the devil
[1:39:41] I like that faith is the victory say
[1:39:45] faith in what not faith in your church
[1:39:47] not faith in your Creed not faith in
[1:39:49] some man but faith in Jesus Christ who
[1:39:52] made the promise that's the victory what
[1:39:55] is it
[1:39:55] it is the victory say my arm is typical
[1:39:59] but faith is the victory
[1:40:01] I still feel sick but faith is the
[1:40:04] victory oh it overcomes the world when
[1:40:07] you climb into God by prayer until you
[1:40:11] see nothing
[1:40:12] conquer to you hallelujah there is
[1:40:16] nothing can hurt you thin come on
[1:40:19] somebody say you've overcome you got 50
[1:40:23] miles of elbow room you're selling free
[1:40:25] them now not when you actually get the
[1:40:28] healing not when you get the deliverance
[1:40:32] amen but when you catch it by faith in
[1:40:35] prayer it's yours right then come on
[1:40:39] somebody you remember how to prophet
[1:40:42] told us amen it's like having a man
[1:40:45] needing a loaf of bread right and when
[1:40:48] you got faith and you need a loaf of
[1:40:50] bread
[1:40:50] you bring Brandon asking God to send you
[1:40:52] that loaf of bread you know and on and
[1:40:54] as you out you don't have the money or
[1:40:57] anything like that to get the bread but
[1:40:59] somebody comes along and gives you the
[1:41:01] money back then it was just a quarter
[1:41:03] amen but somebody come along and give
[1:41:06] you that quarter
[1:41:07] Amen for the loaf of bread he say you
[1:41:09] can begin rejoicing you can begin
[1:41:13] celebrating you can begin worshiping
[1:41:15] even though you don't have bread but
[1:41:19] with the quarter you know you have
[1:41:22] purchasing power come o somebody and if
[1:41:26] all you got is a quarter you want to
[1:41:29] give God praise for your quarter
[1:41:34] because with that quarter they can't
[1:41:37] stop you from getting what belongs to
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:40] hallelujah you just got a quarter worth
[1:41:42] of faith you ought to start worshiping
[1:41:44] with that quota hallelujah amen he goes
[1:41:49] on to say something here he says you
[1:41:52] overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room
[1:41:54] you're selling free them you've been a
[1:41:57] drunken and a slave to whiskey you be
[1:42:00] the master over him then that old devil
[1:42:03] out of alcohol that means you drink he's
[1:42:07] your master now but when you get faith I
[1:42:09] don't mean make-believe real faith
[1:42:12] he's your servant Vance he meant you who
[1:42:17] can't lay down tobacco Amen you women
[1:42:20] and men when it comes to a place where
[1:42:22] you can't you where you can get to that
[1:42:24] spot to where you have overcome it by
[1:42:26] faith you'll master it then hallelujah
[1:42:30] and he goes to talk about a little
[1:42:32] sister a man that 11 yeah let me just
[1:42:34] read this cuz I think this is this will
[1:42:36] help somebody it says a little woman
[1:42:38] that's sitting president now she has
[1:42:40] been at this altar time after time after
[1:42:43] time he says a good woman but she
[1:42:47] started smoking a long time ago and she
[1:42:50] just couldn't overcome it and she come
[1:42:52] up and I went pray with her and it
[1:42:54] seemed like she just couldn't overcome
[1:42:56] it and the first thing you know our tour
[1:42:58] I said there'll be danger down the road
[1:43:00] said she said well brother branham I've
[1:43:03] cried I've begged you see just emotional
[1:43:07] now now I want to make sure that we get
[1:43:09] this the Holy Spirit I feel checked just
[1:43:11] to kind of save some things here because
[1:43:13] we've seen people kind of go in and out
[1:43:15] up and down and they just not really
[1:43:18] overcome in anything right you know it
[1:43:20] looked good to come to church but after
[1:43:23] you leave Church you're going through
[1:43:24] struggles hallelujah and man after you
[1:43:28] leave Church you've fallen right back
[1:43:29] into the same things God delivered you
[1:43:31] from on Sunday right and every time you
[1:43:33] do that you make your condition worse
[1:43:35] and the way to tell this lady say now
[1:43:38] it's gone if there's trouble waiting for
[1:43:40] you down the road if you don't settle
[1:43:42] that thing there is trouble waiting for
[1:43:44] you down the road
[1:43:45] look at this he says he says there'll be
[1:43:49] danger down the road she said well
[1:43:50] brother Brandon I've cried I beg you see
[1:43:53] just emotional fighting the air that
[1:43:56] won't do any good and I get down and
[1:43:59] pray with her and lay hands on her and
[1:44:01] she go back and in a few days I meet
[1:44:05] again just knocked you down with
[1:44:07] cigarette smoke hands still brown I like
[1:44:13] the way he's putting this because we all
[1:44:15] we all see the same thing he said one
[1:44:17] night down yonder she went to a doctor
[1:44:19] began to get sick and widowed him - just
[1:44:22] a little smiley thing and the doctor
[1:44:24] looked into her and he said cancer
[1:44:27] smoking cigarettes there she was laying
[1:44:29] there to die then she got down to
[1:44:32] business
[1:44:33] hallelujah see a drowning man will reach
[1:44:37] for straw as long as you can a man oh my
[1:44:41] god a drowning man will reach for straw
[1:44:44] now you know a strong can save you but
[1:44:47] because you see the strong floating you
[1:44:49] think if that's floating then maybe I
[1:44:51] can float with the strong but as soon as
[1:44:53] you touch the straw you do you bring the
[1:44:55] straw down but a drowning man will reach
[1:44:58] for strong look at this now he says long
[1:45:01] as you can walk out of this church
[1:45:03] tonight or should I say today and know
[1:45:05] that you can go join the Methodists or
[1:45:07] Baptists as long as you can sit in here
[1:45:09] say now I'm a good person there's
[1:45:11] nothing wrong with me
[1:45:12] yeah you can't do anything well you
[1:45:15] can't do anything with you I like that
[1:45:17] right as long as you got that type of
[1:45:19] attitude God can't do nothing with you
[1:45:21] he say but when you see your sins as God
[1:45:25] sees them in the light of his Bible when
[1:45:28] you see your repent or perish something
[1:45:31] will take place you'll get down to
[1:45:34] business
[1:45:34] walk out of here and since in smothering
[1:45:37] around your heart the doctor back there
[1:45:39] the world maybe or maybe raise raise
[1:45:42] raise up come up and look and say it's a
[1:45:44] heart attack you'll get to business
[1:45:46] that's when she had to get to business
[1:45:48] and the woman said hey look in here
[1:45:50] looking at me now and I like the way
[1:45:52] just you know brother branham brings
[1:45:53] that about this particular sisters in
[1:45:55] the congregation cuz we got a lot of
[1:45:56] folk they'll go up and down but when you
[1:45:59] leave
[1:45:59] here after you receive the word in your
[1:46:01] heart and you've made a confession you
[1:46:03] got to walk out and live a victorious
[1:46:04] life a man you can't you can't go back
[1:46:07] to the things God delivered you from you
[1:46:09] make your condition worse if God deliver
[1:46:11] you from smoking don't go back to
[1:46:13] smoking if God deliver you from drinking
[1:46:15] don't go back to drinking if God deliver
[1:46:17] you from a relationship that's hindering
[1:46:19] you huh don't you go back to that
[1:46:22] relationship
[1:46:24] hallelujah somebody Amen I want God to
[1:46:27] live you stay delivered and sometimes in
[1:46:31] order to stay delivered you got to
[1:46:32] change your surroundings the people that
[1:46:34] you yourself hang with you can't hang
[1:46:36] with no more the places that you used to
[1:46:38] go you can't go to no more
[1:46:40] hallelujah somebody Amen that's how you
[1:46:43] maintain victory all right all right now
[1:46:47] there's some things you guys to do
[1:46:49] because the Bible say lay aside every
[1:46:51] sin in every week that's always a
[1:46:52] possession you can't pray and X got to
[1:46:54] take it from you you actually have to
[1:46:56] lay it aside
[1:46:56] all right glory to God I just want to a
[1:46:59] man just kind of encourage your heart
[1:47:01] here a little bit but you know as we're
[1:47:03] approaching a man Christmas glory to God
[1:47:06] we're approaching Christmas and I'm
[1:47:09] looking at this say man from a different
[1:47:11] angle today says you know I'm thinking
[1:47:14] many people preparing for holiday
[1:47:15] parties a man some of y'all might even
[1:47:19] have some that y'all got to go to
[1:47:21] hallelujah a man they're preparing for
[1:47:25] holiday parties what they might call
[1:47:27] Christmas socials a man and notice the
[1:47:32] word Christmas socials amen the name
[1:47:36] Christ is actually in Christmas amen now
[1:47:41] we realized that it's really not about
[1:47:43] him anymore we know we know that they've
[1:47:45] taken Christ completely out of Christmas
[1:47:46] some places they got Xmas they've taken
[1:47:49] the Christ part out amen but we realized
[1:47:52] that it never really was about him we
[1:47:54] understand that by revelation a man it
[1:47:56] was it was a pagan tradition that was
[1:47:58] introduced but like brother Brown say
[1:48:00] it's here to stay
[1:48:01] amen and we're not gonna get rid of
[1:48:03] Christmas glory to God hallelujah
[1:48:06] somebody a man ain't no sense and fight
[1:48:09] that you ain't getting rid of it
[1:48:12] glory to God
[1:48:14] I've seen many families destroyed
[1:48:16] because we got this revelation rights
[1:48:18] come on somebody a man we don't we don't
[1:48:21] took some stands that we probably didn't
[1:48:23] need to take brother brand was ours he
[1:48:25] was an example to us in many ways
[1:48:27] glory to God somebody and I know people
[1:48:30] don't want to preach all the message
[1:48:31] they only want the parts that fit they
[1:48:34] doctrine hallelujah I am a stay out of
[1:48:38] that but there's a balance even in
[1:48:42] Christmas and you can find the balance
[1:48:45] in Christmas but but what I want you to
[1:48:47] understand is that it should be about
[1:48:50] Christ right it should be because
[1:48:53] because when we think about Christmas
[1:48:55] Christ is actually in that all right
[1:48:58] he's saying that now what I'm thinking
[1:49:00] about many a prepared for the holiday
[1:49:01] parties prepared for the Christmas
[1:49:04] socials prepared for the gift sharing
[1:49:07] hallelujah someone can't wait they know
[1:49:09] we get out of this night early telling
[1:49:11] people what we want it ain't even your
[1:49:14] birthday glory to god I'm gonna leave it
[1:49:16] alone I'm believing alone it ain't
[1:49:18] here's either
[1:49:19] ain't nobody ain't nothing well
[1:49:23] hallelujah why we got the go through all
[1:49:26] this and I can see if it's your birthday
[1:49:29] but it ain't even your birthday and you
[1:49:32] got a list telling people what you want
[1:49:33] all right now I must stay I'm gonna stay
[1:49:35] away from it y'all y'all said brother
[1:49:38] Jack get out get out and now some of
[1:49:39] y'all saying stay right there brother
[1:49:41] Jack you save me some money
[1:49:45] glory a man say but they think they give
[1:49:48] Sharon and the other thing that
[1:49:50] surrounds this is to drunkenness amen
[1:49:53] the other thing is the drug use
[1:49:55] right Eman many other sinful activities
[1:49:59] that that are supposed to be that
[1:50:00] celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:02] a man that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:50:04] God
[1:50:05] somebody need a deliverance amen at
[1:50:08] Christmas rather than a mint getting
[1:50:09] involved and stuff like that most will
[1:50:12] fail to stop and think what is this
[1:50:15] season really all about what is it all
[1:50:18] about a man that the pagan original Pig
[1:50:22] in origin
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:24] but I like the fact the one thing that I
[1:50:26] like is that this is an opportunity for
[1:50:28] us everybody amen to all over the world
[1:50:32] to reflect and think about the real
[1:50:34] reason for this season
[1:50:37] everybody have stopped to stop and think
[1:50:39] about it's all about the birth of our
[1:50:41] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let's pick
[1:50:44] up a scripture here Matthew 1 amen verse
[1:50:46] 18 Matthew 1 and verse 18 this is about
[1:50:50] the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:50:52] Christ
[1:50:53] stay with me here just for a few minutes
[1:50:55] I'll go as far as I can and then maybe
[1:50:58] I'll pick up some more on next week a
[1:51:00] man hallelujah
[1:51:02] Matthew 1 look at verse 18 says now the
[1:51:04] birth of G of Jesus Christ was on this
[1:51:08] wise when as his mother Mary was
[1:51:10] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:51:13] together she was found with child of the
[1:51:16] Holy Ghost hallelujah amen then Joseph
[1:51:21] her husband being a just man and not
[1:51:24] willing to make her a public example was
[1:51:27] minded to put her away privately can I
[1:51:30] just inject something now I was trying
[1:51:31] to save it to next week but I don't know
[1:51:33] if I'm gonna get a chance you know when
[1:51:36] Adam came to his wife before he could
[1:51:39] actually get to know her she was already
[1:51:43] pregnant amen hallelujah and Adams wife
[1:51:47] was pregnant with death come on somebody
[1:51:51] because the day you eat thereof is the
[1:51:54] day that you die
[1:51:55] so before Adam could actually get to
[1:51:58] know his wife she had already been
[1:52:01] pregnant with death but before Joseph
[1:52:04] could get to know his wife she was
[1:52:07] already pregnant with life hallelujah
[1:52:12] somebody glory to God hallelujah a man a
[1:52:17] man a man let me just go and I'm gonna
[1:52:20] try to stay away from that I want to
[1:52:22] talk about them to wolves ain't ma'am
[1:52:24] but not today not today
[1:52:26] Amen nothing shall be impossible as our
[1:52:29] subject today says then Joseph her
[1:52:31] husband being a just man and not willing
[1:52:33] to make her a public example was minded
[1:52:35] to put away privately but watch this but
[1:52:37] while he
[1:52:38] Oh on these things behold the age of the
[1:52:42] Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[1:52:44] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:52:46] take unto thee Mary thy wife but that
[1:52:49] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:52:53] Ghost now you know Joseph having this
[1:52:55] experience in a dream with an angel
[1:52:58] actually coming to him and saying these
[1:52:59] things that was still something that was
[1:53:01] very difficult for him to accept because
[1:53:04] you know here he has to take this woman
[1:53:06] that's already been pregnant
[1:53:08] by-and-by and her testimony is that our
[1:53:11] angel told me this now you got imagine
[1:53:14] walking around the city with a woman as
[1:53:17] telling this testimony and I angel said
[1:53:19] this this is very difficult for Joseph
[1:53:21] to kind of stand by her side this is my
[1:53:23] children's thinking I need to put her
[1:53:25] away but but you know the thing I think
[1:53:27] that settles not just that the angel
[1:53:29] came and said that which is conceived in
[1:53:32] her is of the Holy Ghost the angel says
[1:53:34] something else in the next verse and
[1:53:36] this is what I feel like when God speaks
[1:53:38] to you his word that should settled you
[1:53:41] a man when you get a revelation from the
[1:53:43] word come on somebody when God speak out
[1:53:48] of his word that should give you give
[1:53:50] you a peace that passeth all
[1:53:52] understanding look at the next thing
[1:53:54] that he tells Joseph not my verse 20
[1:53:56] says but while he thought on these
[1:53:58] things behold the age of the Lord
[1:53:59] appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[1:54:01] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:54:03] take any mayor that wife but that which
[1:54:05] is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:07] and she shall bring forth the son and
[1:54:10] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[1:54:13] shall save his people from their sins
[1:54:15] now all this was some that it might be
[1:54:17] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:54:20] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[1:54:22] shall be with child and shall bring
[1:54:25] forth a son and they shall call his name
[1:54:27] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[1:54:30] with us now in that part right there
[1:54:32] here that was actually referring back to
[1:54:34] a scripture in the Old Testament amen
[1:54:37] and I believe if Joseph was shown
[1:54:39] scripture from the Old Testament then he
[1:54:41] can identify himself with Mary and not
[1:54:44] amen be impacted by whatever everybody
[1:54:47] else had to say the man knew that he was
[1:54:49] standing on the word
[1:54:50] and when you know when your faith has
[1:54:53] been anchored on the word I don't care
[1:54:55] who come against you I don't care if the
[1:54:59] doctor come against you I don't care if
[1:55:02] your powers come against you whoever
[1:55:04] come against you will fall at your feet
[1:55:06] because you standing up something that
[1:55:09] cannot fail hallelujah glory to God
[1:55:14] listen then Joseph being raised from
[1:55:18] sleep did as the age of the Lord had
[1:55:21] bidden him and took unto him his wife
[1:55:24] and knew her not to she had brought
[1:55:26] forth her firstborn son and he called
[1:55:28] his name Jesus now you know when we talk
[1:55:32] about this season Jesus was the reason
[1:55:35] for the season amen if people are gonna
[1:55:38] do all these celebrations and all these
[1:55:39] other things make sure they include the
[1:55:41] Lord Jesus Jesus meant yahweh is
[1:55:45] salvation' his name meant yahweh is
[1:55:47] salvation' and I was just kind of you
[1:55:50] know just thinking on this because you
[1:55:52] know when I just reflect on the
[1:55:54] scripture in Luke nothing shall be
[1:55:56] impossible a man I just I just just
[1:55:58] began to really reflect on this and you
[1:56:00] know just thinking through this season
[1:56:02] and everything say to the birth of our
[1:56:04] Lord should actually settle all doubts
[1:56:06] as to whether God can do what he
[1:56:08] promised you I want to say that again
[1:56:11] the birth of our Lord should actually
[1:56:14] settle all doubts as to whether God can
[1:56:18] do what he promised you
[1:56:20] amen glory to God I want you to
[1:56:23] understand you know the scriptures say
[1:56:24] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:56:26] the birth of our Savior the birth of our
[1:56:29] Redeemer our Lord and our King was an
[1:56:31] example of nothing shall be impossible
[1:56:34] Oh glory to God a man hallelujah it was
[1:56:40] his very birth was an example of nothing
[1:56:45] shall be impossible and man his birth
[1:56:47] was a miracle because a virgin actually
[1:56:51] conceived
[1:56:54] his birth was a miracle right I was
[1:56:59] thinking to myself we ought to just call
[1:57:01] timeout whatever you got going on just
[1:57:04] call timeout and think about this his
[1:57:06] very birth was a miracle a virgin
[1:57:10] actually conceived look at it a man not
[1:57:15] only was his birth a miracle
[1:57:17] glory to God but but but even his death
[1:57:20] on the cross was a miracle because after
[1:57:24] he was buried he did not remain in the
[1:57:27] grief amen it tells us that he borrowed
[1:57:30] a tomb and what the word bara means is
[1:57:33] to take or obtain with the promise to
[1:57:37] return the same or equivalent I'm only
[1:57:41] borrowing this because i'ma give it
[1:57:42] right back
[1:57:45] hallelujah and he bought the tomb
[1:57:47] because he wouldn't need it for long
[1:57:49] glory to God He is risen and the reason
[1:57:53] we know that is because he's doing the
[1:57:55] same things he did while he was here on
[1:57:58] the earth his birth was a miracle
[1:58:01] his death was a miracle and his life was
[1:58:05] full of miracles you know remember that
[1:58:08] the Bible says that his name was going
[1:58:10] to be called Jesus and I preached a
[1:58:12] sermon some years ago about Jesus Saves
[1:58:14] because Jesus the name Jesus means
[1:58:16] yahweh is salvation' now I was just
[1:58:19] thinking about you know just some of the
[1:58:20] things that went just the first miracle
[1:58:22] when you turn the water into wine a man
[1:58:25] that was there was a miracle yahweh is
[1:58:27] salvation' Jesus Saves and as I thought
[1:58:30] about him turning the water into wine I
[1:58:32] thought when your supply is running dry
[1:58:35] Jesus Saves
[1:58:40] when your supply is running dry Jesus
[1:58:44] Saves a man I thought about when he fed
[1:58:47] the 5000 as well as the 4000 again when
[1:58:50] your supply is running dry Jesus Saves
[1:58:53] all right when he walked on water when
[1:58:56] he calmed the water I thought about when
[1:58:58] death is staring you right in the face
[1:59:01] because that's why the disciples when
[1:59:03] they got on the boat and they begin to
[1:59:04] go across to the other side and they saw
[1:59:06] the stormy seas amen they won't even
[1:59:09] stop to say carest thou not that we
[1:59:11] perish think in the face of death out
[1:59:14] there in the stormy sea but when they
[1:59:16] woke Jesus up and when expect them to go
[1:59:19] to the tip of the boat put his foot on
[1:59:21] the tip of the bump saying peace peace
[1:59:22] deal it showed that Yahweh what
[1:59:26] salvation Jesus Ange listen when the man
[1:59:31] at the Pool of Bethesda and the woman
[1:59:34] with the issue of blood see when the
[1:59:36] doctors have said they can do all they
[1:59:38] can do and there's nothing more they can
[1:59:40] do for you I want you to remember Jesus
[1:59:44] still saves all glory to God that woman
[1:59:48] could go to another doctor she had run
[1:59:50] out of money but when Jesus passed
[1:59:52] through the town she said if I could
[1:59:53] just touch the hem of His garment I know
[1:59:56] I'll be made whole when that lady
[1:59:58] touched His garment she received
[2:00:00] Yahweh's salvation let me go a little
[2:00:04] further when blind bartimaeus had his
[2:00:07] opportunity amen in the presence of the
[2:00:09] Lord Jesus it was it was the last chance
[2:00:12] that he had Jesus was passing that way
[2:00:14] he would never come that way anymore
[2:00:16] physically on the earth he would never
[2:00:18] pass that way any more blind Bartimaeus
[2:00:20] beginning to cry out and I'm gonna taste
[2:00:22] some when you get desperate you'll get
[2:00:23] down to business
[2:00:24] a man like bombard my romance got down
[2:00:27] to business he began to cry out it was
[2:00:29] his last opportunity call on Jesus and
[2:00:31] when he called on Jesus hallelujah he
[2:00:35] found out that Yahweh was salvation he
[2:00:37] was saved from his blinded condition
[2:00:40] Jesus Saves
[2:00:42] hallelujah Legion was delivered I like
[2:00:46] this glory to God because when this man
[2:00:49] was you know I thought about him he was
[2:00:51] healed he lost
[2:00:53] right nine he'd been ostracized from
[2:00:55] society a man and this is something when
[2:00:59] you mail start coming to the graveyard
[2:01:05] when the mailman got to deliver your
[2:01:07] mail to the graveyard you know you in a
[2:01:09] bad condition but it's okay when you get
[2:01:12] in that condition Jesus still saves no
[2:01:17] matter what you no matter where your
[2:01:18] life is that Jesus can save you right
[2:01:21] there Yahweh is salvation
[2:01:27] [Applause]
[2:01:28] Winnie raised the day Lazarus in the sin
[2:01:31] and the widow's son a man from name I
[2:01:35] wonder I just want to let you know
[2:01:36] tonight I mean today that nothing is
[2:01:38] impossible Jesus still says even if you
[2:01:41] facing death he can raise them up from
[2:01:43] the dead
[2:01:44] Oh glory to God Jesus still saves now I
[2:01:49] set this my God because I wanted you to
[2:01:52] just kind of look at this on today with
[2:01:54] me as week this descriptor and Luke 1
[2:01:57] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[2:01:59] I don't know what you're facing I don't
[2:02:02] know what you're facing I don't know
[2:02:03] amen how difficult your situation might
[2:02:06] be but when you get the context of the
[2:02:08] scripture glory to God with God nothing
[2:02:12] shall be impossible
[2:02:13] nothing nothing nothing shall be
[2:02:16] impossible I mean this the context of
[2:02:19] the scripture the way those words I just
[2:02:21] read you one verse right that's all I
[2:02:23] did was reaching one verse but if you
[2:02:25] were to go back a man that the
[2:02:27] straightest story is is that Mary before
[2:02:31] before Mary situation a man there was an
[2:02:35] angel that visited Zachariah in the
[2:02:38] temple and told him that his wife was
[2:02:41] going to have a baby
[2:02:42] hallelujah and that Zacharias in the
[2:02:44] temple he began to kind of doubt about
[2:02:46] his wife being able to have this baby
[2:02:48] but the problem is is that Zachariah
[2:02:50] doubt it and he had other examples in
[2:02:54] scripture that he get referred back to
[2:02:56] they say if God did it for them then I
[2:02:59] know God can do it for me and I want to
[2:03:02] tell you some whatever you go through if
[2:03:03] you have an exemple
[2:03:05] said before you that God done did it for
[2:03:08] somebody else then you know the same God
[2:03:11] has no respect of persons and he'll do
[2:03:14] the same thing for you nothing is
[2:03:17] impossible Oh glory to God and I like
[2:03:22] the way this time eclipsed I mean
[2:03:24] whatever you can think of right now I
[2:03:26] want to tell you it's not impossible I'm
[2:03:30] going through this brother Jack not
[2:03:31] impossible brother Jack you you ain't
[2:03:33] hurt by this not impossible I don't care
[2:03:36] what it is it's not impossible that's
[2:03:40] why the angel said nothing and he did
[2:03:42] not mix his words nothing shall be
[2:03:45] impossible
[2:03:49] Zechariah a man he can look back in
[2:03:52] scriptures see now now now Abraham the
[2:03:56] father faith it happened with him a man
[2:03:58] I remember Hannah at the temple she was
[2:04:00] barren and she had a child I mean he had
[2:04:02] people that he can refer back to but yet
[2:04:05] he chose to disbelieve i'ma tell you
[2:04:07] something it's dangerous very dangerous
[2:04:11] to disbelieve God Zachariah when he
[2:04:15] disbelieve God see I'm gonna tell you
[2:04:16] stop talking that down start giving God
[2:04:20] but but but but God don't want to hear
[2:04:23] but but but but but the doctor said but
[2:04:26] this one says but but God don't want to
[2:04:29] hear none of that hallelujah God just
[2:04:35] want to hear me man
[2:04:36] God you said it I believe it and I
[2:04:39] accept it that's all God want to hear
[2:04:42] glory to God but as Zechariah a man was
[2:04:46] was down and he said now look you're
[2:04:48] gonna go home you're gonna have a son
[2:04:50] Amen your wife come bearing our old age
[2:04:52] and what's gonna be said not because you
[2:04:54] doubt it you not gonna be able to talk
[2:04:56] you're not gonna be so you just have to
[2:04:58] scribble things down to tell them what
[2:04:59] you know what uh what he wanted what he
[2:05:01] wanted them to know but as he's there
[2:05:04] you know going through this trial here
[2:05:06] uh Elizabeth is pregnant and uh you know
[2:05:10] we pick up something here in verse Luke
[2:05:13] 1 verse 26 we pick up some because she's
[2:05:15] five months pregnant by this time
[2:05:18] and here loop 1 verse 26 it says and in
[2:05:21] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[2:05:23] sent from God on to a city of Galilee
[2:05:26] named Nazareth Oh mom - a virgin a
[2:05:30] spouse she was engaged to a man whose
[2:05:33] name was Joseph of the house of David
[2:05:36] and the Virgin's name was was married
[2:05:39] now you know I want to just kind of
[2:05:42] inject a few things here glory to God oh
[2:05:45] my god
[2:05:47] now now Mary was a true seed of Abraham
[2:05:51] not just from they not from the
[2:05:54] spiritual sense but naturally she was a
[2:05:57] true seed of Abraham if you go back over
[2:05:59] to Matthew 1 you start tracing the
[2:06:01] genealogies you'll see that Joseph was a
[2:06:04] part of the genealogy amen coming down
[2:06:07] from Abraham Oh glory to God and back in
[2:06:10] those days I'm gonna just have to put it
[2:06:12] this way back in those days a woman
[2:06:15] could not marry outside of a tribe Oh
[2:06:18] y'all let me preach y'all let me preach
[2:06:22] amen a woman could not marry outside of
[2:06:25] a tribe now I had something here that I
[2:06:28] want to just kind of read on that so
[2:06:29] y'all just y'all just bear with me okay
[2:06:32] yeah all right so and understand
[2:06:34] something because you know we can't
[2:06:36] apply just carnal thinking to this back
[2:06:39] in that they kept it pure back then and
[2:06:42] God still wants us to keep it pure today
[2:06:44] they could not marry outside the tribe
[2:06:46] so that made Mary a physical immense
[2:06:51] seed of Abraham physically not just
[2:06:54] spiritually but physically she was a
[2:06:57] seed of Abraham now if you're part of a
[2:06:59] tribe that means that you was a the word
[2:07:01] tribe means an aggregate of people
[2:07:03] united by ties of descent from a common
[2:07:07] ancestor amen if you're a part of a
[2:07:10] tribe amen it's an aggregate aggregate
[2:07:13] of people united by ties of descent from
[2:07:17] a common ancestor amen a community of
[2:07:20] customs and traditions glory to God so
[2:07:23] back then they had to stay within their
[2:07:25] tribes when they got married
[2:07:27] read between the lines they had this
[2:07:29] thing
[2:07:30] within their tribes when they got mad at
[2:07:32] the birth of Jesus it was still that way
[2:07:36] all right now glory to God they had to
[2:07:40] stay within their tribes that's the way
[2:07:41] that God gave them that Lord ain't all
[2:07:43] about it by that long hallelujah it kept
[2:07:47] a lot of problems down praise the Lord
[2:07:50] Church a man is the truth in it how
[2:07:51] right so so you know I want to show that
[2:07:54] Mary was a physical physical seed of
[2:07:58] Abraham now that some things that Mary
[2:08:00] did being that she's a physical seed
[2:08:03] there are certain qualities that kind of
[2:08:05] go along with Mayer's testimony let's
[2:08:08] just read it here in the scripture glory
[2:08:10] to God a man can't camp before I go
[2:08:15] forward amen and I think I'm at verse 28
[2:08:17] let me just give you because Abraham had
[2:08:19] seven qualities the first ones he called
[2:08:21] things that be not as though they were
[2:08:22] in other words that when he was against
[2:08:25] hope he still believed in hope all right
[2:08:27] and another one when he was weak in
[2:08:30] faith he considered not his own body
[2:08:32] which was now dead and when he was about
[2:08:35] a hundred years old he considered not
[2:08:36] his condition another thing he didn't
[2:08:39] even consider the dentists of his wife's
[2:08:41] room whew Sarah's womb he staggered not
[2:08:44] at the promise of God through unbelief
[2:08:46] the sixth thing Abraham was strong in
[2:08:50] faith and while he was strong in faith
[2:08:51] he was giving glory to God and the
[2:08:54] seventh day being fully persuaded that
[2:08:55] what he had promised he was able to
[2:08:58] before I'm gonna tell you where you had
[2:09:00] in your journey glory to God some of
[2:09:02] y'all are you against hope you still
[2:09:04] believe in hope and man you even though
[2:09:07] you're weakened you weren't you're not
[2:09:09] weakened faith you're not considering
[2:09:10] the circumstances a man not only your
[2:09:13] circumstances but those around you're
[2:09:14] not considering their circumstances but
[2:09:16] where you're lacking a man also say he's
[2:09:18] thinking not the promise of God through
[2:09:20] unbelief but where you're lacking is
[2:09:22] being stronger faith in giving glory to
[2:09:23] God what we need to learn how to do is
[2:09:26] give God praise before it happens
[2:09:28] glory to God you gotta praise God on
[2:09:31] what you see because as you start
[2:09:33] praising him on what you see you're
[2:09:35] gonna bring what you see into reality Oh
[2:09:38] y'all ain't with me today glory to God
[2:09:44] somebody she was a physical seed of
[2:09:47] Abraham and she applied these same hate
[2:09:50] these same characteristics to her trial
[2:09:52] watch this verse 26 28 I'm sorry and the
[2:09:56] angel came came in unto her and said
[2:09:59] hail and and and what that word hail
[2:10:02] mean is rejoiced right hail thou are
[2:10:05] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[2:10:08] blessed are thou among women I see
[2:10:12] wonder what in the world is going on
[2:10:13] here amen and when she saw him she was
[2:10:17] troubled at his sing and cast in her
[2:10:20] mind what man of salutation this should
[2:10:23] be oh my and the angel said unto her
[2:10:27] fear not now coz when you ever come into
[2:10:29] the presence of an angel like this you
[2:10:31] trembling for your life right but but
[2:10:34] when he speaks those words fear not it
[2:10:36] settles you glory to God I wish that no
[2:10:39] matter a man and whatever you're facing
[2:10:41] a man today that you can just hear the
[2:10:43] angels speak fear not because nothing is
[2:10:46] impossible look at this
[2:10:48] fear not o glory amen
[2:10:52] vs. verse 30 says an angel senator fear
[2:10:55] not Mary for thou has found favor with
[2:10:56] God and the whole thou shalt conceive in
[2:11:00] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[2:11:04] call his name Jesus now I want you to
[2:11:07] get this when we really think about what
[2:11:08] happened the world is celebrating and I
[2:11:11] won't tell those of you that don't know
[2:11:13] Jesus was not born on December 25th
[2:11:15] it wasn't that's a pagan thing that came
[2:11:18] when the the you know the pagans got
[2:11:20] introduced to Christianity the pagans
[2:11:22] used to celebrate the Sun God's birthday
[2:11:25] and when Christianity got mixed with
[2:11:27] paganism the Christians took a stand now
[2:11:29] we not worshipping the Sun God so the
[2:11:32] pagans compromised and when you
[2:11:33] compromise you compensate the devil
[2:11:39] sososo the christian said we're not
[2:11:41] worshipping the Sun guy so the pagans
[2:11:43] say well okay we won't worship the Sun
[2:11:45] God but we still want to do this
[2:11:46] festival around December 21st 22nd 23rd
[2:11:50] 24th would we want to do it somewhere

[2:14:34] name Jesus now I want job this is a
[2:14:36] timeout moment because this is what
[2:14:38] Christmas is all about it took a miracle
[2:14:42] to get Jesus here this one's just some
[2:14:47] ordinary birth it took a miracle to get
[2:14:52] him here it was the fulfillment of
[2:14:56] Scripture and I can't go through all the
[2:14:58] scripture you know that today but but it
[2:15:00] was a fulfillment of promises that God
[2:15:02] had made
[2:15:03] amen throughout the ages in and here was
[2:15:06] that the time of the manifestation and
[2:15:08] and and as we look at this he say and
[2:15:12] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[2:15:13] and bring forth the son and shall call
[2:15:15] his name Jesus and he shall be great and
[2:15:19] shall be called the son of the highest
[2:15:21] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[2:15:24] throne is of his father David and he
[2:15:27] shall reign over the house of Jacob
[2:15:29] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[2:15:32] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[2:15:38] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[2:15:42] man
[2:15:43] now she's got questions I see chicken
[2:15:46] chicken I mean she could she could hold
[2:15:48] a testimony Oh glory to God before the
[2:15:51] agents say I'm a virgin I kept myself
[2:15:56] until I got married amen now I'm engaged
[2:16:00] to be married I'm gonna I'm gonna
[2:16:03] concede my heart this thing gonna be now
[2:16:07] look at it look at it he says verse 25
[2:16:11] and the angel answered ascended her the
[2:16:13] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[2:16:17] power of the highest shall overshadow
[2:16:19] thee therefore also that holy thing
[2:16:24] which shall be born of thee shall be
[2:16:26] called the son of God now she wonder how
[2:16:30] this gonna happen but the angel has an
[2:16:31] answer don't worry the Holy Ghost gonna
[2:16:34] take care it is you wonder how you gonna
[2:16:36] overcome the Holy Ghost gonna take care
[2:16:39] is you wonder how you're gonna get to
[2:16:41] the next the Holy Ghost gonna get you
[2:16:43] there Oh glory to God listen and I love
[2:16:47] this verse 36 and behold thy cousin
[2:16:50] Elizabeth look at this church she has
[2:16:55] also conceived a son in her old age and
[2:16:58] the angel put emphasis on certain pieces
[2:17:01] here
[2:17:01] she's conceived a son in her oh it's
[2:17:04] because Mary know that Elizabeth ain't
[2:17:05] never had no child and Mary knows how
[2:17:08] impossible this would be for for
[2:17:10] Elizabeth to have a child but the angel
[2:17:13] amen in
[2:17:14] this-this-this Salutation er begins to
[2:17:17] build her faith the reason he shares
[2:17:20] Elizabeth testimony Elizabeth was in
[2:17:23] hiding he let nobody even knew what was
[2:17:26] going on he lives but they angel reveal
[2:17:28] what had happened to Elizabeth to marry
[2:17:29] in order to build Mary's faith oh my god
[2:17:34] watch this he's building there's faith
[2:17:37] now now Elizabeth Street and behold I
[2:17:40] come see Lizbeth

[2:17:43] age and this is the sixth month with her
[2:17:46] who was called barren oh my god I like
[2:17:51] this because now when the angel is there
[2:17:55] talking with Merrin just trying to get
[2:17:57] her to see because I need you to
[2:17:59] understand something there was no way
[2:18:02] that Jesus would have been able to come
[2:18:06] to the earth had Mary not received the
[2:18:10] promise in her first womb which was the
[2:18:14] womb of a spirit when she accepted the
[2:18:18] word that brought forth the
[2:18:21] manifestation and I'ma taste something
[2:18:23] you are never going to get anywhere with
[2:18:25] God and till you receive his were in
[2:18:28] your first wound that's the womb of your
[2:18:30] spirit when you when you receive it
[2:18:33] there then you'll bring forth the
[2:18:34] manifestation of what God has in his
[2:18:37] promise worked you still battling a man
[2:18:40] with what he promised you you got a stop
[2:18:43] better than that and start accepting it
[2:18:45] if God said it that settles him well
[2:18:51] howdee stays gonna be say look you know
