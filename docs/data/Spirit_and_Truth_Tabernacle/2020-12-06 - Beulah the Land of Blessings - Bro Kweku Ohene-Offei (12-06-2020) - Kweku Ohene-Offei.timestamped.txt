[51:40] another day the lord has made for us to
[51:42] rejoice and give praise
[51:44] we are people of god we came from the
[51:48] mind of god
[51:49] we are walking in the mind of god and
[51:51] when we finish we go back to the mind of
[51:52] god
[51:53] so nothing can take us away from the man
[51:55] of christ and what is the man of christ
[51:57] eternity we are just eternal as eternal
[52:01] can be
[52:01] amen glory hallelujah last
[52:04] week or a week after we spoke on a
[52:07] little title the land
[52:08] of beulah and we want to progress from
[52:10] the same thought
[52:12] we want to just say part two want to
[52:13] just twist it a little bit
[52:15] uh to give us more breaking amen more
[52:18] understanding we're going to title it
[52:20] bill at the land of blessing
[52:23] the land of lesson and we want to read
[52:26] the same scripture that we read plus
[52:28] a couple other scriptures so we want to
[52:30] without much ado let's take our bibles
[52:34] and those listening we want to open to
[52:35] the book of isaiah chapter 62
[52:38] and we read from verses 1 to 5.
[52:41] isaiah 62 verse 1 to 5.
[52:46] and the prophet of god said that when
[52:48] you read every scripture
[52:50] and you don't see jesus christ go back
[52:53] and read it again
[52:54] and we read the scriptures and you don't
[52:56] see yourself in those promises of god
[52:58] go back and read it again so we are not
[53:01] talking about zion a mountain somewhere
[53:03] in israel we are talking about you the
[53:06] body of christ the wife of jesus christ
[53:09] amen so isaiah 62 1-5
[53:12] for zion's sick i will not hold my peace
[53:16] in other words for your sick the lord
[53:18] will not rest
[53:19] until he brings you to the land of
[53:22] promise the land of blessing beulah
[53:24] for zion's sake i will not hold my peace
[53:25] and for jerusalem sick i'll not rest
[53:28] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[53:30] as brightness
[53:32] and the salvation thereof has a lamp
[53:33] that burns
[53:36] and the gentiles shall see thy
[53:37] righteousness and all kings thy glory
[53:40] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[53:42] when the lord calls you
[53:44] he gives you a new name amen just like
[53:46] your father abraham
[53:47] the lord added a ham to his name the
[53:50] hand brings the blessing that is the
[53:51] beulah land
[53:53] and all the kings sorry this and and the
[53:55] lord
[53:57] shall call you by a new name which the
[53:59] mouth of the lord shall name
[54:01] when we are born our parents gives us
[54:02] name john david
[54:05] uh daniel and what have you but then the
[54:08] lord has a name for you
[54:10] that is the name of jesus christ that
[54:12] name may not be a physical name that is
[54:14] registered on your birth certificate
[54:16] but that name is inscribed and imprinted
[54:19] and embodied in in ink
[54:22] in your heart amen name is a deity
[54:26] name is a nature name is authority amen
[54:30] verse three thou shalt be thou shall be
[54:32] a crown of glory
[54:33] in the hand of the lord and eroya died
[54:35] them in the hand of
[54:36] god thou shalt no longer no more be
[54:39] termed forsaken
[54:40] neither shall thy land be tempt desolate
[54:43] but thou
[54:44] shall be called hefzeba and thy land
[54:47] beulah
[54:48] for the lord delight in thee and thy
[54:50] land shall be married
[54:52] for us a young man marries a virgin so
[54:54] shall thy sons
[54:55] marry thee as the bridegroom rejoice
[54:58] over the bride so shall thy god rejoice
[55:00] over thee
[55:01] amen god bless you shall we take our
[55:03] seed
[55:04] glory to the lord so we did break
[55:07] some of the terms here zion refers to
[55:10] the wife of christ
[55:11] the body of the lord on earth which the
[55:14] lord
[55:14] has redeemed peace of course pieces
[55:17] shalom the hebrew word
[55:19] hebrew word for peace is shalom peace of
[55:21] christ be unto you
[55:23] and then jerusalem is the jews
[55:27] plus the gentiles together the brethren
[55:29] of jesus christ
[55:31] and his wife together when a man redeems
[55:33] his family
[55:34] he redeems completely he redeems his
[55:36] family
[55:37] his wife his brothers and sisters mother
[55:40] father
[55:41] and then when he marries he redeemed a
[55:43] wife because
[55:44] they are one family amen so the lord had
[55:47] a portion
[55:49] of his family called the jews and a
[55:51] portion called the gentiles
[55:53] and they all the family of christ so the
[55:55] lord redeems the jews and the gentiles
[55:57] together and we want to break the word
[56:01] gentile gentile actually comes from the
[56:04] hebrew where the word
[56:05] from hebrew is or which means
[56:08] a nation
[56:09] a nation that needs to be redeemed so
[56:12] gentile is a nation
[56:14] that the lord is calling his people from
[56:16] we are nation we are not nation like
[56:18] united states
[56:19] we are not nation like you know another
[56:21] kingdom we are no nation like canada
[56:23] but we are a nation that descended from
[56:25] above
[56:26] we are from the new jerusalem that is
[56:29] our mother that descended from above
[56:31] amen now bella the templar means
[56:35] ownership means a master
[56:38] means lord married and claimed as a wife
[56:41] the heavenly zion so when the lord put a
[56:44] wedding ring which is the holy ghost
[56:46] in your heart you become a nation of the
[56:49] lord
[56:50] you've got a master the lord jesus
[56:51] christ himself who reigns in your life
[56:53] with love you are ownership you belong
[56:56] to someone you belong to me sir jesus
[56:57] christ
[56:58] you are married how did you marry by the
[57:01] holy ghost baptism
[57:03] that is the wedding ring the lord put in
[57:04] your heart that is put a new creation
[57:07] he destroyed the old creation of sin sin
[57:10] means
[57:10] satan in your nature god consumes that
[57:13] old creation
[57:14] and brings a new creation in your heart
[57:16] so that you become a new create a new
[57:18] creation
[57:18] amen now hefzeba means my delight
[57:22] is in her who is her zion
[57:25] beulah the land the lord has married to
[57:28] the wife of jesus christ
[57:30] so the light of the lord is in you amen
[57:34] when the lord created the lord brought
[57:36] three principal creation
[57:39] and we've experienced all the creation
[57:41] what the first creation was what we call
[57:42] the adamic creation
[57:44] that is from the garden of eden when the
[57:46] lord created uh the natural adam
[57:48] was initially a theophany a celestial
[57:50] body but then
[57:51] the lord wanted to manifest in earth he
[57:54] wanted to marry the land of beulah the
[57:55] earthly land
[57:57] so the theophany put on flesh
[58:00] by the spoken word adam put on the
[58:02] existing element the cosmic light
[58:03] potassium phosphorus sodium
[58:06] ion iodine and what have you all the 16
[58:09] elements put together
[58:10] magnesium and so forth and so on so adam
[58:13] became
[58:14] a flesh amen adam became the
[58:17] garden of eden everything was perfect
[58:19] now but the lord had more attributes
[58:22] than being a father than being a god of
[58:24] being worshiped
[58:25] he wanted to become a healer he wanted
[58:28] to become a redeemer
[58:29] he wanted to become a savior but then in
[58:32] the adamic creation
[58:33] there was nothing to redeem because
[58:35] everything was perfect
[58:37] there was no sickness there was no
[58:39] dryness there was no desolation
[58:41] there was no case so the lord has to
[58:44] bring a contrast
[58:45] by letting a lucifer bring in the
[58:47] contrast so the lord
[58:48] created a lucifer for that contrast if
[58:50] you read the book of isaiah
[58:52] 45 verse 1 to 5 7 there where he said
[58:56] i'm the lord isaiah 45 verse 5 he said i
[58:59] form light
[59:00] i create evil i the lord do all these
[59:03] things amen
[59:04] there's nothing that will happen to you
[59:06] that the lord doesn't know about
[59:08] that the lord didn't permit yes job went
[59:10] through trials
[59:12] very difficult trials but the lord
[59:14] permitted those trials
[59:16] so that you bring the job to his next
[59:18] revelation to his next manifestation
[59:20] to a higher grounds amen so when you
[59:23] have you're a christian you're a child
[59:24] of god
[59:25] a son of god and you are going through
[59:26] trials it doesn't mean the devil is the
[59:28] one in control of your life no
[59:30] the devil doesn't control the life of a
[59:32] son of god you have got christ in your
[59:34] life
[59:34] is the pill of fire that is bringing you
[59:36] to a higher level amen
[59:38] so he allows the brokenness first so
[59:40] that you can create a new masterpiece in
[59:42] your lives
[59:43] glory hallelujah so whatever to happens
[59:45] to you is for a good cause
[59:47] it might not look at the present time
[59:50] but the lord has a purpose for it
[59:52] then we have what you call the birth
[59:54] through sex
[59:55] sex birth that is the creation that
[59:57] brought forth
[59:58] king and abel right good and bad
[1:00:01] knowledge of good and bad the tree of
[1:00:02] knowledge of good and
[1:00:03] bad we're not no we are not talking
[1:00:05] about a physical tree truly present a
[1:00:07] person
[1:00:08] amen jesus is a tree of life by the tree
[1:00:11] of good and bad
[1:00:12] this and that god is not about good
[1:00:16] he's about eternity amen satan doesn't
[1:00:19] do bad things only you know the satan
[1:00:20] has got good things too
[1:00:22] a lot of things that i mean that is very
[1:00:24] good
[1:00:26] you couldn't have traveled without
[1:00:27] satan's vehicle
[1:00:29] that is civilization came from the uh
[1:00:31] what fifth dimension
[1:00:33] yeah jet planes the instrument that we
[1:00:35] use is satan civilization
[1:00:37] and they are good we use them we use
[1:00:39] cell phones
[1:00:41] the element is god but then the creation
[1:00:44] sorry not the creation
[1:00:45] the perversion is what satan did amen
[1:00:48] and the lord use it for a good cause
[1:00:49] because the lord ordained satan for that
[1:00:51] purpose
[1:00:52] so don't blame satan don't blame the
[1:00:54] devil the lord is the one who
[1:00:56] allows the devil to do what he does so
[1:00:58] that the lord will glorify himself amen
[1:01:01] glory to god then the third creation is
[1:01:03] the creation of jesus christ
[1:01:05] that is the lugus that is by the spoken
[1:01:07] word which brings
[1:01:08] life eternal amen so we experience all
[1:01:12] of them we experience the first creation
[1:01:14] we experience the second creation the
[1:01:16] fall and the third creation eternity
[1:01:19] where the creator himself speak his life
[1:01:22] into you
[1:01:23] glory hallelujah by the new birth
[1:01:26] glory to the lord jesus christ also we
[1:01:29] broke
[1:01:29] certain ways let me take a cup of water
[1:01:38] we're just trying to go over what we did
[1:01:40] last week to take off from there
[1:01:42] we broke some of the uh hebrew west uh
[1:01:47] the words that we used last week
[1:01:49] jerusalem means gas city of peace that
[1:01:52] is the rest
[1:01:52] where the wife of christ plus the
[1:01:54] remnant of the jews
[1:01:57] now god is calling you or has already
[1:02:00] called you to
[1:02:01] abdullah land what is abuela land
[1:02:04] bula is the earthly land that you dwell
[1:02:07] in i'm not talking about the physical
[1:02:08] land in israel
[1:02:09] it's a type the natural types are
[1:02:11] spiritual your land your sistine element
[1:02:14] is the land of beulah when you have the
[1:02:16] holy ghost baptism
[1:02:17] you have been redeemed you are a son or
[1:02:19] a daughter of christ
[1:02:21] you are working on beulah land now
[1:02:23] before the holy ghost baptism
[1:02:25] you are living in desolation desolation
[1:02:27] means a desert
[1:02:29] a land of cases a despised place
[1:02:32] where nobody wants full of suffering and
[1:02:34] pain but then when the lord calls you
[1:02:37] he changes your heart how does it change
[1:02:39] your heart he doesn't do a physical
[1:02:40] surgery
[1:02:41] but he does a supernatural surgery he
[1:02:43] consumes the old person
[1:02:45] and then he comes to dwell on the inside
[1:02:48] the lord is a thought
[1:02:49] before even you were born again that
[1:02:51] thought was already in you
[1:02:53] amen the day you draw from your mother's
[1:02:55] womb you are
[1:02:56] you had something eternal about you
[1:02:59] regardless of
[1:03:00] how you were born regardless of your
[1:03:02] sins regardless of anything
[1:03:05] there's a portion of christ in you and
[1:03:07] that lord that we call it the mind of
[1:03:09] christ
[1:03:10] the seed of god is in you all the days
[1:03:12] of your life
[1:03:14] and throughout time and eternity but
[1:03:16] then there's an appointed time and
[1:03:17] season for everything else ecclesiastes
[1:03:19] solomon preached the preacher preached
[1:03:21] that there's a time to be born
[1:03:23] and a time to die a time to gather
[1:03:25] stones a time to disperse things
[1:03:27] so there's a time the lord take fucon
[1:03:29] through control that's the time he
[1:03:31] allows the enemy
[1:03:32] to rule your life he can push you
[1:03:34] through pervasion
[1:03:36] desolation and you become a forsaken
[1:03:38] land
[1:03:39] now there's a time the lord allows the
[1:03:41] word the word man the theophany the
[1:03:43] celestial being in you
[1:03:44] to quicken your your terrestrial body
[1:03:47] and then it brings you into a land
[1:03:49] a condition called beulah land amen
[1:03:53] so billa land is a land of blessing
[1:03:56] we also talk about a hebrew alphabet
[1:03:59] that the hebrew alphabets are not just
[1:04:00] alphabet like the english alphabet that
[1:04:02] we use
[1:04:03] but now the hebrew alphabet have got a
[1:04:05] crowns
[1:04:06] they've got diadem as we read from the
[1:04:08] scripture the lord the creator will die
[1:04:09] at them
[1:04:10] that is gold decoration it signifies
[1:04:13] it signifies deity authority and the
[1:04:16] power
[1:04:17] and redemption amen when you remember
[1:04:19] the story about the prodigal son
[1:04:21] when he went out on his own took his
[1:04:23] property and
[1:04:25] went out you know in sin and unbelief
[1:04:27] and in destruction
[1:04:29] he came back broken he ended up eating
[1:04:31] with pigs
[1:04:32] it's a type i don't think anybody would
[1:04:34] like to eat with pigs
[1:04:36] you want to eat with human beings
[1:04:37] because you're a human being by now the
[1:04:39] product prodigal son made their own
[1:04:41] decision
[1:04:41] and went all the way into into hades
[1:04:45] hedis means hell
[1:04:47] hell i'm not talking about a physical
[1:04:49] hold you thinking
[1:04:50] you can be on earth and be sinking in
[1:04:52] sin
[1:04:53] sinking in wretchedness thinking in
[1:04:55] brokenness sinking in unbelief
[1:04:58] but then when you go the furthest you
[1:05:00] can go the love of god you can
[1:05:01] oh i mean you can't go beyond the love
[1:05:03] of christ you can't go where the love of
[1:05:04] christ will not reach you
[1:05:05] the love of christ reached the polygam
[1:05:07] and brought him back home
[1:05:08] and he came back he knew his his i mean
[1:05:11] he did the wrong thing
[1:05:12] he said father i don't even deserve to
[1:05:14] be called your son i just want to be a
[1:05:16] servant i want to just get my daily
[1:05:17] bread
[1:05:17] but what did the father do he called the
[1:05:19] family to bring gold
[1:05:21] jewels to bring a a ring
[1:05:24] and put it upon his son because he's
[1:05:26] always a son
[1:05:27] regardless of his fallen estate so even
[1:05:30] when mankind fell
[1:05:32] we didn't fall away from the sonship of
[1:05:34] god
[1:05:35] we fell away from our position as a son
[1:05:38] but we are so sons and daughters of god
[1:05:39] amen the glory of the lord was there so
[1:05:42] the letter
[1:05:43] uh alif which is the jewish letter for
[1:05:47] e that letter signifies the omnipotency
[1:05:50] of
[1:05:50] of elohim lord himself
[1:05:54] the great creator he's the source of
[1:05:56] life
[1:05:57] and every existence thereof satan is not
[1:05:59] a creator no
[1:06:01] the lord is the one who created jesus
[1:06:02] christ is the creator of heaven and the
[1:06:05] earth
[1:06:05] he create his another meaning of alif
[1:06:08] means someone who can create
[1:06:10] something or world out of nothing
[1:06:13] and i want you to uh we're going to lay
[1:06:16] some emphasis on that hold on to this
[1:06:18] one
[1:06:19] the one who can create something or
[1:06:21] world
[1:06:22] different world and i'm not talking
[1:06:24] about this cosmic world i'm talking
[1:06:27] about
[1:06:27] a condition what condition do you want
[1:06:30] in your life at this time
[1:06:32] you can create your own desire amen
[1:06:36] if you have elohim so he can create
[1:06:38] something out of nothing
[1:06:40] he can create great things out of
[1:06:42] emptiness because that is his attribute
[1:06:45] now when you come to the letter b the
[1:06:47] hebrew letter b
[1:06:49] is not uh is quite different from our
[1:06:52] letters that
[1:06:53] our english letter the letter b is
[1:06:54] called beth
[1:06:56] b e i-t-h or b-e-t beth means a house
[1:07:01] a tent a tabernacle god multiplying
[1:07:05] himself
[1:07:06] because the lord elohim didn't want to
[1:07:08] remain elohim
[1:07:09] and in the theophany forever he wanted
[1:07:11] to have an earthly manifestation
[1:07:13] so begin to he push adam on earth adam
[1:07:15] came to earth
[1:07:17] and then cain and abel and noah and
[1:07:20] all of them begin to multiply so the
[1:07:22] lord wants to multiply himself
[1:07:24] eternity is a multiplication he can
[1:07:27] divide himself and he'll still be one
[1:07:28] amen there's only one eternal life
[1:07:31] it doesn't matter how many billions and
[1:07:34] trillions and gazillions of
[1:07:35] sons and daughters of god they only have
[1:07:37] one life
[1:07:38] eternal life the life of jesus christ
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:42] so now the letter b
[1:07:45] represent the creator and the creation
[1:07:48] because the creator wants to occupy his
[1:07:49] peace
[1:07:51] he wants to bring himself into creation
[1:07:53] he wants to manifest himself
[1:07:55] into nothingness so he spoke his word
[1:07:58] and the word is life amen it doesn't
[1:08:01] matter he didn't live in time
[1:08:02] he was a timeless speechless being he
[1:08:06] was a self-existent
[1:08:07] and so he spoke just by thought he
[1:08:09] progressed his thoughts
[1:08:11] and the thought moved and created earth
[1:08:13] created florida
[1:08:15] brought a beautiful palm trees in
[1:08:17] florida brought
[1:08:18] lakes and rivers and alligators and
[1:08:21] different beautiful creations in florida
[1:08:22] he spoke into into um into all the world
[1:08:25] you can think about
[1:08:26] all the forests and the beautiful things
[1:08:28] the sky the moon
[1:08:29] the planet by creation by the spoken
[1:08:32] word
[1:08:33] and the same creative power is in you
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:37] the same spirit is in you amen you might
[1:08:40] not need the land of
[1:08:41] uh florida you might not need mercury as
[1:08:44] a planet to live in
[1:08:45] you might not need a jupiter as a planet
[1:08:48] to live on
[1:08:48] but you might need something in your
[1:08:50] life right now amen
[1:08:52] and it doesn't matter what you need it
[1:08:54] doesn't matter the weight it doesn't
[1:08:55] matter how it looks unreachable to your
[1:08:57] human self
[1:08:58] there's something in you beyond this
[1:09:00] human flesh and that is why the word
[1:09:02] said
[1:09:03] the lord said to moses why cry speak the
[1:09:05] word
[1:09:06] amen speak your land into creation
[1:09:09] manifest from your heart into creation
[1:09:11] because you are not just a human being
[1:09:13] you are a daughter and a son of god and
[1:09:16] you are christ jesus
[1:09:17] in manifestation amen glory hallelujah
[1:09:20] to the lord
[1:09:22] so that is the lord bringing
[1:09:26] bringing manifestation remember the
[1:09:27] bible said that adam was created
[1:09:30] was made a god on earth
[1:09:33] how was other made god on earth the
[1:09:35] ethnic creation that we see the lord
[1:09:37] used adam to bring it into manifestation
[1:09:39] because he wants his son to manifest
[1:09:42] that deity in him
[1:09:44] like when you see animals when they
[1:09:45] train their young ones
[1:09:47] take for example an ego the iglesias are
[1:09:49] born as
[1:09:50] little bitty things they don't know what
[1:09:52] to do they don't even know about flying
[1:09:54] when they are born they don't even have
[1:09:56] feathers every time they grow feathers
[1:09:57] they don't know the use of the feathers
[1:09:59] they come a point where the
[1:10:01] the the the ego their mother ego has to
[1:10:04] train them
[1:10:05] so what it does is they are living in a
[1:10:07] comfortable nest
[1:10:09] and the ego has got a sharp velocity
[1:10:11] very forceful
[1:10:12] spirit in him it's one of the most
[1:10:14] powerful heavenly
[1:10:16] uh creation that is the ego so the ego
[1:10:19] goes away far away from
[1:10:20] from from uh from the nest and it comes
[1:10:24] with a very terrific speed
[1:10:25] and hit the nest boom and now the nest
[1:10:29] is scattered
[1:10:30] now the eggless they are sometimes the
[1:10:31] nest could be on a rock could be on a
[1:10:33] tree
[1:10:34] so now here's the eagles falling down
[1:10:36] they've never flown before they don't
[1:10:37] understand
[1:10:38] the concept of flying but now a storm
[1:10:41] pushes them away from the comfort zone
[1:10:43] and now they begin to stretch out their
[1:10:45] hands because they have to they have to
[1:10:47] i mean hold on to something
[1:10:48] the next is broken they can't hold on to
[1:10:50] the nest so now that forces them to
[1:10:52] stretch
[1:10:52] their their wings
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:57] by flopping their wings okay wow i've
[1:10:59] never seen it before it's a miracle
[1:11:01] i never know i could fly so now they're
[1:11:03] forcing them it's already in them
[1:11:05] but they didn't know so through their
[1:11:07] mothers
[1:11:09] destroying destroying the nest now they
[1:11:11] are pushed
[1:11:13] to bring an attribute that they have
[1:11:14] never experienced on this earth
[1:11:16] it's been in them through time and
[1:11:18] eternity but there's a time that
[1:11:20] attribute has been manifested
[1:11:21] that's what happens when the lord brings
[1:11:23] trials in our lives yes the trusts are
[1:11:25] not pleasant i'm not saying trust a
[1:11:26] pleasure and nobody called for trials
[1:11:28] nobody pray lord give me one more trial
[1:11:30] no wonder you pray lord
[1:11:31] deliver me from temptation i don't want
[1:11:33] to go into that trials
[1:11:35] but sometimes the lord give us trial to
[1:11:37] bring us bring the attribute
[1:11:39] out of us because we are him and he is
[1:11:42] us
[1:11:42] glory hallelujah so these eaglets begin
[1:11:45] to now
[1:11:46] push out their wings and flop them and
[1:11:48] begin to fly
[1:11:49] and the mother is there to guide them
[1:11:51] and direct them pick them when they are
[1:11:53] falling down and then push them again
[1:11:54] fly so now they get begin to get
[1:11:56] comfortable okay
[1:11:57] flop their wings and fly but i said time
[1:11:59] he has to
[1:12:00] give them another training push them to
[1:12:01] the second pool amen
[1:12:03] what does he do he has to now train them
[1:12:05] how to how to face a clouds
[1:12:08] they could be flying just on the surface
[1:12:10] of the earth but now there's going to
[1:12:11] fly in the clouds
[1:12:13] so no matter what when thick clouds
[1:12:17] just like if you have flown in jet plane
[1:12:19] before you know what is meant by cloud
[1:12:21] when they say storm storm is the third
[1:12:23] pool but let me use just clouds so
[1:12:24] the clouds has got the speed but not as
[1:12:26] bad as the storm
[1:12:28] so their mother pushed them to to go
[1:12:30] into the clouds
[1:12:32] and then because they are they are
[1:12:33] created to be a heavenly creation
[1:12:36] they've got eyes that can see can see
[1:12:38] more than any other
[1:12:39] uh heavenly heavenly creatures they can
[1:12:42] see beyond
[1:12:42] human being so now when the mother
[1:12:44] pushed them to flow through the clouds
[1:12:47] and the class has got velocity you get
[1:12:49] they get jake and they get pushed around
[1:12:51] but then they make it and they realize
[1:12:53] that wow i never seen this before
[1:12:55] glorious i never saw the earth is so
[1:12:57] beautiful they could see the trees the
[1:12:59] mountains
[1:13:00] they could see rivers they can't they
[1:13:01] can i mean spot the fish in the sea
[1:13:04] the further the eagle goes the higher it
[1:13:06] goes the more it can see
[1:13:08] it doesn't make sense how can you see
[1:13:10] when you are further away
[1:13:12] if i can see this uh this uh riding on
[1:13:15] the wall but
[1:13:16] the hour has come and now john 4 23
[1:13:19] in new zealand read it anyways the hour
[1:13:20] but the hour has come sorry but the hour
[1:13:23] cometh
[1:13:23] and now is when the true worshipers
[1:13:25] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:13:27] in truth
[1:13:27] for the father second search to worship
[1:13:29] him john 4 23
[1:13:32] if i go i will begin to go away maybe
[1:13:34] out of that building
[1:13:36] i'll get to a point i can't read it i
[1:13:38] get to say if
[1:13:39] i can't see it again but the ego the
[1:13:42] further away he goes from the writing
[1:13:44] the better he can even see it's the
[1:13:46] things of god doesn't make sense
[1:13:48] it's not by reasoning it's by revelation
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:52] if you reason around it it's not going
[1:13:53] to make sense how can i see something
[1:13:55] better when i'm further away from it
[1:13:57] that is the ego spirit amen when the
[1:14:00] storm gets stronger when the trust gets
[1:14:02] tougher
[1:14:03] that is when great miracles happen in
[1:14:05] your life glory hallelujah because you
[1:14:07] are an eglet you are an ego
[1:14:09] amen so they go through their training
[1:14:11] in the clouds
[1:14:12] then the third pool is when they say
[1:14:13] stone the mother went to there's a
[1:14:16] hurricane
[1:14:17] there's a storm somewhere it's okay now
[1:14:18] we are going to you guys have passed the
[1:14:20] first pool
[1:14:21] you've done the second pool now we have
[1:14:23] to go to the third pool where you guys
[1:14:25] are going to face storm greet torrential
[1:14:27] storms
[1:14:28] you are going to face the east winds the
[1:14:30] trials of the world
[1:14:32] you are going to face uh disasters
[1:14:34] catastrophes
[1:14:35] sickness whatever failure but there's
[1:14:38] something in you
[1:14:39] to overcome and conquer all those
[1:14:41] afflictions
[1:14:42] so the mother to them when there's a
[1:14:43] storm you take them through the storm
[1:14:45] and the storm can sweep them and kill
[1:14:47] them but there's something in an
[1:14:49] ego that he can stretch out his wings
[1:14:52] at a certain direction and he can let
[1:14:54] the storm take him where he want to go
[1:14:57] the storm would that that storm will
[1:14:58] kill any other heavenly bed
[1:15:00] it will kill a buzzard it will kill a
[1:15:04] a crow it will kill every other creek
[1:15:07] heavenly bed beside the eagle because
[1:15:10] the eagle was ordained
[1:15:11] and made for that amen there's a trial
[1:15:13] you go through that when someone goes
[1:15:15] through
[1:15:16] that person will not survive but the
[1:15:18] lord trusts you and he permitted that
[1:15:19] trial
[1:15:20] in your life amen the lord knew that you
[1:15:22] can overcome and bring the attribute out
[1:15:24] of your life so you permit
[1:15:26] those trials to bring you to where you
[1:15:28] are amen
[1:15:29] there's a proverb in a a ghanaian
[1:15:31] proverb that there's a
[1:15:32] a trial that hits a cat
[1:15:36] and the cat will still be staring and
[1:15:37] looking and be cheerful when
[1:15:39] they try to hit a dog everybody will
[1:15:41] hear that oh dog is going through the
[1:15:42] don't be backing all over whoa whoa whoa
[1:15:44] whoa whoa
[1:15:45] everybody will know that the dog is
[1:15:47] having a trial
[1:15:48] but when they say when the same try hit
[1:15:50] the cat the cat will be just looking at
[1:15:52] the trial
[1:15:52] there's nothing to me i don't care i'm
[1:15:55] overcomer
[1:15:56] amen so a trial that will cause somebody
[1:15:59] to
[1:15:59] flop or somebody to backslide it to move
[1:16:02] you further closer to christ
[1:16:04] because you're a son and a daughter of
[1:16:06] god amen
[1:16:08] a trial that will push someone away from
[1:16:09] the word it will push you more closer to
[1:16:11] the lord
[1:16:12] because you are you are christ in
[1:16:14] manifestation jesus had tries to
[1:16:16] amen when he was born they have to even
[1:16:19] take him away
[1:16:20] and hide him in egypt because not
[1:16:22] pharaoh
[1:16:23] herald wanted to kill him he went
[1:16:26] through trials
[1:16:27] but then the trials brought the
[1:16:29] attribute he was a king
[1:16:31] when he was born he was worshiped as a
[1:16:33] king
[1:16:34] but he couldn't manifest as a king as in
[1:16:36] a childhood
[1:16:37] when he grew up at age of 30 he began to
[1:16:39] preach his gospel his gospel was so
[1:16:41] weird
[1:16:42] he was a weird nobody wanted that gospel
[1:16:44] someone who could say that i can break i
[1:16:46] can destroy destroy the air i can
[1:16:48] destroy the temple of solomon in three
[1:16:49] days and and raise it in three days
[1:16:51] no no way this temple was born in it was
[1:16:54] built 40 years how can you do such a
[1:16:57] thing
[1:16:58] his gospel said that i am the son of god
[1:17:00] that live on earth and in heaven how can
[1:17:02] you live in two dimensions
[1:17:03] so they say no we got to kill this guy
[1:17:05] he said demon but is the son of the
[1:17:07] living god is god himself the almighty
[1:17:09] god in flesh
[1:17:10] amen and so are you amen you are jesus
[1:17:13] christ of this day
[1:17:14] you are christ in flesh because when the
[1:17:16] lord finishes a ministry at the age of
[1:17:18] 30 33
[1:17:20] or 33 and a half he said i'll go but
[1:17:23] i'll never leave you comfortless
[1:17:25] i'll be with you even in you
[1:17:28] and you shall do more works greater work
[1:17:30] shall you do
[1:17:31] greater manifestation are you going to
[1:17:32] bring out amen
[1:17:35] glory hallelujah to the lord so birth
[1:17:38] we've gone far away from it beth is how
[1:17:40] the lord
[1:17:41] build a tent where tanaba tabernacle and
[1:17:44] i want to go to a little quote here
[1:17:47] we read from um
[1:17:51] frisbee to god i want to read
[1:17:54] tabanac we are talking about beulah the
[1:17:57] land of blessing
[1:17:59] i want us to read uh if brother simba
[1:18:01] can help me
[1:18:03] christ is revealed in his own way
[1:18:07] 65-0822
[1:18:09] m65 i don't remember exactly how the
[1:18:12] paragraph but then it starts with 6 5-0
[1:18:16] 8
[1:18:16] 22 m christ is revealed in his own word
[1:18:20] he said that is the way moses was he was
[1:18:24] so in the spirit passed out of the
[1:18:27] dimension that he was living in
[1:18:29] and threw their face to face in that
[1:18:31] burning bush
[1:18:33] talking to god himself or we can say
[1:18:35] elohim himself
[1:18:37] take off your shoes the ground you are
[1:18:39] standing is
[1:18:40] holy ground i imagine when moses left
[1:18:43] there
[1:18:43] he thought what happened what taking
[1:18:46] place
[1:18:46] what was it moses has to come face to
[1:18:50] face
[1:18:50] with god he had to come face to face
[1:18:52] with god
[1:18:53] before you can inherit the land of
[1:18:55] beulah you have to come face to face
[1:18:57] with the king of beulah
[1:18:59] amen you might enjoy trekkos or the
[1:19:02] blessings from beulah through somebody
[1:19:03] who is living in villa land
[1:19:05] but when you yourself want to dwell in
[1:19:09] the land of beulah
[1:19:10] you have to come face to face with the
[1:19:11] king of billah the lord jesus christ
[1:19:14] you have to come to a land of holiness a
[1:19:16] land of purity
[1:19:18] a land of righteousness a land of
[1:19:20] celestial dimension
[1:19:22] amen moses had an attribute in him
[1:19:25] he was born a promise a promised son he
[1:19:28] was a type of christ
[1:19:29] he was moses mistaken out of water he
[1:19:32] was he had all the blessing his mother
[1:19:34] taught him his his big sister miriam
[1:19:37] taught
[1:19:37] taught him about his promise he knew
[1:19:40] that he was a jew
[1:19:41] he knew that he was going to be a savior
[1:19:43] but he hadn't come face to face with the
[1:19:45] lord
[1:19:46] so moses tried to deliver on his own
[1:19:49] and he landed him in big trouble he
[1:19:51] ended up being a runaway moses
[1:19:53] but the lord had everything perfectly
[1:19:55] set up for moses in his
[1:19:57] runaway condition he met his wife that
[1:19:59] was odin for him
[1:20:00] so he settled for his wife and just keep
[1:20:02] the ship of his father in law
[1:20:04] there was greater things for him to do
[1:20:06] so moses was working
[1:20:08] in his own intellectual mind in this
[1:20:10] dimension he was a prophet he saw vision
[1:20:12] the day he was born the pill of fire was
[1:20:13] there came to the room that he was born
[1:20:15] in
[1:20:16] but he hasn't come face to face with the
[1:20:18] lord so there was a time that the lord
[1:20:21] appeared unto moses in a burning bush
[1:20:23] and remember moses was a scientist
[1:20:25] he was a doctor he was a military
[1:20:27] general he was a lawyer
[1:20:29] he was he has all the specialties
[1:20:31] combined in him
[1:20:32] so he was somebody was intellectual age
[1:20:34] of 40.
[1:20:35] he knew that medicine way beyond the
[1:20:37] medicine that we have he knew that the
[1:20:39] physics and way beyond the effects that
[1:20:40] we have
[1:20:41] he knew the astronomers way beyond he
[1:20:43] could read the zodiac he had all the
[1:20:45] blessings he had all the gift in him
[1:20:47] but at the same time he had not come
[1:20:49] face to face
[1:20:50] with the almighty god amen spanish
[1:20:53] business
[1:20:55] with the lord that's where all of us
[1:20:57] have to come face to face
[1:20:58] with the lord jesus christ and that is
[1:21:01] where it's going to change your
[1:21:02] dimension
[1:21:03] it's going to change your land onto a
[1:21:04] holy land a land flowing with milk and
[1:21:06] honey
[1:21:07] i've got so many scriptures but i'll
[1:21:08] leave them for now so the moses
[1:21:11] saw a bush burning and in his
[1:21:13] intellectual mind
[1:21:14] he was trying to reason how how come
[1:21:16] okay if the bushes maybe
[1:21:17] somebody set a fire but it's not it's
[1:21:20] not being consumed
[1:21:21] what is this he begin to reason and a
[1:21:24] voice came from the bush
[1:21:26] from an abundant fire say moses the land
[1:21:29] that you are dwelling on is a holy land
[1:21:32] remove your shoe
[1:21:33] amen the natura is a type of the
[1:21:36] spiritual things
[1:21:37] the natural shoe is not just the sanders
[1:21:39] he was wearing
[1:21:40] but move from the terrestrial thinking
[1:21:43] and move to the celestia
[1:21:44] move to the celestial dimension move
[1:21:46] from from the second dimension thought
[1:21:48] as a human being you are limited by your
[1:21:51] element the earth that you weigh
[1:21:53] the space around you the time that you
[1:21:55] are living in
[1:21:56] things that you could see around your
[1:21:58] job your grand vision
[1:22:01] and and your family your riches you want
[1:22:04] to make riches you want to get your car
[1:22:06] gay or
[1:22:06] the best house you can build or you can
[1:22:08] buy get a company get
[1:22:10] get money that is what a human being can
[1:22:11] go as far as human is concerned
[1:22:13] but there's a greater vision and a
[1:22:15] greater purpose and a greater reason for
[1:22:17] the lord putting you here
[1:22:19] and when the time comes the lord take
[1:22:20] those things that we do things are good
[1:22:21] you can keep them as a human being
[1:22:23] but then they say something way beyond
[1:22:25] uh riches and money
[1:22:27] and houses and and and those natural
[1:22:30] things
[1:22:30] that is where the lord wants you to
[1:22:31] change dimension move from the second
[1:22:34] dimension
[1:22:35] onto the celestial dimension so the law
[1:22:36] told moses moses
[1:22:38] take away the cup that you're wearing
[1:22:40] take away your earthly mind
[1:22:42] put on the thinking cup of jesus christ
[1:22:45] put on the mind of elohim put on the
[1:22:47] mind of
[1:22:48] jehovah that is the only way you can
[1:22:50] understand why the bush is
[1:22:52] burning and it's not being consumed amen
[1:22:56] when you think you reason you're gonna
[1:22:58] find you're gonna think like what am i
[1:23:00] going through
[1:23:00] am i a christian and i go to trials why
[1:23:03] am i christian
[1:23:04] and i go through problems my family is
[1:23:06] going to do problems why am i a
[1:23:07] christian i'm going through maybe
[1:23:08] financial problem
[1:23:10] i'm sick maybe somebody passed away in
[1:23:12] my family but the lord has got something
[1:23:14] way beyond
[1:23:15] your your reasoning and thinking it's
[1:23:17] got the mind of christ
[1:23:18] he turned himself to manifest in you
[1:23:20] amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:23:23] and the land of biula is a land flowing
[1:23:25] with milk and honey
[1:23:27] glory hallelujah to the lord i want to
[1:23:28] read i'm still on the
[1:23:31] the second alphabet that is beulah i
[1:23:33] want to read
[1:23:35] a quote from fellowship by redemption
[1:23:42] 55-0403-550403 fellowship
[1:23:44] by redemption and it's going to be a
[1:23:46] little longer
[1:23:50] a little long reading let's start from
[1:23:53] uh paragraph 9
[1:23:54] 98. the prophet was talking about a
[1:23:57] house
[1:23:57] in salon the letter b house tent
[1:24:00] tabernacle
[1:24:01] and the prophet progressed in their
[1:24:02] revelation there was a time the lord
[1:24:04] gave me a revelation preacher sometimes
[1:24:06] don't
[1:24:07] drop revelation as long as soon as the
[1:24:08] lord give them they pray over it
[1:24:10] they ponder over it and they even think
[1:24:12] how other people receive it
[1:24:13] and when the lord is time for the lord
[1:24:15] the lord give them the the leeway to
[1:24:17] give the revelation
[1:24:18] the lord give them the anointing then
[1:24:20] they bring that anointing he said i've
[1:24:21] never believed that heaven was a place
[1:24:23] where there's a bunch of buildings
[1:24:25] where there's a bunch of houses up there
[1:24:28] made with water
[1:24:29] dabbed with paper paint paint on the
[1:24:32] wall i've never believed that
[1:24:33] a supernatural being will have to live
[1:24:35] in a little house
[1:24:36] in other words literal house means an
[1:24:38] ugly house we are physical beings
[1:24:41] we are second dimensional beans we are
[1:24:42] time beings so we need to live in houses
[1:24:45] we need to have a roof on top of us we
[1:24:47] need to have clothes
[1:24:48] shoes cars and what our view but then
[1:24:51] the supernatural theophany
[1:24:52] doesn't need to live in this house no he
[1:24:55] doesn't need to have decorations no
[1:24:57] they've got a different house and that's
[1:24:58] what the prophet is talking about is
[1:25:01] he said john the lord said in
[1:25:04] john 14 in my father's house is many
[1:25:06] mansion
[1:25:07] he meant a body a dwelling place for the
[1:25:11] scripture
[1:25:11] very verified the same thing and said if
[1:25:14] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:25:16] we have one already waiting you see
[1:25:20] mortar beans is the only one who lives
[1:25:22] in a mortar habitation
[1:25:24] human beings live in this mortal flesh
[1:25:27] then the place
[1:25:28] that we go into until we return back is
[1:25:30] not a place of brick and mortar
[1:25:32] no thank you brothers and a clay or
[1:25:35] preciousness or jewels
[1:25:37] it is a place of condition and i want
[1:25:39] you to know the word
[1:25:40] condition the place that celestia place
[1:25:43] it's not like a house that we are in
[1:25:45] we've got seats and chairs and bed and
[1:25:46] pillows
[1:25:47] and dining tables no that is not the
[1:25:49] type of house we go into
[1:25:50] that's not the type the lord created but
[1:25:52] then we go into a condition
[1:25:54] so let's look at the condition he's
[1:25:55] talking about we're going to a condition
[1:25:57] that we move out of this dimension
[1:25:59] that we live into into another dimension
[1:26:02] it's a house a tabernacle a dwelling
[1:26:04] place
[1:26:05] said i got a revelation the other d
[1:26:08] paragraph 103
[1:26:09] i'm just jumping up and down the
[1:26:11] paragraph so 103. i got a revelation the
[1:26:13] other day standing up there on mount
[1:26:15] paloma
[1:26:16] at the observatory and seeing the time
[1:26:19] the space over to mars
[1:26:20] and to the last continent and so forth
[1:26:23] and light traveling
[1:26:24] at so many thousands miles per second
[1:26:26] 104.
[1:26:27] if an angel started from the father's
[1:26:30] star coming here it will take it will
[1:26:33] take it
[1:26:34] billions times billions 10 billions
[1:26:38] of years to get here if you started from
[1:26:40] mass
[1:26:41] and come here flying at a speed of light
[1:26:44] of light space or light speed it will
[1:26:46] take him billions of years to get here
[1:26:48] is that if an angel lives on mass
[1:26:51] and that angel wants to travel like the
[1:26:52] way human being travel
[1:26:54] but it's not traveling by jet flight is
[1:26:56] traveled by astronauts
[1:26:58] and they can go the speed of light now
[1:27:00] still going to take that angel
[1:27:02] billions of billions of billions of
[1:27:04] years you can imagine
[1:27:06] billions of years to get to earth is so
[1:27:09] way far
[1:27:10] beyond our human what your human
[1:27:11] consumption can grasp
[1:27:13] is that i cannot believe that there's a
[1:27:16] house way out yonder
[1:27:18] but i believe that the house that god
[1:27:19] was speaking
[1:27:21] of is right present here now and i want
[1:27:24] us to take note
[1:27:25] the house the lord is talking about the
[1:27:27] condition he said when we go to the
[1:27:29] other side
[1:27:29] we live in a house but not this house
[1:27:32] it's a condition
[1:27:33] it's a dimension and it's right here now
[1:27:36] it's not in the future
[1:27:37] it's not in the past it's right here now
[1:27:40] that is the place where the mortar beans
[1:27:42] when we cease to be mortar we step into
[1:27:44] immortal
[1:27:45] immortality yonder into a place and i
[1:27:48] believe that where jesus is today
[1:27:50] the resurrected lord jesus not out
[1:27:53] yonder somewhere
[1:27:54] a million miles away but right here
[1:27:58] paragraph 106 but right here present
[1:28:01] with us
[1:28:01] now the resurrected jesus christ
[1:28:05] hasn't gone into mass or mercury jupiter
[1:28:08] venus
[1:28:08] or another planet somewhere but it's
[1:28:11] right here
[1:28:12] in a celestial dimension all right let's
[1:28:15] go we said 107. in the fourth dimension
[1:28:17] people can prove
[1:28:18] right through people can prove that
[1:28:21] right through this room is coming
[1:28:22] radioactivity we are using instrument
[1:28:25] i'm speaking through a microphone i'm
[1:28:27] far away from maybe people in
[1:28:29] in their homes in west palm beach some
[1:28:31] in different states
[1:28:32] but yes they can hear me they can see my
[1:28:34] picture is the power
[1:28:36] is the dimension of their forth that is
[1:28:38] their tv width tv waves radio waves
[1:28:40] gamma waves
[1:28:42] the scientific dimension our body cannot
[1:28:44] detect it we are not made to detect
[1:28:46] those dimensions
[1:28:47] we cannot detect electronics we can see
[1:28:49] them in images when they become
[1:28:51] victoria but we cannot detect those
[1:28:54] dimensions
[1:28:55] they belong to their fourth dimension
[1:28:57] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:28:59] so coming through this building is now
[1:29:01] coming television pictures
[1:29:02] but it's too fast for our eyes by graph
[1:29:05] 10108
[1:29:06] now you go millions of miles beyond that
[1:29:09] dimension
[1:29:10] and you get into a place just as real as
[1:29:12] television pictures
[1:29:14] is in this room this morning there is
[1:29:16] the lord jesus christ
[1:29:17] the resurrected son of god standing here
[1:29:20] and the reason that
[1:29:21] you can't see him is because our heart
[1:29:23] hasn't become
[1:29:24] tuned down to it and i want us to note
[1:29:28] that word
[1:29:29] our heart hasn't become tuned down to it
[1:29:34] if you can go to the lamppost here if
[1:29:35] you can go to a and the old time when
[1:29:37] they used to use
[1:29:38] radio right this is everything is
[1:29:40] internet
[1:29:41] so you can use you can listen to radio
[1:29:43] on internet but
[1:29:44] i'm talking about the old-fashioned
[1:29:46] radio where you have to tune in to free
[1:29:48] use frequencies
[1:29:49] you have to tune into maybe a certain
[1:29:50] frequency 107. maybe you want to listen
[1:29:52] to
[1:29:53] a certain radio a christian radio
[1:29:55] broadcast from let's say
[1:29:56] miami but then when you are driving
[1:29:59] you go to a place you don't hear because
[1:30:01] it's out of tune
[1:30:03] but then when you get to that frequency
[1:30:04] and your reduced frequencies go the
[1:30:06] radio has got
[1:30:07] magnets and crystal and when that
[1:30:09] frequency line up with the frequency
[1:30:11] incoming frequency you can hear
[1:30:12] everything crystal clear
[1:30:14] that is the dimension that is the
[1:30:16] dimension which is the what the fourth
[1:30:17] dimension
[1:30:18] all right and now the prophet is saying
[1:30:20] that the reason why we don't see jesus
[1:30:22] christ we put him far away from us
[1:30:23] it's because we have no tuning to him
[1:30:27] we are still being troubled by the
[1:30:28] things of the world we are so
[1:30:30] battling the world so we don't have the
[1:30:32] mind of christ to tune into that
[1:30:34] dimension
[1:30:35] but then we have the mind of if we empty
[1:30:37] ourselves if we
[1:30:38] like moses moses was stripped from all
[1:30:41] his scientific knowledge
[1:30:42] all his medicine all his military powers
[1:30:45] and then he had to come face to face
[1:30:47] with the lord jesus christ that is when
[1:30:49] the lord transformed moses
[1:30:51] to make him a god amen the lord said
[1:30:54] that moses
[1:30:55] i'm going to make you he said i can't
[1:30:56] speak he said no i make
[1:30:58] the mouth of a person i am the one who
[1:31:00] put the voice in you
[1:31:02] so you go and you mostly your brother
[1:31:04] will be your prophet i'm not going to
[1:31:05] make you a prophet you're already a
[1:31:06] prophet you are born a prophet
[1:31:08] but i'm going to make you a god i'm
[1:31:10] going to make you god because you are
[1:31:11] going to create things
[1:31:12] amen and what did moses do did what did
[1:31:15] he do he come face to face with
[1:31:17] uh the red sea there was no way
[1:31:20] in between the red sea he's got two
[1:31:22] million people on his hands
[1:31:24] that he needed to deliver pharaoh and
[1:31:26] the army with the military
[1:31:27] with horses and and if it's modern time
[1:31:30] with ak-47
[1:31:31] with bullets with a atomic powers with
[1:31:35] nuclear weapons
[1:31:36] and moses had only a piece of stick in
[1:31:38] his hand
[1:31:39] how is he going to fight the military
[1:31:41] might of egypt with a stick in his hands
[1:31:44] moses now became a creator in that
[1:31:47] moment
[1:31:47] the guard in him came out amen moses
[1:31:51] spoke
[1:31:52] resc open and they see open left and
[1:31:55] right
[1:31:55] fitha and heather and moses and the
[1:31:57] people of god went through it
[1:31:58] amen now the lord has put the same
[1:32:00] attributes in you
[1:32:02] by the holy ghost baptism when you come
[1:32:04] face to face with your condition
[1:32:05] which is adversity what do you do christ
[1:32:08] in you
[1:32:09] the expression of glory christ in you
[1:32:11] the hope of glory
[1:32:13] speak the word in your heart if you
[1:32:14] don't have the word in your heart you
[1:32:16] can speak the word of a man
[1:32:17] nothing is going to happen but when
[1:32:19] you've got the holy ghost in your heart
[1:32:20] when you speak the holy ghost in you
[1:32:23] christ in you will manifest his glory
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:27] now so he said the reason why many
[1:32:28] people cannot see
[1:32:30] christ is because they are not tuning
[1:32:32] onto him let me read a little more
[1:32:34] further
[1:32:36] glory to the lord okay
[1:32:41] let me read from i think i go to where
[1:32:42] he said there's the lord jesus christ
[1:32:43] the resurrected
[1:32:44] son of god standing here and the reason
[1:32:46] that you can't see him is because
[1:32:48] our heart hasn't become tuned down to it
[1:32:51] and the reason we can't see the
[1:32:52] television picture
[1:32:54] we are our bodies are not set as
[1:32:57] instrument to pick up
[1:32:58] mechanical things 109
[1:33:01] but when our body becomes in tune with
[1:33:03] god in other words in tune with our
[1:33:05] creator
[1:33:06] become a part of him then our soul can
[1:33:09] pick up the power of the holy spirit
[1:33:11] to vindicate the presence of the lord
[1:33:12] jesus christ in all of his power
[1:33:15] and omnipotence this is so powerful
[1:33:19] when our body become in tune
[1:33:22] with the lord himself then we can pick
[1:33:25] up all the power
[1:33:27] in the selection the power that we threw
[1:33:29] in mercury the power that we threw in
[1:33:31] heaven somewhere
[1:33:32] the power that we put in the future the
[1:33:34] power that we put back away in the time
[1:33:36] of moses
[1:33:37] the power that we put on willie abraham
[1:33:39] the power that we put on isaiah
[1:33:40] the power that we put on hannah and so
[1:33:42] i'm nothing
[1:33:43] i remember hannah was able to speak
[1:33:45] cried out and he had a son
[1:33:47] when she was 17 years old when she has
[1:33:49] gone through menopause
[1:33:50] but i cannot do it but when you get in
[1:33:53] tune
[1:33:54] when the lord tunes you to himself
[1:33:57] then you can speak like hannah you can
[1:34:00] cry out
[1:34:01] like esther you can go to the king and
[1:34:05] instead of being killed get redemption
[1:34:07] for your people amen glory hallelujah
[1:34:10] he said then become part of him i will
[1:34:11] so come pick up the power of the holy
[1:34:13] spirit
[1:34:14] to vindicate the presence of the lord
[1:34:15] jesus christ in all his power and
[1:34:18] omnipotence he has risen from the dead
[1:34:20] he lives among us today
[1:34:22] and he wants fellowship back with him
[1:34:25] back with his people again his great
[1:34:27] majesty his glory is now spreading forth
[1:34:29] and his desiring to fellowship again
[1:34:31] with his people like he did in the
[1:34:33] garden of eden
[1:34:34] amen the lord is desiring to fellowship
[1:34:37] with you
[1:34:38] there's one thing between worshiping and
[1:34:40] fellowshipping
[1:34:42] when you're dealing with worship you are
[1:34:44] talking about
[1:34:45] a higher power and a lower power
[1:34:49] you worship a king you worship people
[1:34:52] worship president
[1:34:54] people worship flags people worship
[1:34:56] vehicles
[1:34:57] people worship other human beings
[1:34:59] because they deem those people higher
[1:35:00] than them
[1:35:01] so they worship them but now the lord
[1:35:03] wants fellowship what is the meaning of
[1:35:05] the word fellowship two fellows in one
[1:35:07] word sheep
[1:35:09] the lord wants to be on the same boat
[1:35:10] with you he doesn't want to be somewhere
[1:35:13] way high and you are way down here oh
[1:35:14] lord this is me i'm poor
[1:35:16] i'm broken lord help me give me one one
[1:35:19] one one what one dollar give me my lunch
[1:35:23] oh lord give me pay my rent for me oh
[1:35:24] lord please
[1:35:26] change my condition tend my home tell my
[1:35:28] children tell my parents lord
[1:35:30] turn my wife around turn my husband
[1:35:32] around he want to be fellowship with you
[1:35:34] what is fellowship two fellas in one
[1:35:37] shape
[1:35:38] worship are you talking about your flesh
[1:35:41] is the shape of zion amen you
[1:35:44] live in this flesh as a human being and
[1:35:47] the holy ghost lives in this place as a
[1:35:48] human being
[1:35:49] and instead of crying out instead of i
[1:35:51] mean moaning around
[1:35:52] instead of getting worried about
[1:35:54] situation remember that
[1:35:56] there are two fellows on the same ship
[1:35:59] you are not alone
[1:36:00] the lord jesus christ is in your ship
[1:36:03] and when the ship is sinking what do you
[1:36:05] do
[1:36:06] call on the lord speak as a lord just as
[1:36:09] a
[1:36:10] peter when the sheep was sinking peter
[1:36:12] remembered that this tomb is going to
[1:36:13] kill us
[1:36:14] so he woke the lord from there says lord
[1:36:16] don't you care
[1:36:17] and the lord spoke that spoke into
[1:36:19] creation support that went out of
[1:36:21] creation brought peace into creation
[1:36:22] amen but there was a time the lord
[1:36:25] wasn't with
[1:36:26] with moses sorry it wasn't with peter as
[1:36:29] he was with them
[1:36:30] on the ship the lord said i'm going to
[1:36:32] die i'll leave you but i'll be in you
[1:36:35] unto the end of the world there's a
[1:36:37] ministry has to continue i'm not done
[1:36:38] with it
[1:36:39] i've just scratched the surface for you
[1:36:42] you guys are going to continue and other
[1:36:43] people are going to continue
[1:36:44] so there was a time when uh peter got in
[1:36:48] tune
[1:36:49] with the lord at the day of pentacles
[1:36:51] that's when the tuning came in
[1:36:53] you don't get tuned until you receive
[1:36:55] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:56] that's when you get the frequency of the
[1:36:58] supernatural
[1:36:59] so there was a time that people were
[1:37:02] sick there were sick people
[1:37:03] they saw that no peter peter is tuned
[1:37:05] with the lord
[1:37:06] this wasn't the same person who was
[1:37:07] casting around and cutting people's ears
[1:37:10] and fighting and battling with his now
[1:37:12] there's something in him
[1:37:14] he's like the lord jesus christ so what
[1:37:16] did they do
[1:37:17] they lay sick people on the streets this
[1:37:20] is not jesus christ this is peter
[1:37:22] delays people that are sick people with
[1:37:24] leprosy people work with cancer
[1:37:26] people with whatever sickness you can
[1:37:28] name it they lay them on the road
[1:37:29] coronavirus
[1:37:31] cancer everything they lead them on the
[1:37:33] streets and then when peter is passing
[1:37:35] by they say prayer adventure by chance
[1:37:37] there's a probability that he'll pass on
[1:37:39] a 17th street he'll pass on a half a
[1:37:42] hill street
[1:37:42] he'll pass on 45th street and his shadow
[1:37:46] will pass on this people and they will
[1:37:47] get well what happened
[1:37:49] and it happened people get got well by
[1:37:52] the shadow of peter
[1:37:53] was it a shadow of peter no it was a
[1:37:56] theophany
[1:37:56] it was a christ himself because he
[1:37:58] promised that i'm going
[1:38:00] but i'll be back i'll come and reign in
[1:38:03] your heart because he's a king
[1:38:04] of sins it's not a king of white house
[1:38:07] the lord jesus christ is here
[1:38:08] reigning in your flesh by the baptism
[1:38:11] and when you tune in with a word
[1:38:13] when you tune in with your message your
[1:38:15] day and your message
[1:38:16] the word becomes ye and amen the word
[1:38:19] becomes
[1:38:20] life it becomes quicken to you and when
[1:38:22] you speak
[1:38:23] you don't speak as brother troy you
[1:38:25] don't speak as brother
[1:38:26] who you don't speak a sister rebecca you
[1:38:28] don't speak assistant tina you don't
[1:38:30] speak us brother jerry
[1:38:31] or a brother quentin or brother simba
[1:38:34] but you speak as jesus christ speaking
[1:38:36] and your word is ye and amen glory
[1:38:39] hallelujah
[1:38:40] that is the land of villa that is where
[1:38:41] the lord is bringing us to that's the
[1:38:43] way the lord wants us to be
[1:38:45] he doesn't want us to be on the desert
[1:38:47] anymore no we finish with a desert life
[1:38:49] he wants to bring you to a land where
[1:38:51] our bodies
[1:38:52] are in tune with him glory be to the
[1:38:55] lord
[1:38:56] now let's look at the another alphabet
[1:39:02] i won't hold you too long glory
[1:39:05] hallelujah let's read one scripture here
[1:39:08] let's read ephesians chapter 3 verse 14
[1:39:10] to
[1:39:11] 15
[1:39:17] efficiency efficient 3 14
[1:39:21] to 17 rather or 18
[1:39:24] sorry let me read from 14 to 18
[1:39:27] ephesians 3 14 to 18.
[1:39:32] for this course i bow my knees unto the
[1:39:34] father
[1:39:35] of our lord jesus christ this is paul
[1:39:37] speaking
[1:39:38] verse 15 is my my point of whom the
[1:39:40] whole family in heaven
[1:39:42] and earth is named the whole family in
[1:39:45] heaven
[1:39:46] and earth is named that he will grant
[1:39:48] you according to the religious of his
[1:39:50] glory
[1:39:50] to be strengthened with the might by his
[1:39:52] spirit in the inner man
[1:39:55] that christ may dwell in your heart by
[1:39:57] faith that you being rooted and grounded
[1:39:59] in love
[1:40:00] may be able to comprehend with all sins
[1:40:03] what is the breath
[1:40:04] and length and death and height of
[1:40:07] christ
[1:40:08] so now we put god in measurement now
[1:40:10] verse 15 said that of whom the whole
[1:40:12] family in heaven
[1:40:14] and earth is named we've got a last name
[1:40:17] our last name is what jesus christ our
[1:40:20] last name is
[1:40:21] eternity our last name is heaven our
[1:40:24] last name is
[1:40:25] celestia dimension our last name is uh
[1:40:28] the great eterna el ella elohim so that
[1:40:31] name
[1:40:32] name is what name is a deity name is not
[1:40:34] just something right on paper and spell
[1:40:36] it on paper
[1:40:36] or you put on document there's a life in
[1:40:39] a name
[1:40:40] there's a spirit in a name so the whole
[1:40:42] heaven the power
[1:40:43] in uh in uh the the
[1:40:47] the angels in heaven that power comes
[1:40:49] from the lord jesus christ
[1:40:50] the sins on earth that power come from
[1:40:53] the lord jesus christ the life in heaven
[1:40:54] in the celestial dimension
[1:40:56] the saint in the theophany and the
[1:40:58] saints here on earth they have the same
[1:41:00] name
[1:41:00] that is the name of jesus christ in
[1:41:02] other words they have the same spirit
[1:41:04] the holy spirit amen because christ
[1:41:07] dwells in our hearts the inner man
[1:41:09] amen so the christ dwelling in you
[1:41:13] is the spirit of christ it's a name that
[1:41:15] is above
[1:41:16] all names it's a name that is above
[1:41:18] every condition on the earth
[1:41:20] it's a name that is above poverty above
[1:41:22] sickness
[1:41:23] above sin above a suffering above pain
[1:41:26] that when you have that name on you that
[1:41:29] name brings you to a land of promise
[1:41:31] a land of blessing that is abuela land
[1:41:34] glory be to the lord
[1:41:36] you want to look at um
[1:41:40] let go to
[1:41:43] the third alphabet
[1:41:49] glory to the lord
[1:41:53] the third alphabet in hebrew is called
[1:41:58] gimel gimel is the third alphabet in the
[1:42:00] hebrew
[1:42:02] now gimel brings harmonizes the two
[1:42:05] alphabet that is
[1:42:06] christ the singleness of god omnipotence
[1:42:10] and god manifesting himself so gimel can
[1:42:13] be seen as the holy spirit baptism
[1:42:15] there's this great almighty god and
[1:42:18] there's his sons and
[1:42:19] subjects on earth now for him to unite
[1:42:21] his people
[1:42:22] he united them by the word by the holy
[1:42:24] spirit baptism amen
[1:42:26] without the holy spirit baptism you are
[1:42:28] limited to the senses of the flesh
[1:42:30] you've got uh five senses in our flesh
[1:42:32] we can hear
[1:42:34] feel this smell and touch that sense
[1:42:37] is earthly senses we've got five senses
[1:42:40] of the spirit
[1:42:40] we've got a memory affection reasoning
[1:42:44] imagination and conscience
[1:42:45] that is your spirit the senses or
[1:42:48] outlets of the human spirit
[1:42:50] but then we've got the eleventh sense or
[1:42:51] the sixth sense that is a sense of faith
[1:42:54] that leads you to the supernatural
[1:42:55] dimension amen
[1:42:57] that is what the third letter does for
[1:42:59] you bring you to a dimension
[1:43:01] that you can manifest as the omnipotent
[1:43:03] christ glory be to god
[1:43:06] blessed be the name of the lord so that
[1:43:08] letter bridges the simple man who is
[1:43:10] falling from greece
[1:43:12] onto his maker not only that to manifest
[1:43:15] the attribute of his maker in him
[1:43:17] now the fourth letter is called dalith
[1:43:20] that is in hebrew in greek is the letter
[1:43:22] delta
[1:43:23] d in english english we call it d now
[1:43:26] the
[1:43:26] letter d represents weakness it
[1:43:29] represents
[1:43:30] need a needy person a broken mankind who
[1:43:34] is nothing without
[1:43:35] his creator you cannot do nothing of
[1:43:37] yourself
[1:43:38] without the father being with you even
[1:43:41] jesus when he was on
[1:43:42] health he said the sun the flesh
[1:43:45] his human spirit cannot do nothing until
[1:43:47] the holy pill of fire in him does it
[1:43:49] so he said the sun does not do nothing
[1:43:51] of himself but whatsoever the father
[1:43:53] doeth
[1:43:54] likewise the sandwith amen what the
[1:43:57] father shows you in your heart
[1:43:59] the holy ghost shows in your heart that
[1:44:01] is what you manifest in your flesh
[1:44:03] so if the father has ordained you to
[1:44:05] speak into creation
[1:44:07] if the father has ordained you to speak
[1:44:09] things out of creation
[1:44:10] nothing can change that because that is
[1:44:12] what the la the lord the holy ghost in
[1:44:14] you
[1:44:14] is bringing out out of your life amen
[1:44:18] now we want to look at the fifth letter
[1:44:21] the
[1:44:21] letter is wonderful the fifth letter is
[1:44:24] called
[1:44:24] hey it's like h h-e-y or it's
[1:44:28] also spelled h-e-i-o-h-e-l
[1:44:31] it's later means hey look or behold
[1:44:34] and that is the god creative power now
[1:44:37] that letter is the outpouring of the
[1:44:39] holy spirit
[1:44:40] and now without that letter you dwell in
[1:44:44] land of desolation
[1:44:46] and that letter feminizes you like
[1:44:48] abraham abraham and sarah
[1:44:50] were dwelling in the land of the land of
[1:44:52] desolation they were barren
[1:44:53] mana when the letter when the lord added
[1:44:56] hey
[1:44:57] to abraham's name abraham became he was
[1:45:00] abraham sorry he used to be abram
[1:45:02] without he without harm without christ
[1:45:06] in his life he was seen visions but the
[1:45:08] lord hasn't added
[1:45:10] his deity upon abraham so ibrahim was
[1:45:13] barren
[1:45:14] he couldn't have a child his wife was
[1:45:16] barren he was sterile his wife was
[1:45:17] barren however you put it
[1:45:19] but now the lord made an announcement
[1:45:22] it's
[1:45:22] abraham i'm going to feminize you i'm
[1:45:25] going to make you fruitful
[1:45:27] so the letter h which is the fifth
[1:45:29] letter of the hebrew
[1:45:31] feminizes you what is the feminine the
[1:45:33] feminine brings life
[1:45:35] amen without the feminine the man cannot
[1:45:38] bring life
[1:45:39] without his wife the man cannot bring
[1:45:41] life and without you without the land of
[1:45:44] beulah
[1:45:45] jesus christ cannot bring life upon the
[1:45:46] earth
[1:45:48] amen so he add his name hey
[1:45:52] the faith letter which is harm unto you
[1:45:54] so that you become what
[1:45:55] fruitful who prune you to bring bring
[1:45:58] more fruits
[1:45:58] amen then you become the land of bula
[1:46:00] land or blessing
[1:46:02] by adding the letter each or harm
[1:46:05] to your name like sarah like abram
[1:46:08] abraham couldn't manifest nothing of the
[1:46:11] promised son
[1:46:11] there was something in him that he was
[1:46:13] he has a promised son
[1:46:15] and here he was 100 years old his wife
[1:46:17] 90 years old
[1:46:19] way beyond menopause no there was no
[1:46:21] hope there was
[1:46:22] there was a time abraham lawson he said
[1:46:24] lord
[1:46:25] my servant i was born in my house is
[1:46:27] going to be
[1:46:28] my uh my head when i die it's going to
[1:46:30] inherit me and the lord said no
[1:46:33] you your servant your son that will come
[1:46:36] from your loins
[1:46:37] is going to be your inheritance is going
[1:46:39] to inherit you
[1:46:40] but there was nothing to prove the lord
[1:46:43] wanted abraham to know that hey
[1:46:45] abraham you are my son you can speak
[1:46:48] out of nothingness you can speak
[1:46:50] conditions that are way adverse
[1:46:52] you can speak conditions that are
[1:46:54] impossible to man because i am in you
[1:46:56] and so when the lord makisadek came on
[1:46:59] the scene
[1:47:00] and added his name unto abraham abraham
[1:47:03] abraham become
[1:47:04] abraham abram hey behold the beauty
[1:47:08] of abraham abraham has become the
[1:47:11] beautiful land
[1:47:12] with a son isaac glory hallelujah to the
[1:47:15] lord
[1:47:16] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:47:18] christ
[1:47:19] so now the crown the lord has given to
[1:47:22] you
[1:47:23] is the word is the life the lord didn't
[1:47:26] give you a sword to fight
[1:47:27] he didn't give a physical crown like the
[1:47:29] queen of england or like in africa kings
[1:47:31] were gold and diamonds
[1:47:33] he didn't give you a presidential palace
[1:47:35] like the white house
[1:47:37] or russia or birmingham palace in
[1:47:39] england
[1:47:40] but it's giving you more than white
[1:47:42] house it's giving you a tent
[1:47:44] it's giving you a house a beth that is
[1:47:47] the builder land the land
[1:47:48] where blessings are flowing that is the
[1:47:50] holy ghost land
[1:47:52] and what do you do with the land you get
[1:47:54] in tune
[1:47:55] as we read from the prophet redemption
[1:47:57] uh by presentation
[1:47:59] he said get in tune the reason why we
[1:48:01] don't bring those attributes because
[1:48:03] we are not in tune with the lord we are
[1:48:05] way out of tune
[1:48:07] we are out of work so we can manifest it
[1:48:09] but then when we get out so we
[1:48:11] we tune ourselves the holy ghost tune
[1:48:13] yourself into that dimension
[1:48:15] and everything becomes possible things
[1:48:17] just flow normally
[1:48:18] just like a human being you eat and you
[1:48:20] build your body
[1:48:21] you eat and you build your strength you
[1:48:23] eat and you build your body
[1:48:25] so the word is given to you to eat and
[1:48:27] build your body to tune yourself
[1:48:29] into your creator amen if anybody's
[1:48:32] listening is out of tune with the lord
[1:48:34] if you don't know where you are if you
[1:48:36] think your life is just about walk upon
[1:48:37] the earth
[1:48:38] make money live a life of riches
[1:48:42] or a life that you want so called and
[1:48:44] when you die you go away that is not
[1:48:46] what the lord made you for the lord made
[1:48:48] you for a heavenly
[1:48:49] dimensional purposes to be in tune with
[1:48:52] him
[1:48:52] to line your heart to him so that he
[1:48:54] will come and dwell in this heart
[1:48:56] deceit in you will be quickened and take
[1:48:58] over your flesh so that you'll be
[1:49:00] in tune with the celestial dimension
[1:49:03] that when you speak
[1:49:04] it's not the word of a woman it's not a
[1:49:06] word of a man but it's the omnipotent
[1:49:08] speaking into creation and whatever you
[1:49:11] need
[1:49:12] why cry why are you dismayed why are you
[1:49:15] troubled
[1:49:16] why are you wavering why is your face
[1:49:19] shaking
[1:49:20] because of sudden condition remember
[1:49:22] last was it a couple of weeks weeks ago
[1:49:24] the lord allowed the torment he was
[1:49:26] training the disciples
[1:49:28] so he let satan raise atonement
[1:49:32] and the torment was something that was
[1:49:33] going to drown them and kill all of them
[1:49:35] peter was shaken because he wasn't in
[1:49:37] tune and so he woke the lord up lord
[1:49:40] and the lord said why do you why are you
[1:49:41] crying say ye of little faith
[1:49:43] speak and move forward he spoke as a
[1:49:46] demonstration to them
[1:49:47] because the same thing is what they were
[1:49:49] going to do greater works and the lord
[1:49:51] asks you here
[1:49:52] for you to do a greater work it's not
[1:49:54] only one person it's not a one-man
[1:49:55] ministry
[1:49:56] it's not only for ministers it's only
[1:49:58] for the pastor it's not only for the
[1:50:00] deacons
[1:50:00] it's not only for trustees but it's for
[1:50:02] everyone every member of the body of
[1:50:05] christ
[1:50:06] everyone who is in tune with the lord
[1:50:08] everyone
[1:50:09] who has got harm he on his name
[1:50:12] you become a beater you become a beth
[1:50:16] that is a house that the lord dwells in
[1:50:19] a house
[1:50:19] which is their promised land which is
[1:50:21] the land of blessing which is a villa
[1:50:23] land
[1:50:24] full of flowers roses lilies and
[1:50:27] everything else
[1:50:28] amen the water lily when the water lady
[1:50:31] has to go through
[1:50:33] those uh what they call it those air
[1:50:36] soil
[1:50:37] and come up with a beauty it's not it's
[1:50:39] not a punishment
[1:50:41] but those distressing times bring the
[1:50:43] beauty out of the water lily
[1:50:45] and when the water lily emerges it's the
[1:50:48] most beautiful flower
[1:50:49] along the stream along the river the
[1:50:52] same thing what you are going through
[1:50:53] now
[1:50:53] is not the punishment of the lord unto
[1:50:55] you it's not because you have sin
[1:50:57] but because the lord is bringing a
[1:50:58] beauty out of you is moving you into
[1:51:00] another dimension
[1:51:02] you want you to see things beyond what
[1:51:03] you've seen already you want it to come
[1:51:05] a point where
[1:51:06] you don't even have to pray there should
[1:51:07] be a condition that you just
[1:51:09] by your heart and your imagination as
[1:51:11] you imagine
[1:51:12] let it be so let this person be healed
[1:51:14] in your heart
[1:51:15] it breaks in your heart you don't even
[1:51:17] have to pray for him but your heart goes
[1:51:19] because there's something in you that
[1:51:21] direct to brother troy that directed
[1:51:22] sister rebecca and when you direct that
[1:51:24] to him
[1:51:25] it brings whatever they need into
[1:51:28] creation
[1:51:29] amen because we travel by what by
[1:51:32] thought
[1:51:33] we don't travel by reasoning but the
[1:51:36] thought
[1:51:36] is the man of christ eternity
[1:51:39] manifesting in you
[1:51:40] amen you can create whatever you desire
[1:51:43] in your life
[1:51:44] i don't care what you are going through
[1:51:45] satina whatever you need at this hour
[1:51:48] whatever you are praying for whatever
[1:51:50] you call upon the lord for
[1:51:51] is for you nothing can take it from you
[1:51:54] and you speak it
[1:51:55] and stand as a daughter of god like
[1:51:56] military well military people they don't
[1:51:58] military people don't even smile when
[1:51:59] they are in what war front
[1:52:01] they are just standing there like
[1:52:02] military i'm ready to fight
[1:52:04] because they are dead to defeat the
[1:52:05] enemy when they defeat the enemy then
[1:52:08] after they come and have party
[1:52:09] the same thing when you stand as the
[1:52:11] daughter of christ as a son of god
[1:52:13] let everything in you all the faith in
[1:52:15] you comes out
[1:52:16] that's what the lord the lord allows
[1:52:18] adversity so that what is in you will
[1:52:20] come out
[1:52:21] amen like samson here he was he didn't
[1:52:24] have an
[1:52:24] eye remember he had seven locks
[1:52:27] that was what the lord gave it to him
[1:52:29] for his protection whenever he comes
[1:52:31] into problem he
[1:52:32] he can just fill the seven locks woven
[1:52:34] by his mom or bias
[1:52:36] by his sisters and he can rush in the
[1:52:38] anointing of the lord would be upon him
[1:52:39] to destroy the enemies
[1:52:40] here was samson no seven locks saving
[1:52:43] changes are gone
[1:52:45] the eyes of the prophet were gone but
[1:52:47] the intelligence itself
[1:52:49] was a manifestation so samson has to
[1:52:52] come to
[1:52:52] has to be in tune and begin to get in
[1:52:55] tune
[1:52:56] and the head began to grow it wasn't
[1:52:58] woven into seven lost no more no
[1:53:00] it grew as one a leaf the oneness of
[1:53:02] christ
[1:53:03] and samson spoke he said lord i want a
[1:53:06] little revenge here
[1:53:07] i want to destroy my enemies before i
[1:53:10] leave this dimension
[1:53:11] and the bible said moses destroyed more
[1:53:13] enemies
[1:53:14] than he did in all his lifetime
[1:53:17] regardless of your condition
[1:53:18] regardless of what you are going through
[1:53:20] regardless of your challenges
[1:53:22] there's more for you to manifest than
[1:53:24] what you have already manifested
[1:53:26] the lord has more for the church than
[1:53:28] what we have seen already
[1:53:29] the lord has not despised us no the lord
[1:53:32] is bringing us into another dimension
[1:53:34] remember when a jet plane is london i
[1:53:36] was going through the clouds
[1:53:37] there's turbulence and begin to shake
[1:53:40] and people get scared what's going on
[1:53:42] but then they go over the clouds it's
[1:53:44] just like sitting here
[1:53:45] you eat your lunch go to the restroom
[1:53:47] walk around until you get to your
[1:53:49] destination
[1:53:50] the same thing the lord is bringing us
[1:53:51] to another face of the ministry and the
[1:53:53] lord allowed things to happen here and
[1:53:54] there
[1:53:55] it doesn't mean the lord has the lord
[1:53:56] never forsake his people he's still
[1:53:58] leading them amen
[1:53:59] the people of fire that spoke into
[1:54:01] creation that gave their promises here
[1:54:03] that give tongues the symbol of fire is
[1:54:05] in each and every one of the sons of the
[1:54:06] lord
[1:54:07] is now a precious pastor by the jack
[1:54:09] it's in every one of you
[1:54:10] and whatever you desire why cry why
[1:54:14] remember
[1:54:14] why get complain but speak why gossip
[1:54:18] but speak the word in prayer whatever
[1:54:20] way you want to speak it
[1:54:21] if you want to go on your knees do it if
[1:54:23] you want to create in your heart
[1:54:24] do it if you bring it as a thought do it
[1:54:27] because eternity himself
[1:54:28] is living in you but acquaintance a
[1:54:30] tendency is living in every one of sons
[1:54:32] of god
[1:54:33] and when you speak you understand you
[1:54:35] stand as omnipotent standing
[1:54:37] every son and every daughter of god is
[1:54:39] omnipotent amen
[1:54:41] the attribute of your father is in you
[1:54:43] don't let the physical condition dismay
[1:54:45] you no
[1:54:46] it's there for you to bring what is in
[1:54:47] you out amen
[1:54:49] here was jesus people were coming to
[1:54:51] arrest him it wasn't time for him for
[1:54:53] him yet
[1:54:54] what could he do he just by the way
[1:54:57] he spoke he vanished and he appeared
[1:54:59] where he's supposed to appear
[1:55:01] that power is in you you are the rapture
[1:55:04] don't put away god away from you
[1:55:06] the problem we do is we we put the lord
[1:55:08] as we read the prophet said
[1:55:09] we look at him as he's in mass somewhere
[1:55:12] like mass
[1:55:13] way billions and trillions of lives
[1:55:15] peace and i'm way here poor me
[1:55:18] here on earth poco portina portroy
[1:55:21] no it's not that way the same god is
[1:55:24] that if you can tune
[1:55:26] the lord help us to tune our
[1:55:27] supernatural eyes
[1:55:29] see the lord jesus christ in brother
[1:55:30] quentin it doesn't he doesn't have to be
[1:55:32] a giant
[1:55:33] no the lord jesus christ is my sisters
[1:55:35] and my brothers
[1:55:36] and when they speak is heaven speaking
[1:55:40] when they speak creation manifests and
[1:55:43] the lord is moving us politically
[1:55:45] socially economically the world move
[1:55:49] the lord is moving us to that direction
[1:55:51] where we're going to
[1:55:52] speak into creation the third point is
[1:55:54] not in the future
[1:55:56] don't wait to oh i can't wait to the
[1:55:57] third period manifest the third pool has
[1:55:59] always been here since creation
[1:56:02] how did adam come into manifestation by
[1:56:05] the third pool
[1:56:06] the lord didn't take a claim begin to
[1:56:08] weave no adam was in the celestial
[1:56:10] dimension
[1:56:12] and as there was time there was a time
[1:56:13] and moment adam has to come on earth
[1:56:16] the earth gathered around him he didn't
[1:56:18] have to have a mother like you and i
[1:56:20] he just came as a man around 30 years
[1:56:22] old and adam began to walk the lord
[1:56:24] wanted to taste the waters
[1:56:26] few funny doesn't taste waters so the
[1:56:28] holy spirit in him
[1:56:30] with a body with a human spirit a piece
[1:56:32] of him in the human spirit
[1:56:34] a piece of him in the flesh because the
[1:56:36] lord was bringing shadows
[1:56:38] getting closer to the earth and now adam
[1:56:40] comes scoop the waters
[1:56:42] and drink it and said it's beautiful
[1:56:43] it's delicious it is
[1:56:45] good what is the waters it's life
[1:56:48] when the holy ghost comes into you the
[1:56:50] lord tastes you this is my son
[1:56:53] this is my daughter she is me when you
[1:56:55] speak
[1:56:56] it's me speaking when she speaks demons
[1:56:58] bow to her
[1:56:59] when she orders she's the queen of
[1:57:01] heaven who rules in earth
[1:57:03] the earthly uh a clay doesn't define you
[1:57:07] what is on the inside is what defines
[1:57:10] you
[1:57:11] it doesn't matter how much i get sick
[1:57:13] yes we get sick
[1:57:14] yes we can have challenges yes we can
[1:57:16] cry yes we can fall and rise
[1:57:18] it doesn't matter when you fall the
[1:57:19] ground is not for you get up and if you
[1:57:21] can't get up
[1:57:22] call a sister to pick you up call her
[1:57:24] brother to pick you up amen

[1:57:27] i'm going to lay here and die no
[1:57:29] the ground is not for you you've got
[1:57:31] food to walk

[1:57:45] god has you has helped for you amen
[1:57:49] amen the same christ in you is in your
[1:57:51] brothers and sisters
[1:57:52] and when they speak or you speak is
[1:57:54] christ speaking
[1:57:56] it but that troy priests for me is god

[1:58:04] god speaking to me
[1:58:05] if the little ones pray for me god speak
[1:58:06] praying speaking to me
[1:58:08] amen because the deity in them speaking
[1:58:10] into creation
[1:58:11] and it's it's time now is the time of
[1:58:14] tuning
[1:58:15] into that sixth celestial dimension is
[1:58:18] the time of tuning
[1:58:19] don't get so accustomed to the second
[1:58:21] first
[1:58:22] third fourth and the fifth dimension
[1:58:24] let's move over to the sixth and seventh
[1:58:26] dimension
[1:58:27] let's move up over to the promised land
[1:58:29] let's move over to
[1:58:30] tubular land where there's milk and
[1:58:33] honey where you can you can drink all
[1:58:35] you want
[1:58:36] when you've got good fat meat and and
[1:58:38] and vegetables and whatever you want is
[1:58:39] there in abundance
[1:58:41] amen where you can walk and speak where
[1:58:43] your thought
[1:58:44] can bring healing onto people where your
[1:58:46] imagination can bring creation
[1:58:48] where there's peace all around you amen
[1:58:50] because that attribute is in you and i
[1:58:52] you are a son of god you're a daughter
[1:58:54] of god you are a villa land
[1:58:56] you are the very very purpose and the
[1:58:59] motive
[1:59:00] of jesus christ take it enough you are
[1:59:03] the motive
[1:59:04] of jesus christ a man's wife is purpose
[1:59:08] and motive
[1:59:09] in earth because without his wife he
[1:59:11] cannot bring forth himself
[1:59:14] so without you jesus christ will not be
[1:59:16] seen
[1:59:18] so but i'm broken i'm just a broken mess
[1:59:21] there's nothing good about me
[1:59:22] without you jesus christ can be
[1:59:25] manifested
[1:59:26] your brokenness is for him to manifest
[1:59:29] remember the letter d delta dalit in
[1:59:32] hebrew
[1:59:33] is weakly can do nothing he's not
[1:59:36] married
[1:59:37] he said bachelor is a single but when
[1:59:40] the man
[1:59:41] the lord jesus christ the king of heaven
[1:59:44] step on that land
[1:59:45] he said this is my daughter this is
[1:59:47] sister tina my daughter
[1:59:49] this is rebecca my daughter this but i
[1:59:50] trod my son and he stepped in your earth
[1:59:53] what have you become you have become the
[1:59:56] manifestation the motive
[1:59:58] that elohim had way before time will be
[2:00:01] for billions and trillions of years
[2:00:04] you are his motive today you are his
[2:00:06] manifestation
[2:00:08] and when you are walking i know that i
[2:00:09] am the motive of jesus christ what
[2:00:11] contained the man of god
[2:00:14] what demon cancer if the lord want to
[2:00:16] put this little
[2:00:18] tambourine here no i won't allow it no
[2:00:22] you are not fighting your battle there's
[2:00:26] somebody
[2:00:26] way beyond you way beyond your physical
[2:00:29] conditions
[2:00:30] way beyond your problems and you have to
[2:00:33] transfer your problems to him
[2:00:35] that is what david did david give a
[2:00:37] testimony before goliath he has to give
[2:00:39] a testimony
[2:00:40] he went through the first pool he said i
[2:00:41] killed a bird okay
[2:00:43] second pool i kill a lion so when he
[2:00:45] came before goliath
[2:00:47] now he wasn't talking about he didn't
[2:00:48] give out testimony to goliath
[2:00:50] but it transferred the battle to his
[2:00:52] deity
[2:00:53] because goliath was cursing him uh
[2:00:56] through his idols the demons
[2:00:57] because god had a deity he was demons in
[2:01:00] him
[2:01:01] but now david has the lord of hosts
[2:01:03] elohim
[2:01:04] the name of jesus christ written in his
[2:01:07] heart and so
[2:01:08] david little david was just about maybe
[2:01:10] 18 years old
[2:01:12] he was looking at goliath he was
[2:01:13] charging himself he was tuning himself
[2:01:16] he said i'm going to kill you and give
[2:01:18] your body to the best of heaven and go
[2:01:20] let doesn't say the same as
[2:01:21] you you little young man you want to
[2:01:23] come and fight me you are joking you
[2:01:25] want to
[2:01:25] you want to risk your life on earth i'm
[2:01:27] going to murder you begin to case him in
[2:01:28] the gospel of
[2:01:29] philistines and the gospel of demons of
[2:01:31] akron so the battle
[2:01:33] was changed from flesh into the
[2:01:34] celestial spiritual battle
[2:01:36] and the pillar of fire just moved david
[2:01:40] to pick five smooth stones j-e-s-u-s-u-s
[2:01:44] f-a-i-t faith jesus grace grace
[2:01:48] and all another attribute and begin to
[2:01:50] hold them tuning himself
[2:01:53] tuning his slingshot and he threw the
[2:01:55] first one straight
[2:01:57] hit goliath on the head it was it wasn't
[2:02:00] david
[2:02:01] david was just an instrument it was a
[2:02:03] six dimension become
[2:02:04] bit you become one with god so you've
[2:02:07] got two
[2:02:08] and one you are not alone the lord is in
[2:02:11] you
[2:02:11] and when you can tune yourself switch
[2:02:13] yourself yes you can act as a human
[2:02:15] being
[2:02:15] as a human you can sleep go to work do
[2:02:17] whatever you do as a human being
[2:02:18] but always get in tune with the other
[2:02:21] man in you
[2:02:22] that when the situation arise you just
[2:02:24] jump aside transfer to him
[2:02:26] and let him take over let him anoint
[2:02:28] your flesh let me announce your brother
[2:02:30] let me know your pastor your word let
[2:02:32] one not your sisters
[2:02:33] and your brothers and you see heavens
[2:02:36] who reign in your life god bless you
[2:02:52] we are not defeated people we are
[2:02:55] eternal people
[2:02:56] a man you are being you are christ
[2:03:00] and it's high time we let christ
[2:03:03] manifest
[2:03:04] by tuning to that celestial dimension
[2:03:08] let the natural spiritual as we tune
[2:03:11] radios we tune computers we give
[2:03:13] frequencies
[2:03:14] to bring certain things that we desire
[2:03:16] let's tune into him more go into the
[2:03:18] inner man
[2:03:19] don't let the noise of the world
[2:03:22] political anoints
[2:03:23] ecclesiastical noise religious noise by
[2:03:26] tuning to christ
[2:03:28] tune into the ministry the lord has
[2:03:29] given to you come to church hear the
[2:03:31] word
[2:03:32] pray read your word read the message
[2:03:35] because that's the way to tune into him
[2:03:37] let him say one thing i'm close

[2:03:42] you one key take one day

[2:09:13] eternal life
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:16] fellowship with god and dominion
[2:09:22] and the redemption is supposed to bring
[2:09:24] back
[2:09:25] eternal life fellowship with god
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:30] and dominion
[2:09:34] everybody just usually look for eternal
[2:09:36] life but it's
[2:09:37] also supposed to bring back divine
[2:09:40] fellowship it's
[2:09:43] also bring back where we where adam
[2:09:46] stood in a place of dominion
[2:09:49] before the fall
[2:09:52] and when you receive the baptism of the
[2:09:54] holy ghost
[2:09:57] you receive your eternal life
[2:10:01] fellowship with god and dominion
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:07] amen amen amen your beulah land
[2:10:12] amen what a wonderful wonderful
[2:10:15] scripture just tune in
[2:10:17] my god tune in
[2:10:21] i was reading just this week in that
[2:10:24] very
[2:10:24] same message fellowship by redemption
[2:10:29] and in there the prophet was talking
[2:10:30] about say true fellowship is when
[2:10:33] your thoughts and god thoughts
[2:10:37] become one
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:41] when you can just get to a place he was
[2:10:43] talking about there
[2:10:44] get find a time where you can disconnect
[2:10:48] from the fourth and fifth dimension
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:53] get away from um the cell phone
[2:10:57] get away from uh uh radio
[2:11:01] and television and all these other
[2:11:03] distractions
[2:11:05] news programs get away from that to find
[2:11:10] the time to tune
[2:11:11] out and tune in
[2:11:17] nothing but the word of god and prayer
[2:11:20] and allow your thoughts to become one
[2:11:22] with his thoughts
[2:11:24] good god almighty
[2:11:27] whoo that's powerful
[2:11:32] absolutely powerful then you get your
[2:11:36] place to appoint the prophet preached a
[2:11:38] message
[2:11:39] led by the spirit he asked a question
[2:11:44] he was talking about how the time when
[2:11:45] he had to go to the hotel and
[2:11:47] he went on the walk and met the the old
[2:11:49] lady the
[2:11:50] the the the lady there and the son you
[2:11:53] know the story
[2:11:54] that was uh a secret of venereal disease
[2:11:58] but he had asked a question he said has
[2:12:00] any of you ever been led by the spirit
[2:12:03] [Music]
[2:12:05] he said remember that time when you were
[2:12:07] sitting there under the anointing and
[2:12:09] something was pulling on your heart to
[2:12:11] go to the altar
[2:12:13] and you got up and you obeyed that
[2:12:15] spirit
[2:12:17] you were being led by the spirit
[2:12:21] the very fact that you come here today
[2:12:23] to hear the word of the lord
[2:12:25] you were being led by the spirit
[2:12:30] so when anything that we do we got to
[2:12:31] get into the spirit of the thing you go
[2:12:33] to a football game a basketball game
[2:12:35] what do you do you get into the spirit
[2:12:37] of the uh the event that's taking place
[2:12:41] if they say raise your hand to the left
[2:12:43] you wear your hand to the left
[2:12:45] they say go to the right you you go to
[2:12:47] the right
[2:12:48] you you get into the spirit and you do
[2:12:51] what they say
[2:12:53] and you scream and you and you have a
[2:12:56] wonderful
[2:12:57] time so in order to tune in you have to
[2:13:02] first get into the spirit
[2:13:06] allow yourself to disconnect from
[2:13:08] whatever
[2:13:09] see people go out and they go out to
[2:13:11] these clubs and parties and different
[2:13:12] things
[2:13:13] what they do they disconnect from their
[2:13:16] regular life and just want to go say
[2:13:18] i want to go have a big fun so i'm going
[2:13:21] to disconnect from my other
[2:13:22] responsibilities
[2:13:24] and all of these kind of things that got
[2:13:25] me bogged down i'm going to go home
[2:13:27] and just kind of let my hair down and
[2:13:30] get into the spirit
[2:13:32] but we don't want to get into a worldly
[2:13:34] spirit we want to get into the heavenly
[2:13:37] spirit
[2:13:38] so we disconnect from the world and go
[2:13:41] into a secret place
[2:13:44] amen and let our thoughts
[2:13:48] become in line with god's thoughts so
[2:13:50] how do we tune in
[2:13:53] when you do that
[2:13:56] and god began to speak to your spirit
[2:13:59] and the brother said you go in to take
[2:14:01] your bible and you begin to read a
[2:14:03] little scripture or something that god
[2:14:04] began to deal with you there in private
[2:14:08] and then you come to church
[2:14:11] and god speaking from the pulpit now
[2:14:13] you're in tune
[2:14:15] because see to be in tune it takes two
[2:14:17] things
[2:14:18] coming in line tuning up
[2:14:22] perfectly and see if you never try to
[2:14:24] get yourself into that place on the
[2:14:26] other side
[2:14:27] here you just got this floating ball by
[2:14:29] itself
[2:14:30] there's nothing to line it up with
[2:14:32] [Music]
[2:14:34] that's why it's important on your own
[2:14:37] and in your own time
[2:14:41] going in with god he speaks to you
[2:14:46] shows you things and then from the
[2:14:49] pulpit the minister speaks and it lines
[2:14:51] right up now you know you in tune with
[2:14:53] god
[2:14:55] [Music]
[2:14:57] now it becomes a revelation
[2:15:01] now it becomes a revelation spend time
[2:15:04] with god
[2:15:06] get away from your own thoughts worldly
[2:15:10] thoughts
[2:15:12] from that other dimension
[2:15:17] amen and let's tune in like the brothers
[2:15:19] say let's
[2:15:20] tune in to this sixth and seventh
[2:15:22] dimension
[2:15:24] amen the lord is so good hey
[2:15:27] amen amen the lord is just wonderful hey
[2:15:30] man let's say one more course of that
[2:15:32] song as we prepare to leave
[2:15:36] [Music]

[2:18:16] the current of the holy ghost lord
[2:18:18] up into the heavenlies and lord the
[2:18:22] closer the further away we get from the
[2:18:24] world
[2:18:26] into you lord god the clearer we see
[2:18:30] the clearer our eyes of understanding
[2:18:32] become open

[2:18:48] this world lord god
[2:18:51] so far above that that that that cares
[2:18:54] that if life no longer even affect us
[2:18:59] politics no longer even affect us
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:03] for we are uh uh uh feasting in heavenly
[2:19:06] places
[2:19:09] we're looking lord god to the word of
[2:19:13] god and the promises of god
[2:19:16] to a better land a better place
[2:19:21] in another dimension
[2:19:25] we look beyond this dimension lord god
[2:19:27] we don't live in this dimension we're
[2:19:29] all of this mission but our minds hearts
[2:19:31] and everything is
[2:19:32] already left
[2:19:36] as a red wizard we're potentially in the
[2:19:39] resurrection right now we're being
[2:19:41] resurrected lord
[2:19:49] god if there's any that may be listening
[2:19:56] that need to know this salvation
[2:19:58] [Music]
