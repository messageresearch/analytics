[44:17] brother Vaughn we we come from Lorain
[44:21] Ohio that's on the North Shore there
[44:25] Lake Erie I was born and raised in a
[44:27] while my parents are cool and they moved
[44:31] there in 1948 I was born there a few
[44:33] years later and my wife also was born in
[44:37] Lorain Ohio in the same hospital I was
[44:40] born in one day apart
[44:44] I was first so I told her I said you
[44:50] know I was there one day I was waiting
[44:52] on you when you got there and I said
[44:55] that means you got to respect me and 17
[45:02] years later we met you know in a ball
[45:04] park somewhere and the day after I met
[45:07] her at tolls gonna marry her all right
[45:09] just 17 years old of course she said
[45:11] you're crazy
[45:12] she said you scared me to death I just
[45:15] met you yesterday no worries ain't gonna
[45:17] marry me I said well she said I don't
[45:20] love you I said well that don't mean
[45:22] nothin I'm gonna love you so much you're
[45:25] gonna end up loving me and that's what I
[45:29] did see ya now the day I met her now I
[45:33] for the young people here you you
[45:36] learned from this right I would I was
[45:38] just a Catholic boy I didn't know nothin
[45:40] about Christianity I'd never read the
[45:42] Bible or nothin like that but when I
[45:45] went to that park and she turned around
[45:47] and said a load of me my brother had
[45:49] arranged our meeting and when she Terron
[45:52] looked at me somethin spoke to me and
[45:55] said ditch there's your wife now I know
[45:58] I heard that voice I didn't I didn't
[46:00] know it was God but it was gone all
[46:01] right you know what I did I believed it
[46:04] even though I didn't know her I believed
[46:07] it and um the next day I told her I was
[46:09] gonna marry her and took her to meet my
[46:10] mom and dad and and two and a half years
[46:13] later we got married I was offered a
[46:16] scholarship right out of high school
[46:19] just before I got out of high school I
[46:21] was offered a scholarship to the best
[46:23] engineering school in America that's
[46:25] called General Motors Institute of
[46:26] Engineering I had taken the test for an
[46:30] apprenticeship with General Motors and I
[46:32] did so well they offered me a
[46:34] scholarship all expenses paid for five
[46:36] years and I come home and I said well
[46:39] let me think about it sir I went home
[46:42] and I told my parents my dad cried he
[46:44] was so happy and my brother my oldest
[46:46] brother
[46:47] and everybody was so happy for me and I
[46:49] told my wife and my girlfriend at that
[46:52] time and she said I think it's a great
[46:54] idea but I saw something when she said
[46:56] that I saw she was trying to get rid of
[46:59] me I could see that her you know good
[47:04] riddance you know I hadn't convinced her
[47:06] yet and and so I thought about it and
[47:10] the starting pay for a graduate engineer
[47:14] at that time was somewhere around
[47:15] $80,000 a year and after for your
[47:21] furniture program I taught to be making
[47:23] about $40,000 a year so I went back to
[47:26] that interview again two weeks later he
[47:28] called me in and I went in he said what
[47:30] are you gonna do young man I said well I
[47:31] decided I'm going to I offer the
[47:35] partnership he's gonna turn down that
[47:37] that engineering scholarship I said yes
[47:41] sir he said why I said because there's a
[47:43] little girl I want to marry and she said
[47:47] you're going to turn down a free
[47:49] education five years engineering degree
[47:53] for a girl for a woman I said what is
[47:56] that just not any woman as to what I'm
[47:58] supposed to marry and she had told me
[48:01] well if you go up there and I'm going to
[48:03] Kent State University that we have to go
[48:05] our separate ways because I can't
[48:07] promise to be a faithful to you you know
[48:09] so I said sir I said I'm gonna turn that
[48:14] down he said you'd be able to think
[48:17] about it twice you know because you
[48:19] could you're gonna make twice as much
[48:20] money as a graduate engineer and I told
[48:24] him I said sir
[48:25] I've thought about that for two weeks I
[48:27] said I've come to the conclusion I'd
[48:29] rather be poor that be married to the
[48:31] right girl then to be rich married to
[48:34] the wrong one
[48:38] now you know that come from God right
[48:40] because that was just a stupid little
[48:42] Catholic boys all it was but it was God
[48:45] just leaving me right and 25 years later
[48:48] I met that man I was leaving for New
[48:50] York City to Pastor and I was working
[48:53] inside his machine and he happened to
[48:55] come by I hadn't seen him in 25 years
[48:56] his name was Bill Chacho and he saw me
[49:00] and he called to me said Yvonne Yvonne I
[49:02] haven't seen you years he said what
[49:04] about that girl you still married that
[49:05] girl I said I sure AM
[49:06] he said were you ever sorry that you
[49:09] turned down that scholarship I said no
[49:11] sir
[49:12] best decision I ever made outside of
[49:15] serving Christ and so here we are this
[49:18] next week I think it's well they would
[49:21] that be on Tuesday we celebrate 42 years
[49:25] of marriage and the best part of the
[49:32] story is she want me to Christ so far I
[49:36] married the wrong woman I wouldn't be a
[49:37] Christian today which her example led me
[49:41] to Jesus Christ and to this message and
[49:43] uh
[49:43] and she's been with me all these years
[49:45] and as I'd always tell everybody the
[49:48] little success I've had in the Bronx
[49:50] they're never rough neighborhood were in
[49:53] the little success we've had I owe to my
[49:55] wife I believe the people love her and
[49:58] they just put up with me they love her
[50:01] so much
[50:02] she always says no that's not true but
[50:04] it's true her example has given me the
[50:07] accessible success we've had in the
[50:10] church there in our little church so
[50:12] we've been together for 28 years now
[50:13] I've been pastoring 20 years I spent
[50:16] eight years traveling back and forth
[50:17] from Ohio to New York City to establish
[50:20] the church and finally God gave me
[50:22] permission to quit my job in 1998 and
[50:25] and moved to New York City and started
[50:27] pastoring so we've been together all
[50:28] these years God's done miracles for us
[50:31] we've got a good unity in the church
[50:34] good spirit in the church I heard you're
[50:36] worshiping and that's always a real
[50:39] thrill to me to hear a message church to
[50:42] worshiping God I believe that the spirit
[50:45] of worship is the spirit of victory
[50:48] people that don't have victory don't
[50:50] worship but if you've got victory you
[50:52] worship you got something out about
[50:56] and man you don't have to have anybody
[50:57] encourage you to do it they just come
[50:59] out of here amen and I believe I believe
[51:03] victory comes through the world right
[51:05] and as we preach the word to you and you
[51:09] can see what Christ did for you it will
[51:11] produce a spirit of victory and worship
[51:13] in the church I was preaching the
[51:16] brother stage last Wednesday and Real
[51:20] Estate's is my good friend and there was
[51:22] a young man there after the service he
[51:23] can murder we said well Yvonne I I was
[51:25] in your church five years ago I don't
[51:27] remember him being there he said but I
[51:29] never forgot he says I I was watching
[51:32] you preach there and you were preaching
[51:33] real hard and and suddenly I put my head
[51:35] down to pray for just a second when I
[51:37] looked up you were up on top of the
[51:38] pulpit you were standing on the pulpit
[51:41] brother Vaughn I remember that day and I
[51:44] said yeah brother I remember doing that
[51:46] I was preaching about Israel going into
[51:49] battle right against the Philistines and
[51:51] I said in and God told them I don't want
[51:54] you to take a sword I don't want you to
[51:56] take any weapons I want you to go down
[51:58] into that Valley into battle and I want
[52:01] your weapon to be praised
[52:04] I will fight your battle but you let her
[52:07] worship me first you gotta you gotta
[52:10] step out of faith and believe that the
[52:12] victory is yours I'm gonna give it to
[52:14] you
[52:14] so I jumped up on top of the pulpit and
[52:16] I said now I can just see the
[52:18] Philistines looking down in the valley
[52:20] and seeing this army walk out there with
[52:22] not a sword with no weapons whatsoever
[52:25] no shield but their weapons breaking
[52:29] hallelujah and say these people were
[52:31] crazy but they didn't know that that was
[52:33] their weapon yeah you know what I jumped
[52:36] down off the pulpit that was about maybe
[52:38] fifty five years old back there was a
[52:40] miracle I could get up there but God
[52:42] pulled me up there and I jumped down off
[52:43] the pulpit I told her translator you
[52:45] follow me and I took off running down
[52:48] the middle while off the back door of
[52:49] the church and as I ran out that back
[52:51] door everybody followed me out with a
[52:53] jacket we marched all the way down to
[52:55] the corner turned down there at the bull
[52:57] Vague a little little corner store and
[52:59] came back and next to you we had about
[53:01] four or five sinners in the parade
[53:04] people off the street just got in the
[53:06] guy got involved and we made about three
[53:09] circles on the street inside the church
[53:11] and back out again and we just had a
[53:12] glorious time a real Jericho March amen
[53:17] the Philistines got to die they're gonna
[53:20] be defeated but you've got to have a
[53:22] vision of what Christ has done for you
[53:25] so you know we don't fight with carnal
[53:28] weapons we fight with spiritual
[53:30] revelations about what Christ did for us
[53:33] amen so I believe in worship I I'm not
[53:37] that one of those old Europeans brother
[53:39] BAM talked about amen that's what he
[53:42] said white people don't like to hear
[53:44] that but that's the truth
[53:46] that's it that's the truth I believe we
[53:50] get up in heavenly places in Christ
[53:51] you'll see our victory and we'll live
[53:54] our victory amen day nothing that
[53:57] happens to you that's not ordained for
[54:00] eternal life you've got something to
[54:02] learn in this life God's gonna have you
[54:04] go through a tribulation but it's gonna
[54:06] work for your good yeah and for an
[54:08] eternal purpose everything that's
[54:10] happening your life is for an eternal
[54:12] purpose I really believe that let me
[54:16] tell you brother I've been through some
[54:17] battles I've had these false prophets

[56:36] the armies of the Living God
[56:38] so we've been through some battles let
[56:41] me tell you brothers sister New York
[56:43] City is a tough place to preach the
[56:44] gospel but there there's a people there
[56:47] in my church brother yeah and I think
[56:51] thought for the finest people in shoe
[56:55] leather or the venom talked about right
[56:57] he says that and those people serve the
[56:59] Lord in this message in holiness and
[57:02] they love this message and they they go
[57:04] to church and they fight the traffic and
[57:06] pay the tolls and do all this stuff I
[57:08] told the church this is my revelation
[57:10] there's a special recompense for people
[57:12] that serve the Lord correctly in the
[57:14] message in New York City there's
[57:18] something that's before you waiting on
[57:19] how many of you have to pay sixteen
[57:22] dollars across the bridge to come to
[57:24] church one way sometimes in our name you
[57:31] know I live 12 miles from church and
[57:33] it's taken me two hours to get to church
[57:35] because somebody got a flat tire on that
[57:38] bridge
[57:40] and with Noah that whenever the Yankees
[57:42] are playing it takes us two hours to get
[57:44] to church and people are still there
[57:46] they still arrive and they love the Lord
[57:49] and then they gotta catch a train and
[57:51] get home at one o'clock in the morning
[57:53] you know because they went to church on
[57:55] Wednesday night I love the people for
[57:59] that I love I see they love the Lord
[58:05] every Church has their trial you know
[58:08] you live in a paradise here that's the
[58:13] truth the rats in New York City like
[58:17] people now I'm gonna tell you something
[58:19] this is the truth I was a man have one
[58:22] night we went to visit somebody into
[58:24] prison and we were coming home he was 12
[58:26] o'clock at night and I stopped waiting
[58:28] down the lower Manhattan I stopped my
[58:29] car to light and there was a rat
[58:31] standing on the corner waiting for the
[58:33] light to turn green not a joke and
[58:36] that's the truth I saw this rattle with
[58:39] a great big ol rat and I stopped the car
[58:41] and when the light turned green he
[58:42] walked out us apart
[58:46] I mean how many of you seen that in West
[58:48] Palm Beach I'm not joking this is the
[58:54] truth few people live in paradise none
[58:59] of you had any reason to complain
[59:01] whatsoever thank god you're here in West
[59:04] Palm Beach amen I'm sure you got two
[59:08] trials
[59:09] tourists or a trial I know that all the
[59:13] sin on the beaches and all that stuff I
[59:15] I know what you're dealing with here
[59:17] also everybody's got their trials right
[59:19] but God has anointed you to serve God
[59:23] here yeah and he's anointed a pastor
[59:26] he's given him a certain kind of
[59:27] personality for your congregation and
[59:30] all this carnal comparisons that people
[59:33] doing nowadays
[59:33] I told brother Jack the other day I said
[59:36] you know was it brother Jack oh maybe
[59:38] yeah I think it was brother Jack I told
[59:40] him I said you know it's become
[59:41] fashionable for preachers to preach for
[59:43] four hours it's the new fashion trend in
[59:48] the message where are the people out
[59:51] don't think about the children you know
[59:53] they have their breakfast at eight
[59:55] o'clock in the morning they go to church
[59:56] and then they're listening to a preacher
[59:58] preach for four hours and they don't get
[1:00:00] out of church till three o'clock in the
[1:00:01] afternoon no concern about that child
[1:00:04] eating his lunch all that stuff's going
[1:00:07] on see because somebody wants to tell
[1:00:10] everybody what all they know
[1:00:14] will you go ahead and tell everybody I
[1:00:16] said that it's okay I don't matter it's
[1:00:19] the truth
[1:00:21] you know I tell people in New York City
[1:00:22] everybody that didn't like what I said
[1:00:24] raise your hands I can repeat it
[1:00:31] that's exactly right we're here to step
[1:00:34] on your toes the pastor's job is to
[1:00:38] comfort the afflicted and afflict it
[1:00:40] comfortable should I repeat that again a
[1:00:46] pastor's job is to afflict are to
[1:00:51] comfort the afflicted and to afflict the
[1:00:53] comfortable I hope the time I hope I'm
[1:01:01] not getting to coming across you hard
[1:01:04] I don't like being too religious my John
[1:01:10] the Baptist wasn't too religious brother
[1:01:12] bear I wasn't too religious
[1:01:14] we just who we are that's all God made
[1:01:18] me who I am and I can't be nothing but
[1:01:20] what I am and I gave I'm a preach to you
[1:01:23] I can't possibly be successful trying to
[1:01:27] be brother Jack trying to be somebody
[1:01:30] else
[1:01:30] see I've heard people preaching and I
[1:01:33] think they got the spirit of William
[1:01:34] Branham all right they have to preach
[1:01:38] just like them and say all the things
[1:01:40] but the Benham said and they think
[1:01:42] somehow that that's gonna bring the
[1:01:43] anointing just be who you are you can't
[1:01:49] add one cubit your stature just be who
[1:01:52] you are so I want to preach a little bit
[1:01:55] about that today if I can get you to
[1:01:58] stand we'll read a verse of scripture
[1:01:59] about you begin 1st Samuel the tenth
[1:02:02] chapter I want to preach a message here
[1:02:09] I just keep the Lord gave it to me this
[1:02:10] morning I I have preached parts of this
[1:02:12] in different places but I'm gonna preach
[1:02:15] it a little bit differently today in
[1:02:16] your church I had it in my heart to to
[1:02:20] preach a sermon I actually ministered it
[1:02:24] over at brothers Stacey's the other day
[1:02:26] on the order of the voluntary sacrifice
[1:02:30] in the Book of Leviticus but the Lord
[1:02:33] changed my mind this morning and wanted
[1:02:36] me to preach this this title anointed to
[1:02:39] lead
[1:02:41] the title is called anointed to leap
[1:02:43] first samuel chapter 10
[1:02:46] now then samuel took a vial of oil and
[1:02:50] poured upon his head and kissed him and
[1:02:52] said is it not because the lord hath
[1:02:55] anointed thee to be captain over his
[1:02:57] inheritance now watch when thou are
[1:03:00] departed from me today now this is
[1:03:03] prophetic utterance the Prophet is is
[1:03:07] prophesying about what's going to happen
[1:03:09] to Saul and now watch whenever a prophet
[1:03:13] has a message and he has perfect
[1:03:15] utterance there's an anointing that goes
[1:03:18] with that so you can be anointed by the
[1:03:22] voice of a prophet saw was about to be
[1:03:27] anointed by the voice of a prophet to
[1:03:30] become a leader so there are people in
[1:03:33] the message that have been anointed by
[1:03:35] the voice of the Prophet and it makes
[1:03:38] them a leader in the church now watch
[1:03:40] when our departed from me today then
[1:03:43] thou shall find two men by Rachel suffer
[1:03:46] cur in the border of Benjamin edges
[1:03:49] celsa and they will say unto thee they
[1:03:52] asses
[1:03:53] which now what does the seeker found and
[1:03:55] lowlife father had left the care of the
[1:03:57] asses and sorry for you saying what
[1:04:00] should I do for my son then shalt thou
[1:04:03] go on forward from thence and thou shalt
[1:04:05] come to the plaintive Tabar and there
[1:04:08] shall meet the three men going up to God
[1:04:11] without one caring three kids and
[1:04:14] another carrying three loaves of bread
[1:04:16] and another carrying a bottle of wine
[1:04:19] and they will salute thee
[1:04:22] the two loaves of bread which thou shalt
[1:04:25] receive of their hands let's bow our
[1:04:29] heads to pray father we ask your
[1:04:32] blessings Lord give us God a word for
[1:04:35] the people and you know Lord the things
[1:04:37] that we've shared already large and all
[1:04:39] these things are true and as always
[1:04:42] father we judge ourselves and we look to
[1:04:44] see if we have another motive in our
[1:04:46] heart other than motive to be able to
[1:04:49] encourage the people to somehow show
[1:04:52] them O Lord the battle that were all
[1:04:54] engaged in oh god by experience and but
[1:04:57] father if there's anything wicked at my
[1:04:59] heart Lord that would want me to receive
[1:05:02] any kind of glory through these
[1:05:03] testimonies please forgive me Lord this
[1:05:05] it's not what I desire you the judge the
[1:05:08] hearts of men father let the beginning
[1:05:11] of this service O God be pleasing unto
[1:05:13] thee and everything we say and do let it
[1:05:15] be pleasing and let it be that will for
[1:05:18] we ask it in Jesus name Amen you may be
[1:05:20] seated
[1:05:21] so let's go quickly to first set fuel
[1:05:25] 16:13 I think it's 16 iam 4 Samuel 15 16
[1:05:33] and verse 13 for Samuel 16 and verse 13
[1:05:41] then Samuel took the Horn of wall and
[1:05:45] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:05:46] brethren and the Spirit Lord came upon
[1:05:49] thee and David from that day forward so
[1:05:53] samuel rose up and went to Rhema now
[1:05:57] watch these two men they both been
[1:06:01] anointed to leave now I found something
[1:06:05] in the message two years ago that kind
[1:06:07] of inspired me to start studying this
[1:06:11] subject and it was the fact that
[1:06:13] whenever brother Branham speaks of
[1:06:15] Calvary he always follows it with
[1:06:18] Pentecost Wow
[1:06:19] now you I have just one or two coats
[1:06:22] here but I think there's 40 some quotes
[1:06:24] in the message were brother Branham will
[1:06:26] speak about Calvary and then speak about
[1:06:29] the life of that sacrifice coming down
[1:06:31] on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:33] so he says here in the message in the
[1:06:35] ever-present water from the rock but the
[1:06:38] band says if everything's just not right
[1:06:42] yo you'll leave and you'll say we'll
[1:06:44] join the Baptist and then the Baptist
[1:06:47] don't treat us right we'll go to the
[1:06:49] Presbyterian or somewhere else let's go
[1:06:52] back to Calvary and get the real stock
[1:06:55] of the Holy Ghost in us then you'll know
[1:06:58] where you stand then he then he preaches
[1:07:03] an another message behold a greater than
[1:07:07] Solomon is here and he says the other
[1:07:12] president water from the rock is right
[1:07:14] here now that ever-present water from
[1:07:17] that smitten Rock at Calvary when the
[1:07:21] Holy Ghost came out of him on Calvary
[1:07:23] that come back on the church on the day
[1:07:26] of Pentecost the same Holy Ghost is
[1:07:29] present now he says here 1,900 years ago
[1:07:34] on Calvary he troubled waters all right
[1:07:37] talking about the angel trouble in the
[1:07:39] waters behold a greater than Solomon is
[1:07:42] here he says and on that day of
[1:07:44] Pentecost it really shook the thing up
[1:07:47] so the waters were troubled at Calvary
[1:07:51] and he said but when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:07:53] on the church it really shook the thing
[1:07:56] up it really got trouble then all you
[1:07:59] have to do now is step right into the
[1:08:01] waters of the Spirit so we see another
[1:08:04] message he says I think this 42 quotes
[1:08:08] he he says over and over again
[1:08:11] he tied Pentecost to Calvary now he said
[1:08:14] you can't get the first base unless you
[1:08:16] get to Calvary first you can't get the
[1:08:19] Holy Ghost and you until you have a
[1:08:21] revelation of true justification alright
[1:08:24] and the blood that was spilled you're
[1:08:26] bringing sanctification and then the
[1:08:28] true baptism of the Holy Ghost so we
[1:08:31] find in the message of the hour so few
[1:08:33] people are receiving the genuine baptism
[1:08:36] of the Holy Ghost and I believe it's
[1:08:38] because we VV
[1:08:39] from the gospel pattern we have to stay
[1:08:43] with the gospel pattern yeah and maybe
[1:08:46] I'll repeat this you have been repeating
[1:08:47] it everywhere I go
[1:08:48] that the message of the hour is the
[1:08:50] inspiration for the scripture all right
[1:08:53] God anoints a message for that day for
[1:08:57] the age and the inspiration of that
[1:08:59] message is what takes us deeper into the
[1:09:02] scripture but ultimately the purpose and
[1:09:05] the motive and the aim is the scripture
[1:09:08] now I was preaching in Mexico City here
[1:09:11] a couple years ago and the Lord gave me
[1:09:12] a little something I'll share with you I
[1:09:14] said I was trying to there's simple
[1:09:16] people right I'm I'm trying to get them
[1:09:18] to understand the importance of the
[1:09:19] message but the real objective of the
[1:09:22] scriptures to take us back to the word
[1:09:24] right amen so I said the message is like
[1:09:28] a diving board come on when I was a kid
[1:09:32] in high school I try to always impressed
[1:09:34] my wife with my diving skills I was
[1:09:36] really good at it
[1:09:37] all right and I learned to walk out on
[1:09:40] the end of that diving board see and
[1:09:42] there was a power in the diving board
[1:09:44] yeah and I learned how to just step into
[1:09:48] that power all right you understand I
[1:09:52] learned how to throw my body and my
[1:09:54] faith into that into that board I never
[1:09:58] thought the board would break
[1:10:01] if I thought the what border break I
[1:10:04] would have taken the step of faith but
[1:10:06] it was always in my heart I could trust
[1:10:08] this board hallelujah so I step out
[1:10:13] there and I'd hit that board just right
[1:10:14] and I should wake up in the air until
[1:10:16] they have a lease but the purpose was
[1:10:19] nothing not so much how high I can get
[1:10:22] but how deep I can get god bless you see
[1:10:31] so the message came to take you up into
[1:10:33] the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and then
[1:10:36] shoot you down deep into the scripture
[1:10:40] what we're finding in the message is the
[1:10:43] preachers get on the inner into that
[1:10:44] board they say God send a prophet God
[1:10:47] send a prophet God sent a prophet gods
[1:10:49] but they're never going to the scripture
[1:10:52] [Applause]
[1:10:56] this is not the day for us to be saying
[1:10:59] God sent a prophet
[1:11:00] there was a time maybe 30 years where
[1:11:04] the message was going out and finished
[1:11:06] he was preaching about God sent but
[1:11:10] that's we're not living in that day
[1:11:11] anymore we're living in the days of the
[1:11:14] faith for the rapture and I told my
[1:11:18] church I hope you don't mind me saying
[1:11:20] this brother I told my church the
[1:11:22] brother brand said rapturing faith was
[1:11:24] founded on seven thunders all right and
[1:11:26] the seven thunders is a personal
[1:11:28] revelation of the scripture it's the
[1:11:31] depths of the word amen it's not
[1:11:34] something that some preacher has a
[1:11:36] franchise on I like to say it this way
[1:11:43] the seven thunders are in you
[1:11:48] Paul the Apostle said you are complete
[1:11:52] hitting him everything you need for the
[1:11:55] rapture is already inside of you
[1:11:59] but God needs to reveal it to you
[1:12:03] God has to show you what he placed in
[1:12:06] you I'm gonna give you the seal of the
[1:12:08] Holy Spirit
[1:12:09] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:12:12] you that's gonna produce a faithful the
[1:12:16] rapture it's already in you do is
[1:12:20] getting up in the presence of God take
[1:12:23] this message and let that approach you
[1:12:26] in the air and take you into the depth
[1:12:29] of the word rapture in faith comes from
[1:12:32] this Bible you don't have a cross here
[1:12:38] but my church wherever there you are god
[1:12:40] bless you brother listen but I got some
[1:12:42] coochie from the message I'm gonna just
[1:12:45] kind of show to you this way when Jesus
[1:12:47] died in the cross brother Jack it was an
[1:12:50] ink that came down and sanctified the
[1:12:53] earth all right
[1:12:55] he was blood features are preaching when
[1:13:02] you listen to the tape well you read a
[1:13:05] book you're applying the token oh that's
[1:13:10] not what the Prophet honors
[1:13:13] you apply the blood to the lintel of the
[1:13:16] door you don't apply to ink
[1:13:19] I took a tape one day my church
[1:13:23] I took a message tape let me just this
[1:13:25] is a message tape right
[1:13:26] I put it on top of the pulpit I said
[1:13:28] they're saying that this tape right here
[1:13:30] is the voice of God for this age I said
[1:13:33] I'm going to show you it's not I took a
[1:13:35] hammer out and I went whack and I
[1:13:38] destroyed that message table I said I
[1:13:40] destroyed I just destroyed the voice of
[1:13:43] God let me change them the voice of God
[1:13:47] is the Holy Ghost yeah it always has
[1:13:49] been
[1:13:51] you can destroy all the message tapes
[1:13:54] and people still get the revelation
[1:13:58] because the revelation is inside of you
[1:14:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:14:03] you see else getting all twisted brother
[1:14:05] ah ah they're taking you away from
[1:14:07] Pentecost you need a Pentecostal
[1:14:12] experience and in order for me to get
[1:14:15] you to a Pentecostal spirit experience
[1:14:18] you need to go to calorie calorie is
[1:14:22] God's method of bringing you to
[1:14:24] Pentecost and it never changed 2,000
[1:14:28] years and never changed the scene of the
[1:14:32] tabernacle was always the altar Oh
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:40] listen brother in the tabernacle it was
[1:14:43] three kind of believers three kind of
[1:14:47] believes in every church right we all
[1:14:50] know that quote but we got to take you
[1:14:52] into the scripture and teach you that
[1:14:54] out of the Bible all right I love taking
[1:14:57] the message and teaching the people the
[1:15:00] scripture I tell the people I said if I
[1:15:03] if Bob Arum said something I can't find
[1:15:05] in the Bible doesn't mean I don't
[1:15:07] believe it
[1:15:08] but I won't preach it until I could see
[1:15:09] it in the scripture there's my
[1:15:13] commission is to take you to the world
[1:15:16] maybe I don't have as much vision as
[1:15:18] somebody else but what I've got I get
[1:15:21] from the scripture I told the church not
[1:15:24] watch the worshiper bring just sacrifice
[1:15:26] and the vid against the first chapter
[1:15:28] come out the burnt offering right right
[1:15:30] he brings that sacrifice and I said
[1:15:33] there's five things he's gonna do the
[1:15:35] worshipper and there's five things the
[1:15:37] ministry has to do Wow
[1:15:39] you can study it out look I don't have
[1:15:41] time to teach you that right now
[1:15:43] I'm sure your past you'll do that but
[1:15:45] don't see now that in other words nobody
[1:15:47] can offer the sacrifice without the help
[1:15:50] of the ministry oh I mean you can't stay
[1:15:56] home from church that means you don't
[1:16:01] have a right to worship God at home by
[1:16:04] listening to a tape the ministry is part
[1:16:08] of it
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:12] hallelujah see you see the people there
[1:16:16] being a letter straight this way is
[1:16:18] because they don't know the Bible you
[1:16:21] knew the Bible you would never break the
[1:16:23] patterns of the scripture and you watch
[1:16:26] the worship would come with a sacrifice
[1:16:29] the priesthood would participate and and
[1:16:32] worship mood for a participate and he'd
[1:16:35] say hallelujah I should forget on my sin
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:38] but that's just the first kind the
[1:16:40] second part is the the Levite who
[1:16:42] actually cuts the sacrifice up right so
[1:16:47] we have a worshiper and we have a worker
[1:16:52] good there's people in the church did
[1:16:54] work they do all the dirty work
[1:16:58] that Levite at the other day full of
[1:17:01] blood
[1:17:01] yes don't like that ah yeah see but it
[1:17:05] was his duty to worship God by working
[1:17:09] and the word she will receive is Wesley
[1:17:12] because the worker was present
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:17] so we had the word worshipper we have a
[1:17:19] Levite but then we had the Levitical
[1:17:21] priesthood and the Levitical priesthood
[1:17:25] went beyond the curtain into the holy
[1:17:28] place you know the first thing he did
[1:17:31] when he went in there
[1:17:32] he got some anointing rolling and bathed
[1:17:34] himself an anointing wall you know why
[1:17:37] to get the stink off God didn't want
[1:17:41] this think of death in the holy place
[1:17:44] everything in that holy place had to be
[1:17:47] sprinkled with oil yes
[1:17:49] that sweet anointing oil to take the
[1:17:52] smell of death off of everything and he
[1:17:55] was in the presence of God he had a
[1:17:58] right to pray in the presence of God the
[1:18:01] altar of incense was there and just
[1:18:04] beyond the curtain was the presence of
[1:18:06] God amen
[1:18:07] so we have a we have a worshiper we have
[1:18:10] a worker and we have a man that
[1:18:12] fellowships with God so the Bible says
[1:18:20] that we be Jesus has made us kings and
[1:18:22] priests not kings and Levites but kings
[1:18:27] and priests yeah and then that place is
[1:18:30] the message of the hour the candlestick
[1:18:32] all right special bread being
[1:18:34] illuminated by by the light of the fire
[1:18:37] Amen so see we have to know where do we
[1:18:41] stand where do we worship might I
[1:18:44] believe III go beyond that that curtain
[1:18:47] all right in that in the presence of God
[1:18:50] right there just on your side and
[1:18:53] and being a Levite gives you the
[1:18:56] privilege of one day hoping to be a high
[1:18:59] priest there's only the sons of the high
[1:19:01] priests the Levites the Levitical
[1:19:05] priesthood could actually worship in
[1:19:07] that place right when you were called
[1:19:09] you go beyond the veil and be the
[1:19:13] presence that pillar of fire so we see
[1:19:16] here in 1st Samuel the tenth chapter
[1:19:19] Samuel a prophet of God for that day a
[1:19:22] perfect type of William Branham you can
[1:19:25] follow that in the scriptures of 13
[1:19:27] judge there were three judges that were
[1:19:31] living at the same time at the time of
[1:19:33] Samuel Eli the priest and the high
[1:19:36] priest was a judge the Samuel was a
[1:19:40] judge and Samson was a judge hallelujah
[1:19:45] three living at the same time we see
[1:19:48] what happened to Samson because he never
[1:19:50] sought the counsel of the vindicated
[1:19:52] prophet oh ma
[1:19:54] Samson was born 10 years after Samuel
[1:19:57] Wow and they started your ministry had
[1:20:00] exactly the same year Samuel was 30
[1:20:04] years old and Samson was twenty years
[1:20:07] old
[1:20:07] oh brother BAM said Samson was a
[1:20:10] Pentecostal church and he says Delilah
[1:20:14] deceived him and God he got his eyes
[1:20:17] plucked out you know why because he
[1:20:19] wouldn't go to the eye of God
[1:20:22] which was Samson Samuel if you had gone
[1:20:25] to Samuel Samuel and sought counsel
[1:20:28] Samuel said get away from Neptune a sea
[1:20:30] woman but see Samson wanted to do
[1:20:34] whatever he wanted to do cuz he had been
[1:20:36] anointed by the Holy Spirit to be a
[1:20:38] judge I got the Holy Ghost read me alone
[1:20:40] I don't have to go to church I had the
[1:20:45] Holy Ghost I don't have to have a pastor
[1:20:49] I got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:52] you see listen I saw God for these these
[1:20:57] messages I have problems in my church
[1:20:59] and I said Lord you got to show me in
[1:21:00] the scripture what's going on show me in
[1:21:04] the Bible what's going on in my church
[1:21:05] so I can I can teach the people right
[1:21:07] from wrong in the scripture I'm not
[1:21:10] gonna do battle with these demons let
[1:21:12] the word conquer them so I'm sure we got
[1:21:18] that circumstances that are similar here
[1:21:21] in West Palm Beach
[1:21:22] we probably got people here don't want
[1:21:25] to listen to counsel from
[1:21:26] from Samuel the Prophet brother Jack you
[1:21:31] think you have a right to do anything
[1:21:32] you walk but you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:21:36] end up a blind man
[1:21:39] Dalila arrived wiser than you are if you
[1:21:43] lose the anointing you sure will
[1:21:48] hallelujah I got a good I feel a good
[1:21:50] spirit in this church so you might get
[1:21:53] pastor preaches just as hard as I do
[1:21:56] god bless you brother brother Jack give
[1:21:59] the place anymore we're preachers are
[1:22:00] afraid to preach against sin I'm no
[1:22:06] hireling servant of God hallelujah I'm
[1:22:14] so glad they said via a letter one time
[1:22:16] they said believe all I want you to come
[1:22:18] faster the churches started and he said
[1:22:20] please sign the return I never did sign
[1:22:22] and return it you know what I did it put
[1:22:24] it in my safe I said Lord these same
[1:22:27] people that are on this listen the rise
[1:22:29] that begins me one day
[1:22:31] I'm not signing nothing when I went to
[1:22:35] New York City they said you're gonna be
[1:22:37] our pastor I said well I'll be here in
[1:22:39] the position yes you signed a letter
[1:22:40] absolutely not if I sign that letter
[1:22:44] I'll make you my enemy because then I'm
[1:22:47] indebted to you but I came here because
[1:22:50] God sent me here
[1:22:52] I still have it in my in my files called
[1:22:55] important letters received I haven't had
[1:23:00] to pull out a time or two - yes sir now
[1:23:04] you watch you watch first Samuel the
[1:23:07] tenth chapter you'll see some things
[1:23:09] that are important right the first thing
[1:23:11] is it was a box of oil that Sam you used
[1:23:15] to anoint the soul right the prophecy
[1:23:19] said you'll mitri men one man will have
[1:23:21] three goats one man will have a bottle
[1:23:24] of wine and one man will have three
[1:23:25] loaves of bread but the prophecy said
[1:23:28] you're only gonna receive two loaves of
[1:23:30] bread so the three goats represent the
[1:23:35] sacrifice so the anointing that that saw
[1:23:39] received had nothing to do with the
[1:23:43] sacrifice the sacrifice was not
[1:23:47] associated with the anointing because he
[1:23:50] didn't receive the three goats there was
[1:23:52] no bloodshed
[1:23:53] when he we see the anointing and he just
[1:23:57] received two loaves of bread which is
[1:23:59] justification and sanctification he
[1:24:02] never got the third loaf which is the
[1:24:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he never
[1:24:07] received the wine the bottle of wine
[1:24:10] which is a revelation
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:14] and he was anointed to lead hallelujah
[1:24:19] you see in the scripture yeah this is
[1:24:23] what's happening the message you watch
[1:24:26] preachers that go out and they get angry
[1:24:28] and jealous with other preachers and
[1:24:30] start throwing your javelin you go to
[1:24:34] scripture you'll see they never got the
[1:24:36] third loaf
[1:24:37] they have no revelation of why they're
[1:24:39] leading and they never went to Calvary
[1:24:44] but now we see in 1st Samuel 16 we see
[1:24:50] or 15 we see David was anointed by the
[1:24:53] same prophet the same voice was used the
[1:24:57] same anointing oil but now he's anointed
[1:25:00] with a horn of oil not a box of oil now
[1:25:04] in Spanish it's called our Roma rhizoma
[1:25:07] is a box it's a clay box right the clay
[1:25:11] box is a type of symbol of Samuel the
[1:25:13] Prophet himself this play box held the
[1:25:17] anointing Wow and when he spoke the
[1:25:20] anointing came forth from this play box
[1:25:24] and anointed this man all right but when
[1:25:27] David when Samuel spoke the anointing
[1:25:30] came forward from a horn which speaks of
[1:25:33] a sacrifice because only God can make a
[1:25:37] horn and order for a man to use a horn
[1:25:40] as a vessel that can change the oil of
[1:25:43] the Holy Spirit it's got to die or death
[1:25:49] so when neighbor was anointed he was
[1:25:52] anointed with a horn of oil that in
[1:25:55] other words a sacrifice of calorie was
[1:25:58] directly associated with the voice of
[1:26:00] the Prophet and with the oil
[1:26:05] what would have produced nod it's a
[1:26:11] great study in the scripture
[1:26:13] this is the revelation of the first four
[1:26:17] horse riders all right are found in the
[1:26:20] life of salt and the revelation of the
[1:26:22] statue of a perfect man are found in the
[1:26:25] life of David from the moment David was
[1:26:28] anointed with that Horn of oil God do we
[1:26:31] begin to work a work in David's life
[1:26:33] that produce a crowning in 2nd Samuel
[1:26:37] all right he was crowned with the
[1:26:41] authority of the kingdom in 1st Samuel
[1:26:44] the 2nd chapter because he had come up
[1:26:47] in the statue of a perfect man until he
[1:26:50] guy finally come into brotherly love and
[1:26:52] he could love his enemy Oh
[1:26:57] you see how important tell Ria's how
[1:27:01] important that horn is now the Bible
[1:27:04] says in Revelation there was seven horns
[1:27:06] in his hand a horn for every age God
[1:27:11] never brought a message to us that was
[1:27:14] disassociated from Calvary every age the
[1:27:19] gospel remained the same because the
[1:27:21] Holy Ghost can only come through that
[1:27:23] sacrifice the sacrifice of Calvary
[1:27:28] hallelujah
[1:27:29] now it's preaching one time in Ecuador
[1:27:31] and there was a famous message preacher
[1:27:34] that was preaching with me and I went to
[1:27:37] dedicate a church and maybe I've got
[1:27:39] better be careful I want to say too much
[1:27:41] somebody will start investigating find
[1:27:43] out who the person was you don't have to
[1:27:46] worry about who the person was but I was
[1:27:49] preaching something about Calvary I
[1:27:50] remember I know it was it was true and
[1:27:52] false repentance and I preached the
[1:27:55] message to Charles Finney preached 150
[1:27:57] years ago Wow and I was teaching the
[1:28:00] church from second Corinthians chapter 7
[1:28:02] that there's seven fruits of a true
[1:28:04] repentance oh wow you search it out 2nd
[1:28:08] Corinthians chapter 7 when God begins to
[1:28:11] work a work in a man's life it brings
[1:28:13] forth seven fruits of true repentance
[1:28:17] but there's also false repentance as
[1:28:20] mentioned in second Corinthians except
[1:28:23] chapter 7 chapter the Bible says our
[1:28:25] false repentance repentance according to
[1:28:29] the world works death but true
[1:28:33] repentance work works these seven
[1:28:35] different fruits
[1:28:37] the last one is vengeance when the Holy
[1:28:41] Ghost brings you to a true repentance
[1:28:43] God takes vengeance on the enemy
[1:28:47] when you come up in the stats of a
[1:28:50] perfect man and you get to a place where
[1:28:52] you could love your enemy
[1:28:53] God can now use you to take vengeance
[1:28:56] against the enemy and that's what
[1:28:58] happened with David that Amalekite
[1:29:01] thought he was gonna be recompense with
[1:29:03] gold and silver when he reported it I'm
[1:29:06] the one that killed your enemy you
[1:29:08] should rejoice he said Oh what was you
[1:29:10] you touch God's anointed right don't you
[1:29:14] know we didn't agree but I loved my
[1:29:16] brother because the anointing was on him
[1:29:22] hallelujah oh that's a great study in
[1:29:25] the scriptures brother it's right there
[1:29:27] see the message is found in the Bible
[1:29:34] now a man that backs away from this
[1:29:37] message and rejects this message I wish
[1:29:40] I was sitting on top of the Empire State
[1:29:42] Building and preaching it to the entire
[1:29:44] world right now listen brother if a man
[1:29:47] walks away from this message it's
[1:29:49] because he has no revelation of
[1:29:51] Scripture he never came to a true
[1:29:57] repentance God does not reveal himself
[1:30:00] to a man that did not repent hallelujah
[1:30:07] see I can't leave this message this
[1:30:10] message is Christ to me it's annoying
[1:30:14] sure to me this message made me fall in
[1:30:18] love with Jesus Christ
[1:30:22] because it revealed Christ - now we just
[1:30:27] we just explained - to anointings for
[1:30:30] two different men let me let me share
[1:30:33] something else with you here yeah no I
[1:30:35] want to talk about Saul and David we've
[1:30:37] already spoken about them can we go over
[1:30:40] and maybe speak about Jeroboam all right
[1:30:45] first Kings 11 all right
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:05] watch this now first first Kings chapter
[1:31:09] 11 let's go over to uh verse 26 and
[1:31:13] Jeroboam the son of Neeb at the efforts
[1:31:16] height of the red up Solomon's servant
[1:31:19] whose mother's name was a real zebra
[1:31:22] zarua a widow woman even he lifted up
[1:31:25] his hand against the king she lifted up
[1:31:28] his hand against the pastor and this was
[1:31:32] the cause that he lifted up his hand
[1:31:34] against the King Solomon built built
[1:31:37] milho and repaired the breech of the
[1:31:39] City of David his father in other words
[1:31:42] he got jealous he thought Tony was
[1:31:45] getting glory to himself so he started
[1:31:49] nitpicking and criticizing the pastor
[1:31:51] all right and the man Jeroboam was a
[1:31:54] mighty man of Valor and Solomon seen
[1:31:57] young man that he was industrious he
[1:31:59] made him ruler over all the charge of
[1:32:01] the house of Joseph in other words he
[1:32:04] was like a Levite he was a worker man he
[1:32:06] would work in the church and the pastor
[1:32:09] said this boy is a real worker I'm gonna
[1:32:11] put him to work he loves to work in the
[1:32:14] ministry Wow and they came too fast at
[1:32:16] that time when Jeroboam went out of
[1:32:18] Jerusalem that the prophet Elijah the
[1:32:20] Shilin I'd found him in a way and he had
[1:32:23] Clyde himself with a new garment and
[1:32:25] they too were alone in the field now I
[1:32:27] want to stop you just for a moment and
[1:32:29] say this God hates new things
[1:32:35] and a Hodja
[1:32:36] he cleared himself in a new garment Wow
[1:32:40] God hates new things because everything
[1:32:43] he did was 18 times before the
[1:32:48] foundation of the world he spoke this
[1:32:50] work of redemption and that is the old
[1:32:54] time gospel we don't need anything new
[1:32:58] in the message we don't need any new
[1:33:00] garments we don't need any new carts
[1:33:03] remember David made that mistake with
[1:33:06] the new card we don't need any new
[1:33:08] swords remember that that giant came to
[1:33:12] kill David with a new sword but there
[1:33:15] was a valiant man said you can't kill
[1:33:17] the old time gospel David was an old man
[1:33:20] the old time gospel a new doctrine I'm
[1:33:24] gonna take your head off God hates new
[1:33:28] things God sent a song delusion to drove
[1:33:34] Jeroboam and I hide you caught the new
[1:33:37] climate that was on him
[1:33:39] and read it in 12 pieces and he said to
[1:33:41] Jeroboam take the ten pieces where thus
[1:33:44] said the Lord the God of Israel behold I
[1:33:47] will run the kingdom out of the hands of
[1:33:48] Solomon and will give Jim tribes unto
[1:33:51] thee Oh
[1:33:53] Jeroboam got anointed but notice there
[1:33:55] was no oil
[1:33:59] it was just the voice of the prophet
[1:34:01] saying that said the Lord but there was
[1:34:05] no oil and no sacrifice associated with
[1:34:08] that anointing there was not even a box
[1:34:13] of oil there was no horn there was no
[1:34:16] oil it was just the voice of a prophet
[1:34:19] coming from a cassette table we could
[1:34:23] say it that way
[1:34:25] hey brother the last 50 years of this
[1:34:29] message lots of people have been avoided
[1:34:31] anointed by message tapes he even called
[1:34:36] my name
[1:34:37] you know Jim Jones his name was
[1:34:40] mentioned in the message and he was
[1:34:41] anointed Wow when he killed all those
[1:34:44] people in Guyana
[1:34:45] they found message tapes there they
[1:34:48] found the revelation of the seals it was
[1:34:50] it was their net camp you better be
[1:34:55] associated with Calvary
[1:34:57] you better should make sure that that
[1:34:59] all comes forth from Calvary the true
[1:35:06] anointing will make your servant to
[1:35:08] God's people
[1:35:09] you will not lord over the people and
[1:35:12] you will divide the camp like Jeroboam
[1:35:14] did you see split searches all over the
[1:35:20] place everywhere I go I find a testimony
[1:35:23] of somebody's church breaking up because
[1:35:25] somebody was lifted up in their spirit
[1:35:28] and started criticizing Solomon the
[1:35:31] builder of the church I wish I had time
[1:35:36] to preach is the way I wanted to listen
[1:35:39] brother
[1:35:39] these things are real we're reading
[1:35:41] prophecy in the scripture there's
[1:35:45] jeroboams in the camp right now now you
[1:35:48] watched your bulb everything did they do
[1:35:50] did that he did was false the Bible said
[1:35:53] he had a false priesthood he can't fault
[1:35:55] a place of worship you ordained a false
[1:35:58] ministry everything he did was false
[1:36:02] but he was anointed by the voice of a
[1:36:05] Hydra the prophet
[1:36:07] Annoying to delete God said a strong
[1:36:11] delusion is he's in a proper to anoint
[1:36:15] him with his voice can we go to another
[1:36:18] verse in Scripture I know my god I know
[1:36:21] brother Jack has to leave and maybe the
[1:36:26] Lord will keep that airplane down like
[1:36:28] you did for brother BAM well let's just
[1:36:39] jump ahead
[1:36:39] yeah-hoo yeah-hoo the prophet now he was
[1:36:45] anoint you with a box of oil see there
[1:36:48] was no sacrifice associated with his
[1:36:51] anointing and he was anointed by God to
[1:36:54] go and kill all the the effects of
[1:36:58] Jezebel death Alaia in Israel in other
[1:37:02] words he was anointed to kill the
[1:37:04] denominational spirit that was in Israel
[1:37:07] that Jezebel system but he was not
[1:37:12] associated with his sacrifice of Calvary
[1:37:15] hallelujah
[1:37:16] notice he is the fulfillment of part of
[1:37:19] Elijah's ministry praise the Lord
[1:37:23] but I want you to see that he never ever
[1:37:26] showed any mercy to anyone because mercy
[1:37:31] comes from Calvary
[1:37:35] and and you gotta know in a a chariot
[1:37:38] one day should come up jump up in my
[1:37:41] chariot here and seal the seal the offer
[1:37:43] that I had so he had a supernatural zeal
[1:37:46] that caused him to overstep the bounds
[1:37:50] of his commission but the Prophet said
[1:37:53] you're gonna destroy Jezebel house and
[1:37:56] that's a lie but he never said you're
[1:37:58] gonna destroy all the prophets of bail
[1:38:01] and he killed all those prophets a male
[1:38:04] without any mercy so we have preachers
[1:38:07] in a message that can preach against
[1:38:10] Jezebel preach against that
[1:38:12] denominational system but they can't win
[1:38:14] a soul for Christ's getting angry raise
[1:38:24] your hand I'll raise my I'll repeat it
[1:38:26] again that's the truth brother
[1:38:29] I know preachers that have been
[1:38:32] preaching for 40 years they have never
[1:38:33] won one soul for Kefka Christ you know
[1:38:37] why they're not associated with Calvary
[1:38:39] oh they can preach for four hours but
[1:38:43] they'll never mention Calvary hallelujah
[1:38:49] I was telling you about this man over in
[1:38:51] Ecuador I got up and preached this
[1:38:53] message about true and false repentance
[1:38:54] and the church whate'er although the
[1:38:57] Altru is full of preachers
[1:39:01] not lagi all the preachers came forward
[1:39:04] you know is praying for them they're our
[1:39:07] wives I was shocked brother Jack my wife
[1:39:11] was there and and this is this all this
[1:39:14] old preacher that may be preaching 50
[1:39:16] years is wise praying that God would
[1:39:19] bring in the complete repentance all the
[1:39:22] evangelists all the pastor's they're all
[1:39:24] laying at the altar weeping and that's
[1:39:26] not running everywhere it was really the
[1:39:30] Lord I was shocked myself to see what
[1:39:33] the effect of the true gospel being
[1:39:35] preached to them men that preach the
[1:39:39] gospel have never come to true
[1:39:41] repentance they still they commit
[1:39:45] adultery and they commit fornication
[1:39:47] married two or three times in pastoring
[1:39:49] churches I think the Holy Spirit no sir
[1:39:55] the Holy Spirit is righteousness and
[1:39:58] truth well the next preacher got up
[1:40:03] behind me he was more famous than me and
[1:40:07] he got up and he said well how many
[1:40:09] appreciated brother carry-ons message
[1:40:11] this morning everybody clapped amen amen
[1:40:12] they all loved me there and then he says
[1:40:14] but we know that Calvary is not
[1:40:17] necessary today we don't have to preach
[1:40:20] those things today what we have to do is
[1:40:22] bring the church up into the faith of
[1:40:24] the rapture and my translator was
[1:40:28] sitting next to me and he grabbed
[1:40:30] because you tell I take off running
[1:40:31] maybe grab him by the throat or
[1:40:33] something you know he knows how I am
[1:40:37] he said calm down believe I said well
[1:40:39] that's okay he just sealed himself
[1:40:41] outside the kingdom he just blast him
[1:40:44] the Holy Spirit I see you don't fool
[1:40:47] with people like that brother let him
[1:40:49] preach what he wants to he's outside the
[1:40:51] kingdom you you you say something
[1:40:53] against Calvary you say it's not
[1:40:56] necessary you have blaspheme the Holy
[1:40:58] Spirit you have blaspheme the gospel you
[1:41:01] have killed the effect of the gospel
[1:41:03] you're without hope there's no coming
[1:41:07] back
[1:41:09] let him say what he wants to say you
[1:41:12] watch repeal what happens with people
[1:41:14] like that
[1:41:15] they always end up in shame now you
[1:41:19] watch watch the scripture now Abraham
[1:41:21] took love with him right brother BAM
[1:41:23] said he was just huh
[1:41:24] what was he called him here in the
[1:41:26] biskits right just a problem all the
[1:41:30] time for Abraham but you know we did he
[1:41:32] gotten blessed because he was under the
[1:41:35] umbrella or the wings of a prophetic
[1:41:38] ministry and so he begin to grow and his
[1:41:42] Fox grew in his church grew until
[1:41:44] finally the two churches started arguing
[1:41:46] about what missionary camp they should
[1:41:48] go to and Abraham was a man of God he
[1:41:51] said brother you want to go to the ride
[1:41:53] go ahead and do the ride I'll go to left
[1:41:55] he gave him preference showing that he
[1:41:58] was elect he didn't fight wherever I go
[1:42:02] I'm blessed I don't I don't have to seek
[1:42:03] the green fields of Sodom but he he
[1:42:07] decided to go to Sodom see you know why
[1:42:10] he had come to a place we thought I
[1:42:12] don't need to follow this prophet no
[1:42:14] more wow I've been blessed my church has
[1:42:17] been blessed
[1:42:18] I can I can seek prosperity now
[1:42:21] and I can go the way of the world Sodom
[1:42:25] and Gomorrah when you see a message
[1:42:28] preacher leaving holiness he's headed
[1:42:31] for the green fields of Sodom I'm a
[1:42:37] holiness preacher my my experience made
[1:42:42] me a holiness preacher I believe a
[1:42:44] church has got to clean up yeah Church
[1:42:47] has got to get rid of thing all the
[1:42:48] things of the world I hope you don't get
[1:42:51] angry at me but I'm gonna preach it
[1:42:53] anyway it's the truth
[1:42:55] Abraham be stayed separated up on the
[1:42:58] mountaintop but the angel the Lord but
[1:43:01] but a lot had been deceived into
[1:43:04] believing God's with me too I can go the
[1:43:08] way the world and God is with me because
[1:43:10] look look how my church is grown but you
[1:43:13] know what he had two sons and that
[1:43:17] decision he made was reflected in his
[1:43:20] two sons and the two sons come to an
[1:43:24] illness a relationship with his daughter
[1:43:27] and the the legacy they left those two
[1:43:31] boys Ammon and Moab is you know legacy
[1:43:36] is the reputation you leave your
[1:43:37] children right you could leave your
[1:43:39] money gold and silver but what's more
[1:43:42] important is the reputation
[1:43:44] that your daddy leaves for you and
[1:43:47] people will respect you just because of
[1:43:50] who your father was or else they'll
[1:43:52] disrespect you because of who your
[1:43:55] father was you see how important it is
[1:43:58] young man to be a good father and stay
[1:44:01] under the wings of this prophetic
[1:44:03] ministry you know what the legacy was
[1:44:09] that he left Hammond in Moab it was a
[1:44:11] legacy of shame because every time
[1:44:15] Hammond and more apt talked about their
[1:44:16] father they were also talking about the
[1:44:19] grandfather and that legacy of shame
[1:44:24] begin to create a hatred between them
[1:44:27] and the elect of God and they became
[1:44:30] eternal enemies of Israel because Israel
[1:44:33] could talk about a legacy of faith but
[1:44:36] they couldn't talk about a legacy of
[1:44:38] faith their legacy was shame you watch
[1:44:41] these preachers that lead this message
[1:44:44] the legacy leader children will always
[1:44:46] end up in shame they always end up out
[1:44:49] in the world all go ahead you know
[1:44:52] there's always a aspire to in church
[1:44:55] every time I preach this kind of thing
[1:44:57] there's always somebody in the church
[1:44:59] gonna tell I'm gonna go tell so so he
[1:45:01] said there
[1:45:02] happens every single time they come
[1:45:05] along when they throw you under the bus
[1:45:07] believe on my brother brother Jack
[1:45:09] but brother Ivonne said this over
[1:45:11] brother Jack dubs Church and then the
[1:45:13] next thing I get a phone call how dare
[1:45:14] you talk that way well the truth is the
[1:45:16] truth you watch all through the
[1:45:22] scripture whenever a man leaves a
[1:45:24] prophetic ministry he always ends up
[1:45:26] leaving a legacy of shame for his
[1:45:28] children once again it's in the Bible
[1:45:36] it's prophetic word coming to to us
[1:45:40] through the scripture hallelujah so
[1:45:45] Jeroboam was deceived by the voice the
[1:45:49] prophet he received an anointing that
[1:45:51] made him tainted the kingdom and split
[1:45:54] the church and actually that was Yahoo
[1:45:59] let's go to the last one I know the
[1:46:02] Jack's gotta leave it's alright but I
[1:46:04] want you to study the Scriptures and I
[1:46:06] want you to to study the anointings that
[1:46:09] are in the Bible many different ways for
[1:46:12] men to be anointed but there's only one
[1:46:15] true way the true leadership is
[1:46:18] reflected in another quote the brother
[1:46:21] prophet give us he said here let's see
[1:46:25] if I can find it here page three
[1:46:30] like
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:36] the revelation of Jesus Christ brother
[1:46:39] Baron says don't be confused because he
[1:46:42] has three offices or that he has a
[1:46:44] three-fold manifestation on earth he was
[1:46:47] a prophet in heaven he is the priest and
[1:46:50] coming back to earth he is the king of
[1:46:53] Judah he is prophet priest and King so
[1:46:57] the true leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:59] must be reflected was three offices
[1:47:02] prophet priest and King in other words
[1:47:05] the Prophet must be present the priest
[1:47:08] must be present right and your deign
[1:47:10] king must present all right now notice
[1:47:13] in in in David's case the Prophet was
[1:47:16] president the King was present but the
[1:47:18] high priest was not there and we know
[1:47:22] that the war in the world must be
[1:47:23] present all right five identifications
[1:47:26] for true leadership Wow the the the Horn
[1:47:30] of oil the oil corn oil prophet priest
[1:47:34] and King we see the foreign and the oil
[1:47:37] the puppet and the King but the high
[1:47:39] priest is not present in David's life
[1:47:42] because that's why he was called a man
[1:47:44] of blood he could not build a temple
[1:47:48] because he had killed his field much
[1:47:50] blood why because the high priest was
[1:47:53] not present the high priest is a
[1:47:56] Ministry of intercession for mercy and
[1:48:00] for joy hallelujah the only place you'll
[1:48:05] find in the scripture we're all five
[1:48:08] identifications are found are in the
[1:48:10] anointing of Sullivan the King can I
[1:48:15] take you over to let's see here first I
[1:48:20] think it's first Kings
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:25] first Kings I don't think I'd get this
[1:48:29] far I didn't write that verse of
[1:48:30] scripture down first Kings
[1:48:36] there's kings
[1:48:40] yes first Kings chapter one
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:49] Adonai just another anointing in chapter
[1:48:52] 1 first few verses he was anointed to be
[1:48:55] king also but he was anointed lost
[1:48:58] because when he saw that shoot of mine
[1:49:01] he was anointed with lust the Bible says
[1:49:04] then he he he lifted up himself when he
[1:49:08] saw that beautiful shunammite he wanted
[1:49:10] that shoot'em eye for himself he was
[1:49:13] anointed with lust no prophet was
[1:49:15] present in the oil was president no horn
[1:49:17] was present the high priest wasn't
[1:49:19] present but what was what was present
[1:49:21] was a lustful spirit and you'll see that
[1:49:25] wherever a new church begins to rise up
[1:49:28] there's always an agonized you that
[1:49:30] won't take her
[1:49:35] he wants that beautiful shooter mic
[1:49:37] which shoot of my faith
[1:49:39] remember the shooter my woman was that
[1:49:42] the David seventh wife hallelujah but he
[1:49:47] never had a natural relationship with
[1:49:49] her he had a spiritual relationship with
[1:49:52] her Wow he never had a physical
[1:49:54] relationship with her it was spiritual
[1:49:56] and he kept the old time gospel alive
[1:50:00] David was dying he represented the old
[1:50:03] time gospel and he got this beautiful
[1:50:05] virgin woman right to keep him warm
[1:50:10] hallelujah
[1:50:11] until the time of the building came and
[1:50:15] and I denied you wanted her for himself
[1:50:19] now first kings and verse 37 as the Lord
[1:50:25] had been with my lord the King even so
[1:50:29] be he with Solomon and make his throne
[1:50:31] greater than the throne of my lord King
[1:50:33] David so Zadok the priest the high
[1:50:36] priest and Nathan the prophet the
[1:50:39] Prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada
[1:50:42] Joya and the Cherith lights and the
[1:50:45] Pella fights went down and calls Solomon
[1:50:47] to ride upon Kings David David's mule
[1:50:50] and brought him to get your kid run so
[1:50:53] we see the Prophet Britain King or
[1:50:55] present and Zadok the priest took a
[1:50:58] hoard of oil out of the tabernacle and
[1:51:01] an anointed Solomon and they blew the
[1:51:04] trumpet and all the people said god save
[1:51:07] King Solomon so the prophet priest and
[1:51:11] King are present and the Horn of war was
[1:51:15] present right all five identifications
[1:51:18] the only King in the Bible that's
[1:51:20] identified with all five
[1:51:23] what Solomon the king Wow you know why
[1:51:25] because Solomon the King was the builder
[1:51:28] of the tabernacle and builder of the
[1:51:30] temple at a perfect type of the Holy
[1:51:32] Ghost God is building a temple during
[1:51:36] the Gentile dispensation and every man
[1:51:40] that's anointed of God to lead the
[1:51:42] church must have all five
[1:51:44] identifications in his life breathe
[1:51:48] we're not deceived anymore by gifts of
[1:51:52] preaching in Spanish the gift is called
[1:51:59] wound on the la Via you know in love
[1:52:01] years it comes to the world love you
[1:52:03] love you as your lip some people have a
[1:52:07] gift of lip they know they move their
[1:52:11] lips just right or they got tremendous
[1:52:15] memories they can preach to you and
[1:52:18] quote you a lot better and believe on
[1:52:20] and they'll preach to it three or four
[1:52:23] hours sermons to you but you'll never
[1:52:25] see them building the temple they're
[1:52:27] always tearing it down
[1:52:31] brother Jack don't have any revelation
[1:52:34] about the message come and come to my
[1:52:37] ministry double click and listen to my
[1:52:41] ministry and send the tithes here and
[1:52:44] you're gonna grow spiritually no you're
[1:52:47] not
[1:52:49] that man is deceiving you
[1:52:51] you need a pastor that can pray for your
[1:52:55] children intercede for your your
[1:52:57] marriages you need a pastor you need a
[1:53:00] plate to pay your tithing locally but
[1:53:03] the Bible said every Christian should
[1:53:05] have a local assembly and every
[1:53:07] Christian should have a pasture this is
[1:53:10] a new thing that's coming up in the
[1:53:12] message these internet pastors nothing
[1:53:17] but nonsense all it is you'll never
[1:53:20] build the Church of all that way no
[1:53:23] siree there's gonna be someone locally
[1:53:26] working there's gotta be a pastor to
[1:53:29] lead you and guide you you can't submit
[1:53:31] yourself to an authority of a man that
[1:53:33] lives 3,000 miles away it's easy brother
[1:53:38] you know today we have this new thing in
[1:53:41] the message so wake up on Sunday morning
[1:53:43] they got their slippers on and maybe a
[1:53:45] set of Pecha pajamas it's about time for
[1:53:49] church and they go over and double-click
[1:53:51] on the computer pick out a side say well
[1:53:54] let's do this one today they kick up
[1:53:56] their feet up on the recliner and they
[1:53:58] tell it their wife honey give me some
[1:54:00] ham and eggs and maybe some toast and
[1:54:03] some oatmeal and while they're listening
[1:54:06] and they're going to church they're
[1:54:07] having breakfast at the same time
[1:54:09] I think they push pause and they go to
[1:54:13] the bathroom and they come push it let's
[1:54:16] continue I don't like that sermon let me
[1:54:18] kick over here and listen to somebody
[1:54:20] else see and when you do that you don't
[1:54:24] have to submit yourself to nobody let's
[1:54:28] talk the truth now that's really what
[1:54:30] it's all about
[1:54:36] brother Jack I just don't believe in
[1:54:39] that stuff you know why is something new
[1:54:44] when I searched the scripture I just
[1:54:47] don't see that in the Bible when Paul
[1:54:49] preached to the Ephesians he was there
[1:54:51] laboring with those people the people in
[1:54:54] Corinth were listening to what he was
[1:54:56] saying you know why he had a different
[1:54:58] message for the church at Corinth if he
[1:55:04] had been preaching me to the church at
[1:55:06] Corinth it all died gagging on that meat
[1:55:09] all they could hear was milk that's what
[1:55:17] happens when when your church goes out
[1:55:19] and starts doing that stuff then they
[1:55:21] start making carnal compares these are
[1:55:23] they that compare themselves amongst
[1:55:25] themselves and they are not wise
[1:55:28] it's the identification of the foolish
[1:55:31] version when you start comparing
[1:55:35] ministries it identifies you as a
[1:55:38] foolish version
[1:55:42] you have to have a revelation who your
[1:55:44] pastor is I'd like to just finish with
[1:55:48] this there's more we could save it and
[1:55:51] break it down more for you but we don't
[1:55:53] have time 40 years of peace you know why
[1:55:57] Solomon was a wise son before you
[1:56:00] receive the gift of wisdom David told
[1:56:03] Solomon Sullivan you're a wise son
[1:56:06] before he's you see the gift of wisdom
[1:56:08] he said you know what you have to do
[1:56:10] with that Joab yeah you know he's giving
[1:56:14] me nothing but trouble he's been
[1:56:15] disobedient mighty in battle but he
[1:56:19] don't know how to conduct himself in
[1:56:20] church so he's great for killing
[1:56:25] Philistines but obeying the king he just
[1:56:28] can't do it and you can't possibly build
[1:56:31] this temple until you kill that man Wow
[1:56:35] so word he died at the at the
[1:56:37] altar holding on to the horns right
[1:56:39] holding the horn representing the
[1:56:41] sacrifice yeah four horns right holding
[1:56:44] on to that horn they're begging for
[1:56:47] mercy but the Bible says if you don't
[1:56:49] give mercy there's no mercy gonna come
[1:56:51] to you and after two have died
[1:56:54] now Solomon enjoy the reign of forty
[1:56:57] years of peace why because God said you
[1:57:01] have to put all your energy all your
[1:57:03] resources into building the temple you
[1:57:06] can't be distracted with problems in the
[1:57:08] church
[1:57:13] so sometimes pastors got me rough that
[1:57:18] Joe abs in the church I got a question
[1:57:20] for you are you a Joab or you're an
[1:57:23] Abner
[1:57:25] joab had the right doctrine but the
[1:57:28] wrong spirit I haven't had the wrong
[1:57:31] doctrine but he had the right spirit and
[1:57:34] the right spirit corrected Abner and he
[1:57:38] died because his doctrine was corrected
[1:57:41] Joab didn't believe in that God can
[1:57:43] change a man's heart and he came to true
[1:57:47] leadership and he died because of it so
[1:57:50] we have jobs in a church we have Abner's
[1:57:53] in the church in the message of the hour
[1:57:55] yeah I'll tell you when I see men
[1:57:57] jumping from church to church from
[1:57:59] pillar to post there's something wrong
[1:58:01] with them let me share this with you
[1:58:04] Ephesians the first chapter which in his
[1:58:10] way makes it makes a lot of enemies the
[1:58:12] devil hates this kind of preaching he
[1:58:15] teases the first chapter
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:27] we'll start in verse 6 I'm gonna finish
[1:58:29] up now you can alway cup now in my
[1:58:35] church when I see people sleeping I
[1:58:36] always tell them well I'm finishing up
[1:58:38] and they wake right up
[1:58:45] we will be leaving pretty soon I don't
[1:58:47] want nobody catch me sleeping let me
[1:58:49] wake up verse six to the praise of the
[1:58:53] glory of His grace wherein he had made
[1:58:56] us accepted in the beloved and who we
[1:59:00] have redemption through his blood not
[1:59:02] the ink but through his blood right the
[1:59:06] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:59:08] riches of His grace we're in here the
[1:59:11] bounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:59:13] prudence having made known unto us the
[1:59:16] mystery of his will according to his
[1:59:19] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[1:59:21] himself then the dispensation of the
[1:59:24] fullness of times he might gather
[1:59:26] together hidden one all things in Christ
[1:59:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:59:31] on earth even in him in other words
[1:59:32] rapture the rapture is about God coming
[1:59:36] down and gathering those that that he
[1:59:39] has revealed the mystery of his will to
[1:59:42] so the Word of God was first spoken
[1:59:46] before pintada the foundation of the
[1:59:49] world before the creation God spoke his
[1:59:51] word and then he placed it in symbolic
[1:59:54] form in the Bible amen
[1:59:57] then the symbolic form of the word is
[2:00:00] dispensed in every age as a revelation
[2:00:03] for that age the message of that age and
[2:00:05] the elect believer catches that
[2:00:08] revelation amen and that revelation
[2:00:10] becomes something called vindicated
[2:00:13] truth whether Balaam said those seven
[2:00:16] thunders would be vindicated truth truth
[2:00:20] vindicated by the voice of God
[2:00:22] personally to the individual
[2:00:24] and that voice would reveal the mystery
[2:00:28] of God's will for your life so this word
[2:00:32] this Bible and the message of the hour
[2:00:35] everything that God had been doing the
[2:00:37] last 2000 years is simply put this way
[2:00:40] he's trying to reveal the mystery of his
[2:00:42] will for your life now we have people
[2:00:46] that can quote the message and know the
[2:00:49] Bible by memory they preach it but can
[2:00:52] they can never find the mystery of God's
[2:00:55] will for their life it means there's no
[2:00:58] revelation when God we begin to reveal
[2:01:01] the word to you it's for one purpose to
[2:01:04] position you in Christ to put you in the
[2:01:08] promised land and to hold you in that
[2:01:10] piece of inheritance that belongs to you
[2:01:13] that's why you see people jumping from
[2:01:15] church to church they're never content
[2:01:18] because they've never had the will of
[2:01:19] God revealed to them and the only way
[2:01:23] you can possibly please God is to be
[2:01:27] standing in the revealed mystery of God
[2:01:29] for your life I just don't believe in it
[2:01:36] the scripture doesn't teach me that
[2:01:38] right
[2:01:39] I was asked one time but they've all we
[2:01:42] got an Internet church we want you to
[2:01:45] come down and preach for us on Saturday
[2:01:47] there's a lot of believers across the
[2:01:49] country that don't have a place to go to
[2:01:51] church and we're trying to reach those
[2:01:53] people and encourage them and your
[2:01:55] ministry would be a great blessing then
[2:01:56] would you would you would you possibly
[2:01:58] help us with to help those people I said
[2:02:00] absolutely not and they said why not I
[2:02:03] said well the first thing is why they
[2:02:05] take a job somewhere they can't go to
[2:02:06] church
[2:02:09] I never do that
[2:02:14] the Bible teaches us that Christ might
[2:02:17] have the preeminence in the church but
[2:02:20] the BAM said there was three things God
[2:02:22] was trying to do right he's trying to
[2:02:24] reveal himself have the preeminence
[2:02:25] Christ would have the preeminence and
[2:02:27] restore now we claim that that God we've
[2:02:31] received the revelation of the word and
[2:02:33] we claim to be revealed but Christ
[2:02:35] doesn't have the preeminence your career
[2:02:39] has your preeminence your bank account
[2:02:43] has your preeminence some woman has
[2:02:45] preeminence in your life so I find the
[2:02:50] problem in the messages preeminence so I
[2:02:52] told this brother I've said brother if
[2:02:54] they're they moved after some money or
[2:02:57] some job somewhere I said to me they're
[2:02:59] backslidden
[2:03:00] and I'm not gonna preach to them because
[2:03:03] what I'm doing is putting wood on your
[2:03:05] back slidden fire
[2:03:08] they need to repent they need to seek
[2:03:12] the will of God for their life find a
[2:03:14] pastor somewhere they'll tell them the
[2:03:16] truth and sit there better to be poor
[2:03:19] and be married to the right pastor
[2:03:22] that'll be rich and be married some
[2:03:25] prostitute somewhere amen don't deceive
[2:03:33] yourself if you know this message and
[2:03:35] you're still wondering about the will of
[2:03:37] God for your life you better put your
[2:03:39] knowledge off to one side that's
[2:03:41] secondary
[2:03:43] the primary thing in a Christians life
[2:03:45] is to be found in Christ on the day of
[2:03:49] the rapture and Christ means the perfect
[2:03:52] will of God for your life
[2:03:56] the anointed word cop student I'll put
[2:03:59] you in your place when Christ Paul on
[2:04:03] the skin immediately god I've called you
[2:04:06] to be a light to the Gentiles he placed
[2:04:10] him in his position immediately and
[2:04:13] three and a half years in the desert up
[2:04:16] on Mount Sinai do you know he went to
[2:04:17] Mount Sinai
[2:04:18] not just Saudi Arabia but he went to the
[2:04:21] same place Moses got his revelation Wow
[2:04:25] he went to Mount Sinai with his Buffone
[2:04:28] he began to study and all God revealed
[2:04:30] to him was what I want for you to do
[2:04:33] with your life as Christ was revealed to
[2:04:37] Paul up in that holy place the will of
[2:04:40] God was revealed let the exact time
[2:04:44] to Paul the Apostle and it caused the
[2:04:48] name change
[2:04:49] a change in his character hey can I get
[2:04:52] you to stand
[2:04:53] oh just from one move over to prayer
[2:05:00] dear Lord we as these things of God
[2:05:05] you're speaking to me you know Lord
[2:05:13] since the day I got the Holy Ghost
[2:05:15] father so many years ago all I've ever
[2:05:19] desired is to know you will father for
[2:05:21] my life I couldn't explain it then
[2:05:25] father but you know I'd locked myself in
[2:05:27] my room Lord and I'd roll around the
[2:05:29] ground and beat my head against the wall
[2:05:31] just because I knew our nothing meant
[2:05:36] more to me today than to know your will
[2:05:38] for my life and now I see the God but
[2:05:43] that's evidence of the true Holy Ghost
[2:05:44] Father and Lord that love I have for
[2:05:48] your Lord is based on that you have
[2:05:50] something for me to do you're trying to
[2:05:53] reveal yourself O God your plan in my
[2:05:55] life Lord not that we would enter into
[2:05:58] contention with other people or fight or
[2:06:00] break churches up Lord but that I might
[2:06:03] be pleasing to You Lord according to
[2:06:06] your good pleasure father as Paul the
[2:06:08] Apostle said Lord we pray O God if we
[2:06:13] slipped away from any of these five
[2:06:15] identifications Lord in some way I pray
[2:06:18] you'd forgive us Lord and bring us back
[2:06:20] Lord the prophet of God is that
[2:06:23] prophetic message law the priest is the
[2:06:26] intercessor of God the king is the word
[2:06:28] O Lord the horn is a sacrifice and new
[2:06:32] all is the holy spirit Lord we've got to
[2:06:34] be associated with all those things
[2:06:36] they've got to be active in our lives in
[2:06:38] order for you to use us to build this
[2:06:41] temple Lord a holy temple
[2:06:44] o God that you people might dwell in
[2:06:46] that place and we might be spiritual

[2:07:16] Spirit mold the people together into one
[2:07:19] body in such a way of God that when the
[2:07:22] enemy comes in the Father you will raise
[2:07:24] up a standard or God and the people will
[2:07:26] grow closer and closer together and keep
[2:07:29] the enemy out the Father o Lord we know
[2:07:31] that Satan is not done with his work we
[2:07:34] pray O God that they be able to identify
