[23:33] um
[23:33] as we navigate through this these times
[23:36] that we've never walked through before
[23:37] but we believe god has been bringing us
[23:38] through and
[23:39] and he'll continue to bring us through
[23:41] amen so just keep that in mind
[23:43] uh also um sunday services will continue
[23:47] to have our 9 a.m and 12 p.m service and
[23:50] amen we uh uh thank god for uh
[23:53] the lord just meeting us at uh at these
[23:55] different times
[23:56] uh this this thursday we'll be starting
[23:59] our
[24:00] outreach new outreach opportunity that
[24:02] god has given us
[24:03] in um it's a the actual the name of the
[24:06] place
[24:07] uh is called twin lakes amen the name of
[24:10] the the little development that we'll be
[24:12] going in it's called twin lakes
[24:13] right off skis road and we'll be doing a
[24:15] outreach a pantry
[24:17] that has been given to us a church as a
[24:19] church and i and i want to just mention
[24:21] to all the ones that will be involved
[24:24] there there's a lot of food that's
[24:25] involved in here but
[24:27] you know we have to go with a really
[24:29] really good reputation
[24:31] amongst them they don't want to see us
[24:33] come and take from them
[24:35] they want us giving to them and and i
[24:38] want to just encourage everyone that
[24:39] gets involved
[24:40] please don't take anything unless they
[24:42] actually specifically say but
[24:44] they're watching us they're watching us
[24:45] so we got to be very very careful
[24:47] with how we go out and conduct ourselves
[24:49] we have to build trust
[24:51] and uh you know let's let's do it with
[24:53] excellence amen we're going to operate
[24:54] with excellence when we go out there
[24:56] and uh but i'm thinking this is just an
[24:58] opportunity for the church
[25:00] we we give food physically but
[25:02] ultimately we're trying to get food
[25:04] spiritually
[25:05] and we want to be able to invite people
[25:07] to come to this church and
[25:08] you know where they can hear the word of
[25:10] god and and things of that nature so
[25:12] that is our hope that's that's our
[25:14] desire we know everybody that comes
[25:15] through the line might not come to
[25:17] church
[25:17] but god is looking for that one seed
[25:19] amen so we want to do everything we can
[25:22] to be ready to welcome them here to the
[25:24] house of the lord so
[25:25] keep that in mind uh also uh
[25:28] so thursday the 13th four o'clock is the
[25:31] time that we'll meet there
[25:32] uh if you desire to help out please let
[25:35] us know uh i access the tina just to
[25:37] kind of spearhead this and
[25:38] and primary reason the sister team had
[25:41] already been working
[25:42] in this way with uh feeding the homeless
[25:44] a man she was taking food out to
[25:47] the park there in um uh lake worth and
[25:50] you know had been doing it faithfully
[25:51] nobody knew that she was out there doing
[25:53] it
[25:54] but uh but we knew and i said you know
[25:55] what somebody with a heart like that
[25:57] would be a perfect person just kind of
[25:58] spearhead something like this so
[26:00] i'm asking her just kind of lead it up
[26:02] and and uh and i believe that
[26:04] it'll just be a blessing we just want to
[26:06] kind of come alongside her and just work
[26:07] with her
[26:08] and help her a man to be successful in
[26:11] this
[26:11] as she's representing the church you
[26:13] know in this in this endeavor
[26:15] so uh please uh if you if you desire to
[26:17] join uh just be
[26:18] if you can't make it every thirds but
[26:20] maybe you say first thirst i can be
[26:22] there a second thursdays i can be there
[26:24] third thursday or fourth thursday
[26:25] if you have a thursday in your on your
[26:27] mind that you think you can make it you
[26:28] can commit to it let us know
[26:30] we can put a little plan together as
[26:31] we'll know who to expect and when to

[28:06] amen these are the requests that we're
[28:08] we're we're trusting god's going to do
[28:10] something mighty i mean he's a
[28:12] he's he's he's a he's a he's a present
[28:14] tense god
[28:15] and he still moves amen even today so uh
[28:18] but we we want to
[28:19] want to pray brother brother nathan has
[28:21] come here and and um
[28:23] i remember a couple years ago he prayed
[28:25] for sister tanya she couldn't move her
[28:27] shoulder
[28:28] and uh she went home that night after
[28:30] they prayed and
[28:31] there she began to move her shoulder and
[28:33] do things that she couldn't do before
[28:35] so about a year later she remembered his
[28:36] prayer and we went there to
[28:38] indiana and she said i remember him
[28:41] praying for him before now i got this
[28:42] cancer that i'm dealing with and i want
[28:44] to be prayed for again
[28:45] so uh she went on and got got in the
[28:47] prayer line and he got she got prayed
[28:48] for
[28:49] and about two days later she went to the

[28:56] already taken the cancer off of her head

[29:12] brother nathan but it's god hearing his
[29:14] prayer
[29:15] amen and i and i believe that as we come

[37:19] children of the kingdom shall be cast
[37:21] out into outer darkness

[37:25] teeth and jesus said unto the centurion
[37:28] go thy way and as thou has believed
[37:32] so be it done unto thee and his servant
[37:34] was healed
[37:35] in the self-same hour amen the lord had
[37:38] a blessing to the reading of his

[38:23] pray amen
[38:25] amen god bless you can be seated in the
[38:28] presence of the lord
[38:41] man praise the lord so uh again our
[38:44] title here is god
[38:46] still moves and man god
[38:49] still moves i want to just uh
[38:52] open up with a little uh quote here from
[38:55] make the valley full of ditches and man
[38:58] make the valley full of ditches
[39:00] it's a little testimony that the prophet
[39:02] is sharing a man
[39:04] about a particular lady by the name of
[39:05] miss weber and it says
[39:07] a lady in my church uh brother biller
[39:11] miss weber she was dying with tb
[39:14] hallelujah we're trying to reach people
[39:17] that might feel like they're
[39:19] maybe the doctor has given up on them
[39:21] telling there's no hope for the
[39:22] situation that they got
[39:24] uh i i'm here to tell you that the
[39:26] doctor
[39:27] is doing the best that he can a man the
[39:30] doctor
[39:32] has gone to school and his knowledge has
[39:34] limited
[39:35] a man to only so much when it comes to
[39:37] working with the body and working with
[39:39] patients
[39:40] and we appreciate the doctors we thank
[39:42] god for them but they're human beings
[39:44] just like us
[39:45] and there are sometimes we face
[39:46] situations that amen it goes beyond the
[39:49] doctors
[39:50] amen abilities glory to god and we need
[39:53] a god that can come on the scene
[39:55] and change things around so if you're in
[39:58] a situation where the doctors have given
[39:59] up on you i don't care what it is
[40:02] amen if they've given up on you god is
[40:05] able to turn that thing around
[40:07] we say he still moves amen we say he
[40:10] still heals
[40:11] we say he still delivers and and we're
[40:13] not just saying that
[40:15] we've seen it with our own eyes amen and
[40:18] and
[40:18] hallelujah we're not limited to somebody
[40:21] being able to come here and pass through
[40:23] a prayer line
[40:24] we got something even greater amen than
[40:26] somebody touching you with their hands
[40:28] amen we got the spoken word of god amen
[40:32] and if we just speak the word only
[40:34] we can see somebody made whole
[40:36] hallelujah
[40:38] glory to god i believe that so look at
[40:40] this amen
[40:41] now this woman uh that that i'm reading
[40:43] about she was never
[40:45] touched in a prayer line i mean not not
[40:48] when she got healed
[40:48] maybe she had been prayed for before and
[40:50] i believe the quote is going to show
[40:52] she had been prayed for before and she
[40:53] was she was hoping that maybe he just
[40:55] prayed for me one more time
[40:57] hallelujah watch this now watch this
[40:59] testimony says uh miss webber she was
[41:01] dying with tb
[41:03] she was in us in the sanatorium at the
[41:05] last stages
[41:07] they sent her home to die and said
[41:09] there's nothing could be done for her
[41:11] miss grace webb in jeffersonville she
[41:14] lived just beyond the tabernacle
[41:15] and she got five she got five or six
[41:19] little children

[41:23] night and said

[41:34] telling brother branham
[41:35] the man's wife is about to leave what a
[41:38] what a statement now i want you to get
[41:41] this
[41:41] because as you read this you must see
[41:44] in scripture hezekiah was told the same
[41:48] thing by
[41:49] prophet isaiah he said say get your i
[41:52] mean you're going to be
[41:53] you might as well get your house in
[41:54] order you're going to be dying hezekiah

[42:07] done this i walked up right before you i
[42:09] did this i did that i'm not ready to die
[42:12] and and and then then all of a sudden
[42:14] the prophet turns
[42:15] and goes back to hezekiah the king and
[42:18] says
[42:18] god heard your prayer amen god heard
[42:21] your prayer

[42:36] what only god can do
[42:39] look at this amen it says uh says uh uh
[42:43] she lived just beyond the time
[42:44] so an angel lord came uh come to me the
[42:47] night
[42:48] and said go tell miss webber tell mr
[42:50] webber rather to get things ready
[42:52] for he's going to be left with those
[42:53] children on his hand for his wife's

[43:07] seven years ago or more i said now genie
[43:10] your mother's going to die she can't
[43:13] live but a little while longer
[43:15] and two days after that or three days
[43:18] there were some ladies from the
[43:20] government depot there
[43:21] where she worked come in she's say uh
[43:24] grace miss webber
[43:26] said if i could only have brother bill
[43:28] to pray for me once more
[43:31] hallelujah she said i sing when my
[43:34] cousin
[43:34] opal was healed with that cancer and the
[43:37] doctor just gave her
[43:39] till morning till it her faith was still
[43:42] holding on
[43:43] even though the angel of the lord has
[43:45] pronounced through the prophet
[43:47] that she gonna die amen if that was a
[43:51] sure death that was certainly a sure
[43:53] death
[43:53] but this lady's faith is still holding
[43:56] on maybe everybody else around her
[43:58] her husband is preparing for her death
[44:00] her daughter is preparing for her death
[44:03] everybody around her is preparing for
[44:05] her death but she's
[44:07] staying on the inside if he could just
[44:09] pray
[44:10] i know the angel of the lord told you
[44:12] that i was gonna die
[44:13] but still if you can just pray for me
[44:16] one more time brother branham
[44:18] i've seen what god did before i know
[44:20] he's able to do the
[44:22] same thing for me if he did it for my
[44:25] cousin
[44:26] why can't he do it for me hallelujah
[44:29] says i seen when my cousin opal was
[44:31] healed with that cancer
[44:32] the doctor just gave her till morning to
[44:34] live and her daughter's a nurse also
[44:37] said the girls from out of that
[44:38] government where she worked with her
[44:41] said there ain't nothing to that guy so
[44:43] now she said she's saying i wish brother
[44:45] brandon could come
[44:46] and then they start saying ain't nothing
[44:48] to brother branham they start talking
[44:50] about them
[44:51] amen i know you've been in conversations
[44:53] where people begin to talk about the
[44:55] prophets
[44:56] ain't nothing to him he's off he's this
[44:58] he's that amen everybody got something
[45:00] to say
[45:01] but look at this now amen it says uh uh
[45:04] uh there ain't nothing to that guy said
[45:06] he isn't nothing but a hypocrite
[45:08] so that's all that a religion is it's
[45:11] just a bunch of fake fanaticism
[45:13] and so miss webber said what you gonna
[45:16] say when they start talking like that
[45:18] what's your response to that right so
[45:20] miss weber said
[45:21] look i'm a dying and i know that
[45:25] but i just won't stand still for that

[47:44] what she said tell her thus saith the
[47:47] lord
[47:48] she'll live and not die
[47:52] and the very reason that this lady is
[47:55] living
[47:56] is because of her attitude towards god's
[47:58] prophets
[48:00] glory to god her attitude towards the
[48:03] word of god
[48:04] maybe people say the days of miracle has
[48:06] passed

[48:40] what she had said
[48:42] what she said to these women said and he
[48:45] had respect to her
[48:47] because she had respect unto what was
[48:49] representing
[48:50] god glory
[48:54] prophet not here miss webinar here but
[48:57] we here

[49:11] healing if you just give respect to him
[49:13] and his word
[49:14] god will do the work for you amen that's
[49:17] right
[49:18] now when you when you when you when you
[49:20] look at that uh brother branham never
[49:22] went to pray for her again that she
[49:24] desired for him to say you know
[49:26] if you just pray for me one more time
[49:27] after hearing um
[49:30] uh you're gonna die thus says the lord
[49:32] lady you're gonna die
[49:33] if your family need to get themselves in
[49:35] order your husband needs to get in order
[49:37] the kids need to get ready they're gonna
[49:38] lose mama thus
[49:39] saith the lord and she knew that that
[49:42] prophet didn't make mistakes
[49:43] but she said if you just pray for me
[49:45] just one more time because i
[49:46] seen my cousin get well i
[49:50] watched god heal my cousin they had gave
[49:52] her up and she
[49:53] only had one more day to live one more
[49:55] night but she made it through the night
[49:57] perfectly
[49:58] amen perfectly whole he said she said if
[50:00] if god can do that for my cousin i
[50:02] believe he can do the same thing for me
[50:04] she held on to her faith no matter what
[50:06] she hurt
[50:08] oh what faith what faith church right
[50:11] and and god needs people to have that
[50:13] same type of faith if you want to see
[50:14] god do something
[50:16] amen you got to have your faith elevated
[50:18] glory to god
[50:19] hallelujah glory glory glory
[50:22] amen look at this uh this this is
[50:25] quoting the message
[50:26] why hallelujah
[50:31] glory and this message white says i
[50:33] don't care what it is
[50:35] if you say to the mountain be moved
[50:38] and maybe if you got to go over the
[50:40] mountain for a purpose
[50:42] now i say well somebody would say oh i'm
[50:44] a great man of faith i i moved that
[50:46] mountain
[50:46] it will never move it's not going to
[50:48] happen like that it's got to be the
[50:49] right motive
[50:50] it says but if there's something over
[50:52] the mountain that you've got
[50:54] to get over there for to do the will of
[50:56] god
[50:57] and you can't get over it under it
[51:00] around it yet something in your heart is
[51:03] telling you
[51:03] to go you speak the word don't you doubt
[51:07] glory
[51:08] and maybe when you speak the word only
[51:11] one little grain of sand will fall
[51:13] but it's on its road the next day a
[51:16] spoonful may drop
[51:17] the next amen uh the next day a teacup
[51:20] full
[51:21] you will never notice it but if you'll
[51:23] just hold steady
[51:26] hallelujah after you prayed for we want
[51:29] to tell you something
[51:31] hold steady hold standing to what god
[51:34] promised you
[51:35] he was wounded for your transgressions
[51:38] he was bruised for your iniquities
[51:40] the chastisement of your peace is upon
[51:42] him and
[51:43] with his stripes you are healed oh
[51:48] steady he's the lord our god that
[51:51] healeth all of our diseases
[51:53] hold steady don't give up on the word of
[51:57] god
[51:58] no matter how you feel no matter what
[52:00] you think no matter what the doctor's
[52:02] report says
[52:03] hold steady to what god said in his word
[52:07] hallelujah whose report will you believe
[52:09] we believe the report of the lord
[52:11] it says the next day a spoonful may drop
[52:13] the next dead teacup full
[52:14] you will notice it say you you will
[52:16] never notice it but if you were just
[52:18] hold steady knowing that it's being done
[52:20] after a while the whole thing will fall
[52:22] in
[52:22] so that's the way it is by divine
[52:24] healing when you see the working of the
[52:26] holy spirit
[52:28] the word laid on and the holy spirit
[52:30] anointing that word
[52:32] and proving it that he is there in our
[52:34] midst to vindicate himself
[52:36] and to give you the promise then you
[52:38] then you accept your healing
[52:41] i like that word amen accept your
[52:44] healing
[52:47] i was looking at that so to accept
[52:49] something requires action
[52:52] amen it's not something mentally you say
[52:55] i accept my healing no it's
[52:56] amen it's something that requires action
[52:59] hallelujah

[53:40] rebecca sending pictures of the baby
[53:42] that god gave them after prayer
[53:45] hallelujah glory to god we saw god do
[53:49] that

[54:02] something else

[1:03:54] christopher had had no issue
[1:03:58] god is good god still moves god still
[1:04:01] moves
[1:04:02] amen i got a another little uh uh
[1:04:05] testimony here i want to share and god
[1:04:07] just help us i
[1:04:08] got so much in my heart that i want to
[1:04:10] give you uh this was coming from
[1:04:12] brother sean martin amen uh
[1:04:15] he says uh and this is something that
[1:04:16] happened years ago he says i remember
[1:04:18] when my daughter ann was born without a
[1:04:20] hip socket
[1:04:20] 15 years ago see the doctor told us that
[1:04:24] she would need surgery right away
[1:04:26] in order for her to ever walk but said
[1:04:28] that in spite of the surgery
[1:04:30] she would always walk with a limp
[1:04:34] hallelujah says uh he's scheduled for us
[1:04:37] to see a specialist
[1:04:38] my wife was to take her to see the
[1:04:40] specialist on a thursday
[1:04:41] uh and and and so the wednesday night
[1:04:44] before our church
[1:04:45] prayed for her brother wayne and i were
[1:04:48] on the road at that time in texas
[1:04:50] and we were praying as well when the
[1:04:52] specialist came in the room to check on
[1:04:54] her
[1:04:54] he had the original x-ray that showed
[1:04:57] there was no hip
[1:04:58] socket but as he began to probe on her
[1:05:01] hip
[1:05:02] he thought something seemed unusual
[1:05:05] and so he brought in another doctor and
[1:05:08] after probing around
[1:05:09] he too seemed puzzled so they decided to
[1:05:12] do their own x-ray
[1:05:13] and what they saw was that god had
[1:05:15] created
[1:05:17] a hip socket glory
[1:05:22] god still moves say ann is 15 years old
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:27] walks normal with absolutely no problem
[1:05:30] whatsoever
[1:05:32] there is absolutely nothing
[1:05:35] too hard for our lords i'm talking about
[1:05:39] what god did
[1:05:40] 15 years ago the girl is still walking
[1:05:42] around the doctor saying you're gonna
[1:05:44] have a limp if you do walk
[1:05:46] hallelujah but god say no that's not the
[1:05:48] way i made her body
[1:05:50] she's not gonna have no lips she's gonna
[1:05:51] be perfectly made whole
[1:05:53] see the doctor's only going by what he
[1:05:55] can see but god can go beyond what the
[1:05:58] doctor can see
[1:06:01] stinging amen this other testimony comes
[1:06:03] to my mind
[1:06:05] uh brother tim pruitt is he said he had
[1:06:08] a grandson that that
[1:06:09] uh had not walked a man uh by the time
[1:06:12] he turned one years old he
[1:06:14] still wasn't walking wasn't talking or
[1:06:15] anything like that and um
[1:06:18] and and and some kind of way uh they
[1:06:20] they
[1:06:21] the family uh his daughter ended up at
[1:06:23] his house for for a little season while
[1:06:24] they was building the house
[1:06:26] and one morning the mama wasn't feeling
[1:06:28] well his brother tim's uh
[1:06:29] uh wife wasn't feeling well and and said
[1:06:32] usually she get up when he get up but
[1:06:33] just not this morning she didn't get up
[1:06:34] so
[1:06:35] you know i think they kind of uh start
[1:06:37] looking around and
[1:06:38] trying to figure out what's going on and
[1:06:41] and uh
[1:06:41] brother tim uh his daughter came and
[1:06:43] said i think you better come check on
[1:06:44] mama because
[1:06:45] something right something writing with
[1:06:46] mama so uh the mama started talking
[1:06:48] about this this really bad headache that
[1:06:50] she was having
[1:06:51] and just a lot a lot of pain and
[1:06:53] everything so they kind of then they
[1:06:55] took it to the doctor found out she had
[1:06:56] some high blood pressure and
[1:06:57] and all these other things that was
[1:06:58] contributing but she's just really
[1:07:00] having a lot of problems
[1:07:01] so um you know there at the time uh
[1:07:04] brother tim
[1:07:05] said you know what uh we're gonna have a

[1:07:53] popped up in the office
[1:07:55] amen and had to sit there and just get
[1:07:57] comfortable and had a prayer line after
[1:07:59] the brother preaching after they had the
[1:08:00] prayer line just waiting for the
[1:08:01] anointing to come

[1:08:11] another blood pressure pill
[1:08:13] after that service glory
[1:08:17] and not only that because the anointing
[1:08:19] was so strong
[1:08:20] the anointing produced a man walking
[1:08:23] capabilities
[1:08:25] with a grandson god but god touched him

[1:09:10] god still moves
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:16] god still moves before i go further and
[1:09:20] amen some of these other testimonies
[1:09:22] that i want to share
[1:09:24] uh this story came to me this week in in
[1:09:28] in our bible reading
[1:09:30] in second kings 19.
[1:09:34] i want to just read this uh really quick
[1:09:37] but it's a story of this this great
[1:09:40] general
[1:09:40] by the name of rabsheka uh who went
[1:09:44] from assyria uh he went there to israel
[1:09:47] to just kind of tell them look we're
[1:09:48] coming to take over this place
[1:09:50] he was coming on behalf of the king said
[1:09:52] we're coming to take over now if y'all
[1:09:53] want to
[1:09:54] come out and serve us it'll be peaceful
[1:09:57] but uh if if
[1:09:58] if you're not going to just drop your
[1:10:00] arms and come on out of service
[1:10:02] it's going to be some trouble and he
[1:10:03] would just kind of tell them
[1:10:05] you know just different things just to
[1:10:06] try to instill fear in the people of
[1:10:08] israel
[1:10:09] and uh he was just giving all kind of
[1:10:11] threats and and
[1:10:12] some of the leaders of israel approached
[1:10:14] this rap sheka and said please just
[1:10:16] speak to us in the syrian language we
[1:10:18] understand don't don't keep saying that
[1:10:20] in front of all the people uh but the
[1:10:21] man said i i know
[1:10:23] i i came here to talk to him in their
[1:10:25] language because i want them to
[1:10:26] understand how serious this
[1:10:28] is he refused to speak in the syrian
[1:10:30] language he's beginning to speak more
[1:10:32] boldly
[1:10:33] about the plans of taking over israel he
[1:10:36] told uh
[1:10:36] he told the people saying now y'all
[1:10:38] better not listen to hezekiah king
[1:10:40] i know he's probably trying to encourage
[1:10:42] all a man to uh
[1:10:44] to believe in god and and do all these
[1:10:45] things say but you better not listen to
[1:10:47] him
[1:10:47] you better be listening to me but
[1:10:49] hezekiah already told the people
[1:10:51] glory to god no matter what this man say
[1:10:54] don't respond whoo
[1:10:57] can i can i uh can i tell you no matter
[1:10:59] what your doctor say
[1:11:02] don't respond come on somebody amen no
[1:11:05] matter what the reports say

[1:11:10] lord

[1:11:13] respond
[1:11:15] hallelujah if they say this running your
[1:11:16] family
[1:11:18] don't respond to that praise
[1:11:21] god amen you ought to tell them say well
[1:11:24] i'm in a higher family than this
[1:11:26] i come from a different bloodline than
[1:11:29] this
[1:11:30] i come from god and i'm going back to
[1:11:32] god
[1:11:35] hallelujah glory to god so he said don't
[1:11:38] don't give him no response now just let
[1:11:40] him say whatever you're going to say but
[1:11:41] don't respond
[1:11:42] so rabb shekhar told the people don't
[1:11:44] trust in god
[1:11:45] uh uh uh he said just make an agreement
[1:11:48] with us and
[1:11:49] and come on out to the king the king of
[1:11:51] assyria everything would be right and
[1:11:53] then he made the steam say he says
[1:11:55] he asked them i boast we say he says
[1:11:57] what have the gods of
[1:11:59] hammond the gods of our path
[1:12:02] the god of severe sephiroth
[1:12:05] the gods of henna the gods of iva
[1:12:08] or samaria been able to do and
[1:12:11] delivering their people from us what
[1:12:12] what did the god of those cities do
[1:12:14] and i noticed that this was six cities
[1:12:16] that he called out
[1:12:17] amen he called the hammeth our path
[1:12:21] uh henna iva and samaria but now you're
[1:12:25] dealing with the seventh
[1:12:27] glory to god you're dealing with israel
[1:12:29] nah hallelujah you're dealing with gods
[1:12:31] amen complete number here you can't
[1:12:34] touch this group now hallelujah i don't
[1:12:36] care what the
[1:12:37] rest of them amen whatever their
[1:12:39] testimony was
[1:12:40] maybe somebody got the same condition
[1:12:43] that you have
[1:12:44] and maybe amen maybe they didn't make it
[1:12:47] through
[1:12:47] that does not mean that does not
[1:12:51] mean that you won't make it through
[1:12:53] hallelujah
[1:12:54] sometime the devil liked to boast like
[1:12:56] that i took this one out
[1:12:58] i took that one out but they weren't
[1:13:00] serving the god that i'm serving
[1:13:03] they weren't standing on the same
[1:13:04] promise that i'm standing on
[1:13:08] hallelujah rabsheka returned
[1:13:11] to syria and when he got they found that
[1:13:14] they were warring against
[1:13:15] libna amen and and and not only a
[1:13:18] warrant against libna
[1:13:20] but uh also he heard that the king of
[1:13:22] ethiopia is about to come against him
[1:13:24] now here's what what happened a man when
[1:13:26] they when when when he left
[1:13:28] i want to pick this up in second kings
[1:13:29] 19 verse 1 through seven
[1:13:31] hallelujah let's just read this really
[1:13:33] quick
[1:13:35] says it came to pass when king hezekiah
[1:13:37] heard it
[1:13:38] that he ran his clothes and covered
[1:13:40] himself with sackcloth
[1:13:42] and went into the house of lord is there
[1:13:44] a better place to go
[1:13:46] amen when you get bad news go to the
[1:13:48] house of god
[1:13:50] because things can change there in the
[1:13:52] house of god it says it went into the
[1:13:54] house lord and it said eliakim
[1:13:56] which was over the household and shebna
[1:13:58] described and the elders of the priests
[1:14:00] covet with sackcloth
[1:14:02] to isaiah the prophet the son of amos
[1:14:05] amen so i mean i need a word from the
[1:14:07] lord so i'm going to a vindicated
[1:14:09] prophet
[1:14:10] to get this word from the lord it says
[1:14:12] and they said unto him
[1:14:13] thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of
[1:14:16] trouble
[1:14:17] and of rebuke and blasphemy for the
[1:14:19] children are come to
[1:14:21] the birth and there is not uh
[1:14:24] and there is not strength to bring forth
[1:14:26] it may be
[1:14:28] the lord that god will hear all the
[1:14:30] words of raph sheikha
[1:14:32] whom the king of assyria's master have
[1:14:34] sent to reproach
[1:14:35] the living god and will reprove the
[1:14:37] words which the lord thy god hath heard
[1:14:39] where wherefore lift up thy prayer for
[1:14:42] the remnant that
[1:14:43] are left so they want isaiah to pray so
[1:14:46] the servants of king hezekiah
[1:14:48] came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them
[1:14:51] thus shall ye say to your master
[1:14:53] thus saith the lord be not afraid can i
[1:14:57] tell you that amen
[1:14:58] today i don't care what the report is be
[1:15:01] not afraid glory be not afraid of the
[1:15:05] words which i has heard
[1:15:06] and which the servants of the kingdom of
[1:15:08] assyria hath blasphemed me
[1:15:11] i like this statement behold i will send
[1:15:14] a blast
[1:15:15] upon him and he shall hear a rumor
[1:15:18] and shall return to his own land and i
[1:15:20] will cause him to fall by the sword
[1:15:22] in his own land now you know after ra
[1:15:25] after this was prophesied
[1:15:27] rabb shekhar went and he heard about the
[1:15:29] battle uh there with
[1:15:30] assyria uh fighting libna and then he
[1:15:32] heard ethiopia was coming
[1:15:34] and even in the mid cities two uh great
[1:15:37] countries coming against him
[1:15:38] he still sent a second letter to
[1:15:40] hezekiah saying we're coming over there
[1:15:42] to take over
[1:15:42] but god had already given a promise
[1:15:45] through a prophet
[1:15:46] that you ain't coming back here i like
[1:15:48] this you know uh
[1:15:49] when when hezekiah got the second letter
[1:15:52] he went right back and prayed again
[1:15:54] and god heard his prayer and isaiah told
[1:15:56] him uh uh he told him a couple of things
[1:15:58] that i'd love to just repeat to you
[1:15:59] he said one when he says i'm gonna turn
[1:16:02] back he said i will turn thee back
[1:16:04] by the way which thou came and so
[1:16:06] however that devil came he may come in
[1:16:08] one way but he gonna flee seven ways
[1:16:12] diabetes man come one way but it'll flee
[1:16:14] seven ways
[1:16:16] high blood pressure may have come one
[1:16:17] way but it'll flee seven ways
[1:16:20] cancer may have come one way better to
[1:16:22] flee seven ways
[1:16:24] it says i will turn thee back by the way
[1:16:26] which thou came is
[1:16:27] and the other promise they say i'm gonna
[1:16:29] defend this city
[1:16:30] so they say it's hello you ain't gotta
[1:16:32] worry about it i'm gonna take care of
[1:16:34] this battle for you
[1:16:35] god say i'm gonna defend this city i'm
[1:16:38] gonna defend your body
[1:16:39] i'm gonna make your body come in line
[1:16:41] with your confession
[1:16:44] god gonna do this god gonna do this see
[1:16:48] rab sheck as i was reading this this
[1:16:49] week he just
[1:16:50] kind of reminded me of cancer so
[1:16:53] sometimes you know and this is why
[1:16:54] the prophet was told by the angels say
[1:16:56] if you can just get the people to
[1:16:57] believe
[1:16:58] not even cancer would stand before your
[1:17:00] prayer and i had a quote but i don't
[1:17:02] have time to read it all but
[1:17:04] you know you'll find it in god revealing
[1:17:05] himself to his people brother branham
[1:17:06] said when the angel told him that the
[1:17:08] very first case
[1:17:09] he went out to pray for was a woman with
[1:17:11] cancer a nurse that had cancer
[1:17:13] he's saying god heal that lady of cancer
[1:17:15] she still she was still living at that

[1:22:41] report said
[1:22:42] today was a better visit than yesterday
[1:22:44] i was greeted by the nicu nurse and was
[1:22:46] told she was awake
[1:22:48] karen was more or was more alert and
[1:22:50] stayed awake or rested with
[1:22:51] us this is brother tim i mean uh writing
[1:22:53] this it said rested with her eyes
[1:22:55] closed for two and a half hours i stayed
[1:22:57] by a side she was able to give the nurse
[1:22:59] thumbs up with both hands
[1:23:01] and wiggled each of her toes she talked
[1:23:03] more today
[1:23:04] but still really only answers questions
[1:23:07] she told me her date of birth how long
[1:23:10] we have been married
[1:23:11] her eyes were open more wider for
[1:23:13] example i showed a picture of baby brook
[1:23:16] and she said that's my brookie and then
[1:23:20] blew two kisses
[1:23:21] looking out in the hall there was three
[1:23:23] nurses standing talking and she asked
[1:23:25] who they were
[1:23:25] so she's beginning to be conscious of
[1:23:28] her surroundings
[1:23:30] on monday they would put in a stomach
[1:23:32] feeding tube
[1:23:33] which will remove the irritating nose
[1:23:36] feeding tube
[1:23:37] plans are being made to move her to a
[1:23:39] nursing care facility
[1:23:40] for rehab this will probably not take
[1:23:42] place until monday
[1:23:44] don't be surprised though to hear that
[1:23:46] she has been moved to a regular room in
[1:23:48] the next day or two

[1:24:03] they needed her to just be able to
[1:24:05] swallow at a certain time if she could
[1:24:07] swallow
[1:24:07] then she wouldn't have to go through
[1:24:08] certain things god touched her body

[1:34:03] and she had a supernatural experience
[1:34:06] one night
[1:34:07] while she was sleeping
[1:34:10] she had a supernatural experience while
[1:34:12] she was sleeping and said now after that
[1:34:13] supernatural experience she said i think
[1:34:14] something that happened
[1:34:15] i think i was healed and the doctor's
[1:34:17] report showed that was here but the
[1:34:18] supernatural experience was captured on
[1:34:20] the camera
[1:34:21] the security camera that's in their
[1:34:23] bedroom
[1:34:26] while the lady was sleeping snowflakes
[1:34:29] was falling on her
[1:34:32] and the camera picked it up while the
[1:34:35] snowflakes are falling god was bringing
[1:34:37] the healing
[1:34:40] captured by the camera
[1:34:43] i am telling you god still
[1:34:46] moves
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:50] that's why we have in this prayer line
[1:34:52] that's why we're doing what we're doing
[1:34:54] because god still moves we rebuke the
[1:34:58] spirit of fear
[1:35:00] god has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:35:02] but a love power and a sound mind
[1:35:06] somebody gonna be healed somebody gonna
[1:35:10] be delivered
[1:35:11] somebody gonna be set free you got to
[1:35:14] approach it with the right attitude
[1:35:16] watch god do what god says he will do
[1:35:19] i'm reading you testimonies from a week
[1:35:22] ago or two weeks ago
[1:35:23] last month god is still moving
[1:35:30] see this is why jesus uses this
[1:35:33] statement here in scripture
[1:35:34] amen as we read it there in in matthew 8
[1:35:38] uh you know this this man that centurion
[1:35:41] it says uh
[1:35:43] uh when you read the whole story over in
[1:35:45] the book of luke
[1:35:46] it reads a little differently in luke
[1:35:48] but just kind of putting both of the
[1:35:50] stories together
[1:35:52] luke chapter seven you'll read it there
[1:35:53] but putting both of the stories together
[1:35:55] the man say you know i maybe he's
[1:35:58] thinking to himself adam did some things
[1:35:59] to the jewish people
[1:36:01] that i i'm not too proud of i had to do
[1:36:03] it because it was my job
[1:36:05] it says you know i did these things i'm
[1:36:06] not too proud i don't think this man
[1:36:09] would ever come to my
[1:36:10] house and say right here i got a servant
[1:36:12] one of
[1:36:13] the jewish servants that's here in my
[1:36:14] house man i love this man
[1:36:16] i really care for this man and and i
[1:36:18] don't want to see him die in the
[1:36:20] condition that he dying in
[1:36:22] he said he maybe start talking around
[1:36:23] house do y'all think
[1:36:26] that y'all can get jesus to come pray
[1:36:28] for him i mean i
[1:36:29] took him to the best doctors they can't
[1:36:30] do anything but do you think
[1:36:32] jesus could do something for my servant
[1:36:35] here he said i i mean i
[1:36:36] i send you a man with an entourage
[1:36:39] please go get jesus from me
[1:36:41] please just try to get him to come to my
[1:36:43] house and and uh and just pray for my
[1:36:45] servant i
[1:36:46] i don't want this for me i want this for
[1:36:49] my servant
[1:36:50] because i love him so much i want to see
[1:36:52] him
[1:36:53] made whole please go get jesus i don't
[1:36:56] think he'll
[1:36:57] take notice of me if i showed up but i
[1:36:59] believe he'll he'll have a special place
[1:37:01] in his heart for you because
[1:37:02] you're one of his people they say
[1:37:06] we'll go they went out to to go get
[1:37:08] jesus
[1:37:09] and as they go they say jesus this man
[1:37:11] is a good man this centurion's a good
[1:37:13] man
[1:37:13] he doesn't took cabbage he don't did
[1:37:14] this he done did that and you know he
[1:37:16] even helped build some of the
[1:37:18] you know provide money to help build
[1:37:19] some of the buildings that we got our
[1:37:20] temples and everything
[1:37:21] this man is a good man he said well uh
[1:37:24] i'll come and i'll go
[1:37:27] so maybe the man is at home thinking i
[1:37:28] don't know what's gonna happen my
[1:37:30] servant gonna die i just don't wanna see
[1:37:31] him die like this
[1:37:32] and it sees this big group of people
[1:37:34] coming because wherever jesus go it's
[1:37:36] going to be a big group following
[1:37:38] amen big group following that because
[1:37:40] they know something getting ready to
[1:37:41] happen
[1:37:42] so he said he said i'll go and heal him
[1:37:44] and and i noticed that he wasn't just
[1:37:46] coming
[1:37:47] to see him he was coming to heal him
[1:37:50] glory to god amen i don't want you just
[1:37:53] joining
[1:37:54] just to see what's going on i want you
[1:37:56] to expect your healing
[1:37:59] glory so the man said he said he said he
[1:38:01] said uh
[1:38:02] jesus is coming to his house and he got
[1:38:04] up and he saw this big
[1:38:05] this big group he said now i feel so bad
[1:38:08] about jesus coming to my house i just
[1:38:10] don't think that this is going to be
[1:38:12] proper i don't i just i know he i
[1:38:15] he oh i just just i could see him having
[1:38:18] all kind of mind battles
[1:38:20] he had to come up with a plan so he
[1:38:22] approaches the lord jesus
[1:38:23] he runs out and meets the crowd before
[1:38:25] they get to us i said jesus i'm not
[1:38:27] worthy
[1:38:28] that you should come underneath my roof
[1:38:31] i'm not worthy i i realize i'm not
[1:38:33] worthy i i
[1:38:34] i don't deserve you coming underneath my
[1:38:36] rope my roof but but but jesus i want to
[1:38:37] tell you something
[1:38:39] it says i'm a man of authority he says
[1:38:42] i tell this one to come and he cometh
[1:38:45] i tell that one to go and he goeth i
[1:38:48] tell this one to do that
[1:38:49] and he do with it it says he says if you
[1:38:52] could just speak the word only
[1:38:55] because i recognize you have the same
[1:38:57] authority
[1:38:58] demons have to power at your name
[1:39:01] hallelujah devils have to bow at your
[1:39:04] name
[1:39:04] how if you speak the word i believe my
[1:39:07] servant will be made whole
[1:39:09] jesus looked and said i knock at that
[1:39:11] seed jesus just kind of hold his mouth
[1:39:12] open
[1:39:14] because the bible said he was marveling
[1:39:17] he said now i ain't seen this kind of
[1:39:19] faith nowhere in
[1:39:22] israel it says but this is the kind of
[1:39:24] faith that we're looking for
[1:39:26] he says man go find it the way that you
[1:39:29] believe it
[1:39:30] and then that self-same hour when that
[1:39:32] man spoke that he found his servant made
[1:39:35] whole
[1:39:36] jesus performed a virtual prayer line
[1:39:40] that man was made whole i want to tell
[1:39:43] you that same god still lives today
[1:39:45] and we're going to do this virtual
[1:39:46] prayer line expecting god
[1:39:49] to bring healing to his people
[1:39:54] let's just read a couple quotes one
[1:39:57] coming from the message
[1:39:58] new ministry
[1:40:04] and then i'll go back to who is god amen
[1:40:07] the other quote there this
[1:40:08] new ministry says the american people
[1:40:11] has been
[1:40:12] taught a jewish custom of laying on of
[1:40:16] hands that's not a gentile custom that
[1:40:19] says the jews remember jair said come
[1:40:21] lay your hands on my girl and she'll
[1:40:23] live
[1:40:24] but the gentiles said i'm not worthy
[1:40:26] that you come under my roof just speak
[1:40:28] the word
[1:40:29] and my servant will live that's the
[1:40:31] difference the ministry has not
[1:40:33] been my ministry to lay hands on the
[1:40:35] sick it's been to make
[1:40:36] by a divine gift to bring presents the
[1:40:39] lord jesus christ
[1:40:40] in presence by discernment of spirit
[1:40:42] which is called in the bible a gift of
[1:40:44] knowledge
[1:40:45] and in doing so makes him manifested
[1:40:47] before the people
[1:40:49] and then they receive him as the healer
[1:40:51] healer that settles it
[1:40:53] amen so so so this this this approach is
[1:40:56] true
[1:40:56] gentile faith speak the word only even
[1:40:59] though you don't have to come and touch
[1:41:00] them
[1:41:00] lay hands on them but speak the word
[1:41:02] only they'll be made whole
[1:41:04] brother troy was recently sharing with
[1:41:06] me say i was telling about
[1:41:07] just what was in my heart to share today
[1:41:09] and he said please share testimony about
[1:41:11] my mom
[1:41:12] and uh and see so say you know we prayed
[1:41:14] for them church they was
[1:41:15] suffering from covet cecil had to go to
[1:41:17] the hospital and
[1:41:18] and they were just telling him that they
[1:41:20] might have to send him home with oxygen
[1:41:22] uh they didn't know what was going to
[1:41:23] happen to him and and and
[1:41:25] and my belt she was at home suffering
[1:41:27] with the covet my
[1:41:28] my sister was suffering just just just
[1:41:30] went through the house just didn't know
[1:41:32] what was going on
[1:41:33] he says all of a sudden god touched my
[1:41:35] bed and she's feeling
[1:41:36] a hundred percent better say god touched
[1:41:38] cease so he came out the hospital
[1:41:40] without oxygen
[1:41:44] without oxygen god turned the whole
[1:41:47] thing around brother troy say i know it
[1:41:48] was nothing
[1:41:49] nothing less than the prayers of the
[1:41:51] saints that did that
[1:41:53] god still moves
[1:41:56] god still moves i mean i'm gonna tell
[1:41:59] you you ain't going
[1:42:00] nowhere until god is finished with you
[1:42:02] hallelujah
[1:42:03] amen and what god trying to do is get
[1:42:05] this word to people amen he's trying to
[1:42:07] get him to in tune with his word before
[1:42:09] he
[1:42:09] calls him home god want to make sure
[1:42:11] that you're ready to go glory to god so
[1:42:13] we're we rebuking covert from anybody
[1:42:15] anybody come and come near us we're
[1:42:17] rebuking it in the name of jesus not
[1:42:19] just covet anything else that's
[1:42:20] attacking your body
[1:42:21] we rebuking it this last uh quote here
[1:42:25] amen who is god thank you jesus
[1:42:31] amen let me just make sure
[1:42:35] all right
[1:42:39] uh he says in this roman italian
[1:42:42] whatever uh he was he said lord i'm not
[1:42:45] worthy
[1:42:46] that you come under my roof and neither
[1:42:48] neither thought i worthy to come to face
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:51] in other words i sent you a church to
[1:42:53] meet you and to ask this question but i
[1:42:55] have faith
[1:42:56] i know that you're a man under authority
[1:42:59] but i'm under authority and you don't
[1:43:00] have to come down to my house to put
[1:43:01] your hands on my servant
[1:43:03] you don't have to come here and say any
[1:43:04] prayer hallelujah
[1:43:06] you don't have to come here and say any
[1:43:08] prayer notice now be sure to get this he
[1:43:10] said i'm a man
[1:43:11] under authority also and if i say to
[1:43:13] this man you go do it he will do it
[1:43:15] and if i say this man you come here he
[1:43:17] will come i'm under authority
[1:43:19] and them who are under me has to obey me
[1:43:24] and he knew that that was the son of god
[1:43:27] and that every sickness and
[1:43:30] every demon was under him
[1:43:34] and all he had to do is just speak the
[1:43:36] word
[1:43:37] glory to god not pray
[1:43:40] just speak the word that's all and it
[1:43:43] would be dumb because every demon would
[1:43:45] have to obey him
[1:43:46] do you believe that tonight every demon
[1:43:50] will obey god it has to
[1:43:53] and look at this everything obeys god
