[24:12] Wednesday ministering for us uh so keep
[24:15] that in mind uh uh last
[24:20] Wednesday the the Lord did something uh
[24:24] for us on on Wednesday night and uh
[24:28] while we were here um just I was I
[24:32] usually keep all my notes on my computer
[24:34] all the scriptures and everything that I
[24:35] want to read but um as I got here uh in
[24:39] the pull pit the Lord just began to say
[24:41] no no just read it from the Bible read
[24:43] it from the Bible and as I just was
[24:45] obedient to that I was kind of looking
[24:48] at some of the scriptures I had and one
[24:49] of the last scriptures that I had uh to
[24:51] read on Wednesday night um it was a very
[24:54] important scripture because it it uh
[24:57] took me back to a
[24:59] situation where God had spoke to us
[25:02] about uh write some things down uh
[25:06] things that you need from the Lord uh
[25:09] things you're praying about write it
[25:10] down and place it in the scripture and
[25:13] Hezekiah uh did this he received some
[25:16] letters from sonakar rib and when he got
[25:19] these letters this man was just making
[25:21] all kind of threats and and Hezekiah
[25:23] knew that you know the man was capable
[25:25] of doing the things that he said he was
[25:27] going to do but Hezekiah told the people
[25:29] whatever you do just don't say nothing
[25:31] to them don't respond to them and uh he
[25:33] said but God he Hezekiah told him said
[25:35] we got more with us than they got with
[25:36] them y'all just be encouraged be
[25:38] encouraged don't don't be dismayed we
[25:40] got more with us and uh he and he says
[25:43] uh Hezekiah took it and spread it before
[25:44] the Lord and what I found is that this
[25:46] story in scripture is recorded three
[25:48] times in the Old Testament uh it's
[25:51] recorded we read it out of
[25:53] chonicles uh on Friday I mean Wednesday
[25:56] night but it's also o found over in 2
[25:59] Kings uh I think chapter 19 and then
[26:03] when I got home my daughter was sharing
[26:05] a testimony with me how the night before
[26:09] we come on Wednesday she was at home on
[26:12] Tuesday and um and she was just reading
[26:14] through her Bible and she found in her
[26:17] Bible uh Isaiah
[26:21] 40 uh 36 and 37 uh Isaiah 36 and 37 it's
[26:26] found there again I y'all thank youall
[26:28] just leave it there on the screen but
[26:29] Isaiah 36 and 37 speaks of the same
[26:32] story and she was at home on Tuesday
[26:35] night reading this and as she was
[26:38] reading it on Tuesday night she felt
[26:40] impressed in her heart write something
[26:42] and put it on scripture and she come to
[26:44] the church on Wednesday night and the
[26:47] Holy Ghost picks it up again and say
[26:49] write something down and put it on
[26:51] scripture now we feel like God spoke to
[26:53] us so I'm bringing that forward again
[26:55] this morning for those that were not not
[26:57] here Wednesday night your scripture to
[26:59] write something down is n 2 Kings 19:14
[27:02] and I say ask God for impossible
[27:05] things big
[27:08] things big
[27:11] things and I and I I wrote some things
[27:14] down I'm asking God to do some things
[27:17] for for for for for for me my wife for
[27:20] my family for the business I'm asking
[27:23] God for some big things for the church I
[27:26] got than before the Lord and and I've
[27:29] done this before and I've watched God
[27:31] just take things right off my list I
[27:32] remember I asked the Lord one time Lord
[27:34] bless me um it was time for my kids to
[27:36] start driving I needed I needed to get
[27:38] cars for them I asked God to bless me
[27:41] with to be able to get those cars you
[27:42] know what I got cars for all of them
[27:44] when it was time for them to come so I
[27:46] don't seen God answer these prayers
[27:48] before Hallelujah
[27:50] somebody amen I believe I asked the Lord
[27:53] for full-time Ministry you know I got
[27:56] that

[27:59] and and I also ask him to pay off my
[28:01] house he working on that he working on
[28:05] [Applause]
[28:07] that glory to God but I tell you what I
[28:11] mean I I you know we we did this uh
[28:13] under inspiration years ago brother
[28:14] Diggs was the first one to mention the
[28:16] scripture to us and then brother chende
[28:18] came through and mentioned it again
[28:20] years later and then Wednesday night the
[28:22] Lord brought it back around again so uh
[28:25] I'm I'm trusting and believing that we
[28:27] are going to see uh results uh from what
[28:31] the Lord has placed in our heart amen
[28:33] also uh the announcements we just want
[28:35] to make uh you uh mindful of um of
[28:41] streaming will continue through Twitter
[28:42] Facebook and in our church website John

[29:00] to
[29:02] um I know the Catholics during this time
[29:05] of year they go through lent and and I'm
[29:08] sensitive to not uh trying to have our
[29:10] fast look like lent I I'm very sensitive
[29:14] to that because I know how some people
[29:16] can can take that however I do want to
[29:18] say this I do want to say this uh when I
[29:20] was working at um you know this mega
[29:23] church and they used to take their
[29:25] Church through this you know every year
[29:27] and as an employee there I was it was a
[29:31] mandate that every employee had to go
[29:33] through the fast like you can't work
[29:35] here and and not Embrace what we're
[29:38] trying to do it just didn't make sense
[29:40] you know you're not even agreement with
[29:42] what we're doing here so they would they
[29:44] made it very clear and they they they
[29:45] would do this and I remember when I
[29:47] first did it the first time uh the thing
[29:50] that kind of struck me the most is like
[29:52] I know what we have when it comes to the
[29:55] word of the Lord
[29:58] but also
[30:01] know how we lack in what we give let me
[30:06] what we give back to the Lord how we
[30:08] lack in what we give back to the Lord
[30:11] and uh if no one else will be honest I
[30:13] can be honest with myself there was a
[30:16] lack in some areas of my life and uh
[30:19] fasting is something that Jesus did fast
[30:21] is something that brother brandom did
[30:22] fasting is something that just it's in
[30:24] scripture so when when I heard about it
[30:26] I said you know Lord I got to be able to
[30:28] do better than this so I I decided that
[30:30] I wanted to you know bring this to the
[30:32] church and and it's been I think very
[30:35] very rewarding uh for us but the uh the
[30:38] other thing is that I don't want it to
[30:39] look like we we're not trying to be
[30:42] Catholic anyway but I will say this that
[30:45] even if
[30:46] Catholics can sacrifice
[30:51] things what about the real
[30:54] bride amen so praise the Lord just just
[30:58] something to think about uh so our fast
[31:01] continues March uh through March 9th
[31:04] amen and um and like we said it's not
[31:07] anything whatever the Lord leads you to
[31:09] do summer fasting technology uh no
[31:12] social media that's a good fast no
[31:15] social media for 21 days some are
[31:16] fasting what they eat they're changing
[31:18] their diet and nothing wrong with that
[31:20] some are not eating anything uh until a
[31:22] certain amount of time whatever the Lord
[31:24] leads you to do this is not Le ISM in
[31:27] any way but whatever the Lord leads you
[31:29] to do we just encourage us all to be a
[31:32] part of it amen praise the Lord if you
[31:35] got a TV fast your
[31:37] TV
[31:39] amen praise the
[31:41] Lord all
[31:44] right Sunday school continues amen uh

[32:13] don't send them you take them don't send
[32:18] your kids to Sunday school take your
[32:21] kids to Sunday school amen it shows that

[32:51] there uh we are really close to getting
[32:54] a new app up and running some of you all
[32:56] might might have noticed our old app is
[32:58] no longer working we tried to move to
[33:00] the new platform but they just would not
[33:02] give us the King James version of the
[33:04] Bible and uh for us that was a deal
[33:07] breaker amen we must have the
[33:10] KJV uh because some of the other script
[33:12] Bibles that they have nowadays they have
[33:14] taken out scriptures and um U they've
[33:17] just completely changed the meaning of
[33:19] what what what the word was saying so we
[33:21] we want to stay KJV amen that's what God
[33:25] gave his Prophet that's what the prophet
[33:26] gave USS is KJV so uh so we almost in
[33:30] the process of getting that completed
[33:32] and uh I'll let you let you all know
[33:34] once that's once that's uh said and done
[33:36] our giving is multiple ways those that
[33:39] are in the house of the Lord if you
[33:41] desire to give physically there's a box
[33:43] on the back table as you're going out

[33:47] the Box those that are online also in
[33:50] the house you desire you can use cash
[33:52] app dollar sign spirit and truth t as
[33:54] well as zel which is uh giving at John
[33:56] 14 42 3.org and we also receive giving
[33:59] through PayPal also giving at John 423
[34:01] org we list PayPal last because PayPal

[48:38] praise the Lord uh before you before we
[48:41] read the scripture I wanted to give
[48:42] glory to the Lord a couple testimonies
[48:45] real quick my sister Sharon uh some of
[48:48] you know her was diagnosed early on last
[48:50] year excuse me in the middle of the year
[48:52] with stage four cancer and she went
[48:55] through through some of the chemo and we
[48:57] took her before the Lord and I'm sure
[48:59] most of you heard the testimony but she
[49:02] is now completely cancer free and God
[49:04] has healed her completely hallelujah
[49:08] amen so we give glory to God I want to
[49:10] give glory to him today
[49:12] amen hallelujah you
[49:16] know
[49:18] Hallelujah just when when that kind of
[49:21] thing hits your own family it it changes
[49:24] it and uh our dad my dad passed away
[49:27] about four years ago here just the other
[49:28] day four years it's been so that was a
[49:30] big thing for our family but when you
[49:32] have that kind of news from one of your
[49:34] siblings it was pretty serious for us
[49:37] and we are just giving glory to God I
[49:39] just like to always give the devil a
[49:41] black eye and tell him he's a liar
[49:42] praise the
[49:44] Lord and then I was telling brother Jack
[49:46] my daughter and her and my son-in-law
[49:48] had to go home early this this morning
[49:50] they were going to be here with us in
[49:51] service they've been vacationing with us
[49:53] and she had a real bad accident acent
[49:55] just a couple Sundays ago on the way
[49:57] home and I can't put the picture up but
[50:00] if You' seen the picture you know as
[50:01] well as me she come away from that
[50:04] without any bones broken or anything
[50:06] truck was total and there's just a lot
[50:08] of things that happened in that accident
[50:10] that once again God spared her life God
[50:13] spared my daughter uh my granddaughter
[50:16] would have been in the truck but she had
[50:17] went with somebody else home and uh then
[50:20] she was in the truck instead of their
[50:22] little Prius and that was of God because
[50:24] if it had been the Prius he certainly
[50:25] would have lost her life as well so it's
[50:28] a joy this week cuz we wouldn't have had
[50:29] her to spend this time with but it was a
[50:31] joy to spend with her my daughter and
[50:34] granddaughter it's just a joy praise the
[50:37] Lord
[50:40] amen I just want to say couple more
[50:44] things that uh the your pastor keeps us

[51:14] that there's there is a building for you
[51:17] and I just want to
[51:19] say it may be a wait but it's going to
[51:21] be worth the wait it's going to be worth
[51:23] the wait I believe that that's I what I
[51:28] believe the Lord told me to tell you cuz
[51:30] brother Jack and y'all are having to
[51:32] wait a little longer than you expected
[51:33] but it will be worth the wait God knows
[51:36] how to do things in big ways praise the
[51:39] Lord

[53:15] pick it up here in 31 excuse me yeah
[53:18] verse 30 verse 30 and as he as he spake
[53:22] these words many believed on him so
[53:26] there was he spoke some words here and
[53:28] there were many that were Believing on
[53:29] it and and then said Jesus to those Jews
[53:33] which believed on him if ye continue in
[53:36] my word then are ye my disciples indeed
[53:41] so he's taken people who believe oh this
[53:43] is good yes I believe what's going on
[53:45] but he wants to let them know it's not
[53:47] him that starts the journey it's him
[53:49] that continues in the word so that
[53:52] teaches us that the being in the word of
[53:54] the hour is a
[53:56] journey it's not a one night event
[53:59] that's exactly right God bless you
[54:01] brother Mark it's not a one night event
[54:03] it's a journey and so now he wants to
[54:05] let them know if you continue in the
[54:08] word then are you truly disciples it's
[54:12] not that you're one night and then next
[54:14] week and you're gone and you're in five
[54:16] years and you're in and out and
[54:17] everything else no no there's a mark of
[54:19] a real believer that's got something
[54:21] that he continues in the word because
[54:23] it's a journey and then goes on to say
[54:25] he said ye shall know the truth and the
[54:28] truth shall make you
[54:30] free they answered him we be Abraham's
[54:33] seed and we're never in bondage to any
[54:36] man what are you saying that ye shall be
[54:38] made free telling religious leaders that
[54:41] they're
[54:42] bound Jesus is bold he tells them the
[54:45] truth yes you don't look bound but
[54:47] you're bound amen you need Freedom
[54:50] through truth right we be Abraham's seed
[54:53] we're never in bondage to any man how
[54:54] sayest th you shall be made free Jesus
[54:57] answered them verily verily I say unto
[54:58] you whosoever committeth sin is the
[55:01] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[55:04] not in the house forever but the son
[55:06] abideth forever and if the son therefore
[55:09] shall make you free ye shall be free
[55:12] indeed which means you'll be truly free
[55:15] you're not truly free until you come in
[55:18] touch with the son of man and he's out
[55:20] to make you completely and truly free
[55:24] our heavenly father father we feel very
[55:27] moved by your spirit this morning
[55:29] Hallelujah I love to come and hear the
[55:31] singing Here Lord and the worship and
[55:33] the music Lord for God you have done
[55:36] something in our hearts we have
[55:37] something to sing about I pray father
[55:40] that I would just lend my gift to you
[55:41] this morning that it would be a blessing
[55:43] to the local body here father for we
[55:46] love them we've been praying for them
[55:47] Lord and we've I hope that I can help
[55:50] some portion of how the pastor here has
[55:53] helped our church and helped the young
[55:54] people people bless him and his wife and
[55:57] the family and the church here and Lord
[55:59] you know the needs that are here father
[56:01] you you know God before we even ask so I
[56:05] pray father you pave away for whatever
[56:07] needs be there in the name of Jesus
[56:10] Christ bless the service today in Jesus
[56:12] name amen amen amen you may be
[56:16] seated I've been preaching at home a
[56:18] little bit on the uh preaching about
[56:21] freedom and preaching about bondage a
[56:24] little bit and uh I've been uh just
[56:27] researching and praying to the Lord and
[56:30] just actually uh exploring the different
[56:33] forms of bondage because one of the
[56:36] things I think that we do sometimes is
[56:38] that we all have a certain perception of
[56:40] what bondage is and what someone is
[56:43] bound by and we have a certain way that
[56:45] we think about it and often we think of
[56:47] somebody who's physically bound someone
[56:49] who's in prison there physically you can
[56:51] see that they're in prison uh someone
[56:54] who H has chains on them physical chains
[56:58] it's easy to see that they're in bondage
[57:01] but we we want to present to you this
[57:03] morning that there are other invisible
[57:06] forms of bondage that sometimes we don't
[57:10] see sometimes we don't understand and I
[57:14] think when we come into the presence of
[57:16] the Lord and come into the presence of
[57:18] the son of man if he wants us to set set
[57:21] us free which he does then a part of his
[57:24] ministry will expose all forms of
[57:29] bondage because if we don't know it then
[57:31] we don't know we're Bound by it so one
[57:33] of the blessings of the Lord is that he
[57:36] not only wants to set us free but he
[57:38] can't completely set us free unless he
[57:40] shows us what the bondage is and uh
[57:44] there's another scripture that I use in
[57:46] this series I've been using in that it's
[57:48] just a few chapters before and it says
[57:50] the son of man came to heal all manner
[57:53] of disease
[57:56] he covers it all he comes all forms of
[58:00] bondage it doesn't matter if it's
[58:02] physical sickness it doesn't matter if
[58:04] it's emotional sickness it doesn't mean
[58:07] matter if it's Financial bondage it
[58:10] doesn't matter to God what form of
[58:12] bondage it is let me say this if it's
[58:15] binding you at all he's interested in
[58:18] setting you free from that
[58:20] bondage he so loves you that he's going
[58:23] to show you things that are binding you
[58:26] that you didn't even know were binding
[58:27] you you say that can that be true
[58:29] brother Paul well it's true here with
[58:31] these Jews because they didn't know they
[58:33] were
[58:34] bound and they didn't know what they
[58:36] were Bound by and Jesus is the one who
[58:39] had to tell them the truth you're bound
[58:42] and then they get defensive about it
[58:44] we're not under bondage we're of the
[58:46] we're of the Seed of Abraham we're not
[58:48] under any man we're not under Herod or
[58:50] anybody like that we're we're we're free
[58:52] we're free and Jesus said you're not
[58:54] free
[58:55] because I'm the word of the hour I'm the
[58:58] son of man and some reason for some
[59:00] reason you're resisting me so if you're
[59:03] resisting this word you're not free
[59:06] there's something holding you back and
[59:08] this morning there may be something
[59:10] holding you back you can't quite get
[59:13] where you need to be because there's
[59:15] something holding you back amen amen
[59:17] amen uh I'm a a pastor many years now 30
[59:21] I forgot how many years but 30 something
[59:23] years 35 years years and you learn to
[59:26] watch people's lives and you learn to
[59:28] watch your own life but there's
[59:29] sometimes people come they worship
[59:32] they're there but you see now when you
[59:34] look deeper like uh Solomon looked
[59:36] deeper into men's lives by the
[59:38] discernment of the Lord you can see
[59:40] sometimes people in their Spirit their
[59:42] facial expression sometimes not even
[59:44] that they can come for many many years
[59:46] but you see ah they're they're not quite
[59:48] as free as they could be wow wow wow
[59:50] there's still something there that's
[59:52] holding them back wow H and if I don't
[59:55] get to say it this morning I believe
[59:57] that the the the freedom and uh uh in
[1:00:00] Christ is to make us completely I
[1:00:03] believe there's no limits to how free a
[1:00:06] human being can be in the
[1:00:09] Lord and I don't just mean we're free to
[1:00:12] worship and we're free I believe I I
[1:00:14] believe that affects it but there's
[1:00:15] there a lot of people that I've seen
[1:00:16] worship they seem to worship so freely
[1:00:19] but they're bound on the
[1:00:20] inside so we got to have it all we can't
[1:00:23] just take the worship we just can't be
[1:00:25] uh praised in the Lord with our voice
[1:00:27] but we're held back somewhere else he
[1:00:30] wants to make us completely free so uh I
[1:00:33] spent quite a bit of time on the Satan's
[1:00:35] bondage and the different forms I'll
[1:00:37] never get to all of them today but I
[1:00:39] want to mention some of them to you that
[1:00:41] I found in the scripture and also in the
[1:00:43] message and spent quite a bit of time
[1:00:46] just exposing the different forms of
[1:00:48] Satan's bondage bondage does not always
[1:00:51] look like bondage uh there are some
[1:00:53] people that's physic physically in
[1:00:55] prison but uh how many knows people can
[1:00:58] go to prison but then there's a such a
[1:01:01] thing called house
[1:01:03] arrest okay so there's a house arrest so
[1:01:06] they're allowed to go home and they're
[1:01:08] allowed to maybe go to work maybe
[1:01:09] depending on the court order they're
[1:01:12] they're allowed to be in their home and
[1:01:13] exist and there might be a little
[1:01:15] monitor on their ankle because they got
[1:01:17] to keep track of where they're at GL but
[1:01:19] you don't see that monitor around their
[1:01:21] ankle but they're in bondage nonetheless
[1:01:23] they're in prison none
[1:01:25] even though they still get to go to work
[1:01:27] and they still they get to function
[1:01:29] their home some kids still get to go to
[1:01:30] school to college but yet that you can't
[1:01:33] see that they're bound but they are
[1:01:36] still under bondage and that should tell
[1:01:39] us something that sometimes bondages you
[1:01:42] just can't see with the naked
[1:01:46] eye amen and in John chapter 8 we see
[1:01:49] then that uh they they open this with
[1:01:52] Jesus showing the telling the leaders
[1:01:54] the Jewish leaders you need to be set
[1:01:56] free free we're Jews we're preachers to
[1:01:58] the Jews what gives you a right Jesus to
[1:02:01] say this reason they said that they were
[1:02:03] in bondage to something that they were
[1:02:04] not aware of they were defensive because
[1:02:08] they were not aware of the type of
[1:02:10] bondage that they were in WoW amen they
[1:02:14] only knew bondage in slavery is maybe uh
[1:02:16] slaves to Rome or slave in a home back
[1:02:19] then they had certain types of servants
[1:02:21] and slavery within the house I'm going
[1:02:23] to get to that in a minute because Jesus
[1:02:24] Jus refers to it he said the son in the
[1:02:26] house he's free but there's servants in
[1:02:28] the house and the servants they never
[1:02:31] get total ownership to the home that's
[1:02:33] right they never get to be called a son
[1:02:35] so they're always continually in bondage
[1:02:38] while while living they can live in a
[1:02:40] mansion but because they have the title
[1:02:43] of a servant they'll always remain in
[1:02:46] bondage but I'll go ahead and tell you
[1:02:49] he who the son sets
[1:02:51] free if there's a if there's a son
[1:02:55] that's in the house that's not bound by
[1:02:58] anything he has the right to walk up to
[1:03:01] a servant and give them their
[1:03:04] freedom brother he has the right to say
[1:03:07] you're not a slave anymore you're not a
[1:03:09] servant anymore this day I set you free
[1:03:13] and now you're a part of the household
[1:03:15] you're part of the body you're part of
[1:03:17] the body of Christ yes that's him making
[1:03:20] us Sons and Daughters of God that's him
[1:03:23] bringing us out of Egypt From Slavery to
[1:03:25] Sons and Daughters of God isn't this the
[1:03:28] whole Ministry of the first Exodus the
[1:03:31] second Exodus the Third Exodus what is
[1:03:34] it to bring us out of
[1:03:36] bondage to the freedom of Sons and
[1:03:38] Daughters of God hallelujah so we see
[1:03:42] then that John 8 these they've got a
[1:03:45] bondage they don't know about and I
[1:03:47] don't want to spend a lot of time at it
[1:03:48] because you realize what it is they were
[1:03:50] under bondage of course by an
[1:03:51] unconverted nature of the serpent and
[1:03:53] they had religion relig and they had
[1:03:55] Pride with that religion and that caused
[1:03:57] them not to believe the truth that was
[1:03:59] being presented to them the truth of the
[1:04:01] hour the word of the hour was standing
[1:04:03] in front of them in the person of Jesus
[1:04:05] Christ and they could not receive them
[1:04:07] so they had to be under bondage their
[1:04:10] religious pride and their lack of the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost and all this caused them to
[1:04:15] be in a bondage and how do we know
[1:04:17] because they couldn't freely receive
[1:04:19] Jesus said there's something wrong
[1:04:21] because you can't freely receive re the
[1:04:24] word of the
[1:04:25] hour so if you can't freely receive it
[1:04:28] something's wrong and he's pointing that
[1:04:31] out they didn't want to hear it but he's
[1:04:32] pointing out so under the light of the
[1:04:34] son of man we see it exposed invisible
[1:04:38] bondage it exposes all kinds of bondage
[1:04:41] why does it do that why does God does
[1:04:43] God does God like to embarrass us does
[1:04:46] Jesus like to expose things no he
[1:04:48] doesn't do it just to embarrass us he
[1:04:50] doesn't do it for that reason at all he
[1:04:52] does it because he's out to set the
[1:04:55] human being completely free right right
[1:04:59] there's no limits to this
[1:05:01] Freedom you put limitations on it amen
[1:05:05] Satan puts limitations on it and I asked
[1:05:07] my church I said how free could you
[1:05:10] be how free can a human being be yes yes
[1:05:14] yes well the way I read it there's no
[1:05:17] limitations to it I know we have
[1:05:20] boundaries and we have things in the
[1:05:21] scripture to keep us protected from the
[1:05:23] things of the world all that I believe
[1:05:25] in boundaries but the human being
[1:05:27] through the grace of Christ is meant to
[1:05:30] be completely free free from the past
[1:05:34] free from the fear of the future free
[1:05:36] from other men's
[1:05:38] opinions free from losing sleep over
[1:05:40] what your daddy said about you at five 5
[1:05:42] years old right free from the bondage of
[1:05:44] bitterness free from the all bondage in
[1:05:49] the atonement he's meant to set us free
[1:05:51] how free can a human being be
[1:05:55] how confident can a human being walk
[1:05:57] amen with this Freedom amen my to me
[1:06:00] there's no limitations to it that makes
[1:06:02] it a little hard to preach on this
[1:06:04] morning because listen I'm only I'm only
[1:06:06] so capable of bringing it but I can
[1:06:08] safely say that he has he has given man
[1:06:12] uh the greatest thing in the world and
[1:06:14] that is complete Freedom the human being
[1:06:17] can be completely set free of any
[1:06:20] bondage in their spirit in their minds
[1:06:23] right amen I went into an area a couple
[1:06:26] Wednesday nights ago that was a strange
[1:06:27] area I'm just going to mention it now
[1:06:30] that we wouldn't think that Paul could
[1:06:31] be free from this because you know Paul
[1:06:33] sought the Lord three times for a thorn
[1:06:36] in the flesh exactly right exactly right
[1:06:38] so I was asking my church says and now
[1:06:39] wait a minut this doesn't seem to work
[1:06:41] right in our eyes because we asked the
[1:06:43] Lord for something he's supposed to you
[1:06:44] know he's supposed to do it he's he said
[1:06:46] he would do it yeah right but here's
[1:06:48] something he said so that you won't look
[1:06:50] at me in too much pride and I wouldn't
[1:06:52] get too much pride I sought the Lord and
[1:06:55] the only answer I got from the Lord is
[1:06:57] your grace is
[1:07:00] sufficient so there are some things that
[1:07:02] he doesn't take away wow but my question
[1:07:05] my church is that could Paul still be
[1:07:07] free and still have that Thorn In the
[1:07:09] Flesh and the answer has to be yes as
[1:07:13] long as he was living in the sufficient
[1:07:15] grace of God every day he could still be
[1:07:21] free see how that freedom is even in the
[1:07:24] things that would irritate us now I know
[1:07:27] nothing irritates you people here you
[1:07:28] don't have anything in your life that
[1:07:29] irritates you I've got about a hundred
[1:07:31] things but I I know you don't have me
[1:07:33] here in Florida you got the sunshine and
[1:07:35] all that there ain't nothing that
[1:07:36] irritate you but I got a few things that
[1:07:38] irritate me but I can still live free in
[1:07:42] my
[1:07:45] spirit amen Paul said he was talking
[1:07:48] about doing this and Grace and law and
[1:07:50] he says there's certain freedoms people
[1:07:52] have don't use your freedom freedom to
[1:07:54] offend somebody else there's certain
[1:07:56] things that's not expressly black and
[1:07:57] white sometimes in the scripture so you
[1:07:59] live there say I'm going to pray about
[1:08:01] it whatsoever is not a faith is sin so
[1:08:03] you do something you don't have faith to
[1:08:04] do it you shouldn't do that but he goes
[1:08:06] on he's talking about he says I will not
[1:08:08] be brought under the power of any he
[1:08:11] said all things are lawful for me but
[1:08:14] not all things are
[1:08:17] expedient but here's the key I will not
[1:08:19] be brought under the power of any of
[1:08:22] those things amen amen amen that means
[1:08:24] he's free right right Hallelujah Glory
[1:08:29] so just getting past the Jews he's
[1:08:31] speaking about here because there's many
[1:08:32] things we could say uh about them but
[1:08:34] this being under the bondage of
[1:08:36] denomination of their conception of God
[1:08:39] these Pharisees the conception of God
[1:08:41] was wrong that's what brought them under
[1:08:42] bondage they're Bound by denominational
[1:08:44] ideas and it taught them to to believe
[1:08:47] against God to disbelieve God that it
[1:08:49] veiled Jesus to them it it it it
[1:08:51] couldn't be God there in Jesus they
[1:08:53] could couldn't see him so their bondage
[1:08:55] was no freedom to just embrace the
[1:08:58] anointed word for the day that was in
[1:08:59] front of them they said we're not bound
[1:09:01] we're in the lineage of Abraham today
[1:09:04] they would say we're Christians we're
[1:09:05] not bound we're Christians we have this
[1:09:07] and I'm a Christian today but if you're
[1:09:09] bound and being a
[1:09:12] Christian it's not meant to
[1:09:14] be whether it's denominational ideas
[1:09:18] whether it's habits of sin right whether
[1:09:21] it's something from your past you can
[1:09:23] claim to be a Christian but Christian
[1:09:25] means freedom in your soul and spirit
[1:09:28] amen amen hallelujah amen amen so let
[1:09:33] but just let me say something this
[1:09:35] morning about the freedom in Christ the
[1:09:37] depth of Freedom talk a little bit more
[1:09:39] in a minute about the different forms of
[1:09:41] bondage the depth of Freedom a human
[1:09:44] being can experience in Christ I would
[1:09:46] say that we can put no limitations on
[1:09:51] that uh Satan would like to put
[1:09:54] limitations on it Satan would like I we
[1:09:56] put limitations on but Satan will
[1:09:58] probably works overtime to keep uh many
[1:10:02] from the depths of Freedom that they
[1:10:05] could
[1:10:06] experience Satan Works overtime to do
[1:10:08] that in your life but I I'm thinking
[1:10:11] that we're called to being more free
[1:10:13] than what any of us realize uh I'm
[1:10:16] talking about unlimited freedom in your
[1:10:18] soul and in your spirit and in your
[1:10:21] mind uh how how unlimit is it I I think
[1:10:24] it's to infinity and beh
[1:10:27] Beyond I think our freedom in the Lord
[1:10:30] and I'm just trying to do this to to
[1:10:32] expand our our Revelation glory of the
[1:10:35] freedom of Christ right so that we don't
[1:10:38] limit it just by our minds of I I'm only
[1:10:41] going so far here and I'll never reach
[1:10:42] Beyond this and we shouldn't ever put
[1:10:44] those limitations on God we should as
[1:10:47] you pastor's instructing to write it
[1:10:50] down and no no vision is too big serve a
[1:10:54] god of the impossibilities can you say
[1:10:56] Amen we're the ones in our minds that
[1:10:59] put limitations on
[1:11:01] things but the worst thing is when we
[1:11:03] put limitations on our personal our
[1:11:06] personal freedom in
[1:11:08] Christ and we can do that by our own
[1:11:11] thinking and and we put limitations the
[1:11:13] devil puts limitations on it and uh when
[1:11:16] God sets us free it's beyond just from
[1:11:19] smoking and drinking yes yes by the way
[1:11:23] drinking is a bondage that's right maybe
[1:11:25] I need to go back and remind you of that
[1:11:28] social drinking whatever it is B it's
[1:11:31] it's a bondage so you have to be set
[1:11:33] free of that glory to God and when he
[1:11:36] who the sun sets free is free indeed
[1:11:39] he's going to do it smoking drinking
[1:11:40] habits but we often think but he he
[1:11:42] wants us to set us free to be who we are
[1:11:46] in Christ
[1:11:47] completely free from man's opinion this
[1:11:50] is a freedom you can never find outside
[1:11:53] of the Lord Jesus that's right it's only
[1:11:55] in his word only in the person of the
[1:11:57] word but see the Lord has taught the
[1:12:00] Lord has taught us his way but you see
[1:12:03] then the world has taught us many
[1:12:05] different ways and misconceptions of
[1:12:08] what freedom is do you think women are
[1:12:11] that are caught up in the Fashions and
[1:12:13] styles of this world and the makeup and
[1:12:16] the phony looking like a mannequin
[1:12:18] instead of looking like a real
[1:12:20] woman the world has taught that woman
[1:12:22] she's free when she does that the Bible
[1:12:24] says she's not free right brother she's
[1:12:27] under bondage that's right she's caught
[1:12:29] into some web of something right you see
[1:12:32] and and and so this is I'm giving
[1:12:34] examples now this is the way the world
[1:12:36] teaches us uh uh that that sometimes you
[1:12:39] can have something that's presented to
[1:12:42] you young people listen to me you it's
[1:12:44] presented to the world this is freedom
[1:12:45] this is when you're going to really be
[1:12:47] free but there's a deception in
[1:12:49] that the the women's Liberation movement
[1:12:53] had the message that would set women
[1:12:55] free all right all right but it was
[1:12:58] flawed it wasn't the true Freedom that
[1:13:01] Christ and the word offers for a woman
[1:13:04] in Christ only he has true freedom for a
[1:13:06] woman that's right but they they sold it
[1:13:09] as the woman's going to be Li liberated
[1:13:11] she going to be free from men and free
[1:13:13] from things and free to do what she
[1:13:15] wants and wear what she wants and a lot
[1:13:17] of those Founders and leaders I
[1:13:19] shouldn't say a lot but a few of them
[1:13:20] came out of that movement and they're
[1:13:22] the ones who said when I was in that it
[1:13:25] actually binds women up it doesn't set
[1:13:27] them free they set it themselves you can
[1:13:30] look it up and read it they come out of
[1:13:32] that woman's and that this is messed up
[1:13:33] women it's taken them out of their
[1:13:35] god-given place they say it by their own
[1:13:38] testimony it's because every time you
[1:13:40] get away from the image of God you sell
[1:13:43] yourself into bondage every time the
[1:13:46] world sells you something it's always
[1:13:48] bondage yes
[1:13:50] brother then we think of the word coming
[1:13:52] back through the message message of the
[1:13:53] hour and even the devil's tried to
[1:13:56] attach bondage and tell women that the
[1:13:58] message has come to bind women up what a
[1:14:01] lie of the enemy what a lie of the enemy
[1:14:04] yes this message is the greatest
[1:14:07] revealing of Christ that's ever hit
[1:14:08] planet Earth ever before and in that
[1:14:11] revealing he gave women their respected
[1:14:15] dignity back again as a daughter of
[1:14:18] God you say what about the dress what
[1:14:20] about all that you're getting into the
[1:14:22] details but all that is a part of the
[1:14:23] mind of God to give women back their
[1:14:26] dignity as a daughter of God
[1:14:28] again wonderful and I say God bless you
[1:14:31] sisters young sisters whoever you are
[1:14:33] that are holding up the standard of this
[1:14:35] message what you wear what your your
[1:14:37] character Whatever It Is God bless you
[1:14:39] you don't get praised you won't get
[1:14:41] praised in this world you'll get put
[1:14:43] down out in the grocery stores you'll
[1:14:45] get looked at funny at your schools but
[1:14:47] I can tell you I want to praise you this
[1:14:49] morning because you're following the
[1:14:51] image of God and the image of God sets
[1:14:53] you
[1:14:55] free it always sets you free it's the
[1:14:58] devil that tells you this puts you under
[1:15:01] bondage oh my hair and my clothes he's
[1:15:04] the message what a lie my God what a lie
[1:15:09] so you see the world presenting those
[1:15:12] things I guess the one who made this
[1:15:14] beautiful creature of
[1:15:16] women is the one only qualified to give
[1:15:20] her true
[1:15:21] Freedom amen Hallelujah the path that
[1:15:26] God chooses to bring more freedom to you
[1:15:29] is
[1:15:31] truth you shall know the
[1:15:34] truth and the truth will set you
[1:15:37] completely free so the path is through
[1:15:40] truth you're going to live on lies you
[1:15:42] won't find this
[1:15:43] freedom but if you Embrace truth that's
[1:15:46] why he said continue in my word because
[1:15:48] the next step he's going to bring you be
[1:15:49] bringing you to more and more truth a
[1:15:51] lot of you are here this morning because
[1:15:53] you need to hear more
[1:15:55] truth and as you hear more truth and
[1:15:57] embrace it and take it in it sets you
[1:16:00] more free more truth sets you more
[1:16:04] free more lies put you into
[1:16:07] bondage so you must make sure that
[1:16:10] you're hearing the truth in this hour
[1:16:12] and speak it and talk about it and write
[1:16:14] it down as the pastor says we must speak
[1:16:16] the truth and things that are true in
[1:16:18] the scripture and to realize that that
[1:16:21] God is meant to set us free now let me
[1:16:22] get back to a couple other things that's
[1:16:23] bondage because I don't want to leave
[1:16:25] this without saying some more of them so
[1:16:27] we know and expose the enemy what else
[1:16:29] can be bondage in your Bible is a whole
[1:16:32] book dedicated to a group of Believers
[1:16:35] the Galatians who had come to the Lord
[1:16:38] been filled with the Holy Ghost and a
[1:16:40] little time went by and Paul was away I
[1:16:43] believe he he had brought them to the
[1:16:44] Lord and here they are as a little
[1:16:46] message church and some brothers
[1:16:48] brothers from Jerusalem came and visited
[1:16:50] them and told them you need to do this
[1:16:53] you need to do that praise the Lord you
[1:16:54] new Believers you need to be circumcised
[1:16:57] you need to do this and so now the the
[1:16:59] the freedom they had in Christ brothers
[1:17:02] from Jerusalem come on brother come back
[1:17:05] into that church and influence them back
[1:17:08] into
[1:17:09] legalism that's exactly right can I stop
[1:17:12] for a minute and say how much this has
[1:17:14] went on yes for many years in our own
[1:17:18] ranks it's the truth brother it's
[1:17:22] happened way too too
[1:17:23] much where there's influences to take
[1:17:26] the message itself with quotes and
[1:17:29] somehow turn it into a legalism to put
[1:17:33] people under
[1:17:35] bondage well it's right in our Bible
[1:17:37] Paul went to the Galatians he said he
[1:17:39] said he used the word again why will you
[1:17:41] be entangled
[1:17:43] again Stand Fast in the Liberty where
[1:17:46] Christ has set you free he uses the word
[1:17:49] again because they were free but now
[1:17:51] they were put into bondage again
[1:17:54] and so Believers can do the same thing
[1:17:56] where they found a freedom in Christ
[1:17:58] they're moving along growing but some
[1:18:00] influence brings them under bondage some
[1:18:03] sometimes a message influence can bring
[1:18:05] in things and bring the people under
[1:18:07] bondage even under this
[1:18:09] message this is just us here this
[1:18:11] morning
[1:18:12] right turn those cameras
[1:18:16] off I can be open with my second church
[1:18:18] here I'm just being open we have had way
[1:18:22] too much taking this message and making
[1:18:24] it something God never intended it's
[1:18:27] only intended to bring us freedom in
[1:18:29] Jesus Christ not
[1:18:32] legalism but it was Brothers well-
[1:18:35] intending brothers from Jerusalem that
[1:18:38] visited the church and Paul comes in
[1:18:41] Paul comes later and he's visiting a
[1:18:42] service and he he realized something
[1:18:44] wrong now I don't he didn't say what was
[1:18:45] wrong but he detected the people were
[1:18:47] not as free as they were before wow they
[1:18:50] couldn't worship as freely they maybe
[1:18:52] maybe they had a little look on their
[1:18:54] face and I'm a pastor I look at faces
[1:18:56] all the time you can tell when
[1:18:58] something's not quite right you can tell
[1:19:00] when they're feeding or they're not
[1:19:02] feeding sometimes it shows up in the
[1:19:04] face sometimes it don't but but wonder
[1:19:06] what Paul seen that day when he come to
[1:19:08] service and he realized something's
[1:19:09] wrong something's not right wow
[1:19:12] something has B bound this thing up
[1:19:15] where before the people were free and
[1:19:17] going along in the word as the word
[1:19:19] would open to them then they would
[1:19:22] Embrace things
[1:19:24] then they would take a hold of it and
[1:19:26] then now these brothers coming and
[1:19:27] mixing their old uh their old uh laws
[1:19:31] with the message right right maybe
[1:19:34] finding quotes to do it yeah yeah
[1:19:37] teaching these I know what Paul preaches
[1:19:40] here but you guys are really to be a
[1:19:42] real believer you're going to have to
[1:19:44] line and do these things and do do and
[1:19:46] and I know what Paul's seeing but he
[1:19:47] says he said you're entangled again wow
[1:19:50] you're under the who hath here's the
[1:19:53] gation who hath Bewitched
[1:19:58] you somebody has cast a spell on you and
[1:20:01] it wasn't smoking or drinking it was
[1:20:07] legalism from another message Church wow
[1:20:11] brother wow it can be another message
[1:20:14] church or could be a preacher that does
[1:20:15] it and it cast a spell on the people and
[1:20:17] they come under they were bound they
[1:20:20] weren't what they were befor amen I tell
[1:20:22] you friends if you've lost your freedom
[1:20:24] in Jesus Christ you need to take a good
[1:20:26] look at it today cuz he doesn't inue to
[1:20:28] be under some spell of some preacher or
[1:20:31] some other some other message influence
[1:20:34] sometimes the internet is not a good
[1:20:35] thing sometimes it's a good thing
[1:20:37] sometimes it's a bad thing cuz people
[1:20:39] sit on there and hear all kinds of ideas
[1:20:42] and let me say this since I'm feeling
[1:20:43] right at home it undermines the local
[1:20:46] Ministry and the local Pastor so many
[1:20:48] times in the early church God worked
[1:20:51] with the local Bishop and the local
[1:20:53] pastor Pastor to that
[1:20:55] church and when we have Bishops that are
[1:20:58] answering the questions for the whole
[1:21:00] message on the
[1:21:02] internet that's not the book of Acts
[1:21:05] way
[1:21:08] Hallelujah I I like the internet I I I
[1:21:11] we we're on there some and it's been a
[1:21:13] blessing to some people but there's a
[1:21:14] downside to
[1:21:16] it and I can go on and on about that I
[1:21:18] don't want to be get uh negative or
[1:21:19] critical I'm just saying it's real it's
[1:21:21] real that happens and people all of a
[1:21:23] sudden comparing what their Pastor
[1:21:25] saying to what the The Bishop's saying
[1:21:28] and all of a sudden the bishop becomes
[1:21:29] you see all those churches in the early
[1:21:31] church the Ephesians the Galatians the
[1:21:33] Corinthians were all little message
[1:21:36] churches that rose up as a result of the
[1:21:38] ministry of the son of
[1:21:40] man they were little message
[1:21:42] churches and you had the Corinthians the
[1:21:45] book of Correction they always you
[1:21:47] emphasizing majoring on a minor majoring
[1:21:50] on the gifts all the time and Paul had
[1:21:52] to correct them you had the Ephesians
[1:21:53] moving in their inheritance a little bit
[1:21:55] more and you had then you have the
[1:21:57] Galatians and so the whole book is about
[1:21:59] no no wait a minute stop here somebody's
[1:22:02] taking your freedom away Lord Merc and
[1:22:05] it was an influence from other
[1:22:08] brothers well- intending sincere
[1:22:11] Brothers No Doubt but I can tell you
[1:22:12] I'll just I could go on and on but I
[1:22:14] want to say this we must be ever so
[1:22:16] prayerful and be respectful of what God
[1:22:19] wants to do through the local church
[1:22:21] because in the book of Acts
[1:22:23] he started and did his work through the
[1:22:24] local church and then he would send some
[1:22:27] people out to start other churches from
[1:22:29] there but it's the Catholic church that
[1:22:32] ta changed the term of Bishop as being
[1:22:34] the local overseer to the congregation
[1:22:36] they changed it to being over so many
[1:22:39] churches now we don't technically have
[1:22:41] Bishops in this message but we have the
[1:22:44] Antichrist spirit that tries to do
[1:22:48] it yeah it's underhandedly and all of it
[1:22:52] all of it is to bring the people under a
[1:22:55] bondage and bringing them under
[1:22:57] something other than God's intended way
[1:23:00] the book of Acts church so there there's
[1:23:02] a the Galatians under condemnation under
[1:23:05] guilt they didn't have their Joy anymore
[1:23:07] there was it's kind of awkward when Paul
[1:23:08] got to the service something was wrong
[1:23:10] why are you withdrawn in your spirit
[1:23:12] when there's no need to be withdrawn in
[1:23:14] your spirit What's Happening Here Paul
[1:23:16] picked up on it something was wrong they
[1:23:18] had brought in an influence that wasn't
[1:23:19] right people say they have freedom from
[1:23:21] something while they're in bondage to
[1:23:23] something else I'm free you ever heard a
[1:23:25] young person say I'm free to do whatever
[1:23:27] I want wow that's a lie wow I'm free to
[1:23:32] do whatever I want that's not true
[1:23:33] Freedom all it may be bondage as well
[1:23:37] the world's freedom is highly sellable
[1:23:39] and and it Woos us to a so-called Freer
[1:23:42] one writer said it this way one
[1:23:43] Christian writer said when we use our
[1:23:45] Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh
[1:23:49] we stick our head through the Yoke of
[1:23:51] bondage all over again wow that's deep
[1:23:56] when we use our let me say it again when
[1:23:58] we use our Liberty as an opportunity for
[1:24:00] our flesh we stick our head through the
[1:24:03] Yoke of bondage all over again amen one
[1:24:07] uh one uh writer talked about
[1:24:09] intellectual bondage intellectual mental
[1:24:11] bondage results from ignorance of
[1:24:13] spiritual things people choose to be
[1:24:14] ignorant so they're blocked in there I
[1:24:16] call it stinking
[1:24:19] thinking it's just stinking thinking
[1:24:21] amen and they're locked in a certain
[1:24:23] mindset about something and they're not
[1:24:25] going to grow beyond that they're not
[1:24:26] going to be corrected they're not going
[1:24:27] to change that's a bondage it's called
[1:24:30] intellectual
[1:24:31] bondage it's called stinking thinking
[1:24:34] there's another thing called Financial
[1:24:35] bondage you probably know more about
[1:24:37] that one you can debt brings you under
[1:24:39] as a slave debt brings you under bondage
[1:24:42] God never intended for you to be living
[1:24:44] there praise the Lord there's such a
[1:24:46] thing as emotional bondage that means
[1:24:48] you're all locked up with something like
[1:24:50] bitterness or fear from the past or fear
[1:24:52] for the future some past physical or
[1:24:55] mental abuse past legalistic teaching or
[1:24:58] atmospheres that you grew up in and so
[1:25:00] you're under emotional bondage I have
[1:25:02] some people like that in my church and I
[1:25:04] just keep praying I keep preaching to
[1:25:06] them because they don't realize they
[1:25:07] come to church they lift their hands but
[1:25:08] they're emotionally locked upow I said
[1:25:11] they're emotionally locked up in their
[1:25:13] Spirit they can't give their full uh
[1:25:15] their full uhh uh life and their full
[1:25:18] heart to the body of Christ they stay
[1:25:21] alone they don't trust anybody they
[1:25:23] don't trust preachers so they're all
[1:25:25] locked up in their Spirit somebody say
[1:25:28] Amen this morning you know I'm telling
[1:25:29] the truth God didn't intend for you to
[1:25:32] come and lift your hands and worship and
[1:25:33] still be locked up on the inside we're
[1:25:36] not supposed to be locked up from
[1:25:38] anything from the past from any mental
[1:25:40] abuse from any sexual
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] abuse young girl you're not supposed to
[1:25:47] say your whole life locked up by that
[1:25:49] and a lack of trust you can trust Jesus
[1:25:51] Christ you you can trust his word and
[1:25:53] there's people in the body of Christ he
[1:25:55] provides that you can
[1:25:59] trust you see you can be free this
[1:26:02] morning you can you say Lord I don't
[1:26:04] want to go another day all locked up in
[1:26:06] my
[1:26:09] spirit glory to
[1:26:11] God they say addictions of course is
[1:26:13] another bondage rise rafy says there's
[1:26:16] much that promises Freedom that is
[1:26:19] actually brings bondage it merely
[1:26:20] transfers it into a different form
[1:26:22] rather than conquers the dependency at
[1:26:24] its core this is addictions while they
[1:26:26] promise them Liberty they themselves are
[1:26:28] slaves of corruption second Peter 2:19
[1:26:30] when a behavior or use of a substance
[1:26:33] becomes compulsive despite harm harmful
[1:26:36] consequences it is an addiction in all
[1:26:39] of its forms addiction is ultimately
[1:26:41] bondage to
[1:26:42] yourself okay now if you have things and
[1:26:45] medicines that help I Don't Preach
[1:26:46] against that that's why as long as you
[1:26:48] don't buy into the idea that this is the
[1:26:51] all answer to to
[1:26:54] it unow you don't become addicted to
[1:26:57] it because that's bondage and Christ
[1:27:00] didn't intend for you to be addicted to
[1:27:01] something so he says now in all of its
[1:27:04] forms addiction is ultimately bondage to
[1:27:07] yourself your flesh your Cravings
[1:27:09] addiction is a form of slavery in which
[1:27:11] millions are bound today amen even in
[1:27:15] the church sometimes here's another form
[1:27:17] of bondage
[1:27:19] rejection oh you're bound by by a lack
[1:27:22] of faith in yourself and in your
[1:27:25] position in
[1:27:26] Christ you have rejection issues in
[1:27:29] other words the first person your dad
[1:27:30] rejected your mom rejected you started
[1:27:32] back to somebody reject you so you
[1:27:34] rejected so anytime give somebody gives
[1:27:36] a little hint of rejection then you you
[1:27:39] you lock up because you're bound by
[1:27:41] rejection you're bound by a lack of
[1:27:43] faith and
[1:27:44] confidence in who God has made you
[1:27:50] now some people are bound by the the
[1:27:52] bondage of complexes they never accepted
[1:27:55] never were accepted in the
[1:27:57] crowd all of us have some complexes but
[1:28:00] some people it's extreme so they're they
[1:28:01] stay Bound by the com worried about what
[1:28:03] other people are thinking about them
[1:28:06] estimating some measuring themselves by
[1:28:08] what other people are measuring
[1:28:09] themselves by they live in bondage
[1:28:12] coming to church wondering what
[1:28:13] everybody's thinking about them I was so
[1:28:15] bad when I was a kid when they got in a
[1:28:17] huddle at the football game I thought
[1:28:18] they were talking about
[1:28:21] me
[1:28:23] just
[1:28:24] kidding that's how bad it can be though
[1:28:27] they're over there in the corner and I
[1:28:29] know I know they're probably talking
[1:28:31] about me and they're probably
[1:28:34] not it's just your complex is reading
[1:28:37] into it CU you're not confident in
[1:28:39] yourself they can talk about me all they
[1:28:41] want to I'm free in Jesus Christ I know
[1:28:44] who I am I don't care if they're talking
[1:28:46] about
[1:28:47] me
[1:28:49] Hallelujah there was a saying that says
[1:28:51] I spent the the first 20 years of my
[1:28:53] life uh no first 30 years of my life
[1:28:57] worried so much about what people were
[1:28:59] thinking about me and then I spent the
[1:29:01] next 30 years of my life not caring what
[1:29:03] people thought about
[1:29:05] me and then after those years were over
[1:29:08] I realized nobody was really thinking
[1:29:10] about me the whole
[1:29:13] time what a waste of time find out they
[1:29:16] weren't really thinking about me
[1:29:17] anywhere talking about me it's all in
[1:29:19] our mind it's bondage of the Mind it's
[1:29:22] another form of Satan bind you that you
[1:29:24] can't be totally free in Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ
[1:29:30] amen hallelujah wow prise God Amen they
[1:29:34] say you can be bound by unrealistic
[1:29:36] expectations of
[1:29:38] Life brother you just set yourself up
[1:29:40] for disappointment all the
[1:29:42] time expectations of people they were
[1:29:45] supposed to do this and they were
[1:29:46] supposed to come through and my parents
[1:29:48] were supposed to come through and my
[1:29:49] pastor was supposed to unrealistic
[1:29:51] expectations and somebody fails youu and
[1:29:54] you stay Bound by that all the
[1:29:57] time how about I mention the bondage of
[1:29:59] business and being too busy and no time
[1:30:02] for
[1:30:03] god well this is familiar to us in the
[1:30:05] first Exodus Pharaoh begin to put more
[1:30:08] work on the people more shifts Pharaoh's
[1:30:11] probably the first one to come up with
[1:30:12] three and four
[1:30:14] shifts the night shift and the the red
[1:30:17] eye shift
[1:30:18] and and the system is still doing it but
[1:30:22] what did Pharaoh what did what did Satan
[1:30:24] do it for back then brother brand said
[1:30:26] he says to make them the people of God
[1:30:28] become busy that he did it so they
[1:30:30] couldn't produce more children because
[1:30:33] he did two things then he began to kill
[1:30:35] the children so two things in the first
[1:30:36] Exodus and the second is sex Exodus and
[1:30:39] the Third Exodus is that he tried to
[1:30:41] make it real busy so they didn't have
[1:30:43] time with God second of all he's going
[1:30:44] attacking the children every all three
[1:30:47] exoduses he's going for the
[1:30:50] children wow wow
[1:30:52] so the same bondage of a system that's
[1:30:54] set up and guess what we can't get
[1:30:56] around the system but we're not meant to
[1:30:59] be so Bound by it but we that we no
[1:31:01] longer have time alone with
[1:31:04] God that's why brother BR says joked her
[1:31:08] husband amram he went upstairs he come
[1:31:10] in so tired he was so wore out but he
[1:31:13] was he was more tired of another thing
[1:31:15] that God had a promise to deliver his
[1:31:17] people he said he went up those stairs
[1:31:19] he said no I am not going to eat he was
[1:31:21] out for working all three shifts he
[1:31:23] comes upstairs to his prayer closet God
[1:31:26] God are you going to answer are you
[1:31:27] going to deliver where's your deliverer
[1:31:29] going to be he was tired but he wouldn't
[1:31:31] let the
[1:31:33] system bring him under bondage to not
[1:31:37] talk to his
[1:31:38] god
[1:31:40] wow yeah it's to make our lives
[1:31:43] busy and some of this business is just
[1:31:46] not needed as much as we think it
[1:31:50] Isen glory to God it's bondage to
[1:31:54] us you know I I remember way back I
[1:31:57] don't know this what 20 years ago in my
[1:31:59] Christian walk I remember the devil and
[1:32:01] he's he's he always whispered and I was
[1:32:03] going to go do this I was going to call
[1:32:04] this brother going to call do this he
[1:32:06] said a little voice you're too busy to
[1:32:08] do that look at all this stuff you got
[1:32:10] some bills to pay you got you're too
[1:32:12] busy to do that and after about a week I
[1:32:14] just caught it and I said isn't it
[1:32:15] amazing that little little voice who I
[1:32:17] recognize is the devil now saying that
[1:32:19] I'm too busy to do these things
[1:32:22] it's all things that had Eternal Merit
[1:32:24] to it wow it's all things that were more
[1:32:28] important than the things of Life are
[1:32:30] you listening to me this morning you got
[1:32:32] to be careful of that little voice that
[1:32:34] say you're too busy to do that you're
[1:32:37] too busy to spend time with your
[1:32:38] children fathers Amen brother you're too
[1:32:41] busy to teach them the word of God
[1:32:44] you're too busy to sit down and read
[1:32:45] them the Bible too busy to bring them to
[1:32:47] Sunday school amen I got to shift work I
[1:32:49] got to do I got a business I never
[1:32:51] understand Brothers in business who work
[1:32:52] on Sundays because they have a choice
[1:32:55] they call the
[1:33:00] shots see there are some things I can't
[1:33:03] say in my own church that I can say
[1:33:06] another I never understood somebody who
[1:33:09] has control of their own schedule and
[1:33:12] somehow they schedule all these
[1:33:13] customers on
[1:33:14] Sunday you're buying into the system of
[1:33:17] bondage you got a choice man I'll make
[1:33:20] that choice towards God every time then
[1:33:22] he'll bless your
[1:33:25] business praise the
[1:33:28] lord it's the sunshine that's affected
[1:33:30] me down here it's the sunshine praise be
[1:33:33] to
[1:33:33] God busy too busy too much to the system
[1:33:37] and so now so now we just want to move
[1:33:39] on here to something that's real
[1:33:40] important to wrap this up there this
[1:33:42] morning because there's a lot here as
[1:33:44] you can see I hope you see there's a lot
[1:33:46] of forms of Satan's
[1:33:48] bondage and you might have become a
[1:33:50] little uncomfortable with some of them
[1:33:51] this morning that's all right I still
[1:33:53] love you I I still love I just wanted to
[1:33:56] tell you about them you take it home you
[1:33:58] chew on it but I'm here as a gospel
[1:34:00] minister to say to you you are meant to
[1:34:03] be totally free from every bondage of
[1:34:05] Satan totally free free from the
[1:34:09] Fashions of the World free from what the
[1:34:11] world says you free to be your own
[1:34:13] identity in Christ instead of what they
[1:34:14] say about
[1:34:16] you how free can you be how free can you
[1:34:20] be there's a quote that I read years ago
[1:34:23] and it came up in this series again I
[1:34:26] just I've always it taught me so much
[1:34:28] about this scripture ye shall know the
[1:34:31] truth and the truth will set you free in
[1:34:34] in Christ's unlimited Freedom there are
[1:34:37] no restrictions so we got to find that
[1:34:40] before we can be truly free you got to
[1:34:42] pray and but sometimes you can pray hard
[1:34:45] for someone and we learn this through
[1:34:46] many quotes with this one especially we
[1:34:49] can pray hard but there's something else
[1:34:51] there's another another form of bondage
[1:34:53] that's keeping them brother Brandon
[1:34:54] prayed for many people and they didn't
[1:34:56] get
[1:34:57] healed because he said there was another
[1:35:00] issue another problem that was laying
[1:35:02] there that they weren't dealing
[1:35:05] with so now you can't just go on with it
[1:35:08] and say okay well because you might get
[1:35:09] to this point why didn't God heal them
[1:35:11] sometimes it's because there's another
[1:35:13] form of bondage that they need to be
[1:35:15] delivered from before they receive this
[1:35:17] freedom of their physical
[1:35:19] health and if that person's trying to
[1:35:21] hide that like if it's sin they're
[1:35:23] hiding it that's a
[1:35:25] problem because they're holding on to a
[1:35:28] bondage they don't really want to they
[1:35:30] just want a quick
[1:35:31] healing they just want to the pastor to
[1:35:34] pray for them they just want lay hands
[1:35:36] and they shall recovers and I believe in
[1:35:38] all that but they don't want to be
[1:35:40] delivered from other bondages in their
[1:35:41] life is this
[1:35:44] okay so it goes into something here in
[1:35:47] uh uh in uh let me just look when it's
[1:35:50] at I think it's way down here water
[1:35:51] water from The Rock in 1955 if you don't
[1:35:54] mind it's a little bit of lengthy
[1:35:55] reading but there's so many good things
[1:35:57] many times people comes to the house to
[1:35:59] my house that's been in meetings and so
[1:36:01] forth and that failed to get healed they
[1:36:03] wonder why then when they come in maybe
[1:36:06] there's some hidden something back in
[1:36:07] their life that they haven't done or
[1:36:10] should have done and maybe they'd
[1:36:12] forgotten about it maybe that's the very
[1:36:13] cause that the brother laying his hands
[1:36:15] on them or anointing with oil their
[1:36:16] Church whatever it was they didn't get
[1:36:18] healed listen friends you've got to find
[1:36:20] the cause before you find the Cure
[1:36:23] absolutely if you went to the oh this is
[1:36:26] great this all high tech here they're
[1:36:29] they all over
[1:36:31] this praise the
[1:36:33] Lord I I'm I'm not Tech savy I need help
[1:36:37] so this is great so you see here he said
[1:36:41] uh listen friends you've got to find the
[1:36:43] the cause before you find the C
[1:36:45] absolutely if you went to a doctor
[1:36:47] doctor I'm having a headache just a
[1:36:48] persistent headache he says well take
[1:36:50] this and gives you a few aspirin he's
[1:36:52] not a doctor he's trying to get rid of
[1:36:54] you the only thing is that doctor if
[1:36:56] he's a real doctor he would diagnose
[1:36:58] that case till he finds the cause of
[1:37:00] that headache then work from there now
[1:37:02] if you pray for a person that doesn't
[1:37:04] get well then there's something
[1:37:06] somewhere causing him because God's
[1:37:07] Sovereign to his word he's got to stay
[1:37:09] with his word Peter said on the day of
[1:37:11] Pentecost repent every one of you be
[1:37:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:37:15] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:37:17] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if a
[1:37:19] man repents and is baptized he is
[1:37:21] absolutely God is Duty bound to give him
[1:37:24] the Holy Ghost if he's repented from his
[1:37:26] heart why why Terry why wait a long time
[1:37:29] is because there's something here that
[1:37:30] isn't right correctly God's got you say
[1:37:33] well maybe God just don't want to give
[1:37:35] it to me oh yes he does you take every
[1:37:38] bit of well you say maybe the Holy Ghost
[1:37:40] has been just so many God has got plenty
[1:37:43] of it for you don't worry could you
[1:37:45] imagine a little fish about that long
[1:37:47] standing in the middle of the ocean
[1:37:49] swimming around saying I better get a
[1:37:50] drink of this water kind of sparingly
[1:37:52] cuz I might run out someday well that's
[1:37:55] just about like thinking God hasn't got
[1:37:57] enough Holy Spirit for you that's right
[1:37:59] let me say it this morning just thinking
[1:38:01] that God doesn't have enough freedom for
[1:38:02] you this morning he's got this is an
[1:38:04] inexhaustible Fountain of Life there's
[1:38:07] no limitations to it how how free can a
[1:38:11] person really breath well why don't you
[1:38:14] find out because you have the word to do
[1:38:16] it
[1:38:19] un praise the Lord why not find out amen
[1:38:23] hallelujah how free could you be and so
[1:38:27] uh he says here my that's like trying
[1:38:30] okay could you imagine a little mouse
[1:38:31] under the great Garners of Egypt where
[1:38:33] there stacked in a billions of tons and
[1:38:35] little mouse down there saying well i'
[1:38:36] better not eat about one or two grains a
[1:38:38] day because I might run out of this wi
[1:38:40] this winter my that's like trying to
[1:38:42] think that God hasn't got Grace enough
[1:38:43] to save you heal you and he's wanting to
[1:38:46] do it more than you are ready to receive
[1:38:48] that's right sure he wants to do it
[1:38:50] could you imagine all the Waters in the
[1:38:51] world packed into a stand pipe about
[1:38:53] this big round it would go a thousands
[1:38:55] of thousands of miles through the air
[1:38:56] and how the pressure of that water
[1:38:58] coming down pressing down trying to find
[1:39:01] one little cre one little crevice to get
[1:39:03] out of it that's the way the love of God
[1:39:05] and the healing power is trying to pour
[1:39:07] in this meeting tonight trying his best
[1:39:10] everywhere God trying to make his way
[1:39:12] into the heart with all that pressure of
[1:39:14] divine love and everything trying to
[1:39:16] press its way into the people if you
[1:39:18] just show the right approach to it you
[1:39:20] can walk right up and just receive it
[1:39:21] just like that brother Braham snaps his
[1:39:23] fingers that's all because if God
[1:39:25] promised anything and you don't receive
[1:39:27] it there's something wrong people come
[1:39:29] sometimes I haven't I haven't got time
[1:39:31] tonight to go in the detail I will maybe
[1:39:33] next week on the testimony but how the
[1:39:35] people come from everywhere say well I
[1:39:37] failed to get it and a lady come not
[1:39:39] long ago saying that someone told her
[1:39:40] that she had Seven Devils another person
[1:39:43] told her she only had five and she
[1:39:45] wanted to know where the fourth went
[1:39:47] come on brother poor woman Plum gone
[1:39:49] nearly set in the room take taking her
[1:39:51] stockings and pulled her feet up in the
[1:39:53] chair said I haven't eaten for several
[1:39:55] days and I'm not going to eat till I
[1:39:58] find out what become of those Devils
[1:40:01] said where are they and I said well I
[1:40:02] don't know I never know nothing about it
[1:40:04] said well one
[1:40:06] Minister told me that's it I had seven
[1:40:10] devils and the other lady Minister said
[1:40:12] I had only five there's two of them gone
[1:40:14] somewhere now see and come stayed there
[1:40:16] for about two hours in my house stop
[1:40:18] right here I mean this with a great
[1:40:22] disrespect This Woman's bondage she's a
[1:40:24] Christian This Woman's bondage came from
[1:40:28] a minister speaking a wrong thing over
[1:40:30] their
[1:40:34] life oh that don't happen anymore oh yes
[1:40:37] it
[1:40:38] does that a word spoken by a minister
[1:40:41] not
[1:40:42] correct puts that person under
[1:40:45] bondage been a pastor 35 years deal with
[1:40:48] people coming most the people I minister
[1:40:50] to come from hurtful damaging situations
[1:40:53] within our ranks and I don't know why we
[1:40:56] have some new ones com and baptized but
[1:40:58] a lot of them are just wounded saints
[1:41:00] that were just under an abusive
[1:41:03] situation or told the wrong thing
[1:41:05] they're not living in truth they've come
[1:41:08] under the bondage this Minister told me
[1:41:10] something and for years I've been under
[1:41:13] that word because I had respect for
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:16] him it's difficult you think Satan can
[1:41:19] work this subtle can yes he can he'll
[1:41:22] work in any form to bind a person
[1:41:24] up the source of this came from a
[1:41:27] minister told her she had seven one she
[1:41:30] had this and she's she's become a
[1:41:32] nervous woman she's not cleaning her
[1:41:33] house anymore she's not taking care of
[1:41:35] her husband anymore she's got physical
[1:41:38] problems she's all nervous and she's
[1:41:40] pulling her stockings up in the living
[1:41:41] room of brother Brandon he's there and
[1:41:44] she's just she has an eight for days and
[1:41:45] she's just going on and on and it all
[1:41:48] started she's under bondage clearly but
[1:41:50] it all started by something I just want
[1:41:53] to say it respectfully if you're going
[1:41:55] to say thus sayith the Lord on something
[1:41:58] if you're going to give a word of the
[1:41:59] Lord you better be
[1:42:02] sure it's from the Lord or hold your
[1:42:06] peace I hope that's okay to say it
[1:42:08] that's the way we're taught by the
[1:42:10] message of the
[1:42:11] hour and now sometimes we have this just
[1:42:14] general thing going on and you give
[1:42:16] somebody a free pass because they're a
[1:42:17] big minister no no no we don't do that
[1:42:19] all the orders place we're interested in
[1:42:23] God speaking to us truly God the
[1:42:27] truth not not not just a a a vague thing
[1:42:31] if it's going to be vague we'd go down
[1:42:33] the road here and join in with uh Benny
[1:42:36] Henn that's right that's right and the
[1:42:39] message didn't call us back to that it
[1:42:41] called us further on to Sons and
[1:42:43] Daughters of God the brid will have thus
[1:42:46] sayith the Lord she'll keep still that's
[1:42:49] it that's it we got to have the
[1:42:52] truth and we got to preach the truth
[1:42:54] over people's lives or we get in trouble
[1:42:57] is that okay amen Pastor can correct me
[1:43:01] later if I'm wrong or overstepping my
[1:43:02] bounds but this is in my heart listen
[1:43:05] these examples are here but they're
[1:43:06] still happening today we should be
[1:43:08] careful and only speak truth over
[1:43:11] people's life they're too important to
[1:43:12] God these lives are too precious to God
[1:43:15] to be messing
[1:43:19] withow thank amen had two or three
[1:43:22] teenage girls in a in a camp meeting
[1:43:25] Youth Camp in the last couple Summers
[1:43:27] something was said over them what is it
[1:43:30] wasn't the truth wasn't the truth at all
[1:43:32] didn't come to pass wasn't the truth how
[1:43:35] does a young girl deal with that that's
[1:43:37] right she's a respect the minister and
[1:43:40] you know she does and and I thank you
[1:43:41] for respecting him we'll leave it
[1:43:43] between him and God whatever but that's
[1:43:45] not a problem with the girl you don't
[1:43:48] play with these
[1:43:49] gifts am
[1:43:53] am amen so she's all bound and she's
[1:43:56] scared and she's all a mess here you
[1:43:59] know and nobody really knows the truth

[1:44:04] her condition that she's in which we're
[1:44:06] going to find out later as menopause
[1:44:08] that was the truth of it somebody's
[1:44:10] going to take her condition you still

[1:49:04] amen than that kiss him kiss
[1:49:08] him sit down get on his
[1:49:15] lap this is coming from the Prophet this
[1:49:18] is the prophet's advice
[1:49:21] that's what I'm talking
[1:49:24] about I don't need to pray for you you
[1:49:28] need to you need to settle in the peace
[1:49:30] and the settl of Christ and get back to
[1:49:33] your duties in Christ and serve the
[1:49:41] Lord sat on his lap tell him you love
[1:49:43] him and Live Like a Lady ought to that's
[1:49:45] exactly that's all there is but see all
[1:49:47] the pouring out of oil all the Stomping
[1:49:50] kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't
[1:49:53] do a bit of good oh there's not as many
[1:49:56] amens on
[1:49:59] that you can have shouting you can have
[1:50:02] stomping you can have all the big thing
[1:50:04] and people still aren't set free
[1:50:07] right right sometimes they are but
[1:50:10] sometimes they're not so that doesn't
[1:50:13] the we don't judge the presence of God
[1:50:15] in Deliverance by the deciple of
[1:50:18] sound amen there's two quotes one says
[1:50:21] when God's around there's
[1:50:23] noise but then there's the other one
[1:50:24] that says he can do Supernatural things
[1:50:26] and there's no noise at
[1:50:28] all so we want to balance in the word of
[1:50:30] God I'm not preaching against noise this
[1:50:32] morning I'm just saying don't use it as
[1:50:34] a measuring stick that somebody's coming
[1:50:37] to the truth in their life to get
[1:50:39] deliverance from bondage what God is
[1:50:41] interested in in the services is full
[1:50:43] deliverance from bondage for people to
[1:50:46] be truly free
[1:50:48] amen hey amen so now let me finish this
[1:50:52] up because this is the climax here where
[1:50:54] he says all the pouring of all all the
[1:50:56] Stomping loud out wouldn't do it's the
[1:50:59] truth that makes you
[1:51:01] free that's it that's it that's it
[1:51:04] that's it you know I'm doing little
[1:51:05] search as young Minister I'm looking up
[1:51:06] this scripture you shall know the truth
[1:51:08] that's what he says next you shall know
[1:51:10] the truth he's quoting the my text today
[1:51:12] and I did a search and I found this
[1:51:14] scripture which you can't find it but
[1:51:16] two or three places in the scripture
[1:51:18] excuse me in the message and this is
[1:51:20] where that scripture is found you shall
[1:51:23] know the truth and the truth and this is
[1:51:25] the example because see when we think of
[1:51:28] truth it's the serpent seed revealed
[1:51:29] it's the godhead it's doctrines but it's
[1:51:33] all truth will set you free lies will
[1:51:36] bind you the LIE of the Trinity will
[1:51:39] bind
[1:51:40] youen but the lie that you believe that
[1:51:43] your parents told you that's not the
[1:51:44] truth of your identity that's a lie
[1:51:47] too and when you get look into the book
[1:51:49] of of Life the book of redemption which
[1:51:51] the seals have been taken off it's the
[1:51:53] book of our true identity and when you
[1:51:55] look in that book you get your true
[1:51:58] identity this is who I am I'm confident
[1:52:02] in who I am I'm confident the way God
[1:52:04] made me and now I can go on life with a
[1:52:07] skip in my step with joy in my heart I
[1:52:09] don't have to try to be somebody else
[1:52:12] can you say Amen am I'm free to be
[1:52:17] me according to the Book of Life I see
[1:52:20] my name in there I'm free to be
[1:52:23] me you shall know the truth and the
[1:52:26] truth will set you free see that's right
[1:52:28] so many times sure in a group you find a
[1:52:30] lots of people when you bring three or
[1:52:32] 400 people through the line there's many
[1:52:34] clean pure hearts in there that comes
[1:52:35] right through and they gets healed
[1:52:37] that's right but there's some that we
[1:52:38] have to get back and pick up the
[1:52:39] strugglings like that that fails it now
[1:52:42] we can only do it as God says so do God
[1:52:45] says do now if did you know if a man
[1:52:48] that has a given power power of faith
[1:52:50] not power not to himself but faith in
[1:52:52] God to do it to cast out an evil spirit
[1:52:54] and would do it outside of the will of
[1:52:57] the God's will would get himself in
[1:53:01] trouble wow that's some deep
[1:53:05] things but the point is is truth
[1:53:09] sometimes we think is other things but
[1:53:11] it's the truth about yourself it's the
[1:53:14] truth you know sometimes if you're sick
[1:53:17] you're
[1:53:18] sick okay okay you deny the symptoms
[1:53:21] there the lying vanities as was taught
[1:53:24] in Jonah that's the faith stand you take
[1:53:28] but you're not going to be unrealist
[1:53:30] realistic to say I'm not sick you're
[1:53:32] sick that's the truth but the deeper
[1:53:34] truth is I'm Healed by the blood of
[1:53:36] Jesus Christ it's all
[1:53:39] truth and there's a truth that trumps
[1:53:41] all lies can you say Amen oh I love him
[1:53:46] don't you
[1:53:47] amen free from all things I'm closing by
[1:53:51] saying he set us free from all things

[1:56:39] bigger than your
[1:56:41] problems praise God hallelujah
[1:56:46] amen one scripture I'll leave with you
[1:56:48] and I'm closing Romans 8:21 says because
[1:56:52] the creature itself also shall be
[1:56:55] delivered from the bondage of
[1:56:58] corruption into the
[1:57:01] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[1:57:06] just think about that a minute as we
[1:57:07] close just think about this
[1:57:09] scripture the creature itself also shall
[1:57:13] be delivered from the bonders because
[1:57:14] how how many know when Adam fell from
[1:57:16] his freedom Adam fell was all cre fell
[1:57:20] with
[1:57:20] it so when he was leaving living in
[1:57:23] Freedom as a Son of God and in his
[1:57:24] position with the title deed to this
[1:57:26] earth everything else that trickled down
[1:57:29] from it lived in a freedom as well amen
[1:57:33] now he falls Calvary brings us back now
[1:57:37] 2,000 years later after Calvary our our
[1:57:40] kinsman redeemer the lamb steps into
[1:57:42] John's vision and it became the theme of
[1:57:44] the book you you're all so receptive
[1:57:46] today I can't quit
[1:57:48] preaching
[1:57:53] I got to find a place to
[1:57:56] stop our lamb that went to Calvary our
[1:57:59] Kinsman went to Calvary but 2,000 years
[1:58:00] later he steps into John's vision and
[1:58:04] that whole Vision was about the book of
[1:58:05] redemption you know why it's about the
[1:58:07] book now it's about the book of R
[1:58:08] because our names are in that
[1:58:10] book amen and when that lamb our lamb
[1:58:14] stepped into that Vision everything
[1:58:15] begin to Rejoice he took that book he's
[1:58:17] going to take the SE cuz everything's
[1:58:19] about the book now and I'm called The
[1:58:21] Book of identity it's our true identity
[1:58:23] it's who we are in Christ everything
[1:58:26] comes becomes about our identity in
[1:58:28] Jesus
[1:58:29] Christ and because of the Bride finding
[1:58:32] her true identity and feeding on it all
[1:58:35] these years she will come to her
[1:58:37] position of power her her Redemption the
[1:58:39] power Redemption will bring her into
[1:58:41] that place despite herself he's bringing
[1:58:43] Sons and Daughters into that place until
[1:58:46] she comes to this glorious Liberty of
[1:58:48] the children of God and when she comes
[1:58:51] into this glorious I love it glorious
[1:58:55] Liberty this is the Glorious
[1:58:58] Liberty this book of identity this book
[1:59:01] of redemption what's it bringing into
[1:59:02] Liberty amen amen how do you know
[1:59:05] brother Paul it's a book of identity and
[1:59:07] positions and say because when they
[1:59:09] worshiped when he took the book they
[1:59:11] worshiped but then they said thou has
[1:59:13] made us Kings and Priests all right all
[1:59:16] right all right it made them something
[1:59:20] it brought them back to their true
[1:59:22] positions Kings and Priests but the main
[1:59:25] thing is they come into this Glory
[1:59:26] Liberty and this is the part I want to
[1:59:27] get to because the creation itself shall
[1:59:30] be delivered when this bride comes into
[1:59:33] her full Liberty everything else follows
[1:59:37] it the Redemption of this Earth follows
[1:59:40] it how important is it for you to be
[1:59:43] free this
[1:59:44] morning how important is it for you to
[1:59:46] be in this glorious freedom amen amen
[1:59:50] amen everything follows it and that
[1:59:53] makes me wonder when I walk into the
[1:59:55] grocery store I walk into the gas
[1:59:58] station or I walk into
[2:00:01] Starbucks or many times to
[2:00:10] McDonald's I walk with
[2:00:13] confidence I'm
[2:00:16] free sometimes I think they recognize
[2:00:18] that freedom they should they should I'm
[2:00:21] whistling sometimes I'm I'm talking to
[2:00:24] myself sometimes I shouldn't do that my
[2:00:26] wife sometimes they'll catch me in the
[2:00:28] bathroom I'm talking to myself she says
[2:00:30] why do you talk to yourself well I said
[2:00:33] number one there's two reasons I like to
[2:00:34] talk to intelligent
[2:00:42] people number two I like to listen to
[2:00:45] intelligent people
[2:00:46] talk that's what I tell her don't where
[2:00:49] you at anyway that's what I tell
[2:00:54] her but I talk to myself and I'm free in
[2:00:58] my spirit all right brother and
[2:01:00] something coms to try to bind me some
[2:01:02] some problem in the church at home or
[2:01:04] whatever tries to lose sleepover I have
[2:01:06] a place I can take it to the Lord say
[2:01:08] God you're in control you're going to
[2:01:10] take care of this I bear the burden
[2:01:13] there you are sweetie I couldn't find
[2:01:14] you I bear the burden of the flock the
[2:01:16] burden's something different but I won't
[2:01:18] let the devil will bring me under
[2:01:21] bondage because I'm not really the
[2:01:23] leader of the church God
[2:01:28] is let me say this to finish if if this
[2:01:32] has as much glorious freedom in
[2:01:35] it that actually it will affect all of
[2:01:39] cre creatures creation being
[2:01:42] delivered then I think it can affect
[2:01:45] other people that's around you that's
[2:01:48] true amen people don't like it when you
[2:01:50] get really free and you're yourself and
[2:01:51] you're not concerned about criticism you
[2:01:54] don't they try to criticize you and and

[2:09:52] hearts Lord there's something deeper
[2:09:54] there's something greater Lord I'm
[2:09:56] asking for it in my life Lord that you
[2:09:58] bring a little change in my life but God
[2:10:00] I could experience Freedom like I've
[2:10:02] never experienced it before Lord we
[2:10:05] shouldn't put any limitations on it Lord
[2:10:07] to be happy to be free Lord to have a
[2:10:11] something in our countenance Lord that
[2:10:13] others can see that's a person that's
[2:10:15] been completely set free it's more than
[2:10:17] just the bondage to smoking and drinking
[2:10:19] the things of the world but God it's
[2:10:21] something deep within us it's a fountain
[2:10:24] flowing out of us Lord something that
[2:10:26] tells people there's a real person
[2:10:29] that's been set free no bondage anymore
[2:10:32] bless the hearts of the people and we
[2:10:34] thank you Lord for the opportunity to
[2:10:36] speak to them today and give them Lord
[2:10:38] what you've given me I commit it to you
[2:10:41] now in the name of Jesus Christ amen

[2:11:13] free bless the name of
[2:11:17] Jesus
[2:11:19] [Applause]
[2:11:22] [Music]
[2:11:25] um I'm I'm just so happy that uh brother
[2:11:30] Paul um stopped
[2:11:34] by um you know he's on vacation and he
[2:11:37] didn't have to just bring a thought to
[2:11:40] us just could have you know relaxed a
[2:11:42] little bit but um I'm so happy that he
[2:11:46] um he agreed to to to speak for us just
[2:11:50] you know I I feel like this is a series
[2:11:52] that we probably need to hear the whole
[2:11:56] series and uh it was just very very rich
[2:12:00] with a with a lot of content I know he
[2:12:02] just compressed a lot in just to try to
[2:12:04] get it to us but uh there there was a
[2:12:06] lot here church and I hope that we heard
[2:12:08] um from the Lord even as I was sitting
[2:12:12] there you know just
[2:12:14] meditating uh I don't think we should
[2:12:16] come to church kind of hear a sermon and
[2:12:19] then just go back home like we didn't
[2:12:21] hear
[2:12:23] anything God spoke here today yes he and
[2:12:28] and we got we got situations that we're
[2:12:30] all dealing with but God was trying to
[2:12:32] speak freedom to your circumstance and
[2:12:35] even showing us how the devil just kind
[2:12:37] of brings bondage in in so many
[2:12:39] different
[2:12:40] ways just basic things that we do on a
[2:12:42] day-to-day basis that we allow the enemy
[2:12:45] to bring bondage into our lives and then
[2:12:48] God comes with a sermon and and and
[2:12:51] brings Freedom uh as he was sharing that
[2:12:53] quote there's so much um oh Lord Jesus
[2:12:58] that quote going in my
[2:13:02] bag um you know we we had just come from
[2:13:05] a um a marriage conference in in um
[2:13:10] South Carolina and one of the things
[2:13:12] that um that I learned just through the
[2:13:15] years especially when it comes to
[2:13:17] husbands and wives is this um thing
[2:13:20] called the five love languages I've
[2:13:21] spoke about this to you all before and
[2:13:25] um now there are some that look at that
[2:13:26] and say well that's just
[2:13:28] psychology I need y'all to could we just
[2:13:31] bringing the quote back up paragraph
[2:13:34] 34 I want you to get
[2:13:37] pleased before before he gets there he
[2:13:41] tells the lady the lady say are you
[2:13:42] going to pray for
[2:13:44] me think about it I'm I'm not praying
[2:13:48] for you right because you're already
[2:13:50] free amen amen right this is this is
[2:13:54] this is what he tells her and then the
[2:13:55] other
[2:13:56] thing um you know he tells her he gives
[2:13:59] her
[2:14:00] advice and I want you to see the advice
[2:14:02] that he tells
[2:14:04] her go
[2:14:12] home not not not pray come here let me
[2:14:15] take some oil and anoint you and get
[2:14:17] this out of you no no go
[2:14:21] home straighten up your
[2:14:24] house cook your husband a nice big apple
[2:14:28] pie that thick now this is a Act of
[2:14:32] service that the prophet is telling this
[2:14:35] lady to use this is one of the Love
[2:14:37] Languages oh my when he comes in
[2:14:42] tonight he tells me to do something else
[2:14:45] throw both arms around him and look at
[2:14:48] this kiss him sit down and get on his
[2:14:53] lap now when when when they when they do
[2:14:56] when she does that that is physical
[2:14:59] touch that's right and then the ghost
[2:15:02] first then tell him you love him this is
[2:15:05] words of
[2:15:06] affirmation all in one little
[2:15:11] quote Oh Lord have mercy he never prayed
[2:15:15] for look at the advice that he gave her
[2:15:17] and I got another quote that I I shared
[2:15:19] I told I told Brother random say try
[2:15:21] this sometime yeah yeah he did it
[2:15:25] himself he say try this sometime and
[2:15:27] sometime we we we we don't even realize
[2:15:29] how much bondage we be in by just trying
[2:15:31] to uh avoid certain
[2:15:34] things God God want us to live in
[2:15:36] Freedom
[2:15:37] Church God I I I I don't know if y'all
[2:15:40] caught all these things today God just
[2:15:41] want us to live in Freedom we we we we
[2:15:44] don't realize how how how we how we bind
[2:15:46] ourselves up you know brother brandom
[2:15:48] used other people's material you know in
[2:15:51] order to bring certain thoughts he did
[2:15:53] that right so so please church let's
[2:15:55] walk in Freedom that God has given us
[2:15:57] let's let's understand this and and I
[2:16:00] just love I mean that quote was just so
[2:16:02] clenching because when he talked about
[2:16:03] Galatians and who hath Bewitched you the
[2:16:05] first thing went to my mind is uh if you
[2:16:08] if some of our young people may have
[2:16:09] never seen this and I want to encourage
[2:16:10] your parents to do this brother random
[2:16:13] um only recording we have audio I mean
[2:16:16] video recording is um um um deep color
[2:16:21] to the deep and you can see that all on
[2:16:23] it's on YouTube and everything but one
[2:16:25] of the things that's on that video
[2:16:27] brother brandom has a sister coming
[2:16:28] through the prayer line and he's in he's
[2:16:31] telling her uh what has happened it says
[2:16:33] you know you went to a preacher and uh
[2:16:37] they told you that you was a
[2:16:38] witch and uh when they told you that you
[2:16:40] was a witch now this has caused all not
[2:16:42] just trouble in your life but it's also
[2:16:44] caused trouble in your in your family
[2:16:46] and in the church
[2:16:48] because somebody told you this lie you
[2:16:50] the whole church is bound because
[2:16:52] because of this one
[2:16:53] lie and brother brandom told a lady to
[2:16:56] say look you're not you're not no witch
[2:16:58] that's a lie from that preacher you
[2:16:59] didn't got to believe that go on you're
[2:17:01] free from that now now when she accepted
[2:17:03] a freedom there's two things I want to
[2:17:05] say the scripture say he who the son
[2:17:07] sets free is free
[2:17:09] indeed how did the son set her
[2:17:14] free yes sir sir the truth that was
[2:17:17] revealed through the prophet that's
[2:17:18] right right and and even I I want to go
[2:17:21] a little further even today brother
[2:17:22] Brandon I mean brother brother Paul
[2:17:24] brings this message to us how did the
[2:17:27] son set us free
[2:17:29] today through the ministry of his
[2:17:33] son you understand is the ministry is
[2:17:36] flowing through his son brother Paul La
[2:17:39] fontain amen you know what that Ministry
[2:17:42] wants to flow through
[2:17:44] you as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:17:47] somebody needs to hear this and they can
[2:17:50] go
[2:17:51] free Jesus is speaking through you he
[2:17:55] wants to speak through you but you have
[2:17:57] to accept your freedom before you can
[2:17:59] bring somebody else to
[2:18:06] freedom I I want to tell you this this
[2:18:09] is
[2:18:10] revolutionary what we just heard here if
[2:18:12] you will allow this Amen to really go
[2:18:15] deep into your your your your your
[2:18:17] spirit this is revolutionary for your
[2:18:19] life I've been praying uh asking the
[2:18:22] Lord as we were um just approaching
[2:18:25] beginning of this year you all know that
[2:18:27] my theme has been our restore sayith the
[2:18:29] Lord and I've been asking the Lord just
[2:18:31] to kind of send me messages that would
[2:18:33] actually go right along with that theme
[2:18:36] I felt today this was a perfect
[2:18:39] connection but the restoration was
[2:18:41] something for
[2:18:43] us if if there is any bondage in your
[2:18:46] life God wants to to restore you back to
[2:18:48] a place of
[2:18:49] Freedom amen you don't have to get
[2:18:51] entangled again like
[2:18:57] this this was this was from
[2:19:01] Heaven I I know this was from heaven and
[2:19:04] I'm just grateful that God's servant got
[2:19:06] himself out of the way and allowed God
[2:19:07] to use him if it was for nobody else it
[2:19:10] was for me as I was sitting there and
[2:19:12] thought about uh a sickness that
[2:19:14] attacked my body some years ago and the
[2:19:18] reason and I felt I couldn't understand
[2:19:20] why this thing you know happened to me
[2:19:22] the way it is and I'm still uh fighting
[2:19:24] and struggling with it you know even
[2:19:26] today uh but what what happened I can
[2:19:30] clearly go back there was something
[2:19:31] going on in the
[2:19:33] church there was something happening in
[2:19:35] the church and um and I took it
[2:19:39] personal and when I took that personal
[2:19:42] then Satan had a way to start attacking
[2:19:45] my
[2:19:46] body so I learned amen I learned that uh
[2:19:51] you can't take it personal you have to
[2:19:54] just give it all to God and let God just
[2:19:57] handle it and you know not that you're
[2:19:59] not concerned but but you don't realize
[2:20:00] that the devil trying to when the
[2:20:02] devil's trying to wear you out you know
[2:20:04] what else he trying to do he trying to
[2:20:05] wear me
[2:20:06] out so we we heard last week what we're
[2:20:10] all connected right so so we got to
[2:20:14] understand Satan uses all of these
[2:20:15] little tactics and we have to be we have
[2:20:17] to be we got to be vigilant we got to
[2:20:20] understand what is going on here this is
[2:20:22] Attack on the whole body when one part
[2:20:24] of the body is hurting the rest of the
[2:20:26] body is
[2:20:28] hurting so it's so important church that
[2:20:30] we understand what what what what what's
[2:20:32] happening in a spiritual real I learned
[2:20:34] and in this point I just sat there I
[2:20:36] said Lord if there's anything from that
[2:20:39] experience that I'm holding that I might
[2:20:40] be harboring God I want to let that go
[2:20:43] because I want to experience your
[2:20:44] freedom your your will is is not for me
[2:20:48] to be ill and to be sick that's not
[2:20:51] God's will for me that's right that's
[2:20:53] right
[2:20:56] amen God's will is not for you to be
[2:20:58] sick his will is for us his will is for
[2:21:01] us to be in good health and to prosper
[2:21:04] even as our soul prospers I don't want
[2:21:06] to just take it as another sermon I said
[2:21:08] Lord if there's anything that I need to
[2:21:09] let go of I want to be restored back to
[2:21:12] my perfect health
[2:21:14] again that's what God had for me at the
[2:21:17] beginning and I came from somewhere I
[2:21:18] want to go back to it amen I believe the
[2:21:22] word of God is what sets us free I
[2:21:24] believe
[2:21:25] it and the word has come today to give
[2:21:28] us this Freedom let's walk in at church
[2:21:31] amen let's have a word of prayer
[2:21:36] father God you sent your servant here to
[2:21:39] speak and Lord I I I know for myself I
[2:21:43] have
[2:21:44] received God from Heaven to death day
[2:21:47] and Lord as I just did a just a a
[2:21:52] inventory and a reflection over my own
[2:21:54] life Lord just looking back at different
[2:21:56] things that triggered
[2:21:59] sickness Lord uh but the word kind of
[2:22:02] comes and helps us just to look at those
[2:22:04] things from a different angle and we can
[2:22:06] we can bring it to you Lord if there's
[2:22:08] anything in our hearts that we are
[2:22:11] harboring that we're holding on to God
[2:22:14] that we haven't uh released and just uh
[2:22:16] given true forgiveness to God deal with
[2:22:20] us in a way that we would do that
[2:22:21] because we realize uh the only thing
[2:22:24] that is hindered when we're holding on
[2:22:26] to things like that the only thing
[2:22:27] that's hindered is us and our bodies
[2:22:29] we're hindered Lord and our spiritual
[2:22:31] Walk we're hindered Lord in so many
[2:22:34] different ways we're hindered so God we
[2:22:35] want to really experience your freedom
[2:22:40] yes oh God we need that we heard that
[2:22:43] it's unlimited father the places that we
[2:22:46] can go in your Liberty and in your
[2:22:48] freedom and and Lord not only that when
[2:22:50] we as a bride come to a place of true
