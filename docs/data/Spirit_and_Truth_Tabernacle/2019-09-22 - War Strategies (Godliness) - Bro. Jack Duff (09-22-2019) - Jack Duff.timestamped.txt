[1:09:38] how to take care of things so we
[1:09:40] appreciate the Lord Jesus also wanted to
[1:09:47] just again just thank God for His mighty
[1:09:50] visitation a man or last Sunday she was
[1:09:56] and you know just we were here and we
[1:10:04] have been praying actually for service
[1:10:06] that Lord give us one of them services
[1:10:08] by the minister can't even stand the
[1:10:09] minister you know I put that in the
[1:10:11] brothers
[1:10:12] prayer group and you know we we've been
[1:10:14] praying about that and and God did it
[1:10:17] God did just that and the last week you
[1:10:19] know when when God moves the way that he
[1:10:22] moves like that that is a perfect time
[1:10:27] for everyone just to kind of enter in
[1:10:29] and just just allow the Lord just just
[1:10:31] yield of God you don't know how you'll
[1:10:32] speak to us and last week you know one
[1:10:37] of the brothers just began to kind of
[1:10:38] speak in tongues and while he was
[1:10:39] speaking of tongues it was praying like
[1:10:41] lord please give an interpretation you
[1:10:44] know because we've been in we've been on
[1:10:48] both sides of this one they speak in
[1:10:52] tongues and get no interpretation and
[1:10:54] the other is they afraid to speak in
[1:10:56] tongues because there's no interpreter
[1:10:58] we've been on both sides of this and
[1:11:00] we're trying to get in the middle of it
[1:11:02] a man so what's supposed to happen and
[1:11:05] if somebody speaks in tongues everybody
[1:11:07] should start praying for the
[1:11:08] interpretation not not wandering is this
[1:11:12] correct or is this not correct when you
[1:11:15] do that you actually hand in the Spirit
[1:11:17] of God right so you started praying God
[1:11:20] Lord Lord sitting the interpretation if
[1:11:22] you had anointing this person speaking
[1:11:23] tongue
[1:11:24] somebody got to have the interpretation
[1:11:27] and I guarantee if you begin to pray
[1:11:29] like that you might be the one that God
[1:11:32] would use to interpret his words right
[1:11:34] so you know we were you know I was just
[1:11:36] encourage everybody shield just yield
[1:11:39] just yield and and you know and and and
[1:11:42] and and I know one of the brothers just
[1:11:44] began to pray and he was praying for an
[1:11:46] interpretation and and then just brother
[1:11:49] Troy just began to kind of speak some
[1:11:51] some words just about freedom about
[1:11:55] freedom and things like that and and you
[1:11:58] know so after I heard brother Troy speak
[1:12:00] what he spoke it it brought a
[1:12:05] confirmation to me so I called for an
[1:12:07] altar call for people to come free right
[1:12:10] and so after service we all kind of got
[1:12:12] together and talked the rest you know
[1:12:13] brother Quinton was speaking in tongues
[1:12:15] brother Troy I believe I got the
[1:12:16] interpretation it was it was for the
[1:12:18] people to go free because when you said
[1:12:20] in a pulpit I knew that was the
[1:12:22] confirmation to me yes so as God was
[1:12:23] working on all these ins I said Lord we
[1:12:26] know that you're doing now what's gonna
[1:12:27] happen is that God just gonna fine-tune
[1:12:30] this as we yield you're gonna see God
[1:12:36] fine-tuning but these are things that we
[1:12:38] prayed about now it's one thing if you
[1:12:40] start fixing up your hair and your
[1:12:42] stockings and you know what I'm saying
[1:12:44] while I'm trying to preach and then you
[1:12:45] gotta you got a word from the Lord no
[1:12:47] we're not talk about that but when he
[1:12:49] come in like that when he come in like
[1:12:53] that everybody needs to yield but God
[1:12:57] moved in this place God moved in this
[1:13:00] place
[1:13:05] you don't you never know when you're
[1:13:07] gonna stop by you never know and I want
[1:13:10] to encourage y'all y'all better start
[1:13:12] pressing through everything y'all can
[1:13:13] the given to the presence of God because
[1:13:15] what the devil gonna be fighting you in
[1:13:17] every way he possibly can to stop you
[1:13:20] from being able to enter in so but we
[1:13:22] had it we had a wonderful time and I
[1:13:24] encourage you if you don't haven't had a
[1:13:26] chance go back and listen to the service
[1:13:29] you'll be blessed a man you'll be
[1:13:31] blessed by God's mighty presence a man
[1:13:35] praise the Lord I want to read a man
[1:13:39] since I didn't get a chance to preach
[1:13:41] last week I preached this week they ran
[1:13:43] by God's grace and I'm okay with not
[1:13:45] preaching you know like my cousins say
[1:13:47] I'm content a man a man a man a man
[1:13:51] she's content but we won content a man a
[1:13:56] man let's stand Tuffy
[1:13:58] let's turn in our Bibles to 2nd Peter
[1:14:01] chapter 1 as we just continue our
[1:14:05] journey a man a man a man a man a man a
[1:14:11] man 3 Scott here in 2nd Peter chapter 1
[1:14:20] verse 3 through 10 when I saw brother
[1:14:25] Larry on Friday I believe what I say
[1:14:28] when y'all leave when y'all leave
[1:14:29] Lynette leave he say on Sunday night oh
[1:14:32] wow put in a worship service I was
[1:14:36] feeling led to have a worship service
[1:14:37] but but we understand brother and sister
[1:14:41] daily so good to see y'all amen and the
[1:14:43] housework god bless y'all god bless
[1:14:45] y'all from North Carolina they meant
[1:14:47] always good to see them in God's house
[1:14:50] here the Bible says in verse 3 according
[1:14:54] as his divine power hath given unto us
[1:14:57] all things that pertain unto life and
[1:14:59] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:15:03] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[1:15:07] this whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:15:10] great and precious promises that by
[1:15:12] these you might be partakers of the
[1:15:14] divine nature
[1:15:16] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:15:19] the world through lust and beside this
[1:15:23] given all diligence add to your faith
[1:15:25] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[1:15:28] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:15:31] patience and to patience godliness we'll
[1:15:35] be talking about that on today a man
[1:15:37] godliness says and to godliness
[1:15:41] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:15:43] kindness charity for if these things be
[1:15:47] in you and abound they make you that ye
[1:15:51] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[1:15:53] and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:15:55] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[1:15:58] is blind and cannot see afar off and
[1:16:02] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[1:16:05] his old sins where form the rather
[1:16:08] brethren give diligence to make your
[1:16:10] calling and election sure but if you do
[1:16:13] these things you shall never fail fall
[1:16:17] let me give you one more scripture a man
[1:16:21] here in Matthew chapter 5 a man
[1:16:25] verse 43 through 48 glory to God Matthew
[1:16:34] five a man a man
[1:16:41] man thank you Jesus verse 43 says says
[1:16:49] ye have heard that it hath been said
[1:16:51] thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate
[1:16:54] thine enemy that's what you heard it
[1:16:59] being said but I say unto you love your
[1:17:03] enemies this is the words of Jesus love
[1:17:08] your enemies bless them that curse you
[1:17:17] now this is how heart cuz some of us
[1:17:20] almost lose our religion when folk curse
[1:17:25] us huh they man your language bout to
[1:17:29] change like Peters come on somebody
[1:17:33] but the Bible declares that we are
[1:17:36] supposed to bless them that curse thee
[1:17:39] so if we cursed by some others that god
[1:17:41] bless you god bless you what god bless
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:47] all right now I guarantee you'll change
[1:17:50] some situations if you do this but I say
[1:17:53] to you love your enemies bless them that
[1:17:55] curse you do good to them that hate you
[1:17:59] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:18:03] you thank that's something no I mean you
[1:18:08] ain't you ain't you ain't ready to pray
[1:18:09] for nobody out there they despitefully
[1:18:10] use you ain't man but this is what Jesus
[1:18:14] told us to do right pray for them which
[1:18:16] despitefully use you're not only that
[1:18:18] and persecute you amen hallelujah that
[1:18:24] you made me the children of your father
[1:18:26] which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun
[1:18:29] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[1:18:32] sendeth rain on the just and on the
[1:18:35] unjust for if you love them which love
[1:18:39] you what reward have ye do not even the
[1:18:44] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:18:47] your brethren only Lord ain't that's
[1:18:51] something as you know we walk right by
[1:18:53] people don't even say god bless you

[1:20:37] man war strategies godliness war
[1:20:42] strategies godliness we've just been in
[1:20:45] this journey a man where we are taking a
[1:20:48] foundation from the virtues a man of
[1:20:53] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:20:54] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:20:56] and charity we're taking a foundation
[1:21:00] using that and then going back into the
[1:21:02] Old Testament and showing where that
[1:21:04] virtue or that strategy a man was used
[1:21:07] to overcome in a battle and so I pray
[1:21:11] that the Lord would just direct us today
[1:21:12] as we go through war strategy or
[1:21:14] strategies godliness I want to start did
[1:21:18] I give you all my quotes I think I might
[1:21:21] have put it on the table already from
[1:21:24] last week it might if it's not there
[1:21:28] then it's in my office just on my desk
[1:21:30] but I might have put it right on the top
[1:21:32] there war strategies godliness and if
[1:21:36] not brothers just checked my desk real
[1:21:38] quick for it I have it there here's the
[1:21:41] date that I'll give you a 62 oh you got
[1:21:45] it okay convinced and then concerned
[1:21:47] convinced and then concern I want to
[1:21:49] read the brethren the time is at hand
[1:21:53] the prophecy says it pays the Christian
[1:21:57] not to just join the church or to depend
[1:22:01] upon some maneuver or some sensation or
[1:22:06] something on that way but to be sure
[1:22:09] that you're right right it pays for a
[1:22:13] man the Christian not to just depend on
[1:22:16] some maneuver or some sensation or
[1:22:19] something on that way but to be sure
[1:22:20] that you're right because see you can
[1:22:22] come to church and shout and then go out
[1:22:24] and live like a devil right but God has
[1:22:27] called us to a much higher plane than
[1:22:29] that a man he's caused to a place where
[1:22:32] he wants to be manifested a man in our
[1:22:35] sixteen elements so you know let's go
[1:22:38] beyond the sensation amen let's go
[1:22:40] beyond the feel-good Amen let's go all
[1:22:43] the way into the life of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ he says now there is so much
[1:22:47] today that we have some allows it to
[1:22:50] schooling some allows it to learning
[1:22:52] Creed's some allows it to little funny
[1:22:55] feelings some allows it to different
[1:22:57] things which I don't have nothing
[1:22:58] against that that's all right
[1:23:00] but that's not what I'm talking about
[1:23:01] you
[1:23:02] have that without having the real thing
[1:23:05] see it said and that's what we're trying
[1:23:07] to say we must be sure because the time
[1:23:10] is at hand for the real pouring out of
[1:23:13] the Holy Spirit he promised he would
[1:23:16] pour it out in the last days we felt
[1:23:19] that last week we feel it every time we
[1:23:22] come together the pouring out that he
[1:23:23] promised in the last days he goes on to
[1:23:26] say this now there is so many people say
[1:23:28] if you quiver a man hold your eyes shut
[1:23:32] do all kinds of things and get sensation
[1:23:35] you get spirits friends a man when you
[1:23:39] start depending on that you get spirits
[1:23:41] friends he says but if you if your life
[1:23:44] don't tell you to what your profession
[1:23:47] then there's something wrong with the
[1:23:49] spirit to God glory to God see and it's
[1:23:53] true see and you must be sure the Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit will bring forth a holy life I
[1:24:00] say I say amen to that the Holy Spirit
[1:24:04] will bring forth a holy life that is
[1:24:07] right and if the desiring is in your
[1:24:09] heart if you have to force yourself
[1:24:12] constantly to try to press and do what's
[1:24:15] right then the world is still hungry in
[1:24:18] you can I say that again I mean if you
[1:24:22] got to make yourself live right if you
[1:24:26] can't live right to the pastor call you
[1:24:28] or you can't live right to you
[1:24:30] surrounded by the same steps there's
[1:24:32] something wrong with your experience a
[1:24:34] man if that's the way it is with you you
[1:24:37] got to be able to live right no weapon
[1:24:39] no matter where you are
[1:24:40] and if you got the Holy Ghost on the
[1:24:42] inside it'll keep you huh it'll keep you
[1:24:47] in Jamaica when you have all by yourself
[1:24:51] it'll keep you in Africa if you were
[1:24:53] there all by yourself it'll keep you in
[1:24:56] San Francisco if you were there all by
[1:24:59] yourself the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:04] come on somebody a manly I mean when
[1:25:08] you're in school and ain't nobody

[1:25:46] says this he says if you have to force
[1:25:49] yourself constantly right you force
[1:25:53] yourself constantly to try to press and
[1:25:55] do what's right that the world is still
[1:25:58] hungry in you then there's something
[1:26:00] wrong see the Holy Spirit in you will
[1:26:02] not hunger for the world the Holy Spirit

[1:26:13] for you to go to church and press
[1:26:16] yourself to come when the church is open
[1:26:19] there is something wrong oh I like that
[1:26:26] that's what that's what I was thinking
[1:26:28] that's what the prophets say if it's
[1:26:31] hard for you to get the church man it's
[1:26:32] just hard for me something's wrong there
[1:26:36] was a time your life you can wait for
[1:26:38] the church doors to be open right so
[1:26:40] when you start lifting I've seen that
[1:26:42] just kind of wait awaiting away
[1:26:43] something has gone wrong somewhere
[1:26:46] praise the Lord any high listen he said
[1:26:49] there's something wrong with that spirit
[1:26:53] it's trying to keep you away from God
[1:26:55] the spirit of God will run you right
[1:26:58] straight to the church every time the
[1:27:01] door opens for fellowship yes sir
[1:27:04] see so you've got to be sure this now
[1:27:06] the time is that him if I could just
[1:27:09] encourage you do your own personal
[1:27:11] evaluation amen and make sure that you
[1:27:14] you
[1:27:14] you where you need to be in God you know
[1:27:16] sometimes we get blessings and we
[1:27:18] actually get further away from God
[1:27:20] we really got blessings with this I mean
[1:27:23] I I learned a long time ago as God give
[1:27:25] me more I'm giving him more I'm trying
[1:27:27] to find more to give him more time more
[1:27:30] that's my ask God give me more I got to
[1:27:33] give him more praise the Lord this is
[1:27:35] not this should not work the opposite
[1:27:37] God just blessed with this and you
[1:27:38] testify about two blessing and then we
[1:27:41] can't see you in church Oh hallelujah
[1:27:45] glory to God somebody but we are you
[1:27:48] know we want to make sure that we do a
[1:27:50] self-evaluation a checkup and then just
[1:27:53] make sure that we're on the right path
[1:27:54] it's not just about a feelings not about
[1:27:56] an emotion a man what are you doing
[1:27:59] after that feeling all that emotion
[1:28:00] comes upon you what life are you live in
[1:28:02] then that's what we're watching let's go
[1:28:04] onto this message the statue of a
[1:28:05] perfect man the prophet makes this
[1:28:07] comment says but if you got genuine
[1:28:09] faith then put genuine virtue to it
[1:28:12] since then genuine knowledge then
[1:28:15] genuine temperance then genuine patience
[1:28:19] glory to God it says see you're moving
[1:28:22] right on up the line all right
[1:28:24] fifthly at godliness since oh my god
[1:28:29] leanness to be at it what does godliness
[1:28:31] mean since I looked in four or five
[1:28:35] dictionaries and couldn't even find what
[1:28:37] it meant finally I was down at brother
[1:28:40] Jeffrey's there we found it in a
[1:28:42] dictionary godliness means to be like
[1:28:45] God it's a very simple simple definition
[1:28:49] godliness means to be like God and and
[1:28:52] as brother Branham was just kind of
[1:28:54] teaching on this when it's preaching the
[1:28:56] message the statue of a perfect man he
[1:28:58] took us to two scriptures one is gonna
[1:29:02] be in what we just read in Matthew
[1:29:04] chapter 5 and the other is going to be
[1:29:06] Ephesians 4 but as he talked about about
[1:29:10] this virtue godliness it many took us to
[1:29:12] these two scriptures and just made a few
[1:29:14] comments on try to get some of that
[1:29:15] today but it says first godliness means
[1:29:18] to be like God oh my after you got faith
[1:29:21] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:29:25] then
[1:29:25] like God glory to God didn't then be
[1:29:28] like God that is our objective to be
[1:29:31] like Jesus amen I'm not trying to be
[1:29:34] like my brother I'm not trying to be
[1:29:35] like my sister I'm trying to be like
[1:29:38] Jesus in many sense you say I can't do
[1:29:41] that brother branham it says so yes you
[1:29:43] can let me just read you a few
[1:29:45] scriptures here just a minute here
[1:29:47] Matthew 5:48 will take this one and see
[1:29:51] what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see
[1:29:53] if you're supposed to be like God you
[1:29:56] know the Bible says ye are gods jesus
[1:30:00] said so why all the virtue all the
[1:30:03] things that's in God Oh hallelujah all
[1:30:07] the things that same God is in you hey
[1:30:13] man Matthew 5:48 he says be a jesus
[1:30:16] speaking in a beatitude being therefore
[1:30:18] PE RF EC T what's that perfect even as
[1:30:25] your father not just you know I gotta
[1:30:27] inject there just for a little bit
[1:30:29] because you know we'll use these
[1:30:31] comments you know nobody's perfect we
[1:30:34] can't be perfect you know and and and
[1:30:37] you know and we just we just we harp on
[1:30:40] that you know I saw somebody post
[1:30:42] something like that I couldn't like it I
[1:30:44] couldn't know in the scripture right
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:47] I think I get what you trying to say
[1:30:50] Amen but you got to be careful with what
[1:30:52] you putting out there
[1:30:53] hallelujah because hallelujah can I can
[1:30:57] I just tell you if you're not balancing
[1:30:58] what you stand with scripture don't say
[1:31:00] it right if you ain't balancing it with
[1:31:03] scripture just don't say it because cuz
[1:31:05] it's very easy for somebody said now
[1:31:07] what about this scripture right here
[1:31:09] right you're saying you can't be perfect
[1:31:11] but Jesus said to be perfect hallelujah
[1:31:14] Lord Jesus says if they say this is a
[1:31:18] mandate this is the commandment we must
[1:31:22] come to perfection let me just put it
[1:31:25] this way if you're not perfect you will
[1:31:27] not door in the rapture
[1:31:29] I mean if you if you don't reach this
[1:31:35] status then you won't go in the rapture
[1:31:37] what we need to do is always look at our
[1:31:39] sin side look how am I meant or not when
[1:31:42] it comes to these virtues how am i
[1:31:44] expressing this to my fellow man I think
[1:31:46] as it pertains to these virtues because
[1:31:48] business was bringing me to perfection
[1:31:51] let's go on let's read this now cuz I
[1:31:53] got some cool cyma give you and a
[1:31:55] manager says you say say PE RF EC T
[1:32:01] what's that perfect even as your father
[1:32:03] in heaven is perfect you got way up here
[1:32:06] now before you ask to do that all these
[1:32:09] things has to be added first then when
[1:32:11] you get up here he's asked you now to be
[1:32:15] perfect godliness sons and daughters of
[1:32:18] God that's right how many things I could
[1:32:21] say along that line now he goes on and
[1:32:25] and and he reads Ephesians 4 let's just
[1:32:28] read that really quick because you know
[1:32:30] he brings this in he brings Matthew 5
[1:32:32] and he brings he fusions for when he's
[1:32:34] talking about perfection godliness a man
[1:32:38] is being like God it's coming to a place
[1:32:41] of perfection and he brings ephesians 4
[1:32:44] 11 through 13 we'll just read this glory
[1:32:47] to God amen just for you know just so we
[1:32:51] see what what the ministry is even all
[1:32:53] about
[1:32:54] alright glory to God verse 11 says and
[1:32:57] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[1:33:00] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:33:04] and teachers hallelujah right so God
[1:33:09] gives us these gifts a man and and they
[1:33:13] have a very specific purpose the reason
[1:33:15] that God gives us this we come to this
[1:33:17] distance earth imperfect a man we come
[1:33:21] amen into the world speaking lies amen
[1:33:24] we we come boring and seeing but but God
[1:33:27] has to give us a mint some things to
[1:33:29] help bring us to perfection amen when
[1:33:32] God is using a sermon to come from the
[1:33:36] pulpit that's
[1:33:37] not something just to go in one ear not
[1:33:39] the other remember God is trying to get
[1:33:42] something to register down in your
[1:33:43] spirit man that it might bring you to a
[1:33:46] place where God can be pleased with the
[1:33:49] life that you live in hallelujah amen
[1:33:52] we gotta understand that amen life is
[1:33:54] not a picnic there will be some tests
[1:33:57] there will be some trials and in the
[1:33:59] midst of every testing and the myths of
[1:34:01] every trial God is trying to see how you
[1:34:03] gonna respond email hallelujah

[1:38:20] influence of another what is what is
[1:38:24] what is referring to is Isiah because
[1:38:27] that was his that was his scripture that
[1:38:28] he was using amen Isaiah the King was
[1:38:32] under the influence and I'm sorry there
[1:38:35] the prophet was under the influence of a
[1:38:38] king King Uzziah Oh hallelujah you got
[1:38:43] to learn you cannot put your trust in
[1:38:45] any man because he will fail you every
[1:38:49] time you
[1:38:50] Trust has got to be in God hallelujah
[1:38:54] you can't discourage with a man get
[1:38:56] discouraged you can't get discouraged
[1:38:59] with another one and get discouraged you
[1:39:01] gotta be determined to keep pressing on
[1:39:03] because your confidence
[1:39:06] it's an almighty call and I'm gonna tell
[1:39:10] you this man may fail but God will never
[1:39:13] fail brothers you give up wanna keep
[1:39:19] pressing on but sometimes we are
[1:39:25] underneath the influence of another we
[1:39:28] do things based on what this person said
[1:39:31] we haven't even checked the Word of God
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:38] right even if they religious are yelling
[1:39:43] with me even if they religious you can't
[1:39:46] be under the influence can I preach this
[1:39:49] for a little bit there was a prophet in
[1:39:53] first Kings 13 went into the city and
[1:39:56] prophesied God told him when you go
[1:39:59] prophesied don't you sit down and eat
[1:40:02] with nobody when you go into the city go
[1:40:05] out a different way don't fellowship
[1:40:08] with nobody you know the Prophet did he
[1:40:13] when I was sitting away he went have a
[1:40:14] different way but why he was on his way
[1:40:16] going he got caught up by a man two
[1:40:19] young men they were sons of a prophet
[1:40:22] they said my daddy wants to invite you
[1:40:24] to come in and eat with us no I'm not
[1:40:27] supposed to go I'm not supposed so so
[1:40:30] some kind of waiting the daddy shows up
[1:40:32] to to this prophecy I'm a prophet too
[1:40:35] I'm a prophet too and God told me to
[1:40:39] tell you to come to my house be
[1:40:41] careful you bringing yourself underneath
[1:40:44] their fuel influence of another you
[1:40:47] better stay with what God told you to do
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:52] Jesus went back to the house under the
[1:40:56] influence of this older prophet sat down
[1:40:59] got his belly full ain't real good
[1:41:03] licking his fingers and after you lick
[1:41:12] this last finger
[1:41:13] Ravi stood up and did water Papa sighs
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:21] see that's the way the devil do you
[1:41:23] sexual and after you done did wrong they
[1:41:27] rise up and let somebody prophesy and
[1:41:32] then the mayor promised silence because
[1:41:33] you came home to eat with me it's gonna
[1:41:37] be a lion wait for you on the side of
[1:41:38] the road and don't matter which road he
[1:41:44] took home no matter no matter when he
[1:41:49] left to go home he might a waiter to
[1:41:51] hold three months maybe thinking God
[1:41:54] forgot but a lion gonna meet you on the
[1:41:58] side of the road prophesied and when he
[1:42:01] got the long side road guess what a lion
[1:42:03] met him he was under the influence of
[1:42:06] another hallelujah you got to stand at
[1:42:11] influence of what God's Word speaks to
[1:42:13] you a man even man see so so so here he
[1:42:20] stole my Isaiah because Isaiah as a as a
[1:42:23] as a prophet is influenced by this King
[1:42:26] Uzziah you know he was a godly man but
[1:42:30] you sire got to a spot where he did
[1:42:31] something that he wasn't supposed to do
[1:42:33] he and when brother Branham say remember
[1:42:35] last night don't try to take another
[1:42:36] man's office Uzziah try to take the
[1:42:39] priests office Oh y'all y'all ain't

[1:42:51] - they're yelling with me don't don't
[1:42:55] don't don't try - don't try to
[1:42:57] manipulate and navigate to put yourself
[1:43:01] in places that God actually called you -
[1:43:05] a man you might desire that but you
[1:43:12] gotta wait for God I'm a living witness
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:16] and i'ma tell you something you know
[1:43:18] that I could I could go back in my in my
[1:43:20] in my younger days and you know now when
[1:43:22] I would go to funerals and things like

[1:43:26] I went to the funeral I want just what's
[1:43:28] just there just for the you know just
[1:43:30] for the person that was being buried I'm
[1:43:32] watching everything at the funeral right
[1:43:34] I'm watching everything now I say you
[1:43:35] know what one day I might have to sing I
[1:43:37] need to be prepared you know one day I
[1:43:40] might actually have to preach a funeral
[1:43:41] I need to be prepared now I don't know
[1:43:44] when that day gonna come I'm not I'm not
[1:43:45] waiting on the next feeling to go knock
[1:43:47] on the funeral directors door say do you
[1:43:49] need a preacher see that's that's you
[1:43:53] pushing yourself come on right that's
[1:43:57] you pushing yourself it's one thing for
[1:43:59] you to call them it's another thing when
[1:44:02] they call you when they call you God has
[1:44:08] placed it on their heart to get in
[1:44:11] contact with you but when you call then
[1:44:13] you trying to push yourself
[1:44:16] and sometimes you can get ahead of God
[1:44:18] by pushing yourself you create no
[1:44:21] problems I know I'm preaching this
[1:44:26] morning I know I'm preaching that's why
[1:44:31] God blessed our last week he knew this
[1:44:33] message was coming
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:37] amen

[1:45:12] ready to play no that ain't the way this
[1:45:15] thing work

[1:45:20] kind of time you spinning
[1:45:21] can you play like David when ain't
[1:45:23] nobody looking only thing here you as a
[1:45:26] bear a lion but you and the will this
[1:45:32] just playing why you watching sheep you
[1:45:34] play in praise God be faithful over a
[1:45:37] few things God will make you ruler over
[1:45:39] many but don't try to take the other
[1:45:41] man's office you sire try to take the
[1:45:45] office of a priest and when he did he
[1:45:48] end up contracting leprosy right you
[1:45:53] know because he actually got in the way
[1:45:55] of I mean this was a god called office
[1:45:58] and when it went up when the Bible say
[1:46:00] he gave he gave that mean God gives God
[1:46:08] gives a man I know what I'm talking
[1:46:12] about here this morning it's got to be
[1:46:14] God a man's gift will make room for
[1:46:17] himself and
[1:46:20] before a great man but when you see
[1:46:23] people scheming and conniving and doing
[1:46:26] a yoga spirit just facts you can't do it
[1:46:30] that way and expect God to bless it
[1:46:33] don't try to take it another man's
[1:46:36] office right so so you know I looked at
[1:46:39] I was just looking at this I said
[1:46:41] watching King Uzziah try to take the
[1:46:44] place of an anointed priests and and he
[1:46:45] ended up dying a leper see you sire got
[1:46:48] out of his place and the Prophet
[1:46:51] mentioned in that message influence of
[1:46:55] another because it would be a good one
[1:46:56] for you to go back and listen to the
[1:46:58] influence of another 1962 10 13 he says
[1:47:02] I says the mms says the prophet
[1:47:04] mentioned that men and women were also
[1:47:06] getting out of their place so here that
[1:47:09] prophet got out of his place you know
[1:47:11] men and women today I starting to get
[1:47:13] out of a place you got to know your
[1:47:19] place in a household a husband got to
[1:47:22] know his place the wife got to know her
[1:47:24] place praise the Lord
[1:47:27] a man the wife follows the husband not
[1:47:30] leads them amen the wife gotta always
[1:47:35] find myself subjecting not leading
[1:47:40] praise the Lord Amen glory to God right
[1:47:45] I mean you got to you got to know these
[1:47:46] things because when things get out of
[1:47:48] chaos if it starts at home out of chaos
[1:47:50] you'll bring that to the church and then
[1:47:54] we gonna have problems cuz God and
[1:47:59] colder women to lead the church can I
[1:48:02] say that again God did not call the
[1:48:04] women to lead the church I'm saying a
[1:48:11] lot here today we're trying to be like
[1:48:13] gods amen
[1:48:15] praise the Lord don't try to take
[1:48:19] another's place a man Church all right
[1:48:24] all right we you know we're not when I
[1:48:26] met we you know we pray that God would
[1:48:29] send us the right people for the right
[1:48:31] positions I will not put nobody in
[1:48:33] position just because you understand I'm
[1:48:37] watching things things that I might not
[1:48:40] even tell you I'm watching but I can't
[1:48:43] and let me tell you another thing when
[1:48:46] God gives these gifts Lord help me to
[1:48:48] get back to my thought but when God
[1:48:49] gives these gifts God they were already
[1:48:53] born with certain qualities leadership
[1:48:57] is something you born with it ain't
[1:49:00] something you go to school in a quiet
[1:49:03] how you know that let's talk about them
[1:49:05] bucks brother branham tells us about
[1:49:08] some ducks right he said they all pulled
[1:49:12] on the same link
[1:49:13] praise God they all bought on the same
[1:49:17] link and at a certain time of year every
[1:49:20] duck knows they have to get off that
[1:49:22] Lake and start heading south and he say
[1:49:25] there's one done praise God let's go and
[1:49:35] just beginning say huh huh huh
[1:49:38] and the other ducks can identify with
[1:49:42] the anointed leader and when they when
[1:49:46] they hear is something about his honk
[1:49:48] there might be other dogs honking - but
[1:49:51] is something about his huh
[1:49:54] God gave him a different hump than they
[1:49:56] gave you so I don't care how much you
[1:49:59] Hulk I'm not travel with I'm listening
[1:50:02] to that huh

[1:50:06] my way south

[1:50:36] to take another's place don't try to
[1:50:41] take another man's office don't do it
[1:50:44] hey man that's why I said a few weeks
[1:50:47] ago we got one deacon now we believe in
[1:50:49] God from oh but until they come you
[1:50:52] follow let me tell you another thing
[1:50:54] about a good leader what you say
[1:51:02] a good leader will always be a good
[1:51:05] follower if you can't follow ain't no
[1:51:13] way ain't no way you gonna lead I'm a
[1:51:22] living witness I still follow my pastor
[1:51:24] and I have expressed that and lived at
[1:51:29] in front of y'all for years any time I
[1:51:32] go to underneath his church I'm not
[1:51:34] trying to rule nothing I follow what you
[1:51:38] need brother wesco yes brother wesco
[1:51:40] sure brother Wescoe I may not agree with
[1:51:43] it gree with it but I'm still yes
[1:51:45] brother wesco yes brother Wescoe I
[1:51:50] learned how to submit myself humble
[1:51:54] yourself in the sight of God and He will
[1:51:59] exalt you see men and women also getting
[1:52:11] out of a place the nation is losing this
[1:52:16] place to brother Branham saying all that
[1:52:18] and this it talked about how this this
[1:52:21] young lady was sent home from school
[1:52:24] because she wore shorts to school back
[1:52:27] in his day she wore shorts in and in
[1:52:29] school they saw her with the shorts on
[1:52:31] say um this is not appropriate home home
[1:52:37] that was in his day and then also in his
[1:52:40] day he said times change because then
[1:52:42] there was some there was a there was
[1:52:45] another young lady expelled because she
[1:52:47] wouldn't wear shorts to school parents
[1:52:51] had to go to court because they didn't
[1:52:53] believe that right he said times were
[1:52:55] just change day the nation was getting
[1:52:57] out of this place the daddies was
[1:52:59] getting out of their place a husband's
[1:53:01] getting out of a place wives getting out
[1:53:03] of a place you got to understand your
[1:53:06] place if you don't know read it in the
[1:53:08] Bible but everybody got to find a place
[1:53:12] a man a man sisters should always prefer
[1:53:18] to brothers when it come to leadership
[1:53:22] always always sister should not be
[1:53:28] trying to push yourself to lead nothing
[1:53:30] now that something sisters need to take
[1:53:32] care if we understand that but if a
[1:53:34] brother kind of you know and that you
[1:53:35] should always kind of prefer that
[1:53:37] brother because that's his role a man
[1:53:43] now and I know and I know that the other
[1:53:45] side discusses up some other brothers
[1:53:46] don't sometimes some things we don't
[1:53:49] know what we doing and just because
[1:53:52] you're a man you ain't got the kind of
[1:53:53] show ever say I'm a man I'm here you
[1:53:56] don't even know nothing about nothing
[1:53:58] praise the Lord so I want to keep a
[1:54:00] balance that but the sister should act
[1:54:02] in a way what she's preferring him you
[1:54:04] know brother I respect you and you know
[1:54:06] you you cuz you lead in prayer could you
[1:54:08] this could you that could sister should
[1:54:09] always be doing that always a man a man
[1:54:14] glory to God alright I'm coming I'm
[1:54:17] coming
[1:54:18] let me uh let me just read this quote
[1:54:20] out of influence for another
[1:54:22] look at this the profit makes this
[1:54:23] statement and the same sir me says
[1:54:25] remember last night so this is what was
[1:54:28] happening last night right the influence
[1:54:31] of another it says when you're playing a
[1:54:33] ballgame
[1:54:34] as as it's football season is this an
[1:54:43] appropriate quote when you're playing a
[1:54:50] ball game as it's football season the
[1:54:53] things we want to do is is not everybody
[1:54:57] try to take the ball away from the man
[1:55:00] that's got it he is trying to guard that
[1:55:05] man protect him let him get through
[1:55:11] right we're trying to make a goal see
[1:55:16] but but could you imagine a team so
[1:55:19] untrained glory has to find one man
[1:55:23] their own man with the ball running to
[1:55:28] the field goal now you can tell brother
[1:55:29] branham didn't follow sports
[1:55:32] like a man running to the field goal and
[1:55:36] then instead of trying to knock the
[1:55:38] enemy away from him the opposing team to
[1:55:41] let your own man that's got the ball
[1:55:43] take off with it every man trying to
[1:55:46] take the ball out of his hand while
[1:55:49] you're bound to lose seven today we have
[1:55:54] the same thing when we see God come on
[1:55:57] the scene and going to bless a certain
[1:55:59] thing let's keep all the enemies away
[1:56:02] from it let's let's use our influences
[1:56:06] as tackles not runners now you know I
[1:56:13] played football let me finish reading
[1:56:16] this as tackles not runners tackles that
[1:56:18] protects to run them lets him pack the
[1:56:21] ball through because there's no
[1:56:23] opposition all he has to do is just keep
[1:56:25] running we should be tackles now you
[1:56:30] know if you understand football you know
[1:56:32] that that is a position in football a
[1:56:34] tackle
[1:56:35] that's a position guards and tackles we
[1:56:38] have that but but but the other thing
[1:56:40] about a tackle when I was playing
[1:56:42] football everybody that come out for the
[1:56:45] team want to be either the quarterback
[1:56:47] the running back y receiver they want to
[1:56:53] do something that that shines y'all
[1:56:56] ain't gonna work with me they want they
[1:56:58] want to do something that gets a teach
[1:57:00] nobody want to be no tackle you know a
[1:57:03] tackle don't get no attention he gets no
[1:57:06] commercials huh he I mean that nobody
[1:57:12] even knows his name
[1:57:14] but if he wasn't on the team the team
[1:57:17] would not win he's extremely important
[1:57:22] he protects the quarterback he opens up
[1:57:25] holes for the for the running back to go
[1:57:28] through right if that tackle was not
[1:57:30] doing his job no way that team were we
[1:57:34] so what we need him brother and say we
[1:57:37] me tackles not quarterbacks not wide
[1:57:41] receivers not running backs tackles and
[1:57:46] if I was on the defensive side of the
[1:57:47] ball
[1:57:48] amen the tackle would be the one that's
[1:57:50] right over the ball amen he's on the
[1:57:52] front line getting him he's the first
[1:57:55] one to get here the linebacker just
[1:57:58] stand behind these guys and read what is
[1:58:01] going on the safety in the quarterbacks
[1:58:03] can just read everything but this guy
[1:58:05] could get hit soon as they say hi he's
[1:58:08] gonna get hit brother and say we need
[1:58:11] tackles anybody ready to get hit right
[1:58:17] how many want to be a no-name
[1:58:24] some writers say I'm just a nobody
[1:58:28] trying to tell everybody about somebody
[1:58:31] that can save anybody we all need to
[1:58:35] learn to beat tackles hallelujah humble
[1:58:41] yourself become a tackle all right let
[1:58:44] me let me go on and talk about
[1:58:46] perfection the Prophet made this
[1:58:49] statement we read it early I just go
[1:58:51] back and quote it out of thinkers
[1:58:55] paragraph 299 and in a statue of a
[1:58:58] perfect man around paragraph 301
[1:59:01] so this godliness means to be like God
[1:59:04] oh my after you got faith virtue
[1:59:06] knowledge temperance patience then be
[1:59:08] like God Wu says you say I can't do that
[1:59:12] brother Branham says oh yes you can let
[1:59:15] me just read you a few scriptures here
[1:59:17] just a minute Matthew 5:48 will take
[1:59:20] this one and see what it sounds like
[1:59:22] Matthew 5:48 see if you're supposed to
[1:59:24] be like God you know the Bible says ye
[1:59:27] are gods jesus said so why all the
[1:59:29] virtue all the things that's in God is
[1:59:32] in you Matthew 5:48 so now he's
[1:59:36] referring there so again he refers to
[1:59:38] Matthew 5:48 he refers also to Ephesians
[1:59:41] in Man chapter form and and there in
[1:59:44] Matthew 5:48 says be perfect even as
[1:59:46] your father in heaven is perfect we're
[1:59:49] called to this perfection this is what
[1:59:51] godliness is all about being like God a
[1:59:54] man and he makes a statement I'm gonna
[1:59:57] go on to a couple quotes here oh my it
[2:00:01] makes a statement out of the message the
[2:00:03] Lamb's Book of Life
[2:00:04] says now the but these worshipers who
[2:00:07] came under the shadow could never be
[2:00:09] made perfect says les dwell on that word
[2:00:12] there never were offered year after year
[2:00:16] continually make the comers unto perfect
[2:00:19] says I won't you says haven't you heard
[2:00:22] many times that people say oh there's
[2:00:24] none perfect that's right you can't be
[2:00:29] perfect in the sight of your fellow man
[2:00:32] and I think that's not problem we're
[2:00:35] trying to reach perfection in the sight
[2:00:37] of a brother or another sister look let
[2:00:40] me tell you some I'll never be perfect
[2:00:43] in your sight and I want you to know
[2:00:45] something else you will never be perfect
[2:00:48] in my sight but it's not based on your
[2:00:53] site or my site this is based on God's
[2:00:57] sight all right he says haven't you
[2:00:59] heard many times that people say oh
[2:01:00] there's none perfect that's right you
[2:01:02] can't be perfect in the sight of your
[2:01:04] fellow man but you've got to be perfect
[2:01:07] or you'll never go to heaven the Bible
[2:01:10] said Jesus speaking in Beatitudes
[2:01:12] Matthew said be therefore perfect even
[2:01:14] as your father in heaven is perfect then
[2:01:17] you've got to be just as perfect as God
[2:01:19] is or you're lost now how you gonna do
[2:01:23] it see now one little mistake and you
[2:01:27] lost sense one little flap of the eye
[2:01:30] and you're gone because nothing can
[2:01:33] enter into those into those places but
[2:01:36] perfect it goes on God put Satan up
[2:01:40] there one time as an angel which he was
[2:01:43] the son of the morning and he took the
[2:01:46] good things of God and perverted them to
[2:01:48] evil into evil God sure that nothing
[2:01:52] will enter there that'll do that I'll
[2:01:55] ever do it again so you cannot take the
[2:01:58] good things of God and pervert them to
[2:02:01] evil can I go a little further if God
[2:02:04] has given you abilities God has blessed
[2:02:08] you with certain gifts and
[2:02:09] characteristics
[2:02:10] you cannot give those gifts and
[2:02:13] characteristics to the devil and convert
[2:02:16] or pervert them for evil what God of do
[2:02:21] is take his hands off of you a male a
[2:02:25] man a man your talent belongs to God
[2:02:28] your gift belongs to God you cannot
[2:02:32] pervert it and give it to the devil
[2:02:36] hallelujah says God that's what that's
[2:02:39] what Satan did at the beginning and
[2:02:40] that's why he would endure as he got
[2:02:42] kicked out of heaven and he'll never
[2:02:44] ever have a chance to go back look at
[2:02:47] this says God sure nothing will ever
[2:02:49] know nothing will enter
[2:02:51] there that I ever do it again see now
[2:02:53] you've got to be perfect
[2:02:55] Jesus said be therefore perfect even as
[2:02:57] your father in heaven is perfect
[2:02:58] now how you're going to be when you
[2:03:00] continually singing how you're gonna be
[2:03:03] perfect
[2:03:04] you just keep on sinning over and over
[2:03:07] and over again how you ever gonna get
[2:03:11] perfect but Jesus said be perfect right
[2:03:15] you continue to sin when you're
[2:03:17] continually doing what's wrong you can't
[2:03:20] right leave here and go do something
[2:03:21] wrong so now this would kind of put a a
[2:03:35] little kink in a legalist but notice it
[2:03:39] wasn't it wasn't you it isn't what you
[2:03:45] do it isn't what you do it's what God
[2:03:48] has done it's not what you do it's what
[2:03:53] he done see you can't be perfect you
[2:03:57] can't be in yourself but in Christ you
[2:04:03] are perfected I like that in Christ
[2:04:08] I am perfected since you're not trusting
[2:04:11] in your own good works all your own
[2:04:14] church you belong to but you you're
[2:04:18] trusting in the shed blood of the Lord
[2:04:20] Jesus there you are that's what makes
[2:04:23] you perfect
[2:04:24] that's what anchors your faith it's not
[2:04:28] what you do but it's what he's already
[2:04:30] done oh my goodness the Bible says in
[2:04:37] Hebrews 10:14 by for by one offering for
[2:04:41] about one offering he hath perfected
[2:04:44] forever them that are sanctified by one
[2:04:48] offering he hath perfected forever them
[2:04:52] that are sanctified thank God for what
[2:04:55] Calvary produce it produced the
[2:04:57] perfection inside of us you're already
[2:05:01] perfect
[2:05:02] because he's not looking at what you've
[2:05:04] done he's looking at what he did let me
[2:05:07] go a little further let me go a little
[2:05:10] further this this message law and oh
[2:05:16] Jesus
[2:05:18] yes I got a couple of these just just
[2:05:22] bear with me actually you know what
[2:05:26] Israel in the church let's go nope no
[2:05:28] I'm going back to LA I'm gonna read this
[2:05:30] since now the blood could not perfect
[2:05:33] could not be perfect by any animal but
[2:05:36] the blood in Christ was perfect now I
[2:05:39] will never be perfect and you will never
[2:05:41] be perfect and I will never be perfect
[2:05:44] in your sight you will never be perfect
[2:05:46] in my sight but let's lay it lay that
[2:05:49] aside what about in God's sight I look
[2:05:51] at you as a human I look at you as a
[2:05:53] brother but God looked at you through
[2:05:55] the blood of his son as a redeemed one
[2:05:57] see says Jesus said be ye therefore
[2:05:59] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[2:06:01] perfect and not what you've done you
[2:06:03] haven't you have nothing to merit it but
[2:06:05] it's what Christ did for you
[2:06:06] says oh do you see it for about if these
[2:06:10] offerings would have continued why we
[2:06:12] would have we would not have needed any
[2:06:14] more sacrifice but for the worst
[2:06:16] worshiper once purged let that sink way
[2:06:19] down deep
[2:06:21] since the worshiper once purged will
[2:06:24] have no more conscience or desire of sin
[2:06:28] right so if you truly been purged by the
[2:06:30] Holy Ghost you won't even have a desire
[2:06:32] for sin right it said it says if these
[2:06:35] really purge you know what purging
[2:06:37] anything is if it has been purged to
[2:06:40] believer once purge has nobody that
[2:06:43] moves no more desire sin it should been
[2:06:45] he says so therefore the blood of bulls
[2:06:48] the bulls and goats the burning
[2:06:51] sacrifice was the life went to meet the
[2:06:53] Creator as an animal creation says but
[2:06:56] the life that came from the blood cell
[2:06:58] of the Son of God was none other than
[2:07:00] God himself who had come down and was in
[2:07:03] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[2:07:05] the great Jehovah blood of God but
[2:07:08] there's no other male but God and
[2:07:11] in God's a spirit that I says the the
[2:07:15] the great yoga there was human not human
[2:07:17] life it was God's life the Bible said
[2:07:20] we're saved by the blood of God for
[2:07:21] there's no other male but God and God's
[2:07:23] Spirit it couldn't have been actually
[2:07:26] sexual it had to come supernatural
[2:07:29] that's why his church believes in the
[2:07:31] supernatural go on and a man that's ever
[2:07:34] confessed his sins standing laying his
[2:07:37] hands on the head of the dying lamb
[2:07:39] Christ and look to Calvary can never be
[2:07:42] the same no more that's right for by one
[2:07:45] sacrifice Hebrews 10:14 for by one
[2:07:48] sacrifice he had perfected forever those
[2:07:51] that are sanctified or cleanse by the
[2:07:54] blood of the Lamb i'ma stop there but
[2:07:57] you know I was just thinking on that you
[2:07:59] all know I read you the quote where
[2:08:01] brother branham talked about this it's a
[2:08:03] little mayor a man that might be born in
[2:08:06] a family and you know it's thinking to
[2:08:08] himself you know he's he's maybe
[2:08:10] disfigured and and just just all messed
[2:08:13] up and maybe brother Bram said if he
[2:08:15] could talk to his Monson mama when I go
[2:08:17] to church today I know they're gonna
[2:08:18] kill me because I ain't worth nothin I
[2:08:20] look like this and I look like that
[2:08:22] I ain't worth nothing I know they're
[2:08:24] gonna kill me as a sacrifice today and I
[2:08:26] must say no son you ain't got to worry
[2:08:29] about nothing I don't care what you look
[2:08:30] like you ain't got to worry about
[2:08:31] nothing because you were born as the
[2:08:33] firstborn there is a promise on you
[2:08:37] right and there's a there's a there's
[2:08:39] something else got to take your place
[2:08:41] because you firstborn
[2:08:42] oh my right so what happens that should
[2:08:46] say the priest won't even look at you
[2:08:48] the priest gonna look at this other
[2:08:50] sacrifice amen and I want to tell you
[2:08:52] tonight I mean this morning God is not
[2:08:54] looking at you
[2:08:55] but he's looking at the sacrifice of
[2:08:57] Calvary that was made for you a man walk
[2:09:01] underneath that perfection Oh hallelujah
[2:09:05] can I just read you something else
[2:09:07] Israel in the church look at what he
[2:09:09] said I'm gonna Street these statements I
[2:09:11] can't read the whole quote but you can
[2:09:12] go back and get it says God has already
[2:09:17] glorified his church
[2:09:20] now y'all with me God has already
[2:09:25] glorified his church that mean you ain't
[2:09:28] working towards this it's already
[2:09:30] happened through the blood that was shed
[2:09:32] at Calvary is cross God has already
[2:09:34] glorified oh my god is already glorified
[2:09:41] this church those who he justified he
[2:09:45] also glorified in the church in Christ
[2:09:48] if you're justified in Christ you're
[2:09:50] glorified in Christ already as far as
[2:09:53] God is concerned jesus said be ye
[2:09:56] therefore perfect even as your father in
[2:09:58] heaven is perfect how could you ever be
[2:09:59] perfect but in the sight of Christ
[2:10:01] tonight
[2:10:02] every born-again Christian is perfect oh
[2:10:06] I like that
[2:10:08] every born-again Christian is perfect
[2:10:10] I'm just that's perfect and God as
[2:10:13] Christ was and you know brother Brennan
[2:10:19] you know brother Brendan lied about the
[2:10:25] taxes and that he went in the house when
[2:10:27] the man called not the taxes but but in
[2:10:29] the house being in the house he told the
[2:10:31] truth out the taxes but but he lied when
[2:10:33] the man called say you know can I speak
[2:10:35] to brother and said tell him I'm not
[2:10:36] here but this same man is saying that
[2:10:39] I'm just as perfect as God was that
[2:10:44] perfect in God as Christ was not think
[2:10:46] about that now not that he lied and just
[2:10:48] never repented he lied and he repented
[2:10:53] right a man we got some repentance or
[2:10:56] two but I understand that the devil
[2:10:58] can't hold that over your head once it's
[2:11:01] under the blood search it is under the
[2:11:04] blood hallelujah once you confessed it
[2:11:08] don't allow the devil to bring it back
[2:11:10] up again and you walk in your perfection
[2:11:13] I'm not looking at me Satan I'm looking
[2:11:16] at him and not only that God not looking
[2:11:19] at me God's looking at him let me let me
[2:11:22] go forward here this is let me switch
[2:11:24] gears for you in a second says I'm just
[2:11:28] as perfect in God as Christ was
[2:11:31] you are to every other believer for it's
[2:11:34] not my holiness it's his holiness God
[2:11:38] can't accept mine I have none but I come
[2:11:40] in Christ by faith and by Christ I'm by
[2:11:44] Christ I'm in him and perfect in the
[2:11:47] sight of God see so when you know we
[2:11:49] can't use the term that I'll never be
[2:11:52] perfect right
[2:11:54] you'll never be perfect you're only
[2:11:55] talking about in each other sight but
[2:11:57] underneath God's sight we're standing
[2:12:00] perfect already glorified justified just
[2:12:03] as if we've never done it in the first
[2:12:04] place we ought to think off a blood like
[2:12:07] that blood that can cleanse us like that
[2:12:10] how we how we certainly appreciate the
[2:12:11] Lord Jesus Oh God so brother branham
[2:12:18] took us to Matthew 5 and it told us to
[2:12:25] be perfect as Christ was perfect that's
[2:12:29] that's what as his father was perfect
[2:12:31] that's what Matthew 5 told us and and as
[2:12:34] I was just kind of meditating on that
[2:12:35] because this is what godliness is all
[2:12:37] about
[2:12:38] Amen this is what godliness is all about
[2:12:40] it's bringing us to look exactly like
[2:12:43] our Father in heaven be you therefore
[2:12:45] perfect even as your father which is in
[2:12:47] heaven is perfect this is what brother
[2:12:50] Branham felt led by the Holy Spirit to
[2:12:52] go to the scripture and so as I was just
[2:12:57] meditating on this and we're dealing
[2:12:59] with this war strategies I just began to
[2:13:02] just kind of think about Lord now who
[2:13:04] what strategy could we go to inscription
[2:13:07] amen where this might have been applied
[2:13:10] praise the Lord
[2:13:12] and as I was just praying and seeking
[2:13:14] the Lord God took me to a particular
[2:13:17] scripture there was a war happening I'll
[2:13:22] give it to you you already know the
[2:13:24] story it's in 2nd Kings chapter 6
[2:13:27] starting at verse 8 and I'm only gonna
[2:13:30] read a little bit of this and I'll give
[2:13:32] you the a man just the highlights a man
[2:13:36] 2nd Kings chapter 6
[2:13:39] I'm sorry starting at verse 5 let's go
[2:13:41] to verse 5 is that right
[2:13:44] Oh hold on ma I'm in the wrong verse
[2:13:52] verse 8 2nd Kings chapter 6 verse 8 says
[2:13:56] since then the king of Syria war against
[2:14:00] Israel so we know that this is a war
[2:14:02] that's happening war against Israel and
[2:14:05] took counsel with the service saying and
[2:14:07] such in such a place shall be my count
[2:14:11] hallelujah that the king of Syria wants
[2:14:15] to battle with Israel and now verse 9
[2:14:18] says and a man of God sent him to the
[2:14:20] king of Israel saying beware that thou
[2:14:23] passed not such a place for the other
[2:14:26] the Syrians are come down hallelujah God
[2:14:30] had a prophet in the land that could
[2:14:32] actually tell the King exactly what was
[2:14:34] getting ready to happen so every time
[2:14:36] the king of Syria went were playing a
[2:14:39] strategy in his battle hallelujah God
[2:14:42] will over overcome that strategy by
[2:14:44] revealing to the Prophet what was going
[2:14:46] on the Prophet was shared with the king
[2:14:48] and the king of Israel with a man
[2:14:50] constantly avoid trouble because he was
[2:14:52] listening to a prophet I want to tell
[2:14:55] you something you will also constantly
[2:14:57] avoid trouble if you'll just listen to a
[2:15:00] prophet hallelujah somebody Amen but but
[2:15:05] here we see them you know just trying to
[2:15:08] find what is going on why why every time
[2:15:11] we go and I'm just kind of summarize
[2:15:13] this every time we come up with a
[2:15:15] strategy God just kind of Amen I mean if
[2:15:19] this King is not where we expected him
[2:15:20] to be right so so so the king of Assyria
[2:15:23] a man I'm in the king of Syria he got a
[2:15:26] little discouraged he got a little upset
[2:15:28] about this sin and later on the
[2:15:30] scripture we found where he gathers his
[2:15:33] his leaders together and he says who
[2:15:35] among us is a spy who among this group
[2:15:38] is a spy you know why is it that every
[2:15:41] time we go down here we can never find
[2:15:43] this king and then an attempt send our
[2:15:45] king I want to tell you say there is no
[2:15:47] spy so put up your sword don't kill
[2:15:49] anybody you
[2:15:50] put this water because there is a spa
[2:15:52] but what I will tell you is that they
[2:15:54] got a profit in the land he said that
[2:15:56] profit is revealing the very things that
[2:15:59] are happening your bedchamber hallelujah
[2:16:02] he say say say that prophet of death so
[2:16:04] the king says now where is this profit
[2:16:07] let's let's go to his house and and we
[2:16:09] take care of the profit that I guarantee
[2:16:11] we'll be able to defeat Israel it gets
[2:16:15] his coordinates together I can see him
[2:16:17] put them in his GPS and he marches his
[2:16:21] army down a man to the prophets house Oh
[2:16:24] hallelujah glory to God church and as
[2:16:27] they get down there amen to the prophets
[2:16:30] house it's the Prophet is there and
[2:16:32] brother branham say that Elijah was just
[2:16:35] so cool I like that statement right
[2:16:38] because you got to learn how to just
[2:16:40] keep your cool when you're under
[2:16:42] stressful situations and then you got to
[2:16:45] learn how to keep your cool with the
[2:16:46] devil store and everything gets you
[2:16:49] you gotta learn how to keep your cool
[2:16:51] huh don't don't don't don't lose it
[2:16:54] don't lose your top when the devil's
[2:16:56] throat listen throwing that keep your
[2:16:58] cool he say say loud you're just just
[2:17:03] just just just cool and he said so so so
[2:17:06] jahaziel servantis is there and Gahan
[2:17:10] Xia's is it's waking up in the morning
[2:17:12] looked at me see that all these chariots
[2:17:16] and horses and and warriors all around
[2:17:19] the house and brother branham say they
[2:17:21] slipped in at night they slipped in at
[2:17:26] night now I like this right because when
[2:17:31] the enemy is slipping in at night that's
[2:17:35] what he doing at y'all when you sleeping
[2:17:37] he's slipping in why are you sleeping he
[2:17:39] planning soon as you wake up he got
[2:17:41] something to throw at you he's slipping
[2:17:43] you wake up in the morning why where did
[2:17:45] this
[2:17:46] from right he's slippin in at night but
[2:17:49] I want to taste something when the devil
[2:17:51] is slipping in at night God is already
[2:17:54] prepared for God is already ready for
[2:17:58] him Oh hallelujah
[2:18:00] when he trying to slip in and and make
[2:18:02] me surprise you God was surprised the
[2:18:05] devil see God already knew what he was
[2:18:08] about to do and not only did God already
[2:18:11] know what he's about to do but but the
[2:18:13] reason it be life that could be so calm
[2:18:15] it's because he knew God had a plan I
[2:18:17] want to tell you something oh my god
[2:18:20] when Jesus went to the grave of Lazarus
[2:18:23] God already knew what he was about to do
[2:18:27] hallelujah he went going down there just
[2:18:30] to play games but God knew that he would
[2:18:32] raised Lazarus from the crane when Jesus
[2:18:35] was in the midst of 5,000 that did not
[2:18:38] have any food God already knew what he
[2:18:42] was about to do when he got amongst
[2:18:44] 4,000 that didn't have any food God
[2:18:47] already knew what he was about to do I
[2:18:49] don't know what you're facing this
[2:18:51] morning but I can't tell you this God
[2:18:55] already knows what he's about to do
[2:19:00] praise God God already knows how he's
[2:19:04] gonna change it God already knows how
[2:19:06] he's gonna fix it
[2:19:08] God already knows what he's about to do
[2:19:11] nothing catches God by surprise here the
[2:19:19] Prophet is there and just you know just
[2:19:21] relaxing drinking his coffee eating his
[2:19:25] toast not even worried about this great
[2:19:27] army that surrounded his house let's
[2:19:31] listen I want to just kind of pick this
[2:19:33] up in Scripture we're gonna skip forward
[2:19:35] a little bit amen verse 15 oh my for 14
[2:19:40] verse 14 look at this Oh hallelujah
[2:19:43] hallelujah hallelujah since I therefore
[2:19:47] sinned he did the horses and chariots
[2:19:49] and a great hosting that came by night
[2:19:52] and compassed the city about and when
[2:19:56] the servant of the man of God was risen
[2:19:59] early and go
[2:20:00] behold a host compassed the city both
[2:20:02] with horses and chariots and a servant
[2:20:05] said unto him at last my master how
[2:20:08] shall we do so he's a little a little
[2:20:11] frustrated like what are we gonna do
[2:20:12] about this Elijah how we gonna get
[2:20:14] ourselves out of this they got to
[2:20:16] surround it they got to encompass how're
[2:20:19] we gonna get out of this right and he
[2:20:21] says verse 16 says an answer and any
[2:20:25] answer fear not
[2:20:27] can I tell you all the same thing you
[2:20:30] might feel surrounded this morning but
[2:20:33] fear not powers of Beals all around you
[2:20:37] fear not they threatened to take your
[2:20:40] house fear not
[2:20:42] why because you paid your ties and
[2:20:45] there's a promise that he will rebuke
[2:20:47] the Devourer for your sake so just
[2:20:50] confess the word of God over your
[2:20:52] situation and fear not hallelujah fear
[2:20:56] not for they that be with us not a
[2:20:59] prophet could say this because he was
[2:21:01] seeing something that the young man was
[2:21:04] not seeing hallelujah glory to God he
[2:21:08] says he says fear not for they that be
[2:21:10] with us I'm more than thing that be with
[2:21:14] them great is He that's in you than he
[2:21:16] that's in the world
[2:21:17] hallelujah church right so so so so now
[2:21:20] now we need winning winning when he said
[2:21:22] that Eli's just speaking of sahaja God's
[2:21:25] like how could he speak words like this
[2:21:27] then then Eli sure had to pray a prayer
[2:21:30] hallelujah amen and this prayer brought
[2:21:34] forth the manifestation and immediate
[2:21:36] manifestation in Kahala situation where
[2:21:40] he can see something that he wasn't
[2:21:42] seeing before and the reason I say that
[2:21:45] God already knows what he's about to do
[2:21:47] those angels were there Wow the enemy's
[2:21:52] army was there even the enemy didn't see
[2:21:55] the angels of God there Oh even the
[2:22:00] enemy doesn't realize what God has so
[2:22:03] here you try to surprise attack me
[2:22:08] here you trying to come against me but
[2:22:12] God I got my back
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:15] God got my sides God is covering the
[2:22:19] front God is covering all around me my
[2:22:24] enemy could not even see the Angels down
[2:22:31] you can if you could ever just get a
[2:22:33] glimpse in that realm look at this now
[2:22:37] look at what he say see ya Elijah once
[2:22:41] gajala they have the same piece but it's
[2:22:42] kind of hard for him when he's just
[2:22:44] looking around and see I'm surrounded
[2:22:45] I'm surrounded I'm surrounded but look
[2:22:47] at this he says he likes you prayed said
[2:22:52] Lord I pray the open his eyes that he
[2:22:56] may see and the Lord opened the eyes of
[2:23:01] the young man and he saw now what was he
[2:23:03] looking at now he didn't see the armies
[2:23:08] the enemy's army he couldn't see that
[2:23:11] y'all stay with me he couldn't see that
[2:23:15] he just couldn't see God's army see this
[2:23:19] is why I told y'all last week some
[2:23:20] started for the angel of the Lord and
[2:23:23] campus round about them that fear him
[2:23:27] and does what delivered them from all
[2:23:29] their troubles hallelujah now he could
[2:23:32] see Amen the natural army but he
[2:23:35] couldn't see the spiritual army you know
[2:23:40] brother branham makes some comments here
[2:23:41] you know it's and we don't we gonna read
[2:23:43] this a little bit more in Scripture and
[2:23:45] say some people say he say spiritual
[2:23:49] blindness is worse than natural
[2:23:52] blindness spiritual blindness he says so
[2:23:56] what happened this man was spiritually
[2:23:58] blind to what God was doing and say now
[2:24:01] when we read about this army they also
[2:24:04] had natural eyesight but they're
[2:24:06] spiritually blind to who the Prophet was
[2:24:09] now you know you can have the same thing
[2:24:11] today people can have the same Bible and
[2:24:14] be reading out the same Scripture you
[2:24:15] read now but be spiritually blind to who
[2:24:18] God sent them
[2:24:23] look at this verse 17 he launched the
[2:24:29] praetor said lord I pray thee open his
[2:24:31] eyes that he may see in the Lord open
[2:24:34] eyes at a young man and he saw and
[2:24:36] behold the mountain was full of horses
[2:24:37] and chariots
[2:24:38] a fire round about Elisha now you know
[2:24:45] he likes you types you but put yourself
[2:24:49] in the scripture you got mountains I
[2:24:52] mean you got you got you you got
[2:24:53] mountains that you faced and where their
[2:24:55] horses and chariots of fire all around
[2:24:59] you for your protection look at this and
[2:25:01] when they came down to him Elisha prayed
[2:25:04] unto the Lord and said smite this people
[2:25:08] but can you match they smite this people
[2:25:11] glory to God I pray thee with blindness
[2:25:16] and he smote them with blindness
[2:25:18] according to the word of Elisha oh I
[2:25:21] think so much that I can see how I'm
[2:25:22] just I'm running out of time he smote it
[2:25:25] according to Elijah's word so would it
[2:25:29] be like you say he acts for blindness
[2:25:34] that's what he got what did you ask for
[2:25:36] what that's what you gonna get
[2:25:43] don't change it you know how to profit
[2:25:47] dip when them three squirrels was coming
[2:25:48] he almost changed it lord I thank you
[2:25:50] for - no no no no no God had a telling
[2:25:53] you the next 102 you acts for three and
[2:25:56] I don't care how long you got to wait
[2:25:58] you wait for the third one verse 19 and
[2:26:07] Elijah said unto them this is not the
[2:26:10] way neither is this the city the GPS
[2:26:14] coordinates let them to Elijah's house
[2:26:18] they knew this was supposed to be the
[2:26:20] place but yet they're blind to see the
[2:26:24] Prophet now they can see but they can't
[2:26:27] see him they can see to think they said
[2:26:31] enough to follow wherever he's leading
[2:26:33] them right and then I know they're not
[2:26:36] on getting lead I'm sure let's see where
[2:26:38] he led them let's just read this let's
[2:26:39] read this let's see what let's let's see
[2:26:41] where he lied she took him they follow
[2:26:44] in a very man that they went looking for
[2:26:46] the kill but God blinded them to him I
[2:26:53] want to tell you that some people blind
[2:26:55] it to see the world in this day Oh glory
[2:27:01] to God let's read this verse verse 19
[2:27:04] says and Elijah said in them this is not
[2:27:07] the way neither is this the city follow
[2:27:10] me and I will bring you to the man whom
[2:27:13] he seek but he led them to Samaria and
[2:27:17] it came to pass when they were come now
[2:27:20] you got to get this in your mind
[2:27:22] Elijah walking a man right towards
[2:27:25] Samaria not eat some areas this is where
[2:27:27] the Israelite King was living with a I
[2:27:30] mean they were these are the people that
[2:27:31] are that that God was that the King in
[2:27:34] Israel was being protected from the
[2:27:36] Syrians but here they are marching
[2:27:37] probably one by
[2:27:39] behind the profit right down into
[2:27:41] Samaria
[2:27:43] and then they come in like they came
[2:27:47] this is so much that they miss they
[2:27:49] missed that this was the profit they
[2:27:52] missed that they were actually in the
[2:27:54] enemy's camp there's many things that
[2:27:57] they missed
[2:28:01] God know how to do things but look at
[2:28:04] this look at this lets you know first 20
[2:28:06] cents and it came to pass when they were
[2:28:08] coming to Samaria that Elisha said Lord
[2:28:11] open the eyes of these men oh my god
[2:28:15] that they may see and the Lord opened
[2:28:19] their eyes and they saw and behold they
[2:28:21] were in the midst of Samaria now I don't
[2:28:24] even know these men are probably afraid
[2:28:26] now how did this stop him the very I
[2:28:28] mean we come to kill the man to stop
[2:28:30] this man from from from from from defeat
[2:28:32] in the army but now we end up right in
[2:28:34] the midst of the Israel army with no
[2:28:37] plan of attack
[2:28:38] how did this happen I mentioned the
[2:28:48] first scriptures that you know the Bible
[2:28:53] tells us you know we've heard it said to
[2:28:55] hate those that that hated us
[2:28:58] but Jesus said I'm telling you to love
[2:29:01] them that hate you you know if you want
[2:29:06] to just love those that love you what
[2:29:08] what think have you what you doing
[2:29:11] different from what everybody else - he
[2:29:12] said no no I want you to love your
[2:29:14] enemies and then he goes on to say 10
[2:29:18] she say he say now be perfect as my
[2:29:21] father in heaven is perfect he uses all
[2:29:24] of that material to tell us be perfect
[2:29:26] this is what God is looking for from us
[2:29:28] so when your enemy is in your myths and
[2:29:35] God has brought them to you
[2:29:43] what is your response is it godliness or
[2:29:48] hatred remember from yesterday hatred
[2:29:52] has an in but love is eternal so in your
[2:30:03] spirit if hatred is rise enough then
[2:30:07] there's something wrong
[2:30:08] Oh God you set my enemy to not for you
[2:30:12] to get revenge I said show anything now
[2:30:18] Amen to see what you're gonna do with
[2:30:20] your enemy because when Jesus has his
[2:30:22] enemies surrounding him at the cross he
[2:30:25] said Father forgive them they know not
[2:30:28] what they do
[2:30:30] oh come on church see you know it's easy
[2:30:34] to shout when we think we we got the
[2:30:36] enemy defeated but it's another since
[2:30:39] one thing with you know the Bible say
[2:30:42] you know he will you prepare a table for
[2:30:44] me in the presence of my enemies but I
[2:30:47] got a question for you today can you
[2:30:50] prepare a table for your enemies
[2:30:56] [Applause]
[2:30:59] [Music]
[2:31:04] this is what godliness is all about I
[2:31:07] was wondering what scripture connects to
[2:31:09] this here it is which watch what
[2:31:11] happened in this verse first win again a
[2:31:17] came to pass when they were coming to
[2:31:18] Samaria that Elisha said Lord open the
[2:31:23] eyes of these men that they may see in
[2:31:25] the Lord open their eyes they saw him
[2:31:27] behold there were in the midst of
[2:31:29] Samaria and the king of Israel city of
[2:31:32] kunti Elijah when he saw them my father
[2:31:37] shall i smite them he was so excited
[2:31:41] maybe pulled out its wart father
[2:31:45] Elijah shall I slay them shouts murder
[2:31:55] Elisha types you so what I'm saying this
[2:32:00] should be your response with your
[2:32:05] enemies I ain't say with the people you
[2:32:08] love and can I also say this ain't no
[2:32:17] brother a sister your enemy
[2:32:23] there your brother there your sister if
[2:32:27] they've been washed in the same blood
[2:32:29] you've been washed in they are not your
[2:32:31] enemies so don't sit in in your mind
[2:32:35] yeah that's my don't know that devil
[2:32:37] lying to you that's not your enemy
[2:32:39] that's your brother and you need to
[2:32:41] sometimes speak back to the devil no
[2:32:43] that's my brother that's my sister king
[2:32:50] of israel said unto elijah when he saw
[2:32:52] them my father shall i smite them sure
[2:32:54] let's make them and he answered thou
[2:32:56] shall not smite then put your sword up
[2:33:01] what is now smite those whom thou has
[2:33:05] taken captive with our sword
[2:33:08] and with that Bo look at what he's
[2:33:10] saying
[2:33:11] set bread go cook a meal for your enemy
[2:33:22] that's it but be perfect as my father in
[2:33:31] heaven is perfect
[2:33:36] set bread and water to refresh them make
[2:33:41] sure they get a good meal let them lick
[2:33:42] their fingers set bread and water before
[2:33:48] them that they may eat and drink then
[2:33:54] after they finish where they going to
[2:33:56] their man well now when they go to
[2:33:58] master what you think these folks gon
[2:34:00] say what you think they gonna say by the
[2:34:09] time they get back to the master and
[2:34:10] start sharing this great testimony I can
[2:34:12] almost assure you they wouldn't want to
[2:34:15] come and fight no more
[2:34:17] actually your enemy just became your
[2:34:24] enemy just became your friend you want
[2:34:25] Ohio Amy became your friend by your
[2:34:28] actions verse 23 says and he prepared
[2:34:40] y'all know I'm I'm gonna skip over that
[2:34:43] part he prepared for vision I mean he
[2:34:49] emptied his covers I'm again I'm gonna
[2:34:54] give him motive what you asked for
[2:34:56] hmm he prepared great provision for them
[2:35:02] and when they had eaten and drunk he
[2:35:06] sent them away and they went to their
[2:35:08] master so the hands of Syria came I mean
[2:35:13] so the bands of Syria came no more
[2:35:19] into the land of Israel see if you gonna
[2:35:25] love them that love you you really ain't
[2:35:29] done nothing but if you can love your
[2:35:35] enemies now we talked about godliness
[2:35:40] remember one time I'm closing I'm
[2:35:42] getting ready to leave here I remember
[2:35:43] one time brother branham was in the car
[2:35:45] thing goes with brother Perry greening
[2:35:46] and he was talking about it's just
[2:35:49] sharing and so let me clarify this it's
[2:35:53] one thing to gossip it's another thing
[2:35:56] to share gossip you're actually trying
[2:35:59] to test somebody's character down but
[2:36:02] sometimes you just got to share truth
[2:36:03] this is what happened I'm not I'm not
[2:36:07] trying to say that stories you can stop
[2:36:09] fellowship with them because you know
[2:36:10] you know people do that right you know
[2:36:13] people do that you know if something
[2:36:15] something happens you know that what I'm
[2:36:17] telling this because I don't want you to
[2:36:19] hang with them to either a man Church
[2:36:23] that's why I'm telling you this that's
[2:36:24] gossip that's gossip you know you're
[2:36:27] trying to in official but you are you
[2:36:28] know I'm telling you this I'm just
[2:36:29] telling you truth but I'm I don't want
[2:36:31] to see your relationship change they
[2:36:34] didn't do that to you so you don't have
[2:36:36] no property you shouldn't have no
[2:36:37] problem with them amen
[2:36:39] so did this um this brother brother
[2:36:45] Green was whit brother brother branham
[2:36:47] and brother Browns tell me this happened
[2:36:48] that happened this brother didn't me
[2:36:49] this way and therefore it's just man it
[2:36:51] was really really something brother and
[2:36:53] brother green was getting real upset see
[2:36:57] next time I see them brothers I'm gonna
[2:36:59] give them some fivefold ministry he was
[2:37:04] just ready to you know the attack so
[2:37:07] they driving down the street and brother
[2:37:10] Brett brother Brandon tell brother Green
[2:37:12] that he was actually on the street where
[2:37:14] the brothers leader driving down the
[2:37:17] street where the RAM say oh this brother
[2:37:19] saw some house let's go in and greet him
[2:37:20] the parents say what go in and greet him
[2:37:24] know the way he did you say brother
[2:37:27] Perry I didn't tell you that so you can
[2:37:29] act the way that you acted I was just
[2:37:32] sharing true
[2:37:33] with you say but they still are brothers
[2:37:35] let's go in here and greet them you
[2:37:38] learn how to love your enemies you know
[2:37:40] they said they had a statement about
[2:37:41] God's prophet they say you could not
[2:37:44] tell his enemies from his friends and if
[2:37:49] a prophet of God could come to that spot
[2:37:51] what about the people of God
[2:37:53] this is godliness and it's not just a
[2:37:57] sermon to go in one ear and out the
[2:37:59] other but it's what God is calling us to
[2:38:02] this is a war strategy so if you had
[2:38:06] some enemies want to cook a meal I'm
[2:38:09] tough I give them your best smorgasbord
[2:38:13] buffet set it in a presence and then
