[51:34] amen
[51:35] that is why Jesus preached ye must be

[52:38] Whom Shall We Fear To Whom Shall We Be
[52:40] Afraid
[52:42] To Whom Shall We Be Afraid what
[52:43] condition economic conditions money
[52:47] family nothing we are not afraid of
[52:50] nothing because Christ is in US amen and
[52:54] nothing can happen to you unless Christ
[52:56] permitted and if he permit it he'll

[55:15] our lord is good
[55:18] we want to welcome sister Tatiana and
[55:21] the family
[55:27] brother Israel sister Victoria and
[55:30] brother Samuel I invited him that I was
[55:32] praying last night and they came upon I
[55:35] had to invite him because I'm going to
[55:36] speak something for the Youth and I
[55:39] invited my sister and he said yes we're
[55:40] gonna be there
[55:41] and they were here eight o'clock way
[55:44] before the time so God blesses that
[55:46] Titanic family and every every invited
[55:50] guest we welcome you the Lord bless you
[55:53] and be comfortable amen we are just a
[55:55] family of Christ and we pray the Lord is
[55:58] using Brother Jack in Atlanta to bless
[56:01] the name of the Lord amen so if you can
[56:04] have my slide
[56:06] and let's go to the slide
[56:10] we want to speak on something that I
[56:12] spoke on I think December December the
[56:14] 4th the first part was believe
[56:19] into your heart this the supernatural
[56:21] that was fourth December 20 20 22 and
[56:25] want to take a second part of the same
[56:28] anointing and going the same direction
[56:30] receive in your heart the Supernatural
[56:33] and we just added something little that
[56:35] you understand little sweet 16. or I am
[56:39] sweet 16 amen and you understand that in
[56:42] the course of time you know me already
[56:44] those who are here that brother Goku is
[56:46] a weird guy he's got a weird name he
[56:49] speaks weird things but he's going to
[56:51] bless your heart amen so the Lord bless
[56:54] you amen Glory Hallelujah and we want to
[56:57] dedicate this sermon to the young people
[56:58] they are the chosen generation of the
[57:01] Living God
[57:02] God always bring people on Earth men and
[57:06] women not only men prophet prophetess
[57:09] a prophet is anyone who has got Christ
[57:11] in him Prophet is a Seer is a mouthpiece
[57:15] of God of course we have got major
[57:16] prophet that are sent to generation but
[57:19] God has got minor prophet people that is
[57:21] put his life in them to be a prophet to
[57:24] your family amen
[57:26] we know women cannot be in the fight for
[57:28] Ministry but as a place for women in
[57:31] your home the woman is rude the pastor
[57:33] unto the children because when you
[57:35] attend the man is working the husband is
[57:37] working but the woman is the pastor to
[57:39] the children to teach them the word of
[57:41] the Lord and we know John Wesley his
[57:44] mother was a pastor to 17 or 19 children
[57:47] just like it's cool or a class of itself
[57:51] and if he imparted the word of the Lord
[57:53] to them and the Lord used mightily John
[57:55] Wesley for the word and just Loosely to
[57:58] be a songwriter amen and we want to
[58:01] encourage the young people that God
[58:02] before the foundation of the world plays
[58:05] gifts and talent in you to use you amen
[58:08] and all you need to do is Avail yourself
[58:11] make yourself available and let the Lord
[58:14] take control for your life
[58:16] by the Holy Ghost baptism that is the
[58:19] only way you can manifest your purpose
[58:21] on this Earth amen so we want to talk
[58:24] about my trip to Colombia
[58:28] but Jack asked me to talk about it and
[58:30] it was already my notes to give updates
[58:32] on the trip to Colombia December last
[58:36] year Christmas so let's go to let's read
[58:38] the first scriptures in fact let's go
[58:39] back and read probably the only
[58:41] scripture that we read we read more
[58:43] scriptures but let's stand and read the
[58:45] scripture
[58:49] if you could Ecclesiastes chapter 12
[58:51] verse 1 just the first verse we're gonna
[58:53] read a rest in the course of time but
[58:54] let's read the first verse
[58:57] which is very powerful scripture
[59:00] thou touch every not even a younger but
[59:04] an adult
[59:05] to know that you are here on a mission
[59:08] you are not going to stay here forever
[59:09] your life here began and your life will
[59:12] end between your birth and the death
[59:15] there's a purpose for your life and you
[59:17] got to do whatever you can to find our
[59:19] purpose
[59:20] and leave that purpose before your life
[59:23] terminates or expires on this Earth amen
[59:26] so let's read Ecclesiastes chapter 12
[59:28] verse 1. remember now that I'm Creator
[59:32] in the this of that youth while the evil
[59:34] days cometh come north nor they the
[59:38] years drawn when thou shall see I have
[59:40] no pleasure in them the Lord add
[59:42] blessing to the reader of his word shall
[59:44] we take our seed amen we continue to
[59:46] read the rest of the same scripture in
[59:48] the course of time
[59:49] but let's go and give a little testimony
[59:52] which is going to tie into what I'm
[59:54] going to preach from Colombia on
[59:57] December 2022
[59:59] I went to
[1:00:00] I think the Christmas I took a little
[1:00:02] trip it wasn't a one of those trips to
[1:00:05] go and preach that was in my my purpose
[1:00:06] to go and preach but part of the reason
[1:00:08] was just going res just change your
[1:00:10] environment as human being sometimes
[1:00:12] when you do the same thing
[1:00:14] so you need to change your environment
[1:00:15] so I just I was doing my clinicals I
[1:00:18] think I was in Palm Beach Gardens and I
[1:00:21] think before after I decided to take a
[1:00:22] trip to Colombia just to rest
[1:00:24] and then come back by the Lord has his
[1:00:27] agenda in your agenda sometimes things
[1:00:29] happen
[1:00:30] that you didn't plan for it you don't
[1:00:32] have a clue about it but the Lord
[1:00:33] manifests those things in his time
[1:00:36] so I want to read another scripture here
[1:00:40] which is about kind of a missionary
[1:00:42] scripture with the scripture for every
[1:00:44] one of us amen because the Bible said go
[1:00:46] into the world and preach the gospel
[1:00:47] preaching is only by verbal preaching by
[1:00:50] your life
[1:00:51] the best sermon is living a life of
[1:00:54] Jesus Christ
[1:00:55] if you don't say a word people can see
[1:00:57] Christ in you and they'll be thirsty and
[1:00:59] hungry for their cries in you amen so
[1:01:02] Mark 16 15-17 he said unto them go into
[1:01:05] the world preach the gospel to Every
[1:01:07] Creature he that believeth and is
[1:01:09] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:01:11] believeth not shall be damned and this
[1:01:14] shall this signs shall follow them that
[1:01:16] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:01:18] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:01:20] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:01:23] drink any deadly sin it shall not hate
[1:01:26] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:01:28] and they shall recover amen this
[1:01:30] scripture is not only for preachers it's
[1:01:32] for everyone in the body of Christ
[1:01:34] and we're gonna find out men and women
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:37] so let's go to the next slide
[1:01:39] and then this was
[1:01:42] um December around I think 2026
[1:01:44] somewhere but again bro I think someone
[1:01:46] filming the mission from Colombia he
[1:01:48] comes here sometime and his wife so we
[1:01:52] went to that trip was proud the place
[1:01:54] was called Santa Marta which means Saint
[1:01:56] Martha that was a big coastal city in
[1:01:58] Colombia it's a tourist City but
[1:02:01] unfortunately there's no message church
[1:02:02] over there but a few couple of Believers
[1:02:05] handful of Believers in that city so we
[1:02:06] went and then sometimes we go to the
[1:02:09] beach and just relax and share the word
[1:02:11] of the Lord to whomsoever so brother
[1:02:13] Gabriel went to visit his auntie that he
[1:02:16] hasn't met in about 20 years after his
[1:02:18] mom died so he went with his wife and I
[1:02:21] told them I was going to wait at the
[1:02:22] hotel
[1:02:23] so he came back and said my auntie who
[1:02:25] is 81 or around 80 years old want to be
[1:02:28] baptized in the name of the Lord the
[1:02:30] first question he asked me was Gabriel I
[1:02:32] want you to baptize me
[1:02:34] and the husband so he shared word of the
[1:02:36] Lord with them and so we had a chance to
[1:02:38] baptize his auntie then thrip people
[1:02:41] also got baptize let's go to the next
[1:02:43] slide
[1:02:45] um we had one
[1:02:48] where do I start but Gabriel on the
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:50] and then the aunties the one they were
[1:02:53] holding and then little girl is an
[1:02:55] Ulysses and I'll share testimony about
[1:02:57] this little girl and then her grand mom
[1:03:00] is sister Gloria behind with the hand
[1:03:02] wrist but Gabriel's wife is uh next
[1:03:05] behind and then sister ohemia and then
[1:03:08] the husband he's an Italian guy and then
[1:03:11] of course I don't have to tell you who's
[1:03:13] the next person is
[1:03:16] right so we baptize four people public
[1:03:18] Gabriel did a baptism I prayed and
[1:03:20] preached a little sermon to them about
[1:03:22] baptism baptism is actually from the
[1:03:25] Greek word baptism which means to be
[1:03:28] dead to be buried and also types
[1:03:31] marriage you have to die to the old
[1:03:33] husband the old soul the old nature the
[1:03:37] old control tower that you were born
[1:03:39] with through sex that being has to die
[1:03:42] and another being that they were
[1:03:45] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:03:46] world the lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:03:48] takes over this flesh and then you are
[1:03:50] no longer the same person that you used
[1:03:52] to be
[1:03:53] you get a change of husband
[1:03:56] change of name change of spirit change
[1:03:59] of Flesh change of Soul everything
[1:04:02] changed because you become a new
[1:04:04] creature amen
[1:04:06] and that's the most important thing in
[1:04:08] the life of every human being the most
[1:04:10] important thing is not your money it's
[1:04:13] not your bank account it's not your
[1:04:15] family your family can die and leave you
[1:04:16] your wife can despise you your husband
[1:04:19] can despise you your children can leave
[1:04:20] you your parents can leave you but
[1:04:22] there's only one person
[1:04:24] who will not leave you even if you leave
[1:04:26] yourself he will still be with you amen
[1:04:29] when you come to the with end and you
[1:04:31] can't continue he will raise you up and
[1:04:33] push you forward and he's the Lord Jesus
[1:04:35] Christ so we baptize but Gabriel
[1:04:38] baptized his auntie I think she's also
[1:04:40] Tatiana sister Gloria and her grandbaby
[1:04:42] analysis and her sister
[1:04:45] or hernia so it happened this way that
[1:04:49] the Italian guy invited invited us to
[1:04:51] Pizza I think on the 24th night
[1:04:53] and at the pizza side he was asking me
[1:04:55] questions he's living in Italian he know
[1:04:56] everything about the Roman Catholic
[1:04:57] change so he said so what is the
[1:04:59] difference between you Christians and
[1:05:01] the Catholic
[1:05:02] is it because Christians Deep in water
[1:05:04] by Imagine and Catholic sprinkle is that
[1:05:08] the difference so we talk a little bit
[1:05:10] about baptism and then when we came back
[1:05:12] to the house October Gabriel that you
[1:05:14] need to speak to this man there's
[1:05:15] something bubbling in his heart so we
[1:05:17] had a meeting and with all the family
[1:05:19] we're talking
[1:05:20] and in the course of the talking the
[1:05:21] Holy Ghost hit the little girl analysis
[1:05:24] she started crying and confessing
[1:05:27] practice that asked her was she a
[1:05:28] Christian she said well she used to go
[1:05:30] to church during the before the pandemic
[1:05:33] but then during the pandemic they
[1:05:35] stopped going to church and he's never
[1:05:36] been in church
[1:05:37] so the Holy Ghost hit and started

[1:07:43] spirit
[1:07:44] now let me talk a little bit about rank

[1:07:49] for just putting on their fingers if you
[1:07:52] ring everything necklace
[1:07:55] rings and whatever they have meaning
[1:07:58] amen
[1:07:59] when somebody get married they put a
[1:08:01] ring on their fingers to show that the
[1:08:02] man is my the woman is married people

[1:08:40] matured when you are not matured mature

[1:08:46] and if you do that you're exposing
[1:08:47] yourself to men and men who take
[1:08:49] advantage of you because you are telling
[1:08:51] men that I am ripe

[1:08:55] fruit mango tomato avocado is not ripe
[1:09:00] and it forces to wrap it dwindles and it

[1:09:06] married and you want to expose yourself
[1:09:07] to men or women they will take advantage
[1:09:10] of you and destroy your life amen so

[1:09:23] are politicians some of them are very
[1:09:26] rich wealthy affluent women

[1:09:31] are not your regular prostitute that you
[1:09:32] see them on the street no they are
[1:09:34] powerful women socially speaking and
[1:09:38] they go with certain men politicians
[1:09:40] rich men so when you see those ring it's
[1:09:43] an invitation
[1:09:45] to those people to those men amen they
[1:09:49] are spread that we pick we don't know
[1:09:51] the meaning of those Spirits we think
[1:09:52] it's just normal
[1:09:58] nail polish
[1:10:00] red Brown whatever color you put on your
[1:10:03] nails
[1:10:04] it used to be if you go to the Bible
[1:10:06] the first person that did was Jezebel
[1:10:10] and there was a prophecy that Elijah
[1:10:12] prophesied because of what she did
[1:10:13] killed and her husband what's the name
[1:10:15] jehu no is it jehu no
[1:10:17] Maybe
[1:10:18] the kid neighbor and was the husband of
[1:10:21] Ahab thank you they killed neighbors God
[1:10:25] Professor that the same place that they
[1:10:26] killed both dogs will lick their blood
[1:10:28] and the Lord anointed jehu to go kill
[1:10:31] um Jezebel so she was upstairs and she
[1:10:34] saw Jezebel soldier who come in and
[1:10:36] Jezebel was a very beautiful she was
[1:10:39] Miss America Miss West Palm Beach so she
[1:10:42] felt like I'm going to use my beauty to
[1:10:44] entice me because I know there's
[1:10:45] something up his lips he's not coming in
[1:10:48] peace
[1:10:48] so he put He painted his fingernails
[1:10:51] printed his lips
[1:10:52] eyelashes to attract jehu
[1:10:56] to have sex with to seduce him
[1:10:58] but the Lord has put upon his heart to
[1:11:01] kill him so he sent his soldiers to go
[1:11:02] and drop him down he died and it
[1:11:04] happened just according to what the Holy
[1:11:07] Ghost prophesied through the Prophet
[1:11:08] Elijah why if the Lord give you brown
[1:11:10] fingernails why do you want to make it
[1:11:12] yellow blue green whatever what is the
[1:11:15] essence
[1:11:16] you are picking speed of Jezebel into
[1:11:18] your life
[1:11:19] and it will manifest in the course of
[1:11:21] time especially the young kids your
[1:11:23] spirit is now developing you don't know
[1:11:25] what is good and bad you don't know the
[1:11:27] word you are living in that they are
[1:11:28] wicked spirit and when you invite demons
[1:11:30] into your life the demons will take over
[1:11:31] your life and Destroy You amen
[1:11:35] so we thank the Lord Force lives we were
[1:11:38] safe on that day and I keep praying for
[1:11:41] them we will pray in the Lord to raise
[1:11:42] the church we're looking for somebody
[1:11:44] with the city of representation to pay
[1:11:46] the gospel and then start the church in
[1:11:48] Santa Marta Colombia I think brother but
[1:11:51] Ernesto is from Colombia and Tatiana as
[1:11:54] well he's from Colombia so God bless you

[1:11:59] and this is what I want to the the
[1:12:01] scriptures I want to read for the young
[1:12:02] people and I chose International
[1:12:04] Children's Bible so that you can
[1:12:06] understand sort of the King James
[1:12:08] and then I want to read
[1:12:10] but as someone can you do me a favor can
[1:12:11] you read for me God bless you

[1:12:24] many troubles when that time comes you
[1:12:27] won't have much to enjoy
[1:12:29] when you become old the light from the
[1:12:32] sun moon and stars will seemed dark to
[1:12:35] you it will seem as if the rain clouds
[1:12:37] never go away
[1:12:39] at that time your arms will lose their
[1:12:41] strength your strong legs will become
[1:12:43] weak and bent your teeth will fall out
[1:12:47] so you can't cannot chew your eyes will
[1:12:50] not see clearly your ears will be deaf
[1:12:53] to the noise in the streets you will
[1:12:56] barely you you were barely hearing
[1:12:59] singing the sound of the millstone
[1:13:01] grinding your your grain will seem very
[1:13:03] quiet but you'll wake up when a bird is
[1:13:07] first excuse me is first starting to
[1:13:09] sing
[1:13:10] you will fear high places and you will
[1:13:12] be afraid to go for a walk because of
[1:13:15] you may fall your hair will become white
[1:13:18] like the flowers on an almond tree you
[1:13:21] will live along like a grasshopper when
[1:13:22] you walk your desires will be gone then
[1:13:26] you will go to your Everlasting home and
[1:13:28] people will go to your funeral
[1:13:30] remember God before your life has
[1:13:32] snapped like a silver chain remember God
[1:13:35] before your life is broken like a Golden
[1:13:37] Bowl it will be as useless as a broken
[1:13:40] bucket at the spring it will be no good
[1:13:42] like a broken wheel at the water well
[1:13:45] your body will become part of the Dust
[1:13:47] of the Earth again but your spirit will
[1:13:49] return to God who gave it everything is
[1:13:52] useless the teacher says that everything
[1:13:54] is useless
[1:13:56] my precious brother amen amen so
[1:14:01] as a child sometimes you might think
[1:14:03] you're going to be a child forever
[1:14:05] yes
[1:14:07] at the age of maybe 16 12 to 16 12 to 16
[1:14:11] 18 20 25 you are in the bloom of Life
[1:14:14] maybe the best time of your life but
[1:14:17] that's when you are the most vulnerable
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:20] that's the best time to receive the Lord
[1:14:22] Jesus Christ
[1:14:24] sweet 16 when you are in that age
[1:14:27] if we're going to receive Christ into
[1:14:28] your life
[1:14:29] you'll be fine you cross over all the
[1:14:31] ages but if you don't receive Christ
[1:14:33] into your life
[1:14:35] and you allow the spirit that is working
[1:14:36] in this world there's a spirit on Earth
[1:14:38] called love this year spirit and I'll
[1:14:40] speak a little bit about it amen
[1:14:42] let's go to the next slide I'll just
[1:14:45] want to read through the slide and come
[1:14:47] to the sermon now this is Jeremiah 29
[1:14:50] 11-14 he said for I know they thought
[1:14:52] that I think throw it toward you says
[1:14:56] the Lord thought of peace and not of
[1:14:57] evil to give you an expected end God has
[1:15:00] a program for you he has a plan for you
[1:15:02] but you have to be ready to receive the
[1:15:04] plan of God then shall he call upon me
[1:15:07] and you shall go and pray unto me and
[1:15:09] now he can unto you and he shall seek me
[1:15:11] and find me when you shall search for me
[1:15:13] with all your heart and I'll be fond of
[1:15:16] you says the Lord and I will turn away
[1:15:18] your captivity and I'll gather you from
[1:15:20] the all the nations and from the place
[1:15:22] whether I've driven you says the Lord
[1:15:25] and I'll bring you again into the place
[1:15:27] once I cause you to be carried away
[1:15:29] captive if you accept Jesus Christ into
[1:15:32] your heart the Lord will bring you to
[1:15:33] where you were before the foundation of
[1:15:35] the world Amen let's go to the next
[1:15:37] scripture this for only on us for
[1:15:41] brothers and sisters not for young
[1:15:42] people and young young girls and young
[1:15:44] boys
[1:15:45] proverbs 31 10 2.
[1:15:49] I'm just really intend to I think a
[1:15:51] couple of verses are there selected some
[1:15:52] verses so who can find a virtuous woman
[1:15:54] for her price is far above rubies
[1:15:57] the heart of a husband that safely
[1:16:00] trusts in her so that he shall have no
[1:16:03] need of spoil she will do him good and
[1:16:05] not evil all the days of her life
[1:16:07] strength and honor are her clothing and
[1:16:10] she shall rejoice in time to come she
[1:16:12] openeth her mouth with wisdom and her
[1:16:14] tongue is the law of kindness her
[1:16:16] children ariseth I rise up and call her
[1:16:19] blessed her husband also and he Praises
[1:16:22] her many daughters have done virtuously
[1:16:25] but thou Excellence them all thou the
[1:16:28] new generation you can live a life
[1:16:31] worthy of the gospel and you have a
[1:16:33] testimony like a testimony of Ruth like
[1:16:36] a testimony testimony of Esther
[1:16:38] testimony of Mary if you commit your
[1:16:41] heart to the Lord and he goes to say
[1:16:43] that favor verse 30 favor is deceitful
[1:16:45] beauty is vain but the woman that fear
[1:16:49] is the Lord she shall be priests give
[1:16:52] hair of the fruit of her hands and let
[1:16:54] her own works praise in the gates amen
[1:16:57] if you commit your life to the Lord the
[1:17:00] Lord will bless you amen and I want to
[1:17:03] speak I want to just I want to run
[1:17:05] through my scriptures and quotes let's
[1:17:06] look at where I pick the word I am sweet
[1:17:09] 16. babram was talking about a little 16
[1:17:12] year old girl in a church
[1:17:15] and she had she was blessed to her
[1:17:17] brother Brahma I said pastor
[1:17:19] so you are blessed to Harbor the Jack as
[1:17:21] your pastor but if you don't recognize
[1:17:23] it it will do you no good and you want
[1:17:26] to use sweet 16 I don't know her name
[1:17:27] but Ram didn't say her name but I want
[1:17:29] to call her sweet 16. she was 16 years
[1:17:31] old when everything began to
[1:17:34] top her down let's read a Hebrews
[1:17:37] chapter not Hebrew the book of Hebrews
[1:17:39] the brown preached in 1957
[1:17:41] 0922 e is right there it's a paragraph
[1:17:45] three five fives a man see some some
[1:17:47] little Jezebel all painted up you know
[1:17:50] and you go around fall for her maybe you
[1:17:52] got a good wife and then you call
[1:17:54] yourself a Christian shame on you you
[1:17:56] need another dose of the altar that's
[1:17:58] right and some of you some of you women
[1:18:01] look around at some old guy with his
[1:18:04] hair slicked down enough vaseline on it
[1:18:07] to open his mouth and then some little
[1:18:10] old girl here not long ago so vice versa
[1:18:12] a certain maybe a woman with a good
[1:18:14] husband doesn't appreciate the husband
[1:18:16] will go for somebody like that you know
[1:18:19] Brown was giving examples now let's go
[1:18:21] to 360 paragraph three five seven some
[1:18:23] little old girl here not long ago this
[1:18:25] this ain't a joke because I don't mean I
[1:18:28] don't mean to tell it as a joke but the
[1:18:29] people knows that this is no place of
[1:18:31] joke but a little old girl here there
[1:18:33] was a five boys here Christian boys long
[1:18:37] time ago when I was pastoring here we
[1:18:39] used to have just young men's classes
[1:18:41] and I'll speak to the young women on
[1:18:43] Sunday afternoon and about about sex and
[1:18:46] things then the next Sunday Sunday
[1:18:48] afternoon speak to the young men and
[1:18:50] trying to get those things kept out amen
[1:18:53] he's not speaking to them to go have sex
[1:18:56] but they want to keep it out of them
[1:18:58] because that is the spirit that is what
[1:18:59] fighting them amen and this morning
[1:19:02] we're going to be very straightforward
[1:19:04] because there's a proverb or an adage in
[1:19:08] my language that said that if a boil
[1:19:11] Is Not Afraid or is not shameful to grow
[1:19:14] on your nose
[1:19:16] don't be ashamed to put a bomb
[1:19:18] or abandoned on the ball to drain it out
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:23] what I'm trying to say that if a boil
[1:19:25] right you know boy or pimples grows on
[1:19:27] your nose don't be afraid to put a cream
[1:19:30] whatever
[1:19:32] to kick it to to heal it what do I mean
[1:19:34] if the devil even at that age is
[1:19:38] planting so so many spirits in a lot of
[1:19:41] children why should we be afraid and shy
[1:19:44] and not talk about things plainly among
[1:19:47] the youth that is troubling them so as
[1:19:48] ministers
[1:19:49] we're going to have a stakeholders amen
[1:19:52] the stakeholders are
[1:19:55] the young people themselves they're on
[1:19:57] the center of everything
[1:19:59] the parents are one of the stakeholders
[1:20:02] or players
[1:20:04] the ministry we are one of the major
[1:20:06] stakeholders
[1:20:08] and the almighty God himself
[1:20:11] is the chief Captain amen
[1:20:13] and all the three stakeholders or four
[1:20:16] have got a part to play
[1:20:18] parents at certain age in your
[1:20:21] children's life
[1:20:22] they're going to turn into age certain
[1:20:24] age that hormones
[1:20:26] let them call it chemicals will be
[1:20:27] growing through their body because they
[1:20:29] were born in that attribute
[1:20:31] and so they begin to ask questions they
[1:20:33] want to find out who they are why am I
[1:20:35] going through this why do they
[1:20:37] menstruate why did they grow certain
[1:20:39] hair on part of the body is just normal
[1:20:42] so you the parents shouldn't be ashamed
[1:20:45] to tell them how they were born
[1:20:47] there's nothing shameful about it to
[1:20:49] tell your children that men grow or
[1:20:51] women grow and they get to a point they
[1:20:53] get married and then they unite and
[1:20:55] bring for children
[1:20:56] because we don't teach them
[1:20:58] they're learning from school on the
[1:21:00] internet from Friends boyfriends
[1:21:03] girlfriends old men old women treat them
[1:21:06] the wrong way and destroy the life of
[1:21:08] your children
[1:21:09] so you should be able to sit your
[1:21:10] daughter your son down and tell them
[1:21:12] that it's not a mystery
[1:21:14] it's just normal thing that human beings
[1:21:15] do God ordain it so my daughter my son
[1:21:18] you have to see the holy ghost first
[1:21:21] when you have the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:21:24] Ghost Christ Jesus says will tell you at
[1:21:26] the right Point who your husband or your
[1:21:28] wife is and you can marry and live as me
[1:21:32] and your daddy or as me and your mommy
[1:21:33] live amen but until then
[1:21:36] if you go into sex without getting
[1:21:39] married it's sin
[1:21:41] you're driving your guardian angels away
[1:21:43] from you
[1:21:44] and there's a prize to pay
[1:21:47] you can go have sex all you want
[1:21:50] to satisfy gratify your flesh
[1:21:52] but there might surprise on the way that
[1:21:55] you regret the rest of your life
[1:21:59] but if you wait on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] to give you the ordained husband and
[1:22:04] ordained wife you'll be the happiest
[1:22:06] person
[1:22:07] amen Glory Hallelujah
[1:22:12] so but Abraham wasn't ashamed to
[1:22:15] call the young girls and teach them
[1:22:17] about sex
[1:22:18] and the young boys says to drive that
[1:22:21] thing from them and if you plan nothing
[1:22:22] in them when they go to school they know
[1:22:24] that Mom and Dad and ministers have
[1:22:25] taught us you are not going to teach me
[1:22:28] your perversion because I know the right
[1:22:30] one
[1:22:30] because if you don't stand for something
[1:22:32] any wind can blow you
[1:22:34] so if you know where they stand they
[1:22:36] know that yes I'm going to grow and get
[1:22:38] married so I'm not going to have a
[1:22:40] boyfriend I'm not going to expose myself
[1:22:41] to you you're not going to destroy my
[1:22:43] life but if you don't plan that thing in
[1:22:45] them
[1:22:46] and they are just they don't know
[1:22:47] nothing
[1:22:49] and if some
[1:22:50] use certain ways for for Sweet 16's
[1:22:53] boyfriend you call them old shrimps if
[1:22:55] some old shrimp
[1:22:57] tell them that you are the most
[1:22:58] beautiful lady on this planet
[1:23:00] wow I never knew I'm the most beautiful
[1:23:02] my dad never told me my mom never told
[1:23:05] me wow Johnny
[1:23:07] and he falls for Johnny
[1:23:09] because nobody even your brain don't
[1:23:11] tell them they are beautiful you
[1:23:12] probably don't tell them they are
[1:23:13] gorgeous they don't tell them that what
[1:23:15] they need to hear at that age in their
[1:23:17] time because girls grew to certain age
[1:23:20] they need to hear certain things and
[1:23:21] father and mother shouldn't be ashamed
[1:23:23] to let them know that they are beautiful
[1:23:25] and God has raising them for purpose
[1:23:28] maybe they're going to marry a minister
[1:23:30] of God so you preserve yourself and use
[1:23:32] your character to bless the ministry God
[1:23:35] will put you under amen Glory Hallelujah
[1:23:39] to the Lord
[1:23:40] let's go to the next one the next slide
[1:23:42] sweet 16. let's read on so some little
[1:23:46] old girl started going with some old
[1:23:48] some little old shrimp
[1:23:50] and I tried to find out this was in the
[1:23:52] 50s so I wanted to know what the problem
[1:23:54] mean by shrimp because we know shrimp I
[1:23:57] love shrimp I love Seafood but it's not
[1:23:59] talking about the stream in the ocean
[1:24:01] or streaming their Rivers he's talking
[1:24:02] about a character that looks like a
[1:24:05] shrimp and I found out that shrimp is
[1:24:07] somebody who presents himself who is of
[1:24:09] who is weak
[1:24:11] low quality but they present themselves
[1:24:13] it disguise himself as strong person
[1:24:18] so
[1:24:20] so what did I get to he said some little
[1:24:22] ocean said some little old girls started
[1:24:25] going with some old little shrimp
[1:24:27] downtown here smoked cigarette and had a
[1:24:30] flask in his pocket and he drove a
[1:24:32] little Roadster car around town I
[1:24:34] couldn't see what she's seen in that boy
[1:24:36] he wouldn't come to church he would sit
[1:24:38] out there put her in church out here and
[1:24:42] then he sat out there on the outside in
[1:24:43] his car and wait we didn't come in
[1:24:45] church I said to her one day she leave a
[1:24:48] New Albany I said I want to ask you
[1:24:51] something girly what in the world do you
[1:24:53] see in that boy I said that the first
[1:24:55] place he hits the very religion that you
[1:24:58] have he despises your Christ
[1:25:04] he would never make you a husband
[1:25:06] he will make you miserable all your life
[1:25:09] and I said well there's fine little
[1:25:11] Christian boys here that you could go
[1:25:13] with
[1:25:14] and there your daddy and your mother
[1:25:16] despite the thought of you going out but
[1:25:18] you're going anyhow you think I am sweet
[1:25:22] 16. that's why I pick my contest sweet
[1:25:26] 16. that is the age don't think about it
[1:25:29] only 16 you could be from 10 to 20. so
[1:25:33] sweet this isn't just the average it
[1:25:35] could be 15 11 12 17 18 I'm sweet 17 so
[1:25:40] put whatever age you are there amen
[1:25:42] I'm sweet 16 and let's see what
[1:25:45] transpired
[1:25:46] now she started wearing makeup and
[1:25:48] running around and first thing she was
[1:25:50] in Road houses you know Road houses
[1:25:52] clubs pubs where they drink I used to
[1:25:56] live in UK England
[1:25:59] Road houses pubs is where Irish people
[1:26:01] they drink like
[1:26:02] I don't know like fish
[1:26:04] people drink women and men drink is like
[1:26:06] they can't wait to go go from work and
[1:26:09] go drink so they go to pass and drinks
[1:26:11] and this girl who was Raising church
[1:26:13] with Christian parents she found herself
[1:26:16] in those pubs and clubs and country
[1:26:18] clubs he said now that's what she's gone
[1:26:21] on to Eternity
[1:26:24] sweet sister got inspired quickly
[1:26:27] because she tried to be mature when he
[1:26:30] wasn't mature
[1:26:31] she would try to leave
[1:26:33] a life that God did not ordain her to
[1:26:36] live
[1:26:37] God ordained her to be a sweet 16 to set
[1:26:40] the Lord Jesus Christ but sweet 16 let
[1:26:43] the last of the flesh
[1:26:45] the last of the eyes the pride of life
[1:26:48] influence her to go with a person that
[1:26:52] didn't fear the lord she didn't have
[1:26:54] nothing to do with Christ
[1:26:56] she never even one time go into the
[1:26:58] church room and I want to stop here and
[1:27:01] tell you the kind of Pastor that the
[1:27:03] lord gave you to Sweet 16 amen and I'm
[1:27:06] not going to tell you from example from
[1:27:08] the message but people that I work with
[1:27:09] brother Abraham
[1:27:11] who gave a verbal testimony of their
[1:27:14] experience
[1:27:15] and I'm not talking about this prophetic
[1:27:16] Ministry but his ministry even as a
[1:27:18] pastor amen so that you appreciate
[1:27:21] the family God put you into if you are
[1:27:24] here and the Lord bless you with a
[1:27:25] Christian father and mother be thankful
[1:27:27] to the Lord Christian grandparents
[1:27:29] uncles aunties whoever friends
[1:27:33] Godfathers godmothers be thankful to the
[1:27:35] Lord a Christian a pastor full of the
[1:27:38] Holy Ghost brother jagdaf to Pastor you
[1:27:41] with ministers around him to bless you
[1:27:43] be thankful to the Lord is for your
[1:27:46] protection amen
[1:27:49] what did I get to Glory Hallelujah I was
[1:27:52] talking about yes I had a chance to meet
[1:27:54] a brother when I was back in Ghana
[1:27:56] and the brother was 66 years old he was
[1:27:59] born and raised in Indiana he said
[1:28:01] before I met Abraham
[1:28:03] I'm coming from the Pentecostal church
[1:28:04] and my parents believe in Divine Healing
[1:28:07] my father was a Pentecostal Minister and
[1:28:09] my younger sister my baby sister died
[1:28:11] and my father called us around we prayed
[1:28:14] and the Lord brought my sister up raise
[1:28:16] it up so we believe in divinely before
[1:28:19] even remember Abraham and when we met
[1:28:21] brother Braham we're going to the
[1:28:22] Tabernacle the message of Abraham
[1:28:24] preaching I think Lane Tech to Lin tech
[1:28:28] school college is that I was sitting
[1:28:30] there and saw the messages and said
[1:28:32] brother my Ministry is over I'm 66. the
[1:28:34] Lord told me I will go to be with him I
[1:28:37] think 83 or 80 something so you know the
[1:28:39] time was going to go said my Bible was
[1:28:41] stolen and the Lord let me know my
[1:28:42] Ministry is over so you the young people
[1:28:44] tell the mantle and and pray the gospel
[1:28:47] now this evidence of a man that believed
[1:28:50] in the Lord Jesus Christ a prophet he
[1:28:52] said they will leave everything when
[1:28:54] they met Abraham they never went back to
[1:28:56] their Pentecostal Church they always
[1:28:58] were at the Tabernacle when the ram was
[1:28:59] in town I met another brother
[1:29:02] who told me about uh brother Abraham
[1:29:06] he said he was a young boy in church and
[1:29:09] RAM Tabernacle was very strict
[1:29:12] like when when is church order silence
[1:29:15] but Brown was coming from the Baptist
[1:29:17] and the Pentecostal background so when
[1:29:19] sometime it doesn't come early you come
[1:29:20] like two hours people drive from places
[1:29:22] go their hours just to get a front seat
[1:29:25] and if we're if we're a child and you
[1:29:28] talk or somebody make noise the deacons
[1:29:30] will come and tap you maybe their mother
[1:29:32] if your child is making noise second or
[1:29:34] third time they put you at the back and
[1:29:36] brought some they'll bring somebody who
[1:29:37] want to sit in the front so this little
[1:29:39] boy was sitting I think with their
[1:29:40] mother
[1:29:41] and Barbara was coming to the pulpit
[1:29:43] from the office to pick I think
[1:29:45] anointing oil paint something like that
[1:29:47] and he saw the pill of Fire
[1:29:49] on the head of brother Abraham as he was
[1:29:51] walking the pillow fight was moving on
[1:29:52] him and he said mama look
[1:29:55] and his mom put his hand on his mouth
[1:29:57] said look Emma Brown look at him
[1:30:00] and look at the pillow fire on top of
[1:30:01] his head look at him
[1:30:03] this is the pastor God gave it to Sweet
[1:30:05] 16. a man he was born a sinner yes
[1:30:08] William Brown was born a snake like us
[1:30:10] he was an adopted son of God but he was
[1:30:13] one of the first fruits to show us the
[1:30:15] way of Jesus Christ
[1:30:17] he embodied the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost was him just like the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost want to be in you to manifest amen
[1:30:22] he was a prophet to the generation we
[1:30:24] don't worship about Abraham
[1:30:26] We Worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] he was a prophet like Paul Jeremiah
[1:30:31] Abraham John the Baptist God use but we
[1:30:34] worship the Lord Jesus Christ and even
[1:30:36] in the celestial Dimension when before
[1:30:39] God ordained prophet and ordain knew the
[1:30:42] gift he put in you it wasn't putting you
[1:30:44] when you were born it was in you when
[1:30:46] you were in the celestial Dimension you
[1:30:48] were still funny you were like 18 years
[1:30:49] old so when John the Baptist was didn't
[1:30:53] know not John about to sorry John the
[1:30:55] Divine
[1:30:55] met the seventh angel with the seven
[1:30:57] angel that was brother Brown in the
[1:30:59] seven sixth Dimension and he wanted to
[1:31:01] worship he said no do not worship me I'm
[1:31:03] one of your servant one of the seven
[1:31:04] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we
[1:31:08] don't watch about Abraham he's a prophet
[1:31:10] that God reads for us to use the word of
[1:31:12] the Lord to break the bread of life to
[1:31:13] her just like Paul but we worship the
[1:31:16] Lord Jesus Christ amen now this is the
[1:31:19] pastor the lord gave it to Sweet 16. but
[1:31:22] in that time
[1:31:24] sweet 16 didn't take advantage
[1:31:26] of the pastor the lord gave it to him to
[1:31:28] her
[1:31:29] sweet sister let her flesh
[1:31:31] the influence of maybe her schoolmates
[1:31:33] who are boyfriends so she went for a
[1:31:36] boyfriend and let's see I think I didn't
[1:31:37] finish reading Lem finished reading
[1:31:40] where did I go to he said he got to
[1:31:41] Eternity but then she stood here and you
[1:31:44] know what excuse the girl gave me back
[1:31:45] there
[1:31:46] she loved that boy she said he's got
[1:31:48] such a cute little feet and it smells so
[1:31:52] good
[1:31:53] could you imagine that perfume himself
[1:31:55] up
[1:31:56] just as a not a man
[1:31:59] look I said sister I'd rather go with a
[1:32:01] Christian boy that had fit like gravel
[1:32:04] cars
[1:32:05] and smell like pulled cut
[1:32:09] if he was absolutely a Christian
[1:32:12] and I'll go that's Friday true it's an
[1:32:15] excuse just a such cute little feet and
[1:32:18] smells good the little the little
[1:32:20] Roadhouse Runner finally ruined the life
[1:32:23] of the girl it's shame and disgraceful
[1:32:25] in other words she Drew throughout her
[1:32:27] life and she died prematurely
[1:32:30] little sister little brothers let us go
[1:32:33] into your ears when I was growing up I
[1:32:34] had a Pentecostal Elder he wasn't one of
[1:32:37] the fight for Ministry but whenever he
[1:32:39] preached he said he who has years let
[1:32:42] him hear what the spirit speaks unto the
[1:32:44] church
[1:32:45] and if a little
[1:32:47] little young in here little brother
[1:32:49] Little Sisters You've got something in
[1:32:51] here here you might not hear this we
[1:32:53] don't pray this kind of sermons too much
[1:32:56] we always pray to the adults
[1:32:58] but the Lord put upon my heart to
[1:33:00] produce to you
[1:33:01] and receive it with oil for your heart
[1:33:03] you might not hear it again in the same
[1:33:05] way again but it's something that will
[1:33:07] change your life amen

[1:33:12] but it should be entered prayerfully and
[1:33:14] reveling reverently and genuine love for

[1:34:54] he wished he wasn't even created
[1:34:56] if you go against the Lord I'm a
[1:34:59] minister I deal with a lot of people
[1:35:01] God can forgive you of whatever sin you
[1:35:03] commit but sometimes difficult for you
[1:35:04] to forgive yourself
[1:35:06] the pain and the sorrow you bring to
[1:35:08] yourself
[1:35:08] sometimes has to take God
[1:35:10] and you will keep it when the Lord has
[1:35:12] forgiving you that it doesn't even
[1:35:13] remember in his book of memory but you
[1:35:15] should remember because you brought that
[1:35:17] Soul upon yourself

[1:35:20] to write what are you going to write on
[1:35:23] your slit your life your flesh do you

[1:35:33] I have I made it let's go to the next
[1:35:35] slide
[1:35:36] to the Lord be the glory
[1:35:43] God bless sister Nelly she said Lord
[1:35:48] foreign
[1:35:54] who smells like what a boy who smells
[1:35:57] like poor cat
[1:35:58] and because I was going to teach young
[1:36:00] people I just wanted to bring him
[1:36:01] pictures
[1:36:03] now this is a skank I've seen I haven't
[1:36:06] seen a pole card before but this is a
[1:36:08] skank
[1:36:09] never mess with a skank
[1:36:14] they defend himself by emitting very
[1:36:16] sweet order I use the word sweet order
[1:36:18] it's not sweet order
[1:36:19] it says stinking smelling odor
[1:36:23] if a skunk pass around here and emit
[1:36:25] that order you can hear somewhere in a
[1:36:28] in a heavy Hill Street
[1:36:30] that's how much they smell if a skunks
[1:36:32] pass here when you are driving you can
[1:36:34] even on the highway
[1:36:37] you can smell it and you don't know
[1:36:38] whether to turn the windows Now to turn
[1:36:40] them up
[1:36:41] it's those things is a skunk comes in
[1:36:44] your house believe you me it could be a
[1:36:45] multi-billion dollar house you leave the
[1:36:47] house for the skank you can never live
[1:36:49] in the house
[1:36:50] that's how much they smell this thing
[1:36:54] and this is a polar card
[1:36:56] I think they are mainly in Europe
[1:36:58] haven't seen one before but Ram said
[1:37:01] that if a boy or a girl
[1:37:03] evens things like a scan called pull cut
[1:37:06] I rather and he's got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:08] absolutely a Christian because you can
[1:37:10] wash away the smell there's thinking
[1:37:12] smell
[1:37:13] but you can't wash away the old soul you
[1:37:16] take the Holy Ghost to remove the old
[1:37:17] person you can you could even change
[1:37:19] yourself
[1:37:20] how are you going to change somebody
[1:37:22] it takes a lot to change that person so
[1:37:25] don't go look for some Johnny or shrimp
[1:37:27] and tell yourself I'm going to change
[1:37:29] him or it's going to change her you're
[1:37:31] going to have some things thinking in
[1:37:32] your nose
[1:37:34] amen young people do you hear me
[1:37:37] Glory Hallelujah
[1:37:40] but if you can give your heart to the
[1:37:42] Lord
[1:37:43] with all of your heart
[1:37:45] you will be you'll be secured in Christ
[1:37:46] let's go to the next slide
[1:37:49] I put this one
[1:38:06] Glory Hallelujah yes this working
[1:38:09] so let me just something a little here
[1:38:12] I said there is your holy convocation
[1:38:13] what is Holy convocation is the Holy
[1:38:16] Ghost baptism not
[1:38:18] not have anything to do with the literal
[1:38:20] thing it's beyond that we are not
[1:38:21] celebrating Jewish festivals it's into
[1:38:23] the kingdom of God with eternal life
[1:38:25] with the predestinated that he never did
[1:38:28] start it never started on any day he
[1:38:31] wasn't saved on any day he was always
[1:38:33] saved amen Jesus Christ comes to redeem
[1:38:36] that but you were saved from the
[1:38:38] beginning because you had eternal life
[1:38:40] to begin with
[1:38:42] didn't begin on Earth
[1:38:45] you were saved before the foundation of
[1:38:46] the world but the Holy Ghost allows you
[1:38:48] to recognize the Salvation the lord gave
[1:38:51] to you before the foundation of the
[1:38:52] world without the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:38:54] know you are saved but the Holy Ghost
[1:38:56] quickens you your mortal flesh to
[1:38:59] recognize that salvation that was
[1:39:01] planted in you before time amen
[1:39:04] and we want to bring a lawsuit
[1:39:07] against let's go to the next slide
[1:39:09] and I'll stay here for a while you want
[1:39:12] to bring a lawsuit which I'll call it
[1:39:14] class action lawsuit against the spirit
[1:39:17] of laodicea which is false human rights
[1:39:21] now let me explain what is class action
[1:39:23] lawsuit we are no lawsuit when you get
[1:39:25] sued by by somebody individual by class
[1:39:28] action it's not even the victim that
[1:39:30] sued the people that deceive them
[1:39:33] or the defendant in class action lawsuit
[1:39:35] they are lawyers whose job is they don't
[1:39:37] kind of tend to individual individual
[1:39:40] people but they look into institutions
[1:39:43] such as Banks
[1:39:45] schools certain universities
[1:39:48] they don't have how do I call it they
[1:39:50] don't they don't have a let's say
[1:39:52] certain investors who put up they have
[1:39:54] 100 job rates what they finish will help
[1:39:57] you to get a job and then they target
[1:39:59] veterans veterans have got a GI bill
[1:40:01] when you serve in the military you end
[1:40:04] up getting certain money you can use for
[1:40:05] education so they target them they
[1:40:07] target uh people of color
[1:40:09] African-American get education and then
[1:40:12] they get trash that Dedication that they
[1:40:14] have will not they run them into debt
[1:40:16] they borrow financial aid which they
[1:40:19] can't pay they can't buy a house people
[1:40:21] of uh they target mainly
[1:40:23] Hispanics African-Americans and some
[1:40:25] white and other people but mainly
[1:40:27] African-American
[1:40:29] now this lock is given a classical
[1:40:31] example Donald Trump an ex-president of
[1:40:34] U.S had a trump University if some of
[1:40:37] you know about it
[1:40:38] that Trump University the diploma you
[1:40:40] get there is just a piece of trash
[1:40:42] it will not earn you nothing probably
[1:40:45] you can't even get a job with it in a in
[1:40:48] a way where uh Dunkin Donuts
[1:40:51] but then he was making millions
[1:40:54] getting people's money so before before
[1:40:55] when he came before he became president
[1:40:57] the father a class action lawsuit
[1:40:59] against him
[1:41:00] and he had to pay 25 million and most of
[1:41:03] the students get about 90 of the school
[1:41:05] fees that they paid the tuition
[1:41:07] another class action lawsuit is a big
[1:41:10] Pharma pharmaceutical companies they
[1:41:12] make billions and trillions of dollars
[1:41:15] and they have power because they are
[1:41:17] connected to uh the politicians
[1:41:20] so they they push let me take a simple
[1:41:22] example like aspirin baby aspirin 81
[1:41:25] milligram and then Bayer makes baby
[1:41:27] aspirin that people take they say when
[1:41:29] you get to 80 years old take it to
[1:41:31] prevent stroke and stuff like that now
[1:41:33] research has shown that is not always
[1:41:34] needed some people don't need it now
[1:41:37] people take it and they could get
[1:41:38] stomach ulcer they bleed in their
[1:41:40] stomach now class action lawsuit anyone
[1:41:43] who has taken baby aspirin you don't
[1:41:45] have to go to court you just have to
[1:41:47] what give your consent that I took a
[1:41:49] baby aspirin and I suffered ulcer or
[1:41:52] ulcerated stomach and I'll earn you some
[1:41:54] money so in class action lawsuit you
[1:41:57] don't have to visit sometimes the
[1:41:57] lawyers themselves don't go to court
[1:41:59] they send people with that Bayer company
[1:42:01] uh through their aspirin baby aspirin
[1:42:04] let's say they found out they sent they
[1:42:07] know why you take your prescriptions so
[1:42:08] they have your information they will
[1:42:09] send you a letter and if they get about
[1:42:11] let's say a million or 500 people now
[1:42:13] they can stand on it and now raise a
[1:42:15] lawsuit against Bayer company
[1:42:17] Banks certain banks will take when you
[1:42:20] have your own money not the credit card
[1:42:22] when you're going to take money from the
[1:42:23] bank they take money from your debit
[1:42:25] card
[1:42:26] and then dispose them and they file a
[1:42:28] lawsuit against those Banks so class
[1:42:30] action lawsuit you don't have to even go
[1:42:33] to court the victim even don't know that
[1:42:35] they've been deceived and duped but then
[1:42:37] their lawyers are the one who knows it
[1:42:39] and then bring this lawsuit and then let
[1:42:42] you know you just give your consent you
[1:42:44] will get some 10 million sorry ten
[1:42:46] thousand dollars you could get uh 200
[1:42:49] 000 you could get as low as 500 whatever
[1:42:51] they will calculate the amount and then
[1:42:53] divide it among the people so that's
[1:42:55] class action lawsuit and now the natural
[1:42:58] types are spiritual
[1:42:59] some of God's people have been deceived
[1:43:01] and duped by the old devil a spirit
[1:43:04] called loudacia loudicia means what
[1:43:07] people's rights
[1:43:09] but it's a spirit of deception the devil
[1:43:12] told you that you have the right to
[1:43:13] change from being a man to a woman
[1:43:15] change your sex
[1:43:17] you have you're a man
[1:43:19] but you find yourself in a girl's body
[1:43:21] so now you can change your sex and be
[1:43:24] change your gender and become a trans
[1:43:26] they have a bunch of names says trans
[1:43:29] and whatever
[1:43:32] we're born to know that men we have men
[1:43:34] and women
[1:43:35] but now we've got in between a bunch of
[1:43:37] things that you can name it
[1:43:41] and that's the spirit of laodicea Amen
[1:43:43] but it says not even supposed to be here
[1:43:46] was in in the church ages
[1:43:49] time and laodicea was supposed to be
[1:43:52] dead
[1:43:53] but just like the professor Express
[1:43:55] don't die the sense within the time of
[1:43:57] Noah they lingers on and they appear so
[1:44:01] ladisia is right here telling you that
[1:44:03] you've got a right you are 18 years old
[1:44:05] you can move from your parental house
[1:44:06] you can trance yourself and become a
[1:44:09] woman let me tell you people that commit
[1:44:10] suicide trans people
[1:44:13] lesbians nobody killed himself
[1:44:16] because God gave you a masculine spirit
[1:44:20] and you take hormones to develop breasts
[1:44:22] your son or the woman you slay masculine
[1:44:25] so you are in a nightmare you are
[1:44:28] fighting between being a man and being a
[1:44:30] woman
[1:44:32] your natural spirit is a man
[1:44:34] I will never be a woman I'm a man but
[1:44:36] then when you trance you're trying to
[1:44:38] tell your intelligence that hey quick
[1:44:39] I'm a woman I'm a girl I'm a woman I'm a
[1:44:42] girl I'm a woman I'm a girl
[1:44:46] you're a man
[1:44:48] so your brain is going this way and they
[1:44:52] destroy themselves they commit suicide
[1:44:55] it's a spirit on Earth
[1:44:57] in schools in politics in a job place in
[1:45:01] homes in families if you let yourself
[1:45:04] God has given you one thing your choice
[1:45:08] you've got a choice
[1:45:10] like 316 she was of age you know what
[1:45:13] was good and bad
[1:45:14] the parent couldn't tie her and take her
[1:45:17] to church
[1:45:18] your dad cannot tie you on his belt and
[1:45:21] take you to work no I don't want my
[1:45:22] child to commit uh fornication so I'm
[1:45:24] tying her no your pain cannot do that
[1:45:26] you sweet 16 sweet 11 sweet 12 sweet 17
[1:45:30] sweet 18 you have got a choice to make
[1:45:33] just like your print made their choices
[1:45:35] you either choose Jesus Christ
[1:45:37] and you fill your heart
[1:45:39] and you'll be singing Hallelujah and
[1:45:41] victory in your life or you choose
[1:45:44] perversion laodicea
[1:45:46] and you might not you might Aspire
[1:45:48] before the time the Lord allotted for
[1:45:50] you
[1:45:51] if God ordain you for eternal life you
[1:45:54] go back to Glory by your time here
[1:45:57] will not be a good memory
[1:46:00] amen he who has yes no physical yes
[1:46:04] we've got a hear on your heart let him
[1:46:06] hear what they're supposed to say to you
[1:46:08] amen
[1:46:11] are very aggressive
[1:46:15] I had a message from a friend he said be
[1:46:19] careful if your children order books
[1:46:20] from Amazon
[1:46:22] you might not know the books that
[1:46:24] they're ordering he said what does it
[1:46:26] teaching them to be trans to begin to be
[1:46:28] lesbians
[1:46:29] they are permitting everywhere in
[1:46:31] society everywhere
[1:46:34] politics
[1:46:36] it's what the Antichrist but Brahm said
[1:46:38] that the Bible said that the sins of the
[1:46:40] amorites
[1:46:41] will hit full
[1:46:43] Sodom and Gomorrah the lord gave them
[1:46:46] their rights men going after men women
[1:46:48] after women but you know what happened
[1:46:50] to Sudan Gomorrah the same thing all the
[1:46:52] world United States Europe Africa the
[1:46:55] Lord has given us right
[1:46:57] choose whatever you want to choose if
[1:46:58] you want to be gay
[1:46:59] that is your choice
[1:47:02] but one day you find yourself committing
[1:47:03] suicide
[1:47:06] one day you you're great
[1:47:08] that life
[1:47:09] you can't reverse it
[1:47:11] you have destroyed your Earthly Journey

[1:47:15] you that run away from laadisia and
[1:47:18] accept Jesus Christ in your heart
[1:47:20] seeking the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:47:22] seek the Lord with all of your heart
[1:47:24] and fear the lord I said Chad what you
[1:47:27] need is the fear of the Lord is the
[1:47:29] beginning of wisdom if you fear the lord
[1:47:31] certain spirit will not come around you
[1:47:34] because they fear of the Lord forms a
[1:47:36] circle around you say no I'll never do
[1:47:38] this I'll never let somebody touch me
[1:47:40] when I'm not married
[1:47:42] if I do that God is going to kill me
[1:47:44] that is not my life that's not what my
[1:47:46] pastor taught me my friend don't teach
[1:47:48] me that you can keep that in your family

[1:49:04] 11 year old boy
[1:49:06] even somebody who might be 80 years old
[1:49:08] who didn't save the Lord will not get

[1:49:14] people were crying talking about him
[1:49:17] how this boy was standing for the Lord
[1:49:19] pleading the blood of Jesus Christ on
[1:49:21] him
[1:49:22] I said he was an inspiration to me to be
[1:49:25] frank with you
[1:49:26] 11 year old boy
[1:49:28] what made that difference
[1:49:30] is chosen to give his heart to the Lord
[1:49:33] and serve the Lord you can take your
[1:49:35] seed God bless you
[1:49:40] so my brother my sister doesn't it

[1:49:44] not what matters by the time the Lord
[1:49:47] has loted for you
[1:49:48] if you leave Jesus Christ if God forbid
[1:49:51] but Joseph went to be with Glory his
[1:49:53] testimony will ring bells on Earth and
[1:49:55] in heaven it wasn't a testimony people
[1:49:59] pay minister to give their families good
[1:50:01] testimony when they die that has got
[1:50:03] nothing to do with God
[1:50:05] they know they were drunkard they were
[1:50:07] womanizers they were just name it they
[1:50:10] were armed robbers but on the on their
[1:50:12] on their funeral day they pay ministers
[1:50:14] you know my brother this you know give
[1:50:16] and the persons will just ministers
[1:50:18] whatever officiating ministers will
[1:50:19] write wonderful testimonies oh Mr swans

[1:50:24] always they use the word always
[1:50:27] he always was good and kind to people
[1:50:29] once once he was fighting every one of
[1:50:32] the neighbors he was no kind person he
[1:50:34] was an evil man
[1:50:36] that testimony doesn't go nowhere
[1:50:41] but testimony is the Life of Christ in a
[1:50:45] person
[1:50:46] amen
[1:50:48] and young people you've got the
[1:50:50] opportunity to give your life to the
[1:50:51] Lord
[1:50:52] to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:54] what you have to be thinking is do I
[1:50:56] have the Holy Ghost Lord give me the
[1:50:58] Holy Ghost
[1:50:59] let me just read a little bit we are
[1:51:01] getting to the close and I have a gift
[1:51:03] for the young people
[1:51:04] praise the Lord hallelujah let me read a
[1:51:07] little bit here I think a future home
[1:51:09] 64. yeah let me let me just go straight
[1:51:14] Satan Sinners and sinners has gone
[1:51:16] forever it's all done it's talking about
[1:51:17] the holy ghost blended into eternity and
[1:51:20] all that was perverted that great
[1:51:21] Archangel that said that one day Satan
[1:51:24] that that did all this evil will be
[1:51:26] destroyed remember the Bible said that
[1:51:29] if that Soul won't do as he did said do
[1:51:32] he will even destroy that soul but you
[1:51:34] see you can't destroy him he can't
[1:51:36] destroy himself and remain God so if
[1:51:38] that soul is of the world it has to be
[1:51:40] destroyed but if it's Eternal with God
[1:51:42] it never did begin because it's part of
[1:51:44] God and can never be destroyed amen what
[1:51:46] a beautiful how thankful the church
[1:51:49] ought to see that
[1:51:50] that if God give you the Holy Ghost
[1:51:52] baptism part of Christ is important into
[1:51:54] your heart the old nature is gone the
[1:51:56] old soul is consumed Christ is born into
[1:51:58] your heart
[1:51:59] and then become a new person you've got
[1:52:02] a new husband a New Soul a new nature a
[1:52:05] new believing in you
[1:52:07] that is what they cry the church is
[1:52:08] built upon amen
[1:52:10] let's go to the next slide
[1:52:14] Glory Hallelujah to the Lord oh let's
[1:52:17] see Heaven and Earth have met God and
[1:52:19] man is reconciled a restored Eden has
[1:52:22] begun all the cases is gone just like
[1:52:25] all the cases of sin is gone when the
[1:52:27] Holy Ghost accepts you see you don't
[1:52:30] accept it it accepts you because it's
[1:52:32] God's attributes see if it's the holy
[1:52:35] ghost means God's spirit it is the
[1:52:36] attribute they thought of God has
[1:52:38] accepted you because you were ordained
[1:52:41] for that purpose
[1:52:42] yet you was born in sin but God had the
[1:52:45] attribute and here you express yourself
[1:52:48] here on Earth and he comes down and gets
[1:52:51] you see you are back here here is where
[1:52:54] you belong to sin has lost its power
[1:52:56] that's right the desire of sin has then
[1:52:59] gone from your heart when the Holy Ghost
[1:53:01] comes in you are a restored person amen
[1:53:05] when the Holy Ghost comes in my brother
[1:53:08] my sister you are restored
[1:53:10] let's go to the next one
[1:53:12] now this way I'm going to
[1:53:14] be on their mothers God can use anybody
[1:53:17] you want to use
[1:53:19] there was a prayer meeting where a lady
[1:53:21] had a baby that was sick
[1:53:23] and the Holy Ghost impressed upon
[1:53:25] another mother to pray for the for the
[1:53:27] late for the baby
[1:53:28] and he said no he's going to have babram
[1:53:30] he's going to pray for him who am I to
[1:53:32] go pray for for her for a baby so there
[1:53:35] was there was a conversation his own
[1:53:36] heart between her and the Lord so let's
[1:53:38] see let's read a little bit he said
[1:53:39] there was a little a little mother
[1:53:41] walking around packing a baby and there
[1:53:44] was another little mother sitting there
[1:53:45] typical Southern mother with a little
[1:53:48] gingham or whatever Calico I think it's
[1:53:51] a white cloth or whatever you call it
[1:53:53] dress on she said just a little
[1:53:55] housewife but the Lord kept dealing with
[1:53:58] that woman go pray for that baby while
[1:54:01] she look and the woman had prayed had
[1:54:03] prayer card and oh she said I'll be
[1:54:06] afraid to go pray for that baby brother
[1:54:07] Brahm is going to pray for that baby
[1:54:09] tonight the man got a prayer cast and
[1:54:12] said I wouldn't do that and he turned
[1:54:14] she turned around and the Lord said to
[1:54:15] her just revealed to her heart go pray
[1:54:19] for that baby so let's go on the next
[1:54:22] slide well it just kept haunting her so
[1:54:25] much she said well if that if that woman
[1:54:27] comes back through here again I'll I'm
[1:54:29] going to stop her so she said lady would
[1:54:31] you take my seat and sit down here I
[1:54:34] know you are just you just wore out with
[1:54:36] that baby he wouldn't and he would he
[1:54:39] wouldn't be here for a couple hours
[1:54:40] wasn't going to be here for a couple
[1:54:42] hours thank you sister I appreciate I
[1:54:45] hate to take your seat said being then
[1:54:47] being then we got into conversation
[1:54:49] would you mind if I just offer a little
[1:54:51] prayer for your baby
[1:54:54] I see you got a prayer card perhaps but
[1:54:56] Brown will pray for that baby tonight
[1:54:57] said but just to relieve my feeling
[1:55:00] would you mind if I offer a little
[1:55:01] prayer she said why certainly not to
[1:55:04] study here she held the little baby out
[1:55:06] and the little mother lay hands over the
[1:55:08] over the baby and pretty simple a simple
[1:55:12] little prayer
[1:55:13] let's go to the next slide
[1:55:15] and then the little woman couldn't have
[1:55:17] no place okay let me jump she said oh my
[1:55:19] let me go to the red I'm reading from
[1:55:21] the red
[1:55:22] oh my maybe I shouldn't have done that
[1:55:23] sometimes when the Lord leads you to do
[1:55:25] something and then after your human mind
[1:55:27] tells you that oh maybe I did something
[1:55:29] wrong he said maybe I shouldn't have
[1:55:31] done that but I felt better after I'd
[1:55:33] done it when the little woman came up
[1:55:35] the line with the baby the Holy Spirit
[1:55:37] Come begin to talk to the woman tell her
[1:55:40] who she was and what's the matter with
[1:55:41] the baby but said you know your baby is
[1:55:44] already healed because a little lady has
[1:55:46] prayed for her with a lot of Calico

[1:57:26] forming the Lord Jesus Christ in my
[1:57:28] heart
