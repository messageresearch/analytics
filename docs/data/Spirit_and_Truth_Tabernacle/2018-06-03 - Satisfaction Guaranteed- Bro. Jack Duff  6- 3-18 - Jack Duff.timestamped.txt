[20:52] I didn't expect to sing that even though
[20:59] I was on the list you know I really have
[21:07] a couple of songs in my heart and I just
[21:13] you know everybody's going through
[21:16] something and you know just hold on to
[21:21] the promises that God has given you
[21:24] doesn't matter how hard it may seem but
[21:28] God has given all of us a promise and
[21:31] with those promises it's up to us to
[21:34] hold on to them when you see people walk
[21:38] away your family your friends you know
[21:43] just know that God said it's you in your
[21:46] household and you just hold on to that
[21:49] and even when you feel like your faith
[21:51] is is is losing its grip on that promise
[21:55] just reach your other hand up and grab
[21:58] hold of that promise even more it's so

[27:48] [Music]
[28:34] you
[29:19] plays over praising god bless you sister
[29:23] Tina
[29:24] here's I everything
[29:35] raise little Josue will you make your
[29:38] way up you amen Holly move my mama
[29:47] [Music]
[29:56] Wow amen to that
[30:01] god bless she sings love the Lord I have
[30:10] a brief testimony to give you guys but
[30:13] actually my testimony is a little
[30:15] different because usually you have a
[30:17] testimony and you want to just say
[30:21] something that you wanted or something
[30:24] that God did for you and like the whole
[30:26] from the beginning to the end I don't
[30:29] have the end but to me that in between
[30:32] it's been bigger than I think cotton
[30:35] when I get today to that you know and I
[30:40] yesterday I was during the day and
[30:42] something told me Cole brother Jack and
[30:44] tell him that you have a testimony and I
[30:47] didn't have like really because the
[30:49] devil's been trying to keep me quiet and
[30:53] I've seen how a lot of you have been
[30:56] giving your testimonies what God has
[30:59] been doing with jobs and and things and
[31:01] the other day we were at the boy in
[31:03] church and the sister just went up there
[31:05] and she just told how the what she was
[31:07] deciding in her heart God just gave her
[31:09] one two three everything in sake how she
[31:11] she wanted so God put that in my heart
[31:15] oh brother Jack I said brother Jack I
[31:17] have a testimonial I really did him but
[31:19] I do you know so basically there's a
[31:24] couple scriptures that I kind of just
[31:26] came across and they've been holding on
[31:29] to and somewhat more pretty familiar and
[31:31] one of them is seek the kingdom of God
[31:34] first and his righteousness and all the
[31:39] things will be added on today well
[31:40] that's that that falls in really really
[31:42] strong with me
[31:44] I mean many of you I don't know some of
[31:46] you know and some of you don't but I no
[31:48] longer work at the restaurant as a pizza
[31:51] maker because my profession I'm a horse
[31:53] shoe fairy I shoe horses I put shoes on
[31:55] the horses and that's what I went to
[31:57] school for that's what I did for 10
[31:59] years and life took me another way and I
[32:01] was doing something else well God gave
[32:04] me a promise that he said you that's
[32:07] what you do that's what I made you to do
[32:09] and you're gonna do that and he's been
[32:10] making a way there's so many things that
[32:13] he been happening that it's just been
[32:17] precise like the timing how one thing
[32:19] ends and another stars but basically
[32:25] it's been not easy it's been really
[32:28] really hard and a lot of times I see how
[32:31] things go a little bit couple steps
[32:34] forward and then 10 steps back and
[32:38] that's just like in the natural because
[32:40] spiritually I've been standing so so
[32:43] strong and another thing is like the way
[32:46] I've been approaching it is I think that
[32:48] when God gives us a divine promise we
[32:51] need to concentrate warn him then
[32:56] actually what is it that he's gonna give
[32:58] you because sometimes maybe the every
[33:01] soul is just what he promised you but he
[33:05] has some work to do with you through the
[33:08] process and that builds us and then it
[33:10] just kind of just confers to this gives
[33:12] him lets him know the confidence that he
[33:14] can have in us you know and and you have
[33:18] to delight in that this is the psalm 37
[33:21] it says delight in the that delight in
[33:24] the in the Lord and he shall give you
[33:27] the desires of your heart and it says
[33:29] commit thyself unto the Lord and on
[33:32] trust
[33:34] also trust in him so I've been holding
[33:36] on to some of those Christians and
[33:38] basically there's there's been a way the
[33:42] open many ways have been opening in in
[33:44] and
[33:46] and I've been kind of getting in there
[33:47] I'm over it I've been I spent so much
[33:52] money building what I need to be able to
[33:55] do that thousands and thousands and
[33:56] thousands of dollar have a trailer that
[33:58] I built and I've been putting so much
[34:00] money on it and I don't I don't really
[34:02] see none of that money coming back and
[34:04] I've been just like really really calm
[34:08] about it like sometimes it's been about
[34:11] almost two years and and I don't see
[34:14] like the actual result but I'm holding
[34:19] on to what God has told me and basically
[34:24] I just been praying and and I can stay
[34:29] right here and tell you guys and break
[34:30] everything down for hours but I just
[34:32] want to make one point is that through
[34:34] the the journey that God gives you
[34:37] always just be faithful to him and he'll
[34:40] give you the patience to withstand
[34:41] whatever it is and I just ask God and I
[34:46] said god I know that you're gonna bring
[34:48] me through I haven't even worried about
[34:50] it even the person that I that I
[34:52] actually work with he's just always like
[34:55] you just so calm about it you know and
[34:57] he's been trying and we've been trying
[34:59] to get into some places and stuff and it
[35:01] just really doesn't happen I just keep
[35:02] telling him you know what is God has a
[35:05] guy is a perfect time he has perfect
[35:08] time and if it's not right now then
[35:11] he'll open another door and I've been
[35:12] kind of sticking with that but I just I
[35:14] was praying and I just want to let you
[35:16] guys know that God will give you the
[35:18] desires of your heart and sometimes are
[35:21] what we are at least for me sometimes
[35:24] what I ask God is so simple and so
[35:26] little even like when I was explaining
[35:28] to my coworker what I what I asked for
[35:30] Houston a meal a really and that that
[35:34] feels you but I said God I know that
[35:38] you're what you promised I know where
[35:41] I'm gonna be yeah and I don't know when
[35:43] that's gonna happen but I just want a
[35:46] little taste like I just let me just see
[35:49] what it's gonna be like and and this is
[35:52] not I truly believe and I'm in my heart
[35:55] that it's not like I was
[35:57] outing what he's gonna do just I just
[35:59] wanted that Lord let me see a little bit
[36:02] you know so I just been kind of praying
[36:04] that in my heart and he did just that
[36:06] he did like something's open up and some
[36:12] days that I've been getting up on my own
[36:13] and people have been calling me and
[36:16] customers been coming along and I've
[36:18] been having some days where I got up in
[36:20] the morning and I don't have to go work
[36:24] with somebody or help somebody that I've
[36:26] actually been making my own schedule and
[36:28] waking up and going to my certain
[36:30] clientele and be able to make a choice
[36:32] and be like you don't have to go here
[36:34] but you know what I have to do this for
[36:35] like kind of that freedom that's what
[36:37] God gave me he said you're gonna have
[36:39] your business you're gonna have the kind
[36:41] of things that you want and you're gonna
[36:43] be able to make up your own schedule so
[36:45] that way you can my my
[36:46] my thing is I like to be available for
[36:49] others I like to be able to help others
[36:52] and the brothers have been calling me to
[36:55] when they need and I have not been able
[36:57] to like actually be there and when I do
[37:00] I have to actually drop some of mine
[37:02] things my family and things so I should
[37:05] be doing that I actually been doing it
[37:07] but God gave me a little bit a little
[37:10] taste like that so basically like I just
[37:14] want to tell you guys that when you are
[37:17] trying to reach somewhere don't
[37:19] concentrate so much on what God is gonna
[37:22] take you what he's gonna do is for you
[37:23] but enjoy the the way because it says
[37:27] they live in my waist and if his ways
[37:29] are what he's making you go through
[37:32] because the scripture says the footsteps
[37:35] of the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[37:37] so if he's ordering all those steps
[37:39] delight and enjoy the the journey that
[37:43] God is giving you and when you get there
[37:45] then you rejoice about that but you
[37:47] don't have to wait to get that thing to
[37:49] actually have some joy and to actually
[37:51] enjoy you can enjoy the whole way there
[37:54] and it's not and like brother Jack said
[37:56] yesterday he was like we're kings and
[37:59] priests so the king you never see when
[38:03] the king is going through something
[38:04] the king is always standing up hi Sally
[38:08] and he might be
[38:09] so many things but you always see the
[38:10] king when he's going in in that car he's
[38:12] going through the thing whatever he's
[38:13] going through you don't see because he's
[38:15] standing like that and he's just waving
[38:16] so that's how we gotta be it
[38:18] yeah we're gonna be feeling down yeah
[38:20] but just always keep your head up and
[38:22] enjoy and accept what God is doing for
[38:24] you whether you like it or not if you
[38:27] believe the scripture and the scripture
[38:29] says they the footsteps of the righteous
[38:31] are ordered by him then he's ordering
[38:33] that and you gotta accept that and
[38:34] that's all I want to say and God bless
[38:36] you know what I'm actually feeling so
[38:40] good right now
[38:40] and I see I'm not saying God can do
[38:52] anything anything
[39:00] anything
[39:01] my god can do anything yesterday and the
[39:13] day before the same I hear
[40:20] do you believe that

[1:04:30] try to remember a ma'am I'm stuck my
[1:04:34] hair but a couple of things that I need
[1:04:36] to just make mention of real quickly
[1:04:40] this is first Sunday so I always try to
[1:04:43] give you all a quick update
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:55] praise the Lord
[1:04:56] just since its first time I want to give
[1:04:59] you all a quick update on our Building
[1:05:03] Fund project and had all my all my notes
[1:05:07] and numbers not a lot of misplaced it so
[1:05:09] just hit that light switch for me real
[1:05:11] quick just I know if I'm not mistaken
[1:05:18] last last month there was a roughly a
[1:05:22] little over four thousand dollars that
[1:05:25] was received a man not building fund I
[1:05:27] want to thank God for them we have our
[1:05:30] goal of a hundred and five thousand for
[1:05:32] this year we have pledges a man forty
[1:05:36] seven thousand three hundred twenty five
[1:05:38] and near to date and man we have
[1:05:41] received
[1:05:42] 13400 $13.73 give God praise for that
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:50] and
[1:05:54] the remember early in the year talk to
[1:05:57] y'all about a transfer that we did a
[1:05:59] four hundred dollars to pay our expenses
[1:06:02] amen and so I left here today this

[1:06:24] joining us in men on this journey also
[1:06:26] we talked about at that meeting about
[1:06:30] offering a man and how I think 35 people
[1:06:34] given $33 a man a week would allow us to
[1:06:39] take care of our Spitzer's and we'll
[1:06:41] never see that transfer happen again if
[1:06:44] we all do that a man and that's that's
[1:06:46] what we were aiming for as well as we
[1:06:50] were in Fame and for putting some of the
[1:06:51] money back that we took out last year so

[1:12:49] that

[1:12:52] Israel is a land that it will always be
[1:12:56] people always coming against it you know
[1:12:58] people just don't like the Israelites
[1:13:00] right it has always been that way the
[1:13:03] Philistines could not stop coming
[1:13:05] against them but every time they come
[1:13:07] against the weather god dude defeat them
[1:13:09] Philistines right so we got different
[1:13:12] Phyllis tiles to date right but God
[1:13:15] still takes care of that land there's
[1:13:17] too much prophecy that must be fulfilled
[1:13:19] in that land for anything to happen you
[1:13:22] understand man so your summer safely is

[1:13:34] just forget me just to solicit your
[1:13:35] prayers a man for us as we as we travel
[1:13:38] I know there is one other announcement
[1:13:41] that I need to make but I'd rather make
[1:13:43] that at the end of the service and and
[1:13:47] there's something else I think I have
[1:13:49] but I don't I don't know it that's why I
[1:13:52] write things down so I'll write them
[1:13:56] down but I have no idea what happened
[1:13:59] but God is good they already announced
[1:14:02] that right okay yeah I don't want to you
[1:14:07] know
[1:14:09] yeah yeah yeah okay they said my it is
[1:14:14] my daughter's birthday and I'm very
[1:14:16] happy
[1:14:17] amen God has given another year but you
[1:14:21] understand sister Michelle I just you
[1:14:24] know I know niche already narrows I saw
[1:14:26] one go you know I'm just gonna go to
[1:14:28] protocol right
[1:14:30] hey man see this right doggy your wife
[1:14:37] you see that she knew exactly weather
[1:14:40] good look law right thank you
[1:14:48] and you know everything I had on here I
[1:14:50] melt boy god is good one thing one thing
[1:14:57] I miss one thing this would be so thank
[1:15:04] God for the acquire the fire
[1:15:06] amen tent meetings we I'm still still
[1:15:09] blessed by that and we I'm sorry light
[1:15:13] the fire light the fire but uh but uh
[1:15:16] we're it was in my heart as we were just
[1:15:20] praying praying about this the brothers
[1:15:22] were all in the room praying a man and
[1:15:25] and you know about I told them what was
[1:15:28] my desire and brother Stephen said but
[1:15:30] we need a date just give us a date they
[1:15:32] say okay and right put me on the spot so
[1:15:35] we put a date down and everybody start
[1:15:37] working towards it and it was very
[1:15:38] successful
[1:15:39] and you know after that we felt to try
[1:15:43] to just continue our efforts there in
[1:15:46] Okeechobee rather than moving at in
[1:15:48] around all over the place let's try to
[1:15:49] continue what we've done there so we
[1:15:51] want to try to in my heart i was like
[1:15:53] lord if we can get the ten of three
[1:15:55] times this year that would be a blessing
[1:15:56] and so we were looking at another date
[1:15:59] here in the near future and as i was
[1:16:02] been talking about it with different
[1:16:03] people in the idea came up a man to do a
[1:16:06] back-to-school outreach
[1:16:08] all right where we would provide you
[1:16:11] know backpacks and school supplies and
[1:16:13] things like that to so many kids in that
[1:16:16] area but we would not only just do the
[1:16:18] baggage through outreach but we'll put
[1:16:20] maybe the tent around the outreach right
[1:16:22] so we'll invite on the service again and
[1:16:24] invite him for some hotdogs and then
[1:16:26] fighting for some school supplies and we
[1:16:28] just gonna do all we can to try to
[1:16:29] coverage right so the date that we're
[1:16:32] looking at is August 11th I think 10th
[1:16:34] to the 11th somewhere around there and I
[1:16:36] just want to kind of get that out before
[1:16:38] working towards that as we get back and
[1:16:41] while we were there the tent brothers
[1:16:43] steamin also mentioned about bringing
[1:16:45] the tent over to Sarasota so busting my
[1:16:48] heart is possibly doing that had
[1:16:50] November and Sarasota doing that in
[1:16:52] November so we'll try if we don't get
[1:16:54] the tent up pay man and August will
[1:16:58] still have some services out there in
[1:17:00] Okeechobee but it would be nice and we
[1:17:02] would do to ten and you know the
[1:17:05] gentleman that came and helped with the
[1:17:07] Bible's he was so blown away by sister
[1:17:10] Tonya's testimony that he say this got
[1:17:12] to be told everywhere
[1:17:13] it's got to be told of we got to take
[1:17:15] the ten everywhere I say where brother
[1:17:16] kill you all dance you know but he told
[1:17:19] me he called me up and I said oh he said
[1:17:21] I'd be willing to help fund yeah
[1:17:29] so I say well praise the Lord you know
[1:17:32] and so with them having a desire to want
[1:17:34] to do that then we're going to try to do
[1:17:36] all we can to keep things moving in that
[1:17:37] direction so the next the next date that
[1:17:40] we're looking at doing something is
[1:17:41] August 10th and 11th so keep that in
[1:17:43] mind
[1:17:44] I believe that start let's see the
[1:17:45] August 10th 11th August 11th and 12th
[1:17:47] something like that right foot 10 to the
[1:17:49] 11th okay
[1:17:50] Friday and Saturday so keep that in mind
[1:17:52] we'll give him more details as we
[1:17:54] approach them and man so praise the Lord
[1:17:57] god bless you and think that's all that
[1:17:59] I need to mention musicians think I so
[1:18:01] much appreciate you all got richly bless
[1:18:04] you we got the best musicians and the
[1:18:06] message we got the best song label and
[1:18:10] the message we got the best chair in an
[1:18:15] essence praise the Lord

[1:20:58] church say Amen
[1:20:59] all right y'all stand with now I want to
[1:21:02] read a scripture here on this morning
[1:21:06] and my thoughts are kind of jumbled at
[1:21:12] least that's the way I feel but I know
[1:21:14] sometimes God allows you to get into a
[1:21:16] state like this so he can speak and then
[1:21:19] I was I think brother Homer Brown told
[1:21:24] brother Danny's demon turn with me to
[1:21:27] Psalm 63 he told brother Dan this demon
[1:21:30] he says when you get up there and you
[1:21:32] preach and you actually feel like man I
[1:21:36] really did a good job with that sermon
[1:21:39] they say then God didn't speak it says
[1:21:43] but when you get up there feel like I
[1:21:46] don't know what I did I don't messed all
[1:21:48] this up so that's when God spoke so we
[1:21:53] want God to speak today hey man
[1:21:56] Psalm 63 I want to just read here and I
[1:22:01] did like I said I don't figure don't
[1:22:02] don't let me forget up doing have
[1:22:04] something else anything else to you but
[1:22:05] after I mean after the sermon and man
[1:22:08] will do that hopefully I won't forget
[1:22:10] but Psalm 63 let's let's read this a man
[1:22:13] says O God thou art my god only will I
[1:22:19] seek thee my soul thirsteth of a V my
[1:22:24] flesh longeth for thee and a dry and
[1:22:27] thirsty land when the water is
[1:22:31] to see that power and that glory so as I
[1:22:35] have seen thee in the sanctuary because
[1:22:38] I loving-kindness is better than life my
[1:22:40] lips shall praise thee thus will I bless
[1:22:44] thee Wow I live I will lift up my hands
[1:22:49] in thy name my soul shall be satisfied
[1:22:53] as with marrow and fatness and my mouth
[1:22:57] shall praise thee with joyful lips when
[1:23:01] I remember the upon my bed and meditate
[1:23:03] on the in the night watches because thou
[1:23:05] has been my help therefore the shadow
[1:23:08] that Wings will I rejoice my soul
[1:23:11] followeth hard after thee thy right hand
[1:23:17] upholdeth me but those that seek my soul
[1:23:21] to destroy it shall go into the lower
[1:23:24] parts of the earth they shall fall by
[1:23:27] the smooth they shall be a portion for
[1:23:29] foxes but the king a man last night we
[1:23:34] found out that we were Kings amen but
[1:23:37] the Kings shall rejoice in God and
[1:23:39] everyone that swears by him shall glory
[1:23:42] but the mouths of them that speak lies
[1:23:45] shall be stopped a man the Lord and a
[1:23:50] blessing to the reading of his word
[1:23:52] let's just bow in a word of Prayer
[1:23:54] there God we are trusting that you would
[1:24:00] take control over our thought today may
[1:24:05] the Holy Spirit God speak to every heart
[1:24:08] to every knee to every person get glory
[1:24:11] and honor out of our gathering here
[1:24:14] today we trust that the Spirit of God
[1:24:17] would be pleased with all things thank
[1:24:19] you for everything that has happened
[1:24:20] thus far in this service and I've God we
[1:24:22] we just we just want you
[1:24:25] amen to have your way even now some
[1:24:28] Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be
[1:24:31] seated
[1:24:34] a man sold David writes these words here
[1:24:41] in Psalm 63 and he and he talked about
[1:24:44] and verse 5 says my show my soul shall
[1:24:47] be satisfied as with marrow and fatness
[1:24:50] a man and and as far as his soul being
[1:24:53] satisfied
[1:24:54] it was first thirsty a man and longing
[1:25:01] for God say manage says my soul
[1:25:05] thirsteth eat my flesh long with a V and
[1:25:08] a drive verse Atlanta when the water is
[1:25:11] and David comes you know later on he
[1:25:13] tells us that his soul was satisfied
[1:25:16] right after after finding God and I just
[1:25:19] wanted to take for our topic today
[1:25:22] satisfaction guaranteed a man
[1:25:26] satisfaction guaranteed and and and and
[1:25:30] and just to make it clear there is no
[1:25:33] satisfaction outside of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:38] you will never be satisfied you'll never
[1:25:42] have enough amen until you can come in
[1:25:45] and enter a relationship personal
[1:25:47] relationship with him and and you know
[1:25:50] as I you notice there's many thoughts
[1:25:52] that kind of go through my head as we as
[1:25:54] we approach this and I'll just you know
[1:25:56] how we'll just go out and Lourdes leaves
[1:25:58] us but there was a man Jesus had a time
[1:26:04] in his ministry where he went to Samaria
[1:26:07] and the Bible tells us that he had me to
[1:26:10] go by Samaria and and the way that he
[1:26:13] was going the the true destination where
[1:26:15] he was trying to go this was not a
[1:26:17] shortcut
[1:26:18] this was actually taking him out the way
[1:26:20] a man to get to where he was going
[1:26:23] amen and actually when it added more
[1:26:26] miles if I could put it that way it
[1:26:29] added more
[1:26:33] if I could use these words and all of
[1:26:36] you put more stress to the situation
[1:26:39] oftentimes when we look at that on a
[1:26:42] John fuller a man there there are things
[1:26:44] a man that that occur in our life that
[1:26:50] you know sometimes God might have to go
[1:26:52] a particular direction in order to get
[1:26:54] your attention a man sometimes they
[1:26:56] might have the ministry go in a
[1:26:58] particular direction just to give you
[1:27:00] attention we could we could have a
[1:27:02] particular destination this is what
[1:27:04] we're trying to get to but we're going
[1:27:06] to have to have to stop and have me to
[1:27:08] go by a particular way in order to pick
[1:27:11] this person up along the road a man I
[1:27:13] hope you with me and I want you to
[1:27:16] notice that when Jesus said he had me
[1:27:18] and told her disciples that need to go
[1:27:20] by Samaria and Jesus mine he knew in
[1:27:24] Samaria that be one woman a man that he
[1:27:27] would have a conversation with at the
[1:27:30] you know at the at the well and you know
[1:27:33] he began to you know just kind of talk
[1:27:35] with her and we'll we'll read a little
[1:27:38] bit of this amen out of junk food he
[1:27:40] began to talk with her and you know just
[1:27:44] kind of breaking some things down and
[1:27:46] just kind of filling her spirit and all
[1:27:48] of that and as he began to talk with her
[1:27:50] there's a statement that he made that I
[1:27:54] want to just read to you here out of
[1:27:55] John fuller verse verse 12 is that not
[1:28:01] 13 13 because he asked the lady for a
[1:28:04] drink of water when he got there and you
[1:28:06] know and and she was uh you know she
[1:28:08] just began to talk about water water
[1:28:10] representing life and things that need
[1:28:11] to should we going to talk about it and
[1:28:13] and he began to kind of tell her some
[1:28:15] things about you know if you know if you
[1:28:18] knew the gift of God and who you were
[1:28:20] talking to you say even had Smith the
[1:28:22] water right you would ask me the words
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:24] he'll she like that now you ain't even
[1:28:26] got nothing wrong with how you how you
[1:28:28] gonna get water out the will so he
[1:28:30] answers the question here and away a man
[1:28:33] that I want us to just kind of see here
[1:28:35] verse 13 says jesus answered and said in
[1:28:39] the home who's trying to drinketh of
[1:28:41] this water
[1:28:42] so thirst again and when we will meet
[1:28:45] when I want us to look at that statement
[1:28:47] this water my god because water
[1:28:50] represents life and their water
[1:28:53] represents life and all of you to live
[1:28:56] if you gonna need some water right
[1:28:58] you're going to need some water but also
[1:28:59] I'm going to understand that I want to
[1:29:01] kind of catch this from a different
[1:29:02] angle today you know if some people if
[1:29:06] they water is their career right is some
[1:29:11] people their water is their profession
[1:29:13] and that is so people their water is
[1:29:16] their family their life is bound up in
[1:29:19] those things I want you to realize that
[1:29:24] if your life is Belva and natural things
[1:29:26] you will never find satisfaction in that
[1:29:30] hey maybe you only gonna find
[1:29:32] satisfaction in Christ glory to God
[1:29:37] right so he goes on to make another
[1:29:39] statement here a man in verse 14 says
[1:29:42] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:29:45] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:29:48] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:29:50] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:29:53] everlasting life so again he he only
[1:29:56] Christ can satisfy the truth thirst
[1:29:58] now I want us to go in their favor here
[1:30:00] a man in this in this thought glory to
[1:30:03] God and I was looking at this woman
[1:30:06] right why why would Jesus have need to
[1:30:09] go by Samaria and talk to this woman
[1:30:11] well I want me to do that you know
[1:30:13] because it's just kind of here and say
[1:30:15] the reason that he will talk with this
[1:30:17] one woman and sometime the reason why
[1:30:19] God had changed amen that the service
[1:30:22] again
[1:30:22] person because this one woman had the
[1:30:25] ability to turn a whole city upside down
[1:30:30] her testimony to change many people my
[1:30:35] God my god and you wanna make my god
[1:30:39] came up to you because your testimony
[1:30:43] can turn a whole city upside down that's
[1:30:48] why he came after you right that's why
[1:30:50] that's why you had need to get a world
[1:30:53] by rectly to you and then the seasoning
[1:30:55] man he has he asked me to get his word
[1:30:57] to certain people just to kind of get
[1:31:00] them on the right track and I want I
[1:31:02] want us to just kind of catch this here
[1:31:04] today I want to read a little quote out
[1:31:06] of God's provided a postive up to divine
[1:31:08] fellowship glory to God just bear with
[1:31:10] me today a man a man he had purposely
[1:31:14] had a need for going in that direction
[1:31:16] glory to God we're trying to find
[1:31:18] satisfaction a lot of things you know
[1:31:20] amen some found it in careers some find
[1:31:23] their satisfaction and in their
[1:31:26] profession some find their satisfaction
[1:31:28] in their families some fondant and
[1:31:31] relationships that but but i'ma tell you
[1:31:33] none of those things provide true
[1:31:35] satisfaction your satisfaction can only
[1:31:38] be found in Christ amen
[1:31:41] look at this there's a list fake that
[1:31:42] that's been made here little testifier
[1:31:44] and poppers given says today on the
[1:31:46] plane this is coming from Louisville
[1:31:48] down here taking me two and a half hours
[1:31:51] of flying and take me all day to make it
[1:31:53] delayed flames and maybe God had a hand
[1:31:56] in it
[1:31:57] now now you know we see stuff go on my
[1:31:59] life we think the devil the devil the
[1:32:01] devil no maybe God had a hand in it
[1:32:03] hey man it ain't always the devil fault
[1:32:05] God our God orchestrating things putting
[1:32:08] you and a place to talk to somebody hey
[1:32:10] Ben serenity it frustrated and and and
[1:32:13] flustered and all that once you start
[1:32:15] praying God why you delete me why do I
[1:32:18] have this flat tire Lord you know who is
[1:32:20] it that you want me to talk to God Amen
[1:32:23] right this is the way we should approach
[1:32:24] that he says it's that taking me two and
[1:32:26] a half thousand flying and take me all
[1:32:28] day to make it delete planes and maybe
[1:32:30] God had a hand in when I got owned
[1:32:33] Louisville there was a young lady got on
[1:32:35] the plane sat down by me she said do you
[1:32:38] mind if I sit here
[1:32:39] I said not at all and as we went home
[1:32:42] they were serving lunch on the plane and
[1:32:45] I prayed and she said are you a medicine
[1:32:48] I said yes ma'am I am
[1:32:50] and she said I'm a believer too and she
[1:32:54] told me of her a certain denomination I
[1:32:55] said that's nice and I noticed we had a
[1:32:58] little package of cigarettes on the
[1:33:00] plane and I watched to see what she
[1:33:03] would do about it
[1:33:04] so as soon as the dinner was over she
[1:33:06] began undoing that package of cigarettes
[1:33:08] and she fumbled run a little bit and she
[1:33:12] stuck it towards the mouth and she took
[1:33:15] it down again and after a while she
[1:33:17] living up she said you don't mind if I
[1:33:20] smoke I said you don't mind if I tell
[1:33:23] you I do I said I do because she said
[1:33:28] why I said I can't understand why nice
[1:33:32] little lady with a personality that you
[1:33:34] got would have to do a thing like that
[1:33:36] she said oh I get satisfaction out of it
[1:33:41] and I said that's only substitutionary
[1:33:44] satisfaction if you would just take what
[1:33:47] I tell you and we'll turn your life
[1:33:49] completely to God and then then then I
[1:33:53] mean there's something that you're
[1:33:54] missing and you're trying to make
[1:33:56] cigarettes fill up that logo that's in
[1:33:59] your heart give you a first satisfaction
[1:34:02] oh my see so what's in this in that case
[1:34:05] is a cigarette given her false
[1:34:07] satisfaction and so people is big career
[1:34:10] full satisfaction based a profession
[1:34:13] first satisfaction their family first
[1:34:16] satisfaction you can either find
[1:34:18] satisfaction when you surrender
[1:34:20] completely to God
[1:34:21] listen they give you a full satisfaction
[1:34:24] with I mean which will soon give you a
[1:34:27] cancer under Granger body and you'll be
[1:34:30] going and I said God made a person the
[1:34:32] first the first after him and then if
[1:34:35] they do not
[1:34:35] except that then the debtor gives them a
[1:34:37] false conception of pleasure and they
[1:34:40] try to satisfy with the things on the
[1:34:42] world she made about two little drawings
[1:34:44] in a cigarette and she said I'm 22 years
[1:34:46] old
[1:34:47] she said my engaged boyfriend is 32 see
[1:34:50] saying he told me I've been overseas for
[1:34:53] three months he begged me to smoke no
[1:34:55] more and she said this is the first time
[1:34:58] I have smoked missing the plane and she
[1:35:00] said sir I take this promise now and she
[1:35:04] put the cigarette out and and that was
[1:35:07] it to it right so all of the lays that
[1:35:10] brother Brandon went through it was so
[1:35:12] he can get in touch with this one look
[1:35:14] up see he don't need to go through the
[1:35:17] delays just like Jesus had need to go
[1:35:19] about some man he had need to go through
[1:35:21] this to get this one look gonna bring
[1:35:22] conviction to so she can stop smoking
[1:35:24] she was trying to find satisfaction in
[1:35:27] the cigarette now you know what she's
[1:35:30] not the only one to do that there's many
[1:35:32] of people today that try to find
[1:35:34] satisfaction and everything else except
[1:35:37] Christ and I'm here to tell you you will
[1:35:39] never find it I don't care how long you
[1:35:42] go in life you will realize one thing
[1:35:44] you cannot find satisfaction outside of
[1:35:47] Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:35:50] temporary happiness right smoking
[1:35:53] cigarettes would produce a temporary
[1:35:55] satisfaction to come was nerves right
[1:35:58] and as a promise a evinces that you keep
[1:36:01] smoking cigarettes is going to create
[1:36:02] cancer you're gonna end up down an ugly
[1:36:04] death right healthy can be an addictive
[1:36:07] as well just buy cigarettes and and
[1:36:09] coffee can produce a temporary
[1:36:12] satisfaction right a lot of people find
[1:36:15] satisfaction ago from Party to party to
[1:36:18] party let me tell you something you came
[1:36:20] party forever
[1:36:21] all right at some point in the party
[1:36:24] comes to an end and then you're good
[1:36:28] feelings will come to an end and then go
[1:36:30] hi are your hangover
[1:36:33] amen and to feed it you must seek
[1:36:37] another party I've never hire another
[1:36:39] tree but because that is temporary
[1:36:41] satisfaction and I was kind of hit this
[1:36:45] today money does not provide complete
[1:36:50] satisfaction they all do it America you
[1:36:55] know that's why we changed careers
[1:36:56] that's why we change somebody says money
[1:36:59] is not going to give you complete
[1:37:00] satisfaction and you don't believe me
[1:37:03] that's extra Cholula money will not only
[1:37:09] Jesus Christ can do that if you drink of
[1:37:13] this water you'll never thirst thirst
[1:37:15] again if the water that Jesus provides
[1:37:18] Jesus Christ a loaf of us satisfaction
[1:37:22] guaranteed let me a girl to a cool down
[1:37:25] this message life amen the Prophet tells
[1:37:28] us this is just now but God in this
[1:37:31] great economy for mankind has made man
[1:37:35] in the way that he wanted man to be now
[1:37:37] a made man to thirst
[1:37:39] did you notice David said here my soul
[1:37:41] thirsteth for thee oh I love that as in
[1:37:45] a dry land where there's no water just
[1:37:47] imagine that my soul is so thirsty god
[1:37:51] I'm thirsty for you just like I was in a
[1:37:53] land where there was no water he must
[1:37:55] find water or perish my soul is
[1:37:58] thirsting for thee amen
[1:38:01] and I'm gonna tell you if I think we all
[1:38:04] that's when we will get something from
[1:38:06] God when we get to the point where our
[1:38:08] soul is actually longing for him put
[1:38:10] that there put that down for just a
[1:38:12] second you know David writes in another
[1:38:15] another passage I believe is on psalm 42
[1:38:18] he talks about how the deer a man thirst
[1:38:21] if the longer for the water Brooks right
[1:38:23] he longer for now the reason that the
[1:38:26] deer is longing for water is the deer
[1:38:29] it's actually being hunted and as he's
[1:38:31] being hunted a man he get struck maybe
[1:38:34] in his hindquarters and
[1:38:36] and maybe they get they turn a little
[1:38:39] dog elusive him and that duck slaps him
[1:38:42] and strikes a man and now he's bleeding
[1:38:44] and that deer realizes he has an
[1:38:46] instinct he has something on the inside
[1:38:48] that tells him that if I do not get to
[1:38:51] water that I'm gonna die right here so
[1:38:54] that they're beginning alone they may
[1:38:56] have for water and what's what you'll
[1:38:58] see the dealer
[1:38:59] stick up his nose that start sniffing
[1:39:01] and when he snaps he trying to find
[1:39:03] where's the closest book and indeed gets
[1:39:06] to the water that don't you forget about
[1:39:09] honey and what we try to do is get
[1:39:12] people to the world let a man sustain it
[1:39:16] might get them to the whooping a trick
[1:39:18] that the devil will not baby do does it
[1:39:21] again sir so you don't thought what when
[1:39:24] we leave here that ever going to be
[1:39:26] striking at us he gonna be doing this
[1:39:28] she going to be doing that but then we
[1:39:29] got all kind of tricks up this up his
[1:39:31] sleeve and let me tell you something you
[1:39:34] cannot outsmart the devil you can't do
[1:39:37] it I don't care how long you've been
[1:39:38] around how long you been the message you
[1:39:40] can outsmart the devil he got something
[1:39:42] for you
[1:39:43] amen so you know here the thing of it is
[1:39:45] we're trying to get people get to the
[1:39:47] water to drink only Christ can provide
[1:39:49] that for you only Christ can give you
[1:39:50] that type of satisfaction let's go a
[1:39:52] little further here in this cool
[1:39:53] he says he says God my soul especially
[1:39:57] now say now God made a man with her
[1:39:59] first that's a part of a human being is
[1:40:01] his thirst but God made him a man the
[1:40:04] thirst is a man of thirst foot to thirst
[1:40:06] for God and the devil has perverted it
[1:40:09] and make it thirst for his kingdom for
[1:40:11] the world do you get it the first and
[1:40:13] man is godly for God made the man the
[1:40:16] first first for God and how dare some of
[1:40:19] you would be so little as to try to quit
[1:40:23] that blessed thing of first by trying to
[1:40:26] satisfy that with drinking and smoking
[1:40:28] and television and running and carrying
[1:40:32] on and reveling around trying to satisfy
[1:40:34] that God the thing that God putting you
[1:40:36] to first for him you are polluting the
[1:40:38] fountain that God has placed in you to
[1:40:40] receive your spirit and your it's
[1:40:41] running it with the things of the world
[1:40:43] and
[1:40:44] do not satisfy they never will satisfy
[1:40:46] and so that's the reason you put a
[1:40:49] pistol to your brains to blow them out
[1:40:51] is because that things go the way they
[1:40:54] do and the words on a great suicide on a
[1:40:56] perversion and homosexual and the crime
[1:40:59] that's in the land the way it is because
[1:41:01] you're perverting the very thing that
[1:41:03] God gave you and trying to satisfy it
[1:41:05] with the evil of the world take that
[1:41:07] blast Holy Spirit of God waste the first
[1:41:10] thing your soul to come for come for and
[1:41:12] you satisfied with the nightclub
[1:41:13] somewhere no wonder you got a headache
[1:41:16] the next morning then you take a case of
[1:41:18] beer and you go to the house and sit
[1:41:19] down and drink it trying to satisfy that
[1:41:22] God offense that God putting in your
[1:41:23] soul to thirst after him and take the
[1:41:25] devil's lot and try to satisfy the first
[1:41:28] SEC guy put of you is in you to thirst
[1:41:31] after him how did you receive anything
[1:41:33] but eternal separation from the presence
[1:41:34] of Almighty God when he made you to
[1:41:36] thirst after him David surrendered
[1:41:39] himself or sent my soul is thirsting
[1:41:41] like I was in a dry land where those but
[1:41:44] where there's the water I first reveal
[1:41:46] God there you are David said I seen the
[1:41:49] indistinct wearing and my soul first
[1:41:51] without but for that power well there
[1:41:54] you are that's the difference and it
[1:41:56] goes on to make this other statement
[1:41:58] that's what makes things different is
[1:42:00] the thirst that God give you if you
[1:42:03] satisfy it with with with the water come
[1:42:06] up to me only that's first you come and
[1:42:07] drink from the thousands of life freely
[1:42:09] without money without price there's a
[1:42:11] fountain open in the house of God the
[1:42:13] City of David
[1:42:13] there's the fountain let your thirst
[1:42:15] before certainly it is don't try to
[1:42:17] prevent it by trying to say I'm
[1:42:18] satisfied by drinking I'm satisfied by
[1:42:21] having a date with this girl I'll slip
[1:42:23] out a little on my husband and I'll go
[1:42:25] out a little oh my wife
[1:42:26] you're only heaping judgment you say I'm
[1:42:29] not satisfied brother branham no wonder
[1:42:31] there's God dealing with you God trying
[1:42:34] to bring you to something and you take
[1:42:35] the devil suggestion and go up with it
[1:42:38] and that's the way style comes
[1:42:40] that's how there comes that and that
[1:42:43] light is not life oh I like that
[1:42:47] statement that life is not life
[1:42:52] but the wages of sin is death but the
[1:42:54] gift of God is eternal life amen to them
[1:42:57] that will receive it now you know when
[1:43:00] we when we look at this I'm reminded of
[1:43:03] just a statement that the Prophet made

[1:46:19] if your family decide to do something
[1:46:21] different then it don't affect you I'm
[1:46:25] still gonna do what I'm doing because my
[1:46:28] satisfaction is in Christ now y'all can
[1:46:31] come with me or not but I ain't changing
[1:46:36] see it's a personal relationship
[1:46:42] it's what God has done for me I know
[1:46:44] where I came from I know where God
[1:46:47] brought me from so ain't no sense in
[1:46:49] trying to do anything else with me I'm
[1:46:52] just you know they they have some needs
[1:46:53] to say I'm locked up tied up tangled up
[1:46:56] in this praise the Lord
[1:46:59] and if since I'm locked up tied up
[1:47:01] hanging up don't try to take my bad side
[1:47:03] I like it this way glory to God women
[1:47:12] money popularity that's what get a
[1:47:15] minister now now now now so if we just
[1:47:18] when you say a minister it would be
[1:47:20] women moment money in popularity now
[1:47:22] when we take it as as a whole for the
[1:47:24] church it's not just women right it's
[1:47:27] relationships that use a man for a
[1:47:32] sister never use a man against you right
[1:47:35] for a man I hear use a woman against a
[1:47:37] man but a woman here use a man against
[1:47:39] the woman right and you gotta watch that
[1:47:41] because that's a trick of the enemy and
[1:47:44] you will not find satisfaction in that
[1:47:46] relationship your relationship I mean
[1:47:49] your relationship with Christ is the
[1:47:50] only place you're gonna find
[1:47:51] satisfaction now let's just look at this

[1:48:23] great sum of money many of you heard
[1:48:25] about it was given to me and I refused
[1:48:27] to look at I want we got a stopping
[1:48:33] process this great sum of money was
[1:48:37] given to the Prophet but he refused to
[1:48:38] look at yeah now you know we you know
[1:48:41] because we've not heard the blessing
[1:48:42] plan so much all of us looking for the
[1:48:44] great sum of money now look I'm not I'm
[1:48:46] not here to tell you that God came bless
[1:48:48] you with the money but I am here to tell
[1:48:50] you that the devil also try to beat God

[1:49:32] gonna read the rest of the singing the
[1:49:33] quotes say 1.5 million this is what was
[1:49:35] offered to the Prophet now if this was

[1:49:43] to do that I'm not talking about you
[1:49:45] know there's some things that you know
[1:49:47] like like I know and I believe it's a
[1:49:50] blessing the Johnsons are being blessed
[1:49:52] to travel and you can't get the church
[1:49:54] when you're traveling like that right I
[1:49:55] understand that I understand but I'm
[1:49:57] saying if every time something come up
[1:49:59] and you have to miss Church in order to
[1:50:02] get it and there's a this is a 1.5
[1:50:04] million deal and you know and you want
[1:50:06] to make sure you tell the pastor this is
[1:50:08] 1.5 million and pastor I'm talking I'm
[1:50:14] talking
[1:50:17] think about the church pastor I am think
[1:50:23] about the ties pastor think about the
[1:50:25] tithes in the church pastor that's
[1:50:26] that's what we want you think about I'm
[1:50:28] gonna tell you something if I sold my
[1:50:29] soul out for that type of stuff then I
[1:50:33] wouldn't be thinking about your soul and
[1:50:37] if God want us to have it he's not gonna
[1:50:39] have us compromising to get it your
[1:50:43] satisfaction has got to be found in
[1:50:45] Christ you know I just this week I was
[1:50:47] reading scripture just bless my heart I
[1:50:49] was looking at the Hebrew boys and dumb
[1:50:52] Hebrew boys you'll notice they're in and
[1:50:54] Daniel they had to take a stand that
[1:50:57] they would not bow right they wouldn't
[1:50:59] bound they wouldn't bow to the image
[1:51:02] that the king had put there before him
[1:51:03] and and and the thing that I loved about
[1:51:06] it and to come to the end of that into
[1:51:09] that chapter it said after they went
[1:51:11] through the fiery furnace after God
[1:51:13] delivered them after they took they
[1:51:15] stayed after all that if they got
[1:51:18] promoted them I said wait most people
[1:51:22] begin a promotion they compromise in
[1:51:26] order to get the money they compromise
[1:51:29] but God gave it a promotion after they
[1:51:32] still if God gave em a promotion after
[1:51:37] they stood what would God do for you
[1:51:38] after you stand be a chick-fil-a let's
[1:51:46] go and keep on reading I've just just
[1:51:48] thought it's like a warning for
[1:51:49] everybody I'm expecting blessings
[1:51:51] I'm expecting it but I'm expecting us to
[1:51:53] keep it balanced that's what I'm
[1:51:57] expecting a man that you're gonna be not
[1:51:59] not willfully missing pastor you know I
[1:52:02] would come but you know tonight or or
[1:52:05] the day that it's the only day they can
[1:52:06] do it this the only day is it the only
[1:52:11] day is that one you want to be
[1:52:14] chick-fil-a
[1:52:17] oh yeah I might as well say it since I'm
[1:52:22] here you know sometime you gonna have to
[1:52:24] say no yeah actually God gonna test you
[1:52:29] to see if you're gonna say no all right
[1:52:35] and if after you say no and you're gonna
[1:52:39] be like oh after you say no you know
[1:52:46] what God don't do and and if you if you
[1:52:48] if you don't have the wrong attitude
[1:52:52] your satisfaction is in Christ you find
[1:52:57] your fire God say okay you said no for
[1:52:59] me there I'm gonna bless you over here
[1:53:01] with one that's gonna be a much bigger
[1:53:03] much greater because you took a stand
[1:53:06] for me that's gonna be the testimony not
[1:53:09] that you know well the money no see it's
[1:53:16] women money and popularity that's what
[1:53:18] the devil gonna use I'm saying these as
[1:53:19] a warning now this is a warning sermon
[1:53:21] here tonight today let me just keep
[1:53:23] going let me keep going and we always
[1:53:25] apply it to just the ministry I want to
[1:53:27] warn everybody watch this watch this
[1:53:29] because the devil gonna use it I don't
[1:53:31] get me I don't believe that we should be
[1:53:33] a poor Church I believe we should be
[1:53:36] wealthy the wealth of the wicked is laid
[1:53:39] up for the righteous right I believe we
[1:53:42] should be wealthy don't don't get me
[1:53:44] wrong in there but at what cost
[1:53:48] okay let me go off I've already prayed
[1:53:52] that God would enlarge y'all coasts I
[1:53:55] prayed the prayer of Jabez over every
[1:53:57] business in here all right but enlarging
[1:54:00] your Coast I don't want you compromising
[1:54:02] with the devil all right
[1:54:04] can I go a little further all right
[1:54:07] listen to this he said that couldn't go
[1:54:08] for myself but here not long ago there
[1:54:09] was a great sum of money many of you
[1:54:11] heard about it was given to me and I
[1:54:12] refused to look at it I don't know if I
[1:54:16] were refused to look at it but
[1:54:18] I'm just being honest but thank God we
[1:54:22] had a prophet that taught us how to be
[1:54:25] Christians
[1:54:26] I refuse to look at it I could have made
[1:54:30] all of you happy I'm good I could have
[1:54:36] made all of you happy just pick through
[1:54:38] now $1,500,000 see and I even refused to
[1:54:43] look at it see they packed an article of
[1:54:48] it in the paper that I didn't want it
[1:54:50] isn't money
[1:54:51] a man that gets his mom no money
[1:54:53] popularity and things like that he's
[1:54:55] surely only outside there's three things
[1:55:00] I've noticed in reading history that
[1:55:01] wrecks a minister's life from the start
[1:55:03] one of them is money the love of it the
[1:55:06] next is popularity now notice I said
[1:55:08] that because that's the Bible it's not
[1:55:11] it's not the money is the root of all
[1:55:13] evil stop quoting it like that thing
[1:55:15] what the Bible thing money is the root
[1:55:17] of all evil
[1:55:18] no the love of money is the root of all
[1:55:22] evil
[1:55:23] because the Bible also save money
[1:55:24] answereth all things and you don't
[1:55:27] believe that XF PL x2 City West poem
[1:55:34] actually a mortgage company you'll cop
[1:55:38] amen
[1:55:39] money answer with all things money keep
[1:55:42] them off your back so you need money but
[1:55:46] the love of money is something different
[1:55:49] because the love of money causes you to
[1:55:51] compromise and and as you compromise you
[1:55:54] realize that I mean you're chasing the
[1:55:57] wrong thing what regard the love of
[1:55:59] money a man is the root of all evil
[1:56:02] all right listen to what he says he says
[1:56:04] we can answer directly ministers like
[1:56:06] from the start one of them is money love
[1:56:07] of it the next is popularity when he
[1:56:09] thinks he's something when he's nothing
[1:56:12] anyhow and the next is women that's
[1:56:14] right now some of these things the next
[1:56:17] is popularity the next is popularity do
[1:56:21] you know you can become popular
[1:56:26] you realize that I mean look at this
[1:56:30] fella you have you might saw him gonna
[1:56:32] need my the man was just saving a baby's
[1:56:36] life it was instinct he just climbing to
[1:56:43] trying to save a baby from falling and
[1:56:45] in one act of kindness conscious man
[1:56:50] just went and went viral one act of
[1:56:54] kindness will fire and the man got his
[1:56:55] citizenship the man became a fireman
[1:57:01] didn't even apply for the chop all in
[1:57:09] all in one act of kindness
[1:57:11] you can become popular like that now
[1:57:13] that man's life is change if you don't
[1:57:18] handle it right
[1:57:18] oh Lord he's gonna be trying to skill a
[1:57:21] lot more fearless social media makes us
[1:57:30] popular and so so even when we are when
[1:57:34] we're drawing on social media what's the
[1:57:36] intent or the heart of your posts what
[1:57:44] are you really trying to see what you're
[1:57:48] trying to do is it to encourage what are
[1:57:52] you really doing what what's the heart
[1:57:54] of it because God knows it God knows it
[1:57:59] and oftentimes we do it because we want
[1:58:01] to become popular we would love for
[1:58:05] something that we did to go viral and
[1:58:06] everybody talked about us that will
[1:58:08] change your life and it changed your
[1:58:12] life you know why not oh my god why
[1:58:17] don't you know oh there's so many things
[1:58:19] that we could we can say in there but
[1:58:21] watch that spirit not only does the
[1:58:25] minister have to watch it but the church
[1:58:27] also has to watch it listen I'm going on
[1:58:30] in this quote and I got I got another
[1:58:32] thing to read here and I'm gonna try to
[1:58:33] get into something else but not but
[1:58:35] there's a that he says
[1:58:38] this Rex administers life from the start
[1:58:40] one of them is money love of it the
[1:58:41] Nexus popularity and when he thinks he's
[1:58:43] something when he's nothing anyhow and
[1:58:45] the next is women that's right man takes
[1:58:47] money women popularity that's been the
[1:58:49] three major things that God had trouble
[1:58:51] with his children many of the other
[1:58:53] things that goes along with it too but
[1:58:55] the main thing is when God begins to
[1:58:56] bless a brother and give him something a
[1:58:59] little more than a something another to
[1:59:00] help the people then the man begins to
[1:59:03] thank you see Who I am
[1:59:04] right there he's on his road down you
[1:59:08] want me you want me to tell you how to
[1:59:09] get up get down Oh y'all I'm in Kenton
[1:59:15] that went right right right over your
[1:59:17] head you want to know how to get
[1:59:18] elevated get down the way up is go down
[1:59:26] how are your knees right amen said the
[1:59:31] way up is there doubt he that humbles
[1:59:33] himself God will exalt is that right he
[1:59:36] that exalts himself will be made a base
[1:59:38] so church you know these scriptures
[1:59:41] scriptural principles are still accurate
[1:59:45] I want to read this other quote here
[1:59:46] because this is going to be something I
[1:59:48] read this recently and it just blessed
[1:59:50] my heart the brother branham just turned
[1:59:52] down a 1.5 million dollars we just read
[1:59:54] that a man he's now back in that time
[1:59:57] you realized what 1.5 million dollars
[1:59:59] was even a date do you realize what 1.5
[2:00:03] million dollars is is a blessing it's a
[2:00:06] real blessing but he turned it down
[2:00:09] right he had something on the inside
[2:00:12] because the status on the inside him in
[2:00:13] satisfaction was not in the money his
[2:00:15] satisfaction was in serving price now
[2:00:20] here's another one that I caught
[2:00:22] something here let's just read this
[2:00:24] testimony this is out of the message
[2:00:25] conferences he said the president of the
[2:00:29] for Rose whiskey was over to our place
[2:00:31] here's some time ago and she brought her
[2:00:33] daughter and she said oh the little girl
[2:00:38] wanted to be healed and she said she had
[2:00:40] heard about it and she's gonna have an
[2:00:42] operation and so she said now notice
[2:00:44] she's the president of four rolls
[2:00:46] whiskey okay bringing her daughter for
[2:00:48] healing that you know even even
[2:00:51] people with top positions on big
[2:00:55] companies they still need God so when
[2:01:00] you come in contact with them can I say
[2:01:04] when you come in contact with them
[2:01:06] realize that human beings that meet God
[2:01:09] not just your services they need the God
[2:01:13] that you have amen
[2:01:16] God I mean see see Jesus had need to go
[2:01:20] find Samaria every time you get the call
[2:01:22] it's somebody that need what you got and
[2:01:26] you got to realize what you got
[2:01:28] because Peter said silver and gold have
[2:01:32] I none but such as I have I give on TV
[2:01:35] not just your services the god that's
[2:01:40] only inside of you is what they need
[2:01:43] can I go further listen said let me just
[2:01:52] leave it there was a time of my life
[2:02:00] where I looked in the mirror I was
[2:02:05] forget what I was making at that time
[2:02:07] but I looked in the mirror I said man
[2:02:10] I'm a $50,000 that year man
[2:02:13] I deserve to make $50,000 a year and I
[2:02:18] said it because I believed it and I've
[2:02:21] looked I've talked to myself in that
[2:02:22] mirror and it took me about two or three
[2:02:24] years and moved to a job and and it was
[2:02:27] a lab removed to the job but you know
[2:02:29] and I'm thinking I was getting a setback
[2:02:30] but actually it was set up for a
[2:02:31] blessing right and when I when I got the
[2:02:34] job
[2:02:34] I ended up getting by two or three
[2:02:36] promotions in a matter of two or three
[2:02:37] years and every time I got a promotion
[2:02:38] it was a 10% race and as I got the
[2:02:41] temperance that raised it took me over
[2:02:43] them over the $50,000 MARSOC man I hate
[2:02:46] it I didn't have my degree or nothing at
[2:02:48] that time but I said I'm still worth
[2:02:49] $50,000 and when I hit it when I hit the
[2:02:53] hit the target then I say well okay now
[2:02:56] where do I go from here I had no idea
[2:02:59] where to go I didn't know what to do I'm
[2:03:01] like okay I knew all the thing I could
[2:03:03] do it just go
[2:03:05] just keep going up and the Lord blessed
[2:03:07] me a man where I finally got to a job
[2:03:10] and I got so many promotions where I
[2:03:13] doubled my $50,000 I did that I was so
[2:03:17] grateful but you know what I found that
[2:03:21] still what enough right I couldn't find
[2:03:26] satisfaction in the career right that
[2:03:29] that's what that's not that's not where
[2:03:30] my satisfaction was my satisfaction was
[2:03:33] actually found in Christ and I remember
[2:03:36] somebody told me so now when you work
[2:03:37] for the Lord you don't make a lot less
[2:03:38] okay maybe subtle but I still got
[2:03:41] satisfaction and here's the other thing
[2:03:43] that I found this the other thing about
[2:03:44] it's not about how much I make it's all
[2:03:47] my knees being men you know that's
[2:03:53] different when you got satisfaction
[2:03:56] guarantee that ain't think about how
[2:03:58] much money but I all my knees bent can I
[2:04:02] pay my mortgage is my hat is my condo up
[2:04:05] that's all I need God and if you just do
[2:04:09] that
[2:04:09] muck the funk I be okay unless you want
[2:04:13] to pay it off in advance but I'm gonna
[2:04:19] tell you why healing paying off in
[2:04:20] advance sometime
[2:04:23] because the pressure make you pray
[2:04:27] if you ain't had no pressure can I also
[2:04:33] say some if you had a whole bunch of
[2:04:36] extra money what would you do if you had
[2:04:43] a whole bunch of extra money now you
[2:04:45] know the first thing we say oh I would
[2:04:46] do this for the church you always trying
[2:04:48] to put God at the 5th everybody
[2:04:51] everybody else Chuck put God at the top
[2:04:54] oh I why don't you stop doing that right
[2:04:56] now that's why I got to see all three
[2:05:03] you can't make no deal with God your
[2:05:05] satisfactions gotta be found in him
[2:05:08] alright let me go on a little friend I
[2:05:10] got to read this
[2:05:11] could this bless me so here this decide
[2:05:14] he said she heard about it she was gonna
[2:05:17] have an operation so he said oh she
[2:05:18] wanted to come over here she didn't want
[2:05:20] to be operated on when else she run in
[2:05:22] while I was speaking won't to be prayed
[2:05:26] for right then so she's interrupting the
[2:05:28] service had to be right then well now
[2:05:30] she couldn't stay her mother was after
[2:05:32] her so mother comes in the back of the
[2:05:34] room set down with an arrogant look so
[2:05:37] then we come up right for a little girl
[2:05:39] and went back well a couple days after
[2:05:41] that the doctor said alright it's a
[2:05:43] bunch of foolishness
[2:05:44] I said but she said no I feel fine no
[2:05:47] appendicitis with me I'm fine and dandy
[2:05:50] so they went on for five days
[2:05:52] after a while you see at just as I
[2:05:54] explained it after about 72 hours the
[2:05:57] symptom reoccurs again if you really got
[2:05:59] he'll see healing I'm not talking about
[2:06:01] miracles so healing and miracles are
[2:06:03] different right
[2:06:04] since so healing sissie it's the after
[2:06:07] if you really got he'll see healing I'm
[2:06:09] not talking about miracles and it
[2:06:10] reoccurs that's a powerful thing right
[2:06:13] healing and miracles are different
[2:06:15] miracles is when that thing just is
[2:06:18] banished just like that but healing is a
[2:06:20] process of time and the same God that
[2:06:24] does healing is the same guy that does
[2:06:25] miracles
[2:06:27] so sometimes someone's going to go
[2:06:29] through a healing and we got to
[2:06:31] understand the healing takes time can I
[2:06:34] go a little further even if you have to
[2:06:36] go through emotional healing it takes
[2:06:39] time
[2:06:41] glory to God it all happened overnight
[2:06:45] it takes time and you have to give God
[2:06:47] his time let's go home
[2:06:51] says after about 70 rounds of septum
[2:06:54] reoccurs again if you really got healed
[2:06:56] healing I'm sorry I'm not talking about
[2:06:57] miracles and reoccurred because the
[2:06:59] appendix begin as well and the doctor
[2:07:02] said Oh Lord Jesus if we can catch that
[2:07:04] spiritually you know if you have you've
[2:07:07] been healed of an emotional scar
[2:07:09] something that somebody said is
[2:07:11] something that somebody did you know you
[2:07:13] didn't get healed of that scar but you
[2:07:15] know what somebody else can come along
[2:07:17] later on and do the same thing and you
[2:07:19] know that touches that scar again and
[2:07:21] you have to go through a healing process
[2:07:22] all over again oh I hope you're kept in
[2:07:26] that all right I'm going on I'm going on
[2:07:29] it says every reoccur because the
[2:07:31] appendix begin to swell and the doctor
[2:07:33] said now you see now you better go get
[2:07:35] that whole array of Holy Roller preacher
[2:07:37] again so then he wouldn't he wouldn't
[2:07:39] operate but course when there was about
[2:07:42] $1500 involved he could do it he said he
[2:07:47] wouldn't but he'd been it right it
[2:07:50] happened to be a friend of mine on that
[2:07:52] staff that when they remove open the
[2:07:55] girl up to take the appendix out there
[2:07:57] was nothing wrong see they operate it
[2:07:59] for nothing they just left the appendix
[2:08:02] there cuz it wasn't even affected in no
[2:08:05] way and the doctor come told me about it
[2:08:07] a render man on that staff that helped
[2:08:09] me up that helped operate now you see
[2:08:12] what it was she was all excited and then
[2:08:14] knows just how to hold on to that pain
[2:08:16] see and there we don't get a chance to
[2:08:19] explain that then that made my doctor
[2:08:22] friend told my mother said the appendix
[2:08:24] is still there they said she needed that
[2:08:26] appendix and it wasn't infected it was
[2:08:28] nothing to it at all just perfectly
[2:08:30] normal pink just oh like it should be
[2:08:32] now this is the part I want you to catch
[2:08:34] remember this mama is the is like the
[2:08:37] leader of an organization the four rose
[2:08:39] whiskey now
[2:08:40] notice and the mother became a believer
[2:08:43] and then she says to me what needs to be
[2:08:47] done is your ministry is not sit down in
[2:08:50] the corner with a bunch of just ordinary
[2:08:52] people no I ain't you see don't you see
[2:08:55] the devil set you up you don't need to
[2:08:58] be with it just a bunch of ordinary
[2:08:59] people it should be flashed across the
[2:09:03] country here everywhere should be on
[2:09:07] billboards now look at this statement
[2:09:10] now that's just what the devil wants
[2:09:16] that's right see but no I don't I don't
[2:09:19] want it like that
[2:09:20] now remember popularity is the thing
[2:09:22] that would get people and what the devil
[2:09:25] actually wants us to do is the blasted
[2:09:34] now don't get me wrong we have to
[2:09:36] advertise but how will we have a time
[2:09:41] right how are we doing here this later
[2:09:43] stage you know brother branham we want
[2:09:45] and like my mom's cause they even when
[2:09:46] they come to ministry for him when he
[2:09:48] would advertise they say they say you
[2:09:50] see that the the the evangelists a big
[2:09:51] picture of the evangelists and you can
[2:09:53] see a little note in us in the small
[2:09:55] corner say Jesus Christ the same
[2:09:58] yesterday today and family what it does
[2:10:01] is that we put the attention on
[2:10:02] ourselves and we've taken it off of
[2:10:04] Christ how can we bless God and what we
[2:10:09] do how can we I mean how can we actually
[2:10:12] give God more glory and what we do
[2:10:16] that's a question for all of us right
[2:10:18] how can we actually make sure God is on
[2:10:20] display and not just us how can we
[2:10:23] ensure that that that God is being
[2:10:26] elevated or lifted up and not just us
[2:10:29] praise the Lord I mean it you know I
[2:10:32] tell you what rather than me go viral
[2:10:35] while it's something I do for the Lord
[2:10:36] go viral all right all right now I want
[2:10:42] to read this man I want to I want to go
[2:10:45] to Matthew 19 okay because this is I
[2:10:47] told you money is not the answer
[2:10:50] a man for satisfaction holy Christ can
[2:10:54] provide
[2:10:54] that the answer for satisfaction if you
[2:10:56] drink of this water you'll never thirst
[2:10:58] again that's that's the water that
[2:10:59] Christ has to offer now here in Matthew
[2:11:01] 19 there's a story here and brother
[2:11:05] Branham just kind of brought this out to
[2:11:06] us as we were listening to the sermon
[2:11:09] amen come follow me on Friday night and
[2:11:12] I just want to kind of follow up with
[2:11:14] that here Matthew 19 let's read this
[2:11:16] about the rich young ruler it says verse
[2:11:20] verse 16 and behold one came and said
[2:11:23] unto him good master what think what
[2:11:25] good thing shall I do that I may have
[2:11:27] eternal life I said to him why call us
[2:11:30] down be good there is none good but one
[2:11:33] that is God but if thou will thou wilt
[2:11:36] enter into life keep the commandments
[2:11:39] now brother Branham made a statement
[2:11:41] about this man saying that when he tells
[2:11:43] him there's none good but God said this
[2:11:46] rich young ruler was actually
[2:11:48] identifying that Christ was gods he had
[2:11:53] a revelation that this that you Jesus
[2:11:56] you are God that's why I'm calling you
[2:11:58] good master right so he goes on verse 18
[2:12:01] it says he's telling him which jesus
[2:12:03] said my First Gentleman if you want to
[2:12:05] enter to life but if that will enter
[2:12:07] into life keep the commandments
[2:12:09] he said unto Him which Jesus said thou
[2:12:12] shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit
[2:12:15] adultery thou should not steal thou
[2:12:18] should not bear false witness honor thy
[2:12:20] father and thy mother and thou shalt
[2:12:22] love thy neighbour as thyself all right
[2:12:25] said the young man said unto him all
[2:12:27] these things have I kept from my youth
[2:12:31] up what lack I yet now here's the
[2:12:35] problem
[2:12:35] amen here's the problem because uh you
[2:12:39] know let's go a little further says
[2:12:40] Sheila said to him if thy will be
[2:12:42] perfect no one said that thou hast and
[2:12:46] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[2:12:48] treasure in heaven and come follow come
[2:12:50] and follow me but when the young man
[2:12:52] heard that saying he went away sorrowful
[2:12:54] for he had great possessions they said
[2:12:57] Jesus of this Recycles barely any of you
[2:12:59] that a rich man shall hardly enter into
[2:13:02] the kingdom of heaven and again I said
[2:13:03] to you it is easier for a camel to go
[2:13:05] throughout the
[2:13:06] the eye of a needle than for a rich man
[2:13:09] to enter into the kingdom of God I want
[2:13:10] you to catch something that the Prophet
[2:13:12] tells us here about this young man he
[2:13:15] was keeping all the commandments he was
[2:13:17] doing everything that the Word of God
[2:13:18] told him now so at the time that he
[2:13:22] approached in Jesus he looks like I mean
[2:13:24] this is a real good Christian boy great
[2:13:26] boy this is not some renegade this is a
[2:13:29] nice boy I mean and oftentimes we don't
[2:13:32] realize it we can start out real nice
[2:13:35] but over time lose our focus like this
[2:13:39] young man lost his focus and we're not
[2:13:42] keeping the commandments no more oh it
[2:13:45] happened in his life
[2:13:46] now I'm taking coz here's what happened
[2:13:49] notice the last person and last
[2:13:50] statement in verse bactine thou shalt
[2:13:52] love thy neighbor as thyself Jesus gives
[2:13:56] us the story of this this rich young
[2:13:58] ruler and what happened was him before
[2:14:01] he left this life he went through where
[2:14:03] he was blessed he turned Christ down he
[2:14:05] got blessed as Barnes just expanded he
[2:14:08] had to build new barns and in order to
[2:14:10] store all the goods that he had I mean
[2:14:12] this man got blessed after he turned
[2:14:15] down Christ God blessed right but the
[2:14:17] problem was is that he died and the
[2:14:19] Bible say in hell he lifted up his eyes
[2:14:21] now now our brother branham say when he
[2:14:24] got to hell there was a conversation
[2:14:26] that he had with Abraham and there was a
[2:14:29] chasm there or a great gulf that was in
[2:14:32] hell and he began to talk wit up wit
[2:14:34] with Abraham and he saw Lazarus a beggar
[2:14:37] that was at his gate tied around the
[2:14:39] same time he thought he saw the man
[2:14:42] inhale
[2:14:43] but in Abraham's bosom which we call
[2:14:46] also paradise but this great gap chasm
[2:14:49] that he saw he's talkin say let him go
[2:14:51] just just dip his fingers of water and
[2:14:53] just come and just just touch he said no
[2:14:54] no we can't do that we can't do that you
[2:14:57] know he said uh they said it's great
[2:14:59] Gulf won't even allow us to cross over
[2:15:01] they could sit and talkin everything
[2:15:02] else you said but they say he said what
[2:15:04] happened with this young man the reason
[2:15:06] he ended up in that condition is yes
[2:15:08] when he faced Jesus he was keeping
[2:15:10] Commandments but at the end of his life
[2:15:13] before he died he got away from the
[2:15:15] commandments and the way you can see
[2:15:16] that he got away from the commandments
[2:15:18] is because
[2:15:19] Lazarus was laying at his gate full of
[2:15:21] sores however Jesus told him he was full
[2:15:25] to love his neighbor as itself how did
[2:15:29] he get away from it
[2:15:30] how'd it get he was keeping he had a
[2:15:32] testimony I was keeping it but over time
[2:15:35] we got away from it I'm telling you I'm
[2:15:37] telling you this right man there's many
[2:15:39] people that get blessed and get away
[2:15:41] from it don't let your blessings take
[2:15:46] you away from what you used to do but
[2:15:51] don't do that no one knew what you
[2:15:53] missed it that one God if the blessings
[2:15:55] begin to move you away from what you
[2:15:56] used to do something way roll somewhere
[2:15:59] that the blessings should bring you
[2:16:01] closer to God
[2:16:02] not moving farther away from God I mean
[2:16:06] I was I was just sharing I remember this
[2:16:08] being as a young man we came out of high
[2:16:12] school I'm not talking about one of us
[2:16:17] practically our almost our whole youth
[2:16:20] group half of us graduated high school
[2:16:24] and was working that brat with me we had
[2:16:28] good jobs ha ha
[2:16:29] no college high school high school
[2:16:34] working at Pratt Whitney we saw we saw
[2:16:36] the hand of God because we we we held on
[2:16:40] to the Lord right we were faithful when
[2:16:42] we was at when we was at Publix
[2:16:46] we paid ties at Publix
[2:16:50] and when we came out I asked who God
[2:16:52] blessed us with good chops and everybody
[2:16:55] left Pratt Whitney ended up with
[2:16:57] something better right what I'm here to
[2:17:00] tell you that if you keep God first your
[2:17:02] satisfaction has got to be found in
[2:17:04] Christ nothing else
[2:17:06] don't let nothing else take your
[2:17:08] attention off of Christ if this guard
[2:17:11] hinder you from being faithful to God
[2:17:13] it's not worth it
[2:17:17] can I can I'm a cop I want to make a
[2:17:19] plan if your family is gonna hinder you
[2:17:22] from from keeping God first you're gonna
[2:17:26] have to make a decision and then Jesus
[2:17:31] say Who that he that won't forsake
[2:17:32] father mother of this earth that is not
[2:17:36] worthy to follow me Church don't let
[2:17:39] nothing come in between you and your God
[2:17:41] don't let your business come between you
[2:17:44] and your God don't let your career come
[2:17:46] between you and your God don't let you
[2:17:47] don't let your education come between
[2:17:49] you and your God don't let nothing come
[2:17:51] between you and your God amen yeah we
[2:17:56] got it you know all glory to God I just
[2:18:00] I feel like it's necessary that we say
[2:18:02] these things like Jesus had needed to go
[2:18:04] by Samaria I have need to come and say
[2:18:05] these things amen let me let me let me
[2:18:08] just read a couple statements that
[2:18:10] brother branham said about this this
[2:18:11] young man and come follow me he made the
[2:18:14] statement system it don't always have to
[2:18:16] be money right that pull you away from
[2:18:18] things is they can be other things see
[2:18:20] anything that we hold dear dearer than
[2:18:23] we do that call see it becomes like a
[2:18:25] money to us right it not always has to
[2:18:29] be money it can be other things see
[2:18:31] anything that we hold dear err then we
[2:18:34] do that call see it becomes like a money
[2:18:37] to us it becomes something that corrupts
[2:18:39] us let me also he said this says he
[2:18:43] didn't listen to the to the voice of
[2:18:45] Christ when this boy was given an
[2:18:46] opportunity to come follow Christ he
[2:18:48] didn't listen to the voice of Christ he
[2:18:50] said he went with this friends I want to
[2:18:52] say I want to say something he says
[2:18:54] we're true kids you're all fine kids
[2:18:56] that you bought your bound to have
[2:18:57] friends but watch what kind of friends
[2:18:59] you have if that friend is following
[2:19:01] Christ go with that friend follow Christ
[2:19:03] - but if it don't don't do it so there's
[2:19:07] a statement that I heard last Sunday
[2:19:09] that my share this with the young people
[2:19:11] friends are like buttons in an elevator
[2:19:17] they can either take you up
[2:19:22] or they can take you down watch your
[2:19:26] friends
[2:19:35] the proper girls on the state is it says

[2:20:37] to our life and some stuff we need to
[2:20:38] just uninvite hey man Church right but
[2:20:42] but here here the thing of it is if you
[2:20:44] when you got people if you if you're not
[2:20:46] surrounded with people that can keep you
[2:20:48] strengthened and encouraged you got to
[2:20:49] get rid of that the dead weight
[2:20:51] amen all right all right friends are
[2:20:55] like buttons in the elevator you push it

[2:21:03] flew you're still sheet with praise God
[2:21:06] anyhow all right let me go on a little
[2:21:09] further he says it says it says there
[2:21:13] laid a man at the gate by the name of
[2:21:14] Lazarus begging for food and Bailey he
[2:21:17] would have eat the crumbs that swept off
[2:21:20] not even to the beggar but to the dogs
[2:21:23] and was full of sores but the man had
[2:21:26] been so polished in society this is a
[2:21:28] statement that this I mention in
[2:21:30] paragraph 77 on that yeah that's good
[2:21:33] the man had been so polished in society
[2:21:36] that he had no more feeling Oh God
[2:21:42] the man had been so polished in society
[2:21:46] that means he's thinking about what
[2:21:48] he thinks about right you know you there
[2:21:51] are certain scriptures you won't post
[2:21:54] under your name under your identity you
[2:22:01] got to come up with a love identity to
[2:22:03] post Scripture but under your name you
[2:22:06] ain't put no script right there no
[2:22:09] quotes
[2:22:10] I'm not identified with the Prophet
[2:22:21] right it's it but by the man hat they've
[2:22:24] so polished in society then he had no
[2:22:28] more feeling look at this he become numb
[2:22:32] because he rejected that offer of Christ
[2:22:34] man I'm praying Church don't become numb
[2:22:37] don't become so polished by society and
[2:22:40] so worried about what the world thinks
[2:22:43] of you that you forget about what God
[2:22:46] thinks of you look at this this is
[2:22:54] another statement I mean I don't even
[2:22:55] know where I'm at on this I'm is
[2:22:58] somewhere in between keep going down now
[2:23:16] he was in hell he was in hell at this
[2:23:20] point in time this rich young ruler he
[2:23:23] said you noticed what he said father
[2:23:24] Abraham now he still remembered in hell
[2:23:28] he remembered that Abraham was the
[2:23:31] father of the Jews he said father
[2:23:34] Abraham send that beggar Lazarus down
[2:23:35] here with a little water on his fingers
[2:23:37] to put on my lips these flames are
[2:23:39] tormenting he said listen and Abraham
[2:23:42] saying it is it's I can't do that in so
[2:23:45] many words and besides all this you see
[2:23:46] you had your opportunity in life when
[2:23:50] did he have it when Jesus said follow me
[2:23:52] but he turned it down
[2:23:54] he went the way that he could make money
[2:23:57] oh my and that's all right nothing wrong
[2:24:01] with making money
[2:24:02] the Prophet saying that ain't nothing
[2:24:03] wrong with making money nothing wrong
[2:24:05] make money but follow Jesus why are you
[2:24:08] doing it follow Jesus why you're making
[2:24:12] money right you say follow Jesus right
[2:24:14] into it and see when he had went the
[2:24:16] other way with the crowd you find out he
[2:24:19] said and Abraham said besides all this
[2:24:22] there is a gulf fixed between you and
[2:24:23] and he that no man has ever crossed over
[2:24:26] never will them that are the them that
[2:24:29] are there cannot come here and these
[2:24:31] here cannot go there it says it's been
[2:24:34] pig still managed cost or will cross man
[2:24:37] look at this
[2:24:38] then listen at him this is inhale inhale
[2:24:43] listen animal he wants to be an
[2:24:46] evangelist then in a folk will turn down
[2:24:52] they God given Collins all y'all got
[2:24:54] called us
[2:24:55] everybody in here got call to do
[2:24:57] something and folk would give up the
[2:25:00] god-given Collins to pursue money
[2:25:08] and I want to tell you the love of money
[2:25:10] is the root of all evil when you give it
[2:25:13] up your God give it : like I said all
[2:25:15] y'all got some EBL so y'all coming and
[2:25:17] saying your song brings a certain
[2:25:19] anointing into the sanctuary right your
[2:25:23] your song does something for the people
[2:25:24] of God and when you gonna give up your
[2:25:26] god-given calling you might find
[2:25:29] yourself like this fella here look at
[2:25:30] this and then he's inhale and now he
[2:25:34] wants to be an evangelist too late my
[2:25:37] brother but 17 that's what happened when
[2:25:41] God put a calling on your life I don't
[2:25:43] care what you do that call thing normal
[2:25:44] where now you can use it for God or you
[2:25:47] can use it for the demo listen Adam he
[2:25:51] wants to be evangelists in the call that
[2:25:55] Jesus had given him to follow him had
[2:25:57] and to be a soul winner that was his
[2:26:00] real purpose that's the reason God put
[2:26:03] him in contact with the people that he
[2:26:04] came in contact with to be a soul winner
[2:26:06] listen it says as a young man returned
[2:26:09] oh my just just bless me to follow him
[2:26:14] had to be a soul winner and as a young
[2:26:16] man returned to him again and I wonder
[2:26:17] further emcee the calling that God that
[2:26:20] Jesus gave him as a young man and he
[2:26:22] forsook it it came back to him in Hell
[2:26:24] Oh Lord Jesus
[2:26:27] I wouldn't want that to happen to me are
[2:26:30] you saying nah
[2:26:31] what's the use of singing like like the
[2:26:34] light like David say how can I sing in a
[2:26:35] strange land I'm gonna sing while I got
[2:26:38] opportunity give glory to God here I'm
[2:26:41] gonna worship while I got an opportunity
[2:26:43] give God worship here my satisfaction is
[2:26:47] found in Christ not in nothing else
[2:26:49] listen he remembered it that he had five
[2:26:55] brothers back on earth and he didn't
[2:26:57] want them in that place and he said sin
[2:26:59] Lazarus then back to tell my brother's
[2:27:03] not to come this way in other words
[2:27:04] accept the call of follow me see but I
[2:27:07] said if they won't do it you say yes if
[2:27:10] what were raised from the dead like
[2:27:11] Lazarus and go back and tell us you see
[2:27:13] it shows that after we die you're still
[2:27:15] conscious
[2:27:17] he remembered Abraham said son remember
[2:27:20] in your days you see he remember see you
[2:27:23] still remember you don't lose your
[2:27:24] memory you remember oh god I tell you I
[2:27:28] was blessed by a testimony that I heard
[2:27:30] recently and I don't know if brother dig
[2:27:34] shared this last week he was telling to
[2:27:36] me
[2:27:36] I want to tell you your satisfaction is
[2:27:39] found in Christ there's telling me a
[2:27:41] testimony of a man a very wealthy man
[2:27:44] from Russia and he he was going to a
[2:27:49] they were going to live meetings of
[2:27:51] conventions and things of that nature
[2:27:53] and just business conventions and there

[2:27:58] come to the meetings and as they would
[2:28:00] come and they would meet at these
[2:28:01] meetings this Russian man began to
[2:28:04] notice the man from Canada quite often

[2:28:13] would never go out with him never drink
[2:28:14] never do nothing so the man notice it

[2:34:14] it's not a testimony when you got a Miss
[2:34:20] Church that's not a testimony that is
[2:34:25] not that income from God that came from
[2:34:27] the devil
[2:34:28] and I know some time we hear somebody
[2:34:29] give a testimony that oh praise God not
[2:34:32] me freezing gone for nothing that I see
[2:34:35] right now ain't ain't praising God for
[2:34:37] that that don't sound right
[2:34:38] that don't sound like something I gotta
[2:34:40] do I know how to double act but that
[2:34:42] know something know how to do amen
[2:34:45] my satisfaction is found in Christ he's
[2:34:48] the only thing that offers satisfaction
[2:34:50] guaranteed a man church well praise the
[2:34:54] Lord I just one thing oh I did have one
[2:34:56] more quote y'all just bear with me I'm
[2:34:57] gonna read this number let this go
[2:34:59] that man walked away from his calling
[2:35:02] that day that he had the opportunity to
[2:35:05] follow Christ and I looked at what
[2:35:06] brother Branham says here in this
[2:35:07] message my last quote I think Asylum God
[2:35:13] commissioned a Moses God commissioning
[2:35:19] Moses he said this I was read of this
[2:35:21] and I happen to think about it you
[2:35:22] should have power after Holy Ghost comes
[2:35:24] upon you that's what God commissioned
[2:35:26] his disciples and then when he
[2:35:28] commissioned Moses said why what is in
[2:35:30] thy hand let's drop our thoughts back
[2:35:32] tonight to the god commissioner Moses
[2:35:34] the Prophet he had done wrong he got
[2:35:36] away from God he has slain a man he
[2:35:38] back on the backside of the desert and
[2:35:40] married a woman back there by the names
[2:35:42] of pora and Ethiopian and he had two
[2:35:44] children born to him by her and he was
[2:35:46] hurting Jethro his father-in-law sheep
[2:35:49] way back on the back side of desert
[2:35:50] running from God just like a man running
[2:35:53] from his calling taking up the material
[2:35:55] things you know what you ought to remind
[2:36:01] folks they call him
[2:36:04] Ramana what they call him you running
[2:36:06] from your calling taking up material
[2:36:08] things you know what I mean you know how
[2:36:11] people have been blessed underneath this
[2:36:14] inspiration of this word they've written
[2:36:17] songs they have God has anointed them
[2:36:21] and some of the songs that have been
[2:36:22] written the songs that could have went
[2:36:23] top of the charts everybody got out
[2:36:25] there but they get away from this
[2:36:27] anointing and there's nothing that
[2:36:28] happens in they life nothing
[2:36:30] you ought to remind people of their
[2:36:32] calling the gift that God gave them amen
[2:36:36] let me go a little further it says
[2:36:37] there's probably a man sitting here
[2:36:38] tonight that if he just dumped what God
[2:36:41] told them a long time ago he'd be
[2:36:43] preaching the gospel somewhere do
[2:36:45] something don't just stand still if
[2:36:47] you're not a preacher testify do
[2:36:49] something somewhere don't stand still if
[2:36:51] you're washing the dishes why testify to
[2:36:53] the neighbor get out past and past
[2:36:56] tracts do something don't stand still
[2:36:58] once again get doing something and
[2:37:00] whatever is that your hand use it and I
[2:37:02] can see Moses that he was going along
[2:37:04] hurt hurting some sheep one morning
[2:37:06] probably thinking about the days he was
[2:37:07] about 80 years 80 years then some people
[2:37:10] say well I'm too old Moses wasn't when
[2:37:12] he was 80 so he'd been 40 years got
[2:37:14] child training impacted on the backside
[2:37:16] of desert and they get getting him ready
[2:37:17] preparing him for the surface of the
[2:37:19] Lord and then there was a burning bush
[2:37:20] and Moses stepped up to the burning bush
[2:37:22] to look at it I don't believe I don't
[2:37:24] believe to criticize it it was a lot of
[2:37:26] fire burned and carrying on
[2:37:27] he thought he just walked us out to see
[2:37:29] what why wasn't consumed and while he
[2:37:31] was while he was walking up close to it
[2:37:33] the Lord said take off your shoes here
[2:37:35] on holy ground here Moses as brother
[2:37:37] branham was telling us a man was a man
[2:37:39] running from his colleague taking up the
[2:37:41] material things and I want to tell you
[2:37:43] how a man don't be chasing material
[2:37:45] things make sure you keep your calling
[2:37:48] and care take something else
[2:37:50] if you're gonna give all all of what you
[2:37:52] got to some of these things that God is
[2:37:55] giving you why can't we get all of that
[2:37:58] in church some of y'all got gives y'all
[2:38:02] signal now we give God our natural stuff
[2:38:05] though I'm talking to spiritual
[2:38:08] don't sit on your gift round here use
[2:38:11] what you get for the glory of God amen
[2:38:15] Church we gotta find a balance with
[2:38:18] everything we do and I just I just got
[2:38:20] to say these things I got it I got a
[2:38:22] latest out because I don't want us to
[2:38:23] get it mixed up don't get it twisted we
[2:38:25] don't we don't pray for people a mentor
[2:38:28] for their coast to be enlarged and I'm
[2:38:29] expecting God to do that but I'm not
[2:38:31] expecting for you to lose your focus on
[2:38:35] God no no don't don't do that don't do
[2:38:39] that don't do that that n of God all
[2:38:42] right

[2:38:50] don't musicians generally have to come
[2:38:52] up and we'll stop the recordings after
[2:38:54] this after our prayer okay
[2:38:55] now father we just thank you for this
[2:38:59] time Lord just a little warning that you
[2:39:02] put in my spirit that we would just need
[2:39:05] to share and if it's only for one person
[2:39:09] then it's worth it but God I know that
[2:39:12] the enemy is certainly looking to do
[2:39:15] everything he can to disrupt the body of
[2:39:17] believers I know that he'll try whatever
[2:39:20] he can and I know God his job is to
[2:39:24] steal kill and destroy our job is to
[2:39:27] watch them to warn the people and just
[2:39:30] to make sure that we keep ourselves and
[2:39:32] check in and focus so that we don't miss
[2:39:34] what you're doing in this hour it's a
[2:39:38] real definite we're fine we can't put
[2:39:40] nothing before God we can't put our jobs
[2:39:43] before God we can't put our careers
[2:39:48] before God we can't put our family
[2:39:51] before God there is nothing that we can
[2:39:54] put before you but you're the only one
[2:39:56] that provides true satisfaction we turn
[2:40:00] to anything else like many have turned
[2:40:02] to drugs and drinking and alcohol
[2:40:03] and this one girl on the right on the
[2:40:06] airplane wanted to have a cigarette
[2:40:08] but God that she could find satisfaction
[2:40:10] and maybe those things help us to
[2:40:12] realize a man true satisfaction comes
[2:40:15] and serving you to the fullest I have
[2:40:18] just part of ourselves but let us give
[2:40:20] all of ourselves to your service
[2:40:23] help us God to surrender amen our
[2:40:25] talents surrender our ideas surrender
[2:40:29] our thoughts surrender all of them to
[2:40:31] Christ the Bible access the question
[2:40:34] what does it profit a man to gain the
[2:40:36] whole world in the lose his soul so help
[2:40:39] us to keep these things balanced God is
[2:40:41] our prayer Jesus name we pray amen
