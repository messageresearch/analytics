[49:55] get that Mike don't worry about it
[49:57] you're in a message Church
[50:01] say that's what happened in the message
[50:03] churches but I found it happening just
[50:05] about in every Church uh you have to be
[50:07] just kind of switching One mic to the
[50:09] next of the settings are completely
[50:11] different and we're
[50:12] amen by the grace of God
[50:15] I promised y'all last week a man that we
[50:20] were going to be moving into just
[50:22] something different I had a little bit
[50:24] more to
[50:25] our series on the blood I just really
[50:29] really enjoyed that but maybe the Lord
[50:31] will bring it back amen or maybe I
[50:33] preach it somewhere else and preach a
[50:34] little different and then you won't know
[50:37] what I'm talking about so you have to
[50:38] still be under expectation amen but we
[50:41] uh we we want to just move into
[50:42] something this morning that I felt would
[50:45] be beneficial for us I believe God
[50:48] allowed things to happen the way that he
[50:50] did because he wanted this day to happen
[50:53] amen and I got complete confidence in
[50:56] the god that we serve so let's just turn
[50:58] our Bibles really quickly to Ephesians
[51:00] chapter five amen Ephesians 5. and um
[51:07] I mentioned them last week that we have
[51:09] we actually been coming through this
[51:11] chapter on Wednesday nights we are doing
[51:13] our teaching on in Ephesians 5 and um I
[51:18] knew just by reading ahead I knew that
[51:22] we would hit this point and uh always a
[51:25] really really uh good spot to be
[51:29] reminded and uh you know just refreshed
[51:32] but I was I was grateful but the night
[51:35] that I got to this really really
[51:36] important verse
[51:38] it was I had a couple brothers that were
[51:42] here but you know not married and all
[51:46] the Merit Brothers just was missing that
[51:48] man I said well praise the Lord so I I
[51:51] got I got practice and teaching amen I
[51:55] got some practice of teaching it so I I
[51:57] just felt to bring it back around on the
[52:00] date amen
[52:01] amen amen let's turn Ephesians 5.
[52:05] uh verse 25 just one verse that we want
[52:08] to read here husbands
[52:12] love your wives
[52:13] even as Christ
[52:15] also love the church
[52:17] and gave himself for it amen the Lord
[52:21] and a blessing to the reading of his
[52:22] word can we just have a word of Prayer
[52:24] [Music]
[52:29] father God we thank you for
[52:32] um
[52:33] this opportunity we have to come and to
[52:37] study the word of God together and we
[52:39] trust Lord that you would just take
[52:41] control over this portion of service May
[52:44] the anointing of the Holy Ghost that's
[52:46] been here in thus far just take amen the
[52:50] word and drive it into our hearts God we
[52:53] lead it Paul wrote about it
[52:55] have purpose you have you have purpose
[52:58] for causing the first Messenger to First
[53:02] Church aids to address this so God we
[53:04] thank you for that and God we can use
[53:06] him even today we can use it Lord you
[53:09] are so concerned about even families our
[53:13] marriages
[53:14] that is that is that's important to you
[53:16] see here it's in your heart so I trust
[53:19] oh God because see you you you wanted to
[53:21] have a family
[53:22] uh that's why we're here because you
[53:24] wanted to have a family he wanted to be
[53:27] a father you also wanted to be a husband
[53:30] uh Lord you you you you became a son you
[53:33] wanted to be your family you wanted
[53:35] you're concerned about family so father
[53:37] we pray that you would help us to hear
[53:39] what the spirit is speaking to us God is
[53:42] in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can
[53:45] be seated uh in the presence of the Lord
[53:50] um
[53:52] I would just title this uh
[53:56] Family series amen it's a family series
[54:00] uh when we kind of started the year off
[54:04] I was mentioning
[54:07] to you all that uh one of the things
[54:10] that was in my spirit you know was the
[54:12] Practical teachings and then the other
[54:14] thing that was in my spirit was uh
[54:18] yielding to the perfect will of God
[54:21] all right
[54:22] uh there is a permissive will of God
[54:26] and there is a perfect will of God
[54:28] and uh oftentimes what happens is we
[54:32] find ourselves walking in the permissive
[54:36] will more than we find ourselves walking
[54:39] in the perfect will of God
[54:41] a man church right and uh but I was just
[54:45] having a little conversation with uh
[54:48] uh a young one of my nephews just the
[54:52] other day and I was telling them say
[54:53] even when you find yourself in the
[54:56] permissive will of God God has a way of
[54:59] making it work out to his perfect will
[55:02] and uh you know so I I I know that the
[55:06] scripture tells us that
[55:10] all things work together for good
[55:15] because we love God and we are called
[55:18] according to his purpose can I tell you
[55:20] something this morning whatever you're
[55:23] going through right now
[55:25] is working for your good
[55:29] on your job whatever you're going
[55:31] through right now is working for your
[55:33] goods and your family whatever you're
[55:35] going through right now is working for
[55:37] your good and your body
[55:40] whatever you're going through right now
[55:42] is working for your goods in the church
[55:45] whatever you're going through right now
[55:48] is working for your good amen I I'm
[55:52] confident of that right so
[55:55] um you know we we uh with that in mind
[55:59] just you know these two thoughts that I
[56:00] had I knew that as we were coming
[56:02] through the book of Ephesians we were
[56:04] going to get into some very practical
[56:05] teaching and uh and I think it's very
[56:08] important that we we do that you can
[56:10] live up here on a spiritual level I mean
[56:13] revelation after Revelation just kind of
[56:14] coming to you uh but if your home life
[56:17] is way down here we got a big problem in
[56:19] our hands
[56:20] we got to get them both at the same
[56:22] level
[56:23] praise the Lord somebody
[56:25] all right so sometimes we have to take
[56:27] time and and and go through some of
[56:29] these things so let's let's dig in Amen
[56:32] on today uh and uh just see what the the
[56:36] Lord has for us you can just do next
[56:38] there for me
[56:40] um we just read description husbands
[56:42] love your wives even as Christ also
[56:44] loved the church and gave himself for
[56:45] the next one says uh Colossians 3 19
[56:48] husbands love your wives and be not
[56:51] bitter against them
[56:53] a Paul writes this be not bitter against
[56:56] them things happen uh in families and
[56:59] it's very easy for the husband to get
[57:01] bitter let me tell you something when
[57:02] the husband get bitter he begins to pull
[57:03] away
[57:05] but as a as a man you can't pull away
[57:08] you have to stay engaged your family
[57:10] needs you
[57:12] your wife needs you your children need
[57:14] you you can't pull away you got to stay
[57:16] engaged
[57:18] hello somebody
[57:19] their things happen in life where
[57:21] they're gonna need you and they can't
[57:23] get uh that word of a strength that word
[57:25] of encouragement that word of Correction
[57:27] they can't get it from nobody else but
[57:29] you the word of encouragement
[57:32] hallelujah amen they needed to come from
[57:36] from Daddy it's got to come from Daddy
[57:38] got to come from got to come from
[57:40] husband it's got to come that's got to
[57:43] be the source God Made You The Source to
[57:45] be able to give that
[57:46] whatever that is you have to give back
[57:49] to your family
[57:52] husbands love your wives
[57:54] and be not bitter against them this next
[57:58] statement here brother Branham says a
[57:59] husband a true husband
[58:01] would give his life for his wife
[58:05] why because Christ gave his life for the
[58:08] church
[58:09] his wife
[58:12] hello somebody
[58:14] amen you pushing her out there to get
[58:16] struck by the bullet or something no you
[58:18] give your life
[58:19] for your wife all right
[58:22] all right a true husband would do that
[58:25] for his wife all right uh this next
[58:28] statement here uh I I I've kind of
[58:32] you're going to see that I've kind of
[58:33] put together a simulation of quotes and
[58:36] and some other things uh brother Harold
[58:39] Beckett in South Africa he has a
[58:42] Ministry
[58:43] a wonderful Ministry but he's done a lot
[58:46] of family series and and even uh he put
[58:49] out a little booklets of what the
[58:51] husbands role in in the family with the
[58:53] wife's role in the family Children's
[58:54] role he did he did that years ago with a
[58:57] few quotes that he just kind of put
[58:59] together and this one little head here
[59:01] says the head of every man is Christ and
[59:03] he's using the scripture for the husband
[59:05] is the head of the wife
[59:07] even as Christ is the head of the church
[59:09] he is the savior of the body and gave
[59:11] himself for it this statement says out
[59:13] of Jehovah Jireh now as he went up as he
[59:17] went on up the hill little Isaac
[59:18] wondering where is that lamb coming from
[59:21] Papa ain't got no lamb there's no lamb
[59:25] up here he got up there and he built the
[59:28] altar laid the wood claved it and laid
[59:31] it across got the fires are burning went
[59:34] back and got his own son and look at
[59:36] this statement he loved God
[59:39] better than he loved his own son
[59:44] now this is very important as a daddy
[59:46] now the first year first love has to be
[59:48] a love for God and it has to be
[59:50] reflected in everything else you do in
[59:52] life but he loved God better than his
[59:55] that that then he loved his own son he
[59:58] says brother if you ever amount to
[1:00:00] anything you're you've got to love God
[1:00:03] better than your wife
[1:00:06] amen your husband your children your
[1:00:09] pastor amen yeah everything that there
[1:00:12] is you got to love God first
[1:00:14] God gets first place
[1:00:18] amen it just reminds me of the story
[1:00:22] that brother Gene would tell how a
[1:00:24] husband and wife would get into an
[1:00:25] argument on their way to church y'all
[1:00:27] know the devil do that all the time only
[1:00:29] way to church and then somebody in the
[1:00:30] house in the car ready to turn back
[1:00:32] around and go back home
[1:00:34] amen but uh but but you know when they
[1:00:36] get to the church and uh the husband
[1:00:38] come in and he just praising God and and
[1:00:41] the wife sitting there just with a a
[1:00:43] lips all Poke down and she like how in
[1:00:46] the world can you be in here praising
[1:00:47] God you know what just happened in the
[1:00:49] car
[1:00:50] amen or you know just what what just
[1:00:52] happened at the house you know these
[1:00:54] things how you gonna come to church and
[1:00:55] praise God like that well the husband
[1:00:57] had a really good answer for the wife
[1:00:59] when he got back in the car he said look
[1:01:00] uh uh God didn't do nothing to me I
[1:01:03] wasn't mad at God I was mad at you
[1:01:06] and what you gotta understand that that
[1:01:09] that your wife can't become come between
[1:01:11] your relationship with God your children
[1:01:13] can't come between your relationship
[1:01:16] with God you gotta love God more
[1:01:19] then you love your wife you got to love
[1:01:21] God more than you love your husband you
[1:01:23] got to love God more than you love your
[1:01:24] children
[1:01:26] and children you gotta love God more
[1:01:28] than you love your parents
[1:01:30] your parents can't take your praise
[1:01:34] because your parents didn't die for you
[1:01:37] your parents didn't rise for you you
[1:01:39] gotta love God more
[1:01:43] Hallelujah
[1:01:46] so that that's one of those things to
[1:01:48] say when something come up in the house
[1:01:49] that don't mean you stay home from
[1:01:51] church
[1:01:51] just because something came up in the
[1:01:53] house well I don't want to go in there
[1:01:55] and hinder the service my spirit ain't
[1:01:58] right get that ain't nothing but the
[1:02:00] devil talking to you
[1:02:03] it like saying I know I'm hurt I'm sick
[1:02:06] I got body pain but I don't want to go
[1:02:08] to the hospital and hinder the
[1:02:10] atmosphere in the heart the people are
[1:02:12] there at the hospital to help you
[1:02:15] and when you come to the house of God
[1:02:17] the word of God is here to help you
[1:02:19] sometimes the songs of Zion will change
[1:02:21] your spirit
[1:02:23] [Applause]
[1:02:26] so so so so put that devil to rest
[1:02:29] don't let him keep you home because
[1:02:31] y'all had a disagreement
[1:02:33] I love God more
[1:02:36] all right
[1:02:38] this uh statement here brother random
[1:02:41] says
[1:02:42] the message absolute by the word
[1:02:43] absolute is an ultimate
[1:02:46] and therefore I think that everybody
[1:02:48] should have an ultimate
[1:02:50] it says in every great achievement
[1:02:52] that's ever been achieved there has been
[1:02:55] an absolute behind it so no matter what
[1:02:58] it was it's it's had an absolute behind
[1:03:00] it and every person in order to achieve
[1:03:02] something as the first half the absolute
[1:03:06] and that's the final wine back through
[1:03:08] this uh that back through the other till
[1:03:10] you come to that absolute or the a man
[1:03:13] or the ultimate of what you're uh you
[1:03:16] got something you have to tie to in
[1:03:18] other words It's the final tying post to
[1:03:21] every achievement it's somewhere it
[1:03:24] might wind through many different things
[1:03:26] till uh till it gets to that top post
[1:03:28] but they're they're there is the amen to
[1:03:31] all of it there must be such a thing you
[1:03:34] cannot go on through life without having
[1:03:37] one
[1:03:39] and it goes on he says um when you get
[1:03:42] married
[1:03:43] uh they there had to wind back through
[1:03:47] your mind something
[1:03:49] till you hit that top post amen and it

[1:05:03] none of that it's got to be love
[1:05:07] D hello when the kids are gone you got
[1:05:09] to have some love
[1:05:10] marriages fall apart as soon as the kids
[1:05:12] leave the house
[1:05:14] because that family did not have a typos
[1:05:18] no love between the husband and the wife
[1:05:21] you know they was married because of a
[1:05:23] job the job was to raise the children
[1:05:25] and when their job was over
[1:05:28] their marriage
[1:05:29] was over
[1:05:38] when you got married they had to wind
[1:05:40] back through your mind something till
[1:05:42] you hit the top post
[1:05:44] and it should have been love for your
[1:05:47] wife or your husband
[1:05:49] but maybe she isn't as pretty as John's
[1:05:51] wife or she's not this that but there's
[1:05:54] something about her it strikes you you
[1:05:58] say she might not be as pretty as the
[1:06:00] other or he might not be as handsome as
[1:06:02] the other but there has to be an
[1:06:04] absolute there that the person's
[1:06:06] different
[1:06:07] and and I think that's that's very very
[1:06:10] important
[1:06:11] amen it can't be based on looks uh
[1:06:14] brother random says got to be based on a
[1:06:16] character uh but but here you know he
[1:06:18] says um and there's where you hold on to
[1:06:21] and if that isn't there you better not
[1:06:23] get married
[1:06:25] that that that tie post that absolute
[1:06:28] you don't have that there then you
[1:06:29] better not get married
[1:06:31] hello somebody
[1:06:33] you better not get married you better
[1:06:35] make sure you got a good top host
[1:06:38] amen amen
[1:06:40] and it takes time to figure out what
[1:06:42] your typos is glory to God all right but
[1:06:46] here you know let's move on uh the
[1:06:48] prophet says this and I want to just
[1:06:50] bring this in this is a little separate
[1:06:52] but I need to inject this just for a
[1:06:54] second it says this in the message why
[1:06:56] he says now you say
[1:06:58] you believe in taking medicine
[1:07:02] uh
[1:07:04] I believe
[1:07:06] in anything
[1:07:07] that helps the human race
[1:07:10] is Godly
[1:07:13] now now this I'm bringing this in from a
[1:07:15] meta system because you have some people
[1:07:16] saying I'm going to take no medicine at
[1:07:18] all I just believe God and that's fine
[1:07:20] I'm not gonna put no straw in your path
[1:07:23] but if I take medicine don't you put no
[1:07:26] straw in my path
[1:07:30] but the prophet makes a very very a good
[1:07:32] statement couple statements here that I
[1:07:33] have underlined I believe anything
[1:07:37] that helps the human race is Godly
[1:07:42] it goes on to say certainly it is
[1:07:44] exactly this tell me what would we do
[1:07:47] today without these clinics in the
[1:07:49] hospitals and so forth certainly I know
[1:07:51] there's some shut behind the door when I
[1:07:54] first start off but where did it all go
[1:07:56] go to says see you got to look at
[1:07:59] anything
[1:08:02] sensible
[1:08:03] I see that I have to underline you got
[1:08:06] to look at anything sensible all right a
[1:08:09] medicine if medicine hospitals are not
[1:08:11] of God they're Antichrist burn them down
[1:08:16] get them out the country sure but it's
[1:08:19] something to help you so he tells us
[1:08:21] that anything we look at we got to look
[1:08:23] at it sensible
[1:08:25] oh help me Lord right here anything we
[1:08:29] look at we got to look at sensible can I
[1:08:32] tell you that amen I feel like over the
[1:08:35] years we have not looked at some things
[1:08:38] accessible
[1:08:41] anything that helps the human race
[1:08:45] is Godly
[1:08:48] uh
[1:08:49] I was thinking on this this statement
[1:08:52] and I just wanted to just drop this
[1:08:54] people throughout the years
[1:08:56] uh have been afraid of using material
[1:08:59] that wasn't
[1:09:01] in the message
[1:09:04] they wouldn't read books if it wasn't
[1:09:10] in the message
[1:09:12] is that all right
[1:09:14] I'm putting quotes around it that's what
[1:09:16] I'm it had to be in the message
[1:09:19] right it had to be what the prophet said
[1:09:21] and if it wasn't the prophet said they
[1:09:23] would go just push it to the side
[1:09:25] anything
[1:09:27] that can help the human race
[1:09:30] is Godly that's what the prophet said
[1:09:36] you know
[1:09:37] um I want to say this real really really
[1:09:40] uh carefully because I know that uh when
[1:09:45] I make a statement like that I I
[1:09:47] our sermons go many places
[1:09:51] yeah but I I I need to just put some
[1:09:53] some some
[1:09:55] some
[1:09:56] uh what you call these things uh
[1:10:00] disclaimers
[1:10:01] first disclaimer is I am preaching
[1:10:07] to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle
[1:10:09] first disclaimer
[1:10:12] second disclaimer I am preaching from my
[1:10:17] experience
[1:10:20] hello somebody
[1:10:23] and uh in my experience uh when I lost
[1:10:27] my jobs one of the jobs I lost a good
[1:10:30] County Job and then I end up going into
[1:10:32] a job working for a mega church as the
[1:10:36] uh I.T manager and you know you everyone
[1:10:38] behind I didn't even I never even
[1:10:40] applied a head hunter came and got me
[1:10:42] for that job
[1:10:44] and uh told me that somebody looked they
[1:10:46] looking for somebody with the same
[1:10:47] skills that you got to say who says a
[1:10:49] church in the area what church I don't
[1:10:51] even know no church to look at me look
[1:10:53] me nobody like that and they told me the
[1:10:55] name of the church I said oh yeah they
[1:10:57] might be needing somebody like that
[1:10:59] and here I'm coming in from the outside
[1:11:01] I don't even attend the church but I'm
[1:11:03] coming in from the outside and I'm going
[1:11:04] there to that environment and um and not
[1:11:07] knowing that God wanted to expose me to
[1:11:09] certain things
[1:11:11] oh come on somebody
[1:11:13] you got I mean their Ministry was built
[1:11:15] in certain areas and they didn't have
[1:11:16] all the words that we had but they did
[1:11:18] have some things right
[1:11:21] well one of the things that I learned as
[1:11:23] a minister is that I need to I need to
[1:11:25] build in rest into my schedule
[1:11:28] I need to build in vacations into my
[1:11:30] schedule and not just be running hard
[1:11:32] all the time I need to make sure that I
[1:11:34] I honor my family sometimes they taught
[1:11:37] me that type of stuff
[1:11:38] [Applause]
[1:11:39] hello somebody they taught me things
[1:11:42] about marriage that I didn't know
[1:11:45] things that I could apply to my own
[1:11:47] marriage and now I can also give that to
[1:11:48] the people
[1:11:49] but I preach from my experience and what
[1:11:52] I learned and my brother Brandon told us
[1:11:54] some say you know when you when you run
[1:11:56] into uh a situation like that and you
[1:11:59] eating chicken you don't have to eat the
[1:12:01] bone
[1:12:02] right you don't have to either just
[1:12:03] throw the bones to the side but keep
[1:12:05] eating chicken hello somebody I mean the
[1:12:08] prophetology things but we we didn't do
[1:12:10] it the way the prophet taught us to do
[1:12:12] it so I learned that you can you don't
[1:12:14] you don't have to necessarily put
[1:12:15] everything to the side everything that
[1:12:18] anything that helps the human race is
[1:12:20] Godly
[1:12:23] now I think you also got to be careful
[1:12:25] about just going out there reading
[1:12:27] anything and everything
[1:12:29] so let me let me also put this
[1:12:31] disclaimer when you uh reading something
[1:12:34] secular
[1:12:38] filter it
[1:12:41] filter it
[1:12:43] through the message
[1:12:47] and see when you can filter it through
[1:12:49] the message then you know you're
[1:12:50] standing on something and some of the
[1:12:53] things I'm going to share with you today
[1:12:54] we're going to filter it I'm gonna give
[1:12:56] you uh I'm gonna I'm gonna give you two
[1:12:59] things secular and nominal Christian
[1:13:02] views
[1:13:04] but I'ma also give you the message so
[1:13:07] you can filter the secular nominal
[1:13:09] Christian view
[1:13:13] cause anything
[1:13:15] that helps the human race
[1:13:20] is Godly
[1:13:22] and what I mean by that is from God
[1:13:25] it can help you all right we ready
[1:13:31] early this year I was asked next uh I
[1:13:34] was asked to come to a
[1:13:41] I was in in Arizona I was asked to speak
[1:13:44] on this topic of happiness for marriage
[1:13:48] and um so as I meditated on this in the
[1:13:51] scripture that they were using was there
[1:13:53] the one on screen it's Proverbs 17 22 it
[1:13:56] says a merry heart doeth good like a
[1:13:58] medicine
[1:13:59] but a broken Spirit Drive the bones and
[1:14:02] from here the merry heart is where they
[1:14:04] got the happiness from and and the past
[1:14:06] asked me just to kind of speak of
[1:14:08] happiness you know for the marriage and
[1:14:09] that was just the topic so I said okay
[1:14:11] Lord You're gonna have to help me with
[1:14:13] this I've never really actually my first
[1:14:15] time ever really speaking for uh
[1:14:17] a couple's thing outside of our church
[1:14:19] it was the first time I've ever done
[1:14:21] anything like that so I said um Lord you
[1:14:24] got to help me so God gave me a little
[1:14:25] quote here that I got here on the screen
[1:14:27] uh it says out of the message why now
[1:14:31] sometimes in taking medicine
[1:14:33] sometimes the medicine medicine he says
[1:14:37] it's good the Bible says a mere heart
[1:14:39] does good like medicine notice but
[1:14:41] sometimes medicine won't always work the
[1:14:43] same on the person
[1:14:49] medicine is good
[1:14:51] but medicine won't always work the same
[1:14:54] on the person
[1:14:56] you have to take a chance
[1:14:58] on that
[1:14:59] now
[1:15:01] um
[1:15:02] what what I want you to get just leave
[1:15:04] that there for a second what I want you
[1:15:05] to get from this is that
[1:15:08] um
[1:15:09] you got to learn how people think how
[1:15:11] people feel
[1:15:12] you got to learn how to communicate in
[1:15:15] relationships right because what may
[1:15:18] work best for you may not work best for
[1:15:20] your spouse
[1:15:22] all right and and what may work best for
[1:15:25] you and your spouse may not work for
[1:15:27] your children
[1:15:28] and you got to learn how to communicate
[1:15:30] what we call love languages
[1:15:34] right and and I learned this just just
[1:15:37] in my own work
[1:15:39] um experience I had two employees that I
[1:15:42] was managing and uh and and the one guy
[1:15:44] man he came to me and he says uh Jack
[1:15:48] you're just not concerned about nothing
[1:15:50] I do I just feel so undervalued here you
[1:15:53] never say anything about what I do and I
[1:15:55] didn't know what the guy was doing
[1:15:57] honestly I mean I see some of the big
[1:15:59] things but he really wanted me to to
[1:16:01] focus on the small things that he was
[1:16:02] doing because it was little small things
[1:16:04] that he was doing in order to get
[1:16:06] himself prepared for the big things so
[1:16:07] you know big things I was always
[1:16:09] celebrating with him but he's like you
[1:16:10] just you just don't know what I'm doing
[1:16:11] you have no idea what I'm doing I said
[1:16:13] okay this guy's right so I said you know
[1:16:15] what I'm gonna do I'm gonna have a
[1:16:17] meeting with you every week at such and
[1:16:20] such a time we're gonna call that time
[1:16:22] on schedule we're going to meet every
[1:16:23] week and and I'm gonna let you sit down
[1:16:24] and just share with me some of the
[1:16:26] projects that you're working on and he
[1:16:27] was so happy that he can come to my my
[1:16:29] desk uh every Tuesday at whatever time
[1:16:32] 10 o'clock in the morning he just shared
[1:16:34] all his heart with me for an hour and I
[1:16:36] just sit there and just absorb it good
[1:16:38] job good job great job man that's
[1:16:42] awesome man I really appreciate you I'm
[1:16:44] glad to have you on the team just going
[1:16:46] on and so I said you know this working
[1:16:48] very well for him so I went to the other
[1:16:50] guy my team said hey man you know what
[1:16:52] uh I'm gonna meet with you every Tuesday
[1:16:54] at at 12 o'clock or at two o'clock it
[1:16:58] says okay he come to our office and he
[1:17:00] ain't got nothing to say
[1:17:02] and he just sitting there looking at me
[1:17:04] and I'm looking at him and then he
[1:17:06] finally say Jack I I don't do I don't
[1:17:09] work like that and and it's really hard
[1:17:12] for me to meet with you every week like
[1:17:14] this
[1:17:15] I said you know what
[1:17:16] I can't treat him the same way I'm
[1:17:20] treating this guy I got to realize they
[1:17:23] they do things differently and I got to
[1:17:25] find something that works for him so his
[1:17:27] I get I mean with this Gary but this guy
[1:17:29] say I meet with you once a month
[1:17:32] and you know what that was very
[1:17:33] effective for him this other guy needed
[1:17:35] weekly attention and you got to be able
[1:17:37] to understand what people's different
[1:17:39] needs are
[1:17:41] in your family there's gonna be
[1:17:43] different needs
[1:17:45] all your children are different
[1:17:49] even twins
[1:17:51] [Applause]
[1:17:52] are different
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:58] so you have to understand if sometimes
[1:18:01] you see a breakdown of communication in
[1:18:02] the family is because we don't
[1:18:04] understand these differences
[1:18:06] you see medicine won't always work the
[1:18:09] same on the person
[1:18:11] so you got to be able to kind of
[1:18:13] figure out what you're working with
[1:18:15] figure out their personalities and then
[1:18:17] try to minister on that personality on
[1:18:19] that level that personality
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:30] let me just before I go further
[1:18:33] since I was giving this job at this mega
[1:18:36] church and see everybody ain't got that
[1:18:38] same testimony everybody worked there to
[1:18:40] make a church but I did
[1:18:42] I did I needed to pay bills I needed a
[1:18:46] job God gave me a job at a mega church
[1:18:49] I worked there
[1:18:51] and there are tools that I learned just
[1:18:54] because they focused on on Ministry and
[1:18:55] marriage and stuff like that there were
[1:18:57] tools that I that I gained from there
[1:18:59] that uh I still apply today one of them
[1:19:02] a man if if you were in a and a husband
[1:19:05] and wife going through a difficult time
[1:19:07] maybe they arguing and fussing about
[1:19:08] something before you say the wrong thing
[1:19:11] because because uh oftentimes when your
[1:19:15] your emotions get so high you end up
[1:19:17] letting them out of your mouth and let
[1:19:19] me tell you something when you let it
[1:19:20] out your mouth sorry is not good enough
[1:19:26] sorry is accepted
[1:19:28] but it don't change anything
[1:19:31] you a lot of a lot of times we feel if I
[1:19:33] say sorry you ought to just drop it you
[1:19:36] don't understand what you just did to me
[1:19:39] you don't understand how that impacted
[1:19:41] me so I mean you want to get to the
[1:19:43] point where you don't have to say sorry
[1:19:46] your actions were different you you you
[1:19:48] control yourself you didn't say
[1:19:50] something so so often
[1:19:53] you know off the chain
[1:19:55] you're gonna say something so bad that
[1:19:57] you had to go back and say sorry you
[1:19:59] didn't act in a way when you had to
[1:20:01] apologize
[1:20:03] so you got to get control of yourself
[1:20:06] you know the story the story the story
[1:20:09] is told of the little boy that couldn't
[1:20:11] get control of his temper
[1:20:13] and his daddy
[1:20:14] tells his son he said he said Dad I know
[1:20:16] I got a bad tip I need to work on this
[1:20:18] Dad he said okay son I'll tell you what
[1:20:20] you do every time your temper gets out
[1:20:23] of control I want you to take a nail go
[1:20:26] to the backyard to the fence and take a
[1:20:28] nail and drive it through the fence
[1:20:30] every time you attempt to get out your
[1:20:32] driving nail through the fence son he
[1:20:34] that boy was going day after day
[1:20:36] sometimes multiple times a day driving
[1:20:38] nails in the fence they say now he's
[1:20:40] saying my son when you get control of
[1:20:42] your temper I want you to go and take
[1:20:44] that nail art defense
[1:20:46] that boy was getting control of his
[1:20:48] temper like boy pulling the nails out
[1:20:50] you're like oh I responded better Daddy
[1:20:52] Daddy I really got the hang of this he
[1:20:55] got every nail out the fence
[1:20:59] and he was so happy to tell his daddy
[1:21:01] dad I got the last man alive defense I
[1:21:02] got control over these things hey son
[1:21:04] I'm so happy I'm so happy for you but
[1:21:06] son do me a favor
[1:21:09] look
[1:21:11] at the fence
[1:21:15] the damage that's been done
[1:21:17] I cannot fix it
[1:21:25] so you want to get to the point where
[1:21:26] you're not driving nails into a fix
[1:21:30] I learned that before you get that far
[1:21:33] maybe what you need to do is Park some
[1:21:35] conversations
[1:21:37] let's put that conversation in the
[1:21:40] parking lot
[1:21:42] and when you put in a parking lot now it
[1:21:44] can't stay in the parking lot you have
[1:21:47] to establish a time that you're going to
[1:21:49] go get that situation out the parking
[1:21:51] lot we're going to meet at this time on
[1:21:53] this day and we're going to talk about
[1:21:54] this
[1:21:58] we're going to get it out in the parking
[1:22:00] lot
[1:22:01] sometimes we got a lot of stuff in the
[1:22:03] parking lot but you need to go establish
[1:22:05] a day to get that you can't get them all
[1:22:07] out the parking lot in the same day but
[1:22:09] go get this one out the parking lot
[1:22:11] today
[1:22:12] I learned that
[1:22:14] I learned about the five love languages
[1:22:18] I learned to subscribe to daily
[1:22:20] devotions on marriage see now in the in
[1:22:23] the message we get quotes for the day we
[1:22:25] do
[1:22:26] hello
[1:22:28] but we don't get things that focus on
[1:22:30] our marriage
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] my wife and I and I fell off the wagon
[1:22:39] list but my wife and I used to do daily
[1:22:41] devotions together and I fell off the
[1:22:42] way I gotta get back on the wagon
[1:22:45] but we would do that together these are
[1:22:46] things that help build our communication
[1:22:48] in our marriage
[1:22:52] I
[1:22:54] told you I want to use some material
[1:22:56] because anything
[1:22:57] that can help the human race is Godly
[1:22:59] this next thing I went and just found
[1:23:01] this on the internet 10 things Christian
[1:23:02] wives want from their husbands 10 things
[1:23:05] Christian wives want from their husbands
[1:23:07] the first one is a wife wants love
[1:23:12] sacrificial unconditional love is what a
[1:23:15] wife looks for from her husband
[1:23:17] the next thing that a wife wants from
[1:23:19] her husband is
[1:23:21] attention
[1:23:25] she wants to be listened to
[1:23:27] to know that what she has to say is
[1:23:29] important to you
[1:23:34] and also they say a wife wants
[1:23:36] conversation from their spouse
[1:23:38] and I used to use this one all the time
[1:23:39] I was wrong but I used to use it this is
[1:23:42] a way for me not to have to have those
[1:23:44] conversations with my wife but I would
[1:23:45] tell her you know they say that a uh a
[1:23:51] man has
[1:23:52] 5 000 words in this vocabulary every day
[1:23:55] and a woman has ten thousand words in
[1:23:57] other vocabulary a day and uh when I go
[1:24:00] to work and I'm talking to this guy that
[1:24:02] want to talk to him about all his
[1:24:03] projects and then I'm talking to this
[1:24:05] person I'm talking when I come home my
[1:24:07] words are limited and I used to hide
[1:24:10] behind that
[1:24:11] my words are limited so that's why you
[1:24:13] only get
[1:24:15] yep that is not conversation let me tell
[1:24:18] you something when you were courting
[1:24:23] you weren't on the phone talking though
[1:24:34] when you record you had a lot to say
[1:24:38] yeah you was wooing asking about a day
[1:24:41] and asking about all kinds of things all
[1:24:43] of a sudden you got married and lost all
[1:24:45] your words
[1:24:46] you're gonna have to get them back some
[1:24:48] kind of way
[1:24:50] a woman needs attention
[1:24:52] that's how you want them because you
[1:24:53] gave her attention a woman needs
[1:24:56] protection
[1:24:58] amen they they want the husband to be
[1:25:00] the defender of the family a woman needs
[1:25:03] security and commitment all right now
[1:25:06] I'm going to let you know that I told
[1:25:08] you I'm going to pass some of this
[1:25:09] through a filter I wasn't I didn't do
[1:25:11] all of them because of the time
[1:25:12] constraints but uh this is still a work
[1:25:14] in progress but some of these I'm gonna
[1:25:16] show you quotes that actually go right
[1:25:17] along with what these people are saying
[1:25:20] all right here come a filter just wait
[1:25:22] another thing that a woman needs is
[1:25:24] appreciation and value
[1:25:27] amen wives want to know that they are
[1:25:30] beautiful in their husband's eyes
[1:25:37] oh
[1:25:39] she get compliments from everybody
[1:25:42] but you
[1:25:45] wives want to know that they're
[1:25:46] beautiful in their husband's eyes so if
[1:25:48] appreciation value another thing uh

[1:30:51] chocolate

[1:30:58] because I'm gonna give you a quote
[1:31:02] brother Brandon talk about bringing home
[1:31:03] some candy to your wife
[1:31:08] what's going on
[1:31:12] this love brother random says this and
[1:31:14] the cancer of Redeemer says yesterday
[1:31:16] morning we got we were lying in the bed
[1:31:18] a little late
[1:31:19] children didn't have to go to school and
[1:31:21] we got to spending we got to speaking
[1:31:23] about different things and how what was
[1:31:25] hatred I said hatred had a beginning so
[1:31:27] it has to have an end love had no
[1:31:29] beginning so it has no end hatred is
[1:31:31] forever love is eternal hatred begins
[1:31:33] and hatred will end love never did begin
[1:31:37] and it never will end see it's eternal
[1:31:40] it says that When a Man Loves a Woman
[1:31:42] and marries her because she's just
[1:31:43] pretty there will be an end to that
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] amen and your wife them had these kids
[1:31:52] your kids and now you tell them how she
[1:31:54] don't look like
[1:31:57] when we got married
[1:32:00] right you don't either
[1:32:04] and I had children what's your excuse me
[1:32:13] When a Man Loves a Woman a man and
[1:32:15] marries her because she just she's just
[1:32:18] pretty
[1:32:19] they're being into that but when a man
[1:32:21] finds a woman that he loves he don't
[1:32:24] know why but he loves her and she finds
[1:32:26] the man that she loved no matter what he
[1:32:29] looks like
[1:32:31] he loves her she loves him that's an
[1:32:34] eternal mate
[1:32:35] in glory
[1:32:37] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[1:32:39] them because they are from eternity and
[1:32:41] they step out into a space of time and
[1:32:44] we return back to Eternity
[1:32:46] eternity has dropped down in a body
[1:32:48] called time then it goes right back up
[1:32:50] into eternity again it cannot perish
[1:32:54] what Miranda tells us about that love
[1:32:56] this other statement that he gives us a
[1:32:58] man in looking at this uh security and
[1:33:01] commitment that a wife needs brother
[1:33:03] random says this of faith in the Son of
[1:33:05] God it says oh perhaps I don't say I
[1:33:08] have it I have its cause but maybe there
[1:33:11] might have been one more girl in the
[1:33:12] world that I could have married
[1:33:15] but you know I found the lady that I
[1:33:17] really love
[1:33:18] and I asked her if she thought that much
[1:33:20] of me amen she said yes so we got
[1:33:24] married and I told her now look all my
[1:33:27] love I give to you no matter what other
[1:33:29] women are and uh that woman has my that
[1:33:32] woman has my love perhaps I go down the
[1:33:35] street and here comes a more attractive
[1:33:37] girl than my wife and she says Oh Billy
[1:33:40] I really love you with all my heart
[1:33:42] now the first place
[1:33:45] if she has a love for me is bound to be
[1:33:48] false
[1:33:51] I was just there she just said so no no
[1:33:54] no you that's a lie from hell that's the
[1:33:56] devil anointing that lady
[1:34:00] if she has the love for me it's bound to
[1:34:03] be false because my first Duty
[1:34:07] is to what I pledge to my wife
[1:34:10] that's her first I've got to think of
[1:34:13] her first she's my first I told her I'd
[1:34:16] give her all my love and then my first
[1:34:19] duty is to my wife
[1:34:22] I said now look sister
[1:34:24] you're just infatuated and this is the
[1:34:27] problem people don't know what an
[1:34:28] infatuation is and what love is they
[1:34:31] actually thinking infatuation is love
[1:34:34] no you living in a fairy tale
[1:34:37] but when real life strike you'll see
[1:34:39] what really love is
[1:34:42] right amen it says later you're just
[1:34:45] infatuated or something because you're
[1:34:47] not in love
[1:34:49] seeing I'm not in love with you because
[1:34:51] I love one woman
[1:34:53] and that's the mother
[1:34:55] of my children
[1:34:57] see that's my first Duty
[1:35:01] your wife needs that secure that
[1:35:03] commitment for you to be able to stand
[1:35:04] up and tell a woman
[1:35:06] you infatuated you got a spirit on you
[1:35:10] because my first Duty I made a pledge I
[1:35:13] ran into this lady years ago I ran into
[1:35:15] her and I could I couldn't live without
[1:35:17] him
[1:35:18] that's my first Duty
[1:35:22] and I still can't live without it
[1:35:26] all right
[1:35:29] your wife needs appreciation and value
[1:35:31] now this this this the scripture that
[1:35:33] says who's so fond of the wife
[1:35:37] findeth a good thing and obtain a favor
[1:35:40] from the Lord
[1:35:42] so when you get away I actually I ask
[1:35:45] this question in the men's meeting how
[1:35:46] many brothers want some favor from God
[1:35:49] single Brothers single Brothers how many
[1:35:51] single Brothers want baby from a guy
[1:35:53] I ain't no single Brothers in here all
[1:35:55] right I got one over here you want favor
[1:35:56] from God favor favor from God I want
[1:36:00] God's faith favor ain't Fair
[1:36:04] you want favor
[1:36:08] get yourself together
[1:36:13] and get yourself a wife
[1:36:18] because you can't bring the wife into
[1:36:19] the place where you need to get yourself
[1:36:20] together
[1:36:22] so get yourself together
[1:36:25] and get yourself a whack
[1:36:27] you got you'll get favor from God
[1:36:31] this quote says in Jehovah Jireh part
[1:36:33] three Brotherhood says I hope that every
[1:36:36] young man here
[1:36:38] when he gets married he'll get a wife
[1:36:41] and you look as happy together as wife
[1:36:43] and I have as I have these 22 years that
[1:36:46] I that we've been married
[1:36:48] he he who has found a wife found a good
[1:36:51] thing and Solomon and Solomon said a
[1:36:52] good woman is a jewel in a man's crown
[1:36:54] and unrighteous one is water in his
[1:36:57] blood and his blood streams his life so
[1:36:59] an unrighteous one and is the worst
[1:37:01] thing he can get a hold of
[1:37:04] you better make sure you're married
[1:37:05] Christian Somebody Loved God and love
[1:37:09] this message
[1:37:10] amen amen because if you get on you get
[1:37:14] a hold of one that ain't there you go
[1:37:15] you just married trouble
[1:37:17] and I'm talking about years of trouble
[1:37:19] years
[1:37:21] you can't see no end to the trouble
[1:37:24] but you know what that's a that's that's
[1:37:26] a mistake you made
[1:37:28] because you you stepped into it the
[1:37:29] wrong way
[1:37:31] amen
[1:37:32] well I think I can win her over
[1:37:37] you know what she thinking
[1:37:40] she's thinking the same thing you
[1:37:41] thinking you think you can win whole but
[1:37:44] she thinking she can win you over
[1:37:47] all right amen
[1:37:50] wait till they already established
[1:37:53] before you go
[1:37:55] start trying to test out or figure out
[1:37:57] what's you know if there's anything
[1:37:58] there wait till they established in
[1:38:00] Christ
[1:38:01] amen best thing you can have as a mate
[1:38:04] that's established in Christ because
[1:38:06] trouble coming
[1:38:08] and you gotta have a typos and that
[1:38:11] typos they got you got to know that they
[1:38:13] love God and so if they got the Holy
[1:38:15] Ghost when they hear the word the the
[1:38:17] word has a way of melting their heart
[1:38:19] amen but if they don't have the Holy
[1:38:22] Ghost you can say whatever you want to
[1:38:24] say they ain't changing and you're going
[1:38:27] to be married to that problem
[1:38:30] all right
[1:38:35] a good woman's a jewel in a man's crown
[1:38:37] and unrighteous one is warden's blood
[1:38:38] and his bloodstream is his life so an
[1:38:41] unrighteous one is the worst thing that
[1:38:42] he can get a hold of and a righteous one
[1:38:44] is the best thing he can get a hold of
[1:38:45] outside of Salvation if God could have
[1:38:47] given man a better thing than a wife he
[1:38:49] would have given to him my God what a
[1:38:52] statement because God just gives his
[1:38:54] children good things
[1:38:56] and he gave him a wife and I'm thankful
[1:38:59] for it brother random through this
[1:39:00] statement is showing his appreciation
[1:39:02] and his value for his wife
[1:39:07] won't respect
[1:39:11] Ephesians 5 28 29 says so all men that
[1:39:15] love their wives that's their own bodies
[1:39:17] he that love with his wife loves himself
[1:39:18] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:39:21] but nourish and cherish it even as the
[1:39:23] Lord the church in this message my life
[1:39:25] story brother Branham says so but now a
[1:39:28] good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown
[1:39:29] she should be honored a a good woman
[1:39:33] should be honored my mother's a woman my
[1:39:36] wife is and their lovely
[1:39:38] and I've got thousands of Christian
[1:39:40] sisters who I highly respect he says if
[1:39:45] they can respect what God made them a
[1:39:48] motherhood and a real queen that's all
[1:39:50] right she's one of the best things that
[1:39:52] God could give a man was a wife besides
[1:39:54] salvation a wife is the best thing if
[1:39:57] she's a good wife but if she isn't
[1:39:59] Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in
[1:40:01] a man's Crown but an ornery one a good
[1:40:03] one is watering his blood and that's
[1:40:05] right it's the it's the worst he says
[1:40:08] it's the worst thing can happen so a
[1:40:11] good woman if you got a good wife
[1:40:13] brother you ought to respect her
[1:40:15] with the highest
[1:40:18] if you got a good wife
[1:40:20] you ought to respect her
[1:40:22] with
[1:40:24] the highest
[1:40:26] that's right you should do that a real
[1:40:28] woman and a child if you got a real
[1:40:30] mother that stays home and tries to take
[1:40:31] care of you keeping your clothes clean
[1:40:33] send you to school teaching you about
[1:40:34] Jesus you should honor that sweet old
[1:40:37] mother with all that's in you you should
[1:40:39] respect that woman yes sir because she's
[1:40:42] a real mother
[1:40:44] mama need to be respected and as wives
[1:40:47] she need to be respected and the kids
[1:40:50] need to see you respect the name Mama
[1:40:54] you calling your wife all kind of names
[1:40:57] outside of
[1:40:58] who she really is
[1:41:01] in front of your kids you disrespecting
[1:41:03] her
[1:41:05] oh no you didn't use the word stupid you
[1:41:07] didn't use that word
[1:41:09] you didn't call your wife stupid
[1:41:14] Joe
[1:41:16] in the Book of Job
[1:41:18] when he when he when his wife came to
[1:41:19] him and said you ought to curse God and
[1:41:21] die job said this he says not you you
[1:41:24] you talking
[1:41:27] like
[1:41:29] the foolish women you know we man you
[1:41:32] don't have this conversation you know we
[1:41:34] don't talk about how foolish women talk
[1:41:35] you talking like
[1:41:38] the foolish women now he didn't say
[1:41:40] you're a fool
[1:41:44] that's not what he said he said you
[1:41:46] talking like a foolish woman it's a big
[1:41:50] difference in being you are a foolish
[1:41:52] woman
[1:41:53] then you talking like one of the foolish
[1:41:55] women
[1:41:59] respect your wife
[1:42:01] with what you say out your mouth
[1:42:06] and why is you respect your husbands too
[1:42:10] but what you say at your mouth
[1:42:12] what you mean by you're going to be just
[1:42:14] like your daddy
[1:42:17] what you mean by that what you're saying
[1:42:20] really about them
[1:42:33] now I move on I got it got quiet I know
[1:42:41] pause for a fact
[1:42:54] I heard a preacher say brother smile
[1:42:56] said I ain't scared
[1:42:57] I ain't either
[1:43:00] and I know what I'm standing on
[1:43:05] your wife needs affection
[1:43:07] affection series affection brother
[1:43:09] Branham said in the message time tested
[1:43:11] memories of God and I was talking about
[1:43:13] men losing their affection for their
[1:43:17] wife
[1:43:19] and don't love them as they did when
[1:43:22] they were sweethearts
[1:43:23] look at what the prophet says
[1:43:26] shame
[1:43:28] on you
[1:43:31] it says you ought to do it she's always
[1:43:34] your sweetheart absolutely that's the
[1:43:37] part she should be and you should treat
[1:43:39] her like that oh never let that little
[1:43:42] honeymoon cease
[1:43:45] because it isn't going to in heaven
[1:43:50] it's going to be just perfectly one
[1:43:52] there that's right
[1:43:54] so don't let the honeymoon cease your
[1:43:56] wife needs your affection
[1:43:59] amen amen and that affection again is
[1:44:03] just being cuddled sometimes and just uh
[1:44:06] treat it tenderly my wife told me she
[1:44:08] said sometimes I just want you to just
[1:44:10] come into the house and just give me a
[1:44:12] kiss
[1:44:14] just you can kiss female head just give
[1:44:16] me a kiss let me know I'm here
[1:44:22] is that hard
[1:44:24] is it hard to hold your wife's hand
[1:44:26] because it wasn't when you was courting
[1:44:27] but I'm telling nah that you've been
[1:44:29] married all day is it hard to hold her
[1:44:31] hand is it hard just to kiss on the
[1:44:33] cheek or just give a little kiss
[1:44:42] she needs your affection and then if she
[1:44:44] will she be pushing away from me she
[1:44:46] doing that because she want to be chased
[1:44:57] she want to be pursued
[1:44:59] and you so frustrated she don't wanna I
[1:45:03] just
[1:45:06] and that's why you're having the problem
[1:45:08] that you're having you have to if you
[1:45:09] want to see something different
[1:45:14] you're gonna have to do something then
[1:45:21] I put that she wanted what they said
[1:45:23] that your wife still want chocolate and
[1:45:25] candy I put candy because look at what
[1:45:26] brother random say here
[1:45:28] and what what um
[1:45:32] it makes a statement that wasn't so from
[1:45:35] the beginning
[1:45:35] it says not long ago we were going
[1:45:38] together across the country and he said
[1:45:41] he said brother Brandon you know my wife
[1:45:44] don't believe in this the message
[1:45:48] pretty much right so and every night
[1:45:50] when I go to church and come home
[1:45:52] I said oh she just starts bawling me out
[1:45:54] when I hit the door and saying I get
[1:45:56] hurt by the end
[1:45:58] she's little and and hold her and I try
[1:46:01] to cast that devil out as hard as I can
[1:46:08] remind me of your message this morning
[1:46:10] says said I try to cast The Devil out I
[1:46:13] said devil you come out of my way
[1:46:15] whatever you come out of my way honey
[1:46:17] you possessed with the devil come out of
[1:46:19] that devil
[1:46:23] and look at what a prophet tell this man
[1:46:25] it's although I said that's fine brother
[1:46:27] fandler but you go at it the wrong way
[1:46:31] he said well how do you do it
[1:46:34] brother man says when you come home buy
[1:46:36] her a box of candy
[1:46:39] give it a hug when you come home
[1:46:42] uh and at the door next thing he says
[1:46:45] put your arms around her so that's the
[1:46:47] way you cast out a devil love cast out
[1:46:50] love cast out doesn't love and he's
[1:46:52] saying say buy her some candy because
[1:46:54] brother Brandon you know you know we
[1:46:56] know that the holy spirit is is is is is
[1:46:58] is is is uh Discerning kind of what this
[1:47:01] latest needs are you know what her needs
[1:47:04] were you know how this man could get his
[1:47:05] wife to go to church oh Lord have mercy
[1:47:08] Jesus you want to know how the man could
[1:47:09] get his wife to go to church
[1:47:12] a box of candy
[1:47:15] and a hug
[1:47:18] not not deep revelation
[1:47:21] a box of candy
[1:47:23] and a hug brought his wife to church
[1:47:27] oh Lord have mercy you see the Bob
[1:47:30] actually tells us it's the small
[1:47:33] foxes
[1:47:35] that that spoil the vine right it's
[1:47:38] little things that we're missing that
[1:47:39] actually cause all the big problems that
[1:47:41] we have but if we just get back to doing
[1:47:42] the little things
[1:47:45] we can fix the big things a box of candy
[1:47:49] and a hug
[1:48:01] let me go back to this again I just need
[1:48:03] to remind you all of this
[1:48:06] anything
[1:48:13] that helps the human race
[1:48:17] is Godly
[1:48:19] the other thing is you need to look at
[1:48:22] anything
[1:48:26] sensibly
[1:48:31] we read the scripture
[1:48:33] in Ephesians 5 it says so make
[1:48:35] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:48:36] God and I say how we do this how do we
[1:48:39] do this you know what does this really
[1:48:41] look like when you look at the scripture
[1:48:42] and I brought in
[1:48:44] um this uh the five love languages I
[1:48:48] brought that in to us and and this is
[1:48:50] what the five love languages are Gary
[1:48:52] Chapman Dr Gary Chapman is a man that
[1:48:54] actually came up with these five love
[1:48:55] languages and many books have been
[1:48:57] written about it many people there's
[1:49:00] there's things all over they have
[1:49:01] conferences all over about these five
[1:49:03] love languages I was exposed to this and
[1:49:06] I tell you I believe I believe it
[1:49:08] actually it does make a difference in
[1:49:11] marriages uh husbands when you submit
[1:49:14] yourself to your wife your wife is
[1:49:16] submitting submitting herself to the
[1:49:18] husband this is one easy way to find how
[1:49:21] to submit it's not just a man bearing
[1:49:24] rule with an iron fist it's not that
[1:49:27] when we're submitting ourselves one
[1:49:28] another we're doing things for each
[1:49:30] other it's acts of service it's
[1:49:32] receiving gifts it's quality time it's
[1:49:36] words of affirmation it's physical touch
[1:49:37] you need to understand what your mates
[1:49:40] love language is they usually have one
[1:49:43] dominant sometimes it might be too
[1:49:45] dominant you need to understand what
[1:49:46] their love language is and you got to
[1:49:48] talk to them their love language
[1:49:50] amen all right don't worry about it
[1:49:52] y'all know me already if you if you
[1:49:54] ain't never heard this before I'm gonna
[1:49:56] filter it
[1:49:58] I'm a filter you ain't got to worry
[1:49:59] about it but if you've never heard of it
[1:50:01] I I'm telling you this is one of those
[1:50:02] things that I for marriages I think it's
[1:50:04] a very it's very very helpful all right
[1:50:06] uh understanding what acts of service is
[1:50:08] understand what receiving gifts and and
[1:50:10] everybody's love language is different
[1:50:12] everybody's medicine is different
[1:50:15] amen even when it comes to your children
[1:50:17] it's good to know what they love
[1:50:18] language is
[1:50:19] everybody medicine is different
[1:50:23] amen amen right but understanding like
[1:50:26] like for me I I learned this about my
[1:50:28] wife because I thought every woman
[1:50:30] wanted wanted flowers
[1:50:32] all the time just bring flowers and I go
[1:50:34] try to get some real flowers
[1:50:36] 60 70 80 you know roses I'm hey my wife
[1:50:40] one day told me to say um
[1:50:44] if you guys I think she asked me how
[1:50:46] much you spent on that
[1:50:48] about 65 70 dollars
[1:50:51] um
[1:50:53] you know she didn't want to hurt my hurt
[1:50:55] my feelings but she's like you know I'ma
[1:50:58] just tell you the rose is gonna die so
[1:51:00] if you're willing to spin
[1:51:03] 70 dollars
[1:51:04] just give it to me
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:17] and so I had to learn it wasn't the
[1:51:19] flowers that was impressive huh just
[1:51:21] give me the money
[1:51:25] she she ain't going to buy my roses
[1:51:28] man she gonna be at some store over

[1:51:38] Outlet on
[1:51:39] all kind of stuff you know but but she
[1:51:41] you know that that's the way she do
[1:51:43] things but I learned that it was that
[1:51:45] wasn't for her but what my wife is
[1:51:47] quality time
[1:51:49] quality of time is what she needed so I
[1:51:51] found ways to spend quality of time with
[1:51:54] her and look let me tell you something I
[1:51:55] I could have used every excuse look I'm
[1:51:57] going to school uh we raising the family
[1:51:59] we got church this many times a week and
[1:52:02] look I just don't have no time
[1:52:04] let me tell you something you always
[1:52:06] make time
[1:52:07] for the things that you really want to
[1:52:09] do
[1:52:12] so you need to get rid of your excuses
[1:52:14] you need to find a way to actually do
[1:52:18] these things for your spouse and your
[1:52:20] spouse is also finding a way to do those
[1:52:21] things for you
[1:52:26] he don't need no more of this because he
[1:52:28] got so much no no no no if that's his
[1:52:30] love language against
[1:52:31] you need to buy some gifts
[1:52:37] you can't tell nobody what their love
[1:52:39] language is you'd inform them you didn't
[1:52:41] make them God did that amen
[1:52:47] let me see what I got here
[1:52:54] okay
[1:52:56] now
[1:52:57] brother Branham actually
[1:52:59] um
[1:53:00] gives us advice even in the message he's
[1:53:04] not using the same terms that Gary
[1:53:06] Chapman used but you will see that the
[1:53:08] same principles are applying in the
[1:53:10] quote watch this quote I have a message
[1:53:12] why are people so tossed about
[1:53:15] a young fella came to me not long ago he
[1:53:17] was a Pentecostal he's seen too many of
[1:53:20] these meetings and he goes in his wife
[1:53:22] is a staunch loser and he said well I
[1:53:23] guess you all went down and shouted last
[1:53:25] night so I guess you're all speaking in
[1:53:27] tongues and doing all this last night he
[1:53:29] got he got out on the fourth got cast I
[1:53:32] cast The Devil out of her I cast The
[1:53:34] Devil out of her since almost a divorce
[1:53:36] case man a fine man uh he come to me and
[1:53:40] he said brother Brandon we're going to
[1:53:42] have a divorce I guess he said I just
[1:53:44] can't get that devil out of her
[1:53:46] I said brother you're going at it the
[1:53:48] wrong way I said when she starts like
[1:53:50] that all
[1:53:51] when she starts out like that say all

[1:54:08] you can do for her

[1:54:16] of service and it's through the active
[1:54:18] service that he's gonna win his wife

[1:54:53] God will take care of the rest of it he
[1:54:55] called me up about two or three weeks
[1:54:56] later said my home is revolutionized
[1:55:00] he said my wife is a different person

[1:57:07] marriages that's that's really all the
[1:57:08] man trying to do and I find that uh what
[1:57:11] he did
[1:57:12] was something that can help a lot of
[1:57:14] people
[1:57:15] and here's the other thing I found

[1:57:28] popular quote everybody always loved
[1:57:30] this quote when it comes to marriages
[1:57:33] but when I went out to Arizona this
[1:57:35] quote is the one that settled me I said
[1:57:37] you know what this quote shows how
[1:57:40] brother Branham used all five love
[1:57:44] languages in one situation
[1:57:52] somebody to say prove that brother Jack
[1:57:53] I got it
[1:57:55] here it is when Divine love is projected
[1:58:03] Sovereign Grace takes its place look at
[1:58:05] what the prophet said I'm coming home
[1:58:07] right here
[1:58:08] in our own home
[1:58:10] and it says try this at your home
[1:58:14] if there was if if there was if there
[1:58:16] ever was a home that's confused and torn
[1:58:19] up much as ours
[1:58:22] people from everywhere all over the
[1:58:23] world coming all the time in and out day
[1:58:26] and night all hours and I have noticed
[1:58:29] here some time ago my lovely little wife
[1:58:31] of 37 years old and completely great she
[1:58:34] stood between me and the public look at
[1:58:36] this if there's any praises to be given
[1:58:40] to the Branham family give it to her
[1:58:44] that's a word of affirmation
[1:58:48] the telephone run you run your wild day
[1:58:51] and night and so the house had been full
[1:58:54] um
[1:58:55] uh a day and I went out and my little
[1:58:57] children little Sarah and Rebecca were
[1:58:59] fighting over some play blocks little
[1:59:01] Joseph the baby sitting in the floor
[1:59:03] screaming to the top of his voice wife
[1:59:05] in the kitchen with her face buried in
[1:59:07] her hands weeping when I finally got the
[1:59:09] house emptied some in this room some in
[1:59:11] that room some in the basement and I
[1:59:13] walked in and I thought oh what a

[1:59:19] around me see she needs to be held she
[1:59:22] put her arms around me she said Billy

[1:59:49] that ain't what the prophet did
[1:59:51] he heard what his wife was going through
[1:59:53] at the moment and he responded next
[1:59:54] quote
[1:59:57] he says and and sometimes raging maniacs
[1:59:59] and saying is and saying it really a
[2:00:01] bunch of sometimes uh sometimes Fanatics
[2:00:04] running back and forth through the house
[2:00:05] saying the Lord said this and the Lord
[2:00:07] said if if if I ain't your manager the
[2:00:10] Lord said this now if the Lord wouldn't
[2:00:12] talk to me about that if he had
[2:00:15] something to say but you can't help it
[2:00:17] it's just in the human line she said the
[2:00:21] children haven't had anything to eat and
[2:00:23] I don't know what to do

[2:01:42] of service

[2:05:28] I know it will
[2:05:40] shall we pray
[2:05:48] father
[2:05:51] you have
[2:05:55] given us commandment through your word
[2:05:56] as husbands
[2:06:00] to love our wives even as Christ also
[2:06:02] loved the church and gave himself
[2:06:03] forward
[2:06:08] sometimes it's a tremendous sacrifice
[2:06:09] but Lord this is what we've been called
[2:06:11] to
[2:06:12] you are the example husband
[2:06:17] father you gave your life for us
[2:06:22] I pray Lord that these are words that we
[2:06:24] will be able to apply
[2:06:25] in our day-to-day life
[2:06:28] ultimately we want to see you get Glory
[2:06:30] and Honor out of our marriages out of
[2:06:32] our families out of our homes we want to
[2:06:34] see you get the glory honor we know the
[2:06:35] devil is is here to try to destroy homes
[2:06:38] that's his job to destroy
[2:06:43] help us to apply the word and stand
[2:06:45] behind the word
[2:06:48] that we would have victory over the
[2:06:50] enemy
[2:06:52] sometimes the lord it's just the little
[2:06:54] things that we leave I'm done
[2:06:57] that creates the big problems that we
[2:06:59] have
[2:07:00] but I trust Lord Jesus said you would
[2:07:02] help us
[2:07:04] to apply these little things
[2:07:10] let the word of God not just go in our
[2:07:12] ears out in one and out the other before
[2:07:16] let the word of God settle in our hearts
[2:07:19] may we take an inventory even today
[2:07:22] see Lord what it is that we can do
[2:07:28] we need you
