a job that I've been dreaming for God has given you job eternal life is your job amen you might say that I'm not a family that I'm looking for God has given you the heavenly family amen the family that you are going to be with you are here with them and you're going to be with them internally so you've been blessed all around God has blessed you or your loved ones have been accounted for in the kingdom of God amen even if you don't see them with his eyes they haven't been accounted for before the foundation of the world it doesn't matter when the God has accounted for them amen because a lot lose that without them being there your joy would know before if God was able to take William Rams a dog and a horse or donkey into the dimension what about your loved ones who are good assume that dog doesn't have it sue the horse doesn't have a sue buy your loved one they have it sue amen and got us accounted for believe for them and you see them amen the Lord is so good and we thank him we just want to speak a little bit just going back from what we we had on the other time Elohim the new myth today we want to caption it Elohim cries and more feet in you amen Elohim is Christ and more feet in us so let's be on our feet read a little portion of the Bible before we go ahead if you want to open to Book of Kings 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 1 to 14 is quite lengthy but we will do it 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 1 to 14 second Kings chapter 2 verse 1 to 14 it came to pass when the Lord would take Elijah into heaven by the whirlwind that Elijah went went with Elijah from gilgul and Elijah said onto Elijah tarry here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to Bethel and Elijah said unto Him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went both to Bethel verse 3 and the sons of the Prophet that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto Him knowest out that the Lord would take away thy master from the head today he said yeah I know it hold your peace and Elisha said unto Him Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets they were at Jericho came to Elijah and said unto Him knowest now that the Lord would take away the master from the head today and he answered yeah I know it hold your peace vs. and Elisha said unto Him Terry I pretty he for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will not leave thee and and the two went on and fifty men of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to you afar off and the two stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle smooth the waters and they were divided heetha and thither I wanted to go to those two ways heathyr NT that means here and there so that the two went over on dry ground and it came to pass that they were gone over that Elijah said to Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of your spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I'm taking from the it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and he came to pass us this thought went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both as sander and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chatter to Israel and a horseman thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and ran them into two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took a mantle of Elijah that for that fell from him and smooth the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters departed hideth Eva and Elijah went over amen shall we be seated [Music] praise be to God God is good yes the lot is wonderful yes so we're gonna talk about Elohim we talk about Elohim Christ in you amen the person of Jesus Christ in you we want to see how we connected to Elohim is he very far from us this is somewhere on another planet and we are here on earth maybe Moon Jupiter Pluto mercury some planet someway we want to find out how God or the Great Creator the grid ll alo him is related to you and I amen the other time we spoke we talked about we look at a human and Composition that basically this human big to have six foot press on all six seven person who is about 350 when he dies and you increment him or her you burn him up it's gonna be one spoonful of ash that's all there is to it amen so on the flesh we do value much if you go to India the brain people when they die it's just about one spoonful of ash now God to this one spoonful of ash as a seed in your mother's womb in your father's loins and put them in your mother's womb to comfort as a baby then you begin to eat a calcium potassium the food that you eat the corn the potatoes the vegetables' they are all the elements that is in your body so you eat them to build your body up to where to gain more weight that is part of the earthly man because God wanted to manifest in this earth so without the ethnic person God cannot manifest in the eighth amen as we sitting here we've got angels around you've got your own guardian angel you've got Christ in you Jesus Christ is here Moses Elijah and other prophet are here in the dimension the celestial dimension but this eye is limited to see about a couple feeds amen but then we've got another eye that is what we want to talk about so this human composition is just about the cosmic light go to cosmic light and then out of the cosmic light we know that Sun was the first gas created the natural things the same with the Son of God the logos the pillar of fire was the first expression of Christ when God began to condescend come lower to the eighth so the Sun out of the Sun came different light God uses a cosmic light to create your body so when you go to hospital sometimes we do what they take your x-ray x-ray is part of the cosmic light we have the carbon hydrogen oxygen potassium phosphorus magnesium and all the elements about 16 of them damage the human body that is to help you to contact it to make contact to the eighth but and that is what every you amen so that is me that is me I'm five foot I'm four foot I'm whatever I weighed this pound yes at least speaking that is you but that is not a true you amen that is just about to contact the eighth and now that's that human body is powered by lesson but let's break it down like battery we have life flashlights some time we put batteries in them to power them to give them lights so this human flesh is powered by a lesson for batteries now in our time or in our generation God in the times of in the old paths that used to live to be 900 Adam was nine that is something right Methuselah was 960 something the almost 1,000 years but this time we don't grow I mean live that long we are given about four batteries to live now when you get to about twenty five the first battery dies of you so strong and kicking you could so jump and do whatever I want to do maybe up to about let's say between forty to fifty the second battery goes off you so go to batteries and it's a good you saw can run and do things you love to do then between let's say 50 unless is 75 for 65 the third battery begin to what dice off then you've got only one battery to leave if you are blessed to be hundred you still go up battery of God's face you to give you two batteries you should go to batteries more to leave so by hundred 115 so it will live up to 120 let's say all this you want to die you pray to die you'll be calling for there to come and take you out because using iPad and text message which you don't have a clue I think I've done all that I want to do take me from this earth so if not even bless you spare your life to be one one-twenty one-fifteen is a lot I don't want what else do I need to do on this planet this planet you want to switch out the dense battery and go to the other side amen and yes just a couple of minutes in the eyes of the Lord because if you take like a thousand years it's just about a day and also the eyes of the Lord so if you live to be 100 and 120 it's just a couple of minutes in the eyes of the Lord amen now this body is just like I said it's just earthly element we drink the body surf is about 75 to 85% of water that's why we need today they advise you to drink about eight cups of it what you call it a day classes of water every day because what I can do more for you than medicine can do so is the aura is part of that we're part of the body system right so that is about this body now when you move to the next room you've got a spirit man which is through in his hand which is help you to walk because your body can be separated from your spirit the body can lie here but if that spirit is not in the body it doesn't talk it doesn't hear it doesn't move it doesn't have a feeling it doesn't speak it doesn't smell it doesn't taste because their spirit and the flesh the flesh is just a clothing just like we wear clothing to be able to appear in public to be able to go outside now this cysteine element is to help you contact the earth because it's part of the earth it's important to God as long as you live here amen now that is part of the body desperate terrain has also got five senses it's got a sense of memory affection reasoning imagination and conscience the Lord Buddha went in there to help you contact the earth to help you remember even now when you call imitation who can remember the food that you ate to 2017 16th August who can tell me I had this type of food you don't even remember the restaurant you win even with that limitation you can remember the food that you ate you can't even know if you remember the place that you were at that time because this spectrum is also limited now we move to the next higher realm yes it's very helpful it helps you to remember dreams sometimes a lot show you dreams which is of eternal value so you have you have a remembrance of that remember your birthday remember your family you remember please that you went to so the Lord blesses with a human spirit to also manifest on this earth now the next room is the zoo which is more important to the Lord amen now being pawned by six there were three people who came by Plaza the original plan of God of course Adam was came from the mouth of God by the spoken word of God now God step Adam down to Eve mrs. Adam she came as what as a hybrid or as a clone from the part of the body of Adam she was loosely speaking white then Jesus who came by the original plan of God to come and redeem us by the spoken word of God it means the theory with him is that you funny he didn't need the Holy Ghost baptism no Jesus was really baptized as a gift on to the world as a sacrifice he was baptized in the river just taught to us a sacrifice unto the world but it wasn't bathtub because he was a sinner amen by you and I needed to be baptized because we were not born right when we were born we were only limited to this earth we are grounded here we can go no further it just like parent grantee our children when children misbehave you are grounded you can't go out you know going to go to the restaurant with me you're not going to go to play you have your choice you only grounded to do your homework so because we are not born right we are grounded on this earth amen bye remember the story of the Good Samaritan before the foundation of the world we were not grounded before the foundation of the world we were part of Christ before the foundation of the world u.s. silesia you were a trainer you were in him you had a very life and thought of Christ remember we read you all that time that the thought of God is not like your thoughts that you plan of a boat building you're gonna build or an architect who plans to build a house now he matches the house in his mind you want to put in there's no more bedrooms for the person you want to do this one to do this he make a blueprint on paper then he translated into reality gas thought is not like that Gaston is real amen in other was when the Bible said that we were in him before the foundation of the world is not like we're sitting on his mind you a beam he were a person you were a trainer you couldn't cry you couldn't die you couldn't even whip you didn't understand what is solo you didn't understand what is death there was nothing like that in that civilization but then for the sake of redemption we had to come here you have to leave that glory and bypass it and come he auntie's death sorrow sickness afflictions suffering just name it all the negatives you can think about depression medication and what-have-you separation just understand Redemption because without that no need of redemption it's like you a human being it would be very surprising for human being crying I want to be a human being definite is that there's something wrong with this guy you already a human being if let's say a dog or fish want to be a human being praying to God Lord why don't you make me a human being you know to end your life like they are doing I'm I'm under the ocean I'm in the water all the time but I see him enemies around I want to be like them but there's no way humanity could be praying to God Lord make me a human being you already a human being angels of God and prayed to for forgiveness of sin they don't know what a son is not part india in the additionally but you and I were born limited on this planet born by the wrong bed sex as we explained that it was a permissible of God sex is what Satan if cross or the serpent if cross so but goddess who come in on cross what was the wrong way that we had so he came to Kaveri look at the X the X is what is perverted but they look at the cross of Calvary is vertical and horizontal so we were kind of stuck in the horizontal earth but in the vertical person the system mention Christ came in and connect with the earth to give the Holy Ghost baptism to bring us back to where we were before the foundation of the world amen praise be to God the Lord is good so that is that is the solution I mentioned that we were before so the new birth is what is restoring us back to where we used to be it just like this repose is here somehow it falls on the floor then I pick it back and restore it back to its original place so the new birth is before the furnish of the world where a person of Christ but then you separate it from that to come to me and redeemed because it was an attribute in you amen way before the foundation of the world the Lord asked who want to go to the eighth face Adam said I'll go is that what I'm going to do I'm going to set up the plan begin their own role rather the plan of redemption so Adam came to the earth as we know Adam was not born as a baby Adam was born just like around 30 year old person he was where he was the first Adam Jesus was the second Adam Jesus began his ministry when he was 30 so that was where Adam was he didn't have a mother physically his father and mother was the pillar of fire was God himself amen now we were not born that way we were born as baby on the ground tried to walk crow on the ground for a while before we walk right because we are limited now Jesus Christ was born as a bit before redemption seek he has to become part of us to be born as a baby although he was one perfect he was born through the few funny yes he was one as a human being because a human being can can't leave a human being amen if somebody falls into the water and you want to rescue the person you can't stand at the bank of the water and rescue them you have to what dive and bring them out sometimes they bite you you so don't even think about it you bring them out because they are not in their mind right the same way God has to dive from eternity deceased dimension to this lowest dimension to come and pick us from here this hell to suffer just like we suffered two footprints to get headaches to get rejection to even die to be modified so that his life eternal life in him that we bypass will come into you and I and that brings us back to where we are amen so the Holy Ghost but brings us back to the original position as sons and daughters of God amen who knows opposed because before a baby is born in the womb the baby doesn't know what goes on its own away but as nas is born the life that God ordained for the baby goes into the baby and the baby give the first year yeah you see suffering what will be scram when they are born who cry one is happy because he was comfortable in the mother's belly now here he is he has to try to breathe oxygen for the first time what kind of world is this well mine so friend begins the afternoon so transplant them to crime right the same thing we were born in sin shipping iniquity and we came to the world suffer and all kind of police upon earth was planned upon you but then God the Good Samaritan who is rich in mercy came down to rescue you to bring you back to where you are amen now when you look at the word when we are reading the scripture Elijah has to go through the Junction's we come to it and I said what Keitha sefa what is a old English word means here and there if you take a word here there here is a GRE the right there is th e re the difference is the T the T is what they feel funny that is a Mason way that is what we bypass instead of coming through it feel funny we came through what the sixth faith that limited as here we couldn't see visions we couldn't see the heavily dimension there was no supernatural in our life yes they feel funny the mind of God Christ Himself knew you that is your very bin amen there's nothing that is not part of creditors go back to Christ you are going back to class or you are in Christ because you are part of him before the foundation of the world amen you had a few funny way before you became a sinner way before the stars were ordained way before the first months in on earth we before adamant if we created you with a very life of Christ amen that is what the Lord wants us to see because sometimes we get the devil make has limited to the earth because we believed live here for ten years twenty years forty years hundred years whatever so all our - about the earth and things that we see we don't think so much about the other side because we don't see with our physical eyes amen just like Thomas when the Lord resurrected and so on the brother said a lot of resurrected so I won't believe it unless I see him in and put my fingers in the nails where he was pierced I would believe it because you want to see spannabis a Caracara you want to see a face to face but in the Lausanne Thomas don't be what a non-believer right the Lord want us to the beam of Christ by the new birth is you is that dimension that is it true you amen when you separate from this flesh you can treat this fictional way it came from the earth it goes out goes back to the earth all the elements all the orders shampoo that you use is not gonna matter all the clothes that you bought all the three pieces of suit whatever shoes whatever just name them they don't go with you you can't get a u-haul to pack your stuff and go with you because because you're not gonna need them that is just the eighth in Maine maybe somebody will inherit them or your house and bodies Anderson we need them well once we are here but then one is separate we are not going to need them now the Lord by the Holy Ghost baptism bring you back to a beam Amen that you're gonna need when you separate from this life and all you need here was you in this life amen that is the person of Jesus Christ Elohim amen so that is what you were before the foundation of the world now Elohim like I said we were part of him we were in him but then when we separated just for the attribute of redemption we went into Amin easier I mean it's a means you don't even know who you are we thought we were part of the world because we were born by the world you're thinking about the best thing is thing to be successful thing to have a future have some success story maybe go to college Buddha house get a job get a profession get married which is good because you're a human being you need them but then the real eternal purpose of God is goes beyond the earthly things that we desire which is good and okie God give them to us but then the more important is what is the heavenly dimension that he puts in you and I by predestination amen because you cannot manifest him without him in you that's what he said begin to preach seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness every other thing we give into you see the Holy Ghost baptism sink rising you make sure that crisis in you know stop at Jericho those two part yoga but go all the way to Jordan Yoda means cross anova Jeremy's new birth Yoda means that death to the old person the old man that we had sittin Lucifer the old book of life the old husband the old soul the old man just name in the old master the control tower that was the person who was permitted to me in us to show the attribute of redemption button at your new birth the pillow fire consumed the blow fire is the holy goose it consumed that person and then Christ is born in you because Christ was in you as his seed form even when we are born in sin but then it wasn't manifested asked as the new person he was protecting you it was direct in your life but then he wasn't manifested but at the appointed time the Word of God our was Odin for you comes to you and because you've got Christ as his city you deep calling for the deep amen Christ connecting to Christ because there was a part of him Elohim as a seed form in you but then by the new birth there's a quickening to take all the a monisha all that you forgot when you became a human being God began to feed you back your memory feed you back to who you were that you are a daughter of Christ you are eternal as goddess Athena you are Celestia's goddess Alicia you can't die asking God cannot die amen now you see how humans die why can't I die well let's look at the scriptures into into is we have scriptures that connected a physical person the human person it is appointed unto man once to die and after that what judgment that is the physical Sistine element that is going to break down the compost on thee or be rapture whatever when you get raptured is gonna break down anyway amen Enoch was raptured but he didn't take this fledged a celestial dimension this year but he dropped his flesh in the cosmos and then went to the Silesia in like the Elijah was ruptured but it isn't a consistent element to the Silesia dimension he dropped into the cosmos into the gases components then they'd feel funny the pillar of fire in him went to the other side amen and then when a poly cup a seven of God I think they killed him when was about to be crucified the pillow finding him spoke out he said Polly cup my seven is coming home amen he turned into like a DAF then became like a ship then he moved to the other side Steven when they were crucifying him Steven yeah he wasn't afraid he was he was he did me food the Silesia there was tuna in the cell sorry the treasure the sustain element they were cast in stone but I like a stone on you're gonna fill it but then the sitting element has a desolation I mentioned has taken taken over so that Alicia does even have a feeling so he was praying for them Lord forgive them don't vote their sins against them that is love divine that is preferred laughs Amen when somebody can offend you somebody can do you bad what are you do good do you pay you fo and from the deep from the sincerity of your heart you pray the Lord forgive them don't cut it against them don't judge them just change them let them see what is what love is amen and that is what the holy good can do for you if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can forgive people can hold grudges for four years or year she needs to me I'm never going to forgive him I'll pay him back I'll pray cases upon him or her because the old person is still there but then when Christ the pillar of fire takes over is forgiven it's lovin his patience is kind is embracing you wish the even lesson I don't want your worst enemy could to be in hell because you're reading hell they are suffering they are going through torment people are not happy they are always angry they already in hell by you what the dimension that is in you you want to impart a dimension you want to impart the Holy Ghost in them so if you come pray for a sinner if you can pray for people that have offended you if you come from your heart forgive those that have done you evil when you did them good it's one good sign that there's something in you amen that's eternity you blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord the Lord is good now we can look at new birth let's read one scripture here by chapter 4 Isaiah chapter 4 remarried to one to six I therefore one to six he said and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man scene we will eat our own bread and we're our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day she had a branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruits of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that I escape of escape of Israel and it shall come to pass that he he that is left in Zion and he'll a dream in it in Jerusalem shall be called holy even everyone - that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lassa have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have preached the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the speed of Benin and the Lord verse 5 and a lot will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke by day and a Shannon of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for the covered from storms and from rain amen he's talking about seven women the women represent a church they will take a hold of one man who is the man Christ almost a lot of people know what want to marry to Christ but now this we have got two groups of women one woman said that Lord we want to be caught by your name hey man we want to be caught by an one who caught mrs. Jesus Christ but then we were on clothing and eat our food in other words we just want to be called Christians so that people see us as Christians but we don't want their name is what it's an identity is the Holy Ghost baptism is Christ in you the apparel the clothing is not a clothing the spiritual uses that the scripture uses the natural things to type the spiritual things so we were closing on the outside the clothing is talking about is the gum and the holy goose on the inside so now the best one those women the seven women when a force women force bride first wife of Christ that they want to what married to Christ just want to call by the name but they don't want to pick on the nature the deity of Jesus Christ in them and that is what a lot of Christianity or for the millions and millions of Christians in the world about 99% and this category they love to go to church they give for charity they do different big things they have big televangelism tell-tell evangelism and outreach overseas and different things but is the deity of Christ are they wearing the clothes of Jesus Christ or they just have the name of a Christian the law doesn't want you and I to be in a position you want you toward to whether clothes the world that is being free to you to take it as a wedding you and what becomes you and you become the weight amen now verse 2 is the branch that the Lord wants us to be the branch of the Lord the branch of the Lord is the one that came from the pillar of fire came from the tree where does a branch come from is part of the tree it branches out to bring the leaves flowers seed and fruits to show the beauty of the tree so we came from Christ amen as a branch we didn't come from from from imagination but we came from the very hot amount of Christ to manifest the glory of the Father here and you cannot do it without the Holy Ghost baptism because it is Christ to manifest Christ amen and you become a tabernacle of God you become a dwelling lise you become the glory the very very glory of Jesus Christ amen if God want to Bluff the devil he can talk that I would I go to West Palm Beach look at my daughter's to ensue look at my son the devil can see Oh your sign because Lord you bless him just like Jew you bless him his God job is God or the money is God house is God wonderful family that's why he loves you so well if you want just take his job you take this job and even he go to church is happy and rejoicing and praising God do whatever you want to do to him because why he's Christ himself amen God can't can't can't bet on you God can not say gamble but if God want to come we can gamble on you amen that you can push my son my daughter to the corner he so loves me because I am him and he's me amen is because of you that the world is consistent if it's not you the world would be blowing to pieces but God has got you on this planet is not finished with you and I and there may be more generations of your kind so the hand of the Lord is resting the Lord has not brought the judgment has already begun do but it does not combinated into the finality because you have toward manifest him on this planet you have to manifest him here on earth before everything comes to an end amen blessed be the name of the Lord now we can look at this new birth in two ways we can look it in a form of death and in a form of birth we're born face like I said by the natural birth through the an act which you're going to read some quotations here now truth at birth we were born as sinners all that we can do is be human beings we don't know nothing about a supernatural now the second birth come and kill the old birth the old book when a bubble's a book is not referring to a book like we think a book is alive like really a book you read something from a book to understand the documents now this is a book is bringing out alive a writing of God amen so you a book Facebook was not original plant plan of God but it was part of the plan of God issue his attributes so he permitted a book to live for whatever yes then it's ended the Lamb's Book of Life which is a true you the Holy Ghost baptism the attend a person they greet Elohim to come and quicken you to kill the old book to consume it out of existence that's why the Bible said that you had justified Santa fide cleanse baptized and you have no son somebody can say oh I know this man he was he was a thief that was caught in the dollar shop he's got a criminal record but before God if you don't have no criminal record because the man that was a thief is dead he does admit as this no more is consumed out of existence it doesn't exist in any dimension so to God you are justified profit class and there's no record of you being a criminal or being a thief but to the world oh yes I know this lady she was a prostitute to the world to God rehab was not a prostitute amen she only came to plead a contrast so that you Joshua means Java salvation can be a severe Amen now that is the the Beth we can look also as a death da-daddy you dive after that the Babu said had died to yourself but Rama she said that yourself how can I die to myself do I take a machete and cut my head no do I go and hang myself no that would not give you the new birth now not take the presence of God but the death is talking about is a supernatural death amen that the old person the old book the old you the old sue the old person that was the old husband the old way that was ruling you limiting you to the earth that pass will be consumed then the new person Christ Himself would take your 16 element and recreated Amen when you are born again you are not the same person I used to be but ROM said that you can take a sauna and a saint a person that has been born by the Holy Ghost Christ is living in them on outward sign Deluca layers they are all cysteine element they all human beings but in the eyes of God even the atoms and the molecules of the body has been recreated that's what the Bible said that you are a new creation when you when you are born again Romans 8:1 there is no condemnation in them that have been taught that are in Christ all the old things have passed everything has become new amen there's a song that I think we know said I'm a new creep I'm a new creation I'm a brand-new man all things they have passed that we have been born again more than a conquerer and as who you are all things they have passed away you be born again so the oceans have passed away the old man is gone and is dead not only divorce programs that don't just divorce him and put him there and go marry him back but make sure that he's dead and gone he doesn't exist no more he doesn't tempt you no more amen let's resume few quotations here I want to take our time the Lord he is good blessed be his holy name let's read Bobby is going to be a lot of lengthy by the help of God we want to just bring it written out so that it ever will not tell you that you are not born again amen you know who you are because God is is not enough knowing who Jesus is he want you to know who you are that you are him amen he wanted to know that he's you he's living in you so that when he says I want to preach when Jesus was in they wanted to stone him right and the Bible said that he vanished how did he vanish tell me did he run away oh please don't throw the stone on me like maybe the tree may hide another puppet when today one of the poppy turns I don't know the stone on me he didn't vanish in da moneh he had a system elements he knew who he was he controlled assistant element he can break it and put it together so when the people were killing him it wasn't the time to be crucified they have grabbed their big stones rocks they're gonna throw him he look into him and he brought the system element out of existence and the pillow find him went to wherever he went to in his home or wherever and he brought it back and created it back amen and that is the eruption feet rapture is in you resurrection is in you the new birth is in you the new heaven and new new earth is in you everything God has made this in you and I want us to read a little bit and just to have a little foundation let's go to invisible Union 1965 November 25th the invisible union of the Bride of Christ paragraph 206 life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book God is the author of life do you believe that our natural our natural life here we have is just a perversion it really should be the right life to begin with but it's pervaded by the natural birth the first life or your first Union you were joining at birth by nature and natural act and natural human being associated man and woman together associated together in sexual birth as we spoke the other time sex sit on or serpent Eve cross which brought your first life here and that is associated with sin and death how can you miss in the second seat now let's jump to paragraph ok Park the next paragraph sebasi the attribute that is in God had to be displayed without being bombed by sex record industry add attributes he was to be a severe and to make everything perfect the way he did it then there could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women we are the end of the road amen in other ways it is not God wasn't surprised it wasn't something like it took God by surprise it and came in out of nowhere and Sheen the program of God no God is the one who created Lucifer and he put him there for a purpose amen that it could be a severe so the professor that don't be children don't think oh why were we born in sin why this why that got it has a purpose for whatever you are going through amen now paragraph two and two now it was a nature associated associated with death your first husband that had over you was your nature by the natural birth naturally you loved the world because you are the world and part of the world that's right your desire was by nature to love the work the world which you are part of you are part of nature you believe that and that's the natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up so another occasion no say no right no of divorcement he dies he dies the nature of the world has to die every speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature your name of your first niche I was born and put in a book of life that is your natural life and all of your dishware roots in a to everything you've done and the damage I was put in the book called the book of life well you separated from the first Union by the spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that Jam that was in you at the beginning found you now your own book is gone with your old union now you your new your name in your old has been transferred now your your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what a lamp redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true gem where your true Eterna gem from the beginning text hood now you are not only forgiven but you are justified glory justify Romans 5:1 yiii Romans 5:1 therefore being justified you have been justified amen got us by the new birth when you I remarried to Christ God give you a marriage certificate what is that my certificate the Holy Ghost baptism just like a man marries a wife and put a wedding ring which is perfect laughs to show that this woman is married to mr. so ensue so no other man can touch her the same way when you are married to Christ God put a seal on you God gives you a marriage marriage certificate written from heaven put in your heart by the Holy Ghost baptism the person of Christ in you that sit on this vessel is mine amen obtain this vessel this daughter of Zion as my daughter of all the thousands and millions of people on around her she's the one of ordina married to her so you cannot touch him amen if Satan brings sickness on you tell your husband in you that's why I don't be afraid Bram said when you pray would you pray to you don't pray to God in the skies you pray to God you amen now would it go see me I've got this pin that everyone - what attack me and I the force has my want to come back I don't want him and then the Holy Ghost in you come out and consume the sickness amen and that is what God want you to know you want you to be where if there's a need for you to walk up on water you just walk up on water amen there's nothing strange about it is part of your life and that's what a lot is bringing is that the supernatural that is in us the lot of things that we see healing of cancer killing of sickness different things Morocco's it's Christ and you manifest and the more we believe the more we eat the Word of God the more we get closer to him the more he manifests this attribute in us blessed be the name of the Lord amen lamb with a little a little coat here that is Christ is revealed in his own word 1965 August 22nd 6 508 2 2 m where paragraph city form when you are born God set a record on you is you don't make put a record on you you don't make much noise for a little while you know that's a little bit so it comes to accountable then the noise start he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and when the life ends and when that life ends the record or the tip is taken off and laid in the great big library of God how are you going to get around it at a judgment bar it's playing right back in front of you every move you made every thought that went through your mind can can you see that now you can see where God is in other words when a baby is born in the natura the baby is blameless it doesn't have no sin now it's a certain age even if he does something wrong goddess and recorded is know who held against the baby now when you get it of accountability there's no fix each that when a baby a child get to ten or twelve or six God deals with people individually maybe somebody could be autistic somebody could be may have sudden disorder that the natural mind is not developed you could even be 16 God knows where to put to begin to hold you accountable but not much when you get that each God begin to when a child does something wrong tell lies six mommy's a coins to buy candy Junior due to the candy no could be my brother we could pass the blame on to another person meanwhile he took it children can't tell lies they don't even think about it now they get rid H of accountability this record is put on them whatever they do is recorded is not like God has got a pen and it ready Oh yesterday you smoked yesterday committed fornication 2000 ago you you you rob a bank that is not a kind of it's a record it's a selection I mention record is there for that I mentioned amen it's on your mind it's on gas mine so when you don't repent and you don't put it under the blood of Jesus Christ to be consumed by the Holy Ghost and you keep on in your sin you keep on doing this evil and sin and live in unbelief only for the devil you let the old husband ruling you when you die in that condition your time on earth is finished your system element goes back to the dust your human spirit is not recreated you don't have God in you now you can't you can't go to the system mention because only Christ that can go to the system nation so you are stuck here in hell condition wave of torment and all that you ever it all the evils that you did it will come before you when people are dying within flash of seeking whatever I did from their life it comes like like a video you see everything that you did on this on this earth and if it's not another blood of Jesus Christ you can't go before the Lord that's why God give everyone a chance on this earth that you hear the gospel at least once in your life that give all your heart to the Lord the world will not benefit you the world will send you to your premature give grief people go to people die know because it's their time to die but because of sin they send themself cut them shot on this earth amen but if you give you a life to God commit your heart to the Lord and you seek fame Lord give me if there's anything that you give me give me the Holy Ghost baptism don't ask for money when God calls you the first thing you want to give you the channel life that you bypass before the foundation of the world so we give you that you don't you have your own plan as a human being I want to get this money bought a mansion go for vacation wherever I want to you want to buy a jet plane you want to do whatever I want to do be the sausage person in your area but when God calls you take that pepper and bring it it's useless then you give us an eternal life and forgiveness of your sin he killed the old person then he began to give you his schedule his his his purpose for your life you're gonna suffer for him as part of it amen he left a little bit of the suffering that you suffer for him so that you be perfected in a suffering if I have not gone through suffering before you don't even understand people that's right the politician some of them don't understand what the common person feel amen they get all the money and the big mansions and whatever but at the poor person living somewhere they don't they don't have a feeling for that person by you you've got a car Bromstad power with our character is demonic but then God gives you character then you give their power to walk as a son as a daughter of Jesus Christ amen so when you are walking you are not just working yes you a human being you get tired you have got a human limitations you have to to get some rest even Jesus after preaching he's not died he was fast asleep on the boat he was a hundred percent human being but then when they see begin to when I begin to drown there was this boisterous when coming against a ship that ever wanted to sing them as I am now the pita and cool by then didn't happen Holy Ghost baptism because Christ has now gone to cover so all the Fountain of Life was leaning Jesus Christ but Jesus wanted toward put our life in them so Peter and CO begin to cry and scream Lord we are perishing they working from sleep and he said peace be still and the wind obeyed him and I said what manner of man is this he's really the real weirdo how can you speak to the winner the wind obey him they didn't know that they had a very person but I did or Pentecost the loss that are ago but I'll not leave you comfortless now come back so when he died three days he came back is directed and then he came a simple of fire the same cry seen in Jesus came into them and the same people who a coward could in a huge sickness couldn't heal epilepsy we were fighting among themselves would be the biggest in the kingdom of God now the Holy Ghost took over their flesh the assistant element and the women and the men were speaking in tongues and the Holy Ghost we're baptizing people and they were converted sinners unto Christ what made the difference it was Christ in them Elohim the very person of Jesus Christ in the assisting element was making the difference Amen so the difference in your Christian life is not how beautiful how handsome you are but is the person of Christ that transformed you amen glory hallelujah bless with the last the last one when we bring it to an end let's read a future home future home of blessed be the Lord future home of the heavenly groom and earthly bride okay here we feature of 1964 Oh 802 paragraph 96 now let's see what the devil can trick some of us paragraph 93 some of us might not know whether we are born again or not they said a man can repent of sins and it's so thinking of well maybe if it's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds is though they may be he's a drunkard every time he smiles the drink alcohol is thought they see but then when he gets satisfied that cleanses the desire out of him it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but it but he takes the want of it away still he's not right yet then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire cleanse burnt out clean up and then put in the service of God amen now many people can be justified there are lot of Christians who are justified they are living holy live they are cleanse yesterday I don't have the person of Jesus Christ in them so now being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in water is not enough being cleanse washed is not enough but then the person of Jesus Christ has to come in by this election by the Holy Ghost baptism and consume the old person and all its works and then recreate you and I after the image of Mecca Selleck amen so that you become the very person of Jesus Christ walking upon earth then you become a complete work that God can use you but in the justified City s you live in the outer door today you are warm tomorrow you are cold when you come to the church that what is preach you on fire when you get out of the church then your revive is over because the rava is external Reviva when the atmosphere is created you are good but then when you are by yourself then the alcohol begin to thinking or don't you good go get me a coho because the old person is thought there when you are cleansed you are cleansed you don't have the desire even for alcohol you don't have desire for women and men by yes you are not right because the pest Jesus Christ is not baptized in your heart but then when you become perfect when you are perfected is when you cross over Jordan like Elijah was fully an enlarger he had his courage meant that sons of the Prophet told him that your master is gonna be taken away from you in other words you're gonna die but he persisted he persevered and went with Elijah even lascia Elijah said that I'm going to delay I'm going to the Lord is calling me to Bethel I don't have time out we got a lot missing we take it out since I'm on Bethel is a go guy is confession which everybody can confess just like seven women in Isaiah chapter four they want to marry Jesus Christ but they don't want to take the nature of Christ in them they just want to be church members they want to be good people in the neighborhood but then when you move further to Bethel better means now you have word not only confessing but you are making a fellowship you are moving another step further now put in your action in two ways that is so not enough to be in Bethel you are cleansed and justified but then you have to go through Jordan Jordan means crossing over to the other side you're gonna die supernaturally the old desire has to be has to be burnt out the old person has to be consumed then Christ himself the sixth seal takes over Braham so that when you our God calls you he post judgment on you not judgment to kill your flesh or not judgment to to bring sickness on you now the judgment to cut the old person the sixth seal is a judgment seal it's a battling seal it's a consuming so so the CC comes from the old person then the seventh seal is a relaxing seal it's a still of rest it's a still of peace then he become a

praise often amen thank you my precious brother Amen a lot of things were said in there and man you notice when he was talking about how once we get to the age of accountability you know as a little child you do things wrong again you know you're being taught not to do things but once you get to a point you know you're doing things wrong and you hiding and sneaking and things like that there's a record that's being kept and I like the way he put that it's a supernatural record it's a record in the mind of God and also a record in your mind that keep you from until you can you get that thing confessed and you go through the proper channels it's going to stay there and if you die in that condition then there's no more hope see right now you're under the opportunity of grace what a glorious opportunity that we have this morning because grace is still his the blood is still on the mercy seat all you have to do is confess your faults confess your sins you know you you you know you're doing things that you shouldn't be doing you know you're living in sin and and and see sometimes we go through different things and I life in different troubles in our life and we wonder well why are we going through this and why my battling these things and why's this happening that turned the hand of Jehovah moving you into a place he wants you to confess he wants you to go free but he's allowing these things these troubles to come into your life to put you in a position that you can repent and give God your life now even after that there's things you're gonna go through there's things you're gonna go through but see the beauty of it and is knowing that even mean once you get to do that and you've crossed over to Jordan and you know all of your sins are confessed and your garment is clean there's nothing you can do to me because even in death I win see so then there's a piece that's the peace that passes all understanding but until you have that peace then you know whether you got that peace of mind let every man examine himself you know whether you got that peace of mind and you know the beautiful thing about it God is calling your name if you feel that tug on your heart that thing is bothering you right now talking about saying well Lord I know I did this right now there's a battle going on there's a battle going on God is drawing you and Satan is in your mind I don't listen that dad don't do that see he wants you to stay by but there's an opportunity right now for you to go free right now is your opportunity to go free don't let it pass you by my brothers and sisters don't let it pass you by God has created an opportunity to turn the hand of Jehovah you could have been anywhere this morning but God had you here to speak a word into your situation today is your day I believe God spoke to somebody's heart this morning a man I surrender all a man I believe he spoke to somebody's heart it'll be a shame for you to walk away this morning knowing that God spoke to your heart see God is calling you he's calling to you calling you to a higher place of praise you know you can't even worship God freely until you get that you got to come correct keep the prophet priest mentioned there's only one provided place of worship he loves you this morning he's calling you it's not by chance that you're here not by chance the world would love for you to think well this
