Ruth was in the field of Boaz uh Boaz told the Reapers to drop some things on purpose uh just for her so I believe tonight the Lord Jesus will drop some things on purpose amen just for us so we're we're under expectation let's just have a quick word of prayer amen as our brother just prepares to come amen tonight father as we just begin to turn the service a man into the hands of your man's servant we pray o God that you would use them for your glory you know what this church stands in need of here tonight and it's not by accident it's not by chance that you allowed our brother to pass this way we're asked that you would use them Lord For Your Glory let the the words just come fresh from the Throne of God directly to the hearts of the people and father we ask that you would hide him behind the cross that he might not be seen but may Christ be on display tonight God is in Jesus name that we pray amen amen Amen brother and guinea amen let's just welcome him at this time praise the Lord amen thank you okay I'm in agree to All In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ I'm certainly happy to be here and see my friend brother check and all my friends who are here and a few of them visited Us in Zimbabwe I think it was the the last time we met sister Ellen and I was wasn't the wedding of brother Simba right yeah it's as if it's yesterday yeah I want to thank the Lord for giving us this opportunity to pass by this way we've been with you all my whole family back there we have been enjoying the cold land of America and I thank God for my friend brother Aaron he flew from South Carolina just to come and drive us and be with us is a very powerful Minister that yeah he's very gifted so now knowing that my time is very short let's go straight to uh the Book of Esther so I'll read from the first first verse he says now it came to pass in the days of Israel which reigned in India even to Ethiopia over 107 27 provinces that in those days when the king sat on the throne of the Kingdom which is a shushan the palace let us pray our heavenly father will come the service into our hands may you come and Minister Lord further directly to our needs spiritually financially in all directions of life let your spirit Lord father cause a difference May Holy Spirit overshadow your people Lord father and descend their needs and their desires and make us have a closer walk with you about that Supernatural experience that assures us that give us strength to work in this journey Lord father I cook the substitutions in Jesus name amen night will not be seated my subject today is when God turns the purpose I will use the whole book of Esther just to demonstrate how the Unseen hand of God moves around in our lives to arrange pieces there's an unseen hand that moves in our lives and God can connect the pieces he can join the pieces in your life so we find that in this book of Esther it starts with a great feast so it opens with a lavish banquet um when this king is also Sexes who is the son of King Darius the Clinton the son of Cyrus we met the decree for the children of Israel to go back and this other son grandson or after him um who later let the other decree so the interesting thing about the Book of Esther is that Esther means a star this is not her name this is the given name and the Jewish name was which means my true tree a star means if she's a star star shine better in darkness so God was going to create some form of Darkness because names are powerful this the star will defy the darkness and the child of God will defy any evil background in their lives so unfortunate things are to start from the early age of Esther to create enough Darkness for her to shine so we find that Esther had actually influenced by helping in the Palace of the final decree by Arthur's axis so as a sister you can actually influence great things if you are in your right position actually the prophet says a sister a woman in the kitchen a wife can do more for the kingdom of God in a position than some preachers on the field that is the out the impact of being in your position in the great jigs of puzzle of God so we find that the Book of Esther does not even mention the name of God it is it shows that God was behind the scenes when God seems like he's absent when God seems like he's silent he's working things to a favor in the background now there's a question that did Esther and the king have children together we don't have the Bible answer for that one but now before we even take this sport cruise together through the Book of Esther and let's just look at this beautiful way of seeing the message through the Bible and starting from Genesis the first five letters I'm saying seeing the message in the chronology of the scriptures and where the Book of Esther is placed so the first five letters depend at which is like the gospels in the New Testament we want to see the message in the order of the scripture Joshua becomes like the book of Acts judges become The Messengers so then a route becomes the bride then the last charge being Samuel who is Daniel anointed Kings becomes the last messenger and so we then become Kings and Priests so the book of Kings become may God has made us Kings and Priests then the next book being Chronicles the Bible says books are open that is the Judgment time um but now at that time when the message goes is over with the Gentiles it goes to the Jews so Israel Maya is the gospel to the Jews so after that they call out Esther from the Jewish side then when asked when the Jews are called the next book is job which is tribulation we know that it's 42 chapters in the 42 months is three and a half years then after that it's the singing Hallelujah we are paid to the Millennium so looking at the Book of Esther it shows courage in Dark Times a Believer is never a loser Against All Odds a cushion overcomes it shows the quiet hand of God when things seems like they are not moving and things seem like they are out of control there is an unseen hand it shows that when Grace look at you nothing can stop your destiny it shows that poet is thousand times of answering your needs he specializes in things not impossible you must trust the invisible end of God so we will see us that defying a background there is a reason why things started dark it's called making a contrast so that you can shine better against that so that you can defile your background actually adversity in sports University to train you many people [Music] your life when the Book of Esther starts it starts as if it's the book of Haman that God tells the tables it may look like you have been defeated but we are perplexed but not in despair because all things we are more than Congress it shows us that is the master plan what is a master planner God is a master strategist God is a master scouter God is a Mastercraft man God is a master artist the development of the picture is going to develop nicely leave the picture to come out and you shall know as you are known in heaven our Lord is a master engineer our court is a master mathematician [Music] place just leave it to God so we find that in the third year that is very important of the rain he made the feast throughout these provinces there 480 days there you are showing everything and then later the in the Book of Esther you find the enemy of the truth you know this is a delayed man she said drama is called people and everything to bring an appetite which is an amalekites because amalekites had always been enemies of Jews so then we find that uh in this breakfast when it finished when those days were expired the king called the fist for seven days so he said there were only seven thh's now now in that first one he was displaying all these Splenda and riches it is said that no one saw the same thing twice God is so rich in Mercy that you can have experience After experiencing still not exhaust the goodness of God all these goodness is coming after you so in those seven days we expired so he causes seven chamberlains there is the numbers playing again so it says because when he was shown all his wishes it's not the biggest thing he has the biggest thing is the wife amen after a simple God in nature the greatest mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory so now he calls the wife which is vasty and then she refuses participates drama to bring Grace there is a reason why I even choose it to refuse him so that we come in so verse 2 was also busy with their feast I usually say sister even if you went to vastly don't be a vast be submissive to your husband don't have parallel structures and programs so then we find that he calls the seven chamberlains that are written there and to bring vast but she refused then in sixth Council that because he refused they want he wanted to know the the king's anger was burning but now what was the problem of fasting it's a background you must Define your background because history says that she was a daughter of belt shaza and she was also a wife before in marriage you don't need much experience um so one of the case greatest one of the greatest kings in the world is a great feast and called the queen but you didn't come she refused you are so humiliated he says now Christ is calling us to Heavenly places we must not refuse his call so in verse 14 now we find that these are the seven chamberlains then he starts Consulting them indicates advice from the seventh one you see in the older then uh going backwards the seventh one is right then here in the seventh he's the one who advises the king Mommy can the seventh now that is very important because the king is Signet and to begin with namikan is the seventh and the seven letters and that that fits the message very well she is the King's Authority but when I read started in the Jewish statnam uh they say mom again is Daniel wow according to the Jewish they say it's not his proper name but his proper name is Daniel so you can research more about that it's not absolute but this is what Jews say so it was a prophet who was the servant who advised the king about the pride in the truthy of a pride so he was co-signator with God as the bride you are co-signatory ass with Christ because everybody owns it belongs to you only a child of God you are not an embarrassed of any but ambassador of Heaven it's an authority if you are a novice don't dispute with authorities don't find advice from YouTube and and from everywhere and try to to disprove and authoritative Signet because in other chapter 3 says in the 24th day of the of the seventh is it nine month yeah um that is when our Prophet was taken in the 24th day of the ninth month which is December to choose to us so now when the King was angry about first he spent four years without a queen they believed in letting the dust set before the next move he saw them because now it was now in the 10th month um it was in the seventh year now it was 44 years without the queen but now why he had his four years without a queen is because he was busy fighting in Greece his daughter let me fight other battles the marriage is tough at this moment let me fight other battles then unfortunately also lost there when he was angry he was a man who could not have said this defeat so when he sent um when he was attacking prison and sent his army they wanted to make a bridge and when the bridge failed he actually killed all the engineers for failure and then when they told him that no it was the waters in the storm he said no even the waters must obey me so he was upset here to to send the soldiers to to beat the sea 300 times whip it why did you cause my things to fave so he branded the sea with red hot ions and soldiers shouted at the waters he did not believe any force of nature can cause him to fail that was the man determined to Victory so in chapter two of Esther now we find that um when his right was appeased he did not want to move when he was still angry but four years angry I don't think it's okay because the sun must not set in your anger so when he then remembered first then he says now what should be done and yet to be canceled you know no matter how great you are you need advice from others so then Joseph Joseph has the historian says 400 virgins came to the king it shows us that money are cold but if you are chosen yeah so when Esther came it was a chance to come she tried to hide you know the real people for the job as we say I'm the one I can see I can preach I can she tried to hide but when mercy locates you you cannot hide so when it was the first time in the palace she it was looking strange maybe it's your first time today here you don't know it's your place she didn't know it's her place but she was straight it was looking strange because it was a first time but now Queen Esther found favor in the eyes of those that saw him Divine favor is a great thing in our lives it's not of good that we have done but it's good who shows mercy so many are called but a few are chosen so extraordinary purpose you may look like a usual person seated in your usual place but something unusual is fixing to happen today because you have an unusual God who works in a mutual way is through usual people the good thing about Esther Like an Eagle she root above the storms and the Bible says in Psalm 75 verse 6 to 7 promotion does not come from the east to west it comes from the Lord so it's God will elevated here so the modern day Persia is where Iraq is where the the kingdom was stretching to this place where this Arab areas so people die but spirits remain that's why you find these days that's where they are the Hammonds of today that's why one time when Netanyahu was talking to Obama and there was a big debate about Iran he gave Obama a copy of the Book of Esther meaning the same God is alive now this is a pattern in the Bible that everyone who Rose against the Jews at a mysterious end and any weapon that rises against you shall not Prosper even this man from Iran they had a mysterious end and that's why in netanyahu's other speech he gave facts that who are the Hammers to scare me or terrify me we survived Pharaoh we survived the Greeks we survived the Romans we survived Inquisition in Spain the problems in Russia will survived Hitler we survived the chairman we survived through many dangerous Turtles and snares I've already come to this place that has let me save this far and Grace will lead me home the least is endless of what you have been saved from and look at all the enemies of Israel that they are now just ruins whatever Rises against you do just become ruins just become pieces so now we see that whatever happens God is away in the presence of tobians and palate God made the Jews repaint in topless times in the prayers of haters of Jews I was just seeing this video that when they were trying to burn the flag of Israel when they were trying to play around with the name of Israel God turns the case against them so God is the way one time the newspaper was saying God is diverting their Rockets mid-air you know in the pre in the kingdom of God their sickness is diverted air that cannot touch you worries and frustrations so what is amazing is that Harmony of the Jews is he he sought advice from astrologers to find how to find a a badly inspired date to kill the Jews why he threw his Purim Stones God moved them further by one year to allow the strategizing God to move elements meaning even the devil's weapons are not in His Hands what the devil was trying became an own goal it was the miscalculations of the devil when the devil touches you it's a miscalculation it becomes an own goal against the devil but why Hammond Hammond was in amalekit they always hated that war with Israel for 400 years and Moses said commanded Saul to destroy amalekites so some of our problems is things that we had a chance to destroy things that were the chance to confess or make right then we left them then they become those later so we find that if Esther's purine this day which was supposed to be the death of the Jews is now celebrated as the death of the enemies of the Jews this is how God turns temples around so the thing that was meant to destroy you can actually become the very thing that God is God uses you uses to develop you to what he wants you to be all our trials they become every burden becomes a blessing and God comes down I was eating in another story where they were actually Jews were born in the torture attempts the other one was born on the 29th of April I think in 1945 somewhere there then on the next day the Germans ran out of gas that's how the child survived on the next day they were rescued the dog will run out of gas trying to torment um I saw this image of a child who was born holding the IUD That was supposed to destroy them I don't know if you symmetically I didn't verify it may be not medically correct but I like the concept that what is meant to destroy you you pour it I say Against All Odds I can make it because there is some two things that God does about tables some of them he prepares them some of them attends them so God prepares a temple in the presence of your enemies and sometimes he turns tap us around look at this in the presence of pharaoh the extra pass happened in the presence of penina Hannah is a child and in the presence of of a Haman Mordecai was promoted in the process of the alligators in Nile River Moses basket sail through in the presence of a Potiphar's wife Joseph was elevated things changed overnight I believe things can change overnight in your life in the presence of overflating Japan God made the way for children of Israel he says to those who picked most he says where Saturn's it is but they have not denied my name in the presence of adversity you shall make it what does not remove problems sometimes just proves that it depends of 200 million Devils we go in the Rapture all the same in the prayers of all ancestral spirits and the international spirits who shall make it in the presence of the prince of Persia's answer came down in the presence of the Dragon in Revelation chapter 12 the male child was born so your testimony will be born Against All Odds Against All oppositions In The Presence of the Mamba on the highway the pride is overcoming and binding all the numbers so you shall put us through all your situations in the presence of adversity in the presence of obstacles in the prayers of challenges so on the in the presence of lions you see when they're in the Lion's Den delighting them was more than the lion outside when they operate in a clan of oil the oil in them was more than the old outside when they were putting the fire Defenders the fire in them was more than the fire outside but they were brought before Giants the child in them are spot and they giant outside so the Book of Esther is to show that there is an unseen hand that is leading in our lives that you should feel nothing brother the sport who's working behind the scenes the Book of Esther shows that God remembers you God cannot forget you I believe this day today if you want to pray for last day is still valid one thing God will remember he says about your husband about your wife about your children about your health God will remember all those prayers all right now it shows that even when you think our weight is falling apart God is working behind the scene top was 10 and certainly underdogs become champions Esther was not known at all became the champion when people stand those were oppressors become oppressed that's why the Bible says captivity to be captivated you can doubt your doubts and worry worries you can frustrate your frustrations so God can still turn your situation around today when tables are telling in your favor that is divine favor in your life God is making your life beautiful again our growth is a quote of restoration everything that people stole from your life can come back again whatever was born in spiritual let it come back again whatever I was told in financial Let It Come better thing recruit all days are coming back in your life like something you said once more Lord let's approve prayer times come back days come back in your life I was watching this testimony of our brothers when they were preaching there's a sister who's wearing blue there on the actually just believing that God can turn the tables without him not to say she rose out of the wheelchair and the camera was touching the miracle you know what interacted the service written answer and sometimes God can interrupt your prayer with an answer he says before they even pray please turn around your life when God steps in all things are changed that God doesn't love you the Book of Esther reminds you that there is an unseen hand that will collect pieces for your children academically everywhere any direction of your life the hand of God can reach there when God steps in the miracles happen this person that you see here um these these two were divorced for for 20 years [Music] actually happening 20 years divorced it doesn't matter how long we have been in that situation these Services can turn around God Is Bigger Than God tells purpose if you give him his ten when purpose attend your testimony comes the beginning of your trust born it starts with an impossibility every test Point starts with I was is lost I was sick I was broke I was empty but not now the test one is coming there are not enough hammers to stop your testimony from family [Applause] who will be strategizing God because happened to be at the right place [Music] against the king and life yet to be unfair that he was not rewarded at that time because if he was rewarded at that time the program of God was not going to work later so you did something right and someone forgot you it happened to Joseph he says guys remember me but they didn't remember at the right time but the right time was not the right time so you find that God started moving pieces and the king and still when God moves in one area it's still possible to see things getting worse in another area have you seen that you pray for something a testimony happens when you find the other side it gets worse now chapter three things get worse after a little miracle things can still get worse in another side of life you can receive the only questions to your serial fans going down God knows about that it's a strategist so chapter 3 Harmony is promoted yeah your enemy needs to be strong for your Testament to be strong if I was brought I was going to create a little table that I will storm quickly because I'm not so powerful in me so but good is so popular to to create quite eating creative but he met someone who is perfect with a timed Witness so that it can be a devil not a small one that you can show crush and people think are not God you need a devil that will crash and people say only God can do this so not power is promoted when you see a problem getting stronger it's about to fall then we find that when there's a Time on the it seems like the enemy is winning that's when God is arranging things because Hamman was not only against those Jews it was against the Messiah because the Messiah was going to come through those truths when anything Fighters the part of Christ is fighting Christ because you are misses Jesus so when the the plot of the wicked pathway for their teammates so one big chapter doesn't mean the story is over chapter 3 was a third chapter only one big chapter there is a synonym that can rewrite don't give up because of one chapter in life keep going on the story doesn't end here the dog will always fights the hardest when we are close to a breakthrough and when the devil will give up when he sees that you don't give up so one word from God will turn your situation around that's why it's important to come for services because you are energized yourself is you are given power to meet the challenge of the hour so our God is not dead is alive but in any situation in in any moment in time you must be able to say this is not how my story will end us expect ation no matter who had things sensitive all the time because this one thing I know he has never failed me yet God can turn around your situation today now in chapter in verse 7 the bible says in the 12th year of sexes now this is Esther's fifth anniversary now we think things we prepare time the fifth anniversary because most marriages are tested for five years then things are rose but now in the fifth year that's when Herman is now getting stronger still but Esther is a spiritual emergence your situation today is a spiritual emergency something must be done today you want to take the blood of Jesus and put a full stop to your situation and prove the blood of Jesus a no-flight zone of devils in your life stay positive even when it feels like your life is falling apart when it feels like God is not doing anything that's what he's doing is he specializes in things not impossible so Queen Esther was asked who knows people are in the Kingdom for such a time as this but look at this God uses instrumentality of man God could have done it all but he wanted Esther to do something but sometimes he puts situations that squeeze us to do something now if the greatest power of the bride of Christ will be during this quiz and in your life if you have a premature squeeze Financial or spiritually you pretty much want to use this Deadpool so this is not the book of Haman it's the Book of Esther you must tell the devil this is not true story Satan this is my story he probably cannot put my aim in my story he cannot touch anything that belongs to me God didn't bring you this far to leave to lose you and you must know that Lord didn't bring you this far God did you are not lucky to survive covet you're not likely to be alive today but God can just do it just like that it's just a small thing to God to deal with the matters that they've traveled you for 10 years so it is not too late not too hard for God it's a god of hitting around the Bible says mainly at the afflictions of the righteous but you know this word part is a game changer in the Bible you see that God many arrows pierce my soul but the Lord many are the afflictions of righteous but the Lord your situation is better but God is bigger than your situation Hallelujah yeah those are the times go for Desperate Measures it's not over God can flip the script [Music] child that you must face and even if you are standing between a rock and that place it's just a return strip God has already seen and there's free testing you nothing can stop your testing Esther felt like if I perish let me perish you need determination at that time she knew that even if she walks into danger the footsteps of the righteous are altered by God all you have to do is not to be statement be moving forward if you can't run walk if you can't walk Pro if you can't prone even wrong if you can't roll find a cat and then slide into your testimony Esther said if I perish let me perish but she knew something says I'm saying this but I'm not going to perish Esther was being taught to overcome your fears because fear not is written 365 times in the Bible meaning every day you don't have anything to fear it is said that a child is born with only two fears fear of being dropped and fear of certain sounds all others were to learn them I don't know who taught us I only like fears that I was taught by Grace it was Grace that taught my eye to fear but embrace my fears relieved when we have nothing left but God we discover that God is enough God doesn't give you what we we can handle but God helps us to end what we are given so in that situation don't betray Heavens even the bank on you and sin that you are able to handle that system whatever you are passing through in your marriage God so that you are able to handle it there is nothing that is amiss brother whatever you are giving God so that you are able to handle it just be Satan of God when God shows up when God shows up the impossible become possible and you can turn a mess into a message a test into a testimony and trying to drive a victim into a victim don't be a victim of circumstances praise remove the death penalty was you are supposed to die so you see we are Mrs Jesus it means a lot to be Mrs Jesus if I introduce my wife she must be in the standard of who I am so we can't be Mrs Jesus I just say we're final voice we are the we are one in a million and being 100 million things are breaking down your life you will be coming not an ambassador of heaven but embarrasser of Heaven so God invites the bride to rule to sit at the throne with him so we we there are many people who came to be Mrs many churches but there's only one Mrs Jesus 400 virgins came and but there was one Esther Esther had the power to change the mind of the king that's how powerful you are as a child of God so you are the final voice you know take your perfect picture and you are born for such a time as this when God is for you it doesn't matter the odds that are against you you'll be victorious Against All Odds you only must know that God will do it again [Music] if he has answered you before he can answer you again if he has undertaken for you before you can undertake for you again our God is able remember though we are served and we are the servants or of God or soldiers or Sons and Daughters we are also the spouse of Christ they are not only just a soldier or or servant you are a Queen of Heaven Queen Esther the powers of a queen are great the Bible says you shall decree a thing and it shall be established for you and the light will shine in your path now we get to chapter five where now there is an open check there's a banquet now and the King invites Haman Esther is heavier prayer request now and God has given us an open check to ask everything that's why the king says ask to half of my kingdom God says ask not to half of my kingdom ask anything Hallelujah God can do anything anytime anywhere where no problem gets so heavy and you think there's no way through he's the lion that prevaileth he's the mighty conqueror Now esther did not just ask she was waiting for an atmosphere she just says I asked you to have a meeting I asked that we go for service but when the atmosphere was he was she was waiting for Spiritual signals then when those sickness came when the king could not sleep at night you know God was now moving elements she could the king could not sleep not because of Esther because of Esther's unspoken request your unspoken request will make God work on both ends when Esther is praying this side God is working on both ends when you are praying and saying now more than 30 years I want a husband God will make that husband not sleep today the purpose there are times when things change overnight overnight Joseph moved from prison to the throne overnight Saturday Michigan moved from the fiery furnace to promotion overnight Daniel moved from the fairy from the Lion's Den to promotion things can change you know the powerful testimony is what has happened in our lives like this person who is preaching and this one could you tell is the same person this is me before things change overnight once I was lost this is me before Grace and this is me before Grace and also I used to to be a vendor I used to sell things but now I'm in the medical field with surgeries I've planted more than 36 churches when Grace takes The Underdogs then nobody God is a tendons of taking broken pieces to make masterpieces out of town what is working behind the scenes for his great plan so now Mordecai moves from being bound for colors to bring Bound for the throne multica was a security guard by the door little has changed to be a royal somebody but before you are royal you have to be loyal [Music] Esther became the messy City she was standing for only people like raps stood for all their people when you are convinced be concerned stand for or apply the token for all your people now we are in chapter six don't worry the Book of Esther is not long so we're about to cross so Haman and said with the man with the letter well now the devil can be used for your answer do you know that some of us were not going to see the message but the devil has used to make us sick and we heard that in the message when we went for a healing we said what is this that we are hearing when we were served so it was the devil's own goal sometimes God uses your enemy to put you in a prime position you see because your position is linked to your possession when you stand on the Promises of God one day is going to materialize Heavenly Earth can pass away but the promises will never pass away I would rather stand on the Promises of God than on the premises of God because the premises will pass away but the promises will never pass away so people may be asking why do bad things happen to good people wow why I'm believing the message I'm carrying the spoken word but things go bad it's because you are a light and you shine in darkness and God wants his grace to shine he says my strength is not perfect in weakness your breakthrough comes in the midst of his struggle and the things that Satan wants to use to destroy you God will use to develop us so you are not under threat you are the threat if you look at it Herman was not the threat Herman was under threat if you look at it the number on the highway is not the threat we are the threat so your attention to your dangers no what was meant to destroy you God will use it to elevate you so and sometimes Against All Odds and against all logic we still um believe you know I promises against hope he believed in hope so in the Book of Esther now let's get to chapter nine uh Esther um wrote with authority do you know what God reads what a prayer request that you wrote The God Who created your eyes can see right the God who created your ears came here you go to created your hands can't touch you the God who created your feet can walk to where you are so some of these prayer requests that you are just writing thinking one right no one reads one time there was a guy brought the letters to God sometimes you bring your X-ray your scan your your sermons God reads Esther wrote she was told Queen Esther right is it like at you now now and Esther to do a reverse order he says Esther came before The King and commanded that by the letters that the wicked devices which was devised against the Jew should return upon his own head so they told the devil this is a reverse order what I return to your personality go pick up on your head so um God's timing is always perfect it's when your enemies in your hands stress to Esther was told your enemies in your end actually in in Jeremiah I think 52 or 25 or so it says Thy word is a better Acts we can destroy the Devil when God turns the tables there are two things that God does with temples he either tends them or prepares them when when you turn your worries into worship God will turn your battles into blessings you are not a warrior but you are alone here and if God can if God can turn night into day he can turn your patterns into blessings allow God to transform your obstacles into stepping stone there is a time when it becomes payback time nothing all what you've been praying for one day brother God will give you a good measure press down shaken together the Book of Esther became a doorway for Jews to return in the second return again for God to open a way they possess the Gate of the enemy the enemy must be your footstool the devil must not know what is happening financially in your life you must only know the size of your shoe it must only be under your feet so there is a time when we see that when the King was wrought them when Haman bowed for Mercy before Esther things that you fear shall bow before you every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess now in this banquet we realized that sooner or later everyone sits at the banquet of consequences sooner or later we shall be at the banquet of the wedding that you prayed for sooner or later we shall have a banquet of your child passing the way you wanted them to pass our God is a strategist he knows how to move mountains he knows how to make what you are going through become a blessing no I want to close it because this laptop so that I can be able to close very fast now looking for at how God turns tables in the Book of Esther Our God knows you more than you know yourself he knows how to make it to time your blessing to be a greater Miracle the universe prayed for it God knows you he knows your name he knows what you are passing through he knows the number of your hair he knows your address he knows how much you can pay he knows you better than you know yourself he can walk in the midst of your life and say I know I know but then when he comes down and says Cornelius Cornelius your prayers you've come for a memorial I believe all your fastings all your prayers all your attending Services one day is going to pay you one day God will anoint you God bless you personally yeah [Applause] oh my God um [Laughter] all I can tell you is that I knew that the Lord was going to drop something on purpose for us tonight and um just when God turns the tables but uh what a a powerful thought and um you know personally things that God just spoke directly to me just encouraged me and and uh and I'm sure everybody here tonight um God had to speak to your situation they had to speak to your circumstance and I mean just so much encouragement laying in that in the story of Esther you can just like you said you won't even find the name God even in the Book of Esther but you can see all the works of God Amen in the midst of it all and whatever you're going through just know that God is in the midst of it he's working it all out amen for your good so uh brother and gwenya God bless you God bless you know I'll tell you um one thing I I do realize that God makes us also different and the way that he um allows different ministers to put their thoughts together I don't think I ever saw I've seen I mean I do PowerPoint but that's PowerPoint at another level I'm telling that that's 3.0 footage and I'm like what but but it just drives the point home wait and I just love it just just take his time just go right through it
