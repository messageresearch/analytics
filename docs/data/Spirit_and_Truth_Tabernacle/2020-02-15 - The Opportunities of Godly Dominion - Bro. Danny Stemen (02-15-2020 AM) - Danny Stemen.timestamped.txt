[1:03:51] certainly before the banquet you know
[1:03:55] that I've heard about so many different
[1:03:56] trials that Saints went through a man to
[1:04:00] get there and
[1:04:01] one of my brothers they have spoke for
[1:04:03] the air in the address in the GPS after
[1:04:08] they got from the airport and it took
[1:04:11] them to a whole lot of city hours away
[1:04:14] and I saw delay them all gonna get here
[1:04:17] and I say well what God is God is still
[1:04:19] God
[1:04:20] and now and then brother Jerry last
[1:04:22] night he spoke in there for the Jerry's
[1:04:24] Russian to get there to the to the to
[1:04:28] the banquet
[1:04:30] but is key on top of its car and you
[1:04:35] know the end of the story and we went
[1:04:38] looking all last night trust try to find
[1:04:40] that key you know and though we just
[1:04:43] produced live it in the hands of the
[1:04:44] Lord and and you know the devil just
[1:04:47] fighting everybody everybody and any
[1:04:50] time I see him fighting like that I know
[1:04:51] he must know that God got some
[1:04:56] [Applause]
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:59] and since we made it here we have proved
[1:05:03] that we are more than over cameras
[1:05:09] what was that for the Sam say we look at
[1:05:13] problems as a opportunity for testimony
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:19] man I like that Isaac we appreciate you
[1:05:25] all these brothers they've been and how
[1:05:26] they just shared with us so last night
[1:05:28] and just just just just a wonderful
[1:05:30] wonderful atmosphere as we just prepare
[1:05:34] to turn a mental order of the service I
[1:05:36] wanted to just kind of share just a
[1:05:39] quick quote with you and also before I
[1:05:42] do that brother what's gotten into me
[1:05:45] this morning that that sister wesco
[1:05:48] wasn't feeling well and we want to pray
[1:05:50] for sister wesco and then we want to
[1:05:52] pray for her that go to devil can attack
[1:05:55] him and I even brother Danny it's kind
[1:05:58] of going through something but devil
[1:05:59] attacking him to his body so we we just
[1:06:02] we just say the devil's a lie
[1:06:04] and we impress through this but it may
[1:06:06] let's just Bauer is it was just awful
[1:06:08] word of Prayer for our precious sister
[1:06:10] father we've become
[1:06:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus on behalf
[1:06:15] of Russia's sister West going God we're
[1:06:18] asking that you would touch her you know
[1:06:21] the condition the devil is attacking but
[1:06:24] you have a great position that God you
[1:06:26] are currently present accident you would
[1:06:30] touch her and that you would lay your
[1:06:31] hands on earth oh god the blood that
[1:06:34] flowed from Calvary that brings
[1:06:35] salvation to our souls is the same blood
[1:06:38] that flows healing top bodies so father
[1:06:41] we pray that you would just let her
[1:06:43] leave here different from the week she
[1:06:46] came and father may she be careful to
[1:06:48] give you the border there's anybody else
[1:06:49] here that is going through anything and
[1:06:52] everybody we by name they giving me
[1:06:54] right now and we pray that the Spirit of
[1:06:57] God would touch your feet the Lord
[1:06:59] he'll set free and deliver goddess I'm
[1:07:02] here we can fit it all into your hands
[1:07:04] some Jesus name we pray
[1:07:08] a Manny Manny Manny man we call it under
[1:07:12] Jesus name
[1:07:13] praise the Lord so just quickly in
[1:07:18] have a speaker come but for I mentioned
[1:07:22] last night and we'll read this quote a
[1:07:24] man again and then I got another one I
[1:07:26] want to read to you about light the fire
[1:07:28] again
[1:07:29] started this I want to say a few years
[1:07:32] ago the Lord just kind of put a little
[1:07:33] sermon in her and her spirits and we
[1:07:35] just been really flowing with this
[1:07:39] brother branham makes this statement
[1:07:41] here in the exposition of the seven
[1:07:44] church ages says now history keeps
[1:07:47] repeating itself says in the generations
[1:07:52] of Israel we see revival in one
[1:07:56] generation only to see the fires
[1:08:01] in the necks says in the
[1:08:03] third-generation embers maybe glowing
[1:08:07] slightly who says but in the fourth
[1:08:11] maybe no vestige whatsoever of that
[1:08:15] original flame and
[1:08:19] we see how the devil should spend really
[1:08:22] just attacking people left and right
[1:08:23] this that would even criticize whether
[1:08:29] God sent a prophet or whether brother
[1:08:31] Branham was the Prophet this port is
[1:08:33] actually fulfilling what they're safe
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:36] right in the fourth generation this is
[1:08:39] where these things came out and you know
[1:08:41] when we look at women tweet last night
[1:08:43] we count from a property you count
[1:08:45] brother branham then you count a son
[1:08:46] then you count grandchildren you count
[1:08:48] to where we are right now it's it's
[1:08:51] we're in the fourth generation stage
[1:08:52] where where it's clear it's clear that
[1:08:56] no vestige of the original flame no
[1:09:00] vestige of the original flame however
[1:09:03] I'm so grateful that the quote goes on
[1:09:06] to say then God lights the fire again
[1:09:11] and this is what we're looking for this
[1:09:14] is what we're under expectation is God
[1:09:17] what light the fire again I don't want
[1:09:19] it just to be meetings Amen that we just
[1:09:22] came to some more meetings I want to see
[1:09:24] God do something at some pie
[1:09:27] a man if if there was a time that you
[1:09:29] need you used to be able to see this
[1:09:31] word I won't dr. Amen I'm not just
[1:09:34] seeing again hallelujah I want him to
[1:09:37] restore the side of the blind because
[1:09:39] it's one thing to be physically blind
[1:09:41] but it's a much worse day to be
[1:09:43] spiritually blind hallelujah he's come
[1:09:46] the noise in his tongue to restore sign
[1:09:49] again the anointing has come
[1:09:51] to set the captive free the anointing
[1:09:54] has come to make the difference
[1:09:59] then God likes the fire again
[1:10:03] in the same process is repeated
[1:10:07] December the manifestation of the truth
[1:10:09] that God has no grandchildren
[1:10:12] salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:10:14] birth any more than is there any truth
[1:10:17] to apostolic succession so we're under
[1:10:20] expectation you know it was a fourth
[1:10:22] generation and
[1:10:24] Moses Dave's that third and fourth
[1:10:27] generation was the ones that went into
[1:10:29] the Promised Land
[1:10:30] amen it was that Generation X experience
[1:10:33] I'm said they saw their their their
[1:10:35] parents kind of died out in the
[1:10:36] wilderness ooh but it was them that went
[1:10:38] into that promise
[1:10:40] so church they meant among expectation
[1:10:42] of God gonna do some specialist
[1:10:44] generation
[1:10:45] and I'm gonna be holding with my eyes
[1:10:47] glory to God
[1:10:49] this is just another cool I want to read
[1:10:51] a man from the message then Jesus came
[1:10:54] and called the date is 64 - 0 for 1 7 I
[1:11:00] don't have the paragraph number but this
[1:11:01] in this
[1:11:04] one of the reasons why we have meetings
[1:11:06] was the purpose of it the Prophet says
[1:11:09] now that book holds her name since that
[1:11:14] book holds her name and and and and
[1:11:18] brother Sam was talking about that
[1:11:19] redemption you know last night that book
[1:11:22] holds her name he came to redeem
[1:11:26] whose names was on that book
[1:11:31] I want it I got good news for you if
[1:11:32] your name was on that bull hey man you
[1:11:36] got to speak back to
[1:11:37] the devil can do
[1:11:40] to take your name off that hook I want
[1:11:42] to say that if your name was on that
[1:11:44] book ain't nothing that devil can do to
[1:11:48] take your name off that book hallelujah
[1:11:50] he come to redeem whose names was on
[1:11:53] that book redeem means bring back from
[1:11:56] where it fell from if there's anybody
[1:11:58] unfeeling for falling from somewhere and
[1:12:00] God it's this weekend we expecting God
[1:12:03] to bring you back from where you fail
[1:12:06] from
[1:12:07] look he goes on to say this he says and
[1:12:10] in the human race she when she was
[1:12:12] filmed and she can't accept it now she's
[1:12:14] too young so the church was slugged
[1:12:16] right alone just play alone we'll have
[1:12:20] meetings and so forth till that last
[1:12:22] person is brought in then that book is
[1:12:26] closed there's no more added then it's
[1:12:29] all over well maybe this could be the
[1:12:31] last week if the last person comes in a
[1:12:34] man if they don't come with have another
[1:12:36] meeting but we're looking for that last

[1:19:12] Prayer Lord Jesus it's our turn now to
[1:19:19] come and stand in the pulpit and to open
[1:19:22] the Bible how often have we heard
[1:19:25] brother Branham say any man can open the
[1:19:27] Bible but it takes you to open the word
[1:19:29] to us we would ask you Lord that you
[1:19:32] would come in a special way Lord that
[1:19:35] you would use this meeting to encourage
[1:19:38] to bring strength to the feeble Lord to
[1:19:42] bring understanding Lord it's your
[1:19:44] desire that we would understand you and
[1:19:47] understand the things of God Lord not
[1:19:50] just not just in a way of an
[1:19:52] intellectual conception but a revelation
[1:19:54] that the enemy cannot prevail over may
[1:19:57] you help me Lord get myself out of the
[1:19:59] way my lips Lord we believe these
[1:20:02] meetings are not just put together with
[1:20:04] the mind of man but by the burden of God
[1:20:06] the leadership of the Holy Spirit for
[1:20:08] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[1:20:11] have your way father Hill is sick among
[1:20:14] us Lord and encourage each one and have
[1:20:18] your way in the hearing and reading of
[1:20:20] the word in Jesus name
[1:20:22] amen amen y'all bless you let's turn in
[1:20:26] our Bibles to the book of Ecclesiastes
[1:20:28] the eighth chapter amen the eighth
[1:20:33] chapter my brother Branham had said that
[1:20:38] when he was asked the question about his
[1:20:41] ministry wouldn't your name be in the
[1:20:43] Bible brother Branham said that you
[1:20:46] wouldn't necessarily have to have your
[1:20:47] name in the Bible but as long as you are
[1:20:51] in the Bible
[1:20:52] and you can see yourself in Jesus Christ
[1:20:56] you see yourself in your full position
[1:20:59] seeing yourself in him is seeing
[1:21:02] yourself in your full position when
[1:21:05] you're in him so how important it is for
[1:21:08] us to see Christ and to see ourself
[1:21:11] identified through him amen Ecclesiastes
[1:21:15] 8 4 where the word of a king is there is
[1:21:23] power and who may say unto Him what
[1:21:27] doest thou whoso keepeth the commandment
[1:21:31] shall feel no evil thing in a wise man's
[1:21:34] heart discern ahthe both time and
[1:21:37] judgment because to every purpose there
[1:21:42] is time and judgment therefore the
[1:21:45] misery of man is great upon him you can
[1:21:48] be seated may the Lord bless arena of
[1:21:50] his word amen the opportunities of godly
[1:21:54] Dominion that word power where it says
[1:21:58] where the word of a king is there is
[1:22:00] power that word power means mastery
[1:22:05] there's a mastery of the situation it
[1:22:08] means having power over it means where
[1:22:13] the word of a king is there is
[1:22:15] legitimate Authority not just a say-so
[1:22:18] Authority or I'm in the message
[1:22:21] authority it's actually legal authority
[1:22:24] that would stand up not just in the
[1:22:27] courts of law but in the courts of
[1:22:28] heaven
[1:22:29] that's legitimate Authority it means one
[1:22:32] who has dominion over another it can be
[1:22:37] used to mean powerful as in the words of
[1:22:40] a king that are described as being
[1:22:43] supreme so we know Amen the Word of God
[1:22:47] is supreme how many say man not my word
[1:22:50] not your word his word his word is
[1:22:53] supreme now amen his word is supreme
[1:22:56] authority and Satan fights that
[1:22:59] authority of the word because he knows
[1:23:01] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[1:23:04] as revelation in that word right I love
[1:23:07] the statement that brother Branham made
[1:23:09] he said that God never told a man to
[1:23:12] labor thirty years and harvest nothing
[1:23:14] God never caught a preacher for them to
[1:23:17] just stand behind the pulpit and have
[1:23:19] nothing to follow it you say man hey man
[1:23:23] I took courage in that when I passed my
[1:23:25] 30th year in ministry to know that God
[1:23:27] is faithful for all those years that he
[1:23:30] never called me to preach amen it just
[1:23:32] be a sounding symbol but he said he gave
[1:23:35] us an open door of Word and power that
[1:23:38] we are to use now every one of you have
[1:23:41] been given an open door
[1:23:44] in that open door of the word and that
[1:23:46] is our opportunity we have an
[1:23:49] opportunity given to us by the work it's
[1:23:52] not good enough for me to stand and say
[1:23:54] hey you know I'm in the bride and I know
[1:23:56] what H I'm in because the Prophet told
[1:23:58] me that's not the manifestation the
[1:24:00] manifestation is when that time and that
[1:24:03] purpose begins to live in your hearts
[1:24:07] praise the name of the Lord now we have
[1:24:10] the examples in Scripture brother
[1:24:11] Branham said about Adam and Eve all they
[1:24:13] had was just a few words that they had
[1:24:15] to keep and they couldn't keep them
[1:24:17] right and what did a man who was given
[1:24:20] dominion over all the earth what did he
[1:24:22] do with that Dominion he turned an Eden
[1:24:25] into a waste howling desert he turned
[1:24:29] what God had given him something
[1:24:31] beautiful something good a relationship
[1:24:34] a Dominion a discernment he turns all of
[1:24:38] that into a desert because of choice he
[1:24:45] already had the position but because of
[1:24:47] choice he walked away and turned it into
[1:24:51] a desert why he left the word it's how
[1:24:56] he handled the message of his day that
[1:24:58] caused corruption God never asked him to
[1:25:02] change the message he asked him to
[1:25:04] cultivate it put an atmosphere around it
[1:25:08] that the seed will bring out exactly
[1:25:10] what he said
[1:25:12] so now here's what brother Adam said I'm
[1:25:14] just trying to say a few things here oh
[1:25:16] I forgot to start my watch I don't want
[1:25:22] to go for hours but maybe three and a
[1:25:24] half amen amen but now it's how he
[1:25:28] handled the message of his day now in
[1:25:31] saying this brother Branham said in
[1:25:32] fundamental foundation of faith he said
[1:25:35] the power that he was given he was a
[1:25:37] secondary God on earth
[1:25:39] right Adam is secondary God he was not
[1:25:44] the God he was secondary God but was
[1:25:47] offered a God positioned by Satan right
[1:25:52] now he was secondary God he was given
[1:25:55] power to control all things all elements
[1:25:58] of the earth you understand he was given
[1:25:59] power and then he couldn't boast in it
[1:26:03] he was given it man what you have is
[1:26:07] given to you that's the grace of God if
[1:26:11] you're not entitled he gave it to you
[1:26:16] with that giving there should be a Grace
[1:26:19] and a humility to say it's you not me
[1:26:24] and so now he said that was Adam to
[1:26:27] control all the elements of the earth
[1:26:29] one of the brothers spoke last night
[1:26:31] about the atmosphere the elements of the
[1:26:33] earth
[1:26:33] Adam had that given those powers but
[1:26:36] then he said the power he was given to
[1:26:39] make his own self is where he fell he
[1:26:43] fell in the power that he had to make
[1:26:46] his own self to be what God had called
[1:26:50] him to be you see Adam never came to
[1:26:53] where God had called him to be he was
[1:26:58] given the position but he fell because
[1:27:00] he didn't bring forth everything that
[1:27:04] God had required of him praise the Lord
[1:27:07] now we thank the Lord for the change of
[1:27:09] covenant where it was if you do this
[1:27:12] I'll do that but then God changed it and
[1:27:14] told Abraham it's not what you do but
[1:27:16] it's what I do
[1:27:18] right amen but notice this because
[1:27:22] brother branham is very brother ben was
[1:27:24] very clear in saying these things he
[1:27:26] said that power without character is
[1:27:29] satanic so what is Satan gonna attack
[1:27:34] he's going to attack what makes the
[1:27:37] character of the church power without
[1:27:41] character sect in fact he said
[1:27:43] characters of victory not a gift right
[1:27:46] so a man without character cannot rain
[1:27:49] no matter how much he wants to no matter
[1:27:52] how many quotes he reads no matter how
[1:27:55] much he dominates the people amen
[1:28:02] he cannot rain without character because
[1:28:06] power
[1:28:06] apart from character is satanic but
[1:28:10] power with characters fit to rule so
[1:28:12] where the word of a king is there is
[1:28:13] power brother branham preface that by
[1:28:17] saying that it's the sufferings of the
[1:28:20] present time are not worthy to be
[1:28:22] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:28:24] revealed in us so the little temporary
[1:28:26] suffering that we go through is not
[1:28:29] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:28:31] glory that will be revealed on us when
[1:28:33] he comes right so what is suffering
[1:28:36] suffering is not just losing your job
[1:28:38] suffering is not just getting sick there
[1:28:43] are material things in fact this age is
[1:28:45] more material than it is spiritual and
[1:28:48] I'm saying age I'm talking about people
[1:28:49] that claim to know God well I lost my
[1:28:52] car I must be getting tested let me tell
[1:28:54] you the world gets tested in that
[1:28:56] the world gets cancer as well come on
[1:28:59] search the world loses their jobs too
[1:29:01] when you go through depression they go
[1:29:03] through depression when you go through a
[1:29:05] recession they go through a recession
[1:29:06] but you're a believer you don't go
[1:29:08] through it the same way they go through
[1:29:10] it but what is the testing then the
[1:29:14] testing is a man when God tests you with
[1:29:17] the word and you believe my words then
[1:29:22] you stand up on my word and you stay
[1:29:25] with my word change it God never asked
[1:29:31] you to it
[1:29:32] he never asked you to take from it he
[1:29:35] never asked you to embellish brother
[1:29:36] Branham he asked you to cultivate it
[1:29:41] stay with him so that the word will
[1:29:44] bring forth exactly what it said the
[1:29:46] Prophet said stay with the word so that
[1:29:49] the spirit of the word will be upon the
[1:29:51] people
[1:29:53] let me just say it right now I don't
[1:29:55] have to impress you by acting like
[1:29:56] another preacher I don't have to throw
[1:29:58] my hands out and have a mannerism to
[1:30:00] impress you or to say a buzzword that'll
[1:30:02] get you going no but if I stay with the
[1:30:05] word the Holy Spirit is upon you will
[1:30:08] bring forth exactly what he said it
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:13] that should be the name of the well I'm
[1:30:26] glad there's young preachers coming up
[1:30:32] brother Aaron when I fall apart in five
[1:30:34] minutes you just come right here and
[1:30:36] help me so let me just say a couple
[1:30:40] things
[1:30:41] brother Branham said here he said in
[1:30:43] prayer and how can I overcome the
[1:30:46] message how can overcome which which
[1:30:48] incidentally my father was at that
[1:30:50] meeting he wasn't a believer only
[1:30:52] service my dad was ever at was how can I
[1:30:54] overcome he slept through the whole
[1:30:57] thing so hey man everything there's a
[1:31:04] purpose and a time now he said Lord
[1:31:11] we're standing here trying to take your
[1:31:13] word and explain it to the people how to
[1:31:15] overcome you told us how it's done
[1:31:18] you didn't only tell us but you showed
[1:31:20] us you let us you showed us how to do it
[1:31:25] you showed us receive the word inside of
[1:31:28] us and be sure to hold to that word it
[1:31:31] is written in every temptation but be
[1:31:34] humble and walk humbly then we have
[1:31:37] conquered through you through your power
[1:31:39] which has already conquered our enemy
[1:31:42] and the only thing we have to do is walk
[1:31:44] humble with faith believing that in our
[1:31:46] badge of identification of the Holy
[1:31:48] Ghost and Satan has to move again he
[1:31:54] said in a man running from the presence
[1:31:55] of the Lord he said may all the great
[1:31:57] mysteries how many believe the mysteries
[1:31:58] have been unveiled now it's not a
[1:32:01] minister's job to make him more
[1:32:02] mysterious alright he said may all the
[1:32:05] great mysteries that we're supposed to
[1:32:06] know at this age be unveiled to us Lord
[1:32:09] and will see the plainness of God so
[1:32:12] that we'll know how to behave ourselves
[1:32:13] an act
[1:32:15] and correct ourselves and bring the
[1:32:18] members of our body into discipline to
[1:32:20] the word that we might know how to live
[1:32:23] in this present day at the approaching
[1:32:25] all the Lord Jesus
[1:32:28] you mean the mysteries were supposed to
[1:32:30] come so that I could know how to live
[1:32:36] man's made to rule but he's made to rule
[1:32:39] by the Word of God so then again he said
[1:32:45] in the Laodicean Church age he says now
[1:32:47] we came naked physically into the world
[1:32:49] but naked we won't go out there's only
[1:32:50] one thing we're take with us and that is
[1:32:53] our character then he goes on to call
[1:32:56] this age a character less age if we ever
[1:32:59] had an age where everything is blended
[1:33:02] together and there's no character
[1:33:03] there's no character of man there's no
[1:33:05] character of woman there's no character
[1:33:07] of goodness hey man if you want to be a
[1:33:09] girl you can be a girl if you want to be
[1:33:11] a boy you can be a boy you can be trans
[1:33:13] you can be whatever you want to be you
[1:33:15] can marry a box you can marry a desk you
[1:33:17] can marry a cat and that's the truth I'm
[1:33:19] not even joking that's the age we live
[1:33:21] in character less but it's in that most
[1:33:25] evil age why did God pull a bride in the
[1:33:28] most evil age he called a bride dare to
[1:33:31] prove to Satan that this woman would not
[1:33:34] be like the first one but this woman
[1:33:36] would stand upon the word through the
[1:33:38] test of the word
[1:33:40] and believe it still laying a foundation
[1:33:49] here again he said in Satan's Eden as a
[1:33:52] businessman that's not a Christian now
[1:33:53] Satan's calling I'm in risk use me
[1:33:55] brother man was calling Satan a
[1:33:57] businessman and he tells he there he
[1:33:58] said as a businessman that's not a
[1:34:00] Christian here work every scheme he can
[1:34:02] to make you see something the wrong way
[1:34:05] so Satan's in the business of making you
[1:34:08] look at the word the wrong way why
[1:34:11] because the word produces character
[1:34:14] hey man again he goes on to say if he's
[1:34:18] got a purpose and a personal gain and
[1:34:20] make you doing that making you see it
[1:34:22] that way he'll show you everything he
[1:34:23] can and keep you off from the truth of
[1:34:26] it because he's only got a feeling for
[1:34:28] himself and then he goes on to saying
[1:34:31] that's why Satan has done this and he's
[1:34:33] worked through the ministry the ministry
[1:34:40] to do what to try to get the people to
[1:34:42] see something the wrong way now you
[1:34:48] forgive me you have to go ahead and
[1:34:50] forgive me right off the front ok so
[1:34:53] again why would God call a people in
[1:34:56] this most evil age now what did God call
[1:34:59] this age - a prophet of God he called it
[1:35:01] harvest time they ought to see an ageist
[1:35:06] harvest time that's what he said in
[1:35:07] resume of the age it's harvest time the
[1:35:09] gathering together of the tares and of
[1:35:11] the wheat he called it harvest time he
[1:35:16] called it the rapture in time he called
[1:35:18] it the wheat time he caught it the bride
[1:35:20] aged why it's the age of maturity it's
[1:35:26] the age when the word has gone back
[1:35:28] looking like the first one it's the age
[1:35:32] Amen where the prophet of God was
[1:35:34] successful Malachi for turning the
[1:35:37] hearts of the people back to the
[1:35:39] original faith again that's the
[1:35:41] age that we live in can you say man so
[1:35:46] then brother branham said in this age
[1:35:48] that the bride will be tried by the
[1:35:51] words so now you see everything Satan
[1:35:56] can throw brother Jack every doctor and
[1:35:58] every man everything he can throw in
[1:36:00] this age is God allowing it it's not a
[1:36:04] tragedy when your church gets split by
[1:36:06] false doctrine it's God allowing it
[1:36:10] because he is trying to people God would
[1:36:13] rather have two people believe the word
[1:36:15] and 500 people that don't God would
[1:36:19] rather have one that stands on a word
[1:36:20] and 5000 that act like another preacher
[1:36:23] come on somebody help me with one man
[1:36:26] God can take one man and take a dominant
[1:36:30] super force and bring for nothing
[1:36:32] one man was a beard in 80 years old
[1:36:35] walked down to Egypt and said let my
[1:36:38] people go
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:44] praise the Lord
[1:36:46] so I'll start this meeting this service
[1:36:50] by saying this what would cause a
[1:36:53] revival to die out tell you what would
[1:37:00] cause a revival to die out says when man
[1:37:02] leave the world
[1:37:06] what's God has never left his people
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:13] let's take my opening scripture now
[1:37:15] first Kings 11 yeah please thank you the
[1:37:30] opportunities of godly Dominion first
[1:37:33] Kings 11:28 I'm going to talk to you for
[1:37:36] the this time the Ranger of this time on
[1:37:39] this man by the name of Jeroboam helm
[1:37:41] he's ever heard of him
[1:37:43] the Bible says he was a mighty man of
[1:37:46] Valor in Solomon's scene the young man
[1:37:49] that he was industrious he's creative
[1:37:51] he's gifted he made him rule over all
[1:37:58] the charge of the house of Joseph it
[1:38:02] came to pass at that time when Jeroboam
[1:38:04] went out of Jerusalem now now watch for
[1:38:06] a minute man jerub-baal thank you
[1:38:09] brother Jack Jeroboam not to be bossy
[1:38:13] but can you open it Ilia thank you
[1:38:23] Jeroboam is given a position he's gifted
[1:38:27] he's given a position by the church
[1:38:29] though
[1:38:34] that the church can look at him and see
[1:38:36] this man's gifted he can help the people
[1:38:38] he's industrious and the king himself
[1:38:41] list him to this position being tests
[1:38:44] being over the house of Joseph it was
[1:38:47] told of of Jeroboam that Jeroboam is the
[1:38:50] one that completed the walls of
[1:38:52] Jerusalem at that time and it came to
[1:38:56] pass at that time now it's not only he's
[1:38:59] caught the eye of man he's caught the
[1:39:01] eye of God at that time when Jeroboam
[1:39:04] when I'm Jerusalem the prophet Elijah
[1:39:06] the shillin I found him in the way and
[1:39:08] he had clad himself with a new garment
[1:39:10] and they were alone in the field and not
[1:39:12] the way God does to you then look you
[1:39:14] may be put in somewhere by a man but
[1:39:16] then God gets ahold of you here Bowie to
[1:39:18] the side by yourself and the world of a
[1:39:21] prophet comes to you by yourself because
[1:39:23] that's how he works with individuals and
[1:39:24] he begins to reveal to him now Solomon
[1:39:27] didn't hear this it was Jeroboam that
[1:39:29] was hearing this a word of the Prophet
[1:39:31] now you know what that has put everyone
[1:39:33] of us on the level playing field here
[1:39:35] this morning we have all heard the word
[1:39:37] of a prophet and hopefully not just
[1:39:39] corporately but we're hearing it
[1:39:41] individually and they caught the new
[1:39:51] garment a highs across the new garments
[1:39:53] on him in here in it in 12 pieces and he
[1:39:55] said to Jeroboam take the 10 pieces for
[1:39:58] thus saith the Lord the god I hear
[1:40:01] Israel behold I will wring the kingdom
[1:40:03] out of the hand of Solomon and will give
[1:40:05] ten tribes to thee power but he Solomon
[1:40:13] shall have one to try for my servant
[1:40:15] David sake and for Jerusalem's sake the
[1:40:17] city which I have chosen out of all the
[1:40:21] tribes of Israel because that they have
[1:40:25] forsaken me your revivals died out they
[1:40:29] have forsaken me and have worship
[1:40:33] asteroth the goddess of the sidonians
[1:40:35] and k-much the god of the mall bites of
[1:40:37] Malcolm the God of the children of Ammon
[1:40:39] and have not walked in my ways to do
[1:40:43] that which is right in my eyes
[1:40:45] and to keep my statutes and my judgment
[1:40:47] as did David his father I'll be it
[1:40:51] I'll not take the whole kingdom out of
[1:40:53] his hand but I'll make him Prince all
[1:40:55] the days of his life for David my
[1:40:58] servants sake whom I chose because he
[1:41:00] kept my Commandments and my statues now

[1:41:04] Jack that he gave this is the third
[1:41:06] generation REO bulma's they're fixing to
[1:41:08] come out of Solomon right this is the
[1:41:11] third generation from David amen in the
[1:41:14] years he said now he said but I'll take
[1:41:16] the kingdom out of his son's hand out of
[1:41:18] Solomon's hand the third generation I'll
[1:41:20] give it unto you ten tribes and unto his
[1:41:23] son I'll give one tribe that David my
[1:41:26] servant may have a light always before
[1:41:28] me in Jerusalem this is important in
[1:41:32] Jerusalem the city which I have chosen
[1:41:34] me to put my name there then God said
[1:41:37] where I put my name you're not going to
[1:41:39] change and I'll take you I will take you
[1:41:47] and you will reign according to all that
[1:41:50] your soul desires you know that God is
[1:41:56] here this morning to release into you
[1:41:59] all that you desire in him God will give
[1:42:04] you your souls desire that's not my word
[1:42:09] that's the word of the Prophet a man and
[1:42:13] he says and if thou shalt be if you will
[1:42:18] hearken unto all that I command thee and
[1:42:20] will walk in my way and do what is right
[1:42:23] my sight to keep my statutes and my
[1:42:25] Commandments as David my servant did and
[1:42:28] I will be with you and build the assur
[1:42:31] house as I built for David and will give
[1:42:34] Israel unto thee now God is not a man
[1:42:38] that he should lie he meant exactly what
[1:42:42] he said that if you follow my word I'll
[1:42:46] make your house sure
[1:42:47] and I'll give Israel to you I'm giving
[1:42:52] you ten tribes now but if you follow me
[1:42:56] I'll do more
[1:42:57] I'll prosper your house it'll be like a
[1:43:01] sure house of David what was in the
[1:43:03] house of David Heyman there was great
[1:43:05] victory in the house of David Giants
[1:43:07] were killed repentance was in his house
[1:43:10] man and David himself didn't even have
[1:43:13] to get all the glory when he found out
[1:43:15] he couldn't build the tabernacle he went
[1:43:17] up and laid up treasures for it so that
[1:43:19] the coming generation could go out and
[1:43:22] it could be built in there let me tell
[1:43:24] you this is not about all of us
[1:43:25] preachers it's about the word o'clock
[1:43:27] going out so that the next generation
[1:43:30] can rise up in faith and know they are
[1:43:32] in the world there's no big eyes or
[1:43:35] little use in here
[1:43:42] hey man and I will for this afflict the
[1:43:47] seat of David what is he going to
[1:43:48] afflict the seat of David for the houses
[1:43:50] of Devils they built amen afflict them
[1:43:56] because they left the word but I will
[1:43:58] not forever
[1:43:59] grace marvelous grace now watch this is
[1:44:04] very interesting Solomon therefore
[1:44:06] sought to kill Jeroboam into something
[1:44:09] that as soon as the word comes to you
[1:44:11] you're a target here's a man that's
[1:44:15] hurdle it to ear from Gaea from God and
[1:44:17] God as has given him wisdom like no
[1:44:19] other King but that man now tuck the
[1:44:21] same spirit that Saul had because
[1:44:23] spirits don't die and he tries to kill
[1:44:25] one God as anointing and he said Solomon
[1:44:31] salt therefore to kill Jeroboam and
[1:44:33] here's where Jeroboam made a great
[1:44:35] mistake he has the word of the Lord and
[1:44:39] he arose and fled into Egypt there's
[1:44:44] always somebody going to give you a
[1:44:45] refuge outside of the word you can
[1:44:50] always find a pulpit to preach in that
[1:44:51] will compromise there's always gonna be
[1:44:57] somebody outside of the word that'll be
[1:44:59] your friend all you gotta do is post it
[1:45:01] on Instagram or social media
[1:45:04] you'll have a sympathizing spirit out
[1:45:06] there that'll sympathize with your
[1:45:08] affliction but if you're a believer if
[1:45:11] Jeroboam would have just stayed with the
[1:45:13] word he did not have to go down to Egypt
[1:45:17] you have to go to the world to find your
[1:45:20] resource even we have a source this
[1:45:23] morning there is a fountain open in the
[1:45:26] house of the Kings after him whether one
[1:45:32] of the King is her father there's a
[1:45:33] greater king that is given him his word
[1:45:36] and where the king is
[1:45:37] there is power
[1:45:41] who you want to believe an earthly king
[1:45:43] or the heavenly king the earthly king
[1:45:46] wants to kill you the heavenly King says
[1:45:48] I'll make your house sure he's not gonna
[1:45:51] lie well God saw it will kill me if I
[1:45:54] stay here but I'm the power of
[1:45:56] Resurrection I'll raise you up again you
[1:45:58] just stay with my word even if it meets
[1:46:00] your life so he takes refuge in Egypt he
[1:46:08] went to the wrong place in this crisis
[1:46:09] you always to tell you about the
[1:46:11] character of people what they do in a
[1:46:13] time of crisis where they go find out
[1:46:18] the challenge of a pastor brother Jack
[1:46:20] is as you can't judge the situation by
[1:46:22] the emotion and everybody wants to judge
[1:46:24] it emotion you got a judgment by the
[1:46:25] word if you want to come out live you
[1:46:27] got to judge it by the word but
[1:46:29] everybody else they want to judge it by
[1:46:31] emotion you know the young people I
[1:46:33] don't have no friends my friends went to
[1:46:35] the world while they're cutting their
[1:46:36] hair why can't I cut my hair they're
[1:46:37] doing this why can't I do that
[1:46:39] they're doing it that's emotion where's
[1:46:42] the word and if we have a sure message
[1:46:48] it's different brother banners message
[1:46:50] this is not currently devised fables
[1:46:52] this is not a Mormon Bible this is not
[1:46:54] another message outside of the Bible
[1:46:55] come on churches here's the Bible
[1:46:59] he's talking in the office back there
[1:47:01] and I had I had a sister I had a woman
[1:47:03] excuse me come to the church and she she
[1:47:05] was had hair up to here and she was
[1:47:07] sitting in sitting in the in the
[1:47:10] churches she began to read a track that
[1:47:12] we had out there in a vestibule the
[1:47:13] original sin and says he got so angry at
[1:47:15] reading that that she jumped up and ran
[1:47:17] out of the church I used that met you
[1:47:18] that bent our church you know where in
[1:47:19] the country we're way out in the middle
[1:47:21] of nowhere she disappeared off the
[1:47:22] ground so you ran so we had deacons
[1:47:24] going up and down the road looking for
[1:47:26] her and there was a there was a lane
[1:47:29] across the street said no trespassing of
[1:47:31] course that's where she was a man she
[1:47:33] was way up that road and sitting on
[1:47:35] somebody's house and porch and so I went
[1:47:38] up there and I found her sitting there
[1:47:40] and I and I said I started out by
[1:47:42] calling her sister which was the wrong
[1:47:44] thing to do because that made her
[1:47:45] angrier said I'm not your sister don't
[1:47:47] call me that so I so I start calling her
[1:47:49] ma'am I said let's go this is no this is
[1:47:51] private property let's just go back and
[1:47:52] talk about what's troubling you she goes
[1:47:54] well I'll tell you what's troubling me
[1:47:55] says is your your church is a cult
[1:47:57] they're in a cult and your people need
[1:47:59] to be helped and they need to be exposed
[1:48:00] to realize here they're just following a
[1:48:02] man and in a cult
[1:48:04] and I said well let's go back here and
[1:48:06] talk about we're still trespassing and
[1:48:08] so thus we begin to walk back to the
[1:48:11] church and and she put her hand up when
[1:48:13] it came and said Oh God deliver those
[1:48:14] people bring him out of their bondage so
[1:48:16] forth she's praying like and I says
[1:48:18] ma'am I said you know what my daddy was
[1:48:20] just like you he hated the message he
[1:48:22] said her brother bamps in heaven I don't
[1:48:24] want to go she goes bless his heart and
[1:48:26] I said yeah and he's the one that built
[1:48:27] that church
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:32] hallelujah amen that's why you get angry
[1:48:35] about it if it's an honest anger God
[1:48:37] will it God will come in and here show
[1:48:39] you if you're really sincere so I would
[1:48:41] took her out under the pavilion here so
[1:48:42] let's just sit down and talk and she
[1:48:44] goes well you guys are wrong about cut
[1:48:46] here let's talk about the Bible let's
[1:48:48] let's talk about 1st Corinthians 11 I
[1:48:50] said okay no problem it doesn't mean
[1:48:53] what you guys say it means she began to
[1:48:56] quote man and books and terminologies at
[1:48:59] brother Aaron I'm not even sure if you
[1:49:01] would understood even though you're a
[1:49:02] lawyer you might I might have needed you
[1:49:04] there so you could have said but I told
[1:49:06] her I says ma'am that word is not in the
[1:49:07] Bible that's it
[1:49:10] let's bring it back to the Bible so she
[1:49:12] kept quoting men and I kept quoting the
[1:49:15] Bible she quoted another thing and I
[1:49:17] quoted a Bible she got mad again she
[1:49:19] jumped up out of her chair and says I
[1:49:20] know where you're getting that I said
[1:49:22] well where am I getting I'm just quoting
[1:49:23] the Bible she goes you're getting that
[1:49:24] from William Branham I says ma'am that
[1:49:27] you're not my sister ma'am you have just
[1:49:30] gave William Branham the greatest
[1:49:32] compliment you could I have not stopped
[1:49:35] quoting the scripture you have quoted
[1:49:37] denominations you've quoted men but a
[1:49:40] prophet will always take it back to the
[1:49:42] word
[1:49:44] amen brother and sister the message we
[1:49:47] have is not built upon sand it's built
[1:49:50] upon a solid rock the rock of salvation
[1:49:54] the rock of Revelation and the gates of
[1:49:57] Hell will not prevail
[1:50:01] it's not an organization we're not in an
[1:50:04] organization we're not in the
[1:50:05] denomination it's men that's done that
[1:50:07] we got word from heaven heaven the
[1:50:10] reason it's called the message the
[1:50:11] message is not an unbiblical term it's
[1:50:13] not the right for turn brother Darrin
[1:50:15] you you're more grammatically correct
[1:50:17] than I am
[1:50:18] amen what did I just say unbiblical yes
[1:50:23] it's not an unbiblical term a man John
[1:50:26] wrote in the end of and in his books he
[1:50:28] said this then is the message that you
[1:50:30] have heard why the message brother
[1:50:32] branham said is the current word amen
[1:50:35] being brought to pass the current
[1:50:37] promise being brought to pass it is not
[1:50:40] a william branham terminology it is a
[1:50:41] God terminology
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:46] and man has no copyright over God why
[1:50:51] because the world is meant to quicken
[1:50:53] his seed and his seed is his not man
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:50:59] let's look at jeroboams just a moment
[1:51:02] let's take your study the opportunity of
[1:51:06] godly Dominion the Jews say that the
[1:51:11] name of Jeroboam means if you look it up
[1:51:13] his meaning me his mean name spear yes
[1:51:16] then that great I'm gonna start a new
[1:51:18] language right here in the public amen
[1:51:21] Jeroboam means the people contend so the
[1:51:23] Jews say it means it means that his want
[1:51:27] his name means one that cause strife
[1:51:29] between the people and their heavenly
[1:51:32] Father a man who calls strife between
[1:51:37] the people and their heavenly Father now
[1:51:44] the opportunity that he has to walk with
[1:51:48] the world the word that when it came to
[1:51:52] him he was a servant but it lists him
[1:51:56] from servant to king only a king can do
[1:52:02] that only a king can make a servant a
[1:52:07] king and you also were servants to sing
[1:52:13] but he hath made us kings only a king
[1:52:20] can make you a king and he's been made a
[1:52:26] king if he will walk with the Lord every
[1:52:33] one of you had that same opportunity
[1:52:34] this morning the opportunity of revival
[1:52:41] we just read to you the opportunities
[1:52:43] that were just described in God was
[1:52:45] there to give him the desires of his
[1:52:49] heart but there is a test that comes
[1:52:53] with that word and that is can you stay
[1:52:57] with the word there is a consequence of
[1:53:02] turning from the word he already has a
[1:53:06] word of a profit that prophesizes
[1:53:08] Dominion God wants him to rule in godly
[1:53:12] Dominion so as the scripture says he's a
[1:53:15] mighty man of Valor scripture says he's
[1:53:18] industrious he's a gifted man and where
[1:53:20] there is a man with the gift Satan is
[1:53:22] there to try and deceive that man so
[1:53:24] that that gift itself will become a
[1:53:26] stumbling place to the people right so
[1:53:30] as soon as the word comes to Jeroboam
[1:53:33] Solomon tries to kill him just like Amen
[1:53:38] as the word comes to you Satan will try
[1:53:40] to take away the desire you have in him
[1:53:45] and make it about you now let's read
[1:53:50] another scripture this is this is
[1:53:51] jumping over a lot of history but we're
[1:53:54] going to go back through it and you just
[1:53:55] you just just bear with me if we don't
[1:53:59] finish it all this morning we're finish
[1:54:00] it tomorrow morning and the 20th verse
[1:54:04] of 2nd King 17 we haven't read yet what
[1:54:08] Jeroboam did but we're going to show you
[1:54:10] the results of what he did and the Lord
[1:54:14] rejected all the seed of Israel and
[1:54:19] afflicted him and delivered them into
[1:54:21] the hand of spoilers until he had cast
[1:54:23] them out of his sight for he rent Israel
[1:54:27] from the house of David and they made
[1:54:28] Jeroboam the son of the bat King and
[1:54:30] Jeroboam drove Israel from following the
[1:54:33] Lord he drove his row from following the
[1:54:37] Lord and made them sinned a great sin
[1:54:40] for the children I listen to st. all
[1:54:42] gonna be depressing this morning alright
[1:54:44] this is a man's opportunity for the
[1:54:48] children of Israel walked in all the
[1:54:50] sins of jeroboam what you did there had
[1:54:51] to be a man show them how to walk in
[1:54:53] sand
[1:54:55] ah but to them it wasn't sin to them it
[1:55:02] was God so the children of Israel walked
[1:55:07] in all the sins of jeroboam which he did
[1:55:09] and they departed not from them until
[1:55:12] now watch until the Lord removed Israel
[1:55:15] out of his sight as he had said by all
[1:55:18] his servants of prophets so was Israel
[1:55:20] carried away out of their own land to
[1:55:22] Assyria unto this day so what is it
[1:55:25] about this man Jeroboam Jeroboam
[1:55:28] inaugurates the policy that Israel's
[1:55:32] going to follow there has to be an
[1:55:34] idolaters before there's an idolatry
[1:55:40] okay there has to be something in a
[1:55:41] man's heart before there's the act that
[1:55:45] comes forth the sin does not force
[1:55:48] itself into Israel it's introduced by a
[1:55:51] king sin is introduced by a man in power
[1:55:59] and it's up to the people to believe it
[1:56:07] opportunity now let's just let's just
[1:56:11] just just give you a preference
[1:56:13] yeah 16 if you read the northern
[1:56:16] kingdoms of Israel there was 19 kings in
[1:56:19] Israel and Northern Kingdom and 16 of
[1:56:22] them follow Jeroboam 16 out of 19
[1:56:27] followed the sin a Jeroboam 16 of 19
[1:56:34] hundreds of years after Jeroboam as
[1:56:37] spirit was still there so now look at
[1:56:41] the opportunity given to him I want to
[1:56:44] drive that home God has given him his
[1:56:48] heart's desire in the word and in his
[1:56:53] house this would not only mean Amen
[1:56:56] himself it would mean his children God
[1:57:00] is here not just to save you
[1:57:03] he's here to save your children for this
[1:57:06] promises unto you and unto your children
[1:57:11] brother Branham said your attitude you
[1:57:13] take to Christ will have a great effect
[1:57:15] on your children so watch what he said
[1:57:19] now amen I promise you a sure house if
[1:57:22] you stay with the word so what is
[1:57:24] Jeroboam offered he's offered a revival
[1:57:27] I'll give you a revival with God what
[1:57:32] other what other revival do you want he
[1:57:34] offered him the flame of God he offered
[1:57:37] him an established house of God the
[1:57:41] potential that laid in that land to
[1:57:45] follow God would be generational
[1:57:52] generational but Garibaldi never loved
[1:57:58] what God had told him when God opened
[1:58:03] the word to him he just never loved it
[1:58:06] so let's look for a moment at the
[1:58:08] spirits that get involved in the
[1:58:09] downfall of this man we'll see spirits
[1:58:12] don't die they're still here in this age
[1:58:14] still making men in power take away from
[1:58:18] the word or turn away from the
[1:58:21] opportunity have we ever had an age you
[1:58:26] just excuse me we ever had an age where
[1:58:29] we've seen men making themselves God
[1:58:31] more than this age in the message men
[1:58:39] making themself God men receiving
[1:58:42] worship as God have we ever seen it
[1:58:46] happen and where did it come from it was
[1:58:49] introduced by men in power through
[1:58:54] doctrine you just forget me I'm not
[1:58:59] going to be an evangelist this morning
[1:59:01] amen brother Branham said I might drop a
[1:59:05] little something here now we're of the
[1:59:07] people that still believe
[1:59:09] and and just let you know brother Bantam
[1:59:12] said and the layout of see nature could
[1:59:14] be the resume age a resume of the ages
[1:59:17] you know that is we get a little older
[1:59:19] brothers all you older brothers
[1:59:20] sympathize with me some things blur
[1:59:21] event even your eyes and and and and so
[1:59:26] brother venom said that there's art
[1:59:29] there's has to be teachers to bring the
[1:59:33] tears to have maturity but who did God
[1:59:38] give to bring the wheat to maturity
[1:59:42] brother Branham says that God gave
[1:59:45] Malachi for to bring the wheat to
[1:59:48] maturity so if I preach what Malachi for
[1:59:52] priests I'm not preaching my own message
[1:59:54] this morning I'm preaching of indicated
[1:59:57] divinely vindicated full message from
[2:00:00] the throne of God that matures the
[2:00:03] people of God not by my might not by my
[2:00:06] power but by his spirit saith the Lord
[2:00:10] [Applause]
[2:00:15] lelou you now he said he said now the
[2:00:18] two spirits Matthew 24 he said the two
[2:00:20] spirits in this last day would be so
[2:00:23] close it would to see the very elect if
[2:00:24] it possible now I said if you look at
[2:00:26] right hand and a left hand they both got
[2:00:28] thumbs they got fingers they got nails
[2:00:30] they got small fingers middle fingers
[2:00:32] index all different fingers and they're
[2:00:34] both thumb prints only one just turn one
[2:00:36] way and one the other but they're both
[2:00:38] the same they're made the same the thumb
[2:00:40] prints everything is identically alike
[2:00:42] the only difference is the
[2:00:43] characteristic of it one thumb turns in
[2:00:46] this some turns in so they're not
[2:00:47] turning the same way the only difference
[2:00:49] is the characteristic they look the same
[2:00:53] the only difference is the
[2:00:54] characteristic ones left ones right
[2:00:57] that's the only difference and that's
[2:00:59] the way the spirits will be in the last
[2:01:02] day they look just exactly the same but
[2:01:07] only the characteristic is different one
[2:01:11] of them will be right yeah they will be
[2:01:13] wrong you're only known by the
[2:01:14] characteristic of God just perfectly
[2:01:18] amen so the only way you can know it is
[2:01:20] by characteristics that's in the message
[2:01:22] God is in
[2:01:23] I'd buy his characteristics 1964 March
[2:01:25] 11th now david told us in the book of
[2:01:29] psalms he said that god refused the
[2:01:31] tabernacle of joseph and he chose not
[2:01:32] the tribe of ephraim oh who came out of
[2:01:34] the tribe of ephraim Jeroboam but he
[2:01:38] would have he would have took him but he
[2:01:48] chose and where was he from in Ephraim
[2:01:50] was Shiloh and in Shiloh where the
[2:01:52] tabernacle was at first you know into
[2:01:54] something that people that think they
[2:01:56] have the message first think that they
[2:01:57] have the right to the entire message and
[2:02:02] it's where Shiloh was was in ephraim and
[2:02:05] we say well in my tribe was Joshua who
[2:02:07] did you have in yours well and so but he
[2:02:14] said I chose the tribe of Judah to the
[2:02:15] Mount Zion which he loved so now we
[2:02:20] don't think of spirits as opinions and
[2:02:22] so forth but that's how they present
[2:02:23] themselves their present themselves as
[2:02:25] spirits or present themselves in
[2:02:27] attitudes that present themselves an
[2:02:28] idea in ideas and brother Graham said
[2:02:31] Satan see he said right here at this
[2:02:32] last age he said all the deceit intact
[2:02:36] to every tactic to Satan has ever used
[2:02:37] and been successful with to deceive with
[2:02:40] he's gathered it all together and
[2:02:41] reinforced himself and he came down like
[2:02:45] God now what did I just say little bit
[2:02:47] ago that people were making himself God
[2:02:51] you see now there's a fine line to be in
[2:02:56] God and being identified in him there's
[2:03:01] a fine line to saying I am God or saying
[2:03:04] she is him power of his power life of
[2:03:09] his life come on there's a fine line
[2:03:13] between I'm him or I'm God you see
[2:03:16] because there's another spirit coming
[2:03:18] down through the ages and it's called
[2:03:20] that Catholic spirit where they put the
[2:03:22] woman before the man
[2:03:23] a man they put the lowman as the
[2:03:26] intercessor instead of the man as the
[2:03:28] intercessor there's a fine line between
[2:03:34] you being the judge and the Holy Spirit
[2:03:36] in you judging right I hope this is a
[2:03:43] revival hey man brother Ram said there's
[2:03:47] three powers that Satan attacks with
[2:03:49] three powers are making the devil that's
[2:03:50] political power religious power demon
[2:03:52] powers they all mix together
[2:03:55] Satan's the king of politics I'm sorry
[2:03:59] sorry if that offended you here on the
[2:04:01] East Coast but he is still the king of
[2:04:04] politics
[2:04:05] don't try it out with him see now fourth
[2:04:11] generation we all just become political
[2:04:13] hey man now we're gonna learn a lesson
[2:04:18] here from two kings King Jeroboam and
[2:04:21] King ray of bone what God offered to
[2:04:25] Jeroboam when Israel was divided he
[2:04:28] offered him a house like he built David
[2:04:30] I'll be with you this is the offering he
[2:04:32] gave him but the lesson here is
[2:04:35] immediately after the word comes to
[2:04:37] Jeroboam the test comes from a man in
[2:04:39] power he runs to Egypt there he's
[2:04:41] corrupted because he's given a wife in
[2:04:43] Egypt if we get entangled in a
[2:04:47] relationship in the wrong place then
[2:04:51] we're going to try to bring it back to
[2:04:52] God's promised land and he said but
[2:04:57] she's so beautiful brother Danny but
[2:04:59] yeah but it said the king gave the
[2:05:01] Pharaoh gave this woman to Jeroboam you
[2:05:09] know not only does God show you you have
[2:05:11] potential but Satan recognizes your
[2:05:13] potential if I can just Wed you off to
[2:05:18] something a little bit off it'll affect
[2:05:22] your worship it affect everything you do
[2:05:25] it affect the way you walk it affect the
[2:05:27] way you filter low
[2:05:28] how many of us if we started out in the
[2:05:31] wrong place in the message listen we've
[2:05:33] all been there brother Jack we're false
[2:05:35] doctor tries to come through what does
[2:05:37] false doctrine do it becomes our filter
[2:05:39] it's how we think about any quote any
[2:05:42] scripture we think well what is so and
[2:05:43] so think about that and so we raise up
[2:05:47] apostles and somehow apostles become
[2:05:49] above the Prophet and we didn't realize
[2:05:54] we just got given a life we got a wife
[2:06:06] that's gonna help you how to think the
[2:06:13] opportunity the opportunity of godly
[2:06:17] Dominion hey there's only one way any of
[2:06:20] us can be cleaning this higher if we are
[2:06:22] the children of God we gotta be like
[2:06:23] Aaron and his sons we gotta be taken by
[2:06:26] the Prophet before the congregation and
[2:06:28] watched in the prophetic word washed of
[2:06:31] your ideas washed of your opinions
[2:06:33] washed of the way you think the message
[2:06:35] is let God wash you
[2:06:41] that's not the way my culture teaches
[2:06:43] away with your culture away with your
[2:06:47] countries we come from a heavenly
[2:06:49] country my this world it's not my home
[2:06:52] I'm just a passing through brother we're
[2:06:55] not from Malawi or Haiti a Minar America

[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:07] we have just passed I pulled over into
[2:08:15] the side where they wrestled me we've
[2:08:17] just passed the 75th anniversary of
[2:08:20] Auschwitz and the Holocaust I read an
[2:08:24] account of a man is a doctor of
[2:08:27] psychology him and his he was in his
[2:08:34] early 20th at his wife was in the early
[2:08:35] twenties I think she was 24 or so so he
[2:08:38] was around the same age they didn't have
[2:08:41] any children and he's both taken into
[2:08:43] the concentration camp and in there he
[2:08:49] lost everything his wife was killed they
[2:08:53] would tell him in there where's my wife
[2:08:55] and the people had been in there for for
[2:08:57] time they'd look point to the smoke
[2:08:59] coming out Jimmy says there goes your
[2:09:00] wife they lost everything he said I felt
[2:09:03] like as I was coming in there that's
[2:09:07] coming in there Barun my wife was dead
[2:09:11] and I was childless I'd have no children
[2:09:13] it said the only thing I took with me
[2:09:16] was my clothes on my back and I had
[2:09:18] smuggled in in my coat a manuscript I
[2:09:20] had written of a scientific manuscript
[2:09:24] so but they took us into a shed and they
[2:09:28] told us to strip all our clothes off and
[2:09:30] I couldn't hide that manuscript anymore
[2:09:31] he said I even lost Eddie six wives I
[2:09:33] was childless in my scientific world now
[2:09:37] he's childless physically I had no wife
[2:09:41] now
[2:09:41] not only that they shaved every hit or
[2:09:44] every hair off of my body and they put a
[2:09:47] number on my my body and I no longer had
[2:09:50] a name they took my heritage away they
[2:09:53] took my name away they took my identity
[2:09:55] away they took my possessions away they
[2:09:58] took my family away now all I am is a
[2:10:01] number I cannot be referred to as a name
[2:10:04] I'm a number
[2:10:06] and then they made me put on a coat in
[2:10:09] clothes of a man who's already been
[2:10:11] burnt in the crematorium
[2:10:13] I'm putting on a dead man's clothes now
[2:10:16] I want to tell you friend you think you
[2:10:17] lost everything I'll tell you the power
[2:10:20] where the word of a king is there's
[2:10:22] power he said I reached into that
[2:10:25] said I've lost everything said I've lost
[2:10:26] my my scientific baby I'll have no baby
[2:10:29] in the physical I said I've lost my
[2:10:30] identity have lost everything he said
[2:10:32] but I reached in that pocket and in
[2:10:34] there was at one page of paper torn out
[2:10:37] of the prayer book of the Jews and it
[2:10:40] was the holiest prayer here o Israel the
[2:10:43] Lord your God is one God then you shall
[2:10:47] love him with all your heart and with
[2:10:51] all your soul I want you to know it
[2:10:53] don't matter where death is and loss
[2:10:55] here's where the world of a king is
[2:10:57] there is power and it's a supreme word
[2:11:03] Satan may act like he's in control but
[2:11:06] one slip of paper brought a man up from
[2:11:09] the ground still have meaning in my life
[2:11:15] that's what one word from God will do to
[2:11:17] you the enemy wants to take your meeting
[2:11:20] take your purpose take your identity but
[2:11:22] one word from God here old Israel they
[2:11:27] might have took your name what I call
[2:11:29] you Israel a prince with clock
[2:11:32] your prints with God yes somebody left
[2:11:36] power was God you may have lost your
[2:11:39] wife your father your mother your
[2:11:40] children your possessions but I am still
[2:11:43] with you opportunity I kept track of how
[2:11:59] long y'all sung I still got time now
[2:12:14] here is another thing about Jeroboam you
[2:12:16] may not have realized what the Jews the
[2:12:19] reason why a man could make could make
[2:12:23] the decisions he did to make a choice
[2:12:27] that is still being felt today that two
[2:12:32] tribes would have their names blotted
[2:12:34] out from under heaven and they're still
[2:12:36] blotted out today right only in heaven
[2:12:40] were they raised are they restored but
[2:12:43] even today jeroboams decision is still
[2:12:45] moving on took away identity took away
[2:12:49] meaning by an introduction here's the
[2:12:56] thing what he introduced he thought was
[2:12:59] new and it wasn't now here's one way
[2:13:08] that could make it one thing that could
[2:13:10] make him make that step become one of
[2:13:13] the most corrupted King in the history
[2:13:14] of Israel was that people called him the
[2:13:17] second Moses read your Bible you find
[2:13:24] out that when he came back he had built
[2:13:27] cities for a king of one to kill him
[2:13:29] it's what the Bible says built a
[2:13:32] garrison for Solomon Solomon one to kill
[2:13:34] him to Pharaoh when the kyoya is Egypt
[2:13:36] kill the children of Israel but they
[2:13:39] built cities for him and then in rare
[2:13:41] bomb here comes Jeroboam and he asked
[2:13:44] them to relieve the burden upon the
[2:13:47] people Moses went into Pharisees let my
[2:13:49] people go right
[2:13:49] Jeroboam goes to Rael balm and says can
[2:13:52] you not be so hard
[2:13:53] and what did rare balm say said what my
[2:13:56] father did in a little form I'm gonna do
[2:13:58] in the big form
[2:14:00] what did Pharaoh say to Moses I don't
[2:14:03] know that God you're talking about go
[2:14:05] ahead and take the straw away from him
[2:14:09] now here's a man getting an idea he's
[2:14:12] the second coming to Moses there's a way
[2:14:20] you can start introducing things to the
[2:14:23] bride is when you think you're greater
[2:14:25] than the Prophet God sent that somehow
[2:14:28] the people need brother Branham and you
[2:14:33] to explain what brother Branham could
[2:14:36] not if I hurt your feelings it's okay
[2:14:44] because we're judging by the word aren't
[2:14:47] you glad I said that first hey man
[2:14:49] here's a man thinks he's Moses again
[2:14:55] what a positive thing brothers what an
[2:14:59] opportunity you all have you can be
[2:15:02] brother branham again the growth the
[2:15:06] greatest prophet Israel has ever known
[2:15:08] at that time and they're telling a
[2:15:11] servant here just like Moses he didn't
[2:15:20] have the discernment to realize Satan
[2:15:22] had come right in and is offering him a
[2:15:25] God offering I'm gonna give you an
[2:15:32] offering here
[2:15:35] so what did he do he became king of ten
[2:15:39] tribes and now because he's been down in
[2:15:44] Egypt he thinks politically not
[2:15:45] spiritually in spirit he has is a
[2:15:49] worldly one not a spiritual one huh
[2:15:54] III I'm not preaching to any jeroboams
[2:15:57] here hey I'm just telling you about him
[2:16:01] I'm telling him you have an opportunity
[2:16:04] he never has because he turned his down
[2:16:08] you have yours he turned his flame down
[2:16:14] you have yours so now here he is looking
[2:16:20] like Moses so when he take when when Rea
[2:16:26] a bomb takes a throne we can just step
[2:16:28] over into his kingdom for just a moment
[2:16:29] into Rey Obama's Kingdom and find out
[2:16:31] here's a mistake a young King made his
[2:16:34] zeal his zeal for his father's Kingdom
[2:16:40] caused him to judge a situation wrong
[2:16:43] God allowed it because judgment had to
[2:16:47] come in on the house of Solomon but he
[2:16:49] had old counselors and he had young
[2:16:51] counselors the old counselors taught
[2:16:54] peace and the young counselor says bring
[2:17:00] the hammer down young brothers this is
[2:17:08] just just a little word here cuz I was
[2:17:10] also a young but I tried to call myself
[2:17:12] a young brother for as long as I could
[2:17:14] until finally an older brother told me
[2:17:16] you're not young anymore alright but I
[2:17:22] know what it's like to have the seals
[2:17:24] pull the sword but there's a reason
[2:17:27] sometimes older brothers don't pull the
[2:17:29] sword as quick as the younger brothers
[2:17:31] it's not because they're just tired
[2:17:38] why is it brother Jack acting out on
[2:17:41] that situation if I was the pastor God
[2:17:49] is tired of jeroboams
[2:17:53] and he knows if that pastor might move
[2:17:56] too quick that idolatry might spring up
[2:17:58] that much quicker sometimes our zeal to
[2:18:03] cut a head off leaves a vacuum that
[2:18:06] Satan cut comes in on real bomb didn't
[2:18:12] listen now the kingdom is divided and
[2:18:16] Jeroboam takes over ten tribes now let's
[2:18:19] turn to 1st Kings
[2:18:20] 12 I really want to get something real
[2:18:23] fast real fast stay there for an hour -
[2:18:29] now I'm not going to be like a brother I
[2:18:31] know overseas that he preached for eight
[2:18:33] hours and let off for after four hours
[2:18:35] so the kids could go the bathroom
[2:18:36] because they were crying I'm not going
[2:18:38] to do that I promise you
[2:18:39] we're get out on time you have lunch
[2:18:41] because I'm older I need to go back to
[2:18:43] the hotel I have to eat I have to go to
[2:18:44] bed it's cause brother Aaron's
[2:18:46] long-winded a man well your friends
[2:18:49] right or we was hey man
[2:18:52] no brother heard wonderful preach I'm
[2:18:55] just I feel too loose all right all
[2:18:57] right okay first Kings 1225 then
[2:19:02] Jeroboam built second in mount ephraim
[2:19:05] and he dwelt therein and he went out
[2:19:08] from thence and he built Peniel and he
[2:19:11] said in his heart the heart that God
[2:19:14] wanted to have the heart that God said
[2:19:19] I'll give you the desires of that heart
[2:19:21] if you stay with my word he said in his
[2:19:23] heart now shall the kingdom return to
[2:19:28] the house of David he has a word of the
[2:19:31] prophet but he is figuring out the
[2:19:34] message on his own he said if the people
[2:19:38] go up to do sacrifice in the house of
[2:19:40] the Lord of Jerusalem then shall the
[2:19:41] heart of this people turn again into
[2:19:43] their Lord even unto ray of balm king of
[2:19:45] Judah and they shall kill me and go
[2:19:47] again to Ray a bomb King of Judah
[2:19:49] whereupon the king took counsel man is
[2:19:52] this some we just take counsel we always
[2:19:53] fight we can find somebody agree with us
[2:19:54] we think we're right he took counsel and
[2:20:00] they made two calves of gold and sudden
[2:20:03] to them it's too much for you to go up
[2:20:05] to Jerusalem especially to get their
[2:20:07] half-hour early we live in the last age
[2:20:15] it's the more tired people and there's
[2:20:17] ever been it's too hard to go up there
[2:20:19] to Jerusalem then he said I behold like
[2:20:25] God's o Israel which brought thee up out
[2:20:27] of the land of Egypt into something what
[2:20:29] a man built he says this is the power
[2:20:31] that brought you out of Egypt what I
[2:20:32] built brought you up out of Egypt see
[2:20:36] that's the way we all can get
[2:20:37] sidetracked think it's what I preach has
[2:20:39] to be given to the people because that's
[2:20:41] the power of God they didn't just hold
[2:20:52] on put it right back down in the sheath
[2:20:55] already and then he sent one in Bethel
[2:20:58] and one and Dan and this thing became a
[2:21:00] sin for the people went to worship
[2:21:03] before one even unto Dan so what Dan
[2:21:06] isn't way up in the north okay it's a
[2:21:08] long ways away so it's a god of
[2:21:11] convenience it's easier to worship that
[2:21:13] than to make your trick down there to
[2:21:15] Jerusalem three times a year for the
[2:21:17] feast that God is instituted it's just
[2:21:20] go up here God will accept it because
[2:21:22] this is the power that brought him out
[2:21:25] and then he put one in Bethel which is
[2:21:27] only about 12 miles from Jerusalem
[2:21:29] another god of convenience real close
[2:21:31] we're getting to stragglers
[2:21:39] do you know I believe it's 250 years
[2:21:42] later art could be a hundred feet
[2:21:43] there's a big difference 100 years but
[2:21:45] you know anyway 150 or 250 years later
[2:21:47] they still called Bethel the King's
[2:21:49] chapel the courts of the King this is
[2:21:53] where they worship God people's filter
[2:21:56] gets all changed and messed up and he
[2:22:01] made a house of high places and made
[2:22:03] priests of the laws of the people which
[2:22:06] were not of the sons of Levi so this was
[2:22:08] also a spirit against the priesthood
[2:22:10] that ministered we spirits are still
[2:22:13] fired and Jeroboam ordained a feast in
[2:22:19] the eighth month now here's something
[2:22:20] real important on the 15th day of the
[2:22:23] month like unto the feast that was in
[2:22:26] Judah here it's closed it's closed and
[2:22:29] he offered upon the order so did he and
[2:22:32] Bethel
[2:22:32] sacrificing the calves he had made and
[2:22:34] he placed in Bethel the priests of the
[2:22:36] high places which he had made so he
[2:22:37] offered upon the altar which he had made
[2:22:39] in Bethel the fifteenth day of the 8th
[2:22:41] month even in the month which he had
[2:22:44] devised of his own heart he's making up
[2:22:48] his own feast day and he's putting
[2:22:51] importance the eighth month and he
[2:22:54] learned a ordained a feast through the
[2:22:56] children of Israel and he offered upon
[2:22:57] the altar and burnt inside incense now
[2:22:59] history in the Bible tells us those
[2:23:02] Levites that was around Bethel and then
[2:23:05] you see I'm not all just briefing about
[2:23:06] Jeroboam I'm blowing off the Levites in
[2:23:07] brother bands also said the Levites are
[2:23:09] a type of the bride
[2:23:10] he said the Levites around Bethel and
[2:23:13] Dan refused to take part in the worship
[2:23:16] of Jeroboam so Jeroboam left them and
[2:23:20] they left Jeroboam and they went down to
[2:23:22] Jerusalem and made Israel
[2:23:24] strong because they stood upon the world
[2:23:27] and Judah became strong and worshiped
[2:23:29] the Lord for three years because there
[2:23:33] was some bride that refused to follow
[2:23:35] the doctrine of Jeroboam and Jeroboam
[2:23:41] said we don't need the flat fold
[2:23:43] ministry anyway we would just raise up
[2:23:45] men that aren't caught of God the men of
[2:23:48] low nature there interpret the word for
[2:23:51] me spirits don't die so even though
[2:24:00] Jeroboam was raising up false gods there
[2:24:03] was a revival amongst the Levi just said
[2:24:05] I'll not stand for this I'll make my
[2:24:08] stand in this evil hour to stay with
[2:24:11] what God has already brought I choose to
[2:24:15] stay with the original word I told our
[2:24:22] church back home listen you don't have
[2:24:23] to be afraid you don't have to sit here
[2:24:25] and wonder am i in the truth or not or
[2:24:27] do I believe the right doctor or not if
[2:24:29] you got the Holy Ghost he promised to
[2:24:31] lead you and to guide you into all truth
[2:24:33] we don't have to say hold god oh god if
[2:24:36] i don't believe it that way no no no
[2:24:37] just get right in the middle of the
[2:24:39] stream God will bring his revelation
[2:24:41] right in you'll be able to stand and
[2:24:43] discern between right and wrong
[2:24:45] [Applause]
[2:24:47] my eye is not upon my friends to see if
[2:24:50] I'm in the truth my eyes upon him am i
[2:24:53] and the truth
[2:24:54] [Applause]
[2:25:00] you will Levite yuan the priests of the
[2:25:04] Lord he's made you kings and priests
[2:25:06] into Claude has a king right now I roll
[2:25:09] over a kingdom that's a spiritual
[2:25:11] Kingdom I roll over sin I roll over
[2:25:14] flesh I rule over the world and I roll
[2:25:17] over the devil the devil is under my
[2:25:19] feet the devil is under my reign he has
[2:25:21] to listen to my word because I got the
[2:25:24] supreme authority that comes from dog
[2:25:28] and I'm also a priest that brings
[2:25:30] spiritual sacrifice of praise that's
[2:25:33] what I'm doing this morning bringing a
[2:25:35] praise unto my god but cleanness says I
[2:25:38] believe in stay with you notice as soon
[2:25:48] as soon as Jeroboam builds this altar
[2:25:53] his child goes sick and will die he
[2:26:03] introduced sickness into his home whole
[2:26:08] this I'm not doing it oh you mean if I
[2:26:09] get sick I'm on the run on it's not what
[2:26:11] I mean
[2:26:11] you understand what's going on God had
[2:26:13] said I'll make your house sure but as
[2:26:16] soon as he put up an altar his son dies
[2:26:18] Oh God give us discernment let's lead on
[2:26:31] something here just a man I got 13
[2:26:33] minutes
[2:26:38] he put up calves and said these are your
[2:26:42] God's ain't that great we got something
[2:26:44] new didn't you realize there was once a
[2:26:48] true priest by the name of Aaron that
[2:26:51] had made it God supernaturally of course
[2:26:53] it's all supernatural because when Moses
[2:26:56] gave him the questionnaire why did this
[2:26:58] happen he said you know they gave me
[2:27:00] their their jewels and stuff and I threw
[2:27:02] it in the fire and out it comes into
[2:27:03] something that all these false doctrines
[2:27:04] start supernaturally I was in the sea
[2:27:10] and I saw the angel of the Lord I was
[2:27:12] here and I saw God I had a dream I had
[2:27:14] this and I don't care about one of them
[2:27:19] all brother branham I had a dream that
[2:27:21] I'm gonna go with this woman overseas
[2:27:22] and you know she's been married five
[2:27:24] times but I'm over there he's got a
[2:27:25] brother man said you're gonna ruin your
[2:27:26] ministry all but she had a dream and I
[2:27:28] had a dream and it was of God he said
[2:27:30] your dream was mighty sweet but it's not
[2:27:31] the word I don't care how supernatural
[2:27:33] you say it is if it's not the word it's
[2:27:36] not the word I don't care if you had a
[2:27:37] dream I don't care if you had a vision I
[2:27:39] don't care if you had an angel tap you
[2:27:41] on the shoulder Paul said if an angel
[2:27:43] from heaven comes and says anything
[2:27:45] different than what has already been a
[2:27:46] preacher
[2:27:50] you're not qualified to change the times
[2:27:53] you're not qualified to change the
[2:27:56] worship what did Jeroboam do when he
[2:28:07] puts up these these uh these gods
[2:28:10] he changed the approach to God and he
[2:28:14] changed God's present office work what
[2:28:19] was the present office work of God at
[2:28:21] that time it was right there at the
[2:28:23] Temple in Jerusalem it was the blood of
[2:28:25] the lambs being put upon the altar and
[2:28:29] he offered him a religion without the
[2:28:34] blood he changed God's present office
[2:28:41] work you know man he'll come in today
[2:28:45] and make their doctrine so important
[2:28:46] that if you don't believe it you missed
[2:28:49] it and they changed God's present office
[2:28:53] work even so much so that they say
[2:28:56] there's the mercy seat the Mercy's over
[2:28:59] I'll tell you how can mercy be over as
[2:29:03] long as the devil is here brother Ram
[2:29:06] says when the bride goes up that's when
[2:29:08] Satan comes down he said Satan right now
[2:29:10] the Devils are contaminating the
[2:29:12] atmospheres around us and accusing us
[2:29:14] before God future home he said but
[2:29:16] there's a blood come on church don't
[2:29:20] change God's office work and as long as
[2:29:22] there's one seed that has not come the
[2:29:24] life there must be Amen a kinsman
[2:29:26] redeemer
[2:29:27] [Applause]
[2:29:31] but what does Jeroboam do changes it
[2:29:37] even changes the feast day the Feast of
[2:29:41] the Tabernacles the seventh day which
[2:29:43] brother branham's said in future home
[2:29:44] that's the time we're in right now we
[2:29:46] were worshipping under the Feast of the
[2:29:48] Tabernacles and in the Millennium would
[2:29:51] be in the Feast of the Tabernacles again
[2:29:53] what he said but what was the Feast of
[2:29:55] Tabernacles as the end gathering and he
[2:29:58] said in that time you have to be joyful
[2:30:00] and then God commanded through Moses
[2:30:02] said and when you come don't come empty
[2:30:04] let me tell you when I came here this
[2:30:06] morning I came full up and I came toys
[2:30:09] fall and I came worshiping in the right
[2:30:11] hour let me tell you when you come God's
[2:30:13] Way God will speak back to you I'm
[2:30:17] worshiping in the time of his feast not
[2:30:19] yours brother BAM said the church age
[2:30:26] book he said they sing the song of Moses
[2:30:28] the servant of God the song of the lamb
[2:30:30] saying great and marvellous so that
[2:30:32] works Lord God Almighty just and true
[2:30:34] are thy ways thou king of saints do you
[2:30:36] see it the lamb the high priests holding
[2:30:39] his blood as an atonement on the mercy
[2:30:41] seat for our sins is the Lord God
[2:30:43] Almighty that is his present office that
[2:30:46] is what he's doing now pleading his
[2:30:48] blood for our sin Deborah today I'm the
[2:30:54] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and how
[2:30:57] are you by him
[2:31:06] don't make the word make you proud hey
[2:31:12] man so what what was Jeroboam doing he
[2:31:15] was taking mercy away from Israel and
[2:31:20] given him a golden calf and an altar
[2:31:23] which incidentally and that altar there
[2:31:25] were still supernatural works even
[2:31:29] though his withered hand was healed at
[2:31:31] his altar come on but it was an altar he
[2:31:38] built not God so he took away mercy from
[2:31:47] Israel and he put up his own golden
[2:31:49] calves and they're coming worshiping and
[2:31:52] they think they have new revelation and
[2:31:54] they're only believing what has been all
[2:31:57] the way back since Genesis since the
[2:32:02] Garden of Eden the same spirit the trail
[2:32:05] of the serpent came on down hit Eve hit
[2:32:10] him at Mount Sinai when since identity
[2:32:12] brother Branham compared Mount Sinai to
[2:32:13] the giving of the seals the ten
[2:32:15] commandments he said is in type the
[2:32:17] giving of the seals and what was
[2:32:19] happening when the seals were being
[2:32:20] given at the bottom man was making his
[2:32:22] own idol and that spirit left Sinai and
[2:32:27] traveled on down to the land of promise
[2:32:29] and waited for his opportunity for a
[2:32:34] person who would compromise but there
[2:32:40] are some Levites and see what he's doing
[2:32:43] and they said Jeroboam I don't believe
[2:32:46] the way you believe your power is
[2:32:50] corrupt your power satanic your power is
[2:32:55] introducing into Israel a man and
[2:32:57] idolatry that will blot their names out
[2:33:00] from under heaven listen we often talk
[2:33:07] my trust this is alright this morning we
[2:33:09] often talk about we've returned to
[2:33:11] Pentecost the original Pentecost is
[2:33:14] nothing
[2:33:16] what people think Pentecost is people
[2:33:22] often compare Pentacles to what happened
[2:33:24] on Azusa Street that's not Pentecost
[2:33:26] that's what they called Pentecost
[2:33:28] brother Bram said they thought it was
[2:33:30] the long-awaited restoration but it was
[2:33:32] not because there wasn't a prophet there
[2:33:34] amen they had gifts but there wasn't a
[2:33:37] prophet there but when the Prophet came
[2:33:38] then the long-awaited restoration could
[2:33:40] come and when the restoration of the
[2:33:42] word came that came the restoration of
[2:33:43] the power and brother Branham said that
[2:33:46] original outpouring of Pentecost which
[2:33:49] outpouring Kerr came direct from Jesus
[2:33:51] on the mercy seat is in doing his church
[2:33:54] through all the seven ages and showing
[2:33:56] forth perfectly Jesus Christ is the same
[2:33:59] yesterday today and forever
[2:34:02] say brother Denny I'm not in the seven
[2:34:04] ages anymore but where are those lost
[2:34:06] ones act help me you're in time whether
[2:34:14] you like it or not you brother Jack I'm
[2:34:18] closing not just pick it up but I want
[2:34:20] to tell you something I know what it's
[2:34:22] like I'm not preaching something I don't
[2:34:24] know I know what it's like for for my
[2:34:26] own family to come up to me said hey you
[2:34:28] know where the rapture is over you know
[2:34:32] we're in the Millennium hey since we're
[2:34:34] in the Millennium we don't need fivefold
[2:34:35] ministry anymore we don't need you
[2:34:38] we're already in the Millennium I'll
[2:34:42] tell you where their lives ended up amen
[2:34:45] it ended up their children came up in
[2:34:47] divorces in the world or following a man
[2:34:55] in false doctrine none of them stand
[2:34:59] today as a record of righteousness
[2:35:04] none of them and I say this I just open
[2:35:07] up my life all of my uncles that believe
[2:35:10] the message all of them followed false
[2:35:14] doctrine all of them and that false
[2:35:17] doctrine will always look down upon
[2:35:19] somebody trying to stand for truth and
[2:35:21] point a finger of accusation and try to
[2:35:23] tell you where you're wrong and that you
[2:35:25] don't have the Holy Ghost and you don't
[2:35:27] know what you're talking about
[2:35:28] tell you I saw them I saw them gather
[2:35:31] around my daddy when he was pastoring
[2:35:32] and they pinned him in the kitchen and
[2:35:34] they begin to tell him you don't have
[2:35:36] the Holy Ghost this is your problem this
[2:35:37] is my and I say this to our shame
[2:35:39] brother BAM says we have a family tree
[2:35:41] he said I got to say the bad parts I
[2:35:43] don't say the good parts and I love them
[2:35:44] has nothing to do with love right here
[2:35:46] I'm just telling you to help you they
[2:35:48] stood around on my grandfather and my
[2:35:49] three uncles and they all accused him of
[2:35:51] not having the Holy Ghost my mom had a
[2:35:53] mental collapse right there had to be
[2:35:54] physically carried out of the kitchen
[2:35:56] and they set there and my dad just in
[2:35:58] his own house it kept his head down and
[2:36:00] then he finally looked and says you know
[2:36:01] this is my house I don't have to stand
[2:36:03] for this and he stood up to walk out and
[2:36:05] they physically threw him back and when
[2:36:08] they did that the whole atmosphere
[2:36:10] change because where the word of a king
[2:36:11] is there's power my dad walked right up
[2:36:15] to him now listen I'm not saying this to
[2:36:17] you but stand up you're almost tall
[2:36:18] enough to be in the NBA but you're not
[2:36:22] this is not nose to nose this is nose to
[2:36:25] chest hey man but he put his nose right
[2:36:27] up at him and looked at him as calm as
[2:36:29] I'm looking at you says Satan get behind
[2:36:31] me and when he said that the whole thing
[2:36:35] broke who had the power this doctrine or
[2:36:42] the Holy Spirit that tell a man I don't
[2:36:45] have to have this in my home anymore it
[2:36:47] broke the spirit of the whole thing
[2:36:49] I watched him deflate go right down they
[2:36:52] all walked out of the house and
[2:36:53] eventually came back and repented Hey
[2:36:58] you may look simple but stay with the
[2:37:00] word
[2:37:02] honor his word
[2:37:04] [Applause]
[2:37:10] we may have a Jeroboam that tries to
[2:37:13] present his own gods and present his own
[2:37:15] quote to presented his own way I'm not
[2:37:17] interested in that I want the life of
[2:37:19] God came off the mercy seat can I say it
[2:37:25] brother
[2:37:26] just one more testimony hey man I feel
[2:37:29] like Timothy this morning who Paul
[2:37:31] taught he said hi he said that the same
[2:37:33] faith is in you and your grandmother
[2:37:34] isn't as in your mother
[2:37:36] and I'll tell you my grandmother begin
[2:37:37] to believe the message when brother
[2:37:38] Branham was on earth and she begin to
[2:37:40] follow him she worked for build down and
[2:37:42] managed to begin to follow him and go
[2:37:44] down to the meetings and so forth she
[2:37:46] was a little Mennonite woman but she was
[2:37:48] converted under brother branham's
[2:37:49] ministry she began to witness to my
[2:37:51] mother my mother begin to go down and
[2:37:52] then my dad who was just a
[2:37:54] denominational man who didn't even serve
[2:37:56] God welfare but he got all stirred up
[2:37:58] when he tried to persecute 1964 my
[2:38:03] grandmother asked brother Branham you
[2:38:04] can read it in the in the book because
[2:38:06] she says brother Branham said I have two
[2:38:09] daughters married amenity nominations
[2:38:10] they have received persecution what
[2:38:13] should they do brother Branham says hold
[2:38:16] fast show your colors in other words
[2:38:25] stand on the words when you got honest
[2:38:27] and then stand there for you want to
[2:38:31] revival stay with the word
[2:38:36] said show your colors in other words
[2:38:38] even though it's going to get hard and
[2:38:40] pressed you never came in compromised
[2:38:43] with what you believe she says now I
[2:38:49] don't tell you not to go around and
[2:38:51] fellowship with them he said but I tell
[2:38:53] you this when it comes to changing your
[2:38:55] diet a dove cannot eat with a buzzer so

[2:41:26] one day she's working in the phone rings
[2:41:29] up there in Ohio a man in Mandan and
[2:41:31] sister Gladys got a real strange look on
[2:41:33] her face she says said sister Edna's
[2:41:36] brother branham and he's asking for you
[2:41:37] so she picks up the phone and brother
[2:41:39] Brahim says hello sister Edna said I
[2:41:41] just wanted to call you to wish you
[2:41:43] happy birthday I want to ask you a
[2:41:44] question
[2:41:45] who told him it was her birthday I tell
[2:41:48] you this is how I believe God told him
[2:41:50] because he knew there would be a church
[2:41:52] over here and he needed somebody
[2:41:53] encourage that woman called my mother
[2:41:55] because the one that was going to preach
[2:41:57] the gospel wanting a believer yet and
[2:41:59] was persecuted somebody had to stand so
[2:42:02] somebody could be quickened
[2:42:05] you think you standing is in vain it's
[2:42:07] not in vain there's another generation
[2:42:10] watching you stand and their lives will
[2:42:13] be quickened by the same Holy Ghost
[2:42:15] quick and you left quicken down that
[2:42:18] should be the name
[2:42:20] I can remember holding on to my mother's
[2:42:27] skirts and crying it's my dad screaming
[2:42:29] at her and going off but I can also
[2:42:34] remember Haman that day that image she
[2:42:38] told my my daddy said I want to go to
[2:42:40] that baptism he said I'll tell you
[2:42:42] whatever you go when you get back I'm
[2:42:44] gone and the children's gone this is it
[2:42:47] my mom looked at him and she didn't know
[2:42:51] what to do and then something rose up
[2:42:52] and says I'm gonna go right there she
[2:42:55] made a choice I'll follow God more than
[2:42:56] the word excuse me I'll follow God more
[2:43:00] than my family oh now the pressure is on
[2:43:06] now the pressure is on lose your family
[2:43:09] what you going to do my mother just told
[2:43:13] me the other day again what it was like
[2:43:14] she goes it wasn't a process it was
[2:43:17] immediately said my said my daddy was an
[2:43:21] arrogant man hard the people of the
[2:43:23] church were scared of him he would
[2:43:25] interrupt the services he'd have house
[2:43:26] service he'd go outside rev the engine
[2:43:28] squeal the tires call on the phone
[2:43:30] interrupt the services do whatever he
[2:43:32] could in Florida when he moved down here
[2:43:35] he'd go around the town telling the
[2:43:37] church telling the Mennonite people said
[2:43:38] my wife's in a cult they believe it
[2:43:40] there's a snake in the garden and
[2:43:42] adultery and all that kind of he said
[2:43:44] she's in the cult he did everything he
[2:43:48] could to disrupt the influence but she
[2:43:51] held fast showed her colors and kept
[2:43:54] feeding on the word it's mom mom told me
[2:43:59] it was just two days ago told me it was
[2:44:01] instantaneous said I'm standing there
[2:44:04] and I've made my stand brother branham
[2:44:06] has already said 1964 hold faster
[2:44:09] because 10 years later my daddy turned
[2:44:13] and he started to cry said there's
[2:44:15] crocodile tears said I really didn't
[2:44:16] want to lose my family but I didn't know
[2:44:18] what to do and is in that moment God
[2:44:20] dropped down and he turned around and
[2:44:22] looked at my mind said I'll take you and
[2:44:24] a week later he was baptized my mom said
[2:44:27] it was instantaneous he went from being
[2:44:29] a
[2:44:29] get man to somebody just like this you
[2:44:35] want to tell me that a birth is a
[2:44:37] process let me tell you a mean the
[2:44:39] processes God works on you to get you to
[2:44:42] that point that you can be changed I'm
[2:44:44] telling you but when God calms and when
[2:44:46] God meet you you can never ever be the
[2:44:50] same again
[2:44:50] [Applause]
[2:44:56] hallelujah my god is Abraham's God when
[2:45:02] there's nowhere else to turn he still
[2:45:04] provides around
[2:45:05] [Applause]

[2:45:12] taking me the Mennonite Church and
[2:45:14] telling us as kids don't believe what
[2:45:16] your mother believes you say brother
