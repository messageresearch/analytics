today [Music] so good to see you my house to the Lord today my a man raised alone let's give another hand of blaze [Music] and just real quickly I was mentioning on on Wednesday night there's a number of things that are happening here in the next few weeks we'll be having some guest ministers passed through brother Ginga bone will be coming through brother smiley also be coming through amended Minister forest and we're going to be looking forward to that it's a little traveling that I have I have a wedding that I need attending for a cousin of mine and and then there's a meeting in Ohio that I'll be administering and and also a meeting and Tucson that I'll be ministering at but also I just want to let the church know there's an opportunity for us to go to Tucson in November in November that gets the holiday weekend there November a Veterans Day and if there's anyone interested in attending please let me know and we'll see what we can do and as far as getting something together to be November Veterans Day weekend keep that in mind and then thank you musicians appreciate you all amen god bless you and certainly want to thank the Lord for all the specials that went forth here today certainly enjoyed them amen and just appreciate all that God is doing in our myths man he is a mighty docked a man a mighty God thank God for a Friday night my precious brother Thomas did a wonderful job here just speak into our hearts just so many things that he shared just kind of come back confirming a lot that we had already been talking about and I thought the church was about the rapture when he said you're going over you know with Christ I say oh you don't heard that before but we just we just appreciate the Lord Jesus a man and I'm just speaking to us we know we and a Holy Ghost Church a man we were ever Holy Ghost church because when God speaks and you know to minister don't know nothing man coming all the way from Ghana you know God is in control a man and he's done speaking to his people so we just we just thank God for that and this morning a man those thought that I have in my heart you all just turn with me to Romans 8 I know that I feel God doing something and then I feel I feel God doing something and and I'm trusting a man that he'll complete what he started a man I'm believing him to do that and and a trust at the thought that he's given me today would be something that will kind of connect with what's already been going on in this place a man on today so I want to read here from Romans 8 a man and I'm starting at verse 14 it reads as follows it says for as many are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and and this is desperate best a critical part you know we were hearing that on Friday night if you're going through a trial Amen that's a good thing right because God is using that in order to bring something greater a man out of it you know everything that we read in Scripture all the stories that encourage us we hear about God opening the Red Sea we hear about God shutting the mouths of lions right we read about God a quench in the fire and a fiery furnace and a number of other great things that happen in Scripture but you realize amen and I think even better Kayla was talking about Joseph you realized in order for us to read those stories somebody had to go through a trial you understand that right that one three somebody had to go through something right and not only just don't you didn't have to overcome right so so if if you're going through something God has given you something so you can overcome and unless you overcome you can't you know yeah let me say like there's no case all right no no testimony so if the scripture tells us for I I'm sorry if kill drew then heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we do what suffer with him now in the midst of what you're going through he left you sometimes we leave him but he never leave us so the mister whatever you go through it's a say if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and this is the verse that I'm really drawing attention to today if we can for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us there's gonna be some glory revealed in you a man is gonna be some glory but is gonna come through some suffering all right let's pray thank you God for the ability to read the Word of God today and we trust that the Holy Spirit will take control over with folks I am Lord of a aware that your spirit is here your presence is here your loyalty is here and when your Mountain comes got what we're asking that the mountain would destroy not just break it destroy destroy the yoke of the enemy that might be in the lives of your people and if somebody has come in this place this morning a man satisfied with their condition not looking for their a yoke to be destroyed we accent that you destroyed anyway and father that you would get all the glory that you get all the honor and all the praise from everything that happens in this place thank you for your your presence being here it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated the Lord a man I want to just use for our title today the glory shall come again a man the glory shall come again and just the title of that magnitude is is really prophecy right I love and and we are under expectation for God to do some things and you know and even even when I when I when I when I use the words of the glory shall come again you have sister verse a old glory now now now now now now understand something I we use the same word globally but it had to differ meanings right a man is so so so so when we when we when we when we when we when we say things like oh glory right then we would bring an honor in an adoration and praise to the king of kings and to the lord of lords and i'mma tell you something if if God has done anything for you then you ought to come to church not just to be seen you are to come to church to bring God I don't care you got it in your pocket in your place the chair the house and glory that you can bring to God because he's been a to do to you do you not to give him food but we're going to try to work through this amen if we can the day because you know when I say the glory shall come again I'm actually talking about something else amen and and and and and in a short a man if I could just kind of condense it down I'm talking about a man God's glory on his people right I'm not just honest people but God's glory in his people do you know that the life that you choose to live everything there's a life that can actually bring glory to go right if sometimes you go through things are like where you choose not to live the way you supposed to live and that like actually dishonest [Applause] [Applause] you oh god glory hallelujah some of y'all forgot about the accident that she was in you forgot that you went back into the church with your tooth it's still got air your arm that like like we used to say in the old days the activity I got the activity of mylanta sis God gave me two hands game is beat so I can shoot gave me hair so I can clap and again your voice so I can reason see that he he he deserves we sang it we sang the song all the time he deserves the glory and the honor Lord I lift my hands in worship as I bless your Holy Name and i'mma tell you when God has done it personally for you then you're not looking at your neighbors you're not concerned by what they think actually you might pass them a note when they're looking at your money and on the notice that you didn't do this you didn't do this so sincerely imperious you don't get and then they tell you something else - better than - Aviva so since the devil didn't do with the devil don't get no glory we bring it all the dogs hallelujah they're with me here Amen this morning but the glory shall come again we were in our church age book and I was telling the Sunday School class there was something that struck me in my reading a man on this match and it was actually the very last sentence of what we were reading and I just want to read that to the church if I can and what once once I read it I got I got I got it's a channel and I got into a mode where I couldn't even get out I ain't know where to get started and I don't even know where to stop so when I got in there my lord I don't know what I'm doing this morning but I do notice I just want to talk about your glory amen and then talking about your glory I want to give you glory this quote says this and ephesian church eh it says repent quickly now now this is this is this is the this is the way to get back to the glory can I just lower it there for a second I gotta I gotta say something you know they use these words you can take it off the screen there cuz they gotta think on think they gonna be reading that and not listening to me so amen they use these words anybody anybody here ever experience what we call glory days and see when you've experienced glory days that's actually your best things if some of us have had amen glory days in God where we remember where we used to be we remember the fasting we remember the plane right we remember you know seeing God answer certain things when will we be as certain things they we remember to God we remember the joy we had when we came to church huh we remember not what the mr. Church suits hello somebody we remember when we used to go to prayer meeting we remember a man when we used to go to Sunday School heading cost' places we remember that we couldn't wait to get back Coleman and get our coins together to hell to the next meeting that is so good on the inside that was pushing us we didn't need my body temperatures because we had it on the inside we the only things when you first receive the Holy Ghost and then the piece that you had the only things but somehow someway something got lost but I'm here to prophesy over you the glory shall come again and then what I'm saying that if you can just take a little journey down memory lane for your own self and you can remember what your glory days was like you know I mean if I could just you know go to church or something natural so you know I'm getting close I'm getting closer I'm getting closer to a big number and as I get closer to that number with all these birthdays that I've got a half a man my mind think a man about my former days I when I used to play basketball it was my glory days hey man I remember I remember the first time I dumped the basketball I I say oh I feel pretty good amen but now I can barely get to the bottom of the nets right and they're like them days the lesson but every once in a while when my mind go to reflecting back and I found a little Bowl I get it in my hand come on somebody don't don't go look at me like I'm strings right but I get a little ball overhand him and my mind going back to the glory days and I think I still got it and because they tell you that you get you actually believe waving them and before that with the ball in your hand you know you just bounce it a little bit you know water between your leg and read about yourself and then you're looking for somebody to give you a game and you get in there without you Cairo like you used to know but I'm so glad we were talking about we're gonna talk about some nature but they all miss Beatrice I don't even remember when you used to be Harley the reason somebody else been in here today is because the glow has come we travel when the babies that you never make it back but you stand in here and by the custom blow man the Gloria has come again they use the second song waves of glory flora threatened over my soul we just want waves of glory waves wave after wave after wave of glory hallelujah let me read this so if you want to get back to the glory days in God but the Bible something that the Prophet says this repent quickly don't don't don't delay if if God is speaking to you through this sermon that they repent quickly right and he says it ever they say don't hesitate hallelujah don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did hesitate it says for her lifespan was not very low the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly now now now I must stop there because you know there was a time in scripture right when we see and I'm gonna come back to the quote in a second but some of the the glory of God that creep decreased ever so rapidly but there was a time in scripture where the children of Israel got themselves in a little trouble all kind of stuff was happening in the house of God a man we had two leaders in the house these were the the preachers children hallelujah because you know sometimes preacher preacher kids or a man those that are close to the preacher sometimes take advantage of their status huh amen you know they so close and they know certain things that they can get away with so they take advantage of their status and hear an amen in the days of Eli his two boys and then we're doing things inside the house of God they were stealing money from from the offering a man and and not only that they forget that here I came came to him and said that now I understand that you land a member some of the women of the church how these piece my to preach the sons amen they they were doing things like this and and because of the sin that had had happening in inside the church that God told you I say you could have done more profit I know you talked to him about it but maybe you should have sat him down because if you're sometimes you don't sit people down then they don't understand amen the implications of what they're doing huh you know sometimes so what we don't want to embarrass the people that no no no we got a rebuke still openly so let's continue right so so when things get out of hand now you're gonna have to sit down huh the reason and I'm gonna tell you the reason that we gonna ask you to sit down because we want to protect the globe because you did not protect to do with Eli alone disposed to do whatever doing the Bombers a counter little battle and when they get in the beverage bar to go and the Bible say Amen if your bar was written there it go Bob with the blowing of a laughter pardon but there come a time I believe was in Davis day that that that glory came again and went when that the same and that art that was taken a man one day David start coming back into the cake and when David saw that lonely returning day that they came to the choice David began to worship David David Gaucho's always his won't say I can't believe the king because I hear dancing the team follows how embarrassing that is they to say if yesterday he really is returning should he left in place I say the glorious coming again let's read on it's not long until the city was in ruins its glorious temple became a shapeless mass the land became a marsh inhabited by waterfowl the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid village there was not even one Christian left this is talking about the city of Ephesus the lamp was ripped from its place now it does not mean that she could not have repented right it does not mean that we cannot repent see but when you're done when you're going to repent do it quickly don't hesitate because the devil don't get you the kind of well it wasn't all that it no no it was all that and more you need to repent right if you want the glory to come back you got to repent right it says it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it but it must be quickly and I like this part it must be a true heart because some people say sorry just because they got called right a man but but but if you really really a man repetitive of what you've done then you've a look at the go get involved in the same thing again hallelujah what you have not received the spirit of bondage again on to fear don't go back and get involved in the same thing again and God delivered you from smoking don't go back to smoke again if God deliver you some trinket don't go back in from some relationship [Applause] don't wink on television forget the address hello somebody how about I'm going the witness no you give you give somebody else the information and if it's a brother no you don't have problem with a sister don't give the number to some other brother if they really want that give it to a sister call this sister here I'm done alright and number I'm told that I'm concentrating on God amen all right we want the glory so you're seeing can actually disrupt the glory hallelujah then that's typically what happens seeing stops the glory amen let me go a little further he says but it must be quickly it must be a true heart crying to God and self a true heart cry to God in sorrow Holly Lewis sometimes people are really ain't sorry and then I'll true heart proud of God in song then God will restore the violent scene people get restored and then go right back to the same thing Nate laughs we don't want to see that number we talk about the glory we're coming again hallelujah and we don't want to just shout for one or two weeks we want to take this thing to the rapture hello somebody oh my god there's a lot I can say there hey man we talked about going to the ratchet I'm not I'm not hey man I'm not moved by emotions I understand you know I understand to be real because if it's real we gotta worry about it no more I understand we ain't gotta worry about you limo when that thing is real we gotta worry about it no more hey man Gloria got your actions changed when it's real they make your thoughts changed when it's real hey man the things you do change when it's real hallelujah amen we want to get a church past struggling we want to get a church to the level of overcoming all right let me go a little further if they say say say but it must be quickly say it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to God and so then and then God will restore the glory shall come again I saw that and I say Lord Jesus well what a blessing you know just to just kind of read that and and I just began to think about that word glory a man because glory has various meanings glory is attributed to God for his greatness when we come and say old Gloria or give God the glory amen weird riveting greatness to God right a man we were blessing him for his mighty acts and man we're blessing him and praising him for his his sacrifice on the cross but giving us his son Jesus we we bring blue we bring honor to God nobody could do that but God amen that's why he alone deserves the glory right amen but also when you're when you use the word glory a man is declaring Amen his grandeur a man or the excellency of his work a man his grandeur or the excellency of God's working in our Psalm 19:1 the Bible says the heavens declare the glory of God amen and the firmament showeth his handiwork now now you can if you just read it heavens you find so many things that not only only God could create a universe like not like the one we live in amen how does the Sun stay in place only God could do that hey Hannes amen you know when you look at all we've all watches and all this but you know I don't care how good the watch is that you burn how much money you spend on it if it's that that watch will use time and then but when it came to the the Sun and the moon we can still predict things on this earth because of the consistency of our God or he has done in the heavens oh yeah hey Ben Ben hey if you get a play in that same they think they're atheists they don't believe that have them explain to you how what is this son and what is just knew how these things do this sue the heavens declare the glory of God hallelujah and and the firmament showeth his handiwork I like this you know but but you know we look at something here that I just want to just kind of bring in if I can the heavens declare score but we got we got some other definitions that we want to bring in there's a statement that people make and and I want to be honest with you the prophet has made it and I'm let me read it let me read it let me read I got a watch how I say this though because it's gonna it me I don't want it to backfire hey man this is either greater than Solomon is here let me let me go there the statement that is me is that God won't share his glory with no man we all know that's not in the Bible and let me give you another one the race is not given to the Swift neither is the battle to the strong but to him that endureth to the end and we've heard that in church all our life but that's multiple scriptures put together but the Bible didn't say that all right can I give you another one you shape it in sin borne and iniquity coming to the world speaking lies that's multiple scriptures we're together but the Bible doesn't say it the way I just said it and sometimes we've taken things because we've heard people say it but we didn't really get the context of what was being said so so when we when we hear people saying God and gonna share his glory with no man we miss in the context of really what's being saying can I tell you where that Scripture was birthed from isaiah 42:8 that's where it's birthed from that when you go back to you read Isaiah 42 you'll see it and you can pull that up Isaiah 42 today when you go back and read that the context of I was at 42 it was talking about Idol gods right and what we understand is that even way back in the book of Exodus God saying you have no other gods before him and sometimes man by himself trying to make himself a god now when I talk about being co-equal God you can only reach that status through the blue cheese look at this I see wouldn't you know when I talk about the glory coming again I got to give you all this context this is what the Bible say I'm the Lord that is my name and my glory will I not will I not give to another neither my praise to graven images so the context is talking about the grievant images but it's not talking about who you are Oh hallelujah is can we read some more out of Isaiah amen since I'm over there and I'm gonna just kind of show you something amen because go to Isaiah I think it's gonna be our chapter 60 oh yes a man hallelujah no he ain't gon share his glory with no one and and and and when I what he's talking about is idol worship and the other things like I said sometimes man can lift themselves up and they become idols guarding or share his glory with that I've know of a situation where you know a preacher took the the cloud the cloud you know that that came down in 1963 and brought and science had no idea what the cloud represented so brother Branham saying look that cloud just turn it to the right and when they turn the cloud to the right you know they saw the face of Christ so people actually start superimposing the cloud and putting the face of Christ oh people can actually see it it's right when brother took the face of Christ out and now he didn't do it may allow somebody to do it he allowed somebody to put his face in there and the sons face no god I don't share his glory with no man not like that this is everything we got is because of Christ hallelujah church it's all about Christ and and and when we talk about being co-equal we talk about being adopted son we talk about all these things all of that happens because of the blood no blood none of that's gonna happen to you none right so don't get don't get that twisted now let's look at this and I was there six days since we since be there verse one a Russ son for that light is come and what the glory of the Lord is risen upon who a man risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee hallelujah and and and and his glory shall be seen upon thee oh my God my God my God if this is a promise from God then we ought to be expecting this oh yeah it is blown we gonna be seen upon me then I want to walk in it I want to live it manna I want to worship Him that glory I want his grandeur his excellence to be seen upon me Oh stay with me here stay with me here right so so you know we look at we look at a couple things here oh my god so you know let me let me I'm ready to kind of run into something but I gotta slow down and I gotta slow down y'all just bear with me here we look at this word glory it has multiple multiple definitions multiple definitions so so when we talk about a man we just read in Scripture God's glory is gonna rest on his people it's gonna wrestle his people now now you don't have to believe it but I just read it and when it when he said his glory gonna rest upon thee I just put my name there his glory gonna rest upon jack Duff hallelujah because that's really where Isaiah is writing to me right and you got to see yourself in the scripture right here is glory hallelujah I mean when you remember your glory days and man his glory is going to rest again on you hallelujah normal talking about fact let me just read another scripture for you glory to God say ma'am eight men I got I got a lot of them here proper of 17-6 proverbs 17 6 thank you Jesus all right bear with me today the glory shall come again Solomon has these words of wisdom that he gives us in this this particular portion of Scripture and it says children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers so that means the children can have some glory but notice Solomon say he say the glory of the children so so so whatever they may whatever you achieve as as a child whatever status you make it to the glory goes back to your daddy the glory always goes back to the data and another Lynette amen if a child does not make anything of himself you know where's the supper the reproach your father has a simple reproach because it's his responsibility to create an atmosphere to create an environment so that when the child grows up they can shine with glory can we go a little further can we just go a little further if children's children not a crown of old men and the glory of the children are their father's then whatever you do brings glory to your father I was just taking on this on this on this passage Scripture because I thought about the prodigal son and as the prodigal son left his father's house and went out and did all the stuff that he thought he was big and bad enough to do now you know when the prodigal son was out there his daddy there sent him no text messages hello somebody can I just talk to out a little bit why he out there doing what he want to do say i'ma tell you why his dad in Central Texas daddy knew where he had deposited Oh y'all are y'all in Whitley is that it knew what was in the boy and if sometimes what happens is that life has to present circumstances life has to present situations for what's inside the boy to come out the boy right and after that boy thought himself in a dire situation where he like I mean officially walk out where he was ballin had a fat wallet right things were thick it was soft thick he was bragging about a little bit too much that his boys got a homeless or his money and some of the girls got a hold of some of his money but but when he realized that they were only taking advantage of them and when they left him bunk and did have nothing to give him when he was barreling out huh very fellowship working in a place that he as a as a Jew should have never been working his but it got so bad at one they weren't there that he was working there what that really bad is that he wanted to eat he desired to eat what the peach was eaten you know things got there but the Bible says that he came to himself and see what he came to himself the glory what's coming again is some people talk today stuff they say it's better in my daddy's house if I was just to serve it I ain't gotta be the same I don't need I don't need no position I don't need no title but I just want to be here in worship I just want to feel the presence of God right I just I just want to be here because I realized things are much much much worse I hear where I was it was way better inside the father's house and when that boy begin to think like that see you see sometimes you got to start thinking about it and we're gonna think about it then it becomes a reality right that thing become a reality because he made his way back home he said soon as he saw his dad instead of so happy to see him that is so happy to see me say you say you say say daddy I got something to say see he was repenting quickly okay can I say it like this don't just walk up in here like ain't nothing happened repent quickly don't just walk up in here like ain't nothing happen huh right now you you can you come return to the day this house like that right say no no no let's say that it before you go to brother I need to take something that I need to say something what is it sir I'm just so happy that dad I appreciate you here but I got some say daddy son your mama wait and see you got dinner at my daddy I got something I need to say that Adam let I don't nest up your name Allen did this not only did that not only did this and daddy I'm sorry and daddy I just I just figured that as bad as it has been for me it would be better if I came back as a servant because I can really no longer be called your son daddy heard that because it was it was sincere it was real and when Daddy heard that daddy said that's it no no no no no no no no no no no no no no see I hire servants but I give birth I hire Serbs they come a diamond a dozen but but but but III give birth to children and since Ivan gave birth to you I don't care what your condition is you can always be my son so you just said I'll go ahead and kill the fatted calf get the ringer go get a rope I'm gonna put on my robe and tell the story [Music] i'ma put on my robe and imma tell the story how I made it and I'm on it I want you to understand that when you get your robe and when you get your wing everybody and gonna be happy that's your batch everybody ain't gonna be happy that the glory came again huh so don't don't get upset oh let me just leave it so you engage you ain't gave no party like that to me and my friends so y'all don't need a party like that see the jealousy kicked in when the glory returned oh I hope y'all with me the jealousy kicked in when the glory returned and I'm gonna tell you something as the glory come again you got to watch what spirit tries to doesn't want you because I'm telling you right now the glory will come again and I'm gonna tell you i'ma tell you another thing I'm not looking for replacement I believe God for restoration and I don't see the Spirit of Truth have some glory case the glory coming again hallelujah can I go on a little further oh yes yes here in John 1:14 we hear the scripture says the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so when we look at Jesus we actually see God's glory hallelujah and so if Jesus as a son of God was God's glory then you also as a son of God and a daughter of God you are God's glory children's children our crown of old men but the glory the children are their father's whatever you accomplished becomes God's glory understand now if you don't if you don't believe that John 17 and 22 see the Prophet told me that if I tell y'all in Scripture then you got to believe it so John 17 and and 22 says this oh my God my God my God and the glory which thou gave his me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one so Jesus was God's glory but when Jesus came to earth before he left he actually gave the glory to us we are also a part of God's glory hallelujah we're part of his grandeur and even you can go all the way back to the beginning because you know God did not rest until after he created a man in His image that's when God said okay I'm reached it this is this is perfection right here I finally got exactly what I wanted and that was God's glory on display come on somebody let me go a little further amen let me let me also just kind of pull you out of some things here you know I was I read that script out on some I'm sorry Isaiah 60:1 earlier and you know there it was saying arise shine for that glory that's coming I thought about the song that we sing sometime let the glory of the Lord rise among us let the praises of our King arise among us let it rise right let let let let that glory rise on us let it be seen inside of us now let me let me let me also just kind of drop this if I can sisters the Bible declares in first corinthians chapter 11 and verse 15 if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her and see this distance it sprays its dignity that's what that word means praise dignity honor well if a woman has have have little air it was a glory to her for her hair is given her for a cover me now now I want you to you know I want you to just kind of bear with me Amen as we just kind of talked about that just a little bit you know because this word glory has so many different meanings amen I was recently visiting there at our brother brother Donnie Regan and he was talking on that Scripture and he made a statement he preached the sermon he just went oh he went back preach the sermon and they say I'm not going to use quotes tonight i'ma just use historical Amen statements from from biblical writers and things like that what they have to say about that scripture and I everybody was saying that you know Amen when it went a woman don't cut her hair amen and that's what the Bible said because it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair hallelujah clipping is cutting right it's wrong for her to cut her ear because her hair is her glory and he started going back showing how all these different Bible expositors everybody was saying exact thing they say now the prophets say these things that people get upset but the babak's positive say an exact same thing it's wrong it's wrong I want to talk to y'all about three women real quick if I can three these three women one woman was married to a lawyer brother Branham brings us out in the message and knoweth it not this one woman was married to a lawyer but the thing about her she never went to church she had a she she somehow allowed an old boyfriend to visit while her husband was away on business she went to some party and and all she did was give that old boyfriend a hug let me y'all go y'all I'm y'all pulled me out of my element here all she did was just give the old boyfriend a hug and when she when she hugged him it a little fire on the inside of her that she thought had died this is my church brothers can hug brothers because it's not supposed to have them types of things hello you ain't supposed to feel that when you look at another man and when I will assist this hugging another sister she supposed to feel that either if you feel that I think I love him a man sent it to another man something wrong all I did was shake his hand and hug them and you felt what you know that's a devil you know it's a devil don't even entertain it that's why that's why is here we we brothers shake the brothers or you can hug the brother we don't kiss on the neck and we don't kiss in the mouth we don't do none of that I know the Bible say Greek with a holy kiss but that kiss that they did in the Bible is actually on the neck and understand now understand now these people walked on dusty roads amen and walked in the Sun they didn't they didn't have Afghanistan cops so whenever they got to their destination and you kissed them a man with a holy kiss you had to put them lips on the neck with all the sweat and dirt hallelujah we people got to know what the Bible really mean if we had somebody walked through the church one time we just greeting officers they just pecking pecking pecking like brother no no no no no no we don't do that bang what the Bible saying but yeah let me get my thought back now hallelujah these d-street these three three three or so so so what she did she just hugged him and when she hugged him it actually released something on the inside of her and even though she was married even though she married she just began to desire a man that of a man again and it all got triggered from a hug right so so what what happened here is that uh you know a husband will go off the business numbers again don't forget it now this woman is all is uh is a woman that don't go to church right like we heard last night I mean on Friday night sinners just sin that's what they do but but what but what really get things going is when a Christian does something that they're not supposed to do so but I don't say is Christians that fan not sinners hallelujah because seven says do what they do Christians are the one that got to repent alright so so so this woman a man she's married to a lawyer never go to church she allowed this little boyfriend back in now he's visiting her house and you know and she spent a lot of time in the arms of this man and and and and her her neighbor is a matched her neighbor goes to church the neighbor goes to a Methodist Church right if you go back and listen to the message brother Bram say the Methodists were more holy than the Baptist so that's why he used Methodist say the Methodist Church you know this neighbor that goes to church goes to the Methodist Church she's watching all the activities of this lady that don't go to church and she tell my husband that woman is a public prostitute her husband say yeah that's true umbrella Bram say actually the lady was worse than a prostitute because she's doing things like that and she's a merit woman she's worse than a prostitute so he goes on that's the first one we say the second woman is dis Methodist woman now now she she ain't got no man coming to the house when her husband's away but this lady is a lady that likes to wear shorts she likes to cut her hair the Prophet also describes her she says she wears lipstick and she even smokes a little now she don't run out on her husband though cuz he's what we try to do is justify seeing I'm doing this but if you're guilty of least you guilty of all oh yeah so so so he describes this woman she go to church she don't drink but she does wear shorts and she cuts her hair and she wears lipstick and she even smokes a little privacy in God's eyes both of these women are prostitutes the problem is the Methodist woman is ms rule ratchet naked and don't know it and then he says this let me read this part of it for you this is out of the message of north if not this is the third woman I remember I'm talking about how her hair is her glory that's where I'm is what I'm driving here notice this in the message in north of knowledge says now we'll take the Pentecostal woman she don't wear shorts makeup or cut her hair but she looks back down at the Methodist Methodist woman look at that woman do so-and-so say the woman don't wear shorts but you say and and herself with bobbed hair now y'all sisters might have to help me with that one cuz they say she didn't cut her hair but did he say she had bobbed hair and and I just wonder if he was trying to get something to us you know cuz trimming is still cutting brother brother Donnie made this statement he says some of the sisters sometimes they wear their hair so long you know you know everybody just based on your your F ethnic origin God gives us different types of hair and some of the sisters you know some of my sisters might have very very long hair because of ethnic origin and then you get sisters that don't have that long hair desire to have that long hair y'all gonna get me in some trouble here yeah I'm gonna give me a lot of trouble right here but uh they say the sister that's born with that God has blessed her because of her ethnicity she has that long hair like that he says uh he says now she could have hair all the way down her back but if at the bottom he say she does not have long hair according to Scripture and they say he went to Africa and talk to some sister to say they were so disappointed that they hair was not that long he say sister I know your hair is not that long the way that you want want it to be you know with the other sisters say blood sister if you've never taken scissors to your hair you might call it short but God calls it long hair because you'd never put scissors to it God calls it long hair see so what happens that we get so motivated by what we see in other people we got to take this thing back to how God sees it so I don't care how short it is you never put scissors to it God said you got long hair but if you cut it trimming it and let me tell you it go a little further when you do that that is a dishonor to your husband and the Prophet actually said that your husband had the right to divorce you somebody said give me scripture on that the Prophet said nice day the weather Bible see I'm here to answer your question because you got to understand what the Bible's saying here if the woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering hallelujah let's go back to just a verse before that verse 7 in 1st Corinthians 11 and I added the gown I'm gonna give you something out of the Bible amen let's go to 1st Corinthians 11 7 we're talking about this glory see some how many did glory to come again hello you need your glory to come again alright here in verse 7 says for for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as for as much he is the image a man is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man the woman is the glory of man so so so now what happens here according to Paul when a woman cuts the hair she does honors her husband right so now what we got here is that when a woman dis honors her husband her husband has the right to actually put away now brother branham said it this way he can put away but he can't get married again so don't even come talk about my wife could have had I'm ready to divorce that's fine but I bet not and I'm saying like that I'm putting to your turns I bad night see you walking up in here with somebody else you will not be welcome they may you gotta understand the scripture brother Jack where's that the Bible see see see see see the woman is the man's glory can I give you a scripture vashti vashti was a hat services glory and what hosters did he had a big party and they say man I want everybody see the beauty of my wife he said what I wanna do is I want to invite her into the party let everybody get all seated and just enjoy myself then I'm gonna invite her to the party and was she coming like oh look at what that man just meant problem is is that when he invited her she wouldn't come well according to Scripture she dishonored him and you know what happened to Vashti she got divorced and a new king a new queen rose up her name was Esther Esther became a hasser is his glory I wrote a few things about Esther see when we talk about indeed a man for indeed I'm not the ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man see we must consider that we're talking about the church as well because the Prophet taught us that a woman in Scripture represents the church right Vashti was the glory of king of Azeris she was his pride and his joy she couldn't wait I mean he couldn't wait to show the people the beauty of his wife maybe she walked gracefully maybe she dressed in splendor maybe a man she was just a magnificent woman to look upon but she refused to come at the Kings invitation she lacked character let me just show you something this open the door for Esther and when it opened the door for Esther the Bible say that Esther didn't require anything more than what was appointed before she went to the king can I go a little further what I want to say is that Esther damned require makeup Esther them require earrings Esther them require high heels Esther didn't have to show her cleavage Esther them have to walk in there with a miniskirt on short her thighs Esther didn't have to walk with a split in her skirt Esther then even walk with a skirt that showed her knees hello yes it is so nothing if he gonna want me he gonna want me for me this I asked her posted Esther looks so different from all the other ladies that that's what actually drew the Kings attention and when it drew the Kings attention because she refused all these other things the Bible said she obtained favor from the king and then she became the new Queen then when she reached the status of Queen this gave her the opportunity to influence her people was dressing she was a king's glory because the wife is the is the husband's glory and if we can look at ester being a man a half of his glory then we got to look at ourselves as being the glory of God can I go in a little further I got some scriptures here that I want to read to you oh my God my God my God my God maybe I'll just give me there's a statement that brother Branham makes that I don't have time to read all this but you'll find it and the mighty God unveiled before she said since calorie because of Calvary since Calvary we are invited to share his glory oh I thought I thought God don't share his glory with no man since Calvary simps Calvary we are invited to share his glory and as his wife we are his glory I want to just read a few scriptures for you if I can oh my God my God my God this is uh this this is why I oh Lord I haven't left out some things I got to share this moment before I go the first time give it Genesis 31 and 1 because this the first time the word glory was actually used in Scripture Genesis 31 and 1 and I'll bring it home in a second just bear with me I tell you I didn't know where to get on and where to get off but I'm just riding Jim is is 31 and one look at this and he heard the words of Leoben Leoben son Sam Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory so what with this is the first time that we see the word glory actually used in Scripture and and what has happened here in and Jacob situation is that Jacob had a job where he went down there to Laban and he got tricked and all kind of stuff was happening but in the midst of all the things that was going on Jacob still somehow got blessed because the hand of the Lord was with him right and when Jacob got blessed Jacob had accumulated so much amen he accumulated so many atoms he accumulated so much wealth that that Lathan sons testified that man Jacob got glory and what I want you to understand is that if you obtain some things in life amen and people can say their old man you got some for the only reason you got that cords because of what God did to keep your glory and then the other thing I will say that if you got some glory then you also ought to give some glory when you realize you been blessed in spirit of baby he got me they changed Jacobs way just ten times they did a lot of stuff to try to I ain't me to try to keep him down but Jacob still obtain glory when you got some glory give God the glory look at this Jacob glory was his wealth in his blessings and he obtained this glory through the things he suffered now I'm all the way back to my scripture because we're not going to get anything you know we when we talk about adoption we talk about places we talk about things like that it's not gonna come a man easy you're gonna have to go through some suffering in order to be able to get the glory and let me tell you he do want to share his glory with you can I read a couple statements and now I'll close out with a quote here but this is let me read just a few of the scriptures for you here a man I just I was just blessed let's go to second Corinthians chapter three second Corinthians chapter three verse seventeen God wants to share his glory with you you know when that when that son is adopted when he's given a man he's taken out there to the platform before the public and they they begin to you know recognize that his name on the check is as good as his father's guess what that boy is bringing glory to his daddy now amen that's that's what's happening he's been displayed he's on display he's bringing glory to the father because of the son is supposed to bring glory to the father listen this this is a second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed in the same image see as we behold God's glory we've changed into the image of his glory listen we've changed in the same image from glory to glory even as the Spirit of the Lord that's what's happened as we come to church we're being changed from glory to glory go to 1st Peter chapter 4 1st Peter chapter 4 and I'm a started at 1st 12 hey man look at this hallelujah 1st Peter chapter 4 starting at verse 12 like look at this now you go all the way you go and get this glory but you got to go through some suffering but look at it beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rested upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified stay right there go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter one look at this verse three and God wants to share his glory according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain earth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue see we've been called to this amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be the partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and when you started looking at all of that you know he starts to tell us he said beside this giving all diligence to add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience to patience godliness see this is the character Christ that has to be developed in every believer and to godliness brotherly kindness into other counties charity but if these things be in you and abound they make you that you neither let's just neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sense let me tell you something if you like these things you're gonna lack the glory can I say Amen one other thing here Haggai talked about it oh my there's a scripture that I was gonna I was going to read but Jesus actually said Solomon and all of his glory it's not a rage like the lilies of the field and you understand lilies in order for them to get glory in order for a literally to get glory lily has the press this way through some stuff but notice Jesus word said Solomon and then all of his glory well what is that solid and all of his greatness Solomon built the first temple but you know that temple was destroyed and that's why I hey guy comes along a little bit later and he says the glory of the latter house is gonna be greater than the former and can I tell you something when you took your trip down memory lane what where you used to be I want to tell you the Gloria where you're going to right now gonna be much greater then where you used to be the glory is coming again it's going to happen we repent quickly the glory is coming again but it's gonna be greater than it's ever been before hey I'm on expectation for us but it's after you go through some suffering after you go through some suffering this morning in church James this is our last quote I want to read this he goes right back to Romans 8 in which we read the Prophet makes this statement why does he stand by so the reason is in Romans 8:17 three times that 117 - 1 1 1 1 1 7 - 1 smyrnaean church age he says why does he stand by the reason is romans 17 8 I mean Romans 8:17 through 18 it says that if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us God I share his glory with his people look at this unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply has never mate without suffering I told y'all at the beginning you go back to the Bible you see everybody did you read about went through something if you're gonna hang in the Hall of Fame you got to go through the Hall of critics you have to suffer terrain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can train because POW apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share I told y'all he wants us to share some things since he wants us to share even his game on the same basis that he overcame and a set down his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him I love this and the little temporary suffering what does that tell you trouble don't last always the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing because you got to be willing who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation I remember brother troll when he first started out I said the kingdom of God suffers violence and say they say we got to confront the opposition right we got to confront the opposition you gotta have some stuff you go through but it's just bringing about God's glory that's all it's doing whatever whatever your suffering is bring about God's glory and I just I just felt you know just in my spirit because I really believe that the glory that you have experienced once before it's coming again I'm gonna tell you something it started this morning [Applause] Moses one time acts God Lord I beseech you show me your glory he wanted to see God's glory and and and brother Brandon made a statement he said I didn't get a chance I'm gonna just give you the the the the summed up version a man of what he said he said what really is God's glory they said when you see his healing when you see his wonders when you see his manifestations you are looking at his glory now you might have something you're going through right now in your body and you wondering why why why is that it's the same question that was axed to Jesus when they saw a man that was born blind you you might say well why am I going through this wine me the disciples asked Jesus they say why they say this man blind say whose sin was it his parents or him who sin why was this wisest man in his condition and Jesus says his mama danced in his dad it in sin and also he didn't sin he said but the reason that this condition exists it's so that everybody else could see the glory so the reason your condition exists because God wants to display his glory don't run from it Church run to it we saw God's glory when when David went to Goliath we saw God's glory right every trial we see in Scripture it reflected and show how great our God is and he wants to do the same in you the glory shall come again let's pray father just a thought Lord that you brought to me because we're just reading in the church age but the Lord how we longed to Lord just help the people see that you you're doing something even right now this is a message of prophecy the glory will come again no matter no matter what it is that we've gone through no matter what it is that we're facing the glory will come again it's the father in the name of Jesus let the people begin to experience that don't let it just be words that have been spoken but father may it be a reality in the life of every believer somebody wants to feel you the way they used to feel you somebody wants to serve you the way to use to sturb you somebody wants to live a man closer to you the way they used to God father let that glory come again and we realize that trials and tribulations are designed they're designed by your father that it might bring glory to you so lord don't don't let us run from it let us be like David run to it realizing a man that is not about we like we're not trying to bring glory to ourselves but we want to bring glory to you we want to exalt you we want to live for your God's that is our desire Lord let these words be received not just in the hint but in the heart of men and women today let these words be received and God they will see that the glory will come again I'm also reminded the scriptures say all have sinned and we fallen short of your glory that's because we were trying to do it in our own strength the Lord when we recognize that your blood washes us and cleanses us O God then you present us in your righteousness and we can live in that God daily we can live in that so what we pray we pray that each one father would receive what it is that you want them to receive today and they would begin to walk according to your glory we commit the hearers of this word into your capable hands in Jesus name we pray hey man and a man came together Lord a hand of praise [Applause] hallelujah a man a man Moses said I beseech thee Lord show me your glory and Moses heard those words God heard those words from Moses he showed him a man his his bat hinder parts he said you couldn't see my face and live but i'ma show you my head the parson got to show himself to Moses Amen Anna in a very special way in but when we saw Jesus we realized that we could see the face of God and live Scott warned us to behold his glory God wanted to express his glory God wants us to live in his glory hallelujah church you are part of that don't let the devil rob you of the place that God has for you if you've lost your way man I want to encourage you repent quickly repent don't leave the church Amen that they just repent quickly sometimes it's good you just used to be it's time you go to church man when people repent and go straight to the altar get things right with God now foking bears to go to the altar but know all its is a place where you want to meet right but I
