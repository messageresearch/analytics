Lord for your grace and mercy oh Lord in our lives Lord we know oh Lord that it's only by your mercy that we could be here oh Lord to receive from you oh Lord Jesus Christ uh there are plenty of churches out there oh Lord that have the Bible oh Lord Jesus but Lord in this day and age oh Lord You've provided us with a messenger oh Lord God to reveal the Mysteries oh Lord Jesus Christ to know the inner thoughts oh Lord God in the backside of your mind oh Lord God to know exactly what pleases you oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we are the Ables of the day oh Lord God that have the revelation of what to sacrifice to you to know that would be pleasing oh Lord God and what would be accept to you oh Lord God lord we don't come in our own knowledge oh God or or our own way oh Lord God but because we know it's nothing within ourselves we could have done oh Lord God the Bible says we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity oh Lord God but somehow Lord God when you passed over the earth oh Lord God and you saw us in our States oh Lord God there was compassion in your heart oh Lord Jesus there was a love inside of your heart oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord God there was a mercy oh Lord God there was there was something oh Lord that Drew you to us oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord and you picked us up oh Lord you cleaned us off oh lord lord we struggle with our past sometimes oh Lord God but when you see us oh Lord God you don't look through us with your own eyes oh Lord God but you look through us through your son oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord the only worthy one oh Lord God lord the only one that could walk through Earth every single second and please you oh Lord God and everything he did every action action he said oh Lord God from the from the moment he was born in this earth oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you did that oh Lord God that we could be represented with him today oh Lord God blameless oh Lord God lord we ask that you be with the message oh Lord God and touch the hearts oh Lord you see your people oh Lord God lord they're struggling with sickness in the body oh Lord God they struggle with the mental Pro mental battles oh Lord God they have loved ones that they have

God it's alive and it's living oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you indeed are the same yesterday today and forever so Lord we invite you oh Lord to come down take preeminence oh Lord Jesus Christ be with us oh Lord God oh Lord we know sometimes that we fail you oh Lord God but here we are again saying try us again oh Lord and be with us oh Lord God bless the service oh Lord God in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen prise the Lord all right so we're going to get right into the message uh the title of of the message that the uh the lord gave me um is the the power of responsibility and um uh Abby kind of is the one that kind of inspired me when she got her new car um because I'm noticing the the young ones that are in church and there everyone's getting bigger I uh I know my dad had a picture of uh the Morales when they were young kids and I was uh at our TV it just kind of passes on the screen and I saw them when they were all young and you know you look at them today and you see everyone is getting bigger everyone's getting more wiser everyone's getting stronger right and uh and uh a big thing that comes with that is knowing the responsibility of what you've been given as you as more light cuz um your physical your physical matur maturity is a type of your spiritual maturity and as you physically grow you see more things and you understand more things than what you had when you were younger and with that understanding comes a responsibility now right just like as in the in the Supernatural sense as you're growing uh spiritually uh there's a responsibility that comes with that Paul said you know once when I see that you have milk but now that you eat meat you got to change the way you think and change the way you do things right all right so we're going to get right into it with the Bible verse reading let us turn to Genesis 1 and we're going to read verses 26- 28 and I'll go ahead and start reading this and it reads and God said let us make man in our our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and you may uh uh be seated so um I looked up the definition of what responsibility was and I found four uh examples of it so we're going to go through each four of them and we're going to we're going later on in the message we're going to um provide emphasis on one specific meaning of it so the first uh definition that we have is the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or having control over someone and the next one would be the state or fact of being accountable or to blame for something and the one that we're going to focus on a little bit later on this is probably my favorite one um it's the opportunity or ability to act independently and make decisions without authorization and I want instead of the word authorization I want to say interference so the opportunity or ability to act independently to make decisions without interference and I like that word opportunity because it's not something you give to yourself opportunities are not stuff that you give to yourself opportunities are what someone else gives to you right somebody else is giving you an opportunity to do something to be independent and also to make decisions and the last definition is going to be a moral obligation to behave cor uh correctly toward or in respect of right so as we've read in Genesis um it shows that power and Dominion is a goal that God wants for his children it's always been inside of his mind ever since he created a body for us to live in and dwell on the earth God has always wanted us to be in control God has always wanted us to be on top the Bible says he wanted us to subdue subdue means to have control over God wanted us to have power right but in the space of time that we're living right now the emphasis is no longer on power so in the beginning right before the fall the character was already in them there was no such thing as building your character up now they had power right they had power and they had character but it was already who they were because the Bible said that he was made in they were made in the image of God so the character was there there was no need to build character all right but now the space and time that we living in right now the emphasis is not on power right which is why a lot of times when you hear the the prophet you hear the prophet preach he says don't focus on the gifts right don't focus on the gifts right but focus on the character that become that's behind the gifts which is the word and that tells you what you're dealing with right so we're we're we're in a time in space where we're not focusing on power because the world just wants power and that's what we see nowadays it's power power power no character the sole focus is just getting power and the prophet even said that power without character is satanic right now I want you to know that every single one of us has power right now and what we choose to do with it which is the character shows uh who's using us right and so the question is well how do you get character right that's the question that every believer wants to have is how do we get character so that we can use his power right it's by fulfilling your responsibilities right and so when you get a child if you're uh you know you're newly married and you get a child and you take care of them that's going to help build your character right that child then becomes your responsibility and it helps you as you go through the ups and downs cuz children are not easy to deal with right I used to work at a daycare when I was in high school and you know some of them I know some of them parents were happy to drop their kids off for a little bit of time you know because some of them kids is rough right some of them kids are rough and uh uh but it's a good thing because it helps to build character as a person in your eyes right because you know when you get a side eye from your kid you know as they start getting older this is this is a kid that when they were helpless you fed them right you took care of them you gave them clothes you you gave them love when they were sick you took them to the doctor and everything and now all of a sudden this one eye makes you for makes you almost forget about all the other things right and you be ready to just you know what n I'm done with this right but it's a moment to help build your character right to show that you know what I I know exactly what I did for you and I see what you're doing now but you're my kid I forgive you and I love you and you just put it behind you right and it's all and that all that shows the character that you have right because you have the power over that child right but then choosing to love your kid in spite of what they're going through that shows uh uh your character it's also character building as a child and how you treat your parents growing up how you treat your parents is a reflection of how you're going to treat everybody else in life that's why a lot of times kids they think that oh yeah just disrespect your disrespect your uh your parents but I'm just going to be cool with my buddies that you don't live with and you not on them with a day-to-day basis so you're not going through ups and downs with them but the way that you treat your parents right that's exactly how you're going to be with your friends when you get on your own that's why a lot of times people try to move out with their friends and then and bad stuff just doesn't it just don't work they're like I don't know why I moved in with this person right it could be them but you also need to ask yourself well how were you in your own household you might have been the issue you might have been a problem in that situation all right so so the way you treat your parents is a moment of character and what that is is character building always comes when there's ATT tension right it's never when things are good that doesn't show character right that that that's not a sign of character that's just that's just a Mountaintop but when things get tense when things get real real uh down to it and it feels like you're going to explode that shows who you are right or it's either a moment where you'll fall or it's either a moment where you will allow the situation to make you better right and that's what Christians uh Thrive off so the world all they want is just power power power I was watching this video um on YouTube it was a YouTube reel and it showed a time during the Vietnam war where we were uh going to war Vietnam and the Vietnamese had dug these tunnels and it was a video showing how they you know fought each other and the Vietnamese had dug these tunnels and there was a trap that they had laid for the American soldiers where the soldiers would fall into this hole in this tunnel one end they would pour water in on the other side and then they would be waiting for them on another tone on the other side and so now you can imagine this soldier that is only the trapped in this little thing he can't go this way and he can't go that way because he knows deaf there so now he's just sitting in this uh hole waiting for the water to fill up knowing that death is there and it just kind of broke my heart to see man treat each other like that right to see knowing that this man uh possibly has a family uh he comes from a mother he comes from a father he comes from people that loved him right and just to see a man be in that position and you have the power to let them live and you let them die it just shows you that the world from the Garden of Eden even though we've been given power it just shows you without character uh uh it's totally a mess right it's totally a mess and we need a savior to help us right because that's just the the physical side of it but when you look at the spiritual side of it especially in the church you know the prophet said you may not murder somebody you may not stab somebody in the back right but when you take a cut at their influence right or or you take a cut at their hope CU a lot of times you know you'll have someone in a church and like we're family every family has their characters every family has their people that's difficult to deal with and when you take the side of you know what I'm just going to ignore this person because I don't like dealing with that and then someone else sees you doing that and then they follow like okay well if he's ignoring it I'll ignore him too all right now you have to understand that Christ doesn't always Christ is not coming to perfect people he even said himself if I have no need to go to the ones that are healed I'm coming to the ones that actually need help right so so by By ignoring these people or ignoring these uh as like brother Jack was pre uh preaching before about the fellowship by by putting off these people or you're going through kind of some discussion all a sudden you're you're in a spiritual war in the church and by choosing not to love or you're no different than these men that were killing these people physically even though we like to look at that video and say oh man what they're doing is wrong right weend we end up uh being in David's shoes where you know the prophet came he didn't tell them exactly everything he just told him a story to type it and David said where is this man at we going to finish him right and then uh the prophet said you're that man that's right right so we judge ourselves right but uh thanks to the grace and mercy of God we receive Grace so that we can do better right God wants us to love each other God wants us to strengthen each other that means that you're not going to things are not always going to be easy in a church you're not always going to have people are going to go through certain situations in life that affects how they act and then you have no idea what's going on right and that's a lot and a lot of times you know people get the wrong idea of church and they say oh well I left church because church is like the church was like this and the church was like that the first thing you need to ask yourself is that God's body is a diverse body God has a bunch of churches out there and your personality your characteristics are not going to fit in all churches that's right that's why you have to be led to the church you're supposed to go to or you end up causing problems you see what I'm saying you end up causing problems for that church and you're a Believer you're a Christian 100% but you're trying to venture without Authority it's no different than the body so the body is a you have a different body parts you have a heart you have a liver you have a stomach and they're all they're all different and they're all different cells that are doing different purposes but the end goal is to keep the body healthy right and so you have to look at it from a bigger picture of Lord where do I fit at what church do I fit at I know I'm a certain type of way and there's a certain people out there that can handle your ups and downs no different than marriage you know you're you're not you're looking Lord who am I to marry I have these characteristics I have these personalities who can help me through this stuff not everyone can do that for you which is why we have a lot of issues with marriage and divorce today because people are trying to make their own decisions right so power is easy power is the easy thing it's already with inside of us and in the story of the prodical son um when he left did his status change in the household status didn't change if the servants were to uh talk about the son just because he was in that St in that state the father would have said all right this this your last day even though the son wasn't living up to expection so the son still had power in the house you see what I'm saying he still had power in the house to influence the father's decision even though he wasn't living the expectation right so the problem was there was a lack of responsibility with his status that was what the problem was what there was no responsibility so he couldn't be allowed in the house so and and and I like to I like to talk about real things right real real things because a lot of times you know uh uh this is a youth Service A lot of times your parents there's going to be a point where they can't put up with certain things right and I don't say that as a way to be mean right but your parents Godly Parents they're trying to keep a certain atmosphere and when you start to go against that they have to make a choice right they got to make a choice and it's not to uh uh uh it's not to pick on you because a lot of times you know when kids end up in that situation they think the whole world is against them right we're going to do some reading because Jesus typed this to a story right and it's something that we all know so we're going to turn to Genesis 3 and we're going to read verses 22 to uh I believe 24 and it reads the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from once he came so he drove the man out and I looked up that word drove what it meant in the Hebrew word and that was by force right one of the definitions was by force and the other definition was sad anger right so it wasn't it wasn't God wanting to kick them out they did this to themselves but God had an atmosphere in that Garden that he did not want to change right God had his own atmosphere and he said nah the way that you're living right now right you currently you guys can't you guys can't stay with me now uh cuz it says here he says at least they put forth and take also the tree of life and live and eat forever God ain't want them to live in that state God ain't want to live with them forever like that God was like no y'all can't could you sisters imagine having to give birth eternally cuz God wanted to create Sons he told them to multiply and be fruitful in the Earth the prophet said he wanted to speak them into existence not by could you imagine sisters having to give birth eternally God was like no y'all can't have that up in here y'all made y'all's decision y'all do it for a time when y'all get cleaned up and come back then we're good right God is thinking and and you know and and a lot of times you know you'll have kids go through birth defects you know and it's sad because you'll have sometimes mothers are pass away and all that kind of stuff and people always want to uh blame god well why does God allow these things God never wanted it in the first place all right that was never in God's mind in the first place all right all right so let's see where we at so the Bible says that even though they fail they still had uh the Bible says they still had access to the Tree of Life which showed they still had power right God had promised them access and I believe that any God-fearing parent you know if if if if they if they've told you to leave the house it's not forever you can come back right you can clan if as long as you get your act cleaned together right and you bringing in the same atmosphere that's being presented by the parent your parents will be more glad to let you back in right and and the only reason I say this is because when I was when I first became a Christian and when you first become a Christian everybody expects that things are going to be easy but that's not the case everybody wants the easy path to Heaven that's on everybody's heart but the Bible but the uh the song that they have out there that sings it says some through the waters some through the flood some through great trial but all through the blood so you can't choose your path to Heaven how much you're going to suffer what you're going to deal with the things that's going to uh cause you to uh go out of church get out of your parents uh uh parents house you can't choose these things now it is you choosing it right right it is you struggling with it and God's going to help you with it but I just want to I want to I want to give some encouragement to you that that you know and especially the ones that are out there if they're listening if you're in that state you know cuz God told Peter right and this is the only reason I can say this because Christ said it cuz Peter was enthusiastic that he was going to stay with the Lord he was enthusiastic he said no Lord I ain't leaving you I'm going stay right with you Jesus Christ said you going to deny me three times before the CR Clos you going to deny me three times but it's okay I've already forgiven you right so it's important for you young ones to know and even the ones that are uh that may be listening that are out there God has already forgiven you he's wanting you to come back right now he's wanting you to come back right now right and even when you get your even if you see yourself in that situation I at least want this to at least be a seed that's planted in your heart so that you'll know that God wants me back right because a lot of times people think that everything's going to be easy I can't promise you a Christian easy Christian life but I can promise you God will be there for you right I'm not one of those uh uh Prosperity preachers that promises you riches you may not have riches but you'll still have Christ right so now any good parent that wants the best for their children is not going to allow them just to do anything right you like you realize that even though the child is Young they have a greater potential as they get older like you young ones you have the great potential to do great things uh uh wonderful things you have the potential to do great good things and you have the potential to do great bad things right and so your parents play a role in uh uh in in raising you and wanting to see you succeed in life because God Likens we all know that God Likens a a the relationship between a parent and a kid to God and his own children right and so your your parents are are are going to raise you with discipline and support and I like to think of that as uh the the the Old Testament and the New Testament because we like you have people out there that only believe the Old Testament you got people out there that only believe the New Testament right or people that only believe this part or people that only believe that part but you need discipline and support right you need the discipline to let people know when they're wrong to tell you the TRU truth but you also need to support to understand when people are struggling just like the time when the prophet his son had got in trouble right and his wife wanted him to tear him up but he was able to catch a revelation that he's already beating himself up I don't need to do anything in that situation that's the support side but then there are also there are some sides where you have to lay down the law right and that will save them uh and that's and yall have already know testimony about how my mom kept us locked in the house it felt like prison I I mean I stuck in your room doing the same things over and over again hey mom there's a party can I go nope so I ain't go to I I I I don't believe I don't believe I probably went to like one little hangout but I Ain really go to no she ain't really allowed me to go to any parties right but I thank her for that because parties you know you just think you're just going to hang out with friends but parties lead to other stuff you don't see the tricks and traps that are there because you know I've I've SE I've seen people homeless on the street and that could have been just attending one party that has led to a choice that's led to a choice that's led to a choice and now they're on The Silo Road asking for money asking for help because they didn't have parents that told them the truth cuz I remember we were we were living in a neighborhood with this other with his other mother um and we used to love going over their house because their mom let them do anything me and my sister we love to we love to hang out with them because their mom wasn't strict like ours right but I but looking back in my life and looking back at how the reason why my mom put us in a situation that it was like that was because of love and now now that I've grown up and I'm more mature and I have that understanding I can look back and say thank you for that Mom right that's how that's how a parent should be for their kid you're not looking to be friends with them in that moment you're looking to be friends later on in life and that can be hard for kids to understand you know especially when you're younger because it's hard to know what you don't know like we've all been there right we we've all been there uh uh trying to figure out things on our own right and so you know a a parent wants to wants to a parent should be your biggest cheerleader right a parent should be your biggest cheerleader in life because they want to see you succeed right so that when kids get older and like I said this is typing God because this is how God is for us uh uh uh um we want God should be our biggest cheerleader and is our biggest cheerleader right and so he and and the reason why is because when you when you have your kids as they get older you want you want to be able to appreciate the value they add in life right you and God wants to appreciate the value that you add uh in life which is his creation right and they're not bringing shame uh to the family name now family name is something that's been taken out of culture right because back in the day your your name meant something that's right where you came from really really meant something nowadays it's it's it's uh every nowadays it doesn't even matter you say somebody's last name it doesn't really mean anything right but back in the day last name meant something that's right right and we're going to we're going to delve a little bit in on this topic because family means representation it means uh when you do something people aren't only looking at you right they're not only looking at you but they're looking at your name that's being attached to you right so you know we have we got the young people today we got Josiah uh you know we have Shalom we have hadassa we have Abby we have Linda but it's not just Josiah you know your friends may call you JJ and jdub you know kids try to get the nicknames but it's Josiah Solomon right Solomon shows what he oh yeah Johnson Josiah Johnson Johnson shows where he comes from it's shalom Johnson it's hadassa Johnson Abby Morales right it shows that you're attached to something else it's not just you right when people say your name is not just you right um you're born with an expectation of responsibility for the name that you have right it's an inheritance which is why when um when Esau rejected The Inheritance it was something you couldn't come back from because that was that was who you that was who you were this was what your father was given to you right right so you know and and and you think about what that name means because your last name brought you opportunities so a lot of s if you were a young kid and you had a a a OnPoint father did right everybody knew him in the community this was a good person and if you and if you just was looking for a job and you went up to some kind of old ice cream par or something you said hey I'm looking for a job I'm so and so oh you're so and so's kid come right on in here do I need to fill out an application don't even worry about it come right on in we'll get you a job just because of the name you are attached to right and the opposite is true too because if you had a parent that wasn't doing things that was right and everybody knew who they were and you try to come and get an application you say hey I'm so and so oh yeah n we a hiring we not hiring right because of the name because of the association that was with it right and it's it's and it's it's it's it's something that as kids you want to make your you want to make your parents proud you want to make your father proud you want to make your mother proud that's why you want to do things in life that doesn't cause them to uh um kind of take a pause like if you if you if you're if you're a young sister you want to have a respectable career you don't want to do a career that's uh uh engulfed in worldliness and all the lust and all those kind of things because now when your father is talking to someone maybe a business opportunity they and they asking about your family like yeah hey how what do your kids do and you're doing something that is not you know it causes the father to take a step back and like man like what do I say you're a Christian you can't lie that's what do you say right so whatever you're doing in life is it's it's just not just affecting you right and it's all and also that's why you know even in our own lives we have people in our family members now the blood of Jesus Christ covers all I'm not here to sit here and and pick on people and no God loves you God is in the sea of God's forgiveness but I'm just trying to point something out to prevent you uh from bringing more uh uh from bringing more problems right but you know if you have you have someone in a family member that hasn't done you know just exactly right when people ask about your family your only your your first priorities are going to be the ones that's doing good you always going to talk about well hey yeah my so Uncle son so he owns like five businesses and you know my aunt you know she's got her PhD and her Masters and and it's said oh yeah what about that Uncle over there and it's like man it's a hesitation because you're scared of the association right so it's a respon you can see the power of responsibility in a name and when it's and when you become a Christian because it's funny you say Christian but the word Christ is in Christian your name is attached it's no longer just you it's you and Christ right so whatever you do in life is going to reflect him true right so and it's funny because you know when people make you know kind of these selfish me decisions it's a deception because the thing about it is you're always going to need help in life and a lot of times when you're young you want to go out on your own you just want to do everything yourself but the reality is you will always need help you're always going to need help you're never going to be able to do everything yourself it may feel like it because you're young and you got all the energy in the world and you feel like you can just conquer everything but you will always need help from somewhere you're always going to need help from somewhere and when you go out and make selfish decisions right uh um what happens is you end up coming back for help you end up coming back uh for people to come and ask you for help right and when you belong to a good family you're going to receive good help when you belong to a good family and represented by a good family you will always receive help but the way you receive that help matters it's kind of like if brother Jack had had a cousin where he came and asked him to borrow some money and he ain't pay him back for the two other times he asked and you you being a Christian you want to say no but the Bible says if someone says you want to walk two miles walk five miles so as a Christian you're like okay I'll help you out versus someone that you know has been good levelheaded and they're and and they might be in a situation where they're struggling like Hey Brother Jack I need I need to borrow some money it's like I got you right so it's always help but how you receive that help matters right how you receive the help matters and so continuing on with this type of this type between God between parents and kids and God and Christ you know when you get old as a parent and this is something I begin to realize you know I'm I'm over 30 so I can I can say some things I know I'm not all the way old a lot of old people tell me to tell me that you not old but but as you get when you're a parent and as you get old the thing is you get you lose strength you know you get in a position where you're not able to take care of yourself you're not able to do the things that you once did before you're not able able to think the way that you used to uh think before so now you're depending upon someone else to help you out and when you have raised a kid right and you have taught them responsibility and the kid has accepted that accepted on that responsibility you now have total confidence that they'll take care for you right they'll take on that responsibility of what it means to take care for you when you're in your helpless position all right right and uh um so so young ones it's not your parents wanting to control you good Godly Parents don't want to control when uh Hannah made a prayer for her child uh she said Lord I want him to be your servant I want him to serve you I want him to uh uh uh uh um do the work for you you're the one that's in control his life when Mary had Jesus and when Jesus they were at that they were at the meeting where he kind of said well Joseph is not my father the Bible says that she took that to heart because it meant something to her because she realized the responsibility that she had in this kid and that she wanted to raise him up in the glory uh and admonishment of of the Lord so Godly Parents don't want to control you right good Godly Parents don't want to control you right and that that types God in a way of um God doesn't always want to do stuff for you you see what I'm saying God and it it sounds funny right it does sound funny but God doesn't doesn't always want to uh intervene in situations for you right now God doesn't get old like parents and weak right he doesn't get old and weak uh um because he keeps he keeps uh watch over his word day and night the Bible says he doesn't sleep but he wants us to get to a point where we care for his word like he does right when cuz he's in a position right now where he doesn't have hands he doesn't have physical hands Hees doesn't have a a a voice like he did when he walked on Earth he doesn't have feet he doesn't have a brain right it's not that he's helpless but he's in a position where he needs help and so now he needs us to be able to step in but he's got to have confidence that if he comes down and gives us a word and gives us a responsibility will handle the situation correctly all right we will handle it correctly right he doesn't have to push us and and and constantly uh tell us how to act all the time no we know exactly how to act at all times right and and and in that point there lies a mystery that in some situations uh that you face in life God doesn't say nothing and that's to come back to type our definition of responsibility uh is the opportunity to act independently and make decisions without interference right God is wanting to see how you're going to act in a situation that's why he won't say anything he wants to see what decision you're going to make he's trusting you to make a responsible decision right uh uh and your parents are no different than that so A lot of times you know when you ask your parents for something and they say well let me get back to you out of that means you know they probably can't do it you know but but sometimes it means they're watching you now well why do you want to do this well why should I give this to you like you know hey hey I I want to I want to increase in my allowance okay cool let me think about that but they're watching what you're doing with your allowance right now they're watching what you're doing with your chores right now they're watching how you handle situations right now because they want to see responsibility they don't want to just give you power right they don't want to just give this stuff in your lap they want to see some responsibility which is character so that when they give you something they trust that you will handle it well which is why sister Abby sister Abby has has built enough confidence in her dad that he gave her a car cuz he trust her to make the right decisions with the car right he trust her to make the right decisions with the car there was something in her lifestyle where he looked and said now she's ready for it do you see what I'm saying and that's how God is with us it's not that brother brother wants to drive in a car with her all the time right and God doesn't always want to uh okay do this do that do this do that do this do that no he wants you to be able to go go out and say man I'm confident that if he if I send him along that path I'm not going to hear a bad report I ain't going to hear some kind of uh uh complaint over there I just trust that you know you walk over there let me just do something else right God wants to have that Faith uh uh in US right amen so God was trying to show that um to the children of Israel right so when Moses got to the Red Sea sat there and cried out to God for help it confused God I believe God was pretty confused we're going to turn to Exodus uh uh Exodus 7 and read verses [Music] 10-2 and it reads and uh and this is just a pre this is kind of like a prequel to what happened at the rest and Moses and Aron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded so God had told him to do this thing told him what to do and Aaron cast down his robod before pharaoh and before his servants and he became a serpent then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt they also did in like in in like manner with their enchant enchantments they cast for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents so now we here we have Mo Aaron and Moses with this one Serpent and they said look God's with us and they dropped it down and pharaoh and them said okay and they brought all their sticks and said we can do the same exact thing right and I can see that Moses and Aaron kind of looked at each other and we're like okay what's going on here but let's read what happened next for they cast out every man his rod and they became serpents but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods God showed that they had the original word God showed that they had the blessing in their situation so when Moses was at the red se he had already seen God stand for him in the midst of a multitude right of a multitude of decisions and when God said why cry he was expecting Moses to take the driver seat and just speak the word that's right right CU he had showed him so many times and had confidence in him and was looking for him to take the driver's seat now he wanted to sit back and just I want to see what you're going to do now and Moses was crying out right and uh uh because it came down to a time of David when David had went before Goliath uh when he fought Goliath he didn't say a prayer he had so much confidence in God and what God had done before that he said you know what this is nothing right this is we I am able uh uh to overcome uh and have a victory in this and I like that because it shows the maturity of the word in the Old Testament of Moses time crying then we got David just going and speaking how how much more should we be in our time with the word that we have David didn't have the fullness of the word that has been revealed to us right David didn't have the fullness of the word uh uh that we have right but I but I like how that uh the word is maturing because what what's happening is God's confidence in US is growing the more he begins to reveal his word and the more he begins to reveal his word to you it shows he's confident with you and his word just as he was with Adam in the back of the garden right so when Adam and Eve left a garden they didn't like I said they didn't lose power but over time they lost their revelation of what the word the fullness of the word was and now in this day and age as we have a prophet that's begin to open up the uh open up the Bible to us now I want you to understand that it's already been open but individually we're all being revealed certain things right in our own walks the the Bible says that uh Paul Paul planteth Apollo Apollo wat but it's God that brings increase so you can only see as much of God as he allows you and a lot of times he's trying to see you be more responsible with what you have currently before he gives you more right because if he gives you more word and you not have you don't have the responsibility or you don't have the life behind it to back it uh you're no different from Adam and if if Adam if God kicked Adam and Eve out of the garden even though they had ability to get the tree of life he's going to he's going to uh uh keep himself back from us as long as we're not also maturing and in that same state because he's the same yesterday today and forever all right uh another example uh uh uh that's in the Bible uh is when Elijah cursed the children and killed the Bears because they had made uh they had mocked him they said uh thou B had go up right they had mocked him and that caused an emotion inside of Elijah to cause him to curse those Bears now we have Revelation in this day children yeah CH the children now we have Revelation in this day that the prophet said he was wrong for that he had power right he had power but that wasn't a responsible decision with the power he was given that wasn't a responsible choice though God was with him right he had power because now we see brother brandom and I believe it was one time he was having a service and some people were disrespecting in the service and it came to him well what are you going to do about it I forgive him right so now you see the maturity right the power that has been given with him but the prophet stood back and said you know what I forgive him right even though he had power to do something in that situation I believe that caused God to crack a smile right I believe that caused God to crack his smouth to see him handle the word the right way with responsibility it's not always about power and most of the time you realize that and that's why I say the responsibility and power uh uh it's it's more power in the responsibility that's the more bigger part because then the power just comes naturally just like it was in the garden all right am so we want to also look at the children of Israel uh that were stuck in the wilderness now Moses was the voice of God to the people right in that situation with Miriam and Aaron when they had talked about his wife and God had came to them and said I talk to Moses mouth to ear and then I use him to talk to you go Mo so Moses represented the voice of God uh uh to the people and and there was a time where Moses went off to go write the Ten Commandments and we're going to read a little bit from Exodus 321 to see exactly what happened and it reads and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as this Moses did the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt we W what we W not what is become of him now I want you to realize it says when the people saw Moses delayed to come Moses was the voice of God so they weren't doing this to Moses this is what they were doing to God right this is what they were this is how they were treating god um and then of course it says you know they uh they created a god of of themselves verse four it says these be thy Gods oh Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt uh and we're going to go down to verse um six it says and they rose up early on the mo marrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play so they were living in sin right and the Lord said unto Moses go thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves so God was still seeing how they were acting and the Bible says that God brought him into the Wilderness to be tempted which means he was giving them responsibility and when it says that the voice Moses which was the voice of God had came back God wanted to see their reactions so when the voice of God wasn't there cuz a lot of times you have people that come to church dress up sing play instruments right but when it comes to the voice that they feel like the voice of God is not there at work the decisions the actions that they make God has the same exact response to that when God wants a Christian he wants you to be a Christian 100% of the time it's not a Sunday it's not a Wednesday it's not a youth service God is looking for responsible Christians 100% of the time God is looking for some people that are going to live the life 100% knowing that God is always there right because the Bible said that God was still looking at him when he talked to Moses God was still looking at him all right and um and I wanted to um cuz in this situation uh and in verse uh 14 um cuz God had told Moses that his anger was wroth against them and how he wanted to he wanted to deal with these people and it was Moses was the one that reminded him that you made a promise to these people right you're the one that made a promise to the people uh uh and your word can't fail and the Bible says and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people and I like that because it shows you uh a little bit of level of responsib ability Moses had in in in talking with God like no God these people no Lord you made a promise to them I know that you're because Moses had a temper right Moses had a temper problem right and God he's like no God God no you Lord you promised these people right Lord you made a word to them Lord you promised that you would take them to the land that you inherited them so it I believe it I believe in that moment God could feel proud because Moses could say something that he was already thinking in his mind right and it kind of um and it kind of showed cuz I have a situation where you know I was really upset with people at my job um and I mean I was just thoughts just racing in your head right just man where did y'all come from what what in the you know thoughts just going through your head and I remember that uh uh um as I as I began to walk out the workplace uh of Bible verse which is why you read your Bible it's why you pray every day a Bible verse that came to me and said be angry but sin not so God is looking for you to be responsible God is because you don't know you don't know who you're dealing with you don't know who which one of those co-workers you say they're lazy now but the the problem is this is one of the biggest problems that we have cuz I play basketball with some of the brothers from church and I play them oneone right and I ain't trying to be I'm trying to be humble I'll be winning you know I'll be winning I'm trying to be humble no but but it's it's it's it's an analogy out of that because we'll play because they'll tell me you know let's play another game let's play another game and I realize they waiting for me to get tired so that I'm at my weakest so that they can beat me right and it's an analogy because a lot of times we like to judge people at their weakest we like to determine who people are when they're at their weakest but let God take a hold of them right let God take a hold of one of those employees let God come into their life and fill them uh with Bible verses of of work ethic and uh uh love for him and representing him and they'll turn into the best employees just like that right but it takes people it takes people our position that know the word to put up with it to show that you know what it's whatever I I'm still here for you what can I get you for lunch what can I get you for lunch how can I help you out because you're now showing the love of Christ you're giving them something that they could want right so God brought them through the Wilderness to try them and uh it's it's a um it it was a trying time and sometimes it's good and this is in closing sometimes it's good to take inventory you know when you're in situations that are not uh uh uh not pleasant right you know when you're sick you know it's good to take inventory you know to ask you know Lord if you heal me this is what I do to serve you right you know the these are responsible ways to handle situation Lord if you bless me this is what I'm going to do right if we go to Mark 10 uh 40 uh 10:46 to 52 we're going to read a story of a man that God healed and it says they came to Jericho and as he went out to Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind barus the son of tus Sat by the highway begging and when he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace now God could have just went over there and said no no y'all not going to just talk to him like this he's speaking to me but a lot of times God wants to see your reactions when you're in diverse situations when you're in when you're in situations where you feel like his presence is not there God still wants to see what your reaction is uh in spite of that right and it says that when they told him to hold his peace it says he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort arise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus Jesus answered and said to him What wilt thou I should do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and the Beautiful part about this is and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way right so not just being healed not just asking God can I heal me and then go back out into the world right that shows that there's not really a responsibility with power right there right God wants you to when when God heals you when God gives you the power to have faith to be healed he wants you to be uh uh he wants it uh uh used in a responsible way hey Lord if you heal me if you make me better I'm going to serve you even more right um I'm going to I'm going to uh I'm going to uh do what you tell me to do Lord I want to I want to give more Lord if if you give me another job Lord I want to be able to uh bless more people I want to be able to do more for your kingdom right God's looking for those things God can give you whatever you want right but he wants to know that you're responsible and you're going to responsible thing uh thing to it right and so in it there's a concept called stress testing and it's when people put a system under stress on purpose to see how much it can handle and that's what God allows for us cuz God wants us to see us make the responsible choice right and so a lot of times your parents may put you in situations where you feel like man they just loaded in on me they want to see how much you can handle they want to know what you can handle what you not can handle now it a lot of the times because God knows the Bible says God knows what you can handle and what you can't handle so it's not for him it's for you to take inventory of where you're at when you say you got patience God's like okay you got patience all right give you some co-workers uh uh all a sudden your all of a sudden your all of a sudden your kid starts acting a certain way you don't know where this came from and then you explode and God's like you had patience I thought you said you had patience it's to take inventory Lord I need help in this area God already knows where you need help from but you have to ask him first you have to ask him to help you in that amen right and it's no different just as uh uh as uh um kids to your parents ask your parents for help you can ask your parents for help in areas uh that you're struggling with but a lot of times even as adults we tend to hold these things on the inside not admit them to God like God you know my temper is just not where it needs to be a lot of times we try to handle it ourselves because we think that uh we we think we know better or we think that we can do good but sometimes you have to kind of let those things uh let those things go let God help you let your parents help you right because they want to see that responsibility built up inside of you because they know that once you receive responsibility they can send you in any position they can give you anything brother brandom said God's looking to bless people but the problem is when he blesses people they go up but God's looking for someone that when they bless them they go down when they bless them more they go down when you bless them more they go down and down and down and down then God knows that this person can handle it because it's all in us the Bible says we're born and shaped and sin and iniquity we all have the same issues it was it was a it was a revelation point to me when I heard that character was not a gift right when you become a Christian you're not automatically just faith and joy and love and patience and you don't automat that stuff just it is automatically there for you to access but character is choosing to access it right you don't manufacture your own faith and your joy you have it when you receive the baptism the Holy Spirit but you're choosing to yield to it when situations come and that's where the character peace comes right so we're going to uh end this in prayer Lord Jesus Lord your word has been spoken oh Lord God lord we we're so thankful Lord God that we live in a time oh Lord God that you can reveal these things to us oh Lord God and especially at a age oh Lord God with this being a youth service oh Lord God and a lot of the younger ones oh Lord God are now becoming older they're becoming teenagers oh Lord God they're starting to think oh Lord God they're starting to form their own opinions they're starting they're starting to get feelings oh Lord God they're starting to experience things in life oh Lord God they're at a critical age oh Lord Jesus Christ they're at a critical age and they need need more of you oh Lord God even though they may not realize it oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord we just want to pray oh Lord God we ask that your blessing be upon them oh Lord Jesus Christ we ask that your wisdom would be upon them oh Lord God we ask that you would anoint the parents oh Lord God anoint the preaching anoint the all the all the people that they look up to from the church oh Lord God to to the family members Lord we ask that you anoint them oh Lord to live a life oh Lord Jesus Christ because that's what they remember oh Lord God they remember how they were treated they remember what they heard so that when they're in a situation oh Lord where they may not be uh uh um things may not be uh uh well in their life oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord you never promise a road of ease oh Lord Jesus Christ and some people go through great trials oh Lord God oh Lord we ask oh Lord God that you would touch them and anoint them oh Lord and help them in that time oh Lord God if any of them are listening oh Lord God oh Lord let your love wrap around their hearts oh Lord God to know that you want them more then they actually want you oh Lord Jesus Christ you want to see them more oh Lord you want to forgive them you want to love them when the prodical son came home his father wrapped him in the finest linen and gave him a gold ring and killed the uh the fattest lamb or cow Lord God he gave him the best even though he didn't deserve it oh Lord God let it sink in our hearts oh Lord God that you don't give us what we deserve but we still belong to you and you love us oh Lord God guide each one of the youth oh Lord Jesus Christ help them make the right decisions oh Lord Jesus Christ help give them wisdom oh Lord God in a generation where Lord it seems that the kids are getting wiser oh Lord God but they're still making the wrong decisions oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord give them an anchor oh Lord God that they may navigate through these Waters oh lord it's getting so confused using oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord It's hard to tell the difference between men and women sometimes oh Lord and they're going to need something to know right from wrong and discern and not only to discern oh Lord God but give them strength to stand on the truth they may be the only ones oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord but you showed Moses and Aaron all all all they needed was just one rod that was an original word in the midst of many and they could swallow them all up oh Lord God make them courageous oh Lord God make them champions for you Lord and we ask it in the precious name of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen praise the Lord um certainly appreciate uh brother Quinton on tonight and um I I have to say I don't think I ever heard a sermon on the power of responsibility and um just seems like a a very very um appropriate sermon uh for uh not only for our young people but even for us amen Caleb's in the room but uh that was just that was full of nutrients amen full of nutrients and I trust that we'll all just um um take heed you know to what was being shared and um natural always typed to spiritual and you know as he was just kind of talking about how as the kids kind of grow up um you you expect more as they get older right um uh little squish You' be able to get away with certain things that Linda can't get away with right because she's at a she's at a an older age and so the the older we get the more mature we become the greater level of responsibility and expectation just kind of goes with that and and even when it comes to you know the Lord when we're serving the lord for such a time this message was brought to help form character amen and and in Christians uh the faith of Jesus Christ the the patience of Jesus Christ the Temperance of be Jesus Christ uh you know the uh knowledge of Jesus Christ and you know the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ the the love of Jesus Christ you know all of these things that uh brother Brandon was sharing with us but it's all to get us to a spot where we can be empowered by God to do the things that he needs to do brother random told us that when when he got Moses started on the journey down there to go to deliver uh the children of Israel uh brother Adam said God turn to go around go and sit down [Music] cuz they knew Moses had everything under control I I told him exactly what to do Moses got this thing and he said he went to go sit down and and while he was on his way to sit down he heard from the earth Moses say Lord what am I supposed to do and
