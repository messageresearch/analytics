home we were able to go to london uh for easter and we had a wonderful time amen there in london uh we were able to take some of the saints with us and uh we just just uh man they they was having church and felt like y'all brought some of that same out here this morning and just uh it just it's just been it's just been a real wonderful atmosphere but we we just thoroughly enjoyed ourself and uh just the way the lord just did so many things amen while we were while we were there i shared with you all the testimony on wednesday night but some that didn't hear but there was a sister that came to the services and uh sister maddie was her name and she came on on a friday night and she uh she said to she was a member of the choir and she said to the choir member says i won't be able to sing with y'all during this easter weekend i have to have emergency surgery and she says but you know what i'm gonna take my clothes to the hospital and i'm gonna get dressed and when y'all start singing my song i'm gonna be on the line singing from my hospital bed amen with y'all and uh and uh you know so some kind of way they were supposed to sing a song on on a particular day it didn't get sung and um and uh just service after service got it song kept getting delayed so after service i had preached that that they step into the vision and i was sharing the testimony of sister tanya and how she said i don't want surgery until after i'm praying for uh i'm going to the meeting i want to be prayed for after that then y'all can do the surgery and since attorney uh we hadn't prayed and it was the third sermon she'd say look um troy go tell him i want to be prayed for before i go back home so after we preached we prayed for her and brother nathan prayed for her and then we uh uh we came back home and she was preparing for surgery we flew back on monday she was preparing for surgery on uh uh tuesday it's just a tanya amen uh i'm talking about sister tanya right here amen sitting right over there uh because they they say when you when when i was at the church you got to tell the people the press the person is here so i'm letting y'all know she's here amen but uh but um but but sister tanya went for her surgery uh and when she woke up that morning looked there inside of her scalp um the thing had gone it was disappeared it had fallen off god had healed her instantly and so i was sharing a testimony over there and they told us to say sister you cannot go and let them doctors operate on you till you get prayed for them so that i was sitting down eating they pulled me out my chair and said this sister need prayer i said okay we went in the office we prayed for and i encourage you so i thank god get more glory with you being in service than being in the hospital and um she said i said well just you know we're going to do our part the bible tell us to lay hands on the sin and they shall recover that's our part say let god do the rest of it and uh so we we laid hands on we prayed for and uh she said okay and she went on out and got up the next morning reported to the hospital and she got there to the hospital the doctors had already prepped and said okay we're ready ready for the surgery well there's another team that was at the hospital said no we need to check her first before y'all do the surgery they say no we're already ready for the surgery no check-in we're gonna go ahead and take her in right now they say no we need to check her no we're gonna do surgery no we need the checkup so the ones that said we need to check it they won and they pulled over they checked and they looked at it and said wow tremendous improvement you don't need surgery you can go on home so we saw god do an instant miracle praise god amen he is still the same yesterday today and forever and uh so so when that sister came back to church that night you know and i was telling i was in the car brother gwen i said i just i feel something for that sister i just think she god gonna do something and and while i'm saying that she he's getting a text saying the sister's been released from the hospital and she was coming to church i said praise god and so on that on that uh she came back on on on saturday night and we were just doing the worship the time of worship that saturday night just had a wonderful time and and then on sunday morning she stood up to sing that song with the choir and i posted a picture online but it was a brother brother gwen was standing there with the sister right next to him with a blue dress on uh that was sister maddie amen and uh just a uh i mean just a powerful powerful testimony and even in the preaching of the word i had preached the sermon stepping to the vision on friday night brother diggs was not there he was preaching at another church had to come through on that saturday morning for one service and he walked in and all he kept saying was step into the vision like hey this ain't nothing but god say nothing but god so i mean we just and brother diggs had already told to say the same thing happened to them at the other meeting uh he had preached that saturday morning i mean friday morning at a church and brother andrew had preached where we were friday morning but friday night brother andrew went to the other church and picked up on brother digg's sermon i mean just just god moving all over the place every church is feeling the move of the spirit right it's enough to go around for everybody amen so different ones start you know the brothers they called up to testify on that sunday on that saturday night and different ones testifying and one brother just uh walked right into my notes without i was getting ready to preach on sunday he stopped talking about the rock moving i'm like that's my sermon you know and uh and brother whisper had prayed my sermon and he prayed my sermon title and his prayer that saturday morning i'm like lord this thing this is something so i got a chance to talk to brother whisperer after he said he said brother jack the reason i prayed that sermon title because i preached the same sermon the week before it says but i preached it at a different church i didn't preach it at my church i say what he said i just titled it in shona but uh but he said but i preached the same sermon their rock is not like our rock i say god is amazing so you know when you see just the hand of god just confirming amen every step that you're taking uh it blesses your heart gives you a peace you know that you're in his perfect will and uh and we're just grateful and i know there's many other testimonies i did hear of another brother that was uh filled with the holy ghost amen while we were there and uh that that is uh that's that's what the meetings are all about amen um you know it's been the devil that's been trying to keep us away from one another amen but uh but you know what we're gonna have to we gotta break this and we got to be able to come back together and fellowship so they already told us that we got they got a whole bunch want to come over here they they trying to make a meeting happen y'all got to do something so we we're going to try to make something happen because it's a whole bunch of them want to come amen right here to uh uh the u.s and just so many other testimonies i had a chance to talk to a brother who had had the experience of going to heaven and coming back and he was telling me how when he was the angels came to get him they put him in a chariot and as he was going he was going down a pathway uh he says just full of light and they looked to one side and said just full of darkness and all these screams down people that were going towards hell and he said i was going towards heaven just full of light and says as i was going down this pathway i looked on the walls of of of of the tunnel that i was in he said i could see all the sermons that my pastor preached the sermon titles and i could see the sermon titles of the prophet it says i even preached a couple sermons myself and i can see my sermon titles all over the walls and it said pulled me right into this the coliseum and when i got there to the coliseum all these people hundreds of thousands of people just you know welcome my brother welcome my brother so good to have you here brother he was just he said like he felt like a royalty stepping out of a carriage and coming up and he's any any uh and he just kind of heard the voice of the lord you know tell him welcome home and he says he never saw him but he just heard his voice and it says uh it says uh uh i didn't i didn't know i see i knew that i was you know he had meningitis and they that's what caused him to go into this condition he thought he was leaving and uh so he got there and and he just kind of turned and looked back and he looked back he saw his wife and a couple of his young kids and they looked at him said daddy are you sure you want to do this now and he looked at him and he turned and says lord just give me another opportunity just to raise them and um and when they said he heard the voiceover say your request has been granted [Music] and the angels that brought them came and took them and put them back in the carriage took them back through the tunnel and took him back to his body at the hospital and he was supposed to have a checkup at two o'clock and the nurse walked in at two o'clock and she started shaking him you all right you all right like yeah i'm all right i'm all right and she said if she put a a blood pressure monitor on him and checked his blood pressure she said measure zero then tried to take his temperature measure zero she's like oh my goodness you dying you know and uh so so she just freaked out and said hey hey just wait just wait just wait no no no i gotta get somebody in you dying so she said he said no just get another machine real quick and just try it just try it she said no this machine worked i know it worked i just tried it over there she said just calm down go get another machine and bring it over here so got another machine did the blood pressure everything was normal took his temperature everything was normal she said she never seen nothing like that she had to take a seat on the bed and just wipe sweat off her head i ain't never seen nothing like this and they say i i couldn't even tell you what just happened i don't know if you would believe it if i told you i don't know i don't know if you believe it and um you know and he said he was sitting there in his room and he had the picture of brother brandon with the pill of fire of his head he had that you know sitting in his bedroom at a hospital room and he said all the nurses would come in just saying i don't know what it is about this room but it's so much peace in here i only want to go to another room i just want to work on you there's so much peace in here testimony of the testimony of the testimony i was here and i said you know if we get some of them safe to come over some of them we might have to have testify uh i mean there was some there were some powerful powerful things that god has been doing amen this last few years god has been doing some things so uh y'all just keep it in prayer we we we i had a chance to talk a little bit with brother wesko yesterday and we're going to try to make something happen amen we we're going we're going

this when i was coming up as a young man and going to church um there were [Music] as a young man going to church you get your influence from other men in church you knew you see mom and the sisters and all of that and at that time my father was not a man that faithfully attended church so we we went to church and um and and when we got there there were a few brothers in the church that uh made lasting impressions amen on our minds as young men me and my brother and my my cousin amen just a couple of us young men that were coming up and some of those brothers that made last impressions were brother capers amen uh brother stanley amen brother coleman and uh you know we we we learned it was okay to praise god as man watching brother stanley and brother coleman man they enjoyed jesus you get to get a little african song sprung up diva boy that was it and and they didn't mind coming to the middle of the flow this is these the brothers that we following so you know we we have we were we were impressed amen by that in in it and it helped shape and mold us into the men uh that we are today so brother stanley we thank you amen for what you did and what you gave to us amen we thank you for that praise the lord he has been a mainstay no matter what you're gonna find bro stanley right where he need to be and uh just we just appreciate it we appreciate seeing that amen and in him as well as in sister stanley too they were they were uh genuine and i was thinking this morning when i first met um the stanley family we were worshiping in a school that's right westwood we were worshipping in the school and god just got away just yeah just bringing things and and and so and i appreciate anybody's able to come and visit us while we in this season because what we're in is temporary hey everybody want to get on the wagon when it's coming down the hill but nobody want to help you push it up thank god for people that'll help you push it up come on somebody hey i got to leave it alone but i appreciate i appreciate amen my precious brother stanley amen here uh this in matthew 20 uh 27 verse 62 says now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together onto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lets just disciples come by night and steal him away uh and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first uh pilot said to them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulcher shure stealing a stone and setting a watch now i don't know if i'm going to have time to get into a little something that i had here but that watch brother branham said it was 100 men [Music] they were trying to make it as sure as they could 100 men but when god has established a promise i don't care how many people standing against you you can't stop god's word from being fulfilled amen greed is he that's in us and he that's in the world glory to god let's turn over here to deuteronomy 32 and 30. i'll read this and i'll try to move on a man 32 and 30. it says this how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges amen let's pray father we thank you for uh your precious word that has been read and god uh we ask that you would just now anoint our minds to hear what the holy spirit would have us to hear uh even at this moment be magnified and glorified in this portion of the service um god if there's one that needs healing bring healing there's one that needs deliverance bring deliverance if they're wanting the baptism the holy ghost let him be filled even as the word of god is being spoken people can be filled with the holy ghost god make the change in our in our in our in our lives god today we ask it in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you can be seated in the presence of the lord uh we want to just continue our journey on iraq is not like our rock amen part two amen of this sermon um i was um just wanting to make mention of something here uh when we when we look at you know this word here in scripture their rock is not as our rock even as even our enemies themselves being judges um we um we find the reference to rock a man all throughout scriptures god being a rock amen uh david makes that that that that reference in different places he the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer and my god you know and my redeemer uh david just kept going on and on and on talking about his god and that's i kind of feel like that today i just want to keep going on and on and talking about this rock amen uh you know i there's a uh another songwriter gave a modern song that we sing he's my rock my sword my shield he's my wheel in the middle of a wheel i know he'll never never let me down the the other he kept on going so he just uh jewel that i found then he just lost words there all he could say is hallelujah hallelujah i love to praise his name hallelujah hallelujah i love to praise his name good god and and this is what happens to you when you begin to realize what god is to you amen you don't have enough words and your vocabulary to explain amen what he is to you this is a real relationship amen but but i was just looking amen at a number of scriptures here that refer to god being uh our rock a man and when we're talking about that we're saying that he is he he's everything he's our provider he's a protector he's our health he's a you know way maker he's a miracle worker he's our healey he's i mean whatever you need that's what he is amen when we say he's a rock man this is something i can depend on something i can stand on i can stand with i i will never be made a shame with this rock that i have glory to god i thought about isaiah 42 and 11. amen the bible says this let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kadar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing amen hallelujah if you are if you are abiding in the rock come on somebody amen you abide with the rock then it ought to give you a song in your heart amen let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains glory to god i thought about first samuel two and two amen it says this in scripture there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god bless it be his holy name amen psalm 78 and 35 amen that says this and they remembered amen that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer you're going to find this reference to rock all over the scripture amen daniel 2 and 45 it says this for as much as thou sawist that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it breaking pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god have made known to the king what should come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and interpret interpretation thereof sure when daniel saw him amen in this particular vision this interpretation of a dream uh he saw christ as a rock being cut out of the mountain and destroying every other kingdom that have been lifted up i don't care how great the kingdom is that kingdom will be destroyed because the rock christ jesus will destroy it i want to read a little quote here amen from what is the holy ghost given for uh the prophet makes a statement here referring to daniel 2 45 it says there is only one way to find it there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and become like wheat or chaff on the threshing floor let that stone the christ jesus the stumbling stone to the world a stone of an offense a laughing stone a stumbling block to the church a but a precious and loadstone to the believer amen he says a stone of assurance this is my rock it's a rock of assurance and then a stone of rest hey when i'm inside the rock i ain't got to worry about nothing i can rest in there and there it says i know that i pass from death unto life my soul is at rest it says oh come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest to your soul a sign that's to be evil spoken of said the prophet to mary it'll be a sign uh it sure will but it will be an assurance it'll be love it'll be satisfaction it'll be something that you know you pass from death unto life this rock that daniel saw is a rock of satisfaction amen this rock that daniel serves a rock of assurance amen it's a rock amen that we can rest in blessed be the name of the lord amen i'm i'm stopping there but the other thing i thought here amen and while i was over there in london uh after i preached the sermon the rock is not like our rock uh i got a text from brother steven uh thunderberg my nephew uh it says uh brother jack i had a revelation amen as you was preaching on on on that i said okay and he uh he said i just got to start thinking about david and how uh how david picked up rocks and he needed five rocks amen which represented f-a-i-t-h and amen and also he needed grace g-r-a-c-e hallelujah in in in j-e-s-u-s hallelujah amen i said yes sir you know stepped into the second part of my sermon already amen because david had to pick up a rock come on somebody this was not no ordinary rock that he used to slay goliath the reason we know it's not an ordinary rock is because the prophet told us that when david slung this rock toward goliath the rock moved at a thousand miles per hour there is no man strong enough to throw a rock a thousand miles per hour all i can tell you is that this rock a predestinated rock this rock was not like the rocks in philistine and then this rock was different from any other rock and all david had to do was pick up the rock throw the rock in the sling and just uh he gonna just close his eyes and let it go but the rock was gonna hit the target and even this morning if you sit this morning god got a rock that'll hit the target [Applause] whatever you [Applause] hallelujah glory hallelujah david picked up that rock and took goliath down amen but we're gonna need to understand now um that we're gonna go a little deeper but that rock is not just a physical rock that rock is a revelation and if you can just pick up a rock if you can just get a revelation sometimes when you just reading your bible god will speak something to you right out of the bible if you're listening to a tape god or say something through the prophet when you come to church god will speak through the pastor and you begin to just get your script back full of rocks age hallelujah brother diggs was sharing that testimony and how he got sick amen and and and he's like you know what uh the whole church was all concerned like this was sick that was sick and he's like not gonna happen to me all of a sudden the devil struck him and there he is he he got sick later late in the midnight hour and then like i i can't take this i got to preach i can't i can't accept what the devil giving me now so he just began he said he got up in the in the midnight just begin to sing songs and see that song she let the inhabitants of the rock sing so he began to sing a song amen and as he began to worship the lord through song he said just start feeling that that that sickness just lift the next thing you know that that anointing took him into another song and every song just kept kept kept him climbing high and higher till he's into the atmosphere that he personally created you got to learn how to create your personal atmosphere glory to god he the inhabitant of the rock began to sing and as he began to sing he said all of a sudden that sickness just went away and uh he said god had to allow him to be touched by the sickness so he could go and share a personal testimony with the people that all you got to do is begin to worship the lord in the midst of whatever you're going through you'll see that things [Applause] god has to give you a revelation in the midst of everything you're going through that revelation is your rock psalm 62 let's read this amen psalm 62 praise the name of the lord here uh we're going to find a man this reference to rock it's all over the scripture all over the scripture here and brother branham he used this particular um text when he preached the message shalom shalom means god's peace amen and remember when you are in the rock you can have peace amen but you got to be in the rock oh yes amen here uh psalm 62 says truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation uh he only is my rock glory to god he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved he long how long will you imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a a bowing wall shall you be and has a tolerant fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies my god they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly salah my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him it's from him he only i told you when david writes things like this remember how he was hiding in the cave amen he thought that was his protection but in the very cave that he was hiding god brought his enemy right into the same cave right amen so david had to realize the cave is not my protection how many are trying something natural amen some i mean some some you know maybe some natural way to get your you get your needs met hey man your job only is not your your final solution amen it is not your source it's a resource but it's not your source right amen but we gotta understand god alone god only is my rock hey hallelujah amen he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense glory i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times she people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us salah now when brother branham preached the message shalom he stopped there but i want to keep going in this truly men of low degree our vanity and men of high degree are alive to be laid in the balance they are all together lighter than vanity trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them come on somebody amen if riches increase set not your heart upon them amen and i believe riches will increase glory to god it says this god has spoken once twice have i heard this that power glory to god power belongeth unto god also unto thee o lord be lord belong with mercy for thou thou render it's every man according to his work amen god is my rock [Music] amen amen amen amen here in the message shalom just a quick amen uh quote here says um now you if you notice in the scripture reading he's talking about psalm 62 says if you notice in the scripture reading amen there in psalms it kept saying god is my rock he says do you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god so when you say god is my rock he's my revelation and i'm going to tell you when you have a revelation with god you can you can be at peace oh hallelujah church you can really be at peace when you have a revelation amen he said he says uh god is about see god is my revelation he is see the revelation of the word is the rock oh my the revelation of the word is the rock amen so many people that we can go back at and look in scripture they held they held on to one revelation and that was their rock he says because peter one day jesus had asked the question who does men say that i the son of man am and one of them said some of them said you are moses or elijah jeremiah one of the prophets but that wasn't the question who do you say i am he peter spoke up these famous words said thou art the christ the son of the living god it says blessed art thou simon son of jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed this to thee but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock see amen and david speaking here god is our rock god is our rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a rock see god is our rock so when the revelation is made known to you that revelation itself becomes your rock the rock that you can hide in the rock that you can stand on glory the rock that you can have assurance in the rock that you can rest him once god reveals something to you stand on the rock [Applause] hey i'm standing on the rock this morning amen for your parents we're away with children stand on the rock [Applause] find yourself a scripture and just stand on the rock no matter what you see no matter what you hear glory to god if you amen i don't care what your trouble is stand on the rock the rock of revelation that's how god builds his churches upon the rock of revelation oh my my my thank god for this amen here we picked up in in deuteronomy uh 32 i want to just kind of go back and catch a couple more things amen out of this uh glory hallelujah there was something there uh uh uh let's catch verse verse one through four again deuteronomy 32 says give here o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth it says my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the dew as a small rain upon the tender earth and as and as the showers upon the grass moses says because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe you greatness unto our god i'm looking for things to give god praise for and to let everybody else know what he's done for me he says this moses says he is a rock amen his work is perfect for all his ways of judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he i'm skipping down to verse 12 amen in the same chapter moses continues to write about him says so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him talk about how god brought israel out amen the same god that brought israel out the same god that brought us out amen he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock and i love that you know he made him to suck honey out of the rock well why would honey be in the rock oh why would honey be on the rock yeah somebody do you know we are the sheep of his pasture amen let me just read the quote to you uh uh uh uh maybe at door and door i'm gonna get that set up but let me i'm gonna just tell you a little bit about it before i read it but we are the sheep of his pasture amen and sheep a man sometimes gets sick and a shepherd realizes there's a trick for in order to get this in order to get the the the sheep well amen he has it when that sheep gets sick in order to get him well what he has to do is give him some limestone glory to god now a sheep a man in us in his nature will not go to that limestone and begin to live the limestone taste too bad hallelujah to the lamb of god they're not gonna go by themselves and go get no limestone and try to get well they're gonna run from the limestone but what the shepherd has to do is take the limestone and put a little honey on top of the limestone amenity glaze is the stone with honey and the sheep don't realize every time they lick the honey they are licking the rock praise god hallelujah to the lamb of god your healing is in the rock your deliverance is in the rock sometimes we have to dress the rock up a little bit we ought to make it taste a little bit a little different for you but you still getting the same rock and you still don't get the same message of the hour we might have to dress it up sometimes but it's the same rock and it will bring healing there's healing bomb in the rock salvation is in the rock glory to god everything you need is inside the rock oh glory to god [Applause] amen we're going to dress up this quote we're going to dress up this scripture but we want to give it to the sheep so they can lick and get their strength [Applause] oh my my my he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields deuteronomy 32 and 13 and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and all out of the flinty rock i'm gonna keep moving on man amen amen amen all right now um i wanted to you know just kind of go back let's let's keep going in verse 17 and 18 here in deuteronomy it says this they sacrifice unto devils uh not to god the gods whom they knew not so this is what happened to israel they were they were first under the rock and somehow they backslid somehow they backslid and um you know and and here they they get to rather than worshiping god they're worshipping devils and sacrifice unto devils not to god the gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not they got got to worship in a golden calf right what happened here after all these supernatural vindications of god bringing them out of egypt open up the red sea then they still get to a point where they build a new gods and they they tell them they tell them moses is lost up there we don't know what happened to him make us a new god aaron and make an is formed and shape the god out of out of all the gold that they had and he said he said make us a god here he's saying now y'all gonna worship something that y'all had to create but what what what's the matter with y'all right he said they sacrifice them to devils not to god and i want to tell you something this morning there are people going to church right now and don't realize they step into the church and they're sacrificing to devils and don't even realize god ain't got nothing to do with it god ain't got nothing to do with that church they have the bible actually speaks of people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof amen glory to god we got to know what we're involved in hey i ain't going to church just to be identified with some group i need i need i need to get close to the rock they sacrifice unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not verse 18 of the rock that begot thee thou art unmindful they wrote the rock that that begot you you're unmindful we forget where god brought us from a man of the rock that begot thee thou are unmindful and has forgotten god that formed thee but i love this book i'm going down to verse 30. this is why you know moses keeps writing about this rock it says how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and and the lord had shut them up now when we're talking about this rock and god being a rock we're actually saying the rock is christ the rock is christ amen this is this is a spiritual term that we're using uh but when we say that he's a rock we're saying he's our everything [Applause] he's my confident he's my keeper he's my deliverer hey he's my shield he's my provider he's my protector some of us don't even deserve the protection that we get some of us don't deserve the blessings that we get but yeah he still blesses us anyway amen i i mean now he doesn't give us his all when we're going to give him our all right every day he's giving you his all right amen amen when when they told me that you couldn't get that job you weren't qualified and somehow you end up on the job in it who you think opened the door the rock did that amen you were sick the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong god raised you up it was a rock that did that [Music] this is why this is why uh moses writes his word says it says how should one chase a thousand the two put ten thousand to flight except that rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges i love this i love this i want to want to just camp out just a little bit more right in here when we read them verse 30 where it says their rock had sold them oh the language is so uh challenging but when i looked at it in the uh hebrew lexicon it said to sell oneself or to give over to death so in order and when it said their rock had sold them it meant we needed a rock that would give us life for us and we got a rock that not only gave us life for us but a rock that rose on the third day [Applause] [Music] and this is why i say even inside the tomb our rock was laying beneath a our rock was laying behind a rock and they were trying to make their rock as sure as they could the prophet said 100 men were guarding the rock but brother when god sent a supernatural earthquake not even 100 men could guard the rock the bible say they all fell as if they were dead and the angels sat on top of the rock i love this because when when when the angels sit on top of the rock there were two rocks that moved hey the natural rock moved but the spiritual rock that was laying behind the rock also moved hey and i'm here to tell you dale rock is not like caloras [Applause] if he moved on resurrection sunday then he is still moving today [Applause] hey hallelujah you know even you know the reason why we christians go to church on sunday so you you know when you run into people that talk about you know you're going to church on the wrong day you should be going on saturday because saturday's the sabbath and you know you know we get all of that the reason we go to church on sunday is because we're honoring the resurrection according to the scripture jesus rose on the day after the sabbath now here's the other thing i want to tell you is that i'm not limited to just going to church on sunday hey i can praise them seven days a week 24 hours a day so i praise them on saturday i pray them on sunday i praise my mother hey i will praise him [Applause] glory to god so don't get caught up in conversations like that what day we go actually the day is it's actually it's not even a day anymore it's a person the sabbath is a person and unless you have this rock you can't even have a sabbath you can't have rest until you have the rock hey glory to god all right let's pick up exodus 17 again and let me just move on uh and here exit 17 verse three through seven um here we find this rock uh in um moses and children of israel's they're saying the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou has brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirsts and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they'd be almost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and the rock wherewith thou smote the river take taken thy hand and go and look at this behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock and horeb and thou shalt smite the rock amen and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and he called the name of the place masa and maribel because of the children of the childing of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not here they got this question because they got a little thirsty but the way god desired the uh uh um the way god had in his mind to to fulfill their their their thirst is to have moses strike a rock now how many y'all ever went to a rock and got water but this is the way god does that he does does things that blows your mind moses i'm gonna be standing on the rock and i want you to take your rod and strike the rock and watch what happened to the rock now i need you to i want to i want to just kind of bring something in here for you if i can uh let me see here yes go to corinthians book of correction this is a a quote corinthians book of correction when i preached this last week man the brothers were just rejoicing and just just just coming and giving me all kind of quotes after this i said okay that'll be part two then so i figured i would bring it to you i want you to get in your mind what kind of rock what kind of rock could uh moses just walk up to and hit with a rod and water come out water come out and not only a man uh satisfy the people but all the animals how big is this rock how great is this rock well i'ma already let you know i'm gonna already let you know when you're talking about god little as much little is much when god is in it two million people drink from a rock now look at this the the good thing about this is that we don't have to let our imagination wander we got a prophet we can go back to that can tell us what it was amen do you realize in order for you to believe genesis you got to believe a prophet amen what what prophet do you believe in the prophet moses and moses was not in the garden moses came years later moses was not there with abraham how could he tell us what happened on [Music] amen my god i mean how do we know what happened in the garden of eden through moses what he wasn't there how do you know what the serpent said [Music] praise the lord i mean think about it we we just pick it up and read it now but it takes belief in a prophet that's the importance of having a prophet because the prophet actually goes into the mind of god by vision and he sees things and he's able to give it out to you if you didn't have that you wouldn't understand the scripture amen that that's why we stand on this rock of revelation this is why we stand here glory to god without a prophet i wouldn't even be able to preach what i'm preaching right now not with the revelation that i have amen you know the the thing that that i forgot to tell you about this rock that rock when we read it there in um in uh in exodus it wasn't a one-time occasion they didn't just get rocked after one complaint god actually allowed to rock to follow them hey the bible actually said it paul picked it up and said it where did paul get that from paul said the rock was christ in the rock follow them so every time they got thirsty [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen the rock is always with you he promised never to leave him or forsake you [Applause] this is not a one-time thing this is every day when we need we have yo yo your camera thirsty anything you need it the horse thirsty right there your child right here and they like going back to america up the rock follow them but what kind of rock is this and thank god for a prophet that that tells us that you know first corinthians 10 4 just pull that up real quick before i go to the scripture i'm just telling you what the bible say first corinthians 10 4 and the prophet brought these two thoughts together how many times i haven't read first corinthians 10. i've been reading my bible these one-year bible reading plans for over 20 years and never caught this and and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ they drank from that spiritual rock that followed them do you realize even when you get into a little jam maybe a court situation you trying to figure out how to work through this and work through that and what i'm going to do here and what i'm going to say here nah i'll turn [Applause] in court he's iraq [Applause] in jail he's a rock you can ask paul and silas because the rock was with them in jail and the rock will loose the pawns praise god the rock will open up sails the rock will set you free [Applause] wherever you go there is a roar [Applause] praise his holy name i was just just this brother teach you know um he's the brother that actually did the he was the fourth brother to go up on that service uh when they did the the brothers the like the tag team i forget what they call it the relay yeah i said man that's all right just don't even read no scripture start preaching it was good it was real good uh but uh but here you know brother brother teach got up there and after i shared the sermon on last week he said brother jack i just want to share this quote with you and uh we need to thinking about how big was this rock a prophet is going to give us a description and all we got to do is follow this now look at this and corinthians book of corrections says how this rock laying there god had a rock that had a stored full of water just a little rock perhaps not no bigger than that desk i start looking for this i mean sister charisse is back there behind the desks the brothers are back there behind a desk two million people and their animals are fed from a rock that's no bigger than a desk it don't take god a lot just a little rocks perhaps no bigger than that desk but when moses smote this rock there was enough water came from it to water two million people and not only that but as many cattle and sheep and things as they had with them oh when i see some of these artists who paint pictures of a little drop falling out of a rock and a kid standing there with a little bucket in his hand oh it never come like that when you go to this rock it ain't coming out little itty bitty blessings hey look at what happens when you go to this rock hey it never come like that it come by bountiful gushers [Applause] will they come in a way where you can't handle it the exceeding the abundant above all you can ask or think that's what comes from the lord hey i don't know about you but i'm getting ready to give me a blessing from the rock lessons [Applause] [Music] [Applause] go into the rock [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] what a rock with a rock [Applause] it never come like that it come by bountiful gushers a rock as big as a desk bountiful gushers what source is this it watered over 2 million people besides their camels and all the animals the rock that rock was christ jesus a beautiful paranoid of john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life he says and notice what happened the only way that they could get that water out of the rock the judgment rod had to strike the rock and moses smote the rock and god's judgment struck upon the rock and when it did it gave forth its waters see your rock had to be sold they had to be willing to die for you amen it gave forth its waters the people were absolutely god was just just in letting god was just in letting them die because they had disbelieved him they had dishonorable they were reprobates i told you some of us don't don't don't don't deserve the blessings that we do receive if god did not bless you he's just doing it it's just amen he says um they they had been dishonorable they were refer based they did not deserve to live moses called them rebels rebellious against god and they deserve to die and all of us deserve death because we're rebellion against god correct we all deserving deserve dying but god is so merciful he shouldn't never thought of us but he's so merciful till he took the sins of every one of us and struck upon his own beloved son christ that we might not perish but but would have eternal life oh how i thank god for that now let me just slip over to a little something here because the rock the rock moves the rock a man followed them in the wilderness uh the rock was found in a tomb and it moved out of the tomb uh uh brother solomon mentioned and and uh i i'll show you all the picture did we did we get the picture okay let's just show the picture brother solomon mention this and i'll show this to you amen and he when i preached this couple weeks ago he he came and gave a a story and it says uh when um brother branham was out here i believe this is sunset mountain i believe and he's out there and his son joseph is on this rock in sunset mountain which is out in tucson i mean out near tucson and they're standing on this picture and um and brother branham makes a statement about this picture a prophet can only say things like this he said this in the message the unveiling of god oh think about the title the unveiling of god and it says this moses one time desired to see god and god had told him to stand on the rock he says and on the rock moses stood and he seen god passed by and his back looked like the back of a man god was in a whirlwind and moses standing on the rock look at this he says i guess you all seen the picture out there the other day what picture this picture he says i guess you all seen the picture out there the other day we stood by that same rock and here is that light the angel of the lord right there where it clapped standing is right on the bulletin board there now again brother branham say him and his son stood on the same rock the same rock that watered the children of israel the same rock that moses struck you gotta understand the rock moves [Applause] this is a supernatural rock and if the prophet and his son was standing rock guess where we're standing today we are standing on the same rock what rock is that the [Applause] [Music] i'll give you another it moved again i'll tell you another one let's go to 2nd kings chapter three and i'm gonna try to wind up right here i'm gonna try to wind up right here hey i thank god for this after i read second kings three my uh um the next quote gonna be making the valley full of ditches but second kings chapter three let's look at let's look at this amen starting at verse one um this is a supernatural rock their rock is not like our rock amen uh okay praise the lord second kings chapter three verse one it says this it says now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the 18th year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned 12 years so now let's just get these characters in our mind as we're going through so jay haram is the son of ahab who was the most wicked king that israel ever had uh and he's the son being raised up in a household like that it affected him right and uh so here joram his mother uh uh well it doesn't necessarily but we know his father's ahab jram the son of ahab began to reign over israel and samaria the 18th year of jehoshaphat king of judah so at this time the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah they're divided now they're the same people but they're divided amen um so here here here we see king of the king of judah which is jehoshaphat king of israel going to be jehoram okay uh joseph king of judah and reigned 12 years and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nabat which made israel to sin and depart and he departed not there from and misha king of moab was a sheep master and rendered them to the king of israel and hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with the wool and it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel i'm not giving you no more uh i'm stopping right here you know so uh here the scripture says and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel so he's getting ready to get his army established uh he's this guy's rebelled against him he's not paying uh what he used to pay to his father and he's like look i'm going to get what belonged to me right this is what jram is going to do so um verse 7 says and he went and sent to jehoshaphat now he didn't want to go by himself so he's going to the king of judah jehoshaphat he needs some help in the battle right he says he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the kingdom moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as our people and my horses as our horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom he's just happy to have jehoshaphat going with them amen and he says we're going to go through the way the wilderness of edom now i'm before i get there i just want to let you know as they're going the way through the wilderness edom this was really not a good route to go this was a route that would actually bring death to them hey you got to know where you're going this was a route that was actually going to bring death to the men right amen they just so happy that we got them going so so so here he says uh uh um verse 9 says so the king of israel went and and the king of judah so jehoram and jehoshaphat and the king of jews and the king of edom they got a third king to go with him and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them imagine going without water for seven days this was a death trap look at this so and the king of israel said alas that the lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but but jehoshaphat jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet i love the way this man thinks jehoshaphat even now he's on a seven-day journey with this king amen ain't got no water for him nor servants and you know and so so finally remembers he thinks about something he had to go back to is there not here a prophet look we don't need to try to lead ourselves and we don't have to lead ourselves if we would subject ourselves to a prophet look at this jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him and one of the kings of israel's servant's essence said here is elisha and elisha represent the bride here's elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him amen so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him now jehoshaphat is the one looking for and elisha said unto the king of israel uh and elijah said unto the king of israel now he's talking to jehoshapha i mean uh jehovah what have i to do with thee thee to the prophets of thy father because his daddy was worshiping baal amen give thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said to him nay for the lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee i had to stop there and just pause just for a second some people are blessed because you are there [Applause] your job is blessed because they have employed you [Music] [Applause] praise the lord amen if it had not been the presence of jehoshaphat jerome would have never even got a word from the prophet oh look at this hey i feel jesus in the place [Applause] elisha verse 14 elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely word not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstrel give me an anointed musician with a good attitude bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him hey now elisha could get into the spirit and begin to prophesy and it said thus said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches now they have not drank water in seven days and now he telling them to start working dig now i need you to understand the digger i mean the deeper you dig the greater your blessing [Music] the deeper the ditch the greater your oh blessing amen he says he says uh and he said thus the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the lord ye shall not see when neither shall you see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water glory that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and ye and you shall smite every city and every choice city and shall feel a fail every good tree and stop all wheels of water and and mar every good piece of land with stones now i'm gonna just stop right there oh i'm sorry i missed one verse verse 18. amen and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the raw bites also into your hand so god was gonna do two things i'm gonna fill the valley full of water if you just make some ditches in the valley here i'm gonna put water so all y'all can drink and then i'm also gonna deliver more bites into your hand gushers of blessings if i could just put it this way i know you got something you believe in god for but why don't you give god [Applause] because he don't want to just stop at one blessing and [Applause] [Music] make the valley full of ditches let me re-read this quote i had to read the script and then set you up for the quote then watch this they gonna get water no rain no wind but water yeah how's that supposed to happen a prophet tells us what happens thank you jesus you know someone told me not long ago said brother brandon music in the church is wrong i said it is do you think god changes in nature no i said then when the prophet got all stood up elisha was upset and jay horan i ain't got no respect for you your daddy your mama ain't got no respect for none of y'all and if you were standing here by yourself i wouldn't even say nothing to you you better be glad that your hosta fat is here you better be glad you're hostile fat's suffering because if johnson was suffering you'd be in trouble stood up watch it now watch it watch it then when the prophet got all stood up and said bring a minstrel and when the mystery began to play the hand of the lord came upon the prophet if music brought the power of god then what's y'all think sister nelly was feeling earlier it was the music it was the atmosphere if it broke the power of god then it's still bringing it today [Applause] when you go to what i mean don't just get to church when the preaching start get there during the song service you don't know what god will do for you he's trying to put you in an atmosphere so you can receive something from god amen the hand lord came upon the prophet and music brought the power of god then it will bring the power of god now that's just that's just exactly god still the same god see in the prophet now you might not be a prophet uh but you could be the minstrel or you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of god it says they started to pray and elisha got in the spirit and he saw a vision now he said when he saw a vision he said go out yonder in the desert right where you're at and go to digging ditches amen and dig them out for thus saith the lord you'll not hear any wind any rain but there'll be water that'll come from the way of the wilderness why where'd that water come from where'd that water come from didn't come from rain didn't come from when where'd that water come from from that rock where little rock moved again when they made the valley full of ditches amen the water came from the rock [Applause] the rock is even with you in your desert place [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's working really don't seem like he's broken he's working he never stops he never stops he never stops working [Music] where'd that water come from from that rock that's mid-rock that was in the wilderness amen that's right it was back there somewhere [Applause] it might have been covered up but there was a smitten rock in there that moses smote coming through the wilderness [Music] can you imagine that and that smitten rock still lays you on the two to be touched tonight the waters of life can you imagine that a man that the prophet don't even want to have anything to do with he's a he's a king that the prophet don't even want to say two words to but because he's in the company of another man that had the had the uh uh uh just had in his heart in his mind he said look we've been going through for seven days i i actually which way we was going you told us which way was going and we got out here and man ain't no water out here seven days and that means if we go seven days back we still won't find water that'll be 14 days of no water we can't live like that man you got me out here in the gym wow and he's starting to now he won't you want to blame god god gonna lead us out here and now we're gonna all die this ain't god's fault some of the things you're in ain't god's fault amen you put yourself in that situation [Applause] amen but here's here's the good part about it that when jehoshaphat had enough in him to say is it a prophet i don't want to hear nobody else just tell me what the prophet said is there a prophet around here they say elisha who used to serve under elijah okay go get him the word of the lord is with him and when he come out there and got the music the plan my the anointing struck in a vision struck the prophet i believe that the prophet saw not just the water he knew where the source of water was coming from that's why he could tell them say look it ain't gonna be no rain it ain't gonna be no wind but if you would just get your ditches dug you gonna find water in the ditch and the prophet knew that the rock was sitting right there it might have been covered up but that rock was not only sitting there it was still working [Applause] i'm here to tell you something about the rock the bible says the rock is the same yesterday today and forever because the rock is christ glory to god whatever we need just go to the rock turn to the heart and when you get to the rock don't just ask for water because the rock won't take your enemies out brother in this scripture even the enemies could testify that the rock was with him even moab could testify that the rock [Applause] please come eating their enemies [Applause] praise his holy name even your enemies [Applause] that devil think he got you pinned in that you pinned down all of a sudden a rock shows up out of nowhere maybe it was just coming over but it was always there just be obedient be obedient to what the prophet is telling you to do you'll get yours your substance your sustenance you get everything you need from the rock is not like our rock god richly bless you church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory to god hallelujah [Applause] [Music] y'all can come just give me just one minute i got enough time to just read this little last quote here for you now i'll turn it back over to brother solomon and man this is a message why amen going back to the scripture when they were trying to make it as sure as they could but they couldn't and i'll tell you what the devil been trying to make it as soon as he could for some of y'all but it came [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i ain't trusting in my job i ain't trusted in my doctor i ain't trusting my lawyer i'm trusting in my rock he only is my rock [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh the message why the prophet makes the statement here when god got ready to try out his toxin did you notice he never put it in a guinea pig he put it in himself your rock got to be willing to die for you any good doctor tries out his own medicine on himself first now god took it upon himself when god was made flesh and dwelt among us in the life of christ jesus being his son and god was in christ reconciling the world to himself he took the toxin upon himself when he was baptized by john on the river of jordan john bear record seeing seeing the spirit of god like a dove coming from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased it went into him the disciples in all wants him to see what he would do they watched his life to see how he would act to see what would take place we found him like there when he was under temptation the toxin hell when he was in the garden of gethsemane the toxin hell when he was spit on in his face the toxin hell when they nailed him to the cross the toxin hell it was good they found out it was good they sent they sing it would keep him when he died at the cross and they buried him in the ground on the third morning now what's going to take place there he is he's dead he's buried hid beneath the big rock where a century of men rolled it rolled uh rolled the stone over to hold him down now what's going to happen a guard stood at the door a hundred men watching him what's going to take place what's going to take place he prophesied through the word of god and said that on the third day he'd rise up again they made the guard sure now what about the toxin that easter morning about daybreak there coming angel down from heaven rolled away the stone and the toxin held in the time of death the toxin hell because it was god's word and i'm gonna tell you if you stand on the promise the toxins gonna hold again today amen god's promised that it was the toxin that he gave the bomb and gilead sure now we find out when he rose up on easter morning he appeared to many of them began to show that after the resurrection the toxin was still the same it did the same works it did before he died it's still hell there become 120 people interested in getting inoculated i wish all uh the world would become interested tonight and becoming inoculated because they see it held in the time of temptation it kept him from sinning it held him in temptation when he was riled upon he round not back it held him in death and when he died and went in the grave it held in the resurrection and come forth again i like that toxin don't you i think that's a good cure they did everything they could to make it as sure as they could but i thank god that our rock was not like their rock our rock get up out of a grave and that rock is still alive today whatever you need go to the rock god richly bless you church bless it be the name of the lord let's have a word of prayer father we come before your presence thank you lord jesus for the revelation of the word
