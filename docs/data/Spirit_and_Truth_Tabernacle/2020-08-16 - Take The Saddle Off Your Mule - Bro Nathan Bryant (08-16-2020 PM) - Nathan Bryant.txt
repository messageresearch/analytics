can't lose because the god that we serve is on our side amen can't can't lose amen you know some of the best victories uh that teams experiences is when they seem to be down and somehow some way they have enough resolve to keep pressing through whatever adversity they're facing and and it does not matter uh what the adversity is it does not matter how far down you were all that matters is at the end of the game you scored more points [Applause] and i just need to let the devil know at the end of this thing we gonna score more points in case he did not know we were predestinated to win hallelujah glory to god i just appreciate the lord jesus and uh i um i feel like somebody came to have church amen and earlier on last night we had the service for the young people and uh brother aaron did a wonderful job a man with spiritual gastronomics and we were uh just just really really blessed a wonderful anointing amen that came into the house of the lord and uh there has been an expectation that has been rising uh for these meetings and and i believe god has met and exceeded them thus far and has even some more and then this morning brother steven sodoquist came and just talked to us about it's just me how the devil tried to give you that lie amen and try to make you too humble or he'll make you too proud but you got to find a way to get in between uh because it's uh i think there's a statement that he um he made not uh i had it you're it's it says you are nothing and i underline that partner get gotta get a pause and give it a a a an effect you are nothing say that again you are nothing on your own [Music] [Applause] i like that so i had to underline that you are nothing on your own because actually we think we somebody but without god you're nothing you're nothing right i i believe they 84 cent that's all you worth is 84 cent right so we we thank god you know for for his word and just appreciate amen all that the lord has been speaking and i know uh the lord has a little bit more in store for us amen i wanted to just uh take time and man i want we sister robles is with us a man from dominican republic and always good to have her with us when she comes she represents brother robles and amen and and they they they they are they're a real blessing to me amen and uh just it was kind of a spur of the moment type trip uh that she took and and um you know just uh and and didn't realize that we were having this meeting this weekend uh but i knew that uh god had orchestrated amen uh certain things to occur and and uh and i know god is god is moving i know he's moving uh i i thank god for my brother nathan and thank god for all the brothers that he brought amen along with them brother stephen brother aaron brother jonathan brother furman a member of the luke we appreciate all them just getting in the van and coming on down and they had they had some tremendous trials to get here tremendous trials devil tried to wipe him out on the highway uh because the devil sometimes even the devil know the blessings that's about to come your way right so he gonna try to stop him before before they get there but uh but we thank god that god kept him on the highway and allowed them all to arrive here safely and just believing amen god has so much more uh brother ariel god bless you so good to have you with us a man from uh uh minnesota amen and i told y'all last week when he called me come for business business business brother area is here to do business amen [Music] so we thank god for him amen and so good to see all the daughters of the house a man shanice was here last night and i know amen um and uh she's back here again today so good to see you shanice and cecilia and all the daughters of the house so appreciate appreciate them amen shanice was when i first started out in ministry um we were i'll never forget we were something happened we ended up over at sister tina's house or something and and uh shanice she was a little young lady at the time and she walked up to me and i guess i one dress a man like the preacher dresses she walked up to me at the house and said are you the preacher at the church [Music] yes i'm the preacher at the church schnitzel i'm still here preaching [Laughter] praise alone but we thank god sister tabitha uh amen uh she put in a praise report saying god blessed me with a job this week so we thank god for blessing sister tabitha amen with a job and um god is just providing god is providing for his people proving that he's jehovah john you know uh here in this season of a pandemic many are losing jobs so when god blesses us in the midst of this it shows that god is already on the other side of this and he sees us already coming through so amen we thank god for that thank god for uh providing for us sister uh real quickly amen announcements i'll give you and uh and then we'll prepare for brother nathan to come uh i asked if brother ariel knew how to sing i know he played he played that bass and he played keyboard i don't know if y'all know that but brother ariel is is fire on the keyboard so i was asking him so do you sing too brother he's like no no no no say all right we'll let you out this time but we'll get you next time brother ariel uh but uh um just a few announcements before we get brother nathan on um wednesday night our uh live periscope and and um uh facebook uh we'll be doing our service streaming so keep that in mind uh no services for friday nights until further notice and then our sunday mornings will continue to be 9 00 a.m and 12 p.m as we have been doing so uh just keep that in mind those that are joining us online we thank you for joining us if you desire to give amen we want to let you know you do have the ability to give online through paypal or through cash app paypal just make sure you use the option give to a friend or family member and the email address that you would use for that is giving at john423.org giving at john423.org if you desire to give through cash app uh you can just use the cash symbol spirit and truth team that will reach the church and i did want to say thank you for those that are using these means amen in order to keep the church going we thank you for that we really appreciate your faithfulness and giving so those are two ways you can give online if you desire just a mail offering in you can do that to the addresses on the bottom of the screen just take a quick picture of the screen you have all the information if you want to give in the future those that are in the house of the lord you can give there is a wooden box on the table and as i mentioned this morning in service i think there's only two wooden boxes like that in the whole world uh one of those boxes is found in church of the open door uh sister christie made it a man uh there and we happened to be there one time i said man i like this box so she made us one and sent it down here so we have we have one of two this is a i mean a special box very special box and if you desire to put something in the box uh so um you can do that but i want to uh just uh have a word of prayer over our giving amen and then we will go forward in the service father we thank you for the opportunity that we can give thank you for providing us with work thank you for providing sister tabitha with a job and lord so many others that you have provided for and god as the needs of the church has met we pray that you meet the needs of your people bless abundantly father and god as uh each one just gives from their heart lord because of their love towards you i pray that you'd return it back 100 full it's in jesus name we pray amen amen 19 years ago i met brother nathan and um brother trevor i also met brother stephen at that time and uh and over the years we have developed a true genuine friendships and uh something that i've come to cherish and appreciate um and we've shared so much over the years and and then um just kind of watching us go through these different paths and into ministry together uh brother nathan when he started the church there and uh just all that the lord has done for him and and and not only you know with the church i used to used to come here and he'd come kind of just with him or just with his family we'd go from church to church just preaching you know wherever we could get an open door but this time was something different because he brought two preachers with them and uh and they preached and you know it's just been a real blessing and while they're preaching there's still some other preachers at home holding things down and i say lord that's all right that that that's fruit you know from from the ministry and i'm like glory to god you know so it just blesses my heart to see him and brother nathan has come many times and we realize it's not brother nathan but it's the god inside of our precious brother uh the lord uses his ministry he's prayed for many of people here um in our church we have seen the healing power of god right here in our midst so we can't doubt that god hears his prayer somebody might say well you know god hear my prayer yeah i don't doubt that i don't doubt that but some of the testimonies that he has shared some amen that we've seen with our own eyes uh and i think it's all the approach that's why people get certain results i remember when sister tanya had the uh um the cancer there that she was dealing with and and we was going to the meeting the doctor wanted to cut right away she said no i'm going to a meeting first and then after i get back from the meeting then y'all can do your surgery and uh when she said that she we went to the meeting and she said brother nathan prayed for me before i couldn't move my arm and now i'm able to move my arm i want him to pray for me again brother nathan wasn't preaching i was preaching and he said we'll do it you know uh after after the uh after the service and um we went through the whole weekend and then we got to the last service brother troy come to the office say my wife say she want to be prayed for yes tonight we'll make sure that happens brother nathan prayed for her that night and and um between the time of his prayer and the time of her going back to the doctor the cancer fell right off and we got the pictures of before and after we've seen god do this last year brother nathan came and prayed and there was a couple that was here to church from another church but they came in and they've been waiting and praying to have children uh for a number of years and uh seven years uh so uh the couple their husband asked the wife come let's just have them pray and they prayed right here in this spot and uh and now we got pictures of that baby that god blessed him with god heard the prayer right and uh so as we were amen we can give god praise for that he is certainly the same yesterday today and forever and and so i was just trying to in my heart just try to get how are we going to do this and the lord just kind of put in my spirit we're going to do a a a kind of a a little mix people here in the sanctuary you'll have an opportunity if you desire to come through the prayer line and be prayed for yourself if you have somebody else that you're standing in the gap for get them on your mind and just come and let the minister know who you want to be prayed for and we'll pray for them but we also have people that are not able to join us uh and they they submitted requests requests have come from all over the world amen the things that we shared on on social media now requests are coming from all over the world and we'll be sharing those requests praying over those requests as if the people were right here in the prayer line we believe god's gonna do miracles he's done it before he'll do it again we've got confidence in our god amen so i just want to amen welcome my friend my brother a man my uh cohort in the ministry i just welcomed him uh this morning or this afternoon a man to the pulpit and he asked me just y'all just remain seated because he just wants to kind of come in and just do it the way the lord leads him to do it today all right is that all right brother nathan bryant amen we welcome you this morning to the pulpit god bless [Applause] you [Music] amen you love the lord amen i'm actually not gonna sing i'm gonna try to save my voice but i might sing after if we have time but you know covert has made it hard on these musicians used to they could you know mount things to each other and it's hard enough to lip read without a mouth but without a mask but it's pretty hard to read lips with the mask on say what key was that what it's in g i still didn't so that makes it a little difficult on the musicians but thank you all god bless you i mean i've seen these musicians grow up they were a little bitty when we started coming and now they've grown up and my time flies doesn't it i wanted to share a few things with you before we got into the service and i didn't want to leave you standing we'll maybe stand here in a moment to read the scripture but you know it seems like the theme of this week before we even got to the services and then we got to the services and seemed like the theme of the services has been food is just every sermon has been you know integrated a little bit of food into it and and so i i heard some of the brothers that came with me amen and back there on some of the food things and and i guess coming to church is is kind of like that and we uh you know the type of services we've had this week is kind of like an all-you-can-eat buffet we've had a variety of different things if you have a preference of a certain style or color or or height or whatever it would be flavor we've had different things to offer so we're we're certainly enjoying the all you can eat buffet and you know some people it's interesting some some brothers that i think oh my they're just great somebody else might think no no they're that's not my favorite preacher and somebody that i might not drive five minutes to hear they say oh that brother he's he's deep or he's wonderful so we find that god's a god of variety and his people are a people of variety so we we eat different ways we we fill up different ways and but as long as you're eating i think that's the main thing i i heard one brother give a type a while back he said you know the thing is he said we're all eating pie and he said but it seems like the argument is who's serving the pie how big of pieces are we cutting what direction are we cutting and all those type of things so i'm just thankful to be eating pie this morning amen good to be in the house of the lord and brother jack i certainly appreciate my friend and brother 19 years doesn't seem like it can be that long i was 19 years old when i met him so it doesn't seem like another 19 is rolled around but i guess it has and many dangers toils and snares we have already come amen a lot of a lot of trials and different things that we faced and you know brother jack is one of those brothers if i talk to him every week or if i don't talk to him for six months we just pick right back up where we left off and it's always wonderful fellowship and i thought he was going to share all the testimonies i had to share before i got up here but he saved a few for me and uh sister tanya that picture i hope you don't mind i've shared it in finland and i've shared it in different states all around the nation and and it's certainly a faith builder and i have some photographs like that that i like to share to build faith and i was in finland a few years ago and we was having services there and had a prayer line before the prayer line i was preaching on the architect of our bodies which i think i actually preached here one time and and sharing some of the pictures of the things that god has done the sister came up in the prayer line and she had chronic uh ear pain for 23 years and thyroid problems for 24 years and began to pray for it and she's saying they told they told me before i got there they said now some of the finished people they're very shy and when you go to call a prayer line they probably uh you'll have to just pick somebody that you know is sick and get them to be the first one because nobody wants to be the first one in the prayer line that's just their their nature and personality and and so i started sharing these pictures picture after picture x-rays and of crooked backs turned straight and pictures of sister tanya's cancer before and after and different things like that and so when we called for the prayer line they lined up from the front to the back of the church and didn't have to coax anybody to come so when when god does it it's a different story isn't it praise the lord we certainly appreciate brother jack and and the testimonies that god has done here at the church i don't think i finished my testimony from finland i laid a prayer cloth on that lady that brother brandon prayed over and she said when when i laid that prayer cloth on her she began to feel just a hot sensation go up from her her throat around where the thyroid gland was all the way out through the top of her head and when it passed by her ear her ear pain was gone completely and she was completely healed so we still serve a god that's hebrews 13 8. he's still a healer and he's still a savior he's still moving in this age and and um you know there's there's friends and then there's just real real friends and brother jack is is one of my somebody asked you know who who's your best friend brother jack is one of my closest friends uh you know i've got a lot of good friends but he's one that has a been a very dear friend and he's been such an encouragement to me down through the years different things that i faced that he had kind of blazed the trail ahead and he would kind of tell me well brother this is this is what to expect and it's going to be like this and and i'd go a few days later and find out it's just like brother jack said and then we turned a corner and then we got to do some things and blaze a different trail that he hadn't blazed and i'd tell him brother jack this is what was going to be like and he'd say you were right so it's nice when somebody's been an encouragement to you to to try to be an encouragement to to them and i feel like when we come to spirit and truth tabernacle we go away you know we're supposed to be coming to encourage you but we go away in courage there was a brother that we went and before brother trevor and i were ministers uh we um or at least before we were very well known as ministers we i guess we were born ministers but even us it took us a while to figure that out and then took a lot of people a lot longer than it took us to figure it out but we we would go to a nursing home and and we would we would try to go there and encourage a brother that had parkinson's and he would just shake all the time and his muscles were tense and things from parkinson's and and we would go and try to encourage him on tuesdays brother stephen would go with us sometimes and my brother anthony and a couple other brothers that go to the church there now and and i didn't even hardly know how to play guitar at the time but we kind of learned how to play guitar using him as our as our demo i guess and i'd take the guitar and they'd say you know this song i'd say no kind of like brother fuhrman today he's saying a song he wrote that i'd never really played with him but but they say you know this song no but we'll try it and i'd figure it out and kind of learn how to play the guitar and practice it on him and and we would always go to try to encourage him but by the time we got out of there seeing that brother laying there in those conditions couldn't turn the page of his bible couldn't turn the page of a message book and so they'd have to clip a book on a little stand there on his food tray and he'd have to wait for a nurse or somebody to come in and when they came in or a visit or somebody say could you turn that page and clip it to the next page and just sit there and read those two pages until somebody could turn it i thought we think we have trials sometimes and he had such a positive attitude through it all and i would go away encouraged when we were trying to go and encourage him so that's how i feel when we come here sometimes you come to try to encourage somebody and go away encourage yourself so it's been very encouraging the services brother aaron and brother stephen and certainly appreciate all that the lord has spoke through them it touched my heart and encouraged me and brother jack had said that the nine o'clock service you know because you're up against the 12 o'clock service we're a little limited for time but he told me at the 12 o'clock service there's really no limit and so brother solomon the last three times i've been here he said brother you didn't go long enough so i'm going to try to go till brother solomon looks like he's had enough [Laughter] and say brother that one was too long find a happy medium somewhere but i was thinking as brother stephen was preaching there you know brother jack for years has had this acquire the fire meeting that you all have for the youth i can't remember is that usually in july or uh what time of year february i'm sorry so around i got my times mixed up that's a good time to have services in west palm beach you know he invites brother trevor all the time in january and february and he calls me and says brother can you come in july or august to florida when none of the other evangelists want to be in florida i said that's fine brother i'll come i'll come in july or august i'd be happy to be there and so they've been having this acquire the fire for many years and the lord's blessed it but i was thinking as brother stephen was preaching you're going to get on fire for something you'll get on fire for something and and you know i'd rather get on fire for god than anything but you know you see people and you watch them even as young people many times you can begin to identify a gift in their life and the potential and then you see many times i've seen brothers locally around around us and maybe a call of god on their life and you see them on linkedin and stuff like that and they're trying to be a motivational speaker and i think brother just yield to the gift that god's placed in your life and you see sisters and things god's placed certain gifts in their life and and instead of using it for him they begin to use it for other things so we're going to get on fire for something and you might be on fire for sports or you might be on a lot of people on fire for politics right now people our world is going crazy with politics and and with this health scare and different things and racial issues but i'm thankful to be preaching to the church where i look around i see white black hispanic different things amen that's how it should be amen amen i was reminded recently brother branham when he went there to arkansas i think brother jack and i were talking about it and he was actually i think referring to a different story there in arkansas but i think many times of when he was there and and you know the police was kind of getting him in and out of the crowds and there was a man standing over the side said parson parson you know have mercy and and he started to go to that man they said sir you can't go over there so that'll cause a race right he said but he told me to go amen so amen i'm not too interested in in race riots and all the all the scares with the pandemic and things like that i'm interested in the kingdom of god and the kingdom of god isn't made up of one color or one nation or one race of people but it's a many-membered body for many nations kindreds and tongues amen that's the that's the group that i want to be associated with you might want to be associated as a democrat or a republican or this group or that group or this movement or this protest or whatever i want to be associated with jesus christ amen because really that's the only one that i can really put my confidence in to fully support and pull it to fully throw in with and say i i support this there's other things you say well i support this and i'm for that you better go back and read what all that they support before you support it because many times they have ulterior agendas uh you know our president has done a lot of great things but he's done a lot of bad things too you know i don't i don't feel like you can get up that high in office without doing some things but uh but i thank god you know he's he's done a lot of good things he got the embassy back in israel back to jerusalem i thought that was wonderful that and he's for our veterans and things like that so i believe god allows who's supposed to be in there for the time but but i i politics isn't what's going to get us out of here amen the health care experts is not what's going to get us out of here but it's jesus christ amen i'm on the winning team i believe brother trevor is saying recently and then then i beat him at volleyball and i said no you're on the losing team brother [Laughter] but spiritually we are we're on the wedding team amen i want to share just you can go ahead well actually wait just a minute sister i want to share a testimony a couple testimonies with you before we go into the into the service i know some people said well i thought we was already in the service but this is just this is just getting me relaxed to share a few testimonies before we go into this service but there's a little boy uh little oliver beaver that his grandparents come to our church sometimes and and um he had had a cyst the size of a softball come up on his shoulder and we had they'd asked the grandparents to ask if i could pray over a handkerchief and send it back and so they did this and because we're having a a prayer line at the end of the service i thought i'd share a couple of testimonies with you and and so we prayed over the prayer cloth and they sent it back and they put it on him and i want to show you the before and after picture here of what little oliver looked like you can go ahead with that picture sister if we can get through it without technical difficulties it's not working i'm going to go ahead and take off my jacket while they're doing that then amen while they're trying to pull that up i'll go ahead and share a little bit of the second testimony my mother as many of you probably know a couple of months ago got diagnosed with stage four cancer breast cancer and it is spread not only from there but into the abdomen and the lungs and a spot on the back of her neck and different places in her lymph nodes and and the doctors didn't give a very good report of what their thoughts and expectations were of it and so we began to go to prayer and she began to take some medicines and things for it and she was also battling with afib and different things that the enemy tried to attack her body with but by the grace of god the lord has really begun to move on the scene for her the cancer that was on the back of her neck is completely gone the cancer in her lymph nodes is completely gone praise the lord the cancer in her abdomen is completely gone and the cancer in her lungs is basically gone there's just a few little strands that are already dying and i'll show you a picture if they if they get this work and i'll show you a picture of that as well the x-rays of her lungs but and then the the cancer that was uh in the breast has went down from what was i think about three centimeters now to about one centimeter so amen god is the healer the doctors are amazed that it's happened so fast but i'm i'm i'm i'm happy but i guess i'm not shocked is i am amazed i don't want to say that i'm not amazed but i'm not as shocked as they are because we've seen god move like that before and in fact my little boy philip when when the um when the news came and and we hadn't told anybody for a few days mom didn't want anybody but just us kids and and my dad and and and our spouses knowing and and so we hadn't told the grandchildren or anything before we announced it to the church i told them and my oldest son philip he said afterwards he said well i'm not surprised about mama and i said well why is that and he said well a few days ago that was on a saturday and he said on a thursday uh i thought i heard you calling from the office and so i was in my bedroom playing and he said i i walked down the hall to your office and i didn't see you in there and he said i looked around didn't see you anywhere so i began to walk down the hall and he said a voice a voice spoke to me and said dottie bryant has cancer but she's going to be healed and so i thought what a what a wonderful testimony and so i picked up the phone to try to call mom and tell her she was still in the hospital at the time and with covet and everything we couldn't get in to see her she was there by herself got this news in the hospital by herself and was there almost a week running tests and things and and so i picked up the phone to call her and they were right in the middle of doing some tests and things with her and so she couldn't talk she said i'll call you back in just a minute so i picked up the phone and called my dad began to tell him what the lord had spoken to philip's heart and this was still when when things were looking really bad for her and he had drove down through jeffersonville there and had pulled into a little place called duffy's landing and would begin to pray and in his prayer he said lord would you please just have brother nathan or brother joseph call me and just give me some word of encouragement about about dottie and about that time the phone rang i said you won't believe what philip just told me so god works on both ends of the line doesn't he and his timing is perfect brother if you can't get those pictures it's all it's all right is it not going to happen all right well let's just go ahead and stand together and read the scripture while they're doing that james chapter 2 there we go can you make it full screen you've got it on a slideshow or something where it's gonna automatically do it i think but james chapter 2 and verse 19. thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead faith without works is dead let's just bow our heads together this morning lord jesus lord as we come before your awesome presence i just pray that you would have preeminence in this service lord that you would take complete control of everything that's said and done lord that you would bless the people that are here those that are listening in those that'll go back and see it lord maybe they need encouragement lord maybe they need strength maybe they need healing for their bodies or their families or emotional scars that have been on their life due to hurts and different things like that that they face through life but whatever the need would be father i pray that that you would just move on the scene in a special way and lord may you just take complete control of my lips lord if there's anything that you would not have me to say then just stop my mouth or if there's things that need to be said lord let me say them no matter how difficult it would be i just pray that you would have preeminence in a special way in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you amen can you go back to the picture brother so that's the picture of little oliver you see the softball sized cyst on the top there picture and then perfectly normal on the bottom and this next picture is the before and after of of mom's lungs on the left hand side you'll see that uh it's just filled with cancer all these white little things flaring everywhere and on the right hand side those are almost completely gone so amen that's the god that we serve amen james telling us here that faith without works is dead and you know the sisters were with me one time in okeechobee and you learn a lot of things as you go along i've learned that if you drink gatorade drink a gatorade that's got a lid on it uh so you don't get a gnat in your gatorade and have it distract you and trying to get the net out while you're preaching the sister did an impersonation of me one time they were doing impersonations of brother trevor and they said he did this with the microphone you know and different brothers and they were doing impersonations and i said do an impersonation of me and they got a they got a cup and they was dipping their finger in it like that and i said what are you doing they said that nat in okeechobee that got in your gatorade and he was trying to dig it out of your gatorade so use a lid that's a tip for you minister brothers you know they're just starting out faith without works is dead so what james is telling us that if you have faith or you claim that you have faith and you don't have any works behind it then your works are dead and so i want to i want to speak this morning to you on on a subject take the saddle off your mule take the saddle off your mule and um brother brother luke or brother uh fuhrman were either you in the service back in january 2016 when i preached this brother fuhrman was were you brother stephen well it'll be a little different this morning but uh i preached this in january of 2016 at the home church and every time i've come to west palm beach since then which i think this is my third time i came in 2016 2000 uh well this might be my fourth time since then i think we skipped uh 2018 but we were here in 2016 17 18 and 20. so i've tried to preach this every time and just seems like the lord has led me a different direction but this time i began to look at what to what to preach and i was thinking something else and he led me to this so our ways is not his ways but he always does things perfectly so i want to read you a quote of where i got the title from this is from god's provided way of healing in 1954 brother brahma says now or i'm sorry this isn't the one where i got the title but we'll read this first now when you say you've got faith for divine healing and something strikes you and says move out that's the confirmation that god has received your faith for divine healing that's right when you got courage to put your faith in action but when you say you got faith and afraid to let it go your faith is dead see but when you've got faith and willing to let it go then god's confirming it with signs following and you'll see your healing that's true when you've got faith so you see somebody that says oh i've got faith brother nathan i've got faith to do this and faith to do that but they won't put it into action oh i've got faith brother god's going to send me a wife and scared to death to talk to a girl they don't have very much faith that they're going to get a wife oh i've got faith that god's sending us a baby but we're just gonna you know we're gonna uh we're gonna buy all kinds of collectibles and things and and leave the extra guest room for all those things and all of our hobbies and things like that if you really had faith that god was sending the baby you'd start making preparations for the baby room abraham said you know he went out there and and said give me some diapers and give me some baby clothes and give me some things like that because his faith was put in action because it was real faith and faith without works you say well i'm a christian well you ever go to church no i don't ever do that well i question whether you're really a christian or not now going to church doesn't make you a christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a ford truck but but going to church if you're a christian you will do that because there's something inside of you that wants to obey god's word and god's word said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together amen somebody said well i'm scared i'm afraid i'll get culvert i'm afraid i'll get this you know what i would rather get coveted than live in fear of it amen uh-oh i would rather get it than live my life in fear of it amen because god can deliver me of that a lot easier than he can deliver me of fear brother and said fear is one of the worst things that the devil can give you and we've seen not it's not just the world out here it's not just our nation but you see people in the message just bound up by fear over what's going on in our nation afraid to go outside afraid to do anything well you know if you've got some pre-existing health condition that you already maybe shouldn't go outside i understand that i understand you got to use caution but i don't know i remember a president said one time all the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and fear if you're not careful it will grip you fear will sneak up on you and grip you and it'll keep you away from believers it'll keep you away from the house of god it'll keep you away from everything because satan wants to isolate you satan wants to isolate you in your home and get you away from everybody else and brother madam said in thirsting for life he said that's the one that the devil really works on he said the wolves when they go after the pack of deer they don't attack the big herd when it's together but they find that one little one that gets off to the side away from everybody else and they begin to attack that and so we want to be careful we want to use wisdom i mean we washed our hands out here before we came in the people that are concerned you know maybe with pre-existing health things and things like that they're wearing masks there's no problem with that but we're here amen we're here and so if you don't want to wear a mask don't judge the ones that are wearing it if you're wearing one don't judge the ones that aren't you do what god's leading you to do brother jack runs his church differently than i do because he's dealing with a different group he's dealing with the different different pressures different spirits different things like that if you went to my church or maybe that you'd be in a completely different situation there where we're at geographically the different group of people we've got there a different mixed multitude but you got a mixed multitude here different i'm not just talking about race this morning don't get me wrong i'm talking about your spiritual walk you've got some that have been serving him 40 years some that have been serving him three years some that served him and backslidden are trying to come back and you've got all kinds of different varieties of people and so a pastor gets up here and if he preaches way up here all the time then the ones down here they'll never get fed and if he preaches way down here all the time the ones up here will say oh my goodness why doesn't brother jack ever preach anything but life story but there's a balance there somewhere where he gets in the middle of it and he knows his sheep and his sheep know his voice and he begins to feed the flock and this one up here says oh my i'm grabbing little nuggets from way up here and this one down here says oh i'm grabbing some from down here too why because it's an atmosphere that he knows the people that he's feeding and he's dealing with something so he has to lead them the way that god leads them if i just went online and said well this is what brother jack's preaching so that's what i'll preach my people would sit there and say why is he preaching this we don't even need this in our area amen that's why god calls a specific man to an area and anoints him for what you have need of and that anointing begins to draw people and they don't come and say oh i'm african-american so i'll go over to brother jack's church or i'm white so i'll go over to brother nathan's church but it goes beyond color and race and there's a seed down there on the inside that they say this man i don't care what his height is i don't care what his weight is i don't care what his color is i don't care what his nationality is he's feeding me something that is feeding my soul and that anointing begins to pull them in amen they sit there and say feed me brother jack i told you the thing brother brother troy is excited the theme this food me and brother mean brother troy the first time i met him we went to a ponderosa and me and brother troy tore it up he was telling brother jack don't tell my wife don't tell my wife i snuck him into waffle houses and all kinds of places when he was with us next time he brought his wife don't say nothing about those places i'm going to get him in trouble sure as anything he'll say you just wait till i get to new albany i'll pay you back for that brother brother branham tells the story and convinced and then concerned this is where i got the sermon titled he said in 1962 he said remember my father down in kentucky years ago the crops was all burning up and the old circuit preacher come through and he was a dandy old man and when he went on his knees he stayed there until something happened we need more people like that don't we i mean that shouldn't just be the pastor that shouldn't just be the deacons that shouldn't just be the sunday school teachers but we need people that'll stay on their knees till something happens amen i've got i think it's 20 something pages worth of prayer requests that we'll read here shortly and you know the people took the time to to write these out each prayer request and and brother jack said we're going to take the time to read them and and you know maybe you sit there and you think oh my here we are 13 prayer requests in and but yet if it was you that had a need if it was your mother or your child or it was you that was sick you would want somebody to take the time to say look i need somebody i need to get in touch with somebody that'll stay on their knees until god does something amen not just a little now i'll lay me down to sleep and a little jesus wept of devotions before we go to bed but i need to get in contact with somebody that doesn't just know the word they know the author amen they know where he lives they know his address they know his abode that he's not a million miles away somewhere but he stays right there with him amen i want to tell you he's on haverhill this morning amen he's not a million miles away he's not in some other church although he is there as well but he's right here present tense amen when brother steve began to sing after the end of the service i felt him come real close to me and i just had to slip away because i said god i don't want this anointing to leave me till i get up there amen i know he's here this morning amen i know where he is and that's we want to get a hold of somebody that knows where he's at and how to get a hold of him when there's times troubles that come the brothers have been with me this week and the text message after text message and phone call after phone call that will come in of people needing prayer why it's not because i'm anything amen it's not because i've done anything brother branham said it this way he said i've never seen i've never healed anybody but he said i have seen god do some wonderful answers to prayer amen that's my testimony this morning amen brother jack's never healed anybody i've never healed anybody but we've seen some phenomenal answers to prayer amen so we want somebody that'll stay there and pray till something happens he says that day they was all want to pray for the rain to come pop said when that old man went on his knees and he seen them old shriveled hands went up in the air he said oh god i've served you these people are yours and their crops are burning pop said he slipped right out of the church and went out there and took the saddle off his mule and throwed it under the church because he know the rain was a common convinced yes sir and then he was concerned about his saddle amen there was other people inside praying there was other people in there maybe maybe better christian than brother branham's dad was at the time he didn't serve the lord until way up in his last few moments of life and brother bam said he was a sinner and yet he prayed there with him as he was going into eternity and he received salvation but here's a man that he didn't know what we know he wasn't in church as many opportunities as we've had but but here the crops were burnt over and they was in a need and so the families gathered together said let's go up to the church and have the old circuit writer preacher we've heard god answer his prayers before let's let's have him go and and maybe he'd heard testimonies maybe brother branham's dad there had heard a testimony about a little sick baby with colic and with fever and the doctor said it was going to die unless god did something and and the circuit writer preacher happened to be writing right through about that time and they said get him to come pray for the baby and it'll all be all right and he went and laid his hands on the little baby and the next morning it was setting up perfectly normal eating and everything fine maybe there were some problems with finances and they didn't know how god was going to provide and they asked the old circuit writer preacher to come and the next morning everything just began to change and god began to come on the scene and he'd heard testimonies like this before he knew that god answered this man's prayer and so as he goes along now this this drought has come and the crops are dying this man gets out off of his old saddle and he walks into the church and he begins to pray and brother brahms dad sees him as soon as he begins to pray for prayer he said wait a minute wait a minute this isn't one of these guys that just talks it this is a guy that walks it amen this isn't just some guy that gets up and talks about what jesus did back there in history but this is a guy that he's actually proven that jesus has been raised up out of history and he slips out the side of the church and he begins to unstrap that saddle off of his mule and he takes it he throws it up underneath the church what was he doing he put his faith in action that it wasn't you know he didn't think oh how silly am i going to look if we come out in a few minutes and there's no rain and somebody's going to say hey buddy where's your saddle you right here bareback or what's going on you you ride a new new salomon mule or well he didn't care what anybody thought he had a lot of money in this saddle and he didn't want to get soaked so he goes over and he begins to untether the saddle maybe somebody came out and said what are you doing said i'm taking the saddle off my mirror oh you must be an oh holy roller no i'm not even serving the lord the way that i should be but i know that he answers prayer i've seen him move and answer prayer for this man and i'm convinced that god's going to do something and i'm concerned about my saddle he takes it off and he throws it up underneath the church and here comes the rain oh my why because he put his faith in action there were other people probably better christians than him inside praying weeping saying oh father thou thou now art and i and thee and thou and and trying to say the right words and ringing their hands together but he said i'm not worried about the words the words have done been spoken i'm gonna put it into action and take him at his word i know the rain's coming amen you ought to put your faith in action this morning i hope somebody will take the saddle off their mule you say i don't have a mule brother nathan oh yes you do yes you do you have a need this morning just like there was a need there and maybe there's something that you're holding back at all i couldn't give that to god or i couldn't do that somebody will make fun of me somebody will call me a holy roller put your faith in action one time take god at his word one time just go ahead and take the saddle off your mule this morning oh i couldn't give up this and i know god promised you oh my i know god promised if i'd pay my tithes he'd rain down the blessings that even even the heavens wouldn't be able to contain but but i got these other obligations and things oh i've seen god move on the scene hallelujah amen i've seen god bless amen can i share a testimony about myself this morning amen we were we had some needs at the church we'd moved into our new building brother jack came and dedicated the church and and the parking lot was just all crumbled down and eroded and we had spent every penny that we had saved and everything that everybody would loan us to try to make a down payment on the church and and but we had some needs there was this parking lot that they had big trucks and things to turn around in the parking lot and it just cracked it all to pieces and fallen all the pieces and and so i you know there was a need one time a a brother actually his brother donny reagan got up at a thanksgiving service and he said there it was hard for me to enjoy thanksgiving he said there were some people over in africa in a certain country that they were having droughts and things and he said due to the famine they've only been able to eat the adults have been eaten every other day once a meal and the children have been eaten once a day once a meal and pastors and things emailing him asking for help and he said there's 40 churches over there that we'd like to try to help and we're taking up an offering you're going to try to send 500 to each of them well 500 times 40 is 20 000 if i calculate with my homeschool math correctly so he took up an offering and i reached out to him and said did you get the amount you were looking for he said well we're a few thousand dollars short but we're close and so i sit down with everything in my mind i was going to write out a check for 500 and send it to this mission offering to help provide food and things for the people over there and when i sat down and wrote it out i looked and it said a thousand dollars and i thought i was going to write a 500 brother solomon but i wrote a thousand i said well maybe that was the lord so i sent it on on a monday morning i sent the check and on tuesday or excuse me on wednesday a sister came up to me and she said brother nathan said what should i pay tithes on i like questions like that what should i pay tithes on i said you pay tithes on your increase and she said well can you explain what that means to me i said well if you get your paycheck that's increase if you go out here and and somebody gives you something you turn around and sell it that's increased but if you if you go out here and you buy a car for eight thousand dollars and five years later it's depreciated and you put so many miles on it you turn around and sell it for five hundred dollars that's not increase you actually that devaluated so you don't owe ties on that and she said well that's that's what i thought but i just want to make sure she said my husband passed away he he left me some inheritance and some stocks and things and that company just merged with another company and they bought all my stocks out and i i need to pay tithes on it she handed me a check for ten thousand dollars i thought well praise the lord don't don't clap yet that's not the end of the testimony i'll tell you when it's the end of the testimony okay and so i took that ten thousand dollars i thought well lord you turned around and blessed me so quickly i'm gonna send another thousand dollars all right and so i took and i wrote another check i thought now this brother's in contact with certain brothers over there but there's probably other brothers that are in contact with others and so i sat down and i wrote out another check one thousand dollars sent it over there and and they sent it through another brother up in ohio that was working with another group of churches over there and i sent it on a tuesday and on wednesday a brother who hadn't ever paid tithes since he'd been coming to church he handed me an envelope and i opened it up and he paid me for this whole year of salary ten thousand dollars i said lord i can do this all year long i can do this all year long lord you just keep sending them and i'll keep on sinning so i wrote out another check for a thousand dollars and sent it through another group amen but that's where the testimony stops amen we had twenty thousand dollars to pay for our parking lots amen so sometimes there's something you've gotta do sometimes you've gotta step into i don't think that's not always just dollars and cents either you might be the best best tithe payer in the church but but maybe you won't put your shoulder to the wheel when something comes up that needs to be done or maybe you're scared to witness because you don't have the bible and the message memorized god didn't ask you to memorize all of the bible and all the message he said let your light so shine before man brother baby said if you can't tell them nothing else just tell them how the fire got lit just tell them how the fire got it say god did something for me you know there's some people they want to give both both gun barrels all at the same time tell them serpent seed and god had everything they're just standing there trying to shop at walmart saying i would i ran across a jehovah witness or something in there i'm not a jehovah witness but i am a witness of jehovah all right amen and so they want to give both gun barrels but you know just start off with something small just say oh my god's been so good to me and you can tell by their reaction if they're hungry or if they're an atheist pretty quickly if they want anything to do with that and just start off small and begin to tell them god has done so many good things for me oh you really god's well maybe they're like gideon standing there saying if god be god where are where be all the miracles and you can tell them hey i go to a church where a lady had a cancer fall off of her head amen i go to a church where people that walked in blind and had to be led into one service and the next service came in and found a seat for themselves that's the kind of church i go to amen where's it at spirit and truth tabernacle down here on haverhill all right amen amen welcome anytime you come anytime amen you can come as you are but if you really got a hunger for god down on the inside you probably won't stay as you are amen well glory amen we let people come as they are but after a while they've really got god down on the inside of them when god begins to come down on the inside there's something about it it just begins to overflow to the outside and the outside begins to change not because of a set of rules because but because they recognize that hey my bridegroom wants me to act a certain way and walk a certain way and dress a certain way and live a certain way and i want to do what's pleasing to my bridegroom hallelujah amen amen can you imagine well maybe you can't imagine i don't know i hope not some of you young sisters you get married and your husband comes in he says look there's just one thing from the time i was a little bitty boy all we ever had to eat was pinto beans he said just you can cook whatever you want but whatever you do don't don't bring me no pinto beans okay i am sick and tired of pinto beans and every service he came and here's your pinto beans honey you don't love that man if you love that man you would give him what he wanted all right brother amen oh don't get too happy brother just going to switch the other way too if you loved that sister you would try to do the things that made her happy that expressed your love to her but then we say oh i love jesus but there's just a few things in his word that i'm not willing i'm not willing to give up some things some of my personal preferences and things well then you probably probably don't really love him like you should maybe it's time you take the saddle off your mule and put it into action amen genesis chapter 6 verse 13 and god said unto noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch now can you imagine this man it's never rained before never rained one day before as far as science can tell there's nothing up in the atmosphere that can let it rain and he starts building a boat and now they did have water they did have lakes and seas and things god had come down and divided the lands from the seas but the the earth was watered with irrigation as it came up through underground fountains and things so they knew what a boat was but they didn't know what an ark was i mean that's where a lot of people so-called christians are in this age they know what a boat is they they know what a church is amen oh i go to one with 30 000 people and i can slip in unnoticed and live any kind of life i want and go out well you might know what a boat is but you don't know what an ark is amen an ark is a place of safety to get you through the oncoming storms that are coming an ark of safety to get you through oh my moses was in an ark of safety right out there in the nile there were plenty of other little baskets floating around probably but he was in the ark of safety so i pray tonight or this morning or this afternoon or whatever time of day it is that she'll get in the ark of safety amen it's not just a church address it's not just a doctrine it's not just a personality around the message or a theme or a group but it's jesus christ as the ark of safety amen so moses or moses didn't build it but noah he goes out there and he begins to build on this ark and he gets him some gopher wood and he goes out there and he begins to cut it down and one of his neighbors walked by brother son they said what are you building man you building a canoe no it's going to be a lot bigger than a canoe i know that's all it looks like right now but i've only been working on this a few days what kind of woods you use this is this is gopher wood are you kidding me man what is this really it's a boat actually it's going to be an arc it's going to be about this long about this wide and this high and we're going to have all kinds of room would you like to come be a part of it you are crazy you are crazy go for wood have you ever have you ever put gopher wood in anything and see it soak up water and go down to the bottom you're a nut i'm getting out of here anybody seen this holy roller over here building an ark with gopher wood right but it wasn't the finished product yet he still had some work to do and people would go about maybe people drove by brother jack's house you see uh you see our crazy neighbor over here he left a great big church in heaven church in his living room what a crazy guy but god was doing something that they couldn't see the finished product god was doing something maybe god was doing something with you when you left your home and your family and maybe moved from miles away to come to a little church in a storefront they said what are you nuts we've got a mega church right down the street but they didn't see the finished product of what god was trying to do they didn't see what god was trying to do and so noah goes out here no scientific proof no ability to understand he wasn't a boat builder but he goes out here and he starts carving away at this old gopher wood and my it would just sink as soon as anything but god told him when you get it done noah take it and pitch it within and pitch it without not just enough to be sanctified on the inside but got to sanctify the thing on the outside a little bit too and so he begins to go and he took the saddle off his mule as we would say and he took god at his word and put it into action now if he would have just had faith without works he would have said oh i believe god sent in the rain folks he that got up every sunday morning you all better be careful you all better stay prayed up you better go to this church right here because god is sin in the rain right but he would wait another year before he actually got his hammer and his saw and the wood and another year to go by you all better get ready you better get ready there's a reign of coming get on the ark well noah if you don't have faith enough to build the thing yourself how are we going to have faith to go anywhere and follow you see you know you got some of these people mentalities in politics and churches and pastors and husbands and homes and things they want to lead but from behind and let everybody else do it but i i can't follow a man like that but i can follow a man that'll go out there on the front lines and say follow me amen this is the way follow me and noah got out there and he began to work away why because he was putting his faith in action it was more than just talk amen so you can come to church all you want you can quote to your blue in the face you can quote your bible to somebody out here on the street and shake your fist and say god said this and god said that but if they don't see you put that faith in action to actually live the way that you're talking about why would they want what you've got take the saddle off your mule brother says in god's preparation 1954 if god come down in this building tonight and said it's going to rain tomorrow well if i went everywhere i'd take my umbrella it'd be easy for me to take my umbrella if the sun was shining ever so bright because i know it was going to rain and when god says anything he's going to do it and you can just depend if he says don't plant any crops this year there won't there won't be anything raised you'd never see me putting any seed in the ground because if he said because it'd be easy for me to believe that god said so and what god says it's easy for me to believe that he'll do it amen what if you feel that way this morning you ought to be the happiest person on the face of the earth that it's just easy for us to believe what god said when we go down through and we read god's word we look at something we say oh my goodness brother solomon did you ever see that right there oh my i you know i don't feel like i'm living up to that brother solomon but that i want to be identified with what his word says right there i believe it's his word i take him in his word i believe it because there's just something down on the inside of me even though i've been wrong many times i've never claimed that god's word was wrong amen even though i even though i i've come up short many times his word has never come up short and so there's something about it when you really believe god it's easy for you to take him at his word and say look i i believe i believe it i might not be able to explain it scientifically i may not be able to figure it all out intellectually but there's something down on the inside that i'm able to put my faith in action and say i believe i take god at his word if god said it's going to rain i'm not going out tomorrow leaving my umbrella at home because god said it's going to rain if god said it's going to rain i'm going to do this if god said he'd provide i'm not going to lay it in bed at night and worry every night oh god how will i provide tomorrow god what about my job what about this what about that you know i told the brothers on the way here even if the ceo of your company is against you and wants to fire you if god wants you to have that job there's nobody that god can change the ceo god can change the whole picture because when god opens a door no man can shut it and when god shuts the door no man can open it take him at his word this morning put your faith in action abraham when god came and spoke to him he was going to have a son he put his faith in action he began to make preparations and then years later this promised son that he'd waited for 25 years god said take him up on mount moriah there and kill him the son that i've waited for for 25 years most of us we waited nine months and that was long enough we thought when is this baby gonna get here and we acted like it was such a trial for us you know waiting nine months while our wife was trying to get through doors and walking around like this and and we said goodness that that pregnancy was rough that birth you know i was i was a nervous wreck he was a nervous wreck you didn't he was just walking up and down outside in the hallway all right but he waits for this son for 25 years and now god gives him the son he gets to be up about teenage years age and god god tells him take him up to mount moriah kill him and he goes and he gets the lad and he gets the the donkeys and he gets the wood for the offering and the sacrifice and he he begins on a journey tells his wife says i'll be back in a little bit and him and his son begin to go up the mountain as they get to the foot of the mountain he tells his servants he says you wait here you wait here with the donkeys and me and the lad we're gonna go yonder and worship and we're gonna come back to you we'll go yonder and worship and then we'll come back to you how are you going to do it abraham how are you going to do it god said that to sacrifice that son and even isaac begins to wonder he said daddy i i see the i see the donkeys here i see the the wood for the sacrifice but he says where where's the lamb and abraham tells him in in verse 8 of genesis chapter 22 he says my son god will provide himself a lamb i like the way he phrases this because he didn't say god will provide a lamb or god will provide you a lamb or god will provide me a lamb he by anointing he looks forward and by the anointing of what's coming down the road thousands of years later what's going to happen at the cross and this being a type of that he says god will provide himself a sacrifice god will provide himself as a lamb god will provide himself and he will come and be a lamb for us and so they go on further and and and god begins to see what abraham will do now god knew all along what abraham would do but he's trying to prove to abraham that there was something down in abraham that was more than abraham realized was down in there many times you know we get in a situation and god knew before the foundation of the world brother stephen just read a scripture a few moments ago he knew what your body would look like he knew what your thoughts would be he knew what your future is still going to be today god looked down through time and saw all that so god knew how that abraham would react to this trial but he was allowing this pressure to come so that abraham could know how that abraham would react to the trial because those moments of pressure we begin to realize you know what there was something down on the inside that was holding me even when i couldn't hold on any longer and when i couldn't go on any further there was somebody that picked me up and carried me through the trial and abraham begins to realize a little bit about himself this character is a victory remember hebrews chapter 11 verse 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that he had and he that he had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure he felt like you know what if god could give me this child when my own body was dead and couldn't produce a child and god could do all that then if god allows me to get to that point where i take his life then god's able to restore this son to me amen but god didn't let him get that far maybe there's some of you that maybe you ran maybe you tried to run from god and you thought oh my i can't i can't do this church stuff i can't i can't live this message life i can't walk this walk so i'll get out here and that thirst that was down on the inside of you for god you began to run further and further and further but there was a certain spot where god would get you and he'd say no i can't let you go any further i can't let you go any further than that and he'd begin to just reel you back in a little bit at a time and you'd run again saying oh god i can't do that and you'd get out to a certain spot and he'd stop me and say no i can't let you go that far amen and so god allows abraham to get to a certain point and the angel stops his hand says abram abraham said i i've proved you i just i wanted you to know that i mean more to you than anything he was willing to take the saddle off of his mule he was willing not to just sit around and talk about it at the dinner table but he was willing to put his faith into action there was a woman one time in the bible had a little boy god had given this child through the mouth of a prophet she hadn't had any children and he he told her that she would have a child and one day this little boy begins to get overheated and and he has a heat stroke and they take him in and and she takes him and she puts him in on on the prophet's bed which was a pretty good place to put him she recognized that that anointing followed the prophet that whatever he touched was blessed and she takes him in there and places him on on the bed of the prophet but that wasn't her faith wasn't just in the bed of the prophet she was wanting to hear him speak the word and so she begins to go and she said i'm going to go find the man of god and her husband began to discourage her he said it's neither new moon or sabbath and said you won't how will you know where to find him she said i'm going to go and i'm going to find him and instead of putting the saddle off of her mule she goes and puts a saddle on the mule in this case second kings chapter 4 verse 22 and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again and he said wherefore without go to him today it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well it shall be well now it's one thing to say it it's another thing to put it into action then she saddled an ass and said unto her servant drive and go forward slack not thy writing for me except i bid thee so she went and came into the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass that when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to hazel his servant behold yonder is the shunammite run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with the husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well come on now if you'd have been standing there you just thought here we i've drove you all this way i saddled this this mule for you and i i wrote you all this way you told me not to slow down for nothing and we get here and he asks you is everything okay with you oh everything's good everything okay with your husband we just left your husband back there about to have a nervous breakdown he's blaming himself because he let he let your son get out there and work too long and got overheated and he's sitting back there with guilt and shame and all kinds of emotions about to have a nervous breakdown and you said all is well your little babies back there laying on a bed dead as a doorknob and you said all is well she's putting her faith into action she's putting her faith in action she's saying i i didn't just believe god in the good times i didn't just believe god up on the mountaintop but even through the valley of the shadow of death even though he slay me yet will i trust him it is well oh my you know the rest of the story he goes in takes the child up and begins to lay on the bed there and the child is resurrected we recognize that he's still god he's still jehovah jireh he's still a god that's a provider amen let's skip over the quote in love love in 1956 brother brahm talks about when he goes to memphis there and he's he's going to he's his plane has been grounded due to weather and you know he's he's staying at a nice hotel that the airport put him up in there and he goes down to mail some letters and and he's looking through some windows and things they're doing a little window shopping and a voice tells him just keep walking just keep walking he starts walking he gets into a worse area town and a worse area town his voice keeps telling him just keep walking just keep walking doesn't matter what anybody thinks it doesn't matter what the devil is trying to tell you and put fear on you just keep walking and all of a sudden he walks along and he sees a lady standing there by a fence with a man's shirt tied around her head and she says good morning parson he said parson how did you know i was a parson and the quote she says she said i prayed for two days and this morning about three o'clock i was dreaming and i dreamed i was talking to the lord and i said lord where is your elisha she was like the shunammite woman god gave her a child but she said i was like that type of woman but where's your elisha and said i seen a man coming with a gray suit on with a little bitty semi-western hat he said that's the way i was dressed said he said just wait and said i walked right out here and been standing here ever since i knowed you were coming where is your elisha just wait and she didn't say okay go turn over and go back to sleep she walks out of her house and she walks down by the fence and she said this i saw him coming this way he was headed right down the street this way and she stood there and she waited five minutes went by she didn't say well i guess it was just a dream i i guess it was just those banana peppers i ate last night said no no god said so i know i'm like that cinnamon woman but god said he's sending his elisha so i'm going to stand here i'm taking the saddle up my mule i'm putting my faith into action and i'm going to stand here until i see the promise amen i knowed you as a coming oh my god's a good god isn't he i think that did you sing earlier my god shall supply no brother jack hasn't sang that yet maybe that'd be a good one for after service my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory that's more than just a song that's philippians chapter 4 verse 19. my god shall supply all your need he didn't say he'd provide all your want that's the problem with a lot of us we get out of church and we get busy and we stop praying and we stop reading our bible and we stop listening to the message and we stopped doing all these things because we get so busy because i got to get a bigger house than brother solomon i i got to get a bigger boat than brother stephen i don't know if brother stephen has a boat or not but i got to get a newer vehicle than this brother and i got to get a bigger this and bigger that so i'll start working overtime and the wife will start working overtime and and why because we're trying to feed our needs all the time but god didn't promise that he said i'll supply all your needs i'm a witness this afternoon he will supply all of your needs it may look impossible sometimes but he will supply all your needs but sometimes we're afraid to take the saddle off the mule we we want to do something ourselves i'll go out here and i'll work three jobs and i i won't be there for my kids because i i'll have babysitters and i'll have this and all that but but you know what we'll live in a in a five more square foot bigger house and we'll do this and we'll do that we'll drive a year newer vehicle and i won't be able to spend any time with my family or any time with god but we'll build we'll build bigger barns and tear them down and build bigger barns and there was a man like that in the bible go and read sometime how he turned out take some time for god take some time for your family amen i've never heard anybody's testimony on their deathbed say oh if i'd only work some more over time all right all right that's not the testimony oh god all those wasted years all those wasted hours all those wasted moments i could have been back there with my wife and my children spending time with them watching them grow up i could have been down there at the altar with them taking communion at the church we could have been spending time together but i was so busy writing my mule that i couldn't take the saddle off and put my faith in action and take god at his word that he would provide for me first kings chapter 17 verse 13 there had been a famine in the year no rain because the prophet of god had called for it not to reign because of the sin that had entered into the nation and elijah had been fed by ravens and been watered by the brook cedric there and god had provided for him at a time where it seemed like there was no provisions but now the brook begins to dry up and god tells him go into the the city here there's a woman that'll provide for you a widow woman and so elijah begins to walk down the road and he gets to a place where there's a woman gathering two sticks and to make a fire and brother bam said those two sticks represented the cross and and she's getting things together and he says look he said go and make me a cake and bring me a little a little bit of water and she said that's all i've got left sir and i'm getting ready to give that to my son and we're going to lay down and die he said well go and bring me some first what a request this is the last thing i've got this is my last hope that maybe if we can get through a few more hours maybe it'll rain enough to fill up a bucket out here to get some water this is my last hope and you're coming to rob me of the only hope i've got no no he's coming to give you hope amen it's those darkest of hours that's when jesus comes along amen brother jonathan was given his testimony the other day and he said it it got pretty dark the darkest of ours but then jesus came along that's when he comes along and elijah tells her fear not if there was ever a time to fear you'd think that was a time to fear eating our last meal and laying down to die i think i've got a right to have a little bit of fear he said fear not go and do that as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruce of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth now is this just some history like abraham lincoln or george washington that something way back there if you're serving a god like that i hope we can introduce you to a god that's been raised up out of history amen he is still the same god this morning for you the same god that could provide back there he's still the same god he came with us saith the lord god will provide for you well i'm not a prophet but i've got a book that says thus saith the lord i shall provide all of your needs and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and see in her house and he'd he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruce of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah she put her faith in action brother jack this was the last thing that she had but she had confidence in the word of god that thus saith the lord god will provide how's he going to provide i don't know how is he going to do it scientifically prove it to me we haven't had any rain there's not any food left in the granaries how's he going to provide i don't know but he can do it supernaturally amen she goes in there and she begins to pour out that oil and she she pours out almost that last little drop and sets it back and looks down there maybe just a few little drops left and she fills back up said how on earth did that happen and she goes in and scoops out that last little bit of meal and she looks in and there's still that same amount of meal and she scoops it again and there's more meal and she scoops it again there's one how did that happen because jehovah jireh is still a provider amen he didn't stop back in the days of abraham she could have looked at a historical god and said well he provided a ram for abraham but i'm not abraham it's just me amen borrowing from brother stephen now i'm not abraham i'm not brother branham i'm not one of some of these great i'm not a david or we don't want to be a goliath we're not a david or a jephthah or are some of these back there it's just me that's probably how david felt there when he got that sling out of his pocket all this army standing back here behind me the king my older brothers it's just me lord he said yeah but i equipped you with something i equipped you with something you just take the saddle off your mule and let me do the rest there's a man he was a missionary and he also had orphanages for children by the name of george mueller and god would provide supernaturally for them time and time again and i'm going to read you a quote from wikipedia this morning amen you can go read this he's got an autobiography that you can read this in or he's got a book i think called answers to prayers but i'm going to read it to you as i copied it out of wikipedia this man george mueller from the 1800s it says many times he received unsolicited food donations only hours before they were needed to feed the children further strengthening his faith in god for example on one well-documented occasion they gave thanks for breakfast when all the children were sitting at the table even though there was nothing to eat in the house nothing to eat in the house said george you're crazy ask the blessing over what the dust underneath the table ask the blessing there's nothing in the pantry there's nothing in the icebox there's nothing we're out of everything we don't have anything he said let's just sit down and ask the blessing he said i don't understand george said you've been pretty good to me so far but here i am a teenager and i know everything now and i don't understand how god's going to provide for us so you just sit down and hush a minute just calm down quiet down a little bit we're going to sit in and thank god for provisions we're going to bless the food that we're about to receive what food george there ain't no food i don't have no food but i have a promise that my god shall supply all thy need and we have a need this morning anybody got a need this morning maybe it's a financial need maybe it's a spiritual need maybe the devil's lied to you and said oh you'll never make it you'll never make it you've ran too far you've made too many mistakes your family history and all these things back here behind you look how far you ran look how far you stooped oh my this bible is full of men and women like that that ran to a place where they thought they'd ran too far and god said no my grace is sufficient my blood cleanseth men from all sin a double l i know a lot of message folks they have a spreadsheet and they've got this one big list of forgivable sins and all these other lists of unforgivable sins but there's only one unpardonable sin and it ain't divorced it ain't anything else that you can name except blaspheming the holy ghost blaspheming the holy ghost so the devil might whisper to you and say you've gone too far but you tell him he's a liar he said we've got a need this morning lord we've got needs represented here i've got little orphan kids here they're hungry they're thirsty we have a need but we just want to thank you in advance for the food that you're about to prepare for us we want to ask that you'd sanctify it for the good of our bodies george you've lost your mind george you're blessing food that's not there you're giving thanks for something that's well i preached wednesday night on praise him anyhow amen praise him in advance the man there that brother brahm talked about blind john ryan he said you go and you start saying thank god for healing me the man was still as blind as a bat but he said thank god for healing me and brother bam said your god will make your body obey your confession that you begin to testify and maybe the doctor says you're just as sick as you ever was maybe your family looks and says they're still just an old backslider or whatever but you keep that positive confession god can do it for me god can bring me through god can deliver me there was nothing in the house george says we just want to thank you we just want to thank you in advance lord how many like to thank him in advance lord we'd like to thank you in advance for these prayer requests that we're about to pray over lord we'd like to thank you in advance for the testimonies that are going to come forth from these meetings lord i'd like to thank you in advance for my backslidden family member that you're bringing back to calvary lord i'd like to give you thanks for that job that you're working on providing for me i'd like to thank you lord for that bill that you're going to pay off for me lord i don't know how it's all going to work out lord i'd like to thank you to advance for that spouse that you've predestinated for me to have that i've been single and i've been searching and maybe i've been looking in all the wrong places but lord i'm coming to you this morning i'm in your house this morning i need you to lead me and guide me and i'd like to thank you in advance for my husband for my wife for my children you go back and read the lineage of noah and you'll find out that noah was 600 years old when he began to build or when the flood came and god calls him at uh and at 500 years he has his first son if you look at the lineage so god tells him 120 years before the reign to build an ark for your children and their wives and your wife and you go back and look at the lineage and he didn't have any children yet brother didn't have any daughter-in-law's yet 20 years later he has his first son said oh my been a long time coming i can use some help on this ark we need to grow you up fast and then little baby brother comes along and another baby brother and they grow up and they begin to work on the ark and 120 years later but he worked 20 years before he ever had a child and god said build an ark for the saving of your your wife and your sons and your daughter-in-laws he said sons plural i ain't got son one but he starts building and he said i want to thank you in advance for this preparation i want to thank you in advance for this place where my family can go for safety i want to thank you in advance for my sons i want to thank you in advance for my daughter-in-laws i want to thank you in advance for what you're going to do for my children they gave thanks for breakfast and all the children sitting at the table even though there was nothing to eat in the house as they finished praying the baker knocked on the door with sufficient fresh bread to feed everyone and the milkman gave them plenty of fresh milk because his cart broke down in front of the orphanage can you imagine that that milkman said you got to be kidding me you got to be kidding me this is the worst day ever i just filled up this whole card i got deliveries to make i'm gonna oh sister jones down the road she's gonna be so mad if i'm five minutes late with her milk she's ready to just ring me out and cancel her subscription and here this whole thing breaks down i'll never be able to get this milk from point a to point b before it ruins but you know george's place is right here the old orphanage maybe they could use a little milk knocks on the door said george i know you've probably got plenty of things but i had a little milk accident out here he said thank you jesus thank you jesus he said my heart broke down and you're thanking jesus he said i was thanking jesus for your broke down cart before it got here i was thanking jesus for the milk before you put it in the bottle i was thanking god for the bread before the baker made it amen thank him in advance take the saddle off your mule this morning don't let the devil hold you back and say what about this and what about that god's way that's been made for us 1950 52 after through the services of this week trying to show people that there's no need of being scared the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear if you even had a cancer and didn't fear and believed god would heal you you wouldn't be in too bad of shape god take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that satan can place upon a person amen don't fear this morning you go back and you look in the scripture over and over and over fear not fear not fear not and the first thing we do a little trouble comes in and oh my god brother jack what are we going to do what are we going to do we're going to thank god in advance that's what we're going to do we're going to thank god in advance for bringing us through as a church as a family as individuals we're going to thank him in advance let me read you one more quote here before we go into the prayer line confirmation and evidence 1962. he said if he would appear here on the platform tonight and would say to me go to the presidential graveyard tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock call george washington from the dead i'd invite the whole world to come and watch it be done yes sir for i have faith in what has been told me because he never has he failed to confirm whatever he said to me so i have faith in it believing it that it's the truth because it's a built up affair amen this isn't something that that was just a made-up affair it was a built-up affair he had seen god in action before we've seen god heal cancer before so we can take him in his word it's a built-up affair he's built up our faith by experience that we've seen him in action before i believe he can restore families because i've seen him do it before i believe he can heal the sick because i've seen him do it before i believe he can provide for the house payment and

we're trusting in you this morning lord we're trusting in your provisions lord for this family lord may you begin to work a miracle for this situation may you bring stability and provision to this family lord lord you're the one that's brought them this far we believe that you're able to take them the rest of the way and provide lord we claim a miracle in the name of jesus christ may a

our kids up the right way lord jesus lord for this need [Music] lord so many broken lives that not by their choice but because of things that happened to him there's little children that they didn't have any control over satan comes and tries to upset and tear up homes but lord i pray that your holy spirit would go just now comfort this family in a way that only you can lord may they break this cycle of hurt and pain that has been caused to them in their childhood lord may the love of god just be expressed to them father lord may love be projected to them in a way that divine grace would manifest itself in their life they could recognize through whatever hurt or pain that they faced lord that you you're still there standing with outstretched arms saying i love you i care for you i chose you before the foundation of the world lord may you comfort them may you make them the right kind of parents to their children lord may they raise up a standard in their home to perfect to protect them from the type of hurts that they faced lord may you use them even through this hurt to be an encouragement lord maybe you'll use them to counsel others that have gone through similar traumas and hurts and lord only somebody that's gone through something like that can really be able to help somebody and and really encourage them and tell them what lord what it's like and what the future holds and what to expect and lord how to pray lord i pray that you would use them to help others that have been hurt as well lord i pray lord that you would just do something supernatural for this family and lord bring revelation lord this brother that's lord looking into the message and just wants revelation lord i pray lord may it not just be educated into him but may you bring
