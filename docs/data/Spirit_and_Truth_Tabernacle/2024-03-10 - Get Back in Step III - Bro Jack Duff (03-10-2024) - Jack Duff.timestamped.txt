[56:30] Step this has been our opening uh theme
[56:34] for this year with a
[56:37] underlying uh inspiration of I will
[56:41] restore saith the Lord Brother Troy told
[56:45] us who said
[56:47] it the Lord said it amen it ain't Joel's
[56:51] words these are God's words and uh you
[56:55] know when we Rec recognize that this is
[56:57] God speaking us and this is not simply a
[57:00] scripture uh that was for that day even
[57:06] when uh the the the the power of God
[57:10] came down on the day of Pentecost they
[57:12] needed to identify the
[57:15] experience and uh because people had no
[57:18] idea they'd never seen anything like
[57:20] this and you know brother quu hit this
[57:22] last week and and I want I want to tell
[57:24] you the restoration includes all
[57:27] that everything Pentecost
[57:31] had come on
[57:33] somebody I said everything Pentecost had
[57:37] belongs to
[57:41] us the tongues belong to us the
[57:45] interpretation of tongues belong to us
[57:48] right the gift of deser belong to
[57:53] us can I can I say another thing uh you
[57:57] know because with the prophet teaching
[57:59] us how to operate in these gifts we
[58:01] realize that the spirit of the Prophet
[58:04] is subject to the Prophet come on
[58:07] somebody so that mean we don't get our
[58:09] tongues out of
[58:10] order that's the truth right we know
[58:13] exactly where we're standing according
[58:14] to the word right amen so we don't get
[58:17] these things out of order but everything
[58:19] that was imp pented cost everything we
[58:21] read in the Bible it belongs to us glory
[58:24] to God I'm not afraid of that that amen
[58:27] I I know that many have preached it out
[58:29] of the church but I'm here to try to
[58:32] preach it right back into the church
[58:34] Hallelujah if it was in the Bible it
[58:36] belongs to us I know it got out of order
[58:39] but when the prophet set it back in
[58:41] order it belongs to
[58:44] us hallelujah church amen I'm not afraid
[58:48] of the gifts the gifts keep the church
[58:50] in order amen but but this restoration
[58:54] is bringing all that back here's the
[58:55] other thing that we want with a gift we
[58:57] want a
[58:58] life Sir with a
[59:01] gift you can't come in here speaking in
[59:04] tongues and then out there fussing
[59:05] everybody out we don't want
[59:08] that amen church amen after you leave
[59:12] here you got to live a life before the
[59:15] people come on somebody amen amen cuz
[59:19] cuz what happens is that when when your
[59:21] gift is questioned it just kind of puts
[59:25] everything you know people can't trust
[59:28] it right but but if it's a gift you got
[59:30] to learn how to Not Just Surrender your
[59:32] gift to God you got have to surrender
[59:34] your life to
[59:36] God Amen there's some things you can't
[59:39] post with a gift

[59:44] gift in your life hello somebody amen

[1:07:55] of drop a little bit off and we we want
[1:07:57] to there's so much more to unpack but
[1:08:00] they were just trying to get it all in
[1:08:01] 15 minutes and I I do say I appreciate
[1:08:04] the brothers doing exactly what was
[1:08:06] asked of them uh because that let you
[1:08:09] know they can be trusted in the Pulpit
[1:08:11] amen amen I remember one time going to a
[1:08:14] church and they said uh we're going to
[1:08:16] give you seven minutes to speak on this
[1:08:18] subject seven minutes now I could have
[1:08:20] said I ain't I can't even get a
[1:08:22] scripture out in s minutes I could have
[1:08:25] handled that way or I could have just
[1:08:26] said okay I'll get it out in seven
[1:08:29] minutes so I chose the okay I get out in
[1:08:31] I went up there and D D D D D D I was
[1:08:34] done in seven minutes sat down so
[1:08:37] everybody else come up there one person
[1:08:38] just my it looked like they did about 25
[1:08:40] minutes another one did about 15 minutes
[1:08:43] and everybody just going and they just
[1:08:44] had to try to prove how much they knew
[1:08:47] right and uh so after it was all done
[1:08:49] I'm sitting there and the pastor come up
[1:08:51] and say um you know I just want to say I
[1:08:56] appreciate this man right here he did
[1:08:59] exactly what we asked him to
[1:09:03] do so you know sometimes you got to
[1:09:06] learn and and and and I and not only
[1:09:08] learn but but you can get a lot in Amen
[1:09:12] in just 15 minutes and those brothers
[1:09:14] did that last week I'm telling you I I
[1:09:17] went back looking at like boy this
[1:09:19] church you know but I was just so
[1:09:21] blessed by it but I I'm I'm going to
[1:09:23] kind of keep going we going to keep
[1:09:25] packing some of these things because all
[1:09:27] you got were the highlights so now let's
[1:09:29] just kind of keep working with this a
[1:09:30] little bit all right we end this uh hour
[1:09:33] restore say the Lord
[1:09:35] joel4 the uh looking at my Bible uh
[1:09:39] commentary out of the message I'm sorry
[1:09:41] it's called illuminous software they
[1:09:43] said the theme of the first chapter of
[1:09:45] the prophecy in the Book of Joel the
[1:09:47] destruction caused by the Locust plague
[1:09:49] is introduced in this in these verse in
[1:09:51] this verse palmerworm Locust cankerworm
[1:09:53] caterpillar and they said the mean
[1:09:55] meaning of the four Hebrew words
[1:09:57] translated here is
[1:09:59] uncertain now a theologian and let me
[1:10:02] let me help you understand the reason
[1:10:03] people pick up um a theologian is that
[1:10:07] they they're trying to read the Bible
[1:10:09] it's not written in in our modern
[1:10:12] language today and people have a problem
[1:10:15] with it not being written our modern
[1:10:16] language so now they try to find Bibles
[1:10:18] that have our modern language but then
[1:10:20] they take all the meaning away let me
[1:10:22] help you understand something you don't
[1:10:24] need a new Bible
[1:10:26] amen you need the Holy Ghost the same
[1:10:30] holy ghost that wrote the word is able
[1:10:32] to teach you the word so don't change
[1:10:35] your KJV Bible to try to break it down
[1:10:38] don't do that amen amen right just let
[1:10:42] the same holy ghost that wrote it bring
[1:10:44] it back to you right so so so so so here
[1:10:47] they saying it's uncertain like in
[1:10:49] anytime you looking at scripture and if
[1:10:51] a God if somebody tell it's uncertain
[1:10:53] how can you put your weight on that
[1:10:55] there you can't put Faith in something
[1:10:57] that's uncertain you got to have a solid
[1:10:59] foundation so you know there's a couple
[1:11:01] things that um that uh I want to say
[1:11:04] here because that's that's Illumina that
[1:11:06] said that but this this I will restore
[1:11:09] sayth the Lord it has different meanings
[1:11:11] to different people uh I believe it's it
[1:11:15] it it could it could speak to your
[1:11:16] health it could speak to your family
[1:11:19] right that's right your spouse or
[1:11:21] children it can speak to your business
[1:11:25] that's it could speak to your income it
[1:11:28] could speak to a prios you have maybe
[1:11:31] you got a demotion and you w supposed to
[1:11:34] get that demotion but I will restore
[1:11:36] will bring your promotion back yes will
[1:11:39] brother right amen it speaks to healing
[1:11:43] in the Inner
[1:11:44] Man restoration is healing on the inside
[1:11:48] and then it's manifested on the
[1:11:51] outside Jeremiah 317 says for I'll
[1:11:54] restore Health unto thee Genesis 4 uh 40
[1:11:59] and13 the butler was restored to his
[1:12:02] position amen Second Kings uh chapter 8
[1:12:05] uh verse 4-6 this lady got her house
[1:12:08] back her land back everything she own
[1:12:11] before the famine she got it
[1:12:14] back oh Hallelujah maybe you've been
[1:12:16] going through a spiritual famine amen
[1:12:19] but God has been watching your
[1:12:20] faithfulness during the famine amen and
[1:12:24] God has promised to rest
[1:12:25] everything
[1:12:27] back hey job got it all back why can't
[1:12:31] you get it all back hey I want it all
[1:12:36] back come on
[1:12:39] somebody I want it all back I'm tired of
[1:12:43] the devil having it I want it all
[1:12:48] back restoration is promised to bring it
[1:12:51] all back to you right also the this this
[1:12:54] spiritual condition we found it in Amen
[1:12:56] in Psalm 51: 10-12 create in me a clean
[1:13:01] heart oh God and renew a right Spirit
[1:13:04] Within Me cast me not away from thy
[1:13:07] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:13:10] from me in verse 12 says restore unto me
[1:13:14] the joy of thy
[1:13:17] salvation see see that spiritual
[1:13:19] condition has to be restored you didn't
[1:13:21] lose your salvation you just lost your
[1:13:23] joy but God God is going to give you
[1:13:26] your joy
[1:13:28] back restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:13:31] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:13:34] spirit this this restoration means
[1:13:37] different things to different people
[1:13:39] based on where you are in your life also
[1:13:42] uh I have another little uh book that I
[1:13:45] that I that I that I that I got at the
[1:13:47] beginning of my Ministry amen I'll never
[1:13:50] forget uh got this from uh mother
[1:13:53] Dolly uh sister Michelle used to help
[1:13:56] her and and her husband was a a minister
[1:13:59] and you know he passed away and he had
[1:14:01] this little book in his house called key
[1:14:02] to the Bible and uh and and in that
[1:14:05] house they gave me this little key to
[1:14:07] the Bible and uh so a lot of times I'll
[1:14:09] take a word and I'll look it up in there
[1:14:11] and and this word restore had multiple
[1:14:14] definitions and one of them was to
[1:14:16] deliver back again oh my restore means
[1:14:19] to deliver back again and the scripture
[1:14:22] that they Ed to support that was Genesis
[1:14:24] 20 and7
[1:14:25] now what you need to understand about
[1:14:27] Genesis 20 and7 that was the inspiration
[1:14:30] that brother brandham used when he
[1:14:33] preach the restoration of the briad tree
[1:14:35] his inspiration was Genesis 20 and 7 now
[1:14:39] now before I read it before I read
[1:14:41] Genesis 27 this is why I say restoration
[1:14:44] is bringing your family
[1:14:47] back
[1:14:49] Hallelujah because in Genesis 20 and7
[1:14:52] amen before we got to verse 7 Abraham
[1:14:55] had lied to ailec and told him that
[1:14:59] Sarah was his sister come on somebody
[1:15:02] amen this man is lying and because he's
[1:15:05] afraid he's going to lose his life he
[1:15:06] say this woman is my sister and she's
[1:15:09] also
[1:15:10] lying can I can I tell you something
[1:15:12] this man was a prophet
[1:15:17] lying right and uh so so so when they uh
[1:15:21] uh AMC say well man he say that's his
[1:15:23] sister I've been looking for a wife God
[1:15:25] had already changed Sarah's body this is
[1:15:27] why the man at she he looking at a 90y
[1:15:30] old woman but he wants to take her for
[1:15:32] wife God had already turned her body
[1:15:34] back to being young right hallelujah
[1:15:37] amen and when he sees and say I've been
[1:15:38] looking for a wife I want this lady
[1:15:40] Sarah to be my wife Abraham willfully
[1:15:43] gives her up oh Jesus what a
[1:15:47] prophet but here you know uh while while
[1:15:51] while Abraham oh my is probably up at
[1:15:54] night wondering what have I just done
[1:15:57] and I don't know maybe Abraham repented
[1:15:59] Lord I'm so sorry and there's nothing I
[1:16:02] can do to get her back but God was
[1:16:04] watching over a promise that he had
[1:16:07] given Abraham he told Abraham Sarah thy
[1:16:11] wife will have a son and that promise
[1:16:14] that God made could not be broken so he
[1:16:17] could not allow aimc to touch Abraham's
[1:16:22] wife amen because it would have impacted
[1:16:24] the promise and if God has given you
[1:16:28] some
[1:16:30] promises there are some things that
[1:16:33] cannot happen to you God will block it
[1:16:37] God will stop it until his promise comes
[1:16:40] to pass in your
[1:16:44] [Music]
[1:16:49] life God made you a
[1:16:52] promise hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:56] hey maybe somebody trying to steal a
[1:16:58] contract from you maybe trying to
[1:17:01] undercut you but if God made you a
[1:17:05] promise there is nothing they can do I
[1:17:08] don't care how low they dropped the
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:15] price your customer is your
[1:17:19] customer my
[1:17:22] God so God God God God knew Abraham was
[1:17:26] helpless and this is why brother Brandon
[1:17:27] used the term regardless of the
[1:17:30] condition yes sir this restoration
[1:17:33] happens regardless of the
[1:17:35] condition I'm not looking at where you
[1:17:38] at I'm looking at where you going to
[1:17:40] be on the other side of is restoration
[1:17:43] regardless of the condition I'm trying
[1:17:45] to get somewhere
[1:17:49] today restoration happens so you know
[1:17:52] brother brand uh so brother brandom uses
[1:17:54] this scripture because here bimc has
[1:17:57] Sarah and he's like he's in even in
[1:18:00] nighttime prayer thanking God for giving
[1:18:03] him a new wife that he can have a
[1:18:08] baby and then God come to him and
[1:18:12] dream don't you touch that man's
[1:18:15] wife wife now wait wait even in this
[1:18:21] dream there's a conversation happening
[1:18:25] this man is talking with God God
[1:18:27] responding back to him in a
[1:18:32] dream don't you touch that man
[1:18:35] wife the man told me and she told me in
[1:18:38] the mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[1:18:40] every word be established they told me
[1:18:43] they was brothers and sisters
[1:18:46] mhm mm but don't touch that man's wife
[1:18:50] yeah if you do touch her I'mma kill you
[1:18:55] and everything around you going to die
[1:18:57] Lord I'm a righteous man why why you
[1:19:00] give that man back his wife and not only
[1:19:02] that he's my prophet and I want him to
[1:19:06] pray for
[1:19:09] you Genesis 27 now we can see
[1:19:14] it this is what God told him now
[1:19:17] therefore
[1:19:18] restore that's it oh come on somebody
[1:19:21] see I I I these are things I take
[1:19:23] personally yeah restore the man his
[1:19:28] wife for he is a
[1:19:30] prophet and he shall pray for thee amen
[1:19:34] and thou shalt live and if thou restore
[1:19:37] her not know thou that thou shalt surely
[1:19:40] die thou and all that are
[1:19:44] thine restoration includes our
[1:19:51] families restoration includes your
[1:19:53] health that's right
[1:19:55] restoration includes the gift in the
[1:19:59] church restoration includes your peace
[1:20:02] of
[1:20:04] mind oh restoration includes so much yes
[1:20:07] it does hallelujah another uh definition
[1:20:11] that they had gave here in uh key to the
[1:20:14] Bible said to make a return as for a
[1:20:17] theft discovered so like in Exodus 22 I
[1:20:20] won't read it there was laws for a thief
[1:20:22] if they stole something they had to give
[1:20:23] it back and sometime they had to give it
[1:20:24] back
[1:20:25] double come on
[1:20:27] somebody if the devil stole something
[1:20:30] from you make him give it
[1:20:39] back they they they said uh another that
[1:20:43] to reestablish as an office restore mean
[1:20:45] to reestablish as an office and they Ed
[1:20:47] Genesis 4013 where the Butler got
[1:20:49] reestablished to his office and here's
[1:20:52] another one that I want to read real
[1:20:53] quickly they said restore means to
[1:20:56] reclaim an airing
[1:21:04] Christian I want to camp there just for
[1:21:07] a little bit to
[1:21:10] reclaim to restore
[1:21:13] means to
[1:21:16] reclaim an airing
[1:21:20] Christian now here's the thing I need us
[1:21:22] to understand it understand here is
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:28] restoration is
[1:21:31] actually in
[1:21:36] you oh
[1:21:37] Lord you have the ability on to
[1:21:43] restore a a a a a a airing
[1:21:47] Christian we're going to read it in
[1:21:49] scripture in a second but but but you
[1:21:51] know before I go there the the song
[1:21:54] comes back to me that my mother wrote
[1:21:56] years
[1:21:57] ago save me from
[1:22:00] my airing way restore me to
[1:22:07] the now now now she didn't say restore
[1:22:10] me to a
[1:22:12] face I'm talking about years ago before
[1:22:16] we had all these issues she said restore
[1:22:19] me to the faith the faith that was once
[1:22:23] delivered to the Saints restore me to
[1:22:26] the faith I
[1:22:29] Pray song has gone all over been sung by
[1:22:32] many people it's just been a blessing
[1:22:34] and uh and I remember the last time I
[1:22:36] heard it
[1:22:39] song I was in Tucson
[1:22:44] Arizona me and brother Smiley were there
[1:22:47] preaching and um our wives went with

[1:24:37] spiritual you have a responsibility

[1:25:02] say say restore such a one in the spirit
[1:25:05] of meekness considering thyself which
[1:25:08] means I could be in the same position

[1:25:16] you try to help him get up when a woman
[1:25:19] is down you don't kick her you try to
[1:25:21] help her get up amen
[1:25:26] considering thyself lest thou also be

[1:26:04] communion and be a part of it we know

[1:35:13] she got out the car she was straight to
[1:35:16] the house of God she couldn't wait to
[1:35:18] get in here hallu right and I and I know
[1:35:21] that uh I got different Saints going
[1:35:22] through different things and they body
[1:35:23] and I I do understand that I'm not
[1:35:25] trying to uh say anything to you I I
[1:35:28] appreciate you all pressing I got
[1:35:29] mothers that are pressing their way out
[1:35:30] to the house of the Lord but I will say
[1:35:32] this you all be careful about a slothful
[1:35:37] spirit be careful don't allow a slothful
[1:35:40] spirit to get a hold of you because a
[1:35:43] SLO slothful spirit will not even make
[1:35:45] the
[1:35:49] Rapture to fight that now all right let
[1:35:52] me go on if a man man's in the Rong if a
[1:35:55] man's in the
[1:35:58] wrong go to him to be
[1:36:02] reconciled if you can't be
[1:36:04] reconciled take somebody with you he
[1:36:07] said no wonder God can't discipline his
[1:36:09] church cuz you're not doing it
[1:36:12] right instead of getting on the phone
[1:36:14] and talking about this one what taking
[1:36:17] place and little Cults and so forth
[1:36:20] around like that instead of doing that
[1:36:23] why don't you do what the Bible
[1:36:26] say if some brother some brother's been
[1:36:29] overtaken in a fault go to
[1:36:32] him all right and see if you can't get
[1:36:36] reconciled with him well now he did me
[1:36:40] see he start you know he did me this way
[1:36:43] I don't care what he did go to him
[1:36:46] anyhow it didn't say for him to come to
[1:36:49] you the Bible didn't say for him to come
[1:36:52] to you you go to him that's not what the
[1:36:54] Bible said the Bible said for you to go
[1:36:55] to him if he's wrong you go to him and
[1:36:58] then if he won't listen to you then take
[1:37:00] somebody with you as a witness and then
[1:37:03] if he won't see that witness then say
[1:37:05] now I'll
[1:37:07] take your pastor then you'll tell them
[1:37:10] say I'm going to tell it to the church
[1:37:12] and in 30 days from now if you if your
[1:37:14] brethren haven't made that up this
[1:37:16] brother here was willing to be
[1:37:18] reconciled you won't do it and if you
[1:37:20] won't make that up within 30 days then
[1:37:22] what's going to happen you're no more
[1:37:25] one of us now you talk about keeping the
[1:37:27] church
[1:37:29] clean sir you talk about keeping the
[1:37:32] church
[1:37:33] clean Petty
[1:37:36] differences that can hinder the Revival
[1:37:39] Petty differences that are hinder
[1:37:42] Restoration in a
[1:37:43] church Petty
[1:37:47] things we ain't strong enough I mean in
[1:37:49] our Christian walk we ain't strong
[1:37:51] enough to overcome some of this little
[1:37:53] stuff that we allow the devil to do they
[1:37:55] said this they did that they said and
[1:37:58] everybody no that's the devil making you
[1:38:00] feel like
[1:38:03] that and and when you get one of them
[1:38:05] Spirits soon as you see them in the
[1:38:07] store I'm dodging them don't take the
[1:38:09] phone calls don't respond to their text
[1:38:12] messages hello somebody they see you
[1:38:15] read the
[1:38:22] message God help us to keep this thing
[1:38:27] clean I'm going
[1:38:33] on they used another example here that I
[1:38:37] need to just kind of bring in out this
[1:38:39] definition out the key to the Bible one
[1:38:40] more says to recover the purity of
[1:38:44] divine worship by a reformation and I
[1:38:48] want to put I put restoration to to
[1:38:51] recover the purity of divine worship
[1:38:54] by a Reformation now when I looked in
[1:38:58] the key to the Bible the scripture that
[1:39:00] they use to support this
[1:39:02] definition was Matthew 17 ver
[1:39:07] 10
[1:39:12] AM they might be using scriptures and
[1:39:15] not really understand what it
[1:39:18] means I want to just drop something off
[1:39:21] here this morning this is
[1:39:24] um Mount
[1:39:26] Transfiguration the disciples have gone
[1:39:28] up and they've watched Jesus get
[1:39:29] transformed and they see Moses and
[1:39:31] Elijah come to Jesus and you know uh
[1:39:34] having a conversation with him and uh
[1:39:36] when the disciples see this uh they
[1:39:38] begin to you know ask certain
[1:39:41] questions and um they were like hey you
[1:39:44] know why is all this happening didn't
[1:39:46] didn't didn't this wasn't this supposed
[1:39:48] to happen before that happened and look
[1:39:50] at this they knew scripture his
[1:39:51] disciples asked him saying what why then
[1:39:53] say the scribes that
[1:39:56] Elias must first come now what they're
[1:39:59] saying here is that this is a a
[1:40:01] restoration or let me just put it this
[1:40:04] way a um a recover of the purity of
[1:40:07] divine worship recovering the purity of
[1:40:09] divine worship now they're reading there
[1:40:11] they they refer to the scripture in
[1:40:13] Matthew 17 Jesus answers in the next
[1:40:16] verse they ask about it but Jesus
[1:40:19] answer said unto them Elias truly
[1:40:24] shall first come and restore all things
[1:40:31] now according to them according to key
[1:40:33] of the Bible key in the Bible they're
[1:40:35] saying this is to recover the purity of
[1:40:39] divine worship amen Eliah Elias or the
[1:40:43] spirit of Elijah is coming to restore
[1:40:45] the purity of divine worship can I go a
[1:40:47] little further amen the spirit is coming
[1:40:50] to place Us in spirit and in truth amen
[1:40:54] amen cause our worship to be in spirit
[1:40:56] and in truth it restores the purity of
[1:40:58] divine worship now a little further amen
[1:41:00] the next verse says but I say unto you
[1:41:05] that Elias has come
[1:41:07] already and they knew him not but have
[1:41:09] done unto him whato they listed likewise
[1:41:11] also the son of man uh son of man
[1:41:14] suffered them now he goes on one more
[1:41:17] verse then the disciples understood that
[1:41:21] he spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:41:24] now I I like to just kind of again Camp
[1:41:27] here just for a little bit
[1:41:30] because
[1:41:32] um Jesus spoke of two different comings
[1:41:35] of Elijah in that one verse in this one
[1:41:38] one one one one one one section the
[1:41:41] first Was Elijah coming to restore all
[1:41:43] things and then he says I say unto you
[1:41:47] Elias has already come that was the
[1:41:50] ministry of John the Baptist when it
[1:41:51] said already come but the ministry of
[1:41:54] brother Brandon was when the the El that
[1:41:56] was going to come and restore all
[1:41:58] things oh help us Lord
[1:42:02] amen now let me let me I'm telling you
[1:42:04] what Jesus said now telling what Jesus
[1:42:07] said this message was something Jesus
[1:42:09] spoke about yes sir now let me go a
[1:42:12] little further let me go a little
[1:42:13] further I'm I'm I'm I'm coming oh my my
[1:42:16] my my my if
[1:42:18] somebody tells
[1:42:20] you that John the Baptist was the one
[1:42:24] fulfilling the restore all things the
[1:42:28] Holy Spirit told me to tell you ask them
[1:42:30] one
[1:42:34] question oh Lord I feel like running ask
[1:42:38] them one question and now before you
[1:42:40] know you already know the question to
[1:42:42] ask the ask that the question is what
[1:42:44] did he restore now the reason I'm
[1:42:47] telling you to ask them one question my
[1:42:50] God my God my God is because in order to
[1:42:53] defeat a devil you don't need a whole
[1:42:56] bunch of words you simply need one
[1:42:59] question rather than you tra chasing and
[1:43:02] trying to find answers for every
[1:43:05] question they got make them chase and
[1:43:08] answer your question I got one question
[1:43:11] with this scripture go pull that
[1:43:13] scripture back up uh Matthew 17 And1 I
[1:43:16] want to make sure the church got this
[1:43:20] 11 if they say John the Baptist this is
[1:43:23] the one fulfilling this part you must
[1:43:26] ask them what did he restore
[1:43:30] right now now now before we leave here
[1:43:34] today my answer is brother Brandon was
[1:43:37] the one that came to restore all things
[1:43:40] and you're going to ask me the question
[1:43:42] what's the question you're going to ask
[1:43:45] me I'm glad you ask the
[1:43:50] question amen yes sir yes sir yes sir
[1:43:54] yes sir but before I give you an
[1:43:57] answer I want to give you a
[1:44:01] strategy because
[1:44:03] Jesus used the same strategy hello when
[1:44:07] they came against him in his day can we
[1:44:10] just read a
[1:44:11] scripture Matthew
[1:44:13] 21 verse 23 Lord Jesus help us Matthew
[1:44:19] 21:23 this this this this one question
[1:44:24] strategy yes sir here it says and when
[1:44:28] he was coming to the temple the chief
[1:44:31] priest and the Elders of the people came
[1:44:35] unto him as he was teaching and said by
[1:44:40] what
[1:44:41] Authority doest thou these things and
[1:44:45] who gave thee this Authority now the
[1:44:47] reason they asking this to Jesus cuz you
[1:44:49] know wait a minute even at the age of 12
[1:44:51] this man is stand Jesus is in the temple
[1:44:53] teaching the leaders of that day what
[1:44:55] the scripture is saying now they want to
[1:44:57] know what school did this man go to I
[1:44:59] mean he's not a part of the denomination
[1:45:01] of the Pharisees or denomination of the
[1:45:03] Sadducees he's not a part of any of
[1:45:05] these sex any of these groups where did
[1:45:07] this man get this authority to teach
[1:45:10] scripture they want to
[1:45:13] know go
[1:45:16] on verse
[1:45:18] 24 and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:45:23] I also will ask you how many how many
[1:45:26] things how many how what's this this
[1:45:29] strategy that Jesus I'm only going to
[1:45:31] ask you one question I also will ask you
[1:45:34] one thing which if you tell me if you
[1:45:38] give me an answer I and likewise will
[1:45:41] tell you by what Authority I do these
[1:45:44] things Jesus say I got the answer that
[1:45:46] you're looking for but I need you to
[1:45:48] give me an answer
[1:45:50] first yes sir
[1:45:54] next the baptism of
[1:45:59] John whence was it from heaven or of
[1:46:05] men and they reason within themselves
[1:46:08] saying if we shall say from Heaven he
[1:46:10] was saying to us why did ye not then
[1:46:13] believe him right go on to the next one
[1:46:17] but if we should say of Men We Fear the
[1:46:20] people for all hold John as a prophet
[1:46:23] next verse next verse and they answered
[1:46:26] Jesus said we cannot tell well since you
[1:46:31] have no
[1:46:34] answer then also I have no
[1:46:38] answer and he sent him neither tell I
[1:46:41] you by what Authority I do these things
[1:46:43] go back to verse 25 for me please I need
[1:46:45] you to understand
[1:46:51] something
[1:46:55] they asked Jesus by what Authority you
[1:46:57] do these
[1:46:58] things see I got a question for
[1:47:02] you the baptism of
[1:47:05] John whence was it from heaven or or
[1:47:07] from Men In other words Jesus was
[1:47:11] forcing
[1:47:13] them to
[1:47:16] identify who the messenger
[1:47:21] was
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:25] today if there's a question on who's
[1:47:28] doing the
[1:47:29] restoration we need you to
[1:47:33] identify who the messenger
[1:47:37] is cuz Jesus said Elias was coming to
[1:47:42] restore all things right and if we can't
[1:47:47] if we can't agree on John the Baptist
[1:47:49] amen cuz I'm going tell you right now I
[1:47:50] know John the Baptist didn't restore
[1:47:52] nothing
[1:47:54] right his baptism didn't even
[1:47:57] last his baptism didn't last they
[1:48:00] changed it in Acts 19 they asked him how
[1:48:02] you that baptized unto John's baptism
[1:48:04] that ain't good enough Christ has
[1:48:06] already come and gone you got need to be
[1:48:08] you need to repent and be baptized in
[1:48:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:48:13] the remission of your sins so his
[1:48:15] baptism was not restored right so you
[1:48:18] ask me the question well you brother
[1:48:20] Jack is if it's not John the Baptist who
[1:48:22] you say it is I'm telling you it's
[1:48:25] William Mar and brandom is the
[1:48:26] Fulfillment of the scripture and Jesus
[1:48:29] said uh Elias that was coming to restore
[1:48:31] all things I say brother Brandon was the
[1:48:33] Fulfillment of scripture so now if if
[1:48:35] I'm going to say that if I'm if I'm
[1:48:38] going to say brother Brandon was a
[1:48:39] fulfill you should have a question for
[1:48:41] me what's your what's the
[1:48:47] question y'all ain't got no question I'm
[1:48:50] a I'm I need the whole church to give me
[1:48:51] this question on account three I want to
[1:48:53] hear the question one 2
[1:49:03] 3 I'm so glad you asked me the
[1:49:11] question I want to read the answer to
[1:49:15] the question out of the message it's in
[1:49:18] the the sermon serves is this the
[1:49:20] time but before I can read it I need to
[1:49:24] go to another
[1:49:28] scripture I want you to go with me to
[1:49:31] Matthew
[1:49:45] 13 this is just I was trying to just not
[1:49:48] read as much of this ver of this chapter
[1:49:51] but it's hard for me not to
[1:49:54] I'mma I I tell you this is my promise to
[1:49:56] you I'mma read this and then I'mma read
[1:49:59] you the things that brother Brandon
[1:50:01] restored and then I'm I'mma leave you
[1:50:03] alone today
[1:50:07] okay Matthew 13 now the reason I'm
[1:50:11] reading
[1:50:12] this is because some of you all may not
[1:50:15] have this but there is a uh what do we
[1:50:17] call the Scofield bible it's the King
[1:50:19] James version but Dr Scofield kind of
[1:50:22] wrote notes uh all through that Bible
[1:50:25] and just different things that he was
[1:50:26] looking at he looked at this Matthew 13
[1:50:31] and uh and then he listed a whole bunch
[1:50:32] of mysteries that he saw that needed to
[1:50:36] be addressed by
[1:50:38] somebody Dr scoffield was what they call
[1:50:41] a dispensationalist which means he
[1:50:42] believed in seven different
[1:50:44] dispensations that God would deal with
[1:50:45] man also Scofield used the term ages
[1:50:51] because there's different people that
[1:50:52] say say ain't no seven Church ages
[1:50:55] there's ones out there ain't no seven
[1:50:56] Church ages but scoffield was using that
[1:50:58] term and always saying is that there was
[1:51:01] different time periods that God did
[1:51:03] certain things and he used a different
[1:51:04] man at that time in order to keep the
[1:51:06] people on the word that's all the age
[1:51:08] was and we can see seven churches
[1:51:11] represented seven Church ages in the
[1:51:13] Book of Revelation very simple very
[1:51:15] simple look at this now let's read this
[1:51:17] let's read I can I'm going to give you
[1:51:20] Scofield's notes in a little bit because
[1:51:21] brother Brandon referred to him but
[1:51:23] let's read the the the scripture first
[1:51:24] look at this verse one the same day went
[1:51:28] Jesus out of the house and sat by the
[1:51:30] seaside and great multitudes were
[1:51:32] gathered together to him so that he went
[1:51:34] into a ship and sat and the whole
[1:51:36] multitude stood on the
[1:51:38] shore and spake many things unto them in
[1:51:41] Parable saying
[1:51:43] right Behold a s went forth to
[1:51:48] seow and when he slded some seeds fell
[1:51:50] by the wayside and the fouls came and
[1:51:52] devouted them up now this scripture that
[1:51:54] we're looking at is a scripture that
[1:51:57] is constantly being
[1:52:00] repeated even today this scripture is
[1:52:02] being
[1:52:03] repeated a SE comes forth the SE seeds
[1:52:06] here I am sewing seed what is a seed the
[1:52:08] word of God I'm sowing seed right here
[1:52:10] in the congregation but when when when
[1:52:12] when when we leave church the enemy
[1:52:14] going to attack the seeds that have been
[1:52:16] sown and all y'all represent this
[1:52:19] different ground that we getting ready
[1:52:20] to read look at look at it now
[1:52:23] some fell by the some seed and when when
[1:52:26] he s some seeds fell by the wayside and
[1:52:28] the fowls came and devouted them up some
[1:52:31] fell upon Stony places where they had
[1:52:34] not much Earth and forth with they
[1:52:36] sprung up because they had no deepness
[1:52:39] of Earth and when the sun was up they
[1:52:42] were scorched and because they had had
[1:52:45] no root they with it away I I like to
[1:52:47] call these mushroom
[1:52:50] Christians mushrooms just come up over
[1:52:52] night and be kicked over the next day
[1:52:54] but oak tree Christians you ain't going
[1:52:57] to take them out too fast you got to get
[1:53:00] all your tools
[1:53:04] out glory to God right and uh verse
[1:53:07] verse verse verse uh verse six and when
[1:53:09] the sun was up they were scorched and
[1:53:10] because they had no root they withered
[1:53:12] away verse 7even and some fell among
[1:53:14] thorns and the Thorns sprung up and
[1:53:16] choked them but other fell into good
[1:53:19] ground and brought forth fruits some
[1:53:20] 100-fold some 60-fold some 3F who have
[1:53:24] ears to hear Let Them
[1:53:26] hear and that's all Jesus said he
[1:53:28] preached the sermon people sitting on
[1:53:30] the shore listening to that and it's a
[1:53:32] parable that he's giv them now look at
[1:53:34] what happens in the next verse and the
[1:53:35] disciples
[1:53:38] came said unto him why speakest thou
[1:53:42] unto them in Parables what what I'm
[1:53:43] gathering from this is the service was
[1:53:46] over Jesus already spoke this Parable
[1:53:49] but he never gave any explanation right
[1:53:52] uh let me just stop and pause there the
[1:53:54] explanation only came
[1:54:01] privately the explanation came priv it
[1:54:03] wasn't a public
[1:54:06] explanation there I remember a brother
[1:54:08] asked me one time he said he say this
[1:54:10] message is so good I really enjoy it all
[1:54:12] you know the things I'm hearing why is
[1:54:13] this not on
[1:54:14] TBN TBN don't want
[1:54:17] this you evidently you ain't heard what
[1:54:19] we've been preaching TBN don't want this
[1:54:22] have you looked at
[1:54:25] TBN they don't want
[1:54:28] this nobody want the truth like that
[1:54:31] nobody if it's going to cause you to
[1:54:32] change your lifestyle uhuh they don't
[1:54:34] want
[1:54:36] that no I got to live holy yes you got
[1:54:39] to live holy sir amen right but look at
[1:54:43] this he said the disciples came and said
[1:54:44] unto him why speakest thou unto them in
[1:54:47] Parables he answered and said unto them
[1:54:49] because it is
[1:54:51] given
[1:54:55] yeah it's not given to them it is given
[1:55:01] unto ohoo Jesus Hallelujah I just I mean
[1:55:06] he can he he can just put my name in you
[1:55:11] I feel like he talking directly to me it
[1:55:13] is given unto Jack Duff to know the
[1:55:17] mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven yes
[1:55:19] sir but unto them thank you Lord
[1:55:25] now I can't get mad at them for not
[1:55:27] seeing what I
[1:55:29] see it's just not
[1:55:34] given I'm sorry you can't see what I see
[1:55:38] but because of what I see I can't change
[1:55:43] amen thank let me go a little further
[1:55:46] please I I I I just I love the word of
[1:55:50] God verse 12 says for
[1:55:54] whosoever hath to him shall be given he
[1:55:59] shall have more abundance but whosoever
[1:56:02] hath not from him shall be taken away
[1:56:05] even that he hath Lord therefore speak I
[1:56:09] to them in Parables because they
[1:56:12] seeing see not and hearing they hear not
[1:56:18] neither do they understand which means
[1:56:20] they just don't have a revelation M and
[1:56:23] in them and in them is fulfilled the
[1:56:26] prophecy of Isaiah Isaiah's Isaiah which
[1:56:30] says by hearing ye shall hear and shall
[1:56:33] not understand and seeing ye shall see
[1:56:35] and shall not perceive so Jesus did this
[1:56:38] intentionally gave them Parables that
[1:56:41] they would not understand in order to
[1:56:42] fulfill scripture
[1:56:44] sir yes sir let me go on for this
[1:56:48] people's heart is waxed gross and their
[1:56:51] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[1:56:54] they have closed lest at any time they
[1:56:56] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:56:57] their ears and should understand with
[1:56:59] their heart and should be converted and
[1:57:01] I should heal them but
[1:57:05] blessed are your
[1:57:09] eyes you know you want to know why your
[1:57:11] eyes are blessed you want to know why
[1:57:13] your eyes are
[1:57:17] blessed because they see all right
[1:57:21] Hallelujah now now that that can be
[1:57:23] taken
[1:57:25] naturally but the greater part is
[1:57:28] spiritually sir you're blessed because
[1:57:31] you can see and you and you going to
[1:57:33] come in here and not praise
[1:57:35] God can you
[1:57:37] see you got something to praise him
[1:57:40] for can you hear you got something to
[1:57:44] praise him
[1:57:46] for and I'm talking about seeing
[1:57:48] spiritually and hearing
[1:57:51] spiritually
[1:57:53] amen blessed are your
[1:57:57] eyes for they
[1:57:59] see and your ears for they
[1:58:03] hear for verily I say unto you that many
[1:58:07] prophets I don't know if we get it there
[1:58:10] are things that prophets wanted to
[1:58:13] understand in scripture a prophet
[1:58:16] couldn't even get it but God is giv it
[1:58:18] to
[1:58:20] you and then put you on the foundation
[1:58:23] of the Apostles and
[1:58:24] Prophets look at
[1:58:27] this for verily I say unto you that many
[1:58:30] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:58:31] to see those things which ye see and
[1:58:34] have not seen them and to hear those
[1:58:37] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:58:39] them hear ye therefore the parable of
[1:58:42] the sword now this is what Jesus does
[1:58:45] privately after the church was over the
[1:58:48] congregation had been dismissed all they
[1:58:50] heard was Parables they walked away
[1:58:52] trying to figure out what the Parables
[1:58:53] were even the disciples trying to
[1:58:55] understand what is The Parables and they
[1:58:57] approached them why are you speaking to
[1:58:59] them in Parables it's because I'm
[1:59:00] fulfilling the
[1:59:01] word but since you here fellas I got
[1:59:05] something to tell
[1:59:07] you privately I want to share some
[1:59:09] things with you and do you realize even
[1:59:12] in this group of 12 or even if it was 70
[1:59:16] I don't know how many was at that time
[1:59:18] but if it was 12 or even if it was the
[1:59:19] other 70 that that he he ordained if all
[1:59:21] of together even in that group seeds was
[1:59:24] still being sown on different
[1:59:27] grounds Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory watch
[1:59:32] this now cuz see you need to you need to
[1:59:34] figure out what ground are
[1:59:37] you which ground are you now watch this
[1:59:41] here it is verse verse
[1:59:44] 19 when anyone Hearth the word of the
[1:59:48] kingdom and understandeth it
[1:59:51] not then cometh the wicked one and
[1:59:54] catcheth away that which was sown in his
[1:59:56] heart this is he which receives seed by
[1:59:59] the wayside so they hear it but they
[2:00:02] don't understand now if you hear and you
[2:00:05] don't understand pray and ask God for
[2:00:08] understanding when I first came to this
[2:00:10] message I didn't understand all this I
[2:00:11] couldn't stand here and preach to y'all
[2:00:13] when I first came to I a know way would
[2:00:15] I had no understanding but as I just
[2:00:17] stayed with her even things that I
[2:00:19] couldn't necessarily agree with right
[2:00:29] brother
[2:00:32] yeah why would the
[2:00:35] prophet say that Martin Luther King is
[2:00:39] leading his people to a
[2:00:46] Slaughter you know that rub the rub the
[2:00:49] wrong way when when I first heard that
[2:00:52] quote I said why would he say something
[2:00:54] like that that's
[2:00:57] right I was looking at it from a natural
[2:01:01] perspective but when I caught the
[2:01:03] spiritual aspect of what was being
[2:01:05] said the prophet was dead
[2:01:12] right he say he leading him to a
[2:01:14] Slaughter it was a spiritual
[2:01:16] Slaughter even when we was in our
[2:01:18] denomination churches black people went
[2:01:20] to church amen they went to church on
[2:01:24] Sunday and there were certain sins that
[2:01:27] you would never find black people
[2:01:30] doing you you would never see that among
[2:01:32] black people I mean but but brother
[2:01:34] Brandon say look he's leading them to a
[2:01:36] Slaughter he don't realize what he's
[2:01:38] doing but he's leading him to a
[2:01:40] Slaughter and now now now we got more
[2:01:43] problems in this
[2:01:46] culture come on Church the prophet was
[2:01:49] dead dead right he saw spiritual
[2:01:54] things now I'm going tell you God didn't
[2:01:56] show me the spiritual aspect of it I had
[2:01:59] to hold to this message when I couldn't
[2:02:01] understand why he said what he said I
[2:02:03] like years went by Lord I'm trying to I
[2:02:07] don't get this one Lord and and and and
[2:02:10] and here's the other thing I'm going to
[2:02:11] tell you when he said that he was not a
[2:02:16] racist he saw spiritual
[2:02:20] things and he was spot on with
[2:02:24] it can I keep
[2:02:27] reading verse 19 when anyone Hearth the
[2:02:30] word of the kingdom and understandeth it
[2:02:33] not then cometh the wicked when and
[2:02:36] catcheth away that which was swn in his
[2:02:38] heart this is he which received seed by
[2:02:41] the wayside he's revealing what this
[2:02:43] what this Parable is look at verse 20
[2:02:45] but he that receiveth the seed into
[2:02:47] Stony places the same as he that heareth
[2:02:50] the word and Anon with joy receive it I
[2:02:55] mean they just jumping all up and down
[2:02:57] in church thanking God for the
[2:02:59] oh and y'all done seen people like this
[2:03:01] come to church and preach yelling all
[2:03:05] kind of things got the church all
[2:03:06] stirred
[2:03:07] up but after
[2:03:13] service yet hath he not root in
[2:03:17] himself but doth for a while he endureth
[2:03:20] for a while
[2:03:22] right for when tribulation or
[2:03:24] persecution ariseth because of the word
[2:03:27] by and by He Is
[2:03:30] offended when he's
[2:03:34] offended he's gone y'all y'all y'all
[2:03:37] done seen it I ain't got to explain this
[2:03:39] this is this is this is this is ABC we
[2:03:42] not seen it happen too many
[2:03:48] times here it is verse
[2:03:50] 22 he also that receive seed among the
[2:03:54] Thorns is he that Hearth the word look
[2:03:57] at this and the care of this
[2:04:04] world and
[2:04:06] the
[2:04:09] deceitfulness of
[2:04:11] riches y'all realize what that is the
[2:04:15] devil always got some little thing he
[2:04:17] dangling in front of you sir another big
[2:04:20] opportunity
[2:04:22] and another big opportunity if you just
[2:04:25] do this if you compromise here and you
[2:04:26] compromis there I got another big
[2:04:29] opportunity no no no no no
[2:04:32] compromises I don't I'm not I'm not
[2:04:34] deceived by trying to chase the riches
[2:04:36] all I need God to do all I need God to
[2:04:38] do is to
[2:04:40] supply my
[2:04:43] needs and he promised that I will supply
[2:04:46] all your needs according to my riches
[2:04:48] and Glory what I learned about that is
[2:04:50] that it's not even based on my work
[2:04:52] that's right I am going to go to work
[2:04:55] sir but it's not limited to my
[2:04:59] work I told y'all the other week I just
[2:05:01] filled out some paperwork they sent
[2:05:03] something and say say you um uh you can
[2:05:05] to be a part of this class action
[2:05:06] suit or can I and I ain't even got to go
[2:05:09] to court I'mma just fill out this paper
[2:05:11] and send it on to them I send it out
[2:05:14] they sent me a
[2:05:17] check God got other ways to meet your
[2:05:20] needs so don't limit God just to your
[2:05:22] work and just don't be deceived by the
[2:05:25] deceitfulness of
[2:05:29] riches
[2:05:31] amen I know you trying to be a
[2:05:34] millionaire and you would have already
[2:05:36] made it by
[2:05:39] now but it's possible you don't need to
[2:05:42] be a
[2:05:47] millionaire and I and I'm kind of
[2:05:50] convinced there's a a probably a lot of
[2:05:52] millionaires that actually wasn't doing
[2:05:55] things to try to become a millionaire it
[2:05:57] just happened there's others that was
[2:06:00] just born into the
[2:06:02] money amen right but sometimes you know
[2:06:05] and I learned this I learned this if we
[2:06:07] had everything we needed then we
[2:06:09] wouldn't be
[2:06:11] praying asking God for for
[2:06:14] help so sometimes we need to struggle a
[2:06:16] little bit it keeps us on our
[2:06:20] knees amen am and you just go from one
[2:06:23] season to the next season but you on
[2:06:25] your knees in every
[2:06:28] season God I got another need and he
[2:06:31] like talking to you I'm tell if you
[2:06:33] didn't have needs you wouldn't be
[2:06:34] talking to
[2:06:36] God it's not part of your daily routine
[2:06:38] just to sit down and talk to
[2:06:41] God you you just a Lord I Thank you for
[2:06:43] this and Lord I thank you no no no no
[2:06:44] there ain't no real
[2:06:45] conversation you got to go through some
[2:06:50] struggles he also that receive seed
[2:06:53] among the Thorns is he that Hearth the
[2:06:55] word and the cares of this
[2:06:57] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[2:07:00] choke the
[2:07:01] word and he becometh
[2:07:04] unfruitful which which ground are
[2:07:07] you here's the last
[2:07:10] verse but he that receive seed into the
[2:07:12] good ground is he that Hearth the word
[2:07:17] and understandeth
[2:07:20] it
[2:07:22] see see so you you heard the word I just
[2:07:24] gave you a scripture um on um in in in
[2:07:28] Matthew where Jesus said Eli's going to
[2:07:30] come and restore all things it's not
[2:07:32] just you heard it do you
[2:07:34] understand it can be John the Baptist
[2:07:37] fulfilling that yes he did come the
[2:07:40] Elias that that came already was John
[2:07:42] the Baptist but the one that's restoring
[2:07:44] all things no no no no that's not John
[2:07:47] the Baptist I understand that's not John
[2:07:50] the Baptist that is a future Ministry
[2:07:53] that Jesus is speaking of now he didn't
[2:07:56] I want you to notice something else
[2:07:58] Jesus did not tell the disciples that
[2:08:01] the that the the the the uh the the
[2:08:04] Elias that had come already he didn't
[2:08:05] say that was John the Baptist the Bible
[2:08:08] say they
[2:08:09] understood right that mean they caught a
[2:08:13] revelation of who it was and when you
[2:08:16] come to church you receive seed and good
[2:08:17] ground you hear the word then you
[2:08:19] understand you catch a revelation what
[2:08:21] this
[2:08:23] is here the word and understand that
[2:08:25] which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[2:08:26] forth some 100 fold some 60 some 30
[2:08:31] brother Jack you keep saying brother

[2:11:56] uh mystery that's what the Bible said
[2:11:58] finishes The Mystery of the written book
[2:12:01] watch it now let's note a few of these
[2:12:05] Mysteries and if you want to write them
[2:12:08] down first I'll take what skolfield says
[2:12:12] here in Matthew 13 so when when
[2:12:15] scoffield was looking at Matthew 13 in
[2:12:18] his own studies my God he was was
[2:12:21] looking at uh uh I believe it was verse
[2:12:24] 13 no no no at verse 11 says he said
[2:12:27] unto them because it's given unto you to
[2:12:29] know the mysteries of the kingdom
[2:12:31] scoffield was looking at he started
[2:12:33] identifying Mysteries that he could see
[2:12:34] in the scripture somebody has to come
[2:12:37] along and reveal the truth to all these
[2:12:39] Mysteries scoffield saw
[2:12:42] it look at it let's go on it says first
[2:12:47] I'll take I'll take take take you what
[2:12:48] Scofield said here in Matthew 13 if you
[2:12:51] like to type some of them down if you
[2:12:53] haven't got a scofi Bible you might read
[2:12:55] what he thinks some of the Mysteries are
[2:12:59] now in the 11th verse he answered and
[2:13:01] said him because it's given unto you his
[2:13:03] disciples because it's given to you to
[2:13:05] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[2:13:06] heaven but not to them but to them it is
[2:13:08] not given now look the Mysteries here is
[2:13:12] the mystery and Scofield writes this
[2:13:14] note a mystery is
[2:13:16] scripture is previously hidden
[2:13:19] truth now
[2:13:21] now this is not brother branham's
[2:13:23] definition this is Scofield's definition
[2:13:26] but it's very fitting to brother
[2:13:27] branham's
[2:13:29] Ministry previously hidden
[2:13:32] truth now divinely revealed and not only
[2:13:37] that and Scofield say but which is a
[2:13:40] supernatural element still remain
[2:13:42] despite the Revelation now I just like
[2:13:45] to say this when we look at just even
[2:13:47] the church ages when brother Brandon
[2:13:49] preached the church ages and he he wrote
[2:13:51] up on on on a little board in the front
[2:13:53] of the church he just teaching Church
[2:13:54] ages at the end of his sermon the angel
[2:13:58] of the Lord came into the church and on
[2:14:00] the back wall of the church rote the
[2:14:02] seven churches out that is a
[2:14:04] supernatural element that remain despite
[2:14:08] the
[2:14:09] Revelation you going to tell me the
[2:14:11] church AG is not right and God wrote it
[2:14:13] on the wall
[2:14:16] himself you going to say this belong to
[2:14:18] Lin well yeah Lin had a little lay out
[2:14:21] just like this but did the angel come
[2:14:23] and write on the wall what Lin
[2:14:27] talk now we can we can put our weight on
[2:14:29] things that's that's supernaturally
[2:14:31] given to us amen Church look at this I'm
[2:14:36] going on I'm going
[2:14:38] on a previously hidden truth now
[2:14:42] divinely revealed but which is a
[2:14:43] supernatural element Still Remains
[2:14:45] despite the Revelation the greater
[2:14:46] Mysteries and the great Mysteries are
[2:14:48] this is scof Field's notes now look at
[2:14:49] it I I'm I'm I'm quoting brother Brandon
[2:14:52] but he's quoting
[2:14:55] scoffield I got a scoffield Bible right
[2:14:57] here I can show you my Bible everything
[2:14:59] he's saying is right here in scoffield
[2:15:00] notes everything what he's saying right
[2:15:03] here but scoffield saw there some
[2:15:06] Mysteries you ask me what did he restore
[2:15:08] these are the things that were restored
[2:15:10] the truth behind all these things and
[2:15:12] more were restored watch what SC feel
[2:15:15] sake says number one The Mystery of the
[2:15:18] Kingdom of Heaven that's the one we're
[2:15:20] talking now uh uh Matthew 13: 3-50 says
[2:15:25] now the second mystery is the mystery of
[2:15:27] Israel's blindness during this age
[2:15:30] Romans 11:25 with context with the
[2:15:32] context third mystery is the mystery of
[2:15:35] the translation of the living Saints at
[2:15:36] the end time of this age 1 Corinthians
[2:15:38] 15 also uh Thessalonians 4:14 through1
[2:15:41] 17 brother brandom even told us that the
[2:15:44] mystery of the shout voice and Trump the
[2:15:46] shout was this message going forth The
[2:15:49] Voice Gathering the bride together and
[2:15:51] that lets us know that we are in the
[2:15:54] Rapture now yes sir we not waiting for
[2:15:57] something the only the only thing going
[2:15:59] to happen now is just a change of the
[2:16:00] body but we're in the Rapture now just
[2:16:02] by be just by being gathered to this
[2:16:05] word we're in it right

[2:16:59] is Jesus of the new that was given to us
[2:17:02] by the prophet brother random say and
[2:17:04] godliness restored to man say the ninth
[2:17:07] mystery is the mystery of iniquity found
[2:17:08] in second Thessalonians now now now
[2:17:10] Scofield's looking at the brother
[2:17:11] brandom and the seals picks up that and
[2:17:13] tells us how the Antichrist Spirit got
[2:17:15] started my God my God my God just like
[2:17:19] just like the uh we we saw it was the
[2:17:21] same insect it was the same rider that's

[2:17:27] changing colors went from white to Red
[2:17:30] to Black to and when we got Pale Horse

[2:17:37] together yes sir white red and black
[2:17:40] made the Pale Horse till he rode it all
[2:17:42] the way out to death oh my god oh we got
[2:17:46] our eye on this thing look at this he

[2:18:08] mystery of Babylon The Prostitute
[2:18:10] Revelation 175 to7 these are scull field
[2:18:14] notes watch what brother random say
[2:18:16] that's
[2:18:18] some that's some of the Mysteries that
[2:18:22] this Angel is supposed to wind up uh
[2:18:24] wind up all uh the mystery all the
[2:18:28] Mysteries God and the other may I say
[2:18:30] this with reverence and not referring to
[2:18:33] myself but referring to the angel of
[2:18:36] God another
[2:18:38] mystery the serpent seed you ask me what
[2:18:42] did he
[2:18:44] restore I got an answer for you who
[2:18:47] taught us the serpent seed and what
[2:18:48] really happened in the Garden of Eden
[2:18:51] did John the Baptist teach us that or
[2:18:54] did brother brandham teach us that and
[2:18:56] if you say John the Baptist then show me
[2:18:58] in the scripture where he taught
[2:19:03] it the certainty that's been a hidden
[2:19:05] Mystery All Through The Years this Grace
[2:19:07] straightened out but uh straighten out
[2:19:10] not disgrace but real true Grace here's
[2:19:15] another one no such thing as an eternal
[2:19:18] burning hell you want to know what He
[2:19:20] restored He restored the truth to that
[2:19:22] right you will burn for millions of
[2:19:24] years but anything that was eternal had
[2:19:26] never beginning or end and hell was
[2:19:31] created all these Mysteries here's
[2:19:34] another one the mystery of the baptism
[2:19:36] of the Holy
[2:19:38] Ghost without
[2:19:41] sensation because Pentecost told we have
[2:19:43] to speak in tongues in order to have the
[2:19:45] Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues and
[2:19:47] cursed their neighbors
[2:19:49] out and I I out of the same mouth they
[2:19:53] blessed and cursed we don't want that
[2:19:56] type of Holy
[2:19:58] Ghost the mystery of the baptism of the
[2:20:00] Holy Ghost without sensation but the
[2:20:02] person of Christ performing in you the
[2:20:03] same works that he did the mystery of
[2:20:06] water baptism who restored that truth of
[2:20:08] water
[2:20:10] baptism did John do it
[2:20:14] Sir John's baptism didn't even last past
[2:20:17] Acts
[2:20:19] 19 the mystery baptism where the extreme
[2:20:22] trinitarian trinitarianism has brought
[2:20:24] into this titles of father son Holy
[2:20:27] Ghost and the Mystery of the godhead
[2:20:29] being fulfilled in the baptism of the
[2:20:31] name of Jesus Christ according to the
[2:20:33] book of the revelations that Jesus uh
[2:20:35] that that the church in this time was to
[2:20:38] receive he goes
[2:20:40] on there there are some of the Mysteries
[2:20:43] the pillar of fire returning back amen
[2:20:46] that's the thing that's supposed to take
[2:20:48] place and we see it oh how we could go
[2:20:51] on naming the
[2:20:53] Mysteries that's just some of them we
[2:20:55] gave you godhead was restored we
[2:20:59] understand what God had marriage and
[2:21:02] divorce restored the two schools of
[2:21:05] thoughts so marriage and divorce brother
[2:21:06] Brandon brought the truth back to that
[2:21:08] who is this
[2:21:10] MDC these are things that were restored
[2:21:12] through his ministry there's so many
[2:21:14] things
[2:21:15] restored we got the word restored
[2:21:18] Hallelujah now when the word is restored
[2:21:22] that's when the dynamic power is also
[2:21:25] restored I ain't got time to read all
[2:21:27] that I told you where I was going to cut
[2:21:29] off that's it I'm stopping right
[2:21:34] there if y'all just allow me to add just
[2:21:36] one little
[2:21:38] thing
[2:21:40] brother musicians y'all come I'mma just
[2:21:43] say this real quick and I'm I'm G get
[2:21:44] out of here remember I told y'all if
[2:21:47] somebody come to
[2:21:49] you and tell you John the Baptist is the
[2:21:51] one that restored All Things based on
[2:21:54] what Jesus said that Elias was come
[2:21:56] going to come and restore if somebody
[2:21:57] come I say ask them a question what did
[2:22:00] he restore and I gave you an example of
[2:22:03] brother brandham I'm sorry where Jesus
[2:22:05] just gave one question to the religious
[2:22:08] leaders of his day all you got to do is
[2:22:10] give one question today now I'm going
[2:22:12] tell you in brother Brandon's Ministry
[2:22:13] there was one question that was given in
[2:22:15] his time there was a great challenge put
[2:22:17] on by this man his name was Dr best
[2:22:21] and he wanted to prove that Jesus was
[2:22:23] not the same yesterday forever and that
[2:22:25] healing was not taking place brother Ram
[2:22:27] say I I'm not going to stand before the
[2:22:29] people and I'm I'm not going to argue
[2:22:31] with this man but brother Bosworth say
[2:22:32] you don't have to do it but if you would
[2:22:33] give me permission to go and just stand
[2:22:36] before this man and just give him you
[2:22:38] know uh uh you know just just just
[2:22:40] talk said let me just ask him a question
[2:22:43] he says he he just can get up there and
[2:22:44] say these things and nobody challenge
