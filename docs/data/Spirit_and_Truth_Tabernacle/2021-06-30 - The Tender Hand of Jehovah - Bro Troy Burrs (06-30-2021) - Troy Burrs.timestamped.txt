[7:05] amen uh uh second corinthians the fourth
[7:09] chapter take our reading from second
[7:12] corinthians the fourth chapter will
[7:14] start at the third verse
[7:16] amen say amen when you got it
[7:22] second corinthians the fourth chapter
[7:25] and the third first
[7:26] i guess we got used to the screen i fear
[7:29] there's a
[7:30] problem with the screen uh with the uh
[7:35] tonight so we'll just have to follow
[7:38] along
[7:39] okay i guess we kind of got it
[7:42] amen amen second corinthians 4 chapter 3
[7:45] verses but if the gospel be hid
[7:47] it behead to them that are lost in whom
[7:52] the god of this world hath blinded the
[7:55] minds of them
[7:56] which believe not lest the light of the
[7:59] glorious gospel of christ
[8:02] who is the image of god should shine
[8:05] unto them for we preach not ourselves
[8:08] but christ jesus the lord
[8:11] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[8:13] sake
[8:15] for god who commanded the light to shine
[8:16] out of the darkness has shined
[8:18] in our hearts to give the light of the
[8:21] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[8:24] the face of
[8:25] jesus christ but we have this
[8:28] treasure in earthen vessels
[8:33] that the excellency of the power may be
[8:36] of god
[8:37] and not of us we are troubled on every
[8:39] side yet not distressed we are perplexed
[8:42] but not in despair we're persecuted but
[8:45] not forsaken
[8:46] cast down but not destroyed you may
[8:49] uh remember the lord out of the
[8:50] blessings of the reason's word you may
[8:51] be seated
[8:52] amen um
[8:56] i'd like to take a a short text tonight
[9:00] um and i'll call this sort of a
[9:03] roundabout way i want to talk about the
[9:05] tinder hand of jehovah amen the tender
[9:10] hand of jehovah
[9:13] amen and reading that scripture it just
[9:16] blesses me that uh uh he said we have a
[9:20] treasure
[9:21] amen in earth and vex and earth and
[9:23] vessels
[9:24] amen uh that the excellency of the power
[9:29] may be of god and not of
[9:32] us maybe of god and not of us
[9:36] we are troubled on every side yet we're
[9:39] not distressed
[9:41] we're perplexed but not in despair
[9:44] persecuted
[9:46] but not forsaken cast down
[9:49] but not destroyed amen if we can uh take
[9:51] a scripture reading we're going to go to
[9:53] daniel the fifth
[9:55] amen daniel the book of daniel the
[9:58] fifth chapter and uh
[10:05] i'm gonna pull a little something out of
[10:06] there to give us
[10:09] a man a platform of just thought it's
[10:12] kind of a roundabout way but
[10:14] you know how many been joined the bible
[10:16] studies amen just really
[10:20] every time just get so much out of it
[10:23] and man it just speaks to my heart and
[10:25] that's where this message was sort of
[10:27] birthed out of probably about
[10:29] three or four bible studies ago brother
[10:32] jack was just talking and he was talking
[10:34] about the tender hand of jehovah
[10:36] and it just stayed with me you know and
[10:38] i just thought
[10:39] maybe uh the lord gave me something to
[10:41] say on the tender hand of jehovah
[10:44] and there's always something to say
[10:46] about the tender hand of jehovah
[10:48] amen but i just thought i'd bring this
[10:50] little this little thought here
[10:53] uh daniel the fifth chapter bell shazad
[10:56] the king
[10:57] made a great feast to thousands of
[11:00] his lords
[11:03] and drank wine before thousands
[11:07] belches are while he
[11:10] tasted the wine commanded to bring
[11:15] the golden and silver silver
[11:18] vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar
[11:22] had taken
[11:23] out of the temple which was in jerusalem
[11:28] that the king and his and his prince
[11:31] his wives and his concubines might drink
[11:34] therein
[11:37] then they brought the golden vessels and
[11:39] were taken out of the temple
[11:42] of the house of god which was at
[11:43] jerusalem
[11:45] and the king and the princes and his
[11:47] wives and his concubines drank them
[11:50] they drank the wine and praised the gods
[11:53] of
[11:54] silver brass iron and of wood
[11:57] and of stone in the same hour
[12:00] came forth
[12:03] fingers of a man's hand and wrote over
[12:06] against the candlestick
[12:08] upon the plaster of the wall of the
[12:10] king's palace
[12:11] and he saw a great part of the hand that
[12:14] rope
[12:16] then the king's countenance was changed
[12:18] and his countenance troubled him so the
[12:20] so that the joints of his loins were
[12:22] loose and his knees smote
[12:25] one against the other
[12:29] the king cried aloud bringing in the
[12:32] astrologers and the child demons and the
[12:34] soothsayers and the
[12:35] and the king spake and said to the wise
[12:38] men of babylon whosoever shall read
[12:40] this writing and show me the
[12:43] interpretation thereof shall be clothed
[12:45] and scarlet
[12:46] and have a chain about his neck and
[12:48] shall be the ruler
[12:50] a third shall be the third ruler in the
[12:53] kingdom
[12:54] and it came to pass the king's wise men
[12:57] uh could not read the writings noah made
[13:01] known to the king the interpretation of
[13:04] thereof
[13:06] uh the king of belgium saw greatly
[13:08] troubled and his countenance was changed
[13:10] in him
[13:11] and his lords were astonished now the
[13:13] queen
[13:14] by reason of the word of the of the king
[13:17] and the lords came into the banquet
[13:19] house and the queen
[13:20] spake and said oh uh
[13:23] to the king o king live forever let not
[13:27] that count
[13:27] thy thoughts troubled thee nor let thy
[13:30] countenance be changed there is a man
[13:32] in the kingdom in whom is the spirit of
[13:36] the holy gods and in the day of
[13:39] thy father's light and understanding and
[13:43] wisdom
[13:44] like the wisdom of god's was
[13:48] found in him whom the king
[13:50] nebuchadnezzar thy father and the king
[13:52] saith thy father made master of
[13:55] the magicians astrologers and chaldeans
[13:57] and soothsayers for as much as an
[13:59] excellent spirit and knowledge and
[14:02] understanding
[14:03] interpreting of dreams and showing of
[14:05] hard sentences
[14:06] and dissolving of doubts
[14:10] were found in the same
[14:14] daniel amen and daniel called and we'll
[14:17] show the interpretation when daniel
[14:19] brought in
[14:20] uh for the king and the and the king
[14:23] spake
[14:23] said unto daniel art thou daniel which
[14:25] are the children of the captivity of the
[14:27] judah
[14:28] whom the king my father brought uh out
[14:31] of
[14:32] uh jury and have
[14:35] even heard the the spirit of gods in him
[14:38] light and understanding and excellent
[14:41] wisdom is found in thee
[14:43] now the wise men and astrologers brought
[14:46] in
[14:46] brought before me that they should read
[14:49] this writing
[14:51] make known unto me the interpretation
[14:55] amen i want to just read down to kind of
[14:58] avoid a whole lot of reading
[15:00] amen um daniel answered and said
[15:04] before the king let thy gift uh
[15:07] be thyself and to rewards
[15:10] um i would read the writing unto the
[15:13] king and
[15:13] make known unto him the interpretation
[15:16] the kingdom of mozart nebuchadnezzar
[15:18] father the kingdom of majesty and glory
[15:19] and the honor
[15:20] and the majesty he gave him to people
[15:24] nations languages
[15:25] trembled in fear before him who would he
[15:28] s
[15:29] he slew and uh
[15:32] whom he would kept alive and would
[15:35] set up uh he would
[15:38] set up and whom he would
[15:41] he put down and his heart was lifted up
[15:45] and his mind heartened and pride
[15:47] disposed the king of the throne
[15:50] and he was driven from his sons and his
[15:51] men and his heart was made like a beast
[15:57] amen his heart was made like a beast and
[15:59] his dwelling
[16:00] was wild asses and fed him grass like
[16:04] oxen and his body was wet
[16:06] with the dew of heaven till he knew
[16:09] that the most high god ruled in
[16:12] the kingdom now going on in this story
[16:15] you can take that down going on in this
[16:17] story i just want to
[16:19] want to um just kind of point out how
[16:23] how the the the king um
[16:27] took those sacred vessels amen
[16:30] and had such disrespect amen for the
[16:34] vessels of god and
[16:36] and and if we go on there we see that
[16:38] the the
[16:39] the handwriting that was on the wall
[16:42] uh uh was uh uh that you had were
[16:46] weighed into balance and found wanting
[16:50] uh the king had done a horrible thing
[16:59] amen because he uh
[17:03] uh really upset amen the lord because of
[17:08] his unbelief amen and
[17:11] disrespected the sacred vessels
[17:14] amen amen i've read earlier in
[17:18] corinthians about
[17:19] we have a treasure that's hidden in
[17:22] earthen vessels
[17:23] amen so we want to look at
[17:28] the the the the the scales you are
[17:31] you are weighed in the balance and found
[17:34] wanting
[17:35] so that symbol of a scale that that the
[17:38] king was kind of
[17:40] caught in a in a in a situation there
[17:44] amen
[17:48] if you go to any courtroom you'll see
[17:51] a man uh a symbol that that that
[17:54] balances
[17:55] is there a symbol of judgment
[17:58] amen you can um it's it's always
[18:01] been uh sort of in the olden days i
[18:05] guess
[18:05] they they use the balance uh uh a sort
[18:09] of like a cash register
[18:11] and even today you can you sometimes you
[18:14] go through your produce department and
[18:15] you have to weigh your produce it's
[18:17] so much per pound it's uh your meat is
[18:20] sold so much
[18:22] per pound so your commodity goods uh
[18:25] uh uh attain their value by their weight
[18:29] okay it could have a certain amount amen
[18:31] if i had
[18:32] one penny would weigh a certain amount
[18:34] but if i had a hundred pennies it weighs
[18:36] a certain
[18:37] so a scale balanced a man it had a sense
[18:40] of value to it
[18:42] and they used the scale to to figure out
[18:47] how much amen or or or or or
[18:50] uh you was given or how of the
[18:53] the cost how much you was doing so
[18:56] the the sin that nebuchadnezzar had had
[19:00] had done
[19:01] by taking these sacred vessels amen and
[19:04] and and using these vessels amen
[19:08] to to drink to other gods amen he had
[19:12] come
[19:12] he he sinned a great sin
[19:15] amen and and and what a weight on the
[19:18] vessel
[19:19] on the scale amen that that sin of
[19:23] unbelief because see
[19:25] he didn't it it it the unbelief that he
[19:28] didn't believe that those vessels
[19:31] amen was so sacred
[19:35] he had uh he had he had a doubt in his
[19:37] heart
[19:38] so so it the the act of the party and
[19:41] the act of drinking the wine
[19:43] and what he did to the vessels were
[19:45] attributes of the unbelief of the value
[19:48] and the seriousness of what he was doing
[19:52] so it it it was a it was a great sin
[19:56] it was a great weight amen in the in
[19:59] in the uh in the scale so
[20:05] he was weighed in that balance
[20:09] and in the balance there if it's even
[20:11] you're at zero
[20:14] amen i i want to say tonight my brothers
[20:18] and sisters i don't want to be at zero
[20:23] when when when the balance is i'm
[20:26] weighed in the balance and balancing my
[20:27] favor
[20:28] i i i want the weight amen
[20:31] amen of the love of jesus christ
[20:34] amen that's in my heart to to to bottom
[20:37] out
[20:41] why because see uh uh uh
[20:46] the the bible talks about the weight of
[20:49] sin come unto me
[20:50] all ye that are heavy laden and i'll
[20:53] give you rest
[20:56] see he had in the garden of eden amen
[20:59] uh uh uh uh when the sin began and and
[21:01] we
[21:02] we come into the world the way we did we
[21:04] come into the world already
[21:07] with the scales tipped
[21:10] amen we are we are already found
[21:14] wanting wanting we have a
[21:17] need amen to some for for for someone to
[21:21] come and
[21:22] write the scales in our favor
[21:26] amen we we were born found
[21:30] wanting amen the weight of sin
[21:34] the weight of of of sin over
[21:38] was overtaking us
[21:41] but thank be to god at calvary
[21:45] amen the blood of jesus christ
[21:49] amen there was no heavier object
[21:52] amen no nothing on the earth had
[21:56] more value to it
[21:59] than the blood of god that was shed for
[22:02] us
[22:03] and it'll write any scale why because
[22:06] it'll erase
[22:08] all of the sins
[22:12] so there's nothing over there all of it
[22:14] is over the weight and the scale is just
[22:16] tip
[22:17] totally in your favor there's nothing
[22:20] against you
[22:21] there's nothing over there on that scale
[22:24] it's light as a feather
[22:26] because he took your sins and bored
[22:29] to calvary amen when you accept that
[22:32] blood
[22:33] amen you have to do more than just
[22:36] mentally accept it
[22:38] we'll get into that just a little bit
[22:40] here
[22:42] so that great weight amen
[22:45] everyone has their own scale now
[22:50] we we we see that that that that that
[22:54] sometimes people and
[22:57] the devil is a real trickery
[23:00] we see things that are that that are
[23:03] that are
[23:04] that are that are uh he'll give you
[23:06] something that
[23:07] maybe look heavy fools gold
[23:11] look heavy but it it has no substance to
[23:15] it
[23:16] see it's something that's hollow and
[23:18] painted over
[23:20] it's got a shine but it has no substance
[23:24] there's no there's no bottom to it
[23:26] there's it's it's not
[23:27] dense it's not there it's it's it looks
[23:31] good it looks like the original
[23:34] but there's no real weight to it it
[23:35] carries it's
[23:37] nothing it'll never tip the scale
[23:41] the prophet said we should balance our
[23:43] lives against the
[23:45] against the word amen the word of god
[23:48] will balance out the scales
[23:50] of of this of this of sin and that that
[23:53] that that were transgressions in our
[23:54] lives
[23:55] amen so we see
[24:00] a false scale is an abomination
[24:05] so the devil tries to offer you
[24:08] something that you would think
[24:12] is heavy enough to tip the scales
[24:15] it looks heavy well look at what i got
[24:19] i go to church every day let's put that
[24:22] on the scale
[24:24] it don't do nothing the weight of sin is
[24:28] still sitting there
[24:30] i give to the poor i give to my
[24:32] charities
[24:35] but the weight of sin is still there
[24:38] you're still weighed in the balance
[24:41] and found wanting amen
[24:46] i i'm a good person i've never stole
[24:49] anything in my life
[24:52] uh uh um i do good to people i'm fair
[24:56] fair i'm a fair man but fair
[25:00] woman i've i've never committed adultery
[25:02] on my husband
[25:04] that weight is still there amen
[25:07] there's more that you must do to tip
[25:11] the scales in your favor
[25:14] amen uh we can we can
[25:17] we can do all sorts of things
[25:20] amen the prophet
[25:24] of god if you don't mind if i just look
[25:27] at a little bit of this
[25:29] amen in the message thirsting for life
[25:32] he was talking about how he's a hunter
[25:35] and sometimes he he gets
[25:38] uh he watched the old deer and the wolf
[25:41] gets after the deer
[25:43] and man and that deer is running from
[25:45] that wolf
[25:47] and and they and and and the wolf is
[25:49] right on the deals
[25:51] hiding parts and if he can ever
[25:54] lunge and get a piece of that whoopsie
[25:56] what the wolf does here he's talking
[25:58] about it and he says he'll get that that
[26:00] wolf of
[26:01] a grab a bite and throw his weight to
[26:04] throw him
[26:06] off balance see
[26:09] i want you to understand let's see
[26:11] balance
[26:13] amen it's more than just a scale
[26:19] it's more than just a scale the prophet
[26:22] said one place he says spiritual amnesia
[26:24] will cause you to lose your balance
[26:28] forget who you are see and cause you to
[26:32] lose your
[26:33] balance in that way see what happens now
[26:36] is
[26:36] is is is is you're beginning to uh take
[26:39] on fool's gold
[26:42] instead of the real thing amen and the
[26:44] weight of sin
[26:46] is still on the balance and you're in
[26:48] you're you're
[26:49] you're found wanting amen a lot of
[26:52] people say well you must have a balance
[26:54] in this life well you gotta have a
[26:56] balance y'all just go to church church
[26:58] church you gotta have a balance wait a
[27:00] minute that don't mean balance with the
[27:02] world
[27:05] that don't mean balance with we ain't
[27:07] trying to balance with the world
[27:11] i want the scale well not to work bam
[27:13] all the way over
[27:14] i'm down i'm sure i got weight
[27:20] why what is the weight what is that
[27:22] weight that i'm talking about
[27:25] the token the blood of jesus christ
[27:30] man he came and shed his blood amen
[27:33] you must have the token what is the
[27:36] token
[27:37] the blood on display
[27:42] amen so we're looking at this this this
[27:44] this the scale and
[27:46] and and and reference here
[27:50] amen let me go back to the wolfram you
[27:52] notice the wolf
[27:53] hey man he gets a hole in he and he sort
[27:55] of swings his balance a little bit
[27:57] to cause this deer that's running for
[28:00] his dear life
[28:02] amen he began to bleed or as he's
[28:06] bleeding he's losing strength but the
[28:07] prophet said as long as he stayed near
[28:09] that water
[28:11] and he crossed back and forth that river
[28:14] amen that wolf will never catch you
[28:16] because he'll go
[28:17] up and you go back and he'd go back in
[28:19] here drink a little water you go again
[28:20] he go again he drink a little water
[28:22] i don't care what you're going through i
[28:25] don't care how wounded you may be
[28:28] i don't care how difficult the trial may
[28:31] be
[28:31] i read the scripture in corinthians that
[28:34] we are troubled on every hand
[28:36] amen that we are perplexed amen but not
[28:39] forsaken
[28:40] cast down but not downtrodden amen
[28:44] we stay near the water
[28:48] amen in my heart just kind of ate and i
[28:51] saw a young
[28:52] sister this this weekend coming to
[28:54] church i didn't say no i just looked at
[28:56] her
[28:56] and i just said stay stay near the water
[28:58] sister
[28:59] she looked at me i said just stay near
[29:01] the water you'll be all right
[29:04] and while willie was preaching he began
[29:06] to speak to the young folks
[29:09] and say i see what you're going through
[29:10] god see what you're going through
[29:12] and just shut that little encouragement
[29:14] out stay near the water
[29:16] you're going to go free after a while if
[29:19] the hounds of hell may be on you you may
[29:21] be wounded
[29:23] you may be troubled you may not
[29:25] understand it but what is it it's the
[29:27] tender hand of jehovah
[29:29] amen guiding you to a place to where you
[29:32] can drink
[29:34] and be strengthened sometimes some
[29:36] people have to go through some things
[29:39] i had a situation just this evening out
[29:41] in the back
[29:42] i parked out there and i noticed these
[29:44] guys all the time because
[29:46] that's my job i come in
[29:50] early and they sit back there and they
[29:53] and they do their thing so i
[29:57] sit right there in my part right in the
[29:59] middle of
[30:00] sat in my truck they looking at me
[30:04] i'm looking at them
[30:07] they bold they gonna fire these little
[30:09] stuff up right there
[30:11] all right no problem so i began to get
[30:14] out of the truck and i started to come
[30:15] in
[30:16] and uh he said got a church i said up
[30:20] there
[30:22] i turned around and said yep and i said
[30:25] what you doing
[30:29] we just getting a little relaxation on
[30:32] i told him i say man that stuff for kid
[30:35] you
[30:37] i say uh there's plenty other ways to
[30:41] get your relaxation on
[30:42] you don't have to do that and i told
[30:45] them i say see that is
[30:46] life that is death masquerading as life
[30:53] fools go you think you're living and
[30:56] think you're having a good time
[30:58] but you're killing yourself
[31:04] when i began to tell him my testimony i
[31:06] said ain't no one of y'all out here
[31:08] hope my mama still might work man ain't
[31:10] none of one of y'all out here smoke more
[31:12] weed than me
[31:17] and i began to share with him he and the
[31:20] young man come to me and say well it's a
[31:22] herb
[31:22] i say so it's nutmeg you ain't smoking
[31:24] that
[31:27] so don't come telling me that
[31:31] i say if it's a herb boil it drink it
[31:34] put it in a tea
[31:35] don't smoke it that's the sin of
[31:38] witchcraft
[31:40] and that's why you're doing it that's
[31:42] the devil killing you he's
[31:44] every time every puff you take a little
[31:46] bit of life is leaving you
[31:50] just this evening every puff you take
[31:54] a little bit of life is leaving you
[31:57] you're shortening your life
[32:04] i say boil it drink it
[32:07] i say i tell you what get some sour sap
[32:11] leaves
[32:12] boil it and drink it it'll almost give
[32:14] you the same effect
[32:18] relax you and put you right to sleep
[32:21] see but the devil ain't gonna tell you
[32:23] that
[32:26] see you don't have to you don't have to
[32:28] you don't have to you don't have to
[32:29] believe the devil's lie
[32:33] so we find that the weight of sin
[32:36] is heavy it's heavy and it has a heavy
[32:40] price
[32:42] it takes a the something real something
[32:45] with
[32:46] substance to it to to balance
[32:49] and to to to read it from the scales of
[32:52] of the judgment
[32:55] amen so that hulk that that that
[32:59] that deer amen as long as he stay near
[33:02] the water
[33:04] amen he has a chance to get away
[33:08] the minute that deer leaves that river
[33:12] amen is a certain death
[33:16] we're talking about the tender hand of
[33:17] jehovah
[33:19] and how amen the the the lord
[33:22] amen talk about he would how he would
[33:25] leave
[33:26] the 99 and go after the one
[33:30] but you know when you when you when you
[33:32] hear the story and you talk about it
[33:34] everyone thinks that it's old man it's
[33:35] so
[33:37] so so so beautiful
[33:40] how the lord would just go after this
[33:42] nice sheep and bring it back
[33:46] but he'd go after that sheep and break
[33:48] his legs
[33:52] so it won't run no more
[33:56] seemed cruel doesn't it seem awful cruel
[34:02] but then he take that sheet amen and he
[34:05] hoisted up across his shoulders
[34:08] amen because the shoulders are the
[34:09] strongest part of his body
[34:12] as who is the body of christ
[34:15] we are you or his shoulders
[34:20] what'd he do he take that wounded that
[34:22] wounded that wounded that wounded sheep
[34:26] and take him across his shoulders maybe
[34:29] that was a wounded sheep and
[34:31] uh he'd come and he'd be maybe come to
[34:34] church
[34:36] and come and we'll bear him up on our
[34:38] shoulders
[34:40] carry him for a while amen be able
[34:44] able to minister to him in kindness amen
[34:48] and told him a little bit come on we'll
[34:51] carry you we'll pray you through
[34:54] amen we find sometimes people may come
[34:56] and they may be wounded and things and
[34:58] and the lord put them in our care
[35:01] put them across the shoulders why
[35:04] because we're
[35:04] it's the strongest part of his body
[35:09] he's entrusted that job to us he don't
[35:12] have
[35:13] literal shoulders we
[35:16] the body of christ is his shoulders you
[35:19] and i so we take we he's entrusted that
[35:24] so we see him there and they come and
[35:26] and and we don't see him for a while
[35:28] give your brothers and sisters a call
[35:32] pray with them maybe the hounds of hell
[35:36] is after them
[35:38] maybe they just need a drink of water
[35:41] just a little encouragement amen
[35:44] may make all the difference in the world
[35:48] we have a great responsibility in my
[35:50] brothers and sisters
[35:52] amen the tender hand of jehovah
[35:56] i don't know what route that that many
[35:58] of us take to to be where we are today
[36:02] amen i'm sure everyone has a story
[36:05] everyone has uh uh uh uh of things that
[36:08] happened
[36:09] oh god that just was like traumatic oh
[36:12] how why me
[36:16] but he had it was moving you right into
[36:18] a perfect place
[36:20] right where he wanted you to be
[36:23] it may seem hard
[36:27] it may seem but uh and a lot of times
[36:29] you know like
[36:30] the the tender hand of jehovah he had to
[36:32] go get the sheep and the sheep go
[36:33] through the breaking legs now he's got
[36:34] to be nurtured and he got to be ruined
[36:36] and everything but the sheep shouldn't
[36:38] laugh
[36:43] look what you running out what you going
[36:44] over why you keep running off
[36:48] ain't the wolf going to get you
[36:53] so what am i saying just like brother
[36:55] brother smile said now i'm talking we
[36:56] did like we our worst problem we called
[36:58] it on myself
[37:00] then why me why am i going through this
[37:04] but it's in the hand of jehovah of us
[37:05] and give mercy and kindness anyway
[37:10] amen tip the scales in our favor
[37:16] i want to read something that the
[37:17] prophet said here
[37:19] in the message the token
[37:23] we must remember that no matter what we
[37:25] do a how
[37:27] successful in life
[37:30] without christ we've totally
[37:34] lost everything
[37:38] i don't care how successful
[37:41] you are in life
[37:46] without christ you've totally
[37:49] lost everything
[37:53] so if he is all
[37:57] that there is to look forward to uh
[38:00] park44 thank you
[38:02] um there is to look forward to then we
[38:05] would
[38:06] uh be most foolish people not to accept
[38:08] it
[38:10] and cherish it not only accept it
[38:14] but you come to something greater than
[38:16] that after you've got it
[38:19] don't take it and lay it on the shelf
[38:24] it's to be put into use
[38:28] like going to the doctor to get medicine
[38:30] and said it on the shelf
[38:32] if you go to get the medicine take the
[38:35] medicine
[38:36] and if a disease bothers you and this
[38:38] remedy is supposed to help you
[38:41] you take what he gives you and just the
[38:44] way
[38:45] he he says give it because sometimes
[38:49] just a few minutes make a lot of
[38:51] difference in the way that you give it
[38:55] but sometimes just a few minutes make a
[38:58] lot of
[38:59] difference in the way you give it
[39:02] and how we know but in this case today
[39:07] just one moment of your decision might
[39:11] determine your eternal destination
[39:14] take it just as he hands it to you
[39:19] a token
[39:23] the blood shall be a token
[39:27] now the first token
[39:30] is a word that's commonly used
[39:33] among the word token i'm sorry at first
[39:37] the word token is a word that's commonly
[39:39] used among english-speaking people
[39:41] especially in america a token is
[39:44] uh really the dictionary says a token is
[39:47] a sign
[39:48] it's a sign of a fair price paid see
[39:52] a fair or a price required
[39:56] that's been paid amen
[39:59] so a token amen talking about those
[40:02] scales and the balance
[40:03] amount of scales the only thing that's
[40:05] going to write that scale amen
[40:08] is the token the the the the the the
[40:12] blood of jesus christ amen
[40:14] amen is is is the only thing the only
[40:17] thing that's going to be
[40:18] substance enough for the great sin amen
[40:21] that was committed amen in the beginning
[40:24] amen and we all have to have that amen
[40:27] to write the scales in our favor
[40:30] amen nothing else to do
[40:35] no fools go amen
[40:38] you can't you can't manipulate the scale
[40:42] sometime in business crooked business
[40:44] what they try to do
[40:45] is tweak the scale and try to manipulate
[40:48] the scale
[40:49] no this scale is true
[40:53] amen there
[40:56] uh is a a a a a a a a
[40:59] life amen a perverted life
[41:03] amen won't tip the scale
[41:07] and a lot of times what people uh uh uh
[41:09] there's
[41:10] probably talking about there's two kinds
[41:12] of life there's a
[41:13] there's a life and there's a perverted
[41:15] life
[41:18] and that's what i was trying to get the
[41:19] young man on the outside to understand
[41:22] that's not life it's death dressed up
[41:26] to look like life it has
[41:30] no weight to it
[41:34] amen you know we have a covenant
[41:39] we have a promise in this hour
[41:42] amen but the prophet said
[41:45] in the token paragraph 125
[41:51] he say remember if
[41:54] that token was not displayed
[41:59] even the covenant was annulled
[42:05] when i read that i thought oh my god
[42:08] lord let me display the token
[42:12] even the covenant wasn't those he says
[42:14] that's right the covenant was a null
[42:17] there was no there was no covenant as
[42:20] long as the token
[42:21] wasn't there the token stood for
[42:25] the covenant god made a covenant with
[42:28] them yes sir
[42:29] but the token had to be it
[42:33] wasn't in effect the covenant wasn't
[42:36] unless the token was there
[42:40] and we read that the token was the
[42:42] evidence that the price has been paid
[42:45] amen that the scales of this balance was
[42:48] tipped
[42:48] in your favor amen you were no longer
[42:52] weighed in the balance of judgment and
[42:54] found
[42:55] in the negative amen in god's economy we
[42:59] always want to be
[43:00] a man on the right side we want to we
[43:02] want to we want this to
[43:04] the scales to lean all the way over amen
[43:07] we don't want to straddle the fence in
[43:09] this hour
[43:10] hey man we don't want to make excuses
[43:12] and we don't want to live a
[43:14] part-time christian life
[43:19] we want to go all the way with god we
[43:22] want the scales tipped in our favor
[43:27] amen the prophet said
[43:31] there might be uh many jews that say
[43:35] come here uh
[43:38] i i ain't got no blood on my door but
[43:41] let me show you
[43:42] i've been circumcised
[43:46] he says that don't mean nothing brother
[43:50] when i see the blood i'll pass over you
[43:56] he say uh uh you might say i'm a
[43:59] believer
[44:00] my mother was a believer my my mother
[44:03] was a member of this church
[44:06] my daddy was a member of this church
[44:09] i've been a member there since i was a
[44:12] child
[44:14] that don't mean that
[44:18] he says i don't lie i don't steal i
[44:22] don't do this
[44:23] i don't do that he says i don't mean
[44:27] that
[44:29] i belong to the branham tabernacle i do
[44:32] this
[44:33] or the other i believe
[44:37] all the word them jews
[44:40] could say i believe jehovah
[44:45] he listened to that message of the hour
[44:49] if he did
[44:50] certainly if he believed jehovah he'd
[44:53] listen to that message of the hour
[44:55] the message of the hour at that time was
[44:58] put the blood
[45:00] over the doorpost it wasn't enough
[45:04] to just be in egypt because see the time
[45:07] before
[45:08] salvation was just coming amen up under
[45:11] joseph
[45:12] and being in egypt and it sustained them
[45:15] that was salvation that i i i imagine
[45:18] you would call it the church of joseph
[45:22] amen we we we we come down here we
[45:24] belong to the church of joseph
[45:28] amen we we come to egypt who's your
[45:31] people they
[45:32] they they live down there in goshen and
[45:34] and they and
[45:35] and they all went to the church of
[45:36] joseph
[45:38] they was they were safe under under the
[45:41] protection of joseph because
[45:42] a man uh he was the second in charge
[45:46] and he brought all of his family in to
[45:48] the kingdom
[45:49] amen and and and took care of him so
[45:51] that was salvation
[45:53] at that time amen but the bible says
[45:57] there rosa pharaoh who knew not joseph
[46:01] things began to change
[46:05] amen and god sent a mighty deliverer
[46:08] amen it was time to move on time to move
[46:11] on in the gospel
[46:13] amen there was a there's a land out
[46:15] there flowing with milk and honey
[46:17] amen that is the baptism of the holy
[46:19] ghost
[46:22] amen and he had to get them to move out
[46:24] so to tend the hand of jehovah
[46:26] amen had to cause some things to go
[46:28] wrong down there in goshen
[46:32] if these things hadn't went down wrong
[46:34] down there in goshen and the pharaoh had
[46:36] to put the pressure on the people
[46:37] you know what they'd have been
[46:38] comfortable staying right there
[46:41] amen we was in our denominational
[46:43] churches and things like that if things
[46:45] hadn't
[46:45] gone wrong and things had we hadn't
[46:47] begun to see things going wrong and
[46:49] we would have been comfortable right
[46:51] there amen living in a world of sin if
[46:55] if things hadn't gone wrong and some of
[46:57] the things had they went wrong we'd have
[46:58] been comfortable still right there where
[47:00] we were
[47:03] amen but the ten day hand that you hope
[47:06] had to shake things up
[47:09] amen why because i got greater for you
[47:13] i have more for you things that you
[47:17] can't even
[47:18] fathom but what i have to do sometime is
[47:21] to get you to move
[47:22] amen i may have to uh a cause a little
[47:25] heartache
[47:27] you may have to go through some things
[47:29] and you may not understand it
[47:33] but it's the tender hand of jehovah
[47:36] moving you into a place why because you
[47:39] want to write the balance in your favor
[47:44] see the balance was not every now and
[47:47] then you
[47:47] you you get a little comfortable amen
[47:49] and and and a balance that was probably
[47:52] once like this you begin to
[47:54] the the weight of sin begins to kind of
[47:56] balance that thing out
[48:00] we don't want to die in that posit in
[48:02] that condition
[48:06] to be weighed in the balance to be found
[48:09] wanting
[48:11] in the economy of god amen
[48:15] we want the holy ghost and power we
[48:18] we're not
[48:18] we're living in a time where everybody
[48:20] wants power

[50:43] what are you without that covenant
[50:46] the wrath of god is upon you
[50:49] in other words you've been weighed in
[50:51] the balance
[50:53] all of that stuff all of those things
[50:56] they're good but it's gonna it's not
[51:00] enough to write the scales in your favor
[51:04] it's caught up with you see yeah your
[51:07] sins will find you out
[51:10] amen what is sin unbelief
[51:13] you've disbelieved the message
[51:17] you've disbelieved the word you've
[51:20] disbelieved
[51:21] the witness of the token itself
[51:24] when it's identified itself in the midst
[51:27] of us
[51:29] and you have disbelieved that
[51:32] no matter how much you believe it you
[51:34] disbelieve it
[51:36] it's got to be applied
[51:39] amen you might say i believe it
[51:42] i believe it i believe it's the truth i
[51:45] accept it
[51:46] as the truth then that's all good
[51:50] but yet it's got to be
[51:53] applied it's got to be
[51:57] on display amen
[52:02] it's got to be on display
[52:05] amen why this one jew standing there
[52:10] stirring the blood of the lamb was
[52:12] bleeding saying
[52:14] this is jehovah and there's still the
[52:18] priest saying yes sir
[52:20] i believe that's true but on his
[52:23] own house

[52:41] go do it
[52:42] but he hadn't applied it to his own
[52:44] house
[52:48] he's giving it out but he took he failed
[52:52] to apply it
[52:54] amen to his own house amen my brothers

[53:15] medicine they had uh he had a great army
[53:18] amen they were so he was so secure
[53:22] felt so secure don't ever get to a place

[54:20] me tell you something is getting real
[54:23] we are in a time
[54:28] where where where where
[54:31] it's it's always been real but
[54:35] the closer you get to to to to to the
[54:38] culmination
[54:39] or to the to to to the to the battle to
[54:42] the
[54:42] to the to the center of the battle to
[54:44] the culmination of all the events
[54:46] oh my god it just gets more and more
[54:47] real look at what
[54:50] pray for the people down there in fort
[54:51] lauderdale
[54:54] can you imagine laying in your bed at
[54:57] night
[54:58] going to bed

[55:04] but a lot of people didn't wake up and
[55:05] close i don't care what you say
[55:08] people ain't wake up here glory and no
[55:10] sense of lying to them people
[55:13] if their heart wasn't right with god
[55:15] they didn't wake up in glory
[55:16] if the if the ballot if the scale
[55:20] wasn't tipped in their favor they didn't
[55:21] wake up in glory
[55:27] didn't wake up in glory
[55:34] and this happened during pride month
[55:42] coincidence
[55:47] lord let me apply the blood the token
[55:50] and let it be applied amen so that if i
[55:55] ever find myself in a situation i'm not
[55:57] found wanting
[55:59] i want to keep my books balanced hey man
[56:02] i want to pay my i want to pay my debts
[56:05] i don't know oh i don't want to find
[56:07] myself owing you lord
[56:12] the weight of sin is heavy
[56:17] it's heavy so may i come to you lord and
[56:20] lay down my burdens
[56:22] amen receive what you have already
[56:24] carried to the cross lord
[56:26] amen and apply it amen let it let
[56:30] the world see that lord i i i i i
[56:34] i'm one of yours we read the scripture
[56:37] in corinthians that
[56:38] the weight what is this substance this
[56:40] substance something that's
[56:42] real but it's in our earthen vessel
[56:47] the only thing that's going to tilt me
[56:49] over amen is to have
[56:50] the the the the jesus the god
[56:54] jehovah on the inside
[57:00] other than that you're superficial
[57:04] there's no real weight to you the weight
[57:07] of sin is just going to tilt over
[57:10] i don't care how good how much good you
[57:12] do
[57:13] how much good you do in society
[57:17] how much you come to church how much we
[57:20] pass out tracks all of that is fine
[57:24] but it's not enough to write the scale
[57:28] of sin in your life you may not even you
[57:31] may not even commit sin
[57:33] but it's the sin of unbelief to reject
[57:37] the message of the
[57:38] hour well i go to church i got
[57:42] a good baptist preacher if you're not
[57:45] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:48] it's a superficial gospel it's not
[57:51] enough to just be going to church
[57:54] it's not enough well i read my bible
[57:56] that ain't enough
[58:01] you need to be there's if there's ever a
[58:04] time
[58:05] to seek the baptism of the holy
[58:09] ghost that's the token
[58:14] and that token must be displayed
[58:22] that token must be displayed
[58:26] you are deity on earth again
[58:30] amen you fight it if you want them
[58:35] attend the hand of jehovah
[58:39] i'll move you right into where you need
[58:40] to be
[58:42] amen i'm praying for the tender hand of
[58:44] jehovah
[58:47] well let me tell you something turn to
[58:48] the hand of jehovah is so tender
[58:53] but you know what it always
[58:57] it it it may seem hard
[59:00] but when you come through the battle and
[59:03] when you come
[59:04] through the struggle amen and when
[59:07] when he fill you with his presence and
[59:09] you look back from where you was
[59:11] amen to where you're at now you say
[59:14] thank you lord the tender hand of
[59:16] jehovah
[59:19] i was talking to those young men and i
[59:21] was a time when i was right where they
[59:23] were
[59:26] and here i am now can speak to them
[59:32] tender hand of jehovah had to go through
[59:35] some hard
[59:36] stuff had to go through some
[59:39] terrible trials
[59:42] but when you yield and you allow the
[59:44] holy spirit to
[59:46] nurture you and bring you up
[59:49] healing has no greater healing than the
[59:52] healing of your soul
[59:53] there's no greater healing amen than the
[59:56] healing of your mind
[1:00:02] spiritual amnesia has caused you to lose
[1:00:04] your balance
[1:00:07] your weight in the balance and final
[1:00:09] wanting
[1:00:13] you that i maybe uh uh uh well i i
[1:00:17] have my i got my church i go to i stay
[1:00:19] home and i read the bible i
[1:00:21] i stay home and i read the message books
[1:00:25] see the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:29] because the prophet said the holy ghost
[1:00:30] can't wait to get to church
[1:00:33] if you comfortable sitting home reading
[1:00:35] the message books i
[1:00:36] ain't going to say what you ain't got
[1:00:38] but all i know is the prophet said the
[1:00:39] holy ghost can't wait to get
[1:00:42] now let every man govern themselves you
[1:00:46] govern yourself
[1:00:50] i don't mean to want you to come and
[1:00:52] just and and
[1:00:53] and tear down your denomination or or or
[1:00:55] your club
[1:00:56] or your your your uh society
[1:01:01] you know maybe i'll do maybe y'all go
[1:01:03] out there we can feed feed the hungry
[1:01:07] but as i said earlier there's a we live
[1:01:10] in the
[1:01:11] in the richest country in the world
[1:01:13] there's a there's a
[1:01:15] we got a pantry and there's pantries all
[1:01:18] over the place so the one thing you're
[1:01:20] not
[1:01:20] you know you're not gonna go physically
[1:01:21] hungry in this country
[1:01:24] you ain't gonna go without clothes you
[1:01:25] go to the goodwill and they get close
[1:01:28] and people walking around naked
[1:01:32] and people walking around starving
[1:01:35] there's a famine
[1:01:37] a famine for the word of god
[1:01:40] there's a lack of clothes because the
[1:01:42] word of god is what clothes you
[1:01:47] and they're blind naked
[1:01:51] miserable and wretched and don't know it
[1:01:53] they need a healing of the mind
[1:01:59] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:03] will write the scale in your favor
[1:02:06] amen you don't want to be weighed in the
[1:02:08] balance and found wanting
[1:02:11] amen let's see how much time i got
[1:02:16] let's read on a little bit of this here
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] and they stood in the priests uh paul
[1:02:22] said i give my blood my body to be
[1:02:24] burned
[1:02:26] as they sacrifice
[1:02:29] give all the goods to feed the poor
[1:02:32] and have faith to move mountains and so
[1:02:35] forth and speak in tongues
[1:02:37] like men and angels and all those other
[1:02:41] things and said
[1:02:42] i am nothing until the token
[1:02:45] has been applied until this token
[1:02:48] that's what i'm speaking on tonight the
[1:02:51] love see
[1:02:52] now until this has been applied on
[1:02:56] nothing i don't care you might have
[1:03:00] cast out devils you might have healed
[1:03:02] the sick
[1:03:03] by your prayer of faith you might have
[1:03:06] done all these things
[1:03:09] but if that token is not there you are
[1:03:12] under the wrath of god
[1:03:15] you might be a believer you might stand
[1:03:19] in the pulpit and preach the gospel
[1:03:21] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:03:24] lord lord
[1:03:26] not uh have not i prophesied in your
[1:03:28] name
[1:03:29] preached in your name has not i cast out
[1:03:32] devils in your name
[1:03:35] that's both methodist baptist pentecost
[1:03:38] jesus said depart from me
[1:03:40] you workers of iniquity i never even
[1:03:43] knew you
[1:03:46] but when i see the token i'll pass over
[1:03:49] you
[1:03:50] it's god requirement of the hour
[1:03:54] the evening time message is
[1:03:58] to apply the token you want to know what
[1:04:01] the message is
[1:04:02] it is to apply the token satan has
[1:04:06] thrown
[1:04:06] all kinds of counterfeits of shaking
[1:04:09] hands and evidences
[1:04:11] and everything like that forget it
[1:04:15] the hour has arrived that the token
[1:04:17] itself
[1:04:18] not some counterfeit not make believe
[1:04:22] substitutionary thing anything
[1:04:25] the hour is here now the token himself
[1:04:29] is identifying himself right among us
[1:04:33] and proving that he is the same jesus to
[1:04:37] yesterday today and forever
[1:04:40] and he might with the word and he's
[1:04:44] right with
[1:04:45] the word it's got to be applied
[1:04:48] a man that says he's got the token and
[1:04:51] deny this word
[1:04:54] then what about it see you can't do it
[1:04:58] the token has got to be there
[1:05:03] when i the blood shall be a token unto
[1:05:06] you

[1:05:11] in the blood is a token unto you
