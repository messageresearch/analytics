[1:10:44] 1953 August 30th the prophet preached a
[1:10:48] message why I a Holy
[1:10:53] Roller and in that message Mage
[1:10:56] there uh if you can around paragraph 59
[1:11:01] I'm a little bit prior to
[1:11:03] that it says I
[1:11:07] looked and I passed an Old
[1:11:10] Forest where it used to be a great
[1:11:13] towering
[1:11:15] ponds but a burnover had come years ago
[1:11:19] and burnt it all down and it was just a
[1:11:24] big bunch of it looked like
[1:11:27] spooky great big old white trees the
[1:11:32] moon shining down against them and them
[1:11:36] just parched
[1:11:39] white and they came a wind
[1:11:43] blowing down through the mountains and
[1:11:46] all them trees was
[1:11:48] doing making the most
[1:11:51] wonderful sound of who
[1:11:55] ooh and I thought oh my what a spooky
[1:12:02] place then the scripture come to mind
[1:12:05] what the Palmer worm
[1:12:07] left the caterpillar had eaten what the
[1:12:11] caterpillar left the Locust had
[1:12:14] eaten but that was his church I thought
[1:12:19] truly Lord after the Reformation back
[1:12:22] Yonder what the Methodist
[1:12:26] Catholics left the fundamentalists
[1:12:30] eaten what the fundamentalists left the
[1:12:34] Presbyterians have
[1:12:37] eaten what the Presbyterians left the
[1:12:40] Baptists have eaten what the Baptists
[1:12:44] left the nazarenes have
[1:12:47] eaten until they eat the thing
[1:12:51] down but I will restore say say the Lord
[1:12:57] hallelujah God's going to have a church
[1:13:01] I will restore sayith the
[1:13:04] Lord he says I stood and
[1:13:08] wondered and he God sending that wind
[1:13:11] down and all of those big old
[1:13:14] trees was doing going woo
[1:13:18] woo I thought that's exactly like that
[1:13:22] Mighty rushing wind that came down from
[1:13:26] heaven at the day of Pentecost when it
[1:13:29] strikes them big old churches like that
[1:13:32] he says around
[1:13:35] Chicago man referencing them to Old
[1:13:39] burnt
[1:13:41] trees with no life in them right they
[1:13:46] had been eaten down amen by
[1:13:51] denominationalism to where there was no
[1:13:54] leaves
[1:13:55] right amen and we're reminded that the
[1:13:57] leaves are what the fellowship yes sir
[1:14:01] true amen all of the all of the love was
[1:14:06] burnt
[1:14:08] out there was no life
[1:14:11] there so I thought just exactly he says
[1:14:15] the mighty Russian wind that come down
[1:14:17] at the day of Pentecost when it strikes
[1:14:18] some old
[1:14:20] churches like that around Chicago and
[1:14:23] the only thing I can here is mourn and
[1:14:27] cry and
[1:14:29] say the days of Miracles have passed
[1:14:33] see the gifts were
[1:14:35] gone they didn't even believe in the
[1:14:38] gifts
[1:14:40] anymore so that they got to a point they
[1:14:42] believe that that that day was
[1:14:49] over paragraph 6 it say
[1:14:52] fundamental they are trees yes

[1:14:58] once uh they was once a tree the
[1:15:02] Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian
[1:15:06] the moodies and all the
[1:15:09] rest they've got great big towering
[1:15:13] spires but they say the days of Miracles
[1:15:17] have passed because the Palmer worm has
[1:15:20] eaten all the blessings out of the
[1:15:23] church till their no

[1:50:30] relationship we have with one
[1:50:33] another as we grow in God Amen as we
[1:50:37] grow together now see it's a growing
[1:50:41] process sometime we make
[1:50:44] mistakes every if a child has a as a
[1:50:47] child you expect them to make mistakes
[1:50:49] along the way am it's a growth process
[1:50:52] let go the bitterness amen Amen Let It
[1:50:58] Go let it I'm sure you can look back and
[1:51:01] say some of those mistakes you
[1:51:04] made Let It Go press on to the mark of
[1:51:08] the High Calling amen amen Don't Look
[1:51:12] Back press on press
[1:51:14] forward that's it amen
[1:51:24] let's move on here Zechariah
[1:51:29] 13 I think I just read that six and one
[1:51:32] shall say unto him what are those wounds
[1:51:36] in thine hands then he answer those
[1:51:40] which I received those which I was
[1:51:42] wounded in the house of my
[1:51:46] friends Christ at his second
[1:51:51] coming amen
[1:51:54] during the Old
[1:51:56] Testament he was God the Father who
[1:52:00] suffered rejection but during the New
[1:52:03] Testament he came as a flesh man so not
[1:52:08] only his heart was able to be wounded
[1:52:11] but they was able to wound his
[1:52:14] flesh
[1:52:16] see his scars in his head from when they
[1:52:19] pressed the reef the spear in the s side
[1:52:23] the nail in his feet they
[1:52:25] wounded where amongst his own people
[1:52:29] amen so do we think we're any better
[1:52:31] than him
[1:52:33] no did he hold any bitterness he say
[1:52:36] father forgive him for they know not
[1:52:39] what they do and he loves them all he
[1:52:41] Lov them
[1:52:42] anyhow
[1:52:44] amen so whether there's
[1:52:47] bitterness there's a lack of
[1:52:50] forgiveness it's because of the lack of
[1:52:52] love of God because love beareth all
[1:52:57] things love endureth all things love is
[1:53:04] kind when it has not been kind
[1:53:12] to love is kind when it has not been
[1:53:16] kind
[1:53:18] to amen amen
[1:53:23] John
[1:53:24] 1335 says by this shall men
[1:53:29] know that ye are my disciples when ye
[1:53:33] have love one for another amen and it's
[1:53:38] easy to love people that are kind
[1:53:41] towards you right true almost anyone can
[1:53:44] do
[1:53:45] that but it's a real test of that
[1:53:49] love of God in your heart when a person
[1:53:53] is not kind to you and you continue to
[1:53:56] be kind to
[1:53:57] them amen amen
[1:54:00] amen when a person has been mean to you
[1:54:04] but you still be kind to
[1:54:08] them
[1:54:09] amen God has divined a purpose for every
[1:54:13] trial and every struggle in our
[1:54:15] life amen it's all for a
[1:54:19] purpose it's all for our development yes
[1:54:22] yes so think these fiery STS not strange
[1:54:25] that we go through yes you have to
[1:54:28] overcome them I guarantee you well you
[1:54:30] say well I've been hurt here you go
[1:54:32] somewhere else guess

[1:54:45] human nature yes sir yes sir and that
[1:54:49] human nature amen has uh uh all kind of
[1:54:53] things that come with it that make you
[1:54:55] hurt people right true brother that's
[1:54:58] why we have to be born again and take on
[1:55:00] another
[1:55:02] nature but you still trapped in this Pet
[1:55:04] house and every now and
[1:55:06] then you going to hurt some you that is
[1:55:10] you
[1:55:11] sticky you
[1:55:14] sticky and you going to rub somebody the
[1:55:16] wrong way or somebody going to rub you
[1:55:18] the wrong way

[2:08:18] embra praise the Lord
[2:08:21] God bless
[2:08:23] you what a
[2:08:27] message sometimes we don't realize
[2:08:30] that how much we need one
[2:08:34] another we carry a lot of burdens simply
[2:08:39] because we don't pay
[2:08:41] attention we don't pay attention to our
[2:08:44] brother and
[2:08:45] sister sometimes they're struggling
[2:08:47] they're
[2:08:49] hurting and we're not s
[2:08:54] sensitive one way to be more sensitive
[2:08:56] is to
[2:08:58] pray you can't help but love somebody
[2:09:00] you're praying for and sometimes I I
[2:09:03] think we're not praying enough
[2:09:06] am just earlier this
[2:09:09] week in my devotions
[2:09:12] just thinking on David and watching his
[2:09:15] life and and
[2:09:17] seeing him growing as a shepherd and
[2:09:19] then become a musician and a singer and
[2:09:23] then becoming a a captain over thousands
[2:09:26] and
[2:09:28] hundreds being in the Army and later
[2:09:31] becoming King in a different hat it made
[2:09:34] me think of brother
[2:09:36] Troy and I was like my god brother Troy
[2:09:39] is just like
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:42] David you'll see him on the drums you'll
[2:09:44] see him on the
[2:09:45] base you'll see him as a deacon you'll
[2:09:48] watch him preach something's going on in
[2:09:50] church brother Troy is there and I just
[2:09:53] got to praying for brother Troy I didn't
[2:09:55] know he had the thing in his mind Lord
[2:09:58] what would you have me do but we see
[2:10:01] what the Lord had for
[2:10:03] him we call him the the ram in the
[2:10:07] bush because he always steps in when
[2:10:10] there's a
[2:10:11] need brother Troy steps in it's not
[2:10:15] because he just wants to do it but it's
[2:10:18] because he loves you
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:21] and I don't think we should act in a way
[2:10:24] where his love is not in
[2:10:26] vain if he gets up here and he pours out
[2:10:29] his heart and and wants you to have the
[2:10:32] love of God in your heart for one
[2:10:34] another let's make that happen pray for
[2:10:38] one another talk to one
[2:10:40] another find out what's what the need is
[2:10:44] that somebody has and meet that need
