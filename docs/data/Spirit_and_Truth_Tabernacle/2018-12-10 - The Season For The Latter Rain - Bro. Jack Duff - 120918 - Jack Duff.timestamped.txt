[1:00:52] then James chapter 5 is where I'd like
[1:00:56] to meet our first scripture James 5 and
[1:01:02] then my second scripture is gonna come
[1:01:05] from the book of Zechariah chapter 10 a
[1:01:07] man James chapter 5 verse 17 praise the
[1:01:14] Lord
[1:01:14] a man says Elijah was a man subject to
[1:01:21] like passions as we are and he went and
[1:01:25] he any period honestly that it might not
[1:01:28] rain and it rained not on the earth by
[1:01:31] the space of three years and six months
[1:01:33] and he prayed again and the heaven gave
[1:01:38] rain the earth brought forth her fruit
[1:01:41] also turn with me to Zechariah 10 verse
[1:01:51] 1 says askee of the Lord rain in the
[1:02:00] time of the latter rain so the Lord
[1:02:04] shall make bright clouds and give them
[1:02:08] showers of rain to everyone grass in the
[1:02:12] field they meant the Lord and a blessing
[1:02:15] up to the reading of his word let's just
[1:02:17] run free the word of Prayer father we
[1:02:19] thank you for this privilege and
[1:02:22] opportunity to read the word is also a
[1:02:24] privilege to be able to stand and the
[1:02:27] corpse in the house of the Lord how
[1:02:30] grateful we are for all things that have
[1:02:32] happened amen the various songs that
[1:02:35] have gone forth
[1:02:36] and well we just appreciate the time of
[1:02:39] worship the the song leading even from
[1:02:43] the first note that was played on the
[1:02:45] keyboard we know that you were involved
[1:02:48] in it and father we just trust that as
[1:02:51] we enter now into a little fault here
[1:02:54] today that you were blessed us as the
[1:02:57] scripture promised showers of blessing
[1:03:00] God let it uh come upon us even on today
[1:03:03] we invite you now to take control over
[1:03:06] this portion of the service and every
[1:03:07] spirit that's against your spirit God we
[1:03:10] find it now according to the word of the
[1:03:12] Lord that gives us power to bind a man
[1:03:15] and to loose who told us what we bound
[1:03:17] on earth shall be bound in heaven what
[1:03:18] we loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:03:20] heaven
[1:03:20] so that we exercise our authority and
[1:03:23] take control of every spirit that is
[1:03:24] against the Spirit of God it's in the
[1:03:26] mighty name of Jesus that we pray amen
[1:03:29] and amen god bless you amen you can be
[1:03:32] seated
[1:03:44] this monitor is just a little too hot
[1:03:47] for me hear a little sound coming out of
[1:03:50] it
[1:03:51] I want to just take a man for our topic
[1:03:57] today the season for laddering a man the
[1:04:02] season for latter rain this is a little
[1:04:08] subject that has been in my heart for
[1:04:11] man over a year and and actually I am I
[1:04:17] I remember preaching on this back in I
[1:04:22] don't know his number of years ago but
[1:04:23] ASCII of the Lord rain I preached there
[1:04:25] and but I just I've just been noticing a
[1:04:29] few things and we took the scripture
[1:04:32] Zechariah 10 and we sent it out to the
[1:04:35] brothers amen prayer meeting this week
[1:04:38] and this was the scripture that we were
[1:04:40] using to pray over a ski of the Lord
[1:04:44] rain in the time of the latter ring and
[1:04:47] one of the things that I that I had
[1:04:49] noticed is it seems like there's a
[1:04:52] number of things that we've been praying
[1:04:54] for over the year and I have watched God
[1:04:56] answer those prayers a man I've watched
[1:04:59] him you know I mean we've been praying
[1:05:01] for people to be blessed with cars and
[1:05:04] homes and jobs and you know whatever a
[1:05:06] lot of natural blessings I've just seen
[1:05:08] God just making Wayne a man God has done
[1:05:11] some supernatural things for us this
[1:05:13] year and and I'm very grateful but I'm
[1:05:16] also mindful the fact that if God is
[1:05:19] answering our natural requests a man
[1:05:23] then I'm also an expectation for God to
[1:05:26] do something with our spiritual requests
[1:05:29] and wanted a spiritual request that we
[1:05:31] keep on our list is we constantly ask
[1:05:33] God for fillings and reef fillings of
[1:05:36] the Holy Ghost amen and and I'm the
[1:05:41] reason that you know I feel like the
[1:05:43] season for this particular sermon has
[1:05:45] come as you know we were you know I was
[1:05:48] last we got law which sermon do I go
[1:05:50] with do I go with this one or do I go
[1:05:52] it's settled it and
[1:05:53] and the Lord you know said go what
[1:05:55] settle it and we did that and I was
[1:05:57] grateful because I saw different people
[1:05:59] actually settling amen
[1:06:02] on last Sunday and and so what's this
[1:06:04] once it's settled
[1:06:06] hallelujah well once you've made a
[1:06:09] commitment a man that you go you gonna
[1:06:13] give you all to the Lord's a man once
[1:06:16] you've done that the Bible actually
[1:06:17] tells us that amen
[1:06:19] Satan will leave and not and what he
[1:06:23] does is that he'll come back amen to a
[1:06:26] house and if the house has a resident
[1:06:31] hallelujah if the house has a resident
[1:06:34] then the devil realizes he's not welcome
[1:06:38] Amen that the eviction notice that he
[1:06:41] received was real and you cannot come
[1:06:46] back to this place that you once lived
[1:06:48] in but if he finds the place empty
[1:06:52] hallelujah then he comes back with seven
[1:06:55] other devils and the last estate is
[1:06:57] greater or worse than the first estate
[1:07:00] so it's so important that this time Amen
[1:07:03] we ask God three hallelujah and I'm
[1:07:10] declaring that this is the season for it
[1:07:12] because amen no matter how much you want
[1:07:14] to settle it you came do it and good
[1:07:16] will you can't do it in a with with just
[1:07:20] good intentions you got to be able to do
[1:07:22] this with the Holy Goose colony so when
[1:07:26] were asking God for latter way we're
[1:07:28] asking God for a down pouring outpouring
[1:07:32] of the Holy Ghost and I know the coach
[1:07:35] and everybody ask you of the Lord rain
[1:07:38] Lord let it rain let it rain in here and
[1:07:42] let me tell you something about winged
[1:07:44] way don't care whether you a sinner
[1:07:47] All Saints everybody go get it back to
[1:07:52] the ring if natural way will affect
[1:07:57] everybody out there why can't spiritual
[1:07:59] ring affect anybody inside
[1:08:03] ha I believe it's gonna happen because
[1:08:06] they were gathered in the upper room
[1:08:08] what the Sababa say they will feel with
[1:08:13] the Holy Ghost whether you want it or
[1:08:16] not you don't get it anyway because
[1:08:18] you're in the right place at the right
[1:08:22] time I'm asking God for rain this is the
[1:08:29] season for rain
[1:08:30] we need the ring we need the rain
[1:08:34] I don't want to see the up-and-down
[1:08:37] anymore I don't want to see the in and
[1:08:40] out anymore but the only way we can get
[1:08:43] that if people have to get rain the seed
[1:08:46] has been planted but now we need some
[1:08:48] moisture in order for the seed to grow
[1:08:51] it must have ring amen hallelujah glory
[1:08:56] to God see you know we know that the the
[1:08:59] letter the the the the Spirit gives life
[1:09:03] see I mean the letter the letter itself
[1:09:05] it will die but we need to go with the
[1:09:08] letter and what we had last week is a
[1:09:10] lot of people say Lord I'm selling it
[1:09:12] today they think they actually turned in
[1:09:14] their resignation letters they told the
[1:09:18] devil I'm resigning from sin
[1:09:20] I'm tired of you I mean this this debt
[1:09:24] that you got me
[1:09:25] amen I've added this and I've added that
[1:09:27] and I've added this and made my tab is
[1:09:30] getting pretty high here but I gotta
[1:09:33] settle this thing and then you look at
[1:09:35] the bill oh my god you ever you know our
[1:09:39] little story of a you know look couple
[1:09:42] went out to eat two couples it may went
[1:09:44] out to eat together and you know they
[1:09:47] were just ordering and ordering and you
[1:09:48] know and then they are one couple said
[1:09:50] well we'll take care of the tab when it
[1:09:52] comes and the waiter brought them
[1:09:54] brought them to check and they looked at
[1:09:57] and say oh we'll take care of half of it
[1:09:59] right because they realized they didn't
[1:10:02] have enough money to take care to check
[1:10:03] and when you realize your debt of sin is
[1:10:05] so high a man your mama can't pay this
[1:10:08] your daddy can't pay this
[1:10:10] now let you can't even pay this you got
[1:10:14] knees
[1:10:15] body to settle this thing play in Jesus
[1:10:17] Christ has settled it somebody I mean I
[1:10:21] saw people lift their hands in the
[1:10:23] presence of the Lord say I'm selling
[1:10:24] this thing this weekend and then I and
[1:10:27] I'm so happy about that but I realized
[1:10:29] that if we don't go further and receive
[1:10:31] the Baptist or all the ghosts then we'll
[1:10:33] go right back into the same state that
[1:10:35] we were in so that's why I'm saying this
[1:10:37] is the season a man to ask for a lot of
[1:10:40] rain amen
[1:10:42] this is the season for latter rain now
[1:10:45] let me you know we were we were praying
[1:10:48] that oh this week and just the brothers
[1:10:51] we you know I told them you know what
[1:10:52] what we wanted to just kind of start
[1:10:54] praying about and we was over here in
[1:10:55] this little nursing we just start
[1:10:56] praying and everybody start calling out
[1:10:59] for ladder rain and and Lord just let it
[1:11:01] rain praying for the Holy Ghost to move
[1:11:03] inside the church and the sisters was
[1:11:05] gathered on the other side and before
[1:11:06] you know we heard the sisters over there
[1:11:07] clapping their hands and worship in and
[1:11:09] I say Lord it's raining God is raining
[1:11:12] in here and we began to praise God for
[1:11:15] the rain hallelujah and and I need you
[1:11:17] to understand the rain was coming from a
[1:11:19] prayer meeting Oh glory the rain was
[1:11:24] coming from a prayer meeting we're gonna
[1:11:26] get into that a little bit later
[1:11:27] Amen but we must see that this is
[1:11:29] important hallelujah you you know you
[1:11:32] realize that Elijah's top ring with
[1:11:36] prayer and Elijah bring back with prayer
[1:11:42] hallelujah a man soso church with the
[1:11:45] prayer meeting is is important active
[1:11:48] preppy the prayer meeting is just as
[1:11:50] important as Sunday morning
[1:11:52] the partying is just as important as
[1:11:54] Wednesday nights the poor meeting is a
[1:11:56] very important service because that's
[1:11:59] where the rain starts I'm going to show
[1:12:01] you that in Scripture lord help us today
[1:12:05] amen but that's where the rain starts
[1:12:08] and another thing we found out this
[1:12:10] morning is that you know the devil uses
[1:12:12] a trick to try to get us to worship God
[1:12:14] silently
[1:12:18] that that's a trick of the enemy to try
[1:12:21] to get us the worship God silently you
[1:12:24] know the devil is the one that tells you
[1:12:26] you're gonna be embarrassed God don't
[1:12:29] tell you that you're gonna be
[1:12:30] embarrassed the devil tells you that and
[1:12:32] you can't listen to the devil where God
[1:12:35] struck your heart you gotta you gotta
[1:12:36] you gotta exercise a man some some some
[1:12:39] praise back to him
[1:12:41] thank you Jesus glory to God amen don't
[1:12:45] be ashamed to give God glory he the one
[1:12:47] that gave you your breath he the one
[1:12:50] that gave you your strip he the one that
[1:12:53] gave you your job he's the one doing all
[1:12:55] these things so don't be afraid to give
[1:12:58] him praise come on church it's a trick
[1:13:02] of the enemy to get us the worship God
[1:13:05] silently come to give them priests all
[1:13:10] right I want to just kind of share a
[1:13:12] couple of things and I remember this the
[1:13:15] seeds in falada rain lift the season
[1:13:18] Ford I got a couple of things I just
[1:13:20] need to share first I want to read from
[1:13:22] a little a website that I found some
[1:13:25] information now this this morning I was
[1:13:30] listening and from the first note that
[1:13:32] was played the first song today was Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit rain on us right first first song
[1:13:38] we come out the gate with Holy Spirit
[1:13:40] rain on us and then from that I heard
[1:13:42] Holy Spirit rain down right so as I
[1:13:46] start looking I said Lord here it is
[1:13:47] it's time right into the sermon for the
[1:13:50] day amen
[1:13:51] the season for latter rain watch this
[1:13:55] down you know and now in Israel rain is
[1:14:00] extremely important right in Israel we
[1:14:03] found out that rain is it's very
[1:14:05] important the other thing I found out a
[1:14:07] man is that in Jerusalem out of 365 days
[1:14:12] a year rain only happens about 44 days
[1:14:16] out of 365 days a year
[1:14:19] right and you know so so so for them
[1:14:22] when rain comes our width or actual
[1:14:24] impetus rate when the season for rain
[1:14:27] comes they begin to get desperate
[1:14:30] because they realize if they don't get
[1:14:33] rain then that it might mean death many
[1:14:36] times you find in Scripture that many of
[1:14:38] them will have to leave the Land of
[1:14:39] Israel a family was set in because they
[1:14:42] did not get rain rain was extremely
[1:14:45] important so they have they have sisters
[1:14:47] just about every mountain multiple
[1:14:49] sisters there to try to capture the rain
[1:14:51] as it comes and they used it as a
[1:14:53] reservoir hallelujah amen they need that
[1:14:57] reservoir in order to sustain them
[1:14:59] throughout the year until the next
[1:15:01] season comes you gonna need a reservoir
[1:15:04] amen and sustain you until the next
[1:15:06] season comes hallelujah and what we
[1:15:10] found out in Israel is that their rainy
[1:15:13] season amen is the month of January
[1:15:17] December January February that's their
[1:15:19] rainy season come on somebody we are in
[1:15:23] the month of December right now
[1:15:25] hallelujah so so when we look at this
[1:15:28] scripture it is literal this is the
[1:15:32] season for rain that the people in
[1:15:37] Israel they rejoice when rain happens
[1:15:39] you know I was reading this little
[1:15:41] article here and it said you know
[1:15:43] because Israel's water supply is so
[1:15:45] dependent on rainfall Israelis hope pray
[1:15:48] and beg the heavens for winter rains it
[1:15:53] says a particularly torrential rain is
[1:15:56] known as a ringing of blessing so when
[1:15:59] they get a torrential rain would say
[1:16:00] which they actually just had some a
[1:16:02] couple of people lost their lives
[1:16:03] because of some of the flooding that
[1:16:04] they had over there in certain parts of
[1:16:06] Israel he said but when they get a
[1:16:07] mentor torrential rain it is known as a
[1:16:10] raining of blessing listen and Hebrew so
[1:16:14] you won't hear anybody cook grumble
[1:16:17] about a rainy day there in Israel not
[1:16:20] even a little children complain about
[1:16:21] rain now you know that this this guy
[1:16:24] goes on the kind of riding them saying
[1:16:25] how you know when they first arrived
[1:16:28] there in Israel there was there was at
[1:16:29] their house and and there was a local
[1:16:32] school in the area where they live and
[1:16:33] one day they just heard all this noise
[1:16:35] you know all these kids come running out
[1:16:37] of the school in there trying to figure
[1:16:38] out what is going on why why are the
[1:16:41] kids a man acting like this and
[1:16:44] what happens that you know they stepped
[1:16:45] outside the seeing and the kids were
[1:16:48] actually rejoicing because of the rain I
[1:16:52] like that I like when the children can
[1:16:57] rejoice because of rain I don't we got
[1:17:02] it
[1:17:02] but in this season I'm looking for the
[1:17:06] children
[1:17:07] Oh hallelujah I'm looking for the young
[1:17:11] people to have an experience in this
[1:17:14] season and they begin to rejoice because
[1:17:17] of rain
[1:17:18] oh we will see mamma rejoice we are
[1:17:22] seeing that every to us but let the
[1:17:25] children break loose let the children
[1:17:28] experience God hallelujah somebody
[1:17:32] that's what we're asking God for our
[1:17:35] children experience it Oh glory to God
[1:17:39] this is the season for CH now let me
[1:17:42] just kind of go on a little further here
[1:17:44] a man this is coming out of the message
[1:17:48] resume of the ages resume of the ages
[1:17:52] glory to God thank you Lord Jesus all
[1:17:58] right it says this this age started just
[1:18:02] after the turn of the 20th century as it
[1:18:04] was to be the age in which the true
[1:18:07] church will return to being the bride
[1:18:10] she was at Pentecost we know that there
[1:18:15] must of necessity be a return of dynamic
[1:18:20] power right a man see I mean we got to
[1:18:24] have the dynamics to go along with these
[1:18:25] mechanics so it must be a return of
[1:18:28] dynamic power now let me also just get
[1:18:31] make sure we understand this this is not
[1:18:33] something that we're trying to
[1:18:35] manufacture this is not something that
[1:18:38] we're trying to make happen but what I
[1:18:40] am trying to get you to see is that we
[1:18:42] are in the season of it so when you
[1:18:44] enter the season of it you begin to get
[1:18:46] under expectation hallelujah amen
[1:18:50] just like the Israelis when they get
[1:18:52] into the season of winter they expect
[1:18:54] rain they begin to pray for rain right
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:57] and when rain comes they rejoice in the
[1:18:59] rain this is the way we need to be
[1:19:01] expect rain and rejoice when rain comes
[1:19:04] young people let me just say let me just
[1:19:07] kind of break it down this way if you
[1:19:08] see the Spirit of God moved everybody in
[1:19:11] here can tell when the atmosphere shifts
[1:19:12] I don't care how old you are how young
[1:19:15] you are you can tell when the atmosphere
[1:19:18] shifts saw my encouragement to you when
[1:19:21] the atmosphere atmosphere shifts in turn
[1:19:24] and don't just look at it God is coming
[1:19:28] down to do something special for you
[1:19:30] that's it if they make you cry fine
[1:19:34] if you make yourself fine if it make you
[1:19:37] jump fine if it make you run fine if it
[1:19:40] make you speak in tongues fine that's
[1:19:44] exactly what we are looking for
[1:19:49] hallelujah Lord sin the rain amen listen
[1:19:53] so he say said we know that there must
[1:19:55] of necessity be a return of dynamic
[1:19:58] power the believers sense this in their
[1:20:02] spirits and began crying to God for a
[1:20:06] new outpouring such as was in the first
[1:20:08] century now we're going to go on amen in
[1:20:10] this quote and read a little bit more of
[1:20:12] how the the you know this was actually
[1:20:14] the Pentecostals right before the
[1:20:17] Pentecostal committee organization got
[1:20:19] started they began to sense that a move
[1:20:22] of God was a man what's supposed to
[1:20:24] happen
[1:20:24] they begin to sense that experience in
[1:20:27] and when they sensed it the next thing
[1:20:29] they did was begin to pray and if I can
[1:20:33] just get the church to sense that this
[1:20:36] is the season for then everybody will
[1:20:39] begin to play come on you know you need
[1:20:42] God to touch your child you know your
[1:20:45] you know your child needs the Holy Ghost
[1:20:47] right you you know that and without it
[1:20:50] they not gonna make it well I don't care
[1:20:52] how much you explain this and explain
[1:20:54] that without the spirit that child is
[1:20:56] not gonna make it and God don't have
[1:20:59] grandchildren they can't give you know
[1:21:01] your experience they got ahead
[1:21:04] own experience why not have it that when
[1:21:06] you invite one of your backflip children
[1:21:09] searched at this reining in here but you
[1:21:13] know one that gotta create that
[1:21:14] atmosphere hallelujah we want them all
[1:21:19] to be soaked when they leave here God's
[1:21:23] it rang rang we meet Moisture come on
[1:21:28] somebody the believer since this in
[1:21:33] their spirits and began crying to God
[1:21:35] for a new outpouring such as was in the
[1:21:39] first century I'm going on what seemed
[1:21:41] to be the answer came as many began to
[1:21:44] speak in tongues and manifest gifts of
[1:21:47] the Spirit now now that seemed to be the
[1:21:48] answer but that does not negate the fact
[1:21:51] that we should experience that in the
[1:21:53] church Amen we still should see the
[1:21:55] speaking in tongues in the manifestation
[1:21:57] of the gifts and I'm going a little
[1:21:59] further amen I'm looking for that in the
[1:22:01] fourth generation I'm looking for the
[1:22:04] manifestation of the gifts in the fourth
[1:22:06] generation I've seen it in my generation
[1:22:08] but now I'm looking for a man in the
[1:22:10] fourth generation not just to come and
[1:22:13] leave but something to come and stick
[1:22:18] hallelujah I know the gifts are there
[1:22:20] but we got to anoint this it man says
[1:22:22] listen he says manifest gifts of the
[1:22:24] Spirit it was but it was then believed
[1:22:26] that this was indeed the long-awaited
[1:22:29] restoration it was not for the latter
[1:22:32] rain can come only after the formal rain
[1:22:36] which is the spring or teaching ring
[1:22:38] right the latter rain then is the
[1:22:41] harvest rain how could this be the real
[1:22:44] thing when the teach and rain had not
[1:22:46] come so what he said as a prophet had
[1:22:48] not been sick so Pentecost has started
[1:22:51] out before the prophet went out on the
[1:22:52] field so all they had a man was a
[1:22:55] harvest ring right amen a form of rain
[1:22:58] but but what we're looking for is the
[1:22:59] Lateran the teaching has come hallelujah
[1:23:02] so we're promised that I have both a
[1:23:05] former and latter rain that's the season
[1:23:08] that we're in listen to this he says how
[1:23:11] could this be the real thing when the
[1:23:13] teach and rain had not come the Prophet
[1:23:15] messenger who was who
[1:23:17] was to be sent to teach the people and
[1:23:19] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:23:21] the Pentecostal father's had not yet
[1:23:23] come thus what was thought to be the
[1:23:27] restoration and the final friend of
[1:23:29] quickening unto the rapture hat and I
[1:23:30] come now I want to make sure we get it
[1:23:32] clear what Pentecost hat was real hey
[1:23:35] man what Pentecost had Amen the
[1:23:37] manifestation of gifts that was real
[1:23:39] that was a platform that God was
[1:23:41] building from right but but what
[1:23:43] happened is that they first took the
[1:23:44] word hallelujah Amen what the Lutheran's
[1:23:47] hat was right what the method is hat
[1:23:49] that it was right they had a portion of
[1:23:51] it they did not have all of it now we
[1:23:53] got all of it hallelujah and that's why
[1:23:57] I want I want to make sure I you know I
[1:24:00] put emphasis on it we ought to expect
[1:24:02] every gift that God put in the Bible to
[1:24:06] be manifested right here on this Amen if
[1:24:09] we're not seeing it something on it we
[1:24:11] ought to keep praying we got to keep
[1:24:13] praying until we see God do what he did
[1:24:15] in Scripture if our hearts have been
[1:24:18] turned back to the world why can't we
[1:24:20] have what's in the word I'm a sad again
[1:24:24] if our hearts have been turned back to
[1:24:27] the Lord why can't we have what is in
[1:24:30] the word I'm on the expectation for and
[1:24:34] this is the season that I'm declaring it
[1:24:37] in Israel their rainy season is December
[1:24:40] January this sermon goes forth in
[1:24:43] December I'm looking for something to

[1:27:25] says the hearts of children back to the
[1:27:28] Pentecostal father's had not yet come
[1:27:29] thus what was thought to be the
[1:27:31] restoration and the final quickening
[1:27:33] unto the rapture had not come he says in
[1:27:35] it was a mixture of unrighteous
[1:27:37] particular spiritual blessing and
[1:27:39] manifested in the Holy Ghost as we have
[1:27:41] kept pointing out to you
[1:27:42] and it also was devil power as men were
[1:27:45] under the control of Devils yet no one
[1:27:48] seemed to realize it then to prove that
[1:27:51] it was not the real these people even
[1:27:53] before second generation that appear
[1:27:55] organized and wrote their unscripted
[1:27:58] doctrines and built their own fences as
[1:28:00] every other group of Hell ahead ahead of
[1:28:03] them did now you know we're not looking
[1:28:05] for for that to try to start some new
[1:28:08] group after a man the rain falls no we
[1:28:10] just stay right with the word expecting
[1:28:12] what God promised us hallelujah
[1:28:14] hallelujah we know that we've received
[1:28:16] the teaching rain amen we know brother
[1:28:18] Branham brought that teaching rain so
[1:28:20] now we're under expectation for amen in
[1:28:23] the latter rain now let's look at
[1:28:25] something here let's look at a scripture
[1:28:27] Joel to a man verse 21

[1:28:51] will do great things anybody believe
[1:28:54] that a man I'm talking about spiritually
[1:28:57] because we've seen the natural blesses
[1:28:58] but the Lord gonna do something great
[1:28:59] spiritually a man say fear not ol and be
[1:29:02] glad and rejoice for the Lord will do
[1:29:04] great things

[1:29:39] for it supposed to happen in the first
[1:29:43] month we put ourselves in Scripture
[1:29:46] right so so here God is setting this
[1:29:48] thing up so we ought to be under
[1:29:50] expectation for something to happen
[1:29:53] in the first month Oh hallelujah Church

[1:31:02] can expect restoration did you get that
[1:31:06] church this is a season to expect it
[1:31:09] right notice this this is what God don't
[1:31:12] do right this is not this is not you
[1:31:15] making this happen this is a promise
[1:31:17] from God and all you got to do is is
[1:31:18] rest on it I will restore to you the
[1:31:23] years that the locusts have eaten and
[1:31:28] see this is a whole nother sermon I
[1:31:30] can't get into all this but the years
[1:31:32] that the locusts have eaten the cake of

[1:32:08] 28 and it shall come to pass afterward
[1:32:12] that I will pour out my spirit upon him

[1:32:19] right time I'm going to plop my spirit

[1:32:27] daughters

[1:32:32] be touched by this oh I'm not looking
[1:32:35] for another move of the Spirit well only
[1:32:37] the older people are retorted this is
[1:32:39] something where everybody gonna get it
[1:32:42] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:32:44] prophesy right amen
[1:32:47] your old men shall dream dreams and your
[1:32:49] young men shall see visions and also
[1:32:52] from the service of from the hand mates
[1:32:53] in those days will I pour out my spirit
[1:32:56] let's go and I will show wonders in the
[1:32:59] heavens and in the earth blood and fire
[1:33:01] and pillars of smoke the Sun shall be
[1:33:03] turned into darkness and the moon into
[1:33:05] blood before the great and terrible day
[1:33:07] of the Lord come and it shall come to
[1:33:10] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[1:33:12] name of the Lord shall be delivered oh
[1:33:17] I'm happy about that I am so happy about
[1:33:22] that whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:33:25] of Lord shall be deliver for a mount
[1:33:27] zion and in jerusalem shall be delivers
[1:33:29] as a lot of sale and in the remnant whom
[1:33:31] the lord shall call so we've taken this
[1:33:34] and we're putting this right back in the
[1:33:35] scripture this is an expectation a meant
[1:33:38] from a prophecy there and by Joe on the
[1:33:41] day of Pentecost when Peter stood up and
[1:33:43] they say you know this is that which was
[1:33:45] spoken by the Prophet Joel well amen
[1:33:48] Peter could identify the promise that
[1:33:51] was in the scripture but what happened
[1:33:53] on the day of Pentecost was not the I
[1:33:55] wasn't the only time that was going to
[1:33:58] happen
[1:33:58] because according to Joseph see in the
[1:34:01] last days not last day in the last days
[1:34:08] it was pluralized a manner in the last
[1:34:11] days are still here so if they gather
[1:34:14] that Pentecost and they did not
[1:34:17] you factor it hallelujah we can have the
[1:34:20] same thing they had Pentecost and we can
[1:34:23] start praying for that in the season of
[1:34:26] ring let me let me just you know our
[1:34:30] little something I want to share you
[1:34:33] know in Israel you're going man even in
[1:34:36] the desert they got they got trees

[1:34:43] we saw dates and and mangoes banana
[1:34:46] trees and I'll and in a desert
[1:34:48] you wonder hi I mean it didn't look like
[1:34:51] a land flowing look at honey it was in a
[1:34:54] desert but see what happened what they
[1:34:55] said say all we need is just some water
[1:34:57] if we can get water we can make anything
[1:35:00] grow in the desert I don't know if you
[1:35:05] got it if if we can just get water we
[1:35:10] can make anything grow in the desert so

[1:35:19] situation that seems impossible women in

[1:38:19] its full potential once it has come in
[1:38:22] contact with water brother Branham
[1:38:24] talked about how you know the apple tree
[1:38:26] every Apple that will reap that will
[1:38:29] come forth from my apple tree was
[1:38:31] actually already inside of a seed and
[1:38:34] all we had to do is get the ground
[1:38:37] prepared put the seed in the ground
[1:38:39] commit it to the earth glory to God I'm

[1:39:05] ground I'm expecting apples glory to God
[1:39:10] let me just kind of let just share
[1:39:12] something here because the Prophet makes
[1:39:13] a statement I want to I got a I got AI
[1:39:15] got a just drop these things in all
[1:39:18] glory glory glory glory this is our
[1:39:20] spoken word as the original seed you see
[1:39:23] there's uh there's multiple seeds that
[1:39:25] have been planted brother Branham talked
[1:39:26] about the denominational seat that went
[1:39:28] into the ground and said that air was
[1:39:30] also a word seed that went into and when
[1:39:32] that word seat goes then we can expect
[1:39:34] the word to come forth look at this let
[1:39:36] me just read a couple quotes out of this
[1:39:38] spoken words the original seed Part 2
[1:39:40] says someone asked me to repeat that
[1:39:42] that Hebrew word again enjoy the second
[1:39:44] chapter Joelle 228 where he's speaking
[1:39:46] of the coming of the form and latter
[1:39:48] rain the word former and the Hebrew word
[1:39:50] is the Hebrew word mou reh more which
[1:39:55] means teaching in other words it'll be a
[1:39:57] teaching rain and a harvest rain now
[1:40:00] we've had the teacher rain and we're
[1:40:01] ready now for the harvest ring you know
[1:40:03] the first rain is when you plant the
[1:40:05] seed that starts your crop growing then
[1:40:08] just before it matures there comes
[1:40:10] another crop that's what they call the
[1:40:13] harvest rain we know when it is the
[1:40:15] spring rains amen and then the rains
[1:40:17] about June it makes you it makes your
[1:40:19] crop now the rain we found out was the
[1:40:22] spirit now we left off at where I gave
[1:40:26] my thought of of what the whole thing
[1:40:28] will be that is I believe the rain has
[1:40:30] been brought the rain that's the reason
[1:40:33] we're quieting down because the ground
[1:40:35] is already sold over you can't find it
[1:40:37] anywhere Hartley but what what has been
[1:40:40] so and it's went out through radio
[1:40:42] televisions tapes word everything it's
[1:40:45] sold the country down it's planted seeds
[1:40:47] now what seeds was planted you cannot
[1:40:49] get nothing else from it but what seed
[1:40:51] that was planted can you
[1:40:53] stand now it'll be the Seas that's
[1:40:55] planet now the spirit will fall I like
[1:40:58] that I like that I'm a paragraph 15 on
[1:41:01] that say the spirit will fall but it'll
[1:41:04] bring the harvest of the seed that it
[1:41:06] falls on saying I remember that's all
[1:41:08] right now notice now he say the spirit
[1:41:11] will fall and and I am under expectation
[1:41:13] for a man a holy spirit a true Holy
[1:41:16] Ghost revival I'm just setting it all or
[1:41:22] God no that's that's exactly what we
[1:41:24] need here listen I mean you can settle
[1:41:26] it all you want to but if you don't get
[1:41:29] the baptism the Holy Ghost you won't
[1:41:31] make it you won't make it you'll go
[1:41:33] right back to the same thing that you
[1:41:35] was in before so that's why it's
[1:41:37] important that we make sure that we
[1:41:38] plant this seat this is what we're
[1:41:40] looking for now now a little further
[1:41:42] here amen in this talk amen amen amen
[1:41:46] amen let's see something here now oh yes
[1:41:51] this is out of the message the end time
[1:41:53] science seat the end time science see
[1:41:56] amen he said there's a revival going on
[1:41:59] what is it a sowing you don't hear very
[1:42:02] much a Billy Graham no more do you what
[1:42:05] about all what about the rest of them
[1:42:06] you know the great revive the revival
[1:42:09] fires not burning what is it it's the
[1:42:11] endtime seed sign the war's has been
[1:42:15] sown what is it denomination will reap
[1:42:18] denomination that makes them Confederate
[1:42:21] that that makes them Confederate
[1:42:23] themselves together now you know what
[1:42:26] the Prophet actually said is that and I
[1:42:28] got it I got a quote here he says like
[1:42:30] the the the Pentecostals that saw it and
[1:42:34] he said Hagar all bring themselves
[1:42:35] together and go right back to the
[1:42:37] Catholic Church right he said that's
[1:42:39] thus saith the Lord as they're happening
[1:42:40] he say and when that happens that's
[1:42:42] what's gonna put the pressure on us
[1:42:44] hallelujah and just now you think about
[1:42:46] it people that that that might have been
[1:42:48] with us that went back amongst the
[1:42:50] Pentecostals they can really put
[1:42:52] pressure on us because they know exactly
[1:42:53] what we believe hallelujah amen but I
[1:42:57] can tell you this much I don't care what
[1:42:59] anybody does I'm expecting a rapture
[1:43:02] amen there will be a great kitchen away
[1:43:05] so we don't have to run for me
[1:43:07] thing but understand there will be some
[1:43:09] pressure that comes a man listen to this
[1:43:11] he says denomination will reap
[1:43:13] denomination that makes them Confederate
[1:43:15] themselves together but the Word of God
[1:43:17] has been all been sold also and when the
[1:43:20] Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of
[1:43:23] God will live in the people I like that
[1:43:26] I like that
[1:43:28] amen we haven't even seen a real revival
[1:43:30] yet we experienced just some little
[1:43:33] things here net but we ever seen the
[1:43:34] real thing he said when the Spirit of
[1:43:37] God begins to fall the Word of God will
[1:43:40] live in the people don't worry about it
[1:43:46] just keep sitting here this word will
[1:43:48] live in you see you you've been trying
[1:43:53] to figure this thing out with your hands
[1:43:55] this is not something you can do the
[1:43:57] only thing you can do a surrender but
[1:44:00] God can do this himself Mary can have
[1:44:04] that baby by herself
[1:44:05] but Mayor said be it unto me according
[1:44:09] to your word that's all God asked you to
[1:44:12] do a surrender and he'll bring this
[1:44:14] thing to pass watch it Church listen the
[1:44:17] world of God has been sold also and when
[1:44:19] the Spirit of God begins to fall the
[1:44:21] Word of God will live in the people and
[1:44:23] the false bride that's committed
[1:44:25] adultery out there and brought herself
[1:44:27] into grieves and sold out her birth
[1:44:30] rights will reap what a confederation of
[1:44:34] church that's to be bound and burn like
[1:44:36] the thorns and thistles but where the
[1:44:38] Word of God has been sold into the
[1:44:40] people's heart it will reap a Bride of
[1:44:42] Christ as certain as I'm standing here
[1:44:44] in time science church I'm on the
[1:44:47] expectation now let me uh just a couple
[1:44:51] other things that I just want to share
[1:44:52] there's a scripture that I want to hit
[1:44:53] Oh glory to God glory to God hearing the
[1:44:58] planting the vine and where to plant it
[1:44:59] and then we're going to hit a scripture
[1:45:00] I want to just show you something we're
[1:45:02] going to go first kings in a second this
[1:45:06] Litton's followed me here with planting
[1:45:08] the vine and where the planet says oh go
[1:45:11] with me to Arizona let me take you to
[1:45:14] the desert which I roam so many years
[1:45:17] everything in the desert has a
[1:45:20] groaning and and if you ever if you ever
[1:45:23] been there you know they they took
[1:45:25] pictures in front of the cactus it just
[1:45:28] it's just in the wintertime it's still
[1:45:31] peasants in the summertime is still
[1:45:33] pensive right no matter what time of
[1:45:35] year is still pensive right they say
[1:45:37] they say everything in the dancer has a
[1:45:40] sticker on it and any little plant you
[1:45:43] come to don't get near
[1:45:45] it'll stick you and that's the way some
[1:45:48] folk are you don't want to get near them
[1:45:51] because they'll stick you yes they will
[1:45:54] let me tell you something if they
[1:45:56] talking about somebody to you then
[1:45:58] they'll talk about you to somebody then
[1:46:03] we'll stick you listen if they say cut
[1:46:06] though don't get up don't get near it'll
[1:46:08] stick you
[1:46:09] it always got stickers right out ready
[1:46:12] to stick anything that comes near that
[1:46:15] sticker is a leaf rolled up for the left
[1:46:19] of my hold on what's the matter what
[1:46:22] made it a sticker it's because there had
[1:46:24] no water that's what made it a sticker
[1:46:28] it had no water
[1:46:29] that's what dried it up and if we know
[1:46:32] if we're not careful our experience will
[1:46:34] dry up that's why we need a refill
[1:46:36] another Holy Ghost we need water and
[1:46:39] this is a season ask on Fort listen
[1:46:43] that's what rotted up that sticker is a
[1:46:45] leaf rolled up for the lack of water it
[1:46:48] becomes a sticker that is with thus thus
[1:46:53] it is with the church today that when
[1:46:55] the church gets away from the fountain
[1:46:57] of life when it gets away from the joys
[1:46:59] of salvation when it gets away from the
[1:47:01] Lord God then that person becomes a
[1:47:03] sticker always finding fault so if if
[1:47:10] you leave service today and you found
[1:47:12] some phone in it
[1:47:14] maybe you need some water I'm talk about
[1:47:21] spiritual water hallelujah it becomes
[1:47:25] this always finding fault sticking no
[1:47:28] sooner you come up I'm a presbyterian
[1:47:30] I'm a Methodist I'm sorry so don't talk
[1:47:32] to me about that stuff us
[1:47:34] Vica it has no fruits you take that same
[1:47:38] plant cactus and put it into lamb for a
[1:47:42] few generations look at that
[1:47:44] put into a lab for a few generations
[1:47:46] where there's plenty of water and that
[1:47:49] sticker will unfold and will come but
[1:47:53] when were and will come a soft leaf
[1:47:55] bearing fruit see it's all about the
[1:47:58] environment
[1:47:59] and what we're trying to do is get
[1:48:00] people in the right environment and let
[1:48:02] me tell you something hallelujah being
[1:48:04] quiet does not create the right
[1:48:06] environment can I can we just be honest
[1:48:12] even in a club you weren't quiet
[1:48:16] you made noise in a club all right if
[1:48:20] you go to a football game you make noise
[1:48:22] a man you go to a basketball game you
[1:48:24] make noise just about everywhere you go
[1:48:29] for entertainment you make noise why you
[1:48:32] don't come here and be quiet if there's
[1:48:36] ever time to shout it's this time now
[1:48:38] there's every time to get used it's time
[1:48:41] now hallelujah somebody amen we have to
[1:48:46] create the environment for God to move
[1:48:49] now now I told you we read this
[1:48:51] scripture here where Elijah was a man of
[1:48:53] like passions oh my god and he prayed
[1:48:57] earnestly that it rained not and it
[1:48:59] didn't rain right but then he prayed
[1:49:01] again and it did rain let's look at
[1:49:04] something here in in first Kings 19
[1:49:07] let's look at this oh yes Lord it won't
[1:49:14] be manufactured it'll be the real thing
[1:49:16] hey man it'll be the real thing first
[1:49:20] Kings 19 I'm starting at verse 41 thank
[1:49:24] you Jesus is that right do I have the
[1:49:26] right I got the wrong thing hold on one
[1:49:31] second it might be first Kings 18 first
[1:49:35] Kings 18 and verse 41 oh yes yes yes yes
[1:49:43] yes look at this first Kings 18 verse 41
[1:49:47] and Elisha said unto a hab now before I
[1:49:54] read that the first oven first King 17
[1:50:04] and one first King 17 to 1 it says this
[1:50:08] and Elijah the Tishbite who was other
[1:50:12] inhabitants of Gilead said in 1/2 as a
[1:50:15] Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I
[1:50:17] stand there shall not be do nor rain
[1:50:21] these years but according to my word
[1:50:23] so here Elijah had the power to actually
[1:50:27] stop it from rina one man in the hands
[1:50:30] of God had the power to stop the ring
[1:50:32] and it stopped raining for three and a
[1:50:34] half years and I told you it was that
[1:50:35] was critical they meant to Israel if
[1:50:38] they didn't get rain they were in
[1:50:39] trouble right they only had so many
[1:50:41] years I mean so many days out of the
[1:50:43] year that they would get rain and here a
[1:50:44] man instead of saying it's not gonna
[1:50:46] rain - I call for it think about that
[1:50:49] now here in 1st Kings 18 we see we're
[1:50:52] three and a half years go by and here's
[1:50:54] a here's here's Elijah a man preparing a
[1:50:58] call for rain now before he could call
[1:51:01] from for rain I want you to catch this -
[1:51:03] as we're picking us up in verse 41
[1:51:05] before he could call for rain he had to
[1:51:08] get rid of the false doctrines that was
[1:51:11] among them see he had to get rid of a
[1:51:16] man the false prophets that was in the
[1:51:18] mists hallelujah it may he had to get
[1:51:21] rid of the false interpretations all of
[1:51:24] this had to be gone before rain could
[1:51:26] come Jesus glory to God church amen no
[1:51:32] rain until all that was taken care of so
[1:51:35] that's why last week we had to settle it
[1:51:37] and now this week we can start asking
[1:51:39] for rain and and not only accident but
[1:51:45] start living under expectation because
[1:51:47] we read the scripture that rain was
[1:51:49] supposed to come in the first month
[1:51:51] mmm look at this first Kings 19 now look
[1:51:56] at this first one and then I just said
[1:51:58] in a hat get the up eat and drink but
[1:52:01] there is a sound of abundance ring he
[1:52:06] says so a hat went up to eat and to
[1:52:09] drink and Elijah went up to the top of
[1:52:11] Carmel and he cast himself down upon the
[1:52:14] earth and put his face between his knees
[1:52:16] and said to a servant go up now look
[1:52:20] toward the sea and he went up and looked
[1:52:22] and said there is nothing and he said go
[1:52:26] again seven times
[1:52:27] listen and it came to pass at the
[1:52:29] seventh time that he said Behold there
[1:52:33] arise if a little cloud I don't see like
[1:52:37] a man's hand and he said go up Santa
[1:52:41] Ahab prepare by chariot and get thee
[1:52:45] down that the rain stopped V not and I
[1:52:48] want to go back and just look at that
[1:52:49] because we always read that pretty fast
[1:52:52] but I want you to catch something verse
[1:52:54] 44 and it came to pass at the seventh
[1:52:57] time that he said there ho there arise
[1:53:00] if a little crowd out of the sea that is
[1:53:06] this this cloud came actually from the
[1:53:08] sea
[1:53:09] now usually rain come down from heaven
[1:53:11] but this cloud came from the sea oh my
[1:53:15] god now now now I started looking at
[1:53:18] that just a little deeper you know
[1:53:20] because I know over the book of
[1:53:21] Revelation brother Branham talked to see
[1:53:23] amen as multitudes of people Oh somebody
[1:53:30] help me here if the sea is typed as
[1:53:33] multitudes of people and the cloud came
[1:53:36] from where out the sea can I put it this
[1:53:40] way the cloud came out of a prayer
[1:53:43] meeting
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:46] that's what released terrain from the
[1:53:50] prayer meeting a cloud came up out of
[1:53:52] the sea and what happened on earth
[1:53:55] metrobús going on already
[1:53:59] anyway my goddddd ring but it came out
[1:54:04] of the sea from the multitude of people
[1:54:09] Elijah prayed that it would not rain and
[1:54:13] then Elijah prayed that it would ring it
[1:54:15] came out of the sea I'm telling the
[1:54:21] prayer means gonna be pretty important
[1:54:23] it's gonna get gonna get it's gonna get
[1:54:26] serious Church it's about to get serious
[1:54:29] and I cannot stress this enough I told
[1:54:33] you when when Abraham got the revelation
[1:54:36] of what was getting ready to happen down
[1:54:37] in Sodom what did Abraham do
[1:54:40] he went to prayer and if you are truly
[1:54:43] the seed of Abraham you can't help but
[1:54:45] get in prayer amen if we come up to a
[1:54:50] point where prayer meeting them be one
[1:54:52] of the most important services and let
[1:54:54] me tell you something
[1:54:55] amen we cannot be a prosperous church
[1:54:58] until we get everybody in one accord
[1:55:01] here
[1:55:03] hey man church you tell me you got you
[1:55:06] tell me your schedule that busy huh how
[1:55:10] come you find time to do all this other
[1:55:12] stuff
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:14] hey man glory to God you find time to
[1:55:17] get everything else done but you can't
[1:55:19] find time to get the prayer done on
[1:55:21] something wrong with that that's the

[1:58:21] interesting what other folk got got
[1:58:23] say about my prayer I'm only interested
[1:58:25] in what he got to say and since this is
[1:58:28] the season look women went when even the
[1:58:31] children and Israel rejoiced in the ring
[1:58:34] because they realized the importance of
[1:58:37] it listen if we as a congregation can
[1:58:39] understand the importance of having the
[1:58:42] Holy Ghost everybody ought to be
[1:58:44] rejoicing in this all right
[1:58:47] notice where the rain came from the
[1:58:50] cloud came from from the sea from the
[1:58:54] sea is going up see is only pretty much
[1:58:58] attached to the earth it's going up but
[1:59:00] it meant something in heaven Oh glory to
[1:59:02] God let's look at it let's look at it
[1:59:05] verse 44 and it came to pass at the
[1:59:07] seventh time that'd be behold there
[1:59:11] arises a little cloud and at that
[1:59:13] seventh time that type to the seventh
[1:59:15] church age just so the seventh is the
[1:59:17] completion right that the seventh amen
[1:59:20] behold air rises a little cloud and
[1:59:22] that's all that's all it take is a
[1:59:24] little something a little a little cloud
[1:59:27] out of the sea like a man's hand and he
[1:59:32] said go up say them to AI prepare thy
[1:59:35] chariot and got it and get thee down
[1:59:38] that the rain stopped he not and it came
[1:59:42] to pass in the meanwhile look at this
[1:59:44] that the heaven was black with clouds
[1:59:48] and went now see typically that's what
[1:59:51] we always looking up in the sky to see
[1:59:53] when it's gonna rain
[1:59:55] but this rain started from the sea from
[2:00:03] a prayer meeting because Elijah prayed
[2:00:06] that it did not rain and Elijah also
[2:00:09] prayed that it would ring and the cloud
[2:00:12] came from the sea but it meant something
[2:00:15] from heaven my god and when heaven and
[2:00:18] earth meet something about to happen
[2:00:23] heaven is already prepared waiting for
[2:00:26] us on earth to get prepared and when
[2:00:29] heaven and earth meet something great is
[2:00:31] gonna happen look at it search and it
[2:00:35] came to pass in the meanwhile that the
[2:00:37] heaven was black with clouds and wind
[2:00:40] and there was a great rain and a half
[2:00:43] road and went to Jezreel and the hand of
[2:00:46] the Lord was only larger and it girded
[2:00:48] up his Lawrence and ran before a hat to
[2:00:50] the entrance of Jezreel the noise was so
[2:00:53] great on Elijah that he outran a chariot
[2:00:58] outran a horse that's anointed that is
[2:01:03] anointed I think they try to get Jesse
[2:01:06] Owens to that's the one of these guys to
[2:01:08] try to do that one no no no you can't be
[2:01:10] you can't be Elijah right it takes the
[2:01:13] anointing to do that and church you know
[2:01:17] I I'm expecting this an anointing to
[2:01:20] strike this is the season for the latter
[2:01:22] rain now I want to just you all been
[2:01:25] hearing me quote this over and over
[2:01:27] again and I got to put it here again to
[2:01:30] try to show you what season we in here
[2:01:33] it is
[2:01:33] Ephesian Church H y'all gonna get tired
[2:01:37] of this quote but you know what this is
[2:01:40] what we're looking for in this season
[2:01:42] see once you come once once you find out
[2:01:44] where you standing then you know what to
[2:01:46] look for look at this
[2:01:48] nevertheless I mean revelation 2 for
[2:01:51] never less I have somewhat against thee
[2:01:52] because thou has left thy first love to
[2:01:54] understand this you must realize the
[2:01:57] Spirit is not speaking to the original
[2:01:59] Saints of Effie's Ephesus alone this
[2:02:01] messages to the entire age which lasted
[2:02:03] about a hundred and twenty years its
[2:02:05] message then as to all generations in
[2:02:07] that span here it is now history keeps
[2:02:11] repeating itself in the generations of
[2:02:13] Israel we see revival in one generation
[2:02:16] only to see the fires fading in the next
[2:02:19] in the third generation embers maybe
[2:02:22] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[2:02:25] may be no vestige whatsoever of that
[2:02:27] original flame and that vestige means no
[2:02:29] trace of the original flame and I talk
[2:02:31] to you how it was only in this
[2:02:33] generation that we begin to try to push
[2:02:34] the Prophet to the side no no no no to
[2:02:36] push the prophet to the side hallelujah
[2:02:39] hallelujah let me let me let me let me
[2:02:41] let me say this you know Elijah carried
[2:02:46] on where he like left off eli eli ja
[2:02:51] for rain hallelujah and and and and it
[2:02:54] rain now in this season Eli just not
[2:02:57] here but he like shut is and he like
[2:03:00] shut the spirit of Elijah dust rest only
[2:03:03] like shut and here in this season we can
[2:03:06] start praying for rain and expect the
[2:03:08] same thing that Elijah got in the
[2:03:10] scripture stay with me now but the only
[2:03:12] way that you gonna have their Norton any
[2:03:16] larger hat is you have to keep your eyes
[2:03:21] the only way Elijah
[2:03:23] got what he lies ahead Elijah had to
[2:03:27] keep his eyes only lied John so don't
[2:03:34] don't try to take the profit from me and
[2:03:36] say I'm not I'm not talking about some
[2:03:38] denominational rain I'm told by bright
[2:03:41] ring oh that's what I'm under
[2:03:46] expectation for come on we oh my god why
[2:03:51] are we gonna let denominations have the
[2:03:52] gifts and not we don't want him no more
[2:03:55] what is that it cannot the gifts were
[2:03:58] for you the rain was not further the
[2:04:02] briars and the thistles the rain was for
[2:04:05] the wheat the rain was for you don't let
[2:04:10] somebody else enjoy your blessings
[2:04:13] you ought to receive it and look forward
[2:04:15] to it that is a part of your harvest
[2:04:18] that's a part of your clock every gift
[2:04:22] that God putting about I'm telling you
[2:04:24] I'm just I'm just letting you know not
[2:04:26] and everywhere the other let me go
[2:04:27] further a little further we're not we're
[2:04:30] not talking about something come upon
[2:04:31] you and you ain't living the life we
[2:04:34] talked about that they may like brother
[2:04:36] branham win amongst the Pentecostals and
[2:04:38] one one man living with somebody that
[2:04:40] ain't his wife but he got gifts we don't
[2:04:41] want that we don't I mean look you got a
[2:04:45] wife you keep your eyes on your wife
[2:04:47] praise the looked a man but we not talk
[2:04:50] about that that's what happened to
[2:04:51] denominations amen you know
[2:04:53] wife-swapping and all kind of stuff and
[2:04:55] still got getting on oh no no no no no
[2:04:57] we don't want we don't want we don't
[2:04:59] want to definitely have nothing
[2:05:00] with this praise the Lord
[2:05:04] but this gonna be pure and clean this
[2:05:07] gonna be holy it's gonna be right you
[2:05:09] gonna be living something and if you can
[2:05:13] live it before before the brain came
[2:05:15] don't worry after the Holy Ghost come
[2:05:17] upon you you shall receive power and
[2:05:25] when you get this kind of powers gonna
[2:05:27] help you live right all right let me let
[2:05:30] me finish this quote because that this
[2:05:32] quote is what tells me that I'm in the
[2:05:34] season and since I'm in the season when
[2:05:36] the children Israel coming to the season
[2:05:38] of rain they begin to pray for it we're
[2:05:41] in the season look at history keeps
[2:05:43] repeating something in the generation of
[2:05:44] the Israel Israel we see revival one
[2:05:46] generation don't see the fires fading in
[2:05:48] the next in the third generation embers
[2:05:50] maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth
[2:05:51] there may be no vestige what's over the
[2:05:53] original flame and this is it right here
[2:05:54] because now now now can i but let's be
[2:05:57] honest with ourselves we have seen
[2:05:59] everything that the prophet had talked
[2:06:01] about and this quote manifested before
[2:06:03] eyes we've seen it but the part that we
[2:06:06] haven't seen is this next part then God
[2:06:11] likes the fire again and the same
[2:06:14] process is repeated so that's why I say
[2:06:17] this is the reason for latter rain right
[2:06:21] because we are not season of venkata I
[2:06:26] have seen everything else now I'm
[2:06:29] looking for the theme card part and
[2:06:31] that's why I say in the fourth
[2:06:33] generation they're gonna be the ones to
[2:06:35] experience this get ready fourth
[2:06:38] generation God is coming Oh hallelujah
[2:06:41] hallelujah and I'm glad we got some
[2:06:43] fourth generation believers actually I'm
[2:06:45] the expectation they say amen to that I
[2:06:48] have seen the devil do this and the
[2:06:50] devil do that look and brother and say
[2:06:52] when all hell break loose then we ought
[2:06:58] to be looking for all heaven to break
[2:06:59] loose and you can't tell me you ain't
[2:07:02] seen all hell break loose and if all
[2:07:05] hell is done what is that what is now
[2:07:07] let's look for all heaven let's expect
[2:07:10] that not only expect it let's start
[2:07:12] praying for that
[2:07:14] as for that type of rain because this is
[2:07:17] the season Ville a terrain let me finish
[2:07:20] this today with this this quote and let
[2:07:23] me as I'm just preparing this this is
[2:07:26] going to come out of that the sermon why
[2:07:30] I am a Holy Roller and just just so that
[2:07:33] you all understand I was just you know
[2:07:35] listening to a sermon there spoken words
[2:07:39] original seating brother branham saying
[2:07:40] every generation gets this chance at the
[2:07:43] revival every generation so fourth
[2:07:46] generation y'all get ready for y'all
[2:07:47] chance at the revival get ready for your
[2:07:51] chance because every generation gets
[2:07:53] their chance at the revival oh my god a
[2:07:56] chance at the word this is why I am a
[2:07:59] Holy Roller this is a rather lengthy
[2:08:02] quote but I think it would be a blessing
[2:08:04] to us amen as we bring closer to I
[2:08:06] thought here today a man there's a
[2:08:08] little cloud rising from the sea
[2:08:10] I believe that multitudes of people Amen
[2:08:16] why I am a Holy Roller oh my
[2:08:19] as I was why I would tell you why I why
[2:08:23] I am a holy ruler yes sir I see the
[2:08:26] signs coming up now notice to notice the
[2:08:28] title that's discernment why I am a Holy
[2:08:31] Roller
[2:08:31] I mean he's not ashamed of being
[2:08:33] identified with people that speak in
[2:08:35] tongues people that shout people that
[2:08:37] jump no I am a Holy Roller I'm
[2:08:39] identifying myself can I tell you
[2:08:41] something
[2:08:42] you know you might wonder why you in the
[2:08:45] school that you in and why you the only
[2:08:47] believer you know what God has
[2:08:50] strategically placed you there in order
[2:08:53] to bring judgment upon those that will
[2:08:55] not walk according the truth and it
[2:08:58] needs at least one light and darkness so
[2:09:01] and can you imagine that God looking
[2:09:04] around to try to find one person that'll
[2:09:06] be light in darkness and he picks you
[2:09:12] so you could handle it you can you can
[2:09:16] go against the grain right you you're
[2:09:18] the one that I'm choosing to be light in
[2:09:20] the darkness he could have chose
[2:09:23] somebody else but he chose you Oh God is
[2:09:26] good why I tell I will tell you why I'm
[2:09:30] a holy ruler yes sir I've see the sign
[2:09:32] coming up look at him looking at him
[2:09:34] there when they when they was going to
[2:09:36] church moving on joy I saw through God
[2:09:39] put a binocular in his eyes one day and
[2:09:41] he looked down through that stream out
[2:09:42] of time yonder and he's seen the church
[2:09:45] he's seen this vine torn down destroyed
[2:09:47] I said what the Palmer one left the
[2:09:50] caterpillar eaten what the caterpillar
[2:09:51] left the locust eaten what the locust
[2:09:53] eat left another worm eaten he said
[2:09:55] could this church could this church
[2:09:58] never grow again but God said I will
[2:10:00] restore saith the Lord
[2:10:01] Joel that prophet looking down through
[2:10:03] the eyes of faith he saw this vine come
[2:10:05] up out of Genesis he saw I saw it all
[2:10:08] this far then I thereafter Jerusalem the
[2:10:10] Holy Ghost that fell he's seen the dark
[2:10:12] ages coming home he's seen that vine
[2:10:14] destroyed and pushed down to a stump but
[2:10:16] God said I will restore saith the Lord
[2:10:20] oh my if it wasn't for that you might be
[2:10:23] able to kill the branches but the life
[2:10:25] is in the church which is Jesus Christ
[2:10:28] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[2:10:30] that that's spoken for God will restore
[2:10:33] the last for the earth he would get
[2:10:35] somebody who's going to believe him amen
[2:10:37] I feel like a Holy Roller look notice I
[2:10:41] will restore saith the Lord so that I
[2:10:44] was going not long ago down up here in
[2:10:47] Canada brother a soon and I were
[2:10:49] going in Canada brother Baxter we were
[2:10:52] going way up in the North Woods one
[2:10:54] night I was just I was riding along
[2:10:56] there on my horse there was a big old
[2:10:57] thicket of pines I just love the
[2:11:00] outdoors I love to see God that was my
[2:11:02] first Bible God in his nature and I
[2:11:05] looked at my past by an Old Forest where
[2:11:07] it used to be great towering Pines but a
[2:11:10] burnover had come come come years ago
[2:11:13] and burned it all down and it was just a
[2:11:15] big butt look spooky great big old white
[2:11:17] trees the moon shining down against him
[2:11:20] and them just parts right and there come
[2:11:23] a wind blowing down through the
[2:11:24] mountains and all
[2:11:25] them trees was making them the most
[2:11:27] mournful sound whoo whoo and I thought
[2:11:30] oh my spooky place then the scripture
[2:11:33] come on mind what the Palmer one left
[2:11:35] the caterpillar eaten what the
[2:11:37] caterpillar left the locust eaten but
[2:11:40] what that was his church
[2:11:42] I thought truly Lord after the
[2:11:44] Reformation back yonder what the
[2:11:46] Catholics left the fundamentals eaten
[2:11:48] what the fundamentals left the
[2:11:49] Presbyterian eaten what the
[2:11:50] Presbyterians left the Baptist's eaten
[2:11:52] what the Baptists left the Nazarenes
[2:11:54] eaten until they eat the thing down but
[2:11:57] I will restore sayeth the Lord
[2:11:59] hallelujah God's going to have a church
[2:12:03] I will restore said the Lord I stuck
[2:12:05] there wonder and hear God's sending that
[2:12:08] wind down and all them big old trees was
[2:12:10] doing going woo I thought that that's
[2:12:13] just exactly like that Russian might
[2:12:15] have wind that come from heaven on the
[2:12:17] day of Pentecost when it strikes them
[2:12:19] big old churches then big old coal
[2:12:21] churches today like around Chicago the
[2:12:23] only thing they can hear is morning
[2:12:25] crime say the days of miracles is past
[2:12:27] from the mental there trees yes sir yes
[2:12:30] sir they was once a tree the Methodists
[2:12:32] the Baptist Presbyterian the Moody and
[2:12:34] all the rest they got great big towering
[2:12:36] spires but they say the days of miracles
[2:12:39] is past because the Palmer one has eaten
[2:12:40] all the blessings out of the church -
[2:12:42] there's no more hallelujah there's no
[2:12:44] more praises to God hallelujah there's
[2:12:46] no more divine healing speak with
[2:12:47] tongues they've carried it away tongues

[2:14:34] the bathroom by himself without needing
[2:14:37] the doctor's help and they say because

[2:14:45] and now so I mean I tell you you know
[2:14:48] what we're seeing is God is still
[2:14:49] answered in prayer God is still moving
[2:14:51] amen in the supernatural now if God were
[2:14:54] actually delivering it from Gao God can
[2:14:56] deliver him from cancer I'm under I'm on
[2:14:59] the expectation I'm under expectation

[2:15:04] the hospital but if we get a call we got
[2:15:06] somebody we can go to we're gonna go
[2:15:07] that's what we do I didn't go push no
[2:15:10] track of nobody pray and let's expect
[2:15:13] God to do something hallelujah
[2:15:16] Oh glory to God let me let me keep going
[2:15:18] since I stood looked there come the wind
[2:15:23] again and instead of bending to it they
[2:15:25] go woo I thought that's about like it
[2:15:28] when God sends a revival and this city
[2:15:31] they say don't you believe such stuff
[2:15:32] days of miracles it's past there's no
[2:15:34] such thing as the Holy Ghost dr.
[2:15:36] so-and-so say well my well then I was
[2:15:39] discourtesy Lord you said I will restore
[2:15:42] and about that time the wind dropped the
[2:15:45] little Lord this what we looking
[2:15:47] forgotten to do this it says and when it
[2:15:49] did I noticed there was some undergrowth
[2:15:51] coming up that's
[2:15:52] fourth-generation there was some
[2:15:54] undergrowth coming up hallelujah glory
[2:15:56] some more little trees they wasn't as
[2:16:00] starchy and burn up with
[2:16:02] denominationalism a man they were in
[2:16:05] their evangelical they were
[2:16:07] interdenominational like Israel was God
[2:16:10] said you'll never be a nation or more
[2:16:11] and she won't be they were
[2:16:13] interdenominational and when when the
[2:16:16] winds began to blow and these little
[2:16:18] trees begin that wind began to hit them
[2:16:20] little trees begin to frolic and jump
[2:16:22] and dance and carry on
[2:16:23] I thought hallelujah I'll restores that
[2:16:25] the same power the Holy Ghost that fell
[2:16:27] on the day of Pentecost if them old
[2:16:29] mournful churches one or more to say
[2:16:31] well I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist more
[2:16:32] known there's an undergrowth coming up
[2:16:35] hallelujah the life left the tree but
[2:16:39] it's coming up again every time the wind
[2:16:42] blows them little trees just take down
[2:16:45] and get a better hole that's right I
[2:16:47] will restore self the Lord God is
[2:16:50] raising up that first rains don't past
[2:16:53] the blister stuff the power went out of
[2:16:56] the church but God in this last days is
[2:16:58] sending the latter rain win now
[2:17:03] Halloween that's right the power of the
[2:17:05] Holy Ghost coming back I'm speaking it
[2:17:09] by faith a man as sure as he says the
[2:17:12] winds and the rains there's a tree
[2:17:14] standing there to rejoice oh I wonder
[2:17:17] who's that tree here today as sure as it
[2:17:20] stands the waves and the race there will
[2:17:22] be a tree standing there too a choice
[2:17:25] how happy there was there little trees
[2:17:27] just depending with the winds so that
[2:17:30] wind said Jesus Christ the same
[2:17:32] yesterday today better little tree say
[2:17:34] hallelujah hallelujah I believe it
[2:17:36] hallelujah hallelujah leave it the other
[2:17:38] tree said in a sense it was from the
[2:17:41] Miller they were just as much tree as
[2:17:44] what this little fella was but brother
[2:17:46] they couldn't bend to the spirit this is
[2:17:49] where I want to end into end tonight or
[2:17:51] today that's what the trouble these
[2:17:54] great big churches can't bend to the
[2:17:55] spirit because they're so organized it
[2:17:58] would break up their organization that's
[2:17:59] right look at this a strong wind in
[2:18:02] Israel is coming up
[2:18:06] can you know I want to speak that by
[2:18:07] faith strong wind and Spirit of Truth
[2:18:11] Tabernacle is coming up
[2:18:13] call back wash and holy rollers now I'm
[2:18:16] gonna tell you something after this
[2:18:17] happened people don't look at you a
[2:18:18] little different at school amen and they
[2:18:22] should see something different but God
[2:18:23] want to use you as a testimony of light
[2:18:26] in the midst of darkness it says call
[2:18:28] back wash and holy rollers hallelujah
[2:18:30] justice flexible as it can be that's
[2:18:33] right
[2:18:33] got life in them the Nutri was alive the
[2:18:36] old tree was dead that's the reason they
[2:18:39] can't be in because it's bad dead but
[2:18:42] there's a new birth coming on the latter
[2:18:47] rain being poured out in these last days
[2:18:50] power signs and wonders and the same joy
[2:18:55] than old trees joint long time ago has
