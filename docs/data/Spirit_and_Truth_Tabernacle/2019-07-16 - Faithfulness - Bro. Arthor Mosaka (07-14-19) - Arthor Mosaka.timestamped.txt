[26:19] say that this song was inspired by
[26:22] brother Jack some of you may know that
[26:24] already
[26:25] but many many years ago in his role as
[26:30] song leader at brother West Coast Church
[26:33] and our church had been invited to go
[26:37] there for one of the services where our
[26:39] pastor Minister and brother Jack was
[26:42] conducting the sung service and it was
[26:44] just a glorious time and when we got
[26:47] back to our home church how pastor made
[26:49] comments about it
[26:51] he was just so caught up just thinking
[26:54] about the atmosphere that had been said
[26:56] and one of the things that he said is
[26:58] that brother has stepped into the vision
[27:02] those words kind of stuck with me for
[27:04] four days and one day I found myself
[27:07] doing hope some work around the house
[27:10] and kept coming and coming I got a pen
[27:13] and I sat down and I started writing and
