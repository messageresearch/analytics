will carry through into next year because there's just no way I'll be able to finish everything that God has given me um you know this year and and on next Sunday uh if um uh the Lord permits I am scheduled to be in Philippines preaching on next Sunday uh so just keep us in prayer uh for that another whirlwind trip but we trust God to just give us strength to be able to uh fulfill uh what he's called us to do um the um um uh I'll be back for the final service of the year and then don't forget that we'll be doing a New Year's Eve service right here Amen in the church and don't forget about the um the combined service that's I think we had 6:00 but they change the time to 6:30 it'll be there in um in um Rapture and Faith Tabernacle so don't forget about that on the last Sunday of the year we'll be there fellowshipping with them at 6:30 the scripture reads in Joel 1:4 says um that which the Palmer worm had left ha the Locust eaten and that which the Locust had left the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left hath the caterpillar eaten skipping over to chapter 2 um verse 23 is where we will just read from really really quick um says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord uh your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and latter rain in the first month uh and the floor shall be full of wheed and the fats shall overflow with new with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years uh that the Locust have eaten um the korm and the caterpillar build in the pal worm and great Army which I sent among you my God my God my God uh you know sometimes I can be at home looking at things and um and and and I can things that I'm looking at at home I actually don't see until I stand right here and I just I just read that scripture and saw something there that I ain't even saw and and all I can tell you is that uh when the scripture says that the fat shall overflow I'mma just stop right there let's pray let's just pray let's just pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for all that has uh happened thus far in the service and uh we trust Lord Jesus that the uh spirit of God would take control over this portion of the service as the word of God is presented uh to the Saints we take control of every spirit that is against the spirit of God and may you father um just get the glory and honor out of our gathering thank you for uh the saints that did make it we heard about our brother Garen being in an accident and we we thank you for watching over him the scripture tells is that the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them from all their troubles so we thank you for delivering our brother and God we know that uh things will work out as far as the vehicle concerned uh sometimes this is just your way of getting us something new and uh we we thank you God for you are a provider amen and we've seen you do it again I've seen you do it for others so we know you'll do it again for our brotherr and and I just pray that you would just touch his body that there will be no ill effects from this accident and father we just commit them now into your hands it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated in the presence of the Lord praise the Lord uh we continue amen our journey through um get back in Step this is something the Lord has um um called us to this year that was our um theme but the inspiration underneath the theme is I will restore sayith the Lord amen and um I believe the the Lord certainly has uh been bringing us back in step in so many ways but um uh I know that God got so much more in store as I read a few things here to you this morning I I'm I'm I'm placing you under um uh prophecy and expectation and uh you know we just got to look forward to seeing what God is not not I know that God will do it I know God has done it and God will do more uh but we got to stay in a place where we can allow God to do amen what he wants to do in us there's there's certain things that has been spoken uh Over Us in scripture and this this restoration is I believe I I didn't see it like this before but I believe this is a scripture for our time amen it's a scripture for our day I believe Joel was speaking of us when he uh when he wrote this uh and there is many that have no idea what these what these things are saying but uh but for you know just as the Lord's been showing us this year this is this is a bride scripture sir amen there were scriptures in in the Bible uh that Jesus needed to fulfill there were script in the Bible amen that John the Baptist would have come to fulfill amen there were scriptures in the Bible and which we'll go through some of them today but uh even brother brandom had to fulfill but glory to God there comes a time where you have to look into the scripture a little bit High a little bit of high a little bit of high give me a little bit of high uh you have to look in the scripture and you have to see that no this part is for me sir you all remember the story that the prophet told of the boy going up up the stairs at his relative's house I think it was either Grandma Auntie but one of the relatives and he's walking up the stairs and we get to the top of the stairs that boy begin to wave his hand and uh he'd do this and he'd look and he say the thing uh that he was looking at was also waving his hand and he would do it and he wave his hand this way and said man that thing doing the same thing I'm doing and he he had never seen anything like this he was coming from the country into the City and the very first time he come in contact with a mirror praise God and when he come in contact with a mirror he he got a startling Revelation amen and the starting Revelation he told his Mama say Mama that is me and here what I'm seeing a startling Revelation when I look at Joel chapter 2 praise God there's a startling Revelation that pops out through the mirror of the word of God and I say mama that that right there me that's my scripture Joel wrote about me I am the restoration I'm part of the restoration I'm living in restoration day glory to God and and if if I'm living in restoration day I'm not supposed to lose nothing because I'm under restoration everything that the devil try to take from me I'm going to get it back Hallelujah and since I caught him stealing I don't get single I get double and I'm standing on the word of God with that Praise His Holy Name Church glory to God Amen so I mean it's it's time for us to recognize this is not just words that we're reading this is our scripture this is for our day yes sir this is what we we we're we're we're to fulfill so just just just bear with me amen this morning I'm I'm going to lay some seed and then you know we'll just pick up as the holy spirit will lead us but uh one of the things that the Lord's kind of leading me to do is is all try to keep uh the sermon the restoration of the Bri tree before you so I'll be pulling a quote from there all the time and I want to encourage you go back and listen to it go back and listen to it there is something in that sermon that belongs to us sir right and and and every time I go I don't listen to it but every time I go back I'm I'm catching other things every time I read this scripture I'm catching other things so let's let's just uh let's just go I want to start here with this first uh quote out of restoration of the briad tree amen but just listen to what the prophet is telling us uh he says now listen closely so now listen now don't miss this now uh he says there was four death Messengers praise God he says or would you rather we just close and he asked the church y'all want me to just close uh and just sto the sermon this morning I'm so glad there was some people in the congregation that encouraged The Prophet by telling him no don't close Hallelujah would you rather me just close would you rather me go into another series would you rather me start on something else amen are you tired of hearing it's going to rain well I'm I'm I'mma preach another sermon get in the boat why inspiration it's going to rain he says this he says um uh listen real close now look there was four death Messengers kill that tree he says that's right uh he says what was it palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar is that right four messengers of Roman Devils killed that tree it says one took its fruit one took its bark or took its leaves one took its bark one took the life is that right four messengers of dogmas kill the tree all but the roots you know and and you know this week the the Lord just kind of had something happen to me little friend of mine that I I I I I I I play golf with quite often he um I want to say maybe a year ago he he he he he come to me and he says I feel like God has connected us for some reason I feel like like God has connected us I said okay and I don't say nothing I mean I know what I believe right and so I didn't say nothing I just just let it say you if you feel like God connected all right I'm going just let that be like that and so I I never said anything but um you know he I told him that I was going to be you know taking this this this trip here uh to Philippines and he's like now you just got back from Australia going to Philippines what is this what what what is this that what you what you how you know all these people how how how's all this you know he just started asking questions I said now you you you ask a question now it's going to be an answer I I need to know what what Ive never seen anything like this what is this well well we you know honestly I just be honest say you know we we believe according to the scripture amen that God sent us a sent a prophet according to Malachi 4 just like uh uh he sent John the Baptist he sent for the first coming he sent another Prophet for the second coming and that Ministry was the ministry of William Mary and Brandon and uh and I said but that's right there in the in the Bible and there's many other scriptures that that kind of point to this so we just we just followed that he said well what is it called what is it what what's this movement called I said it's the message say it's the en time message it's like well I ain't never heard of this in my life so he he said well what are the things that you know what what what what's going I say well the message is to return our hearts back to the word that's all it's just to bring us back to the word say let's just take for example water baptism how does the church baptize I say I say you know the church um you know they they they baptize in the name of the father name of the son and of the Holy Ghost right I said but Peter 10 days after Jesus told him to do that Peter baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said now did Peter have it wrong or did Peter have it right so what Peter got is the revelation of what the name of the father was what the name of the son was and what the name of the Holy Spirit was I said when he got that then he knew baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now we're coming back to truth yes sir say well he say so so I just learned you know just people have differences and you know and and and it it is what it is you know I mean people can't help it you know just just love them anyway long as they got saved I say I I I I get you I get you I totally understand I said but you know the only problem is um you know God going to judge us based on his word and we got to live according to his word so he he he say he said well I I I understand he says he said what's what's y'all thoughts about the the church as a whole I mean you know the way you looking at it what's your thoughts about the whole church I say the church so you got to look at it according to Revelation 3 I said according to Revelation 3 the church has put Jesus and according to the Bible Jesus is standing at his own church knocking trying to get back in and then he go on and say he say well yeah he says uh and if any man would o If any man would open the door then he'll come in and S I said said but wait now if any man that's an individual so the church as a whole will not accept this I said let me give you just another one just give give you one where we got off the word let me just give you one real real easy one I said now the Bible tell us that a woman not supposed to preach he say I agree with that I agree with that I I ain't never I ain't never never agree with that I I say I say but you you you um you let me go tell some of these famous women preachers that the Bible say they not supposed to preach what you think they'll they they'll look at me and say I I I I I say you just call the names he start calling names I don't want to call the people names online but you know them women preachers out there big big time women preachers huge congregations right Hallelujah but uh but he he say I said but that's against the word of God I say I said this is why the bible say that they're blind they're wretched they're naked they're miserable and they don't even know it and then they got so much money that you can't tell them nothing I said but this is prophecy according to scripture they can't help theel they fulfilling the prophecy of the scripture man I took them all through I took them and showed them the seven angels the cloud he we were working then I then I I had I had one more to leave him with he said he say you know what what else I say well what happened in the Garden of Eden you feel connected I'mma just I mean look sometimes you got to throw it out there to see if it'll strike he and what he say he say he say he say Jack I ain't never heard of some of these things in all my years he said but but but I'm teachable that's all I need that's all I need and I just drop these things off and if there's a seed there something going to strike that seed and you won't be able to get away from it amen so I just told him they said what what fruit did she eat and got pregnant and why is there two different lineages in in the Book of Genesis what why does the bible say that uh Cain was of that Wicked one I mean just questioning I like you got to answer these questions now so so so as as we start going through he say I I I i't never heard that I say it was adultery in the Garden of Eden say that was the first sin that took place in the garden of Ed it was adultery now they could have come to that cuz God told them to fruitful and multiply they could have come to it on their own and God would have blessed it come on somebody but I tell you what but but but I told him said you know even uh when we look at things even Joel is a part of what God said that we would be walking in it to be a restoration of the word we come back to the word so so I said Lord I just thank you for the opportunity to be a witness but here when we let me just kind of keep going here these these four death Messengers came but four life Messengers comeing now watch this brother random says one of them uh let's see here where I'm at 505 it says uh and if four Messengers death if four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree do you get it says amen for God said I will restore it he's going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism amen of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word praise God and and as I've said it and I'll say it again we're not just amen uh focusing on just the fourth part it's very I mean it's the it's the climax but we get all of that we get justification we get sanctification and we get the gifts of the Spirit Plus the word we get all of it amen so I I realize some some Churches don't want the gifts of the Spirit no more we want it all yes sir amen praise the Lord long as it's in order we want it all now look he goes on to say this one of them Martin Luther began to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley strong of sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great great prophet now he and he another great prophet seeyour he talking about there but he says look he says but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God the fourth light e he's he just quoted Malachi 4 sir now when he uses that term forth light and I'm going to just pause there for a second I'm coming back to that same spot uh here in a second but when he uses that term forth light uh I I can't but uh think about a couple things when we talk about fourth light uh first one is Revival fires began to burn again in the fourth generation because what he promises that I will light the fire again what they saw in the first generation is supposed to repeat in the fourth generation Hallelujah sir hallelujah what I'm saying is that what we saw what we hear on tapes what we saw in brother brandom's Ministry is supposed to repeat again for this day fourth generation is supposed to see the same signs the same wonders the same Miracles that they saw in the first generation I'm telling you just won't be a history lesson it's going to be a present tense God the other thing about the the the fourth light is that the sun and moon were created on the fourth day they brought light on the fourth day now um I want to catch a little quote here to talk about that just for a second now when when when God said at the beginning let there be light and the Bible says there was light that first day it was not sunlight not Su n light but when he said let there be light that was s o n light hallelujah amen that's where the Loos was created that's where amen the pill of fire was created uh where we can identify the presence of God because he was a spirit and we we just could not identify him but now that light comes out and we can identify the presence of God that same light is what led the children of Israel through the Wilderness hallelujah it's a pillar Cloud by day and a pill of Fire by night that same light is the one that Paul spoke to on the road to Damascus and said you know uh it's it's hard for you to kick against the prick and why you why you persecuting me Paul he says well who art thou Lord the light spoke back to Paul and said I am Jesus that was s o n light yes sir amen but where did the Su in light and the Moonlight come from it was on the fourth day of creation that God brought provided the suu in light and amen um and then and the moon but there was a purpose cuz brother Bram said the sun and the moon are married let's read something out of speak to the Rock Let's see cuz this we're we're in fourth light time we're in fourth light time praise the Lord we're living underneath fourth light and there are certain things that's supposed to happen under fourth light sir can I just read a little bit speak to the Rock Amen there's a a statement here brother random makes and I and I want to I want to try to clarify this one uh it says there is a lot of young women here this afternoon amen amen I speak to the Rock he says there is a lot of young women here this afternoon a lot of nice girls now now now now when he's talking about this he's talking about churches when you when you think about women in Scriptures it represents church so now he's using a natural type in order to kind of identify something spiritual sir read between the lines right there's a lot of nice young women not of lice nice young Church all over all over the city come on right it says a lot of nice girls Hallelujah and I respect every one of them but there's one miss brandom Hallelujah only one now there's one miss brandom see that's my wife amen he says all right and that's the way it is there's lots of churches there's lots of people that goes to church and so forth but there's one oh my my my my there's one miss Jesus and you better find her glory to God there's one miss Jesus that's right and those is made up of every denomination that's born again by the spirit of God and come into the body of Christ they are joint HS with him amen they're with him they're a part of him just a part of his body and that's the way a wife is to a husband it's a part of him amen now he goes on a little further says oh I think of that I think in Genesis that when God made the Sun and and made the moon now the Moon is the wife of the sun now when the Sun goes away the Moon reflects the light of the sun is that right on the earth and now when Jesus was taken away we are the bride which is the moon to reflect the light of the Gospel in the fourth light we got to reflect something Amen to reflect the light of the gospel and we can't reflect him until he Shines on us amen sir yes sir so he says when the gospel goes to shining on us then we then then then we shine it out so send the light Lord is my prayer that we can reflect the light of the Son of God in his power and in his resurrection and his fullness how marvelous everything they saw in the first generation we're supposed to see in this fourth generation we're underneath the fourth light let me keep going in restoration of the Bride tree praise God and we'll drop some more here I stopped at paragraph 509 there in restoration of the Bride tree and the prophet says uh four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took took it away in dogmas for messengers of righteousness restores her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live wish we had time it I got it wrote down here but I have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sin you skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when uh that's when come back uh the the fourth message of life when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back the fourth message of life we need the Holy Spirit wind blowing in the church it brings all the life back oh my this tree going to bloom again amen watch this now it says I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth what what's it going to bring forth the same signs this is prophecy and let me tell you something uh when a prophet is speaking things like this there's nothing that we can do to stop it amen this will happen in the church glory to God it just needs to happen according to the scripture we align ourselves with the word of God look it says he says uh uh the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same size watch justification brought back the pul sanctification brought back the bark of Holiness he says what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the fourth was the word and and I don't have any problem at all with the church being a little Pentecostal I rather see you Pentecostal than Presbyterian sir you know Pentecostal make the service go a little easier Presbyterian we just sit and look you you came to Church sad you leave sad and you're not even supposed to come to church sad you know the you know what David said I was when they said unto me I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord you know even in the book of Nehemiah you can come amen into the church I mean into the king's present with a sad countenance and you couldn't do that with a natural King what about the King of Kings praise the Lord i' rather see us be a little little bit more Pentecostal like then brother brandom say I rather see him have some wild fire than no fire at all Hallelujah glory to God we we at at brother West's wake service brother Bernard got him say he had come to the church for the first time so he ain't never seen anything like it them brothers was coming from the back of the church all the way to the front right down the middle of AIS with a big amen hallelujah that's the way we used to have church run from the back all the way to the front and and when we finish saying our amen we walk back to the back rejoicing hitting each other and jumping and I mean just just enjoying oursel my God and then we then the pastor say something else or the minister say we come charging right back up we got a lot of exercise in church amen man we enjoyed ourselves amen glory to God I I and and when I got to to London that's when it went to the next level cuz when I saw sister Taffy she's she left an imprint sister Tabby I just believe it she just walking back and forth I just believe it God bless you Sister inspir Sister Rebecca to write a song about her glory to God glory to God look I rather see us have a a a little wildf fire than no fire at all in the church yes all right amen here uh let me see here the what he says um what brought back the Le Pentecostal what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoice and Pentecostal what the fourth was the word the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally just I mean after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organization died out but and Christ has again sented himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the then coming of the cap that means the building is now complete but all those things were needed to make the building complete you need justification you need sanctification you need the gifts and the word hallelujah all right all right let me go back to a quote that I read in and and the last time I spoke I said if you want to hear more you got to come back y'all came back by the grace of God well let me finish let me finish let me go back to this quote out of exposition of the seven Church ages and um and then uh I want to slip into some scripture Hallelujah here uh the prophet tells us in this message the uh resume of the ages he says but what about the true seed he says it will happen just as we have said the people of God are are be are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age now how are the people of God being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger uh to this age right so if I did not quote what the message was saying you would not be ready for what God is getting ready to do not only what God's getting ready to do what God promised in his scripture to do you wouldn't be part of the restoration if you couldn't receive it all right y if you if you were at the homegoing service you know where I'm at but you got to be able to receive it if if you can receive it this is that Elias if you can receive it other words Jesus is saying I did my part I told you I was sending Elijah and and you wondering if Elijah's coming now I'm tell I told you I sent I was going to send him I have already sent him he's sitting in jail right now it don't look like a this don't look like Elijah in jail does it that bothers you that Elijah is sitting in jail right now but if you can receive it it's not whether I send him or not it's whether you can receive him or not and if if if if Jesus could say that about the first amen uh the the the the the the the representative that was there at his first coming what about the represent that would come at the second coming he would say the exact same words if you can receive it this is that Elijah what's stopping you from receiving it a bridge a bearl that's all that you got that you can't receive it well what if Jesus just stood out there and said if you can receive it this is that Elijah and I'm going to tell you with some of the signs and wonders that Jesus produced in in his ministry we know that uh the supernatural picture with the the pill of fire over his head it it showed how Jesus was identifying that this is the man that is that Elijah yes sir praise the Lord let me let me read let me read people God been made ready by a word of truth from the messenger to this age and look at this look at this statement in her in her who is her the wife of the son her is you oh my my my the in her this is proph I'm reading prophecy over you and and look you can't stop a prophecy no sir in her will be on oh I don't know if we I don't know if y'all reading the same thing I'm reading in her will be no just one service where we have a manifestation no no in her will be the fullness of pent cost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning the fourth light will look like the first light yes sir hallu am it's not just history anymore we standing on promises prophecy we can we know what to expect in the church yes sir not that we have to make it make it happen we just know what to expect look at it now I'm going on it says uh the the the in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is th thus sayith the Lord to God Amen look at he said it is thus sayith the Lord for that is what Joel 22326 that's why Joel becomes our scripture right so so the prophet is identifying this it is thus say the Lord for that is what Joel 2: 23-26 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he have given you the former Reign moderately so now and and this is I want to just kind of circle back to something I said when when when when the soua Street Revival happened they got rain moderately they were teaching former Reign is a teaching Reign and they were teaching that gifts were supposed to be back in the church they start teaching that uh uh a param I believe had a school and and William Seymour had to go sit outside the school and get some of the teaching because they couldn't integrate in those days I mean the Holy Ghost don't do things like that right and then the man William William Seymour goes to Los Angeles start preaching what he what he heard in the teaching and then they kicked them out the church and told them we don't we don't want that it don't matter if they kick you out or not they ain't got nothing to do with what God wants to do amen but Seymour was a part of the restoration yes sir Hallelujah right and say Seymour stayed with what God had showed them they got into prayer meetings and before you know it the spirit of God poured out in Los Angeles like never before amen hallelujah but all they had was moderate rain but see in this season there's a a a a difference a difference that happens here we get two rings and if can I put it this way we get we get double oh Lord yes sir it's in the Bible we get double sir Hallelujah ooo Lord have mercy have mercy have mercy have mercy oh God let me keep on reading it's right here in the Bible we get double double belongs in our day Hallelujah Satan once these things start open up to us we Satan Ain't That Ain't Enough s you done did this that ain't enough I need more than that amen glory to God am all right let me let me let me read he says look says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he ha given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month that's the double he says and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm my great Army which I sent among you right and ye shall eat in plenty if I could just say this way God God set us up for a blessing and see then when he says I sent this among you now now you remember uh the oldest book in the Bible is the Book of Job job just lost everything he had it was a terrible situation job just my I'm sitting here maybe enjoying some coffee and some toast and somebody running and say job you just lost this well all right well okay and nothing I can do about it they walk out and as they walking out a second person walk it in like job you just lost this like now my I wasn't expecting that but what okay all right no problem third one second one walk out third one walk in job you just lost this my God everything seem to be going against me that's not how job responded he just okay all right and then as the third one walking out the fourth one walk in said job you just lost all your children said what and at that time the Bible tells us that job bowed his face to the ground the lord giveth the lord taketh away see what it is God watching your attitude is the in the midst of your trial he said the Lord give the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and you know that was the beginning of J trouble but at the end you know what job got the only thing he didn't get double on was his children that's the only thing he got brother Brandon say he got his children back but he didn't get double on the children but everything else that he lost my God my go if you lost a house what what does double mean to you I'mma get two houses yes sir if I lost a dog I'mma get two if I lost a cat I'mma get two huh Hallelujah somebody and for me if if the Devil comes in and steal one of my children and get them messed up with somebody in the world Satan I'm not just taking my child back I'm taking the one they connected to back as well double you going to lose two Satan if if you take one you going to ra give back to what I'm trying to tell you better not mess with [Music] [Applause] me you you done chewed off a little bit more than you can bargain with right now look I'm telling you it's the way it's going to be I'm getting double double double double yes sir amen all right look at look let's go on he says yeah so ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed I love that now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the westling age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore he cannot for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it's the restoration he says God will take the church right back and look at where where where they going where's the church going now where does the restoration take the church God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning yes sir what we see in Acts in the book of Acts is what we will see in the church oh I'm expecting to hear a testimony one day one of y'all might be going down the street I I might be prophesying I'm not sure but one of y'all might be going down the street and you'll see one of these people begging for food on the side of the road maybe a little lame in the feet and the Holy Spirit will speak to you to say something to them and when you roll down the window they come with a cup in their hand thinking that they going to get some money but you'll have a word in your mouth Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you rise up and walk in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallu that's what happened in the book of Acts amen amen maybe one of y'all will be at somewhere outside just walking by in the in the hot sun of Florida creating a shadow huh and as you walking by somebody laying there on the side of the RO hey I ain't never felt nothing like that who is this man who is This Woman This Is The Bride of Jesus Christ this is the moon that's wife to the s o praise God the Bride of Jesus Christ has walk right by yes sir and the same signs and wonders that follow Jesus amen will'll be following his church oh yeah yeah yeah Wednesday night testimonies we'll be looking to hear some things and don't be trying to be humble I just don't want nobody to know what happened well if if they didn't want nobody to know what happened it wouldn't be written in scripture for us that's TR hallelujah amen glory to God all right let's keep going I'm I'm I'm I'm I got to get somewhere today the uh the quote says God will take his church right back to the Pentecost at the beginning now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration and the reason that we need because the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palm worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem watch this he says now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist Spirit man manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to original seed and look at this now now now this here he says he is doing it we're in it right now he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former rain next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith so you realize this this whole um this whole thing is actually preparing us for a Rapture yes sir oh my and and you know uh in in in in Noah's day they had a message that prepared them if they would receive it if they could receive it they had a message that prepared them for what was getting ready to happen we got a message that God has given us to prepare us for the Rapture because that's the next thing to happen for the church Hallelujah but we got to we got to uh receive what the the prophet is saying because he's the one that's given us the teaching ring Hallelujah you got to know what to expect before the spirit rain falls you need the teaching ring all right all right we ain't seen nothing yet I'm telling y'all that right now we done seen something but we ain't seen nothing yet I'm talking about wait till uh you get three prophecies go forth and three interpretations in the same service and then watch the Holy Spirit stop it right there because if we go past it then we just broke the word but everybody is governed right according to the word a a prophecy go forth uh then uh inter ration another prophecy go forth interpretation on SE on different people not even the same person but on different people y'all oh Lord have mercy now I'm going tell you something the the modak gift is in operation in the church the more precise it comes the more the more people feel comfortable releasing and allowing God to speak through them now I'm saying that for a reason because if your life ain't right it is very possible that somebody could call something out in your life you you come to church kind of hiding things but some people don't know about what you doing when you leave church but the Holy Ghost know what you doing and this going to be a church controlled by the Holy Ghost and let me tell you something we don't we don't need nobody sin trying to stop and block God from doing what he want to do now I'm going tell I'm going to say it like this today is a day a really good day a great day for you to repent that's right and get your life right with God yes sir amen this a good day for you Lord I'm sorry and don't go back to that lifestyle when you truly repent you don't go back to that lifestyle hallelujah amen old things pass away and everything else becomes new you run for your life no I ain't going back to that no no no they can have all my stuff I ain't going back I'm going forward yes sir huj that's what repentance does but I'm just I'm I'm forewarning you because we ain't seen nothing yet amen the spirit has a way of calling out things I mean back back in the day it would I mean hey now look even in the Pentecost Church they would tell you things that you was doing in your life that weren right Jesus did that with the woman at the well go get your husband yeah I ain't got no husband you right and the one you living with right now is not yours and the other five you had ain't yours don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't get called out don't get your sins called out now that that's not saying stay home from church that's saying repent that's it brother yes sir repent and move away from that lifestyle yes sir cuz that's a lifestyle that to take you to hell you can be this close to heaven that close you were in the church listening to the word saying Amen to the word you agreed with it but you just couldn't let go of that one little thing I mean the Rich Young Ruler got this close to Heaven you got one Sermon Just One sermon one Sermon Just I can't one I can't can't can't do that one you know what he lift up his eyes from one sermon one statement of one sermon oh Lord all right let me keep reading where am I the they are the Antichrist Spirit manifested organization denomination false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little rud and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church uh but it's going to bring his original uh planting back to Original Seed he is doing it is stated in verse 23 by the teaching form a Reign next will come the Harvest rain the Rapture and Faith it says thus at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much that if it were possible they shall de deceive the very elect and who is that that shall attempt to deceive the very elect now watch this now who is that that will attempt to deceive the very elect look at the answer now it says while the spirit of antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day let me let me let me go a little further this is not just Baptist Pentecostal Catholic Presbyterian Episcopalian that's not the false anointed ones that's not it we already know uhuh that ain't it denomination is not there there's a spirit behind denominations that's not of God so we know that's not it but in the message there'll be some false anointed ones that will rise up and you just can't just because people claim the message don't uhuh don't just go with that now you better watch the fruit coming forth from the tree yes sir like I told you before somebody somebody have a prophecy go forth in the church and and and and and and and and the interpretation come back push play only mm-m that ain't what that ain't what the bible say that ain't what the prophet even taught us push play only I'm yeah we listen to the Tes were not push play only no that ain't there's something wrong with that one that that don't sound right I don't care how anointed you looked and how KN you felt tears were just rolling down my I I get all that but what came out was not the word Amen brother Brandon had to deal with stuff like that he told one brother come and say he had a dream about leaving his wife and and going to be with this other woman and and how God showed me this and showed me that dream and I got I got to do it the way God show brother brand say your dream was mighty fine your dream was mighty fine my brother it's just against the word amen hallelujah so I'm not I don't want to go with a mighty fine dream I want to see how that dream align with the word cuz that's the fourth Foundation that's the fourth light all right Hallelujah here we go yeah you know I'm going to tell you this this word is powerful I I'm trying to get somewhere I had a friend another friend called me this week and she had um she had a dream about something that was that happened to her that she somehow fell out of her bed and was underneath the um uh got thrown underneath her underneath the bed and she was just screaming Jesus Jesus I don't even know how I got down here Jesus I need you I need you and she say somehow when she when she when she cried for Jesus she got back on the bed and there was such a peace that came you know over her and uh so she said she went to church for some event a few days later and when she went to church she come home from church and she just laid down on her couch and uh and when she laid down on the couch um she she say she don't even remember falling from the couch but she fell from the couch and found herself underneath the table and when she saw herself she she was looking up from there she said she didn't know what was going on she said Jesus where are you I need your help I don't know where you at Lord you know how did this happen to me and then then then she she turned from questioning him to saying I plead the blood of Jesus I plead the blood of Jesus before you know it she found herself out from underneath that table back on the couch and she was trying to call people to come see about couldn't reach nobody and she's like she like you know I just think this spiritual warfare I said no no no say hold on hold on hold on hold on you said you had a dream that you was in your bed and then when you fell out the bed you went underneath the bed and then you you know you you you said uh Jesus and somehow peace came into your room you got back on the bed that was in a dream correct so then the manifestation came when you was laying on your couch and you slipped underneath the table and don't know how you got there now first you questioned them but when you begin to plead his blood that's when the peace came and you got out the situation without anybody coming to get you look he showed you in the dream what was going to happen and then he showed you how to get out of the problem in the dream she said I ain't see it like that it's real simple God showed you all of this in order to prepare you for what was getting ready to happen and when you when you know the word it gives you peace let me keep reading in so much that it was if it were possible uh they shall deceive the very elect and who is it that shall attempt to deceive their very like why the spirit of antichrist is in the false and only ones of this last day these false ones have already come in Jesus name claiming that they have been anointed of God for the last day they are false Messiahs anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but they are one but are they one with the word never they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting and Gifts is upon them but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with the ministry imparted by Christ but because they are the wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal but is Lay to see him not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs among them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though EMP powering signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all ah yes the this false spirit in this last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it's caught in being anti- word it falls back on one argument we have we have shown already to be false we shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God see so brother brandom's told us that we don't look for just people that's getting results if they're not on the word we don't we don't go with that now when he said here in this quote now I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm at a point where I want to be uh he says here is they deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger I mentioned this before Advent means the arrival of a notable person it's the arrival the Advent of a man they they they they deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger that means the prophet has already arrived and at this time the prophet was actually on the scene preaching to them but they deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger we don't want to receive that you are a prophet that come from God well look God promised in his word that he was sending a prophet now this is where we we get started in our journey and y'all already know I'm out of time but it's okay uh we start here with Malachi 4 this is the scripture that promises that a prophet would be coming Malachi 4:5 and 6 let's read that really really quick and then uh I will find a way out but uh I have I I I have roughly 11 scriptures that I want to share with you all and in sharing the scriptures I'm also going to bring um a couple quotes to go along with it so it's cemented but Malachi 45-6 and maybe I think what we're going to need to do is go back to verse one on this one because it's it's very important that we kind of catch all of this verse one says for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud Y and all that do wickly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as the calvs of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord right and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now here we we we get uh God promising that he's going to sent Elijah the prophet and now it's up to you to receive Elijah when Elijah comes it's up to you to receive him you don't have to but God will do his part in saying i s i I have I will sin and I have already sin this is why he told him in in in John's day now if you can receive it this is that Elijah this the one I said I was going to be sending so now here what we what we find in scripture and and I hit this at the uh at the homegoing service uh our journey through um through this hour restore kind of already had me in a certain channel that once we got to the homegoing service I knew I was just going to pick up and just kind of share some of the things there that I'd be sharing here so um I was just I was just looking at this because when you look at this verse that we just read actually in this one verse in verse six there's actually two different comings of Elijah in verse 6 put it back on the screen there so everybody can follow me in verse 6 when he says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet then he says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that part right there is the ministry of John the Baptist sir hallelujah it's two different comings of Elijah so there's a coming of Elijah for the first coming of the Lord and then there's a coming of Elijah for the second coming the Lord so the ministry of Eli I mean the ministry of John the Baptist was to turn the heart of the fathers to the children amen but when you get and the Heart of the children to their fathers that is a separate Ministry and that ministry glory to God is the ministry of William Mary and brandham so in this one verse we got two different comings of the spirit of Elijah yes sir hallelujah amen two different comings and one verse in the and is a conjunction that brings it all together but then it says lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now um I got a little something that I would love to read on that um one one one one one one other scripture really quick before I read this next quote go to Luke 1 verse 13-1 17 that way uh you're not just taking my word but when I say it's two different comings of Elijah uh the first part goes to John the Baptist because it's spoken of right here in scripture uh Luke 1 verse 13 yeah through 17 look at it says this but the angel said said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb now I can just run right over the top of that but Brother brandom on while he was a little boy are y'all with me yes sir while he was a little boy his daddy had a moonshine still they was they was they they they made liquor for the young kids that might not know what moonshine is they made hard liquor and they was they and brother bradam was with even with his daddy he would have to take the water down to the Moonshine still Hallelujah and and while he's walking with the water down to the stem brother random just as a little boy he he saw how mothers were leaving home they're leaving their kids at home coming to the Moonshine still and drinking up something just carrying on ungodly lives down there and it just caused him to kind of he had a problem with mothers doing that he had a big problem but but as he was as he was taking the water down to the Moonshine still all of a sudden a voice spoke to him out of a tree one day said don't you ever smoke don't you ever drink as a little boy because I have a work for you to do when you get older am yes sir that voice that spoke to him I would say was a scriptural voice yes sir because John the Baptist couldn't do any of these things hallelujah look at what the Bible say here in ver verse 15 says uh uh for the Lord shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall uh for for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children John the Baptist ministry did the first part of verse six but brother Bam's Ministry does the second part of verse six now if you can receive John why can't you receive William Brown Hallelujah right so now look he says and he shall go before him in spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord so we know John the Baptist according to scripture was the Fulfillment of the first part of verse six Amen in Malachi 4 but there is a a quote here that I that I read at the Homing service and I want to read it again for you all this morning just to kindless to l ify this this is out of the message Jehovah Gyra uh part one praise the Lord praise the Lord my god Jehovah Gyra part one uh the prophet tells us this says we got to we got to get back to the word he says and we'll do it because God said I will restore saith the Lord all the years that the cankerworm and the Palmer worms eat is going to bloom out in the evening time there will come forth one with a message glory to God he'll restore the hearts of the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers he promised it in Malachi 4 that he would do it return them back again now this isn't Elijah that was talked of in the Bible Jesus said in Matthew 11 if you can receive it John there was the Elias that was to come of Malachi 3 all right behold I send my messenger before my face Malachi 3 you find that but remember the Malachi 4 the message comes the terrible day of the Lord shall come and shall burn up the whole earth and the righteous shall walk out upon the ashes of the wicked that never happened after John praise God he says that never happened after John no if that was it then the scripture has lost its whole it said something that wasn't so we got 2,000 years since then the world hasn't been burned not at all neither has the righteous walked out upon the ashes of the wicked but we're still waiting for that something that's going to take the faith and restore the faith of the children back to the original Pentecostal tree that the cankerworm eat up the Roman cankerworm caterpillar says all the denominations and Creeds eat it down eat it down God said I'll restore it again in the last days it will be restored God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planet word I like that statement God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way and the only way it's going to come now it has to be planted where I got to take time and lay this in the church that this whole year just been taking time the word got to be planted so the people know what to expect when it happened you know you're right in the words you know what you're looking at yes sir and I can't be planting and then somebody come behind me and unplant what I PL no we no we going to plant this and we going to wait for God to bring forth what he said he going to bring forth look now the holy and I and I appreciate all the ministers I just been watching them all the whole year y'all just go back and look at them listen to the sermons that were coming to you the ministers caught the same inspiration they been planting right along with me right brother amen right along with me oh my my my my my I I know I know where we're standing at church look at what he say he says he says the Holy Ghost uh God will send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word that will restore the word of God is a seed that a soul went forth to S now let me let me let me let me just I I mentioned there that there was that one verse demonstrated there were two comings of Elijah but however we know the prophet has taught us that the spirit of Elijah is used five times five times it's used and um and you know I was I was so grateful that the Lord just kind of showed me to slide that right into you the the the the the home the homegoing sermon and I was telling my wife you know when I was thinking about the thought I say you know typically I I go to a service a homegoing service and I Tri typically try not to preach over about 20 minutes um but uh I knew that as the what the Lord had given me say it's going to take me a little bit longer than 20 minutes to get this out it's going to be like we in church and um you know so I said but I'm this what the lord gave me so I'm going to just go with it and um and you know as as I went with it just kind of I felt that you know some of the different ones that would be coming you know to that service it would be one once more Lord right it it'll be a once more Lord experience like I I don't know if we'll ever see you again well actually I do know on the other side if if you can't receive it you're going to see this again because God will replay the whole whole service to you again right but I said I said you know on behalf of brother Wesco being the one that introduced the message to us you know the the African-American Community here in in South Florida he was the one that introduced it to us through his preaching and uh so it it's impacted all of our lives right so we we thank God God for for him you know taking a stand for this message so I said let me just try to bring something that that that would speak back to who he was and what he did what he did right and uh so as we were bringing that you know the Lord the Lord just kind of you know uh there was a few things that I had in my heart that I that I wanted to to to get to and the Lord just just dropped this little piece in there about these five different comings of Elijah and you know the first one was in Elijah himself and we're going to read a scripture really really quick uh Elijah s but this is why I say it's a restoration Ministry turn with me to First Kings 18 and we'll we'll see something here the ministry of Elijah is a restoration Ministry turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's and then also turn the hearts of the children to the fathers this is restoration right and um uh First Kings 18 the story here is that the children of Israel were were in a situation where they gotten away from uh following God they have a new God his name is Bale and uh they are there following him but you got some you still got some Believers in the camp of Israel and and one of them is a Prophet by the name of Elijah uh but he notices that these other people because King Ahab has uh married the wrong wife amen Ahab married the wrong wife when he married uh you know Jezebel it influenced him and it and it just it wre Havoc for Israel because this man married the wrong woman right and uh uh him being in a leadership position marrying the wrong woman it just it created problems for everybody right so so it's uh so so here you know Israel is now pulling away from uh from God and they've been introduced to Bell which is you know probably uh Jezebel's God uh and they've been introduced to that so finally Elijah come to a spot where he's like you know what H how how how long y'all going to Halt between two opinions it says um you know if God be God then serve him and if Bale be God then serve him and it says I tell you we going to put this thing to a test and we're going to get yall to you know agree to this he says let's build some altars and uh and y'all going to pray and y'all going to ask B to come down and and burn up the Altar and say then after y'all finish I'mma build an altar and and I'mma pray and I'mma ask God to burn down burn the altar he says and the god that answers by fire let him be God everybody say okay that sound good they got up they start praying they couldn't get no answer so then they start cutting the and young people if you ever get to the spot where you're cutting yourself you know that didn't come from God that is a devil trying to take you out of here these these demonic worshippers were cutting themselves they start cutting themselves and and L say look y'all need to scream a little harder cuz maybe your God is going on vacation maybe he harder here what I don't know what he he he say all and full hundred of them out there praying like that no no answer at all Elijah said okay it's enough it was the evening time it was an evening time and Elijah walked up and said okay now I'mma dig some trenches and I'mma pour water pour water in there three times and when he poured the water in uh then then then then let's pick him up over here in in First Kings 18:35 oh Hallelujah 34 and he said do it the second time they did the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offerings of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at TH my word let's keep reading watch them now hear me oh oh Lord hear me that this P the this people may know that thou art the Lord God that thou has turned their heart back again hey wait a minute wait a minute that turning of the heart happened with John the Baptist ministry and that turning of the heart also happens with William Brandon's Ministry it started with Elijah yes sir so the Same Spirit of Elijah is doing exact same thing Hallelujah that it did in Elijah it did the same thing for John the Baptist and for William brandom glory to God this is a bible-based Ministry Hallelujah let me let me tell y'all something let me just say I'm I'm coming home you go to the average denomination Church they could not tell you what scriptures they standing on as to why they believe what they believe but here in the message we can show you in the Bible why we believe what we believe that's right exactly right amen standing on the word this is not some I mean don't please don't get your mind just only on the man brother Brandon brother BR get your mind on the word I'm reading to you scripture yes sir I'm reading scripture and I'm showing you how the scripture was manifested this Bible will never become unlocked to you until you can hear from a prophet yeah you'll always be be wondering about the scripture but if you can just open up and hear if you will just receive it yes sir oh Lord have mercy you you'll see these things just open up to you uh this was the first coming of Elijah um and I'm I'm I'm winding down I'm I'm winding down I'm winding down I gave you the other two comings of Elijah I'mma I'mma give you I'mma give you I'm just I'm skipping around a little bit here the the the fifth coming of Elijah I didn't I didn't do the second I'll come back to the second I'm winding down but the fifth coming of Elijah was out of uh Revelation 11 verse 3-6 verse 3 through6 Revelation 11 and uh this is Promised according to scripture the fifth coming I'm talking about the five different comings of Elijah and I'm giving you a scripture for it um One Was Elijah himself uh the second is going to be Elisha we'll get back to that and then uh John the Baptist is is Malachi 3:1 was referred to earlier uh also Revelation I'm sorry Malachi 45 and6 also speaks of John the Baptist and brother brandom's Ministry and uh Revelation 11 is speaking of Elijah himself now I I don't know yeah okay let me just read this real quick verse three says and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,23 s days clothe and sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devour their enemies and if any man uh hurt them he must in this manner be killed look these have the power to shut Heaven glory to God that it rain not in the days of their prophecy now look I I need to understand when we say that the that this is uh Elijah and Moses as the two witnesses because different churches teach so many different things the reason we say it's Elijah and Moses Moses even though the Bible does not give us their names the way we can tell who the Witnesses are their Ministries are identified in the scripture so when the Bible says uh uh verse six it says these have power to shut the heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy that happened in Elijah's Ministry yes sir Hallelujah that's how we know that's Elijah glory to God amen and uh um and and goes on says um and have power over Waters that turn them to blood that happened in Moses Ministry praise the Lord amen and to Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will you talking about somebody can speak the word did did Moses SP Smite with plagues yes he did this is Moses Ministry look at it now it says um and when they shall finish their testimony the be that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them all right so we we find here that the second I mean this fifth coming of Elijah is Elijah himself according to Revelation 11 the second one the second time the spirit of Elijah was used was found in 2 Kings 2 verse 9-4 let me just read that and I'll close off right here we got the five comers of Elijah I love the word of the Lord I love for the church to get settled on the word we got to plant these seeds so the church know where they at we're we we took we took a whole year planting and we still got some more that we that we we putting in there but I'm telling you the truth you will see a man manifestation of what has been planted amen it'll be an overflow it'll be an overflow this is the second time the spirit of Elijah was used it's in 2 Kings chapter 2 and the story the backstory of this is uh Elijah is now going off to SE God is calling him home and um uh Elisha had been following him and just been you know just just just staying right in tune with what Elijah was saying and you know losing a a great man like Elijah this would have been really difficult for Elija but the thing that uh Eli Elisha recognized that Elijah was not doing any of this on his own Elijah was anointed with a spirit from God so Elisha knew that if he could get the same thing that Elijah got then the work would go on praise the Lord somebody there is much that I could say here there is much but sometimes you got to be able to read between the lines let me put it on the church as a whole our Elijah is already gone but there was a spirit in Elijah that caused him to do the things that he did Hallelujah and that same Spirit the holy spirit is now in Elisha I got a quote on this you know he he he says The The J and the Sha he says notice the he and the she that's right so Elisha represents you and and and can I say it again Elish Elisha had a double portion of the spirit of Elijah the restoration brings double amen yes sir let me read it y'all 2 Kings chapter 2:9 it's it's there is I'm starting at verse one I'm not going to skip I'm starting at verse one it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here he was him I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to bethl and Elisha said un him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl and the sons of the prophets there uh that were at bethl came forth to Elisha and said un him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yay I know it hold ye your peace and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord have sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho my God see Jericho is where the walls had come down says and the sons of the prophets that were at Jero came to Elisha and said to him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered y I know it hold ye your peace so we got prophets in Jericho we got prophets and bethl they all over the place right they said but hold your peace hold your peace now verse six and Elijah said to him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord ha sent me to Jordan which represents a death amen and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not lead thee and they too went on watch this and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood the view a far off and they stood by the they two stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoke the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were going over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee Oh Glory to God and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing glory to God glory to God he asks for it he asks for it he asks for it and the Bible going to tell us that he got it before brother Wesco passed I was given an opportunity to go to his bed side and to um just pay my respects and I went there to the hospital I got a call and um I was told you know they would not everybody knew where brother Wesco was but they they let me know and I went to his bedside and uh he wasn't able to you know respond to me anything like that but I I took the opportunity to tell him so brother West go even when I'm seeing you like this you have taught us so much faith that it's it's hard for us to receive anything the doctor saying and until breath leave your body we just going to believe God and I told him I said brother W's go uh I know that you can hear me you might not be able to respond but I know you can hear me say I just want to tell you thank you thank you for your years of service you impacted my life you impacted the life of my family you impacted the life of our church you impacted this community thank you for your life we just thank God for you and and if this is your time to go home receive your reward we're going to be all right but you receive your reward and and and I just had a chance just to kind of have a little moment with them just to just express my thanks so if you see me when I go let's read let's read and it came to pass I'm sorry verse 10 and it said thou Hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so it says and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both the suay and Elijah went up by a world went into into heaven Elijah saw it and carried and and and cried he cried he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces he took up Al also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan now we know he went back to Jordan and he struck the Jordan Jordan opened up just like it did for Elijah showing that the spirit of Elijah was now resting on Elijah those words my father my father The Chariot of is The Horseman thereof years ago I used you know just I knew that brother Brandon when he um he came to see about uh brother uh Bosworth and brother Bosworth was in Miami Florida and brother brandom came to see about him and when he walked into the the sick room when he walked into the hospital he he he screamed those words my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and brother brandom you know said that over Bosworth and I said you know if something ever happened to brother Wesco those are going to be the words that I use over him so if you saw one of my posts I only put one post out there I put one post those were the words that I used and I was praying God how could I slip this into the sermon and God gave me the five comings of Elijah and it would slip right into the sermon if you see me when I go now we not trying to get brother wesco's Spirit we want the spirit that was on brother Wesco which was the Holy Spirit but I'll tell you what we are doing we have a meeting in July we're going to host it at Spirit and Truth [Applause] Tabernacle so um I feel God's given us that and we going we going to ride it through we
