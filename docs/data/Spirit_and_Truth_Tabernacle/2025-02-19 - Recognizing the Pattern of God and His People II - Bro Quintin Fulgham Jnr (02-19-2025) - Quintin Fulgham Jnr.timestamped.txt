[5:04] services oh Lord God is is is just what
[5:07] we'll do on the other side oh Lord God
[5:10] Lord this isn't something where we just
[5:12] some kind of ritual or traditional Lord
[5:14] Jesus Christ where we're just coming to
[5:16] church on a Wednesday or a Sunday as as
[5:19] something to do oh Lord Jesus Christ
[5:20] Lord your Prophet said when Adam and Eve
[5:23] were in the garden oh Lord and the cool
[5:25] of the evening would come oh Lord God it
[5:27] said Lord your spirit just came came
[5:30] down oh Lord Jesus it flowed through the
[5:33] trees it flowed through the animals oh
[5:35] Lord God it flowed to Adam and Eve oh
[5:37] Lord God they knew it was time to talk
[5:40] with you oh Lord God they knew it was
[5:42] time to commune with you oh Lord God
[5:44] they wanted to hear your voice oh Lord
[5:46] God lord it was such a joy oh Lord God I
[5:49] could see the maybe the Goosebumps and
[5:51] chills come over them when you begun to
[5:53] step down into the garden oh Lord and
[5:55] talk with your children oh Lord God Lord
[5:57] this isn't just another event oh Lord
[6:00] Jesus Christ Lord you're trying to
[6:02] restore your church back to you oh Lord
[6:04] God Lord you're trying to restore us
[6:06] back to the time oh Lord God where it
[6:09] wasn't any preaching oh Lord God it
[6:11] wasn't any it wasn't necessarily any
[6:13] praying or fasting oh Lord God lord we
[6:15] could walk right up to your presence oh
[6:17] Lord Jesus Christ no fear oh Lord God no
[6:21] sin oh Lord Jesus Christ nothing to hide
[6:24] oh Lord Jesus Christ we could walk right
[6:26] up to your presence and enjoy you fully
[6:28] oh Lord God Lord we thank you for this
[6:31] opportunity that you've given us oh Lord
[6:32] God lord right now you see your people
[6:35] oh lord they're in need oh Lord God lord
[6:37] they need a healing touch from you Lord
[6:39] they need a word from you they need
[6:41] something oh Lord God you know their
[6:42] hearts oh Lord Jesus Christ I'm just a
[6:45] man oh Lord God but I prayed oh Lord
[6:47] that you will use these lips oh Lord God
[6:49] to speak a word of Hope to them oh Lord
[6:51] God speak a word of faith oh Lord God
[6:54] give them something that they can cling
[6:56] onto oh Lord God for we know oh Lord God
[6:58] this word is more than life oh Lord God
[7:01] lord you said in your word man shall not
[7:03] live by bread alone oh Lord God but by
[7:06] every word oh Lord Jesus Christ is more
[7:08] to us than just physical food oh Lord
[7:11] God lord it's something we really can
[7:13] hold on to and cling on to and digest oh
[7:16] Lord and let it become a part of who we
[7:18] are oh Lord Jesus Christ so Lord I ask
[7:21] that you speak the words of healing oh
[7:23] Lord speak the words of blessing and
[7:25] overflow over your people oh Lord God so
[7:28] they'll know Lord God that you the the
[7:31] the love you have for us oh Lord God oh
[7:34] God the love you the the love and the uh
[7:36] the joy that you have to see us gathered
[7:38] here once again just as it was in the
[7:40] beginning oh Lord God be with us in this
[7:42] message oh Lord God and in this service
[7:44] oh Lord God and the precious name of
[7:46] Jesus Christ
[7:48] amen amen so we're going to get started
[7:51] right into this um right into the
[7:54] service um so this will be uh the title
[7:57] that the Lord had given me last time uh
[7:59] recognizing the pattern of God and his
[8:01] people this is part two with the
[8:03] subtitle of overflow after the stand
[8:07] right so now we're going to read Joel uh
[8:11] chapter 2 uh veres 23- 26 before you're
[8:15] seated so we'll wait for her to pull it
[8:18] up to get started in this
[8:23] journey thank you
[8:26] Jesus and it reads here it says be glad
[8:30] then ye children of Zion and rejoice in
[8:32] the Lord your God for he hath given you
[8:35] the former Reign moderately and he he
[8:37] will cause to come down on you the rain
[8:40] the former rain and the latter rain in
[8:42] the first month and the floor shall be
[8:44] full of Wheat and the vat shall overflow
[8:46] with wine and oil and I will restore to
[8:49] you the years that the Locust have eaten
[8:51] the cankerworm and the caterpillar and
[8:53] the Palmer wor my great Army which I
[8:55] sent among you and ye shall eat in
[8:57] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[8:59] name of the Lord your God that have
[9:01] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[9:04] shall never be ashamed may the Lord add
[9:06] a blessing to his word as you uh take
[9:08] your
[9:10] seats so we're now in this we're now in
[9:14] this transition where in the first part
[9:17] of the message we wanted to make sure
[9:19] that we were Christians first that we
[9:20] were identified to be what a Christian
[9:22] was so we can confirm that it's who it's
[9:26] who we are in this life right um so when
[9:29] when you become a Christian which means
[9:31] that you've been changed back you've
[9:33] been changed back into the image of God
[9:35] now God can have trust in you right God
[9:38] can only trust his word God doesn't
[9:39] trust your feelings that God doesn't
[9:41] trust what you say but when he can see
[9:43] his word reflecting inside of you now
[9:45] God can trust you with some stuff right
[9:48] and in order for God to bless you on
[9:50] this side of Earth he has to test you he
[9:53] can't just hand it to you right and so
[9:55] when you become a Christian right it
[9:57] gives the new birth actually helps you
[9:59] to stand a test so that's why God you
[10:02] know you don't worry don't worry about
[10:04] overflow and if you this is if you're
[10:06] not a if you haven't received a baptism
[10:08] Holy Spirit uh on the line or wherever
[10:10] you are don't worry about blessings
[10:12] first that's where people get things
[10:14] wrong they want a blessings they want an
[10:16] increase they want more money they want
[10:18] a better job they want their health
[10:20] restore don't even worry about those
[10:22] things first make sure you're a
[10:23] Christian on the inside because God can
[10:26] only give you things as you pass a test
[10:30] right so before we begin this journey we
[10:32] want to kind of flesh out what we talked
[10:34] about last time I started a little bit
[10:36] of it and we're going to kind of get
[10:37] into it some more to kind of see um uh
[10:41] the depthness of it and it's the
[10:42] difference between a blessing and an
[10:44] increase because this is the area where
[10:46] a lot of people tend to get things wrong
[10:48] and make a lot of um decisions that can
[10:51] be very detrimental right so we want to
[10:54] see why we want the word first which is
[10:56] why I love how brother Jack has been
[10:58] preaching uh this overflow is not just a
[11:00] physical overflow but a spiritual
[11:02] overflow first so we're going to turn to
[11:05] Luke chapter
[11:07] 17 uh we're going to read uh verses uh
[11:18] 11-9 and it says and it came to pass as
[11:21] he went to Jerusalem that he passed
[11:22] through the midst of Sam uh Samaria and
[11:25] Galilee and as he entered into a certain
[11:27] Village there met he 10 men that were
[11:29] lepers which stood afar and they lifted
[11:31] up their voices and said Jesus Master
[11:34] have mercy on us so all of these 10
[11:36] lepers right all these 10 lepers right
[11:38] here they had faith and they recognized
[11:41] that Jesus was a master this was out of
[11:44] their own mouths verse 14 says and when
[11:47] we and when he saw them he said unto
[11:48] them go show yourselves unto the priests
[11:50] and it came to pass that as they went
[11:52] they were cleansed and one of them when
[11:54] he heard when he saw that he was healed
[11:56] turned back and with a loud voice
[11:58] glorify God
[11:59] and fell down on his fell down on his
[12:02] face at his feet giving him thanks and
[12:04] he was a Samaritan and Jesus answered
[12:06] and said where there are not 10 cleans
[12:09] cleansed but where are the nine there
[12:11] are not found that return to give glory
[12:14] to God Save The Stranger and he said
[12:17] unto him arise go thy way thy faith has
[12:20] made thee whole so we're going to turn
[12:23] to the message who is this preached in
[12:25] 59 uh paragraph 78 and we're going to
[12:28] kind of see
[12:29] exactly what the prophet's thoughts were
[12:32] about this group of people the prophet
[12:35] says and he and as he come writing in
[12:38] lots of the people say he's a Healer oh
[12:40] we seen him Open the Eyes of the blind
[12:43] we seen him make the crippled man to
[12:44] walk we seen him offer prayer and a
[12:46] fever left the child but then those type
[12:49] and I want you to realize he said type
[12:50] so he's he's classifying this group into
[12:53] a type of people he said those type were
[12:56] only following him for the Loaves and
[12:57] the fishes and that's the way the Crowds
[13:00] Are today many if there's a Healer while
[13:02] they they follow him and he's just he's
[13:04] just in Oasis if they get sick they run
[13:06] say oh will you please pray for me that
[13:08] the Lord Jesus will make me well and as
[13:11] soon as they come out of the hospital or
[13:12] the sick bed right back into the world
[13:16] they go like a dog to its vomit or a hog
[13:19] to its wallow as the scripture said just
[13:22] follow him for what they can get out of
[13:24] him they use them just for a totem pole
[13:27] or something that that they can get from
[13:29] him and don't expect to serve him that
[13:31] crowd still goes on today so those
[13:34] Spirits are still here today and we want
[13:36] to make sure that we're not identified
[13:38] with this group right which means we
[13:40] have to we have to make choices that are
[13:42] different from what they've done we have
[13:44] to we have to we have to think about
[13:46] blessing in a different light than what
[13:47] these guys thought about
[13:49] it verse 80 says there were nine lepers
[13:52] healed and one returned to give him
[13:54] praise or was it 10 they one of them one
[13:56] of them returned to give him praise and
[13:58] the rest of them went ahead ungrateful
[14:01] now the Bible says they were healed
[14:03] though yes sir and the prophet here says
[14:05] that they walked around and he called
[14:07] him ungrateful wow so they had a healing
[14:10] they had a blessing but it was something
[14:13] negative to it the prophet couldn't
[14:15] fully uh fully accept this thing so
[14:18] that's why I say we have to realize
[14:20] there is a difference between blessing
[14:21] and increase right there is a difference
[14:24] between a blessing and increase and so
[14:27] now they all received it increase right
[14:30] and that was an increase of Health right
[14:32] but only one of them that I can see in
[14:34] my eyes that's why I kind of stand
[14:35] behind what the prophet says I can only
[14:36] see one of them really got a blessing
[14:38] right and there was that one Le leopard
[14:40] that came back to consider the word the
[14:43] source of where he received this
[14:45] blessing right and uh the Bible says
[14:48] that um he was made whole and I like
[14:50] that word wholeness because whenever the
[14:53] word says hold that means god is
[14:55] completely satisfied with this situation
[14:58] so if you don't if if you don't if you
[14:59] don't receive a wholeness with your
[15:01] increase that means that there's
[15:02] something wrong right there's a question
[15:04] in God's mind and you have to ask you
[15:06] have to you try you have to try to
[15:08] identify what is wrong with this
[15:10] situation this situation right and
[15:13] so blessing is actually the easy part A
[15:17] lot of people don't realize that
[15:18] blessings are actually the easy part and
[15:21] you know I believe I'm looking at some
[15:22] millionaires right now in this church
[15:24] right
[15:25] now amen
[15:32] amen come on brother I believe I'm
[15:34] looking at some CEOs that are that have
[15:36] successful businesses to God right there
[15:39] is nothing too hard for
[15:41] God Amen God wants to bless you more
[15:45] than you want to be blessed amen you
[15:47] ever had like you ever notice a kid um
[15:50] like you know a kid will want to go and
[15:51] be successful but their parents when
[15:53] when a when when you have a good father
[15:55] and a good mother and your kid wants to
[15:58] be your kid wants to go do something
[15:59] your parents will go overboard just to
[16:02] see you successful right and when they
[16:04] see you competing in the sports they'll
[16:06] be the loudest ones in the stand when
[16:07] you graduate your family they're the
[16:09] loudest one your family would do they
[16:11] want to do so much more extra than what
[16:13] you really want and that's just how God
[16:16] is with his children God wants to see
[16:18] you more successful than you want to be
[16:21] successful right so blessings that's
[16:24] that's that's the easy part and and the
[16:26] thing about it is we've already been
[16:29] shown by the gifts in this church that
[16:31] God is with us God has already stated he
[16:34] with us not some other church and their
[16:36] gifts not what God has done in the past
[16:39] not what God has done at Brenham
[16:40] Tabernacle or some other great church
[16:43] but what God is doing in this very
[16:45] Church which means it's got to be
[16:48] personal to you hallelujah amen yes sir
[16:52] so we want to continue on this journey
[16:54] now because we want to make sure that we
[16:57] don't end up like this group of people
[17:00] that were the prophet said was
[17:01] ungrateful so we're going to turn to
[17:03] Luke chap
[17:05] 16 and we're going to read verses um 19-
[17:11] 21 just to uh identify these types
[17:14] because it's always good the um the one
[17:17] of the themes of the message is patterns
[17:19] and you want to make sure that you're
[17:20] following a good pattern so that means
[17:22] you got to be able to identify the bad
[17:23] patterns of what not to
[17:25] follow so Luke 16:19 says there was a
[17:29] certain rich man which was clothed in
[17:31] purple and fine linen and fared
[17:33] sumptuously every day and there was a
[17:35] certain beggar named Lazarus which was
[17:37] laid at his gate full of
[17:39] sores and 21 verse 21 says and Desiring
[17:42] to be fed with the crumbs which fell
[17:44] from the rich man's table moreover the
[17:46] dogs came and licked his sores right so
[17:51] we the prophet told us that this rich
[17:54] young fellow right here was a very
[17:56] religious guy we we uh the prophet typed
[17:59] him in the Bible to the guy that came up
[18:01] to Christ and Christ told him to sell
[18:02] all his riches and he was just that was
[18:05] just too hard for him to do when he
[18:07] rejected the word but he was very
[18:09] religious Christ identified that he
[18:11] lived a certain life according to the
[18:13] word right when he said have done all of
[18:16] these things and of course uh Jesus
[18:17] Christ being a prophet could perceive
[18:19] that he was telling the truth right but
[18:21] religion just won't do it you need
[18:24] something more than religion all right
[18:27] now I can say that he got increase after
[18:29] this the Bible said his barns exploded
[18:32] that's exactly right right I mean he was
[18:34] successful I mean his bank account was
[18:36] never never never zero but I can't call
[18:39] it a
[18:41] blessing there something I can't
[18:44] identify now the next thing to kind of
[18:46] look into this Bible verse is we have
[18:48] Lazarus out here now Lazarus was a real
[18:52] genuine Christian amen everybody knows
[18:54] Lazarus was a real genuine Christian and
[18:56] we can tell that because of his end
[18:59] right so that meant that Lazarus was a
[19:02] representation of the word Jesus said
[19:05] that if you stand for me on this Earth
[19:08] on that day I'll stand for you so here
[19:10] was Lazarus a representation of a word
[19:12] of what a Christian uh was to be and so
[19:15] we can say that the word was hidden
[19:18] behind these swords and begging in
[19:20] Lazarus on the outside of the rich man
[19:22] you ruler's house right so the when the
[19:25] Bible says he was a beggar it says that
[19:28] he needed help help so the word needs
[19:30] help right God needs help
[19:33] sometimes and notice uh when the rich
[19:36] rich when the Lazarus was asking for
[19:39] something to eat you know he wasn't
[19:41] asking for you know a plate Fresh Off
[19:44] The Grill or the stove he wasn't asking
[19:46] for no crab cakes or king crab legs or
[19:50] nothing like that he wasn't asking for
[19:52] caviar or none of the finest thing the
[19:55] Bible just said he just wanted a crumb
[19:57] all he wanted was just a chome and I
[19:59] want to and it's important for us to
[20:01] realize that that God never ask us for
[20:04] much God never ask you for much right
[20:08] you know so it's funny to find that you
[20:10] know sometimes people have it's it's it
[20:12] becomes a problem when people pay their
[20:14] ties or when people play their offering
[20:17] and it's like God only ask for 10% of
[20:20] what you got not half not 70% not 90% he
[20:24] only wants the crumbs of what you got
[20:27] wow and so
[20:30] and so it's hard so it's hard for God to
[20:35] say you want a million and you're
[20:38] getting $2,000 a month and you struggle
[20:40] paying ties and offering on that and
[20:43] God's only asking for a little piece of
[20:45] it and you want him to give you more
[20:48] Lord see this is why God has to test us
[20:50] before he gives us these things because
[20:52] he wants to be able to trust us right
[20:55] some people find it hard to come to
[20:57] church on Sunday you know
[20:59] the churches be packed on Easter Sunday
[21:01] or any kind of conventions or if we have
[21:03] like you know we have the night of
[21:05] worship which is which is really really
[21:07] good and everyone wants to come out on
[21:08] the big events but when it's a Sunday
[21:10] service on a regular Sunday or a
[21:13] Wednesday service ain't no one to be
[21:15] found all right and when you think about
[21:17] it services on Sunday last about two
[21:20] hours and brother Jack make sure that
[21:22] everyone gets a time limit
[21:24] right so it's not much Wednesday service
[21:27] is about 2 hours so that's about 4 hours
[21:30] out of your week God just wants the
[21:31] crumbs of your time God just wants the
[21:34] Crums of your time right and that's a
[21:36] problem for some people though right so
[21:40] this Bible in the Bible it says that
[21:42] Lazarus was at the Gate of the Rich
[21:44] Young Ruler he wasn't somewhere that was
[21:46] far away right meaning the word was
[21:49] still close to this Rich Young Ruler
[21:51] right and he had the opportunity to help
[21:53] it the Rich Young Ruler probably passed
[21:55] the gate a million times and saw Lazarus
[21:58] out there and not once acknowledged
[22:00] Lazarus it was only when he was it was
[22:03] too late that he wanted to reach out for
[22:04] Lazarus that's the only time he
[22:06] acknowledged him but then it was too
[22:08] late so even with this increase of
[22:11] wealth that he had and he told Jesus oh
[22:14] you know I obeyed my parents I do this I
[22:16] did that even with all the religion that
[22:18] he had not one time could he help out
[22:21] this fellow believer which was a real
[22:23] Christian in his time of need couldn't
[22:25] even get him a crumb right though he was
[22:28] religious and have plenty to help with
[22:31] so you can't say that oh I'm going to
[22:33] you know if God gives me a million
[22:35] dollars I'm just going to help out the
[22:36] church if with $2,000 you're struggling
[22:39] with that God knows it's a lie right God
[22:44] can't God can't God can't bless some God
[22:46] can't bless somebody with an attitude
[22:48] like that now we want to contrast
[22:51] because we're looking at patterns we
[22:52] want to contrast to another rich young
[22:54] fellow in the Bible and we're actually
[22:56] going to turn to dedication the message
[22:59] dedication preached in
[23:01] 62 and this is uh paragraph um 30 yep so
[23:07] the prophet says here now David under
[23:09] desire and Revelation thought in his
[23:11] heart a very Gallant thing when David
[23:15] being a fair man and well loved with the
[23:17] people and God had blessed him in so
[23:19] many ways and he said now is it right
[23:21] that I set here in a nice home that the
[23:24] Lord has given me and the Ark of the
[23:26] Covenant of God out there under curtains
[23:29] now the Arc of the Covenant represents
[23:31] the word so this is go this is this is
[23:34] David's attitude towards the word right
[23:37] that was a very Gallant thing it was a
[23:39] revelation for David to know this
[23:41] because it wasn't it wasn't just right
[23:43] for him to have such a lovely place
[23:45] under the house of made of cedar which
[23:47] is a very expensive place and said then
[23:51] the Ark of the Covenant my God who gave
[23:53] me all these things still out there
[23:55] under tents so even in this overflow
[23:58] that God cuz God took David from a
[24:01] mighty long way he was out there uh
[24:03] shepher and sheep which was a job that
[24:06] was looked down upon and didn't even
[24:08] have the respect of his own father and
[24:10] the confidence of his own father so this
[24:13] God had then exalted David up into the
[24:16] palace and the prophet says here that he
[24:18] was living in Cedar that's what the
[24:20] Bible he's he's referencing the Bible
[24:22] verse of what David David said so it was
[24:24] an expensive place I mean he had the
[24:27] best horses he had had the best clothes
[24:29] his wives had the best clothes they had
[24:31] silk linen anything that they could ask
[24:33] for but in David's heart when he went
[24:36] out there and he saw the word of the
[24:38] Lord under a tent there was a problem
[24:40] with him see that's who God's looking
[24:43] for God's looking for somebody that if
[24:45] no matter how much He blesses you no
[24:47] matter how much he increases you and
[24:49] exalts you what you're always
[24:51] considering the word right there's
[24:52] something inside your heart that's
[24:54] always considering well what about the
[24:56] word I can't be all the way up here word
[24:58] all the way down there David said no we
[25:00] got to bring the word up
[25:01] too that's when you know you have a
[25:04] blessing right that's when you know when
[25:05] you have a blessing when you considering
[25:08] uh the Lord first and so what we could
[25:10] say is that if we were to switch the
[25:12] positions of these young rich people and
[25:15] last and the Rich Young Ruler would have
[25:17] been in David's spot you know the
[25:19] kingdom would have been in shambles he
[25:21] wouldn't have done nothing for the
[25:23] kingdom he would have done nothing for
[25:24] the people he would have walked past the
[25:26] ark and not even bad at the eye because
[25:28] he did the the same thing with Lazarus
[25:30] now if David would have been put into
[25:32] his position I could we if we could
[25:33] dramatize I could see David one day
[25:35] coming outside uh going to his room and
[25:37] open up his blinds and looking outside
[25:39] and seeing Lazarus out there and going
[25:41] to a service saying hey who's this man
[25:43] oh his name is Lazarus he's a Believer
[25:45] he's really going through some hard time
[25:47] and David is like no not not not not in
[25:49] my house bring him in here clean up his
[25:52] Source give him some food give him one
[25:54] of my robes I can't have no believer out
[25:56] there just struggling while we up in
[25:58] here uh uh eating good right so that's
[26:02] that's the uh that's the kind of uh
[26:05] that's the kind of spirit God can bless
[26:08] the prophet said that when you actually
[26:10] go down God exalts you more God can give
[26:14] you more when you go down going down
[26:16] means to consider the word right and so
[26:19] what we want to look at next right
[26:22] because we want to be identified with
[26:24] the right group so uh the amazing thing
[26:27] as we said before the amazing thing
[26:29] about blessings from God is that um God
[26:32] already has them prepared it's not
[26:34] something you have to work for it's not
[26:36] something you necessarily have to do a
[26:37] lot of planning for God has it already
[26:39] uh prepared for you so in the beginning
[26:41] as I love to go back to uh Genesis 1 uh
[26:45] when God um and I'm just going to
[26:47] paraphrase when God created uh uh the
[26:50] Earth you know before he brought Adam
[26:53] onto the scene he created the sun he
[26:56] created the moon he created the stars
[26:57] and the the sky and the water and the
[27:00] animals and the fish and the uh the
[27:02] fruit and everything this Garden was
[27:04] just a big blessing and it was already
[27:07] prepared before Adam came onto the scene
[27:10] right so when God created Adam in
[27:12] Genesis 1 uh when the Bible says it
[27:15] created him it was a spiritual man right
[27:17] it was a man and a female was made out
[27:19] the image of God and God is a God is a
[27:21] spirit right and then God had to then
[27:25] provide him a body in order for him to
[27:27] enjoy the blessings so the next thing he
[27:29] did was he came and he created a body
[27:31] Out of the Dust and he put a spirit
[27:32] inside of there and God and the thing I
[27:35] love about God is when God has your
[27:38] blessings lined up for you he makes sure
[27:40] everything is in line he makes sure
[27:42] everything is is laid out he doesn't cut
[27:46] Corners he doesn't you don't got to go
[27:48] into your blessing wondering well what
[27:50] about this or what about that God takes
[27:53] care of every single
[27:55] step he's concerned about his kids yes
[27:58] sir right so this is where you know God
[28:02] um prep and we're going to read later on
[28:04] in the uh in in the Bible in in in a
[28:06] second how God prepared the garden for
[28:09] Adam and his wife first before he put
[28:11] him in now this is the part where people
[28:13] get things tricked up and this is why we
[28:15] need a prophet of the day to tell us
[28:17] what time we're in and where we're at
[28:19] because God just those blessings that
[28:22] God had for Adam he just gave it to him
[28:24] Adam didn't have to prove anything in
[28:26] order to get his Blessing God Adam
[28:28] didn't have to go through any tests
[28:30] because like we said before he was
[28:31] already perfect he was already in a
[28:33] perfect stage but we know now according
[28:36] to the prophet and the prophet always
[28:38] brings this up we know now that we are
[28:41] imperfect beings as far as the flesh so
[28:44] we have to fight for every blessing
[28:47] God's not just going to drop it into
[28:48] your hands but a lot of times we get
[28:50] that mindset where we want to be like
[28:52] Adam and we just want God just to drop
[28:55] it in our lap you know we want some
[28:56] healing we want God just to he right
[28:58] then there you know we want to be a
[29:00] millionaires we want God just to drop
[29:01] the money right then the there we want
[29:03] we want God to help us with this and
[29:04] that we want God to do it just right
[29:06] quick just like he did with Adam but we
[29:08] are not living during that time right
[29:10] now we're in a time where we have to
[29:12] fight for every single
[29:15] blessing right praise God so going to
[29:20] Genesis 2 uh and we're going to be we're
[29:22] going to read just a little bit some of
[29:24] of these verses from 7 to 15 go on to
[29:27] Genesis 2 we want to kind of see how God
[29:29] had all of this uh laid out um for Adam
[29:33] in verse 7 it says and the Lord God
[29:35] formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground
[29:38] and breathed into his nostrils the
[29:39] breath of life and a Man became a living
[29:41] Soul so now he's in a body and the Lord
[29:44] God planted a garden East Eastward in
[29:46] Eden and there he put the man whom he
[29:49] formed and out of the ground made the
[29:51] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[29:53] Pleasant to the sight and good for food
[29:55] and the life of of uh the tree of of
[29:58] life also in the midst of garden and the
[29:59] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil verse
[30:01] 10 says and a river went out of Eden to
[30:04] water the garden so here is God now he
[30:07] created the uh he created the world and
[30:10] now he's preparing the garden now he's
[30:11] preparing he's making sure everything is
[30:13] in order just before Adam comes to take
[30:15] this thing over and this is and and
[30:17] that's why I say we're identifying
[30:18] patterns so whatever need that you have
[30:20] God is already arranging stuff God is
[30:23] already opening doors God already has
[30:26] every single resource in place
[30:28] and what that does it actually gives us
[30:30] Faith while we're going through a trial
[30:33] that we don't got to worry about
[30:34] anything because God has it already uh
[30:37] uh uh already available for us right it
[30:40] says verse 10 says and a river went out
[30:42] to Eden to water the garden and from
[30:44] then it was parted and became into
[30:46] foreheads verse 11 says the name of the
[30:48] first is Pyon that is which compasses
[30:51] the whole land of havala where there is
[30:53] gold and the gold of that land is good
[30:56] there is bellium and the Onyx I mean God
[30:59] had all the resources for Adam ad I mean
[31:02] it's Adam didn't have to Adam didn't
[31:05] have to pay property
[31:12] tax he didn't have to take
[31:14] out he didn't have to take out a
[31:16] mortgage right he didn't have to ask God
[31:19] well you know my credit score is looking
[31:21] a little bit low I don't know if I can
[31:23] live up north uh in in the north side of
[31:25] the garden right there were no ho8 Fe
[31:29] right he didn't have to pray for the
[31:30] land and fast for the land they didn't
[31:32] have to fight over the gold God just
[31:35] provided it for them God had it all laid
[31:37] out before them uh for them to enjoy it
[31:40] right and God provided a a physical body
[31:44] uh and with attributes for him to be
[31:45] able to enjoy those blessings right so
[31:48] your
[31:49] overflow even though we have to fight in
[31:51] this time and this time and age uh if
[31:54] you remember the children of Israel God
[31:57] had the land for them right the land was
[31:59] already set and Not only was the land
[32:02] already set but the way to the land was
[32:04] set as well all they had to do was just
[32:06] follow the light amen it and when they
[32:09] got to the land they saw so many enemies
[32:11] inside of there but Joshua because he
[32:14] stayed behind the light of the age knew
[32:16] we got to fight for this right everyone
[32:18] that didn't stand behind Moses didn't
[32:20] catch the light and they thought God was
[32:21] just going to give it to him so God just
[32:24] left them behind so it's important to
[32:26] follow your life for your age because
[32:28] it'll give you the spirit you need in
[32:29] order uh to overcome that right and so
[32:33] your your your your overflow is already
[32:35] there you might have some amorites and
[32:38] all of these unbelievers on your land
[32:40] but that doesn't make a difference to
[32:42] the
[32:43] believer it doesn't make a difference to
[32:45] the believer who's on your land right
[32:48] God said it's mine I'm going to get it
[32:50] amen right so you know you say you know
[32:53] you might you might need some healing in
[32:55] your body and you say your body is just
[32:57] so broken down down right some people
[32:59] are some people deal with chronic pain
[33:01] uh which can be very very devastating to
[33:03] the mental and it the mental faculties
[33:06] and all that kind of stuff but when God
[33:08] gives a word of healing God has to
[33:10] provide a way for that right so you may
[33:14] say that the doctors well the doctor
[33:16] said that you know this is incurable
[33:18] there's currently no cure for this thing
[33:20] but a Believer looks at the word right
[33:22] it's not the job of a doctor to prepare
[33:24] the way it's the job of God to prepare
[33:27] the way for your
[33:28] healing right um and healing was a
[33:31] blessing that was in the garden uh that
[33:33] Adam and Eve enjoyed they they enjoyed
[33:35] this blessing as long as they stayed on
[33:37] on the word and so I'm thankful that the
[33:40] uh that God you know so mindful of us in
[33:43] our time that when he sent the prophet
[33:45] he gave the prophet some hard cases of
[33:48] healing right there were people that
[33:50] were missing limbs they were people that
[33:52] had limbs shorter than other ones and
[33:54] they came before The Prophet I'm so
[33:56] thankful that brother Brandon was able
[33:58] to identify the word right to Showcase
[34:01] God's absolute power right because no
[34:04] matter the circumstance when God said
[34:06] you were healed and you needed a limb
[34:08] God had to provide you with a new
[34:11] limb I ain't never seen any denomination
[34:14] preach anything like that or I a't seen
[34:16] no Miracles like that where people that
[34:18] were missing arms or missing legs and
[34:21] God snaap the leg right back on the
[34:23] person because they stood with the word
[34:26] right so God has your he God has your
[34:29] blessing for you no matter how hard it
[34:31] may look God already has everything
[34:33] provided for you right so we want to
[34:36] kind of go into the next part of this uh
[34:38] of this message where you know before
[34:41] you receive the blessing as we said
[34:43] we're in a different time age there's
[34:45] got to be a stand you have to make a
[34:47] stand because we are because we're
[34:49] headed back to Perfection God has to
[34:51] make sure that we are solid in our
[34:54] experience God doesn't want us to end up
[34:56] like the Rich Young Ruler where we have
[34:58] blessings but then at the end of the day
[35:00] you know we lose our soul right and
[35:02] that's why God loves to send test
[35:04] because it ensures that not only do we
[35:06] get an increase but we get an increase
[35:08] going in the right direction which is up
[35:11] right and so one of the uh people that I
[35:14] could uh that I think of in the Bible as
[35:17] far as uh as far as the increase or
[35:20] someone that took a stand for that
[35:21] blessing you have to talk about Abraham
[35:24] you got to talk about Abraham right he
[35:26] was he is the uh he is God's template
[35:29] for what a Christian is supposed to be
[35:32] today taking God at his word right so
[35:35] now God had came to Abraham after he
[35:38] called him out and God had confirmed to
[35:41] him in the spiritual that he would have
[35:42] a son right and Abraham the first time
[35:45] God came to Abraham and he said he would
[35:47] have the son Abraham said amen the Bible
[35:50] says it was counted to him righteousness
[35:52] next time he came around the Bible says
[35:54] Abraham laugh right um and he was trying
[35:58] to say well make ishmail the one God
[36:00] said no I said through you and Sarah I'm
[36:03] going to raise up Isaac and that's going
[36:04] to be the one and I love that I love
[36:07] that you know God allows these people to
[36:10] go through human things right because a
[36:12] lot of times you think about Abraham and
[36:14] he just stood and it is the truth he did
[36:16] stood but sometimes when God says things
[36:19] it can seem impossible right it can seem
[36:22] like it just can't happen like can you
[36:24] imagine if you're missing an arm and God
[36:25] says well you're going to get a new arm
[36:27] you're like well how's that going to
[36:28] happen like you know and they were
[36:30] living during a time where a
[36:31] technological advancement they didn't
[36:33] have the means for all of those kind of
[36:35] things so it can it can it can it can
[36:37] seem hard to believe uh but the but the
[36:39] beautiful thing about Abraham is that he
[36:42] still believed even against all of that
[36:45] and so now God came down in the flesh we
[36:48] know the story how God came into a body
[36:51] and came into come to fellowship with
[36:53] Abraham and Abraham believed what God
[36:56] had said so we're going to turn to gen
[36:58] uh uh Genesis 18 to kind of see how this
[37:02] played out verse uh
[37:07] 16 to kind of see how this uh thing
[37:13] played
[37:16] out and it says here and the men and the
[37:20] men rose up from then he's talking about
[37:22] God and the angels the group that was
[37:24] with them and looked toward Sodom and
[37:26] Abraham went with him to bring them on
[37:28] the way and the Lord said shall I hide
[37:30] from Abraham that thing which I do
[37:33] seeing that Abraham sh shall surely
[37:35] become a great and mighty nation and all
[37:38] the nations of the Earth shall be
[37:39] blessed in him for I know him that he
[37:41] will commit command his children and his
[37:44] household after him and they shall keep
[37:46] the way of the the Lord to do justice
[37:48] and judgment that the Lord may bring
[37:50] upon Abraham that which he hath spoken
[37:53] and I love this thing because when
[37:54] you're going through a trial when God
[37:56] has made you a promise and you're going
[37:58] through a hard time and you're praising
[38:00] the lord it's not easy and sometimes it
[38:03] can feel like you know you're alone in
[38:05] this thing but I love how this
[38:07] encouragement where God had come into
[38:09] flesh right and he had come to Abraham
[38:12] and now he's confirming the word to
[38:14] Abraham not just through spiritual but
[38:16] just through flesh now right to show to
[38:19] help uh uh Abraham and and and the way
[38:23] that he's speaking these things is he's
[38:25] talking as if it's already happened and
[38:27] I want to let you know that when you're
[38:29] going through your trial God will find a
[38:32] way to get a word to you when you're
[38:34] going through if he's got to find some
[38:37] kind of Flesh on the earth to inspire
[38:38] somebody to say something when you're
[38:40] going through a great trial and God will
[38:42] give a word to you in order for you to
[38:44] be encouraged so that you can stand on
[38:46] the word as well amen and so you know um
[38:51] and so God was confirming this word to
[38:54] him and the other thing that I like
[38:56] about this thing
[38:58] is
[39:00] um before but the verses before that God
[39:03] had instituted the um um the
[39:07] circumcision to uh Abraham and the
[39:10] circumcision was a sign of the baptism
[39:12] holy spirit because Abraham also got a
[39:14] new name as well right so Abraham was a
[39:17] different man now and so I like how when
[39:20] God um and this is the reason why when
[39:24] you receive the baptism in the Holy
[39:26] Spirit God wants to do more more for you
[39:28] than you wanted than what you want from
[39:30] him and so when the Lord was standing
[39:32] there next to Abraham and he looked at
[39:33] Abraham and he had a new name and he had
[39:35] a body change you know when he said
[39:37] these word he said um he said the Lord
[39:41] said shall I hide from Abraham the thing
[39:43] which I do meaning that God can't keep
[39:46] nothing from you when you receive the
[39:48] baptism the Holy Spirit God can't keep
[39:50] nothing from you whether that's a
[39:52] spiritual blessing whether that's
[39:53] Revelation whether that's overflowing
[39:55] blessings God himself can't keep it from
[39:58] you right and so I like how it's a it's
[40:00] a spiritual overflow for Abraham here as
[40:03] God tells Abraham is plans right because
[40:06] he hasn't talked to anyone else and he's
[40:09] talking to Abraham because Abraham had a
[40:10] new status you know he could because he
[40:13] received the word he could receive the
[40:15] fullness of the word as God was laying
[40:17] out right and this gave and this what
[40:20] what it what this did because the the
[40:22] the key thing that we want to remember
[40:24] is that when you have a blessing as I
[40:26] said before you're always looking what
[40:28] for what you can do for other people the
[40:31] prophet said salvation is doing what is
[40:33] living for others that's what salvation
[40:36] is is when you live for others so when
[40:38] God told Abraham this great thing and
[40:40] he's having spiritual Revelation because
[40:42] he knows he's safe in his heart he's
[40:45] thinking about a
[40:46] lot in his heart he was thinking about a
[40:48] lot in his family when he heard these
[40:50] things right and I like how it says here
[40:54] in verse we're going to turn we're going
[40:56] to go down to uh uh verse 22 just one
[41:00] simple verse to kind of feed upon upon
[41:03] this for a little bit and in verse 22 it
[41:07] says and the men turned their faces from
[41:10] then and went toward Sodom so God was
[41:13] going to go down to handle deal with
[41:15] Sodom and it doesn't say anything about
[41:18] him thinking about lot
[41:20] so what I want to say is make sure you
[41:23] get the baptism the Holy Spirit don't
[41:25] depend on other people to be there to
[41:28] help you to save you and pray for you
[41:29] you make sure you get the baptism of the
[41:31] Holy Spirit yourself don't depend on
[41:33] your mom's experience or your dad's
[41:35] experience or anybody else that you know
[41:37] that is in Christ make sure you have a
[41:39] word for yourself right and so it says
[41:43] it went toward Sodom but Abraham stood
[41:46] yet before the Lord and I love that
[41:47] because it's a sign of intercession so
[41:50] now Abraham is in a position because he
[41:52] realizes who he is that he can talk with
[41:55] God and then we see how he kind of goes
[41:58] through and says Lord if there's any
[41:59] righteous in the city would you spare
[42:01] him God knows in his heart that he's
[42:03] talking about a lot and when you talk
[42:05] about uh when you talk about an overflow
[42:08] right for you to be able to hear from
[42:10] God that no I won't go down there and
[42:12] destroy the city for for 50 righteous or
[42:14] 30 righteous or 10 righteous so you can
[42:17] just see the Overflow that Abraham is
[42:19] getting because he's getting a son he's
[42:22] getting his Grand he's getting his
[42:24] nephew back yes he's restored back to
[42:27] the word he can talk face to face with
[42:29] God just like Adam did in the beginning
[42:32] this man is just old this man just has
[42:35] such an overflow going on in his
[42:40] life but we have to remember though that
[42:43] Abraham still had to stand right so when
[42:47] God gave him the word the Bible says
[42:50] Abraham waited 25 years for his promise
[42:53] God said he was going to receive God
[42:56] said he was going to receive the and
[42:57] Abraham really wanted a son him and his
[42:59] wife really wanted a away wanted a child
[43:01] and they had to wait 25 years and I say
[43:04] in this microwave age that we live in
[43:06] today a lot of us probably would have
[43:07] given up right a lot of us probably
[43:10] would have just forgot about it on year
[43:12] five or year 11 and just you know but
[43:15] the Bible says Abraham staggered not at
[43:17] the promise of God so we're going to
[43:19] read Jehovah Gyra and uh preached in 57
[43:24] and we're going to uh read paragraphs 24
[43:27] through
[43:29] 2 to see what the prophet said about
[43:31] this says now we find then a little
[43:34] later on as he began to move on and
[43:35] there come a separation time that he had
[43:38] to separate himself from his Kindred his
[43:40] father died as long as the old man was
[43:42] along he never did bless him but after
[43:44] all was separated God appeared to him
[43:47] lotad took his choice went down to Sodom
[43:50] as long as as long as lot hung along his
[43:52] argument and as long as you stick around
[43:54] with the unbelievers you'll find the
[43:56] same trouble and what God is saying is
[43:58] you have to separate yourself right you
[44:01] don't have to mingle with your loved
[44:04] ones that are not saved in order to
[44:06] redeem them you don't have to mingle
[44:08] with them you don't have to walk with
[44:10] them you don't have to uh do the things
[44:12] that they do you don't have to have the
[44:14] same conversations that that they have
[44:16] in order to save them right Abraham said
[44:19] hold on you going on a lot you you going
[44:21] down to Sodom and gomorra you can go on
[44:23] right there I'm going stay right here
[44:25] but he could still reach lot amen
[44:28] because he's stood on the word God right
[44:30] Hallelujah and if you have a wayward son
[44:32] or daughter or whoever I'm telling you
[44:35] now if you've had the baptism the Holy
[44:37] Spirit you can go Before the Throne of
[44:38] God and say Lord what about
[44:42] me God is a god of pattern which means
[44:46] if he did it for Abraham and he says no
[44:49] for to you it would mean that he
[44:52] wouldn't be God that's right so it means
[44:53] that he has to say yes in order to be
[44:56] the same amen amen as we continue
[44:59] reading but when Abraham was 90 99 years
[45:03] old 99 that made Sarah 88 could you can
[45:06] you imagine Abraham could you imagine
[45:08] when Abraham went and told Sarah's wife
[45:10] saying sweetheart you know we've always
[45:11] longed to have children oh yes Abraham
[45:14] well bless God we're going to have a
[45:15] baby watch Sarah say Abraham I don't
[45:17] understand neither do I well how do you
[45:19] know we're going to have a baby God said
[45:21] so that settles it God said so he's
[45:24] going to do it ver in paragraph 25 says
[45:27] well after the first few days maybe the
[45:29] first month while he come to Sarah and
[45:31] he said Sarah how you feeling honey he
[45:33] said not a bit of difference Abraham are
[45:35] you sure he said glory to God we're
[45:37] going to have it anyhow sure he says how
[45:39] do you know Abraham God said so the
[45:41] second month passed Sarah how you feel
[45:44] anything happening not a bit of
[45:46] difference glory to God we're going to
[45:47] have it anyhow how do you know God said
[45:49] so the first year past a lot of people
[45:52] would have given up not Abraham the
[45:55] first year past Sarah you still are you
[45:57] still are going to have those diapers
[45:58] and things ready yes have you felt any
[46:01] different not a bit but hallelujah we're
[46:02] going to have it anyhow God said so keep
[46:05] my thoughts on them they'll be all right
[46:07] see all right when 25 years pass 25
[46:09] years pass Sarah how do you feel no
[46:11] different glory to God we're going to
[46:13] have it anyhow there you are he didn't
[46:16] look at circumstances he looked at what
[46:18] God said he was looking at the word
[46:21] praise God Amen and so I kind of want to
[46:23] just get into this thing just to kind of
[46:25] flesh out these details because can you
[46:27] imagine Abraham and Sarah they're very
[46:30] old very very old people uh and God
[46:34] could have gave them a kid when they
[46:36] were fertile but he waited until the
[46:38] time where they were at a point where
[46:42] there looked like there was no hope and
[46:44] it's like why would you wait that
[46:48] long but you see we're in a testing time
[46:51] we're in a testing period and God's got
[46:53] to test our faith right and it's amazing
[46:56] how God told Abraham at this age where
[46:59] his whole physical nature was against
[47:01] him you know his his his feelings his
[47:04] sight his touch uh his reasoning and
[47:07] thinking everything was against him
[47:09] right so when you saw a when you saw the
[47:11] prophet saying Abraham was saying amen
[47:13] we're going to have it anyway that was
[47:14] the spirit man not the flesh man because
[47:17] the flesh man wants to give up and I I
[47:19] remember a time where uh I would uh when
[47:21] I was living with my grandpa you know I
[47:23] would try to teach him some new things
[47:25] and you know how when you're older you
[47:26] want to hear any of that kind of stuff
[47:28] you're just you're too you're too tired
[47:30] that time and I remember my my my
[47:32] grandpa used to say you can't teach a
[47:33] old dog new tricks all right so Abraham
[47:36] was at a stage where it was hard for him
[47:39] to even just think about things like
[47:41] that his whole nature whole body was was
[47:44] was against him and now let's look at
[47:46] Abraham's wife because that's just half
[47:48] of the equation right so in verse 11 uh
[47:51] going back to
[47:53] Genesis uh yeah verse 11 I'm going back
[47:57] to Genesis 18 it says now Abraham and
[48:00] Sarah were old and well stricken and
[48:02] aged and over here it says and it cease
[48:05] to be with Sarah after the manner of
[48:07] women and we got to kind of flesh out
[48:09] what that means after the the uh the
[48:12] manner of women so and and all you
[48:14] sisters correct me you know if if if I'm
[48:17] wrong because I've I've I've done my
[48:19] research and I don't want to be
[48:24] wrong so so I did my research and I
[48:28] found online that there are four stages
[48:31] that are associated with a woman as far
[48:33] as conceiving one is puberty and that's
[48:36] when she starts the menstruation age
[48:38] that's when she's able to uh start
[48:40] producing eggs which now a seed can go
[48:43] into egg and produce life and then she
[48:45] has a reproductive stage where she's
[48:48] able to have a have a have a child and
[48:51] then there's a stage called the per
[48:52] minipa stage which is the Prem minipa
[48:55] stage and then you have the Mena stage
[48:57] which is the sign after that is done
[48:59] it's a sign that a woman can no longer
[49:01] produce a child well she's no longer
[49:03] fertile anymore to produce a child right
[49:07] so this was the stage that Abraham's
[49:09] wife was in her own body was confessing
[49:12] to her you can't have a
[49:15] child so you could see how it was hard
[49:17] for Sarah to believe something because
[49:20] when you are fertile there are certain
[49:21] things that happen in a woman's life
[49:23] where you can feel that you know you are
[49:25] fertile and Sarah couldn't feel not one
[49:28] of these things wow Sarah couldn't feel
[49:32] any of it right so there's no evidence
[49:36] that life could come to her but they
[49:37] still still don't know word the and the
[49:39] the prophet says that um the prophet
[49:43] said that God had to provide them with a
[49:47] new body in order for the baby to come
[49:50] so as they're going through their life
[49:52] as they're going through life and
[49:53] believing on the word all of a sudden
[49:56] Abra wakes up one morning and you know
[49:58] how some older people you know they look
[50:00] got look real close and stuff Abraham
[50:02] was looking close to the paper like hold
[50:03] on a second I don't even need to squint
[50:05] to see this all right and looked over at
[50:08] Sarah and said whoa woke up and Sarah
[50:11] woke up and looked at Abraham and said
[50:13] oh my
[50:14] goodness
[50:18] Abraham that's something different going
[50:20] on here amen the Bible says that when
[50:23] they went before Abraham took his wife
[50:26] before King the the the Bible says and
[50:29] the the prophet tells us that the king
[50:31] desired to have her as a wife and he
[50:34] ain't going to have no old woman as a
[50:36] wife no Sarah was a young beautiful
[50:40] sister right so God had to change their
[50:43] bodies back in order for them to uh uh
[50:47] conceive Isaac and of course we know
[50:49] that after this time had come that Isaac
[50:51] finally was born right and they could
[50:54] enjoy their blessing right and you you
[50:56] would think that it would stop there you
[50:59] think that it would stop there all is
[51:00] over the story is over but no God wanted
[51:03] to give Abraham a overflow come on God
[51:06] wanted to give Abraham a overflow not
[51:09] just not just what he was dealing with
[51:11] now so Abraham had his promise right he
[51:16] had Isaac in his hands he woke up every
[51:18] morning and he heard Isaac and it just
[51:21] brought so much joy after he waited 25
[51:23] years and he waited so long and now the
[51:26] house was filled with a child's laughter
[51:28] and he went to the breakfast table and
[51:30] Isaac came running into the room and sat
[51:32] down jumping on his lap and Isaac had
[51:35] his son Isaac had his promise Isaac had
[51:38] his pride and his Joy right but there's
[51:42] just something about God he just loves
[51:44] to test every single bit of you right he
[51:49] just loves to test and and it's to let
[51:53] and and that's why I want to let you
[51:55] guys know you got to put it in your soul
[51:58] standing is a big part of the Christian
[52:01] experience you can't just enjoy life
[52:03] it's good to enjoy blessings but you got
[52:05] to learn to stand at all times so we're
[52:09] going to turn to Genesis
[52:16] 22 uh and verses we're going to read
[52:18] verses one and two and it says and it
[52:20] came to pass after these things that God
[52:23] did tempt Abraham and said unto him
[52:25] Abraham and he said behold here I am and
[52:28] he said take now thy son thy only son
[52:32] Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into
[52:35] the land of Moore and offer him there to
[52:37] for a burnt offering unto one of the
[52:39] mountains which I will tell of thee so
[52:42] now you can imagine how Abraham is at
[52:44] this point where he had just got his son
[52:48] and maybe and and the Bible says that
[52:50] that he could Isaac could talk at this
[52:52] time so he was probably you know nine or
[52:54] something he was at an age where he
[52:55] could communic and understand what his
[52:57] daddy understood what a sacrifice was
[53:00] and so he had been with Isaac for a long
[53:02] a lot of birthdays and so for him to
[53:04] hear these words that God said take your
[53:07] son I know that you love him and offer
[53:09] it to him right God now Abraham has at a
[53:12] time where it's a testing time and that
[53:14] it's a standing time for him to uh to
[53:16] stand on the word of the Lord right and
[53:18] so we're going to read verses
[53:21] 11
[53:24] and God has to set the scene God has
[53:28] Abraham has took his son up there he's
[53:30] prepared him onto the altar to sacrifice
[53:32] his son and he's going and he's choosing
[53:35] to believe the word of God and Trust in
[53:38] the word of God and we'll we'll we'll
[53:39] later find out why but it says here as
[53:42] he's about to it says we we'll start in
[53:44] verse 10 so verse 10 says and Abraham
[53:47] stretched forth his hand and took the
[53:48] knife to slay his son because he
[53:50] believed God he believed God Abraham
[53:54] believed God and you want sometimes you
[53:56] wonder why God makes you go through
[53:58] trials that are so hard or so long and
[54:00] you're sitting here well why I got to
[54:02] wait 25 years for a son there's always a
[54:05] harder trial after what you've gone
[54:07] through God's not just looking for what
[54:09] you're getting right now but God's
[54:11] looking for every single step of the way
[54:13] that you're going through and God has to
[54:14] prepare you to take a stand there so
[54:17] when Abraham was all them years of
[54:20] praising the Lord and thanking to God
[54:21] for them 25 years when it came to
[54:24] sacrifice his son there was no
[54:25] hesitation he had complete total control
[54:28] and belief in God because God had
[54:30] trained him to be that way right verse
[54:34] 11 says and the angel of the Lord called
[54:36] unto him out of heaven and said Abraham
[54:39] Abraham and he said here I am verse 12
[54:42] says and he said lay not thy hand upon
[54:43] the lad neither do thou anything unto
[54:46] him for now I know that thou fearest God
[54:49] seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy
[54:51] son thy only son from me and we're going
[54:55] to skip down to uh verse 15 and because
[54:58] Abraham had done this thing he had gone
[55:01] through this trial he had gone through
[55:02] this test and passed the test let's see
[55:05] what the uh what the Lord says to
[55:07] Abraham and and the angel of the Lord
[55:09] called into Abraham Out of Heaven the
[55:11] second time verse 16 and said by myself
[55:14] have I sworn save the Lord for because
[55:16] thou Hast done this thing and H has not
[55:18] withheld thy son thy only son that in
[55:22] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[55:24] multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[55:26] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[55:29] the sand which is upon the shore and thy
[55:32] seed shall possess the gates of his
[55:36] enemy talk about
[55:38] overflow is not only did God allow
[55:42] Abraham to keep his son but he was
[55:46] looking at a spiritual seat to
[55:48] Abraham he was looking at a spiritual
[55:50] Sons and Daughters of Abraham and I
[55:53] believe I'm looking at the I'm looking
[55:55] at the spiritual Abraham seeds right
[55:58] now talk about a overflow of sons and
[56:02] daughters for Abraham Through The Years
[56:05] you can read through the Bible and you
[56:06] can read David you can read Jesus you
[56:09] can read Moses and all of the Saints and
[56:12] those are all tied back to Abraham
[56:15] because he stood on the word amen right
[56:18] so it's and and that's what I'm saying
[56:20] Saints we're in a good spot how could we
[56:23] not believe in the Overflow of ourselves
[56:25] when we are the manifestation of one we
[56:29] are the walking manifestation of an
[56:32] overflow so how can we not believe in an
[56:34] overflow for ourselves how can God not
[56:36] give us a overflow when we are the
[56:39] definition of it by spiritual birth amen
[56:42] amen praise God and so we want to we
[56:45] want to finish off with um the last
[56:48] person because you because whenever you
[56:50] talk about overflow and blessing and
[56:52] over and overcoming standing you can't
[56:55] you you always got to you always have to
[56:57] talk about Jesus you always got to have
[56:59] talk about Jesus Christ right he is the
[57:01] one worthy of all the praise now how
[57:04] many knows that God himself was given an
[57:07] overflow wow how many knows that God
[57:10] himself knew that he was going to get a
[57:14] overflow right Jesus knew that he was
[57:17] going to rule and I can imagine as a uh
[57:20] Christ as a kid because when Christ was
[57:22] young he read the word right he had to
[57:25] read the word in order because when he
[57:27] was tempted he fought the enemy with the
[57:29] word so as a kid he read the word and if
[57:31] we could kind of
[57:32] dramatize what Christ read and the
[57:35] impact it had on his life right cuz it's
[57:37] one thing to read the word and to be
[57:40] able to identify yourself in it it's a
[57:43] good feeling right so if we turn to
[57:45] Psalms 2 Psalms 2 6-9
[57:57] it says here uh yeah 6 to9 so yet have I
[58:01] set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion I
[58:04] will declare the decree the Lord ha said
[58:06] unto me thou art my son this day have I
[58:09] begotten thee ask of me and I shall give
[58:11] Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance
[58:13] in the uttermost parts of the earth of
[58:15] thy possession Thou shalt break them
[58:17] with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them
[58:19] in pieces like a Potter's vessel and
[58:22] let's turn to uh Isaiah 6 uh 6 through 7
[58:27] I can read through it so that you don't
[58:28] have to turn
[58:29] through um it says then flew
[58:34] um hold on Isaiah wait no not Isaiah
[58:38] 6 hold
[58:40] on uh let's turn to actual Daniel Daniel
[58:53] 7-13 uh verse 13
[58:59] 13- 14 there we go and it says I saw in
[59:02] the night visions and behold one like
[59:04] the son of man came with the clouds of
[59:06] heaven and came to the Ancients of days
[59:08] and they brought him near before him and
[59:10] there was given him dominion and glory
[59:13] and a kingdom that all all people
[59:15] Nations and languages should serve him
[59:18] his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[59:20] which shall not pass away and his
[59:22] kingdom that which shall not be
[59:24] destroyed and if we could kind of draw
[59:26] Iz this young Jesus Christ when he read
[59:28] those verses it popped in his head
[59:30] that's
[59:32] me wow that's the the this scripture is
[59:36] talking about me and he could identify
[59:38] that hey I'm going to come to some power
[59:41] right I'm going to be you know I'm going
[59:43] to be Lord of All I'm going to have
[59:44] dominion of all my name is a I'mma have
[59:46] a kingdom that can't never uh uh be p uh
[59:49] be taken away but like with all children
[59:53] even with Christ God had to test them
[59:56] God's got to test them you ain't no
[59:59] different don't think that God's going
[1:00:00] to allow you to take a blessing or
[1:00:02] overflow without going through a stand
[1:00:04] if God didn't spare his own
[1:00:07] son trust me he's not going to have a
[1:00:09] different opinion about you that's all
[1:00:11] right brother right so Jesus Christ knew
[1:00:15] he was going to come into total power
[1:00:17] right and you're going to have to take a
[1:00:19] stand in order to get your overflow uh
[1:00:21] uh of your of uh of your blessing and
[1:00:23] the Bible said that the Bible says that
[1:00:26] Jesus Christ learned obedience through
[1:00:28] the things he suffered that's right so
[1:00:30] that was the first one God saw Jesus he
[1:00:33] obeyed his parents his parents said do
[1:00:35] this he went and did it his mom said do
[1:00:37] this he went and did this the elders
[1:00:38] said hey you do this he did this he was
[1:00:40] completely obedient and God was up in
[1:00:43] heaven like okay this guy he's looking
[1:00:45] like he's he's he's he's ready to rule
[1:00:47] right he's it's just the baby steps
[1:00:49] right it showed that he was fit to rule
[1:00:52] by his life it showed he was fit to uh
[1:00:54] he was fit to rule right and so how can
[1:00:57] you it's and and this is you know for
[1:00:59] the young ones uh you know how can you
[1:01:01] want a household how can you say you
[1:01:03] want a household right and you a young
[1:01:05] man and you want to be the head of your
[1:01:07] household and you can't listen to your
[1:01:10] parents you see it doesn't work out that
[1:01:12] way you know you'll go you'll go get
[1:01:15] your own household because you make your
[1:01:16] own choices but your kingdom will be in
[1:01:19] shambles your kingdom will be in
[1:01:21] shambles your family will be in shambles
[1:01:23] everything will be in shambles so when
[1:01:24] God gives you a Godly parent and he sees
[1:01:27] that you then can obey that then he's
[1:01:28] like okay now I can trust him with his
[1:01:30] own Kingdom right it's just patterns
[1:01:33] that you find and God deals with all of
[1:01:35] us the same right the Bible says he was
[1:01:38] also tempted if we turn to uh Matthew uh
[1:01:41] chapter um chapter
[1:01:51] 4 right he had to go through Temptations
[1:01:54] just like me and you go through ations
[1:01:56] in verses
[1:01:57] 8 and it says again the the devil taketh
[1:02:00] him up into an exceeding high mountain
[1:02:02] and show showeth him all the kingdoms of
[1:02:04] the world in the glory of them and said
[1:02:06] unto him all these things will I give
[1:02:09] thee if thou will fall down and worship
[1:02:11] me then Jesus said unto him get thee
[1:02:14] hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:02:17] Worship the Lord thy God and and him
[1:02:19] only shalt thy serve so Satan was trying
[1:02:22] to give him an increase but because he
[1:02:25] was the word he was be he was able to
[1:02:28] differentiate said n this ain't this
[1:02:30] ain't the right thing and you have to be
[1:02:33] able to differentiate that too as well
[1:02:36] you might get a good job but if they say
[1:02:38] you got to work on Sunday you got to
[1:02:39] have something inside that says like n
[1:02:41] this ain't no blessing you can keep that
[1:02:44] right you got to have something inside
[1:02:45] of you that you can stand the test of
[1:02:47] time and God always gives you more
[1:02:50] because the enemy was trying to
[1:02:51] shorthand him as we'll see later he
[1:02:54] wasn't just going to be given to the
[1:02:56] means of the Earth right he knew his
[1:02:59] position in the word and Hebrews uh the
[1:03:01] message Hebrews chapter 4 4 preached in
[1:03:05] 57
[1:03:07] um and it says paragraphs or we'll do
[1:03:10] paragraphs 110 I
[1:03:12] believe and the prophet said and Jesus
[1:03:15] went straight to the word and rebuked
[1:03:17] him talking about the enemy 11 11 says
[1:03:20] took him up on the mountain and showed
[1:03:21] him the United States and Germany and
[1:03:24] Switzerland and all the nations of the
[1:03:26] world that would ever be the prophet
[1:03:28] said he showed them all that was going
[1:03:30] to come and was trying to offer them
[1:03:32] said they're all mine I do with them
[1:03:34] whatever I want no wonder we got Wars
[1:03:36] and troubles said I do with them no
[1:03:39] wonder women dress and get by with it by
[1:03:41] the law they're all governed by the
[1:03:43] devil that's what the Bible says Satan
[1:03:44] said they're mine I do with them
[1:03:46] whatever I want said if you'll worship
[1:03:48] me I'll make you King like I am one
[1:03:52] verse 12 said Jesus said it's written
[1:03:55] thou sht Worship the Lord thy God only
[1:03:57] shalt thy serve get thee behind me Satan
[1:04:00] why Jesus knew that he would fall air to
[1:04:03] them in this great Millennium when his
[1:04:05] kingdom will come thy will be done on
[1:04:08] Earth as it is in heaven so Jesus knew
[1:04:11] he was already going to fall air so he
[1:04:13] didn't have to go a different way in
[1:04:15] order to get it and I'm telling you you
[1:04:17] don't have to go through Shortcuts To
[1:04:19] Get Your
[1:04:21] Blessing a lot of times people think
[1:04:23] they got to cut corners and I got to
[1:04:25] kind of you you know I got to accelerate
[1:04:27] this thing in order for me to get a
[1:04:29] blessing you don't got to do any of that
[1:04:31] all you got to do is just stand on the
[1:04:33] word God will bring the blessings to you
[1:04:36] so Christ knew he would come into power
[1:04:39] and we're closing in a minute so all
[1:04:41] through Christ life he was tested in
[1:04:43] order to prove that he was fit to rule
[1:04:46] when he stood on the
[1:04:47] mountain he showed that he wasn't
[1:04:50] willing to compromise with the word when
[1:04:52] he became a ruler the way he handled the
[1:04:55] sin he handled them with compassion well
[1:04:58] just like the lady that was uh found in
[1:05:00] adultery he handled it with compassion
[1:05:02] and God said that's someone that I could
[1:05:03] put in charge right he uh the way he
[1:05:06] handled the uh the the unbelievers and
[1:05:09] the make Believers when the Pharisees
[1:05:10] tried to come and trip them up with the
[1:05:12] word he knew just exactly what to say
[1:05:14] and God said this is someone that can
[1:05:16] lead and then the final test come on
[1:05:19] Calvary right
[1:05:21] and the foundation was set when the
[1:05:25] world recognized he was innocent the
[1:05:28] church recognized he was innocent and
[1:05:30] they still wanted to do away with him
[1:05:32] and God wanted to see what his reaction
[1:05:33] was going to be God wanted to see well
[1:05:35] how you going to react when people do
[1:05:37] you wrong and you know that you're
[1:05:39] innocent how are you going to respond to
[1:05:41] this God is looking for someone fit the
[1:05:44] rule God is looking for someone that
[1:05:46] knows how to give compassion God is
[1:05:48] looking for someone that can turn other
[1:05:49] cheek God is someone that can God is
[1:05:52] looking for someone that can show love
[1:05:54] even when they hate you guts right so he
[1:05:57] was putting him through a test um and
[1:06:00] I'm going to read out of the message
[1:06:02] living dying uh and buried
[1:06:06] um uh this paragraph
[1:06:09] 26
[1:06:10] um says
[1:06:12] here then as I said a few moments ago he
[1:06:15] become we become we were goats he became
[1:06:18] he became goat for us being he become
[1:06:20] sin for us that's the reason he had to
[1:06:22] be punished the way he was because all
[1:06:24] of our sins were plac upon him and there
[1:06:27] he had to Bear them away in his own body
[1:06:29] to Calvary a reproach or disgrace
[1:06:31] sinfully hanging there naked stripped
[1:06:34] bleeding bleeding when he rolled his
[1:06:37] precious head away the bloody locks
[1:06:38] dripping from his shoulders I believe it
[1:06:41] was Billy suay said there was an angel
[1:06:43] setting in every tree there that means
[1:06:45] he had a whole Army of people looking to
[1:06:46] help him out just saying just pull pull
[1:06:49] your hands loose from the cross and just
[1:06:51] motion your finger will change the scene
[1:06:55] he had the option the Jews paid him the
[1:06:58] greatest compliment could be paid not
[1:06:59] knowing what they were doing they they
[1:07:01] said he saved others himself he can't
[1:07:03] save sure not he he if he saved himself
[1:07:07] he could not save others but he gave
[1:07:09] himself that we might be saved that's
[1:07:12] the story so the reason why he went
[1:07:14] through he did the reason why show he
[1:07:16] was worthy the reason why God said this
[1:07:19] is the person that be could be in charge
[1:07:21] was he was thinking about me and
[1:07:23] you he was thinking about me and you he
[1:07:25] had had the option to just turn the
[1:07:27] scene around and just get rid of all of
[1:07:29] Rome and all of the Jews that were
[1:07:31] causing him all this pain because he was
[1:07:33] innocent right but he was thinking about
[1:07:35] me and you which was the final test like
[1:07:38] I said before you got to be careful
[1:07:40] between a blessing and an increase
[1:07:42] blessings always consider the word and
[1:07:45] think about other people right blessings
[1:07:48] always consider the word and think about
[1:07:50] uh uh other people and in closing when
[1:07:52] Jesus Christ died on the cross the
[1:07:55] Prophet says that he descended down into
[1:07:57] hell and the enemy that thought he got
[1:08:00] him but he lived the word so now he
[1:08:03] could fall air to this blessing or this
[1:08:06] overflow that God wanted to give him and
[1:08:08] so he walked right up to the enemy The
[1:08:10] Prophet says that he ripped the keys of
[1:08:13] death Hell In The Grave right and then
[1:08:15] he led the captivities so God kind of
[1:08:18] God had to come down and bring his hand
[1:08:20] down there because the Bible says he
[1:08:21] wouldn't suffer his holy one uh to stay
[1:08:23] in hell so God brought his hand down
[1:08:26] Jesus stepped into it he rose him above
[1:08:28] hell he said look at it he said all of
[1:08:30] it's yours all of the all of the Demons
[1:08:32] lying Spirits uh stealing Spirits uh
[1:08:36] homosexual Spirit God has dominion over
[1:08:39] all of them I'm telling you you come in
[1:08:41] contact with Christ if you try to fight
[1:08:43] your sin yourself you're going to
[1:08:45] fall they know you don't have dominion
[1:08:48] over them but when you put Christ into a
[1:08:51] Believer all sins stop New Management so
[1:08:55] God then took captivity he took them all
[1:08:57] the way up God Rose them up above the
[1:09:00] Earth and said look at the Earth and he
[1:09:02] saw all the kingdoms he saw the United
[1:09:04] States He Saw Germany he saw Rome he saw
[1:09:08] Brazil he saw Africa God said all of
[1:09:11] it's yours amen then he rose Christ up a
[1:09:14] little bit more into this uh sixth
[1:09:16] Dimension to drop the Saints off uh and
[1:09:20] you know you had Abraham cuz because
[1:09:22] they couldn't I believe that they
[1:09:23] brother Jack had preached that there was
[1:09:24] Paradise and they couldn't go into the
[1:09:27] they couldn't go into Heaven until the
[1:09:28] blood was shed so now now we're going up
[1:09:31] into the sixth Dimension and we know
[1:09:33] that through a vision brother brandham
[1:09:36] when God showed him the uh God he said
[1:09:38] he wanted to see God took him up to the
[1:09:40] sixth Dimension and he saw all of the
[1:09:42] Saints there right and he said yeah I
[1:09:44] see my my my my wife is here my kid is
[1:09:47] here all of the saints were sitting
[1:09:48] there but he asked a question though he
[1:09:51] said where's Jesus yeah so on that day
[1:09:54] when Christ was God was raising him up
[1:09:56] and he came up to the sixth Dimension he
[1:09:58] dropped all the saints off of the sixth
[1:09:59] Dimension said all right Christ everyone
[1:10:02] off okay he rose God up even higher than
[1:10:06] all of the other Saints and placed him
[1:10:09] on the throne talk about an overflow
[1:10:11] talk about a overflow of of dominion and
[1:10:15] power right and I want you to know that
[1:10:17] there's something special about this
[1:10:19] realm that Jesus is in because when
[1:10:22] you're in the sixth realm if you look to
[1:10:23] the right you'll see Saints you look to
[1:10:26] the left you'll see Saints but in the
[1:10:28] seventh Dimension where Jesus is at he
[1:10:30] looks to his right there's nobody he
[1:10:32] looked to his left there's nobody to
[1:10:35] signify there was no one equal right he
[1:10:38] was in a realm and a place all on his
[1:10:40] own he looked below his feet he saw time
[1:10:43] time is a dimension he saw the radio
[1:10:45] waves that's a dimension he saw the
[1:10:47] Earth where we're living in that's a
[1:10:49] dimension he saw hell he saw the spirits
[1:10:51] that's the dimension he saw all the
[1:10:52] saints below him to show he had Di
[1:10:56] overall and then he tried to lift his
[1:10:58] head up there's something special about
[1:11:00] this seventh realm he tried to lift his
[1:11:01] head up and he couldn't do it he
[1:11:03] couldn't do it because there was no one
[1:11:06] greater in all the other dimensions you
[1:11:08] can lift your head up and and see things
[1:11:10] but when Christ tried to lift his head
[1:11:11] up it it must have came to his heart
[1:11:14] whatever you're thinking that is so
[1:11:16] whatever you say it'll come to pass
[1:11:18] however you feel about a situation it
[1:11:20] will have to happen there is no debate
[1:11:23] there's no one greater that Christ has
[1:11:25] to look up to and we have to kind of end
[1:11:28] this uh and I'm going to give a quote
[1:11:30] because the thing about a blessing is
[1:11:31] the thing that I love about a blessing
[1:11:33] is that it always looks at others
[1:11:36] blessings always look at others and
[1:11:38] we're going to read out of the message
[1:11:40] what was the Holy Ghost given for and
[1:11:43] preached in 59 and it's paragraph 20 and
[1:11:46] God Jesus Christ have been given all
[1:11:48] this power and his dominion and
[1:11:51] everything and we're going to see how he
[1:11:53] we're going to see what he what he did
[1:11:55] with with it and I'll just start reading
[1:11:56] it says now we know what the holy spirit
[1:11:58] is we found out last night that it's God
[1:12:02] now when we think of God the father as
[1:12:04] Jesus spoke here his father God the son
[1:12:06] as Jesus God the Holy Spirit as what we
[1:12:08] call it today now that does not mean
[1:12:10] that there is three individual distinct
[1:12:11] Gods it means there is one God and three
[1:12:14] offices may we say it like this all that
[1:12:18] God was he poured into Christ so all the
[1:12:21] power Dominion all of that God when when
[1:12:24] Christ came on Earth and he conquered
[1:12:26] all and he had dominion over all right
[1:12:28] God poured himself in Christ he was God
[1:12:31] because he emptied himself and poured it
[1:12:33] into Christ which was why he was able to
[1:12:35] overcome and and then did Christ just
[1:12:38] keep it to himself
[1:12:39] though when you have a blessing man you
[1:12:42] always got to share it with
[1:12:44] others that's that's a sign that you
[1:12:47] really been blessed is when you're
[1:12:48] thinking about other people right and it
[1:12:51] says here and C it says here he emptied
[1:12:54] himself and poured it into Christ and
[1:12:56] Christ was the fullness of the godhead
[1:12:58] bodily all that Jehovah was he poured it
[1:13:00] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[1:13:03] poured into the church right into you
[1:13:08] all Dominion is not it it all Dominion
[1:13:10] is in you right your word means
[1:13:13] something you can take a stand you can
[1:13:15] speak the word you can receive a
[1:13:17] overflow you have power over all Spirits
[1:13:20] you have power over all the Earth you
[1:13:22] have power over all time right it says
[1:13:26] not until just one individual God don't
[1:13:28] have favorites when anyone goes through
[1:13:31] when when you're when you're going to go
[1:13:32] through a overflow God don't got any
[1:13:34] favorites he'll test every single one
[1:13:36] the same but into the entire body there
[1:13:39] we come together in unity we have power
[1:13:42] all that was in all that God was was in
[1:13:45] Christ and all that Christ was is in you
[1:13:50] amen let us pray
[1:13:55] Lord Jesus Christ we've fellowshipped
[1:13:58] around your word oh Lord God God you oh

[1:14:44] Christ and Lord you could have just
[1:14:46] spoke the word oh Lord God but it says
[1:14:48] that you wept too oh Lord God to signify
[1:14:51] that you understand what we're going
[1:14:54] through oh Lord Jesus Jesus Christ and
[1:14:55] that we're not alone oh Lord Jesus
