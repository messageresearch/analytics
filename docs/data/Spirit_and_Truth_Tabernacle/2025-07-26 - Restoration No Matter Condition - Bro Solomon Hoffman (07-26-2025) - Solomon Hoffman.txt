Hallelujah. Lord, &gt;&gt; such grace you have extended. &gt;&gt; Such grace. Such grace. Such grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, such grace you have extended to me. Praise the Lord. I thank God for mama. Amen. Amen. Amen. We're so happy uh to be back fellowship on this morning and uh again so happy that many of you all come from far and from here to be a part of I will restore saying the Lord meetings. Amen. As we mentioned, it's been a while since we've been doing meetings in July. Uh but we just had in our heart that we wanted to get this going again. Uh Brother Wesco was the one that got these things started and u u we will never forget some of the times that we've had. Uh and we trust that this weekend will also be a weekend that God would just cause us to uh be maintained in our memories. This morning we have um a minister coming and I want to just make mention uh that the ministers that were uh selected to preach during these services have been ministers that have blessed Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Praise the Lord. Amen. And through prayer and uh just much discussion even with my deacons uh we wanted to um bring ministry in that not only would be a blessing to spirit and truth tabernacle but those that would gather uh with us. We believe that these ministers will be a blessing to you as well. As I mentioned last night, God made you a promise. And his promise was that you will eat in plenty and you will be satisfied. Praise God. Uh this morning we have a precious brother coming to us from uh North Carolina. Uh some of you are familiar with him, others may not be familiar with him. And um just tap on the door to make sure is ready to come. Um, others may not, but nonetheless, if you don't know him, you will know him after this service is over. You will you will you'll know him after the service is over. So, uh, but brother Solomon Hoffman, amen, will be coming to us, uh, this morning to minister. And, uh, I know the Lord has given him a word, uh, just for you. Please don't just look at him, but enter in and uh pull on the word of God. I I heard it said, "If you pull, I preach." [Music] And I believe you pull on Brother Solomon, um the Lord will use him to preach to your needs. Amen. On this morning, praise the Lord. Let's just uh prepare. Amen. To bring him to bring him on. [Music] If you stand to your feet, [Music] amazing grace, how sweet the sound, oh that say a rich like me. Oh, I once was. Oh, but now now I'm found. Oh, was blind, but now [Music] Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. Would that save a rich like me? [Music] I once was lost. Oh, but now I'm found. And I was blind. But now I see. Amen. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that this morning? Amen. That's a song the angels know nothing about. I tell you, ain't that powerful to realize that we can literally do something that angels can't even do? You've got to praise that the angels have to sit down and listen to you praise God and listen to you worship. My I tell you, you know what a what a revelation it is to know the grace of God. Amen. You love the Lord this morning and you're looking forward to what God has in store for you. Amen. I tell you, the prophet taught us very clearly. He said, "You always get what you expect." And uh I was just reading this quotation there in the back, but brother Ram says here in expectations. He said, "If you come expecting to criticize the meeting," he said, "the devil will show you something every single time." So I'll go ahead and tell you, you can look right here if you want to find something to criticize. You don't have to look far at all to find something. But the prophet said, he said, "But if you come and you're expecting for God to speak to you, you're expecting for God to heal you, you're expecting to be restored, whatever it is," he said, "you'll get what you expect." I don't know about you, but I'm expecting a refilling, a refreshing, a renewing of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And and we'll get exactly what we expect. And so, uh, we just want to humble our spirits this morning and go to the Lord in a word of prayer. And if you have a need upon your heart, just slip your hand up to the Lord and say, "Lord, come by my way and speak to me." I tell you, there's not a place too low that his hand can't reach. Amen. There's not a problem too great that our God can't solve. Amen. God's still in the moving business. Let's just approach him now. Lord, what an honor it is to be in the presence of not just a king, but Lord, to be here in the presence of the King of Kings, Lord. And you said in your word that if we would come and we would knock on the door, it would be open to us. So Lord, we're knocking this morning. We're knocking for a refilling of the Holy Ghost. We're knocking on the door for healing in our bodies, Lord. We're knocking on the door for salvation, Lord, for restoration, for whatever the need is. You said if we knock that it would be opened unto us, Lord. And we believe your word this morning, Lord. We just come into this place with praise and thanksgiving upon our lips, Lord. We want to just worship you for a moment, Lord, and thank you for the grace and the mercy that you've showed to us, Lord. You're the King of Kings. You're the God of gods. You're the Lord of Lords. You're the You're the God who's mighty in battle. And your name is Jesus, the name that's above every name. And we worship that great name this morning. We pray that you'll just have total control in these meetings. Lord, we pray that you have preeminence. Lord, I pray that you just anoint speaker and hearer alike. I pray that you would be high and lifted up and your glory would fill this place this morning, Lord. Lord, we just give ourselves to you. We give this meeting to you. We pray in the most matchless name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." That means so be it. Amen. May God bless you this morning. We just want to get straight into the word. And uh I'll invite you into your scriptures in Malachi the 4th chapter and also in Joel the 2 chapter and one place in Acts the 2 chapter. As you're turning there, we just greet you this morning the name of the Lord and certainly counting the great honor and privilege to be here speaking to you. And uh we just want to put our shoulder to the wheel. Amen. And try to be a blessing and a help to the children of God. And uh we're just looking forward to what God has in store for us. And I believe the scripture says I has not seen and ear has not heard the things that God has in store for us. And uh we just want to appreciate brother Jack and the invitation to come. It's a great honor uh to be a part of these meetings and I've just known Brother Jack for several years now and I count him to be a dear friend and have great respects for him and the church here in this uh in this area in Florida. And I believe you're a lighthouse to the message of the hour. And I tell you, we should never let that fire burn out. We should never let it get dim, but we should hold up the the the banner of the message of the hour. And I believe that church does this and we just appreciate all the work and we just had our annual meetings there at our church. Uh where Josh Bennett's our pastor in Newton, North Carolina and uh so we know that a lot of work goes into a meeting, but I tell you as they were singing last night, your labor is not in vain. And uh we're just trusting the Lord that there'll be eternal fruit come forth out of this meeting. And so, uh, may God just bless you this morning, and we won't prolong the time, but let's read here in Malachi the 4th chapter and the first verse. The Bible says this, "For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayaeth the Lord of hosts, and then it shall leave neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall, and ye shall tread down the wicked. I just love prophecy, don't you? And you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this, sayaeth the Lord of hosts. If you ever need a scripture to remind the devil of and when you're in the middle of a battle, just read that scripture to the devil and remind him that he will be ashes underneath your feet. Amen. I'm sorry, but I just believe the word and I believe exactly what it says is exactly what'll happen. And remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him, and for all Israel with the statures and judgments. And behold, I will send you. Elijah the prophet. Now notice that scripture. I will send who? I will send you. So we can talk about Elijah, but we need to talk about who's the you part. I believe you is you. I'll send unto you. Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. And Joel 2 and 25, let's read this scripture as well. The Bible says, as brother Jack was reading last night, uh these things have just been on my heart for the past month or two, but uh nevertheless, we just want to speak what God's led us to. Uh the Bible says, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerorm, and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. And ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else." and my people shall never be ashamed. In Acts 2 and one, and when the day of Pentecost was fully came or fully come, they were all in one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and a filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. If you'll skip down to the 14th verse. But Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words, for these are not drunken as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. Amen. We just ask God would bless his word as you can be seated this morning. And by the help and grace of God, I want to take a subject from this and speak to you on restoration. no matter condition. Amen. Restoration no matter condition. As brother Jack was saying last night, I thought it was very fitting with the things I was studying. But he kept on repeating it was God that made the promise that you shall eat in plenty. And we know it was God that made the promise that he would restore everything to us. So let me ask you a question as we start. Is anything too hard for God? &gt;&gt; And is anybody able to stop God? Amen. There's not a power too great. There's not any devil in hell that is going to be able to stop God from doing what he said he's going to do. So if God said, "I'll restore to you everything that you lost," it's not up to you to figure out. It's not up to you to question. It's not up to you to think about. It's just up to you to lift your hand and say amen to the word. Amen. That's the problem. We want to figure this out. How? How? When? Where? How? When? Amen. God don't want you to do that. God just wants you to say, "Amen. Be it unto me according to thy word." And I believe if we would have that attitude with all of the word of God, it would solve a lot of debates. It would solve a lot of problems. It would solve a lot of arguing. Instead of debating what the Bible said, why don't you just say amen to what the Bible said? Instead of wanting to debate what the message of the hour has brought us, why don't we just say amen to what the message has said? Amen. and we'll get the results that God has promised in his word. Now, I believe we're living in a time that all things has been restored. How many believes that in this place? &gt;&gt; We're living in a time that everything has been restored. I believe that the faith which was once delivered to the saints, that faith has been restored back to the church of the living God. I believe that the fullness of the Holy Ghost has been restored also back to the church of the living God. See the prophet said the Holy Ghost was bound at the doors of creeds and denominations. He said the Holy Ghost was bound at the church door. But the prophet said in this evening time, Amen. He is no longer bound at the door, but he is inside the door and he's doing what he did again in Acts the 2 chapter. Amen. Now listen, you can bind the Holy Spirit in your life if you want to. Amen. But as for me in my house, I welcome the Holy Spirit into this door. And I believe that the fullness of the Holy Spirit has been released in the end time. I believe we've been restored back to the original Holy Ghost of the Bible. I believe that the scriptural balance of all things has been restored. Amen. The church was far out on left field and emotionalism. And the church was far out in the right field. And all we all we need is the word and no spirit. But this message came to restore us to the middle of the road where it's not just emotionalism and Pentecostalism, but it's the word and it's the spirit. It's spirit and it's true tabernacle. Amen. And we're restored back to the word of almighty God. Amen. I pity people that say we don't need the spirit. You may not need it, but I sure need the Holy Spirit. Well, preacher, we're deeper than that. Well, in Acts the 2 chapter, they wasn't too deep for the Holy Ghost. They wasn't too deep for the word of God. So, you're telling me you got deeper than they got in Acts the 2 chapter? That you don't need the spirit. As for me, I want the spirit and I want the word because the Bible says the word without the spirit, it is dead and it kills. Amen. But with the spirit, there is life and life above. Amen. That's the reason you can't make the word live in your life is because you don't have the dynamics of the Holy Spirit. But the prophet said that dynamics of the church would be the refilling of the Holy Spirit. And the prophet said it will put the church in a state of action. Hey, we're not a dead church. Amen. We're a church that is alive this morning. Amen. And well with the dynamics of the Holy Ghost. See, we've been restored back to the spirit of the Almighty. And that spirit is in our midst. See, I believe this message restored us back to the middle of the road. And we are not Pentecostal by denomination. We are not Pentecostal by emotion, but the prophet said, "We are Pentecostal by experience." Now, I know people are scared of the word Pentecost. I'm not ashamed of the word Pentecost because the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come, it was all in one place and one mind and one accord and that's when the Holy Ghost fell. Amen. I'm not ashamed to be identified with the same Holy Ghost that fell in the upper room in Acts the 2 chapter. Amen. The Bible says that I will restore. Amen. And my people shall eat in plenty and they shall never be ashamed. Amen. Don't you ever be ashamed of the gift of the Holy Ghost. Don't you ever be ashamed of what God has done in this hour. Don't you ever be ashamed of the message of the hour. Let me tell you, if God himself was not ashamed to have his picture taken with the prophet of God, then why on earth would I be ashamed to be identified with the end time Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Revelation 10:7 follower. Amen. I am not ashamed with what God has done in this generation. Amen. I'm a believer of what God has done in this generation. And because I believe I've been restored back to the original faith. I tell you what it did. Amen. It restored the shout to the church. It restored the victory to the church. It restored divine healing to the church. It restored all of the word and put it in its rightful place. That's exactly right. And I believe that it restored us to our pattern which was Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Ephesians church age and the church age book says it this way. He said what the church was at Pentecost is the standard. Let me remind you standards don't change with time. Standards are standards. Listen. Amen. This message is not out of date. In fact, I believe it's more up to date now. Amen. Than it I hope that's okay. I believe it's more up to-date now prophetically even than it was 60 years ago. And you say, "Well, well, you know, Brother Random, he just had this way about him or this way about him." You're just looking for an excuse to not believe what a prophet taught. Amen. But listen, I believe what truth was 60 years ago is still true today. Amen. And I won't stop preaching it till the day I die. Amen. Truth don't change. Amen. Because preachers change. Truth don't change. Amen. Because time change. Amen. The word is still an upto-date word. And and I just I just am a simple believer and I believe what the prophet taught and I believe that truth does not ever change. If it was truth back then, it is truth today. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, he said, "Art, nothing has changed." He said, "No matter what the scholars say, we've heard a lot of what the scholars have to say." He said, "God has not changed the pattern." What God did at Pentecost, I just love this. what God did at Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until the church age is close. And brother Bam said, he said, see those scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over. The prophet said, don't you believe it? Amen. The scholars will tell you the apostolic age is over. Don't you believe it. And so I believe that the apostolic age is still continuing. Amen. In the book of Acts, it did not end with a period. It ended with a comma. Amen. to tell you that the acts of the Holy Spirit is not done. Amen. And I believe we have been turned back to the same faith that they had in Acts the 2 chapter. I believe the bride of Christ has been restored back to that same faith. In Jude 1 and3, the Bible says this, "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend." Contend means to fight. It means to wrestle. You should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints. Amen. I tell you friends, I want the same faith they had back then. I I don't want a different faith. I want the same faith that they was uh that the Bible says to earnestly contend for. And you know, people say, "Well, well, those days are over and the revival is over and the power of the Holy Spirit is over." I ask you to tell me where the Bible ever said that and tell me where the prophet ever said that revival was over for the bride. He never said it. He said, "Out in this world, there is no more sweeping revivals. There is no more revival in the church world. But to the bride of Jesus Christ," Amen. Our revival is not over. Our revival is still going on now. Amen. You all remember when the prophet said, "There's been nothing to wake her bride as of yet. It will take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up." And then you find the prophet declaring, amen, in 1963, amen, that the opening of the word has taken place and the bride is now awoken by the word. Amen. She Listen, friends, we're not here asleeping church. We are here, Amen, alive and revived by the power of the spoken word. Amen. You can be a dead church if you want to. Amen. But I refuse, Amen, to be, Amen, dead underneath the message God has given me. I I simply denounce that. And people say, "Well, you know, those days they're just not here no more and the Holy Spirit don't move no more and and God don't move in the midst of his people like that no more." And I like to tell them people, you got to reward that. He don't do that no more. As far as you know, because as for me, I'm getting a refilling of the Holy Ghost all the time. I'm getting my cup running over all the time. Amen. I can get it today and get it tomorrow and get it the next day. Amen. for the bride of Christ. These days are not over, but these days are right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what it is. It's easier for people to say those days are gone by and God don't do that no more instead of believing that they can manifest a word for their age. It's easier just to say, "God, don't do that no more." Because then it takes all the pressure away and they can just do what they want and live like they want. It's easier to say that was just for the prophet. That was just for William Brandham. He was the only one that can speak the word. He was the only one that could operate the power of the third pole. It's easier for people to say that was only for him instead of realizing that is a bride scripture and that is a bride ministry. Amen. Listen, God was not just showing you what could happen in one man's life. He was showing you what could happen in your life when you'll surrender to the same Holy Ghost that that prophet was surrendered to. You will see the same God work through you like he did him. Now, now I'm not saying you're going to have the same ministry that was one to a generation. But I am saying the same God that was with that prophet is the same God that is with the bride. I ask you, where is the Lord God of Elijah? He is right here in the midst of his church. Amen. He did not die when the prophet died. Amen. The power did not die when the prophet died, but it's right here in our midst today. We have been restored back to it. Amen. You've got to understand though. Amen. See, we're not looking back constantly. And and the prophet warned about looking back. You can look back to the good old days. And this was the good old day. And that was the good old day. And brother Random warned you and I. He said, "Don't keep looking back or you're going to wreck." So, we don't keep our eyes on what used to be, but we keep our eyes what's on front of us. And that's the reason you're missing what God is doing right in front of you because you're looking back to what Amen. spirit and truth used to be. And you're turning the back of the good old days. And you're looking back and looking back and you forget that right now in your midst that God wants to bless you more than you've ever been blessed. God wants to move in your church more than he's ever moved. But he can't do it because you're not looking for it. But the prophet said, "God will always come to those who are looking for him." Hey, it was the three magi. Amen. That looked to the stars and it led them to where Messiah was. And I fixed my eyes to another star. Amen. The seventh star. And it's led me to where Christ is. Hey, the reason we couldn't see him is because we was looking in the church and we was looking in the ministry. But the prophet said, "Amen, to look to the word, that is where Christ is." &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen. We've been turned back to the original faith. And I tell you, I I just believe what the prophet taught. Don't you? Amen. We're not constantly looking back. And if the prophet said that Pentecost was the standard, I say it was the standard. If the prophet said the bride of Christ will be a continuation of the book of Acts, I say the bride of Christ is a continuation of the book of Acts. If the prophet says she can do the greater works, I say she can do the greater works. If the prophet taught us according to the word, if the vine ever puts forth another branch, they'll write another book of acts behind her and it'll be life of his life. It'll be spirit of his spirit. Then I say, Amen. The vine has put forth another branch and she will be life of his life and spirit of his spirit and she will be him. &gt;&gt; Amen. If the prophet said, Amen, that you could do the greater works and that is a right now scripture and that's for you and not for a different person, then I say that word is for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think it's time we just believe what the prophet said. Don't you? Amen. And you'll come to understand it's not the thoughts of William Brandom. was God speaking to you and I. Amen. If you just listen to it as another man or a preacher, that's all you'll get out of it. But if you listen to it as God, this is your voice to this generation and it is the voice of God to me. Then you'll hear it completely different. And you'll no longer hear it as as this is for somebody else or or this is just another man preaching, but it's God speaking to his bride. Amen. See, I believe the problem is when we start saying what we think instead of what the prophet said. We start teaching what we think about the quotes instead of just preaching what's on the quotes. We start preaching about what what I think this wings and what this means and what that mean. It's time we just get back to the old stomping ground. Amen. Why can't we just say what the prophet said? Amen. Why do we got to tiptoe and be careful and worry about it? Used to be we could just preach this message. Amen. and folks believed it. But now we got to argue and fight and what do you mean here and what do you mean there? But you're looking at a man that has been restored underneath this end time message. And I am not ashamed for I met the God of William Brandon and he's my God and he's your God and he's our God here today. I think it's time we get back to the word and let's teach what that prophet said. You say, "I I don't know about that." You got to give me a scripture. Look at Moses in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I can't talk, God. I can't talk." That's all right. I will give you the words and Aaron will be your prophet and you'll be like God and you tell him what to say and he'll put and he'll preach the word. In other words, as long as Aaron, glory to God, as long as Aaron said what Moses said, Amen. the God that made the promise to Moses would honor the words of Aaron. I think it's time of Aaron raise up. Amen. And say what Moses has said. And God will back up the words of the bride. Hallelujah. He'll back up the words of the bride if we'll say what Moses has said. Amen. God will honor the word just the same. &gt;&gt; People wonder what the secret is. I just say what the prophet said and God backs it up. People wonder where the power is. I just teach what the prophet taught. I hope that's okay. I just got to preach my convictions. I don't mean to stomp on nobody or offend nobody. I just got to preach what God's put on my heart. Amen. If we don't play around with these things, we might get somewhere with God. Amen. Just say what he said. He said, "Say what's on them tapes." So, I say, "Say what's on them tapes." &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay. God bless you. If you don't agree, that's fine. Amen. I believe we're living in a wonderful time concerning the word. I I believe that we've had the full restoration of all the truths of the Bible. Water baptism, serpent seed, the power of the Holy Ghost, true revival. I believe all of these things have been restored and has come through the message of the air. And I want you to understand this message was not about William Brandom. This message was all about Christ the word. And it was about revealing Christ. The prophet did not come to point you to him. He come to point you to Christ the word. And I'm not lifting up William Brandham. I'm lifting up the God that he lifted up. Amen. Listen, brother Bam said himself, he said, "I didn't come to point you to me or to start an organization or to start another movement, but I want to see one thing accomplished, and that's a true relationship back with man and with God." &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well," and people come along and say, "Well, you know, I don't think we need a prophet to restore us back to the correct teaching of the Bible." Well, look at what people have done with the Bible. Amen. I was just studying last night and they say there's an estimated 45,000 denominations of Christianity. And you say you don't need a prophet. Look at the world. They've got the same Bible you and I got. And they've somehow come up with 45,000 different ideas of what the Bible says. Listen, there's got to be a final say concerning these things. There's got to be a truth of it. Amen. Surely they ain't 45,000 different truths of the Bible. Amen. There's got to be one truth. And let me tell you, I've got the answer this morning. Amen. There is one truth. Amen. It is the divine interpretation with divine vindication of the word of almighty God. If you want the truth, get in this message. If you want to know what the Bible says, Amen. Open the Bible and hear what the prophet taught about it. &gt;&gt; I don't need a prophet. and I don't need. Well, the Bible says you do. &gt;&gt; I won't do anything unless I reveal it to my servants to prophets. Children of Israel said, "Don't let God speak to us less we die." God said, "Okay, I won't talk to him like this anymore. I'll send the prophet." So, according to the scripture, God speaks to us through his prophets. And I believe it's time that we we receive that and we open our arms to it. If we'd stop trying to figure it all out and just say amen to the word. Amen. Listen, there has been a final voice in this age. It's a final authority. Amen. There's no more probing about the Bible. There's no more questions about the Bible. Amen. But we now have the truth of it. Amen. And see, we we all know that. Amen. The prophet said, "See, we've had the Bible for thousands of years now." And they probed at it and they guessed at it. I'm so glad to know this morning, I'm no longer probing in the Bible trying to figure it out, trying to see this. But I can say without any shadow of a doubt, this is what the Bible says and this is the truth of the word. Amen. The prophet said here in the breach, he said, "See Malachi 4, there's one supposed to come like unto Elijah whom the word of the Lord comes to and he's to reveal by the Holy Spirit all the mysteries of God and restore the faith back to the children where I turn their hearts back to the faith of the apostolic fathers." He said, "What is it?" has restored back all these mysteries that's been probed that by denominations and through all these years. He said the word is here to bring us back. I'm so glad this morning we're no longer probing and guessing and wondering is this right? Is this wrong? Is this right? If you're still doing that, brother, I have pity on you. We're no longer guessing. Is this right in the word? Is that wrong? Is this right? Amen. Listen, if you want to know the truth, hear what that prophet said. Amen. I'm not guessing. Is it okay to do this? Is it right to do this? Is it wrong to do this? Amen. If it was wrong 60 years ago, as I said before, it is wrong today. Amen. It's time we just get back to the word. And the prophet's clear. He said, "This ministry will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers." What is that faith? It's the faith. It's not the Baptist faith, the Methodist faith, the Pentecostal faith. I think it's something you never heard any of them names in the Bible. Well, you never heard Baptist or Pentecostal or Methodist. Amen. The prophet said them are not biblical names. They are blasphemous names. Is that okay? Amen. They're blasphemous names that are away from Christ. But see, we've not been pointed to those faiths. We've been pointing to the faith. And this message came to restore us to the original faith. And I just love what brother Random says here in restoration of the bride. He said to restore, it means to bring back. Now, it's not to purchase, it means to bring back. to restore. The prophet said, he said, "A claim can be enforced. When you're restoring something, you're bringing it back to its rightful owner where it belongs." So when God restores the individual, it is not God paying for your salvation. It is not God saving you all over again. It is God restoring you back to what he called you to be. Amen. Restoration is different, amen, from God saving you and God giving to you the Holy Ghost. Restoration is bringing you back from where you fell from. Amen. And that's what we need, brother, is to be restored back. How many remembers David in the Psalms? He said, "Lord, restore unto me the joy of my salvation." Amen. He never lost his salvation. Amen. But he lost the joy in coming to church. He lost the fun, if you'll give me some grace. He lost the fun in worshiping God. And he lost the joy in worshiping God. And he said, "Lord, restore unto me the joy of my salvation." Amen. I pity the people that they worship God. And I tell you, you know, it's a gloomy thing. And oh Lord, praise God. No joy and no victory and no joy. Amen. Listen, brother, sister. Amen. They came to Jesus and said, "Jesus, tell them folks to quieten down there. Tell them folks to stop their worship." He said, "If they don't worship the son of David, if they don't worship me and lift me on high and them rocks over there will cry out, I say, Lord, restore to the church." Amen. The joy of their salvation and the victory of their salvation. Hey, I tell you, there ought to be joy in the house of God. Amen. Used to be it wasn't normal to sit there and be all gloomy and depressed and our arms is folded and we're dead and we're Amen. used to be that wasn't a normal thing. Amen. To come into a church and think it was a funeral service. Amen. But somehow we get in our mind that that's normal. That is not normal according to the word of God. I tell you what's normal. Amen. Shout aloud, daughters of Zion, and lift up your voice as of that of a trumpet. You want something normal? Amen. Worship in the house of God. It ought to be a everyday thing. That's what I've been brought back to. It ain't emotionalism. It ain't working people up. I tell you what it is. We are worked up, but it's by the word. How many of y'all hear music pumping right now? There ain't a lick of it. What's the bride stimulated by? She is stimulated by the word of almighty God. Let me tell you something. Amen. This word will lift you up when you're as down as down can be. His word's got the power, amen, to lift you up out of the condition you're in. Hallelujah to God. His word has got a power, amen, to lift you back and restore you back to your feet. And that's what David said. David knew he wasn't lost, but he lost the joy of serving God. I ain't telling you you're lost, but I tell you, you ought to have joy in serving God. Amen. Used to be, brother, sister, we were so happy to come to church. I just can't wait. And the Bible said if you've got the Holy Ghost, uh oh, if you've got the Holy Ghost, you can't wait for them church doors to get open. &gt;&gt; I don't you know that wasn't inspired by the Psalm. And you that was before 1963. I'm sorry. Amen. But I believe what the prophet said. If you got the Holy Ghost, you can't wait. See, it's because my heart's been turned back. And I ain't here because of you. And I ain't here because of him. But I'm here because of him. Amen. And I didn't come to see you. And I didn't come to see him. But I came to see him. And that's the problem. If you're coming here just to be seen, and you ought to stay home. If you was coming here, Amen, just to see what would happen and you ought to just stayed home. But if you was coming here, amen, to see the God of this Bible, I say, God bless your soul. Amen. Blessed are you that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; That's the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Restore us back. Bring us back to our rightful owner. See, I tell you what it was. That we was in the devil's pawn shop, but we was not his. &gt;&gt; We was in the devil's pawn shop, and he had a pawn tag on you and I, but we never belonged to the devil in the first place. Can I say it this way? You was always a daughter of God. This message did not make you a son of God. This message did not make you a daughter of God. But what it did was break the scales off your eyes and gave you the revelation that you are a son of God. And you are a daughter of God. Amen. Listen, I tell you what it did. It restored to you your proper identity. Amen. That we are right now the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word has restored us back to it. See, amen. We was born a son and daughter of God. You believe that? Amen. The prophet's clear on it. He said, "You come to the altar, you didn't become a son when you came to the altar." Amen. Listen to me, young man. You always was a son of God. Amen. You didn't become a son, but you was born a son. It don't matter if you make a mistake or you backslid. You're still a son. All you need to do is be restored back to your rightful place. Amen. You may fall down, but that's the whole point of restoration because you get restored back to your rightful place. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Amen. How many thanks God for restoration? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know according to the scripture, you see the prodical son. I think it's a perfect illustration because Amen. He was born a son. I just love how the Bible puts it because he was there in that pig pin. brother and sister. And the Bible records that he came to himself. Now, can I ask you a question? When he was in the pig pin, was he still a son? &gt;&gt; When he was in the pig pin, was he still a son or because he fell down, did it change him and he was no longer a son? No, sir. When he was in the pig pin and he was living a riotous life, he still had an identity because he came from his father and he was the seed of his father. And it didn't matter where he went. His seed remained in him. And the Bible says, "Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to because his seed remainth in him." Amen. While you was running from God, you were still a son. And while you was making mistakes and living in sin, you was still a son and daughter of God. You just needed to be restored to your rightful place. I thank God for his grace and mercy that he restored us back to our rightful place as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; See, we need a realization and the end restoration. I I just love that. Amen. The prophet would talk about different versions of the Bible, but I was just reading along here in Joel the second chapter, our text that we read in the Amplified Bible would read it this way. I will compensate you. Ain't that beautiful? I will compensate you for the years that swarming locust has seen other other Greeks and translations would say I will repay you. I will give you back what you lost. I will make up to you the years that you lost. You know, I just got to worshiping God on that scripture and I got to thinking of Job there in the scripture. Amen. And the devil came up to God and God said, "Have you consider have you considered Spirit and Truth Tabernacle in West Palm? Have you considered my servant down there in Aoski North? Have you have you considered them?" Oh, yeah. I consider them, but you put a hedge round about them. You put a hedge around them and I can't get to them. And God said, you you you you can go down there and do what you want to. And then the devil began having a conversation up in heaven talking to God. He said, listen, the only reason that Job is serving you is because everything's going good and all of his bills are paid. Hello. And he's got money in the bank and his family's in church and you know, revival fires are burning. The only reason he's worshiping you is because he's got everything made. He's got everything made. But you let me put my hand on that woman and you let me put my hand on that man and I'll make him curse you to your face. And God said, "Job, go or or a devil, go ahead." And what began to happen? He went down and and Job's children got killed and his livestock got burned up and his house fell down on in them. And all of this terrible, terrible things begin to happen. Amen. And Job is now sitting here on an ash heap. And he had lost everything. And the devil said, "I'm going to stop him from worshiping God. I'm going to stop him from praising God. I'm going to stop his servitude unto God." And that was the devil's objective was to make Job curse God to his face. And I tell you what, Job sat there on that ash sheep and was scraping his balls there and he looked up into the heavens and said, "I know my redeemer lives." He said, "Blessed be the name of the Lord. You gave to me and you take away, but blessed be your name." And then God said, "Listen, Job, I'm going to repay you for everything that the devil took away." Amen. Listen, the devil tried to stop your praise and the devil tried to stop your worship and the devil tried to take your victory and he took and he took and he took and we stand here today. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You give and you take away. And then God says, Job, Job, I will restore. And he got double the money and he got double the blessings and he got double the rest. Hey, listen. If God takes something away from you, he'll give you something back better than you ever had. If you're willing to let it go, amen, God will bless you in the overflow. Hey, the Bible says, "I can do exceedingly abundantly above all you can ask or say." Amen. We serve a God of miracles. Amen. A God of restoration. Well, shout aloud this morning. Y'all know it's the truth. Amen. Look there in the scripture and the devil says they they just worship you because they got it good and they're blessed and the church is blessed and the church got no problems. But let me go down there for a minute and I'll kill that church. Remember there, amen, in the scripture when the Syrian army was they were taunting the children of Israel and said, "Listen, the only reason Israel's winning is because they're on the mountaintop." Y it's the Bible. The only reason Israel's winning is because they're on the mountaintop and they've got an advantage over us. Hallelujah to God. They've got an advantage. But you put them down in the valley and we will surely destroy them. And then the Bible says there was a man of God that came out on the seventh day. Hallelujah. There was a man that came out on the seventh day and he said, "Because you made this boast, I will show you that he is not only the God of the mountain, but he is also the God of the valley." And the Bible says that the children of Israel, Amen, slew a 100,000 Syrians. It wasn't just a victory. It was a great victory. It wasn't just a little victory. It was a great victory. And because the devil's made fun of you and the devil's taunted you and says she's only God on a mountain. Amen. Watch my God. He'll show up in the midst of your valley. He'll show up in the midst of your tribulation. Hey, he's God on my mountain. He's God on my way down. And he's God in the valley. Hallelujah. I'll restore it. I'll give it all back. &gt;&gt; What a God we serve. I'll give it all back. I'll restore everything back. I tell you what, Amen. The devil's all the time tempting God and tempting his children. Well, the reason why you worship and the re listen, we don't praise God out of our surroundings. We praise God according to the word. It was the Pentecostal realm. The only time they could worship was when they had music playing and they had their emotions worked up. Amen. That's not what this is, brother, sister. Amen. It is according to the word. Amen. Listen, we don't praise God and worship God because of our surroundings. We worship and praise God according to the word. Amen. People come along and say, "Father Solomon, you know, you see all these things happening and the prophecies being fulfilled. Ain't it just an exciting time and we got an American pope and we got this and we got that and I think yeah that's pretty good. That's wonderful. But I believed it just when I saw the prophet said it. Amen. I didn't have to see it, brother Larry, to believe it was going to happen because I knew God said it. And I was worshiping back when I saw the prophecy. Hallelujah. I said I was worshiping back when I saw the prophecy even if I didn't see the fulfillment of it. I saw the prophecy and to the bride prophecy is as good as fulfillment. See, that's your problem. You're waiting for it to get good to praise God and you won't ever worship God. You're waiting for the blessing to come and you won't ever praise God and worship God until you see the fulfillment. But how about you stop letting your problems, Amen, dictate your worship, and you're letting your surroundings dictate your worship when nobody else is saying, "Amen. Who cares what anybody else Well, nobody else is entering in. Who cares what anybody else does?" Amen. This ain't you and the church and God. Amen. This is you and God alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the truth. That's exactly right. I think it's time, church. We've been restored back to true Bible worship. I I just love Paul and Silas in the Bible. This is people with excuses. You know, we get a flat tire. Well, you know, I guess God don't love me no more. We get some issues. Well, I guess God don't care about me no more. Paul and Silas was in a jail cell. &gt;&gt; And there was folks that had a reason not to worship God and not to serve God. It would have been them two men that was in prison for preaching the word. But you know what? They didn't let their surroundings, Amen, control them. In other words, they was in the middle of a flood. But the only way the boat goes down is if the water gets in the boat. And that's the problem. Amen. Listen, the water can't hurt you. But when the water gets in the boat, Amen, that water will drown you. And that's the problem. You're letting water get in your boat. Is that okay? You're letting water get into your boat. When that water was made to I just love the teaching of the prophet. He said that same water underneath the Andaluvian destruction. He said it was judgment and it was condemnation to the world. He said, "But to Noah, hallelujah, but to Noah and the people that was in the ark, it was not condemnation. It was their deliverance and it was their victory." Amen. The same water that kills your enemy and that kills the one beside you is the same water that carries you above the tribulation. Amen. You thought that water would kill you, but that water was sent to carry you. &gt;&gt; But keep it out of the boat. Keep it out of the boat. See, that's the problem. You let you let the water get in the boat and the boat goes down quick. And that's what I I got to move on. God help me. Let's get back to the scripture here. And Joel, uh, I never really went back that scripture prior in Joel the second chapter. And I wanted to get a better background according to the Bible. What was the Bible really saying when God said, "I'll restore unto you the years." And I just began to take a good Bible study. And I tell you, Amen. You find this very crucial when you find a good truth in the Bible, go and read that chapter before and then go and read that chapter after. And look at look at the the meaning of the word. Look at what the Bible's trying to say. And see, that's a lot of issues that we get is that we'll isolate one little thing and we make us say something totally different. We isolate one scripture. You realize you can take the Bible and make it say there is no God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says there is no God beside me. If you isolate there is no God for you know what this Bible says there ain't no God. That's the danger of you isolating the word. That's why you go back a little and go forward a little and say, "Oh, okay. There is no God beside me. Not there is no God. That's free. You can take that and do what you want with it. In Joel 1 and 13, the Bible, I think it's powerful. You're you're reading here in this scripture and you read about a horrible locust invasion. The Bible says the vines had dried up and the crops had been destroyed and it was a horrible sight. And then you find in Joel 1:13, you you find a call to repentance. I thought, my God, what is this in this? You you you find a call to repentance. And the Bible says, "Gird yourselves and lament, ye priests. How ye ministers of the altar, come and lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God. For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholdened from the house of God, and sanctify ye a fast, and call a solemn assembly, and gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord." And I begin reading now. I thought my whatever condition they got into, they needed to repent their way out of it. How many still believes in repentance? Probably said, I got to do it daily. You find God telling them, "Come and repent. Cry loud, ye priests, how ye ministers." And I thought, "My God, there it is. God is telling them, listen, look, look at what you got on your hand. Your crops are dead and all these things are destroyed." And then God tells them to repent. God says, cry out. But then you read just a chapter after this, after their repentance and after they make things right in Joel 2:25, then God tells them, "I'll restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten." And I thought, "My God, there it is. True restoration happens after repentance happens." And you can't mix the two up together. And I I thought about there it is beautifully because we want God to bless us while we're in sin. And we want God to move on us while we're still Jacob. Amen. But Jacob could not get blessed until Jacob was turned into Israel. Is that the truth? And everybody wants to bless him without the separation. And everybody wants to be Abraham, but they don't want to sojourn. Amen. And separate. And the prophet preached a message on it. He said, "God's word calls for a total separation of all unbelief." &gt;&gt; And I began studying this. I thought, "My, when you repent, you're literally releasing yourself to the blessings of God." When you separate from your sin, you are a candidate of restoration. And I thought, my, how can God restore us to the position he's called us to if we're still holding on to Egypt? Amen. See, you can never go into the land of Canaan while holding on to Egypt. But if you'll ever get brave enough to let go of Egypt, then God can take you in to the land of Canaan. Amen. And see, we can preach about the blessings of God and talk about it. But you don't find the blessing until you find the separation. Amen. See, it's when he separated that God restored life to Abraham and restored life to Sarah. It was after the separation, then you got the blessing. And see, if there would have been no separation, there would have been no fulfillment of the promise to Abraham. If there would have been no separation, there would have been no promise sign. And see, that's why you have to be careful when you look at this one and you look at this one and oh, he's so blessed and she's so blessed. But you don't know what it took to get there. You don't know the trials and the tribulations and the fighting and and you look at that man and you say, "My, he's so blessed." You wouldn't want to go through what I had to go through. You wouldn't want to go through what she had to go through. Amen. Listen, for Joseph to be on the right hand of Pharaoh, he had to go to prison. Amen. He had to be a slave. Now, how many of y'all want to go to prison and be a slave for years and years and years? I mean, I don't want to do that. But see, that was necessary for Joseph. Before he could be exalted, he first had to be humiliated. And let me tell you this, you may be in the worst trial of your life and you feel like you're in the prison and you're humiliated. Let me tell you, amen. Maybe it's just you're on your way, amen, to victory. And you're on your way, amen, to the right hand of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can talk about the great feats of Noah, but we don't talk about the hundred years he preached the same sermon with the same title. &gt;&gt; Same sermon. Sometimes we preach the same sermon, different title. My wife kissed me all the time. She said, "I heard that one before. You use a different title, didn't you?" I said, "You got me." Same sermon, different title. Still the word of God. &gt;&gt; Noah's there preaching for 120 years looking like a crazy man. We talk about, oh, how awesome it was to see him on that ark and all the blessings of God, but he preached the same sermon for 120 years. So, you'll find that it's linked together. You find there's a separation, then there's a blessing. There's a separation, then there's a blessing. Amen. There's repentance, then there's restoration. And it ties perfectly into the Bible. You read in Gabriel's instruction to Daniel, the prophet talks about Israel. He said God never did deal with Israel. Listen, until she came back to her homeland. And the Bible said, "Hear me." Thus sayaeth the Lord, God will not deal with his church until she comes back to the homeland. The message of the hour. And the prophet says, screams it out. Amen. Come back to the original. So you see in the word after repentance is the restoration. And I think it's beautiful because we we don't know the condition the children of Israel got in, but whatever it was, they needed to repent. And ain't it something that immediately after repentance, God said, "I'm not going to hold you accountable. I'm not going to worry about what you did. I'm not going to even think twice about it. I'm just going to restore to you everything you lost." I think it's beautiful to realize that because after you have repented of something in the eyes of God, there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ. Ain't it amazing that in one verse of scripture, God is saying to repent and to cry out. And then in the next chapter, God makes an outstanding promise. I will restore unto you all the years that you lost while you was living in sin. I say we ought to repent and then we ought to come and receive the blessings of God. Amen. And I love what the Bible says. The Bible says, "I will restore. Not I might, not I'll think about it, not as possible. But when you repent and come back to your homeland, the message of the hour, God says, I will do this. If you'll come back to the word, and that's where the revival is, brother, sister. If you want revival in your church, then come back to the word. It is the word born revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, that's the problem. We think, well, you know, I'm not worthy for restoration. I'm not worthy to come back. And you know, some people act like they're Catholics. &gt;&gt; I got to pay for my sin. I got to pay I got to pay penance. I can't just move on that easy. Why not? &gt;&gt; I can't move on. My back's sleep. I just can't breathe. Why can't you move on from it? If God himself could move on, hallelujah. I said, if Jesus himself could move on from your sin and your mistake and your backslide, then why in the world, Amen, can you not forgive yourself and move on from what you did? Hey, listen. You can't change what's in the past. And that's what the Bible says. forgetting those things which are behind me and I press. You can't change what you did, but you can change what you do now. I say, let's go into the promises of God and move on. If Jesus could forgive you, I think you ought to be able to forgive you, too. And I I think it's beautiful to realize God said, "I restore it unto you." And let me tell you, there is no condition. It don't matter how bad it is. It don't matter how horrible it is. Amen. God made a promise that I will restore it. You say, "Where are we going back to, brother Solomon? We're not even just going back to the day of Pentecost. I've just got to forget the notes and run out of time and preach all day." Amen. But look, the bride, when does it start? Started at Acts, the second chapter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But look at God's first masterpiece. I just got to preach these things to you. The prophet preached a whole message called the masterpiece. And he said God had his masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden. He said it was beautiful. There was love, there was equality, there was dominion, there was power, there was anointing, there was all of these things. And the prophet said that was God's first perfect masterpiece. And he said the devil came in and he marred that masterpiece. And and the prophet said that masterpiece fell to the ground. And he said that masterpiece, her face was laying down. And brother Ram said that God was a just God. Is that right? And he had to keep his word. And brother Ram said that he saw them going out of the garden of Eden and he could not refrain himself and he could not help himself. I just love the way the prophet said. He said, "I saw a funnel come down." He said, "And a spelled L O V E coming down in the Garden of the Eden." And then God prophesied and he said, "Listen, I'll not leave it this way. I'll not leave my masterpiece with their face on the ground." And then God made a prophecy. He said, "I'll put enmity between thy seed and the woman's seed." Is that right? The woman don't have a seed. Where did she get it? She got it from God and got it from the conception of the Holy Ghost. And then what was it? It was God prophesying of Messiah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to restore. I'm going to put immity. There's going to be a Messiah. And God prophesied. And then 2,000 some years later, Messiah is on the earth. Amen. And that's paying the price of sin, right? That's paying the debt that is owed. That is being the lamb. That's being the kinsman redeemer. That is everything in the scripture. Him fulfilling it. But it was not total restoration when he died on Calvary. It was redemption. Sure, it was salvation. It was healing, but it was not yet total restoration. Amen. And then some days later after his crucifixion, the Holy Ghost comes down in Acts the second chapter and it fills every vessel. But that was not total restoration as of yet. Amen. It was the potentials of everything, but it was not complete restoration yet. And then you find the prophet said that was the start of the bride tree and that was the church in infancy. &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? Are you with me? And the tree begins to grow up. Amen. And Paul begins preaching the unadulterated word. And brother Ram said after Paul died, it was a short number of years. The church went into apostasy and they begin to abandon the the the teachings of Paul. It was complete abandonment. They just left the teachings of Paul. But there was a word hovering on the earth, but I will restore everything that is broken down. And the prophet said, "And then here come Lucer." He said, "And begin the tree begin to come up and then denominated. And then that Lutheran worm begin to eat the tree back down and kill it back down. And here it come up again. And then it ate the tree down and kill it back down. But see, in the evening time, brother, amen, there was a prophecy. In the evening time, it shall be light. And brother showed you so powerful. He said, "Look at that tree. It started to grow." He said, "And it was the churches. It was the churches that began to kill down that tree." I mean, let me tell you this, brother, sister. It's the church world. That was Amen. That Lutheran worm. Amen. And the caterpillar and the cankrine worm. Amen. The prophet said that was denominational systems. Amen. That was tearing down the bride tree and was cutting her down. And the prophet said that that that that tree got ate all the way down to the roots. Now, I tell you what, I want to preach on this for a moment. He said that tree got ate all the way down to the roots. He said, "But in them roots, them roots was a predestinated root. And God predestinated them roots." He said, "And it was only roots that was left." And the prophet screamed, "Now, but I will restore, sayeth the Lord." I thought, "My, it was ate all the way down to the root." But yet God says, "I'll restore this bride tree again." And he preached a masterpiece and called it the restoration of the bride tree. He said, "What the Lutheran ate off and what the Methodists ate off and what the Pentecostals ate off." He said, "What they do?" The Amen. The Methodists came off and and the Lutherans came off and ate the leaves off. He said ate the fruit off the tree. Fruits of the spirit. He said, "Eate the bark off." He said that was the woman's clothes. Is that right? Begin to eat the bark off her tree and said, "Mon modesty don't matter anymore." And brother Ram said that was the destruction of the bride tree. And all these church bugs came together. Amen. I think ain't it a shame that it was these churches that took worship out of the church and took the gifts out of the church and took the Holy Ghost out of the church and that's why to the Leodysian church age the Bible says Christ was on the outside of the door and he was knocking trying to get in because the church put them out and the prophet said but them roots he said was predestinated roots and there was a prophecy on the roots that I'll restore and I will bring her back again. And let me tell you this. Amen. I as I'm giving you my title, restoration no matter condition. You may be here today and you may feel like you've been broken down and you've been beat down and you've been tore down and all you've got left is the root. Let me tell you, you are a predestinated root and all God needs is the roots and he'll start rebuilding you and rebuilding you. He will fulfill his word no matter the condition that you are in. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. My mind comes back to Ezekiel there. Y'all know the scripture. Ezekiel's there in the Old Testament. God comes to him says, "Son of man, look at this valley of dry bones in here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at these dry bones. And Ezekiel said, "And I beheld and they was very dry." Not dry, very dry. And then God said, "Can can this tree live again?" Oh God, can this tree live again? Can this army be restored? Can this bride tree live again? And then Ezekiel the prophet turned up to God and said, "God, thou knowest. Thou knowest if they can live again or not." And then God responded to the prophet on earth. It's God in heaven. It's the prophet on earth. It was the mighty angel in heaven. while the seventh angel was upon the earth at the time of the descent of the mighty angel and he asked Ezekiel and said can they live again and he said you know Lord he said so I said prophesy son of man &gt;&gt; what's prophesy means to preach prophesy son of man and I just love Ezekiel he said so I said amen valley of dry bones hear ye the word of the lord and live began and the prophet said and the Bible records it so beautifully. He said bone came on bone and senue came on senue. What was restoring the dry bones? It was the word of the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said it was the word of the prophet's message and bone came back to bone and sin. You came back to senue and let me tell you brother sister it don't matter the condition of the church. There is going to be a bride. She will be without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish. She can do the greater works. She will be a continuation of the I don't care what you say. I don't care what it looks like. I don't you and folks come along say, don't you see the problems in the church? I say yes. Don't you see the issues in the church? I say yes. But I say, don't you see the prophecy in the word? But brother said, don't you see the problems in this? I say yes, I do. But don't you see the word? Do you think the problems in your church is going to stop the prophecy that is in the word? Do you think your failures and your shortcomings is going to stop the prophecy? God already calculated before the foundation of the world. He is the chief cornerstone. He is the master builder. And he calculated it. And he knew his word would be enough to restore you back to your place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew his word would be good enough to restore life back to the dry bones. &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the condition and look at the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stop looking at yourself and looking in the mirror and looking at the issues and that's your problem because you're looking at your church. God said look unto me all you amen that are burdened and and heavy. God said, "Look unto me and live." Amen. That's why we get discouraged is because we're looking at the wrong thing. I think it's time we refocus our eyes and let's start looking back to the word of Almighty God. And where you look is where you're going to go. And if you look to the word, the word you will go. I say, God granted that. I think it's so beautiful. The prophet said God was not willing to leave that family on the ground. We like to read the quote to you. He said, "But the great sculptor, he saw the fall of his family, the masterpiece, but he was not willing to just leave it lay there face down and ruin." Let me tell you, God is not willing to see you laying down, face down, tore up, discouraged, torn out, beat out. God ain't going to leave you that way. Can I prophesy to you this morning? God ain't going to leave it that way. You may be discouraged, but God ain't going to leave you that way. Amen. I'm going to close right here. Musicians, go ahead and come. Amen. You may be tore up and defeated and discouraged, but God ain't going to leave it that way. Amen. Look back to the word and look at the prophecy of the scripture. You may say, "Well, Son, my condition is bad. I'm backsliding. I'm not where I need to be." So were them dry bones. Hallelujah. So were them dry bones. But did the dry bones stop the word of God? &gt;&gt; Stand to your feet if you will. Did the dry bones stop the prophecy? I tell you how I I think of the testimony. You're very familiar with it. I'm sure prophet talked about that vision of that dead boy in Finland. I think it's the most powerful testimony. But years before prophecy, years before this ever happened, there was a dead boy down in Finland and brother Ram saw a vision and saw the dead boy was run over by a car, had a bowl cut hair and his leggings torn up and all these things. It was just perfect. And they wrote it down. See, prophecy is beforehand, not after. Just because you prophesied what happened today don't make you a prophet. I could have done that. I knew he was going to be wearing a green suit because I see I ain't a prophet. A prophet's before it happens. That's a true prophet. What if he says comes to pass and hear him? Brother Ram has that vision of that boy there in Finland and he's he's all dead and he's crushed up. It's a horrible vision that brother Ram sees and the condition the boy's in. He said they're there in Finland for the meeting and and they're they come up on a car crash and and brother Ram says, "I saw a little boy out there laying and I thought my what an awful sight this is. What a horrible sight it is." And they got out and begin to look. Brother looked at the boy and said I could just barely look at it because I had my boy at home and I thought my this is somebody's kid that's here. Ram said, "I turned and began to walk away." He said, "But there was a hand that got put on my shoulder." He said, "And I would have missed the vision." &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought, who put the hand on my was brother? Was it brother Moore? Was it this brother?" Well, he said, "But it was God." He said, "There was a hand on my shoulder and I turned me back to the boy." He said, "And I looked at the boy and I said, "Wait a minute. This is the vision. &gt;&gt; This is the vision that's happened. This is the vision." But brother Moore, whoever it was, go get your Bible, get your fly leaf out, read it. They begin to read it. He said, "Yeah, this is exactly the vision." And so, Brother Brandham said, "I already knew what was going to happen. Hallelujah." He could have already started to praise and worship and shout because he already knew what would happen. And said, "I came down there to the young boy and begin to pronounce life over him and said, "Breathe the breath of God. God would store life back into him." And the prophet said that the boy jumped back up and received his life. And it was a great victory that was won. You say, "Bro, son, why do you say that?" Amen. Because you was that boy. Amen. You was that person that was dead and crushed up and torn up, but you was in the vision. You say, "What vision?" Amen. The prophet went beyond the curtain of time. Amen. He went he went to another world and begin to see a vision take place. And he saw that alpha church, the church under the prophet Paul. He said, "But then I saw another church begin to come and it was that omega church." church. He said it was the bride that was coming out of the Leo in church age. And he said that last church looked just like the first church and she was marching according to the word. You said what does that mean? I'll tell you what it means. I represent myself in that vision. If you can handle it, maybe you can't, but I see myself in that vision. Amen. The prophet already saw me over there. I'm that omega church. I'm that omega bride. I'm the one that was walking according to the word just like they was. Just like the alpha church is what the omega church is. And it don't matter how crushed that boy was. Isn't that just so powerful? The said, "If God showed me a vision to go down into the presidential graveyard and call Josh George Washington from the grave, he said, I'd invite the whole entire world to come watch it." And let me just put you on notice. I invite every devil in hell. I invite all of our critics. I invite all of our naysayers. I invite the people that want to see us stumble and fall. I invite all of the enemy that wants to see us, Amen, backslide and fall from God. I invite every single one of them and they say, "There won't be a rapture. You won't make it." I say, "Watch me do it according to the prophecy of the word." Hallelujah. I'm not waiting to get my joy. I'm not waiting to worship. But I see myself in the prophecy. You say, "Why are you happy no matter what happens to you?" Because I see myself in the word. And I know no matter what happens, it's in his hands. But Lord, if you would have been here, you could have changed it. But I know you. You got the words of life eternal. Hallelujah. And even if you're four days late, you're still right on time. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. I I trust this has been a help to you. Amen. Restoration no matter condition. I love the scripture. The trials of our present time are not even worthy to be compared to the glory. Ain't that just wonderful? the stuff you're going through, it ain't even worthy compared to the glory that shall be revealed in you. So if you're going through the valley, praise God. If you're going through the worst time of your life, worship God. May God bless you. We turn to your pastor. Praise the Lord. What a what a wonderful uh word from the Lord. Restoration no matter the condition. Um just Brother Solomon was just kind of going through that and Restoration is just it's a very vast subject certainly deals with us at the individual level then you know from the church ages um there's restoration there just so much that can be preached this but as he was just dealing with a little component there of the the individual and my god just David did not lose salvation David lost the joy of his salvation and was talking about that prodical son and how when he was in the pig pit did that change his status. So your condition does not change your status your son of God in the pig pin or in the father's house. It's just for you to recognize that there are more benefits in the father's house &gt;&gt; than in the pig pin. &gt;&gt; But it does not change your status which whichever way you choose to be. But what what happens is that you come to the realization that I'm still a son no matter what the devil is taking me through and I'm going to be all that God wants me to be. We'll go there. I will be what you've called me to be and I'll say yes. Lord, I agree. My desire, passion and is to be what you've called me to be. That's what I will be. And that's what I will be. Come on, sing it again. Oh, I will be what? you've called me to be. Tell the Lord I'll say yes. Oh Lord, I agree. My desire passionately is to be is to be what you've called me to be. That's what I will be. Hallelujah. Come on, let's do it again. I will be what you call me to be. I will be what you call me to be. Hallelujah. I'll say yes. Tell the Lord I agree. Come on. my desire passion on me. Oh, what you've called me to be, that's what I'll be. Come on, sounds real good. I agree with your word and I will be what you call me. God, I say yes. Lord, I agree. My desire patiently [Music] for is to be what you've called me to be. That's what I will be. Oh, and I'll say yes. Yes. Oh, I agree. What your word said about me, Jesus. How [Music] I agree. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'll say yes. I'll say yes. Yes, I agree. Come on, lift your hands in this place. Tell the Lord yes. Everybody say I'll say yes. Yes. [Music] God, I agree. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'll say yes. [Music] Yes, I agree. One more time with all your heart. Tell me, Lord, I'll say yes to your word, God. I'll say yes. Yes. [Music] I agree. [Music] I will be what you call me to be. I will be what you call. &gt;&gt; Oh, say yes. Lord, I agree. My desire passionately oh to be that's what I'll be that's what I will be [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Thank you, Jesus. You can be seated just for a moment. Amen. Lord, I agree. I agree with what your word say. I'm so glad that predestination was laying in the roots of the tree. The predestinated promise, the word of God was laying in the root. God knew the condition before it even got there. And when It looked absolutely hopeless. There was a prophecy in the roots. And maybe your situation this morning looks absolutely hopeless. But when you get to that space, there is a prophecy that is waiting for you at that condition. Prophecy says, "I will restore." When you can't help yourself, but he'll help you. I will restore saith the Lord. Oh, how we thank God. Was told u to do one thing here in the service. The prophet told us service is not complete unless we have an offering.
