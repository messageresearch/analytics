[1:05:19] things give him thanks give him things I
[1:05:23] wanted to just quickly update where we
[1:05:31] were with our pledges
[1:05:34] all I can see is God is good god is god
[1:05:39] is good we are we believe in God for a
[1:05:45] new church and a new school we believe
[1:05:50] in God for that and they meant our faith
[1:05:51] is on the line and we have begun to make
[1:05:54] pledges a man on this there are a couple
[1:06:00] numbers that are increasing on this
[1:06:02] every time I'm showing this to you all
[1:06:04] one number that has remained the same as
[1:06:08] this is our goal
[1:06:09] amen for this year for the next few
[1:06:11] years we are trying to raise one hundred
[1:06:12] and five thousand dollars every year in
[1:06:16] order to get the place that we want and
[1:06:18] we're asking that the church would just
[1:06:21] pledge towards that and then since
[1:06:22] laughs since last month this number
[1:06:26] actually rose somebody else pledged and
[1:06:29] we thank God for that a man so we thank
[1:06:33] God but that's actually moving to catch
[1:06:35] up with this so if you haven't pledged
[1:06:37] you can get in on this it's don't miss
[1:06:39] your blessing hey man they only come
[1:06:41] every once in awhile so if you want a
[1:06:43] pledge to help us get to this this level
[1:06:45] of it man we have a little form out
[1:06:47] there on the on that you're going out
[1:06:49] you can pledge and put it in a little
[1:06:50] box and we will certainly receive it as
[1:06:54] a vote right now we have received twenty
[1:06:56] nine thousand three hundred forty six
[1:06:59] dollars and four cents
[1:07:01] on our on our goal praise the Lord I'm
[1:07:10] excited about that I mean I just see the
[1:07:13] Lord just working in our midst and it's
[1:07:15] moving we've never had a season like
[1:07:19] this state man in our church and and I
[1:07:21] know that it's a hand of the Lord that
[1:07:23] is that is blessing his people a man and
[1:07:26] rather y'all keep it in your pocket
[1:07:28] y'all giving it back to the Lord and God
[1:07:30] God keep on blessing you right so we
[1:07:33] thank you for that and you know so
[1:07:34] that's so far we have $29,000 towards
[1:07:38] that and early in a year we had a four
[1:07:43] hundred dollar transfer that we pull out
[1:07:45] of this balance we pulled out because we
[1:07:47] had to pay our rent amen and we
[1:07:50] mentioned to the church that we don't
[1:07:52] want to do that that number should never
[1:07:53] be there and since that time the church
[1:07:56] has stepped up and you all have you know
[1:07:59] just helped me the need every month and
[1:08:01] I'm grateful for that and so I met a man
[1:08:05] on this is twenty eight thousand nine
[1:08:06] hundred forty six even though we
[1:08:08] received twenty nine thousand we had to
[1:08:10] take four hundred out so our net is
[1:08:12] twenty eight thousand
[1:08:14] is that right I might be looking at
[1:08:16] something you have 28,000 946 so just we
[1:08:20] thank God for that so we're still making
[1:08:22] progress we're moving in the right
[1:08:23] direction and all over on Friday night
[1:08:27] my brother branham made a statement that
[1:08:29] just kind of hit me
[1:08:32] he said he received a check for a
[1:08:35] million dollars in the other tables I
[1:08:40] received a check for a million dollars
[1:08:41] now he was saying it was somebody wrote
[1:08:43] him a check that was signed in the name
[1:08:46] of Jesus or something like that but when
[1:08:48] he said I'm like no I'm taking that
[1:08:49] literally if God can send somebody with
[1:08:54] a check for a thousand dollars Kenny
[1:08:55] says somebody with a check for a million
[1:08:56] dollars praise God
[1:08:59] so I say I'm receiving that man and I'm
[1:09:03] looking forward to one day y'all gonna
[1:09:04] see me come up y'all go see the number
[1:09:06] there to jump from 29,000 to 1 million

[1:09:18] expectation ain't man and and I'm
[1:09:21] looking forward to seeing what God gonna
[1:09:23] do with this a man y'all know if y'all
[1:09:26] just give it to him he'll bless it
[1:09:28] when we gave it a Jesus he's able to
[1:09:30] multiply it right and y'all just watch
[1:09:33] what he does with that I'm I'm on the

[1:11:19] before Amen here the church we had a
[1:11:21] body was playing a music and my god we
[1:11:23] couldn't get no cooperation with him but

[1:16:48] to the sermon the power of the devil the
[1:16:51] power of the devil and and I'm kind of
[1:16:54] I'm taken from some things that he said
[1:16:56] there on Friday night and we're building
[1:16:58] our thought for today and I trust that
[1:17:01] it'll be a blessing to you a man I want
[1:17:05] praise the Lord I want to have you turn
[1:17:08] to Exodus 1 and the the title today is
[1:17:13] the end of Satan's Dominion a man that
[1:17:16] is our title today the end of Satan's
[1:17:19] Dominion praise the Lord
[1:17:21] a man turn with me to Exodus chapter 1 a
[1:17:26] man
[1:17:28] how they lujah and I'm starting here
[1:17:31] verse 12
[1:17:32] Amen in Exodus chapter 1 it says but the
[1:17:38] more they afflicted them the more they
[1:17:41] multiplied and grew and they were
[1:17:45] grieved because of the children of
[1:17:47] Israel and Egyptians made the children
[1:17:50] of Israel to serve with rigor and they
[1:17:53] made their lives bitter with hard
[1:17:54] bondage and mortar and in brick and in
[1:17:58] all manner of service in the field all
[1:18:00] their service wherein they made them
[1:18:02] serve was with rigor and the king of
[1:18:06] Egypt speak to the Hebrews the Hebrew
[1:18:09] midwives of which the name of the one
[1:18:11] was Chiffre in the name of the other and
[1:18:16] he said when you do the office of a
[1:18:18] midwife to the Hebrew woman and see them
[1:18:21] upon the stools if it be a son then you
[1:18:23] shall kill him but if it be a daughter
[1:18:26] then she shall live but the midwives
[1:18:29] feared God and did not as the king of
[1:18:32] Egypt commanded them but saved the men
[1:18:35] children alive and the king of Egypt
[1:18:38] called for the midwives and said unto
[1:18:39] them why have you done this thing and
[1:18:41] have saved the men children alive and
[1:18:45] the midwives said unto Pharaoh because
[1:18:47] the Hebrew women are not as Egyptian
[1:18:49] women for they are lively and I'll
[1:18:51] deliver ere the midwives come in unto
[1:18:54] them pretty much before we get there
[1:18:56] they already had the children right so
[1:18:59] it's verse 21 says and it came to pass
[1:19:01] I'm sorry is that right verse 20 now
[1:19:04] therefore God dealt well with the
[1:19:07] midwives and the people multiplied and
[1:19:09] waxed very mighty and it came to pass
[1:19:13] because the midwives feared God that he
[1:19:17] made them
[1:19:18] this amen because they fear at God he
[1:19:22] made them houses and Ferrell charged all
[1:19:26] his people saying every son that is born
[1:19:28] ye shall cast every son that is born he
[1:19:32] shall cast it into the river and every
[1:19:34] daughter ye shall save alive amen the
[1:19:38] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:19:39] his word let's just bow and a quick word
[1:19:41] of Prayer
[1:19:42] a man father we thank you for the
[1:19:46] ability to read the word of the Lord
[1:19:49] but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:19:51] bring things clearer to us so we pray
[1:19:54] God that you would just help us to hear
[1:19:56] what the the Spirit wants to stay here
[1:19:59] on today be glorified and magnified in
[1:20:02] this place and God we want to also just
[1:20:04] thank you for this church that you have
[1:20:06] blessed with a location where they can
[1:20:09] worship you and praise you and thank you
[1:20:12] God the same way that you provided for
[1:20:15] them and yes it was you that provided
[1:20:17] for them because the Prophet told us
[1:20:20] that you are responding that they're
[1:20:22] your responsibility the church natural
[1:20:24] and the church spiritual is still your
[1:20:26] responsibility so the same way that you
[1:20:29] provide it for them is the same way that
[1:20:31] you have provided for us and will
[1:20:33] provide for us so we we actually react
[1:20:37] we actually thank you for the doors that
[1:20:39] you are already opening and and Lord
[1:20:41] every we're gonna walk into something we
[1:20:44] were believing you for a new church in a
[1:20:45] new school and and God we've given you
[1:20:47] amen thus far thirty thousand dollars
[1:20:51] for you to multiply a man
[1:20:55] and we're not afraid of any any number
[1:20:57] that they might throw before if it's if
[1:20:59] it's for us then there's no number that
[1:21:01] can stop us from getting it praise God
[1:21:04] so father you are you are God that you
[1:21:07] provide thousands and you provide
[1:21:09] millions and God's or whatever the need
[1:21:11] is we know that you'll provide we thank
[1:21:13] you in advance and we give you glory we
[1:21:15] give you honor we give you praise this
[1:21:16] in Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:21:19] bless you can be seated
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] man so again our title here is the end
[1:21:29] of Satan's Dominion and as we that the
[1:21:33] scripture the very last verse here Nexus
[1:21:36] 1 says in Pharaoh charge all his people
[1:21:38] saying every son that is born he shall
[1:21:42] cast into the river and every daughter
[1:21:46] ye shall save alive a man every every
[1:21:50] daughter ye shall save alive every son
[1:21:52] was to be cast into the river
[1:21:55] but every daughter was to be saved alive
[1:21:57] now the Prophet just kind of gives us a
[1:22:00] man a few things that we want to start
[1:22:03] out with here and this will read a quote
[1:22:05] out of the message the power of the
[1:22:07] devil a man here in paragraph 24 it says
[1:22:11] look at him he says look at him as soon
[1:22:15] as we find the first chapter almost in
[1:22:19] Exodus the book of Redemption that we
[1:22:21] find the devil there to cut off the very
[1:22:23] program of God he says the first thing
[1:22:27] was was this issue made by Pharaoh that
[1:22:32] they would throw all the children
[1:22:33] melters and born of the Hebrews in the
[1:22:35] river and drowned them think of it that
[1:22:39] same lizard eyed devil a man how that
[1:22:43] back there in the beginning look at Abel
[1:22:45] as soon as Satan seen that through
[1:22:47] through that righteous seed through Abel
[1:22:50] was going to come out the Redeemer
[1:22:52] quickly he went to work to destroy the
[1:22:55] very thing the very chosen tool that God
[1:22:58] was going to use he went right straight
[1:23:01] to destroy it's a man and you know I was
[1:23:05] we were hitting something in Sunday
[1:23:07] school a couple weeks ago brother
[1:23:09] branham a the statement says what God
[1:23:11] has set his heart home Satan is bound to
[1:23:15] destroy right what God has set his heart
[1:23:18] on
[1:23:19] is bound to try to destroy and and if
[1:23:21] you could just kind of think back in
[1:23:23] your old life the various times where
[1:23:25] you about this close to death amen the
[1:23:28] various times I mean I can go back and I
[1:23:30] remember almost being drowned when I was
[1:23:32] a young man I remember being in a car
[1:23:35] accident when I was a you know the young
[1:23:38] young young adult a man just various
[1:23:41] times in my life where the devil tried
[1:23:42] to wipe me out right but and it's
[1:23:45] because when God has set his heart on
[1:23:47] something Satan is bound to try to
[1:23:49] destroy what God has said it's hard on
[1:23:51] they may enter hallelujah Amen here in
[1:23:54] this particular passage we'll see God
[1:23:57] has set his heart on Moses Amen and
[1:24:00] Moses is going to be the deliverer for
[1:24:02] the children of Israel but my saying
[1:24:05] don't know which one of these boys gonna
[1:24:06] be the deliverer
[1:24:07] so Satan's plan is to kill all the boys
[1:24:09] amen and hallelujah I want to say this
[1:24:13] real quick Satan could not amen
[1:24:17] be successful in his plan to kill Moses
[1:24:21] and he also will not be his successful
[1:24:24] and his plan to kill you
[1:24:28] hallelujah the same time that made away
[1:24:31] from Moses is the same God that is
[1:24:34] making a way for you oh yeah amen I was
[1:24:39] thinking about this you know see you
[1:24:41] know when we look at this the
[1:24:43] description was telling us that the more
[1:24:45] they were afflicted and these are
[1:24:47] conditions of of an exodus right these
[1:24:50] are the things that happened during the
[1:24:52] exodus when and and and here they were
[1:24:54] going out of each have been going into a
[1:24:56] promised land
[1:24:57] amen Egypt represents the world and we
[1:25:00] are leaving each of today going into a
[1:25:02] promised land which is the rapture amen
[1:25:04] that's what we're on the expectation for
[1:25:06] but during the accidents there are
[1:25:07] certain conditions that you'll see there
[1:25:09] and here we see the more they were
[1:25:11] afflicted the more they multiplied I
[1:25:14] like that
[1:25:15] Amen because if we were to be honest
[1:25:17] everybody in here got some type of trial
[1:25:19] that they're going through
[1:25:20] everybody in here got got something that
[1:25:23] our Amen it's like man I never saw that
[1:25:25] coming but but the more that the devil
[1:25:27] afflicts you amen the other side to that
[1:25:30] this is my brother I don't say when all
[1:25:32] hell break loose huh amen don't don't
[1:25:37] just don't just give the devil credits
[1:25:39] right when all hell break loose the
[1:25:41] other family I promise that all heaven
[1:25:44] will also break loose so the more they
[1:25:47] afflicted him the more they multiplied
[1:25:51] amen the greater the trial the greater
[1:25:54] the blessings the greater the tests the
[1:25:57] greater the testimony
[1:25:59] the more they afflicted them the more
[1:26:01] they multiplied and what a flick mean is
[1:26:05] to cause pain amen or distress
[1:26:08] so sometimes the devil does things that
[1:26:09] cause pain as well as the called
[1:26:12] distress the Bible also says that they
[1:26:14] had to serve the Egyptians with rigor
[1:26:16] amen and what that were rigor means is
[1:26:19] harshness they had to serve Amen under
[1:26:21] harsh terms and harsh conditions they
[1:26:24] had to serve with rigor sometimes when
[1:26:26] you're going through your job it seems
[1:26:28] like you're going through with rigor but
[1:26:31] that's the condition of the Exodus and
[1:26:33] the other thing the Bible said it made
[1:26:35] their lives bitter with hard bondage not
[1:26:39] just bondage but hard bondage may their
[1:26:41] lives bitter with hard bondage and and
[1:26:44] and the other thing I like about this is
[1:26:46] that was in verse 14 exits 1:14 since
[1:26:51] when they made their lives bitter with
[1:26:53] hard bondage in mortar amen and in brick
[1:26:57] and an awl man of service in the field
[1:27:00] all their service where they made them
[1:27:03] serve was with rigor and when you look
[1:27:07] at that everything they did everything
[1:27:10] everything they tried to do amen the
[1:27:13] devil's right there to make it very
[1:27:14] difficult for them hallelujah it's the
[1:27:17] same thing with us everything we try to
[1:27:19] do that Devils right there to try to
[1:27:21] make it difficult for us but he's a
[1:27:23] defeated foe hallelujah because that's
[1:27:26] just the first chapter but by the time
[1:27:28] you get to the end of Exodus they were
[1:27:30] delivered from Amen their bondage so no
[1:27:33] matter how hard the devil makes it
[1:27:36] three of deliverance hallelujah I
[1:27:39] believe that church let's go on here a
[1:27:41] little further amen the other thing that
[1:27:43] we find there in Scripture this
[1:27:45] condition of the Exodus a man the king
[1:27:47] one of the Hebrew midwives to kill all
[1:27:50] the male children but because they fear
[1:27:52] God more than they fear the King or the
[1:27:55] words of the king they're loud the male
[1:27:57] children to leave I mean to live and
[1:27:59] because they did that because they honor
[1:28:01] God then God bless them and I want to
[1:28:04] tell you something if you honor God
[1:28:05] today God will bless you in the midst of
[1:28:07] your trial I regardless if you honor God
[1:28:11] God will bless you I love this Satan
[1:28:15] tried to stop Moses but God used the
[1:28:18] same place of destruction for the little
[1:28:20] babies because it was a river right God
[1:28:22] used the same place of destruction for
[1:28:24] the little babies to become the place of
[1:28:26] deliverance for Moses right amen the
[1:28:29] same river where Satan was trying to
[1:28:31] kill him God use that same river amen to
[1:28:34] bring him into Pharaoh's Palace
[1:28:37] hallelujah God know how to turn things
[1:28:40] around on the devil the same plane said
[1:28:43] that's that Saints say I'm gonna pick
[1:28:45] him up right here God say no I'm gonna
[1:28:47] take him to right here Saints not Moses
[1:28:55] but God use the same place of
[1:28:57] destruction for the little babies to
[1:28:59] become the delivers for Moses and the
[1:29:01] tune of Israel the devil Clinton stopped
[1:29:03] Moses the children of Israel did not see
[1:29:07] and I wanted to just kind of bring this
[1:29:09] in here because you know and hear what
[1:29:12] brother Branham was telling us let me
[1:29:13] let me just kind of slow this down
[1:29:15] because he said he made a comment here
[1:29:17] that it was the river go to paragraph 26
[1:29:21] on the power of the devil
[1:29:22] amen look at this he said something
[1:29:24] about this she says how he tried to do
[1:29:26] it and succeeded in Matthew 27 he
[1:29:29] succeeded of doing it but here's what
[1:29:31] what I like Satan can only his minion
[1:29:36] only reigns down to the river
[1:29:39] his Dominion only reigns down to the
[1:29:44] river river means death for separation
[1:29:46] that's all the father Satan that seems
[1:29:50] Dominican come
[1:29:51] it stops within God he can't let me go
[1:29:56] says what beautiful type
[1:29:58] what a beautiful huh to know that
[1:30:00] everything every one of the believers
[1:30:02] when they stand by the grave weeping
[1:30:04] over their children over their loved
[1:30:06] ones Saint can stand rock in the midst
[1:30:08] and look I'm them shadows yonder to a
[1:30:11] God of resurrection from the dead for
[1:30:13] what a picture this beautiful book lays
[1:30:15] out to us here in parables
[1:30:18] teaching us by those things back there
[1:30:21] what's going to do and confirmed every
[1:30:23] word of it in Christ Jesus our Lord the
[1:30:25] perfect Redeemer then he goes on to say
[1:30:28] this he says how that going to the river
[1:30:31] they take the little ones and throw them
[1:30:33] into the river and then notice that's
[1:30:35] the end of Satan's Dominion that's our
[1:30:38] title right there to end the sings
[1:30:40] Dominion that's the end of things
[1:30:42] Dominion is the man canal from that farm
[1:30:44] to the liver and then its power is cut
[1:30:47] off it is that Satan has the power death
[1:30:50] but thanks be to the Living God who has
[1:30:52] a power of Resurrection beyond the
[1:30:54] shadows of death let's go a little
[1:30:56] further what a marvelous thing it is he
[1:30:59] says I want you to look at it study for
[1:31:01] a minute every one of us under the
[1:31:02] remain of Satan here in this world which
[1:31:04] is which is his he walked in the fire
[1:31:07] brimstone before there was a creature on
[1:31:09] it it belongs to him he's a ruler of it
[1:31:11] tonight and every government every
[1:31:13] politic he's a ruler that's the way
[1:31:16] that's have wars and rumors of wars and
[1:31:19] troubles but don't think some glorious
[1:31:21] day it's took Jesus up on the top of the
[1:31:24] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[1:31:26] of the world that's all it was or would
[1:31:29] be that's mine I'll deal with him
[1:31:31] whenever I want to and I'll give
[1:31:33] to you if you'll fall down and worship
[1:31:34] me jesus knew that he was going to fall
[1:31:37] heir to those things anyhow in the
[1:31:39] Millennium so he said get behind me
[1:31:41] Satan it's written thou shalt worship
[1:31:42] the Lord and him only shall help him
[1:31:45] only show you serve so as brother
[1:31:46] Branham just kind of bringing out Satan
[1:31:48] had a limitation you have power but he
[1:31:51] had a limitation and he had to stop at
[1:31:53] the river a man that's where his domain
[1:31:56] stop was at the river and I just wanted
[1:31:59] to count according to Scripture amen we
[1:32:02] see it happening here where Moses was to
[1:32:05] live but you know there come a time and
[1:32:07] Moses life when he was bringing the
[1:32:08] chill of Israel out of Egypt hallelujah
[1:32:11] amen and as he was leaving them out of
[1:32:14] Egypt Pharaoh was very upset that all
[1:32:18] the slaves were fevers a man it not only
[1:32:21] did they leave but they left with a
[1:32:22] wealth of things they had an abundance
[1:32:24] of things as they were leaving they they
[1:32:26] did not leave Egypt for how can I say
[1:32:31] that again they did not leave Egypt for
[1:32:34] and this rapid if they didn't leave
[1:32:37] Egypt for we not gonna leave in the
[1:32:40] rapture for a man that's why I believe I
[1:32:45] see that handle our blessing because the
[1:32:47] more they're flicked the more God
[1:32:49] blesses right so we're not gonna leave
[1:32:53] here poor and I mean when we look at all
[1:32:55] the to the visitor they were I mean the
[1:32:57] children I mean shouldn't mister I said
[1:32:58] we're leaving Egypt Pharaoh was so upset
[1:33:01] with them leaving and if so so
[1:33:03] disappointed could not stop the god of
[1:33:05] Moses and all the plates that were
[1:33:07] dropped down in Egypt at that time even
[1:33:09] to the losing of his firstborn son there
[1:33:12] I was very upset well we met when he
[1:33:14] finally tell mothers two people leave
[1:33:17] Egypt and just get out of here
[1:33:19] well Moses got my people name s
[1:33:21] hallelujah but Pharaoh Amen the devil
[1:33:25] nor to him and
[1:33:26] got upset he say we going back after
[1:33:29] them each I mean I've after lets his
[1:33:30] rights we're bringing them back under
[1:33:32] bondage we should have never let him go
[1:33:34] hallelujah but he got him down to the
[1:33:37] Red Sea when Moses didn't know what to
[1:33:41] do he stretched out his rod in front of
[1:33:44] the Red Sea and God began to partner on
[1:33:46] I'm a partner waters now Moses made a
[1:33:49] statement that God didn't tell him to
[1:33:51] make but Moses said these ships is that
[1:33:53] you have seen today you will see them no
[1:33:55] more forever Moses did not know how God
[1:34:00] was gonna bring that word to pass but he
[1:34:02] spoke it by faith amen and before you
[1:34:07] knew it because the end of Satan's
[1:34:09] Dominion was have to ever remember that
[1:34:13] it was at the river so when they came to
[1:34:15] the Red Sea and Moses in the Chilam
[1:34:18] Israel with evil Red Sea but fairness
[1:34:21] honor came behind him a men to follow
[1:34:24] Moses in the children of Israel no God
[1:34:27] were making away for their foot for the
[1:34:28] armies of Pharaoh God was making away
[1:34:31] for his people and as they fall they got
[1:34:36] crown because that's where Satan's
[1:34:41] Dominion had come to an end and the
[1:34:43] Egyptians they had seen that day they
[1:34:47] were gonna see no more forever
[1:34:50] there's an end to this thing you know
[1:34:54] we're gonna have some trials but
[1:34:55] eventually we gonna be we gonna have no
[1:34:57] more trials right it's got it's gonna
[1:34:59] come to an end and I'm looking forward
[1:35:01] to that a man I put this titular Israel
[1:35:05] did not see the Egyptians anymore after
[1:35:08] their experience at the Red Sea and let
[1:35:11] me tell you something the devil could
[1:35:12] stop Moses when he was born the devil
[1:35:15] could not stop the tiller Israel from
[1:35:17] leaving Egypt and making it to the
[1:35:19] promised land
[1:35:20] amen and the delica stopped him the
[1:35:22] devil could stop Moses the devil also
[1:35:24] can't stop you Oh hallelujah glory to
[1:35:30] God I was looking at this because when
[1:35:32] we look at this scripture in Exodus we
[1:35:35] see a very clear title to the days of
[1:35:38] Jesus because here when when Satan was
[1:35:42] trying to destroy Moses and and he got
[1:35:45] in Pharaoh and said kill all the the
[1:35:47] little ones amen two years old and under
[1:35:49] get them and then kill him and a man
[1:35:51] especially out of little boys make sure
[1:35:52] you get them they did they tried that
[1:35:54] same trick when Jesus was born right
[1:35:58] here Satan got into the leader oh my
[1:36:01] y'all gotta watch these things because
[1:36:03] it's just a political wreath or where
[1:36:04] the pressure might come from
[1:36:07] right it was a political arena in Moses
[1:36:10] day it was a political arena in Jesus
[1:36:12] day in a beautiful little Katrina today
[1:36:15] right but by here here's a here's a good
[1:36:18] thing when when Harriet Amen saw that he
[1:36:21] was tricked by the wise men that they
[1:36:23] met didn't come back and tell him where
[1:36:25] the child was so he could come and
[1:36:26] worship them amen went went went when I
[1:36:28] when when Herod saw that did inherit
[1:36:30] came up with a commandment kill all the
[1:36:33] babies two years old and under
[1:36:36] hallelujah but this is a good part about
[1:36:38] it when it came up with that law Jesus
[1:36:41] was already gone when he came up with
[1:36:45] this plan Jesus was not even in lay in
[1:36:48] the lane and I was feeling as I said
[1:36:51] before the fullness of the tribulation
[1:36:53] sets in the bride will already be come
[1:36:57] before son of must destroy what make
[1:37:01] believer amen was already go and if God
[1:37:04] could watch over a lot like that what
[1:37:07] you think he gonna do for his bride so
[1:37:10] before the pressure get too too
[1:37:12] difficult will already be gone I believe
[1:37:15] that with all of my heart
[1:37:17] amen let's go on here a little further
[1:37:19] amen I'm going to paragraph e 25 in this
[1:37:23] and the power of the devil
[1:37:25] a man Satan's the end of his Dominion is
[1:37:29] at that river it's at that river we
[1:37:32] found it with a man with the children of
[1:37:35] Israel as they were going it meant over
[1:37:37] to the promised land
[1:37:39] then we gypsies ain't saw no more
[1:37:40] because they got drowned in that Red Sea
[1:37:43] hallelujah look at this now glory to God
[1:37:46] he says look at it in the time of Joseph
[1:37:48] when God was making manifest
[1:37:51] son of God Jesus Christ through Joseph
[1:37:54] look how Satan come about the 27th
[1:37:57] chapter a man Genesis Genesis there
[1:38:01] that Satan come to destroy Joseph and
[1:38:04] would have done it but there see the
[1:38:07] very tool that God was going to use he
[1:38:09] says over in chronicles about the 22nd
[1:38:12] chapter the royal seed how he's how he
[1:38:14] tried to destroy that and on over and
[1:38:17] and and matthew the second chapter look
[1:38:20] how quickly that satan was on the job
[1:38:22] when he threw it was about the time for
[1:38:24] the redeemer to be born he got into the
[1:38:27] political leaders and sent forth an
[1:38:30] issue and destroyed all the young
[1:38:31] children from two years old down
[1:38:33] uh-oh down in order to kill the Lord
[1:38:35] Jesus now I was on I was impressed you
[1:38:39] know by by by this when brother Branham
[1:38:41] said over in Chronicles about the 22nd
[1:38:43] chapter and he's talking about how Amen
[1:38:46] the the royal seed they were trying to
[1:38:49] destroy the royal seat so I kind of went
[1:38:51] back over there into the second
[1:38:53] chronicles twitting 22 and and I looked
[1:38:55] at a couple of things that were there
[1:38:57] Amen this particular chapter speaks of a
[1:39:00] man a half's daughter her name is a
[1:39:03] failure amen and for those of you that
[1:39:07] might not know the story what a failure
[1:39:09] did one time was she raised up and she
[1:39:13] she took control of the kingdom this was
[1:39:16] a woman that was not supposed to be
[1:39:17] leave him but she became the leader amen
[1:39:20] at a time because she had all the royal
[1:39:22] seat kill at least she thought she did
[1:39:24] she had all she was trying to kill all
[1:39:27] the lawyers seats so she could actually
[1:39:28] take control of the kingdom and this
[1:39:30] lady reigned for six years a man the
[1:39:34] issue was is that when it when she when
[1:39:36] she put out the heat it to kill all the
[1:39:38] king's sons all the rightful heirs there
[1:39:41] was one person Amen that got the baby
[1:39:43] his name was Joe Ash and then here joash
[1:39:47] away so that she could finally she
[1:39:49] couldn't kill him oh my god I like this
[1:39:51] he was the only one left of the Kings
[1:39:54] seed that can actually take the throne
[1:39:56] he was legally the heir to the throne
[1:39:59] I want you to follow this Amen with me
[1:40:02] amen this morning he was legally the
[1:40:04] heir to the thumb joash happened to be
[1:40:07] Amen the great-grandson of Jehoshaphat
[1:40:11] glory to God now I want you to watch a
[1:40:14] couple things here with me because
[1:40:16] Jehoshaphat he was a righteous King
[1:40:19] remember the Prophet could not even
[1:40:21] prophesy when they came like Shakira
[1:40:25] prophesied he said all these are all
[1:40:26] these other guys coming to try to get me
[1:40:28] to give a word my god he can prophesy
[1:40:31] til he got somebody to start playing
[1:40:33] some anointed music and when they begin
[1:40:36] to play that not to music Guinea got
[1:40:38] into the spirit Issei I wouldn't even do
[1:40:40] this if the AUSA fact wasn't even
[1:40:42] standing here with y'all he had respect
[1:40:44] for Jehoshaphat's
[1:40:46] so here is joash was a a great-grandson
[1:40:50] of Jehoshaphat now some key things
[1:40:53] everyone that's kind of found out here
[1:40:55] I'll tell you tried to kill them all and
[1:40:57] I believe was at the age of seven that
[1:40:59] they finally brought joash out of temple
[1:41:01] and they they they can't let him up on
[1:41:04] the pedestal Nate they begin to anoint
[1:41:05] him as King and when a failure heard
[1:41:08] what was going on she ran into the
[1:41:10] courts and and now there was a by the
[1:41:12] name of Johanna I believe at that time
[1:41:15] and that priest and he had put a plan in
[1:41:17] place that soon as a failure coming
[1:41:19] y'all make sure y'all get her and kill
[1:41:21] her
[1:41:21] not only that but anybody that's
[1:41:23] following her killed them too hallelujah
[1:41:25] and they got rid of a failure out of
[1:41:27] land and it gave this guy so asked the
[1:41:30] opportunity to start raining without a
[1:41:32] man without a failure interfere and I'll
[1:41:34] tell you remember
[1:41:35] what's a half story born of Jezebel
[1:41:39] now watch this God protected a man the
[1:41:44] seed because it was through this lineage
[1:41:46] that Jesus Christ was actually coming Oh
[1:41:49] hallelujah
[1:41:50] but I want you to watch something here
[1:41:52] glory to God look at this a man joash
[1:41:55] was responsible for helping to repair
[1:41:58] the house of God you find that in second
[1:42:01] chronicles 2:24 amen also I want to call
[1:42:05] joy since he was a great grandson of
[1:42:08] Jehoshaphat I want to call him a
[1:42:11] fourth-generation believer now stay with
[1:42:15] me I won't have time to go into all of
[1:42:18] that today but there's a sermon that's
[1:42:20] in my heart where I want to talk about
[1:42:22] things that happen in the fourth
[1:42:23] generation because we're at that time
[1:42:27] again hallelujah
[1:42:29] okay now I'll just share a little bit
[1:42:30] I'm seeing things
[1:42:32] Amen in the fourth generation of
[1:42:36] believers that I don't think I ever seen
[1:42:41] raise the Lord I might as well just say
[1:42:45] these things while I'm here right in my
[1:42:48] generation and man there would have been
[1:42:52] no dancing at my wedding in the
[1:42:56] generation before me no dancing at no
[1:43:00] wedding but in the pro generation I'm
[1:43:02] seeing some stuff I never thought I
[1:43:04] would see in the message see things
[1:43:08] happen in that full generation until God
[1:43:11] likes to fire a can and that's what we
[1:43:15] are expectations for God to light the
[1:43:17] fire again in the four generations this
[1:43:21] man Joe Ashe is a part of the fourth
[1:43:24] generations right stay with me here
[1:43:27] glory to God now see he was I want to
[1:43:30] call fourth generation amen Israelite
[1:43:33] coming from the hosta fact all right
[1:43:35] here's a problem Amen whip whip whip
[1:43:38] whip on joash because when you go back
[1:43:41] and you read it story there in the Book
[1:43:43] of Chronicles
[1:43:44] second chronicles 22 23 24 so on and
[1:43:47] then when you go back to read it you'll
[1:43:49] find out with him being a
[1:43:51] fourth-generation believer oh my god
[1:43:54] what happened is that he only served God
[1:43:57] as long as your Haider was living
[1:44:02] Johanna was the police and he only
[1:44:04] served God as long as so hard of living
[1:44:06] as soon as you're hired
[1:44:09] this man turns idolatry not only turn
[1:44:13] idolatry but the man killed so hiring a
[1:44:15] son for rebuking him I want you to watch
[1:44:19] this I want you to watch this you know I
[1:44:21] told you that that this this man was a
[1:44:24] part of the lineage of Jesus Christ but
[1:44:27] when you go back to you read the
[1:44:28] scripture in Matthew a man chapter 1
[1:44:30] verse 8 you see that his name was out of
[1:44:35] the lineage hallelujah and I'm sure I'm
[1:44:40] sure that you know they said it was
[1:44:41] intentional because he turned the people
[1:44:44] to idol worship even though he was a
[1:44:46] part of it but he turned the people to
[1:44:47] idol worship that they didn't even
[1:44:48] mention his name now he did some good
[1:44:51] things but it was the end that mattered
[1:44:53] most and in the beginning he restored
[1:44:56] the altar he repaired the house of God
[1:44:58] he did a lot of things like that but
[1:45:00] amen in the end he's killing the priest
[1:45:02] son because of man rebuked him watch
[1:45:06] this I picked up here July 2 died he
[1:45:10] turned out after July 2 died Joe has
[1:45:12] turned to idolatry amen also joash ended
[1:45:16] up dying on the sick man after his
[1:45:18] service conspired to kill him and when
[1:45:21] you just start looking at all these
[1:45:22] things that's meant being a part of
[1:45:23] fourth generation I wanna I want a war
[1:45:25] in the fourth generation I want to warn
[1:45:28] the fourth generation the Devils after
[1:45:30] y'all like like none other before
[1:45:32] he's after the fourth generation amen
[1:45:36] and see what I wasn't what I mean by
[1:45:37] that I'm brother Branham would be that
[1:45:39] first generation my parents would have
[1:45:42] been that second generation right and
[1:45:44] they're here I would have been a part of
[1:45:46] that third generation but my kids I'm
[1:45:48] fourth generation and look at what has
[1:45:52] happened in the fourth generation it was
[1:45:55] only when the fourth generation came
[1:45:57] along that people separated from the
[1:45:58] message ah this is this is a spirit that
[1:46:04] has been released in the land to come
[1:46:06] against the fourth generation but God
[1:46:09] wants to light the fire gift I wanna I
[1:46:12] want to show you something here brother
[1:46:14] random told us that you know there was
[1:46:16] Satan after a men joash he was after he
[1:46:20] was after Joseph he was after joash she
[1:46:23] was after moot he was after Jesus that
[1:46:25] same Devils after you but he can only go
[1:46:27] so far and the other thing I want you to
[1:46:30] notice that the devil can't stop you he
[1:46:32] couldn't stop Joey she couldn't stop
[1:46:34] Jesus he couldn't stop Moses he couldn't
[1:46:36] stop the children of Israel the devil
[1:46:38] can't stop you either I don't care if he
[1:46:41] does decide to use the same tricks they
[1:46:44] will not work Oh hallelujah
[1:46:48] they will not he used the same same
[1:46:52] trick on Moses it didn't work he came
[1:46:54] back around his same trick on Jesus it
[1:46:57] didn't work and he's trying to use the
[1:46:59] same trick on you today it will not work
[1:47:04] I love that look at this the profit goes
[1:47:10] on to say this in the pal the devil I'm
[1:47:11] going to paragraph he I think I might
[1:47:15] have already ready he said his Dominion
[1:47:16] only reigns down to the river
[1:47:18] his Dominion only reigns down to the
[1:47:22] river glory to God glory to God I want
[1:47:26] to a man make a little turn a man if I
[1:47:30] can on this thought here today here's
[1:47:33] the million only reigns down to the
[1:47:36] river glory to God I want to turn a
[1:47:42] corner Satan wanted to use the river to
[1:47:48] destroy God's deliverance Moses God's
[1:47:50] deliver Satan want to use the river to
[1:47:53] destroy God's deliver but I want to show
[1:47:56] you in scripture how God uses the river
[1:47:58] to vindicate his delivery
[1:48:04] Satan wanna use the river to destroy
[1:48:07] Gosselaar he want to destroy Moses right
[1:48:10] but God used that same river to bring
[1:48:12] Moses through but it wasn't only at that
[1:48:15] time I want to go to a scripture in Luke
[1:48:17] 7 I'm turning a corner a man Luke
[1:48:21] chapter 7
[1:48:23] thank you Jesus hallelujah and we're
[1:48:27] starting here verse 19 bear with me
[1:48:33] glory to God Satan wanted to use the
[1:48:36] river to destroy God's deliver but God
[1:48:39] uses the river to vindicate his delivery
[1:48:42] hey man look at this
[1:48:44] Luke 7 verse 19 and John calling unto
[1:48:50] his unto him two of his disciples
[1:48:54] sitting them to Jesus saying art thou he
[1:48:56] that should come for look we for another
[1:49:01] now hear what brother branham tells us
[1:49:04] about John being a man a prophet of God
[1:49:07] here John gets to a situation where
[1:49:11] brother Adam says eagle
[1:49:12] I got filmed over a man and what what
[1:49:17] aloud is evil I to get filmed over is
[1:49:19] the trial that he was going through Amen
[1:49:22] that the distress that he was going
[1:49:24] through causes Eagle Eye to become
[1:49:27] filmed over
[1:49:28] now look notice what now he's and he's
[1:49:30] in prison he's calling for the disciples
[1:49:32] disciples have come he's telling the
[1:49:34] disciples now you know this guy Jesus I
[1:49:37] won't try to go following his ministry
[1:49:38] and and try to get an audience with him
[1:49:41] and then ask him art thou he that should
[1:49:43] come or look we for another look at it
[1:49:47] when the men were come unto him they
[1:49:50] said John the Baptist I'm in verse 20
[1:49:53] John the Baptist's have sent us unto
[1:49:55] thee saying art thou he that should come
[1:49:58] or look we for another verse 21 and in
[1:50:02] that same hour he cured many of their
[1:50:05] infirmities and plagues and of evil
[1:50:08] spirits and unto many that were blind he
[1:50:10] gave sight
[1:50:11] look since then Jesus answering a man
[1:50:14] said unto them go your way and tell John
[1:50:17] I never answered their question exactly
[1:50:21] or directly they had to catch up on
[1:50:24] Revelation look then jesus answered
[1:50:26] ascended him go your way and tell John
[1:50:29] what things you have seen and heard how
[1:50:32] that the blind see the lame walk the
[1:50:35] lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the
[1:50:38] data raised to the poor the gospel is
[1:50:41] preached it says and then he leaves a
[1:50:44] statement says blessed is he whosoever
[1:50:47] shall not be offended in me now I want
[1:50:51] to just kind of I wanna I want us to
[1:50:53] kind of meditate on this just for a
[1:50:54] little bit because I said how God Amen I
[1:50:58] say we use the river to try to destroy
[1:51:00] God's deliver but God will use the river
[1:51:02] to vindicate his deliverer now we know
[1:51:04] God did that in the days of Moses when
[1:51:07] when when when they tried to kill all
[1:51:08] the babies they did not get in Moses God
[1:51:11] allowed Moses to make it right down in
[1:51:13] the Pharaohs house and be raised up as a
[1:51:15] deliverer in Pharaoh's house God know
[1:51:18] how to turn the situation around
[1:51:20] right so here what seemed was trying to
[1:51:23] destroy it God was using it to vindicate
[1:51:25] now here in this particular passage of
[1:51:27] Scripture John got to a spot where is
[1:51:30] his his prophetic I got filmed all over
[1:51:33] his prophetic eye a man he would say he
[1:51:36] was kind of looking at things a little a
[1:51:38] lot a little different because of the
[1:51:40] trial that he was in and maybe maybe
[1:51:42] John was thinking to himself I mean if
[1:51:45] he really is the Christ if he really is
[1:51:50] who I thought he was then maybe he would
[1:51:53] get me out of the situation that I'm in
[1:51:55] Oh hallelujah and then maybe he would
[1:51:59] come down and deliver me from this
[1:52:01] prison right but but that was not Jesus
[1:52:04] intention remember John spoke the words
[1:52:06] he must increase and I must decrease
[1:52:10] this was time for trying to go out the
[1:52:12] scene but he didn't think he'd be going
[1:52:14] off like Oh hallelujah and the reason I
[1:52:19] say that God uses derivative indicates
[1:52:22] let's turn back over to John chapter 1
[1:52:25] now over amen John chapter 1 look at
[1:52:28] this a man God uses derivative indicates
[1:52:32] hallelujah John had a question because
[1:52:35] of his trial amen amen amen but to trial
[1:52:40] does not change who your God is
[1:52:43] glory glory glory your trial does not
[1:52:47] change who your God is and the reason I
[1:52:49] say John should not have this question
[1:52:51] because look at John 1 and then verse 26
[1:52:55] it says John answered them saying i
[1:52:57] baptize with water but their standeth
[1:53:01] one among you whom you know not he it is
[1:53:04] who coming after me is preferred before
[1:53:06] me whose shoe lachen i am not worthy to
[1:53:09] unloose these things were done in
[1:53:11] Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was
[1:53:16] baptizing listen the next day John seeth
[1:53:20] Jesus coming up to him and said behold
[1:53:23] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[1:53:25] sin of the world this is he of whom I
[1:53:29] said after me comes a man which is
[1:53:32] before before me for he was before me
[1:53:35] listen and I knew him not but that he
[1:53:39] should be made manifest to Israel
[1:53:41] therefore am i clumb baptized it with
[1:53:44] water john is identifying who jesus is
[1:53:46] son knows by revelation who cheetah says
[1:53:49] verse 32 begins to give us a little
[1:53:51] clearer picture here and john bear
[1:53:53] record saying amen I saw the Spirit
[1:53:56] descended from heaven like a dove and
[1:53:59] then a boat upon him and I knew him not
[1:54:02] but but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:54:05] water the same said unto me upon whom
[1:54:09] thou shalt see the spirit descending and
[1:54:11] remaining on him the same as he which
[1:54:14] baptizeth with the Holy Ghost now when I
[1:54:17] when I thought about that John had this
[1:54:20] experience at the river as a River
[1:54:23] Jordan where he was baptizing God was
[1:54:26] vindicating that Jesus was amen the
[1:54:30] deliverer
[1:54:31] Jesus was the Lamb of God Shawn code the
[1:54:34] revelation at deliver and what he caught
[1:54:38] at the river should have sustained him
[1:54:41] it should have satisfied him but when he
[1:54:45] got in trouble when he got while he's
[1:54:47] beginning to doubt what happened oh I
[1:54:57] like this you know why because you know
[1:54:59] not not only did God Amen identify who
[1:55:02] Christ was John John said it's Saints a
[1:55:06] now the one that he showed me because
[1:55:07] it's a didn't know who he was but it's a
[1:55:09] the one that he told me to say when I
[1:55:11] see the spirit this sin and I am
[1:55:13] remaining and I love this part right
[1:55:16] here I love this part right here verse
[1:55:18] 33 it says I know I'm not but he that
[1:55:21] sent me to baptize with water the same
[1:55:23] said unto me unto whom thou shalt see
[1:55:24] the spirit descending and remaining on
[1:55:27] him the same as he was baptized with the
[1:55:29] Holy Ghost and I just thought on now say
[1:55:31] you know John it was he was very excited
[1:55:34] about being able to baptize the people
[1:55:36] in water but when you going to be
[1:55:39] baptized in water you just going to a
[1:55:41] man hallelujah but John was preaching
[1:55:44] something higher they've been baptized
[1:55:47] in water just a that's coming one Amen
[1:55:50] that can baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:52] in another thing another statement it
[1:55:55] says with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[1:55:58] fire is to burn out everything in your
[1:56:01] life that is not like God we don't want
[1:56:04] to be satisfied just going to a man amen
[1:56:08] to be baptized in water we need Jesus
[1:56:10] Christ the man to baptize with the Holy
[1:56:14] Ghost hair with fire
[1:56:16] Oh glory to God totally satisfied just
[1:56:23] getting to the man get to the man Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ that's when you've accomplished
[1:56:28] something Oh hallelujah
[1:56:30] John is constantly porting themselves so
[1:56:32] when John was going through his trial
[1:56:34] John should have reflected back on this
[1:56:37] particular time because God showed him
[1:56:39] clearly that this was the man when you
[1:56:41] see the Spirit of God amen descending
[1:56:44] and remaining on him you know this is
[1:56:47] the one that you came to introduce but
[1:56:50] John because of the trial begin to to
[1:56:52] take that main name in and begin to lose
[1:56:54] heart got a little faint there's a man
[1:56:56] in it and I just I want to just kind of
[1:56:58] bring this around if I could do you not
[1:57:02] believe this message do you not believe
[1:57:04] because it wasn't only with John that
[1:57:08] God proved that this is my deliverer see
[1:57:13] God also did the same thing with his
[1:57:14] prophet in this hour
[1:57:15] where did he vindicate him at the river
[1:57:19] the Ohio River he vindicated Jesus at
[1:57:27] the Jordan River even John they were
[1:57:29] coming to John John was vindicated and
[1:57:31] the river huh the same way that the
[1:57:34] devil's trying to take the river to take
[1:57:36] people out right God is using the river
[1:57:39] to vindicate but before this this sermon
[1:57:43] is over I'm gonna show you how to devil
[1:57:46] himself will be destroyed at the river
[1:57:55] the end of his domain it happening
[1:57:59] forever glory to God glory to God God
[1:58:03] vindicated moses khan vindicated john
[1:58:05] god vindicated jesus god vindicated
[1:58:08] brother branham hallelujah let me just
[1:58:12] read this out of do you now believe he
[1:58:15] says now if any man be in Christ he be a
[1:58:18] new creature says then God has set in
[1:58:21] the church different things now man can
[1:58:24] testify of anything but until God
[1:58:26] confirms that and says it's so it isn't
[1:58:29] so you got you got a right to disbelieve
[1:58:32] it and time till God vindication see I
[1:58:36] mean you got a right to disbelieve it
[1:58:38] until guns got vindicates that it's the
[1:58:40] truth then you have no more right to
[1:58:43] disbelieve not I like that you got a
[1:58:46] right to disbelieve it if it's not
[1:58:48] vindicated you got a right to walk away
[1:58:51] from it if it's not vindicated but if
[1:58:55] it's vindicated you don't have any more
[1:58:57] likes
[1:58:59] you understand that church you have
[1:59:02] normal right if it's vindicated and yes
[1:59:06] it's been vindicated time and time again
[1:59:08] watch this amen it says once God's been
[1:59:11] the kids at his truth him you have no
[1:59:13] more right to disbelieve God it's that
[1:59:14] right now it was a while some time ago I
[1:59:17] knew nothing about two people when I was
[1:59:19] born this light see you know there was a
[1:59:23] statement and I missed it literally I
[1:59:26] should have said it brother Branham
[1:59:28] hitting on winsome for Friday night in
[1:59:30] the sermon he was saying how there come
[1:59:33] a time where Moses mom and I'm beginning
[1:59:35] to hide him because they knew he was a
[1:59:38] proper child right right and even
[1:59:40] brother batter up said he he said I hope
[1:59:42] you catch it and he just kept going now
[1:59:45] now when when he said that I'm like oh
[1:59:47] my he can identify himself in Scripture
[1:59:49] maybe in maybe in a Baba don't see this
[1:59:52] don't say this but I'm just gonna say
[1:59:53] maybe maybe the way that the parents
[1:59:57] knew that this was a proper child maybe
[1:59:59] at Moses verse something happened in the
[2:00:01] room because when brother Branham was
[2:00:05] born that light came into the room and
[2:00:07] the dog was flying around I mean they
[2:00:09] knew there was something special about
[2:00:11] the South did that happen when you were
[2:00:13] born right God got a way of identifying
[2:00:17] who his person is right amen and all you
[2:00:21] gotta do is just follow the vindication
[2:00:22] gotta take care of rest of it right but
[2:00:25] maybe maybe Moses parents saw something
[2:00:28] special when it's born that's why they
[2:00:30] can identify him as a proper trial
[2:00:33] hallelujah let's go on here the brother
[2:00:36] Branham goes on to say this he says says
[2:00:38] I I knew nothing about you people when I
[2:00:41] was born this light angel Lord which
[2:00:43] they have the picture of it I'm sorry we
[2:00:45] don't have any tonight we haven't had
[2:00:48] them for some time their copyright is so
[2:00:49] tight we have to pay the same price to
[2:00:51] get them that you that you would get
[2:00:54] them usually we just tell you where to
[2:00:56] go get them you can ask at the desk and
[2:00:58] they'll tell you where it's a it's
[2:01:00] copyrighted yonder the American
[2:01:02] photographer Association has it the
[2:01:04] VI the everything all the scientists has
[2:01:07] chased it through the very best we have
[2:01:09] George J Lacey and there's his signed
[2:01:13] statement that it's the first time in
[2:01:16] all the world's history that it could be
[2:01:18] scientifically scientifically proven
[2:01:20] that there was a supernatural being that
[2:01:23] same angel of God that's right here you
[2:01:27] see nightly moving there it is on
[2:01:29] pictures mr. lacy said the mechanical
[2:01:32] eye of this camera

[2:01:37] said the light struck the limbs and it's
[2:01:41] a leaping flaming emerald fire of
[2:01:43] burning many times it comes right into
[2:01:46] the meeting you can see it thousands
[2:01:48] times thousands have seen at a time
[2:01:50] since recently when I was baptizing on
[2:01:54] the river at Jeffersonville when all the
[2:01:56] local newspapers packed it two o'clock
[2:01:59] in the afternoon when I was praying here
[2:02:01] it come right down out of the heavens
[2:02:02] right at two o'clock in the evening June
[2:02:05] or in an afternoon rather and June about
[2:02:08] the middle joon-hyung right over there
[2:02:10] hour and a voice from it saying ask John
[2:02:12] the Baptist what's it to warn the people
[2:02:15] of the first coming of Christ
[2:02:17] so is this message to warn the people of
[2:02:20] the second coming right back up into the
[2:02:24] heavens when the people scream fainted
[2:02:26] what is it gone get in the church ready
[2:02:28] you don't need no new doctrine you don't
[2:02:31] need no new theories you need real true
[2:02:33] hearts to Almighty God to believe on God
[2:02:37] and his son Christ Jesus have fellowship
[2:02:40] with everybody all the Christians by the
[2:02:42] Holy Spirit amen
[2:02:44] on that river when when when the pillar
[2:02:47] fire come down and not just come down
[2:02:49] but spoke y'all know God speaks and he
[2:02:53] spoke and he said as John the Baptist
[2:02:55] for ran the first coming and and and I
[2:02:57] want you to understand something John
[2:02:59] the Baptist did full run that first
[2:03:01] coming and and John the Baptist saw the
[2:03:04] Spirit of God settled on Jesus but when
[2:03:06] he went through his trial he began to
[2:03:08] question whether Jesus was the one or
[2:03:10] should we look for nothing
[2:03:12] y'all know what brother Branham had a
[2:03:15] complex and in it's complex and standing
[2:03:19] in the gap you know he was thinking
[2:03:20] about just you know leaving the field
[2:03:22] going to be a bum and you know and God
[2:03:25] had to kind of show him a little
[2:03:26] something saying I've you if you want to
[2:03:27] be a bum I saw a man in the restaurant
[2:03:29] they say and it's in a sense and it like
[2:03:31] you and his brother here for a Fletcher
[2:03:33] he say he didn't want to look like that
[2:03:35] and he said but he forgot the feeling of
[2:03:38] the people he had lost the feeling of
[2:03:39] people said when he lost the feeling
[2:03:40] other people he said that he began a
[2:03:42] development company said they won't
[2:03:43] listen to anything I got to say Lord so
[2:03:45] he just he said I want to just go to the
[2:03:47] wilderness and when you give me a word I
[2:03:48] go out and say and then I'm coming back
[2:03:50] to the wilderness well brother many when
[2:03:52] he got into that complex that feature
[2:03:53] the Lord met him in the car and began to
[2:03:55] talk to him say he'd say pretty much he
[2:03:57] told them remember how you know say say
[2:04:01] he'd say remember how Moses had a
[2:04:02] complex he'd say also remember let me
[2:04:06] see if I can just find this really quick
[2:04:07] I'm gonna just bring the scene I'm going
[2:04:09] to standing standing in the gap just
[2:04:12] bear with me here
[2:04:14] you got this complex on oh my god a man
[2:04:20] a man a man a man thank you Jesus I
[2:04:24] don't think I might have yes yes
[2:04:27] paragraph 124 standing the gap I want
[2:04:29] you to just kind of catch this because
[2:04:31] here God had to take just like John the
[2:04:33] Baptist had to go back a man maybe to
[2:04:36] the river experience of where God
[2:04:38] vindicated Jesus God had to take brother
[2:04:41] Branham back
[2:04:42] to the Ohio River experience hallelujah
[2:04:45] and I think it's time for God to take
[2:04:47] some other people back so what happened
[2:04:50] at the river oh my god and man we're
[2:04:53] looking at a bridge and we can't see
[2:04:55] because Google doesn't tell us that
[2:04:58] people fell off the bridge we don't
[2:04:59] believe Google no no prophet said they
[2:05:02] fell off they fell off hey man and if
[2:05:05] you say you can't believe a prophet tell
[2:05:07] me something like that then you can't
[2:05:08] believe Genesis you can't believe well I
[2:05:12] just Genesis I put it that way you can't
[2:05:14] believe Genesis you want to know why cuz
[2:05:16] Moses wrote Genesis and Moses was not
[2:05:19] there
[2:05:20] him being a prophet God showed him what
[2:05:22] happened in the Garden of Eden and
[2:05:23] brought it all the way up to Exodus
[2:05:25] Moses was not born until Exodus amen all
[2:05:31] right so you gotta believe you gonna
[2:05:33] believe a prophet believe a prophet all
[2:05:36] right listen
[2:05:37] but here he says this that's that Billy
[2:05:39] he was sound asleep I said Billy was
[2:05:41] that you and he didn't even wake up and
[2:05:44] I thought Lord God I flipped my car down
[2:05:45] what does it mean I said Billy Billy
[2:05:47] said what do you want I said I said
[2:05:48] you're talking to me a wife says and I
[2:05:51] said I want to tell you something I
[2:05:52] dreamed a dream not long ago you
[2:05:53] remember seeing that guy that looked
[2:05:55] like me and fletched
[2:05:56] asked mother when you get back to Tucson
[2:05:58] I told her his told her this dream and
[2:06:00] Billy there's something that's happening
[2:06:02] it's going on now something was talking
[2:06:04] to me I thought it was you he looked at
[2:06:07] me kind of strange and waited a little
[2:06:08] bit we was driving on so a few minutes
[2:06:11] we went back to sleep again and I was
[2:06:13] driving along thinking about what could
[2:06:15] that mean drive along right and right in
[2:06:17] the road and all at once hear them
[2:06:19] talking again and it's that return did
[2:06:23] not I tell you in the beginning to do
[2:06:25] the work of an evangelist when I call
[2:06:27] you down on the river
[2:06:32] not I say as John the Baptist was sent
[2:06:35] to set forth to full run the first
[2:06:37] coming wasn't John more than a prophet
[2:06:39] Jesus says so himself
[2:06:41] what you go out to see a prophet more
[2:06:44] than a prophet so here God had to take
[2:06:48] the Prophet back to his experience on
[2:06:50] the Ohio River to shake him out of his
[2:06:53] conflicts hallelujah see God has to
[2:06:56] vindicate his just like famous trying to
[2:06:58] wipe I'm out at the river God takes it
[2:07:01] to the river to vindicate them there
[2:07:04] hallelujah can't return one more corner
[2:07:07] Amen and I will bring it home today I
[2:07:10] just love I just love this I love this
[2:07:13] Oh glory to God there's a couple
[2:07:17] statements that I want to make and I'm
[2:07:19] gonna read another a couple of quotes in
[2:07:21] scriptures amen brother Branham made a
[2:07:24] statement I won't read this quote he
[2:07:25] just made the statement out of Gabriel's
[2:07:27] instructions the dangers that Satan the
[2:07:28] once possessor because of the fall at
[2:07:31] the garden is bound and cast into the
[2:07:33] lake of fire his days are finished
[2:07:38] another one here let's let's look at
[2:07:41] this in the breech let's read this out
[2:07:44] of the breech between the seven churches
[2:07:45] and seven seals look at this it says
[2:07:48] notice here he comes
[2:07:49] leaves are thrown as an intercessor as a
[2:07:53] slain lamb to become a lion king to
[2:07:57] bring the whole world into judgment
[2:07:58] that's rejected our kinsman redeemer
[2:08:00] then is king over all why he's got the
[2:08:04] title deed of redemption in all lays
[2:08:06] within his hand I'm glad I know him then
[2:08:10] claims his inheritance that's the church
[2:08:12] the pride he claims it what does he do
[2:08:15] then I love this he disposes of his
[2:08:20] contestant see what I mean saying I'll
[2:08:25] come to an end he disposes of his
[2:08:29] contestant Satan he throws him into a
[2:08:33] lake of fire with all those who has
[2:08:36] inspired who was inspired by Satan to
[2:08:38] reject his word of redemption I like
[2:08:42] that he throws him into what I'm so glad
[2:08:53] the scripture calls it a lake of fire
[2:08:56] the same way that devil tried to wipe
[2:09:00] out Moses at a river Amen that same
[2:09:04] devil gonna be wiped out at a lake Oh
[2:09:09] hallelujah hallelujah I love that let's
[2:09:12] read this Amen in Revelation 20
[2:09:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:19] revelation 20 that same devil that tried
[2:09:22] to wipe out Moses way back in Exodus now
[2:09:25] we see his end
[2:09:26] Oh glory to God glory to God glory to
[2:09:30] God here in Revelation 20 starting at
[2:09:32] verse 1 since this says and I saw an
[2:09:38] angel come down from heaven having a key
[2:09:41] of the bottomless pit and a great chain
[2:09:44] in his hand and see that bottomless pit
[2:09:47] is that this these are revelations that
[2:09:50] are thoughts that come from Hell that
[2:09:53] cannot be substantiated by Scripture but
[2:09:56] yet the church is holding on to it right
[2:09:58] the Satan is behind a man the the
[2:10:01] inspiration that comes from the
[2:10:03] bottomless pit so look it says I saw an
[2:10:05] angel come down from heaven have him the
[2:10:08] key of the bottomless pit and a great
[2:10:10] chain in his hand
[2:10:12] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[2:10:15] serpent which is the devil and Satan and
[2:10:18] bound him a thousand years Oh ain't this
[2:10:20] something can you imagine the devil
[2:10:23] being bound
[2:10:25] can you imagine some of the things that
[2:10:27] he is taking you through and look now
[2:10:29] this is not a physical change this is
[2:10:31] what we call a chain of circumstance
[2:10:33] right hey man can you imagine the same
[2:10:35] devil that had you bound now he's in
[2:10:37] bondage I'm telling you this I can't
[2:10:41] wait to see that 1,000 years I mean
[2:10:45] everything you gave me now fall back on
[2:10:47] you 1,000 years of bondage so you can
[2:10:53] see how it feels
[2:10:55] hey man thousand years of bondage look
[2:10:59] at this it says and cast him into the
[2:11:01] bottomless pit and shut him up instead
[2:11:04] of fill up on him that he should deceive
[2:11:06] the nation's No More till the thousand
[2:11:09] years should be fulfilled after that he
[2:11:11] must be loosed a little season listen
[2:11:14] and I saw Thrones and they said upon
[2:11:16] them and judgment was given unto them
[2:11:19] and I saw the souls of them that were
[2:11:21] beheaded for the witness of Jesus and
[2:11:23] for the word of God and which had not
[2:11:25] worshipped the Beast neither His image
[2:11:27] neither had received his mark upon their
[2:11:29] foreheads or in their hands and they
[2:11:31] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
[2:11:33] years it goes on but the rest of the
[2:11:36] Dead lived not again until the thousand
[2:11:38] years were finished this is the first
[2:11:40] resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[2:11:43] hath part in the first resurrection amen
[2:11:46] on such the second death hath no power
[2:11:49] but they shall be priests of God and of
[2:11:52] Christ and shall reign with him a
[2:11:54] thousand years and when the thousand
[2:11:56] years are expired Satan shall be loosed
[2:11:58] out of his prison and she'll go to
[2:12:03] deceive the nation's that were in the
[2:12:05] four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog
[2:12:07] to gather them together to battle a
[2:12:08] number of whom is as the sand of the sea
[2:12:10] and
[2:12:12] and they went up on the breadth of the
[2:12:13] earth and compassed the camp of the
[2:12:15] saints about and the beloved city he
[2:12:17] just won't stop trying hey man amen out

[2:12:23] the saints about end of love city and
[2:12:25] fire came down from God out of heaven
[2:12:29] and devoured them and the devil that
[2:12:33] deceived them was cast into the lake of
[2:12:39] fire oh I love that
[2:12:44] that same devil that try to destroy
[2:12:47] Moses by casting them in the river will
[2:12:51] find his hand in the lake of fire amen
[2:12:57] this is the end of Satan's Dominion
[2:12:59] right it said it's that say that and
[2:13:02] that and the devil that deceived them
[2:13:04] was cast into the lake of fire and
[2:13:06] brimstone where the beast and the false

[2:13:14] eternal health but there is a forever
[2:13:17] and forever we're gonna find the end of
[2:13:21] Satan's Dominion in this lake of fire he
[2:13:24] was trying to use water to destroy but
[2:13:27] he gonna be destroyed in the lake of
[2:13:30] fire
[2:13:32] god no how to turn things around let me
[2:13:37] just finish this by reading this last
[2:13:38] quote out of the revelation of Jesus
[2:13:40] Christ God know how to turn things
[2:13:43] around
[2:13:45] bless it be the name of the Lord
[2:13:48] so let me show you another reason why
[2:13:50] Satan hates this book of the revelation
[2:13:52] of Jesus Christ in the church he knows
[2:13:55] that Jesus Christ is yesterday today and
[2:14:00] forever and he changes not he knows that
[2:14:04] a whole lot more than do 90% of the
[2:14:07] theologians he knows that since God is
[2:14:09] immutable in his nature then he is just
[2:14:12] as immutable in his ways that Satan
[2:14:15] knows assuredly that the original church
[2:14:17] at Pentecost with the power of God
[2:14:19] marked 16 in action is to church that
[2:14:23] Jesus claims as its own all else is
[2:14:26] false it has to be now remember this
[2:14:29] Christ in the true church is a
[2:14:31] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[2:14:34] book of Revelation shows how the
[2:14:36] Antichrist spirit will come into the
[2:14:38] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[2:14:40] for men powerless it exposes Satan
[2:14:44] revealing his works attempted
[2:14:46] destruction of God's people and the
[2:14:48] discrediting of God's Word
[2:14:50] right down to the time he is cast into
[2:14:55] the lake of fire I want to tell you
[2:14:57] something this gonna be a battle until
[2:15:00] he's cast into the lake of fire
[2:15:04] y'all ready to fight there's gonna be a
[2:15:07] battle listen he fights that he cannot
[2:15:11] stand it and he knows that if the people
[2:15:14] get the true revelation of the true
[2:15:16] church and what she is what she's danced
[2:15:20] for and that she can do the greater
[2:15:23] works she will be an invincible army if
[2:15:26] they get a true revelation of the two
[2:15:29] spirits within the framework of the
[2:15:32] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[2:15:35] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[2:15:38] spirit you understand that's what we're
[2:15:41] doing amen it's only two spirits that
[2:15:44] work what is the Spirit of God when it's
[2:15:46] the spirit of the devil and we got a
[2:15:49] list and the Antichrist spirit amen
[2:15:55] listen so what's an antichrist spirit
[2:15:58] Satan will be powerless before her he
[2:16:01] will be as definitely Florida today as
[2:16:04] when Christ was stood him withstood as
[2:16:07] every effort to gain power him in the
[2:16:08] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[2:16:12] love it we're true revelation in our
[2:16:15] lives
[2:16:15] ain't this something with true
[2:16:17] revelation in our lives the gates of
[2:16:20] Hell cannot prevail against us but we
[2:16:25] will prevail over them now you know
[2:16:27] brother Rams brother Brandon brought out
[2:16:29] that scripture about the case of a ICC
[2:16:31] say it didn't say the gates of Hell
[2:16:33] wouldn't come against us
[2:16:35] but it did say it won't prevail and what
[2:16:39] they'll prevail means is to wrestle with
[2:16:43] and overcome
[2:16:48] hallelujah Church I'm telling I'm
[2:16:51] showing you the end of Satan's Dominion
[2:16:54] and I tell you you know when you look at
[2:16:56] you look at these things in Scripture

[2:19:23] Church thank God for victory man let's
[2:19:30] bow in a word of Prayer
[2:19:32] father God we just stepped whew Lord for
[2:19:35] your word and Lord just how your prophet
[2:19:38] just kind of brought these things to our
[2:19:39] attention when he preached the sermon
[2:19:41] that how the devil and just showing God
[2:19:43] how how he was always at work always
[2:19:47] trying to do something to Lord just
[2:19:51] destroy the seed anything that you set
[2:19:54] your heart on the devil was right there
[2:19:56] to try to destroy and against the
[2:19:58] question would be how do we know that
[2:20:00] you set your heart on it
[2:20:01] I think the answer is found in what we
[2:20:04] heard last week about Joe there was a
[2:20:06] discussion in heaven and that discussion
[2:20:09] you begin to ask and Lord just come you
[2:20:13] begin to speak with the the scripture
[2:20:16] say the sons of God which were the
[2:20:17] angels but as Satan was passing through
[2:20:19] you Aksum have you considered Jove
[2:20:21] a man my faithful servant have you
[2:20:24] considered him and so yeah but you got
[2:20:26] this big hedge and I guarantee if you
[2:20:28] take their heads from around them he'll
[2:20:29] curse you
[2:20:30] and oh god he told him you can do it but
[2:20:33] you gave him a boundary that he could
[2:20:34] not touch Joe's life and God if Satan
[2:20:39] had a boundary with job that he also has
[2:20:41] a boundary with us and there's nothing
[2:20:44] he can do no more than what you allow
[2:20:47] him to do so in the midst of whatever
[2:20:49] he's doing help us to keep our eyes on
[2:20:50] you to realize that he did not stop amen
