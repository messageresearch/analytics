about just everything that has gone on during the week this morning let's lay that aside let's tell the Lord to forgive me let's enter in those gates with Thanksgiving in our hearts is that right let's not let the devil sit on a service now I'm I'm not brother Jack but I'm brother smiling I believe y'all let the devil sit on the service this morning you just didn't feel like Spirit a true Tabernacle this morning come on somebody if you can't say man say ouch but it's it's the truth anyhow I try to be nice but sometimes boy I hate that amen when we get robbed out of service you get out of it what you put in and if you don't come to put nothing in it don't expect to get nothing out of it is that right we come to give God praise this morning you know I know I like to mind my own business but right now this morning I got the microphone and y'all know I ain't scared but I just feel like you know what brother Jack correct me if I'm wrong when you get back but I just feel like we let the devil sit on this one now now let's let's get in the spirit of of hearing the word of God cause we show what's in the spirit of worship this morning glory to God that that'll be all musicians amen I tried not to say that but let's get our Bibles out this morning I'm Gonna Change I don't want nobody to get mad at me and sit this morning but it's it's the truth in the house if it's the truth it's the truth and then I I know we could do a better job in getting the spirit we can't just leave it all up to brother Solomon to pull and pry and all of that you you got to put something in it amen right amen we we try to sometimes we we talk about other folk but other folks know how to come to church and give you the spirit to create an atmosphere is that right where they could shout and dance and and all of that amen you know somebody said take the Shockers off my feet so I can dance the god need to take some shackles off some feet so we can dance I don't know about y'all but uh I've been talking to the Lord about me it's like Lord I want to be able to express myself the way that I used to amen glory to God cause I know I know of late I'll be saying man it's it's like something just trying to hold me but I'm determined not to let the devil hold me is that right I want to come in and sing praises and and worship and if a shout come on make up be what might look crazy but let's look at First Kings chapter uh 19 this morning but I appreciate the Lord I appreciate the prayers I appreciate the brothers I sent out a prayer uh the other other night my my daughter-in-law she was uh in the process of giving birth and and the devil was trying to get busy but uh I said boy I one thing I know we got some praying Brothers on on WhatsApp I well I need emergency prayer right now I heard style hearing ping ping got you ping ping got you amen when they get to praying I believe God get the moving right brother Solomon think brother Solomon was the first one jumped on I said it ain't no sense to me getting nervous I gotta stay composed and her parents they the dad was nervous boy he would tore up well I thought he was gonna break down I say that hey all of us can't break down somebody got to stand strong and the mama she was tore up and and I said Mom it's gonna be all right is that's the kind of confidence you just got to have that'll be my context this morning you just got to have confidence in God that he's able and uh they were I was there all day my son called me four o'clock in the morning I'm sleeping I'm like but I never turned on and you know I got kids and parents and sisters I never turned my phone off and I just said come on back come out like what it was my phone Dad and he don't call me Harley that that we we only went to the hospital China in labor all right gone all gone on ain't nothing I can do but don't know but I'm glad you called me I'll be praying I went back to bed and uh went to work but I was a little bit uneasy and I called my wife and she wasn't able to make it and her pants wasn't there and about 9 30 I said I can't take it I I in my heart I was like this is my first grandbaby and I wanted to be there and I say this is this is you know my son and his wife and they needed a parent there it remember one they needed one and I said if it's only going to be one I'm gonna be that one I call my bosses and say I'm out of here my daughter-in-law get ready to have a baby and uh so I left work and I went to the hospital and she was all day in pain I tell you that that was kind of got tough for me about eight o'clock I said I'm gonna have to go in the weight room I was in the room with her I said man I'd have had my kids is over with boy this is y'all let me know when when the time has come I come back in I sit it in green but by the time me and her parents got in the doctor was talking to him about C-section and I was like okay when you get ready to finish talking I was like let's have some prayer let's let's call on him so we had a little prayer and uh the doctor came out she said I really like that that was that was wonderful so it was like I wouldn't fit to let her go in there without no prayer hey man we need we needed God so so let's remember brother Jack and brother kwaku and uh the Saints is not here this morning I'm starting to feel better but I won't apologize for what I said let's let's because I'm quite sure brother Jack when he see it he gonna be like whoa what's going on amen uh First Kings chapter 19. and it says in eight and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all and how he had slain all the uh prophets with the sword then Jezebel sent the messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of the of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he he arose and went uh for his life and came to birth Sheba which belonged to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is it is enough now oh Lord take away my life for I'm not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he took and behold there was a cape bacon on the coals in a cruise of water at his uh head he did eat and drink and laid him down again the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that cake 40 days and 40 nights until her of the Mount of God and he came there into a cave in lodged then behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what doeth thou hear Elijah amen may the Lord add a blessing to his word let's bow before the Lord gracious father we just thank you and we praise you oh God this morning we just want to get out of the way father God we realize that we're just an instrument this morning we just hear the Lord Express something that we trust that'll help further our experience in Jesus Christ this morning just want to remember the pastor in the family this morning my my kids uh leaving the hospital today with the baby just be an arm of protection About Him Father and uh we just appreciate you Lord for bringing them through this ordeal oh God and uh we appreciate you Lord for all things we ask that you just bless us in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen amen we'd just like to use as a little topic this morning uh don't run don't hide don't run don't hide amen now uh this morning as we get started also I just like to say how much we appreciate it um God I'm drawing a blank y'all help me Quentin Junior out of the night I I was I was online and uh this this morning this morning on the way to church I had to revisit the sermon again and I was saying to myself man boy in the next year that young man gonna be a Powerhouse just that just the information and the things that he was dropping like I know that fella knew that much that got loaded he he not like me and brother Jack and Troy we you know we kick and scream and break dance and all kinds of stuff when we up here he's standing in one spot and he just delivered so uh my hat's off to you we we're constantly praying for you him and him and brother Jerry uh I I enjoy I enjoy their style you know I'm not intellectual like that but uh they they call it students and stuff you know I I have a zero degree but uh I thank God for our understanding of the of the word of God this morning uh we we just like to just take an account of of the Prophet Elijah I think it'll be good for our background this morning uh and and I think we we want to try to just show us something because I think as Christians we we rely on on things that's not really reliable when we're when we're faced with with challenges when when we look at Elijah's resume real uh powerful resume of the things that uh he was able to do by the inspiration and I think that's key uh but but we're gonna go somewhere this morning y'all all right by inspiration looking at his resume the things that he were able to accomplish things that you know man you know especially back in those days it's a little bit different now but especially back in those days you couldn't just approach a king in any kind of way back in those days that your head would have dropped but but to walk up to walk up to a man of authority and position and and power like like a king I mean the words of a king man they were were over the top if if he said Off With His Head Off With His Head we could look back at scripture and and see during the days of Daniel and things of that nature when he made a decree he couldn't change his mind about it it's just something that had to be implemented is that right and so for for just a man that would come out of no way with the word of the Lord and speak it's not going to rain until I call for it that's that's that that's powerful right to want to walk up to a king of a Nation with with all of the authority that he holds and and just really Express real like my brother was saying real true Authority right because you know Elijah was the mouthpiece of God yes sir is that right he wasn't speaking of himself and for himself because God says you know I ain't gonna do nothing except I first according to the Book of Amos reveal it through my service the prophets that's just God's provided way is that right amen and so Elijah spoke a word and and just everything started to drying up is that right this this was just on on his his resume glory to God then then he comes back you know to Mount Carmel now now that's quotes uh on these but I'm just gonna talk about it right I'm gonna talk about it because I gotta leave some things you know I may read like I said last week I may read and I may not but I already know what's what's on my computer okay uh sometimes I like to get in the flow and let the flow flow so tired you know it's just the way that I'm built now in 30 years I've preached all all manners so so uh all of the things and all of the ways that I see preachers preach I'm familiar with in 30 years we've went those routes okay but when we when we look at his resume just tremendous just had great great Revival right but brother brother Brandon makes a a tremendous statement and just teaching though on this this scripture and just really really shows us something about spiritual people right uh you know spiritual people and and for Spiritual people you you kind of have to uh be careful a little bit right because you you go up to into these these atmospheres and in these places I I thank God in my Ministry that that I don't get up to where the Prophet went right because he often would say how those things would break down a body and and preachers knowing singers know even with with our our little gifts and different things man after you get done boy you just want to find a child somewhere and sit down after after because it's it's like being under that anointing uh for one hour and 15 minutes it's like working eight hour a day right you you be gassed especially especially when you preach like us with you know your hands moving your feet moving and everything moving and thank God you know if this was brother Diggs he'd be jogging back and forth and kicking and jumping and whoa and and all of that I I just could imagine especially as you start getting older you know uh it starts to take a toll on your body you know you you watch older ministers right back in the day folks used to preach two-hour sermons they start cutting them things down just a little bit you know when I was when I was in Georgia a couple of weeks ago they was talking about uh preaching preaching the two three hour message I was like not brother smiley I'm feeling especially it was the second service two of the day I'm like well I'm gonna give y'all this quick 45 minutes and I'll be ready to head to the airport you're not fit to kill me hey man cause it's it's tiring on the body but we we find you know the profit and just a great great amen move of God inspired by God right where where uh in the 18th chapter first king we found his experience on on Mount Carmel and faced with a challenge right he was in he was in a contest and and it is something that we got to keep in mind you know as we we we live our our daily lives we're in a constant amen contest it's it's it's a constant battle right and wrong good and evil a contrast right we we always got to keep that in mind we're in a constant contest right amen we we because sometimes I we we we we get carnal and Earthly and we do forget I forget I'm human I'm gonna touch on that a little bit see it's it's one thing to be anointed it's one thing to be expressing the thoughts of God by a gift of God but it's another thing when you're not inspired when when when you when you're not when you're not in in those realms amen that's something totally different and see everybody everybody wants this somehow be you know be anointed and appointed right everybody some you know you because you you look we we're looking from the outside in and those things look you know uh uh great you know makes it makes it seem like this person is important but but you know just like uh uh uh Elijah was saying he says you know what bro I'm a man just like everybody else right he he realized after the Inspira here's the thing right amen after after the Mount Carmel Showdown and he had destroyed all of the Prophet prophets of Bell now y'all go back and read it right I'm just going to talk about it after he had to destroyed all of the prophets of Baal right had to had to laugh that at the the prophets of bell and then God comes down and and burns up his sacrifice then he raises up and say get these guys and took them fellas out right but that was all done by inspiration of God right the only way that those things could really be accomplished amen it had to be God we still moving this morning right but then but then after The Showdown then Ahab runs to Jezebel what a sight what a sight it just really shows you the weakness of Flesh the the weakness of of a man I ain't gonna go there I ain't gonna meddle this morning where he runs to us he runs to his wife amen after being defeated oh Lord we could preach that right now right and then but then it also it also showed what kind of a anointing that was on her right now that anointing is still here in the Earth today right on so many levels that's that's not just break it down to you know you could have a spirit but that Spirit it it runs it runs on so many levels right glory to God and and watch this to the inspiration was off of the Prophet Elijah here comes the threat that's just how the devil works when you're feeling good in church and when you're having a wonderful time right when when all that is off then he comes to threat right Jezebel says Listen by this time tomorrow boy I'm taking you out right no no just just think let's think about something here go a man that was just being inspired by God great Revival getting great results great moves of God but that wasn't it right that wasn't it it shows us it shows us something because here comes the threat right and and a threat is a statement of intention right to injure or damage or other hostile actions on someone here comes here comes the threat right and and from from the threat comes fear fear right to and let's think about it to him but it shows us something right I believe God allows things to happen for for our benefit as as teachable moments come on church and we do we need we we need teachable moments right God God allows things to happen in our life on a consistent basis for teachable moments is that right so so it teaches us something and then it gives us something that that we can relate come on Church come on Church see it is every every moment is beneficial whether you like it or not you know the Bible says in the book of Roma all things work together come on priest with somebody it might not be good but God will make it work out for the for the betterment to fulfill his purpose everything may not make you happy everything may not be joyful but everything has a teachable moment amen you might feel like man your world is falling apart amen from the threat amen after coming out of this this this inspiration and he just kind of caught between you know it's two rims if you go back to what brother Brown teaches right and and here she makes a threat now there's no inspiration right now you got this you gotta stand as a man come on that's right because look at this right he said boy look I boy I feel anointed you ever been there hey you know I'm I'm I feel anointed right now but but once I pass this mic off and that anointing settles down then I gotta operate as a man with no inspiration no no anointing on me is that right right right now I feel like I could go through that wall and it'll open up now that's just a feeling because he ain't told me so I ain't Finna Try I just say I feel you know when preachers get up here and they be bucking and feel like they could tap something they be talking big but they're inspired that their anointing a gift is operating and and and you know we talk real big come on devil y'all know what we talking about and y'all be amen preacher go ahead on with your bad self and we be spinning around in high five in and jerking and jumping and and he's anointed and you will anointed too and you feel it good cause you're looking at one another and everything else is that right but but then you know what um that there comes a time when that anointing starts setting especially after you and got you some chicken come on man that you got some collard greens and black eyed peas and well I feel good now some macaroni and cheese and everything and you you start you start forgetting even what the preacher preached because somebody come and ask you out I had to pass the preach well uh well uh you know you in between you know Realms and let me go back let me let me go get my tablet and I'm a living witness of that and I'm a preach but don't ask me what I preached 20 minutes after I done quit coming I have to go back to the tape and whatever right because then then we start getting back down to humanity and and we have to operate right we we got to learn to operate even when we're not inspired under these types of Inspirations we we steal like my brother was talking about that that Authority you know one one thing about Jesus uh and our inspiration this morning is confidence and knowing one thing about Jesus that made him different than us right even though you know we In the Flesh and we bypass our theophanese to come here to be in this contest but he came a man in a creative body he but he was in a contest but but amen his confidence was was in in knowing right but then with all of this this this these revivals that Elijah when when the threat came he took all right he took he took off he took off running and we we see it in different places in scripture where where men didn't really have a clear-cut understanding of who they were the promises that were given come on Church look at look at um for instance you know I was thinking about uh uh the battle that David had with Goliath and you know uh all things you know things are predestinated by God right it wasn't just by chance that uh uh uh David's father sent them to the battle to give it you know the brothers the little Villas or whatever might be to see what's going on in the battle I believe that that that was orchestrated by God to bring the promise into fruition because David was anointed right right David was anointed by the prophet David was you know on the back side of the desert having experiences is that right glory to God Amen but but that David during that time when David came out and they was like wait a minute wait a minute this man ain't even circumcised what y'all scared about huh look at look at the confidence that David had when when he came to the battle David didn't come to the battle it was just some Ruddy little boy David was anointed as king and I and I believe that that was that that anointing was just kind of you know resting and resonating on David is that right that has some real experiences because you know I don't think let me tell y'all something this week has been a crazy week for me I've been working on a little job by my house on the side and band the other day this lady this lady opened the door and these big old dog Come Running Out Boy my eyes got bit and boy I ran and jumped the car let up the window look at that little woman and she come here always I like and you yeah that's all you got don't you see me running scared you ain't putting nothing into it she did that all day I'm like this woman got to be crazy now I do something to your dogs you gonna be mad at me and then then yesterday church I'm gonna tell y'all something I pulls up I pulls up on the property and these two deer was out there now normally they'll see humans and they PM but I think these used to be pets because that used that property used to belong to a lady who who raised animals it used to be a place kids go out they should have tigers all kind of stuff out there brother cable assistant on top of my and I could tell one of the uh the deer had a little collar around his neck and I'm like but bro smiley don't do deal like that bro smiley do deer in Greece brother Smiley dude Greece brother I didn't do lie I did like that and they ran and then next thing I know soon as I started getting out my car they was coming to me I'm like well I don't know what to do this this out of my wheelhouse and every time I would come out the door they start coming to me I'm like this is odd but it just shows you as as a human being with no ex real experience with animals man that was a element of fear I'm gonna be honest with you I ran and I don't do too much running right but I still know I could I got a little something in me when I gotta go I gotta go Feet Don't Fail Me Now y'all know what I'm talking about be right here limping and everything unless something get behind you you out of there I'm out of here you get to talking to the Lord right but amen but you know that that those things was just an introduction for David for the for the world to see what was on them but that but there was a confidence that that he had that you know a man that was Head and Shoulders above all the rest his brother and were were great warriors they were they was run off and they were hiding and instead of them instead of them uh uh approaching the threat right amen there was an element of fear right and fear is an unpleasant and often strong emotion caused by expectations or an awareness of danger right some something happens it's it's a human a human emotion that that we as human beings we have is is a fight or flight normally we fight unless we pushed into a corner then we fight and flight we fight on our way out is that right especially if somebody get two or three good was on you I still remember this day I tell this story every night then we had a good friend of mine used to live up the street from us and I had a neighbor across the street from me her name was Annette now I had some tough sisters in my neighborhood boy could get down and I don't know what he did to end that and I said Mama get you when you get off that bus when he got off the bus and that hit him with a two-piece all you see was feet behind him but he was too fast it was it was more flight than fight right but but but fear fear fear did that we still moved to church how much time I got fear fear fear did that is that right and so at the threat at the threat of of his of losing his life right now watch watch this we talked we're talking about a servant of God right a servant of God not just a prophet of God with with the the the words of God on his lips sir right but at the threat all of that went out the window right why because at that at that and it shows us something that that these things you just can't rely upon come on Church somebody say Amen you just can't rely upon your gifts right because see I ain't always preaching come on church amen most of the time I'm living as a man I'm I'm living as a a human being I'm in a contest right right not not preaching and not just anointed but but I'm in a contest I'm more than a man but I'm a man that I hope that didn't go over your head but but it's it's it's what I understand about who I am as a man that felt good come on say that again see amen I'm in a contest every day you're in a contest every day Good and Evil see young people and adults we all we are all in a contest every day 24 hours a day is that right we had a contest between what's right and what's wrong right and and it's it's it's a cause it's a constant threat to to our spirituality right it's just so so many levels the the the the threat amen that we're under it just covers man so much is that right amen and and with the threat is to bring harm right it's it's to do is to do damage and that's on a consistent basis right one thing about the Devil he's he ain't he ain't God as far as Hebrews 13 and 8 but he don't change he he don't change his Tactics come on he's consistent when we're not consistent somebody ought to say man the devil consistently on a consistent basis fights us he don't get tired look at look at the look at amen God servant he was tired he was worn out he look watch what he said boy this is enough you ever said that water I'm exhausted I don't had enough this thing is overwhelming I you know I don't know what to do I don't know come on church if you got children you'd have said that two or three times if you got a wife you done said that if you don't got a husband you didn't said that if you got a boss man you didn't see it Dad well maybe y'all ain't in no battles then cause I can't get y'all to praise him with me this morning huh but I'm a living witness I've had enough as a servant of God I've gotten to the point I had enough give me the White Flag I'm waving it come on I can't go no more next thing you know the prophet think about this now because because we we look at these gifts and everything and why we covet we want to be great man and God and we you know sometimes you know you don't even know what you're getting into I can't really say that I ever wanted to preach huh all I wanted to do when I started singing well I sang for for the glory of God God said no I got something else for you to do with your little singing that's going to be a secondary gift I give you but I got some I don't want it don't want it don't want to preach and then when I got a prophecy after my third message of being a pastor so I definitely don't want that and I still never forget sister Judy sister Judy came up to me one day she say brother I'm gonna say something to you that was the pastor wife at the time so you know I had to be respectful and she said it's like you running from something I am I was honest I am don't want that I want you know because the evangelists they get all the glory they come in and shake the place up and everybody want to go home with the evangelists come on Amen they spin around and kicking everybody hey man but the pastor got to deal with y'all every week he got to preach and say hard things and stand at the door and Shake Your Hand God bless you while you doing this God bless you brother well praise the Lord too God bless you yeah are you real quick or if you can bypass him you know you'll get out of line and step and going on he saw that he'll get you the next time but you you you we we want to covet things that that we don't really know the the foot let me tell you something man you got to be crazy to want to be a pastor I'm telling you you see why you say that look let's look around us we got different people different age groups different ethnic backgrounds I mean we we got a little bit of everything Rich folk po folk y'all say Rich folk where the head did the hood folks poet folks you know whatever you prophesying come on I receive it in the name of Jesus huh come on don't be a scared to receive something nah reach up and grab it the song Say come on glory to God well I ain't never too old to spend God's money right amen but but you know you you just kind of got to understand what goes along with it it ain't an easy job that's why you always got to pray for brother Jack trying to trying to keep a balance trying to work with the Young Generation the middle age generation new couples older couples trouble couples his own family yeah I mean it's just a lot that go new people and trying to amen Express Jesus Christ and bring them into a further knowledge I mean it's a lot that goes along with with the office of being a pastor right I mean like I was saying last week you know Sunday Sunday mornings is the time where you get your shout on and everything else but you know Wednesday bro Jake don't play on Wednesday like brother Westco say he get down to where the rubber meets the road at he like he say he he might come out with uh uh uh what's that thing he do in the first he first started on Sunday morning I mean Wednesday mornings his uh his quotes that huh his key statements but after he finished them key statements it's only popping from there sometimes I'll be sitting in the back corner be like oh boy thank you Jesus Hallelujah yeah that was me Lord right because I got to stay on tags I have to kind of tell Joseph to keep y'all with me because yeah y'all are loose y'all go downhill on me quick right you start getting intent but but you know it just shows you that it's you know as the way that I look at you can't rely upon these gifts because gifts and callers without repentance you can operate it in gifts and and do all kinds of crazy things outside of church right you heard of God the prophet tells a story about two men gifted genuine Holy Ghost give one man prophesied and the next man interprets the prophecy to the to the letter but but by our gift he was able to shake one man's hand say oh that's a general genuine believer the other man he said oh oh and then by a gift of discernment amen he said oh that man got one wife over in the family he got another woman over here oh how'd that work then he had to get a scripture the rain falls under just as well as the unjust right even though he's unjust the rain falls on him a gift kicks in right because because gifts in the body if God that's in church well it's a body move if God wanted to speak a man through somebody somebody could get anointed this morning but it'll be God that'll speak in tongue and another man can interpret and and then and here's the thing it don't really make you much of anything because you might not do that ever again in your Christian Life amen come on well I'm a prophetess and I'm a prophet no God just used you Amen in a service or in a meeting amen because you're part of the body right not that it's not Prophet this is a prophet that's not what I'm saying but it's not something you don't want to promote yourself amen because you could get yourself in a whole lot of trouble it's no self-promoting uh uh it's because West West what kind of gift you got was predestinated right you you can't you can't make yourself something you can't make yourself a prophet you you was born before you was ever even according to Jeremiah right God I don't know Dame for him to be that if you're a pastor you were ordained the ability and everything if you're in evangelist well I'm a teacher I'm gonna just sit back and watch I'ma listen to you I'ma see how you handle the Bible but you ain't no teacher I'm sorry sometimes you just have to tell folk now you ain't no teacher you you might be have a gift but it ain't a teaching gift is that right because of the way the way that you handle scripture you had that thing all tied up wrong it's like a baby could tie that thing up bed and you just did come on Church but but let's let's look at Elijah when the inspiration amen felt uh uh uh was off of him as as a man he found himself a man running from the threat a man of of a group of people that he had already a man uh had the victory over he had already spoken right and then it just shows you it shows you as a human how how you know we can get weak our eagle eyes could get filmed over come on preach with me somebody ain't done yet right after all of that the threat of a woman then he failed to realize where was his confidence where where is his confidence see one thing I like about God as long as God is using you there's nothing can happen to you right glory to God as long as there's a work for you to do let me tell you something Church you know growing up in the streets and everything man I don't know how many times I almost overdosed on drugs and the fights and being shot by and all of that God hadn't even started to Quicken me yet so no matter what the devil was trying to do it couldn't happen right because of what was in the mind of God before I even knew let me tell you something before me and brother Jack ever started preaching the devil tried to take us out in a car accident brother Jack had got this nice back in the day red barelo that thing was nice we're on our way to church one Friday night and uh you know because I ain't have a car back then I just got saved and brother Troy says Italian them they were my rides they were my first they were my first rides brother Troy and sister Tanya she was pregnant with Josh then me and Jack became buddies we ride we listening to a message and we just talking like we always did I like Jake where you going shortcut shortcut I've been living in Palm Beach County a lot longer than you where are you going are we going down the street and this old raggedy car coming down the street I'm like Jack you see it he like yeah I say Jack he ain't stopping brother Jack tried to turn out the way he hit us ah we flipped over and rolled down the street and the amazing thing was he came out with glass on his left I came out with glass on my right hand that was it we jumped out the car and and I was walking around like a zombie like Lord have mercy you know when I got I got out first while he was saying Brothers Molly you all right I was headed out the window I like bro we'll talk later but I'm finna get up out of here today but the blow Jack gotta praise God glory to God the people set him down they crazy no we wasn't crazy amen but God knew what we would beat down the line is that right and and we just kind of been Inseparable whoever sits even when I had the church and he had the church we always said we were we were uh one church and two locations now we just one Church in one location right glory to God Amen I'm just I'm just kind of uh here to try to be a blessing but but it just really shows you what you can and what you cannot rely on let me let me speed it up I got about 20 minutes okay then then all of a sudden man he's he's he's out here and looking and just show but this was in the flesh with no inspiration he he like listen man I'm done I had enough I want to die come on and you see this all the time it's not something that's foreign you see this amongst Ministry you see this you see this in just just on every level right amen but we still going somewhere right uh and I don't know assistant Tina got some quotes but but I'm feeling good I'll just talk about it I like to just talk about what I already know what's on here and y'all go back y'all yeah go back brother Brown tells a story now I don't know I I I'll see how we how we work he tells a story now remember and and what I want to do is show you how contrasting the story that he tells as as a a servant of God versus what we just learned in uh first king 19. we learned the first king 19 here's a man that's gifted but yet when the inspiration leaves he he killed I'm out right knock knock considering not considering God at all right the threat produced a fear right and it's and it's hard to walk in fear and faith at the same time you you can't do it either either you're gonna have faith are you going to be in fear here's the thing about fear the fear torments right the fear the you you don't you you the worst thing you you can do as a individual is live a man in fear right just in this church we have got to live in a position or a place of confidence in knowing who we are in God I got a scripture for you but not yet right brother Brandon he tells this story he tells this story he's he's he's in a meeting right he's he's enemy and and he says this big guy probably a guy about my size right and and you know with my size a lot of people look at me saying I don't think I just wanna I don't just want to jump on him not unless they're a little bit bigger than me or the other day I was in getting me a coffee and a dude came up in there brother came up in there and I was like Lord I don't know what I do I fight him now if I had to but I think all that my feet do the fighting not let God take a hole I'm talking about bad a man and I'm I'm six three and a half 270. this dude he'll look to be by troyed by six seven by 350 pounds of muscle sticking up and he looked young too bro queen I'm like hey Dave I look like a baby upside this fella and no one big most people look at me big man they all know my name they call me Big Man big man they make Caleb looks from all and Caleb a pretty big fellow my little nephew back there Caleb me and you side by side we be like bro All I'm gonna do say Caleb you hit him to go you're a bit a little bit Young but but the prophet of God he was talking about this guy he was a he was he was uh deranged he was an ex escape from uh insane institution right and and so he had already knocked out and broke a preacher's jaw earlier that day just not in my broke his jaw messed up his shoulder and everything else and and I got a quote here what Brother battle said you know what I if he could have he would have ran too he said when the guy started approaching he'd say man all that just shows you something see we we talk when we anointed praise God glory to God Alone so when that crazy dude start coming to the pulpit he said all them preachers ran in head huh and you have to ask the question right where were they in church they're in a meeting where's their confidence and and knowing right because because the same God that delivered Legion was in them well praise the Lord see where where was their spiritual understanding and and those those trying times it wasn't there they weren't inspired right see it it makes a difference when we're inspired we feel like we could do something but but when when that thing ain't on us and we we gotta operate from from this position of humanity and deity because there is a connection come on come on because just as much as we man the fullness of God because all that was in Christ he brought into the church right and and all it is it's a it's another contest right it's another contest that we're faced with right amen but what where's where's our our confidence what what it shows is that often we're we're in a real common Realm come on church I ain't done yet it really and I'm not saying this you know to hurt our feelings because you know I'm a human being too and a lot of times I look at myself in situations and you realize man I'm more carnal than I am spiritual well praise the Lord come on Church see it's it's easy to be super spiritual while we're here under this anointing and in this atmosphere but but you know it we are who we are outside of these doors we we are it shows our level of maturity when we outside these doors our level of understanding of our Authority when we when we're outside of these doors right and and and we're constantly being threatened and what's our response is right I'm out of here come on I'm going on because because how how often how often right but but it's it's the contest but it just shows where we at uh uh in in our maturity don't dis-christianize you is that right it never did nothing to Elijah's gift he was still just as gifted as he was Amen on Mount Carmel is that right because because you know uh like I think Brothers Jack was talking about the week being a prophet they throw the dead man amen on his body brought him back to life it did it didn't change what he was but but it just showed it his Humanity he was lacking something and I and I got a quote on that but he was brother Brown was making a statement in his teaching he said you know Elijah was like man you know from the threat then fear and then Elijah realized something wrong right glory to God when when he should have faced the threat right and and confidence he was out when the prophet was was faced with the threat this man said listen and brother makes a statement he said this guy was big brother Brandon was 128 pounds he said man this man with shoes big hands big arms man knowing watch his testimony he just knocked out a man and you got to realize a demon-possessed man is ten times the average man in strength because he got other folk there y'all don't know man I'm telling you I got I got a cousin like that man when the police come get him it take an army five six seven eight big dudes to get especially when when he got some waiting stuff on him boy but they ain't dealing with one man they did it with 10 15 20 people demon powers glory to God brother I understand just the threat and realizing that this man has the ability to carry out the threat but but he says you know what when the and let's face it the man comes up spits in your face and could you could let's let's think about all of us all of us especially you know it's like the thing about this man didn't imagine not not somebody knock me out man but instead of it's and uh and all your help gone y'all y'all know y'all know my people that child I just call me I'll be there with you child dissing yeah girl and yeah homie homie but when the real pressure come bro wake up huh y'all know out of here right amen but he said you know it's something something in one place he was like you know something wouldn't let him run right something something kept him right in there with all the threatening with all of the testimony of all knowing that man this man hit me this man gonna kill me but he didn't run it hot right he he faced the threat and the man say man you little Weasley little something that's in the quote right you well I'm I'm knocking you out I'm knocking you out huh and you not moving see that show he he wasn't dealing in his Humanity because if he was listen if he was dealing in his Humanity he probably would have fought back because my mom was a boxer right or he'd have been out of there but but I believe there was something in him because when when when the guy when the guy came forward he said before he know it knew it see watch God God is a big God now God we talking about the supernatural he said before he realized before he realized see his mouth was speaking his ears was hearing and he was like what's going on God was the deity the deity that was in him was speaking for him he say oh since you challenged oh y'all ain't hear me since since you challenged the god that's in me you're gonna be prostrate but I said okay I'm gonna show you gonna be prostrate huh see he wasn't just dealing with a man he was dealing with a God man right amen see this is what we got to realize deity we amateur God see we're the the power of redemption we don't fully grasp right right the the the kind of uh power and authority that's been given to us right our problem is when as yielded to God right but we're talking about a man that that was totally yielded to God say when that that guy came up he said you know what he wanted to run but then he watched this watch how powerful this it shows us something it shows us the real Power of Love because so often and I'm guilty of it too you know we we have a tendency of getting in the flesh because because as a man a lot of times we think I know I'm a Christian I know I'm a preacher and sometimes it's like bro you got to push the humanity to to the side because you're not dealing with something natural you're dealing with spirits right and and watch watch inspiration coming on the prophet he started thinking you know what this a man just like me right and he don't really know me as a man he was like that man really don't want to do this to me come on church as as a as a man I said man he don't want to do that kind of stuff to me he he realized it was something that was motivating I'm preaching Church come on now he could have operated in the flesh but he realized watch the revelation of the word start coming down he realized you know what I'm doing because the Bible says we're not dealing with flesh and Blood come on church and we not we not we're not dealing with flesh and blood and you'll never defeat a man principalities and powers in the flesh right he said he really he looked at the man he said he realized man that man don't want to do this to me but he realized a man uh something something had conquered him had overcome him right and was expressing himself through his body but then God come down and God was expressing himself to through a man human lips amen is that right he says he says you know he projected love when When Love is projected then Sovereign Grace takes over yes sir right oh glory to God glory to God he tells the story about the about the the uh the bull the bees it was a projection of of the real truth he said you can't fake it yeah I know how folk he is I love you you can't fake it now it's got to be there in these kind of circumstances it's got to be there it ain't something you know you could just put on and act and everything else he was talking about with the bull right it had to be something that was really genuine something that was really emulate from his heart that was really fat that stopped the bull a killer bull he said boy he looked around he dropped that gate that day going to going to Amen to visit a sick person to pray for him and forgot his gun in the truck like and and he was between the the gate like oh Lord I ain't gonna make it boy if I try to run this bull go kill me right something something Supernatural kicked in the god parts huh man it probably should have kicked in yesterday but it didn't the field park kicked in and I started moving out them their way right sometimes we don't even realize the situations that God allows us to be put in to see to see what our reaction to the action will be yes sir I just said something what's our reaction to the action see his his reaction was and you might think this crazy uh to apologize to uh uh right to to begin to talk Adam did it ain't strange before the fall Adam could speak to Nature right yeah just speak say listen I'm so sorry but I had to pass through here as a sick person I'm so sorry I just serious sleep this that and the other look at that communication right listen church that was more than a man that that board that might sound crazy that but that was more than a man that bull recognized a man it was not just a man that was the creator Veil if it's not it's not then then what are we preaching when we talk about well I got the Holy Ghost what what are you talking about then what is the Holy Ghost to to you a third part of the 20th what are we talking about what have we been preaching to people if the Holy Ghost is God then it's God on human lips right with those bees God veiled his skin operating from a position of authority bees huh amen God's speaking through the lips of a man in the 21st century right and everything came out of that man when he got ready to hit the prophet right amen just he lost everything right because he was dealing with something that was greater than just Humanity we tell my amen the voice of God the Olympic God right with two omnipotence meets something's got the shake come on that's this ain't foreign church I'm gonna go this this ain't firing then then the prophet he brings out of scripture that almost made me shout in my house last night Psalms 46 if you could pull that up Psalms 46 and I thought see listen church we have got to have uh uh a place of rest for our faith right and it can't be shifting Sands of man's Wisdom or anything it's got to be on something you can put a something that's that's solid a place a place where we got an absolute come on church when we don't when we don't feel nothing come on church when we don't feel nothing around us we we gotta absolute right glory to God Amen and and the object was going on listen uh another statement but keep that there for a second if God is for us hey man right then who can be against us where God is blessed is blessing with God has cursed is cursed but if God is for me nothing can be against me right but then he says here God is our refuge right glory to God and strength see watch the sovereignty of God you know in in just the laws and different things how God would set up these these places of Refuge for the children of Israel a place where you could run in when when when you know if you did something accidentally and the focus behind you you could go in as long as you know you know you were accepted and a place where you could find rest right a place where you could find peace from the threat come on from the threat you could come in and you could find rest see a place where you can find peace because look at look at the World Church just just look at society as a whole outside of God you don't know this place see but in God he said he has a refuge and strength from a time gone right I like this next part [Music] not Nada no God is see because you know we we like to pray up and looking up and and all of that and God lives right in here pray to the god that's in you that might sound fun but huh we a little girl Heavenly Father ain't never wrong looking up our kids but pray to the god that's in you if you've got the Holy Ghost God Lives in You he said I'll be a I'm a very present help in a time of trouble just scripture proves that that every every amen the children of God was faced with crisis God was always on the scene give me the next verse a very present help in a time of trouble but I'll tell you what he says therefore that's somebody who was inspired to write therefore will not we fear right now I'm gonna read that again read that again because because we we live in fear I'm gonna pay my bills and how I'ma do this and what's gonna happen here and well just a constant right therefore we're not we fear though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of sea I ain't gonna fear right amen especially boy give me the next verse you know we you we start coming into hurricane season and man boy let him start talking about a hurricane now I believe in being responsible but everybody push a panic button right amen glory to God he's so throw the waters thereof right Roar and be troubled throw the mountains shake with the swellings give me the next one they're a sea lie there is a river in the streams where I shall make glad the cities of God the holy place and the Tabernacles are the most high give me the next one right God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help huh and that right early see we we got to have an absolute we gotta give me the next one we got to have a place where where right though heathens rage the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us right the god of Jacob is our refuge give me the next one is right just really punctuating come behold the work to the Lord what desolation he has made in the earth give me the next one he make his War to cease until the end of the Earth right he'll make that war that's raging in your mind and your life to cease is that right amen he breakth the bow he covet the spirit Sunder glory to God he burns the cherish and fire give me the next one be still don't go running and hide be still and know that I'm God is that right I will be exalted amongst the heathens I will be exalted in the Earth let me tell you something God God just wants to just be exalted in the midst of what we going through in in the midst of the let the musicians come right brother Troy I guess you can make your way up too right amen be still and know that I'm still God right glory to God don't run it don't hide hide face face the face the threat with with a confidence in knowing that he's a very present help in a time of trouble Hallelujah right well I ain't got no money and I got these bills to pay I'm gonna say that again here very present help and a time of trouble see even he is or he's not either he's a provider or he's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a way maker or he's not huh either he is or he's not if he's not then we serve the wrong God Amen but it but if he is a very present help then we stand still and know that he's God and and regardless of the threat I want fear right if I'm gonna be shot in the morning ain't no sense of me worrying about it come on that's right because my worrying won't stop the bullets but my faith in God can stop the bullets come on Hallelujah I'll be talking about it I'll be shiny body you know somebody told the prophet of God he said uh they told him if you don't stop preaching Divine Healing I'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna
