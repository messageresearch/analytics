[0:11] victories and then thank God for them so
[0:15] have we have everybody here tonight well
[0:19] even the Lord to me this year in a
[0:21] special way
[0:23] Psalm 34 says I will bless the Lord at
[0:27] all times his praise shall continually
[0:31] be in my mouth my soul shall make her
[0:34] boast of all the humble shall hear their
[0:36] other be glad and magnify the Lord with
[0:39] me and let us exalt his name together
[0:42] [Music]
[0:45] I saw what we heard you have delivered
[0:48] me from all my fears they looked at the
[0:51] end of the light when their faces with
[0:53] unashamed this poor man cried and the
[0:55] Lord heard him and see come out of all
[0:57] of his face the age of the Lord at
[1:00] campus round about them that fear him
[1:02] and delivered them and taste and see
[1:05] that the Lord is who blessed is the man
[1:06] that trusted a man a man before we will
[1:12] just open up a word of prayer to my
[1:13] order to quickly just mention location
[1:20] I'm going to say a couple of years we've
[1:23] been playing that our church about
[1:25] opportunities for outreach there are
[1:29] some things that we do there the local
[1:31] church to try to reach other people
[1:32] outside those walls and we just been
[1:36] praying and seeking email about just
[1:39] different chances that we might have to
[1:41] just reach out to somebody that might
[1:43] not know Christ and I feel like that's
[1:46] our responsibility
[1:47] as believers Alabama they identified
[1:51] that he was talking on the scripture
[1:53] revelation 15 I believe and there are
[1:55] some people that come up a man sea glass
[1:58] mixed with blood
[2:00] it was comment that the Prophet made he
[2:02] says on this season people that the
[2:05] coming through the tribulation Saints
[2:06] eating that is mine and your thoughts
[2:09] that they did not reach it so you know
[2:12] you see things like that like Lord I'm
[2:14] going to do what I can to try to reach
[2:15] somebody to Christ and we just afraid of
[2:19] a seeking opportunity and this this kind
[2:22] of came up this type a man and we just
[2:24] jumped them and everything we had it's
[2:26] my first time doing this and we just we
[2:29] just expected God to get all the floor
[2:31] and all the honor and I'm so grateful
[2:33] for everybody's coming out but please be
[2:35] a prayer and we came out to the serious

[15:44] I don't thank you to the testimony
[15:47] whatsoever I had to share this because
[15:51] there was Benjamin I'm talking a lot of
[15:55] us not to make him here and yeah a lot
[15:59] of things to to get before we came here
[16:02] from the church
[16:05] traffic's rain yes yes everything was
[16:09] just trying to get in and me brother
[16:12] getting over here we're trying to you
[16:14] know stop ready and head over here we
[16:16] have those speakers we have tonight we
[16:19] have the stands we have pretty much
[16:20] speed that we actually need it so
[16:22] disabled I thought that was attacking us
[16:24] more than his but he's a wingman he made
[16:34] a weight today he something happened
[16:36] there was I believe that we have to be
[16:39] very sensitive to the things that God
[16:40] does to us sometimes we can really
[16:43] easily miss something like as a crash so
[16:46] pay attention
[16:49] we were coming home together we're
[16:52] coming for husband we have to go to his
[16:55] house to get stress and me to my house

[17:40] front of them and I don't know where
[17:43] they're going
[17:43] we gotta get we gotta get there so
[17:45] basically I like just saying I don't
[17:49] know why I was like oh that traffic
[18:10] clearly will get sarcastic so when we
[18:13] get it close there maybe everybody stay
[18:15] with them which one he's getting close
[18:17] so say brother
[18:18] that sure is good we're gonna jump in

[18:37] countries is good I mean we waited for
[18:41] about five months

[18:46] truck is actually going right so I told
[18:50] myself these trucks are here too
[19:00] they're gonna bust you in come back but
[19:05] you gotta speak things into it right so
[19:08] when we pass upon by all the traffic
[19:12] goes away that there's no contract as
[19:15] soon as we pass that line the trucks

[1:18:47] something Lord that'll be encouraging
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ wonderful baby what what we
[1:18:58] would talk about because we were you
[1:19:01] know the brothers they came home and
[1:19:03] they did some passing out flyers and and
[1:19:07] different things that like to say we
[1:19:10] were trying to reach a Lawson dying
[1:19:14] world that's just that should still be
[1:19:20] our desire as Christmas I just want to
[1:19:30] talk we feel a promise to the heavenly
[1:19:34] you know we start with solving God I
[1:19:38] believe that I believe God has given
[1:19:44] everything that that we stand in need of
[1:19:47] in his word how many per say God past
[1:19:53] makes provisions yeah you know when that
[1:19:59] I believe knew that what age and our
[1:20:01] that we will be right God knew that that
[1:20:05] you know we as a group of people we
[1:20:09] would be in the worst of Ages
[1:20:12] that right I believe that everything
[1:20:16] from the beginning has been congested in
[1:20:19] this age and and we're we're we're we're
[1:20:23] seeing things now that like we've not
[1:20:28] seen before I can recall getting
[1:20:33] converted in 1988 but you know I can see
[1:20:37] a chain yeah you got to see where where
[1:20:44] people are you know where they should be
[1:20:46] people are unstable like they used to
[1:20:50] buy on it right people people are humble
[1:20:53] like like they used to be but I mean you
[1:20:57] know it just goes along with the age
[1:20:59] that we're living in then right
[1:21:01] I don't know about you gonna break for
[1:21:04] tonight that the goddess has brought
[1:21:08] something back that we could look at to
[1:21:11] anchor us in this holiday this is what I
[1:21:16] believe we had to come back to the right
[1:21:22] in order to be able to truly survive
[1:21:26] this age we had to come back to a
[1:21:28] biblical principle things that we could
[1:21:34] not see things that we couldn't grasp on
[1:21:43] our own but the sovereignty of God you
[1:21:47] know but knew that we would be living in
[1:21:50] the age of pressure where people people
[1:21:55] are struggling people people are
[1:22:00] burdened down the word heavy lateness is
[1:22:04] burdened by the cares of Bergen physical
[1:22:08] heavy load trouble distress and you know
[1:22:11] we can see them on every hand we could
[1:22:14] see you know just the mindset of
[1:22:20] humanity young young people for these
[1:22:23] fools and you know you know 50 years ago
[1:22:30] when I was a kid you didn't hear about
[1:22:39] young people and with all the terms and
[1:22:43] pretty happy
[1:22:47] my question was it causing us to get
[1:22:52] ammunition and go and kill a bunch of
[1:22:54] innocent people but it is it's the agent
[1:22:58] Liberty television and video games you
[1:23:13] know week recent message then you know
[1:23:17] you you can you can see now he preached
[1:23:19] the message call invasion of the USA and
[1:23:24] from that message he was trying to show
[1:23:27] us the tool of the instrument that the
[1:23:31] enemy are using this power to bring a
[1:23:36] distress right
[1:23:41] Jeffrey burn right they just you know at
[1:23:50] a junction where they don't just don't
[1:23:52] really know what to do
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:03] other things that used to be wrong in
[1:24:06] life coming right where the Prophet was
[1:24:26] talking about just the burden of the
[1:24:28] ministry and how you know that the paper
[1:24:36] will put such pressure paraphrase but
[1:24:41] such pressure on the ministry took to
[1:24:45] such a degree with everyone it down the
[1:24:47] book write down the box and not
[1:24:54] realizing the detriment and letting down
[1:24:58] the always yes always had a provided see
[1:25:12] if we let down the standard
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:58] you know change this word nobody would
[1:26:44] not see
[1:26:46] [Applause]
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:45] yeah the pressure the pressure people
[1:28:32] leaving I think every Minister has
[1:28:35] experienced
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:44] but you know
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:00] one of the things that I like to use no
[1:30:05] matter what the world says they still
[1:30:15] how do you bow you know what you how
[1:30:23] could you take back what you know you
[1:30:30] know it's weird that people say God is
[1:30:33] revealed certain things that is next
[1:30:35] week no matter what the world say they
[1:30:53] still lean down to the modern trends of
[1:30:56] the modern religion mister this is the
[1:31:00] truth Ministry of the day right no
[1:31:05] social gospel a man for the men see this
[1:31:09] is the thing that people walk right we
[1:31:13] got this modern yes sure sit around and
[1:31:25] drink coffee
[1:31:30] just be religious you know rock song
[1:31:41] whatever and it's really filled you know
[1:31:45] all right watch yourself not realize it
[1:31:50] God have a plank that kind of program
[1:31:54] cost our standard you know ministry what
[1:32:01] a revelation realizes they made that is
[1:32:03] it's not the total farm this got to hold
[1:32:07] the standard you all appreciate God
[1:32:14] sitting you right an individual with one
[1:32:21] mission not to build anything but the
[1:32:27] poorest back to the work make yourself a
[1:32:33] dynasty none of it goes back to the
[1:32:37] white
[1:32:42] to bring us something that we won't get
[1:32:45] caught up amen and social you know mean
[1:33:01] that you know won't bow to the moderate
[1:33:03] trends of religion no social gospel of
[1:33:06] man they believe God still home we still
[1:33:31] believe in this
[1:33:37] met some people that still believe in
[1:33:39] polls but they believe he requires
[1:33:42] holiness he requires a new birth
[1:33:48] separation from see you know what I
[1:33:53] believe
[1:33:53] I believe if people will ever get born
[1:33:56] again but this this is the age of
[1:34:11] oppression they look unimpressed you in
[1:34:16] charge why while we are preaching the
[1:34:22] unsearchable riches of Jesus yes it was
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:42] [Applause]
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:35:04] that don't mean you to place arrest
[1:35:13] it's just a lot of people like that in a
[1:35:16] place of distress burden don't know
[1:35:20] which way to turn
[1:35:21] yeah don't know which way is invitation
[1:35:37] right everybody's heavy laden burden
[1:35:41] come what come the invitation to come
[1:35:48] right now see I think sometime I
[1:35:51] probably just satisfied will get people
[1:35:53] to appeal but gave them to the bill
[1:36:01] denied duress right you got to take the
[1:36:08] people all the way into the baptism
[1:36:13] that's the requirement that's the only
[1:36:17] thing that'll bring satisfaction all hot
[1:36:33] for that wrist and you can sleep right
[1:36:39] people people people are trying to find
[1:36:42] a recipe for peace and that's what
[1:36:49] that's what these types of meetings is
[1:36:51] all about right amen
