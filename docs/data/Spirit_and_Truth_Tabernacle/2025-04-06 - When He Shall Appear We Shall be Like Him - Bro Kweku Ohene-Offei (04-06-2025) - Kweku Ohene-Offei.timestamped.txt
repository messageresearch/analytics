[44:23] forward and the Holy Spirit starts to
[44:28] descend.
[44:31] Sometimes I don't even feel like singing
[44:35] a song.
[44:38] With all of the
[44:40] pressures, the press in me is gone.
[44:46] Seems like the

[48:03] I am happy to be in church.
[48:07] Uh, we thank God for just keeping us
[48:10] over the, uh, dangerous airways. Uh, but
[48:15] we got back from South Carolina on
[48:19] yesterday morning about 10:00. So, I I
[48:21] had a flight that left at 5:30 in the
[48:25] morning. And, um, when I got home, all I
[48:28] did was find a pillow and
[48:31] and uh tried to recover a little bit.
[48:34] Amen. But but God is good. God is good.
[48:37] We had a had a wonderful time there. Had
[48:39] a chance to visit uh Brother Belton on
[48:42] Wednesday night and uh also Brother
[48:45] Armstrong on Friday night and um and in
[48:48] between had a chance to uh go to the
[48:52] golf tournament and I played the worst I
[48:55] ever
[48:55] played. Amen. And I I I they gave me
[48:59] this special trophy called the last
[49:01] place
[49:04] trophy. Uh and I say, well, Lord, this
[49:08] is golf is a very humbling game because
[49:10] you know last year I came in second
[49:12] place and everybody was kind of what
[49:15] brother Jack going to do? Well, brother
[49:16] Jack didn't do nothing. Uh so I said
[49:19] that's all right. I'll take it. I'll be
[49:20] back. The only place I can go from here
[49:22] is All right.
[49:25] Amen.
[49:28] Amen. God is good. But while I was away,
[49:32] I got a chance to hear uh many of the
[49:37] services. And last Sunday, Brother Troy
[49:40] uh did a a wonderful job. And we
[49:45] not we not got to talking about that
[49:48] distortion in the microphones and how
[49:51] Satan tries to block you from being able
[49:53] to hear the real voice of God. We got
[49:56] too many voices speaking to us nowadays.
[49:58] And and we need to hear the voice of
[50:01] God. Amen. If I don't if y'all don't
[50:04] recognize, but the voice of politics
[50:06] speaks every day.
[50:10] You you you get a tweet every day.
[50:13] And we we never had it like this before.
[50:16] And and and it's so much stuff going on
[50:18] that uh all you end up talking about for
[50:21] most of the day is
[50:24] just
[50:26] mess mess. I mean, it it it's it's
[50:30] shameful, you know, but but uh but
[50:32] that's why we really need to concentrate
[50:34] on hearing the voice of God. Uh you
[50:36] can't be moved by everything that
[50:38] everybody out there reporting. Uh
[50:40] there's only one report that never
[50:42] changes.
[50:45] And that is the report found in the word
[50:48] of the Lord. Amen. And I believe the
[50:50] question was asked, whose report will
[50:53] you believe? And the answer was given, I
[50:57] will believe the report of the Lord.
[51:01] Praise God. Amen. But we we thank God
[51:04] for Brother Troy. And then on Wednesday
[51:06] night, uh, Brother Quinton came to
[51:10] minister to our hearts. And, uh, I just
[51:13] remember a statement that he made. Uh,
[51:16] silence
[51:18] is a weapon.
[51:23] I said, "My
[51:25] God, I was sitting there listening to
[51:27] that. I said, man, that's that's
[51:29] powerful." You know, just thank God for
[51:31] the word as it as it was going forth to
[51:33] our hearts and just appreciate these
[51:35] brothers. Amen. And and all that they're
[51:37] doing for the kingdom of God. Amen. I
[51:40] saw brother Smiley uh there. Good to
[51:42] have him back in service. He had been
[51:44] out preaching and and uh I know he's got
[51:47] some more things scheduled cuz while I
[51:49] was in uh Carolina said, "Yeah, brother
[51:51] Smiley coming." I said, "Well, praise
[51:52] the Lord. That's that's real good." But
[51:54] um I know that many of them sent their
[51:56] greetings and they say they're looking
[51:57] forward to coming here in uh in July. So
[52:01] we we we looking forward to it. They all
[52:03] keep things in prayer. um a lot of
[52:06] movement or people trying to move to get
[52:08] in and out but all kind of stuff being
[52:11] done in our government and we just we
[52:14] just need God to help his people. Amen.
[52:17] Just be with him through uh through this
[52:19] time. So, uh keep that keep keep those
[52:22] things in mind. Um I I know I'm supposed
[52:26] to say something
[52:27] else. It'll come to me. But while I'm uh
[52:31] here, I I have a couple prayer requests
[52:33] that I want to make mention
[52:35] of.
[52:37] Um first is uh Sister Lois asked prayer
[52:41] for a lady that she met this week. Uh
[52:44] her husband is in desperate need of
[52:46] prayer. We want to uh take that request
[52:49] before the Lord. Also, um I got um a
[52:55] request over in Sarasota.
[52:58] uh brother uh Frano's uncle
[53:01] uh he had been diagnosed with cancer and
[53:04] then they gave him uh they said he was
[53:07] free from cancer. They gave an update
[53:09] and now they're saying they misdiagnosed
[53:12] it and and and and saying that the
[53:14] cancer is back and there's not much that
[53:16] they can do. Uh but you know, we know a
[53:20] God that's greater than every doctor and
[53:23] uh and we're just going to take our
[53:25] brother before the Lord uh in prayer.
[53:28] There was another prayer request that I
[53:31] had and at the Oh, brother Mason.
[53:34] Brother Mason um he was um taken to the
[53:38] hospital, but he's back home right now.
[53:40] He's been complaining about some issues
[53:43] with his stomach and uh we want to uh
[53:46] just remember him in prayer. The test
[53:48] that they did at the hospital all came
[53:50] back negative. We thank God for that.
[53:52] And uh but he's just having trouble uh
[53:55] sleeping and uh and I'd like to read
[54:00] Psalm 127 uh over our brother and uh
[54:04] we'll have a word of prayer for him. And
[54:07] the other thing I want to make mention
[54:08] of, um, uh, we have, uh, Sister Boyd,
[54:13] Amen, with us today. God bless you,
[54:16] Sister Boyd. So good. So good to have
[54:19] you. Amen. Service. And I see my cousin
[54:22] back there, too. Cousins. All right,
[54:25] Ashley. All right. Good to see you. And
[54:28] um uh also sister
[54:33] um Cynthia, she has her sister with us
[54:38] on today. God bless you. So good to have
[54:41] uh them and that with us. Praise the
[54:44] Lord. Uh Psalm 127 just real quick. I
[54:47] want to read this in
[54:49] um
[54:53] uh
[54:55] verse. Let me just let me just go
[54:59] straight to verse two. You when you open
[55:01] up the Bible, you start seeing things
[55:03] like, Lord, let me let me get out of
[55:05] here. Let me just read verse two and
[55:07] leave. Amen. Uh scripture say it is vain
[55:12] for you to rise up early, to sit up
[55:15] late,
[55:17] uh to eat the bread of sorrows, for so
[55:20] he giveth his beloved
[55:24] sleep. Amen. God wants you to be able to
[55:28] sleep, not up all night. And that's the
[55:31] devil that want to do that to you. But
[55:33] uh God wants you to rest at night. Amen.
[55:36] When it's time to rest. Amen. So we want
[55:39] to pray for brother Mason. Amen. Uh also
[55:43] this request from sister Lois and also
[55:47] the request there in Sarah. So let's bow
[55:49] our heads. Father, we come in the mighty
[55:52] name of Jesus.
[55:55] the name that is above every
[55:57] name. Father, we realize that when
[56:00] Christ went to a cross, he went for a
[56:02] twofold
[56:04] purpose. One was to bring salvation to
[56:07] our souls. We were lost and undone. Uh
[56:10] we needed a savior. And God, you brought
[56:15] uh the remedy for us. And we thank you
[56:17] for what you did when you died and you
[56:19] rose again. You brought the remedy. But
[56:21] also at the cross, you did something
[56:23] else.
[56:24] Lord, the scripture says you were
[56:26] wounded for our transgressions, bruised
[56:28] for our iniquities, the chastisement of
[56:30] our peace was upon you. And it also told
[56:32] us that with your
[56:34] stripes, we are healed. So, Father, over
[56:38] these requests, we ask for healing uh
[56:41] even right now. Brother Mason that has
[56:45] been fighting, Lord, with this stomach
[56:47] condition, they couldn't find it, but
[56:50] Lord, he still feels something. So,
[56:52] Satan, we want to tell you, we rebuke
[56:55] you in the name of Jesus. If the doctors
[56:59] say there's nothing there, then there is
[57:00] nothing there. And uh we receive it
[57:04] right now in the name of Jesus. And we
[57:06] pray God that you would give Mason sleep
[57:08] because you say you give your beloved
[57:10] sleep. And I pray that you would just
[57:12] bless him, Father, abundantly. Give him
[57:14] peace in his heart and in his mind. And
[57:16] Lord, help him, Father, just to get
[57:18] through this. We also want to remember
[57:20] sister Lois's uh the lady that she met,
[57:23] the husband is in desperate need of
[57:25] prayer. And father, we know prayer is
[57:27] something that changes things no matter
[57:29] what the situation is. So we commit this
[57:31] man uh into your capable hands and pray
[57:34] father that you would move on the scene
[57:36] on his behalf if he does not know you as
[57:39] his savior. God, we pray that this would
[57:40] be used as an opportunity to draw him
[57:43] closer to you. Father, that's our
[57:45] prayer. We also want to remember our
[57:46] precious brother there in uh St. in in
[57:50] Sarasota. God, the doctors gave him a
[57:53] clear report and uh the man's been
[57:56] rejoicing in that. And now, Father, the
[57:58] enemies come back to attack his body and
[58:01] they don't know uh what to say or what
[58:03] to do, Lord. But uh we know that you are
[58:05] in complete control. And Father, we're
[58:08] asking that you would just move on the
[58:10] scene. uh in between him and his
[58:12] condition. We place the blood of the
[58:15] Lord Jesus Christ and we claim our
[58:16] brother once again for your glory. And
[58:19] we ask God that you would move by your
[58:21] spirit. I know the devil didn't like the
[58:23] testimony that went out about him uh
[58:25] being healed. And Lord, we're praying,
[58:28] Father, that you give him a second
[58:29] testimony of being healed again. Father,
[58:32] we uh we we we we know that there's
[58:34] nothing too hard for you. and you you
[58:36] you told us through your prophet that if
[58:40] we could just get the people to believe
[58:42] not even cancer would stand in the way
[58:46] of a prayer. So father we we believe
[58:48] that our prayer even has power over
[58:50] cancer. So we ask God that you would
[58:53] move even right now uh for our precious
[58:55] brothers in the name of Jesus that we
[58:58] ask it. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[59:02] Amen. God bless you. We want to um just
[59:06] prepare amen our hearts for the word uh
[59:09] on today. Uh brother Quu will be coming
[59:13] to minister for us and and and I am
[59:17] grateful to have all the help here in
[59:20] the church that we got. Uh cuz I I need
[59:24] it. Amen. I need it. And I remember
[59:26] brother Anderson uh he preached over at
[59:29] Brother West Coast Church one time and
[59:30] he he he said something. He says um when
[59:34] he got to uh leading the church, he
[59:36] said, "Lord, I can't do this all by
[59:37] myself. I need some help." And uh he
[59:40] said, "Ever since he said that to the
[59:41] Lord, God has always provided help." And
[59:44] every season, God had has help. So I
[59:47] said, you know, if God answered his
[59:48] prayer, I'm going to pray the same
[59:50] thing. Lord, I need some help. And God
[59:53] has sent us some help in this church.
[59:56] And I thank God for these servants of
[59:58] God. Amen. I appreciate them.
[1:00:02] appreciate them so much. Amen. So, we
[1:00:05] want to just raise to our feet and let's
[1:00:08] Amen. prepare to receive uh the word of
[1:00:10] the Lord as it comes through uh brother
[1:00:13] Quu.
[1:00:16] Amen. Amazing.

[1:05:12] the 1st. I think it was Saturday. I
[1:05:15] normally get a little more rest on
[1:05:17] Saturdays cuz I don't have to work on
[1:05:19] the weekends. So, Friday night uh when I
[1:05:21] wake up, I usually like to listen to uh
[1:05:24] Arab's message or other preachers. So, I
[1:05:27] slot in a message. I think uh investment
[1:05:30] is that right? So investment was the
[1:05:32] message I was preaching Phoenix if you
[1:05:34] can go to the second slide for me
[1:05:39] please okay that's right so I was
[1:05:42] listening to this sermon and sometime I
[1:05:44] listen and I fall asleep but I hear my
[1:05:46] subconsc
[1:05:47] wake up, listen and fall asleep again.
[1:05:50] And then when I feel like really waking
[1:05:51] up and I wake up. So this time I was
[1:05:54] gone. I was sleeping and gone and I was
[1:05:56] listening to this message uh sorry
[1:05:59] investment that was preached by William
[1:06:01] Abraham 1963 January 26 Finn Arizona.
[1:06:05] Right. So there the voice didn't come
[1:06:08] from the sermon. I was just fast asleep
[1:06:10] and a striking voice hit my heart. When
[1:06:13] he shall appear we be like him. Amen.
[1:06:15] And I woke up instantly and I said, "No,
[1:06:17] this is a scripture." So I went to the
[1:06:19] scriptures and I saw this scripture in 1
[1:06:22] John 3:2. We will go to that. So I
[1:06:26] quickly p it down and look at the time.
[1:06:28] It was around 11:23 a.m. in the morning.
[1:06:31] So that was how and I was preparing for
[1:06:33] Puerto Rico and uh I I already had a
[1:06:36] sermon I wanted to preach on the Sunday.
[1:06:38] the pastor, brother Jose asked me to
[1:06:41] preach a Sunday morning and then he
[1:06:43] asked me to take either Friday night or
[1:06:46] Saturday in the evening. So I usually
[1:06:48] this was my fourth visit to Puerto Rico
[1:06:50] and I usually take the Saturday because
[1:06:52] I travel on the Friday and sometime two
[1:06:55] days before the journey I don't get
[1:06:57] enough enough sleep sometime I don't I
[1:06:59] barely sleep so I prefer take the taking
[1:07:01] the Saturday service but this time I
[1:07:03] said you know what I can take the Friday
[1:07:05] so because you know what I I think I'll
[1:07:07] be able to take the Friday but I didn't
[1:07:09] communicate with him and I was like oh I
[1:07:11] need to let him know record a voicemail
[1:07:13] send him a text message but I was like
[1:07:15] something was I mean kind of h holding
[1:07:18] me from doing it and I was contemplating
[1:07:20] on the sermon that I wanted to preach on
[1:07:22] the uh Friday night. The sermon that was
[1:07:26] coming on my heart was what I preach
[1:07:27] here the influence and impact of a godly
[1:07:30] mother. But I was wondering is it the
[1:07:32] right sermon you know to preach for
[1:07:34] international service people from
[1:07:36] Paraguay uh Dominican Republic. So and I
[1:07:40] was battling my heart is it the right
[1:07:41] thing to preach? So a couple of days
[1:07:44] before I left I saw a voice message from
[1:07:47] brother Osbi said brother please you
[1:07:50] have to preach the Friday night because
[1:07:52] I wanted brother Mario he's a pastor
[1:07:54] from Paraguay he came with his wife and
[1:07:56] his son to Puerto Rico they were friends
[1:07:59] so he came like a week h ear earlier h
[1:08:02] was also part of the ministry in Puerto
[1:08:04] Rico so but then his mom was sick so he
[1:08:06] had to fly back to Paraguay and see his
[1:08:09] mom and his mom was actually passing he
[1:08:11] was the mom was at the hospital. So, but
[1:08:13] the Lord is wonderful, my brothers and
[1:08:15] sisters. H when you serve the Lord, it's
[1:08:17] not in vain. Amen. So, the mom had been
[1:08:20] a Catholic for years, you know, coming
[1:08:22] from South South America. And uh the mom
[1:08:25] said that, "What do you think I don't
[1:08:26] what do you what made you to think I
[1:08:28] don't believe your message?" He said,
[1:08:30] "The Lord has told me that you are
[1:08:32] blessed for raising a minister of the
[1:08:34] Lord." And so, the brother was with his
[1:08:36] mom in the last days at the hospital and
[1:08:39] the mom transitioned to the Lord. Praise
[1:08:42] God. So he flew back on the Friday about
[1:08:45] 6 8 hours back to Puerto Rico. So the
[1:08:47] pastor said brother quickly please if
[1:08:48] you can preach because brother Mario
[1:08:50] would not be in a position to preach on
[1:08:51] a on a Friday and I said brother you
[1:08:54] just confirm what the Lord has placed on
[1:08:56] my heart because I was kind of wondering
[1:08:59] is it a right sermon and when you told
[1:09:01] me about the Mario's mother has passed
[1:09:02] on then I know it's the right sermon and
[1:09:04] I know why the Lord placed on my heart.
[1:09:06] All right. So with the Sunday sermon, I
[1:09:09] had something already I wanted to preach
[1:09:11] that was on dispensational changes about
[1:09:14] h from son of god. No sorry son of son
[1:09:19] of son of man, son of god and son of
[1:09:22] David. How the lord transitioned from
[1:09:24] Adam to Jesus Christ was the rede
[1:09:27] redemption ministry. So he came as a
[1:09:29] prophet as a lamb sending a prophet
[1:09:32] killing lambs to redeem the people of
[1:09:34] the lord. Amen. And then he changed from
[1:09:36] a lamb to a crossfish when he came on
[1:09:39] Calvary. Remember Calvary after he done
[1:09:42] he said it is finished. He's finished
[1:09:44] the redemption. He's just pulling the
[1:09:46] sons from the Theophony to the earth and
[1:09:48] back to the theophony. All right. So he
[1:09:50] came from a ram to a crossfish. And the
[1:09:53] crossfish is two fishes with open open
[1:09:57] mouth. So that symbolizes the blessing
[1:10:00] of the of the older son. All right.
[1:10:02] Coming to the younger. Right? In other
[1:10:04] words, the gospel moving from Israel,
[1:10:07] the firstborn church to the gentile. And
[1:10:10] so, and then from Jesus Christ up to
[1:10:13] Sunset Mountain was the son of God
[1:10:16] ministry, the Holy Spirit ministry.
[1:10:17] Amen. Where is about from the church
[1:10:20] ages? Look at Abraham when he was here.
[1:10:22] Only believe, only believe, all things
[1:10:27] are possible. Only believe. That was the
[1:10:30] that was the Piscy ministry. And the
[1:10:32] Lord used brother Paul move on to sunset
[1:10:36] and the Lord crossed his hands again on
[1:10:38] on sunset mountain and change the scene
[1:10:41] change the dimension now from the seven
[1:10:43] church changes which was the darkness
[1:10:45] when the lord when does the h stars
[1:10:47] appear stars appear in the night so the
[1:10:50] lord was sending messages in the seven
[1:10:51] churches for over 2,000 years or around
[1:10:53] 2,000 years and the lord has now
[1:10:55] finished building the church glory from
[1:10:58] Adam to Jesus was the foundation all
[1:11:00] right and from Jesus to sunset mountain
[1:11:02] was the building itself. But then the
[1:11:05] building has to be kept cuz if you build
[1:11:07] a house without a roof, you're going to
[1:11:08] have the sunshine, the rain, and all the
[1:11:11] weather on you. So now from from um uh
[1:11:16] uh 63, Sunset Mountain till whenever
[1:11:19] will be the third ministry that is the
[1:11:21] Aquarian, the eagle ministry. That's
[1:11:23] when the fullness of the mind of God go
[1:11:25] God was given to the wife of Jesus
[1:11:27] Christ. So that was what I was planning
[1:11:29] to to preach. And then this voice came.
[1:11:31] The voice didn't tell me go preach in
[1:11:32] Puerto Rico or in West Palm, but it
[1:11:35] changed my heart from what I wanted to
[1:11:36] preach. So I went and I'll give a little
[1:11:40] testimony. The Lord just did something
[1:11:42] marvelous. I'll go into the preaching,
[1:11:43] but I want to share the testimonies
[1:11:45] first. Amen. So I went and Friday night
[1:11:48] I preached the same thing that I preach
[1:11:49] here. Influence of a godly mother h
[1:11:52] impact and influence on on the children.
[1:11:55] And so when I preach one brother who was
[1:11:57] my friend, brother Jose, brother uh
[1:12:00] Quinton and brother Jeffrey and brother
[1:12:03] Mark knows brother brother Rammon he
[1:12:05] said brother did my wife has my wife
[1:12:07] spoken to you. I said no. He said okay
[1:12:08] I'll wait. She would tell you what you
[1:12:11] were preaching was exactly things were
[1:12:13] going on and the pastor's wife said
[1:12:15] brother you don't live in Puerto Rico
[1:12:16] with us. you are not here with us but
[1:12:18] you were touching on it things exactly
[1:12:21] as we going through in the church and
[1:12:23] our families and things like that among
[1:12:26] certain family situations that were
[1:12:27] going on and so the pastor said brother
[1:12:30] what really touched me is when you said
[1:12:33] that when our childrens are asleep we
[1:12:35] should go to their bedroom don't mind
[1:12:38] let them sleep their way out don't wake
[1:12:39] them up just go to their bedroom and
[1:12:42] pray for them lay hands on them don't
[1:12:44] wait when they are adolescent or they
[1:12:46] teenagers but when they are babies as
[1:12:48] early as you can when they draw from the
[1:12:50] mother's womb if you can start praying
[1:12:52] for them and that responsibility is on
[1:12:55] both the father and the mother not only
[1:12:57] the father only or the mother only said
[1:12:58] brother that really touched me so we
[1:13:01] preach on the Friday and the Saturday
[1:13:03] morning was a minister's meeting so the
[1:13:06] pastor gave us a topic on holy ghost
[1:13:08] baptism we were about 12 14 ministers
[1:13:11] and everyone was coming from the same
[1:13:13] different angle but the same spirit so
[1:13:16] Brother Marco, he was the one who opened
[1:13:18] the the first service. He talked on
[1:13:20] spoke on how you can never get the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost baptism within the denomination.
[1:13:26] You need a revealed word of the Lord to
[1:13:27] give you the new birth. Amen. So I went
[1:13:29] after him and as was preaching there, I
[1:13:32] already I sent my sermons to him before
[1:13:34] even I went to Puerto Rico to translate
[1:13:36] them into Spanish and to put them in in
[1:13:38] their system. So he said, I preach on
[1:13:41] same thing. I took it from Adam. Why do
[1:13:43] we even need the Holy Ghost baptism?
[1:13:46] Because Adam didn't need a Holy Ghost
[1:13:47] baptism. If didn't need the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] baptism, why you and I need a Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] baptism? There were three people that
[1:13:53] never needed the Holy Ghost. Adam, Mrs.
[1:13:56] Adam, and Jesus Christ. They never
[1:13:58] needed a new birth. That was not their
[1:14:00] story. But the rest of mankind from from
[1:14:03] H from the next person to the last
[1:14:05] person, we need the Holy Ghost baptism,
[1:14:07] right? And that's the most important
[1:14:09] thing in your life. So I pick it from
[1:14:10] there because of the four. We got a
[1:14:12] nature. We got a soul that was permitted
[1:14:14] by God. It was a permissive will of God.
[1:14:16] It wasn't the original will of God. So
[1:14:18] that permissible God will never accept
[1:14:20] permissible. He can let permissible
[1:14:23] permissible will go on. Yes. But it has
[1:14:25] to come to an end. And so he has to
[1:14:27] usher in the perfectable of God. And
[1:14:29] that is bringing his nature, his soul,
[1:14:31] his attribute redemption into our heart.
[1:14:34] Amen. So I pre everybody had 30 minutes
[1:14:37] to preach. And when I finished, I said,
[1:14:39] "Brother, you have 10 more minutes."
[1:14:40] Marco didn't use all his
[1:14:42] time. You got the anointing was just
[1:14:45] keep going in and then we kept going and
[1:14:48] I the Lord brought something from I
[1:14:50] preach a I pick a scripture from Ezekiel
[1:14:53] chapter 37. If you want to put that
[1:14:55] scripture I just want to Ezekiel 37
[1:14:59] verse. It wasn't part of what I'm going
[1:15:00] to preach but I just want to share the
[1:15:02] testimony. Ezekiel 37:4 to about 28. All
[1:15:06] right. And it wasn't I had that
[1:15:08] scripture but as brother Michael was
[1:15:10] ministering the Lord br something right
[1:15:12] there. So when he went and I said
[1:15:14] brother I'm seeing justification
[1:15:17] sanctification sorry 36 Ezekiel 36 not
[1:15:21] 37 justification sanctification and
[1:15:23] battles of the Holy Ghost right in these
[1:15:25] scriptures that I've never seen. All
[1:15:26] right. So when we were ministering he
[1:15:28] translate for me. He said brother you
[1:15:30] didn't include this things in the
[1:15:31] poweroint he sent to me. I said yes I
[1:15:33] didn't have it. He just dropped the Lord
[1:15:35] just dropped it right when he were
[1:15:37] ministering. He said, "For I will take
[1:15:39] from you I'll take from among from among
[1:15:43] the heathen and gather you out of your
[1:15:45] countries and will bring you into your
[1:15:46] land." So that is the Lord justifying
[1:15:48] you, taking us from the trash can, from
[1:15:51] the from the Spanish call it basura.
[1:15:53] Take you from the trash of the world.
[1:15:55] Wherever the Lord found you, wherever
[1:15:57] the Lord found me, we were trash. Why
[1:15:59] were we trash? Not because of the things
[1:16:00] that you were doing, but because you
[1:16:02] were born with a nature that was permiss
[1:16:05] permissible of God. Sin satan in your
[1:16:09] nature. Amen. And so the Lord has to
[1:16:11] consume that Satan in our nature to
[1:16:14] bring the the Christ into our nature.
[1:16:16] Amen. Amen. Six, Satan Eve cross before
[1:16:20] God could cross with the earth. Satan
[1:16:23] already cross the serpent cross before
[1:16:25] Adam could cross his wife. And God has
[1:16:28] to uncross. Amen. And then he cross you
[1:16:30] at Calvary and that brings a new birth.
[1:16:33] So God taking you from the trash is
[1:16:34] justification. Verse 20 25. Let's go.
[1:16:37] Then he sanctify you. He said then I
[1:16:39] will sprinkle clean waters upon you and
[1:16:42] you shall be clean from all your
[1:16:43] filthiness. From all the idols will I
[1:16:46] cleanse you. Amen. Amen. And all of us
[1:16:48] had idols. Right. Idols come is in
[1:16:51] different way. You can worship your car.
[1:16:53] You can worship yourself. You can
[1:16:55] worship money. You can worship job. You
[1:16:57] can worship profession. You can worship
[1:16:59] whatever your family. But let nothing
[1:17:03] come between you and God.
[1:17:05] Oh Israel, love the Lord thy God with
[1:17:08] all of your heart, your substance, your
[1:17:10] spirit, your soul, everything. Amen.
[1:17:12] Number one, that is your creator. So God
[1:17:15] cleanses her. Then the 26, let's go
[1:17:17] there. And said, then I'll put in you.
[1:17:20] You cannot even agree with yourself.
[1:17:21] That's right, brother. When you don't
[1:17:23] have the Holy Ghost. Amen. You get mad
[1:17:25] all the time. Amen. You get depressed,
[1:17:28] right? Even good things that is coming
[1:17:30] your way, you fight it because you can't
[1:17:32] agree with your own spirit because that
[1:17:34] spirit is not of of the Lord. And it
[1:17:37] doesn't give you peace. Amen. Amen. So
[1:17:39] the Lord has to consume that spirit and
[1:17:42] put a new spirit. He said, I a new heart
[1:17:45] also will I give you and a new spirit
[1:17:47] that I'll put within you and I will take
[1:17:49] away the stony heart out of your flesh
[1:17:52] and I'll give you an heart of flesh.
[1:17:55] Amen. Amen. You take away the old, the
[1:17:57] old soul, the old nature and place
[1:18:00] himself, the Lord Jesus Christ in you.
[1:18:02] Then you can agree with yourself and
[1:18:04] then you agree with the Lord. Then say,
[1:18:06] Lord, here I am. Amen. Whatever you want
[1:18:08] to do with my life, Lord, do it. Amen.
[1:18:11] Amen. And it doesn't end there. Let's go
[1:18:13] to 27.
[1:18:15] 27. Then this is the new the Holy Ghost
[1:18:18] baptism. After 26 uh 26, you still not
[1:18:21] born again. And if you want to go to
[1:18:24] future home, said you can have a nice
[1:18:25] spirit, cleanse, wash, perfect. You
[1:18:29] don't even have desire to drink anymore.
[1:18:30] You don't have the desire to do those
[1:18:32] things. But yet still you don't have the
[1:18:34] Holy Ghost baptism. Christ is under the
[1:18:36] inside. Only the cup has been cleansed.
[1:18:39] If it's not filled, you go up, go back
[1:18:41] and do the things that you didn't even
[1:18:42] used to do. You go back to drinking,
[1:18:44] smoking, cursing, and prostitution, and
[1:18:47] whatever you didn't even used to do, you
[1:18:49] go back to it. So being cleansed and
[1:18:51] justified is not enough. Amen. You need
[1:18:53] the Holy Ghost baptism. So then the Lord
[1:18:56] will put his spirit that is he himself
[1:18:58] will come and dwell in you. And then
[1:19:00] I'll cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:19:02] and it connect with what I'm going to
[1:19:03] preach. When he shall appear, we shall
[1:19:06] be like him. Not just like him, but we
[1:19:09] shall be him. Amen. Amen. Glory. And he
[1:19:13] shall keep my judgment and do them. Then
[1:19:15] 20 28. Now your promise is your blessing
[1:19:18] and you shall dwell in the land that I
[1:19:20] gave to your fathers and you shall you
[1:19:22] shall be my people and I'll be your God.
[1:19:24] So you and Jesus Christ walking sister
[1:19:27] as you walking it's not just you. Glory
[1:19:29] but there's a being if you have Christ
[1:19:31] on the inside that works within you and
[1:19:34] even sinners can look at you and they
[1:19:35] look at you twice. There's something
[1:19:37] about this lady. That's right. There's
[1:19:38] something about this coworker. There's
[1:19:40] something about this neighbor. What is
[1:19:41] about him? There's a dimension. Amen.
[1:19:44] She or he might not understand exactly,
[1:19:46] but there's another person that is
[1:19:48] working in your flesh. Amen. Glory,
[1:19:51] glory, glory, glory, glory. Praise God.
[1:19:54] Amen.
[1:19:57] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Sometime when
[1:19:59] you are even working by yourself. I
[1:20:01] don't know you. I believe some of you
[1:20:03] experience it when you get by yourself
[1:20:05] in natural environment where there's not
[1:20:08] noise and all this crazy stuff. Sometime
[1:20:10] you walk in and you see like somebody's
[1:20:12] following you. Amen. You see an aura
[1:20:14] around you. There's somebody but there's
[1:20:16] nobody following you. There's nobody
[1:20:18] around. It's a dimension in you that
[1:20:21] comes out and want to fellowship with
[1:20:23] you. Amen. Amen. Is there all along but
[1:20:26] sometime you want a fellowship outside
[1:20:28] of the as outside of the inside. Amen. I
[1:20:32] don't know if you make a sense outside
[1:20:34] of the inside. He's still inside. He
[1:20:37] does things within but sometime he want
[1:20:39] to show himself visibly to you to let
[1:20:41] you know that he loves you. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:43] Glory. Hallelujah to the Lord because
[1:20:45] he's a husband. So the Lord gave us the
[1:20:47] pastor said, "Brother, keep going. Keep
[1:20:49] going a little bit." And the Lord bless
[1:20:51] us and all of us were on the same
[1:20:52] accord. Amen. And so I want to go back
[1:20:56] to the to the testimonies. The Lord gave
[1:20:58] wonderful testimonies on the word and
[1:21:00] the Lord touched like I said touch on
[1:21:02] specific situation. And this testimony
[1:21:04] number three, rainbow didn't happen. It
[1:21:06] happened before I went there. That was
[1:21:08] on the 9th of March. I went there the
[1:21:10] 14th. So, brother Marco actually he put
[1:21:13] me in in his house and he's a very good
[1:21:15] friend of mine, him and the pastor and
[1:21:17] we met first in Cancun, Mexico and said,
[1:21:19] "Brother, we were there was there was a
[1:21:21] place around his house which is wooded,
[1:21:24] beautiful flowers, awesome place." And I
[1:21:26] like to just look at the place and you
[1:21:28] could see nature, you know, God is in
[1:21:30] nature. So, he said recently the the
[1:21:32] owner of the property came around and he
[1:21:34] said he wanted to clean up the place and
[1:21:36] sell it. and said I've of I've always
[1:21:38] had an interest to possess that place
[1:21:40] because it's more or less part of my
[1:21:41] land. So I told the man that yeah I'll
[1:21:43] buy it. So the man said well if I ready
[1:21:45] you'll be the first person I'll notify.
[1:21:47] So brother Marco called his pastor. He's
[1:21:49] one of the is minister in the church. He
[1:21:52] called his pastor. He invited people to
[1:21:53] his home to have a cookout all vegans
[1:21:56] food. They do different things barbecue
[1:21:57] but it's all vegan. So they had one of
[1:22:00] these cookout. I think it was Sunday.
[1:22:02] And then uh he called a pastor to go and
[1:22:04] just step out with about six ministers
[1:22:07] and his wife seven. So they form a
[1:22:10] circle, put your arms around and they
[1:22:12] quoted I think u Deuteronomy 24:11 or
[1:22:16] 11:24 footstep is possession. If you can
[1:22:19] bring it out for me I think 2411. Let's
[1:22:21] see. And I said brother this testimony
[1:22:24] is consistent with where our church is
[1:22:26] in now. So I want you to record an audio
[1:22:30] of this testimony so that I can share
[1:22:32] with the brethren. Amen. So Deuteronomy
[1:22:36] 24:11 I believe if you can have that
[1:22:39] scripture. I should have added
[1:22:44] it. Let's try
[1:22:47] 11:24.
[1:22:49] See, try an
[1:22:51] error. Let's see if that will work.
[1:22:53] Amen. 11:24, I believe. So
[1:22:57] hopefully awesome we got now said every
[1:22:59] place Deuteronomy 11:24 every place 11
[1:23:02] is a look at the numbers 11 is a number
[1:23:06] of perfect standing true disciples of
[1:23:08] Jesus Christ if you stand in the way of
[1:23:11] if you become a true disciple of Christ
[1:23:13] in other words let yourself go and God
[1:23:16] fill you the Holy Ghost what you you
[1:23:18] desire God will give it to you it's just
[1:23:21] like a man marrying a wife you know the
[1:23:22] desires of your wife and you want to
[1:23:24] please your wife make her happy. The
[1:23:26] Lord is greater than your husband. Amen.
[1:23:28] He want to make you happy more than your
[1:23:30] husband can ever make you happy. Amen.
[1:23:31] So he said every place where the souls
[1:23:33] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[1:23:36] from the wilderness and Lebanon from the
[1:23:39] river and the river Euphrates even unto
[1:23:41] the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
[1:23:44] Amen. So footprints is what? Possession.
[1:23:48] Whatever you desire, you believe it. It
[1:23:50] might not be physical land, but it's
[1:23:52] your desires on your heart. That's
[1:23:54] right. and imprints the pillar of fire
[1:23:56] in your heart and you believe it. Amen.
[1:23:59] And it will come to pass. Praise God. So
[1:24:01] they form a circle and prayed. And while
[1:24:03] they pray, let's go to uh the slide.
[1:24:06] There was a rainbow and there was a
[1:24:08] whirlwind that came
[1:24:10] around that was the photo I think. Okay,
[1:24:14] there you go. So the brothers form a
[1:24:16] circle together with brother Marco's
[1:24:18] wife, sister Rosalyn. And as they they
[1:24:20] saw a white horse that was tied
[1:24:22] somewhere and when the whirlwind begin
[1:24:24] to when the pastor was praying started
[1:24:25] to pray the whirlwind begin to come
[1:24:27] around them and they didn't know
[1:24:29] anything about the rainbow not knowing
[1:24:30] that some of the brothers in the house
[1:24:32] far away were taking pictures and they
[1:24:34] didn't know. So they were praying and
[1:24:35] the war winding came around and the
[1:24:37] horse who was tied came closer the horse
[1:24:40] has still got a string and then he came
[1:24:42] closer to where they were and the the
[1:24:44] horse bowed its head in prayer.
[1:24:48] And I will tell you sometime the
[1:24:50] creation or the animals are more
[1:24:52] sensitive to the spirit than us.
[1:24:55] They are more sensitive to it than the
[1:24:56] human. They don't have a soul. They only
[1:24:59] operate in the flesh and the spirit. But
[1:25:01] sometime they can sense the presence of
[1:25:02] God more than human beings that have
[1:25:05] goals can sense. Amen. Remember the the
[1:25:08] the prophet Bam, a whole prophet, but
[1:25:11] his greed for money and materialism just
[1:25:14] blinded him. And the Lord brought an
[1:25:17] angel of the Lord. There was an angel of
[1:25:18] the Lord before them. Bam didn't see the
[1:25:20] angel because he wanted to get money.
[1:25:22] It's about dollars, money, gold, and
[1:25:24] money. But the horse or the donkey was
[1:25:26] able to sense that there was an angel
[1:25:29] and the horse wouldn't move. He was
[1:25:30] whipping the horse because he wanted to
[1:25:32] be rich because the king bail wanted to
[1:25:35] enrich him by cursing Israel. Never
[1:25:38] curse the body of Christ. Amen. Amen. Do
[1:25:40] not curse your brother. Do not curse
[1:25:42] your sister. No matter what he does
[1:25:44] against you, don't curse your children.
[1:25:46] Amen. Don't use those word. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:49] So that the Lord can allow somebody
[1:25:50] close to you to hurt you so bad. Yes.
[1:25:52] Remember David? Amen. People spot on his
[1:25:55] face. Has somebody spat on your face
[1:25:57] before? I don't think so. But David, a
[1:26:00] king, a whole king, a prophet, king and
[1:26:02] priest. And the son of Saul came and
[1:26:05] spat on his face and call him Bale. Bale
[1:26:08] means you a serpent seed. That's right.
[1:26:09] You are the one because the kingdom has
[1:26:11] taken from the house of Saul to David.
[1:26:13] And that person didn't like David at
[1:26:15] all. That's right. So he sp on him and
[1:26:17] his sold just wanted to kill him said no
[1:26:19] leave him alone for the Lord asked him
[1:26:22] to do it like the sermon silence is a
[1:26:25] wonderful it's a what great weapon so
[1:26:28] sometimes it's not what you speak it's
[1:26:30] not what you act let back off and let
[1:26:33] the pill of fire take control
[1:26:36] you might be seem like a fool or why you
[1:26:38] can say something you have to react you
[1:26:40] have to take this no no no no no
[1:26:43] your action will escalate things amen
[1:26:45] Yes. Is not going to solve the problem.
[1:26:46] You're going to worship him. You're
[1:26:47] going to make things complicated and
[1:26:49] sophisticated. But let the Lord have his
[1:26:52] own way. Amen. And in the silence when
[1:26:54] you hear nothing when you seem like a
[1:26:56] fool. When you seem like defeated, the
[1:26:58] Lord is working. That's right. And the
[1:27:00] Lord will turn the ties in your favor.
[1:27:02] Amen. And the right time when you are
[1:27:03] laying in bed, the Lord will wake you
[1:27:05] up. And let you have the victory. Amen.
[1:27:09] Amen. So sometime you don't have to say
[1:27:11] nothing. Glory. Hallelujah. God. So the
[1:27:13] the brother took a picture and they saw
[1:27:15] the rainbow and the whirlwind and
[1:27:17] brother Michael said brother I believe
[1:27:18] the Lord has given to me and even if the
[1:27:20] Lord doesn't give it to me glory to his
[1:27:22] name. Amen. Amen. Glory hallelujah.
[1:27:24] Praise God. So uh let's go. And there
[1:27:27] was another we went to hiking h I think
[1:27:30] the last but one day on the 17th we went
[1:27:33] to hiking on the mountain. They call it
[1:27:34] a yuni. So we didn't go to the top of
[1:27:36] the mountain this time but we went to
[1:27:38] one of the historical areas. They have
[1:27:39] some kind of castles where their old
[1:27:42] pastor used to go and pray. I think one
[1:27:43] time he prayed and fasted for the night
[1:27:45] and the Lord did some supernatural. So
[1:27:47] they took me to the side and then we
[1:27:49] went and the whole almost the whole
[1:27:51] church the elderly women over 70 years.
[1:27:53] So this time the pastor said the elderly
[1:27:56] people are going to go ahead of us
[1:27:57] because when the young people go we run
[1:27:59] early go and leave the elderly people.
[1:28:01] So now the elderly people go in front
[1:28:04] and then the rest follow. So when they
[1:28:05] get tired we stay, we snack and we keep
[1:28:08] going. And they say over every year
[1:28:10] about 12 million uh tourists go to the
[1:28:12] place. So in the morning we went as
[1:28:14] early as I think around by 8 some of the
[1:28:17] parking place were four. You couldn't
[1:28:19] get a place to park. So we went to this
[1:28:21] forest where they have magnetic force in
[1:28:24] the forest. So we went we fellowship we
[1:28:27] prayed and whilst we were praying they
[1:28:29] have courts like stones rocks that you
[1:28:31] can take as trophy. So we were praying
[1:28:33] you put your arms on the racks and you
[1:28:35] feel the pool you feel the magnetic
[1:28:37] force. I think they they said the whole
[1:28:39] world have three places that they have
[1:28:41] that magnet magnetic forces. Bamuda
[1:28:43] triangle somewhere in Florida and that
[1:28:46] place in Puerto Rico that's where they
[1:28:48] have that forces. So we went to pray and
[1:28:51] then as we were praying brother Marco it
[1:28:53] was a still atmosphere the winds were
[1:28:55] not blowing and the palm leaves were
[1:28:58] worshiping whip. So brother took a
[1:29:00] picture I'll share on the brother's app
[1:29:01] later. God is in creation. And sometime
[1:29:04] when you get out away from the crazy
[1:29:06] life and crazy busy schedule, that's
[1:29:09] when God can deal with you. God is not
[1:29:11] far away from us. Amen. He is in us. He
[1:29:14] is with us. But we are so busy. The
[1:29:16] noise was in the politics of the day. H
[1:29:20] just talk about the we don't want to
[1:29:21] even go into it. And so many things
[1:29:23] around the world can take you off from
[1:29:25] what God want to do. But remember our
[1:29:27] economy is not American economy. Amen.
[1:29:30] Our economy is from heaven. Amen. It
[1:29:33] never runs dry. The the dollar can fail.
[1:29:36] America can fail. The global economy can
[1:29:39] fail. But Jesus Christ will not fail
[1:29:41] you. Amen. He can rain rice and beans
[1:29:44] for you if he has to.
[1:29:47] You can be walking, you don't have money
[1:29:48] to buy, and you see a sack of rice.
[1:29:51] Where's it come from? Is it for
[1:29:52] somebody? No, it's for you. Amen. For
[1:29:55] you and your family. Amen. And I I've
[1:29:57] had it before. When I was in UK, I was
[1:29:59] going to work and I had a workman. We
[1:30:01] call it workman those time and I forgot
[1:30:03] to take batteries and I was sitting in a
[1:30:05] train. I said, "Oh my." Cuz I love to
[1:30:07] listen to tape and I said, "I'm going to
[1:30:10] work for 14 hours and I don't have
[1:30:12] batteries." And some look under in the
[1:30:14] seat. I look at the seat. There were
[1:30:16] batteries. I was sitting on the
[1:30:17] batteries. Is it for somebody? It's
[1:30:20] nobody. I grab I think two or three I
[1:30:23] grabbed them, put in my workman and
[1:30:25] started listening. Amen. Amen. God is a
[1:30:29] creator.
[1:30:34] When he shall appear, we shall be like
[1:30:36] him. I've not even go to the sermon yet.
[1:30:38] Amen. Amen. But when God has appeared,
[1:30:40] you be like him. He has appeared and you
[1:30:42] are him. Amen. Don't be afraid to stand
[1:30:45] in your post of duty. What the Lord has
[1:30:47] called you to be. Amen. The world the
[1:30:50] world doesn't give the world doesn't
[1:30:51] care about you. They don't have to ask
[1:30:54] your permission to do what they do. You
[1:30:56] think about the world, the cosmos world.
[1:30:58] Everything they want to do, they do it.
[1:31:00] There's no shame. Since that were
[1:31:02] shameful in about 50 years now, it's
[1:31:05] like, how do I say it? It's like they
[1:31:08] advertise it. It's free show. Amen. So,
[1:31:11] you don't have to be ashamed. You don't
[1:31:13] have to like get permission. You don't
[1:31:15] have to be parted on on the back of the
[1:31:17] world before you do what you need to do.
[1:31:18] Be who God has made you to be. Amen.
[1:31:21] Don't be ashamed of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:31:24] If you are ashamed of him, he'll be
[1:31:25] ashamed of you. But accept your call.
[1:31:28] Amen. You might not be accepted by
[1:31:30] society, the way you dress. You might
[1:31:32] not be accepted by your neighbors the
[1:31:33] way you carry yourself. But be a
[1:31:35] brother. Be a sister. Be a son of God.
[1:31:37] Be a daughter of God. Be Mrs. Jesus
[1:31:40] Christ. Be Jesus Christ.
[1:31:46] [Applause]
[1:31:48] God,
[1:31:51] God has called you to be who you are.
[1:31:52] Amen. Amen. So, we had a wonderful time
[1:31:55] on the mountain. Let me see. I don't
[1:31:57] even have my notebook. Where is there?
[1:32:00] Glory to God.
[1:32:03] Just to guide me a little bit. We go to
[1:32:04] the PowerPoint. So, let's let's uh let's
[1:32:08] probably read a scripture now.
[1:32:11] Amen. If you can be on our feet and then
[1:32:15] read wherever the Lord will take us, we
[1:32:18] go. Amen. And if the Lord makes a way,
[1:32:20] we can go forward. So let's read the
[1:32:23] first scripture from 1 John
[1:32:27] 3:1-3. That is where the sermon came
[1:32:30] from. When Christ who is our life shall
[1:32:33] appear, then shall we also appear with
[1:32:35] him. So Colossians, oh sorry, 1 John,
[1:32:38] I'm at the wrong place. 1 John chapter
[1:32:42] 3 verse
[1:32:45] 1-3. Brother Jack, would you like to
[1:32:47] read for us?
[1:32:49] Behold, what man of
[1:32:52] love
[1:32:53] hath hath what manner of love the father
[1:32:57] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:32:58] called the sons of God. Therefore the
[1:33:01] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:33:03] not. Beloved, we now are we the sons of
[1:33:07] God, and it does not yet appear what we
[1:33:09] shall be. But we know that when he shall
[1:33:12] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[1:33:16] shall see him as he is. And every man
[1:33:18] that hath this hope in him purifith
[1:33:20] himself even as he is pure.
[1:33:25] God bless you my brother. Amen. So you
[1:33:28] may take your seat
[1:33:29] please. So when he shall this was in the
[1:33:32] apha age. Apha age was between AD33 and
[1:33:35] AD55 when the church was the day of
[1:33:38] Pentecost. This was the foundation when
[1:33:41] the Lord was building his church. So the
[1:33:43] lord move upon the heart of John to
[1:33:46] imprint this word that when he h we
[1:33:49] don't know what even we because they
[1:33:51] were stuck they don't know the building
[1:33:52] is just in construction they were just l
[1:33:54] the foundation so he said does not yet
[1:33:55] appear what we shall be but when he
[1:33:58] shall appear we shall be with him we
[1:34:01] shall be like him amen and let's read
[1:34:03] another scripture Colossians 3:1-4
[1:34:06] quickly he said if he then be risen with
[1:34:09] Christ seek those things those things
[1:34:12] which are above where Christ siteth on
[1:34:15] the right hand of God. Two, set your
[1:34:17] affections on things above, not on
[1:34:19] things on this earth. Three, for ye are
[1:34:22] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:34:24] God. Four, when Christ who is our life
[1:34:27] shall appear, then shall we also appear
[1:34:30] with him in glory. So first John 3:1
[1:34:34] said, "When he appears, we shall be like
[1:34:35] him and we shall see him at his seat."
[1:34:37] Because you have the revelation, the
[1:34:38] eagle revelation. So when you got a
[1:34:40] revelation of who you are, then you can
[1:34:43] manifest like him. Amen. And I remember
[1:34:45] we all remember the story, the eagle
[1:34:47] story. Abraham talk about that a mother
[1:34:49] eagle had a eggs and the farmer took one
[1:34:52] of the eggs and put them under chicken.
[1:34:54] But the eagle by election know that he
[1:34:57] has an igllet somewhere. So when the
[1:34:59] right time came for the mother to go
[1:35:01] hunt for the igllet, he went around the
[1:35:04] area, the farms. The igllet didn't know
[1:35:06] who her mother was. She was just thought
[1:35:09] her mother was the chicken. They tried
[1:35:11] to eat worms and whatever they can eat
[1:35:14] on the ground. But he didn't know no
[1:35:17] know better. But then when the mother
[1:35:19] eagle came I mean around in the sky and
[1:35:22] cry out yell out a cry. Then something
[1:35:25] on the inside he look at himself. He
[1:35:28] look at his wings he look at his beak.
[1:35:30] He look at the mother above. He said now
[1:35:32] I know my mother. The chicken wasn't my
[1:35:35] mother. That's right. That's right.
[1:35:37] Amen. She was just trying to make me
[1:35:39] believe. Amen. But the chicken is I'm
[1:35:42] not a chicken. That's right. I'm an
[1:35:43] iglet. But she's never flown before. He
[1:35:45] doesn't know how what it means to fly.
[1:35:47] He got a wings. Maybe when he was in the
[1:35:49] pen, he tried to fly. The mother, "No,
[1:35:50] no, no. We don't do this here. Just just
[1:35:52] walk around. Just clock around. We don't
[1:35:54] fly here. Don't do that. You can't go
[1:35:56] that." So he never used the the wings.
[1:35:59] He didn't know the feathers. He didn't
[1:36:00] know what it meant for. But then here is
[1:36:02] mother big igllet in the sky flopping
[1:36:05] its wings and said daughter fly up
[1:36:08] higher. He said mom how do you just set
[1:36:11] your wings and loosening yourself is in
[1:36:13] you is the law of God in your nature
[1:36:16] and this igllet lose herself and she
[1:36:19] begin to flop her wings and flew to
[1:36:21] where her mother is. When he shall
[1:36:23] appear we shall be like him
[1:36:27] and he has appeared and we are him.
[1:36:29] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[1:36:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:36:35] let's go to uh Hosea 6:1.
[1:36:40] Let's see how the Lord in the dimensions
[1:36:42] appeared, how he save us. We go to some
[1:36:44] scriptures and some quotes. Hosea 61-3.
[1:36:48] He said, "Come and let us return unto
[1:36:50] the Lord for he has torn and he will
[1:36:52] heal us. He has smith smitten and he
[1:36:55] will bind us up." So sometime the Lord
[1:36:57] who who tears up. It's not the devil.
[1:37:01] The devil just an action. He's just an
[1:37:03] executor.
[1:37:05] He's just acting under orders. The devil
[1:37:08] cannot attack you, attack your family
[1:37:10] without permission from the from from
[1:37:12] the Lord. So don't worry about the
[1:37:15] devil. Focus on the Lord. Amen. When you
[1:37:17] focus on the when you focus on the Lord,
[1:37:20] oh God bless you, brother Quinton, for
[1:37:22] your sermon. He said, "Don't worship
[1:37:24] your circumstances. And so then what we
[1:37:26] do is that we worship the circumstances
[1:37:28] and leave the Lord behind. Oh my, that
[1:37:31] was powerful. Amen. If you focus on the
[1:37:34] devil, the devil want you to focus on
[1:37:36] him to let you know how big he is. How
[1:37:38] he can put you down. He can depress you,
[1:37:41] make you sick. I mean, destroy your
[1:37:43] family, destroy your marriage, destroy
[1:37:45] your church, whatever, destroy your
[1:37:47] business. But when you focus on the
[1:37:49] Lord, you delete the the devil out of
[1:37:50] the equation.
[1:37:52] He's not in the equation. Amen. You know
[1:37:54] that whatever has happened, the Lord
[1:37:55] permitted it. And the Lord who allowed a
[1:37:57] trial, just like the Bible said that he
[1:37:59] smitten, he let the devil smite you so
[1:38:02] that the attribute of healing can come
[1:38:04] out of you. So that something in you can
[1:38:06] come out of you. Some divine attribute
[1:38:09] will be made manifest. If the devil
[1:38:11] didn't strike Jesus Christ, he wouldn't
[1:38:14] have known that he was a savior.
[1:38:16] Amen. Amen. So the devil has to strike
[1:38:18] Jesus Christ. When he was in the the
[1:38:21] house of h palace of pilot, he said I
[1:38:25] have the authority to resist. No, you
[1:38:27] don't have no authority over me. If the
[1:38:29] pill in me didn't allow it, you wouldn't
[1:38:31] you you have no authority over me. Amen.
[1:38:33] And that's where we should come to.
[1:38:35] Amen. That whatever comes our way, if
[1:38:37] the Lord didn't permit it, it would
[1:38:39] never have come our way. Amen. And if
[1:38:42] the Lord permitted it, he has a way of
[1:38:44] escape for you. Amen. Yeah. He's trying
[1:38:47] to do something that you didn't even
[1:38:48] know. There's a quality in you that has
[1:38:51] never manifested in your life before.
[1:38:54] And the Lord is bringing that quality
[1:38:55] out. And how can that quality out come
[1:38:57] out without a trial? Amen. Without an
[1:39:01] affliction. Amen. Of course, we don't
[1:39:03] have afflictions. Even Jesus,
[1:39:05] he was 100% human being, right? He he
[1:39:08] was 100% God and 100% 100% funny. 100%
[1:39:12] human being. Amen. So when the trial
[1:39:14] came so became so strong fierce for him
[1:39:17] he said Lord he prayed he didn't pray to
[1:39:20] God in the sky God was in him he said
[1:39:23] Lord father if be your will let this
[1:39:25] come let this suffering because he could
[1:39:27] see the demons anointed demons in people
[1:39:31] coming to what destroy his life and he
[1:39:34] cherish his life remember when I will
[1:39:36] come to that sermon but I'm going ahead
[1:39:37] of myself when he was in the temple
[1:39:40] preaching and sometime he say certain
[1:39:42] words let destroy this temple in 3 days
[1:39:45] I'll raise up and so this a blasphemy
[1:39:47] this temple was built in 40 years and
[1:39:49] you going to destroy it and build it one
[1:39:51] day they pick rocks that's right and
[1:39:53] then what the flesh it wasn't time ready
[1:39:56] yet so he dropped the f the cosmos flesh
[1:39:59] he drop it out and the theophony will be
[1:40:02] maybe in royal palm or in loxahachi or
[1:40:07] in Orlando maybe that's where he lives
[1:40:10] in Orlando and then the flesh will come
[1:40:12] back to his body. My brother, my sister,
[1:40:14] that attribute is in you. Amen. That is
[1:40:16] your rapturing faith. Amen. Everything
[1:40:19] you need is already in you. Amen. It's
[1:40:21] not coming from the skies. It's not
[1:40:23] coming from outside. The kingdom of God
[1:40:26] is within you. Amen. Amen. So Jesus
[1:40:29] cried, Lord, let this cup pass over me.
[1:40:32] And the Bible said that Moses and angels
[1:40:34] came to minister. Moses and Elijah came
[1:40:37] around that Lord, please go to Calvary.
[1:40:39] If you don't go to Calvary, we all
[1:40:41] doomed. in the whole mankind to
[1:40:42] strengthen him this almighty God. So
[1:40:45] there's nothing wrong when you cry but
[1:40:46] after you done your crying raise up as a
[1:40:49] daughter of God and speak as a theophony
[1:40:52] and speak as a redeemer and speak as the
[1:40:54] Lord Jesus Christ. Cry all you want.
[1:40:56] Jesus cried. Yes. When Lazarus died his
[1:40:59] best friend, one of his friend died. He
[1:41:01] cried. The Bible say and Jesus wept.
[1:41:04] That's right. That was the only place it
[1:41:05] looks like we saw that the Bible said
[1:41:07] Jesus wept because he was a human being.
[1:41:09] But after he wept, what did he do? He
[1:41:12] cleaned himself up, dried the tears. And
[1:41:14] I said, "There's more than crying in me.
[1:41:16] There's more than pain in me. There's
[1:41:18] more than defeat in me. There's more
[1:41:20] than sorry me. I am the pillar of fire."
[1:41:23] So now he came back into a pillar of
[1:41:24] fire. He said, "Lazarus,
[1:41:27] death, grief, cancer, stomach pains,
[1:41:30] whatever, diabetes, blood pressure, e
[1:41:35] whatever, whatever you have, menstrual
[1:41:37] problem. Amen. a a baroness infertility
[1:41:41] in the name of Jesus Christ just he
[1:41:44] didn't even have to add the name of
[1:41:45] Jesus Christ he said depart and Lazarus
[1:41:49] who was dead 4 days came from the grave
[1:41:52] amen are you dead four days you are not
[1:41:54] dead four days amen greater is in you
[1:41:58] than the the death greater is in you
[1:42:01] than the world greater is in you than
[1:42:03] your trials greater is in you than your
[1:42:05] circumstances
[1:42:07] glory hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:42:09] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:42:12] Lord. Glory. So as we continue to verse
[1:42:15] two, he said after two days will he
[1:42:17] revive us. In the third day, he raises
[1:42:20] up and we shall live in his sight. Then
[1:42:23] three, then we shall then shall we know
[1:42:25] if we follow on to know the Lord. If you
[1:42:27] love him and want to know more about
[1:42:29] him, his going forth is prepared as the
[1:42:31] morning. He shall come onto us as the
[1:42:33] rain as the latter and the former rain
[1:42:35] onto the earth. Amen. That was a
[1:42:38] dispensation. God first came h we grew
[1:42:42] some quotes. God comes three times. The
[1:42:44] first time he comes to redeem his wife.
[1:42:47] The second time he comes what? Take what
[1:42:49] is redeemed. And the third time he comes
[1:42:52] with his wife. It's just like you buy
[1:42:54] things from Amazon. When you buy things
[1:42:56] from online, the moment you purchase,
[1:42:58] you let your credit card, debit card,
[1:43:00] whatever you buy it, that laptop, that
[1:43:05] dress, that shoe, that suit is not
[1:43:08] doesn't belong to Amazon anymore. It
[1:43:10] doesn't belong to a third party. It
[1:43:11] belongs to you.
[1:43:13] Because your credit card has gone. Your
[1:43:16] money $100 has been taken. So now,
[1:43:19] Amazon quickly, you see that it's now
[1:43:20] going to what? Shipment. So you look at
[1:43:22] the status, it shipped. You keep
[1:43:23] monitoring, tracking, ship. Maybe
[1:43:25] sometime they ship you to some people
[1:43:27] live in a I would say the hood where
[1:43:30] when things come in front of your
[1:43:32] house, the real owner will pick it up.
[1:43:36] So if you live in the hood, you don't
[1:43:37] let things come in front of your door
[1:43:39] because the owner himself or herself
[1:43:41] will take it take it away. So you let it
[1:43:43] they send it to Walmart to Burlington to
[1:43:47] different location then you go grab your
[1:43:49] stuff. So when you order it, you have
[1:43:52] redeem it. All right. And then you go to
[1:43:54] Walmart. They ship it to Walmart. They
[1:43:56] have some curios over there. You go
[1:43:58] there and the Walmart people will give
[1:43:59] it to you. Okay. They look at your
[1:44:01] right. You go and take whatever your
[1:44:03] shoes, your dress, your whatever you
[1:44:05] ordered for and now you bring it home
[1:44:07] and now what do you do? You don't buy a
[1:44:09] shoe dress and just leave it in the
[1:44:11] wardrobe for 10 years. No. Now you have
[1:44:13] to what? Dress it. And now the shoe, the
[1:44:16] dress, the the suit has become part of
[1:44:18] you. and now you walk with it. The Lord
[1:44:21] does the same thing. The Lord's like buy
[1:44:23] from Amazon. We were on on on Amazon and
[1:44:25] the Lord ordered. No, this is my son.
[1:44:28] This is my thy daughter. Amen. By
[1:44:31] election,
[1:44:33] there are a lot of things you could have
[1:44:34] bought from Amazon.
[1:44:36] I need to redeem this person from
[1:44:38] Amazon.
[1:44:40] She cannot be on Amazon forever. She
[1:44:42] cannot be sitting in New York or Dallas
[1:44:44] for forever. She need to be shipped to
[1:44:46] West Palm Beach. So the Lord goes online
[1:44:49] from heaven and tell the preacher, "My
[1:44:52] servant Jagdav, go preach to this
[1:44:54] person, my servant e brother smiley, go
[1:44:57] preach to this person." And then you
[1:44:59] send a word quickly. There's a
[1:45:01] quickening. Now you begin to move. Amen.
[1:45:04] It's ordered. The receipt is paid. The
[1:45:05] price have been paid on Calvary. So from
[1:45:08] Calvary, Satan has no possession. Amen.
[1:45:11] Amazon has no possession over you. Amen.
[1:45:14] Satan has to release you. Just like
[1:45:16] Amazon has to ship the item to your
[1:45:18] house. Satan has to release you. And
[1:45:20] then from there you come, you begin to
[1:45:22] know yourself. Oh wow. I didn't even
[1:45:23] know I belong to Jagdav.
[1:45:26] I didn't know I belong to Sister Bur.
[1:45:28] All right. I didn't know I belong to
[1:45:29] sister V. I didn't know I belong to
[1:45:31] brother Smiley. All right. Because you
[1:45:33] belong to him. Amen. There were
[1:45:35] thousands and millions of things on
[1:45:37] Amazon. But you just buy a Bible. Yes.
[1:45:40] that by even things that we do natural
[1:45:42] is by election. You go to the store a
[1:45:45] lot of dresses different colors but you
[1:45:47] go pick a particular dress a particular
[1:45:50] shoe a particular color of toothbrush
[1:45:53] because that is by election. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:55] Amen. Glory hallelujah to the Lord.
[1:45:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now
[1:46:01] let's go to yes let's go to uh is it
[1:46:04] Acts 8 26 to 40. Philillip when he shall
[1:46:08] appear. Now when he came in the omega
[1:46:11] sorry the alpha age the Lord begin to
[1:46:13] show himself. Remember the disciple
[1:46:15] before the Holy Ghost baptism they were
[1:46:17] doing all kind of the Lord gave them
[1:46:18] power to heal the sick to pre the gospel
[1:46:20] but they were not born again. So their
[1:46:22] behavior shows that they were not born
[1:46:24] again. They were fighting among one
[1:46:25] another who is big in the kingdom of God
[1:46:27] who want to sit on the right hand and
[1:46:29] the left hand. This woman will come Lord
[1:46:31] let my children sit on the left hand and
[1:46:32] different things. Peter will cut
[1:46:34] somebody's ears but later when they knew
[1:46:37] their position they were different.
[1:46:39] Amen. So let's go to uh Actap 8 verse 26
[1:46:43] to 40. This about Philip Philip and
[1:46:46] Ethiopian Enoch. He said now an angel of
[1:46:48] the Lord said unto Philillip rise and go
[1:46:50] toward the south to the road that goes
[1:46:52] down from Jerusalem to Gaza. Gaza is
[1:46:54] where the battle is. This is a desert
[1:46:56] place. And he rose and went. And there
[1:46:59] was an Ethiopian and Enoch, a court
[1:47:01] official of Candice, Queen of the
[1:47:03] Ethiopians, who was in charge of a
[1:47:05] treasure. He had come to Jerusalem. He
[1:47:07] was like a treasury secretary. He's got
[1:47:09] money. So he's come to Jerusalem to
[1:47:11] worship and was returning seated in his
[1:47:14] chariot. And he was reading. He was like
[1:47:17] a private jet. You know, in those time
[1:47:18] having a chariot is like having a
[1:47:20] private jet. So this man was loaded. He
[1:47:23] was well to do and he was a seed of God.
[1:47:25] Amen. But now he said reading the
[1:47:27] prophet Isaiah 29 and the spirit said
[1:47:30] unto Philillip go over and join his
[1:47:32] chariot. So Philillip ran to him ran to
[1:47:35] him and heard him reading Isaiah the
[1:47:37] prophet and asked do you understand what
[1:47:39] you are reading? And he said how can I
[1:47:42] unless someone guides me and invited
[1:47:45] Philip to come up and sit with him. Now
[1:47:48] the passage of the scripture that he was
[1:47:49] reading was like a sheep he was led to
[1:47:52] the slaughter and like a lamb before its
[1:47:54] sher is silent. So he opens not his
[1:47:57] mouth. 33 In his humiliation justice was
[1:47:59] denied him. Who can describe his
[1:48:01] generation? For his life is taken away
[1:48:03] from the earth. 34 And the uno said to
[1:48:06] Philillip about whom I ask you does the
[1:48:08] prophet say this about himself or about
[1:48:11] someone else. Then Philip opened his
[1:48:13] mouth and beginning with his scripture
[1:48:16] with this scripture he told him the good
[1:48:18] news about Jesus. And as they were going
[1:48:21] along the road, they came to some water.
[1:48:23] And the unk said, "See, here is water.
[1:48:25] What prevent me from being baptized?" 38
[1:48:28] And he commanded the chariot to stop.
[1:48:30] And they both went down into the water.
[1:48:32] And Philip and Uno, he baptized him. And
[1:48:35] when they came up out of the water, the
[1:48:37] spirit of the Lord carried Philip away.
[1:48:39] And the unk saw him no more. He went on
[1:48:41] his way rejoicing. But Philillip, this
[1:48:44] is why I want you to take a note. But
[1:48:45] Philillip found himself at Azo. And as
[1:48:48] he passed through, he preached the
[1:48:50] gospel to all the towns until he came to
[1:48:53] Cesaria. This is the English standard
[1:48:55] version. If you read the Kingdom
[1:48:56] version, the split raptured Philillip.
[1:48:58] Yeah. From where he baptized Ethopian
[1:49:00] Enoch in Gaza to Azatos. Right. Now, the
[1:49:04] rapturion faith is already in you. Yeah.
[1:49:06] Exactly. Glory. Hallelujah. Right.
[1:49:08] Before the foundation of the world, God
[1:49:10] has ordained you a man of God under his
[1:49:13] ministry that you get the Holy Ghost
[1:49:14] baptism. Amen. You are not here by
[1:49:17] mistake. Amen. Amen. Brother Jack Dove
[1:49:19] didn't become pastor Doc when he was 20
[1:49:23] 20 something years ago in his family.
[1:49:24] No. But as smart didn't become a pastor
[1:49:26] when he start ministering 20 something
[1:49:28] years ago. But way before the foundation
[1:49:30] of the world run through your ancestry
[1:49:32] your grandparent great grandparent to
[1:49:34] Adam before even Adam came to earth he
[1:49:37] was ordained a minister of God to feed
[1:49:40] you. Amen. Amen. And you can never
[1:49:42] receive the Holy Ghost anywhere else.
[1:49:44] You might pass through other ministry
[1:49:46] but God has ordained you where you get
[1:49:49] the Holy Ghost baptism. Amen. Amen. And
[1:49:52] you have to love your pastor, your
[1:49:53] ministers, because under his wing, you
[1:49:56] going to get Christ in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:59] The Tubian Enoch didn't get the Holy
[1:50:01] Ghost baptism under Peter.
[1:50:04] The Lord ordained Philillip at the right
[1:50:07] time, at the right place, at the right
[1:50:09] season. And Philip has to be there. And
[1:50:12] this man had a desire. is just been
[1:50:14] going to the temple hearing the same old
[1:50:16] same old about you know the Messiah is
[1:50:19] coming Messiah will come and the Messiah
[1:50:21] has already come and they still read the
[1:50:23] temple like he's going to come and there
[1:50:25] was something boiling in his heart
[1:50:27] because he was an igllet and the Lord
[1:50:29] said Phillip go speak to him that's
[1:50:31] right and he went to bring the gospel
[1:50:34] the good news to this man right and the
[1:50:36] quickening power began and he was
[1:50:38] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:39] Christ do you want to receive the Holy
[1:50:41] Ghost the Bible said repent amen and be
[1:50:43] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:45] Christ. And you shall receive the gift
[1:50:46] of the Holy Ghost. Young, young, young
[1:50:48] young sisters, young brothers. If you
[1:50:49] want the Holy Ghost baptism, old and
[1:50:51] young alike, repent and be baptized.
[1:50:55] Have your pastor baptize you in the name
[1:50:56] of the Lord. And you shall, you don't
[1:50:58] have to be 30 years before you can
[1:50:59] receive the Holy Ghost. No, there's not
[1:51:01] anything like that. You can't be 12
[1:51:02] years and receive the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:51:04] even better when you receive it when you
[1:51:05] are 12. Amen. So that Christ will keep
[1:51:08] you from the things of the world. Amen.
[1:51:10] Amen.
[1:51:12] Amen. You don't have to wait till 30
[1:51:13] years when you've been in jail. You've
[1:51:15] got felon. You you you've got done all
[1:51:17] kind of things and then now you receive
[1:51:19] it. Yes. God will forgive you. But
[1:51:21] Caesar will always chase you for being a
[1:51:22] felon. You can't do certain jobs. You
[1:51:25] can't do certain things because you've
[1:51:27] got felon on your record. There was a
[1:51:29] gentleman I was working with. He loved a
[1:51:31] job and they found out they got a felon.
[1:51:33] They let him go. He's no longer the
[1:51:35] person you used to be. But Caesar will
[1:51:38] always chase after you. Amen. So if you
[1:51:40] have got the grace to protect yourself
[1:51:42] even in the worldly things, please
[1:51:44] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:51:47] the Lord Jesus Christ. And as your
[1:51:49] pastor preaches to you, the pill of fire
[1:51:51] will baptize you. Amen. And you begin to
[1:51:54] do the things of the Lord. Jesus wasn't
[1:51:56] he didn't start when he was 30 years. He
[1:51:58] started 70 minutes. But at the age of
[1:52:00] 12, the father, the holy ghost quicken
[1:52:03] him and begin to break bread in the
[1:52:05] temple. Amen. Amen. So the Holy Ghost
[1:52:08] when he Jesus appeared when he was on
[1:52:10] earth he said I will go but I'll come
[1:52:12] back when I I will not leave you
[1:52:14] comforters I'll be with you even in you
[1:52:18] so Jesus was in Philillip who can be
[1:52:21] raptured Jesus did the same thing Philip
[1:52:24] and Cody were with Jesus they saw Jesus
[1:52:26] rapturing himself when the Pharisees
[1:52:28] Sadducey wanted to stone him and
[1:52:30] appeared in some place appear and
[1:52:32] disappear it's just a character of us
[1:52:34] it's not a mystery amen Amen. We are
[1:52:37] only growing to understand it. Amen.
[1:52:39] Sometime people get so toned about
[1:52:40] rapture. Oh, will I meet the rapture?
[1:52:42] You are the rapture. Amen. Amen. Rapture
[1:52:45] is not an event. Amen. Rapture is a
[1:52:48] person of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:50] Resurrection is not an event that is
[1:52:52] going to be a global resurrection one
[1:52:54] day and all the churches we warm up.
[1:52:55] Hey, there's going to be resurrection.
[1:52:56] I'm going to see my grandma. I'm going
[1:52:58] to see my great grandma. I'm going to
[1:52:59] see whoever. No, it's not going to be
[1:53:01] like that. God doesn't work in public
[1:53:03] show. But the resurrection is already
[1:53:06] planted in you. Amen. The new birth is
[1:53:10] in you. Amen. Jesus Christ is in you.
[1:53:12] Amen. All the blessing that you are
[1:53:14] praying for is in you. Healing is in
[1:53:16] you. Amen. The pastor pray for you not
[1:53:20] because he's putting the healing in you.
[1:53:21] But the healing is in you. He's
[1:53:22] anointing your faith to receive the
[1:53:25] healing that you already have. Glory.
[1:53:27] Hallelujah. That's why you have to give
[1:53:28] yourself to the Lord. Amen. Amen. There
[1:53:31] used to be a time I used to listen
[1:53:32] Abraham's healing service and when he
[1:53:34] was praying especially he has to b he
[1:53:37] said there's here is a religious demon
[1:53:39] people are educated but a lot of spirit
[1:53:42] here because people are intellectual in
[1:53:44] their minds it's a good place like India
[1:53:47] just one sermon and thousands of people
[1:53:49] are healed right but in America he has
[1:53:51] to press himself he has to fight through
[1:53:53] he has to lift the people I mean
[1:53:55] encourage them lift them up until he get
[1:53:57] to a place and now said now it's milky
[1:54:00] He said if there was a time he said if
[1:54:01] you can even believe halfway you don't
[1:54:03] have to believe all the way halfway
[1:54:06] because God need your your belief your
[1:54:08] acceptance of him God doesn't force
[1:54:10] himself but he need you yourself like a
[1:54:13] woman acceptance a man cannot come and
[1:54:16] grab you from your parents hey I want to
[1:54:17] go marry you take you to the church or
[1:54:19] court and marries you no it doesn't work
[1:54:20] that way he need your acceptance even if
[1:54:22] it's unwillingly right the sisters know
[1:54:24] you need some acceptance amen so God
[1:54:27] need our acceptance
[1:54:29] And when you get even halfway, I'm not
[1:54:32] all that sure. I'm not sure about this
[1:54:34] Holy Ghost experience. I don't know how
[1:54:36] it's going to do to me, but I could see
[1:54:37] it. I feel good. Amen. I don't go to the
[1:54:40] clubhouse. I don't drink. You go to the
[1:54:42] clubhouse. You come depressed. You want
[1:54:43] to commit suicide.
[1:54:46] Because you go with few demons and you
[1:54:48] go and carry more demons.
[1:54:51] Cuz all the people in the clubhouse have
[1:54:53] got spirits. That's right. And you go
[1:54:55] dancing and think you are happy. Yes.
[1:54:57] You get excited. You dance, you come
[1:54:59] back and those demons are hunting you.
[1:55:02] You are depressed, suppressed,
[1:55:04] oppressed, and you feel suicide. I want
[1:55:06] to take your life. You don't want to
[1:55:08] live anymore. But God want to bring you
[1:55:11] and sprinkle waters of living waters and
[1:55:14] wash these demons out of your life and
[1:55:16] he the pillar of fire, the almighty God
[1:55:19] plant himself in you, my brother, my
[1:55:20] sister, and you become a new creation.
[1:55:23] You are not the old person that used to
[1:55:24] be, but everything is new. Amen. When
[1:55:27] you are walking, is Almighty God
[1:55:28] working? Amen. When you speak, it's not
[1:55:30] your word. It's Jesus Christ speaking in
[1:55:32] your heart. Amen. And that's what God is
[1:55:35] doing in our lives. You are not a
[1:55:37] mistake. Amen.
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:43] All right. You are not an accident. It
[1:55:45] doesn't matter how you were brought on
[1:55:46] this earth. That's right. It doesn't
[1:55:48] matter how you were brought on this
[1:55:50] earth. It doesn't matter how many
[1:55:52] mistakes you've made. Amenus. Your
[1:55:54] mistakes can never delete your election.
[1:56:01] [Applause]
[1:56:04] Thank you, Lord. All your sins, all your
[1:56:07] mistakes can never delete your election.
[1:56:11] It will never delete your calling to
[1:56:12] Christ. Amen. Neither your righteousness
[1:56:16] will bring election to your life. It's
[1:56:18] just fulfilling it. Look at Moses, a
[1:56:20] brother of God. His mother educated him.
[1:56:23] But Moses end up killing someone. He was
[1:56:26] a murderer. But he defeated himself. He
[1:56:29] ran away. But even in his runaway
[1:56:31] status, God was using him. He didn't. He
[1:56:34] wanted like he thought like I'm failed.
[1:56:36] God is going to use Aaron, Joshua, some
[1:56:40] of the brothers to do the job. I'm a
[1:56:42] failure.
[1:56:44] When the right time came, the pill of
[1:56:45] fire appeared. Moses. Moses. Right.
[1:56:48] Yeah. The ground you are standing is on
[1:56:50] holy ground. Amen. Right. He said,
[1:56:52] "Remove your shoes." What shoes? Not
[1:56:54] just the physical shoe, but remove your
[1:56:56] thinking. Praise God. Delete those
[1:56:58] thinking. That I'm a murderer. I cannot
[1:57:02] do this. I called you before the
[1:57:03] foundation of the world. God.
[1:57:06] Amen.
[1:57:07] God doesn't deal with legalism. God
[1:57:09] knows we are human beings. We make
[1:57:11] mistakes. We It's part of human life.
[1:57:15] But when you make David made all bunch
[1:57:16] of mistakes but never took his
[1:57:18] predestination away. Amen. Even his
[1:57:21] mistakes when he committed adultery and
[1:57:24] committed murder on top, God will show
[1:57:26] mercy unto David because David has a job
[1:57:29] on earth that nobody on this earth can
[1:57:32] do the work of David.
[1:57:34] God will not use his son Solomon to do
[1:57:36] that. No, he's not going to use Aaron to
[1:57:38] do it. He's not going to use Noah. David
[1:57:41] has to do the job. My sister, my
[1:57:43] brother, it doesn't matter how far you
[1:57:45] gone. It doesn't matter your past
[1:57:47] record. what the Lord has ordained for
[1:57:49] you. No, your mistakes cannot delete
[1:57:52] that election. God elected you to that
[1:57:54] position and you and only you can
[1:57:56] fulfill that position. And it's time to
[1:57:58] rise up and say, "Lord, here I am. Send
[1:58:00] me. I'll go." Amen. Whatever you want
[1:58:03] you to do, whatever my sister, in your
[1:58:07] home, in your neighborhood, in the
[1:58:09] ministry, whatever the Lord want you to
[1:58:11] do, my brother, you are the one who's
[1:58:13] doing the job. Amen. Amen. God never
[1:58:16] said David because you have seen enough.
[1:58:18] You have seen so much I cannot use you.
[1:58:20] No. He said you a priest, king and a
[1:58:23] prophet. Right. William Ram was a boxer.
[1:58:28] Is that right? He could have even the
[1:58:30] Lord just protected him. He could have
[1:58:32] been become a murderer. He was
[1:58:33] short-tempered person. That's right.
[1:58:36] Nobody had tempered like him. That's
[1:58:37] right. But he was a prophet of God. God
[1:58:40] used him just the same. Amen. Amen. So
[1:58:43] God is not looking at your mistakes and
[1:58:45] don't look at your mistakes and don't
[1:58:47] look at your brothers and sisters
[1:58:48] mistakes. Look at Christ in them. Amen.
[1:58:52] That God has called my sister to do this
[1:58:54] job. Amen. Cuz if you they said if you
[1:58:56] point one finger on someone, the four
[1:58:59] fingers point back to you. Amen. So you
[1:59:02] think you are so righteous. No. If God
[1:59:04] should show you your record, you were by
[1:59:06] grace. Amen. Amen. It it happened to
[1:59:09] William Abraham. He was condemning a a
[1:59:12] woman and the Lord showed him his
[1:59:13] record. He said, "Oh Lord, just forgive
[1:59:15] me." Amen. So do not point fingers on
[1:59:18] somebody. You cannot. You didn't even
[1:59:20] call yourself. Remember the Bible said
[1:59:23] the one who felt righteous went to pray.
[1:59:25] Oh Lord, you know me. I pay my tithe. I
[1:59:27] come to church every Sunday, Monday,
[1:59:29] whatever. Lord, I'm righteous. I don't
[1:59:31] smoke. I don't drink. I don't curse. And
[1:59:33] the Lord didn't listen to his prayer.
[1:59:35] But the one who went, Lord, he didn't
[1:59:37] even look at the sky. I said, "Lord, you
[1:59:39] know how unworthy I am. Just be
[1:59:42] merciful." And the Bible said his
[1:59:44] prayers ascended to heaven. So don't
[1:59:46] don't justify yourself and disqualify
[1:59:49] your brother or your sister. No. It is
[1:59:51] the Lord who justifies. That's right. If
[1:59:53] the Lord called you and qualifies you,
[1:59:54] do you think the Lord cannot call your
[1:59:56] brother and sister and qualifies him?
[1:59:58] Amen. Cuz you are only using your mind
[2:00:00] and some things that you know. But God
[2:00:02] is calling. It's not about you. Amen.
[2:00:04] It's about him and the person. Amen.
[2:00:06] Amen. You don't have nothing to do with
[2:00:08] it. Amen. You have to answer to your
[2:00:10] calling. Amen. And your brother and
[2:00:11] sister answer to their calling. Amen.
[2:00:13] Amen. Amen. So never speak yourself out
[2:00:17] of the calling of God. Glory to God.
[2:00:20] Hallelujah to the Lord. Sometime we
[2:00:21] don't even understand each other. The
[2:00:23] Lord look at Philillip. The Lord just
[2:00:25] started revival in our human. Phillip,
[2:00:28] you should I mean you should leave this
[2:00:29] man. You just give him the word. You
[2:00:31] should probably go with him and start a
[2:00:34] church in Ethiopia. But the Lord wanted
[2:00:36] him for that purpose. That's right. And
[2:00:38] he needed him in aos. Amen. And sometime
[2:00:41] we wonder why this sister, he was
[2:00:42] supposed to be here, but the sister is
[2:00:44] not doing this, he's doing that. Why is
[2:00:46] this brother? Why is this minister? The
[2:00:47] Lord put desire in our heart. And when
[2:00:49] you finish that calling or that service
[2:00:52] or that purpose, the Lord take it away
[2:00:54] and then put something else in your
[2:00:55] heart to do. So you might think why am I
[2:00:57] not seeing this brother doing this? Why
[2:00:59] don't I see this sister doing this? The
[2:01:00] Lord has changed the ministry. Amen. And
[2:01:02] there's a ministry called the frontier
[2:01:04] ministry. Philip had a frontier
[2:01:06] ministry. The frontier ministry is the
[2:01:08] pace setters. Wow. That was when God was
[2:01:10] ushering the Holy Ghost on earth. The
[2:01:12] true Holy Ghost baptism. Since Adam when
[2:01:14] the fall came, nobody has ever been born
[2:01:16] again. Even the prophet, they had a
[2:01:19] spirit in type. They had a I would say
[2:01:22] Old Testament Holy Ghost. But Christ
[2:01:24] coming to wash away the sin from their
[2:01:26] heart. That's why David, a man after
[2:01:28] God's own heart, could cause commit
[2:01:31] adultery, kill because the new birth
[2:01:34] wasn't there. Look at Peter. When the
[2:01:36] new birth wasn't there, he could cut
[2:01:38] somebody's ears. But when the Holy Ghost
[2:01:40] came and they arrested him, they wanted
[2:01:42] to kill him. Said, "Don't worry. I'm not
[2:01:44] going to run away. I'm ready even to to
[2:01:46] to seal my testimony with my with my
[2:01:49] blood. But I have one request. I'm not
[2:01:51] worthy like my Lord. Turn me upside
[2:01:54] down." That's right.
[2:01:56] Yeah. My god. The simpler who had a
[2:01:59] knife, he's got a pocketk knife in in
[2:02:01] his pocket. You mess with him, you're
[2:02:03] going to lose one of your ears.
[2:02:07] But this man is a different person all
[2:02:08] together that he offered himself. You
[2:02:10] could crucify me. Glory. Look at Paul
[2:02:13] when he was Saul. You don't he rather
[2:02:15] come and attack you and kill you. Yes.
[2:02:17] Because you are preaching the name of
[2:02:18] Jesus Christ. But when he was full of
[2:02:21] the Holy Ghost and even a prophet,
[2:02:23] what's the name? Agabus prophesied the
[2:02:25] Holy Ghost come on Agabus said I saw a
[2:02:27] man whose robe this man if you go to
[2:02:29] Jerusalem going to kill you say oh my
[2:02:31] I'm not discouraged I'm ready to go
[2:02:35] because he had a pill of fire in him
[2:02:38] when the pill of because he know heaven
[2:02:39] heaven is not I oh am I going to make
[2:02:41] the rapture Lord Paul he said I'm not
[2:02:43] worthy even to be called an apostle
[2:02:45] because I wasted the church of God and
[2:02:48] when they were killing is it Steven I
[2:02:50] took the clothes you know they used to
[2:02:51] wear those clothes so that the young
[2:02:54] people could stone Steven. So I'm not
[2:02:55] worthy. I'm a medra. He parttook. That's
[2:02:58] right. Aiden and Abbertan. That's right.
[2:02:59] When you commit a crime, not this, but
[2:03:01] you parttook in some way. We call it
[2:03:03] Aiden and Abbertan. Said I'm a medra.
[2:03:05] But God has made you who I am. His med
[2:03:09] didn't take his election away. He said
[2:03:11] even I work more than Peter. You walk
[2:03:13] with the Lord. You at with the Lord
[2:03:14] physically. You slept with the Lord on
[2:03:16] the beaches. You got a chance to see
[2:03:18] almighty God in flesh and blood. Yeah, I
[2:03:22] didn't get that chance. But by grace,
[2:03:24] Amen. I've worked more than what you you
[2:03:27] guys have done
[2:03:29] because Peter wasn't was a little bit
[2:03:31] legalistic. He didn't want to go to the
[2:03:33] Gentiles. Probably that's why the Lord
[2:03:35] sent Philip to go and baptize the
[2:03:37] Egypian, you know, because Peter had
[2:03:39] like, you know, these people eat they
[2:03:41] eat chicken. You know, those animals
[2:03:43] were not worthy. They eat ducks, they
[2:03:45] eat pigs, brother. To me, go touch them
[2:03:47] and baptize them. That's not holy. That
[2:03:50] was that's Peter's makeup. Yeah. So God
[2:03:53] used Philillip to do the job. God
[2:03:55] brought Paul on the scene. Paul knew how
[2:03:58] to walk with the Jews and also how to
[2:03:59] work with the Gentiles. If he has to cut
[2:04:02] his hair to be like the Jews, you do it.
[2:04:04] But he said, he told Peter, I said,
[2:04:05] Peter, you were supposed to be blamed
[2:04:07] because you are plain hypocrite. He said
[2:04:09] our fathers even couldn't carry the law.
[2:04:11] Why are you taking the law?
[2:04:12] Circumcision, don't eat chicken, washing
[2:04:14] hands. Whatever you touch, you pray
[2:04:17] about it. It's clean. You don't have to
[2:04:19] do those rituals. to wash your hands. If
[2:04:21] by faith you touch it, it's clean. Amen.
[2:04:24] Amen. If I've got faith in the time of
[2:04:27] COVID to go pray for somebody, if your
[2:04:29] faith allows you, you they have CO, they
[2:04:33] have got a germs and a virus and
[2:04:34] whatever. But if you got a faith in you,
[2:04:37] that that COVID spirit cannot touch you.
[2:04:39] Amen. You can go and pray for the person
[2:04:41] with CO and the Lord will heal him.
[2:04:44] Amen.
[2:04:45] So we walk by faith and not by sight.
[2:04:47] Amen. We don't worship circumstances. We
[2:04:50] worship the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:04:52] Hallelujah to the Lord. Blessed be the
[2:04:55] name of the Lord. Let's go a little bit
[2:04:57] further. Now, let's go to the next uh
[2:05:01] quote is
[2:05:03] Jesus. Okay, I think I've gone too far.
[2:05:07] Go to the next one. Let me
[2:05:09] see. There you go. Jesus comes three
[2:05:12] times. H this was dity of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:15] Paragraph 40. Jesus comes three times.
[2:05:18] He came the first to redeem his church.
[2:05:20] He comes the second to receive his
[2:05:22] church. He comes the third with his
[2:05:24] church. Everything in the Bible travel
[2:05:26] in trinities. But in all but all in one
[2:05:30] Christ. He remember the first time to
[2:05:32] redeem his church, the second to receive
[2:05:34] his church, the third with his church as
[2:05:36] king and queen. God reigning in you.
[2:05:40] Amen. Let's go to the next code. Okay.
[2:05:44] uh questions and answers 54 paragraph
[2:05:47] 104 Christ comes the same thing Christ
[2:05:49] comes three times the first he came to
[2:05:51] redeem his church is that right the
[2:05:53] second he comes to receive his church
[2:05:55] your Amazon product that you bought you
[2:05:57] have to when you order it you you've
[2:05:59] redeem it and then when you drop in in
[2:06:01] front of your door or in receive it go
[2:06:04] receive it and then now he brings home
[2:06:06] and use it so the third he comes with
[2:06:08] his church he comes to redeem her he
[2:06:11] comes to rapture her and be caught way
[2:06:13] in the time of place and so forth
[2:06:15] returns back for the millennium lives to
[2:06:18] the millennium. Amen. A millennium is a
[2:06:20] just time element. So God has got three
[2:06:23] steps of redemption from Adam to Jesus
[2:06:25] Christ. That was God coming to redeem
[2:06:29] his church. Blood sacrifices under
[2:06:31] Moses. I mean till Jesus died on the
[2:06:33] cross. That was the last time you could
[2:06:36] sacrifice animals. But when Jesus said
[2:06:39] it is finished, it's over. Just before
[2:06:41] Jesus said you could still sacrifice an
[2:06:43] animal and God will use that. But when
[2:06:45] Jesus said it is finished, those animal
[2:06:47] sacrifices were over. If you sacrifice a
[2:06:50] lamb, a a cow, a whatever, God hasn't
[2:06:54] accepted cuz the lamb of God has been
[2:06:56] sacrificed on Calvary. So that ministry
[2:06:59] has been done away and put in a closet.
[2:07:02] And now the second ministry to receive
[2:07:04] it, that's the Holy Ghost baptism. Under
[2:07:06] the apha church ministry, God used Peter
[2:07:09] AD 20 AD 33 to AD 53 20 year ministry.
[2:07:14] When the Holy Ghost fell, 5,000 people,
[2:07:16] 3,000, they were going through all
[2:07:18] Judea, Jerusalem and preaching the
[2:07:20] gospel and the Holy Ghost fall upon the
[2:07:22] people and people that didn't know God
[2:07:24] now they spoke in tongues. They God was
[2:07:27] manifesting in them. That was the time
[2:07:30] that God was receiving his church under
[2:07:33] seven church age messengers. But now
[2:07:35] after that on sunset mountain that
[2:07:38] ministry it doesn't mean you can't have
[2:07:39] holy ghost but the ministry of the son
[2:07:41] of man son of man is Adam to Jesus son
[2:07:45] of god Jesus to sunset mountain and then
[2:07:47] son of David god reigning in our hearts
[2:07:50] glory hallelujah let's jump
[2:07:53] quickly let's go to the next one I love
[2:07:56] these quotes oh my it's just rich this
[2:08:00] one the new birth let me see yeah the
[2:08:02] new birth is your rapture Christ in you
[2:08:04] you And when Paul said Christ in you,
[2:08:06] the hope of glory, the building is is
[2:08:09] just in in the fundamental stage is not
[2:08:12] been built yet. So they were hoping that
[2:08:14] the capstone. But we can read it
[2:08:16] differently. Christ in you expression of
[2:08:19] glory right now. Amen. It's not in
[2:08:21] future, it's now. Hallelujah. So
[2:08:23] questions and answers
[2:08:25] 95403M paragraph 106. said, "If you are
[2:08:29] filled with the Holy Ghost baptism this
[2:08:31] morning and God's power is moving in
[2:08:34] every fiber of your body, okay, your
[2:08:37] being, what good will it do for you to
[2:08:40] stand in the judgment?" That's the
[2:08:42] question. You are already jed been
[2:08:46] received, filled, and already, now he
[2:08:49] put it, he says it twice, already
[2:08:51] already translated into heavenly places
[2:08:55] with Christ Jesus. Amen. Not you will
[2:08:58] be, you are, you are now. Amen. Right
[2:09:01] now translated. Amen. Right. What is the
[2:09:04] rapture? Translation. Amen. I think one
[2:09:06] time they asked my brother a question.
[2:09:08] He said, "It's just a change." That's
[2:09:10] right. It's just a change. Amen. It's
[2:09:13] not something you imagine. Our mind can
[2:09:14] imagine so many things, but it's not
[2:09:16] imagination. It's the reality of Christ
[2:09:18] in you. If Christ need to let's say they
[2:09:21] send military to come and crush all of
[2:09:23] us, the Holy Ghost can break the flesh
[2:09:27] and all of us will be in uh Africa, in
[2:09:31] Asia, in New York. And when all of us
[2:09:35] are going to New York, remember we're
[2:09:37] just in West Palm. It's nothing
[2:09:39] difficult with the Lord. Amen. The same
[2:09:41] God that heal your body is the same God
[2:09:43] that can change your body. Amen. It's
[2:09:45] nothing strange. It's nothing we
[2:09:47] imagine. But when we're the
[2:09:48] denominational churches, the way they
[2:09:49] preach and we still preach the same
[2:09:50] rapture. I mean, as we were preaching
[2:09:52] the denominational church, no, the
[2:09:54] rapture is what? Christ in you. Amen.
[2:09:56] It's not an event coming from the sky.
[2:09:58] Resurrection is what? A person of Christ
[2:10:00] in you. Glory. Hallelujah. And if you
[2:10:03] can take it, let's go to the next quotes
[2:10:06] right quick. And that was Christ coming
[2:10:09] three times. He said future home 64
[2:10:12] paragraph 374. Now God made three
[2:10:14] Bibles. There's a primary teaching that
[2:10:16] is bogus. That is nonsense. But there's
[2:10:18] a genuine pyramid. Notice God, God first
[2:10:21] Bible, he made three. There have to be
[2:10:23] everything in three because three is
[2:10:25] perfection. Jesus Christ come three
[2:10:27] times. Come once to redeem his bride.
[2:10:29] Next time to get his bride, next time
[2:10:31] with his bride. Amen. Now let's go to
[2:10:34] the next quotes. And that is going to
[2:10:36] talk about the Aquarius ministry, the
[2:10:38] eagle ministry that we are we are in.
[2:10:40] And we wrap it up quickly. The re the
[2:10:43] revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:45] 60204m 190. So when he was on earth let
[2:10:49] drink some
[2:10:56] water. Glory hallelujah. Amen.
[2:11:00] When he was on earth he was a
[2:11:03] prophet. The faithful
[2:11:06] witness. The Bible calls him later. A
[2:11:08] faithful witness is this prophet. He was
[2:11:10] a priest. He's a priest. Now, when he
[2:11:12] comes, he'll be a king. 191. If you go,
[2:11:15] if you get over, read Revelation 15:3.
[2:11:18] You can see in Revelation 15:3. Let's
[2:11:20] turn over here and see. He's going to be
[2:11:22] a king. If he's a king, if he's king
[2:11:25] when he comes. Now, we are going to
[2:11:27] Revelation 15. And they sang a song of
[2:11:30] Moses, the servant of the Lord. A song
[2:11:32] of the lamp, saying, "Great and
[2:11:34] marvelous are thy works, Lord God
[2:11:36] Almighty, just and true are thy ways.
[2:11:38] Thou king of saints." Yeah. So Moses was
[2:11:41] intro they were introducing another
[2:11:42] ministry in the lamb ministry. The lamb
[2:11:45] has sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[2:11:46] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[2:11:46] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[2:11:46] sh sh shed his blood. But now he's
[2:11:47] coming to redeem. He's coming to grab
[2:11:50] what is already redeemed and live in
[2:11:52] him. The day of Pentecost when he redeem
[2:11:54] us, he didn't leave us there but he said
[2:11:56] I'll be with you even in you. Amen.
[2:11:59] Glory. Let's go further. Amen.
[2:12:02] He said on earth same paragraph or same
[2:12:05] book on earth he was a prophet in glory.
[2:12:08] He's the priest. He said, "Where is
[2:12:09] glory?" Heaven is in your heart. That's
[2:12:11] right. Don't look at heaven in it's a
[2:12:13] dimension you don't see with his eyes.
[2:12:15] Let me quickly go to the quotes. He said
[2:12:17] he coming. He's a king. Oh, I like that.
[2:12:20] Prophet, faithful witness of the word,
[2:12:21] priest with his own blood before God.
[2:12:23] King. King of saints. Not king of the
[2:12:26] world now, but he's a king of saints.
[2:12:30] Right. Right. And I want this to sink
[2:12:32] in. We have an earthly kings over them
[2:12:34] people. But we have a king too and a
[2:12:36] kingdom. That's the reason we act
[2:12:38] different. So God is king and where's
[2:12:41] that king ministry? Son of David
[2:12:43] ministry. God and throne. Not in the
[2:12:45] White House, not in Birmingham palace,
[2:12:47] not somewhere in African kings. Amen.
[2:12:49] But it's Sarah in your heart. Sister cab
[2:12:52] in your heart. Amen. Amen. My sisters in
[2:12:55] your heart. God is enthroned in the
[2:12:57] heart. He's your king. Amen. Glory to
[2:12:59] God. He's my king. The world will not
[2:13:00] see that kingship, but you see it. Let's
[2:13:03] go on now. Revelation. Let's go to next
[2:13:06] next uh reading. Awesome. Revelation
[2:13:08] chapter 1 fulfilled on sunset mountain.
[2:13:10] And what is revelation 1? Let's just
[2:13:13] verse 7 say behold he's coming with
[2:13:15] clouds and every eye will see him even
[2:13:18] those who pierce him. All the tribes of
[2:13:20] the earth will on on an account of him
[2:13:23] even so. Amen. When it came to the three
[2:13:26] there were satellite h there were
[2:13:28] computer system that were watching him
[2:13:30] in Canada, US, Mexico. And if you go to
[2:13:33] the what's it called? Uh is it hall of
[2:13:35] fame? They have the the pillar of fire.
[2:13:37] When even Obama Barack Obama became
[2:13:40] president and they took him there he
[2:13:41] watched he looked at it and he said I
[2:13:44] want to take a picture with it. Oh wow.
[2:13:47] Earthly president. He saw that this is
[2:13:49] something supernatural. They took
[2:13:52] Barakuba took a picture with a cloud.
[2:13:54] Wow. It doesn't matter what other people
[2:13:56] will say that it was a jet plane that
[2:13:59] wasn't true. Don't go for that. Don't
[2:14:01] let those things sink in your mind. Wow.
[2:14:03] But focus on Christ. Amen. Don't worry
[2:14:06] about William Arab.
[2:14:08] Worry about Jesus Christ. Did this
[2:14:10] message transform your heart? Amen.
[2:14:12] Amen. Did it transform your heart? Yes.
[2:14:14] If this message transform your heart,
[2:14:17] why do you have to worry? So don't worry
[2:14:20] about what people say about William.
[2:14:22] Don't worry about what people say about
[2:14:23] Paul of Tasos. He was a murderer, but he
[2:14:26] was he was still the servant of God.
[2:14:28] Amen. So don't let that disturb you. An
[2:14:31] iota. But focus on Christ. Amen.
[2:14:35] So let's see. Uh what is attraction on
[2:14:37] the mountain? 65
[2:14:39] 725 725 if paragraph 147. And I love
[2:14:43] this. He said everything that shall
[2:14:45] never die. What else will never die?
[2:14:48] Everything else dies? Eternity. Amen.
[2:14:52] It's constantly unrolling itself from
[2:14:54] the very thing happening to the picture
[2:14:56] being what? Jesus. To the picture being
[2:14:59] what? Jesus standing looking at us said
[2:15:03] brother I was not born 65 so why can how
[2:15:05] can Jesus be looking at me I wasn't born
[2:15:08] 65
[2:15:09] either and so even those who were born
[2:15:12] in 65 they were not on sunset mountain
[2:15:14] that's right they were in West Palm
[2:15:16] Beach they were somewhere else right
[2:15:19] looking at us sister cal was looking at
[2:15:22] you sister five probably you were here
[2:15:24] sister brace but they were not on sunset
[2:15:27] mountain
[2:15:29] so how And you said be like me. Wow. You
[2:15:31] have to think a little bit.
[2:15:34] Amen. Let pause here. The Bible said we
[2:15:38] were in him before the foundation of the
[2:15:39] world. But we were just born some few
[2:15:41] years ago. So how can we be in him
[2:15:43] before that? Not this flesh. This is a
[2:15:45] dust. It's talking about the person that
[2:15:48] dwells in you. Hallelujah.
[2:15:50] Amen. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's
[2:15:53] finish this. Said Jesus. Let me see
[2:15:55] where do I get to the picture being
[2:15:57] Jesus standing looking at us and now
[2:16:00] exactly on sunset mountain and sunset
[2:16:02] light the evening light has come
[2:16:05] vindicating himself what is it is the
[2:16:07] father God and Christ are one the white
[2:16:10] how many seen it with a white wig upon
[2:16:12] him as we talk in revelation chapter one
[2:16:15] so this is the prophet own word that
[2:16:17] revelation chapter one is a white wig
[2:16:20] just as we read that behold he comes
[2:16:22] with clouds and every I eye of
[2:16:25] revelation presented seed shall see him.
[2:16:29] Every is different from all. When you
[2:16:31] say every is a selection or is all in
[2:16:35] inclusive
[2:16:37] so in English language every is not
[2:16:39] sometime we use it interchangeably but
[2:16:41] they don't mean exactly the same. So
[2:16:43] every one of my children so it refer to
[2:16:46] children. All of you, everybody, if you
[2:16:49] say all, everybody inclusive, but
[2:16:52] everyone of the predestination
[2:16:54] predestinated shall see him is the fact
[2:16:57] they said now the supreme deity
[2:16:59] authority, no other voice, no other god,
[2:17:02] no other nothing. In him dwells the
[2:17:03] fullness of the god, godhead bodily. The
[2:17:06] angels themselves was his works. The
[2:17:09] seven angels were the ws of Jesus
[2:17:11] Christ. That is supreme authority. Let's
[2:17:13] go to the next one.
[2:17:15] your thoughts materialize into reality.
[2:17:18] The pastor in Puerto Rico gave me this
[2:17:20] quotes when I preach the Sunday service
[2:17:22] I was preaching I said sometime you
[2:17:24] don't have the time to pray not
[2:17:26] everything going to have time to go on
[2:17:27] your knees go to your class say go to
[2:17:28] brother Jack please I need this prayer
[2:17:30] the situation demand instant answer
[2:17:34] you don't have time to call your mom
[2:17:36] your dad your brother your children to
[2:17:37] pray no you don't even have time to pray
[2:17:40] at that moment so what are you going to
[2:17:41] do I'm going to cry oh lord no
[2:17:45] You speak
[2:17:47] think the thought and that's where this
[2:17:49] code the thought in your heart when you
[2:17:53] just let a the Lord wash all the rubbish
[2:17:55] out of us or the trash can and then we
[2:17:58] committed ourself to the lord your
[2:18:01] thinking is a thinking his thinking is
[2:18:03] your thought so let's look at this quote
[2:18:06] your thought materializes into
[2:18:08] materialize into reality the word became
[2:18:10] flesh Indian trip report uh
[2:18:13] 54103M paragraph 183 and they that are
[2:18:16] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[2:18:19] then when the human element goes out and
[2:18:21] the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[2:18:24] when you empty yourself amen then you
[2:18:26] then will you be when the church in its
[2:18:29] power of resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:32] Christ he didn't say when the church
[2:18:33] dies but I said when the church empties
[2:18:35] himself of the things of this world will
[2:18:38] walk in his steps in his power in his
[2:18:41] thoughts in his being in his moving
[2:18:44] Amen. You see what I mean?
[2:18:45] Congratulations say sermon. Then your
[2:18:47] thoughts will become worse and your
[2:18:50] words will become material. That's when
[2:18:53] the church in its power. Amen.
[2:18:57] Amen. My brother, my sister, I don't
[2:18:59] know what else to say.
[2:19:03] Amen. That is where the Lord is leading
[2:19:04] us. Let's keep on reading this right
[2:19:07] quick. I don't want to take too much
[2:19:08] time. Par Let's keep on the same
[2:19:11] paragraph, the same message. Is that
[2:19:13] paragraph 184? I believe it's on the
[2:19:15] road. It's on the road. It means it's in
[2:19:17] action. When a car is on the road, it's
[2:19:20] in it's not station. It's on the road.
[2:19:22] That's when the church will be so
[2:19:23] wrapped up in Christ. Not wrapped up in
[2:19:26] the world, not in politics, not on
[2:19:28] YouTube, not on our jobs, not on gossip,
[2:19:31] but in what? Christ. The Holy Spirit.
[2:19:34] Mankind so away from them theirelves
[2:19:38] that they don't see themselves. They
[2:19:41] don't have no they have they but to
[2:19:44] serve God. They don't have nothing else
[2:19:45] but to serve God. And their thoughts
[2:19:48] move on. They refuse the things of the
[2:19:50] world. They just move in the spirit.
[2:19:52] Live in the spirit. Move in the spirit.
[2:19:54] Walk in the spirit. So fulfill the law
[2:19:57] of Christ. Then the love of Christ in
[2:20:00] the human heart moving in the Holy
[2:20:03] Ghost. The great wonderful church will
[2:20:05] go forth with power and dity. Amen. Dity
[2:20:09] of who? Christ. Amen. Because dity will
[2:20:12] be revealed in human beings by the Holy
[2:20:16] Spirit. Amen. Bringing to pass the
[2:20:18] thought, not the thought of God's mind,
[2:20:20] the thought of who? Their mind.
[2:20:24] And I want this one to seek in the
[2:20:26] thought of your mind. Because the mind
[2:20:28] is not Kokus's mind anymore. It's not
[2:20:30] brother Jagdal's mind anymore. It's not
[2:20:32] Ser's mind anymore. It's not S Brown's
[2:20:34] mind anymore. But it's the mind of
[2:20:36] Christ. And that mind of Christ has
[2:20:40] become your mind.
[2:20:42] But the keepers that become your mind
[2:20:45] that becomes your mind. Amen. And Satina
[2:20:48] when you think sister harmony little
[2:20:50] sister shalom that thought is no longer
[2:20:53] your teenage mind. It's not your mind
[2:20:55] but the mind of Jesus Christ has become
[2:20:57] you the little sister. And when you are
[2:21:00] walking in school, walking in the
[2:21:01] neighborhood, walking on the street,
[2:21:03] it's no longer sister shalom and sister
[2:21:06] harmony, but it's Jesus Christ on your
[2:21:08] heart, on your heart. And it doesn't
[2:21:10] matter how young you are. When you
[2:21:12] speak,
[2:21:13] your word become materialized. Amen. And
[2:21:16] that's what the Lord want to make,
[2:21:17] brother Joseph. That's what the Lord
[2:21:19] want to make you. Amen. Amen. Glory.
[2:21:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. And
[2:21:25] the next verse, thank you, Jesus.

[2:21:40] Jesus Christ's name.
[2:21:42] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Shall we be on
[2:21:45] our feet?
[2:21:48] Amen.
[2:21:52] So we want Lord take our own mind
[2:21:56] and let the mind of Christ be in you.
[2:21:58] And I want us to go and ponder over
[2:22:00] these things that God want his mind to
[2:22:04] be your mind that when you speak is not
[2:22:08] Jesus because Jesus has become
[2:22:11] you. Amen. Shall we pray?

[2:29:40] for the word of the Lord as it came from
[2:29:43] uh his servant today, brother Quu. uh so
[2:29:47] much for us just to kind of process
[2:29:49] there and um I love that thought on you
[2:29:52] know your mistakes can't delete your
[2:29:56] election it can't delete your
[2:29:59] election and and and sometimes the devil
[2:30:02] reminds us of all the things that you
[2:30:04] did this you did that ain't got nothing
[2:30:06] to do with my election and uh God saw me
[2:30:09] perfect before the foundation world and
[2:30:11] I'mma walk right into that so we we
[2:30:14] thank God what a what a what What a
[2:30:16] wonderful thought. Amen. What a
[2:30:18] wonderful wonderful thought. I just
[2:30:20] loved how he said how the Lord gave him
[2:30:22] that in a in a dream and you know and
[2:30:24] it's just amazing God would just quicken
[2:30:27] a sermon like that and and um and how
[2:30:30] the Lord would just lead him just to
[2:30:31] kind of go down this this path for us
[2:30:33] today. I know we all leave here
[2:30:35] encouraged. I know we all leave here
[2:30:36] strengthened. Amen. and by the word of
[2:30:38] the Lord and um all these other voices
[2:30:42] that are out there talking, let's forget
[2:30:44] about them and only listen to what the
[2:30:46] voice of God, Amen, is speaking about
[2:30:48] us. Uh I was just sharing with some
[2:30:51] brothers over the past few days and and
[2:30:54] we were talking uh politics because
[2:30:57] there's a great voice there in politics.
[2:30:59] But we were talking and it was asked me
[2:31:01] say brother you know um people feel that
[2:31:06] um uh Camala Harris was the fulfillment
[2:31:09] of brother Random's um vision the sixth
[2:31:12] vision that he had. And I said, "Yeah,
[2:31:14] brother. I feel that way, too." You
[2:31:16] know, that she he said there would be a
[2:31:19] woman vice president or president or it
[2:31:22] would be the Catholic Church. I say she
[2:31:24] came dressed in purple, everything. She
[2:31:27] was the vice president voted in by the
[2:31:30] United States. I say and then there was
[2:31:32] a time where the president had to go in
[2:31:35] for surgery and they had to swear her in
[2:31:39] as president
[2:31:41] for the hours that he was underneath
[2:31:43] surgery. So really the prophecy was
[2:31:45] fulfilled in multiple ways. I said but
[2:31:48] there's one other prophecy and brother
[2:31:51] Brandham said the seventh pro prophecy
[2:31:53] was that we were going to see debris all
[2:31:56] over the land of the USA. And I believe
[2:31:59] there are some things that are happening
[2:32:01] that are setting that up for us to see.
[2:32:03] But however, for me, I don't want to be
[2:32:05] here. I don't want to stay here while
[2:32:07] all that's happening. I'm believing when
[2:32:09] he shall appear, I'm going to be just
[2:32:11] like him and I'll be changed in a
[2:32:13] moment, in the twinkle of an eye.
[2:32:16] Hallelujah. If God call Lot out of
[2:32:18] Sodom, God going to call us out of here.
[2:32:21] Praise God. Amen. So, we're expectation,
[2:32:24] church. Amen. There's a rapture, amen,
[2:32:27] that is taking place right now. We're
[2:32:28] part of it right now, being changed even
[2:32:31] right now by the by the word of God. And
[2:32:33] we want to continue that change until
[2:32:35] we're changed right on out of here.
[2:32:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[2:32:38] brother Quu. Thank you so much. Amen.
[2:32:41] For bringing food for our souls today.
[2:32:46] Glory to God. Let's have a word of
[2:32:47] prayer. Amen. As we prepare to dismiss
[2:32:50] you, Father, we thank you for your word
[2:32:53] that has come to our
[2:32:55] hearts. Lord, we just appreciate Amen.
[2:32:59] your servant just getting himself out of
[2:33:00] the way that Lord, you could use them to
[2:33:03] minister to us on today. Father, uh what
[2:33:06] an encouraging word. We we shall when
[2:33:09] you shall appear, God, we'll be just
[2:33:11] like you somehow someway. You'll
[2:33:14] transform us. You'll change us, oh God,
[2:33:16] and we'll be in your very image. We're
[2:33:18] going through the process even right
[2:33:21] now, Father. That just the the thoughts
[2:33:24] that he presented there through your
[2:33:25] prophet, Lord, you bringing to pass even
[2:33:28] the thoughts of our minds, Lord. What a
[2:33:31] powerful place to be in that you would
[2:33:34] bring those those thoughts to pass. We
[2:33:35] have to have the right thoughts. We have
[2:33:37] to have the right thinking, oh God, for
[2:33:39] you to be able to do that. So change our
[2:33:41] hearts, oh God. Change our our minds and
[2:33:45] change our beings, Lord. make us more
[2:33:47] and more like you, Father. Help us to
[2:33:49] hear your voice. Speak to us, Lord, and
[2:33:52] transform us, amen, into your image,
[2:33:54] Father. God, I pray your blessings upon
[2:33:57] the people as they leave this place, but
[2:33:59] not your presence. Father, we know every
[2:34:01] ear that, Amen, was here today and those
[2:34:04] that heard online, God, you had a
[2:34:06] special word for them. And I pray we'd
[2:34:08] walk in what was given to us, Lord, on
[2:34:11] this day. We pray, Father, that you
[2:34:12] would keep us until we're able to come
[2:34:14] back together again on uh Wednesday
[2:34:17] night. May the spirit of the Lord meet
[2:34:18] us here once more, Father, is our
[2:34:20] prayer. We're careful to give you all
[2:34:22] the honor. We're careful to give you all
[2:34:24] the glory. We're careful to give you all
[2:34:26] the praise. It's in Jesus' name we pray.
[2:34:30] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[2:34:32] of
[2:34:34] praise. Praise the
[2:34:36] Lord. Amen. You can be seated. The
[2:34:39] brothers will come. The thing that I
[2:34:41] said, I forgot to tell y'all earlier. I
[2:34:44] I remember it. The Lord brought it back
[2:34:45] to my attention. We want to thank the
[2:34:47] Lord for touching Sister Cobb and
[2:34:50] bringing her back to her instrument.
[2:34:53] Amen. God is
[2:34:55] good. Amen. We shall be like him. God
