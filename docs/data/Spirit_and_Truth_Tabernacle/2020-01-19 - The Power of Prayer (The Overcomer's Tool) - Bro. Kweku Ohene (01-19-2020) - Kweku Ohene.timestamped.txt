[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:41] praise be to God shall we give a clap or
[1:06:43] no to up shall we be seated the Lord is
[1:06:52] with God bless you brothers and sisters
[1:06:54] for the songs amen the Lord blesses the
[1:06:57] Lord as his ministry is a different fold
[1:07:00] sometimes we think about the preachers
[1:07:02] but every one of us has a role to play
[1:07:05] amen when I see my sisters and brothers
[1:07:07] singing I see eternity reigning a man is
[1:07:12] a portion of Christ
[1:07:13] it's a portion of the word that comes in
[1:07:16] the form of songs and music to lift us
[1:07:18] up amen sometime you could be down but
[1:07:20] when you hear just one song from Zion it
[1:07:24] lifts your spirit from solo from defeat
[1:07:27] into glory into joy into blessing into
[1:07:30] the celestial dimension so god bless you
[1:07:33] sisters and brothers for what you do for
[1:07:34] the Lord we appreciate you amen we want
[1:07:38] to just talk a little bit on the power
[1:07:40] of prayer the overcomers
[1:07:42] to the power of prayer the overcomers -
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:49] the Lord gave us so many tools to
[1:07:51] overcome the world that we live in he
[1:07:54] gave us the word the word is himself now
[1:07:57] within the word that's a portion let me
[1:07:59] use a family in a family we have the
[1:08:02] head of the family the husband we have
[1:08:04] their queen
[1:08:05] or we have the backbone of the family
[1:08:06] the mother we have got a children we
[1:08:09] have got maybe seven we've got different
[1:08:11] ones who play different rules with what
[1:08:13] may be the one who drives maybe not
[1:08:15] everybody drives in their family maybe
[1:08:17] only the father drives only one of the
[1:08:18] kids drive only the the mother drives so
[1:08:21] each and every one play a role
[1:08:22] the father can be the head of the family
[1:08:24] but now without a mother
[1:08:26] the family is not complete we're not
[1:08:28] eight children the family is not
[1:08:29] complete so each and every one has a
[1:08:31] role to play
[1:08:32] amen many a time we look at the kingdom
[1:08:35] of God as Jesus who died on Calvary
[1:08:37] 2,000 years ago
[1:08:38] praise God without him we wouldn't be
[1:08:40] here so he is the centerpiece now but is
[1:08:44] what portion which is the wife which is
[1:08:46] you and I which is important just as
[1:08:49] Jesus on Calvary because Jesus on
[1:08:52] Calvary has finished what
[1:08:53] was supposed to do on Kaveri but there's
[1:08:55] a part of part of the drama that has to
[1:08:58] be played by you there's part of the
[1:09:00] redemption story that as we unfold by
[1:09:03] you has been unfolded by you amen do you
[1:09:06] know you are also a messiah do you know
[1:09:09] you are Christ so you also said to
[1:09:11] redeem amen
[1:09:13] you mono redeem or the people in the on
[1:09:15] the planet but you might redeem your
[1:09:17] family you might not redeem or be proven
[1:09:21] in West Palm Beach
[1:09:21] Megara has put maybe to 310 for 1400
[1:09:26] whatever and I or umbrella the umbrella
[1:09:29] of the Holy Ghost in you not you as a
[1:09:31] human being you can do nothin even for
[1:09:33] yourself you can read you couldn't
[1:09:35] redeem yourself
[1:09:36] but there's something new Christ in you
[1:09:38] is the Redeemer amen so Christ in you is
[1:09:42] doing the rhythm is doing a redemptive
[1:09:44] work just as Jesus Christ on Calvary did
[1:09:46] is portion even when his children were
[1:09:48] crucifying him he prefer them as a
[1:09:50] father the one who see me forgive them
[1:09:53] for they don't know what they are doing
[1:09:54] amen there might be some people time I
[1:09:56] crucify you the map is on who dama BIA
[1:09:58] gives you but you prefer them that Lord
[1:10:00] forgive them they have not sinned Eid
[1:10:03] and their message yet if they see who
[1:10:05] they are they will of the kingdom of God
[1:10:07] Amen so you have been set as a redeemer
[1:10:10] and your family to bring those that are
[1:10:13] under your umbrella on to cry Jesus amen
[1:10:16] some of us might not be sitting here may
[1:10:18] not be pretty had I not been a messiah
[1:10:20] that God put in a family to pray for us
[1:10:23] to teach us the Word of God amen
[1:10:25] let me use myself for example when I was
[1:10:28] coming up as a child my mother was my
[1:10:30] role model my dad used to cite
[1:10:32] scriptures but it wasn't that of much of
[1:10:34] a prayer person he proved over over food
[1:10:36] and stuff like that but my mother was a
[1:10:39] prayer warrior in the family so my
[1:10:40] mother could will kneel down we had a
[1:10:42] little
[1:10:43] Hoffman head of Christ that picture and
[1:10:46] we pray we just got around it in three
[1:10:48] that said me as a beginning of my
[1:10:50] Christian life I don't remember the same
[1:10:52] oath about that way preach but I
[1:10:55] remember the phrase that I pray with my
[1:10:57] mother amen so my mother was a redeemer
[1:11:00] for me until my bro
[1:11:02] took over my brother knew the word of
[1:11:04] the Lord a message of William Branham
[1:11:06] so the Lord lifts us from this brain to
[1:11:08] something higher than praise Amen with a
[1:11:12] wait we through a preen but a lot added
[1:11:14] something more to it so through your
[1:11:17] prayer something that you are desiring
[1:11:19] God will add it to it for you amen
[1:11:21] so prayer is the most important to God
[1:11:24] give it to to my let's look at some
[1:11:26] scriptures and just say the basis glory
[1:11:30] hallelujah let's look at James chapter 5
[1:11:42] the story of Elisha you want to read
[1:11:48] where men of God preached and a lot
[1:11:50] answer shall we be enough it if we can
[1:11:52] James chapter 5 let's start from verse
[1:11:56] 13 to about 18 James chapter 5 13 to 18
[1:12:05] praise be to God right so James 5:13 to
[1:12:14] 18 is that is there any among you
[1:12:17] afflicted let him pray is anyone here
[1:12:19] afflicted are you going to some
[1:12:21] affliction happily most of us right and
[1:12:24] if you don't you don't have any
[1:12:25] affliction then before you even stand in
[1:12:27] a better position pray for somebody
[1:12:28] who's been afflicted if you don't have
[1:12:30] nothing to worry about everything is
[1:12:32] cool and cozy and rosy for you
[1:12:34] OhLaLa fred wanna see all allah proof
[1:12:37] for somebody else come and join me come
[1:12:38] and join brother Troy join your sister
[1:12:41] some way so is that is there any one
[1:12:43] among you afflicted let him free or let
[1:12:45] her free is any merry let him sing Sam's
[1:12:49] is any sick among you let him call for
[1:12:52] the elders of the church and let them
[1:12:54] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[1:12:56] the name of the Lord and the prayer of
[1:12:59] faith I want you to know that prayer of
[1:13:01] faith pray with faith amen private
[1:13:04] revelation don't look at the situation
[1:13:07] look at the Christ in you amen
[1:13:09] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:13:11] sick and the Lord raised him up and if
[1:13:14] he has committed sins they shall be
[1:13:16] forgiven him glory hallelujah confess
[1:13:20] your faults one to another when you have
[1:13:22] something in you that is blocking your
[1:13:23] prayer confess it to the Lord if you've
[1:13:26] done something against somebody confess
[1:13:28] it to the Lord
[1:13:28] there's nothing God cannot forgive you
[1:13:30] God can forgive you and your brother
[1:13:32] you're stuck and forgive you everyone
[1:13:35] for another that you may be healed the
[1:13:38] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:13:40] man availeth much seventeen Alliance
[1:13:43] which is Elijah was as a man subject to
[1:13:45] like passions as we are Elijah had
[1:13:48] fought and mystic he was Moody person
[1:13:49] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[1:13:53] not rain and it rained not on earth by
[1:13:55] the space of three years and six months
[1:13:57] and he prayed again and the heaven gave
[1:14:00] rain and the earth brought forth her
[1:14:03] fruits amen shall we end over the father
[1:14:06] may you add blessing to the reading of
[1:14:07] your word shall we be seated the power
[1:14:11] of prayer we want to look at some
[1:14:17] scriptures and how God use men of God
[1:14:21] and women of God to bless to change
[1:14:22] situation Elijah was a human being just
[1:14:25] like you maybe you couldn't say like I
[1:14:26] said prophet God walk with Him or
[1:14:28] closely to him maybe then he was with me
[1:14:30] so that's why God had his prayer he
[1:14:32] could tell the rain the ho he wasn't in
[1:14:35] the clouds he didn't physically good to
[1:14:36] stop the hydrogen and the oxygen to stop
[1:14:40] the affirmation of water and Klaus but
[1:14:42] it's put their way through praise and
[1:14:45] what is life the what is Christ Jesus
[1:14:47] the way that is in you is not a word of
[1:14:50] a human being you can talk one side as a
[1:14:52] human being you can eat as a human being
[1:14:54] you can play as a human being you can do
[1:14:57] certain things as a human being but
[1:14:59] there's somebody in you if you have the
[1:15:01] Holy Ghost in you Christ in you is not
[1:15:04] just a human being but it's attended
[1:15:06] himself amen so when the situation's
[1:15:09] that you need to speak you need to pray
[1:15:12] then it's not your human side speaking
[1:15:14] it is Christ's side who is bringing for
[1:15:17] the attribute of the word M prayer and
[1:15:19] when you pray regardless of the
[1:15:22] condition
[1:15:23] it is not your way it is Christ himself
[1:15:25] amen and Christ will bring his way to
[1:15:28] pass in your life in your praise so when
[1:15:31] they light up read that let it not be
[1:15:33] rain for three three years an hour and
[1:15:35] half there was no rain in the land of
[1:15:38] Israel
[1:15:39] Anto Elijah prayed again Lord let it
[1:15:43] rains fall and the rain fall
[1:15:45] amen the element of this earth is under
[1:15:48] your control if you can see your
[1:15:50] position that you are
[1:15:53] Atena amen if you have Christ on the
[1:15:56] inside of you you have the creative
[1:15:58] portion of God in you you can speak into
[1:16:01] creation and you can speak this out of
[1:16:03] creation glory hallelujah I think there
[1:16:06] was a testimony of a prayer warrior once
[1:16:08] inste in Colombia that she prayed for
[1:16:11] her cousin my cousin had a cancer and
[1:16:13] she preached was good have a surgery
[1:16:15] tomb or something like that to do
[1:16:17] surgery and remove the cancer or to mow
[1:16:19] when she prayed I think they do take a

[1:18:55] amen is good the power of prayer amen
[1:18:59] the Lord is good he is good let's just
[1:19:03] look at some things here before you go
[1:19:06] forward the Lord is good I want us to
[1:19:08] look at a weapon that God give to
[1:19:12] overcome situations the power of prayer
[1:19:14] the weapon of the overcomer or the
[1:19:16] victress weapon is a paw of prayer now
[1:19:19] let's look are we ready Elijah right
[1:19:21] Elijah let's look at a little called
[1:19:23] Hannah in the Bible so let's go to 1st
[1:19:26] Samuel because you might say oh brother
[1:19:28] I'm not a prophet how can I have that
[1:19:30] power like Elijah
[1:19:31] I'm not brother Jack how can I pray and
[1:19:33] customers I'm not a quick walk and I
[1:19:35] preach how can I do this no the same
[1:19:38] power is in you amen
[1:19:40] the same power in Jesus Christ a great
[1:19:42] one who's put this working into
[1:19:44] existence is in you my sister and when
[1:19:46] we recognize who we are nothing can
[1:19:49] stand before us amen
[1:19:51] because the victory is not coming from
[1:19:53] the skies the victory is in you the
[1:19:56] kingdom of God is in the heart of men
[1:19:57] and women amen the kingdom of God is not
[1:20:00] strong is not effective what is in some
[1:20:02] dimension some way by one day cannot
[1:20:04] descend in the Sistine element of your
[1:20:06] flesh then the kingdom begin to have
[1:20:08] effectiveness on the earth
[1:20:10] amen so let's look at Hannah First
[1:20:13] Samuel Chapter 1 praise be to God the
[1:20:24] Lord is good let's look at a woman that
[1:20:26] the Lord
[1:20:28] Freya's got two portions is got a Tunde
[1:20:32] yoosu and a rip in time so let's look at
[1:20:34] Hannah's situation First Samuel Chapter
[1:20:37] 1 I'll be jumping back and forth so
[1:20:39] forgive me because a lot I can't read
[1:20:42] Tom wouldn't permit us to read I wish we
[1:20:44] can read verse 1 to the whole the whole
[1:20:46] of it but it's a lot so first summer
[1:20:48] chapter 1 now chapter 1 verse 1 let's
[1:20:52] read a verse phase phase now there was a
[1:20:54] certain a certain man of Ramat Rama's
[1:20:58] Safin of mount ephraim and his name was
[1:21:02] al cana the son of Jarrow ham the son of
[1:21:05] le who the son of to who the son of zeus
[1:21:09] and every sight he was from the tribe of
[1:21:11] ephraim and he had two wives the name of
[1:21:13] one of his wife was hannah and the name
[1:21:16] of the other was pnina pnina had
[1:21:18] children but hannah had no children I
[1:21:21] want you to take notes now is the
[1:21:22] negative contrast amen Hannah the other
[1:21:26] rival who has children and she had no
[1:21:29] children let's see why and verse 3 and
[1:21:33] this man went up out of his City yearly
[1:21:35] to worship and to sacrifice unto the
[1:21:38] Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons
[1:21:40] of Eli hophni and Phinehas the priests
[1:21:44] of the Lord were they and when that time
[1:21:46] was and when the time was that a kind of
[1:21:49] offered he give to pnina his portion his
[1:21:51] wife and to all his sons and her
[1:21:54] daughters portions but on to Hana he
[1:21:57] gave a wedding portion for he loved
[1:21:59] Hannah but the Lord had shut up him
[1:22:03] amen sometimes we give we blame the
[1:22:05] devil for certain things yes the devil
[1:22:07] does it but a lot give him permission to
[1:22:08] do it for a purpose so don't let s give
[1:22:11] glorified don't let us glorify the devil
[1:22:13] let us give glory to God amen the Bible
[1:22:16] said I think Isaiah chapter 5 someway
[1:22:20] said and the Lord I create evil and do
[1:22:22] good idolo to orphans
[1:22:24] amen the lot is the one that created the
[1:22:26] devil so the Lord does all of them good
[1:22:29] and evil so the Lord does only good the
[1:22:31] Lord good and evil he does it so I mean
[1:22:34] you use it as an instrument to do some
[1:22:37] evil to bring some negative to shut a
[1:22:39] room of Hannah and I were to be a model
[1:22:42] that you could go to the hospital you
[1:22:43] know what there's no chance for you've
[1:22:44] got this fibroid in the room you've got
[1:22:46] this one so maybe you can adopt maybe
[1:22:48] you can get a cat or dog and maybe use
[1:22:51] the dog as your daughter or your child
[1:22:53] or whatever the dog can inherit you know
[1:22:55] not Hannah amen she knew her position
[1:22:59] amen so yes so that was the negative
[1:23:02] contrast now let's go let's go on and
[1:23:05] verse verse 6 and her adversary also
[1:23:08] provoked a saw for to make her fret
[1:23:11] because the Lord has shut up a wound so
[1:23:13] the Lord does it and as in this
[1:23:15] he did sue year by year when she went up
[1:23:18] to the house of the Lord
[1:23:19] so she provoked her therefore she wept
[1:23:22] and did not eat then said conahey
[1:23:25] husband onto her onto Anna why we passed
[1:23:27] down and ye tests are not and why is
[1:23:30] thine heart grieved
[1:23:31] am I not better than better to live than
[1:23:34] ten sons the other interns don't nobody
[1:23:36] can help you your husband might love you
[1:23:38] to the core he might love you to help
[1:23:40] from heaven and earth but the in a
[1:23:43] situation he can you be not be the
[1:23:45] answer
[1:23:45] your wife will love you to death your
[1:23:48] children can love you to death but
[1:23:50] there's a situation
[1:23:51] the answer lies on the inside the God on
[1:23:54] the inside of you amen so let's see then
[1:23:58] Sarah Connor
[1:23:58] then said ok this 9 so Hannah rose up
[1:24:02] after they had eaten in Shiloh and after
[1:24:06] they are drunk now alight a priest sat
[1:24:08] upon his seat by the posts of the temple
[1:24:10] of the Lord and she was in bitterness of
[1:24:12] Sue have you been bitterness also before
[1:24:15] I've been there before there are certain
[1:24:16] situation that you guess who the Lord
[1:24:18] let it go that way for a purpose that
[1:24:20] what is in you come out amen he lets
[1:24:23] that his situation gets worse you don't
[1:24:25] see your left hand from your right hand
[1:24:27] you don't see nothing but I want you to
[1:24:30] recognize he that is in you amen
[1:24:34] when nothing is working outside then go
[1:24:36] on the inside and consult a doctor
[1:24:39] consult chief physician consult mr.
[1:24:41] Jesus consult the roots of Sharon
[1:24:43] consult lla Elohim consult the Almighty
[1:24:47] who created the heaven and the earth
[1:24:48] consult one who put your frame together
[1:24:51] he's the one who are the answer Amen
[1:24:53] praise be to God glory hallelujah
[1:24:57] and she was in the bitterness of service
[1:25:00] level and that she vowed a vow when we
[1:25:02] come to set in desperation you speak
[1:25:04] like an omnipotent amen she Valluvar and
[1:25:07] said O Lord of Hosts if thou would
[1:25:10] indeed look on affliction of thine
[1:25:12] handmaid and remember me and not forget
[1:25:14] thine handmaid but will give unto thine
[1:25:17] handmaid a man-child and then I will
[1:25:19] give him on to the Lord all the days of
[1:25:21] his life and there shall no reason come
[1:25:23] upon his head and it came to pass as she
[1:25:25] continued in prayer
[1:25:27] before the Lord Li make her mouth now
[1:25:30] hanashi spook she speak in her heart
[1:25:32] only her lips moved but their voice was
[1:25:35] no head
[1:25:35] therefore eli thought she had been
[1:25:37] drugged she had been drinking and he
[1:25:39] lasted on to her how long would that be
[1:25:41] drunk and put away that wine from thee
[1:25:43] and hana answered and said no my lord
[1:25:45] I'm a woman of sorrowful spirit I would
[1:25:48] drive drunk neither wine nor strong
[1:25:50] drink but I've poured out my soup before
[1:25:53] the Lord counts not thine handmaid for a
[1:25:56] daughter of Billy Oh for out of the
[1:25:58] abundance of my complaint and grief have
[1:26:01] I spoken either to amen
[1:26:03] then Allah answered and said go in peace
[1:26:06] and the God of Israel grant the die
[1:26:09] petition that thou hast asked of him and
[1:26:11] she said let thine handmaid find grease
[1:26:14] in that side so the one went away and
[1:26:16] did eat and a countenance was no more
[1:26:19] sad Freya what happened she was in a
[1:26:23] stroke of heart she was in desperation
[1:26:25] she didn't know anywhere to go the
[1:26:28] husband could in here in this couldn't
[1:26:29] help her in this situation but there was
[1:26:31] somebody in her that moved her to free
[1:26:34] to go to the temple and even in a praise
[1:26:36] she had trials the priest counted it to
[1:26:39] be a drunken man she did she was a mad
[1:26:43] with the priests her attitude remain
[1:26:45] calm he said no I'm not drunk but I'm
[1:26:48] pouring my soul on to the Lord
[1:26:49] the president asked her what is your
[1:26:51] petition but I let it be on to you
[1:26:53] according to what you desire amen and
[1:26:57] the god of right there was a dimensional
[1:26:59] incline Amen the Lord ascended into the
[1:27:01] situation the word from the priest
[1:27:03] changed open the womb of Hannah right
[1:27:06] there amen there's a life on the lips of
[1:27:10] men and women when you spit a right word
[1:27:13] the word is life it creates situation it
[1:27:17] changes the negative it destroyed the
[1:27:19] weapons of the enemy and it bring Christ
[1:27:21] Jesus into manifestation glory
[1:27:24] hallelujah so now she was it's no fun no
[1:27:26] more and then as we read on Alan let's
[1:27:29] go to him and we know the stories I'm
[1:27:31] not going to read obvious one but now

[1:27:45] you go through resistance but you have
[1:27:47] to press on two three

[1:27:51] went through resistance should have
[1:27:53] given up and I mean stop going to church
[1:27:54] the priest himself is telling her that
[1:27:56] she said drunk woman she was innocent

[1:28:08] her right attitude towards the Lord and

[1:36:08] you that is laughs amen eternal life is
[1:36:13] living for others Jesus Christ didn't
[1:36:16] live for himself he said he might be
[1:36:19] nothing he wasn't a human being let me
[1:36:21] split this no way I'm going in but let
[1:36:22] me keep going in Jesus Christ when he
[1:36:25] was on earth when he knew he was going
[1:36:27] to die for us even when Peter tried to
[1:36:29] stand in his way Lord are you going to
[1:36:31] die you are do not this miracle your
[1:36:32] ministry so agreed you can die you have
[1:36:34] to I mean keep this ministry you know
[1:36:36] and Allah said no that is sit and sit
[1:36:38] and get behind me because its purpose is
[1:36:40] to do the will of the Father in him
[1:36:42] so when it was about time for him to go
[1:36:44] he went through struggles he was
[1:36:46] preening garden of gethsemane right the
[1:36:49] twelve hour of his life was horrible
[1:36:52] his was sweating blood have you sweated
[1:36:54] blood before no blood was coming out of
[1:36:57] his sweat see the agony was going
[1:36:59] through the painful death he's you
[1:37:00] consider dimension when certain trials
[1:37:03] come the lot of repeated that trash for
[1:37:05] you to know that this trial is coming we
[1:37:07] all go through it it's so tacky
[1:37:09] why Lord why me why don't you take the
[1:37:11] strap for me but a lot of that you can
[1:37:13] bear it
[1:37:14] amen so Jesus praise the Lord if it's
[1:37:17] your wall let this cup pass over me he
[1:37:20] could come and NGOs he could speak and
[1:37:23] mankind would be changed but that was
[1:37:25] not the route he also got through
[1:37:27] suffering so I want you and I asked
[1:37:29] suffering he can feel in his blood
[1:37:31] he can feel in the selected dimension so
[1:37:34] he went to the suffering human form not
[1:37:36] in angelic form an angelic form is put
[1:37:38] last rose come up from the grief that
[1:37:41] was easy that was just a coup that was a
[1:37:44] good deal
[1:37:44] that wasn't a rout this time he was a
[1:37:47] full-blooded human being
[1:37:48] full-blooded mama like you and I he was
[1:37:51] going through pain painful depend I was
[1:37:53] going through child pain and the Lord he
[1:37:57] said not my war but your war not all of
[1:38:00] the flesh but all of the father that
[1:38:02] lives in me and the Bible said that
[1:38:04] angels came to minister to him Moses and
[1:38:07] Elijah whereas a Lord if you don't go to
[1:38:09] Kaveri all of us are doomed right from
[1:38:12] Adam to the last son of yours all of us
[1:38:15] are doomed that
[1:38:16] that I was going to ruin the hood the
[1:38:18] whole creation and it's a lot get up and
[1:38:21] go to Kaveri so look at him God his
[1:38:24] creation now trying to help him amen
[1:38:27] he created angels he created so funny so
[1:38:30] they came around and lift him up when
[1:38:33] the battle got ripley's that you can't
[1:38:34] go no more the Lord knows what it can do
[1:38:36] for you
[1:38:37] amen when your human ability human
[1:38:40] ability let make a way when you're in
[1:38:41] mobility comes to a limit where you
[1:38:44] cannot go forth there's a supernatural
[1:38:46] ability that's Eterna ability the super
[1:38:50] ability now take you from the human
[1:38:52] bility or human inability to where you
[1:38:55] need to be amen that is where prayer
[1:38:57] counts amen Freya is so in time our
[1:39:01] recent scriptures you are sowing you saw
[1:39:04] in grief you saw in pain just like
[1:39:06] childbirth when a woman is gonna have a
[1:39:08] child is not a fun they go through pain
[1:39:10] you don't even know what I gonna make it
[1:39:11] or not because some people die in
[1:39:13] delivering children they die and a baby
[1:39:15] dies so also not a baby dies so it's a
[1:39:18] life-and-death issue by yes women I have
[1:39:21] that collision brief I mean courage to
[1:39:23] go and good I mean conceive children and
[1:39:26] deliver children because without them
[1:39:28] they will be no preacher
[1:39:29] they'll be no prophet will be no
[1:39:31] presidents there will be nobody on this
[1:39:33] earth God gives our ministry to them and
[1:39:35] God has given ministry a brother or a
[1:39:37] sister
[1:39:38] amen praise be to God
[1:39:43] let's read some 126 5 and 6
[1:39:50] the sowing time of Prayer someone 26 5 &
[1:40:03] 6 see how it feels to sew

[1:40:33] here let us sow in tears shall reap in
[1:40:35] joy amen he that goeth forth and weepeth
[1:40:38] bearing precious seed shall doubtless

[1:41:01] picture they don't see that Christ in
[1:41:03] you they don't want nothing to do with
[1:41:04] the word of the Lord but you are growing

[1:41:23] rejoicing esta let's read something from
[1:41:26] s as well just to kneel down how it is
[1:41:31] to sow in tears as such after fall

[1:45:41] because they don't know better but I
[1:45:43] want to get adult you cook you put a
[1:45:46] food that you serve them you put a mini
[1:45:48] prawns around them sometimes even feed
[1:45:49] them when they are under certain age

[1:45:53] children but as the children grow you
[1:45:55] teach them how to use spoon how to use
[1:45:57] your hands to eat you tell them how to
[1:45:59] take things from the refrigerator you
[1:46:00] tell them even how to the girls how to
[1:46:02] operate the stove because they are going
[1:46:04] to be an adult they are going to be
[1:46:06] and they are going to be wives they are
[1:46:07] going to be mothers and so forth
[1:46:09] the same thing is the spiritual
[1:46:11] dimension the Lord sometimes gives us
[1:46:14] Indian twists right take it you don't
[1:46:16] have to breathe through your mother
[1:46:18] through your father through your parents
[1:46:19] you get a certain age you see that the
[1:46:22] difficulties are setting in you have to
[1:46:24] make choices for yourself your friends

[1:47:24] project it on the ball on the screen
[1:47:28] Matthew sees and said after this manner

[1:59:55] a house story a school rada and he gave
[1:59:58] the story to this to smaller sisters to
[2:00:00] live live there and they were seen the
[2:00:03] story building going this way and away
[2:00:06] right before them people were dying in
[2:00:09] so the sisters wanted to jump from the

[2:00:14] right that don't jump and he said
[2:00:16] earthquake
[2:00:17] I command you stop and the earthquake

[2:00:59] the earthquake earthquake is coming from
[2:01:01] under different different things physics
[2:01:04] and chemistry Anderson terrific can

[2:01:14] book and the storm ceased the same
[2:01:16] street is in you so when pistache I

[2:01:40] earthquake stopped amen that power is in
[2:01:43] you and that part comes to prayer let's
[2:01:46] look at one character less really good
[2:01:49] from here if you can I want to learn
[2:01:52] this really a bit about Susanna Wesley
[2:01:54] the mother of John Wesley you mothers
[2:01:56] and sisters how to I wanted to make it
[2:01:59] as a part of your life to inculcate in
[2:02:01] the children about the Word of God about
[2:02:03] power of prayer amen
[2:02:05] so let's read something about a John
[2:02:07] Wesley's mom Susanna Wesley if you can
[2:02:11] go to the message 55 208 10 e Jesus
[2:02:17] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:02:18] forever blessed be the Lord
[2:02:30] you subscribe the same yesterday today
[2:02:32] and forever more
[2:02:44] okay okay a message at 5:00 208 10 e d
[2:02:52] subscribe the same yesterday today and
[2:02:54] forever more paragraph Lam read from
[2:02:55] paragraph 15 this shot said now my brand
[2:03:00] was given a prayer cut and was insulting
[2:03:02] the people so now we are just going to
[2:03:04] pray for the sick I'm not here to
[2:03:07] entertain as I see I'm here to pray for
[2:03:08] the sick there's no greater power in the
[2:03:11] world than prayer do you believe that
[2:03:15] there's no greater power in the world
[2:03:17] than prayer
[2:03:19] the greatest power they'll all give it
[2:03:22] to his sons and daughters is what prayer
[2:03:24] I mean I live in then go to a lemon read
[2:03:28] another another listen to emphasize
[2:03:31] let's read a the hand of the Lord came
[2:03:34] upon me five four oh four OH three the
[2:03:38] hand of the Lord they may see the hand
[2:03:39] of the Lord came upon me let's read
[2:03:41] paragraph 14 Ramos talking about
[2:03:44] Jehoshaphat when he made a wrong
[2:03:47] alliance with a hub it was an ungodly
[2:03:49] person you better watch who you work
[2:03:51] with
[2:03:51] amen if you don't work with the word
[2:03:53] somebody who want to take you as tree
[2:03:55] from the word then you're gonna go as
[2:03:57] tree so Jewish effort was a believer
[2:04:01] true believer buddy walk align himself
[2:04:02] with the wrong king whose wife was just
[2:04:05] a bell
[2:04:05] didn't want nothing to do with the Lord
[2:04:07] they were idol worshipers and I plant
[2:04:10] himself in a situation but because it
[2:04:12] was a believer when he prayed a lot had
[2:04:14] his prayers who is that another thing as
[2:04:16] soon as Joseph had ordinary now if we
[2:04:19] would have prayed over the subject would
[2:04:21] have thought about it face God what must
[2:04:23] I do but being you with unbelievers
[2:04:25] he to the oblivious way and that's the
[2:04:27] way many spirit-filled Christians after
[2:04:30] revival fall because they give
[2:04:32] themselves up amongst people that said
[2:04:34] well I go to church we ask good as the
[2:04:36] rest of them and you lose your
[2:04:38] experience still right in the road no
[2:04:41] matter what the rest of them does you
[2:04:44] know where you belong you know who you
[2:04:46] belong to
[2:04:46] still right under the power of prayer
[2:04:48] all the time
[2:04:50] still another power of prayer all the
[2:04:53] time
[2:04:54] don't let them call you off to something
[2:04:56] else in amusement there's no harm in it
[2:04:59] it has a question don't do it stay away
[2:05:02] from it
[2:05:03] amen stay Ana down on the pole prayer
[2:05:06] now let's see a Susanna Wesley John
[2:05:10] Wesley's mom let's see how the Lord used
[2:05:14] this room and let's look at the message
[2:05:17] influence 6363 11:14 Susanna Wesley was
[2:05:23] say I think she came from a family of 25
[2:05:25] she would her parents have 25 children
[2:05:27] and now she and her husband husband was
[2:05:30] a preacher
[2:05:31] they had 19 children John Wesley was
[2:05:34] their 15th but let's see how this woman
[2:05:36] even artificial like is COO of our own a
[2:05:39] children was like a class it's even
[2:05:41] bigger than his Cruz you know I've
[2:05:43] taught before I've had a class of 910
[2:05:45] and class of 20 but this one had a class
[2:05:47] of 19 which is quite a number to deal
[2:05:50] with boys and girls somewhere somewhere
[2:05:53] kids so is that
[2:05:54] I think of Susanna Wesley I think she
[2:05:57] had 17 years on messages a 19 when you
[2:06:00] go to if you read is 19 sometimes it's
[2:06:02] 1970 but I think it's 19 I think that's
[2:06:05] right but she found two hours or more
[2:06:07] every day to pray she prayed three hours
[2:06:09] every day with 19 kids so how did she do
[2:06:13] it she didn't have a technology to to
[2:06:18] entertain the children she didn't have a
[2:06:20] children's something to kind of
[2:06:22] entertain this one's to have a cell
[2:06:24] phone to give them to play video games
[2:06:25] okay you deny yahoos can play video
[2:06:28] games and this ones can do this as I
[2:06:30] pray as I cook no she didn't have any of
[2:06:32] any of those things but said she found
[2:06:34] two or more hours to pray every day down
[2:06:38] at the end of address with a lot of
[2:06:40] children what a little boy is not around
[2:06:42] out of their produce at John and it John
[2:06:46] and a Charles Charles that chat sorry
[2:06:50] that changed the course of the world
[2:06:52] save the world in that day she didn't
[2:06:54] have a washing machine and a dryer as we
[2:06:57] have today a dishwasher and so forth or
[2:06:59] a meet she didn't she did it all herself
[2:07:02] but yet she found she find time because
[2:07:06] she was putting on in
[2:07:07] to some children that finally changed
[2:07:09] the course of the world I think that is
[2:07:12] the old-fashioned mother the
[2:07:13] old-fashioned home where prayer and
[2:07:15] understanding of the Bible is amen
[2:07:18] that is what we as mothers we ask
