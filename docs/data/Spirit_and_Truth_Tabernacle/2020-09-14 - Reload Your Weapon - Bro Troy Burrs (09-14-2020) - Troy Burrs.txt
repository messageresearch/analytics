ain't gonna try to hold you too long let's go to the scriptures amen grab our bibles amen and uh we're going to start our reading this morning from the book of revelation revelation the 12th chapter amen in the beginning at the seventh verse y'all pray for me amen god is good amen it seemed like i could tell some of y'all were ready to go this morning amen it says in revelation again at the seventh chapter and there were there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not amen neither was there place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out and the old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels was cast out with him if we turn out you may be seated you may be seated maybe all that a blessing to the reading of his word let us you can go with me uh we're going to go to matthew 24. i don't want to keep you standing matthew 24 chapter and we're going to read amen from the third verse and it reads on this wise that uh and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world now i want you to notice they asked jesus three questions they they they we receded these disciples they they had they had they had questions in their mind they had need of an answer so what they did if we noticed here they went to him privately and i just want to i just want to punctuate this this morning by saying that if you have a question in your heart and in your mind go to him privately and ask him lord what would the what are these things this is what the disciples did so many times people have questions and they what happened is they allow the devil to come in and they tell you uh all kinds of things amen and you leave without your question being answered but i'm here to tell you that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever if he answered the disciples questions he'll answer your questions he'll ask you a question all you have to do is go privately and ask him amen so we see that there were three questions that he asked they asked him say lord uh uh let's see here the privilege saying tell us when shall these things be and tell us what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world now jesus answered their questions as jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you and ye shall hear of wars rumors of wars and ye shall not be troubled and all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet now i want you to notice that but he was telling them these things must come to pass but he was speaking in the present term on this scripture saying but these things are not yet let's read on he say for nations shall rise against nation kingdom shall rise against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places i say to you this morning this day this scripture is fulfilled this day he told them then these things but the end not yet he was speaking of things to come but i say to you this morning my brothers and sisters we are here we are here as we look into this a little bit uh we i want you to notice that uh a lot of times when we look at this we're looking at it uh uh uh on on a carnal spectrum we look at these things on on a broad spectrum with our educational thinking cap our ecclesiastical thinking cap but what what i want you to do this morning is is put on your spiritual thinking cap he's talking about wars and rumors of wars now let me tell you something there's many different types of wars because he that was a that was a there was a wars and rumors of war then he said their nation to be against nation then he said kingdom of this kingdom i want you to know the kingdom of god is within you and there's certainly a war going on amen i'll read it to you later we'll get to it but there's a war going on for yourself this war i read to you and revelations didn't start here this war started in glory long time ago okay but this war what it did is it came down here and just continued on earth the scripture says that in in revelation he said take heed uh uh uh he says uh let the devil in satan which deceiveth the whole world then when they turn around and ask him his question in matthew he's first thing he said take he that know me and deceive you it's telling you something that there's a great deception going on there's a great deception going on there are wars rumors of wars many types of wars there's corporate wars there's wars uh uh uh uh within that with political wars wars right now within our own nation one side against the other they warn in the streets they warn on the airways oh my gosh there's all kind of wars going on let me tell you something there's wars going on in your family children against the parents mothers against fathers there's a war going on that's wise against husbands and see who is the author of these wars satan is the author of these wars we're going to get somewhere let's look at something here uh in 1954 the message was preached and the statement was made now you know that in revelation 12th chapter the woman standing in the sun the red dragon put his tail around two-thirds of the stars pulled them to the earth we realized that satan in the beginning set up a kingdom in the northlands to be more beautiful than what that of michael's were amen and there was then declared a war in heaven and he pulled two thirds of the angelic beings with him amen with his tale it says he's not talking about t-a-i-l he's talking about a t-a-l-e he is the father of lies so what he did was he went and he by his lies deceived a third of the angels to believe his deception but see it was painted up so pretty painted up so pretty that even the angels believed him there's a place that the prophet said that those were the seeds of abraham i'll read it to you he said those were seeds of abraham amen so i want you to pay attention and he said nation against nation those seeds of abraham he told abraham you'll be the father of many nations there's a nation against a nation amen the bible says that ye are a peculiar people a holy priesthood a nation amen the nation is in you you are the you are the war the war against right and wrong now let me tell you something right and wrong got done got so convoluted to where people don't know right and wrong anymore everybody thinks they're right but there is a right and there is a wrong and the only way look the prophet said this right here he said one thing he said the devil he said you cannot you are no match for the devil without the baptism of the holy ghost the only one that has whooped him is our lord and savior jesus christ when he hung on calvary went down into hell whooped him and took the keys and without the baptism of the holy ghost you are no match for him [Applause] yo yo yo yo yo yo puny man it's no match for him that was in heaven at one time came down and watched god operate he studied god amen wars rumors of wars night of war we see amen that that uh you have to study your enemy our great nation they are they have we have satellites in the air constantly spying spying on our enemies and our allies watching their movements watching what they're doing they go over and they and they and they do oh they're shaking these you know they think this is just for show everybody everybody's sizing one another and let me tell you something the devil is always watching you and sizing you up and you know something you should be always watching the devil and sizing him up amen what you got amen watching your enemy studying his tactics to know how to counter act amen if if a nation has a new weapon they're watching to say okay this is what we got to do boys we're going to have to do this because they got something new and you should be doing the same thing wars rumors of wars nation against nation kingdom against kingdom don't look out far look right within yourself there's where the war is going on there's where the war is going on and the greater that war see look when these things when will the env wars rumors of wars nations that on every letter on every level national state local personal there's a war going on on every there's no peace nowhere everybody's uptight everybody got their finger on the trigger fear driving it satan motivating them amen amen now in the sixth seal prophet said they said matthew 24 uh uh he said pestilence now he that rides pestilence and death and when he had opened the fourth seal and i look and behold a pale horse a pale horse and his name that sat upon him is called death and hell followed him and power was given unto him over the four beasts of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth now see though nigmen was death almost 200 000 in a matter of months gone where are we at my brothers and sisters they ask them when shall the end be and you see what he told them and you see when we go back into revelation we see that these scriptures are being fulfilled and in revelations it's when the seals open it did was just let let us know how these things was going to come to pass ain't got jeffrey here jeffrey would have had me a rag or something up here amen i left mine but jeffrey don't make sure i don't sweat or he gonna bring me something hey man i miss that brother but we see amen that uh uh uh when the seals opened it just it it opened up the mysteries we knew that these things were going to happen thank you my brother but we didn't know how it was going to come about but we see here according to revelation when these seals open it it it let us know exactly how these things were gonna we're gonna take place and he says here now the fifth seal is 24th matthew 24 9-13 and when he had delivered up the afflictions and shall kill you there you are and ye shall be hated of all nations for my namesake matthew 24 this day this scripture is fulfilled amen and many shall betray many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another if this is not going on today if this isn't that i hate to see when that come on my god many false prophets shall rise and deceive many he said first he showed you that satan deceived the whole world with his tales i read it to you again the other place he called it fables in second timothy amen and then the first thing when they came to jesus and oh and they asked me to say be not deceived let no man deceive you there's a great deception going on and then it says here again in revelation it says that this many shall rise false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because that iniquity of bound the love of many shall wax cold amen now we see here i i'm just building a platform amen and we're gonna show you some things see because the bible say the weapons of our warfare are not carnal gun cells is through the roof everybody is arming themselves they're buying bullets they buy machine guns long guns and they standing on the corner saying it's my right people are going and they're taking classes and say i gotta get my permit i got to get my gun everybody loading up getting ready for the war but the bible says the weapon of our warfare is not carnal it's not carnal but it's mighty through god to the pulling down strongholds we're gonna get into some of that this morning and show you some of the weapons of god show you how just how to fight the enemy amen in the first seal he says now remember amen the antichrist is a smooth fellow he's smart just takes the holy spirit the only thing that can figure him out now he says here on the first seal 6303 18 135 he said notice trumpets means political disturbance wars matthew 24 jesus spoke of it now he said this is what jesus was speaking of you hear of wars and rumors of wars see all the way down through you remember jesus speaking that wars rumors of wars wars and rumors of wars come on down to the end now that's the trumpet sounding that's the trumpet sounding now when you get on those trumpets we'll get back there and pick up each one of those them wars and show you that the father they followed them churches show you how they follow the seals wars and rumors of wars but trumpets denotes a political disturbance i just want to make it real to you amen now we want to look at genesis the 17th chapter genesis the 17th chapter abraham amen abraham was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared unto abraham and said unto him i am almighty god before walk before me and be thy perfect and i will make a covenant between me and thee and will multiply thy seed exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and god talked to him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations thou shalt be a father of many nations now we know that there was ishmael and isaac hold that thought neither shall thy name any more be called abram but they shall be called abraham for your father of many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceedingly fruitful and will make uh and will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed there in in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto be to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto them and thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger in all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god amen and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant thou thou shall keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in in their generations it is my covenant which i shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and uh ye shall circumcise the flesh of the foreskin and it shall be a token amen of covenant between me and you and he had uh and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generation is born of the house and brought money uh in any stranger this is not of thy seed he that is born in the house and he that is brought the uh thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the circle the uncircumcised man shall whose flesh uh of is not the foreskin is not circumcised the soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant amen you know circumcision is is a type of the holy spirit amen and god said unto abraham and to sarah thy wife thy shall not call her name sarah but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her ye uh uh i will bless her and she shall be mother of nations kings of people shall be of her now i i made the statement early and say well we know he had it was isaac and it was ishmael amen but he said through sarah that he will make her mother of nations amen mother of nations so yeah we got many nations we're talking about uh uh of the seed of abraham amen and then you got ishmael and the ones and they're still fighting today in palestine and israel we got there's still bickering going on today but see god was talking about the nation through sarah abraham i make you a father of many nations but he specifically was talking about the covenant amen between sarah and abraham amen let's go on nation against nation now in 1961 he preached abraham and his seed after him reading from paragraph 84 he said and do you know uh i'm in some that the joneses live in a certain uh that don't have one thing to do with it god called you and you accepted the call and by your faith by accepting christ the royal seed of abraham which calls you then you justified by faith that's the only way that that i know of it that's the scripture as far as i know it i know i was a sinner ring god stopped me in the middle of my sin knocked at the door of my heart and turned and looked back and i said who is it he said i'm the lord and i said then lord let me come amen and i never stopped and said hey lord uh hey uh where where you at i want to talk to you a while see no you don't do that it's god that stops you so now it's by the grace of god that called you and not what you did what you could do what you will do if you were the seed of abraham god spoke to you by his amazing grace just like he did adam i'm sorry abraham just like he did abraham so you are a part of that nation amen even though it wasn't by physical birth amen but you are about he knocked at your heart and you accepted the call that makes you a part of that nation amen that nations are against amen nation against nation amen i just want you to understand who you are this morning amen so we look here politics low down nation corrupt that's going to put soldiers in shorts politics war politics is at the end dictators is wrong politics is wrong why didn't they stay with a godly king like david the great lord of england said this when democracy was formed it's all right now it's all right now but it'll come a time he said it'll be nothing it'll be all sales and no anchor and he's right said politicians stand on their soapbox on every corner and key and all kind of crooked things and corrupt government and the man and the man was right exactly what's going on right now a lot of empty promises amen so we look we we see that we can't put our faith we can't hang our soul on politics we can't hang our soul on politics there's three kinds of of of of uh i'm not sure what to call them but you have a democracy amen you have a monarchy and then you have a theocracy amen a democracy we see what it is it's uh uh uh one side and the other side and then these two war back and forth with each other and they hope to find somewhere a middle ground but when the whole thing is corrupt how do you find a middle ground of corruptionists when both sides are corrupt you just find a middle ground of corrupt amen now a monarchy is when you have a king who makes all of the decisions he says what it's going to be but a theocracy is when they take a prophet's word like a a samuel prophet samuel and when they always consult the prophet amen of the hour amen i want to be a part of a theocracy amen i'm not a part of no democracy or monocracy amen i'm going to take the word amen of a true prophet amen amen so we see here you must study your enemy you must know the tactics of your enemy amen in this war that we're fighting amen we'll look at here uh uh uh uh go with me to joshua the 24th chapter amen start at the 14th we're going to look here now therefore the lord and serve him i'm sorry now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods of your fathers serve on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve the lord now you see this is joshua talking to the children of israel after they had done sojourn amen after they hadn't been delivered a man out of bondage now he what he's doing at this point he's he's preparing them for a war he's he's he's gathering he's uniting his troops he's saying now look y'all we got a mixed multitude here but i want you to therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth notice he didn't say just serve him in sincerity because this day and our brothers and sisters you got to be more than just sincere you can be sincere and sincerely wrong cain was sincere and cain thought with everything within him that he was right but see god told him that if you do like your brother i'll accept your sacrifice too and he rejected it he rejected truth he rejected truth so joshua goes on here and says serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods of the father that on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose jesus day whom you will serve whether the gods of your father served that uh were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land we dwell but you see joshua made a claim and he said it but for me and my house we're going to serve the lord so what joshua was doing joshua was calling his troops together joshua's saying who's willing to fight on the lower side make your claim be known right now today where are you standing at amen do you serve the idols do you serve false gods or are you going to stand with the righteous are you going to stand with the lord amen he made his declaration right there amen now in the message conflict between god and satan i want to show you here that uh uh satan has many weapons we're talking about a warfare and when a warfare amen we got all kind of tactics they got spies they got central intelligence amen and they have they they always constantly trying to produce a greater weapon amen than the other side always trying to have a bigger something else or a bigger gun amen we'll see here prophets say we started out throwing rocks we moved up to to bow and arrow then they went to the sword amen then they went to the to the to the powder gun then elevated to to the revolver then they elevated to the machine gun and now today my brothers and sisters we got an atomic bomb that was back then and this time here in 1953 said we have an atomic bomb now we got something nuclear that'll just destroy everything man is going to destroy himself trying to destroy each other amen but the weapon of our warfare not come amen we are most certainly in a battle amen in a ba i ain't gonna say that yet in a battle we don't even have to fight amen take the war he says one general goes out to meet another general i mean as i said before that general is always sizing up the other general amen they're always spying he studies his enemies attack he know what he is doing where he's uh uh what he where he's going how he's going to work because he went over and spied it out we got spies everywhere here in america spies in england france germany they all got spies no matter how friendly we are we got spies on one another amen now we look at here cain amen accepted the devil's lie churches set themselves up as fountains of truth amen and yet their begotten children swear by them and will even kill to uphold their error if you think of that is an exaggeration this is where i was going at he said read second timothy the third chapter and the five verses uh uh the fourth chapter i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with a long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables fables tales lies from the devil amen why because see satan he knows how to dress things up so pretty he tell a lie behind a stone by behind a nice pretty pulpit and nice and he tell it he'll tell a lie in the cathedrals of gold but coming forth he he builded things up it's one of his tactics let me tell you another tactic of the devil one of his weapons misunderstanding he will come and he would tell you that the the if you don't understand and and and and you would get it all twisted up he will come and and just get you all mixed up on the inside he'll get you warm back and forth in your mind this one don't like me that one don't like me this one's going to sit next to me that one won't do this for me and get your mind all caught up in all those kind of things and when it boils down to it it's a misunderstanding what is he trying to do my brothers and sisters he's trying to distract you from your weapon one of the tactics in a battle is that if i can get the drop on you in a physical battle distract you say for example i throw something in your eyes now i can draw my weapon faster than you can draw your weapon because i distracted you that's all it is it's a distraction don't fall for it he want to get you so upset all day looking at the wrong things and he come right in next thing you know he done defeated you why because he distracted you from watching him he got you over here thinking something else misunderstanding tell you another one of satan's weapons of mass destruction you know he he he he he in heaven it started out because he wanted to have a kingdom more beautiful than michael's so he come down amen and he take eve the prophets say the most dangerous tool to a son of god is an ill-famed woman she dresses herself don't you know that that that satan is the woman's designer we used to at one point in time our nation used to get our clothes and our designs and our fashion material from france and most of those designers they're not people filled with the holy ghost of them i don't know no i don't know all these designers people clothes people be wearing anything but let me tell you something it is they are controlled by an evil spirit why because what he wants to do is to cause men to lust what he wants to do because see that's that's the devil i'm going to read it for you i'm going to read it for you in the bible i'll read i'm going to get to it but he what he wants to do is destroy he wants to destroy you with those kind of things let me tell you something i've been right here right here in the church and people have come to me and asked to be moved can i sit somewhere else because i don't want to be distracted with what this person is wearing in front of me watch how you dress when you come to church don't let the devil use you modesty modesty don't go out here to uh uh i don't know some of these stores and whatever and you get that thing and you put it on it you got to do this to get into it and all that don't worry here you shouldn't even be wearing it out yeah that's that ain't been designed by the devil look at the fashion in the clothes highlight this make this they make it's terrible make you lust trying to destroy sons of god and let me tell you something i ain't just talking about sisters i have had sisters come to me and complain and say that brother pan's too tight right in the house of the lord see see we all battle it's a war that is one of satan's tactics that is one of his weapons of mass destruction if he could get you to fall young people if he can get you to commit adultery fornication to the married man to the married woman get you to lust it's satan one of his tactics guard yourself don't let the devil use you as a tool another tactic of the enemy amen this biggest weapon is unbelief amen we were talking about the fables and those things that he'll tell you he's a liar and the father of lies amen he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll mix the word up twist everything all up in your mind amen and you know to have most of the problem because we don't use our weapon to combat it you have a weapon too but his primary goal is to make beautiful feel that your weapon is worthless amen to get you to feel that your weapon is worthless so he gets you to disbelieve the word reasoning compromising with the word of god amen he got eve to reason with the word amen and every ambulance and and and coughing you see now started from that point why because he used reasoning you can't reason with the word take it as it is amen we see amen amen i got that seal it's a p a appealing but amen let us go amen let's see here reasoning beauty amen unbelief now he says in victory day he said uh god comes again to take and he makes his kingdom here there will not be any different kind of spirit a german spirit a french spirit a norwegian spirit an american spirit that's what we have now each one of these nations they all kind of have their own spirit amen living in every heart that's right and there it will when when christ returns amen there will be one flag one nation one people one brotherhood a fatherhood of god a brotherhood of men a sonship then we find that because the people cause these great fusses amen tactic among the enemy and so forth long as satan controls it as long as satan controls it there is going to be wars and trouble and wars jesus said in saint john you hear of wars and rumors of wars why because the prince of the earth the satan the power of the nations there is a national spirit here a national spirit here its devils they can't get along with one another now that's something the devils can't get along with one another they can't even get along with one another amen but let's look here because god gave us some weapons as well amen he gave us something to fight with amen now he says here now along in this journey we promise to supply all of your needs everything everything that you have need of whatever you ask in my father's names that will i do whatsoever things whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe and receive it and you shall have it he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in the world and that's prayer prayer changes things he says a christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty god in the name of jesus he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize excuse me if the people could only realize that what is giving them right unto them anything that you ask for he will give it and you can appropriate the faith to believe it amen prayer is a weapon another weapon amen that you have at your disposal is the word of god amen we sing the song this is how i fight my battles amen jesus after he hungered fasted he used his great weapon he showed us by example how to use amen that weapon amen when the satan approached him amen he created his he he didn't go back and use some power he used the very same weapon that is at your disposal it is written it is written amen he used the weapon of the word amen to compact combat the enemy amen the prophet said here the word amen will defeat satan anytime anyplace amen when jesus was on the earth he believed that he was well he was emmanuel god was in the christ reconciling the world to himself so all the wall oh so all the great qualities of the father was in christ jesus the son when he was here on earth and the father uh was was his and all the fine gifts that god had he all that was was in christ but when he met satan he never used those gifts he just to be our example amen he brought it to where amen the very weakest of christians he said he had the power right then to rebuke satan and send him away what did he do he never referred to his power he used it is written and defeated satan amen me tell you something my brothers and sisters i come this morning prophet said there he said christ rolled up his sleeve amen and just took the devil out amen sometimes we have things we need to just uh uh buckle down amen and take the weapons amen that god they roll up our sleeve amen he has sometimes some of us he ravished our home amen he's he's torn apart our our relationships and our marriages amen he's take he's he's he's kicked the door in and he's taking our children amen he's taken he's come in and he's taking away your peace and your joy and your happiness amen roll up your sleeve put up your dukes amen and say it is written you have to fight back you have to stand strong amen to stand firm use the weapon that god gave you and defeat the enemy the prophet said it will defeat him any place anytime anywhere we are not going to stand silent and cower and run amen when the devil is running rush on over our families [Music] amen on the natural army we in a skirmish and everybody's giving a weapon everybody's giving a weapon and say well go out amen and and and the enemy is coming it may be uh uh uh uh uh uh a platoon amen of of of misunderstanding coming coming over the hill hey man we go to fight and everybody charge amen something's going to get wounded in the battle amen but fire your weapon when you come back amen and they expect your weapon and you ain't shot one shot what are you going to do with the talents that god gave you are you going to use what he gave you what a disgrace what a coward you would be to come back and your weapon ain't even you ain't fired or shot what have you been doing it shows that you would what you did you ran somewhere in here scattered you don't have to be afraid of the devil [Applause] you don't have to fear take the weapon that god gave you amen and defeat the enemy he gave moses a weapon moses one man he said go down and deliver my people he said well how do i go what i don't have a no army he said what's that in your hand a crooked stick he said let me show you how to use this weapon throw it down turn it to a snake not pick it up i'm gonna show you how to use this weapon you have the weapon it's nothing but a little stick but under the hand of faith and thus says the lord it is an atomic weapon [Music] and he marched down to israel with a crooked stick in his hand and delivered his people amen with the crooked stick because he used the weapon david he gave david a weapon david had a slingshot he said i got to teach you how to use this weapon so happen to know every every every son and daughter god must be tried must be tested amen your trials and your taxes what are they doing building faith muscles giving you confidence in your weapon so he sent them lying at david david weapon in his hand no doubt oh my goodness he swung that weapon what's that weapon left that slain shot it was all under the control of god it was no longer under david's control god stepped in you just fired a weapon i'll pinpoint where it lands [Applause] amen i'll pinpoint where it landed [Applause] the bear came they began the facebook was beginning to increase so the bear came he said well i did it again at the bear soon as it released god david didn't slay the bear thought slayed the bear with that rock david was just obedient to the voice amen so when this uncircumcised philistine come to try to defy the army of the living god david said wait a minute who is this uncircumcised philistine i defeated the lion by this time his faith muscles were bulging he'd been in the gym of of distress he'd been in the gym of trials and he come out looking oh man faith muscles all over the place or they tried to put them carnal weapons in his hand say god this don't feel right i ain't trained with this stuff amen he said the weapons of my warfare and cardinal amen i'm gonna use the weapon that god gave me amen so he went out and he slugged it amen and this giant fully armored amen there was only one place for that rock to land and god almighty after he released the rock he said you'd undone everything i told you to do and when that rock left you say now i got it from here i got it and that rock went right to the target god never misses he never misses he knows he don't studied him he know right where his weak point he never misses amen took the weapon amen and defeated the enemy amen another weapon that god gave us to our disposal amen he gave us prayer he gave us the word of god he gave us love he gave us love the prophet said is one of the most greatest weapons ever given he gave us love thinking about the prophet when he came across that killer bull he was going over to do the work of the lord he had to remember that the brother over there needed prayer but he said i'll just go across this bull go across this field and he forgot that this killer bull that had killed a colored fella uh or someone and they had bought the bull and the bill bull was in that field now this bull was a trained murderer he had killed before so the prophet is going on across the field and he got within feet of the bull and the bull stood up he immediately looked for a tree the tree was too far away he'll never make it he reached for his carnal weapon and realize he had left it in the car he said god did that because he had to build his faith muscles so you leave your whip in the car so he became mr bull i'm so sorry to disturb you you are creature of god as am i i am following the will of the lord to go over and pray for another creature of god if you'll allow me to pass when love projects grace sovereign grace takes over when love projects we just read quote out the core that what devil is doing at this time the love of many a wax coal but there's nation against nation but this nation we fight with love amen love is in our arsenal it is so different to what what what the other nations are doing amen that's why we're hated a hated nation amen so therefore we see that love is one of the weapons that god gave us another weapon that god gave us to our disposal amen is confession and committal confession and committal when you confess your faults come humbly before the lord and confess your faults and you can commit whatever you're going through into the hands of god he said that i can read it let me read let me read this he said that's the greatest weapon amen at thy word 1954 1207. only by your confession can you be saved that is the most powerful weapon that god put in the hand of man is a committal and a confession it'll do every time if you believe it accept it on those bases and believe it and stay with it keep confessing it when you confess it in other words the devil is always he'll john ryan came through the prayer line and was prayed for he was blind amen but his healing didn't happen right away but john ryan kept confessing it thank god i can see thank god i can see he's sitting in the barber chair thank god i can see people thought he was going crazy losing his mind what are you talking about man you still blind as a bad he said i thank god i can see his confession amen all of a sudden his eyes popped open and he ran at the bible shop still with foam on his face and the thing around him and running and said thank god i can see i can see i can see his confession if you have a misunderstanding because see we're talking about a natural eyes of seeing but see what we're really talking about is a spiritual opening of your eyes of understanding amen if you're confused if you have questions go to them and keep confessing i can see keep confessing i can see keep confessing i can see and one day your eyes will pop over you have to do is ask i want to know true there has to be a hunger and a thirst for righteousness he said if you all do that hunger and things for righteousness shall be full amen we talk about a lot of these things on a natural basis but put your spiritual thinking caps on amen confession and commitment now there's a perfect way in a permissive way and i feel that if god had on the platform can show me things that has been and in my room and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do but if but i feel as long as i got it all hooked up i have it all i feel like then he won't put his hands on it as long as i'm doing it should i read that again he want me to do but i feel as long as i've got it all hooked up or i feel like then he won't put his hands on it as long as i'm doing it in other words committed to him david when he slung his slingshot once that that rock left that sling he committed to the lord and said well lord now it's up to you i've done my part i'm leaving in your hands and i'ma go on loading the next rock amen loading the next rock and that's the way it is with anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them god can't fight your battle if you're fighting it yourself just let loose and let him do it just committed to him the greatest weapon that i know of of a christian today is a committal to god so now we got all of these weapons right at our disposal be going out to battle faith word love confession committal it's five smooth stones we got these at our arsenal but seeing today the weapon is no good if it don't have any ammunition acts 2 38 they asked the question men and brethren what must we do to be safe which one of the babies got baptized amen god gave a weapon and he promised her at even at her young age that she's a candidate right now for the baptism of the holy ghost and her weapon is cocked in law because see you can't you can't you can't you can't you can't handle this weapon without the holy ghost you can't handle it without the holy ghost the prophet was put to the test with those with those young lady with those young people making out in the front row he said that they're in your hands do what you will love project that's what the holy ghost would do he can't give this kind of power to anybody you have to load your weapon how do you load your weapon when you receive the holy ghost you are cocked and locked and ready to go amen so you go out to battle you go out to battle and you fight and you fight and you know i i was preaching there in okeechobee i said you know sometimes we get people you have different ones that's trapped behind enemy lines amen they they get wounded in battle and they become prisoners of war hey man when you become a prisoner of war amen you're tortured you're tortured we got loved ones right now that are caught behind enemy lines prisoners of war being tortured by the devil amen they're weak they're wounded they have gotten spiritual amnesia amen but what we ought to do is take that weapon of prayer take the weapon of love take that weapon of committal amen and go down on our knees and commit them to the hand of the lord and go back amen and claim those souls amen claim them amen take the weapon that god gave you and use it amen you can't be defeated amen so you go out amen and you you you fight the battle and sometimes we get weary we went over there on wednesday we shot all of our ammunition we got nothing else in our weapon we got the weapon but we've shot everything we need to go back amen and get reloaded acts 4. amen 15. but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the country they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do with these men see the the the the sadducees and the pharisees and things they were they was upset because they were preaching about jesus he says uh but they spread no further among the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name they are putting pressure on the saints of god you bet not say the name of jesus that's what they saying man you bet not say the name of jesus say it again we gonna do something to you and peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than to god judge ye for we cannot speak the things which we have seen seen and heard we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for which for that which was done for the man was above 40 years old and whom this miracle of healing was shown and being let go he went to uh their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them spies amen every good war happened and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in that is in them by whom mouth and thy servant david has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the king of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against christ for of the truth against thou holy child jesus whom thou has anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before be done and now behold and now the lord behold their threatness and grant unto thy servants that all with all boldness they make speak that that we may speak thy word by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done in the name of the holy child jesus and when they had prayed and the place was shaken and they were all assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost let me re-read that and the place amen when they had prayed the place was shaken and they were assembled together and they were all had their weapons reloaded and they all had their weapons reloaded amen they were reloaded and ready to fight come whatever you want amen so i say to you

trying they were trying with carnal weapons amen but they didn't know that there was a man of god in the vicinity amen that overheard the conversation and what happened he heard them and immediately what happened his heart went out so he took his weapon of love amen and then he began to pray for them so he took his weapon of love and of prayer amen and he applied it to their cause and destroyed that demon with that weapon of love with that weapon of prayer love prayer the word confession and commitment but first you have to load your weapons sometimes we get weak sometimes we get weary along
