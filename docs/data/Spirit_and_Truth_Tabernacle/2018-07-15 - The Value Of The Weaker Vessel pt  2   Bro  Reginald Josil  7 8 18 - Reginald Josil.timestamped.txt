[51:13] [Applause]
[51:18] god bless you baby seal amen we greet
[51:25] you church in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:27] Christ it's been a while since you've
[51:31] been here so with a pleasure to be here
[51:34] with you I love you every time I'm here
[51:41] I feel at home and I thank you for that
[51:47] because it's the way you receive me amen
[51:52] that allows me to feel at home the Lord
[51:56] bless you for that man I know that your
[51:59] pastor is not here called me to be here
[52:02] with you and a man has to trust another
[52:10] man you know to know that when he's
[52:14] going away he can trust and trust you as
[52:17] someone else to be with his church
[52:21] because I mean you guys need to
[52:24] understand this is not a joke
[52:26] I'm saying you are not a joke okay
[52:30] because you are the precious blood of
[52:32] Jesus Christ
[52:33] what about I'm saying you are more
[52:36] precious than that blood so you were
[52:40] given into brother Jack's he needs to to
[52:44] watch over so he needs to know who he
[52:48] can trust who gets them behind this
[52:51] Bobby because
[52:53] what's being said here is life and death
[52:56] you know and I think God that you know
[53:01] he trusts me enough to be here while
[53:03] he's not here you know I mean it's a
[53:10] blessing it's an honor that I don't take
[53:15] for granted what you guys to know that
[53:17] you know and that is why we're not here
[53:20] I preach to you my heart you know so I
[53:26] know sometimes I see you know words and
[53:29] [Music]
[53:30] forgive me me not for the word but you
[53:37] know it's not my will to hurt nobody but
[53:41] the word you know I just think that's
[53:49] wrong Amazing Grace you know that grace
[53:54] something that you did not deserve
[54:00] that didn't have to do it but yet he did
[54:04] it and there's a reason why he didn't
[54:10] and what you need to know my but you
[54:14] know to kind of bring that out in my
[54:16] message to be that the grace of God was
[54:21] actually for a specific group of people
[54:24] [Music]
[54:25] does that know who would receive that
[54:28] grace I know will not so I mean it's not
[54:36] like someone is gonna wake up to then oh
[54:37] my god okay now you know today I'm going
[54:40] to believe in God and I'm going to go to
[54:42] church I'm gonna change my life and then
[54:44] God is going to be like I did not know
[54:48] no nothing will surprise him I mean you
[54:54] and I son you know certain things we can
[54:56] do to it or oh my God thank you for the
[54:58] surprise I didn't know not to God
[55:00] you know there's nothing you can't
[55:02] surprise him he already know everything
[55:05] so His grace was designed for someone
[55:11] specifically
[55:14] you know because he didn't go die and
[55:17] then after that wait to see who's going
[55:19] to see and accept him just oh okay how
[55:25] he died for me oh I guess I should
[55:30] accept it no he died because you didn't
[55:34] knew you would accept it so he came made
[55:39] it happen so you can be where you are
[55:41] today that grace my brothers and sister
[55:47] hopefully I can help you see it through
[55:49] my message today because I believe last
[55:52] time I was here I started talking about
[55:53] them with the value of the weaker vessel
[56:00] and we're gonna continue on that same
[56:04] subject because it's really important
[56:08] today in the day that we live in people
[56:11] are leaving the message left and right
[56:12] for one reason because they don't
[56:15] believe it or they don't understand it
[56:19] the main reason is that they don't
[56:22] understand the message and in the
[56:26] pyramid days
[56:29] knowledge so knowledge is part of the
[56:34] message it means you must understand
[56:37] what you believe when God called you at
[56:41] first he didn't ask you to understand
[56:44] them to believe he asked you to believe
[56:47] then you will understand so so you will
[56:51] never be left without you no
[56:54] understanding it's part of it just it's
[57:01] in my heart it's wrong for you to be
[57:05] here and not knowing why well I'm I love
[57:10] God I'm here I don't need to understand
[57:13] that's not sure that's a lie of the
[57:17] devil it's not sure you have to
[57:19] understand because you know why there is
[57:24] light the light was given for a purpose
[57:27] to see were you going so God is the
[57:32] light
[57:32] God is understanding so you just you
[57:36] need to understand the message why are
[57:39] you here because otherwise you should
[57:41] should leave just like everybody else
[57:44] you know so we here today hopefully we
[57:48] can bring out no understanding about the
[57:51] message to help you in your walk amen
[57:56] I bless the newly bright a man we got
[58:02] bless her can say Shalom anymore amen
[58:11] sister maybe bless your marriage god
[58:15] bless you I can't see I wish I could
[58:26] [Laughter]
[58:34] Amazing Grace yes thank you I mean can
[58:40] make a joyful noise but I can't see
[58:43] [Music]
[58:57] [Applause]
[59:00] [Music]
[59:09] [Music]
[59:16] [Music]
[59:27] [Music]
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:25] amen bless you
[1:00:30] so we are with the world we're going to
[1:00:35] read in first Peter chapter three one
[1:00:38] verse verse 7 thank you my sisters
[1:00:55] first Peter 3 verse 7 it's a husband's
[1:01:00] likewise dwell with them which is your
[1:01:04] wife with understanding giving honor to
[1:01:08] the wife as to the weaker vessel and as
[1:01:13] being they being hares together or the
[1:01:17] grace of life that your prayers may not
[1:01:20] be hindered man may God add blessing to
[1:01:24] his words you may be seated
[1:01:25] amen the value of the weaker vessel we
[1:01:35] started last time fully we can get a
[1:01:39] little bit deeper in this end again the
[1:01:45] reason why I got for this in my heart
[1:01:47] it's because of things that have seen
[1:01:49] that's going on around the message grown
[1:01:54] young people adult you know leaving left
[1:02:00] and right and then after that the way
[1:02:03] they talk about the message and you can
[1:02:05] understand it's a lack of understanding
[1:02:09] but truly the will seed will not depart
[1:02:23] if you are called by God we all know
[1:02:28] that but what I'm preaching saying you
[1:02:29] know and it doesn't ask us to understand
[1:02:32] when he's called you first called you he
[1:02:36] doesn't ask you to understand but he
[1:02:41] never said you will never understand you
[1:02:44] will remain without understanding he
[1:02:47] never said that
[1:02:48] he also said come as you are
[1:02:51] he never said you will stay the way you
[1:02:54] are okay so come as you are yes because
[1:03:00] if you can help yourself you don't need
[1:03:02] God
[1:03:03] you know you don't if you can't change
[1:03:07] yourself what's the use you know we
[1:03:11] don't need them but he wants you to come
[1:03:16] just the way you are so you know that he
[1:03:18] is able to change you and that is why
[1:03:23] sometimes you know I talk to people and
[1:03:25] they let you know I I feel like I'm not
[1:03:29] ready to come to God because I got so
[1:03:31] much going on and I should leave this
[1:03:36] first I should stop doing this first and
[1:03:39] then I can come together I'm like then
[1:03:40] if you can you might as well stay where
[1:03:43] you are you know because when you come
[1:03:48] to God already fix what is going to be
[1:03:51] left for him to fix you know that is a
[1:03:55] mechanic is that the right word
[1:03:59] okay so he likes broken cars so don't
[1:04:08] feel bad because you're broken because
[1:04:12] God is feeling good because you're
[1:04:15] broken because he knows he can fix you
[1:04:18] you know so don't feel bad cuz he wants
[1:04:25] you broken so you know he can fix now
[1:04:33] let's say that I I have a mechanic you
[1:04:40] know and I have a car and my car is
[1:04:44] never broken down how will I know this
[1:04:46] guy is good when there's nothing wrong
[1:04:50] ever with my car to bring to him so he
[1:04:54] can prove to me he's worth you know and
[1:05:01] for me it's like I'm gonna be looking at
[1:05:04] like okay I don't know you know you
[1:05:07] don't have to stay around because I
[1:05:09] don't need you right now my car is
[1:05:11] working perfectly you know
[1:05:14] can I don't have any problem with my car
[1:05:16] but I'm going to know what it's capable
[1:05:20] of when my car breakdown on the highway
[1:05:24] and now I need I need someone to help me
[1:05:30] so it's the same thing for your life if
[1:05:33] your life is all good you only know God
[1:05:39] you need no one but the minute your life
[1:05:44] you broken like you know you're broken
[1:05:48] and you can't fix it yourself that's
[1:05:53] when you come to realize you know the
[1:05:56] how God is able to do things for you
[1:05:59] because why does it say in the Bible
[1:06:02] when you weaker like when you in your
[1:06:05] worse it's when you can't really do
[1:06:10] anything for yourself that's when you
[1:06:11] step in cause the mill you know as long
[1:06:15] as we know we can we know we can go
[1:06:18] there and knock and we can get whatever
[1:06:20] we need that is just gonna stand and
[1:06:22] wait for you until you can't anymore now
[1:06:28] I want you to know something you know
[1:06:32] the message like to fix book and things
[1:06:35] because the message is God okay so if
[1:06:40] you in the message and you feel broken
[1:06:43] don't run away from it but rather ask
[1:06:46] what's the worth of it to prove you know
[1:06:49] get the message prove to you it's worth
[1:06:53] you see you can Lord you send this
[1:06:57] message I'm broken please show me the
[1:07:00] worth of what you say God likes to be
[1:07:06] challenged so Challenger you know so
[1:07:11] again it's a lack of understanding
[1:07:13] that's why people are living the message
[1:07:15] left and right you know
[1:07:21] and it's heartbroken so now you have
[1:07:24] your sons and daughters you gave all to
[1:07:28] raise them right in the message that you
[1:07:31] know deep down in your heart that it's
[1:07:35] the truth and for them after they you
[1:07:39] know become of age and they feel like
[1:07:42] you know what mouth what you thought was
[1:07:44] right it's not right and then they think
[1:07:46] they know better and they get up and
[1:07:48] leave
[1:07:49] it's going to you know you're going to
[1:07:52] be heartbroken you know and you don't
[1:07:55] want that it's the same for a pastor
[1:07:59] trying to do all he can bring forth the
[1:08:01] words to the people and then suddenly
[1:08:03] have the church get up and say they
[1:08:06] don't believe you know everything you've
[1:08:09] been preaching for the last 20 years
[1:08:10] never done anything for them you know
[1:08:14] they get up and leave it's like nothing
[1:08:17] like okay so 10 years it's like you
[1:08:22] never really believed what was you know
[1:08:25] spoken here so it's a must for us to
[1:08:29] have an understanding of the message
[1:08:31] there's no way out of it can't serve God
[1:08:35] without understanding you can't you know
[1:08:41] so he set revelation so you can
[1:08:45] understand that is the purpose of
[1:08:47] Revelation okay cuz once it was hidden
[1:08:52] so revelation comes to do what to open
[1:08:55] it so you can see and understand that's
[1:08:58] the whole purpose of it I'm gonna read
[1:09:02] this quote for you because we're gonna
[1:09:04] kind of go through most of the codes so
[1:09:07] we can bring our what we would like to
[1:09:08] bring out by the grace of God now in
[1:09:10] this message called what here is down
[1:09:13] Elijah
[1:09:14] preach 1959 April 12 1959 Pagar 34 I'm
[1:09:25] gonna read this for you and you're going
[1:09:29] to understand something about the
[1:09:32] message
[1:09:33] and but when I was talking we friend to
[1:09:35] a man named John Sproul and he said John
[1:09:40] sprawl a friend of mine taking his wife
[1:09:42] and took a trip over to I'll say
[1:09:48] chlorine friends and the guide was
[1:09:51] taking them through a strand garden and
[1:09:53] he showed them a statue of the Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ in the garden there was
[1:09:58] that statue so in the end brothers Paul
[1:10:01] said he was looking at that statue he
[1:10:04] said what did the sculpture sculptor
[1:10:08] have in his mind when he was making the
[1:10:11] statue so he was looking at it but he
[1:10:14] can figure out what was the man taking
[1:10:17] off when oh when he was doing that then
[1:10:21] why I don't see any suffering of Christ
[1:10:25] I don't see anything just looks like the
[1:10:29] statue what does that mean so it's
[1:10:31] looking at the statue and his asking
[1:10:33] question but it doesn't mean anything to
[1:10:35] him
[1:10:35] the way he was looking at it and the
[1:10:39] guide said to him mr. Ashbaugh you
[1:10:43] perhaps criticizing that statue said I
[1:10:47] am said I don't know what the sculpture
[1:10:50] had in his mind he said the thing of it
[1:10:54] is you have to know what this sculpture
[1:10:57] had in his mind before you can see what
[1:11:00] he was trying to do so we receive a
[1:11:05] message and most of us is asking okay
[1:11:09] what what is this what is this message
[1:11:14] but you have to know what was in God's
[1:11:16] mind to know what's the message about
[1:11:19] okay so you have to be in the sculptures
[1:11:25] mind
[1:11:26] he said now come down here the guide
[1:11:30] told mr. Stroud to come down because
[1:11:35] apparently he was somewhere up looking
[1:11:38] at the statue okay anyway down to the
[1:11:43] foot of the cross
[1:11:45] and there was a pod he said kneel down
[1:11:50] and said now look up so mr. sprong was
[1:11:55] looking at the statue while he was
[1:11:58] standing up while he was tearing up he
[1:12:01] could not see anything like any real
[1:12:05] thing that would make the statue like
[1:12:07] stand out so it was it looked like any
[1:12:11] ordinary life statue for him so the
[1:12:15] guide said the way you looking at it you
[1:12:19] can fully see what was in the sculptures
[1:12:22] mind so you have there's a way you have
[1:12:27] to look at it so steady enough is wrong
[1:12:31] so the guide is gonna tell him how to
[1:12:36] see the message behind the statue so he
[1:12:41] said to him come mr. Schwaab kneel down
[1:12:44] and look up so you can't stand up and
[1:12:50] look up thinking you can really see
[1:12:56] anything that's well in order for you to
[1:13:00] see the will something truly like we're
[1:13:04] the real thing the real meaning of God
[1:13:07] you get stood up and seeing you but you
[1:13:10] have to kneel down to see it so standing
[1:13:14] up looking at the stature he couldn't
[1:13:15] see anything but the guy said come down
[1:13:18] kneel down and said now look up and mr.
[1:13:22] Strauss said he thought in his rod would
[1:13:25] break because now he's kneeling there
[1:13:29] was every agony that Jesus went through
[1:13:32] on the cross all featured in the statue
[1:13:36] so standing up he couldn't see it but
[1:13:40] once he kneel down now he could see it
[1:13:44] looking at the message standing up you
[1:13:47] will not see not understand anything but
[1:13:49] when you go down on your knee
[1:13:54] when you go down on your knees and you
[1:13:58] look up there you will be able to see
[1:14:02] the reason of the message so you have to
[1:14:06] kneel down not standing up and talk at
[1:14:08] home para bellum said this and this is
[1:14:12] contrary to the Bible where do you get
[1:14:18] your coming to say that what he said is
[1:14:22] culture to the Bible like how did you
[1:14:27] get that idea where does it where did it
[1:14:30] come from
[1:14:31] on what ground you are base you know for
[1:14:35] your for what you saying
[1:14:39] because you can't just say something is
[1:14:42] wrong when you have no base for it no
[1:14:45] foundation for it so now if you choose
[1:14:48] the Bible to say what about I'm said was
[1:14:51] wrong and you say and it's the Bible you
[1:14:54] use it to say what is it was wrong so I
[1:14:56] just forgot to go back in the Bible
[1:14:58] again and read it over to see what he
[1:15:05] said was it culture to the Bible but
[1:15:07] still standing up you won't see it
[1:15:10] meaning we drive you can't see it so you
[1:15:17] can never reach God you know by standing
[1:15:22] up can never find him by standing up the
[1:15:26] only way to find God is to come down you
[1:15:32] know so as he's nailed down he said I
[1:15:35] saw every agony that Jesus went through
[1:15:38] on the cross all feature he said you see
[1:15:42] sir the statue was made to get down and
[1:15:48] look up not stand off and look over the
[1:15:53] message wasn't given to stand up and
[1:15:56] look over at but it was given to kneel
[1:15:59] down and look up
[1:16:02] so the first thing you need don't just
[1:16:08] get up and leave because of something
[1:16:10] that is said that doesn't fit well for
[1:16:12] you what you need to do is kneel down go
[1:16:19] down on your knee pray because praying
[1:16:24] is looking up see while you pray in your
[1:16:29] head is battle right but yet your prayer
[1:16:32] is going on
[1:16:36] so you nail him down and he said look
[1:16:40] that you look up so yawn when you nail
[1:16:43] him down it's in your prayer that you're
[1:16:45] looking up to God for him to come down
[1:16:47] and you know the graceful not you
[1:16:49] because you cannot again understand this
[1:16:54] message in your pride get away get out
[1:17:00] of yourself and say Lord well you know
[1:17:05] what again it's not the amount of prayer
[1:17:10] that gives you the revelation of this
[1:17:12] message anyway let me let me let let me
[1:17:16] bring this out thing it's not the how
[1:17:20] you pray it's not the like you 40 days
[1:17:27] of fasting Oh teddy
[1:17:31] however long you wanna do it that will
[1:17:33] bring you the revelation of the message
[1:17:36] because it's actually given to a chosen
[1:17:43] people because I'm gonna tell you this
[1:17:46] the bride never had to pray to receive
[1:17:50] the revelation of the message I mean you
[1:17:56] still have to pray I'm not saying go
[1:17:57] brain but the bride of Jesus Christ it's
[1:18:00] not because she prayed then God gave her
[1:18:05] the revelation no it was made for her
[1:18:10] praying or not
[1:18:15] what are you prey or not if you are the
[1:18:19] bride and will come to you and that's a
[1:18:24] no great but what I need you to
[1:18:28] understand is that but this revelation
[1:18:31] the message was brought and was sent to
[1:18:35] a specific group of people and those
[1:18:38] people got know them he know he knew who
[1:18:41] they are no matter where you are the
[1:18:48] message will find you and I'm gonna tell
[1:18:54] you this before we continue you cannot
[1:18:57] pray enough to bring your husband in the
[1:19:01] message you can never pray enough to
[1:19:06] bring your wife in the message you can
[1:19:10] never pray enough to bring your children
[1:19:13] in the message never your prayer is not
[1:19:20] what make God bring people in the
[1:19:24] message
[1:19:25] no no so therefore you cannot pray and
[1:19:33] ask God please Lord I want my children
[1:19:40] in the message because the message is
[1:19:45] for the bride so if your children are
[1:19:49] not part of the bride they can never be
[1:19:50] in the message because the message can
[1:19:55] save anyone true salvation is not just
[1:20:03] for the bride salvation is for everyone
[1:20:07] living on earth okay
[1:20:10] salvation is for everyone but the
[1:20:14] rapture is for a specific group of
[1:20:16] people the message is for a specific
[1:20:20] group of people the message did not come
[1:20:22] to save
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:28] the message was never said to save
[1:20:31] people the message was sent to gather a
[1:20:34] bride so no matter what I would try to
[1:20:44] bring out if you're not part of the
[1:20:46] value in the beginning so if you stay
[1:20:51] it's that because you're better than
[1:20:53] those who live if you stay it's because
[1:20:57] that something is holding you here not
[1:21:01] in the church this building in the
[1:21:03] message because you can never go in the
[1:21:06] rupture outside of the message okay
[1:21:10] because if I'm trying to go to Haiti
[1:21:12] I cannot stay here and get on the
[1:21:15] airplane
[1:21:16] what do I have to do go where to the
[1:21:20] airport so therefore that is a place I
[1:21:22] must be for me to go to Haiti so to go
[1:21:26] to the rapture there's a place you must
[1:21:29] be and God prepare the place for you to
[1:21:32] be ah
[1:21:32] and that place is the message well
[1:21:38] whether they stay or leave
[1:21:43] so the message is none other than the
[1:21:52] God you are praying sir okay now and
[1:21:58] that message also is none other than you
[1:22:05] so the message was sent to people that
[1:22:12] were already a message themselves so
[1:22:17] it's just that this the message is like
[1:22:24] the bridegroom that was missing apart so
[1:22:30] he come out to look for his other half
[1:22:35] so this message is the God you are
[1:22:40] praying to which is the Lord Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ that same Lord Jesus Christ went
[1:22:46] out left his throne come down looking
[1:22:51] for his other half then his other half
[1:22:54] can never be anything else
[1:22:57] but the message so therefore to be in
[1:23:03] the message you have to be the message
[1:23:06] to stay in it I mean I'm trying to help
[1:23:15] you see something so I'm gonna go read
[1:23:24] some quotes for you because I don't want
[1:23:25] to go ahead over myself
[1:23:29] let me read let me read this for you
[1:23:34] didn't bring my phone because I want to
[1:23:36] try now watch the time thank you
[1:23:44] all right now but when I preached a
[1:23:48] message called the masterpiece which in
[1:23:50] 1964
[1:23:52] that's like July 8th 1964 proud of 46 he
[1:23:57] said as he begin to work upon creeping
[1:24:01] things so that's when God was making you
[1:24:03] know the creation like open the little
[1:24:06] animals upon earth and then he began to
[1:24:10] bring it from that it's into something
[1:24:13] else higher then finally he brought it
[1:24:16] into a larger animals such as the lion
[1:24:19] tiger bear then he brought it into the
[1:24:24] life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so
[1:24:27] forth now not an evolution the way that
[1:24:33] creates because there is always a
[1:24:36] pattern like a trace from one species
[1:24:40] species to the other it looks like
[1:24:43] evolution so to the science mind
[1:24:47] it's evolution but its creation okay so
[1:24:52] what they call evolution is what that
[1:24:54] calls creation that is why the science
[1:24:58] said there's a missing leg okay so that
[1:25:04] missing link because that's why they say
[1:25:05] old men from apes you'll become what you
[1:25:09] are now that was the last time you seen
[1:25:12] it become a man I mean we've been saying
[1:25:15] man from ape so when was the last time
[1:25:18] science proved to you they observe
[1:25:22] because I'm gonna tell you why I'm
[1:25:24] saying this and you're gonna see we know
[1:25:27] how a butterfly is made right
[1:25:30] don't science show you how a butterfly
[1:25:33] become a butterfly
[1:25:36] dude what they do it from one
[1:25:39] caterpillar
[1:25:40] so therefore science has their
[1:25:42] microscope in a low wherever that thing
[1:25:46] is so they look at it like look at this
[1:25:48] alright alright now after 10 days brings
[1:25:52] a butterfly okay so therefore when I'm
[1:25:58] looking at a butterfly I can truly say
[1:26:00] that was once a caterpillar
[1:26:02] now you said I come from an ape you must
[1:26:07] show me show me prove it to me just like
[1:26:14] you prove the butterfly from account
[1:26:16] will prove to me and men for many but
[1:26:20] they can never do it but yet they keep
[1:26:23] on chained you from egg well today not
[1:26:27] me summer creation alright so if they
[1:26:34] can't show it to you they need to shut
[1:26:36] up
[1:26:38] oh what a wretched day go to school they
[1:26:42] have PhD in this I have g.od that's what
[1:26:49] I have a g.od God is what I have all
[1:26:53] right so right from the whip and the way
[1:26:58] it was gonna be like me no app is ever
[1:27:00] going to be like me okay no it was
[1:27:04] created in God's image so don't come for
[1:27:07] me and say hold from ape no no sir so
[1:27:14] just little tips whenever they save you
[1:27:16] from it and tell them that so it was not
[1:27:25] an evolution that was a complete
[1:27:28] creation God working in a pattern but
[1:27:31] finally then there came forth upon the
[1:27:33] earth of perfection and that was a man
[1:27:36] and then he could see in that men that
[1:27:39] look like him the men look like God
[1:27:43] because the men looked like God that's
[1:27:46] why the men was called a perfection okay
[1:27:53] that was the perfection so a perfection
[1:27:57] and that was a man and then he could see
[1:27:59] in that man that he it looked like him
[1:28:02] that men look like God and now when he
[1:28:07] looked up on him he was a reflection of
[1:28:11] what his create or was so what about
[1:28:15] what I need you to understand what the
[1:28:17] men looked like is what God look like
[1:28:23] whatever that the man however the man
[1:28:26] was it was perfectly the same way God
[1:28:30] was okay so he was a reflection of what
[1:28:35] his creator was so no matter how you
[1:28:39] look at Adam how you turn him that was
[1:28:43] you can say that's God because he looked
[1:28:47] like him act like him feels the same way
[1:28:51] God
[1:28:51] he'll pick the way God thinks so Adam
[1:28:56] and God was like a mirror image to each
[1:29:00] other now
[1:29:03] in Prague afford yet the same message he
[1:29:07] said and then I might say to this that
[1:29:09] when he made this man this man there was
[1:29:12] something about him yet that didn't look
[1:29:15] just right remember God created a lot of
[1:29:20] perfect men but yet when God looked of
[1:29:24] it okay
[1:29:26] so that man he said something is still
[1:29:29] not right wait I need you to get this
[1:29:33] because we're gonna get somewhere
[1:29:36] he made a perfect man but yet after that
[1:29:40] when he looked over to the man he's like
[1:29:43] still something here right so remember
[1:29:47] the men and God is the same okay so
[1:29:55] therefore if God could look over to him
[1:29:58] and said still something and right
[1:30:00] so therefore when God looked at himself
[1:30:01] you can say the same thing okay cuz I
[1:30:08] want you to understand that because
[1:30:10] these things are not just said to be
[1:30:12] said because that's reason behind these
[1:30:15] see this what I'm saying if you know the
[1:30:17] message you've got to understand it so
[1:30:20] when God looked over to Adam and it's
[1:30:22] like something there right so it tells
[1:30:24] me when he look up himself he feels the
[1:30:27] same way all right so because and and he
[1:30:34] said and yet that didn't look just right
[1:30:38] because he was by himself so he created
[1:30:45] a perfect man but because that man was
[1:30:48] alone something was missing
[1:30:52] now so if that can look at the men in
[1:30:56] his life but he look lonely so it tells
[1:31:00] me God once was lonely so he displayed
[1:31:07] in Adam not he felt because Adam was the
[1:31:13] mirror image of God
[1:31:15] so whatever God felt I don't feel okay
[1:31:21] alright so because he was by himself and
[1:31:25] that's how God had been by himself he
[1:31:29] was eternal and the men now in the image
[1:31:33] of that also existed on earth by himself
[1:31:36] so he must have what shrunk a little
[1:31:41] blow over on his left side
[1:31:44] I mean you see what this thing is going
[1:31:47] to write struck a low-blower on his left
[1:31:51] side and from there he took the piece
[1:31:55] that struck off of it and a medium or
[1:31:59] helped make or what a wife so what I
[1:32:03] need you to understand my room just read
[1:32:05] god looked at Adam he saw Adam was
[1:32:09] running and Adam surely felt lonely
[1:32:11] because the Bible say when that brought
[1:32:14] all the animals before Adam he looked at
[1:32:18] them they came in pair before Adam so
[1:32:22] Adam saw each and every one was male and
[1:32:25] female after he done name all of the
[1:32:29] animals over in the garden so now he
[1:32:33] looked at himself Adam okay
[1:32:37] Adam looked at himself and it's like
[1:32:41] there was nothing like me right
[1:32:46] he said that in the Bible now Adam said
[1:32:49] he'd find nothing like him it's the same
[1:32:55] thing that happened with God that
[1:32:57] created the heavens
[1:33:00] could the stars the moon and then then
[1:33:04] planets in all these things then come
[1:33:08] and create angels out of all the things
[1:33:13] God created and he sat back one day
[1:33:16] looked at himself and still feel lonely
[1:33:20] because when God looked over all the
[1:33:23] creation there was nothing like him he
[1:33:27] felt lonely so that looked at the angels
[1:33:32] and just beautiful things right that's
[1:33:35] what we say beautiful but I said that
[1:33:40] over my home church once you know you
[1:33:42] more beautiful than an angel did you
[1:33:46] know that no angel can compare to you
[1:33:49] see you can say Amen cause for you in
[1:33:52] your head angel is oh pretty butter

[1:33:58] mean oh you've seen what they show you

[1:34:10] want to tell you even if you seen it the
[1:34:11] word angel I want you to know this no
[1:34:16] angels no angels is as pretty as you are
[1:34:25] why no angels was created in that image
[1:34:29] so therefore is there more prettier than
[1:34:31] you then I guess God is you know
[1:34:39] okay now i'ma tell you this my young
[1:34:43] sisters when a young boy I come to you

[1:35:21] everything beautiful pickup line girl

[1:35:33] therefore they refer and see you like
[1:35:36] you an angel because who's up there
[1:35:39] angels alright so how is that when you

[1:35:44] don't let no young man call you a demon
[1:35:47] anymore because I'm gonna tell you this
[1:35:51] you didn't know this gods and Joel are
[1:35:56] still in heaven the angels are on earth
[1:35:59] are demons you know angel oh oh you
[1:36:06] didn't know now you do see you laughing
[1:36:12] but it's the truth
[1:36:13] and Jose if a man say I was heavy when
[1:36:18] you left it
[1:36:18] what do you mean am I going back on my
[1:36:20] stay here which because if you stayin
[1:36:27] we got a problem here that's that's what
[1:36:30] you call a fallen angel who can't go
[1:36:32] back up so you and your fallen angel
[1:36:35] you took cute you took breathing alright
[1:36:42] so let them know I didn't listen my bad
[1:36:44] I mean I know you know you trying to you
[1:36:46] know go with this beautiful pickup line
[1:36:48] but
[1:36:49] I'm a creation of God made in His image
[1:36:52] so I'm prettier than an angel one
[1:36:55] - I know fun an angel okay
[1:37:01] so god bless you I mean my brothers I
[1:37:04] mean if you want another pick-up line
[1:37:05] you gonna have to look for another one
[1:37:06] alright so love you
[1:37:09] please don't hit me alright so an angel
[1:37:17] was never made in God's image so an
[1:37:21] angel may look perfect to you but to cut
[1:37:26] the perfection is you okay and angels to
[1:37:31] your eyes is something perfect but to
[1:37:34] God the perfection is you nothing else
[1:37:38] there is not ensure that God ever color
[1:37:41] masterpiece
[1:37:43] what is a masterpiece is something that
[1:37:45] the sculpture can never make higher or
[1:37:48] better than an angel will never be able
[1:37:53] to be better than you so anything God
[1:37:59] Himself can never ever make or create
[1:38:01] anything better than you
[1:38:05] so because given God Himself can never
[1:38:08] create anything better than you then
[1:38:09] tell me who's above you okay so nothing
[1:38:18] nothing angels fear God never bothered
[1:38:25] they feel God okay let them go but you
[1:38:31] feel that got up is that nada
[1:38:36] they bother him when you feel he trouble
[1:38:40] it you trouble God since you fell that
[1:38:45] never rested and just fell before you
[1:38:51] God went on eating partying having fun
[1:38:58] how did they do it up there we're gonna
[1:39:01] find out when we go oh we go find out
[1:39:03] brother
[1:39:04] yes so whatever they do up there we go
[1:39:07] find out as a matter of fact we're going
[1:39:09] to be the party let's leave this alone
[1:39:11] so he never bothered but when you fear
[1:39:16] Oh heaven God left his throne for you
[1:39:31] never did it find you
[1:39:37] so the love of God is not for an angel
[1:39:40] but it's for you so you're looking at
[1:39:44] angels how we gods and God is looking at
[1:39:46] you do you even know who you are so
[1:39:52] change your mind about angel now okay so
[1:39:59] dad felt lonely just like Adam Adam for
[1:40:06] God to take away his loneliness what did
[1:40:09] God do put him to sleep take a bride out
[1:40:12] of him right all right we get in
[1:40:19] somewhere let me read this for you now
[1:40:22] okay you're gonna get there in the
[1:40:26] message called Corinthians book of
[1:40:29] Correction preaching March 14 57
[1:40:40] actually April April 1457 bagua 49 I
[1:40:50] feel can find it so we can read it here
[1:40:57] for you now he said in Quentin's book of
[1:41:04] Correction zero for 1457 tiger 49 now
[1:41:11] god when he made men he made him a dual
[1:41:17] person both male and female the men
[1:41:22] we're talking about here was not flesh
[1:41:28] that's Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 27 the
[1:41:32] creation of men is different from the
[1:41:36] making up from the from the making of
[1:41:40] men so in Genesis chapter 1 that create
[1:41:44] men in chapter 2 he made men so God
[1:41:50] created men a to a person male and
[1:41:54] female that's why I said let them in
[1:41:58] Genesis chapter 1 he created he them so
[1:42:08] that men in spirit was - please
[1:42:16] understand the men is the mirror image
[1:42:21] of who God if the man is spirit in
[1:42:25] spirit was - then it tells me God in
[1:42:28] spirit was - now my own sisters there's
[1:42:36] no way I'm bringing trying to bring this
[1:42:37] up just like that it's because I'm gonna
[1:42:40] say this when you hear in the message
[1:42:42] but I'm going to preach the hardest on
[1:42:44] women the reason is that women you my
[1:42:50] sisters
[1:42:51] are the mirror image of what God had in
[1:42:56] his mind for him when he was creating
[1:43:01] everything you see so God just like Adam
[1:43:07] Adam was a dual person then so was God
[1:43:11] because my Bible said he made men in his
[1:43:13] likeness so whatever that was the Adam
[1:43:16] was the man was okay so Adam was lonely
[1:43:24] when in his spirit he was - there was no
[1:43:28] one like him what did that God have to
[1:43:30] do he had to put him to see okay now he
[1:43:37] said here he separate him in flesh same
[1:43:40] message and put him here on earth and
[1:43:43] the female part was still in spirit look
[1:43:48] friends that was so careful don't let
[1:43:53] this leave you god never now listen
[1:43:57] close got a head full of dust and made
[1:44:00] an Eva why had it taken a handful of
[1:44:06] dust separate from the creation from
[1:44:11] Adam had he took another so it would
[1:44:14] have to speak out a female spirit by
[1:44:18] itself because brother Branham says in
[1:44:22] the message women are not in the
[1:44:25] original creation okay why because in
[1:44:32] Adam was the reflection of God God
[1:44:37] doesn't have a separate did not have a
[1:44:39] separate spirit of being next to him so
[1:44:43] when he made man he couldn't admit what
[1:44:46] he looked like one but yet in that one
[1:44:50] God there was you the bride
[1:44:54] so in Adam was his bride okay so since
[1:45:03] that was one there was no - there was no
[1:45:06] female spirit next to God o female being
[1:45:08] next to God none of that so when it's
[1:45:13] Adam into existence because that's
[1:45:15] the original creation the spoken word is
[1:45:18] the original creation so when he said
[1:45:21] you are not in the original creation it
[1:45:22] means you are not spoken out like he
[1:45:26] spoke on the tree like his for the
[1:45:29] animals out that he spoke the man out he
[1:45:32] did not speak you out but there's a
[1:45:33] reason so when it struck Adam into
[1:45:38] existence though he did not spit the
[1:45:41] woman out into existence but yet in Adam
[1:45:45] was her so because of that when he made
[1:45:51] Adam out of the dust appear to make it
[1:45:54] if he could not also reach down separate
[1:45:58] from Adam from the man to take another
[1:46:00] handful of the stomach Eve because it
[1:46:03] was never a separate game so he had to
[1:46:09] reach inside Adam first take part of
[1:46:13] that sim dust okay me Eve then reach
[1:46:20] back in Adam part of his spirit now God
[1:46:32] never got a handful of dust a minute Eve
[1:46:35] she did a different creation she's not a
[1:46:39] creation she's a by-product da da made a
[1:46:44] lot of sisters or women in the message
[1:46:47] mother who black father don't call me a
[1:46:50] byproduct I can do what every man can do
[1:46:55] well
[1:46:58] it's not a byproduct then let's go back
[1:47:01] to God
[1:47:01] let's ask him something was there a
[1:47:06] female being next to you because my
[1:47:09] Bible said you may have men in your
[1:47:10] image never said he made female remember
[1:47:15] men the world what we call men is not
[1:47:20] what we call Adam men became Adam Adam
[1:47:25] come from the earth thus okay so man was
[1:47:31] the creation so he never said a man
[1:47:34] spoke a man and spoke a woman never did
[1:47:39] so for him to do it he would have to
[1:47:41] have that image up there you gotta
[1:47:46] understand that to have to create that
[1:47:50] he would have to have an image so
[1:47:53] therefore you would have to reflect
[1:47:55] something since there was nothing to
[1:47:58] reflect you so he could only make you
[1:48:02] out of something else why because there
[1:48:06] was something in God that you wanted to
[1:48:08] take out okay so it's not an insult when
[1:48:16] the prophets say you are by product it's
[1:48:21] actually grace upon grace it's actually
[1:48:25] the best see I'm gonna tell you why it's
[1:48:30] actually the best thing turn again yeah
[1:48:32] I'm gonna get a little bit of man ahead
[1:48:34] of myself why because if Eve was created
[1:48:39] separately from Adam you could never be
[1:48:45] the same like Jesus
[1:48:48] you could never be the same again like
[1:48:52] Jesus you could never said to be like
[1:48:56] Jesus
[1:48:57] no because to be like Jesus means
[1:49:02] everything that was in Jesus everything
[1:49:04] that Jesus was you have to be but yet if
[1:49:08] you something
[1:49:08] separate you can't be it you can't so
[1:49:17] and you could never said you going back
[1:49:20] to God
[1:49:21] cuz you never came out of him so Eve
[1:49:25] could go back to Adam cause she came out
[1:49:28] of him so in order for her to say I'm
[1:49:30] going back to God then you would have to
[1:49:32] come out of him but if you were a
[1:49:33] separate creation how would you go back
[1:49:35] to someplace you were never you know so
[1:49:43] that's what it means going back to that
[1:49:44] means where you came from so meaning you
[1:49:46] came from God just like Eve came from
[1:49:49] Adam you came from God therefore you
[1:49:52] can't go back to him that's what it
[1:49:56] means and what about I'm saying they of
[1:49:59] perfect oneness perfect oneness can
[1:50:03] never be a separate thing from each
[1:50:06] other
[1:50:06] he came now now for when I'm said in
[1:50:11] drove a gyro 1961 March 12 1961 0-3 1261
[1:50:17] it said in spirit he was both feminine
[1:50:19] feminine and masculine in spirit so to
[1:50:24] make them one to show that he did he
[1:50:29] open up the side of Adam and took part
[1:50:31] of Adam's flesh so that they wouldn't be
[1:50:33] separate they would be one and two part
[1:50:38] of Adam spirit Moses wrote in the Bible
[1:50:43] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone right
[1:50:50] where in the Bible Moses ever said speed
[1:50:52] of my sphere
[1:50:55] no way but yet it took a prophet to go
[1:51:01] further than Moses so what about I'm had
[1:51:04] to reach further then Moses did Moses
[1:51:10] wasn't there when God was creating Adam
[1:51:13] right but yet he told you how they were
[1:51:16] created so if you can believe Moses word
[1:51:19] when he wasn't there
[1:51:22] tell me what button wasn't there how
[1:51:23] would you know I won't tell you I would
[1:51:25] believe what would you believe Moses
[1:51:26] please
[1:51:27] like a magic he was a man shot at mother
[1:51:29] Burnham so therefore something had to
[1:51:33] come to Moses and give him the things he
[1:51:35] brought so the same thing I've come to
[1:51:38] buy the mother may give him the things
[1:51:39] he said okay so but what I'm saying now
[1:51:42] Eve was Adams flesh bone and he's spirit
[1:51:49] so because of that Eve now listen
[1:51:57] by-product is not whenever I'm referring
[1:52:01] to you as a by-product is not referring
[1:52:02] to you in spirit
[1:52:05] did you understand because it's in the
[1:52:07] message but what I'm saying the
[1:52:09] byproduct is not the spirit the
[1:52:13] byproduct is the flesh it is so why the
[1:52:22] byproduct is not the Spirit because the
[1:52:23] spirit was a spoken word because the
[1:52:26] spin was a spoken word since you were in
[1:52:28] Adam so your spirit is not a byproduct
[1:52:35] it's the very same spirit that was
[1:52:39] poking out of God's mouth that was in
[1:52:41] Adam that made you are you here with me
[1:52:44] now there's a reason why I'm saying this
[1:52:48] so the flesh is the byproduct the bride
[1:52:53] is the same the bride is the same now
[1:53:04] let me read something for you reason why
[1:53:08] I'm reading these because before I say
[1:53:10] when I wanted to see let me read these
[1:53:12] marriage and divorce but when I'm seeing
[1:53:16] first Adam sorry
[1:53:21] so it's 0 2 21 1965 Mergent was dragged
[1:53:26] off two nights in recent now the first
[1:53:30] Adam and Eve
[1:53:33] type ii Adam and Eve so whatever that
[1:53:40] happen in the first Adam must happen in
[1:53:43] the second Adam right okay
[1:53:46] remember the first Adam at first was
[1:53:50] lonely so therefore the second Adam was
[1:53:54] lonely the first Adam was put to sleep
[1:53:57] to take the Eve out of him so the second
[1:54:00] Adam must people to see to take the
[1:54:03] second in out of him okay the first Adam
[1:54:07] was not created a spirit Mel and then a
[1:54:11] separate spirit female so it was one
[1:54:15] spirit that one spirit had a door person
[1:54:19] in it male and female
[1:54:21] so when gets pop Jesus into existence
[1:54:24] you were in him again we're talking
[1:54:32] about the bride which is you please
[1:54:37] understand this I'm talking about you I
[1:54:40] was failing to you Church when that's
[1:54:44] picado it wasn't him so when God spoke
[1:54:47] Christ you were in him so that separate
[1:54:53] Adam to give out he took part of his
[1:54:57] spirit it was no spirit from anywhere
[1:54:59] else it was the spirit of who Adam
[1:55:01] rather it means when God put Christ to
[1:55:07] sleep on the cross the Bible said blood
[1:55:11] and water came out of him but about him
[1:55:16] said that gave birth to the bride so
[1:55:23] potentially that's a body that was being
[1:55:28] formed now that body you would call you
[1:55:32] know it's many the byproduct but
[1:55:37] remember the spirit is not the back
[1:55:39] brother let God get the spirit to give
[1:55:44] Eve from Adam so when the bride was
[1:55:50] given birth on the cross so God could
[1:55:53] never take a spirit from anywhere else
[1:55:55] but in Christ so the Holy Spirit you
[1:56:00] have but a listener the Holy Spirit you
[1:56:07] have is that feminist spirit that made
[1:56:13] the bride I'm sorry I don't want to get
[1:56:16] too excited but but you see we're not
[1:56:21] the Holy Spirit is God right but do you
[1:56:24] know that's a lower version of God so
[1:56:31] therefore ever was a lower version of
[1:56:34] Adam the spirit that made F was nothing
[1:56:37] else but the spirit of Adam the spirit
[1:56:40] that made you was nothing else but the
[1:56:42] Spirit of Christ the spirit but when I'm
[1:56:45] said listen again it's not my words but
[1:56:48] when I'm whose words he said the first
[1:56:53] Adam to hide the second Adam so what
[1:56:57] does it mean anything that happened in
[1:57:00] the first Adam it's the same thing
[1:57:04] happen in the second Adam so Christ was
[1:57:07] created a third person the Holy Spirit
[1:57:11] you received is nothing else but that
[1:57:13] weaker part of God but yet because that
[1:57:21] spirit is none other than God that's why
[1:57:29] when brother bottom refers to you he
[1:57:32] said you are only putting so then why
[1:57:38] because the Spirit is one God so it's
[1:57:43] not really the same spirit like Adam
[1:57:48] spirit that made Eve
[1:57:50] because the spirit that came out of God
[1:57:53] can't be weak can't be you know
[1:58:02] worthless or helpless cuz whatever that
[1:58:08] came out of God is nothing else but God
[1:58:10] himself whether it's a little speck that
[1:58:15] came out of that great fountain is God
[1:58:18] when you go to the sea to the beach take
[1:58:21] a spoon take a spoonful of water when
[1:58:26] you take it out of the sea does that
[1:58:28] become something else then see what is
[1:58:31] that still see put in a spoon so adult
[1:58:37] God came out came the Holy Spirit so the
[1:58:39] Holy Spirit is not other but God himself
[1:58:43] now listen because the Holy Spirit is
[1:58:47] none other than God Himself makes you
[1:58:52] made you what God Himself then but it
[1:58:58] doesn't say listen when Adam went after
[1:59:02] if to save if he could not save if what
[1:59:04] he felt Eve right why because his spirit
[1:59:08] was made to form why because God put
[1:59:14] that spirit in the flesh
[1:59:15] so the okay becomes like subject to form
[1:59:20] because that the spirit didn't have a
[1:59:22] flesh it wouldn't never fall so because
[1:59:26] the spirit was subject to fall God put
[1:59:28] that in you know in a flash and then it
[1:59:30] fell so now
[1:59:32] God just like Adam in spirit could not
[1:59:35] come and die so he had to come down in
[1:59:40] flesh so just like he made Adam because
[1:59:45] he again I'm gonna tell you this when
[1:59:47] God was making the earth the heavens you
[1:59:51] know he wasn't taking about anything
[1:59:52] else but you
[1:59:53] he saw you just like I'm looking at you
[1:59:56] looking at me he saw you and he's hot
[1:59:59] already fell in love for you so
[2:00:01] therefore everything he was doing was
[2:00:03] doing
[2:00:03] for you so his heart was crazy and to
[2:00:08] have you today so he was lonely before
[2:00:12] he's not lonely anymore why because he
[2:00:15] has a wife he's longing to be with his
[2:00:18] wife in the Millennium so everything he
[2:00:24] was making he made them for you in his
[2:00:26] mind and that is why when you referring
[2:00:30] to the bride you're not referring to
[2:00:33] anything like to do something that's
[2:00:35] whatever and that's why you cannot pray
[2:00:37] for someone to be in the right cause God
[2:00:39] knew he is bright god no who is
[2:00:43] brightest so I cannot pray for no one
[2:00:48] here to be part of the bride you're
[2:00:51] gonna have to change your prayer if you
[2:00:52] were praying like that because you can't
[2:00:55] change God's mind you can pray God to
[2:00:58] save your children to save your husband
[2:00:59] you're a part of the bride there will be
[2:01:01] but God please I want my husband to be
[2:01:03] with me in the rupture who are you you
[2:01:07] ain't got that right to tell God that
[2:01:09] you want your husband to be in a rupture
[2:01:11] your wife but you can tell him to save
[2:01:15] them the rapture is only given to God
[2:01:19] God alone no one else that you know you
[2:01:22] are his bride it doesn't give it to you
[2:01:24] why because our young man my own sister
[2:01:28] just got married the young man that
[2:01:30] shows her there was a lot of other
[2:01:32] sisters here but he chose to be with her
[2:01:38] was it because she was praying so much
[2:01:43] to him no if he's her I didn't go to her
[2:01:46] he would marry her it's not the amount
[2:01:51] of failure but he had to love her she
[2:01:58] had to love him for them to be together
[2:02:03] God did not make a mistake choosing you
[2:02:05] he knew he would love him
[2:02:08] he knew he would remain faithful God
[2:02:13] would not
[2:02:13] make a bet on job hadn't known that job
[2:02:18] would forsake him but he knew and he
[2:02:24] said do what you got to do cuz he would
[2:02:27] never forsake me and you did his wife
[2:02:29] for sake but job Stood Still
[2:02:33] okay so God doesn't make a mistake about
[2:02:35] his bride so don't worry who's come and
[2:02:39] go don't worry about that that's God's
[2:02:42] business your business to make sure your
[2:02:45] soul is right with him okay so when God
[2:02:52] made Adam Eve was in him so when God
[2:02:58] made Christ you were in him so that is
[2:03:01] what about him said when he died on
[2:03:03] Calvary I died with him he walked on
[2:03:07] Galilee I worked with him he was
[2:03:11] sleeping on the board I was sleeping
[2:03:13] with him they spit on his face they spit
[2:03:16] on our face because we were in him so
[2:03:19] whatever that happened to him happened
[2:03:21] to you okay now when you consider
[2:03:30] yourself as a young lady that you are
[2:03:33] not going to be called by-product or you
[2:03:42] want to be recognized as equal to a man
[2:03:45] what do you think you gonna make the
[2:03:48] bribe look like the bride of Jesus
[2:03:51] Christ because you are the mirror image
[2:03:54] of the bride of the Lord so your action
[2:03:58] speaks of the bride because Adams
[2:04:01] actions speak of God the same thing Adam
[2:04:05] did God did Adam loved if so much he
[2:04:09] gave his life for Eve so Adam wasn't
[2:04:13] doing anything contrary to God so now
[2:04:16] you have to understand your behavior
[2:04:19] your action your thoughts on comparing
[2:04:24] to the bride's action
[2:04:26] behavior and thumbs so now the way you
[2:04:30] talked either be a slap in that face are
[2:04:35] you spinning in his face again
[2:04:39] so when you standing and say you know
[2:04:41] what you're gonna let yourself be invade
[2:04:43] that the speed of the world feminism
[2:04:46] so that's spinning in God's face so you
[2:04:51] don't have to stand for these things and
[2:04:56] it's not God that is not lowering you
[2:04:58] lower than nobody no but God wants you
[2:05:02] to understand that in you he had
[2:05:05] something in his mind that you wanted to
[2:05:07] bring up so he couldn't do it any other
[2:05:10] way but to put it in you so that's what
[2:05:14] I do but I've said you or when a woman
[2:05:16] knows her place she has a greater reward
[2:05:18] than a man it's in the message you have
[2:05:23] a greater reward than the men so you
[2:05:27] don't have to fight to be like a man to
[2:05:30] Akaka men from people to know that oh
[2:05:33] man I am NOT gonna let no man disrespect
[2:05:35] me you don't have to do that I'm I'm
[2:05:44] gonna remind you do you know that God
[2:05:46] are quicker for you than a man faster
[2:05:53] why because he's the one that said you a
[2:05:57] weaker vessel therefore he got to okay
[2:06:02] so he got to step up for you quicker
[2:06:05] faster than the men okay so now listen
[2:06:10] when the woman but when I talk about the
[2:06:13] woman in the message that her husband
[2:06:16] didn't want her to go to church so she
[2:06:20] her car key and he took the in
[2:06:23] rouen away so she won't do anything she
[2:06:27] did not leave her place
[2:06:29] oh you took my you boom I'm gonna
[2:06:33] show you
[2:06:36] you you don't know who you messing with
[2:06:39] and then they they're right under is
[2:06:41] where do you know you actually that's
[2:06:47] when you lower yourself down like you're
[2:06:50] degrading yourself when you're doing
[2:06:52] that because they're bringing you up oh
[2:06:55] oh you all know you messing with and
[2:07:01] they think you know they pissing himself
[2:07:08] you know no it's the great the degrading
[2:07:13] for a woman to add that way so she did
[2:07:17] not do that or you through Mike you away
[2:07:19] or gonna say I'm gonna burn your clothes
[2:07:26] so she didn't do that she let go
[2:07:30] reach up in the closet and take all the
[2:07:31] frozen dictum I am drama go to his going
[2:07:37] take a baseball bat enema
[2:07:39] she didn't do that or take a spray and
[2:07:43] spray up with a he's cold you take a
[2:07:46] good mess with me know so you don't have
[2:07:50] to do that what did she do you know what
[2:07:54] she did she said honey what would you
[2:07:56] like to eat today what would you like to
[2:08:02] eat today fish okay baby
[2:08:08] she went to the marketplace she never
[2:08:14] prayed for God to give her no keys back
[2:08:17] no she ever fought for it but she was
[2:08:21] being the women got met her so because
[2:08:27] she was doing that dad had to step up
[2:08:30] for her
[2:08:33] and yes he did because what happened so
[2:08:39] when she went in the water person to buy
[2:08:40] the fish please tell me if he cut a
[2:08:43] miracle a kid I was thrown but in the
[2:08:49] river or where they threw the key so he
[2:08:52] went by the fish you know preparing the
[2:08:57] fish cut it open where was that kid
[2:09:01] inside the fish why the only reason why
[2:09:08] she could she found the key was because
[2:09:10] she remained in her place so there's no
[2:09:15] reward for you out of your place that
[2:09:20] has no reason to ask for you when you
[2:09:23] taking the flight into your own hands
[2:09:27] that's what the Bible say if you want to
[2:09:30] win your husband stay quiet you can win
[2:09:34] him in silence you don't have to fight
[2:09:37] with you because God is the world with
[2:09:38] the big muscles okay he didn't make you
[2:09:43] to be a Brenda like a manner like a man
[2:09:45] go to the gym and lift up weights you
[2:09:47] don't make you for that so because he
[2:09:51] knows you can't live for weights like
[2:09:53] that then he's going to lift it up for
[2:09:54] you so if your husband is too much for
[2:09:57] you turn him over to God sister na you
[2:10:03] will have to fight your battles he said
[2:10:07] God you call me to be this way right no
[2:10:09] problem
[2:10:09] then you take over take over so she
[2:10:16] stayed in her place and God came through
[2:10:20] for her it's the same that you serve in
[2:10:24] today my young sisters listen you don't
[2:10:34] have to you know like going back and
[2:10:38] forth with a boy to make the boy respect
[2:10:41] you as a matter of fact he will never
[2:10:43] respect you
[2:10:46] going back and forth with him no let him
[2:10:51] talk you know so when God said you know
[2:11:00] the weaker vessel doesn't mean you have
[2:11:03] floor mat or you know he can do what a
[2:11:07] very pleased with you push you around no
[2:11:09] because I need you to remember this
[2:11:12] before you are any means you were God
[2:11:16] first so God will always come through
[2:11:21] for you always always come through for
[2:11:28] you so when the message called you a
[2:11:31] weaker vessel it's the same thing for
[2:11:34] the bride the bride is the weaker vessel
[2:11:39] so if you want to be like a man so you
[2:11:42] telling me the bride has to oh we want
[2:11:46] to be like that's not the same thing
[2:11:48] it's not the same thing you want to act
[2:11:51] like a man do everything a man can do
[2:11:53] that's not what we singing bill to be
[2:11:55] like that's not what it is it's not the
[2:12:00] same thing when it could be like Jesus
[2:12:02] not wanna be like a man like a man no
[2:12:04] because the Bible said Christ is the
[2:12:07] husband you the wife so Christ is the
[2:12:10] head you cannot beat her head to be like
[2:12:13] Jesus than me and you gotta be the head
[2:12:15] like Jesus doesn't know there's only one
[2:12:17] head and it's Jesus Christ so let me
[2:12:25] tell you this to finish God said if him
[2:12:27] created Eve a different creation in the
[2:12:30] invisible union of the bride he said if
[2:12:32] he created Eve a different creation it
[2:12:37] would have been this complementary to
[2:12:40] God's grace wisdom it would have been
[2:12:43] this complementary to God's great wisdom
[2:12:47] why but why do so meaning if we spoke
[2:12:54] about
[2:12:56] so it would have been stumped something
[2:12:59] wrong with the wisdom of God
[2:13:02] why because remember in the creating in
[2:13:06] the creation of man God was wasn't
[2:13:10] looking at nothing else but himself so
[2:13:13] because he was looking at himself he
[2:13:15] know what was in him that he wanted to
[2:13:18] display okay so he made the men like him
[2:13:23] so in that man he showed an image of
[2:13:27] what he was going to do later on so the
[2:13:32] bride today if you understand the
[2:13:35] creation of Adam and Eve you will
[2:13:37] understand your relationship with God
[2:13:40] and that is why what I wanna make sure
[2:13:44] that you understand that Jesus Christ is
[2:13:46] not a small God with a great God he's
[2:13:50] not a second in a Trinity of God because
[2:13:54] if it is like that something is wrong
[2:13:55] with the image okay so because Jesus is
[2:13:59] the God so therefore when you came out
[2:14:04] you did not come out in flesh from Jesus
[2:14:07] okay that's where we're trying to go so
[2:14:10] we can close we we did not come out in
[2:14:13] flesh that is why the Batwa said you
[2:14:16] must be born again because you are not
[2:14:20] supposed to be burned away you were born
[2:14:22] you are supposed to be spoken up okay
[2:14:26] so Jesus was spoken up so your flesh did
[2:14:30] that come out of Jesus okay but what
[2:14:33] came out of Jesus that made you was only
[2:14:36] his spirit that should call today the
[2:14:39] Holy Ghost you here with me now now the
[2:14:42] holy ghost is a spirit just like the
[2:14:47] spirit that came out of Adam which was
[2:14:50] if needed what a body
[2:14:52] so the Holy Ghost needed needed a body
[2:14:57] okay so now remember what about I've
[2:15:00] said God is powerless without a body
[2:15:03] when he's talking about God is referring
[2:15:06] to the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost can
[2:15:08] do
[2:15:08] without a body and the radicals was only
[2:15:12] given for the grandmother alone so the
[2:15:15] Holy Ghost was not given and when you go
[2:15:18] out there you seen the religion people
[2:15:19] on speaking in tone it's not really the
[2:15:22] Holy Ghost because when you referring to
[2:15:25] the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of God
[2:15:27] given to his bride and the bride alone
[2:15:30] the spirit of Adam was never in any
[2:15:33] other female body so this we love God
[2:15:35] can never be in any other trust but he's
[2:15:36] bright Jesus I also don't understand
[2:15:39] that now when you have the Holy Ghost
[2:15:41] what do you need for the Holy Ghost to
[2:15:44] be complete not this blood not this body
[2:15:47] not this flesh you need what a spoken
[2:15:51] word body are you here with me now you
[2:15:54] need what a spoken word body that is
[2:15:57] where everyone I've said the bride must
[2:15:59] be what does the spoken word
[2:16:03] just like Jesus Christ is what the
[2:16:05] spoken word
[2:16:07] so now don't look at your flesh because
[2:16:12] in your flesh you will miss the image
[2:16:15] and your spoken word body is coming
[2:16:19] because red lights being formed how in
[2:16:24] three stages first this flesh second the
[2:16:30] oh honey third what glorified body
[2:16:35] that's when you have the complete word
[2:16:39] so when you say you wanna see Jesus like
[2:16:42] he is you cannot see him in his body
[2:16:44] and that's what about the Bible says you
[2:16:47] will be like him this is not like Jesus
[2:16:51] so to be like him to become like him so
[2:16:56] you would have to have the same body
[2:16:58] Jesus huh Jesus had a glorified body he
[2:17:03] still does and the body Jesus was
[2:17:06] created in was not a body made through
[2:17:09] sex it was spoken up you know you were
[2:17:14] never spoken up I'm gonna tell you this
[2:17:18] you know there was only one soul mate
[2:17:22] and then after that one soul mate
[2:17:23] there's only another swear there was
[2:17:25] only two people that can really tell
[2:17:27] they also met so in English I hear
[2:17:29] people say that a lot when they married
[2:17:31] someone or they have boyfriend and
[2:17:33] girlfriend or whatever oh that's my soul
[2:17:35] mate no no no no and no so me okay when
[2:17:42] you referring to soul mate
[2:17:43] I'm gonna explain to you this Adam and
[2:17:46] Eve could refurb as so big why because
[2:17:51] the spirit the very spirit that was the
[2:17:54] Adam was truly made Eve he made Eve
[2:17:58] truly made Eve so after that after the
[2:18:02] fall no man or woman good wasn't it the
[2:18:06] same way so you can never call yourself
[2:18:08] so mean so the second person that can
[2:18:12] call themselves so many's Christ and the
[2:18:14] right why because the Spirit of God is
[2:18:17] in the right so after in between there's
[2:18:22] no soul mate and that is why the Bible
[2:18:26] say who can be in the bed one goal once
[2:18:29] day so if you saw me you both gotta go
[2:18:33] because you are so met with Christ
[2:18:36] that's why you can't go to the rapture
[2:18:40] that's right so Adam could never let Eve
[2:18:44] die by herself
[2:18:46] why because they were so me if Adam let
[2:18:51] Eve went to Hell by herself
[2:18:54] Adam would have never ever been able to
[2:18:58] have another you cuz what would God I
[2:19:01] had to do god I gotta already taken to
[2:19:04] the spirit of Eve out of Adam so there
[2:19:07] was nothing else left
[2:19:08] so where did well with that so he would
[2:19:10] have to create and Eve so he was he he
[2:19:14] couldn't do it he couldn't do it so the
[2:19:19] same for you the spirit in you is God
[2:19:25] and because the Spirit is God it makes
[2:19:28] you none other than God also cause in
[2:19:32] the Bible when you call Adam
[2:19:35] didn't one didn't come you know how many
[2:19:38] people came to people because when you
[2:19:41] call Adam Eve did not name was not named
[2:19:44] Eve
[2:19:45] her name was Adam and that is why what
[2:19:48] about aunt called you today what Jesus
[2:19:52] is Jesus Christ so you see the same
[2:19:55] thing is happening with you but we have
[2:20:01] to stay in our place to close this is
[2:20:07] what I'm gonna tell you
[2:20:08] church barb Adam says the Alpha and the
[2:20:16] Omega okay
[2:20:19] the Alpha is the first one right Omega
[2:20:24] is the last right
[2:20:26] so in between Alpha and Omega
[2:20:30] you know there is nothing god is not
[2:20:32] alpha through Omega okay so meaning is
[2:20:36] not nothing in the middle
[2:20:39] so he's the beginning right
[2:20:42] he's the end right he also called you
[2:20:46] what the same thing Alpha and Omega okay
[2:20:52] in between the Baptist the Methodist so
[2:20:56] did not part of the bride alright so why
[2:21:01] are you the Alpha the Omega because the
[2:21:06] Omega was none other than the same Alpha
[2:21:10] that came back around so the bride is
[2:21:15] none other then Jesus Christ came back
[2:21:20] in a body of people are you here with me
[2:21:24] so if it is Jesus Christ that came back
[2:21:28] in a body of people what do you think is
[2:21:30] going to happen what do you think is
[2:21:35] going to happen so one day but about I'm
[2:21:41] say when they look at you they will know
[2:21:44] Jesus Christ
[2:21:47] was here but will they see Jesus will
[2:21:52] they see him walking like it was working
[2:21:54] on Galilee but how they will see him
[2:21:56] through you through you so the woman
[2:22:02] became the main at the end but in one
[2:22:08] way by his spirit she didn't fight for

[2:25:50] brother Reginald god bless you we
[2:25:52] certainly do appreciate that message
[2:25:55] amen
[2:25:58] man we all need an understanding whether
[2:26:01] it's male or female when a brother
[2:26:03] recognize is truly what that sister
[2:26:06] means to him he'll know how to treat her
[2:26:10] right amen
[2:26:12] I don't have to force my wife to do
[2:26:15] anything if I love her right she'll do
[2:26:17] it all it takes is love and
[2:26:21] understanding like our brothers saying
[2:26:23] you know I was the whole time he was
[2:26:26] preaching all I could see was redemption
[2:26:28] story you know he'd been a part of Adam
[2:26:32] we were talking about in Sunday school
[2:26:34] one so when Eve had fallen again she
[2:26:38] wasn't Eve at that time she was at him
[2:26:40] but when she fell she came back to Adam
[2:26:42] Adam was still standing there in
[2:26:44] eternity and Eve was already in time
[2:26:49] when she approached him Adam was in
[2:26:52] eternity she was in a fallen condition
[2:26:54] in time and God was going to take her
[2:26:57] life but Adam had to move over and
[2:27:01] inject some of himself into her so God
[2:27:05] could not take her and that's the same
[2:27:08] thing our Lord did we were in a fallen
[2:27:10] condition Jesus stepped out of time to
[2:27:13] become our sin like Adam did for me and
[2:27:16] all I could see was Redemption as she
[2:27:18] was preaching brother amen when a man
[2:27:21] takes a woman like brother Steven took
[2:27:23] sister Rachel at the end of the ceremony
[2:27:25] I now present to you mr. and mrs.
[2:27:28] Funderburk
[2:27:30] they became one again that was
[2:27:32] redemption he redeemed what was already
[2:27:34] his that woman that was taken from his
[2:27:37] side he redeemed her back that's what a
[2:27:40] wedding ceremony is all all I could see
[2:27:42] was redemption he did so much for us he
[2:27:45] did so much let's stand together let's
[2:27:48] sing this little song together and bow
[2:27:50] down and worship Him
[2:27:51] his brother-in-law was speaking earlier
[2:27:54] song came to my mind as he was talking
[2:27:56] about the brother at the foot of that
