come administer your word on to us to God and I pray the Lord as your prophet would once say the lord meet my lips to learn from saying anything contrary to your word that God may you bless us now the Lord for we're on the expectation that you speak to our hearts and the bride says a man a man God bless you saying she certainly good to be in the house of the Lord turn with me the second Samuel chapter 23 jump right into the word second Samuel chapter 23 verse 8 then we'll reverse a through 17 say man if you did all right these be the names of the mighty man whom David had the the Tecla night that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adeno the as night he lifts up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time and after him was Eliezer the son of dodo delhi one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the man of Israel were gone away he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was very and his hand Cleveland to the sword and the Lord brought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil and after I'm a Shama the son of a gay the horite and the Philistines were gathered together into a truth where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines in the Lord Radha great victory and our concentration is on a common verse at verse 13 through 17 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to David in the harvest time and to the to the cave of Adela and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of recommen and David was then in a hold in the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem and David long and said all that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines and drew order out of that well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord and he said be it far from me O Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of the man that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men a man made the Lord had his blessing so reading of the word you may be seated I'm not one for titles but if I was to give this one I'd like to title it David's thirst you're just about with me been a little bit under the weather but you know we're not gonna let the devil stop me from preaching the Word of God hey man so I'm just kind of a little thought here looking at David's thirst and I'll uh I like the story of david's mighty men because it talks about their bravery it talks about their their commitment their it talks about a lawyer there were two David and you know no matter how you know things were good sometimes and things were challenging sometimes but they remained faithful to David and you know these were not you know these were not your elite they were not your cream of the crop if you whoa the Bible talks about how in 1 Samuel 23 says in David therefore departed thence in the skate to the cave a Dunham and when his brethren in all his father's house heard it they were they went down thither to him and every one that is in distress and every one that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became captain over them and there were with them 400 men so David didn't want any trouble in the kingdom so he parted ways with Saul and he found himself in the cave adela and in order to maintain peace you know that's where he was at and so his you know some men joined up with David and the Bible talks about how that these were men that were distressed these were man that were discontented and these were man that were in debt so they brought baggage they carry the load with them and my the burden must have been so heavy on them but David didn't discriminate he didn't discount he didn't discredit he welcomed those men he invited those men and he accepted those men for what they for what they were and what they brought to the table and they they joined up with David and you know they went through quite a bit of a journey and the thing about you know life and itself is that the journey you know you go through testing periods you go through trials and it's the time to make you that much stronger all of us I presume carry wound the scars of life's journey and the fact that you still heal that the fact that you still here this morning is only an indication that you're bigger than that that try to kill you because you know we have these trials we have these testings we have these obstacles that are put in front of us and it just makes us that much stronger it makes you as an individual stronger and make sure your family's stronger it makes your marriage stronger every aspect of your life is tested because god has confidence in you and when you don't have confidence in your stuff God has confidence in you but when you don't think you're gonna make it God already sees you on the other side when you say that you're defeated guys that you're victorious you know we have to look we'll have to look at ourselves the way God looks at us and and and I welcome these trials because you know it's no different in a child that's born into an unknown world they have to be exposed to the elements so that way they could build an immune system to withstand the the trials of life so when diseases come up upon the child that their immune system is is as such that it's strong to withstand those trials it could overcome those diseases and then so when that same disease tries to come back later on in life that that child's body has built an immune system that could resist those diseases and essentially debod the body is telling those diseases you gotta come better than this I've already went through this trial I've overcome this and that's the same thing that God has exposed to you and I we've been through some battles we've been through some trials we've been through some circumstances and so when the devil tries the same tactic that he did before it cannot work because it didn't work before it's not gonna work now he has to come better than that he has to come stronger than that and every time that God overcomes in your life you become stronger in the trials that Saint has put in you God is building these immune system to make you withstand the trials that you encounter in life so when the devil tries to the same tactic you could look the devil in the eye says you gotta come better than that I overcame that trial years ago you gotta come better than that and don't be dismayed when the devil knocks you down on your feet you get yourself right back up just take that dust out and you keep on marching and you let the devil know you didn't stop me then you're not gonna stop me now sure life's a journey it's a trial but God doesn't put more on you than what you're capable of doing and God is watching your journey the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of God and you know I think about this is David in his latter years and right before he cross over he's reflecting on these men and how that these men stood with David they were they went through thick and thin there were high moments there were low moments and God was with them every step of the way it was even at one point where David's men they they came back and the the Amalekites came and took the families of David and his men they came from they were I believe two Gilgal and the families were taken their men the mela kites took the women took the children and David in this man they were returning back from from battle I could see in the distance the the the cloud the smoke billowing in the village perhaps that they were in and they knew that something was wrong and so they arrived at the scene and there was in total chaos disarray family is at disarray and and in the women was taken the children and my those men the rage that built within them and the Bible says how that they grabbed a stone and then we're getting ready to stone David man can you just imagine they've been so loyal to him up unto this point but this time it was really personal cuz the wives were taking their children was taken to their home was ravaged and and everything was damaged and so they took stones the Bible says and then we're getting ready to stone David after so many things have gone through but this was kind of the tipping point and David you know that's that's that's what it means what it means to be a leader is not to be not to be moved by just emotions you gotta be steady when things aren't always perfect you gotta have such a foundation you know where you stand that when you're dealing with adversity when you're dealing with confusion you gotta know where you stand with God that is so important when you're the head of your family the head of a church a world if you're playing society you gotta know where you stand what your position is because if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything and people watch your emotions your family's lunch emotions with things like an out of date they're chaotic but when you hold a steady hand and you're firm and what God has told has given to you no matter all the panic around you you know where you stand with God and these men that came with their stones and David could have shows a bit of reaction but David was steady his only response was man I need to go pray about this that's probably the least that they wanted to hear from David it's pretty obvious what they needed to do they're they're wise were taking the family was taken we just need to get our sword and let's go after the enemy that came in and swept through it caused chaos in the home but they was like no before we take any action no matter how justifiable it looks I need to go seek God and prayer yesterday's victory doesn't it doesn't guarantee today's victory I think God for the victories yesterday but I gotta get up in the morning and put my stuff on my knees and say Lord in order for me to have a repeat of yesterday I need to have you in my life today so David he didn't take God for granted he didn't just assume that it was the right thing to do he needed confirmation so he consulted the Urim and Thummim he consulted the priests and God says go up go after the Amalekites and I will restore unto you everything that was taken the difference between that action and what David then the action that David could have taken if he didn't pray was that David would have went up there presuming he would have went up there within his own justification by his all means of righteousness that would have that would have been his only difference and there's nothing guaranteed with that but-but-but-but-but retrospect Lee David begins to pray he consults God he has an answer from God and so he now knows that he's going up there victorious so it doesn't matter what others have to say he's confirmed it with God it's one thing for you to do something because it looks like it's the right thing to do it's an when you know God spoke to your hearts people may criticize your decision but God spoke to your heart people may criticize your actions but God spoke to your heart people may criticize the way you approach it but God spoke sweetheart if God speaks to my heart I don't know man no explanation because my actions is dictated by God my thoughts is dictated by God my decision is confirmed by the word and I'm obligated to one source and that's God alone and that's the reason why in my natural walk when I come back and I consult the Word of God you may not see it from my perspective but I know that God has convinced me in my heart and the Bible says all things work together for the good to them that I call on God because as long as I stay true to that word he'll come around God will show you the reason for my actions and there's just there's just a piece that overwhelms an individual when he knows that he's in the order of God he's under the inspiration of the Almighty and so therefore he's no longer acting out of whim he's not acting out of I hope so he's not acting out of maybe but he's got in the shirt yes he's gotten certainty but everything else is being certain of God are you certain of God or is he just as being that we come in we we fantasy him and we we worship Him in hopes that you know that this this being that we call God to connect with us lose a sense it's much more than a fantasy it's the reality of what I believe let me tell you I have sacrificed you have sacrificed a lot in your life I am NOT treating this Bible as a fairy tale Mauro's my soul rest the promises of God's words don't waste your time claim church if you ain't serious about this but I believe everything that's printed in this book and so David brought a victory and in the latter years David begins to reflect on the men that stood with him and he begins to recount some of these men because in the beginning chapter the Bible of that chapter I read the Bible says that God these were the last words of David the son of Jesse and he begins to talk about these men and just to kind of highlight some of these things you know the name of he begins to talk about the the names of the mighty man of David the tech my knight that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was the Dino there's night he lifted up his spear eight hundred whom he slew at one time you know these men they were subject to the same anointing that David was they were they were they didn't catch his spirit they won't they won't twist you know twisting like they David twisted or twitch but they had the same anointing and I'm gonna explain what that means a little bit but these men they they saw how God delivered David in his life and how he walked a great things in how he was a strategist and how he was a a warrior and how he approached God and these men became subject they were they were anointed with the same spirit that David was and and we know that David is a type so so the same as these man that followed David saw you as disciples of Jesus Christ you're anointed with the same spirit that Christ had that that's the reason you act the way you do that's the reason why God has empowered you for certain tasks in your life and so the Bible talks about how one of them which stood 800 and it was one against 800 and that's the way God has always played it in the scripture is that his people was always the ones that were at odds it didn't always look favorable to them and but God that's what God comes along and that's what he demonstrated his grace because he didn't want you to think you could do it I want you to catch it he doesn't want you to think that you have the ability to do it yourself the biggest opportunity that all of us have is to remove the element of human ability and let God work in your life you might say brother Gina I'm a young student and I mean I'm in school and I need this I need to pass my grades I need to pass my tests take up the human ability and let God begin to come into your life and he begins to bring things into your remembrance when you're sitting there at the day of taking the test and you're able to find the answers that you thought you didn't know you knew you might say brother gene I'm looking for a job and I gotta have this interview I want to be able to say correctly if you pick out the human element and you let God into your life the Bible says he will be you will be brought before magistrates and you'll know exactly what to say it's not yours it's God's words in your lips you gotta take out the human element with same Seamster those are not savable when the probability doesn't look in your favor let me tell you well people that define all probability we defy all odds when they say it's not possible God looks at you say you are impossible I don't speak the devil's language when the devil says you can't do it I stood by God's grace I am more than able when the devil says you're not gonna make it I said by God's place I am gonna make it every time the devil tells you something you're gonna come and believe that it's the opposite of what the devil's out you won against 800 I've been in that situation several times work that the enemy in the land seem like Giants sometimes the task is a tall order and you don't know how you're gonna get through the day you don't know how you're gonna get through the week you don't know how you're gonna get through the conversations you don't know how you're gonna get through the bills in the mail I've been there and they seem like to keep piling on and they don't be the screen a date they're nice and bright so that way when you pulled out your mobile everybody sees that you got a late notice lime green or pink and I try to hang it with the rest of the envelopes without where people don't see me put my business all out there I'm gonna pay you when I'm but it lady sits there in the kitchen table and every day you're reminded of the trials of life you're burdened by things and then next thing you know you got to work overtime in order to try to you know just try to keep up with the payments and the devil knows he's doing that to you so that we need to warp I miss the service today if I miss the service tomorrow we gotta rise above the tactics that the devil if we give glory to God because he's the awesome power of the universe he could take care of any possible bill that sits on the kitchen table he's greater than any doctor that could diagnose you with the false diagnosis we defy odds we're not we're not a statistic I'm above a statistic they say statistically this will happen one time you reached a certain age or sister and race was this certain Gina Gina Thurston family we rise the bluff statistics we have to come to the point that we believe that your your chosen people a peculiar people think about that I want you to I want that to kind of meditate a little bit 7 billion people on planet Earth and God says I have chosen you if you were to count from 1/2 million just one - it will take you 11 days just to get to a million to count from 1 to billion they'll take you I think 30 to 34 years the point I'm bringing is 7 billion is a lot and yet God bypass Palaces bypass White House bypass mentions cathedrals and came to this little corner Church and decide to have his resting place here he decides to come and have Church with you he decide to come the Bible says that the Bible says that God inhabits the praises of his people they might make a lot of noise but I want God inside this house and we said praise the Lord the Bible also talks about Elly's or the son of though to the L high one of the three mighty men when they defy the full scenes that one was there with them gathers together and the man of Israel gone away he arose and smote the Philistines with his hand until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword I don't know about you but sometimes I get tired a little bit sometimes I feel like a Christian sometimes maybe you're just there but for me it's still a battle sometimes there are Saints in the scripture that gets weary they get tired every day is a constant fight every day it's a back from the moment you get up saying this out the door just wait to test you from the morning traffic that you have to deal with when you're running late for work and you trying to be a patient as you care you come behind the slowest driver people cut in front of you and every line is red that devil is trying you and you try your best you put on a CD and you start singing some song but it's just not resonating does it so it's a fight you get to work and your boss says why are you late I see that you're late well you realize you're late soup with the mean the fact that you bring it to my assistant doesn't help me any better are you gonna have this report done by such-and-such time are you gonna be able to get this done by such as that's fine I need you to work overtime and it happens to be a special service week can we step raise the Lord and you were through the day you overwhelm us work you barely get a grab to eat and right before you get ready to head out your boss want to come in or your peer or someone wants to come in say hey can I have a conversation with you you have me for the entire day since eight o'clock this morning since nine o'clock if I was late since nine o'clock this morning you saw me we had coffee together you came to my office or my cubicle and you talked a little bit not one time did you bring up that issue and here it is right before I leave to go to the church you want to have a conversation about something let's do tomorrow that devil knows how to get ahold of you every day it's a fight then you gotta pick up the children from school then you gotta make sure that the family's taken care of with food on the table and so many obligations you gotta run to the grocery store you gotta do this you gotta do that you get unexpected phone call and this and that and you get so tired in your body you get so tired in your spirit but I think God then I got has built you to be more resilient than that then you can endure any challenges that comes across your way that with any negative thought that you would rather quit you say Lord I'm gonna hold on to this word because there's no other gospel that I could turn to you hold on no matter what happens you press on no matter what challenges you face you remain resilient the boss says I pressed towards the mark of the prize of the high calling it suppressing the violence is the kingdom of God comes by force and the violence taking it by force it's a fight but you remain resilient you remain committed and then when you get slapped up throughout the week you don't give up when you trip you don't give up you don't let the devil sow seeds of thought since she had by saying well a true Christian wouldn't do that a true Christian wouldn't say that you tell the devil you know what you're right I apologize let me go repent about that you take what the devil tell you switch it around you know you ain't supposed to do that you're never gonna make that right I appreciate you telling me that that was not his intentions but you caught him by surprise you gotta let the devil know that you're God's side and no matter how tired you get you when that church doors open let me tell you things you might be late I've been in that position before I'm weaving in and out of traffic I'm trying to get him because I want to be an example I may be late but thank God I'm here I made it to church I may just get a morsel of bread I got something that fed my soul I got something that's gonna nourish me I got something that's gonna encourage me for the battle we ought to be a group of people that every time we get up the devil doesn't know what to do with you he starts scratching his head he just doesn't know what to do with you praise the Lord and after I'm with Shama and then the Bible talks about how there was a piece of wood there was a piece of ground where the Philistines will come and and and and in the truth were there and they and the people of what would would flee but one day he said enough is enough and he stood his ground in the midst of the ground and he defended it is out to be your attitude where you say you know what enough s'en up and you hold your ground and you say you know what this day it's not a New Year's resolution resolution Saul my today you say I'm gonna make a difference I'm gonna faint differently I'm gonna act differently I'm gonna behave differently I'm gonna be an exemple if this is any truth to it and I wanna pour my soul into it and I want to be an example today I'm gonna be different today I'm gonna hold stand my ground and it's making more than just a declaration but make it action and the servant got tired of the Philistines year every year coming to take the land faces nine you've taken my family too much you've tortured them you've tortured my you you've tortured my my marriage you've tortured the church you've tortured no no more I'm gonna hold my ground stood his ground you stand with the word the word will stand with you you go visit the doctor the doctor tells you said something that just doesn't seem right you hold you guys that you know what today I'm gonna stick my ground I'm gonna believe what God says he's the great physician that could be touched by the feelings of my infirmities hold your ground and then the Bible talks about these three men these men were the Bible says that the three of the 33 of the thirty-eighth went down and came to David 3 out of 30 is 10% and God says in his word the tenth is holy unto me so these were holy men a type of the bride and it came to David in the harvest time in the cave of Adela now these were men that you know they weren't move by the dwelling place of where David was that because wherever the king is that that's where I want to be so then go to some great monastery some great cathedral some great church but they came into a cave and these men were not embarrassed so when people ask me where do you go to church I was telling my church where do you go to church is it that one big church over that like no is it that big treasure I'm like no it's like it's about a hundred of us in a little plaza area it's a really small church but made the fire of God falls in that church I'm not embarrassed I'm not ashamed to tell them when I go to church and what I believe in like I never heard of it I'm like I know I know a lot of people don't have a heard of the true teachings of Jesus Christ soon and the door opens up for me to begin to have a conversation so these men were not embarrassing either they were not afraid to culture the cave or dalam cuz that's what David was that and so as they pulled in the Bible talked about how David was in a hold of the garret and David was then in a hold in the garret and the garrison of the full scenes was been in Bethlehem and there was baby began to remark a little bit not what you follow this dog but Ram says this he says in the man that could turn the light David himself being born in the city he had to come to this little spot and it was called Bethlehem which means the house of God spread and he is the house of God's bride and David laying there on the hill that day he looked down and seeing the Philistines garrison around like that must have gone hot and thirsty and he said oh if I could just have a drink from that well once more and he says why the least of his thoughts was a command to them who loved him so David there was watching and in the distance he saw how the Philistines had gathered themselves around the city Bethlehem and he only just you know breathe a certain a word or phrase oh if I could drink from the well of Bethlehem keep in mind it was not a commandment he was given but it was just portraying his desire of what he wanted and so these men overheard David as looked into the distance and saw how that the Philistines were surrounding themselves surrounding themselves around the well and they overheard David and they were moved with compassion to fulfill David's desire so sometimes it's not a commandment but just fulfilling God's desire are we staying together sometimes it's just knowing what God expects of you and not a commandment don't don't treat this book don't treat the message as rules and regulations you're not bonded by this message you're not no you're not you're not you know against your will we're I have to do this I can't do that that's not how you should live your life you're going to be miserable if that's how you feel because every interaction with someone want I can't do this because my belief tells me to I can't go here and I can't say this and I can't wear that don't blame the message for how your personal life may be because you haven't been fully converted a little sister there but the moment you have a true born-again experience it transcends beyond the do's and don'ts you do not do things because you don't want to do it because you want to please God your love for God is far greater than anything that you could ever imagine so you don't do these things because of that you're true to your marriage because of the love that binds it's the same exact principle with God not do's and don'ts people say well I can't do this because imagine the message doesn't let me do it don't don't blame the message because then if there's that if there's that worldly desire a part of you still needs to die because there's some craving there but we live so freely well you could go because one says all things are expedient all things are lawful but not all things are expedient all things are lawful he says it's lawful for him to drink if he wanted to it's lawful for him to drink to smoke if you wanted to it's lawful for him to do all these things but it's not expedient as a Christian so we walk a different walk we talk a different talk we dress a different dress where we behave differently we act differently we think differently we interact differently we engage differently why because no one very few people my read the Bible but hundreds of people are reading your life the only thing that demo by Corinthians is how you interpret Corinthians through your life the only way there was nobody fishes is how you interpret interpret Ephesians through your life brother man says this he says the devil is not concerned about you believing this Bible the devil is not concerned about your reciting the Bible the devil's not concerned about you reading the message but the devil is concerned when you live the Bible it's one thing that you could quote all sixty-six page of the Bible but act like a devil when you're out there in the world let me tell you say stolen by any higher hey man go sing in the ire don't praise any higher than the ability for you to live this word cuz you might fool my brother you might fool my sister but you cannot fool God and we have trials in our life like I was saying before and use everybody now got no tries you gotta take take know whose side you're on because the devil don't got no time if you already out there acting like he is you're like brothers you not got no words well that's because you're on the wrong side but the moment you start living right the moment you start acting right the moment you start looking right the devil's don't point every gun and he'll towards you these are blood jeans I've been having trials I've been having problems I've been having smokin stands where you can set praise be to God at least you on the fighting winning side every time the Devils will try to take a smile away from you he's gonna try to take a joy away from you he's gonna try to take victory away from you because you know all those are promises that God has given unto you so these men they knew the desire of David they knew David's desire and they came together and perhaps they looked at the circumstance this this was not something they've done on the whim the three of them probably got together and just say they're looking at David that's there at the opening of the cave and just probably leaning against the side of the cave and reflecting as he looked into the distance and these men are just collecting their thoughts and saying one to another it's like our king he wants a fresh sip of water from the well and Bethlehem and so they began to take inventory and they looked at one another in the eyes and say who's with me because the Bible says upon the witnesses of two or three is the word established and they looked at one another says are you in are you in and they each drew out their sword they knew it was gonna be a battle because brother man says it was 14 miles from where they're at to the well and then we're gonna fight the enemy for fourteen miles 14 miles and no doubt that came together in the beginning the kind of perhaps maybe put a strategy together maybe the reason why it was threes is because there were in the shape of a pyramid where one could watch each other's back and they begins to make that journey they didn't tell David probably anything they just decided to fulfill David's desires and to kind of play on this a little bit relevance and so it is today the lease of Jesus thought so how about his word should be a command to we Gentiles who love Him for we know he's coming into power no matter how much he's rejected heavens and earth will pass away but this will still reign just the same when all heavens and earth is gone and we know he's coming into power because nothing will keep it from happening this is Christ a revelation of him and this is going to happen just the way the word says it it is because he's the word and the least of this commandment no matter how little it is if it's to be rebaptised or whatever it is we'll do it anyhow it's his command and the least of David's thoughts was a command to those Gentiles for a type of the Gentile church today Galion men those men stood by David were Gentiles but God but gallant man they were fearless they didn't know what fear was there were such under an anointing from David that when David faced Goliath and a host of army withdrew themselves and they were trying that they were puzzled trying to figure out how do we attack this this this discord regarding of a man called called called Goliath what are we going to do David comes along as I was wrong with you people he exhibited zero fear and they asked him well why you like that and this response was you know he says look I'm just a shepherd boy but I'll tell you one thing I watched my sheep real good and when the lion came in touch one of my sheep I ran after that line I wasn't scared and when the bear calm came to try to take one of my sheep I ran after that bear and I killed that bear I have no fear and thank God he's no different that devil is no different than the devil that's trying to bring you down before so David was fearless and when Goliath started charging towards David remember when Satan charges it's an intimidation tactic he intentionally throws things at you because he expects you to run he expects you to pack up your bags and go but that but the devil doesn't expect when you start running towards him - because I'm sore Goliath was charging really fast [Music] well he had he has probably some pick up speed him and they was like well he think I'm gonna run so he picked up his sling David started running right towards Goliath let me say I'm sure Goliath fight it's a slow walk a little bit you gotta catch the devil by surprise you gotta let the devil know like greater is he that is with you then he that is in the world David charged right towards life not one ounce of fear inhabited him because he knew what God had instilled within him Goliath was probably running at 80 miles an hour than the top - 70 60 50 40 30 and when David let that walk flew he was running at 20 that was a proper the last thing you remember David was fearless when the lies was laying there flat they were like I ain't done with this he picked up Goliath sword never know how to wield it before he's like if God started the job God's gonna finish the job I gotta make sure that that demon is dead just in case that prayer didn't do it I'm gonna add a little bit fasting to it so he pulled out that sword this one must have been heavy but David knew that he had to finish the job the Bible says he that I've begun a good work in you will finish it they probably went back this way and he came flat down blood splattered everywhere cuz there's a this you gotta get dirty you're in a battle you're not gonna look girl you're not always gonna look there Sunday's best let me tell you when I go through the week and find it comes around I don't look like I don't look like something's best I've been through a battle I love my Fridays David picked up the head he is sure he showed it to two groups of people he showed it to the Philistines this is what my God did to your man then he showed it to Israel this is what your God did to your enemy the Bible says that Jesus has triumphant has made openly of public sustaining his enemy and his enemies he has overcome these things for you and I made a show of them openly so David's men they were anointed with David David's anointing and they begin to make that journey now think about this here you had it the Philistines you know going back to the element of surprise the Philistines will probably just sitting there you know just you know very careless learn about their daily duties because you know who's gonna really attack them and so in the distance from one of them keeping guard and in the distance they saw kinda like a little dust just kind of flying up and this all silhouette of some what appears to be a couple of people so one guy Bobby looked real good didn't know how to react to it right because you've never been unexpected attack so he's probably looking real good he probably is the only one noticing it then he looks like hey Bob do you see that - Chris y'all see that and those men they were running at top speed they charge your choice the camp and they're looking how many do you think there is I don't know I made maybe 300 maybe 400 500 maybe don't look that many to me and those men were running and that silhouette becomes a little bit clearer and clearer and clearer and these men they're just watching it like well one two three one two how many did you count Bob cuz the devil don't expect you when is when the devil doesn't expect you to come to church but here in your car you're coming to church the devil doesn't expect you to get on your knees and pray but here you are just piling down people when the devil doesn't expect it that's when you gotta do it when you least expect it and the watching from a distance if they don't know whether I pull out the sword of what well it's only there's only three of them so we show you think we should report it then well let's call a couple more guys's that's we could easily stop this these three men were chased no coming straight towards them they weren't deviating a little cutting then what coming straight towards the promise and I can only imagine that their focus was only for that promise and was was what was repeating in their mind was what David said oh if I could have a drink from Bethlehem oh if I could have a sip of water from Bethlehem and those men were charging and next thing you know those guys pull out the sword did they don't know what to do they've never seen this before this like this is crazy I mean these guys don't have their hair together you gotta catch the devil by surprise and next thing you know they come running right through the garrison they probably take one guy out that least expected it didn't take out a sword fast enough and they start penetrating their way through 14 miles of Philistines and they're probably spinning around watching each other's back supporting each other and if one of them goes down the other two are there to pick them up because they're in the battle together they came in it together they could have come out of it together so they fought the way they fought the way and here they are they're spinning around it's probably chaos that's what the Bible talks about that don't look at the Battle of the Warriors with much blood and confusion that's what the Bible says in Isaiah and so they're spinning around and the fighting in blood ends is mingled and in this man it's a mess but their only purpose is to get to that well and they're watching each other's back these gallant men and the only thing that they could think of in the middle of the battle is a verse a scripture that saying of their King I don't know when a conversation I'll go well with my boss and I I got to think of a verse I need a scripture I started hemming a song yeah but I know that every conversation goes well in the job but I need something to sustain me something to say your son of God you're big you're bigger than the conversation that you just had when people look at you funny when people say they might say something like it's the tone that they say it they know the devil knows how to get under your skin remember when when when when when Pharaoh went after Israel the Bible says he appointed shariats to go after them so there were demons that were appointed to go after certain group of people the devil knows exactly your weakness each of you still say Amen but we're gonna get to it each of you have your own secret demons that you fight your wife don't know your husband don't know your children don't know the parents don't know now by getting quiet I still say that all of us have some demons you might as well ask why I'm not quick to criticize a brother how come he can't overcome this meanwhile you got a telephone pole in your eyes how come she won't overcome that you got at your battles that you got a war through did we say praise the Lord we each have own demons that pic that keeps taunting us Paul had that he says he it was a it was the way I phrase I mean I praise the great it was the thing that always professed him it was a weakness that he had and he had to consult God constantly for it that's the reason why we need to pray one for the other encourage one another uplift one another edify one another and if you can't say nothing at all then be quiet and just spray can we say praise the Lord so these three men I Miguel for that a little bit so these three men they were warring their way through the garrison of the Philistines and can you just imagine now here's the thing they didn't fight the same Philistine again cuz once they kill one that was it you don't always fight the same demon once you deal with that and God overcomes in your life you got another one that said that you got to fight so he's Faso they they they work their way through and they get to the well and I'm sure to talk through this for me why the first probably still making their way two of them are probably fighting while the other one is grabbing a picture of water and then when one gets tired they switch when you can't go no more I'm gonna continue to pray for you because there's gonna be a time where I can't go no more I want you to pray for me download the story about the Eagles when they mope yeah so when the Eagles are moping in if they're in the low period and they're just stirred their distress and they're there they're sad and they're depressed in these Eagles they come around and they drop morsels of food into the valley of this of these Eagles that's moping and trying to give them strength so I way they could nourish themselves on way that could become stronger and those Eagles that that's moping and that's in depression they give the little morsel food and they eat and those Eagles that's flying around they keep dropping down and they drop a morsel food you know why those Eagles do that because that was once them that was in the valley at one time and there were other Eagles that came by and dropped muscles of food to encourage them in the battle your victories sometimes are not because of you you may barely pray one minute a prayer a week and meanwhile the sister the brother that doesn't say a thing in church that's quiet in there but in the home the prayer warriors and the praying for you and the victory that you experience is because of their prayers and you're walking around with your chest all puffed up saying I made it through the week it's not because of you but because of a prayer warrior they may not say one word they may not shout them and ice cream they may not you know holler but when they're in that closet throughout the week they say Lord keep the church strong keep my pastor strong keep the saints of God strong watch and protect them I remember this prayer I remember this cry and it's because of that humble prayer that's how you were able to get it through the week [Applause] so they get to the the well and their warring off the enemy the battle shifts the battle shifts because it was one aspect to make the journey to go get water that was one piece of it and they had to fight the way through had to fight the way through now they had to go back home that's that's what we're at now we're going back home so they realize that when they got the order if they didn't return back with the water then everything would have been in vain it wouldn't have been worth it so they had to protect the source of life are we staying together perhaps maybe in the journey they could be careless with how they fought they could swing the sword and they can say anything and you're gonna go to hell Lord is that the other and they may be they may not have been using some wisdom because all they need they need to get to that source cuz I was like that was a young Christian where I condemned everybody to hell well I was just loose off the tongue boy I was and you don't want to come across me I preach that word as piercing as I can no wisdom but now I've received eternal life I received a baptism I now carry life so I realize it's much bigger than just me now it's about that life it's about protecting that water so when they got the water the only the only inspiration the only focus was to make it back to David and they knew that they were through 14 miles of pure battle wars they got the wounds and the scars to show it and now they got to go back through that same journey straight and narrows the way and few there be that find it so they looked at one another perhaps and then they recalled amongst themselves remember what we talked about if you fall we're gonna continue if you follow you continue because we're all in this together the sole objective is to bring that life back but we're gonna stay in this together so they picked up the water and they realized that this is serious now and this was not about them this is not about you per se it's about the life that you carry that's what this is all about from the very beginning not going to walk you through this from the very beginning Saints been jealous of the life that God has given to you so these men they grab the bucket and the only thing that's probably replaying in their mind in the midst of the battle was what David says oh if I could have a drink from the water from the well of Bethlehem that was their inspiration so when things get difficult for you what do you draw from would you pull into your remembrance what scripture comes to mind what verse opens up what quote awakens you something has to be a motivation for you that's why I love that something because he lives I can face tomorrow Belgrad talks about how that every religion could port can point towards a tune where their founder lays from Hindu to to Muslim soup you name it but Christianity we could point to an empty tomb that proves that our Savior lives and because he lives I can face tomorrow I can make it through today and they took that bucket of water and with that same inspiration that same gumption that same desire that same strength that's there that's word that was that's the type of Caleb who says look I've been in this battle for 80 years Moses made me a promise he says that I'm supposed to have this piece of the mountain he just give me my mountain he says I'm just as strong now as I was back then I don't know if we have five years I don't know if we have ten years it could be tomorrow but I want to have a strength that's so resounding then I will got to go when he looks at me that he sees that there's a son who is committed to this word all the way to the end in the changing world so these men begin to work the way back to David they were going back home they came empty handed sometimes you come to church just empty but you're gonna leave for and that's why the devil doesn't want you to come to church because he's afraid that you're gonna hear something that might change your life you're gonna react to something that might cause you to say Amen you're gonna agree to something that he doesn't like I'm why he doesn't want you to come to church you're gonna dance like you've never danced before leave the shout like you've never shouted before David was Hakeem but when he saw the aren't returning he was outside dancing in his pajamas he didn't care who was looking he saw the promise coming back home I don't care who's looking I want to serve God so these men they Ward their way back to David in the same paddle the same war program says this he says in the least and I'll wipe out pretty quickly and the least of David's thoughts was a command to those Gentiles a type of the church they gallant man those men who stood by David with Gentiles but gallant they were fearless they didn't know what fear was one then took a sword and killed 800 men and armed and them all around him what a man that was there was an Egyptian warrior run up a long spirit he only had a stick in his hand he took the stick and locked the spear out of his and took the spirit killed him himself one of the Giants had 14-inch fingers like that your fingers just as long as sure your hand closed opened them open that up that would be 28 inches and he jumped right in there and killed him see he was a gallant man the gents are looking upon anointed a gents are looking upon anointed one that he knowed was coming into power and did you notice them being so gallant to David when David finally came in power he made them rulers over cities then jesus promised the same thing the same thing make them rulers then and there and when David's desire was to have a fresh drink he probably had some old warm stagnant water up there he was drinking but he happened to drink of that fresh water down there at Bethlehem the house of God's bread and he said if I only a drink from that well and those men pulled their sword and fought 40 miles of Philistines not because he asked him to but because they know he wanted it how many times have you done something because somebody would have been blessed by it how many times you've done something because God would have honored it I think I used the story before it's just you know I have these examples that just I keep going back to when I worked for the bank I was really hungry so I went to I went I had a lunch break so I had about ten dollars in my pocket and there was a Chinese restaurant down the street so I went down down there to the Chinese restaurant because I was thinking about our chicken Romanian or fried chicken fry rice or egg rolls I was really hungry and I went down there and it was a packed place - it's a small little place but it was packed people lined up so I'm in line and I'm just waiting the only thing I could think of was just eating a good lunch so I get up to the ticket counter I put in my order and man I was excited so the lanes like well you're it's about eight dollars and so so change they're like okay so I give up my ten dollars my last ten dollars for that week and it's hard to part ways with money because if my money cannot talk the only thing whatever says goodbye so I gave up I gave her ten dollars and she looked away for a moment to call it into order and that she's doing that she's pulled out a $20 bill and it slowly makes its way towards me in that moment when everything was going so fast everything froze and that $20 bill was coming towards me just as slow as possible a lot of thoughts went through my mind my pastor wasn't there the deacon wasn't there I was there by myself no one would have known a thing and if I looked through it carefully the face of the dollar winked at me that $20.00 sale or any other devil star puts thoughts into your head I said what praise be to God I gave ten dollars and I'm getting double the blessing back the Bible says walls and them that call evil good and good evil there was no one to rebuke me no one to preach to me no one is saying that me it's just me God in the devil now what some of you would it does that money make that one ounce means way towards me and I couldn't it's like I just I couldn't move I couldn't help myself my hand was following the same rhythm and voices we're talking to my ear so they say you're a son of God you have to have a testimony you have to be greater than that it may sound cheesy to the world but that's what that's the principles that I stand on and the devil is still working with you soldier like I whispered something because I want to justify my son what she didn't hear me you can't fool God and you care for the devil and I knew that she didn't hear me cuz she's been back there calling out something and she's exchanging and that was distracted and stuff for me and that twenty dollar bill we're having a conversation and I'm trying to get her attention so I I projected my voice a little bit louder excuse me it didn't work if something says that's not good enough finally I mustered enough courtesy ma'am she spun around I'm like you giving me too much pain they're giving me too much change back she looked stunned surprised that people still exercise honesty integrity these are basic virtues basic principles that's what word that's what we're Bob that's what the bride is because I could have taken that $20 she could have win him try to balance her register it would have been off ten bucks they would have looked to her she could have been on one notice away from being fired that could have been it she could have been a single mom you see the trickling effect now she's without a job all this happened because of a decision that you made because you see it in that moment but not realizing the cascading effect so you gotta be mindful of your actions when you're by yourself doing God's will when the pastor's not there saying no no no when the Deacons not they're saying you know better cuz God's there watching you the Devils they're watching you and you're conscious bears witness so finally and I'll wrap up with this they get back and here they are they get to David they're probably tired out of breath and they take that bucket and they they they offer it to David and so we got you some water from the well of Bethlehem can you move God's so much like that that David took a step back and recognize the sacrifice of those men and he said be it far from me O Lord that I should do this is this not the blood of the man that went in jeopardy of their lives no doubt they have battle wounds and scars but yet the desire to fulfill David's desires was far greater than that and David took the water he poured as a drink offering unto the Lord because he could not find himself worthy to drink that water let's all stand so I feel as I read this last quote well Gramps is this and father while we're here in this battle of life let us be strong and courageous knowing that just across the water yonder lays eternal life and help us to come at that day as great warriors with battle scars all over us showing the results of a battle you're gonna make it to the other side with trials that you've gone through circumstances you will endure situations you encounter it's testing time and let me tell you things as you close out this year and whatever format you do next year is gonna be even harder than this year every day is harder than the previous day every week every month saying there's a great marketing scheme he's a great market here he knows how to market to you he knows how to appeal to your taste buds your interests and things that distract you that's the reason why we're coming to a time when we gotta be completely sold out to this word that you can't wait for the church doors to open to come in and to come and just rejoice you may not feel like it but you gotta show the devil whose side you are on you may not feel like reading the scripture you gotta show the devil whose side you want the Bible says I'm not gonna prolong you the Bible says redeem the time for the day's evil redeem the time one example of that just for me it takes me about 30 minutes to drive to work 30 to 45 minutes prior to that I used to listen to the radio not used to listen to the news station and and then I find that I feel myself in the morning being bombarded with chaos across the country and this happening and this happening then that doesn't set the right tone for the day for me especially after I've offered a few words of Prayer I get in my car and I listen to the news radio and then I'm driving I'm hearing that a bombing took place in and in this country and and this happened and and this happened and this happened by this time you know you started your morning with well intent and and now you you're you're you're you're taking that purification of where you're you're bombarding it with all kinds of information that's not helpful or beneficial so I started to listen to the words of the Prophet so I'll plug my earphones on got my phone right here and I'm listening to the message takes me 40 minutes every day one one trip 40 minutes of another trip 40 minutes back so how long is that an hour in 20 minutes I'm listening to message I start my day strong because spirits are all around you I'm redeeming the time so I'm feeding myself I could tell you I mean it's just there's just I've been doing this for the last year now and just a host of messages I've been able to go back and relisted to and once I haven't listened to before because I've been redeeming the time maximizing the time most of your time you're spent in your car what are you listening to how you're maximizing it and sometimes if you if you hardly read a scripture you know I'm not trying I'm just attacking the spirits things you may be already doing this if you hardly read the Bible read the message no wonder when you come to church you sit there confused when the pastor's reading it's just preaching at you and he's quoting things even though he may not be saying brother BAM said he's taking it from what brother Bromstad and you're looking at I'm kind of puzzled or you're you're not fighting anything but if you could lay the seed in you you may not know what it means the Prophet would say something and drop some lines like I don't know what that I believe it anyway but I'm just gonna keep on and hear a visiting minister or the pastor himself could stand behind the pulpit and he begins to preach the word and he goes off the beaten path on his notes and now he's ministering personally to you the see that's already laying there and he begins to say something that for everyone else that didn't have that experience like you did it's meaningless but for you you're nearly getting ready to do backflips because God is speaking directly to you and what you didn't understand becomes a revelation for you your eyes begin to open up there's such joy that's all that that's that's unspeakable that you begin to experience because God speaking directly to you because you took the opportunity to store up food so I encourage you during the course of the week store up food read a message listen to it there during the year before they have this the Bible of audio where it's kind of it's a dramatic version of it where it's in keychains but they they dramatize it spent the whole year read listen to the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation and when I got home I go back and like how Wow I go back and I go back and I read certain things that I listen to on the drive to work or from work I'm like oh man that's really stuck stood out I'm trying to redeem the time because if you don't redeem the time the devil will fill it in for you now I don't know why I threw that at the last minute but I want to encourage y'all because the days are drawing nearer and nearer the battle is becoming more and more difficult people are falling Saints are falling to the left into the right the Bible says there will be an hour of shaking and anything that could be shaken will be shaken but if you have a foundation that you're standing on then you can't be shaken Amen let's just bow hearts we're turning back over to you soldiers that's about hearts Heavenly Father it's been a while since I've gone down this path like this just to really exhort that way dear Lord but I just felt really strong in my spirit just to call out some things and just to press it upon the people here the Lord how late the hour is and how important it is just to be in tune with your word father the Lord as your prophet said and the message that I've been listening to this week he says it's the reason why he preached so hard is because he loves the people and he used the example saying that if any of them were to see him driving really fast and there was a sharp bend someone would call out be careful not for his own detriment but because they love him and that's what he's been doing is preaching out so strong just because he knows that the hour is late and that there's a call there Lord for us to be careful to pick up this word and to meditate upon a day and night to feast upon it father bless your people here no doubt the Lord the same anointing that David's men experienced this is the same anointing that your bride experienced a fearless anointing that they could confront the wiles of the devil and know that you stand with them that no matter what bad news may come their way our God is far greater bless everyone here the Lord bless their sacrifice perhaps I've taken an extra minute or two the Lord but father I just wanted to just expound the word in a way that they could receive it bless your people now bless the pastor here who's loyal faithful remember him and his family father the Lord am i broken up ways to try to bring this forward if there's anything that I may have fallen short of the Lord may you connect the dots for your people may you bring that revelation of that word to them bless your people now and Jesus Christ then we pray god bless you [Music] my desire to
