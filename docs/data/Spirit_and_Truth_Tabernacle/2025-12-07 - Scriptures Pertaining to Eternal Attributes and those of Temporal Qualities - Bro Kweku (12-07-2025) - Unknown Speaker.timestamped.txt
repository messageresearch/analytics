[10:01] We have victory through Jesus Christ our

[10:06] testify.
[10:08] Wednesday night after service, we were
[10:11] all outside uh communing a little bit,
[10:14] having fellowship with one another. I
[10:16] was talking with brother Maris and
[10:17] brother Jerry and we was just talking
[10:19] about trials and trials come. We were
[10:22] talking about you need to count it all
[10:24] joy when the trials come according to
[10:26] the scripture. And sometimes you just
[10:28] got to get quiet and be still and see
[10:30] what the Lord is doing because all
[10:32] things are working out for your good. So
[10:34] after we finish fellowshipping,
[10:37] we get ready to jump in the car and the
[10:40] starter went up. So the brothers came
[10:43] and gathered around the car. We were
[10:45] trying to jump it off and we realized
[10:46] you're hearing the clicking and
[10:47] everything that it is the starter. So as
[10:50] the brother was brothers were moving, we
[10:52] were all moving. Something kept telling
[10:54] me just pray
[10:57] and I just kept moving. He told me three
[11:00] times just pray. So I just stepped over
[11:02] to the side and I prayed a little prayer
[11:06] and instead of going and just cranking
[11:08] up the car, I started talking to brother
[11:11] Jad. And um while talking with brother
[11:14] Jack for a long time, I just I wanted to
[11:17] talk to him because I had certain
[11:20] decisions that I wanted to make. And uh
[11:24] I had already made up in my mind when we
[11:27] started studying on Wednesday in the
[11:28] book of Samuel that, you know, when
[11:31] Hannah was down praying, Eli, which was
[11:34] a priest, he was the actual shepherd, he
[11:38] didn't know what was going on. and he
[11:39] came up and uh he said, "You've been
[11:43] drinking all that. You know how it all
[11:44] goes." And then he said, "God gives you
[11:46] your petition."
[11:48] So, I just wanted to hear that. That's
[11:50] all I wanted to hear. I was just talking
[11:52] with brother Jack and he didn't even
[11:53] know that's what he said. He actually
[11:56] gave me the position that I was that I
[11:59] was looking for. So, after that, uh we
[12:02] got ready to go. The majority of the
[12:05] saints had already left. So I go and get
[12:08] in her dad's car with Naomi and Naomi
[12:10] said, "Solomon, go back and crank it up.
[12:15] Do it one more time." I said, "All
[12:17] right." So she pulled over. I jumped in
[12:19] the car and I crank it and it crank up.
[12:30] But before she told me that, she said,
[12:32] "Brother Jack just preached this.
[12:35] Why is it not we operating our faith?
[12:39] So when I crunk it up, Brother Jack and
[12:40] Sister Erica was in the store and
[12:42] brother Jack got out. He said, "Did that
[12:43] car just crack?" I said, "Yes, it did."
[12:46] So we got to praise the Lord a little
[12:48] bit. Then Naomi came up and she gave a
[12:50] little testimony. And brother Jack said
[12:53] right before we left, he said, "You know
[12:55] why that happened?
[12:57] Because of what you did on Sunday."
[13:01] So the first thing came to my mind, well
[13:04] the devil didn't like that. We going to
[13:06] do it again this Sunday.
[13:09] So we going to
[13:11] there's a flow down here.
[13:15] It was anointed last week.
[13:18] We broke the ice, stepped on the devil
[13:20] neck. We going to step on again.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's sing this little
[13:26] song together. Messiah is the King of
[13:28] Kings. Now, we say he's the King of
[13:32] Kings.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; He's a Lord of Lords, but it ain't
[13:37] really there. He's the King of Kings
[13:40] because this is where he dwells. We are
[13:43] his dwelling place.
[13:47] Come on, put your hands on him.

[40:46] fellowship with us.
[40:48] She's one of the ones that go way back
[40:52] at um we were at home this week and I'm
[40:56] trying to think. Um I think it was
[41:00] Monday night. Yeah, Monday night. Uh
[41:05] I can't remember what happened and why
[41:07] my wife and I was was out, but we were
[41:10] out kind of late. And um when we got
[41:13] back home, our uh all of our kids were
[41:18] there cuz uh Aaron and Rebecca were here
[41:20] visiting. And uh so Paul and Sandy came
[41:23] over with the grandkids. Was it It was
[41:25] Sunday night. Oh, I went to a wedding on
[41:28] Sunday night. Thank you. That's what it
[41:29] was. And um and I think we got home
[41:32] late. It must have been close to 11:00,
[41:36] 10 something. And um and Paul and Xandy
[41:40] were still there. And I'm like, usually
[41:41] they'd be gone with the kids and they
[41:43] got to go to work and all this, you
[41:45] know, all this other stuff. So, but they
[41:47] were still there and I was pretty
[41:48] shocked. But they were inside the house
[41:51] watching an old video and they told me
[41:54] Alexandria just would not do anything
[41:57] else until that video got to running.
[42:01] And it was an old concert that we did at
[42:04] um at Rapture Faith and um and you saw
[42:08] Sister Dixon on the video. Uh you know,
[42:11] and and the girls were just pointing at
[42:13] everybody on the video and and
[42:14] everything. And I said, "Yep." And
[42:16] Sister Boyd was there on that video. You
[42:19] remember Brother Stew? You remember
[42:21] Brother Stew? He was on that video.
[42:24] Yeah. It was a neighbor of you all. And
[42:26] uh so we went way back and and they was
[42:29] telling me how Xandy just say I mean
[42:31] they was trying to get this thing
[42:32] connected cuz it's a old VCR trying to
[42:35] connect to a new television and they was
[42:38] having all kind of problems and Xandy
[42:40] wouldn't let Paul sit down
[42:44] until she got that thing working. She
[42:47] wanted to see that video.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. It's something about
[42:53] familiar places.
[42:58] Glory.
[43:00] But but when we saw Sister Dixon on the
[43:02] video, it just reminded us so much of
[43:04] where we come from and how good God has
[43:07] been to us. Uh they have a song they
[43:11] say, "Down through the years.
[43:14] God's been good to me." Oh, y'all better
[43:17] stop.
[43:25] Oh, Lord have mercy.

[47:06] was not even a part of their design
[47:10] to go backwards. So, it's not a part of
[47:12] our design either. We ain't going back.

[50:47] well. As I mentioned to you all, um
[50:52] um yeah, I'll mention this and Christmas
[50:55] blessings. This is where we um usually
[50:59] give out gift cards to um
[51:03] uh to bless others during this Christmas
[51:05] season. And we we usually do that at the
[51:08] pantry. We have a place that God has
[51:10] opened up for us to be able to do
[51:12] outreach. So, we just we're we're
[51:14] compounding all of our efforts there uh
[51:16] just to make it easier on everyone. Uh
[51:19] but we uh we want to give gift cards to
[51:22] some of the families that we serve there
[51:23] at the pantry. Uh we have a box in the
[51:26] back. It's a polka dot box that you'll
[51:29] see. Uh if you buy a gift card, just put
[51:31] it in there. If you want to just put a
[51:33] little card, uh put it in a little card,
[51:35] write a little note just to, you know,
[51:37] to wish someone a merry Christmas. I'm
[51:40] sure to be a blessing to these families.
[51:42] I believe um we have to have that. Is it
[51:46] next Sunday?
[51:48] By Wednesday the Okay, by Wednesday the
[51:51] 17th. They have to be in by Wednesday
[51:54] the 17th. So uh keep that in mind and uh
[51:58] but um uh the plan is to give as many
[52:02] cards as we can just to be a blessing to
[52:04] to others during this uh Christmas
[52:07] season. Amen. Also just want to make
[52:10] mention we have our
[52:12] upcoming
[52:14] um
[52:16] uh watch night service and uh we have
[52:19] we're working on something should be
[52:21] finalized by tomorrow and we'll let you
[52:23] know where we'll be going because the
[52:25] the church has asked if they could use
[52:27] their space on that night and um which
[52:30] it belongs to them. They were asking us
[52:33] if we could just be out by 9:30. I said
[52:35] that's what time we get started.
[52:39] So, I I guess we going to have to find
[52:41] somewhere else. And um you know, and I
[52:44] and and and God always makes things a
[52:47] little uncomfortable.
[52:49] I was reading something on yesterday
[52:51] about, you know, nine ways to know the
[52:54] will of God. And one of the ways to know
[52:57] whether God is opening a door for you,
[52:59] they said, is when things begin to get
[53:01] uncomfortable,
[53:03] that's how you know God is stretching
[53:05] you to somewhere else that you need to
[53:07] go.
[53:09] I said, "Well, I I'll receive that." Cuz
[53:12] I got here this morning and I looked and
[53:14] saw a sign. And on the sign, it said
[53:17] there was another church renting from
[53:18] here on Sundays. And I don't know what
[53:20] other time they rent. But I say, "My
[53:22] God, my God, my God, it's getting a
[53:25] little crowded."
[53:27] And I'm sure it's a blessing to them,
[53:29] but for us, it's a little tight. And uh
[53:33] we're just going to have to just put our
[53:35] faith on the line and keep praying and
[53:37] fast and believing God to open up a door
[53:40] uh supernaturally for us. And like I
[53:42] said, we ain't going backward now.
[53:45] Whatever God getting ready to open up,
[53:46] it's got to be more and got to be
[53:48] better. Amen. So So please keep that in
[53:51] mind. We'll give you the address. We'll
[53:53] start announcing that hopefully by
[53:54] Wednesday to let you know. But it will
[53:56] be a uh we got a site in West Palm Beach
[53:59] that we'll be looking at going to do our
[54:01] watch night service. Amen. There. So
[54:04] y'all start preparing, give testimonies,
[54:06] things that God has done for you. We've
[54:09] been in the season of I will restore,
[54:11] say the Lord. And y'all look around. Is
[54:13] it is it restoration around here?
[54:16] Come on now. Y'all y'all know God has
[54:19] God has manifested his word in our
[54:22] midst.
[54:24] God has done what he said he was going
[54:26] to do and there's still more work to be
[54:28] done.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; So, we're we're we're under expectation,
[54:31] but I want you all to just be prepared
[54:33] to kind of share testimonies on that
[54:35] night. And uh and we're going to we're

[54:38] come into the uh the new year. So, we
[54:41] have our giving uh it's through Zel,

[1:00:13] just to drink and eat and just go around
[1:00:17] human life activities, but Lord, you've
[1:00:19] got a divine order of service for our
[1:00:21] lives, every member of the body of
[1:00:24] Christ. We thank you for the anointing
[1:00:26] this morning, the songs, the
[1:00:29] testimonies, and seeing our precious
[1:00:32] sister Dixon here. It's a wonderful
[1:00:34] testimony that you are alive and you

[1:01:12] take control over the four corners of
[1:01:13] the building and every spirit that is
[1:01:15] contrary to your spirit that will fight
[1:01:18] against the blessing of your people,
[1:01:19] Lord. Father, let a consuming fire
[1:01:22] consume that spirit, whether in the
[1:01:24] hearts, in the minds of the people,
[1:01:26] Lord, and let each and everyone get
[1:01:28] their victory, Lord Jesus, that we go

[1:01:34] We thank you. Bless our precious pastor,
[1:01:37] brother Jack and elders of the church.
[1:01:40] We commend each and everyone into your

[1:01:43] streaming online. Bless them from their
[1:01:45] homes. Lord, we thank you. We just bless
[1:01:48] your name. In the name of the Lord
[1:01:50] Jesus, we pray. Amen. God bless you. We
[1:01:55] can take our seat.
[1:01:58] The Lord is good.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Dixon.
[1:02:07] God bless you. God hears prayers
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and it gives me encouragement. For a
[1:02:12] couple of weeks, Sister Dixon has been
[1:02:13] on my heart to pray for her.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; However, I wasn't even expecting to be
[1:02:17] her to be here today.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; So, when I heard her name from I think
[1:02:21] brother Solomon, I said, "No, sister
[1:02:23] Michelle, that she was going to sing a
[1:02:25] song for her." I said, "Lord, you are
[1:02:26] awesome."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; So, we thank the Lord. So, we want to uh
[1:02:31] God bless you our musicians.
[1:02:34] We want to speak on a a little topic. Uh
[1:02:37] the title is scriptures pertaining to
[1:02:40] eternal attributes and those of temporal
[1:02:43] qualities. And if you can okay we
[1:02:45] already have it like highlighted. So we
[1:02:47] want to see certain scriptures every
[1:02:49] scripture in the Bible
[1:02:51] before we were born that scripture was
[1:02:53] ordained in heaven for our work on this
[1:02:56] earth.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And some of the scriptures are of
[1:02:59] eternal qualities. In other words they
[1:03:01] pertain to eternal things of God. Right?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; They are eternal, everlasting, forever
[1:03:06] and ever.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; It will carry on to the other side.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And there are scriptures that are only
[1:03:11] temporal
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; or they pretend to be temporal things of
[1:03:14] life.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; The flesh and things we see around us,
[1:03:19] they are not eternal. And those
[1:03:21] scriptures will fulfill in temporal
[1:03:22] dimension
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and they'll be done away with. just have
[1:03:26] us even in the dimension. There are
[1:03:27] dimensions that are eternal
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; that that were there before the
[1:03:31] foundation of the world
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; and they are here and they will be there
[1:03:35] when we leave this earth
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and there are some of the dimension that
[1:03:39] are temporal they were put here to
[1:03:42] create a contrast
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; because without a contrast we can't
[1:03:45] manifest certain attribute eternal
[1:03:47] attribute of life
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; so those dimension will happen and when
[1:03:51] they have done with their job their
[1:03:53] duties they'll be annihilated consumed
[1:03:55] and done away with That's right.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And some of those dimension work in our
[1:03:58] lives even as we are here.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Sickness will work in your life
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; but it's not it's not it's not eternal.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Old age works in your life. It's not
[1:04:08] eternal.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Baby in diapers works in our life but
[1:04:12] it's not eternal.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Weaknesses in the flesh are temporal but
[1:04:17] they are not eternal.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost will do away with
[1:04:20] those temporal things. Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's uh maybe start with one.
[1:04:26] I've got a lot of scriptures and what
[1:04:28] I'm think I'm going to do is I'll go
[1:04:29] through the slide first. First one I was
[1:04:32] just praying a lot. I wish I don't have
[1:04:34] to preach with slice. I just want to go
[1:04:36] under anointing but some of the
[1:04:39] teachings pertain to some of the
[1:04:41] preaching pertain to teaching. So when
[1:04:42] you have scriptures and quotes, it helps
[1:04:45] even other brothers, ministers to also
[1:04:47] study further and the Lord reveals more
[1:04:49] thing to us. Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; So we need the scriptures and the
[1:04:53] quotations of the prophet.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; So let's start with a go to the first
[1:04:56] slide and see we can lay a background
[1:04:59] with Ephesians 1:4 and Revelation 13:8.
[1:05:03] It's just a simple scripture. Ephesians
[1:05:06] 14 Ephesians chapter 1 vers4. If you can
[1:05:09] be on our feet as we read as many as can
[1:05:12] as we read the word of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:14] Christ. Ephesians 1 uh chapter 1 vers4.
[1:05:18] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:05:21] before the foundation of the world that
[1:05:23] we should be holy and without blame
[1:05:26] before
[1:05:28] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:05:30] before him in love. So the choosing was
[1:05:33] done when before the foundation of the
[1:05:35] world. So that is eternal attribute
[1:05:38] before you were born before Adam dropped
[1:05:40] here. The choosing was not done based on
[1:05:43] your sins.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; The choosing was not done based on your
[1:05:46] strength. It wasn't done based on your
[1:05:48] your your capability to serve the Lord.
[1:05:50] But it was chosen before even your flesh
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; was put the elements of your flesh were
[1:05:54] put on earth
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; that you should be holy and without
[1:05:58] blame blame in love.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; How can you think about a human being be
[1:06:02] holy
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; and that's aation of God. So if God want
[1:06:05] us to be holy, he has to make a way for
[1:06:07] it.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was the lamp of God
[1:06:10] before the foundation of the world to
[1:06:11] cleanse us from our unholiness. Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] Revelation 13:8
[1:06:18] and all that dwell dwelleth on earth
[1:06:20] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:06:23] written in the book of life of the lamp
[1:06:26] or in other words we can call it the
[1:06:27] lamb's book of life
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; slain from before the foundation of the
[1:06:31] world
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; so they are human beings that are they
[1:06:34] could be your neighbors friends
[1:06:35] co-workers bosses whoever they may be
[1:06:38] their names were not the truth is that
[1:06:40] their names were not written in the land
[1:06:41] book of life
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world
[1:06:45] and you can't help them. You can't push
[1:06:46] the word of the Lord in their head. It
[1:06:48] will just come up to the other head, the
[1:06:50] other ears because there's no anchor to
[1:06:53] receive the word.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; But they serve a purpose on this in this
[1:06:57] life.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; They are human beings.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; They've got flesh and blood like you.
[1:07:01] They've got human spirit. They've got a
[1:07:03] soul, but they don't have the recept to
[1:07:06] receive the word of the Lord
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; because they were not made so. Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the name of the Lord. We
[1:07:12] may take our seat. My brothers and
[1:07:14] sisters,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; how worthy can you can you how can you
[1:07:18] think about it? One sister said,
[1:07:19] "Brother, it blows my mind away when I
[1:07:21] think about predestination that I was
[1:07:23] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:07:24] world."
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; How can you perceive that you were born
[1:07:26] in sin, raised in iniquity, but God
[1:07:29] chose you.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He chose brother Jackdav before the
[1:07:32] foundation of the world.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; He chose sister Erica before the
[1:07:35] foundation of the world to be where you
[1:07:37] are to be in this position. Amen. Before
[1:07:40] brother Jack was born, the Lord ordained
[1:07:42] him to be a minister, pastor of God.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Before Sister Erica was born, the Lord
[1:07:46] ordained her to be a wife of a minister,
[1:07:49] the first lady of God.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Before Sister Bur was born, she was
[1:07:52] ordained to be a mother of her pastor.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't her choosing. It's not your
[1:07:57] choosing. God ordained those things
[1:07:59] before you were even dropped on this
[1:08:00] earth.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And my brother, when
[1:08:03] those scriptures embibbe in your heart,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; it takes away all the weaknesses of the
[1:08:08] mind,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; all the doubts and the unbelief
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and then you can start as a son and a
[1:08:13] daughter of God
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; that you are Elohim in the incarnate
[1:08:16] form
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; to manifest your word and in your day.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; So let's go through the next scripture
[1:08:24] the next the next uh slide. I want to
[1:08:26] quickly go through the slides first
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; that is the dimensions the eternal
[1:08:31] dimensions versus the temporate realms.
[1:08:33] All right.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; The first dimension is the universal
[1:08:35] space of occupancy.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; All the universe, not only on this
[1:08:39] earth, beyond the earth, we've got other
[1:08:41] planets.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; We've got Jupiter, Mercury, and beyond
[1:08:44] that, we've got universe, spiritual
[1:08:46] universe,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; where angels are,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; where the saints are.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; As we are here, there are saints here.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; But there's another world right here
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; which this eyes is not able to detect
[1:08:56] and see.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; But the saints of God are here.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I think two days, was it yesterday? I
[1:09:02] send a message a song. I'm not a singer
[1:09:05] Jack, but I try to make a noise, joyful
[1:09:07] noise unto the Lord.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; So there's a minister friend of mine who
[1:09:11] loves I sing for him and I recorded for
[1:09:13] him. He studies, he's trying to study uh
[1:09:15] my native language, Akan tree in Ghana.
[1:09:18] So I sent him songs and we kind of
[1:09:20] practiced a little bit. So I sang a song
[1:09:22] in English, in Spanish and then in Akan
[1:09:25] and I sent it to him. And so he sent me
[1:09:27] said, "Brother, you don't know what
[1:09:28] happened to me." I said, "What?" He
[1:09:30] said, "I was involved in an accident on
[1:09:31] November 22nd." I said, "Really? You
[1:09:33] didn't tell me? I didn't know." He said,
[1:09:35] "I was coming from work and driving back
[1:09:37] home, I think in the midnight, and there
[1:09:40] was a black car, no light, no nothing to
[1:09:44] see that there was a car on the road."
[1:09:45] So, I ran into this vehicle. He said,
[1:09:48] "When I run, I was expecting uh the the
[1:09:52] airbag to deploy. It didn't deploy, but
[1:09:55] I saw somebody wrap around me."
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Wow. when the collision, it wasn't a
[1:10:00] head-on collision. It was the front side
[1:10:02] of the vehicle, the right side or so.
[1:10:04] And then there was a big crash and the
[1:10:06] guy had broken bones. There was a
[1:10:08] female, a woman driving and I don't know
[1:10:10] the husband or whoever, he said they had
[1:10:12] broken bones, but surprisingly there was
[1:10:15] nothing. Only had some pains. They took
[1:10:16] us to the hospital and I came back home.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; But I saw somebody wrap around me
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; when they brace. Who do you think was
[1:10:24] wrap around you? Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; It is the ray you.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; You might not see him in this in this
[1:10:34] eyes with this eyes,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; but he is in you. Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; In fact, he was in you before you were
[1:10:41] even born again.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; What is the new birth? The new birth
[1:10:45] helps you to know that Christ is in you.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Sometime in
[1:10:50] preaching, we preach it as if God comes
[1:10:53] to you.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham said, I'll go to my
[1:10:56] quotes. I think I've gone ahead of
[1:10:58] myself. He said, whatever you need on
[1:10:59] this earth, God put it in you.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, if the mango seed or apple
[1:11:06] seed before this little apple seed,
[1:11:09] orange, whatever seed,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; everything, brother, preach with me.
[1:11:14] All the fruits. He said the fruits that
[1:11:16] you're going to take from the apple
[1:11:17] tree,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; your children will take from the apple
[1:11:19] tree,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; your grandchildren will take from the
[1:11:22] apple tree.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; All of them in the little seed.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Troy,
[1:11:29] how can how can it be?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; You take this little seed,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; you can dissect it. The doctors, the
[1:11:35] anatomist can dissect it. They're not
[1:11:37] going to find no fruits,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; no trees, no flowers.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But yes, it's hidden right there. Where
[1:11:43] is he at? Is the intelligence of the
[1:11:45] almighty.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And the new birth was right in you.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Only we didn't know it was there.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to tell you this test. Let
[1:11:59] let me share with you. I was born and
[1:12:01] raised in Ghana and I went to a school.
[1:12:03] It's in Cape Co. It's a boarding school
[1:12:06] and somewhere young as 9 years old. Your
[1:12:08] parent drop you there because it was an
[1:12:09] early school. So parents want their
[1:12:11] children to pass through school through
[1:12:12] that school and the school was very
[1:12:14] rigid. It was a Methodist institution
[1:12:16] established in 1876. The laws the
[1:12:19] regulations is boy school. So it's very
[1:12:22] rigid. The school is it's like a college
[1:12:24] very big compound with lands and and and
[1:12:27] a stadium. But then the entrance of the
[1:12:30] school there are a couple of uh stones
[1:12:32] white stones. If you cross that stones
[1:12:35] it means you are in town. And so if you
[1:12:37] don't have permission from from a
[1:12:39] teacher and you cross you when you are
[1:12:42] caught you are in town. One of the rule
[1:12:44] was that a bridge of a a breach of
[1:12:46] common sense a breach of school rule. In
[1:12:48] other words, if you see a trash and you
[1:12:50] don't pick it is a breach to your common
[1:12:52] sense.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; So one day
[1:12:57] what one day I was in school. We went to
[1:12:59] school. I was dropping school and I was
[1:13:01] like I don't want to go to cafeteria. I
[1:13:03] don't want to start eating cafeteria
[1:13:04] food. I want food from town. So the
[1:13:07] boys, we have this operation. Listen, if
[1:13:08] I don't want to go to town, I can pay
[1:13:10] you um we call it pay you, what's the
[1:13:13] word? I'll pay you a risk allowance for
[1:13:16] you to go to town and buy me food. So
[1:13:18] let's I can give you $50, buy me food.
[1:13:21] Let's say $10, you use the $30 to buy
[1:13:24] yours. So I was like, you know what?
[1:13:26] I'll give you I'll give you a risk
[1:13:28] allowance so that if you go to town
[1:13:29] said, no, no, I'm not going. If you want
[1:13:31] to go, go buy your own food. I said, no.
[1:13:33] cuz something told me, a voice told me
[1:13:35] that when you go to town, you're going
[1:13:36] to get in trouble.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; So, I just I'm not going. But I wanted
[1:13:40] food from town.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So, I was trying with all my friends,
[1:13:42] hey, they were going to town. I'll pay
[1:13:44] you this money. I'll give you the risk
[1:13:46] allowance because we call it risk
[1:13:47] allowance. When you caught, you're going
[1:13:49] to be suspended. They're going to send
[1:13:50] you back to your parents.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So, that person is taking a risk to go
[1:13:53] to town without permission. So, he has
[1:13:56] to get his risk allowance to do that.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So, none of my friends were like, "No,
[1:14:00] you got to go with me. if you want to
[1:14:02] go, we go together. So fin said, what I
[1:14:05] let's go and I went and right at the at
[1:14:08] the entrance of the school, the
[1:14:10] principal was hiding somewhere playing
[1:14:14] playing we call it ch it's like a it's
[1:14:16] like chess playing chess with some
[1:14:18] people. So when we cross there, you you
[1:14:22] you follow me, let's go back to school.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And I remember that the voice told me
[1:14:26] that when you go, you're going to get in
[1:14:29] trouble.
[1:14:30] But I defied that voice and that is the
[1:14:32] same voice
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; after I had a new birth
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; all over my life in my ministry in
[1:14:38] England in in Mexico. The same voice has
[1:14:41] been speaking with me. It's not a
[1:14:42] different voice.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; And I didn't know anything about new
[1:14:46] birth. I was I was in Pentecost. New
[1:14:48] birth is speaking in tongues.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that was a voice. I know
[1:14:51] there was an internal voice telling me
[1:14:52] do not go. You're going to get in
[1:14:54] trouble.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; So the song goes like he was there all
[1:14:58] the time.
[1:15:00] He was there all the time.
[1:15:03] The theophony was there all the time.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Even when we were born in sinship
[1:15:07] iniquity,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; you are eternal son of God.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You are eternal daughter of God.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You can never be lost. Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And when we can't help oursel, he helps
[1:15:23] us.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; So in the with the dimension, let's come
[1:15:27] back to the dimension right quick. Uh
[1:15:29] the first dimension is space. It's
[1:15:31] eternal. Second dimension is matter or
[1:15:34] the earth. It's also eternal. But the
[1:15:36] third dimension which is time, time is
[1:15:39] temporary. Time came into manifestation
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; to create a contrast.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And anything that has got to do with
[1:15:46] time will fade away. It could be forever
[1:15:49] and ever. It could be aons and millions
[1:15:51] of years. It will still come to an end.
[1:15:53] Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And the fourth dimension is records,
[1:15:56] science, communication, internet, tech,
[1:15:59] TV. Abraham said that TV was TV was in
[1:16:03] Garden of Eden when Adam was there.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; It's only now science is trying to
[1:16:07] discover TV waves.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; But it was right there in the Garden of
[1:16:10] Eden.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Adam was watching TV, not with this
[1:16:13] screen. Amen. Because he had the ether
[1:16:15] wave from the other dimension.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Adam could look at the zodiac. There was
[1:16:19] no clouds. When Adam was on earth,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; he could read Christ through the sun. He
[1:16:24] could read the wife of Christ through
[1:16:26] the moon. He could see his destiny
[1:16:28] through the sky.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That was the Bible Adam had. And all the
[1:16:32] record are in the dimension. Now that
[1:16:34] the the tech billion or trillioners are
[1:16:37] trying to make money out of it. But it's
[1:16:39] always internet is not it's like I think
[1:16:43] what do you call it sometime people are
[1:16:44] like Americans to Americans people don't
[1:16:47] exist until Americans go there
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; people have lived their life years
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; they are there but then those nations
[1:16:57] don't exist when American colonizers
[1:17:00] enter there then you are discovered no
[1:17:03] you are just discovering it they were
[1:17:04] there before you got there amen
[1:17:08] So way beforeh what do you call it all
[1:17:11] these tech billionaires got to know
[1:17:13] about this technology the tech was
[1:17:15] already there
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; because it was the spoken word of God
[1:17:18] and they are in the dimensions amen
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and they are eternal that's why said
[1:17:22] that whatever you do on earth if you
[1:17:24] don't repent your record will be right
[1:17:26] there waiting for you
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; amen glory hallelujah the fourth
[1:17:30] dimension the fifth dimension is hell
[1:17:32] and that is temporal hell death unbelief
[1:17:36] and the realms of the lost where the
[1:17:39] demons the lost souls are where demons
[1:17:41] and perversion and diseases wars
[1:17:43] politics all this political kingdom they
[1:17:46] are temporal
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and so whatever politics makes you to do
[1:17:50] is going to be temporal
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; you can't take it with you
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I saw a spirit that was born the spirit
[1:17:55] has already been there since garden of
[1:17:57] Eden h sorry since the book of Genesis
[1:18:00] but then it was legalized in the United
[1:18:02] States some few years ago when I came to
[1:18:05] the United States homosexualism wasn't
[1:18:07] legal.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But then just in the time of some
[1:18:11] president and the vice president, the
[1:18:12] vice president make a proclamation
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; and the the president has to back him.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And so I saw some popular basketball
[1:18:19] players or baseball players were one of
[1:18:20] the first people to become to come up as
[1:18:22] they were gays
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and lesbians.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; But now that spirit is a spirit of
[1:18:28] perversion.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; God made you either a man or a woman.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't make you anything in between.
[1:18:34] Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; So if you carry that spirit on you and
[1:18:37] when you leave this earth that spirit
[1:18:39] cannot go to the presence of God
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; and your time is end on earth.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So you can't go to the sixth dimension
[1:18:46] which where God is and the seventh
[1:18:48] dimension
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; and you can't come back to the earth.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; You can't come back in time.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; So you are been you're going to be in a
[1:18:54] place of torment where demons will
[1:18:56] torment you.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've seen somebody
[1:18:59] who's been tormented by demons.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Sometime it's worse than dying. Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; It's worse than depression.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's even worse than suicide.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Because they torment you, torture. You
[1:19:10] are not dead,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; but the demon spit are touching your
[1:19:13] brain.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; They're touching your mind, your
[1:19:15] emotion.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And I happen to see a lady in Mexico.
[1:19:18] Thank God her grandfather was was a man
[1:19:20] of God. I believe that was the only
[1:19:22] thing that saved her life.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; She went into prostitution. A young a
[1:19:25] young lady thinking she was beautiful
[1:19:27] and demons tormented her. She was on a
[1:19:29] bed dying. Not just that, but the
[1:19:32] torment.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; When we went to pray for her, you could
[1:19:35] see that she's in a I mean, how he was
[1:19:39] more than depression. She was in a
[1:19:42] serious torment in her mind, in her
[1:19:44] emotions.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; But thank God, somebody was standing the
[1:19:47] gap for her.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; So those demons, they are there.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; But if you are in another dimension,
[1:19:54] they can't even come near you.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. And the sixth
[1:19:58] dimension, that is where you live. If
[1:20:00] you have got a new birth in your life,
[1:20:02] if you are a son of God, a daughter of
[1:20:04] God. So the sixth dimension is heaven,
[1:20:06] theophony, angels, saints, regions of
[1:20:09] the bless where the saints live. Not
[1:20:12] just when they die, but when you are
[1:20:13] here, you a saint. Are you a saint?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Are you in the sixth dimension?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Is the sixth dimension in you?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Is heaven in you?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Or you want to die before you go to
[1:20:22] heaven?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; No. I want heaven in my heart.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And you want heaven in your life? Amen.
[1:20:29] Because if you don't have heaven in you,
[1:20:31] this life will not be pleasant for you.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Because the torment you're going to go
[1:20:35] through,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; you don't have no peace.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; People have got billions, millions,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; but they don't have peace in their
[1:20:42] heart.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; People have got all the cars, houses,
[1:20:46] mansions,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; but they afraid of death.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz when they think about death, they
[1:20:52] don't have no hope beyond this life
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; because they don't have representation.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing there to receive the word of the
[1:20:58] Lord. But God has blessed you before the
[1:21:00] foundation of the world to be able to
[1:21:02] receive
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; the theophony. Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; In fact, the theophony was in you before
[1:21:06] you drop here on earth.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And the seventh
[1:21:10] dimension is where everything began.
[1:21:13] That is Elohim, Christ.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; The word man, the logos,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; the remma,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; that is where the almighty when we in
[1:21:20] him. When you say we're in God, sometime
[1:21:22] our mind is like having a thinking in
[1:21:24] your mind. No, it's not the same with
[1:21:25] God. with me. I have a thought tomorrow
[1:21:28] maybe I'll go to Miami. That is a human
[1:21:32] thought.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But the thought of God if you read the
[1:21:34] church is not the same.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; God's thought is real.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Bar Solomon Johnson was a son of God
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; in real form.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Not in physical not in the time form but
[1:21:45] he was a physical being
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; with different material not earthly
[1:21:48] material of calcium, potassium and
[1:21:51] X-rays. No,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; you have another material which is a
[1:21:54] celestia. Glory.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You were not as as old as you were maybe
[1:21:58] in your 40s, 50s. You were as young as
[1:22:00] about 18 years old.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; You existed in that dimension.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; There's a song that we sing. Uh let me
[1:22:08] see what's the song. Uh I forgot the
[1:22:10] song, but the song doesn't it was
[1:22:12] composed by I think Pentecostal. So they
[1:22:14] don't have the revelation. There's a
[1:22:16] song that said a place we've never been
[1:22:17] before. No, that's a place you your life
[1:22:19] began.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I when when I hear song, I
[1:22:24] look at the revelation the song. If it
[1:22:26] doesn't tally with the revelation of
[1:22:27] Christ in me, I don't take it or I will
[1:22:30] change it to my revelation. Amen.
[1:22:32] Because I was there all along. Amen. Quu
[1:22:35] was in a man of God, not as a thought of
[1:22:37] a human but in a real form. Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I was existing as an 18 year to 25 year
[1:22:43] old young man. Amen. And when you drop
[1:22:46] this earth, what is the difference
[1:22:47] between before you existed and when? The
[1:22:49] only thing is you didn't have an earthly
[1:22:50] experience.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Brother didn't know what redemption was
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; when it was like 18 years.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hello my brother. How are you? How old
[1:22:59] are you? 12. Okay. You are much younger.
[1:23:01] You are not there yet brother.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; How old are you?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Josiah.
[1:23:08] How old are you?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Perfect. That's that's right there.
[1:23:13] Right there. Brother Josiah. So that's
[1:23:15] the right like the age that brother Jack
[1:23:17] was. Amen. But he didn't understand what
[1:23:20] redemption. What is Lord? What is
[1:23:21] redemption? Say you find out
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; what is hungry.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You find out
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; what is death.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You You find out
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; what is crying.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You find out
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; what is gay hair.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You find out.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; What is pains in the ribs? You find out
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; what is arthritis. You find out
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; what is graveyard. you find out
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't exist in that
[1:23:47] dimension
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; so now God or mine
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; permit me God has to take the theophony
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Jagdav the theophony
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; who can be here in United States
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; and if you want to go to Mexico or North
[1:24:06] Carolina Louisiana to preach he doesn't
[1:24:09] have to buy ticket sister Erica you
[1:24:10] don't have to go online and set cheap
[1:24:12] ticket no sister Sarah I don't have to
[1:24:13] do that for your parents.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Now, he need to go to preach in
[1:24:16] Louisiana. Okay. By thought, he's in
[1:24:19] Louisiana.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; He need to play guitar. You don't have
[1:24:24] to go to guitar company. H your flute
[1:24:26] instrument. Sister car. Just by thought.
[1:24:29] It come from the earth and you play your
[1:24:31] instrument. When you finish, you bring
[1:24:32] it back to the earth.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; And that power is in you.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That attribute is in you.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How is Dixon? God bless
[1:24:42] Dixon. I am so happy to see you. Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's been my prayer and I was surprised
[1:24:47] the Lord you answer prayer.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I mean in real time. Amen. So now God
[1:24:52] has to put brother Jagdafani,
[1:24:55] brother Josiah Theopani
[1:24:58] into the earth to experience tears to
[1:25:01] experience gray hair to experience pain
[1:25:05] to experience sicknesses to experience
[1:25:07] everything that we go through in human
[1:25:08] form. So he was ordained putting his
[1:25:11] father as a seed.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Whilst his father was a young man, he
[1:25:14] was carrying brother Jack like just like
[1:25:15] the mango seed
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; and then through the bedding grounds,
[1:25:18] brother Jack Daf was born in earth.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I'll go back to some some some quotes.
[1:25:23] He said when you were baby, sorry, when
[1:25:25] a mother is pregnant,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; before the the baby is born, the mother
[1:25:30] could be as cruel and as wicked as you
[1:25:32] can be.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; She could be a woman who beat the
[1:25:34] husband who beat all the people in the
[1:25:36] neighborhood. There are really some
[1:25:37] women who beat their husband. If you
[1:25:40] fall in the hands of those women who
[1:25:41] want to you, they are stronger than men.
[1:25:45] If you don't bring the paycheck, you are
[1:25:47] in trouble.
[1:25:50] You have to work and bring on the
[1:25:51] paycheck. You have to account for how
[1:25:53] much you you use on gasoline. You have
[1:25:55] to account on how how much you use for
[1:25:57] breakfast and lunch. If you go over it,
[1:25:59] you are in trouble.
[1:26:02] So, but yes, those that woman when he's
[1:26:05] about to give birth to a baby, she's so
[1:26:08] sweet and tender.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; What? Where is that sweetness coming
[1:26:11] from?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; It's coming from the angel.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; The baby when the baby's in the womb,
[1:26:16] the baby doesn't have any life. The life
[1:26:18] is all from the mother.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; It's just like muscles.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; I mean, feeding off from the mother. But
[1:26:24] then the life of the baby comes around
[1:26:26] the mother just before she's born. And
[1:26:29] then when the the the the baby is born,
[1:26:32] then the angel or the messenger or the
[1:26:34] human spirit enters into the baby and
[1:26:37] they begin to cry and then there's life
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and you go through the process they see.
[1:26:42] Oh my I'm getting ahead of myself.
[1:26:44] Praise be to God.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; We go there. Let's let's finish the
[1:26:51] dimension for the sake of time because
[1:26:53] it's already 11. So let's go to H. So
[1:26:56] the dimension is the the Elohim. Let's
[1:26:58] go to uh the A dimension. The A
[1:27:01] dimension is what we give back to God.
[1:27:04] Abraham said there's seven major
[1:27:05] dimension. Then he said there's a
[1:27:07] dimension is the Pentecostal. He said we
[1:27:08] have to give credit to the Pentecostals
[1:27:10] for that worship and praise and
[1:27:13] Pentecostal songs which bring the
[1:27:15] presence of God down. So the A dimension
[1:27:18] is what we give back to God.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our praise and worship that we
[1:27:22] give back to the Lord. Ram call it a
[1:27:24] dimension. And now we have the lake of
[1:27:26] fire which is a brimstone and burning
[1:27:28] sulfur. Not a physical sulfur, not a
[1:27:30] physical lake. The lake of fire is what
[1:27:33] is the pillar of fire.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; What can consume demons? The pillar of
[1:27:37] fire.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; What can consume the old nature?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; So that consumes and anhalate any
[1:27:44] temporal dimension out of existence.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's nothing the
[1:27:49] natural fire. Take a take a natural
[1:27:51] fire. take a paper and and strike a
[1:27:54] match into the paper. It's going to
[1:27:55] burn. But then you see the cab on the
[1:27:57] ashes, but the pillar of fire doesn't
[1:28:00] burn and leave ashes.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; When he consumes the old person, he
[1:28:05] consumes the old person.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; When he consumes you, he consumes you.
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; That you don't the old man doesn't exist
[1:28:12] no more. Then he place himself and you
[1:28:15] become a brand new cross his path. You
[1:28:17] take a knife and slay your ears.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; God. But God
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; who ordained him before the foundation
[1:28:23] of the world changed Peter.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And the vision was shown to Peter three
[1:28:27] times because the Lord could not do
[1:28:28] that. He's done it already in his flesh.
[1:28:31] So he needed your flesh, Peter's flesh
[1:28:33] to manifest himself. And when Peter
[1:28:35] Peter agreed now, he went to preach and
[1:28:38] Cornelos received the word. He was one
[1:28:40] time going on on on to the temple and
[1:28:42] his people said, "Oh, we hear Peter is
[1:28:44] passing through jog road. Let's park my
[1:28:47] sick mom, my grandmother, my grandfather
[1:28:50] who hasn't working. I mean, walk for
[1:28:52] about maybe in about 20 years. Let's
[1:28:54] take him along the side because there
[1:28:55] were so much crowd you couldn't get
[1:28:57] Peter to pray for you. But let's just
[1:28:59] park him on the street stretches just in
[1:29:02] case his shadow will fall upon him
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; and his shadow was healing people. Do
[1:29:06] you think was Peter's shadow? No, it was
[1:29:08] the pillar of fire in him.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; It was a man Christ in him that was
[1:29:13] healing the people. He was only using
[1:29:16] Peter. Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So whatever you do is to the glory of
[1:29:19] the Lord.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; There was a story, let me bring this
[1:29:22] story. There was a story of a donkey.
[1:29:24] You remember the donkey that rode Jesus
[1:29:25] on h before he was crucified.
[1:29:30] And this donkey, the women were were
[1:29:31] putting their clothes and velvet and
[1:29:34] different expensive clothes for the for
[1:29:36] the donkey to ride on. And after the
[1:29:38] resurrection, the women would even say
[1:29:39] hello to the donkey. So this donkey was
[1:29:42] so upset and so sad. So one friend, one
[1:29:45] donkey friend was walking around and
[1:29:46] said, "My buddy, what why you so sad?
[1:29:48] What's what's going on with you?" Said,
[1:29:50] "Look, look at this woman. Look at
[1:29:51] Sister Tina." Two days ago, I was
[1:29:53] carrying Jesus majestically and Sister
[1:29:55] Tina put her clothes here and I saw
[1:29:57] Satina. She didn't even say good morning
[1:29:58] to me.
[1:30:01] Sister didn't say good morning to me.
[1:30:04] And his friend said, "So, so what's your
[1:30:05] problem?" Said, "But they don't even
[1:30:06] care about me. They don't remember me no
[1:30:08] more." He said, "Friend, it wasn't about
[1:30:10] you.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It was about Jesus." Amen.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; They put their clothes for because we
[1:30:14] carrying Jesus. Come on. Let's go get
[1:30:16] some grass and chew. Forget about get
[1:30:18] get behind yourself. Get beside
[1:30:20] yourself.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; So don't look at yourself as so
[1:30:24] important about the Christ in you.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; It's not your human flesh, but it's your
[1:30:30] Christ that makes the difference.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And so that's why we need to pack more
[1:30:34] Christ into us. The more Christ you pack
[1:30:35] into us, the more difference you can
[1:30:37] make in life.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:43] Don't I don't think this is a one day
[1:30:44] sermon. But let's see.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:30:48] yesterday, today, and forever more. They
[1:30:50] all time element. So, let's go to the
[1:30:52] next one. I created a a term called
[1:30:55] theomorphy. Theo means God or Elohim.
[1:30:59] Morphe and morphed himself in the flesh.
[1:31:02] That that's not in a message book that I
[1:31:04] don't think is in any dictionary. That's
[1:31:05] my own term that I use. God theomorph
[1:31:08] himself in us.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Wow. God putting himself in us so that
[1:31:12] to make you my sister Christ amen on
[1:31:15] earth. So that is a mix of the eternal
[1:31:17] and the temporal qualities personal of
[1:31:19] Christ in you. Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; That is the new birth. If you read 2
[1:31:24] Corinthians 5:1-4 said for we know that
[1:31:27] if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:31:29] which is what temporal
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; were dissolved we have a building of
[1:31:33] God. Not that we're going to have, but
[1:31:35] we do have a building of God and a house
[1:31:37] not made with hands eternal in the
[1:31:40] heavens. So your theophony
[1:31:42] was not even created because Elohim
[1:31:45] couldn't be created.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Your theophony was eternal.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; It didn't have any beginning.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It only begin on earth by manifesting in
[1:31:53] your flesh.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; But it does not have be it doesn't have
[1:31:55] any beginning. Neither would it end. So
[1:31:58] for in this uh in this flesh in other
[1:32:00] words in the temporal flesh we grown
[1:32:03] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:32:04] with our house which is from above.
[1:32:07] That's the new birth. If so be that
[1:32:09] let's let's keep okay. If so be that
[1:32:11] being clothed we shall not be found
[1:32:12] naked. For we that are in this
[1:32:14] tabernacle do grown being burdened not
[1:32:16] for that we will be unclothed but
[1:32:17] clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:32:20] swallowed up of life. That's eternal
[1:32:23] life will swallow the mortal life in
[1:32:25] you. Amen. Let's go to the next one. I
[1:32:29] think I'll show this one for display
[1:32:30] because of time sake. So you can read it
[1:32:33] later when you get back home. Let's go
[1:32:34] to the next slide. Just want to go
[1:32:36] through the slide. Eternal attributes of
[1:32:40] Elohim, Christ and Jesus the temper.
[1:32:42] Hebrews 145 7 and 8. Uh number four he
[1:32:47] said being he's talking about Christ. He
[1:32:48] said being made so much better than the
[1:32:51] angels. So now he's better than angels,
[1:32:54] as he has by inheritance obtained a more
[1:32:56] excellent name than thee. For unto which
[1:32:58] of the angels said he at any time, thou
[1:33:00] art my son, this day have I beg be
[1:33:02] begotten thee. And again I will be to
[1:33:04] him a father and he shall be to me a
[1:33:06] son. And of the angel said, who maketh
[1:33:09] his angel spirit and his ministers a
[1:33:11] flaming fire? But unto the son he said,
[1:33:14] thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever
[1:33:16] a skept of righteousness is the skept of
[1:33:19] thy kingdom. So now Christ is higher
[1:33:21] than the angels. Then just the next uh
[1:33:24] chapter Hebrews chapter 2:9 said, "But
[1:33:26] then we see Jesus who was made a little
[1:33:29] lower than the angels for the suffering
[1:33:31] of death crowned with glory and honor
[1:33:34] that by by the grace that he by the
[1:33:37] grace of God should taste death for
[1:33:39] every man." Now this person look take
[1:33:41] look at the equation. This one was
[1:33:43] higher than the angels, the almighty God
[1:33:45] as we read in Hebrews 1. But Hebrews 2,
[1:33:48] he now unfolding another attribute of a
[1:33:50] human being. So he's been made lower
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; till he become so human
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; till like on the cross. Even before the
[1:33:57] cross, he asked, he prayed to the
[1:33:59] father. The pill of fire. What is the
[1:34:01] father? Not the father in the clouds.
[1:34:03] There was no father in the clouds.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; But he was praying to the father in him.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Your father is in you. The holy ghost is
[1:34:08] in you.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; He said if you your world take this
[1:34:10] suffering from me. And he was so weak to
[1:34:14] angels. Theophan is Moses Elijah came to
[1:34:18] what? Minister to him, strengthen him.
[1:34:19] What is ministering? To strengthen him.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Said Lord go to Calvary for us. If you
[1:34:24] don't go for us, the whole creation is
[1:34:26] gone.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; So the Lord has now come out from his
[1:34:29] flesh and then be the Christ
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; and go and die for us.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was 100% human being.
[1:34:38] Jesus the Jesus part was 100% human
[1:34:40] being and the Christ part was 100%
[1:34:44] almighty God. Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I love the scripture.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; John 15 verse 17-19. The the 19 is my
[1:34:55] scripture. And I'll tell you why. 17
[1:34:57] said, "But Jesus answered them, my
[1:34:59] father worketh, he that too and I work."
[1:35:00] 18 Therefore the Jews sought sought them
[1:35:03] all to kill him because he not only had
[1:35:05] broken the Sabbath. You committed one
[1:35:07] sin and broken the Sabbath, but said
[1:35:10] also that God was was his father, making
[1:35:12] himself equal with God.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; For the Sabbath, we can let it slide by.
[1:35:20] But for you,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; we know your mother, we don't even know
[1:35:23] your father
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; and you call yourself the almighty God.
[1:35:26] No, no, no, no, no. You are destroying
[1:35:28] the law of Moses
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; for that. Abraham preaching a message,
[1:35:31] things that are to be. I was listening
[1:35:33] to it a couple of night ago. He said the
[1:35:35] Jews, they loved Jehovah. They loved
[1:35:37] their God. I'm just paraphrasing it.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; But then for Jehovah, who was the
[1:35:42] almighty God, came to Moses on the
[1:35:43] mountain, for him to come in the flesh,
[1:35:46] Emmanuel
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; and said that I am that I am.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; So that was a little bit too much for
[1:35:51] them.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; They couldn't take it
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; and they kill him.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And up to now they in blindness. I used
[1:35:57] to watch some shows that organized by a
[1:35:59] young a young lady h she bring Muslims,
[1:36:02] Christians, Jewish and they kind of have
[1:36:04] everybody talk about their faith and
[1:36:06] things and I saw one of them h the order
[1:36:08] of them talk about their faith came
[1:36:09] coming from Abraham coming from uh
[1:36:11] Jewish even the Muslim lady was saying
[1:36:13] that their religion come from Jews of
[1:36:15] course Christian and the Jewish they
[1:36:17] read the New Testament but Jesus never
[1:36:18] claimed to be God and the Christian lady
[1:36:20] yes he was God he said I am that I am he
[1:36:22] received worship and after that the
[1:36:24] Jewish lady was said I know one thing we
[1:36:26] love about you Christian is uh the way
[1:36:27] you know your scripture but our Jewish
[1:36:29] religion we don't we don't it doesn't
[1:36:31] teach us about heaven
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; we our life is on this earth we don't
[1:36:36] focus on heaven
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; we are god here
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; but heaven is not what we focus on it
[1:36:42] doesn't teach us that
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; and Muslims said that even Muhammad
[1:36:46] wasn't sure whether we go to heaven and
[1:36:49] most Christians said that then what is
[1:36:51] the religion what religion do you have
[1:36:52] that you are not even sure of eternal
[1:36:55] life
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; right So that to show you my brother, my
[1:36:57] sister,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; you've got a weapon. You've got a
[1:37:00] blessing.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you go through, you
[1:37:02] have been so blessed.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; It's not a you don't you not I don't see
[1:37:05] myself as a religious person, but I see
[1:37:07] myself as a Christ person.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Because religion is a man-made covering.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You can cover yourself as a sheep, but
[1:37:14] you can be a wolf in the in in the
[1:37:15] covering.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; So I don't want that covering. I don't
[1:37:18] want to be called a Christian. I want
[1:37:20] the Christ in me to display himself
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; if Christ is on the inside. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; You can call yourself all Christian you
[1:37:27] want. If Christ on on the inside is
[1:37:29] hypocrisy
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; you can't display nothing. You are
[1:37:32] rather going to display something
[1:37:33] negative. Amen. But when Christ on the
[1:37:36] inside when you make a mistake the
[1:37:38] Christ on the inside will correct you
[1:37:39] and bring you back to in line.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Glory. It doesn't mean Christian don't
[1:37:42] make mistakes. It doesn't mean if you
[1:37:44] are Christ you don't make mistake
[1:37:46] because we are on different order.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus didn't make mistake because
[1:37:49] he was on an order to save. But we are
[1:37:51] redeemed to be little saviors. But yes,
[1:37:54] we make mistake in this earth.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; When you have the Holy Ghost, you can
[1:37:57] never sin.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; But you can make a mistake.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And you make your mistake is accounted
[1:38:02] for in the atonement.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; God doesn't even see that mistake that
[1:38:06] you make.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Praise be to. You might see the mistake,
[1:38:09] but the pill of fire doesn't see the
[1:38:11] mistake.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Because he's got an atonement that has
[1:38:14] made propreation for your sin.
[1:38:16] Propiation for your sin. Where was that?
[1:38:19] Yeah. The next verse is what I love.
[1:38:20] Verse 19 said, "Then said, then answered
[1:38:22] Jesus and said, and said unto them, very
[1:38:26] verily I say unto you, the son can do
[1:38:28] nothing of himself, but whatsoever he
[1:38:31] seeth the father doeth, likewise doeth
[1:38:34] the son. This also doeth the son
[1:38:36] likewise."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; So, it's one of the scriptures that has
[1:38:39] blessed me in my ministry personally.
[1:38:42] And you know, when you look at your
[1:38:43] life, you can see some of the Bible
[1:38:45] characters that pertains to you. I look
[1:38:48] my life I can see my father the Lord
[1:38:50] Jesus Christ and how he led his life he
[1:38:53] wasn't rushing for nothing when the
[1:38:55] situation he know there's something in
[1:38:57] him so he goes on the inside for the
[1:39:01] father to speak and when the father
[1:39:03] speaks then he speaks likewise
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; and that will help you to calm your
[1:39:07] emotions
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; calm your mind calm this guy down
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; because when there's a situation this
[1:39:12] guy is going to go on rampage
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; doesn't know what to do
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and you can take the wrong action
[1:39:18] But if you can calm yourself, recollect
[1:39:19] yourself like Jesus
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; that I've got something on the inside.
[1:39:23] The problem is beyond my resources. I
[1:39:26] don't know how this going to be, whether
[1:39:27] it's sickness, whatever it is, but there
[1:39:30] somebody on the inside. And there's a
[1:39:32] purpose for this reason is for the glory
[1:39:34] of the Lord to be made known.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And then when you come on the inside,
[1:39:37] the man on the inside take preminence.
[1:39:41] And what you the flesh cannot do, cannot
[1:39:44] overcome, cannot surmount, the inner man
[1:39:47] will summon that problem for you.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And that was a scripture the Lord Jesus
[1:39:52] Christ used and brother used so much
[1:39:54] that in my ministry in my life, it helps
[1:39:57] me. It guides me that if I see the will
[1:39:59] of the Lord in something, I'm not
[1:40:01] worried about it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; I can go headlong into that situation.
[1:40:05] But if I don't see the Lord of the will
[1:40:06] of the Lord in my life, I'll stay far
[1:40:08] away as I can.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Because I don't I can go just trying to
[1:40:12] adventure into something I'm not sure
[1:40:14] of.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you one testimony. I
[1:40:18] went to Mexico. That was around 20 20
[1:40:20] 2014 2015 somewhere. And uh through a
[1:40:24] brother that the Lord raised from death,
[1:40:25] I got connected to the family. They sent
[1:40:27] me to another uh pastor in the city,
[1:40:29] Mterrey, one of the biggest industrial
[1:40:31] city. All the US companies are there.
[1:40:32] They make car. they don't have to pay
[1:40:34] taxes on it. So they all over there. So
[1:40:36] anyway, so this brothers, we were going
[1:40:38] to preach in a church. One brother who
[1:40:40] used to live in Canada, his older
[1:40:41] brother's church and the older brother
[1:40:43] doesn't speak, he didn't speak English.
[1:40:45] So the his brother, younger brother,
[1:40:47] he's called Hil, he was going to
[1:40:48] translate. So I was with his brother
[1:40:50] that the Lord raised from the dead and
[1:40:52] his two brothers. And I always like to
[1:40:54] when I travel, I like to have my
[1:40:56] passport with me. I have to have my
[1:40:57] laptop, my Bible, my wallet and things
[1:40:59] like that. So I say, "Okay, you guys sit
[1:41:01] in the front. I want to keep my my my
[1:41:03] staff at the back seat. I said, "No,
[1:41:05] brother, go to the front. We keep your
[1:41:07] stuff in the trunk and then we sit at
[1:41:09] the back." Okay. So, I was in the front
[1:41:11] and we arrived pay the driver in peso
[1:41:14] and then uh the driver left and said,
[1:41:16] "Okay, where where's the my bag?" said,
[1:41:19] "Oh, my brother, we left in the in the
[1:41:21] car." First I was thinking they were
[1:41:23] kidnapped
[1:41:29] a cab driver. I said brother Montter
[1:41:32] most of the cars are not registered and
[1:41:34] it's like Miami how you going to see all
[1:41:36] the cars are green car green cab who am
[1:41:39] I going to see there's no way he said
[1:41:42] brother it's also like a trophy for them
[1:41:44] you came from you're American when
[1:41:45] you're American tourist come so they
[1:41:47] want to rob you so if you left your
[1:41:49] passport laptop closed in the car that's
[1:41:51] a trophy so brother you might as well
[1:41:54] forget about it I don't the Bible I was
[1:41:57] going to preach from was gone
[1:41:59] My laptop gone, clothes gone, my
[1:42:03] passport to return back to the US gone.
[1:42:05] The only thing I had was my wallet and
[1:42:07] my cell phone. So we went enter into the
[1:42:09] church. And this Spanish brothers and
[1:42:11] sisters were praising the Lord. The
[1:42:12] anointing was so strong. And I had two
[1:42:15] option. One option is to be sad and
[1:42:18] think about how to come to us and maybe
[1:42:20] cancel the preaching. Brother, I can't
[1:42:21] preach. My passport is gone and you know
[1:42:24] I'm sad. You have to pre preach to me. I
[1:42:26] had that option.
[1:42:29] I'm broken. I don't know how I'm going
[1:42:31] to go back to US. Maybe I'm going to be
[1:42:33] a Mexican. I don't know. So,
[1:42:37] so or I need to probably look for the
[1:42:39] the nearest US consulate and go and I
[1:42:42] mean send some petition to get a I don't
[1:42:43] know some means to go back. So, that was
[1:42:45] one option. And then opt the next option
[1:42:47] was we are together again.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord.
[1:42:55] We are together again
[1:42:59] in one accord.
[1:43:02] Something good is about to happen.
[1:43:06] Something good is in stock. We are
[1:43:09] together again
[1:43:13] just praising the Lord.
[1:43:16] So I had those two option
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and I chose the latter. I say you know
[1:43:20] what I'm here to preach.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; I can get a Spanish Bible. They can read
[1:43:24] a quotation for me. I don't even care.
[1:43:26] I'm here to praise and I just jump into
[1:43:28] the praises dancing and rejoicing with
[1:43:30] the brothers and sisters.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And I prayed a prayer in my heart. I
[1:43:33] said, "Lord, let it be like Walans. The
[1:43:35] driver even if he's a good person would
[1:43:36] even know that my staff at the trunk
[1:43:38] unless maybe get another passenger who
[1:43:40] has staff. So even if he's a good
[1:43:42] person, there's no way like unless Lord
[1:43:46] you do something." So I I said brother
[1:43:48] Lord as you did for brother Walans in
[1:43:50] Abraham's time when his car was stolen
[1:43:53] and Abraham and the breed and return let
[1:43:55] the brother let his driver know even if
[1:43:57] he doesn't know let him go to the trunk
[1:43:59] and see them bring it touch his side to
[1:44:00] bring it to me and so I prayed and I was
[1:44:02] just rejoicing and dancing with the
[1:44:04] anointing was so great and having a good
[1:44:06] time I didn't even care about it and the
[1:44:08] pastor came the brother went to tell his
[1:44:09] brother Quu's clothes passport uh Bible
[1:44:13] it's all gone so the pastor came and
[1:44:16] it's called Brother Fredo, he came and
[1:44:17] he took a chair that Armano is here,
[1:44:18] brother is here to preach for us. But
[1:44:20] then everything in beside his wallet is
[1:44:22] is was left in the car. Brother Israel
[1:44:25] left in the car. So he prayed the same
[1:44:27] prayer that he pray he didn't speak
[1:44:30] English but he prayed in Spanish that
[1:44:31] Lord as you let you did for you did for
[1:44:34] brother watch and you let all his
[1:44:36] clothes beside the gas that he lost a
[1:44:38] little bit let everything return to
[1:44:40] brother. And as I was in the prayer I
[1:44:42] saw a vision of green taxi,
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; right? I was there my eyes were closed
[1:44:46] and just green tassic came to my eyes
[1:44:48] and I saw somebody tapping my I think my
[1:44:50] my left shoulder I open my eyes and it
[1:44:52] was a dickin he said mano the cab driver
[1:44:55] is here and he spoke his said he said he
[1:44:57] doesn't want to give it to us he want to
[1:44:58] give the ch they call black people
[1:45:00] chocolateito or degito negro so they
[1:45:03] want
[1:45:08] I was close but I wasn't I I didn't mean
[1:45:10] to say
[1:45:15] Come on.
[1:45:26] Praise the Lord. Is it un unless I see
[1:45:28] the negto I'm not going to give it to
[1:45:30] you guy because he doesn't trust Mexico.
[1:45:32] You can't trust anybody. If I give it to
[1:45:34] you the negto will not get his stuff. So
[1:45:36] I want to see the black guy and give his
[1:45:38] stuff to him.
[1:45:40] So I went outside and I said my brother
[1:45:45] I don't know how how to thank you said
[1:45:46] he was even apologized that he was so
[1:45:48] sorry because he drove far away before
[1:45:50] he realized so he was speeding cutting
[1:45:53] uh vehicles on the way because he was
[1:45:55] thinking maybe I'll be going somewhere
[1:45:56] to preach so he wanted to reach get me
[1:45:58] before I I go to another place
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; who did that
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; JESUS
[1:46:13] WHO T THIS MEXICAN DRIVER'S HEART when
[1:46:16] my staff was a trophy for him. He didn't
[1:46:18] steal it. You left in a car. It's my
[1:46:21] trophy. It's a It's a blessing from the
[1:46:23] Lord.
[1:46:26] If he was a Catholic, you go to mass and
[1:46:28] thank God for it. Thank thank God for
[1:46:30] it. But God touches her to bring it. And
[1:46:32] I said, "My brother,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; if I don't see you here, I'll see you on
[1:46:35] the other side." I gave him all the
[1:46:36] money that I had.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And I said, "If you want come and listen
[1:46:39] to the word of the Lord." And he said,
[1:46:40] "I have an appointment." I said, "Okay,
[1:46:42] don't worry. I'll see you at the other
[1:46:43] side. For what you've done for me, I
[1:46:45] give you eternal life.
[1:47:05] You've got the power to give life
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; because you are Christ. Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; The power of life
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; and the power of death
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; is in your tongue.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And your tongue is the tongue of Jesus
[1:47:19] Christ.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And you've got a choice to give whatever
[1:47:22] you want. Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; And I believe you and I will choose to
[1:47:25] give life.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Even those who don't who don't deserve
[1:47:30] it, we give them life.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You believe for them. Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Regardless of their condition,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; you believe and put them in the kingdom
[1:47:38] of God.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You intercede on their behalf.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; And you will see them. Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Bless.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I wasn't envisaging to see sister Dixon
[1:47:49] here. And here she is. Sister Dixon.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I was praying for her, believing for
[1:47:54] her. I didn't know the Lord was going to
[1:47:56] bring. I was thinking like I wish like
[1:47:58] by Christmas she's here
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; and here she is. She's sitting right
[1:48:01] there.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Verse. Let's go to the next verse. I
[1:48:12] think I'll wrap up quickly with time.
[1:48:14] Matthew 22:23. You can read a scripture.
[1:48:17] But this was people came to ask Jesus
[1:48:19] about seven brothers that married uh
[1:48:21] sorry. Yeah. Seven brothers that married
[1:48:22] sister. The oldest married a lady. There
[1:48:25] was no issue. There was no children in
[1:48:26] the in the in the in the in the marriage
[1:48:29] he died to the seven. So they came to
[1:48:31] ask Jesus Lord when on the other side or
[1:48:34] in heaven in glory whose wife is going
[1:48:36] to be because all the seven brothers
[1:48:38] married to this sing this lady. So is it
[1:48:40] going to be the first, the second, the
[1:48:42] seventh? Who? The Lord said that, "Oh,
[1:48:44] you of little knowledge." I'm just
[1:48:46] paraphrasing it.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that in the resurrection
[1:48:50] we never give marriage,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; not given in marriage because it's a
[1:48:54] marriage is timely affair.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; It's second and third dimensional.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; It's a sixth dimensional attribute, but
[1:49:01] it manifest only in this time.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; So you don't go marry on the other side.
[1:49:06] No,
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; you don't go have children on the other
[1:49:08] side in the natural. Right?
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the hormones in the body when
[1:49:11] you move to the tufani doesn't have
[1:49:13] hormones.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't operate by estrogen and and
[1:49:17] progesterone and testosterone.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Those hormones are not there.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; There's another element that is a pillar
[1:49:23] of fire. The Holy Ghost
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; and that pillar of fire doesn't have
[1:49:26] those instinct to raise children. So we
[1:49:28] raise our children here. But on that
[1:49:29] side we don't raise children.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And he said Jesus said that I am the God
[1:49:36] of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob.
[1:49:39] God is not God of the dead but of the
[1:49:42] living.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; So on the other side there's nothing
[1:49:44] like death.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Death is an earthly h temporal attribute
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't have a place on the other
[1:49:50] side.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly to the next slide.
[1:49:57] Oh my. That's the quotes.
[1:50:01] Okay. When their eyes were open, they
[1:50:03] knew him. That is 64.
[1:50:06] Okay, I think you can read these quotes
[1:50:08] later on. Let's go to the next quotes.
[1:50:12] This code is talking about drinking. So,
[1:50:14] you have whatever you need, you drink
[1:50:17] it, right? Let's go to the next quotes
[1:50:19] because for the sake of time,
[1:50:24] let's see. Let's go to the next quotes.
[1:50:27] Okay, let me read these quotes. He said
[1:50:29] uh you are planted in Christ. Uh let me
[1:50:32] see. Said we will see Jesus 64. You are
[1:50:34] planted in Christ. What am I reading?
[1:50:37] Okay. You are planted in Christ the in
[1:50:39] inexhaustible fountain of life. So
[1:50:42] paragraph three. So there I think Christ
[1:50:44] is the inexhaustible fountain of life.
[1:50:46] And when we are planted in him, all we
[1:50:48] need to do is to drink from the fountain
[1:50:50] of life and push out everything that we
[1:50:52] have need of in this journey. All the
[1:50:55] things that we have need of is in him
[1:50:58] and we are planted in him and draw from
[1:51:01] him. He's the in inexhaustible fountain
[1:51:04] of life. Amen. Let me go back and read
[1:51:06] one of the quotes. Let's go back to
[1:51:10] let me see the next the next one on top.
[1:51:12] Perfect. Uh let's see. Jovajyra he said
[1:51:16] you you you people in Tennessee I don't
[1:51:18] know if anybody come from Tennessee are
[1:51:19] known for your apples pineapples orchard
[1:51:22] and peach orchards and around Georgia
[1:51:25] and different places you your fine fruit
[1:51:27] down there in the south I want to ask
[1:51:28] you something did you know that when you
[1:51:30] see the little peach musicians please
[1:51:33] come up here when you when you see the
[1:51:36] little peach
[1:51:38] right where was I okay when you see the
[1:51:42] little peach okay let me paraphrase you
[1:51:44] you take off your children would take
[1:51:46] off of your grandchildren would take off
[1:51:48] do you know that every bushel of peaches
[1:51:50] is in there when just just little little
[1:51:53] bitty tiny thing
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; right isn't isn't it there where does
[1:51:57] come from if it's not there where does
[1:51:58] it come from where's them peaches come
[1:52:00] from who puts them on the tree how did
[1:52:03] they ever get there you just set a
[1:52:05] little slip out and then you water it
[1:52:07] and drink from the earth it drinks from
[1:52:09] the earth and it's got to drink more
[1:52:11] than its portion that's the lesson the
[1:52:13] cue I want us to take. We need to drink
[1:52:15] more revelation.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to drink something that
[1:52:17] like I've never seen this before, but is
[1:52:20] the word of the Lord. Drink it.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It's going to give you strength. It
[1:52:23] drinks. It drinks and drinks till it
[1:52:25] just can't drink no more. Then he pushes
[1:52:27] out limbs. Then it drinks some more and
[1:52:30] pushes out leaves. Then it drinks some
[1:52:32] more and pushes out blossoms. Then it
[1:52:34] drinks some more and pushes out peaches.
[1:52:36] Then it drinks some more and pushes out
[1:52:38] more peaches. It keeps drinking and
[1:52:40] pushing out. You see what I mean? 15.
[1:52:42] And now that's the way with the
[1:52:44] Christianity. When a man or a woman or a
[1:52:46] child of a child is born of the spirit
[1:52:48] of God, then every then every everything
[1:52:52] you need of is in this world and the
[1:52:54] world to come is given to you.
[1:52:57] When you born a baby, everything you
[1:52:59] ever need, your wife, your husband, your
[1:53:02] grandchildren, your money, your millions
[1:53:04] of dollars. If you want billions,
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; cuz this millions even don't worth
[1:53:07] nothing.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; So you might as well ask for billions
[1:53:10] and trillions.
[1:53:16] Because
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; because the dollar 20 years ago is not
[1:53:18] the same. The value is different.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; So don't think if you ask millions
[1:53:24] you're asking too much.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Ask more.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Bank of heaven doesn't go bankrupt.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; And so then everything you need of is in
[1:53:34] this is is in you when you receive the
[1:53:36] Holy Spirit and you are planted in
[1:53:38] Christ. And to my estim to my estimation
[1:53:41] of Christ, he is the inexhustable
[1:53:42] fountain of life. And you drink and push
[1:53:45] out for everything that you have need of
[1:53:46] is in him. The only thing you have to do
[1:53:48] is to get thirsty and go drinking, go to
[1:53:51] drinking and it will produce just
[1:53:53] exactly what the seed is. It's a
[1:53:54] promise. God promised to it. God is
[1:53:57] obligated and you do it. And the last
[1:53:59] slide, the last slide is what is I like
[1:54:02] to whatever I preach. I want in a
[1:54:04] practical experience. How do we apply
[1:54:05] this?
[1:54:07] When you can differentiate between the
[1:54:08] temporal things and the eternal
[1:54:10] dimension, it helps your own Christian
[1:54:13] life. It gives you the inner peace and
[1:54:15] calm and deep satisfaction in your heart
[1:54:18] in your personal walk with God because
[1:54:19] you know that there's a being on the
[1:54:21] inside that whatever happens to you,
[1:54:23] he's in control. It helps you to
[1:54:25] understand your personal scriptures. I
[1:54:27] have my scriptures. When I see the
[1:54:28] scriptures, yes, it's Esther, but that's
[1:54:30] that's Mu. Yes, I see John, but that's
[1:54:32] me.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; I see Matthew, but it's for me.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I see Revelation, but it's for me. and
[1:54:36] you walk that scripture because it's
[1:54:38] your scripture. Amen.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; And so you understand your life then
[1:54:42] avoid misplacement. But say especially
[1:54:44] we the preachers said avoid
[1:54:46] misplacement, displacement and
[1:54:47] misallocation of scriptures. Cuz if you
[1:54:49] don't know the scriptures going to
[1:54:50] you're going to feel like oh Lord why
[1:54:51] don't you take this my flesh to the
[1:54:53] other side. It can never go there. You
[1:54:55] got to drop it here.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; So you can't you can't h you can't major
[1:55:00] on on the minor.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; This flesh is minor. You can't major on
[1:55:03] it. It also help you to overcome
[1:55:04] obstacles. win the victories that we
[1:55:06] need in life through Christ the third
[1:55:08] pool cuz certain things are not going to
[1:55:09] come easy. You're going to have blocks,
[1:55:12] concrete, not physical concrete,
[1:55:14] obstacles in your way that you need to
[1:55:16] push through to the other side and what
[1:55:18] is in you has to come out. The third
[1:55:20] pool is already in you. The third pool
[1:55:22] is not in heaven, it's in you because
[1:55:24] heaven is in you. Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; We also need spiritual growth, maturity,
[1:55:28] sensitivity, sensitiv sensitivity of the
[1:55:31] spirit and operations of gifts and
[1:55:32] talents in our lives, families,
[1:55:34] ministries, businesses. And it helps you
[1:55:36] to help others in their calling.
[1:55:38] Ministers, mothers, fathers and many
[1:55:40] other areas of light and also spiritual
[1:55:42] blessing. There are certain things that
[1:55:44] we read in the messages, Bible, we don't
[1:55:45] understand. But when God gives you that
[1:55:47] discernment, you can differentiate
[1:55:49] between the new birth, godhead, coming
[1:55:51] of the Lord, millennium, theophony,
[1:55:53] rapture, heaven, new heaven and new
[1:55:55] earth, new Jerusalem. It's just one
[1:55:57] thing is Christ. God bless you. Let's be
[1:56:00] on our feet.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Let's share a word of prayer. Our Lord
[1:56:08] and father, we thank you for this day
[1:56:10] where you've brought us. Father, we give
[1:56:11] all the glory for to your name. have
[1:56:13] your permanence. Bless each and every
[1:56:15] one of us. Father, continue to deal with
[1:56:17] our hearts, our minds. Bless our
[1:56:20] brothers and sisters all around those
[1:56:21] who couldn't make it. Father, Lord, have
[1:56:24] your control and give us a wonderful
[1:56:25] week in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:56:27] Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:56:36] God bless you.
[1:56:43] Praise the Lord. How many appreciate the
[1:56:46] word of God on today
[1:56:54] you know um just
[1:56:58] and I know we we were brother Quaker was
[1:57:01] just kind of concerned about time and
[1:57:03] all of that but I I can't wait for us to
[1:57:06] not have to worry about that.
[1:57:08] That was a real good thought.
[1:57:12] And um you know just just you know as as
[1:57:16] he was going through he was talking
[1:57:17] about the story of Esther and how um if
[1:57:21] you ever found yourself in a similar
[1:57:23] situation that you could stand on a
[1:57:25] scripture like that and expect God to
[1:57:28] move in your life uh the way that he
[1:57:30] moved her. But when you look at
[1:57:32] something that happened with Esther like
[1:57:33] that that would have been more of a
[1:57:35] temporal situation
[1:57:38] right? But uh but the way he was
[1:57:39] bringing out, you know, how we got these
[1:57:43] eternal scriptures, when you see
[1:57:44] something that talk about this happened
[1:57:45] before the foundation of the world, you
[1:57:48] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:57:51] world. That ought to just kind of give
[1:57:53] you a peace that there ain't one thing
[1:57:55] the devil can do
[1:57:57] to get you uprooted out of Christ.
[1:58:00] Brother, brother Tro was sharing it on
[1:58:02] last week and how, you know, he was he
[1:58:04] he found himself out there, but uh but
[1:58:07] he said the the shepherd had to come and
[1:58:09] break the bones
[1:58:11] because he was an eternal thought of
[1:58:13] God.
[1:58:15] And and I'm I'm so glad that God told
[1:58:17] us, here's another eternal scripture.
[1:58:19] All that the father has given me
[1:58:24] will come.
[1:58:27] And man, look, we might as well start
[1:58:30] rejoicing now.
[1:58:33] We We ain't got to wait for something to
[1:58:35] happen. We got eternal thoughts that are
[1:58:39] centered around these things.
[1:58:41] Praise God.
[1:58:44] I tell you, I'm I'm I I'm I'm glad I
[1:58:47] came to church today. I I I feel like I
[1:58:50] went to church, that I went to the house
[1:58:52] of God.
[1:58:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:59] AND I AND I love how he brought that
[1:59:01] that
[1:59:03] testimony in of um the the gentleman
[1:59:07] that I mean all of his stuff gone. Y'all
[1:59:09] y'all if y'all never been overseas
[1:59:12] and uh and you passport is something
[1:59:14] that you just do not
[1:59:17] you never let that out of your sight.
[1:59:20] Keep a passport on you
[1:59:23] and I put it in a front pocket, back
[1:59:26] pocket. Somebody might rip it right out
[1:59:27] of there, but keep it in a front pocket.
[1:59:30] But you never let no passport get away
[1:59:32] from you. Computer, passport, everything
[1:59:35] that the that was important to this
[1:59:36] brother is gone. It reminded me of what
[1:59:40] we've been talking about on Wednesday
[1:59:42] nights and how God will restore these
[1:59:45] things to you. Just just like just like
[1:59:47] Saul was just trying to go back and get
[1:59:49] the donkeys, God gave him them donkeys
[1:59:52] back,
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; right? Plus also anointed him to be
[1:59:55] king, right? But but a as and God
[1:59:59] brought his passport, his computer, all
[2:00:01] that just touched the man's heart to
[2:00:02] bring it. And as soon as brother Quu
[2:00:05] said it, in my mind, immediately I said,
[2:00:09] I don't know what that man's condition
[2:00:10] is. I don't know what his his his
[2:00:13] spiritual status is, but I do know this
[2:00:16] much. That man will be on the other side
[2:00:20] because of what he did for a son of God.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Quu say, "Brother, I I I
[2:00:27] give you life." Now, you got to
[2:00:28] understand, we have that type of
[2:00:30] authority
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said
[2:00:35] Jesus told us, right? He he he he says
[2:00:40] um uh whosoever sins you remit
[2:00:44] they are remitted and whosoever sins you
[2:00:47] retain they are retained. So therefore
[2:00:51] we have this authority we have this this
[2:00:53] power on the inside that we can give
[2:00:56] life to others. We sometimes we just
[2:00:58] don't recognize who we are.
[2:01:01] And and you did y'all catch all that? We
[2:01:04] we we had to come here and have this
[2:01:07] this this this earthly experience.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; What is pain? You'll find out.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; What is death? You'll find out.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; What? WHAT IS IT TO HAVE THIS ONE
[2:01:23] talking about you and saying this about?
[2:01:25] You'll find out.
[2:01:29] And then then turn around when you go
[2:01:30] through stuff like that, then you got to
[2:01:32] respond like Jesus.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Then you'll find out what it means to be
[2:01:39] like Jesus.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; You'll never know those things until you
[2:01:43] go through something.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying go to something. No, go
[2:01:48] through something.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I I'm blessed, church.
[2:01:53] I'm blessed. I'm I'm blessed.
[2:01:57] I'm blessed,
[2:02:00] man.
[2:02:02] I'mma tell y'all and y I told y'all I
[2:02:04] asked you earlier, do we see restoration
[2:02:06] around us? It's all around us. But you
[2:02:10] know, one of the other promises that was
[2:02:12] there in Joel,
[2:02:15] it said you going to eat
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; in plenty.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And then it didn't just stop there.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; It say you going to be
[2:02:26] Are y'all satisfied?
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; My God. I'M TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUALLY
[2:02:35] SATISFIED.
[2:02:39] And God been bringing us sermon after
[2:02:41] sermon after sermon. I I tell you, I you
[2:02:45] you just wonder what else can God do? I
[2:02:49] can tell you this much. You got It's
[2:02:50] more where that came from.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; It's more where that came from. I'm I'm
[2:02:55] excited, church. I am. I'm I'm just
[2:02:58] really excited. I just feel like there's
[2:03:00] a shift. There's a change. There's
[2:03:01] something happening, you know, all
[2:03:03] around us. And we just want to be ready
[2:03:05] for what God got in store. Thank God for
[2:03:09] the word of the Lord on today.
[2:03:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let us
[2:03:20] have a word of prayer. Amen. Father,
[2:03:25] we are grateful for
[2:03:28] um what we heard. Thank you for the way
[2:03:32] that you have been speaking through uh
[2:03:35] all of the ministers. Father, bringing
[2:03:38] them um fresh mana from heaven that the
[2:03:43] people can Lord just bathe in and
[2:03:46] rejoice in and and feed on. something
[2:03:49] that that that uh gives us spiritual
[2:03:52] strength, helps us realize who we are in
[2:03:56] you. That God, when we recognize these
[2:03:58] things, it it brings a settling to our
[2:04:01] spirits. We're not looking at our
[2:04:04] troubles and trials and tribulations
[2:04:06] because those things are temporal. And
[2:04:08] as as one said, these things came
[2:04:11] actually to pass. They're not here to
[2:04:14] stay, but they're here to pass. So Lord,
[2:04:17] we trust that oh God, you'll give us
[2:04:18] strength to just keep walking by faith
[2:04:20] and not by sight. Every promise that you
[2:04:23] have spoken to us is yay and amen. And
[2:04:25] not one word that came out of your mouth
[2:04:28] is going to return void to you. Thank
[2:04:30] you, Lord, that we even heard a little
[2:04:33] earlier this morning that no weapon that
[2:04:34] is formed against us will prosper and
[2:04:37] every tongue that rises against us will
[2:04:39] be condemned. Thank you for these
[2:04:42] promises that you surround us with, oh
[2:04:44] God. Lord, help us to hear your voice.
[2:04:47] We ask, oh God, that you would just be
[2:04:48] with us as we prepare to leave this
[2:04:51] place, but not uh your presence. May you
[2:04:53] get glory and honor, Lord, out of all
[2:04:56] that we do. It's in Jesus' name we pray.
[2:04:59] Amen. Before we leave, uh I did want to
[2:05:02] make mention there's a card there on the
[2:05:04] back table that we wanted you all to
[2:05:07] fill out. We brought it here and we want
[2:05:09] you to fill it out. So, as you're
[2:05:10] exiting today, if you don't mind just
[2:05:12] taking some time to fill out that card,
[2:05:15] uh we greatly appreciate it. Amen. As
[2:05:18] the brothers come,
[2:05:20] you all
[2:05:23] the glory
[2:05:27] be
[2:05:36] Heat.
[2:05:52] Heat.
[2:05:59] Heat
[2:06:08] up here.
