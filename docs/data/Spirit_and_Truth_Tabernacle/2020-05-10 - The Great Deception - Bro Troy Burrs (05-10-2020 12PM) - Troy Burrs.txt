just wanted to offer word of prayer for the family there in South Carolina and there was a family and her husband had been in a coma for I want to say a couple weeks he and his wife both contracted the corona virus and the wife had passed away in and they were waiting for the husband to come out of the coma before they would actually have her service so they were just holding her until he came out but he never came out of the coma he actually went home to be with the Lord as well and the church had the funeral there for both the husband and wife and I just want to say Church we there's so so much going on in our world about this this virus where did it come from how did it get here you know what is this all about and now there's so many videos going on around the world people said listen people saying that and I want you to always just be very careful with the information that you receive oftentimes the information we receive is not verified by anybody and we're just taking it we just run with it and often terms if you're not aware but people can edit videos and make the videos say whatever they wanted to say and we take off just running with it the only source that we can trust is the Word of God amen it does not change so so before you just send up videos and send this out just just be careful sometimes it just all it does just just bring fear and all these other things the one thing we do know is that this is serious people's lives are impacted by it we don't know how it got here we don't know you know all of that but we trust that God will just keep us amen at a time like this and and and there are people Saints these are sinks that are being affected by so won't offer prayer amen for them and you know I think when when you see people that you know passing away you have a little bit more grace just you know stop saying things like if you wanted a blood if you if you had simulant you don't know we don't know we don't know nothing right and and all we know is that we're people that are impacted by something that has happened here on our earth so we pray for God's divine protection we pray for His mercy we pray for his grace and we pray that we continue to love one another in the midst of all it is so amen let's just have a word of Prayer for this family and this church is well amen there in South Carolina God knows them we'll just lift him My Father we just come before your presence Lord on behalf of this family this husband and wife that is going on with you some children are left behind wondering what they're going to do without their parents God a church has lost a tremendous faithful couple that it's been an amiss for years and God they need your direction they need your help so God we lift them up at this moment that you bring strength we understand that there might be some others in the church that's ineffective by this of God we just want to lift up that entire church because she'll be a fence a protection Lord stay the hand of the enemy God even in the midst of of Israel a plague struck but father there was something done that the hand of the enemy was stayed and God would just pray that he was state of hands of the enemy and Lord that the blood of Christ would be applied to each and every one and Lord that the death angel would pass and God that the rest would be spirit there's others Lord that we have heard about an overpass that just wasn't feeling well for 4 weeks and and God just didn't know what was going on and understand that his wife had to go to the hospital she was tested and and Lord they said it was positive for her and God just so many going through different things this this is real we don't know where it came from but we know it's a spirit from hell and we rebuke it now in the name of Jesus Lord and the Saints God Lord any time a symptom would come against one of these Saints we're rebuking the symptom right now in the name of Jesus and we prayed it to be a hedge of protection over each and every one God that you would just keep us and Father that you bring us through this season many are preparing to go back to work they don't know what they're gonna face when they get there on the job but be there protection or God has on previous shield around each one of God and just keep them during this time we know it was Satan's it's Satan's desire but still kill and destroy but God you said you came that we might have life and we might have it abundantly so Lord we pray that you bless us and that you would keep us some jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord God bless you you can be seated in the presence of the Lord a man just got a few announcements to make and as we were preparing to make those announcements last week I believe sister Cherise had a song for us I hope she brought it this week with her a man but but let me just give the announcements first happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers a man will wish you all a very happy Mother's Day again thank God for you thank God we appreciate you and it meant just thank God for allowing you to see another Mother's Day as you all are aware things are starting to change here I believe there would be many that will be starting to go back to work on tomorrow and which is which is wonderful and it's something I've already started they're trying to phase us back into our normal routine and we're certainly grateful for all of that but what we are trying to do is just monitor everything before we just jump back into what we were doing here let's just kind of mileage the things we'll take things quite slow and but so for now we want to continue the way that we have been doing service we don't want to jump in too fast so just just bear with us there but this week we'll still do the virtual service a man on periscope and also on Facebook you can watch on Wednesday night and then our Sunday services will be virtual 9 a.m. and 12:00 but will also continue our two groups the 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. group so and those that are watching virtually they can watch either periscope of Facebook Friday night so we won't have service a man right now will continue just a Wednesday and and the Sunday also just wanting to quickly make mention we are in the price of migrating from our church app that we have on our telephones or many of you all have the the app the company that we were using the app they were called my church at but they actually sold to the church app another company and and we are in the process of having to migrate off of my church app platform to the church app platform so I want to encourage everyone if you would on your phone just download the new app it's called the church app when you go to your App Store just look for the church app and you'll find spirit and truth Tabernacle you just put that in and then you'll see the new app you can just start getting acclimated to it we would love to get feedback from you if you see something that's not working or you know just anything just give us some feedback and we want to make sure that everybody has a comfortable experience as they move forward to the new app so what think we put a number of things there pretty much everything that was in the old app should be in the new app and if it's not there we aren't getting that over there for you and just just very grateful brother Quinton has been doing an excellent job of getting everything over so you always see a lot of his work there when you download it and we thank God for brother Quentin amen and all the work that he's done to make that happen so keep that in mind a man just started making for maybe your earliest convenience just get the church app on your phone so once you once we make the switchover you won't be left a man on the old platform as we pray we are giving this again just want to make mention that we do have the ability to give online we have two platforms we have PayPal we have cash app is a lot easier and cash app to give there are no fees there so if you do have cash yet we would encourage you to use that because there are no fees with PayPal you have to doing a very specific weight otherwise they will charge fees a man in the giving and we prefer not to give paypal the fees you know so if you want to give the cash out to use a man the church of symbol of at I mean a cash out spirit and truth tea spirit and truth tea for spirit of tabernacle if you are using PayPal we accident you can just you would use the option to send to a friend or family member if you choose that option the then you can donate with the email address of giving at John 4 to 3 0 RG giving at John 4 to 3 that orgy and you can give your tithing offering through there we certainly thank God that even in the midst of this pandemic God has sustained a man God has sustained these sustained his people and he has sustained his church amen he really is a good father he really is a good mean he's a he know how to take care of us a man he

both sides blessing a man am i truly love them both amen my precious wife a man I was like that thinking I say though I was thinking of myself I say she mothered some free the most stubborn keys but but now they actually pretty good kid it's just going through some girl in pain we all went through some growing pain a man I'm not gonna hold you keep you standing let's go straight those are the words so you can take your seats a man take a reading from Jeremiah the eighth chapter you know start reading from the fourth verse to reduce that enamelled you can take your seats hey man it's just really good to see everybody Jeremiah eighth chapter of getting the fourth verses moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return when then is this people of Jerusalem Sladen back by a perpetual backsliding they hope as deceit they refuse to return I hearken and heard but they spake not all right no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have I done everyone turned to his course as the horse rushes into battle let's go to Jeremiah the ninth chapter we're gonna read the fifth in the sixth verse Jeremiah the fifth and the sixth verse and they will deceive everyone his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongues to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity van inhabitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me thus saith the Lord a man you may take your seats amen this morning a man I take a title of his message the great deception the great deception and we see how we know that Satan he he's a he's a slick fellow he is the master of deception I mean he knows just how to do it he's been doing it since the beginning amen we see that through the land now this great danger called a Kovac that's passing through and and everybody is on the front of their minds and right now is the the thing that we're going through amen but I think that there is a greater virus a man that's passing through the land and it's called deception a man a lack of understanding amen a rejection of the word amen the deception of this hour that we're living in they met people go on to and fro seeking knowledge but never coming into the knowledge of the truth amen and because of this great deception a man even a man persecution is in an endurable if is if it is understandable I'm gonna say that again even persecution isn't durable if it is understanding amen but the people of the world today in the midst of deceit because they refuse a man to know the Lord by the mess that he sit in this last day a man can find no comfort right they men right they can find no comfort amen the Bible says in Amos the eighth chapter in 11 verse behold the days to come saith the Lord God says that I will send a famine in the land they made not a famine for bread nor a thirst for water right got a famine for hearing the word of the Lord that's right amen they shall wandered from sea to sea and from the North even to the east and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it Amen this is the virus a man or the disease that's being spread Amen amongst the people in this last day it's called deception amen and this virus was put out too many years ago yes amen and it's traveled all through time yes Amen deceiving people to worship another god right amen and such a the Bible says here Daniel 11th chapter xxxii verse and such as to wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flattery but the people that do know their God shall do exploits and we see that in this day and time that so many are deceived by flatteries you can say to a person just have some sweet birds some nice words give a compliment or two yeah a men and you can you know suck them right into your whale we see the smooth talkers of this date of politicians and whoremongers false preachers amen the different was they are smooth talkers amen but their words are full of lies any man they come with flatteries they come they come a man with an agenda they meant to get you to believe and they decorate this lie and circle it around truth all right any man so we see where the spirit began in Genesis the Bible says that the serpent was the most subtle beast of the field he's the original slickster yes amen the Lord he said Genesis the third chapter said now the sermon was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God in me and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden right and the one was said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat neither shall ye touch it lest you die right now that's what the word says and the surface handle to the woman you shall not surely die for God do us no amen that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened all right and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil yes and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and that the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did now I want you to notice there that the deception that in this in the story here that the deception came with the strong visual factor connected to it she see it says there that she saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant amen to the eyes good let me tell you something my brothers and sisters everything that look good ain't good I find a lot of times in nature the most colorful and prettiest creature the little bud has all of a bright yellows and the bright reds and the pretty colors stay away from number boys those are the most deadly amen out there they have a snake a man that's got the most prettiest red in black and yellow yeah one of the most poisonous little snakes around I think the story goes as red touch black you and okay jack but if red touch yelling you would dead fella all right my model will be all are you trying to wait to look at the red I didn't wait for all over tree them real and one of them is dead man that way I feel make no mistake I stay away from all of them but as we notice not as a strong attachment to the seat with our visual acuity it's all decorated nice and it's got the pretty colors with images hey man we just go for that all right weather in the beach there is a person personal deception a man is something that looks pleasant to the eye but underneath it's poisonous because mostly things that look closer to the eye we're talking world of things now ah hiding death amen heartache sorrow just beneath the surface and I stay with me I'm just building a platform right now we never get somewhere and it goes only Genesis dance says in the tree to be desired to make one wise so Eve not only she did she have a made an attraction through her eyes Amen now she she she began to lust for knowledge man she said well wait a minute now I gotta I got one up on that I can I can I just take this and I got some I can go back and tell you look what I did oh maybe don't doubt she thought that old man I'm proud of ya I'm glad you did see ma'am try not to get ahead of myself but get off my god she stepped out of her place she stepped out of her place we're gonna go into that a little bit more she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband to eat now after she ate the fruit she began to spread her newfound deception she began to spread it amen under ception of knowledge with others this is a pattern of how deception of death spread like a virus from one person to another right amen one person received false doctrine one person is deceived by one and then they go recruit somebody else person is deceit and it spreads like wildfire so it is a spirit a demonic spirit of deception that unknowingly they have taken now to call this spirit about what she was looking at yes but what she received she saw that it was good she was lusting with her eyes and took all the demonic spirits right that became contagious and she went to spread it amen stay with me and we know a man that the way God makes something let me back up I want to say something here the woman is the most deceivableness of the earth right now don't throw nothing but God meet her why because she was designed in such a way a man that she didn't have to have those type of defenses if she would have just simply my god I stayed in her place Adam was her protection that's right so it's not about her meaning she needed to do was the know her place to stay in the play she stepped out and she begins I guess I could say a Eve a man was the first woman preacher went back and shared that message with Adam she got out of the place right cause she received an evil spirit of deception received an evil spirit of deception now I'm not talking this ain't bubblegum ice cream I want you to really listen to the words that I'm seeing and we know that God doesn't make mistakes God makes something is always right the first time he didn't make a mistake with ease by designing the woman like that so there is a very good reason why God designed her that way and that is because she was not designed to have her own personal protection amen God designed her husband to be her protection right because the man was made in the image of God and God is reflecting himself and showing that demand showing his relationship with us because it is to be our headship man show me our relationship with our Heavenly Father right you see because if we stop from behind the word right amen we have no protection he was showing the tight there her husband man she had to stay fortified behind Adam amen to be protected and in this day an hour and then we have to be fortified the Word of God to be protected because there's a virus in the lair deception a literal demon not just the card cell right not just the phone demon possession of deception amen we look at all the spirit that was old Legion a man the Spade that was only j'en and man he was was brought up in the service this morning that no doubt he was a good fellow started off pretty good but along the way he meant something happened what he received a demonic spirit a man that caused him to take off his clothes caused him to just tormented this young man was tormented by demonic spirits and didn't know how to go free yeah a lot of us today I'm tormented the demon experience in your heart you want to go free in your heart you know it but you can't shake that devil you need a supernatural Italian amen hey you need a supernatural in town amen to be delivered amen from that demon oppression call it what it is that's exactly what it is my brothers and sisters it's not a concept it's not just the built authorities demonic possession and if you're not careful that demon will take you straight to hell say that he come to kill steal and destroy he would destroy your life everything that God has for you he will destroy it amen it's the demonic spirit amen Eve's protection against the deception was her headship amen she had she had the capacity she didn't have the capacity within herself so the first little trick the devil came and played on her she fell for it hook line and sinker if she'd had just stayed behind her Hitchin instead of trying to reason things in herself then the Fallen Eden could have never taken place we don't reason with the word we take it just as it is don't reason with it amen thank you Lord in the last thing this last day thank you my brother appreciate it Eve amen let me let me say it this way this last day Eve cannot be to see that amen it's not because God has changed her makeup or the woman has given her own ability to defend herself or withstand deception that's not what happened but because she has come into a correct position of her headship in this hour and that's Christ the word she has forsaken her own reasoning and has taken on the mind of Christ by the revelation of the word Bible says in Matthew 24 and 24 for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible it was possible they shall deceive the very elect thank God it's not possible we are easily deceived my brothers and sisters when we have part truth right but because when the whole truth is revealed and then that actually uncovers deception amen when the whole truth of the gospel is laid it covers all of the devil's tricks any meaning I'm thankful in this hour that he's been exposed all of the devil's schemes and tricks have been exposed and then we're going to go through some of them this morning and then and to show you that it's a demonic spirit amen there's so much talk a man in this day and hour about mental health mental health what is mental health what is mental health mental health is demonic oppression depression and possession all right that's mental health it's demonic oppression depression and posesión under that umbrella it's mental health right that's all it is but in science they name it mental health it's demonic oppression depression and pose it I don't care what kind of peeling how long they talk to you it's not gonna catch that won't work you'll just give you a false sense of security and you go on and pick up another dill Church say man some of them recently one of the most very famous fashion designer woman committed suicide in worldly terms she had everything money popularity she was worth millions but took her own life she suffered from mental health demonic oppression depression and possession that's what she suffer from that caused her even she had millions of dollars very successful and she took her own life so what is that demon trying to do to you he is trying to get you into a place through those demonic spirits to where you say there's no I just was you this is the reason for this spiritual deception we crazy that you so many of them possessed by a devil they see one that's not possessed by the devil and they take some role to amen people of the world are totally ignorant about many demonic spirits that they expose themselves to we say that again they are totally ignorant about demon experience that they exposed themselves to and give access to because of the things that they're viewing and feeding on now remember Eve it was pleasant to the eye so what you watch what you allowed to talk to to look at is the access a man of demonic possession depression right oppression you're giving it access to what you feel you give them demons access the sin of literal literature and the entertainment of this age that we are living has been carefully designed by satan has been carefully designed by Satan amen to align and condition the people's mind in order to give demonic power unrestricted access to their hearts and to their lives amen in the message waters of separation a man making Georgia 5500 606 a half here my notes here ei so I probably pull that from a source outside of the force of God that message in a way many times oh thank you actually right there yes many times you see them in different forms it's talking about demons now here recently I've seen one come from a woman that looked like a bat with great big hairs hanging under its legs and so forth its wings come up out right straight up there evil spirits and many times many times it's someone looking ever so beautiful on the outside could only look on the inside and see what is there a dominated by that spirit amen looking so ever so beautiful on the outside he said could only look on the inside and see what that is amen the dominated by spirit praise the Lord let's look at the example here amen fashion magazines of the old we're gonna look at fashion magazines like they used to because everything his own it's an internet YouTube and different things like that but see back when I was coming up they had Cosmopolitan Hogan y'all know what I'm talking about some of these fashion magazines and different things that people would would look at these are skinny models showing off if they're not careful they can quite easily find themselves given access to an anorexic spirit science have proved this they've talked about it that looking at these unhealthy images cause more girls to get sick and starve themselves almost to death try to come up to that image right

would you spend your time feeding on how do you feel amen so the devil is grooming his victims a man well before he strikes a man he does so to charm and trickery and by cunningness a man the great deception amen in the old days any man young girls used to play with baby dogs on this Mother's Day the Prophet said that is sending young girls nature to want to be a mother something so it was fine to give up a little baby doll that seemed like a worthy gift for a young girl but it was a company that came out right in the 50s or so a man called Mattel and they came up with another dog this dog was no baby [Music] [Music] [Music] thank God he didn't see you that way but the double planet does see visual acuity to destroy you so demonic oppression depression in possession they even look at the name they keep playing with baby dolls they called it a Barbie doll a Barbie doll close to the baby it ain't no baby give it all kind of look at the clothes come with a little package you can even buy clothes for your Barbie dolls and your girls sitting there playing with that thing you're taking in those unhealthy images a man and later on when they get a life way they begin to mimic that mess be uglier me I'll be mu being what the devil want you to be just chain and one li you fall right into the pits of him the devil use the woman as his tool in the beginning and he's gonna use the woman right as a tool in the end he is grooming you as his tool to take meaning me in the hell take mini me in here prophets saying you will be held accountable you will be held accountable for the way you displayed yourself it's that demon on the inside that is influencing you why because of the unhealthy images right the great deception amen amen amen you notice how little girls amen the prophecy I'm sorry in God's gift always finding their place preached in a 1963 12:22 paragraph 1 to 12 amen you say you'll notice how a little girl she goes to a dog because that's her nature she's coming she's a coming mother amen she would be a mother someday I mean if she lives in everything you know her nature that's the reason little girls like a little dog she wants to take care of it amen because it's because all she's a little potential a little mother a man but the devil threw you a curveball and gave you this ungodly woman I almost said something up but they call it a doll a toy you see how this ee he cut he goes like that shoot he designs these things right amen to get that demonic spirit in and it lays dormant right into the right time right into the right time when you see that spirit began to manifest itself it's a demonic spirit amen you acknowledge that thing God can deliver you God can deliver you from your own what you think is your own thinking he can take those ungodly desires out of you it's not you it's not you it's a Dean Manik demon that has that young girl went to that dance didn't realize that two days she went back and she began to reminisce she begin to reminisce of the good old days that she used to get out down the day is flowing and right there that devil who swooped right in through her memory gave access to that deal yes should have cast it down but she didn't amen and they doubled that's this blue prophecy because it was a hairy back what you think in you what you thinking do that causes you to do that if you could only see it's a demon a demon that is compelling you just like Legion to take off your clothes so what is to flaunt yourself before man like a piece of meat god don't see you that way you are daughter of God son of God carry yourself like one he has something so much better for you but if you continue in that way he's going to destroy you Bible says in Proverbs the sixteenth chapter 16 verses how much better reason to get wisdom then go and to get understanding they made rather to be chosen than silver amen you see it is good to have silver and gold but wisdom is far better you can lose your money amen but when wisdom is given to you by God then that is a very source of wealth we're talking about the great deception amen job lost all his silver and all his gold but he never lost his wisdom amen and in the end he became twice as wealthy as he did before but if you don't have wisdom and you lose your money then there is no good chance you'll lose it permanently amen same boats Chuck hour 17 says the highway of the uprightness to depart from evil he that keepeth his ways his way preserved with his soul a person that maintains his position in the way of truth a man and righteousness the eighteenth verse says pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall amen that's what's becoming this age my brothers and sisters a haughty spirit amen Hollywood has produced a mass deception amen a mass deception to television amen better it was to have a humble spirit and lowly then to divide the sport with the proud better to have a humble spirit proverbs 16:18 19 verse better to have a humble spirit but with the lowly than to divide the spoils with the proud now I want to get into something we're talking about let's see here a man in the book of Ephesians the fourth chapter the first verse amen amen the book of Ephesians first verses therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called now the word beseech means I beg you to walk worthy that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye were called now that were vocation that word vocation definition says a monk defines a calling by the will of God or a bestow men of God's distinguishing grace upon a person or a nation by which a person or a nation is put in the way of salvation amen as the vocation of the Jews under the old dispensation of the Gentiles under the gospel amen another another another definition says a type of employment your vocation could be a lot like your calling your occupation your trade it is your vocation right so we're talking about here where Eve was was possessed and how our position a man comes by a lack of understanding amen a lack of understanding because Eve got from behind the Word of God amen but see Paul here he says I beg you amen that ye walk worthy of your vacation your calling amen because see the Bride of Christ in this day amen she knows her position yes amen she's being a man positionally placed a man understanding that her calling an election assure a men that she our instance sustained now see these scriptures are have compound meaning there's a natural calling a man of positioning in the natural but that's also from the bride of Jesus Christ amen which is the evil this time a man has a spiritual placing any man fortified behind the headship of a man huh God yes amen we have been called amen to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen the Bible says here we want to look at this little star here in Luke 14 where he says Dean said heel to him a certain man made a great supper and bade many amen and he said to his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one constant began to make excuses the first set up to him I have bought a piece of ground and have me to go see it I'm pray that I be excused and the other said that I have brought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them and I pray that I may be excused and the other set I have Maddie wife and therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house began begin being angry said up to the servant go out quickly into the streets and to the lanes and to the cities and bring me hither bringing hither the poor the main the hall and the blind and the servants said unto the Lord it is done and that has as thou has commanded and yet there is room and when the prophet of God said when he was going out get the portal halt the maiming the blind amen that was the first and second pool amen that was the Hillary campaign a man a brother branham he was going out to get the hall and there me but see that was stealing room amen so he said to his servant I command him Lord that dad's room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled and I say unto you that I say unto you that none of those men which are being bitter bidding that were bidden shall taste of my son and then when a great multitude with him and he turned unto them a man if any man come unto me and hate not his father his mother his wife his children his brother his sister yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple you have to hate that old way about yourself you have to get to a point that you hate that old way you don't want to be that way ask God to deliver me from the errors this demonic possession Amen this this this this this thing that causes me amen to do this thing that I know wrong that I know it's not right amen you were bidden to come amen to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen to know your position to know your position amen there's another story about how when at this time you must come through the door any man there's a man there that puts on a room Amen that everybody at this a man is dressed just the same a man if you come any other way any man that won't work because you have to come a man through the door amen you have to come God's provided way a man to be welcome at this great supper Amen this great feast that you've been bidden to amen a lot of times one of the things that get to me you find a lot amongst those that don't know no better oh I should I say those that may be under demonic influence a man they look at all sisters a man because of the way they're dressed and they say things like it don't take all of that yeah it don't take all of that are you kidding me so you mean you think you're going to get to have a dress like that you are up under a demonic influence and just don't know no better the Bible said here wisdom and humility wisdom and humility a man is a good thing amen but ignorance and pride is horrible you can't they don't know nothing that you can't tell them them because they not only ignorant but they proud don't be in that condition you've been bidden to the marriage supper you have you have an invitation you have an invitation in your hand but you gotta go guys provided ways you gotta go God's provided way a lot of times they they feel like people so if you feel like well it don't matter it don't matter what your whelming on the half side God is only interested on the inside it don't matter what you put on it matter will come out of your body it matter what's on the inside it matter what come on out of your mouth it not it was on the top of your mouth it matter what's on your flesh why because you are trying you're being and all levels are holding your thoughts got to be holy what you look at has to be holy a man want to take into your body has to be holy I promise you if you get the Holy Ghost on the inside it will reflect on the outside it will reflect on the outside because that demonic spirit it be cast out because he can't pour himself into an unclean vessel that spirit I have to go Amy and you'll begin to see things differently you'll begin to see the trickery of the devil he said oh my how was I so deceived and then you begin to take on a new perception you begin to look at other people to shaking him oh you're so deceived amen we look at Samson and Delilah the perfect type of the day a man Samson being a type of the bride they meant in the Delilah of being a type of that deceiving church a man Samson ago and he'll lay his head and flirt with that Philistine woman where is your secret line Samson tell me where the secret life and he said tell her

ropes cause of Pride and cords of of all of these different things and he's shake himself Amen and break the cause but he went back in other words he kept going back he kept going back the Lord you have shook yourself so many times and gone free but the problem is you where the dig said something last week he say he got these shackles on me and the chains of broke but it's easy for the chain to just go back together that's the same time Samson going back he got free again he went right back he got free again he went right back until one time he got so compel about it yeah then he told her the truth he went to shake yourself amen and nothing happened they put his eyes out and look at what they did the devil made the bride for Samson work for him didn't I tell you the same thing that did the devil is trying to make you a tool and put you to work for him but the stories Samson happened to reach back and feel another Locker amen and if you could just reach back because you have a promise and that's the right value and reach back and feel those locks of faith begin to probe back and say once more once more let me avenge my job amen and make a promise amen to destroy that enemy with everything that you have how how do you destroy your enemy by dying out to the dying out to you a Samson went to the pillars the axe to the border lead him to the pillows and he pushed down those

couldn't keep Bibles on the Shelf because everybody was was trying to trying to get into work trying to get in a word you know find out you know what was going on and a new prophecies were being fulfilled and just didn't know what was happening and uh you know over time the people just begin to let down the bars and they got right back into the same routine of life they drew rather than closer to God they start drawing away from God and here we are in in 2020 amen and we're dealing with this Co at 19 and something where in the entire world the entire world was shut down entire world is impacted not just one nation but an entire world the whole planet and you find people again trying to get closer to God trying to get closer to God but now it's really preparing to open back up and and what I find amazing is that it's not just the u.s. opening up when we make announcements it seem like everybody else start doing the exact same thing and the whole world is trying to get back to where it used to be but I wonder if if we're going back amen the same way they did in 2001 when a man Li wen when we had the the twin towers go down when we are that that's if we don't watch if we don't watch it we'll find my cells doing the same thing again repeating the same mistakes rather than drawing closer to God we're drawing further away from God I thank God that God would send us the work that calls us to check ourselves a man it's time for a checkup praise the Lord it's time for a checkup we don't want to draw Amen away from God we want to draw closer to God I pray this is

Father we thank you for your word that has come forward today this great deception Lourdes it's even worse than the virus the people deceived to think that they are right with you the thing that everything is is good God is a great deception they look they don't realize what it takes to please you they don't know you're worried they don't understand God that how you want them to walk and how you want them to live in God how you want them to act and react doc we must come according to the word we can't bring sacrifices the way that Cain brought sacrifices and expect you to accept them but Lord we must come the way that you've called us so I pray Lord that the light was shined into the hearts of the people they would recognize Lord that just speaking to him even through the midst of this pandemic gods are trying to call hearts and I pray Lord Jesus that people respond to what they've heard here today thank you then brother troll would get himself out of their way and allow you to
