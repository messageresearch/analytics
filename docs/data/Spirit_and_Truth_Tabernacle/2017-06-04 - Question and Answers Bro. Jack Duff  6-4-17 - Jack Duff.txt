is here present is here this form always good that come into this presence just a couple more things that needed to make this number before we can in order to get through otherwise but we have a this month who number of things are coming up and as we're going to July as well summers always rather busy but we wanted to get some rehearsal of the calendar and their rehearsals that we'll be doing for the South Florida choir and that will be on June 24th and July 3rd those are rehearsals for the South Florida choir we'll be doing that in front of West Coasters June 24th of the Saturday can never be at 6:00 p.m. then July 3rd is on Monday and that were me at 7:30 p.m. it's kind of keep that in mind that stout Florida Clara versus Jerry more than July 3rd more spirit and truth we had a musicians rehearsal on Friday night and we're going to be having another one two Fridays from here to 16 the musicians we get together on the 16th and so just keep that in mind and they're also make a preparation because the 30th of June which is the Friday before for the afraid of his church come we want to try to get a couple songs together this from our choir so on the 30th of June just put that in your calendar this is the Spirit of Truth will have her so here at the church for our choir we'll try to get a couple songs together for the meeting speeding start on the first and on the second so keep that in mind and the last thing I want to make mention of his own brother wesco he'll be turning 75 this year his birthday is July 4th they'll be having amen a picnic in honor of him but they did they were trying to just kind of keep the cost down if you're the best because they don't want to do me a banquet mr.north keep the cost down they decided on doing a picnic but unfortunately even enjoy the picnic they still have to charge because the picnic is limited to how many people they can actually have there and so they wanted to charge and I believe is like maybe five dollars a person start my maxim is it eight dollars three eight eight four adults are there five four kids so I'll keep that in mind we will there'll be a time that will come lap to collect the money make sure we give it to all them and that way we are we're represented at the pig nation a man and I so we just we just want to go in to celebrate him and I knew it a good lessons on that 75 years old it's this point it's just I know for the west coast real blessing so at anytime we're all they were just kind of supportive and whatever way he should just appreciate it so let's do all we can to do that so just keep those things in mind we will just continue to make Mitch love it as soon as the days approach so praise the Lord I think that's all I need to see musicians thank you all so much for your service on today man the Lord bless you that you have your seats and I did want to thank the Lord for the specials that went forth and man thank you all a man for the contribution to the service praise the Lord we're just just so so grateful for what we feel the Lord doing in this place a man he is a mighty a man and I you know just sometimes you sit back and just observe and you look at you know different things like man asked man that's God that's God that's God you know and I what I find that we got to start giving more praise to God by what he doing rather than giving the devil too much credit because you know anytime the devil's moving you know God can't God is up to something because that God is up to something right and the devil sometimes the devil know what God up to before you know and he's trying to block it right so you you have to just stay in tune with what the Spirit of the Lord has promised you a man in this hour now I won't I won't take too much time talking we'll go right into the word of the Lord today if you just join me in reading a man a scripture probably two scriptures that will read from Genesis 3 and also Jeremiah 8 and then Genesis 3 starting at verse 9 and then we'll turn to Jeremiah 8 and just praying that the Holy Spirit ooh let us be able to bring these thoughts together amen today Genesis chapter 3 verse 9 man it says when the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked passed out eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave is to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel j-man the Lord is a blessing to the reading that and I'll just read quickly from Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 22 says it there no balm in Gilead is there no physician there while then is not the health of the daughter of my people recover a man so let's just have a word of Prayer as we approach the word of the Lord today father we thank you for the ability again to read scripture but we know the Holy Spirit is the one who must give us interpretation of what Scripture speaks to us so we ask God that as we would go through this thought today's to God would just go in front of us that you would just open up on understanding and father in doing so you it draws closer to you through Lord through revelation because realizing that when we leave this place we have to have something with standing on and the greatest foundation we can find is the Word of God because heavens earth will pass but the word will remain forever so help us God to receive revelation in our hearts and through that let us stand against the enemy it's a jesus christ name that we pray a man saying man god bless you bless you we want to just use for a title today questions and answers and man questions and answers and I'll start by reading a quote here from the sermon God's chosen place of worship they meant something that the Prophet said here in this sermon God's chosen place of worship and he starts out by saying my subject tonight is God's chosen place of worship if you notice the month of ABA D or ABA B there is means April the month of april's when they were brought out they said and now the strange thing is that we - - worshipers of God in this day we live in we find so many different ideas as people and as long as their different idea about things there's there's got different questions there's got to be one true answer to every question that's asked there's got to be one true answer to every question that asks if I would ask the question what is this and he's pointing at the pulpit there says well they say a desk what is it for see now that somebody might say it isn't a desk it's a board well it's a bore but yet it's a desk you see there's got to be a true answer to it and if I would ask a question about anything there's got to be a true answer there could be something close to it but there's got to be a true direct answer to every question so therefore every question that comes up in our lives there has got to be a true correct answer a man I love the way that the Prophet puts that he said there's got to be a true and correct answer and one other place the Prophet said if there is a Bible question then there must be a Bible answer right a man you if somebody comes to you approach with a Bible question you got to be able to go to your Bible and get the Bible answer right and he also said if there's a reason that people would have a question is because they said there's a deep you know inside of that person that's calling out to a deep and if there's a defendant that's calling out that he says there must be a deep somewhere to respond to that cry hey man so you know I know for myself as I was just coming up as a young man you have all kind of questions about God and you know who is God you know where to God come from you know how did mankind begin and you know where the first man come from you know all these things and when we when we go back to a scripture we find the answer so many of these things you know as far as where man came from and and how God made man in the beginning and create and how he created woman took the rear bothers a man a creative woman we find all those answers but you know I remember just being a young boy and just not really understanding God you know and just just you know who he was I mean I figured this world was pretty big so he must be a big God you know I mean huge you know and and I like this little building that always talked about the hotel over there in Palm Beach and I we would sit on the we stand in West Palm Beach and look across the Palm Beach and you know we would we would be fishing there and I see that big old building us a man that thing is shaped just like a little a chair you know not about a big chair not a little chair but shake like a big chair I say that's got to be the throne where God dwells that was in my mind I'm thinking God sitting on that building no he was sitting on that building I found out a long time he like sitting on that building but he is sitting on this building he's living inside of this building right and I mean you are you are the place where God dwells it's in your heart that God dwells it you got a little compartment in your heart where you smooth well and that's the place that God gets them any controls everything that you do praise God for that right you know I had I had questions that many of us have had questions enough and only God is the one that can actually provide you know some of the answers but I want to just kind of talk on the subject of questions and answers because you know when we when we when we preach back in Genesis let's see there were some questions and asked and sometimes there was answers given other times they were important the answer hallelujah amen sometimes God asked the question people aboard the answer but it does not mean God don't want an answer to this question if you ever ask them out of question they start even then go on here and go in there you just reword the question right but you gonna get your answer because you need to have an answer to that question and the only reason you go into that person to ask the question is because you know that individual has the answer Amen that person can settle what is going on inside of you glory to God so you know when I went with the other thing that I love about God is that when God is asking the question God already knows he has hey he already knows the answer so during don't think you being smarter you outsmart God when you avoiding you know the question but God already knows the answer he's waiting to see how you gonna respond all right stay with me here today one of the questions that was asked in the beginning a man of Scripture you know and we'll pick up Adam and even a little bit but you know one of the questions that was asked it was asked to Abraham it was asked to Sarah here God had come down to visit Abraham and Sarah and he was there you know at their tent and he was eating and you know and just having fellowship with them and and then he began to tell Abraham and say you know Abraham sare your wife is going to have a son I promise you and stare your wife is going to have a son and as he started fitting there the tension talked with Abraham and Sarah inside the tent of Sarah begins to laugh at her heart and when she begin to laugh in our heart you say where's Sarah and why she laughing you know and services no no I want laughing no no no I know you were laughing you were in the tent laughing that at what I just said because Sarah just could not believe that you know she said how can me and my Lord have pleasure together at the age that we are so how can we even you know have pleasure how can we even how could I even give birth to a child so they keep the fun land that was just impossible glory to God and I bring that out this morning cuz you might be facing something I think it's just impossible don't don't think that way because God had a question of Abraham and Sarah when they begin to think that way I don't know how you thinking this morning but if you think if something is too difficult God got a question for you and I would say he already know the answer but he's still gonna ask you to see if you know the answer and then the question is is there anything too hard for the Lord that's the question of the act there that's the question in the ax Abraham is there anything that's too hard for the Lord now if you when you when you look at a date and give them an answer they they never gave him an answer they never said no that's nothing too hard for you they just kind of kept going on but God knew he was going to bring that thing that the promise that he's made he was gonna bring in the past but he got I'm not hallelujah and the reason he brought the questioning Abraham because you know Abraham and Sarah would fulfill what he had promised I know you looking at how old you are I know you're looking at you know your veins all dried up and you can't do this you can't I know you looking at all that but my question is there anything too hard for the Lord it might be too hard for the doctor but is it to offer the Lord and my answer this morning is no there is nothing too hard for the ROI it might be too hard for me but there's nothing too hard for the look I don't even answer to the question and whatever you go through you got to give your own answer to the question a man you don't get what you expect all right but you know there's nothing too hard for oh let's let's just read a little bit from from this this this sermon is there anything too hard for the Lord just want to just kind of slip this in before we go further amen the Prophet says that says in the book of Genesis the eighteenth chapter and the first eight words of the fourteenth verse I would like to read this it says is there anything too hard for the Lord and now just a little drama to kind of kind of catch the feeling of the audience hours before they come to get me while I stay in a room praying waiting close the doors nobody bothers me and I just keep praying praying and then when I feel his presence real near sometimes I look up and see it that light that you see in the picture and they've got around the world now then coming to the meeting I'd like to walk right in and kind of feel out the meeting to see where the Holy Spirit is moving and then I can have my prayer line going and and now we see in the first part of this chapter Abraham was setting in the door of his tent on a real hot day it must have been a very hot day perhaps a lot of complaints have been coming in lately by the herdsmen and that the grass was all gone the land was drying up and that the cattles were coming very thin and also that the water supply was just about all gone they found the water hosing the land and as the water got low they would dig out and dig out till they got down to where the water's was water was seeping through the rocks and still the cattle did not have enough water to supply them you know sometimes when things are going wrong dark we know about nature that is darkest just before day and many times when we see disastrous things happening like that especially to believers we must bear this in our mind that is Satan trying to block the blessing that's on this road now I got to stop and pause right there just what look there because I know I felt the devil all week long it's as soon as I finish preaching amen uh you know you get what you expect we leave Church and I and we go down to get something you know some little ice cream or something like that and we get back to the Karma my dad door won't close won't close on the matter what's what's wrong with this so we we thought we fix it and here we got you know the family sitting in the van and the van just just the dos slide wide open you know I like now same done but the devil right you know though wide open everybody in the back just praying Lord Jesus Lord we just riding down the street broke in doing everything so we probably get the dough clothes a little bit right but it will knock and said so finally let you know when we got lights on and all kind of stuff going right so we probably get a bang you know close enough say okay now now I will just get it home and we'll do with it once we get home found out you know the Sloot little glass particles down there for some broken glass we got all that out the little door say okay nice fixes are we going to bed thank God I say that that del is a liar we just went on the bed woke up the next morning lights blinking don't want clothes again the devil just all over the place all right and then I say man this ain't nothing but the devil and then I turn around my daughter come in to say daddy I got lights all in my car I told y'all car when it come from right and then I you know we wake up and in the one morning hear hear of the refrigerator's leakin well whatever happens in the refrigerator is one of the components in the refrigerator went out and not now we got to get that success a in mind I say I'll tell you what safeties if you want if you don't want to see praise them you better stop testing me cuz I I don't know how but doctor mix away huh I know that much if this car keep breaking they don't gotta give me a new winner right I don't know how I can't do it but I know God can do it God is up to something and anybody just for me I start getting calls from all the different things you know this house going through this and how clapping mother said none but the devil my daughter sitting around on the phone and all of a sudden phone just my just just which could get a charge can do I'm like well well in the world I see the same number the devil ain't nobody's ever as I said we went yesterday and I walked in and the stolen people can see it already gone trying to get the thing worked out and they thought they saw me come in with us they just we had an attitude soon that soon as I got in so I just I get told I say look I'm she is leaving here with a new home now you gonna help me get there now let's walk through the process but I mean you got to take your soul over the devil take control over the atmosphere it ain't nothing but the devil trying to block you anytime especially a believer with a believers going through that you gotta recognize there is a black piece all the way to your out that's why the devil's piece armor stopped a black bag

so just just understand these things now there's a where Satan's trying to block block you there's a blessing that's on this road there is a blessing that's on his Road I'm going to reach up and grab mine there is a blessing that's on his Road he said that that was very much so in the case state was trying to tempt them to feel that they had done wrong and was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give to Abraham and Sarah now y'all know name/number the truth when they tell us that you don't did this that's why this is going wrong you don't did that that's why this because I did nothing wrong actually you had to get permission to do this and the reason you the reason I'm going through cuz God had confidence that I would keep standing in the midst of it hallelujah look at him say say I was trying to block the oncoming visitation and God was going to give Abraham and Sarah and we're talking scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love God no matter how bad it seems remember it has to be working for your good I'm so glad of that you know we even get hit it's morning at a trial I mean just just from Sunday to Sunday trial trial trial trial trial you know one of the systems uh you know just the slight mistake but a car ends up on top of us that what open us what you called me but the parking thing so I mean we get downs of cars on toxic we going in the free anyway and we go pray and then we come out and we don't we gonna get it out of here somehow I'm gonna be just like okay well you know we trying to put all our heads together to get the car out and finally some guy just showed up out of nowhere his name was Brian free for Brian but he's certified he should about Brian okay he showed up out of nowhere and he says recent grabbing it that's twisted it up and we pull that thing out of there so now back to copy they'd rather go home and Ryan got his car left got it Ryan where we praying for Ryan come on church Oh God hey maybe nothing too hard for God glory to God we remember our counter stuff we tried it all Jack the car trying to pull off the Jackie and all kind of things we doing we trying to get that call desktop hallelujah hey man and I tell you if it would have took us to lift the car God will give us trip to do that if that's what it would it took a man ain't nothing too hard for God all right I'm moving on questions and answers you got questions I got answers all right Lord how is why not this amen all right come on let's keep going hey say say uh he said uh he says uh that they was very much so in this case they was trying to tempt him to feel that that I'm wrong and was trying to block the oncoming visitation that God was going to give to Abraham and Sarah and we're taught in the scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love God and no matter how bad it seems remember it has to be remember it has to be working for your good that I'm so glad of that a man Satan's been out to me all day and I can say all week so I just believe that there's a blessing in store here in this city can I pay in this church there's a blessing in store right somewhere and I know when he tempts and tries to block out what's he trying to get you to disbelieve and if the worst thing that you can do is just believe God and as soon as you get a little skirt scared well maybe I haven't done this I haven't done that right there's things got that blessing conquer for you you can't get it as you can't get to it as long as Satan let you think that since perhaps if we would listen to such things of temptations like that and we would pay attention to them then it would be that we would miss the blessing so my advice to you don't even pay attention or whatever the devil doing gah got purpose it's all working together for good you I want to say it again it's all working together to do this sometimes I just sit back and I listen to the trial that's it God is working right here got to admit you we can't see it yet but God is moving right here God give me and do something with that right there it's all working together for good would you just do me a favor before I go for just five somebody shake their hand and say it is all working together to good it all make sure you emphasize all oh oh oh it's all working together the good it's all [Applause] glory glory glory I mean no matter what it is that your faces oh and what no matter what you gotta face is all working together for your good hallelujah see the person for purposes of asking the question it's so that you can obtain the answer and the reason that you ask a specific person is because you have confidence that that person is able to provide not just the answer but the correct answer right because if there's a questions got to be a correct answer right so so you ask that person because they're able to provide to you the correct answer now now now now the other thing is when God is asking questions to people when he acts Abraham and Sarah is there anything too hard for the Lord he knew even though they didn't respond he knew today was still bring forth the right answer and the promised son came through Abraham and Sarah praise the Lord he also one time stopped ezq any acts of the question he first looking into this you know this Val Aquila tribe owns a dead situation dad circumstance then it's a look impossible I mean I see I just see bones no skins or nothing to life just bones around here this is a dad circumstance and it looks the exact things that's on ax men look at this look at all this look at this and let me ask them a question something that had never been activated by day before 33 th e zq sermon in 10 these balls I'm not pop on the other phone I'm talk about the thing that you dealing with Cathy is most clear remember we got asked the question you already know the answer now he's if you did not give him the answer he did you say Val noise you ain't saying nothing to God you an answer card question he said southern man Kandi's told it what I'll know it yep God stop no but God want you to be a part of the answer you think so yeah I do notice a not prophesy to them both and when he's EQ open up his mouth to begin the prophesy whole begin the connector bow and when the Bulls came together that they might call for spirit to come inside impose and watch supposedly yeah I know they can live I would ask you the question if I did not have the answer but I want you to be a part of the answer so I'm gonna have you prophesy to him look at that he acts the Prophet when he read a scripture if you say to the mountain be thou removed own valiant heart you can have what you say he acts a prophet do you believe what you read yet Laura I believe that you sure yeah I believe it what's your heart for another question squirrels answered how many of you haven't question three answered where you want a Matt question I want this one to do this any other answer next one question this do that never answer after the second one worship lord I thank you for these two squirrels I'm gonna go and tell everybody no stop you ain't going nowhere cuz you told me you wanted three actually say how many did you say you want it give me there sir cuz I know the answer alright I just want to know what you don't say well what I did acts with three beware the third one no fear you have to speak it and it happened just the way he said it gonna happen he shot it could not find it come back the next day got dealt with a McKenzie if you speak it would be right where you say to be in and he in the father is the next day happened two times in his life question and answers but God already got the answer he just wants you to be a part of it Jesus walked up to the man one day the angel trouble to water and and when the angel comes over the water the first one that would jump into this world owes made whole hallelujah last week I heard brother Kayla said come on somebody jump in jump in when the Holy Ghost is moving you got to get in today God will speak to you that you feel certainly not do you want to get in on that an orcas you don't know when it's gonna pass that way again right so you know and sometime when you getting a docket change the whole service just by your worship oh yeah I don't know it Hattie right change the atmosphere by saying the right thing at the right time Pattie right all she said that nothing but a truth well Hattie since you said that I got a question for you what's your greatest desire what do you want had it because you can have it right now that's your question Hannah had to think about our answer how to say uh what should i X what not that's not my question you get to answer it now I'll give you this you could actually this you could actually that actually your mom and dad actually your sister would leave its hips you can actually anything you can acts for money whatever you want right now you can have it I don't know what accent well you better think about it you got to get the answer I'll take the salvation of my two boys right there immediately got the answer look you can get an answer if you'll just jump in so Jesus AK mr. he walked up to him here to Angel troubling and he walked up to this one specifically and say now will thou be made whole when you read the scripture the man never answered to you the question hey just you know well you know what happens is that you know when the angel start telling the world I don't have nobody to pick me up and put me in but but when I'm coming what's it weigh Tam innit you're confusing me you're saying you need somebody to help you put in but you also say when you come in so that means you can't do some things on your own what it is it's you're comfortable with your condition and Jesus said I got time sake they could be bad and start walking right sick he already knew the answer before he gave the man the question but he wanted to see what the man's responsibility look don't give God your doubt don't give God your you know that the things that can't happen give God what can happen he asks a question to Joe Joe was going through he was in a trial big trial y'all bear with me today lost everything he had children animals servants he lost everything that he had and as Joe was going through this trial you know God come to him and he's like me I just wish I could just knock on the door of God just try to get him answer to my question I got a lot of questions I wish I could just go to his house knock on his door and sit down with him have him talk to me well doc can't let Joe in the form of a whirlwind and when he got the job he begin to talk to Joe any actual a question he said so where was Dow when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars saying again if they answer me if you have understanding where were you now God already knew the answer to that question he knew Joe was right there with him oh my God he's a joke Joe that come from Dobbs overs going back job was a part of God he knew the answer but he needed job to give and see himself ended so I asked him a question job never really gave me answer right but by revelation we have the answer that we were right there with them amen and brother Branham there's a quote here on this let me just read it the Ministry of Christ let me just read this I love this it says also now as soon as I start a ssin said blessed are the Holy Ghost jumped on the mother said whence cometh the mother of my lord for as soon as I stagger tation coming to my ears my baby leaped in the womb for joy talk about talk about shouting something new huh why is the oldest religion in the world y'all get that shouting is the oldest religion in the world the shouting religion this why thousands of thousands of years before the world was ever found it God asked job when they said where was you when I laid the foundation world when the Morningstar staying together the sons of God shouted for joy talk about something new we just got a new case of the old time time that's all certainly shouted for joy what a time sounds Mo's are we supposed to be able to shout a man we spoke be able to do that and any time the word get good to you can let out a good shout do you know the way they got the walls down in Jericho threw a shot maybe you'll get some overcoming power when you begin to shout dance it represent victory Oh hallelujah glory to come on church we got to be afraid if this is this is when you go through you find out in the middle of your briefs I don't know about you but I don't been there I mean sometimes people don't know that you're going through but here you come to church you just beginning aunt Janet began the worship it just began to praise God and why you getting free a man that thing that you worried about also kids free and I think what happens Amen even if the situation has changed what happened is that we change in the situation our outlook changes Oh our response changes our attitude changes and when that changed with the other thing shake but it starts with the wash shop shovel old time old time thing they did that before the foundation of the world and we still doing it today flore glory glory glory glory all right stay with me here so there was another question that was axed by the Lord he saw he was there with the disciples then he asked the question who do men say I am the cyclist gave an answer and I said well something I've easy if you to answer other people's responses well this is what some say reliance some say Jeremiah say it's one of the prophets that's what other people said so it's very easy to repeat what somebody else have said but then he changed the question who do you say that I the Son of Man am I'm not thinking about what they say now I want to know what you say I stick it quiet maybe somebody thinking like I don't want to say the wrong thing but P there's something by people Peter is a guy to Hale afraid to speak up right Peter this is it i'ma just see it all y'all are free to UM adjusts it I think thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and when Peter said anything blasted I thought Simon birch others but flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father in heaven has revealed it anything upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail Peter answered the question that for the right way when you answer the question right well you don't know what how to blessings might come Oh glory to God we have confidence in the omniscient God since he is all-knowing he is able to provide answers to all about questions David was going through a trial one time and and you know here he was fighting with the enemy on the field I saw he was raised up to sleep it's times but because of trials and tribulations he end up in in the camp with the field sometimes fighting fighting for the phils burns well as they were on the way to battle one day the the Philistine Lords this phenomena we don't want this guy David going with us because he is one of the israelites the weekend ready to go against the Israelites and in the battle he might turn against us so send him back home they send David back home he went back all downtrodden you know I can't believe that they won't let me fight that was just part of the trial but it will cure and be a greater trial when he got home we found out his wife his wives were taking children taken not all that the men that were with them their families were taken and David looked at that and he had some questions my and but the Bible say that when David got in that situation the man start beginning to talk about we got stone this guy David can't believe he led us into that like this we're gonna kill this guy date right now the Bible says David encouraged himself in the Lord and you don't have to learn how to do that no sometimes you might not get a telephone call but you can have to learn how to encourage yourself in the Lord you have to learn how to go to the Father yourself by the take yourself hey Matt sometimes you did you get your favorite things that you go back and listen to your favorite sermons that you go back and listen to come every time you listen till you get Rhian courage right a favorite scripture that you can go right back to because I mean Romans 8:28 every belief while to go there all things work together for good no matter what I'm going through is still working together for good right right here here David you know is going through this and and David you know finally after encouraged himself he had a time of Prayer and they begin to ask God a question the reason that we have confidence in God we have confidences and I'm missing God that he's all-knowing he's able to provide answers to our questions so David began to go in easy and first time you're 30 verse 8 says David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue to this truth shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue but thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all they've got an answer to his question and I don't I mean I mean that the question I mean the question said I pursue sell overtake them shall I do this and I say yeah you go ahead and do it because I'm gonna give you everything that the devil took from you God is wise his children got everything back and then start taking some of these spoils - oh my god is a good guy after hearing of the out of the Holy Ghost outpouring on the day of Pentecost many were told that God that God had made the crucified Jesus both Lord and Christ and the people that were standing on the day of Pentecost all the from different lands and different nations when they realized that they had crucified you know God some when they realized what happened they actually questioned say say say what must we do since we've done all this and we're wrong we're guilty what must we do they responded in Acts chapter 2 verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and sent an appealing to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do that's the question then Peter said unto them this is the answer then Peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost they had a question God had an answer I want to read this out of Matthew 19 to verse 16 this rich young ruler approached the Lord Jesus he also had some questions see we the reason that we go to the Lord Jesus because we know that he's the one that's able to give us the answer to the question that's the reason we pray we want we want to get in contact with somebody that can actually give us an answer I don't want to just waste my time just talking to people that came to nothing for me hallelujah right Amen I got to get to the person that can actually give me an action that's why people are you know they say when you when something happened maybe you go out and you buy something and it don't it maybe that the transaction was the way that you enjoyed it or you wanted it maybe you bought something that didn't work out the way the 2000 workout when you go back you're not asking just to talk to the person that sold it to you escalate it and the reason you escalate it is because you want to get to the person that can actually do something about it who is the person that can refund me who's the person that can give me a credit you don't want to talk about to say well that's above my pay grade I can't make those decisions you just wasted my time please give me the person come on right and then and the reason I'm going to God cuz he's the first time I can do something about it I've got a question I need an answer hallelujah don't worry why should I talk to you why am i coming to you to talk to so I try to get this thing fixed can you really help me so out you know unless we got a million in here that I don't know about it I needed me and I'm not gonna come in a million all these I've talked to you I want you to pray about this with me cuz if you had it I wouldn't ask you to pray about it with me I hope you understand what I'm saying now I understand you got a million you got an answer to my question alright praise Allah this rich young ruler approached Jesus because he knew he would attain the correct answer look at this look at this in Matthew 19 verse 16 let's read it since my whole one came and said of him good master what good thing you see that what good thing shall I do it's all about trying to do good things just because you just get things don't mean you're gonna make it to heaven right good master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life right and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments he says in him which jeez which jesus said thou shalt do no murder so he's asking Jesus with questions now he's getting answers as he's asking the question Jesus has given him answer look it says he said of them which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shall not commit adultery thou should not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou and thou shalt love thy neighbor as myself the young man said to him all these things have I kept from my youth what lack I yet now you asked the question you're bout to get an answer now I got it you right here sometimes you ask the question and the answer you get is an answer that you don't like but it still the correct answer this man is about to get an answer that he does not like but it's still the right answer he actually asks what lack I yet so jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said Jesus unto his disciples bear and I Jesus didn't even stop them from going away notice it now he said let him go see saying see see see you got you got questions God got the answer sometimes you don't like the answer because it's gonna cost you too much oh come on church you know one of the I mean Jesus thought the church was too big in his day he had a mega church three thousand five thousand one time come and have some fish and loaves and he had it that was a mega church not counting children but now in today's congregations you have to count the kids to tell them how to hit people I'm just I'm just joking but but but but but but in Jesus day is five thousand repent then later on four thousand more that he sent same thing fish and loaves fed them and he had this mega church but then he gave a message that shut the church down Oh Lord gee he stood the church down unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me all of a sudden felt they are we told y'all name was a cannibal we should have been following him in the first place we told y'all let's going back to our old churches and Jesus was dead at the Doheny watch tomorrow walked out and shook their hand god bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you enjoyed having you thank you for coming god bless you he just let them all walk out it was only 12 that didn't go nowhere they stayed in church he had a V hey well 82 in the church 70 left twelve state and he went back in the church you say now a question will you also go that's a question Peter again Peters our only one with an answer the rest are like I don't know what you want us to do Peter I ain't going nowhere I'm putting that I'm putting that in today's terms I ain't going away peanuts Peter say only you have the words of eternal life and insisting on the West I don't try them other churches I know this message shut me down but I ain't going back to the nomination i'ma say right yeah Jesus Jesus heard Peter his brethren Jesus a blessing about simon barjona he'd say at this time he said there's still a devil here in the midst of this truth well 12 y'all want to go still a devil 12 and one must not eat ramen forgot who the devil questions answers let me keep reading Matthew 19 it says verse 23 it said this that Jesus is type of barely I sent of you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again I said you're just easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God I didn't say it can be rich y'all don't have a problem with being where the person have money but just I want the money to have the person right and and you know that that whole thing is entered into the eye of a needle that was a gate that was called the eye of the needle right and when they would come the merchants would come to this gate they get there late in the day and you know so they couldn't sell that but they want to be ready for the next day and if you've got there to the city wanting to go to the city and find somewhere to stay you have to get your camel unload all the merchandise take it off the camel and then you have to have the camel get down on his knees because it couldn't just walk through the gate right the gate was closed so he has special gate that he can go through but he had to get down on his knees humble himself get everything unloaded from him then he walks through the gate on his knees and most people don't want to do it on their knees all right let me get back to this let me go to this this message is true and false bond I want to just bring a couple more questions and answers to you and we'll see what the Lord takes it true and false fires the Prophet says this now there was two boys says we'll start with Adam and Eve was pure God made Adam out of the dust of the earth taken from his side a rib and made a woman and she sinned brought Adam into it they both sin then God throw them out they had two children one was Cain one was able if I was going to speak here next week there's one subject that I like to speak on three questions of God where art thou what is this thou has done and where's my brother yeah I got three questions where art thou he spoke to Adam what if this guy has done he spoke to Eve where's my brother he spoke to King three questions that God acts think of it now I just I just wrote this here so we often ask questions of God and we typically expect to receive answers however when God asks us questions we're trying to avoid giving him the answer and I told you early when God asks a question he already know the answer you can take that one down he already knows the answer right so when the X when he's in the Garden of Eden and Adam has stand and you know he's joined even the sin there in Genesis 3 here he comes down and you know he's he's a God would come down in the cooler even all the time and they would have Church he would come down they would they would have services and worshiping you know he'd just be just just enjoying the presence of his creation and I'm so this one day God shows up the church but Adam and Eve don't show him the Bible say that they heard the voice of God walking through the garden and when they heard God coming they took off the hot to go try to find some thick leaves and cover themselves now here you know when God that churchy like um I'm hearing search by myself I only created someone to people create it they supposed to be in church we're out of it so he just start yelling Adam kind of where art thou question Adam response thing on where we heard you coming and we you know we realize we was naked and we you know put this on the come here to church God said now here's a question who told you you were naked and he asks him another question did you eat of that tree that I told you not to eat from now he only answered one question and he didn't answer it directly Oh God see when he asked his question he interface he didn't tell him who told him he was naked but the part that he did answer he said this woman that you gave me she gave of me the tree and I ate now that's not that's not answer the question that's not answering the question so but he still let him go right on cuz God always got a plan his plan of redemption was that work but but here you know he he still goes why don't say not not so he just even looked at each day now and I could have imagined II just trembling just shaking can't believe Adam just put this on me like this you gonna leave me all out there by myself and they look at Eve and the first thing out of his mouth what is this thou has done Eve don't know what to say to the question she don't even answer these notice what her answer is say the serpent beguiled me and trick me and I ate of the fruit the next day come up into serpent he didn't even give a chance no questions asked to the serpent he was just cursed and put on his belly but if you notice the scripture they never answered God's questions now God knew if the God knew that God knew exactly where Adam was he knew he knew that they ate of that tree he knew everything that already happened in that guard that's why they were acting the way that they were acting because they thought something wrong God had the answer to his own questions he was waiting for them to repent that's how you want it just repent and come to me it will make this thing right they'd never even expected even know what they never even used the word sorry before that was a new vocabulary word I'm sorry you only say sorry after you've done something wrong imagine that question answers well their sons are born with the same old bad nature now and here comes Kane alone and God got a question for King these boys grow up they worship and they know they know how to praise God in art do all kind of things and they're bringing their fruit I'm in Cain's bringing this fruit and Abel's bringing his lamb and they coming both to worship God well Cain got jealous of Abel's offering because God accepted Abel's offering but did not accept Cain's offering when he accepted say he said I'm upset with this boy got so mad God came to him saying ìlook if you just giving the same thing your brother gave me I will accept it but you know it was not in came to give God that type of offering so resident Cain give God's offering Cain killed the man that was making the armor and God had a question King where's your brother that's the question guess what his answer was it was not an answer he answered with a question he said am I my brother's keeper yes you are and it says a brother's blood is calling out to me from out I know exactly what you've done you have killed your brother without a cause see God expects an answer when it gives us a question all the way back in the Garden of Eden you can see that these questions and answers was given I picked it up even in the New Testament but there was a Griffin that was he was asked the question there was an accusing Paul of wrong doings because Paul believed in the Lord Jesus that he had risen from the dead and Paul begin to share his testimony with Festus and Agrippa and as these were shared his testimony King Agrippa he's like me I think Agrippa believe what I'm saying I think he acts believing what I'm saying Oh God I like this I won't try to pull this one up acts 26 verse 27 and that's Paul was Paul was just kind of going through you know his his his his conversion experience on the road to Damascus and everything that happened he's just sharing his testimony now I'm sure not to declare the whole council about I'm telling you everything that happened Paul just speaking it and as he gets there he says I don't think a grip of my belief in this and he put Agrippa on the spot the accidental question King Agrippa believed it found the prophets believe it's down the prophets I know that they'll believe it now I like the way he did because the day I can access paying question y'all still believe the Prophet because because people have a problem with the Prophet now we don't want to quote the Prophet anymore right I mean but but I want to ask you Agrippa believe it's down to prophets huh believe it's out of prophets I know that thou believers then Agrippa said in Nepal almost I persuaded me to be a Christian wait a minute he did not answer the question the question was do you believe the prophets today you're gonna have to be able to give an answer to questions the Jews did not answer pilots question Matthew 27-23 just get that ready for me here they brought Jesus before Pilate listen you know we want this man to be crucified me ask them you know they said look it's this Passover season we always have a custom that we would release one of the prisoners to - you say not which prisoners do you want we got we got but Barabbas here we got him or you got Jesus which one do you want which one of you and I did together give us Barabbas a man that was a proven murderer we want Barabbas well as they took they took Barabbas there now what should I do with this Jesus what should I do they say crucify him crucify him crucify Jesus never done anything wrong but crucify him anyway where they actually questioned Matthew 27 23 Pilate asks a question the Bible said the governor said why when they yell that crucify me said why this is this question Why What evil has he done that's the question they never gave an answer but they cried out the more say and let him be crucified when God gives a question he's expecting an answer and oftentimes when you know what we're doing is trying to avoid the the answer right here a question was given by Pilate to the people of God but they avoided the answer what evil happy done not one person could stand up with an ass then tell us what evil Jesus had done but yet he died because God had a purpose and all things are working together for good to them that love God to him them who are the called according to his purpose let me also just state this and I'm getting ready to wind this up when we ask in God a question because we want an answer we need to understand that we got to come to God with the right approach or we're not going to get an answer I like this this is Matthew 22 42 through 46 these men the Pharisees Sadducees of that day they approaching the Lord Jesus they got all kind of questions and he he finally you know he gives them a answer that again they don't like it and he asked something sometimes you answer a question with a question that's just to shake the devil I want a Matthew Matthew 22 we're gonna we're going to read this one and then I got something else I want to read Oh my questions and answers glory to God Matthew 22 and I'm picking up verse 42 here in a second glory to God today right right before this they were asking them a question and tempting him asked him which you know which is the greatest commandment of law alright he was you know let's start at verse 34 let's pick up there these were where they were they were they were coming but you got to come with the right approach you just don't approach God any kind of weight if you want an answer to your question listen said but when the Pharisees that heard that they had put the Sadducees to silence they would gather together then one of them then one of them which was the lawyer asked him a question tempting understand master which is the Great Commandment in the law see the seven ham though shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and Great Commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets time here they thought they had done something because they heard the Sadducees to ask the question and Jesus put them to silence but 90 specially thought now we're going to show who we are but Jesus had a question for them look at it verse 41 says while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ whose son is he he wants an answer that's what they gave it to him the they say then the son of David and he 7 them how then duck David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my lord sit down my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool mind taking right back to scripture look said if David called him Lord how is he his son you got a question and unfortunate things they have no answer look at verse 46 and no man was able to answer him a word neither Durst any man from that day forth asked him any more questions but Jesus know how to put them right in my place and I want to tell you let me just first of all imitate it the reason that Jesus said that is because even though that he was broke the root and the offspring of David he knew that he knew exactly who he was so he can ask that question knowing that they cannot answer it now I want to tell you something because you know when I actually early you know I threw that a grip description there do you believe the process right we know we believe a prophet not people ask you questions but can I tell you something what the Bible say the Bible actually tells you to avoid foolish questions how you do that don't go to their websites bypass them huh people sending you crazy emails just don't respond to avoid foolish questions you find that in the book of Titus right so you know so I mean you know I was you know unfortunately you hear people that's just kind of you know doing all kind of things when it comes to this message and one one brother I feel so sorry for him but he made a comment that really blessed me because he's actually pulling away from the message but he made a comment before he pulled away that blessed me and the comment was you know that I dated and Cora rose up against the prophet Moses and the earth swallowed them he says and everybody today that's rising up against the gods proper today the world is swallowing death he made that point and then walked away I said Wow you know and I mean I let me even looked at the way the earth swallows the date of the course and now the world is swallowing those days walking with everybody that I've seen denounce this message in the right back in the world they can't even live holiness Katie to thank holiness this this this this adultery the truth is the only thing that can keep you but they get swallowed by the world you name it you just watch everybody that come out and make they make anytime you make it a proclamation you know it's the wrong spirit I'm gonna just say this you know homosexuals have to announce when they coming out the closet but ain't nobody got no announcement it's a boy it's a girl but when a boy trying to become a girl or a girl trying become a boy they have to make an announcement so you already know that's a rebellious spirit they soon I got to come out and say that I don't believe this no more no no that's a rebellious spirit start praying immediately do you Grippit do you believe the prophets Titus 3:9 will avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain so there's some questions that you should avoid when these Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus with these foolish questions he avoided them by throwing them a question that they couldn't answer and the Bible say no man asked them any more questions i'ma tell you haven't try helping people come out of some of the things with their questions that they get off the internet cuz mm and here's another one when everybody come tell you I've had these questions for so many years you already know that's that's rehearsed that's practice because everybody's saying the same thing and if you had no questions how come it's the first time I'm hearing about it you had these questions you got anointed by spirits that's all that happened and we're praying for you glory to God you didn't have these questions you got anointed by spirit now you got questions and what I found is that when you give them answers data and want the answer the reason they want answer because they want it to go to the world oh my god those look at the post I mean the the drinking and the everything else that's going on like the way they dress look at it you already know they swallowed up out of world well that's nothing new that happened to dated in chorus but not Nathan's children all right they escaped that all right you got approach got the right way because if you don't approach got the right way you will never get an answer to your question so it's the same way that people approach the website they're not approaching God the right way that's why they're not getting answer to the questions they not looking for an answer all right so it's my last cool brother branham Acts got he didn't ask God he really have a question they had a demand that didn't work and I'm gonna read it for you but brother Brando had a demand oh god me it's Oh God you owe me an explanation prophet said that that God God pretty much looked at the Prophet and say oh you what I owe you nothing and you don't approach me that way he had to put the Prophet back in his place and when he repented then God showed him something and when you repent God to show you something so we don't glorify the Prophet cuz he was just like us but I tell you what I thank God for how God used the man we glorify Christ let me just read this number I'm a close God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him look at this this that's this quote rather lengthy but I think he'd be a blessing to us there's one day I come on about four years ago or five something like that and this young girl which was about eight years old when she was on the crater roll she had been married and had two children and she was laying out the hospital here at the point of death she was about four months five with a baby and the baby it died and they couldn't operate because she had uremic and they couldn't operate so had to let they had to let the mother die to can't operate and see the baby would kill her like that so they she was just dying I saw it wasn't no chance for her I went out to see her she had said to me and I went into the hospital and there she was under oxygen tent I raised up that little flat talked to her a little bit and I said you remember me she said sure brother bill I remember you I said how do you understand how sick you are she said I do say that's why I said for you I said well why how is it with you and the Lord she said brother bill I'm not ready to go well they there we got down and praying the mother and a husband many of them in the room and a mother and husband started crying and I asked her if she got right with God paid her vows and come back and make God the promise that if she'd be forgiven how she loved him and sorry for her sins the way she lived and went on with her repentance of crime after a while I got up and went out of the building the next one they called me up to come back out there and come to find out they come in that morning for tests to see how the euralia condition had advanced and found out she didn't have a speck of it it was all gone every bit of do you remake poison had left her the doctors were so excited too they said my why this we are it's something very strange well we'll get it ready and if it's still that way by in the morning said we'll keep giving her penicillin or whatever they was giving her keeping the infections down so that will operate and take the dead baby before before it before it's set and something else that if she's all right then well two or three times that day they tested her again and that night late they tested her nothing Roma's perfectly all right and they prepped turn took her out from under the oxygen tent everything was fine they was going to operate on her the next morning take the baby well I went out there and because that this was done now I never knew it I never knew the Lord never told me nothing about it you could ask the people if you wish so they he never said it would but oh my I see such a thing her husband being a sinner come over and said brother branham I want to give my life to the Lord Jesus and I said alright just kneel down here and take a hold of your wife's hand and then you'll walk this straight life together the mother come back just that brother branham you know here's me and my children that we've all been in and out and in and out and around the tabernacle and things I want you to catch that we got families that do that we all been in and out and in and out and around this happened heckle we want we want pillar not people to be in and out and in and out around we want people to be pillars duck to the chairs like glue we sit and listen that you preached and we'll go up to the altar and come back so that I'm back slid to brother Branham just that well I want to I want to come back to the Lord Jesus for goodness to my child well you see that's very nice but you don't come to the Lord Jesus because of act alone towards midnight 12 1 o'clock a mother dozed off asleep as she said called her said mother she said yes honey what do you want she said you know I'm so happy she said I'm so glad of you being happy said I'm at peace with God and said oh how fine it is in a few minutes again she called back said mother say yes that I'm going home she said I know you are she said yes sweetheart said the doctor will take the baby tomorrow and then about a day or two when your incisions heal up and you get away from here you go you'll go back home and be happy again and you and you're helping the little children and be a Christian and live for God just that mother I mean I'm going to my heavenly home just that sure honey at the end of the journey she's that this is the end of the journey oh she said now what's the matter said the end of the journey so so said yes mother within a few minutes I'll be gone well she thought she had just got nervous and delirious she called the nurse the nurse taking a respiration everything was normal and within five minutes she was gone she was dead then when I come back home in a week or two after that I think brother Graham preached the girls funeral when I come back home and me too told me that that girl died that night my I couldn't I went to see mother yeah I don't know what caused me to do it but I said Lord God you old me and understand see after after me going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you've done these things for him and all like that and then take that girl's life like that I said you owe me an understanding you got to watch the way you approach God when you tell God something like that he'll leave you sitting alone he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well he just let me pound it out for a few days you know and after about three or four months one day I was I was out on a creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and why you went out there then I got down and cried I said Lord Jesus forgive me you put your poor stupid servant I should have never said that Lord and I went back down to the lady she lived over here over here on Market Street and when I went over to her and I said I want to ask you a question she says sure brother bill so is it true that this girl almost drowned she said that's right brother branham said her husband and they had to get her out of the creek and said they had to use artificial respiration upon pressure and they they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her said she had her skirt on they was having a picnic she was out there stepped in some sand slipped off over here slipped off overhead and sprinkled in the water they didn't notice her and directly they seen her coming up and going down and he run in and got her and brought her out and said she almost died said I said that was her time to go see God knows what he's doing now the Lord probably would have told me that if I hadn't taken that attitude that I did Lord you told me to tell me about that he don't owe you nothing still in the meeting one night and heard evangels praying for a sick person said God I command you to heal this person who command God see it isn't even intelligent because that's God he does when he wants to can the clay sink to the potter why did you make me thus see certainly not but if the prophet will keep still and then seek the Lord for the answer there's the answer there see just just like on this person was asking the search big questions he just watched don't be in a big hurry then how God always brings it to pass to work together for for good to them that love the Lord I tell you I thank God for that I was just listening to marriage and divorce this weekend there is a statement on their brother Brandon was talking about this man that was asking a question about the surplus feed and he said you know if you stand that the original sin was adultery between Eve and the serpent then where's that animal he asks the Prophet where's that animal the brother branham just began to talk to us like oh brother maybe it is that the animal is extinct you know maybe it is possible that the animal is extinct that's probably you know why we don't know where it is but we know it stood on two feet back at the beginning but if you know he's like no brother branham if that was the original sin that that animals got the video today where is the animal it just kept going say I know he was asking the question he wanted that hold the spirit told the prophets they tell them is here relevance I don't even know how to tell them I know how to answer the question so I just told them by by inspiration see it's here and say it's here well where is it they say it was cursed and put on this belly so that that snake that you see running on his belly that's the serpent that was here at the beginning that was the answer to the man's question tell you what if we approach God the right way we'll always get an answer to that question but make sure you approaching him the right way the Prophet just approached him the wrong way but when God when he finally got calmed down and God can show him something then they saw that latest time that come a year before she passed sometimes we want to know about different things God has an answer to the question but get your heart right where you can hear God's answer sometimes you hear the answer you don't want to hear it but it's still a correct answer you have to accept it questions answers god bless you [Applause] savvy musicians come while we just bow our head in the word of Prayer does Solomon also if you could come I'll just turn the service over to You Father we're grateful for the word of the Lord thank you God for truth that just because our hearts the Bible tells us that we will know the truth and the truth will make us free sometimes we have questions that we just don't understand we don't we don't we don't know what the answer is but God you always have the answer and if we could just learn to yield to you then we will we will see God what your purpose of antennas things are working together for good god that's what your word tells us and if it's true so help us God to extend even when it's going against our favor help us to accept that you're it's working together for good so we pray Lord Jesus if there's any questions in here today that you would bring the answer sometimes I wonder why we had to go through this and why we have to go through that God you know you know the reason why for everything and you never make a mistake but also help us to realize that when Satan is fighting us on every hand he is blocking us from a planting so all we got to do is keep pressing persevering going through it knowing that you got would give us victory in the end we glorified it we exalt you in praise you and we thank you for who you are too and what you have done for us what you continue to do and what you're doing now said Jesus Christ's name that we pray amen amen can we give the Lord a hand of
