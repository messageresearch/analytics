[46:15] for this um
[46:19] privilege we have to read the word and
[46:20] we trust oh god that

[46:40] that you would meet each one in their
[46:42] respective expectations and uh god we've
[46:45] felt your anointing through the worship
[46:48] and now lord as we
[46:49] uh as we enter into the word may we feel
[46:51] that same anointing
[46:53] and i want to pray for all the saints of

[47:28] detail on this mic
[47:30] sometimes i just need you to mute it for
[47:32] me just all i want to do is just mute it
[47:35] and then uh to set it back up because
[47:38] um hey man i i got a little something a
[47:41] little drainage
[47:42] right so i don't like to blow my nose in
[47:44] the mic
[47:47] just mute it so then everybody ain't a
[47:49] listening to all that you get you get
[47:51] what i'm saying
[47:52] amen hallelujah sometimes you know
[47:56] people can't hear the word
[47:57] because they're just looking at you know
[47:59] man he's he's going through up there i
[48:01] ain't going through
[48:02] amen amen i ain't going through i got
[48:05] victory
[48:06] praise the name of the lord amen so just
[48:10] give me one second here
[48:38] we want to um
[48:41] continue our journey through the seventh
[48:44] junction
[48:44] we started this a few weeks ago and uh
[48:48] want to come back to it
[48:51] when i started this i was mentioning
[48:55] that um
[48:58] it's let's see here i think i might have
[49:01] this
[49:02] um
[49:06] yeah um so i was mentioning
[49:09] i mentioned a quote where brother random
[49:11] say the world is climaxing in a cr
[49:13] in a great drama and
[49:16] um climaxing
[49:19] and a great drama and as we were going
[49:22] through
[49:23] this um the seven
[49:26] junctions brother branham said he saw
[49:28] seven that he could identify in
[49:29] scripture these were things that
[49:30] actually
[49:31] would uh change the course of the world
[49:36] uh different events that happened in the
[49:38] bible that would just really really
[49:42] be significant amen to to where we are
[49:45] right now that's what we mean by by a
[49:48] junction
[49:48] a turn was made uh we can say even god
[49:52] himself kind of made a turn as he began
[49:53] to deal with mankind in particular ways
[49:56] uh but the first one that brother
[49:58] branham identified what would have been
[50:00] noah and the ark and i was sharing
[50:02] with this great drama is as if you were
[50:04] standing there
[50:05] uh looking at a play and uh
[50:08] and then the the curtains open up and
[50:12] when the curtains open
[50:13] up somebody steps out and they start
[50:15] doing some things and the first person
[50:16] that comes out is noah and his ark
[50:19] and you're looking at this and and as
[50:21] you're looking at especially if you look
[50:22] at it from a scripture
[50:24] perspective you knew that there was
[50:25] destruction
[50:27] that occurred in the land right and uh i
[50:30] mean
[50:30] a great flood came because of the sin
[50:33] problem that we had in the earth and
[50:35] there were multiple issues
[50:37] you know and noah's day and and and and
[50:41] and you know one of one of the primary
[50:43] issues is that
[50:44] marriage and divorce marriage and
[50:46] divorce marriage and divorce
[50:47] you can see the stress and everything
[50:49] that was upon marriages
[50:51] and jesus told us that as it was
[50:54] in the days of noah so shall it be in
[50:57] the coming of the son of man
[50:58] and and let me just drop that off amen
[51:01] to to
[51:02] all the marriages you got to stand guard
[51:05] the devil is against your marriage the
[51:08] devil
[51:08] hates your marriage the devil wants to
[51:12] make your marriage
[51:12] another statistic amen another
[51:16] failed marriage that's what satan wants
[51:18] to do so you have to stand guard
[51:21] you have to watch it it's a spirit
[51:24] that is coming against your marriage and
[51:27] the only way you can
[51:28] you can survive it you're gonna have to
[51:29] use the the the strategy of prayer
[51:33] hallelujah i want to tell you this right
[51:35] now it's not
[51:36] enough psychiatrists out there to deal
[51:39] with the marital problems to keep things
[51:41] together but prayer
[51:43] prayer can keep everything together
[51:46] prayer causes you to sacrifice yourself
[51:49] prayer caused you to sacrifice your
[51:51] thoughts and don't always pray that god
[51:53] would change your mate
[51:55] ask god to change you
[51:58] give me strength god amen you brought me
[52:01] together for a reason
[52:04] help me just endure till we get through
[52:06] this
[52:07] right but but that's that's the spirit
[52:09] that was coming against the people in
[52:11] that land
[52:12] uh that day so jesus said it would be it
[52:14] would repeat again today
[52:16] so we see um the the scene closed
[52:20] it looked like the world has been
[52:21] destroyed because of
[52:23] of this great flood but when the scene
[52:25] closes god opens it up again
[52:28] and when when it opens up again we see
[52:31] uh moses and the children of israel
[52:33] coming out on stage
[52:34] and all the great events that happened
[52:37] uh there
[52:37] as moses was the prophet to that second
[52:41] uh junction and and all the great
[52:43] miracles the
[52:44] the the plagues and all that that struck
[52:46] and and death that struck the land
[52:48] and my what uh what a a powerful
[52:52] demonstration of the the the power of
[52:55] god
[52:56] uh here we see the uh the red sea
[52:59] opening up
[53:01] and we know it could be nobody else but
[53:03] god
[53:04] opening water like that hallelujah
[53:07] sometimes we have red seas in our own
[53:09] life
[53:11] and mama can't open it daddy can't
[53:14] open it brother and sister can't open it
[53:16] amen but when god
[53:18] opens that thing up you begin to walk
[53:20] through on dry ground
[53:22] hallelujah amen we thank god for the
[53:24] supernatural that was done there but god
[53:28] wasn't finished yet
[53:30] scene closes and brother brandon say
[53:32] abraham and lock come walking out
[53:35] amen and now we look at this and abraham
[53:38] being the prophet for that generation
[53:40] hallelujah
[53:41] god revealing the secret things to
[53:44] abraham and we are abraham's
[53:47] sea and in this hour god is revealing
[53:51] i can't help that god didn't come to
[53:54] your tent
[53:57] that that ain't got nothing to do with
[53:58] me hallelujah that he didn't come to
[54:01] your tent but he showed up
[54:03] at my tent and since she showed up at my
[54:07] tent i'm gonna do something to satisfy
[54:09] him
[54:10] sarah gets tough ready we got to feed
[54:12] god
[54:14] hallelujah amen we got fellowship with
[54:17] god
[54:18] he gonna reveal secrets to us
[54:23] but there was a great problem in that
[54:24] day and the reason that god was there
[54:28] is to bring two things one was a promise
[54:31] that he made to sarah
[54:34] oh i feel jesus in this place
[54:37] because sarah was barren couldn't have
[54:41] children glory to god but he was there
[54:43] to manifest
[54:44] a promise to sarah i said
[54:48] sarah thy wife will have a child
[54:52] hallelujah and one day sarah moved from
[54:55] a promise to a manifestation one day
[54:58] sarah stepped into a vision and i
[55:01] believe we come to a time where the
[55:03] church has also
[55:04] got to step into the vision
[55:10] sarah was there to receive her promise
[55:12] but also there was a problem going on
[55:14] down in
[55:15] in sodom and gomorrah and god come down
[55:19] with
[55:19] investigating angels of judgment amen to
[55:22] see exactly what was happening
[55:26] before he destroyed the lamb he said uh
[55:29] abraham i want to tell you what i'm
[55:31] about to do
[55:32] now now it's a promise to sarah she get
[55:36] ready to give birth to a promised son
[55:38] but it's destruction to to the people of
[55:41] sodom and gomorrah
[55:42] i want you to think about that we could
[55:44] be on the revival
[55:45] of florida rain a spiritual rain you
[55:48] know what the florida rain is it could
[55:50] be raining on this side
[55:51] and ain't no rain on that side hey it
[55:54] could be raining in this church
[55:56] and ain't no rain in that church we
[55:59] underneath a florida
[56:00] spiritual reign hallelujah
[56:06] glory to god but by here he said now i'm
[56:09] visiting sarah with this promise at the
[56:11] time of life she gotta have the promised
[56:12] son
[56:13] but i'm also going down here to destroy
[56:16] sodom and gomorrah
[56:17] and the reason he was going to destroy
[56:19] him is because of the problem
[56:21] with amen homosexuality
[56:26] this is just bible and what jesus said
[56:30] in his words
[56:31] as it was in the days of lot
[56:35] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[56:38] of man
[56:40] so i i you know we can't sympathize with
[56:43] sin
[56:45] sin is still sin and god gonna judge the
[56:48] world of sin
[56:50] he's gonna judge homosexuals he's gonna
[56:52] judge adulterers
[56:54] he's gonna judge liars he gonna judge
[56:57] sin
[57:02] we don't compromise with liars we don't
[57:04] compromise with adulterers
[57:06] we don't compromise with homosexuals we
[57:08] don't compromise with sin
[57:10] he gonna judge people living together
[57:12] not being married
[57:15] anything else you can think of he gonna
[57:17] judge
[57:19] can we go further but this was the
[57:21] problem of that day so
[57:23] you know here destruction comes solomon
[57:26] gomorrah
[57:27] sin closes but god is not done
[57:31] it's going to open up again the curtain
[57:33] and this time
[57:34] we have elijah and the 450 prophets of
[57:36] baal
[57:38] the children of israel so confused they
[57:39] don't know which god to serve
[57:42] jezebel got them in a real really bad
[57:45] condition
[57:46] actually the reason they are where they
[57:48] are with jezebel's because they fear her
[57:52] this lady ain't got no respect for
[57:54] nobody she killed prophets
[57:58] this lady would kill prophets she i mean
[58:00] she's gonna try to silence every voice
[58:02] she can
[58:03] right but she couldn't get to elijah
[58:06] hallelujah god will hide elijah way
[58:09] and church we don't have to fear
[58:10] anything listen
[58:12] jezebel represented the government
[58:16] we ain't got to fear nothing god will
[58:18] hide this pride away
[58:24] elijah comes and he challenges said now
[58:26] look let the goddamn ass about fire
[58:28] let him be god and here you know he said
[58:32] you know we tired of y'all
[58:33] uh you know you you got bail on this
[58:35] side you got god on this side now let
[58:36] the god answer my father forget this
[58:38] we're going to set this thing once and
[58:39] for all and when god came down and asked
[58:41] about fire
[58:42] elijah himself took care of them false
[58:44] prophets
[58:46] but even after he got rid of all the
[58:47] false prophets jezebel said he won't
[58:49] live by this time tomorrow
[58:52] he won't live by this time tomorrow i i
[58:54] i get him for getting forgetting my
[58:56] prophets
[58:58] elijah took off running hallelujah god
[59:00] met him in a little cave
[59:02] and that still small void spoke to him
[59:05] while he was in the cave
[59:06] hallelujah and there he was given some
[59:08] instructions and
[59:09] and and i loved i loved that because
[59:12] when elijah was
[59:13] found himself in a place of
[59:15] discouragement
[59:16] god thought that was a perfect
[59:18] opportunity to give him an assignment
[59:24] elijah found himself in a place of
[59:26] discouragement
[59:28] but god thought that was a perfect
[59:29] opportunity to give him an assignment
[59:34] so i want i want you to get it when you
[59:36] find yourself in a
[59:38] a good place of discouragement this
[59:41] happened that happened i feel
[59:42] discouraged
[59:43] it's god the tender hand
[59:47] of jehovah that's coming to give you an
[59:50] assignment
[59:55] that's our god oh he's a loving god
[1:00:00] hallelujah but here you know after this
[1:00:02] great demonstration of the power of god
[1:00:04] the scene closes
[1:00:07] but it opens back up and brother branham
[1:00:08] tells us the fifth juncture is when
[1:00:10] jesus christ himself
[1:00:12] comes walking out and uh my what a
[1:00:15] junction that was uh
[1:00:16] uh uh i mean a great
[1:00:20] junction but not the greatest
[1:00:23] it was a great junction when jesus came
[1:00:26] on the scene
[1:00:28] and and what words can we use to express
[1:00:31] uh what we feel about our savior what we
[1:00:34] feel about our lord what we feel about
[1:00:36] our master
[1:00:37] oh church it means so much to me you
[1:00:39] know people say let's just preach jesus
[1:00:42] every time i'm preaching i'm preaching
[1:00:45] jesus glory if i'm sharing your
[1:00:48] testimony
[1:00:49] it's because jesus gave you the
[1:00:51] testimony
[1:00:53] if i share brother branham's testimony
[1:00:55] it's because jesus gave him
[1:00:56] the testimony every time i preach i'm
[1:00:59] preaching
[1:01:00] jesus oh hallelujah
[1:01:04] you got to just know where he's working
[1:01:06] and how he's working
[1:01:08] amen amen you got to recognize those
[1:01:10] things but
[1:01:11] when our lord and savior came uh he he
[1:01:14] left us thrown in glory to bring to us
[1:01:16] redemption story
[1:01:18] i mean there went to a cross and died
[1:01:20] for our sins
[1:01:21] and and did not just die but he rose
[1:01:23] again that's what separates christianity
[1:01:25] from any other faith
[1:01:27] the god that we serve he lived in flesh
[1:01:31] amen and i mean it's a god that would
[1:01:34] die for us
[1:01:35] who wouldn't want to serve a god like
[1:01:37] this hallelujah
[1:01:39] right so so so christianity amen
[1:01:41] received his birth when jesus comes on
[1:01:44] the scene
[1:01:44] blessed be the name of the lord but but
[1:01:46] but after he died and after he rose
[1:01:48] again
[1:01:49] you would think that would be the climax
[1:01:51] but it wasn't
[1:01:52] because the curtains are closed amen and
[1:01:55] out amen now when the curtains reopen
[1:01:57] we go to the sixth junction and here
[1:01:59] comes martin luther and john wesley with
[1:02:02] with messages of of justification and
[1:02:04] sanctification it
[1:02:06] shook the world it changed the way that
[1:02:08] we uh we thought about how we lived
[1:02:10] as christians we thank god for these
[1:02:12] ministries that god used and
[1:02:14] and one day they they they message came
[1:02:16] to an end they went off the scene the
[1:02:18] curtain closed
[1:02:20] and we get to the same junction now the
[1:02:23] curtain
[1:02:24] opens and who do we see
[1:02:29] well i can tell you who i see
[1:02:32] glory glory i see you
[1:02:36] i see me i i see the prophet
[1:02:40] i see us all on the stage at this time
[1:02:43] glory in everything that's going on in
[1:02:45] your life
[1:02:46] amen is already acting out what god had
[1:02:49] in his mind hey
[1:02:50] can i tell you something you are not a
[1:02:52] mistake
[1:02:54] you're not making a mistake didn't
[1:02:56] brother gene tell y'all last week
[1:02:58] all things are working together for good
[1:03:01] i thought it was just a beautiful
[1:03:02] confirmation when brother brother gene
[1:03:04] was talking about
[1:03:05] david and he was talking about the
[1:03:07] prodigal son exactly the same thing i
[1:03:09] was preaching in arkansas
[1:03:12] that was the supernatural god
[1:03:15] vindicating his presence here
[1:03:17] so it's not a mistake church all things
[1:03:20] are working together for good
[1:03:22] your sickness is an opportunity for god
[1:03:24] to get some glory
[1:03:27] your way with son and wave with
[1:03:29] daughters an opportunity for god to get
[1:03:31] some glory
[1:03:32] the story about the prodigal son would
[1:03:34] have never been written had the man
[1:03:36] never went away and come back home
[1:03:38] we needed to get encouragement from that
[1:03:40] story that's why god allowed that thing
[1:03:43] to happen
[1:03:44] everything that's happening in your life
[1:03:46] it has a purpose
[1:03:50] brother brother brother troy when he's
[1:03:51] preaching on on uh
[1:03:53] the tender hand of jehovah he starts
[1:03:56] sharing a testimony
[1:03:58] and how god delivered him from some
[1:03:59] things but you know what
[1:04:01] he would if he had not gone through
[1:04:04] those things
[1:04:05] he would have never been able to speak
[1:04:06] to them guys the way he spoke to him in
[1:04:08] the back back there
[1:04:10] that was no mistake and he i just love
[1:04:13] how
[1:04:13] cool calm and collective he was
[1:04:16] collected he was
[1:04:17] i mean he said just kind of walk parked
[1:04:19] his truck in in the middle of him
[1:04:21] let him know he's there and they knew it
[1:04:23] so they started talking to him a little
[1:04:25] bit and then
[1:04:26] they they just kind of he wasn't going
[1:04:27] to say nothing but now when you open up
[1:04:29] the door i'ma push the door
[1:04:32] down and he start coming in and start
[1:04:35] sharing his testimony
[1:04:37] see now i i don't have the same
[1:04:39] testimony
[1:04:40] so it wouldn't have been effective but
[1:04:42] but he was able to just go right where
[1:04:43] they were
[1:04:44] and a seed was planted and when you
[1:04:47] really think about it you're not even
[1:04:49] supposed to be next to a church even
[1:04:50] doing that
[1:04:54] but i got what we call the holy ghost
[1:04:56] police
[1:04:58] that'll go after you a seed was planned
[1:05:00] i don't think the young man would ever
[1:05:01] be the same again
[1:05:04] see god uses your what you think is your
[1:05:07] failures
[1:05:08] god uses it for his glory
[1:05:13] all right they say god will take your
[1:05:14] mess and make a message out of it
[1:05:18] all right so here we are we're on the
[1:05:19] scene
[1:05:21] this seven junction is the greatest of
[1:05:24] all
[1:05:24] junctions amen this junction is
[1:05:27] uh considered the second coming of the
[1:05:29] lord
[1:05:30] uh i've mentioned to you all that at
[1:05:32] every junction of time god sends forth
[1:05:35] prophets
[1:05:36] angels and he gives a warning and we
[1:05:37] know the prophet that came in this
[1:05:39] junction was
[1:05:40] william marion branham he was the
[1:05:41] prophet uh you know uh he says god
[1:05:44] always takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:05:46] that the omnipotence still lives and
[1:05:49] reigns
[1:05:50] we must have the miraculous we've been
[1:05:52] talking about this throughout all
[1:05:54] uh the sermons on the junction and i'm
[1:05:56] just going to read just a couple things
[1:05:57] here
[1:05:58] and um and then i'm i'm going to just
[1:06:00] kind of slip into something if i can
[1:06:02] oh i forgot to set my timer
[1:06:07] uh give me a second here um
[1:06:10] and i i i i know i've been up here for a
[1:06:13] little bit but y'all just
[1:06:14] bear with me i want to go this quote out
[1:06:16] of junction of time
[1:06:18] paragraph e4
[1:06:21] praise the lord
[1:06:27] how long y'all say i've been up here
[1:06:28] about about 15 minutes

[1:06:40] the house of god i love you all i love
[1:06:44] you all so much

[1:06:46] spirit and truth tabernacles
[1:06:48] i really appreciate amen this fellowship
[1:06:51] uh but here the prophet says my subject
[1:06:53] this morning
[1:06:54] if we should call it such would be the
[1:06:56] message to the church the junction of
[1:06:57] time
[1:06:58] it says that always in the days gone by
[1:07:00] the dispensations has always come to
[1:07:02] their end
[1:07:03] and we hit a junction there's junctions
[1:07:06] on
[1:07:06] that oh that's not where i want to be
[1:07:08] i'll ke i'll read it while i'm there
[1:07:10] there's junction on the highways the
[1:07:11] junction on the roads that we travel
[1:07:13] in this world they junction on this
[1:07:15] grand old highway that we travel to
[1:07:16] glory
[1:07:16] and always it takes the miraculous to
[1:07:19] speak of omnipotence omnipotence is the
[1:07:21] all-powerful
[1:07:22] and it takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:07:25] the omnipotence now you know let me just
[1:07:27] inject there really quick
[1:07:29] um i i mentioned god gave us this thing
[1:07:34] at the very beginning of the year and uh
[1:07:37] and and i in the church we had we had a
[1:07:39] merge of two churches
[1:07:41] amen and i thought it was very
[1:07:43] appropriate for the holy spirit to just
[1:07:44] kind of settle us
[1:07:45] on this thought at the beginning of the
[1:07:47] year because all
[1:07:48] all both churches went through a
[1:07:51] junction
[1:07:52] amen and you know we were warned
[1:07:56] amen by a dream that be careful what
[1:07:59] decision you make
[1:08:01] at the junction oh hallelujah i got to
[1:08:04] go back into all this if y'all don't
[1:08:06] mind
[1:08:06] amen we're warm by a dream be careful
[1:08:09] what decision you make at the junction
[1:08:11] because all of us are here at a junction
[1:08:13] this hap this is more spiritual than you
[1:08:16] realize
[1:08:19] not just somebody just coming to a fault
[1:08:22] right hey man you know uh it took a
[1:08:26] harley davidson
[1:08:31] to to generate this you understand what
[1:08:33] i'm saying
[1:08:34] that the church in okeechobee still be
[1:08:36] gone had the building not been bought
[1:08:39] 20 something years right that was the
[1:08:42] hand of god that did that
[1:08:45] oh my and and i'm convinced that it was
[1:08:49] god
[1:08:50] right because i'm watching even you know
[1:08:52] i i
[1:08:53] just take that down just for a second
[1:08:54] i'm trying to get get to
[1:08:56] something here but i i can't get in
[1:08:58] there but but i'm convinced that it was
[1:09:00] god because
[1:09:01] amen in this junction miraculous things
[1:09:05] are supposed to happen
[1:09:07] and i've been watching amen brother

[1:09:17] supernatural i mean
[1:09:20] we've been friends for a long time
[1:09:22] brother-in-law for years

[1:09:25] things happen
[1:09:27] what is going on here my brother

[1:10:00] and i share what i say i know i know uh
[1:10:03] uh at 75 years old
[1:10:05] you know maybe we would think that god
[1:10:06] has a limit on what
[1:10:08] age you can be to get healed but god
[1:10:10] don't set no age limit on healing
[1:10:13] if a 90 year old woman can have a baby
[1:10:21] then a 75 year old woman can get up and
[1:10:23] walk
[1:10:25] praise god that's the god that we serve
[1:10:31] while we went to pray for her you know
[1:10:33] we're just sitting there praying and our
[1:10:34] brother brother kraku have just come

[1:10:57] alone for the ride that's all just alone
[1:11:01] it was not planned it was not
[1:11:04] it was not uh uh conjured up
[1:11:08] we just went to pray and while we
[1:11:10] praying
[1:11:11] a rumbling began to happen and we
[1:11:13] started noticing that what's going on
[1:11:15] here
[1:11:15] and brother smiley just just start
[1:11:17] speaking in tongues right there
[1:11:19] now now i'm like now after it was done i
[1:11:21] said brother i know you had the gift to
[1:11:23] talk to i don't i
[1:11:24] i ain't no i had it either supernatural
[1:11:26] things happen
[1:11:28] at the junction
[1:11:31] while we're in arkansas brother smiley
[1:11:33] was preaching
[1:11:35] and um while he's preaching and just
[1:11:38] being himself nothing nothing you know
[1:11:40] just the same brother smiley we know but
[1:11:42] while he's there
[1:11:43] a vision begins to show begin to be
[1:11:46] shown to him while he's preaching
[1:11:48] if the vision was so vivid that he said
[1:11:50] i can't i can't not i can't do nothing
[1:11:52] with this he turned and just gave the
[1:11:53] mic to the past
[1:11:56] he kind of stepped away from the vision
[1:11:59] but the pastors say oh
[1:12:00] before you gave me that mic you had
[1:12:02] already called out the exact situation
[1:12:06] that a man had come to my house
[1:12:08] everything the man said
[1:12:10] you said it back to him in the pulpit
[1:12:12] and it was the only time that brother
[1:12:14] had come to church that night
[1:12:16] after a whole year
[1:12:19] that night brother brother brother
[1:12:20] brother smiling picked up the whole
[1:12:22] conversation
[1:12:22] and preached it out and and all they
[1:12:25] could look at they say oh
[1:12:26] this is the hand of god the supernatural
[1:12:30] god is on the scene
[1:12:37] you know we you know i'm talking about
[1:12:40] this let me let me let me come back
[1:12:41] let me come back here because i got i
[1:12:43] got some more to share uh let me go back
[1:12:45] to this quote let me just kind of finish
[1:12:48] this
[1:12:59] so the prophet say um always takes the
[1:13:02] miraculous to speak of omnipotence
[1:13:04] omnipotence is all-powerful
[1:13:06] and it takes a miraculous to vindicate
[1:13:08] the omnipotence
[1:13:09] and only the miraculous can do that
[1:13:12] teaching of the word is a very fine
[1:13:14] thing
[1:13:15] it says and it comes faith comes by
[1:13:17] hearing and hearing the word
[1:13:18] but it always takes the miraculous to
[1:13:20] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:13:22] lives and reigns
[1:13:23] we must have the miraculous
[1:13:26] now you know i i've been i've been
[1:13:28] reading this just about every time i
[1:13:30] preach on this junction
[1:13:31] because i i can go through each and
[1:13:34] every junction show the miraculous
[1:13:36] that's happened in everybody's ministry
[1:13:38] but if you're on the stage i got to be
[1:13:41] able to show them a rock that's
[1:13:42] happening with you
[1:13:44] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:46] forever i got to be able to show him
[1:13:48] happening in you
[1:13:52] so i'm gonna just do that right i was
[1:13:55] gonna
[1:13:56] take some time and go through brother
[1:13:57] branham and
[1:13:59] and and his ministry and everything like
[1:14:01] that but y'all already know that
[1:14:02] i'm preaching to believers believers
[1:14:06] glory to god we know god used this
[1:14:08] prophet but let me just try to pick up
[1:14:11] amen a little thought here oh
[1:14:14] jesus jesus jesus my god
[1:14:18] all right um
[1:14:21] there was a statement made by the
[1:14:24] prophet
[1:14:25] i i when i preached on the on the fifth
[1:14:27] junction i talked about the 39 miracles
[1:14:29] of jesus but i didn't go through all 39
[1:14:31] miracles
[1:14:32] but i want to just show something amen
[1:14:34] and brother branham's ministry here
[1:14:36] uh the token if we'll go to that message
[1:14:38] the token
[1:14:42] just bear with me amen i got some
[1:14:45] things i want to share got to go back
[1:14:48] pick up some things
[1:14:49] got to come forward put it all together
[1:14:52] if we can but let's just look at
[1:14:53] something that the prophet said here
[1:14:55] 39 miracles that i said about jesus
[1:14:58] but here in the message to token the
[1:15:00] prophet said now being in that

[1:15:32] now um you say that that's the thing
[1:15:35] that puts him out
[1:15:36] cause in him there is no such wish i
[1:15:39] could testify
[1:15:41] a little bit now to some things i've
[1:15:43] seen happen
[1:15:44] just in the last few weeks i'm gonna
[1:15:46] testify
[1:15:48] but i'm just setting you up with a quote
[1:15:50] wish i could testify
[1:15:52] amen a little bit now to some things
[1:15:54] i've seen happen just in the last few
[1:15:56] weeks see
[1:15:57] oh what i could testify of
[1:16:00] you know and luke said if all jesus done
[1:16:04] will be put in books there wasn't enough
[1:16:07] books in the world
[1:16:08] to write them just what i've seen
[1:16:13] in my own ministry seeing him done you
[1:16:16] couldn't pile the volumes on this
[1:16:18] platform here
[1:16:19] if i wrote it in details what i seen him
[1:16:21] do just in my own ministry seeing him do
[1:16:23] it now one brother brandon doing it was
[1:16:25] christ doing it
[1:16:26] amen he said seen him do it he had more
[1:16:29] success
[1:16:30] in my ministry than he did in his home
[1:16:35] now i remember i said yeah i'm talking
[1:16:37] about 39 miracles of jesus
[1:16:39] but brother branham say he had more
[1:16:41] success in my ministry
[1:16:42] a man that can yield himself to god
[1:16:46] god had more success in his ministry
[1:16:49] than he did in his home
[1:16:53] now now i i don't want to leave it at
[1:16:54] the prophet i want to bring it to you
[1:16:57] because you're on the stage
[1:16:58] god will have more success in your
[1:17:02] ministry
[1:17:03] than he did with his own if you could
[1:17:05] just heal yourself
[1:17:08] the works that i do say you do also
[1:17:12] that's his word that's a promise from
[1:17:16] jesus
[1:17:20] hallelujah we in the word church
[1:17:23] all right he says now remember he had
[1:17:24] more success now not me
[1:17:26] he had glory it says hallelujah he had
[1:17:29] more success in jeffersonville
[1:17:31] than he did in nazareth he did it in
[1:17:34] that wicked city and this wicked city
[1:17:36] amen glory because he could perform no
[1:17:38] miracles there but he did here
[1:17:40] he finally broke through here
[1:17:44] i want that to be our testimony he
[1:17:46] finally
[1:17:47] broke through here i mean i've been
[1:17:50] trying to get certain things to
[1:17:53] to churches for years
[1:17:56] amen but he's finally trying to find a
[1:17:58] place that he can break through and the
[1:18:00] fullness of his glory
[1:18:02] can be poured out i want that to be our
[1:18:05] testimony
[1:18:06] that he finally broke through here
[1:18:09] everything is in order the way the
[1:18:11] prophet said it's supposed to be
[1:18:13] oh glory to god glory to god glory to
[1:18:17] god
[1:18:18] amen he finally broke through here i say
[1:18:21] yes lord yes
[1:18:22] he got it done here
[1:18:26] amen he might have to have to get people
[1:18:28] somewhere else
[1:18:29] but he got it done anyhow so he had more
[1:18:32] success right here than he did
[1:18:34] uh than he did um uh
[1:18:37] in capernaum or nazareth and that how he
[1:18:40] done more miracles right here in this
[1:18:43] tabernacle than he did in the in the
[1:18:45] entire ministry on earth that's right he
[1:18:48] did it now what about the rest of the
[1:18:50] world
[1:18:51] glory oh my now that's what he done now
[1:18:54] remember he done
[1:18:55] it never said i done it amen no
[1:18:58] because i didn't do it i just didn't i
[1:19:00] just loved him and just submitted myself
[1:19:02] to him
[1:19:03] and said what he said and the holy
[1:19:04] spirit went to the other people and they
[1:19:06] believed what he said
[1:19:07] and then then he done the work that's
[1:19:09] all if he can get all of us believing it
[1:19:12] what would he do right now if he can get
[1:19:15] all of us believing it right now
[1:19:17] right not just believing it but
[1:19:19] believing it right
[1:19:21] amen there wouldn't be a feeble person
[1:19:23] around the town
[1:19:24] that's right if he could get everybody
[1:19:26] to believe it it'll all be over see
[1:19:29] hold your token over your unmovable
[1:19:31] faith in his promised word
[1:19:33] satan will go i read that quote and we
[1:19:36] had a prayer line
[1:19:38] amen a few weeks ago and and uh and
[1:19:41] and i just believe god moved in that uh
[1:19:44] in a very very special way but
[1:19:46] i wanted to just try to go back and just
[1:19:48] kind of share because this you know to
[1:19:49] me
[1:19:50] uh when we're reading acts 2 i was i was
[1:19:53] just
[1:19:53] always struck by brother branham
[1:19:57] choosing that scripture to preach the
[1:20:00] junctions
[1:20:01] why would he read acts 2 what was the
[1:20:04] purpose of reading acts 2 and
[1:20:05] i just couldn't i couldn't i couldn't
[1:20:08] understand it
[1:20:10] as a minister you know you try to follow
[1:20:12] certain things when another preacher is
[1:20:14] preaching you try to follow his thoughts
[1:20:15] saying now why did he pick up that
[1:20:16] scripture
[1:20:17] for that because the minister looking
[1:20:18] look is looking for inspiration off that
[1:20:20] same scripture maybe he can preach a
[1:20:21] sermon from it
[1:20:23] right so when i when i saw brother
[1:20:24] branham pick up acts 2 and start
[1:20:26] preaching from that about the drunks of
[1:20:28] time say well where did he get that from
[1:20:31] but i think what he was trying to
[1:20:32] emphasize was the supernatural
[1:20:34] that's supposed to happen at the
[1:20:36] junctions
[1:20:38] and here if we are in the seventh
[1:20:39] junction then we should see the
[1:20:41] supernatural
[1:20:42] now what did the what did the scripture
[1:20:44] say let's go back in this
[1:20:45] just look at that amen acts 2 verse 16.
[1:20:50] uh peter had to just kind of straighten
[1:20:52] him up on a little bit he says this is
[1:20:55] this is that which was spoken by the
[1:20:57] prophet joel so joel 2 actually speaks
[1:21:00] to these things joel prophesied
[1:21:02] and now they're they're actually in the
[1:21:04] midst of a manifestation of what joel
[1:21:06] prophesied and if i if i could just
[1:21:08] borrow those words again
[1:21:10] we are also in the midst of a
[1:21:11] manifestation of what joel
[1:21:14] prophesied it says look it says
[1:21:17] verse 17 and it shall come to pass in
[1:21:20] the last days saith god
[1:21:22] i will pour out of my spirit upon all
[1:21:25] flesh
[1:21:26] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:21:27] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:21:30] visions
[1:21:30] and your old man shall dream dreams now
[1:21:34] uh again this is the scripture that
[1:21:36] brother branham is using
[1:21:38] to talk about the seven junctions and i
[1:21:40] say lord now now
[1:21:42] now there's got to be something to this
[1:21:44] and then as i start putting it all
[1:21:45] together
[1:21:46] as we're preaching this by faith now the
[1:21:48] promise is that god gonna pry out his
[1:21:50] spirit
[1:21:50] now i can't do nothing but just read
[1:21:53] what his promise said
[1:21:55] i can't make the spirit come you can't
[1:21:57] make the spirit come
[1:21:58] it's god himself doing it whenever he
[1:22:01] wants to do it
[1:22:02] but i know what to expect because this
[1:22:04] is a promise
[1:22:06] oh hallelujah now you know uh
[1:22:09] i read this and when i preached on the
[1:22:11] second junction
[1:22:12] we had a number of dreams i believe
[1:22:15] there were
[1:22:15] roughly five dreams uh that that come
[1:22:18] out of it and and i don't i don't have
[1:22:20] time to go back in
[1:22:21] and hit all of them today but i'll tell
[1:22:22] you go back to the second junction
[1:22:24] you'll be able to get it all
[1:22:25] but the one i did want to bring out is
[1:22:27] the brother said that he had a dream
[1:22:29] stated there about 15 saints from the
[1:22:31] church assembled
[1:22:33] but not at our specific church says as
[1:22:35] the saints were fellowshipping
[1:22:37] he noticed one of the sisters was
[1:22:39] standing in line
[1:22:40] and she had a bump she was expecting
[1:22:44] and now the brother told me who the
[1:22:46] sister was in his dream
[1:22:47] and i called her sister and i told her
[1:22:49] you know uh uh
[1:22:51] what was what was shared but i didn't
[1:22:52] tell the church not that's not
[1:22:53] everybody's business that's
[1:22:55] that's that's between them right and and
[1:22:57] i think that's the way we should handle
[1:22:59] things
[1:22:59] right glory to god but but i believe
[1:23:02] and as i was sharing this with just some
[1:23:04] other brothers our brother troy
[1:23:06] specific it's just it's not that that's
[1:23:08] uh only a physical dream for that that
[1:23:10] one sister
[1:23:12] this has spiritual significance if the
[1:23:15] sister has
[1:23:16] a bump that means she's pregnant and
[1:23:19] she's expecting something
[1:23:21] and on the spiritual side a woman in a
[1:23:23] dream always represent the church
[1:23:25] the church is expecting what is the
[1:23:28] church expecting the supernatural
[1:23:32] hallelujah and i'm going to tell you
[1:23:33] something when when when a woman reaches
[1:23:35] a final stage and that baby's ready to
[1:23:37] come
[1:23:38] then one thing that mother can do to
[1:23:40] stop that baby
[1:23:41] from coming out when that baby is ready
[1:23:44] to enter into this world it's going to
[1:23:46] go through all kind of pace in order to
[1:23:48] get here
[1:23:49] but that baby's got to come out she
[1:23:51] better get to the hospital fast because
[1:23:53] the baby
[1:23:54] is determined to come out hallelujah and
[1:23:57] i'm here to tell you you can't stop the
[1:24:00] supernatural you can't close up the
[1:24:03] supernatural
[1:24:04] it's time for the supernatural to be
[1:24:06] born
[1:24:07] in this church and i believe it's here
[1:24:11] at the seventh junction
[1:24:17] oh hallelujah glory glory glory glory
[1:24:22] glory
[1:24:23] god was showing us these things in
[1:24:25] dreams
[1:24:26] letting us know where we were what to be
[1:24:29] expecting
[1:24:30] uh you know and i already told you all
[1:24:32] about i had a dream about us
[1:24:34] that brother brother brother clinton
[1:24:36] came there and gave me the key say
[1:24:37] pastor's all done the church is finished
[1:24:39] we got the church
[1:24:40] and i told him the dream he said pastor
[1:24:42] had the same dream three to three days
[1:24:43] ago
[1:24:44] i say oh my number the confirmation old
[1:24:47] men
[1:24:47] shall dream dreams
[1:24:52] i can't help but that's what the bible
[1:24:54] say
[1:24:56] i'm not in the young people group no
[1:24:58] more
[1:25:00] hallelujah i passed 50. amen old men
[1:25:04] shall
[1:25:04] dream dreams and that's exactly what
[1:25:07] happened here
[1:25:09] brother smiley had a dream and his dream
[1:25:11] was that i'll show you how to get over
[1:25:13] that vertigo
[1:25:15] and you know the manifestation of the
[1:25:17] dream where it occurred
[1:25:18] when we went to arkansas because usually
[1:25:22] when he fly
[1:25:22] that thing comes back on him but when we
[1:25:25] went to arkansas
[1:25:26] no problems at all supernatural gods
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:38] oh
[1:25:41] i'm gonna let brother smiley close the
[1:25:43] service because i think it's some other
[1:25:44] things he can share
[1:25:46] but uh i'm just showing you some other
[1:25:47] supernatural things that is that
[1:25:49] that's that's that's that's happened
[1:25:50] during this journey like i said i could
[1:25:52] go talk
[1:25:53] about brother brandon but i want to talk
[1:25:54] about us
[1:25:56] in the midst of this journey
[1:26:00] when we got to the fifth junction i
[1:26:02] preached three-part series on the fifth
[1:26:04] junction the second part
[1:26:05] i uh preached um and i
[1:26:09] introduced something that happened on
[1:26:12] march 30th in our church
[1:26:13] we had our first terry service and in
[1:26:16] that terror service
[1:26:17] amen march 30th
[1:26:21] we had uh three manifestations of
[1:26:23] tongues
[1:26:25] and then four interpretations in that
[1:26:27] terror service
[1:26:28] hallelujah and through the
[1:26:30] interpretations what we got was
[1:26:32] yield and i will speak my glory is here
[1:26:37] you are no longer bound you are free in
[1:26:40] jesus name
[1:26:41] it is done what i say i will do
[1:26:45] this is my word to you
[1:26:49] that's for our church
[1:26:53] it was all this happened during the
[1:26:55] junctions i want y'all to understand
[1:26:56] this during the series of the junctions
[1:26:58] we never even had a terror service
[1:26:59] before i asked somebody say brother uh
[1:27:01] could you tell me all the churches you
[1:27:03] know i went to a number of churches have
[1:27:04] you been to any church where they've
[1:27:05] done this
[1:27:06] say not one church have we ever done it
[1:27:10] i said well wow this is something new
[1:27:12] and and what i what i'm what i'm saying
[1:27:14] is that brother branham said
[1:27:15] he finally got a group that he's got it
[1:27:17] all together
[1:27:19] and they now i'm here and they pray i
[1:27:21] got them doing exactly the way
[1:27:23] that i want them to do it the way that
[1:27:24] the scriptures say for them to do it now
[1:27:26] i finally got now i can do more in their
[1:27:28] midst than they ever imagined
[1:27:30] if we would just learn to heal
[1:27:37] we come back amen here
[1:27:40] june 29th our secondary service
[1:27:44] hallelujah and
[1:27:47] notice the first terror service came as
[1:27:49] part of the fifth junction
[1:27:51] which was a great junction but the
[1:27:53] second service
[1:27:54] secondary service came in the midst of
[1:27:56] the seventh junction
[1:27:58] and both represent the first coming of
[1:28:00] the lord and the second coming of the
[1:28:02] lord
[1:28:03] fifth junction first coming of the lord
[1:28:05] second seventh junction is the second
[1:28:07] coming of the lord
[1:28:08] watch this and this become
[1:28:12] a man and and what we got this time was
[1:28:16] two manifestations of tongues and one
[1:28:18] interpretation
[1:28:20] now as we were you know we we had uh uh
[1:28:23] uh
[1:28:24] brother branham said you gotta have
[1:28:25] brothers that are spiritual that
[1:28:27] we're discerning that can judge and when
[1:28:30] we got the brothers together just kind
[1:28:31] of talk about you know what they felt
[1:28:33] the lord was saying and
[1:28:34] men say yeah this is of god this is of
[1:28:35] god and just sound like the
[1:28:37] the two manifestations of tongues was
[1:28:38] just two different languages
[1:28:40] saying the same thing
[1:28:44] so that's why there's only one
[1:28:45] interpretation i want to tell you
[1:28:46] something else
[1:28:47] we will not box god in when we come here
[1:28:51] and we say god you've got to do it this
[1:28:52] way
[1:28:54] god can do whatever he want to do when
[1:28:55] we come
[1:28:57] all we want to do is yield but this
[1:29:00] message that we got this time says i
[1:29:02] am that i am i am i am your provider
[1:29:07] i have given you everything that you
[1:29:09] need
[1:29:10] i am that i am ask
[1:29:13] and seek and i will give
[1:29:16] i am that i am i am
[1:29:19] that i am now i thought about that
[1:29:22] and i'm going to tell you now i'm just
[1:29:24] i'm going to be honest with you
[1:29:26] i want to be honest but i want to be
[1:29:27] careful and being honest
[1:29:29] because the devil hallelujah can use
[1:29:32] sometimes these things against you
[1:29:37] i knew that that i am that i am when it
[1:29:39] says uh
[1:29:40] i uh ask and seek and i will give i knew
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:43] that connected to scripture and there
[1:29:45] was a scripture
[1:29:47] that uh brother brother simba came up
[1:29:49] and read to us
[1:29:51] at prayer say ask seek knock
[1:29:55] hallelujah ask and it shall be given to
[1:29:57] you seek and you shall find
[1:29:58] knock and the door will be open i say
[1:30:02] now now here
[1:30:02] brother simmer gave us that scripture i
[1:30:05] took that scripture to arkansas
[1:30:07] and the people were blessed by it right
[1:30:09] ask
[1:30:10] seek not i also took that scripture for
[1:30:12] myself
[1:30:14] and i told y'all
[1:30:17] i told y'all that there was a meeting
[1:30:19] taking place
[1:30:20] about a building that we want to get
[1:30:23] well that sunday that i told y'all the
[1:30:24] meeting didn't take place

[1:30:38] ass seek knock
[1:30:43] and he told us that i've given you
[1:30:44] everything that you need
[1:30:46] so i'm rotting this i'm riding this
[1:30:49] prophecy
[1:30:56] while we were
[1:31:00] going through this series another sister
[1:31:03] sent a testimony we had a wednesday
[1:31:06] night service
[1:31:09] and on that wednesday night service i
[1:31:10] started going through a quote where
[1:31:12] brother branham say somebody's going to
[1:31:13] get healed tonight
[1:31:15] y'all remember that and we ended up
[1:31:17] having a prayer line here at the church
[1:31:19] on wednesday night
[1:31:20] and uh while before we had the prayer
[1:31:22] line
[1:31:23] uh i felt led just to pray for the
[1:31:25] people that were streaming there was a
[1:31:26] sister streaming in tennessee
[1:31:28] and she sent her testimony and she said
[1:31:30] uh
[1:31:33] since at the end of the service brother
[1:31:34] jack was moved to pray for us that was
[1:31:35] streaming online god's power started
[1:31:37] moving on me
[1:31:38] uh something very warm started in my

[1:32:43] truth tabernacle i greet you in a name
[1:32:46] that is above every name the lord jesus
[1:32:49] christ i'm so grateful to see the lord
[1:32:50] is keeping you
[1:32:51] all and moving us all forward in his
[1:32:54] kingdom
[1:32:55] through the preaching and believing of
[1:32:57] the word
[1:33:00] says 2020 revealed itself to be a very
[1:33:03] trying year for my family
[1:33:06] our 15 year old son was diagnosed with
[1:33:08] kidney
[1:33:09] cancer after a series of tests
[1:33:23] i don't want the devil to get in in the
[1:33:25] middle of this
[1:33:27] says our 15-year-old son was diagnosed
[1:33:29] with a kidney cancer after a series of
[1:33:31] tests
[1:33:33] i had to surrender this to the lord it
[1:33:36] was more than i can bear
[1:33:38] god gave me peace in this storm
[1:33:42] now you know i'm liking this because we
[1:33:44] had some saints here
[1:33:46] had to go through some procedures during
[1:33:48] this time
[1:33:49] and god still heals through medicine
[1:33:53] god can use whatever method he want to
[1:33:55] use to bring healing
[1:33:57] so if he has to go through medicine it's
[1:33:58] fine don't don't don't don't
[1:34:00] brother brandon had to rebuke somebody
[1:34:01] one time because they didn't want to go
[1:34:02] to the doctor
[1:34:03] say no don't do that god can use the
[1:34:05] doctor to be a help to you
[1:34:07] amen hallelujah all right
[1:34:10] look now it says um uh she said
[1:34:14] i i can i i had to surrender this to the
[1:34:16] lord it was more than i can bear god
[1:34:18] gave me peace in the storm of coveting
[1:34:20] cancer
[1:34:20] through christ i wrote a prayer request
[1:34:24] to you all during the prayer line the
[1:34:26] visiting pastor prayed and i put it
[1:34:28] on put it on a speaker so it could
[1:34:31] permeate
[1:34:32] the atmosphere our son has since
[1:34:35] had surgery and completed radiation
[1:34:38] and chemotherapy right as scary as this
[1:34:42] was a 15 year old boy
[1:34:43] as scary as this was uh i had to trust
[1:34:46] that
[1:34:47] god loves him even more than we do and
[1:34:50] would take good care of him and he did
[1:34:53] glory to god there were also several
[1:34:56] elements that i was dealing with
[1:34:58] one of which was a nasal uh uh
[1:35:01] granuloma now let me um before i go
[1:35:03] further this
[1:35:04] um let's just stop and praise god for
[1:35:07] bringing this
[1:35:08] young man
[1:35:11] through chemotherapy and radiation
[1:35:15] only god could touch his body to bring
[1:35:16] him through that
[1:35:18] a 15 year old boy
[1:35:21] oh hallelujah god did that for that
[1:35:25] young man
[1:35:26] now he had to go through the radiation
[1:35:28] you had to go through the chemotherapy
[1:35:29] that's okay god can use that for his
[1:35:31] glory
[1:35:34] oh hallelujah and i just want to show
[1:35:36] you see god got different strategies
[1:35:38] the way he brings healing watch watch
[1:35:41] the rest of this now
[1:35:42] she says uh and now she stopped when she
[1:35:45] said um
[1:35:46] when she made the comments says god
[1:35:47] loves him even more than we do and would
[1:35:49] take good care of him and he did
[1:35:52] right she says uh glory to god that was
[1:35:54] a praise right there
[1:35:57] now she's moving on to another thought
[1:35:58] there was there were also
[1:36:00] several ailments that i was dealing with
[1:36:03] one of which was a nasal
[1:36:05] uh granuloma this growth in my nasal
[1:36:09] cavity
[1:36:10] blocked my airway causing sinus
[1:36:12] headaches and sleep apnea
[1:36:15] i had prayed and asked god to heal it
[1:36:17] but i
[1:36:18] but i was growing weary because uh that
[1:36:21] had been over
[1:36:22] a year i finally saw a doctor while my
[1:36:25] son was still going through
[1:36:26] treatment he told me he would surgically
[1:36:29] remove it
[1:36:30] so i could have relief and proceeded to
[1:36:32] schedule
[1:36:34] the removal all right says a few weeks
[1:36:37] later
[1:36:38] i ended up canceling the surgery because
[1:36:41] i
[1:36:41] felt i should have wait i should wait
[1:36:43] until my son was finished
[1:36:45] uh finished uh finished up and then i
[1:36:48] would reschedule
[1:36:50] one sunday evening i was outside on the

[1:46:24] god bless you um
[1:46:27] so i'll i'll start with um
[1:46:31] yeah i'll start with my my dad first um
[1:46:33] as you know you know my
[1:46:35] family was here um i believe three weeks
[1:46:37] ago and
[1:46:38] they weren't just here to visit um
[1:46:42] my family in fact wants to move out here
[1:46:44] um
[1:46:45] and they
[1:46:48] we're from arizona and they moved to
[1:46:50] arkansas my dad you know kind of wanted
[1:46:52] to semi-retire moved to arkansas and
[1:46:54] keep doing what he was doing and you
[1:46:56] know just kind of be financially
[1:46:57] free and so they did that
[1:47:01] built a house well not everything worked
[1:47:03] out the way that they wanted it to work
[1:47:04] out and
[1:47:05] fell into hard times and you know but
[1:47:08] the lord still took care of them
[1:47:10] in that and um talking to my mom
[1:47:14] she had kind of hinted around it you
[1:47:16] know maybe we'll move to florida and
[1:47:18] told my dad like why don't ask frankie
[1:47:20] see if he can get you a job out there
[1:47:22] which i had you know no doubt in my mind
[1:47:24] that i could do that with whoever i was
[1:47:25] working for
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:29] so the people that i work for now
[1:47:32] which me working there is a testimony of
[1:47:35] itself because i never applied to this
[1:47:37] place
[1:47:38] they found my resume online and they
[1:47:39] gave me a call and offered me
[1:47:42] the best job that i've ever had
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:47] and so one day the manager comes up to
[1:47:50] me and
[1:47:51] starts questioning me about my dad and
[1:47:53] uh
[1:47:54] just you know your dad's a mechanic and
[1:47:56] whatnot and
[1:47:57] he asked me a couple questions like you
[1:47:58] know he's a good mechanic you know i
[1:48:00] told him hey you know he trained he's
[1:48:01] better than me
[1:48:02] so uh he he walked away and i had called
[1:48:06] my wife and was like hey he's asking
[1:48:07] about my dad i wonder why
[1:48:09] um and she's like well you should have
[1:48:11] told him you know hey if you guys look
[1:48:12] for somebody you know you can hire him
[1:48:14] and he come back out and ask a couple
[1:48:17] other things i'm like why are you asking
[1:48:18] you know what do you why do you want to
[1:48:19] know about my dad
[1:48:20] um you know you guys looking to hire
[1:48:22] somebody and he goes where i was looking
[1:48:24] and he kind of he used the analogy like
[1:48:26] a baseball team if there's an all-star
[1:48:28] out there
[1:48:28] you know you tried to get the all-star
[1:48:29] and get him in here i was like okay
[1:48:32] and uh he uh he kind of he walked away
[1:48:36] and then he comes right back
[1:48:37] well he he's a he smoked so he was out
[1:48:39] on a smoke break and he walked away to
[1:48:40] finish the smoke break he was walking
[1:48:42] back to me and he goes
[1:48:43] terry daddy's got a job out here and
[1:48:45] i'll pay him the same exact money as
[1:48:46] i'll pay you
[1:48:47] and so he he leaves which that in of
[1:48:50] itself is
[1:48:51] insane because you know
[1:48:54] not to you know like boast or anything
[1:48:57] but
[1:48:57] i am paid at the highest payment of my
[1:49:01] trade which is unheard of
[1:49:04] um so
[1:49:07] i called my father i told him that and
[1:49:10] you know right away he's
[1:49:11] you know he's like yeah like i would
[1:49:12] like to do that so when he came out here
[1:49:14] he talked to him
[1:49:17] and before he moves out here he wanted
[1:49:20] to go back home to arizona and visit his
[1:49:22] family
[1:49:24] and while he was back there you know he
[1:49:27] was worried because the guy that he
[1:49:28] works for now in arkansas had been
[1:49:31] planning this big expansion with his
[1:49:32] business
[1:49:33] i'm gonna add bays and we're gonna take
[1:49:35] over and including my father and all
[1:49:36] this and so he was distraught like i'm
[1:49:38] gonna leave this guy hanging in this

[1:50:22] so my dad's
[1:50:23] got a job out here and uh he didn't have
[1:50:27] to worry about
[1:50:28] leaving this guy hanging with anything
[1:50:30] and
[1:50:32] my father will actually be out here this
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] friday
[1:50:40] so the second thing that i wanted to
[1:50:42] share is my own
[1:50:44] personal thing that happened to me this
[1:50:45] week so last sunday i woke up and
[1:50:48] it's feeling kind of achy and i had some
[1:50:50] pain in my lower back and
[1:50:53] i don't know i guess this might just be
[1:50:54] me but if i start getting sick i won't
[1:50:56] tell nobody until it's too late
[1:50:58] you know uh so i don't want to tell my
[1:51:00] wife anything she's worried
[1:51:01] she'll freak out and quarantine me
[1:51:04] even even before covet it was she would
[1:51:06] have haunted me
[1:51:08] uh so uh i didn't want to say anything
[1:51:12] and after a while it was
[1:51:13] i'm feeling you know
[1:51:16] bad enough that i was like i'm not gonna
[1:51:18] go to church because you know i don't
[1:51:19] know what i'm coming down with
[1:51:21] um so sitting home finally you know
[1:51:24] complaining a little bit aching and and
[1:51:26] so she's like you're getting sick
[1:51:28] i was like yeah i think i think i'm
[1:51:29] getting sick so um
[1:51:32] you know we started doing our own little
[1:51:33] things and and just tried to remedy it
[1:51:36] um and so it i mean it's a little
[1:51:38] personal but it started to
[1:51:40] to burn when i went to the bathroom and
[1:51:43] um
[1:51:44] anything anything of it and i didn't
[1:51:45] think they were related
[1:51:48] and then that night i had woke up in
[1:51:50] even more pain
[1:51:51] started burning a fever come into monday
[1:51:56] in the morning i pumped myself full of
[1:51:57] medicine told myself
[1:51:59] i'm fine but it was still too sick
[1:52:01] enough to go to work
[1:52:02] until monday i started to burn a fever
[1:52:04] and i believe i believe it was a monday
[1:52:06] that i
[1:52:06] did text you so i text brother jack on
[1:52:08] monday and i told him you know
[1:52:10] everything else was going on
[1:52:11] and by that point like i started to
[1:52:13] bleed as i was going to the restroom
[1:52:15] and fever got worse i got up to 101
[1:52:19] and that's when i i text brother jack
[1:52:22] and i text my family as well and
[1:52:23] and um so obviously you know when
[1:52:25] something when you're at that point
[1:52:27] you know you're in a little bit of a
[1:52:28] panic and brother jack i text brother
[1:52:30] jack and i you know i just expect him to
[1:52:32] you know just kind of remember me in
[1:52:33] prayer i didn't
[1:52:34] i actually didn't expect him to call me
[1:52:36] um and so he called me and
[1:52:38] and when he called me i told my wife you
[1:52:40] know brother jackson called me to pray
[1:52:41] for me
[1:52:42] and she came in the room she actually
[1:52:43] knelt down um by the bed as he prayed
[1:52:46] and
[1:52:46] and so he prayed for me and then i
[1:52:48] shared the testimony of my father but
[1:52:50] as soon as i hung up the phone then she
[1:52:52] looks at me and she's like i believe
[1:52:53] that you're healed
[1:52:54] i believe i'm healed too my fever
[1:52:57] maintained for about
[1:52:59] 20 minutes after that and then just
[1:53:01] dropped off
[1:53:02] and um i um i went the restroom
[1:53:06] and i started go to the bathroom and you
[1:53:08] know halfway going to the bathroom the
[1:53:09] blood
[1:53:10] stopped and
[1:53:13] [Applause]
[1:53:15] it's been like it's been you know good
[1:53:18] since and
[1:53:18] i still had a little bit of pain enough
[1:53:20] to keep me out of work um
[1:53:21] i went on went to work on thursday but
[1:53:24] you know i was 100
[1:53:26] and um being that i don't have insurance
[1:53:28] yet through my work because they're
[1:53:29] still working on it
[1:53:30] obviously i didn't want to go to the
[1:53:31] doctor or go to the hospital or pay
[1:53:34] hospital bills um
[1:53:37] so on on friday morning uh my wife
[1:53:40] was like why don't you just go online
[1:53:42] and find like a like an online doctor
[1:53:44] that you can pay a couple dollars for
[1:53:45] and and
[1:53:46] you know talk to him see like get your
[1:53:47] prescription so i go online i just
[1:53:49] googled something real quick and
[1:53:51] found an app and filled it out and just
[1:53:53] answered a questionnaire and the doctor
[1:53:54] contacted me and was like oh yeah you
[1:53:55] know it sounds like you have an
[1:53:56] infection and
[1:53:57] here's some medicine for it and sit
[1:54:01] between the 20 cost talk to the doctor
[1:54:03] and 16
[1:54:04] obviously it's significantly less than
[1:54:06] even if i had insurance
[1:54:08] so you know god even took care of me in
[1:54:10] that with no insurance and you know he
[1:54:12] gave me
[1:54:12] exactly what i had made of and healed my
[1:54:15] body so
[1:54:15] god bless you all
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:34] um as brother frankie was sharing his
[1:54:37] testimony i could just
[1:54:39] see the play just playing out right in
[1:54:41] front of me
[1:54:43] and brother frankie walks up to take the
[1:54:45] mic
[1:54:46] and begins to share his testimony right
[1:54:50] supernatural things that are happening
[1:54:53] right here in our midst
[1:54:56] oh i just thank god church and and i'm
[1:54:59] on the expectation for so much more
[1:55:02] right i mean sister gina he didn't tell
[1:55:04] me that part but since jesus said
[1:55:05] declare after the prayer
[1:55:07] i believe you're healed
[1:55:10] god does what he wants to do when he
[1:55:12] wants to do it
[1:55:14] oh hallelujah
[1:55:18] let me just finish amen by reading your
[1:55:20] quote here from god has a provided way
[1:55:23] should be the last uh quote on the
[1:55:25] second page there
[1:55:27] and um this has been some journey
[1:55:30] through these
[1:55:31] junctions hallelujah
[1:55:34] hallelujah says now we're moving right
[1:55:38] on into another
[1:55:40] great age coming for the rapture of the
[1:55:42] church
[1:55:43] and in this we're living in the time of
[1:55:47] the restoration
[1:55:48] of the gifts and that's what brother
[1:55:51] branham say we're living in the time
[1:55:53] of the restoration of the gifts and uh
[1:55:56] and i just
[1:55:57] i'm i'm grateful that in in this season
[1:56:00] god has begun to use the gifts the way
[1:56:03] that he wants to use them in our midst
[1:56:05] uh no one trying to make themselves do
[1:56:08] anything
[1:56:09] um it's just a very unique way that i've
[1:56:13] just been watching god
[1:56:14] and and i know he got so much more i
[1:56:16] want to tell you no matter what your
[1:56:17] gift is
[1:56:18] uh everybody got something that god has
[1:56:20] given them if you would just yield it to
[1:56:22] the lord
[1:56:23] don't don't give it to the devil give it
[1:56:25] to god right
[1:56:26] let let god use whatever god is giving
[1:56:29] you just yield that to the lord and
[1:56:30] watch god i
[1:56:31] i've already proven everything is
[1:56:33] important here
[1:56:35] your son your singing is important the
[1:56:37] sister didn't get healed
[1:56:39] through while i was preaching the sister
[1:56:42] got healed from the anointing
[1:56:44] that came from a song the anointing
[1:56:46] calls her to sneeze
[1:56:49] no don't don't don't think that strange
[1:56:51] remember
[1:56:52] there was a little boy in the bible the
[1:56:56] prophet laid on top of that boy
[1:56:58] and the boy sneezed seven times and it
[1:57:02] came back to life
[1:57:04] right we in the bible with these things
[1:57:06] and if i'm not mistaken that was elisha
[1:57:10] right is that right elisha not elijah
[1:57:15] elisha you know who elijah represent
[1:57:21] elisha represents the pride
[1:57:25] come on church
[1:57:32] it says we're living in the time of the
[1:57:34] restoration of the gifts

[1:58:15] believe that i really believe that
[1:58:17] my jesus my jesus um
[1:58:21] let me let me just say this real quick
[1:58:24] before i go there
[1:58:25] while we were there in in um arkansas
[1:58:29] there was a brother tim hayden
[1:58:32] was after he finished preaching he had a
[1:58:34] prayer line
[1:58:35] and there was a sister coming through
[1:58:37] the prayer line and brother tim before
[1:58:39] he prayed for he just backed up
[1:58:41] and he looked and said sister the lord
[1:58:43] told me to tell you that he's already
[1:58:45] told you what to do you just need to be
[1:58:46] obedient to what he told you to do
[1:58:50] uh i don't know what that mean but you
[1:58:52] just need to be obediences
[1:58:54] and he went ahead and prayed for and
[1:58:56] sent on through the line
[1:58:57] one of the brothers say he walked to
[1:58:59] brother tim said did you know that
[1:59:00] sister he said no i don't know her from
[1:59:02] nobody i don't know
[1:59:04] he says uh do you know what you told her
[1:59:08] so yeah god told her he already
[1:59:09] done told her what what what she need to
[1:59:11] do she just need to be obedient
[1:59:12] so do you know what her testimony is no
[1:59:15] it said
[1:59:16] a few years ago that sister and her
[1:59:18] husband had laid some fleeces before god
[1:59:22] about whether to move to this church or
[1:59:24] not
[1:59:26] whether they should be in this church or
[1:59:27] not and they asked god to do three
[1:59:29] things for them
[1:59:30] well god did all three things that they
[1:59:32] asked for
[1:59:33] and they still say it wasn't the will of
[1:59:35] god for them to move so they went back
[1:59:37] to wherever they were
[1:59:38] and within a year two years the husband
[1:59:40] died
[1:59:41] gone just like that suddenly young man
[1:59:44] gone
[1:59:44] has no idea what happened to him well
[1:59:46] after this happened
[1:59:48] the sister still prayed lord do you
[1:59:50] really want me to move and go to that
[1:59:51] church
[1:59:52] come to the prayer line in the church
[1:59:54] and been told
[1:59:56] i already told you what to do just be
[1:59:58] obedient
[2:00:01] see the angel lord is still here and
[2:00:03] he's still speaking to people
[2:00:06] that was just too precise and i don't
[2:00:09] and i shared that because i don't know
[2:00:10] what god might have told somebody in
[2:00:11] here
[2:00:12] but you need to be obedient to what god
[2:00:14] spoke
[2:00:16] amen amen when i go to a church like
[2:00:20] that and see something like that happen
[2:00:21] in the prayer line i say you know what
[2:00:23] we don't know what happened up in here
[2:00:25] we don't know
[2:00:27] come to church with your life clean
[2:00:31] the days of ananias and sapphira are
[2:00:33] back actually never left
[2:00:35] they're still here so be careful church
[2:00:38] amen
[2:00:40] all right let me finish reading this it
[2:00:42] says um
[2:00:43] the rapture church in this we're living
[2:00:45] in the time of the restoration of gifts
[2:00:46] it stumbled many of the big fine
[2:00:48] churches
[2:00:49] it sent nazarene backwards it made
[2:00:52] fanatics out of a lot of the pen a lot
[2:00:54] of the
[2:00:55] a lot of pentecost but just as saying
[2:00:58] god's moving right
[2:00:59] on bringing in the rapture and faith for
[2:01:02] his church
[2:01:04] that's right so tonight i represent
[2:01:09] that faith brother branham's ministry
[2:01:12] represented
[2:01:14] that faith and we are contending for
[2:01:18] that faith i represent that faith
[2:01:21] the faith that was once delivered to the
[2:01:23] saints in the way of a divine
[2:01:26] gift which to my opinion gifts and
[2:01:28] calling is not my opinion but the bible
[2:01:30] says that gifts and calls are without
[2:01:31] repentance
[2:01:32] there's nothing you can do about it you
[2:01:34] can't make yourself with blue eyes
[2:01:36] when you got brown you're just what you
[2:01:38] are by the grace of god
[2:01:40] now we know um not naturally
[2:01:44] you can't
[2:01:47] but people doing all kind of stuff to
[2:01:49] themselves nine days
[2:01:51] amen but if god gave you a certain
[2:01:52] colors because he wanted you to have
[2:01:54] that color
[2:01:55] amen you can't even come to god without
[2:01:57] god calling you first you can't seek god
[2:01:59] without god seeking you
[2:02:01] first and calling you no man can come to
[2:02:04] me except my father draws him
[2:02:06] so god is seeking and god is set in the
[2:02:09] church
[2:02:10] i am grateful for our journey through
[2:02:14] these seven junctions and uh and i'm
[2:02:17] happy to see
[2:02:18] uh god is still moving the way that he
[2:02:20] moved in every junction
[2:02:22] he's moving the same right now our god
[2:02:25] is an awesome god
[2:02:27] our god is a mighty god hallelujah
[2:02:32] amen let's bow in a word of prayer
[2:02:37] father we're so grateful for what we see
[2:02:41] you doing in our midst
[2:02:44] thank you for your anointing that
[2:02:45] destroys yoks
[2:02:48] thank you for the changes that are
[2:02:50] taking place in our lives lord and
[2:02:52] uh we know that it's nothing but you as
[2:02:55] the prophet said
[2:02:56] you did more in his ministry than you
[2:02:58] did in your own
[2:03:00] and he realized it wasn't him doing
[2:03:01] anything it was you doing it all
[2:03:04] father we have um so much that we see
[2:03:08] uh here at this time sometimes we we see
[2:03:11] things we take them for granted
[2:03:13] but oh god we don't want to miss what
[2:03:15] the holy spirit is doing in this hour
[2:03:17] help us lord to be sensitive and in tune
[2:03:20] and with a life full of expectation god
[2:03:22] that you would get glory and honor
[2:03:25] uh in our generation as you have gotten

[2:04:08] that means
[2:04:09] to bring a miracle and she i love the
[2:04:11] way she put it the balance in it

[2:04:32] and and everything like that but one day

[2:10:03] than one thing but
[2:10:04] that how this worked out i had one of my
[2:10:07] teeth to fall out in the front and i'm
[2:10:09] so embarrassed
[2:10:10] [Laughter]
[2:10:12] and my siblings that makes it happen for
[2:10:15] me
[2:10:15] i'm already nervous and it's a long
[2:10:18] testimony but i'm going to make it show
[2:10:20] and i promise i'm not going into all
[2:10:22] detail
[2:10:23] but the
[2:10:27] main part i wanted to share was you know
[2:10:30] when i was out
[2:10:31] for so long over a year um
[2:10:35] i was suffering with congested heart
[2:10:37] failure
[2:10:38] and afib and i had so much fluid build
[2:10:42] up in my body
[2:10:44] until it was i was on my way out of here
[2:10:47] and i knew it within myself
[2:10:49] and uh when my cardiologist find out how
[2:10:53] bad it were
[2:10:55] my daughter chantery who's the physician
[2:10:57] she was there with me
[2:10:58] she always liked to go to my appointment
[2:11:00] now
[2:11:01] and
[2:11:04] in a way he when he did test that day
[2:11:08] and he saw how bad it were
[2:11:10] and he told her about the research
[2:11:14] doctors that they have here now not too
[2:11:17] long ago a few years ago chantery said
[2:11:19] about three years ago they started
[2:11:21] here in west palm beach with the uh
[2:11:25] they put when you have that when anyway
[2:11:28] the right side of my
[2:11:30] heart the doors were so badly damaged
[2:11:33] until the fluid was building up in my
[2:11:35] body couldn't
[2:11:36] pump the blood and fluid through my body
[2:11:40] and i had so much fluid in me until
[2:11:43] i just the least little walking to from
[2:11:46] a different room the bathroom
[2:11:48] i'm so short of breath and it was uh it
[2:11:51] was just getting worse
[2:11:53] and now they put me in this research
[2:11:55] program
[2:11:57] and uh in chantal they explained to me
[2:12:01] what they was going to do
[2:12:03] and i had to qualify for it but i had so
[2:12:07] much fluid in my body until i didn't
[2:12:09] qualify
[2:12:10] they first had me in there and then i
[2:12:13] had to go to so many
[2:12:15] get so many tests done and at one point
[2:12:18] they said no
[2:12:18] you we got to drain that fluid out of
[2:12:21] your body
[2:12:22] and uh can everybody hear me
[2:12:26] okay they had to drain that fluid out of
[2:12:28] some more fluid i had been in the
[2:12:30] hospital a month
[2:12:31] so before that when my cardiologist was
[2:12:34] drawing
[2:12:34] drawing fluid out of my body but he
[2:12:36] didn't didn't
[2:12:38] nearly get it all but anyway they had to
[2:12:41] put me back in now they had to stop the
[2:12:43] research program
[2:12:45] and i had to go back into the hospital
[2:12:47] and they really drained it out then
[2:12:50] and so they put me back in there i
[2:12:53] qualified then
[2:12:54] for the research and
[2:12:58] i started to get nervous about it i'm
[2:13:00] like a researcher
[2:13:04] i'm like you don't know about that and i
[2:13:07] started praying about it
[2:13:09] and i said well
[2:13:13] lord i know who i belong to i know that
[2:13:17] you
[2:13:17] are and you real and you are with me
[2:13:20] you're in me
[2:13:22] and i say well and i know another thing
[2:13:25] when
[2:13:25] the devil cannot take me out of here
[2:13:27] until you get ready to call me
[2:13:30] and so that gave me some consolation but
[2:13:32] i still was a little nervous to tell the
[2:13:34] truth
[2:13:35] and uh so my daughter so coming up close
[2:13:38] to time
[2:13:39] uh chanter i asked her about it what you
[2:13:42] know exactly do they do
[2:13:44] and she put on a big screen tv which i
[2:13:47] have from a safari
[2:13:50] i mean my uh you know the fish thing
[2:13:54] the aquarium but anyway she showed it on
[2:13:57] the tv
[2:13:58] that what was going on in my body and
[2:14:01] uh and uh
[2:14:04] that helped me a lot and it was like
[2:14:06] like and she's describing
[2:14:08] so like when i uh you know like when we
[2:14:11] have a gas problem and the cars is
[2:14:13] like coming a storm coming or something
[2:14:16] happened with the gas
[2:14:18] the cars make long line miles long
[2:14:21] you know and she said that's what's
[2:14:23] happening in your body
[2:14:24] your fluid backing up and it just like
[2:14:28] just like that and i'm like
[2:14:32] and that that didn't sound good and so
[2:14:34] but anyway
[2:14:36] when they put me back in the hospital
[2:14:38] and drew that fluid
[2:14:40] really drew the fluid out of my body the
[2:14:42] fluid
[2:14:43] and uh and then i
[2:14:47] went on from there you know they started
[2:14:49] making preparation to
[2:14:51] you know put me in the hospital to do
[2:14:53] the
[2:14:54] triclips i think they call it they had
[2:14:57] to go in from the right side they had to
[2:14:59] go
[2:14:59] quite a few times to take pictures
[2:15:02] within my groin right groin and then
[2:15:04] down my throat
[2:15:05] taking pictures of checking out their
[2:15:08] right side
[2:15:09] where they was going to put the clips in
[2:15:12] it
[2:15:13] and uh which was a real chore
[2:15:17] uh so anyway coming on to the day they
[2:15:20] did the
[2:15:22] procedure you know just leaving out some
[2:15:25] parts to making sure
[2:15:27] uh when i was coming after they had
[2:15:29] finished
[2:15:30] which it took a little longer than they
[2:15:32] had anticipated
[2:15:34] and uh you know
[2:15:38] sometimes because i've heard some of the
[2:15:40] doctors when they do a procedure or
[2:15:42] something they
[2:15:43] that makes a recording of it and because
[2:15:46] i've heard them quite a few times
[2:15:48] and uh i come out i was waking up coming
[2:15:52] from under the anesthesia
[2:15:54] just in time to hear the last part of
[2:15:57] that recording he was making
[2:15:59] and uh when i first heard him i'm
[2:16:01] thinking to myself
[2:16:03] wait no i didn't hear all of that but i
[2:16:06] did hear that
[2:16:07] last part that last word he said
[2:16:11] and he uh so at first i didn't know how
[2:16:14] to put this but anyway
[2:16:17] he had to try six times i suppose to get
[2:16:20] to that seventh time
[2:16:21] i said it had to have been one two three
[2:16:24] four five
[2:16:26] six and then seven but he said i heard
[2:16:29] the doctor say that seven
[2:16:32] times it worked that seventh time it
[2:16:36] worked and i got
[2:16:37] i thought a long time about that i'm
[2:16:39] like
[2:16:40] oh my goodness so he was trying to put
[2:16:44] the clubs in the two
[2:16:45] triclips or whatever they call it in for
[2:16:48] six
[2:16:48] times apparently and uh
[2:16:52] it didn't work i heard that loud and
[2:16:54] clear
[2:16:55] but that seventh time it started started
[2:16:58] working and
[2:17:00] the more and then i'm thinking
[2:17:03] and i think seven junction he was
[2:17:06] today and i like he said i didn't
[2:17:09] realize
[2:17:10] myself i know i was about to lose but i
[2:17:12] know inside something was going on
[2:17:15] and uh i'm like oh my god and none of
[2:17:19] them nobody
[2:17:20] knew i were you know
[2:17:23] living here because i know i couldn't
[2:17:25] live like that the way i was feeling was
[2:17:27] just
[2:17:28] you know it was just you know about to
[2:17:30] you know but then i
[2:17:32] prayed about it and got to think and i
[2:17:34] said
[2:17:35] satan you cannot take me until god get
[2:17:38] ready for me
[2:17:39] and that give me some consolation and
[2:17:42] then but by the research thing that was
[2:17:44] still
[2:17:45] a question in my mind but god is good
[2:17:48] and so i knew
[2:17:49] he was in this so i won't say i'm living
[2:17:53] on borrowed time
[2:17:54] god intervened i'm a miracle
[2:17:57] and the miracles i wrote truly i can
[2:18:00] truly
[2:18:00] say i have experienced a miracle
[2:18:04] at this seven junction god bless you
[2:18:10] appreciate that testimony
[2:18:13] amen um i i tell you what uh
[2:18:18] me and brother jack we had um some
[2:18:20] wonderful wonderful
[2:18:22] wonderful uh services um
[2:18:25] in arkansas
[2:18:29] we just really saw the hand of god and
[2:18:31] um
[2:18:32] you know i was i was the lead man
[2:18:36] and god gave me a little inspiration in
[2:18:38] the services
[2:18:39] and i was telling them i'm just kind of
[2:18:41] laying the foundation
[2:18:43] because before anything can really
[2:18:46] happen if you're building anything and
[2:18:47] you're doing anything you got to have a
[2:18:49] foundation
[2:18:51] and uh god really really used us
[2:18:54] in a real special way i'll just just
[2:18:57] maybe share this one little thing
[2:19:00] uh a couple of things i i really believe
[2:19:03] that uh we we we're right where god
[2:19:08] wants us to be at i i really
[2:19:11] believe that being here has really been
[2:19:14] a blessing for me
[2:19:16] um i'm uh starting to kind of get back
[2:19:18] to my old old
[2:19:20] old self
[2:19:24] i'm starting to i'm starting to uh i was
[2:19:27] telling brother burleigh and say i think
[2:19:29] at one point i was starting to get a
[2:19:32] little callous
[2:19:34] and uh now i'm getting back to the place
[2:19:37] where
[2:19:37] you know i can be in church and feel the
[2:19:39] spirit
[2:19:41] and uh i weep you know it's hard to give
[2:19:44] me a mic because they don't tell them
[2:19:46] i'm not gonna cry in a minute that was
[2:19:48] my old self
[2:19:50] you feel the presence of god but i had
[2:19:52] started getting callous
[2:19:54] but now i mean i cried up a storm up in
[2:19:57] arkansas boohoo like a baby but uh um
[2:20:01] on that thursday night um
[2:20:04] i was ministering and uh god was really
[2:20:07] really
[2:20:08] you talking about discerning and just
[2:20:11] speaking direct
[2:20:13] to people and after every service
[2:20:16] they're like brother you don't even have
[2:20:17] a
[2:20:18] clue i said well i i don't have to have
[2:20:21] a clue
[2:20:22] the people who god speaking to they got
[2:20:25] to know that is god
[2:20:28] and he said man you was the pastor was
[2:20:30] like he couldn't even move i said i've
[2:20:32] been there too
[2:20:33] he said man you were saying things so
[2:20:36] direct
[2:20:37] he said i know the people was thinking
[2:20:40] man brother dave told brother
[2:20:43] he said but he didn't he didn't have to
[2:20:45] i've seen god use me for 20 some years
[2:20:49] but um and i had called them musicians
[2:20:53] up
[2:20:53] to uh come i was trying to quit and they
[2:20:56] would just steady pulling
[2:20:58] and i just kind of remember myself um
[2:21:01] uh moving to to my left and when i got
[2:21:05] to my
[2:21:06] left it just seemed like the room
[2:21:10] got brighter and i seem like i was kind
[2:21:14] of elevated a little bit
[2:21:16] it kind i told brother jack i said it
[2:21:18] kind of scared me
[2:21:20] i said it kind of scared me because like
[2:21:23] i said you know i
[2:21:24] i ministered i've ministered i've been
[2:21:26] preaching for almost 28 years
[2:21:28] and uh i don't feel like i'm an overly
[2:21:31] um
[2:21:32] spiritual guy tongue these things is
[2:21:35] just happening it's not something that
[2:21:37] i'm
[2:21:37] trying to make any these just things
[2:21:39] that's happened i think it's been
[2:21:41] because of
[2:21:41] uh brother jack's being inspired
[2:21:45] and and just and i'll read this and i'm
[2:21:47] gonna get out of here we let us go
[2:21:49] uh but as i as i i got to that plate
[2:21:53] like i say it scared me and i i said a
[2:21:57] few things
[2:21:58] and and and the brothers they was like
[2:22:02] whoa this is this is something special
[2:22:05] but it kind of scared me to a place
[2:22:07] where i i kind of turned and i
[2:22:09] i gave brother dave to mike i said man
[2:22:12] here take this thing
[2:22:14] uh out by hand but i i i thank god for
[2:22:17] for using us in a special way and i feel
[2:22:20] like god is is doing
[2:22:23] great great great thing
[2:22:26] um this this is a quote that the first
[2:22:28] quote i used up that i
[2:22:30] i think i read it here
[2:22:33] it means more to me today because it's
[2:22:36] we're on the seventh junction
[2:22:38] and and it says give me a church
[2:22:42] this out of the junction time uh
[2:22:45] give me a church ready
