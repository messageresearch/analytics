time and some of you all are feeling the effects from what happened last night amen and we started the fire on Friday night [Music] Amen brother Quentin Fulton Junior just just started the fight on Friday night and just a real wonderful youth service and then brother Jason came last night and we just I tell you just just enjoyed the presence of the Lord here we are again this morning under expectation uh for God to do amen what he promised that he would do um but uh listening to Sister Tanya's song Amen and the Lord be my God see now that tied into the tape that we just listened to a guy brother random said he needed God to be his guy he said he was out there and said I'm a good Hunter I'm this I ain't lost Saint lost then he had to get serious with God Lord I need you to be my God some of us need to get serious with God we need a God in this hour blessed be the name of the Lord so we just thank God for all things and amen just appreciate all that he's doing I got a card

Wednesday night amen at 7 30 uh for our Bible study and how many enjoying the Practical teaching that God has given us through the book of Ephesians amen we just appreciate the Lord for speaking to us amen just just things we can apply to everyday life and um and and I I was just I I'm watching as we just kind of go through you know we coming to Ephesians five we're coming to Ephesians 6 and so much and all of those chapters uh but as we as we get to coming to the end of Ephesians 4 there's a lot left that that I want to go in especially uh when he talks about grief not the Holy Spirit whereby yeah sealed unto the day of your Redemption and I said we're gonna have to really just go in there and one of the one of the things that I'm going to talk about was in the tape the guide for the random made a statement at the very beginning of that tape um you know and um and it's something that I I took and said I need to add this to my notes uh because uh I think it's just going to be very very helpful I got I got almost like a two-part teaching just on Ephesians 4 30 that I want to bring to you all but I'm just looking forward to it and amen and and we just we're just looking for more and more of God even even on this past Wednesday I just kind of felt God took us through a little cleansing to get us ready for this weekend and uh and that's why he come down in such a special way on last night because we went through the cleansing process and and I thank the Lord for that amen amen amen amen uh so Wednesday we'll be back here um we have some our streaming will continue

meetings Life Tabernacle October 14th through 16th and it just blessed my heart as brother um Solomon just asked and said we want to change all the service and reacts you all to stand and you know and you all don't don't do that for me amen I appreciate it but it's just an honor and respect to the word of God that's that's what it's all about I I saw sister keeping stand up in the backs I'm getting up I'm standing up and and I just believe God respects and honors things like that I I do believe that and and we we under expectations Sister Kate was that you might have come in one way but you'll leave a different way today that's all that's our faith that is our faith oh God is good hey we heard about him last night and I know we're gonna hear some more tonight Amen brother Jason shared about an 80 year old sister that was blind and after a word of prayer just a simple word of prayer God heal that system at 80 years old so uh we we realize that healing has no age limit to it amen as long

anniversary meetings and anyone that can make it there we want to encourage you to be a part of that as well uh praise the Lord um oh um let me mention sister um uh sister Zelma I was talking about you I need to confess before everybody I was talking about you and I I told the church on um on Friday on Wednesday night I said sister Zelma beat all of us here for prayer and she coming all the way from South Bay uh she could get here before me and I live right next door to the church I I felt ashamed of myself but as I was talking about you I saw some other Saints take the challenge amen and try to get here a little early so God bless you Sister we really appreciate you thank you for your faithfulness it means so much it means so much you and your daughter God bless you all for your faithfulness amen amen I believe it's those times of prayer that create atmospheres like this amen we can never pray too much amen I was um um last night brother Jason was uh sharing a little bit and he was at the men's meeting I shared a quote about um just encouraging the young man about um marriage actually just give me a quick search um put this in just a little something just put that in just a little something probably going to be 24 hits and gonna be the last hit in there that I'm gonna go to here in a second out of on the wings of a dove but brother Jason that made a um a a statement about a quote that I had read at the meetings and we were just encouraging the young men about you know things that you really need to have the Holy Ghost before you get married amen young sisters and young Brothers you need the Holy Ghost before you get married because the Holy Ghost is what's going to keep you in the marriage ain't nothing but the truth people ready to give up on their marriages but it's the holy ghost that keeps us Amen in the midst of all the trials and things that we go through and uh you know I was I was reading a quote there at the men's meeting and brother Brandon was talking to this uh he was given counsel to this brother and his sisters telling us that you know brother your family is like this and sister your family is like this and uh and saying the problem is your son got both of these things crossed up in him the genes from your family and the genes from this family came into this boy now he's Double Trouble right and it just it's just something that passed down through the genes and it says the reason that you not the way you are like your family system reason brother you're not the way your family is because the Holy Ghost make the difference in you it says and I would advise that that boy not get married to any girl until he's filled with the Holy Ghost and you know as I was reading the quote I said man and you know brother Brandon was talking and and then in the quote for the random say that the man raised up and and you could see him just kind of standing up on the prophet and I have you to know my son is this he said yeah intellectual he got all of that but until you have a birth and experience on the inside you better not let them get married and uh so as it's been raised up I'm just sitting there reading that quote like I just can't imagine this you know and brother Jason just gave so much more light to me last night to say the reason this man raised up is because it was brother branham's brother and he was talking about his nephew and talking to his sister-in-law I say wow only family will do you like that say Amen somebody but brother Branham didn't put their names out there but but but you know it's just it's beautiful when you have uh brothers that are just um you know that's been around a little bit and they can kind of give you a little bit more insight on that quote and just what what what was going on there so I just appreciated a few um months ago or maybe even a year ago and I'm not sure but I was I was teaching on the line because both brother Jason and I we teach the uh the eight o'clock calls in the morning and uh brother Jason's been doing a lot longer than I have him and brother Tim Calhoun uh they've been working with uh this brother that that out of out of California that had a desire just to go through the Book of Revelations and as brother Jason was introduced through uh I believe was brother Ernie Nueva I also got introduced and you know and as soon as I got on like the first time I got on the call just to listen brother Jason call me out you say brother Jack I know you're here but we're not just looking for you to listen brother we're looking for you to teach I say well praise the Lord but uh but I was I was teaching one morning you know after I you know we got it got going and and I read a quote one morning uh out of the message on the wings of a dove and um and it says so I want to just uh just a little something this little incidents happen he says why they was telling me a while ago uh there was a brother perhaps here in the meeting tonight that just come out of denominationalism coming to Shreveport wanted to hear about the message and it got mixed up they didn't know where he was at so he went downtown he seen a people gathered he said Is this where Billy Branham is going to preach he said no it's where Billy Graham's preaching by the way of a film he said well I'm sorry I got the wrong place it ain't Billy but two different last names and remember now uh Graham g-r-a-h-a-m-6 letters hello somebody all right and uh and brother Branham kept pointing it out he hadn't heard anybody since the days of Abraham when God used the man with those those letters ham at the end of his name and he just kept saying look at look at Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-m six letters and he just leave it like that now you had to be spiritual and you had to catch that brother branham's brother branham's last name was h-a-m but his name was seven letters God was using both of them at the same time now you had to kind of catch and this man that was going to this this church he knew Hallelujah I'm not looking for Billy Graham I'm looking for Branham amen so he says this says well I'm sorry I got the wrong place he said he'd come up he said no now where can I go Lord say to start walking up this Main Street I don't know what it is there's a big church up here at the end Texas Street and there was a big white cross up on the church said the Lord told him said just keep walking so when he got there there was said well here must be where it is there's a lot of cars sitting around and said a bride and groom come walking out of the church that was last night there was a wedding I've seen it come out the Lord said now that's what it is you're coming out of denominationalism to enter into the bride to go with the groom c c so you know I was reading that quote and teaching and at the end of a teaching typically they asked certain ministers just to comp make comments uh on it and uh my brother Jason was just sitting there just waiting and he didn't know whether it was going to get called to make comments but it got called on that day to make comments this brother I was waiting to say this he said this uh quote that brother Jack read it says I'm very familiar with the quote it says because um that was my daddy see it's something about when the when the word begins to live it's not just stories but these are the people a man that that go along with the story and and so when Brothers Jason comes and he speaks he's speaking from a personal place right and and I believe these are the things that help us you know we down here in South Florida we're we're somewhat disconnected from some of that but we believe this message right so I love it when God sends ministers our way that that can give you some more personal insight oh Hallelujah church this is a real message amen it's a real God that we've Fallen we came out of denominationalism to enter into the bride hallelujah amen so I'm grateful to to have uh brother Jason Watkins with us amen again this morning and uh and and I just know that the Lord has something good in store and I'm not going to take any more time I want him to come and just have his way so let's just stick let's let's quickly stand and we'll just turn the order of the service uh over to our brother do Amazing Grace say man and I actually only believe let's go back to that only believe and um I will just welcome him and just let him come in his in his own special way amen only believe all things are possible Hallelujah yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] all lifted up now foreign [Music] [Applause] I received that all things are possible oh Lord I [Music] received oh Lord I receive oh make him welcome now Lord oh I receive that all things are possible Lord I amen father we thank you this morning thank you for that we have hearing Hearts today thank you for your word thank you for all the singing the testimonies Lord it just set such a wonderful atmosphere it's so noticeable Lord when you come among God's family Lord everywhere I go around the world I find that the Holy Ghost produces the same kind of believer in every country and every culture and every race it doesn't matter Lord and we're grateful for that commit the service into your hands I commit myself both speaker and Here and Now break to us the bread of life that we are in need of today we commit it to you now in Jesus wonderful name amen all things are possible amen praise the Lord mine had a wonderful time last night and I'm going to invite you to Colossians chapter 1 and I'm just going to um kind of move a little bit out of my normal way so you'd be praying for me I can make things uncomfortable for a minister when he has to kind of move out of his own way and not that we're going to cover material that's not familiar to me but in the way I'm going to go about it okay so I'm just going to kind of step out of step out of the norm a little bit and I was telling brother Jack I really can't remember if I've ever approached it this way before I think I have at my own church more not really in a service per se more of a Bible study type of an atmosphere so I was encouraged by Brother Jack talking about the value of Bible study amen so you be praying for me today but we'll let you read one verse in Colossians chapter one and then we're going to read one verse and let you be seated but I'm going to invite you to keep your Bibles open because we're going to go down these verses amen praise the Lord Brother Branham used to do that all the time when he would take the Hebrews series and different things like that in Revelation chapter three and four and five he would just go like verse by verse where that's what brother Jack and I do on the call in uh on on on the morning uh call in and that uh you know that that um little service we have there really goes all around the world and uh there's there's whole churches who play that for their midweek service and groups of people everywhere so it has really blossomed into quite something quite amazing let me have the monitor turned down just a little bit that's roaring back at me just a little bit I promise you I won't need it a whole lot once I get going amen praise the Lord yeah that's um that's a little better all right so Colossians chapter 1 and we'll just read verse 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and timothius our brother may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you have your seats and you keep your Bibles open please there we want to look at these verses and I I have notes here before me that I believe I'll get to and I want to try to tie this into this and the Lord being my helper so I'm I'm counting on your your longevity today and your patience in the word of God and uh white people are harder harder to preach to because they're always in a hurry they're always looking at their watch and uh you know brother Branham you know I've got quotes where black people are more laid back and they're they're they're not you know so brother Brown said there's something about them they got a quality that white people don't know nothing about and so amen one thing you're going to find is I'm just real amen amen praise the Lord so that's why I like brother Jack he's just real I can be real around him but it is a fact sometimes white people let their whiteness get in their way and uh so today we're just gonna relax and preach the word of God all right Hallelujah I knew you'd react that way amen Hallelujah um you know William Booth said one time that your days at most cannot be very long so use them to the best of your ability for the glory of God and the benefit of your generation and you know something friends one of the things that become it's really Paramount is that we we realize which generation we are and really the scripture sums it up uh well and we find that we are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come and that's not a cliche that's not just a saying that's real and you know Time meets prophecy and it has met prophecy it intersects with prophecy brother Branham said God sends out his word might be thought profit or however and then it just circles the world until time intersects and then brings that prophecy to pass and you can't stop it you can't hurry it you can't speed God up and you can't slow him down and you should be grateful because you would always get that wrong I'm just glad he's in control and he starts out here by saying that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and you know it has to be that way and I I I think that you do well to remember that when you're thinking about the ministry you know when you're especially your pastor uh but not just your pastor other types of ministry God has a full bouquet of various types of ministry but but God's servants are are set aside they are reserved unto Christ and you know you can you as the laity and I and I I just hope you will absorb this and have an appreciation sometimes your pastor or ministers will do certain things say certain things and you wonder why I promise you they wonder why all right and I've had my wife you know come home my wife say to me say you know why did you do it that way and I would my answer is very often I I don't I don't know it's not the way I would have done it but it was the way I was told to do it it's not how I would have done it and I don't really I'm not sure why he did it that way but I knew better than to disobey that voice because Servants of God are set aside they're reserved unto Christ as a as a special core uh of of of expositors of the word of God they're gifted to rightly divide the word and you know you as the laity you can put move do whatever pretty much you want you can live wherever you want to live work wherever you want to work do whatever you want you know as long as it's Godly but you know ministers they don't really get to choose any of that your pastor don't get to make any choices about his life he don't get to choose where he lives he don't get to choose where he's pastoring he don't get to choose what he says he don't get he don't even get to choose what he thinks if he thinks a little wrong from the way God wants him to think God will God will discipline him until his thinking gets back right so pray for your pastor pray see pray pray for these other evangelists and you know brother Willie going out on the road pray for him because men of God are held under a very tight uh regulation by the Holy Spirit and things you could get away with your pastor can't get away with and so you know the Lord will as the Bible says you know even concerning Christ that he would beat him with many stripes and that the the Bible says that Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered see and and that's why you you're you're seeing a process and I really want to emphasize that starting out here today because it is a process of growth you're going to see that in a number of places we're going to stop in these verses and note it make a notation to you that this is all about progression and this is all about growth and this is all there's a there's a motive and an objective that God has you here for and his word has a motive behind it and it's for your good see God doesn't always explain his actions to you and sometimes he just says to you can you thank me for allowing you to go through this suffering even if I never tell you why and sometimes that's all we're left with is God saying can you thank me for giving you the privilege to prove my word by your suffering even if I never explain why see and so so so we find that that God moves in this way and it's all about expression and I don't want to get ahead of myself because I will real easy because that's a passionate topic for me we're going to get there so you just you just carry on with me here in the word of God so in Colossians chapter one I want to look uh first at these first six verses and you just follow along with me so Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ I'm continuing from last night on The Living Word and so so because it's when we say a living word that means it's going to live inside of you it's not just Doctrine it's going to be an expression see all right you can listen you can argue people can argue your Doctrine they can't argue your experience because you had it amen you understand so you get an argumentative person don't debate the scripture they argue with you all day long just tell them what God done for you because nobody can debate that because you're the one who had it now they might not believe it you're responsible for what they believe but they can't argue against it see and so so we find that he says here Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and timothius our brother I love this this is very very specific to the Saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at colossae Grace be unto you and peace from God whose father from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ look at verse 3 we give thanks to God and the father of who so your father and Jesus father is the same father you understand that the same way he come from God you come from God the same way that Christ was in in God you are in Christ see amen this is exactly why when you go to Matthew 16 we won't turn there today I want to keep us right here at Colossians but but when you go to Matthew 16 and Jesus comes to his disciples and said who do men say that I am and the disciples said well you know some say you're Elias and some Jeremiah and one of the prophets and and and Jesus that was fine that was a world view but now like Paul is writing to the Saints the faithful Brethren he said but who do you say it's most important who you say I am the world is going to have all kinds of opinions about me but I want to know what my family thinks about me and Simon Peter speaks up and says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus says it may use an interesting Greek word to him he says blessed art thou Simon this Greek word blessed unfortunately uh sometimes is is translated to mean you know fortunate but he's not saying fortunate are you Peter the word macarius actually transliterated means exactly this possessing the characteristic of deity so it's not about you're lucky it's not you won the lottery it's that Peter the way you recognize me is because we have the same father we came from the same gene pool and that's how you know who I am the world thinks I'm Beelzebub but you know better there's an element down inside of you that a prophet would say it's the seed Gene of almighty God and that is a part of God that is Zoe life that's not that's not a gift from God that is God Hallelujah it's one thing to get a gift it's another thing to get the giver [Music] and and and this is how Peter this is how I recognize you I say thou art Peter because I recognize you too I recognize you you recognize me this is this is this is God being recognized in his people so we have this common father he is the god he says here Christ which are closing Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints wow am I about to do something I never do it oh I feel better now verse 4 again since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints for the Hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel now that's an interesting way to say it listen look at it again and we're building a case now so just keep following on you I'm gonna put all this together for you these pieces are all going to fit as we go all right read it verse 5 again for the Hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel now there are many versions of the Gospel today now there's only one truth Jesus said I'm the way the truth and brother Brandon would always fall back on that and say he's his word in the beginning was the word it was with God it was God and it was made flesh and so so we so you cannot disassociate Jesus from his word which makes it impossible which which which literally invalidates the claim of the world today who say we have Jesus we love Jesus we believe Jesus but they deny the word so that you can't you because Jesus is his word you can't separate them this was this was why the godhead was attacked uh right off the bat in the early church that's why gnosticism began rising up and and they began separating Christ from the word they didn't they didn't want to see it that way because if they believe that Jesus was the word made flesh then that meant there was a standard for them to live and they didn't want to live according to Holiness so they they said he wasn't really a man he was an apparitioner he's an angel maybe or some some Phantom and and so and and and ireneus just you know put it on him as brother Branham said he's very militant he just called him the Sons of Satan he didn't play he said you're the Sons of Satan and this is why John that this it was John arguing not arguing but John correcting gnostics in the early church when he said whoever will not say that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is Antichrist because that was a teaching starting to move in the church see and it was the first attack on the godhead because if you can't understand the the relationship between Jesus as a man and his father which was God if you can't understand that Oneness then you'll never understand your Oneness if you don't understand his position you won't understand yours say why because because yours is just a continuation of his yes this is an unfolding this is an expression you see and so so this is exactly why why you have it that way you have Ephesians Philippians and Colossians because you know Ephesians is is where the is where election that's where the bride is is called from and then Philippians of course deals with the bride and then Colossians deals with Christ and so so it's it's the it's the it's the one church that that Paul never never had to make a correction to and so so we find that he says here you know the word of the truth of the Gospel say how many versions would you say there are well if we only if we only count denominations and various organized movements of Christianity there's north of 33 000. so when somebody says they don't believe this message uh I just say okay get in line just just get in line you're go all the way down you're 33 0001 right all right so that's fine uh you know but but I do believe it all right and so you know I hear here's what I find and and we find this in people in this in this day falling away as we knew there would have to come A Falling Away there would be people who would rise up at the end times saying where is the promise of his coming now they're not speaking just of his Corporal coming where's the promise of his parasia or you may have heard it as Perugia it's a mispronunciation where's the promise of his pariseum because it meant that God would come in the form of the son of man the word made flesh would move among us again and bring a bride into that same image that's what it that's and that would happen before the Corporal body that would happen to prepare us to meet the Corporal body and there would be people say my goodness you know I've been in this message all these years I'm it's nothing but rigor it's nothing but legalism I don't want it anymore and and they run away from it why because they they never got to the point where Jesus said take my burden upon you my burden is light my yoke is easy my burden is light I'm here to tell you once you're born again it's your whole desire it's not that has nothing to do with legalism or trying to be a Christian I'm not trying to be a Christian I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm trying to not fail because I don't want to fail and if I fail I repent which proves I didn't want to do it else why did I repent see all right so so we find that that what happens and here's what I have found and then you you see them run off to this and that and and I you know my wife made an amazing statement you know when all that began to unfold in my and when you begin to see as they as they leave the light and Jesus talks about when the when your light goes out your darkness is now greater than before you had the light and they backslide they all backslide they all immediately the wind immediately start cutting their hair and start wearing pants and the men start drinking and cussing carousing you see it all the time and it's not failed and and and and that's going to happen because it it just proves the nature was never changed and she made this point she said you know their problem never was with a prophet she said it wasn't with William Branham if it had been with William Branham or been with the prophet if that was where their problem was they would have just made a lateral move to some Holiness movement and carried on with Jesus but you they don't do that they literally backslide and go into the world and you find that that their problem was not with a prophet their problem was with sanctification the problem was with godliness see and you know they say well you know William Branham you know he was wrong about women cutting their hair and wearing pants I'm like wait hold it hold it stop stop women cutting their hairs not a William random Doctrine that's a Paul Doctrine women not wearing pants is not a William Branham Doctrine that's a Moses Doctrine on the other side you're not gonna have to deal with William Branham you're gonna have to answer Paul you have to answer Moses so here's what I am here's what I have found too often true that when you are trying to be a Christian without a new birth you will eventually choose the version there's many versions you will choose the version of the Gospel that you want to be true not the version that is true but the one you wish was true the one that will allow me to do this and allow me to do that and I can still claim the Lord Jesus Christ so this is why there's nothing more important than being born again of the spirit of God and it demonstrates itself brings the book of Acts alive again it absolutely does we're testifying a little bit about that last night the various things I'm here to tell you there's power in the word of God there's power when it's believed these signs do indeed follow them that believe so we've seen the casting out of devils and the healing of the sick and the opening of the blinded eyes and the dead being raised we've seen I I was telling brother brother um Jack last night I said you know the I was I was ministering in in Beirut Lebanon and by the map my son was with me we were in Lebanon you want to talk about a surreal moment where they they literally said okay we're going to take you for a drive and they literally took us into the Hezbollah controlled areas and I said to my driver what are you doing and everybody's staring at us and he goes oh they're not going to bother you and I said really he goes no no he said two two American white men driving through the Hezbollah he said they think your CIA they won't touch you I said okay so they think I'm the cia's oh yeah they think you're CIA they're not gonna they're not gonna touch you but we were we were holding a Bible study and brother Matt was preaching on that very subject on the Holy Ghost his preaching on Acts 2 experience and he starts talking about about you know and they and and these devout Jews that came and said how here we every man in our own tongue and and and they literally heard them speaking in their own language and and Matthew as he was as he was teaching that the anointing began to drop down it got so thick there was actually a Catholic priest uh in the in the service probably seven or eight uh men Lebanese men myself Matt an interpreter and four or five other men and one of them was a Catholic priest in his in his black robes and when Matthew got talking about the power of the Living God to come in and change the life that man got out of his seat and dropped to his knees and raised up his hands and began to call on the Lord he wanted to have that kind of real experience I'm here to tell you this experience is real it's not a Doctrine it's a person amen when when things settle down and we had prayer with them and then they wanted to have a series of questions and answers and I and so the questions were going to come to me being the senior Minister and I was sitting there the translator was here and the men were all sitting around me translators here Matthew's right there and these men are all around me and and right away the man here on the right is going to have the first question and he starts asking his question in in Arabic that's because they didn't speak English only the translator so we had him and he's rattling off Arabic and the translators waiting to get enough of a sentence to translate it to me because he's been translating the whole time but now the question starts and when he he's asking the question he got about halfway through his question and I heard myself say yeah and the translator stopped said what do you mean yeah and I said what do you mean what do I mean well you you said yeah like as if you understood him he said I haven't given you the translation yet and I said well I I understood what he said and he said how could you hear understand he said you speak Arabic I said no and suddenly things got real I thought I felt very funny and I said I don't know I said but I heard what he said I heard his question perfectly he said tell me what his question was and I repeat it though I repeated the whole question and he started saying glory to God glory to God glory to God I'm here to tell you something friends the book of Acts lives and I I would be I would be hard-pressed to tell you and explain what happened to you all I can point back to is the book of Acts how here we every man in our own tongue and I and when I heard that man there was something inside of me translating it as it was coming in it wasn't a voice over a voice I was hearing one voice and I understood it don't tell me God's not real he doesn't live He's Alive he's here today he can meet your need thank you hallelujah hallelujah sorry we said last night you've come too late to tell me this message ain't real I already seen it I've been all around the world with it I've seen I've seen the demons uh be subject to prayer in the word of God and so we find here that he says so where have you heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel now we want the real version right not one we won't wish it was the one the real one which is coming to you as it is in all the world now watch this and bringeth forth fruit there's the one sure ringer that is a sure sign of the true gospel it'll bring forth the fruit of God as it as it doth also in you since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth there is where the grace of God lies is in truth if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin see so now the blood of Jesus it's interesting brother Brandon would show how that no one has the chemistry of that blood that blood ran down the cross and bathed the Earth and God claimed he baptized in the water under Noah claimed it by the blood of Jesus spilling upon it and then he's going to come and baptize it with fire at the end of the millennium and make it for our new heavens and a new Earth so so we find that it's not the physical blood it's not the chemistry because you ain't got it you can't get it right I don't have it the Vatican doesn't have it it's not in Israel anywhere there's nowhere the chemistry of the blood of Jesus is but I have the life that was in the blood see so so this is that's why brother Brandon would introduce us to a bleeding word I'll say more on that in a moment so the grace so now which is coming to you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth this is this is knowing uh in a relationship like a husband would know his wife you've come into a relationship with Christ it's not just a head knowledge that's not the kind of knowing that it is and so we find here that he goes on he says now all right um and he speaks about uh um epipherals and the fellow dear servant fellow servant verse 8 who also declared unto us your love in uh in the spirit verse 9. for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire now watch that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that's a mouthful now he's talking to people who are already born again he's not these people have been born again for years and Paul is saying to them here's my desire for you that you might be filled with the knowledge so this expression needs to continue it's not like God said it met you at an altar and said okay you're saved see you in heaven see I mean we are going home on The Old Ship of Zion but God didn't tell you to go down to the dock and sit on your luggage you understand this is a lifestyle this is an expression they're on a journey and we're to grow in knowledge and grow in wisdom and grow and power and grow in relationship see this is the continuation of Jesus Christ's Ministry to be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding now I want you to watch The Chain Reaction verse 9 sets off when you are filled with his knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding look at this chain reaction what it does to you in verses 10 and 11 that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthen with almight according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering and joyfulness all of that comes from the continuation of being filled with all of his knowledge and wisdom these are the things that it brings on you this is how you know you're feeding on the right version of the Gospel because it fills you with all knowledge and and wisdom and and it's the grace of Truth and it and and what it does is is that it makes you walk worthy it makes you pleasing it makes you fruitful you're in always increasing in the knowledge of God you're strengthened with all might how many want to be strengthened with all might listen not according to your limits according to his glorious power uh my limits are pretty pretty small I don't think that I could defeat one devil but I'm told that in Christ I can defeat them all Hallelujah so it's it's it's not just me it's his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness oh friends that's the thing that'll beat the bitterness Out of You When Trials come one after another and you're either just come out of a trial or you're currently in one or you're about to go in one but I'm here to tell you don't think it's strange When Trials come even the fiery ones because therefore you're good they're to grow you and they'll give you Joy because there's joy and there's a satisfaction giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet look at that to be partakers partakers so the Bible says that we are we are Heirs of God however that we while we're Heirs of God we differ nothing from a servant though we be Lord of all but we differ nothing from a servant in other words I've got all this inheritance I'm an heir of God but I actually am not reaping any benefits as long as I'm only an heir but when you become a joiner with Christ now you're not just an heir now you are are a partaker you're now a joint Heir with Christ because you've passed from Death unto life you're not just got a gene of God running around the world now you've been born again you're not just an heir of God but you're a joint heir of Christ see it's a continuation that means that you're standing with him and he's reaching his hand into the treasure chest and you're reaching your hand right beside him into the same Treasure Chest Hallelujah this is why the Bible would say if you say to this mountain this is exactly why these scriptures come to pass because your will is gone you've increased in the knowledge of God you know you have thus saith the Lord and you keep still you know the will of God the bride knows what he once done with his word so he says hath made us to be hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light oh my we're talking about that last night oh my he commanded the light to shine out of Darkness oh my you can paint a pretty picture in the word of God and talk about what we can be and God and all the things we can have and all things we can do but as mortal beings and and we're we're so aware sometimes so painfully aware of our own weaknesses and our own frailties and we say how am I ever going to get there I see what it's calling for but I I can see it in everybody else but what about me how am I ever going to get there he commanded the light to shine out of Darkness the Lord is commanding Delight to shine out of Darkness amazing see who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and watch and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son all right now now we're starting to see something watch where because now there's a kingdom oh wow really yeah okay so what's what's up with the kingdom a kingdom I mean if you don't a kingdom is the people right went to a King any good to be a king if he didn't have a kingdom I understand so that's the whole thing that made him a king is he has subjects and so there's a kingdom of his son this this you know this is why when when they come to Jesus and you know and they're they're trying to make him a king and all you know trying to run ahead of the scriptures and you know they they can't never seem to get it right and and there and and Jesus says listen accept a corn of wheat die it abideth alone but if it die then it'll bring it'll come back multiplied see so the intention of God was never to live bottled up in one man walking the shores of Galilee that was never God's plan never God's plan was always to send that one to be their total satisfaction of the believer and then by his death burial and resurrection and then that life returning back into the church his ministry could be continued on the earth the word made flesh again in a many-membered body that's the plan of redemption that's the kingdom see Jesus when he's being questioned by pilate and he says you know they say you're a king and you know are you a king and Jesus says somebody tell you to say that but yeah what do I know am I a Jew your own people are accusing you and he says your Jesus says Thou sayest I am a king in other words you're not wrong you're correct in saying I am a king Paula said because pilate said oh so you are a king he said if my if my kingdom were of this world my subjects would fight for me he said oh so you are a king he said to this end was I born right for this cause came I unto the Earth that all who believe that all who come to me would come to the truth and Believe on the truth see and pilate such a such a fatal question because it's the wrong question people miss the right answer because they get the wrong question and pilate said what is truth what should have been who is truth had he just flipped that and said who is truthy that had a chance but instead he looks at truth as a what it's not a what it's a who see and so Jesus is making a point here no my Kingdom's not yet if my kingdom was here my subjects would defend me they in other words they would live for me my Kingdom's coming after the upper room my kingdom will be on the earth and then they'll spill out and then they'll testify of my kingdom they'll testify it'll go from it'll go from one Christ to 120 Christ and it'll go from 120 to thousands see that's the whole Christ means the anointed word I mean this is exactly why the the I believe it's uh Psalms 27 I believe or 127 I can't remember I can't remember but children are the heritage of the Lord remember that yeah happy as the man who hath his quiver filled with them see because they shall testify they they shall have a Victorious testimony uh at the day of trial at the courtroom at the gate the Bible says at the gate the Gateway in the Old Testament in the East the Gate of the city was the court that's where lawsuits were settled and and the and the the the the allegory is that a father who's innocent who's a good man who's righteous who's who's who's who's honest he's being brought up on false charges and the false charges are that he's a liar and that he's a scoundrel and that he's he's breaker of the God's law and he's not who he says he is but the Bible goes on to say happy is the man who hath his quiver full of children because they will testify the father will never have to open his mouth his children his Heritage will go to the court and say look at my life look at our life our life proves our daddy our life proves the kind of man that raises us I'm here to tell you friends that's why brother Branham took preached a trial my parents were at that at that service he preached a trial and he and he said I'm giving Jesus another trial because he didn't get a fair trial and he says I'm going to give him a new trial tonight and there was now a family of God to stand on their feet and say he is true and the word is true and the word doesn't lie and this message is real and the pillar of fire is real [Music] yes sir it was the lives of the children their lives testified the father never had to say a word wow see and so Jesus said if my if my kingdom was now my subject would fight they would defend me amen they would stand for me wouldn't keep them they would get martyred but that didn't matter God's word was stood for God's word was proven see that's what the continuation of the son of man Ministry is it's the continuation Jesus was the beginning of a new creation and brother Branham said you are the continuation of that same creation bad see we're reading about it here watch now let's look at the effect verse 13. who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins see now you're realizing what it means to have the pillar of Fire because the pillar of fire identifies the ministry of the son of man it identifies the office and the ministry and they're different the office of son of man just means prophet all prophets were in the office of Son of Man Jesus came as son of man but the ministry of the son of man is a broader term it means the word made flesh multiplied amen see so though the minister the office of a prophet comes God gives him his word and and that Prophet when God put his word in Moses he the Bible says he was God to the people they had to Veil his face because they couldn't look at him and brother Branham said he was that in that state until he spoke the word and when the word went out of him he said he went back to being Moses again oh this I'm gonna tell you something you're guaranteed not to hear this preached an average Pulpit on Sunday morning that's brother Lee's Famous you're guaranteed not to hear this and happen on Sunday morning but we find that that that this ministry of the son of man this is why and and and and this is why it takes a profit it takes that Pillar of Fire to bring a bleeding word listen I've made this point before I don't know I made it made it here some time ago I don't remember it's a good point I'm going to make it again but we find that that the ministry of the son of man when you when you take Moses let's look at Moses for an example because Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like me all right so this kind of ministry you see is going to continue and that'll be Messiah and then when that happens then that's coming to bring a kingdom all right where God's not just going to be above us and not just walking with us but he's going to be in US Christ in you the hope of glory that's the mystery if we got time we'll get to it see and so so we find that Moses now Aaron in the priesthood when Aaron went into the Shekinah Glory he had there had to be a lamb killed there had to be blood he had to have his garments he had to take a bath he had everything had to be perfect there had to be incense there had to be all of this all of this and it's not just pop and Circumstance it's all symbolisms of Christ and and but if Aaron even though he was called thus saith the Lord he had a Divine call from God to be high priest but if he walked into that Shekinah Glory without blood God killed him see not that God was a tyrant or wanted to do that but God cannot be in the presence of sin if sin comes into his presence it dies you understand he's holy and so Aaron had to bring blood to come into the presence of the Shekinah Glory but you see the office of a prophet is different the office of a prophet is not designed to just bring God's blessing to you the office of a prophet is not designed just to take you under the anointing you can go to a Benny Hinn service and get under the anointing the true anointing you can pay your tithes and offerings and don't even have to be a Christian you'll get blessing you can give the Bible says give and I will cause men to give unto your bosom these are laws of nature that work but a prophet doesn't come just to take you into God's blessing it's not just about blessing and jumping and shouting it's not it's not just anointing a prophet comes to take you to conduct you into the presence of God you understand because he's a holy God and you're a sinful man and it takes you say but I'm born again well how did you get Born Again by the blood of the Lamb what blood you don't have the blood it had to be the life how did we get the Life by a Divine Office a son of man Ministry came back in this day just like Moses just like Jesus just like Paul it was the ministry of the son of man because now there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ when Moses went up into the mountain and walked in and out of that Shekinah Glory and never took a lamb never took blood never never had an offering never changed his clothes and he lived he walked in talked to God left came back talked to God and left let Aaron try that he's dead man and see God said Moses don't let anybody break through make sure you keep him off this mountain if even an animal touches he's got to be killed see God's not evil it's just no sin can come into His presence but yet Moses could you see because the ministry the office of son of man is a Ministry of atonement this is why Jesus came as son of man that's why every son of man it's a Ministry of atonement that's who God brings Redemption through oh my goodness do you understand friends and then he says to Moses he says now when you go back down he says tell the people and Moses said Lord we got it trust me we build a fence around this mountain nobody can get up here Moses go back down and tell them this is important tell them not to try to break through on me and and he said now when now go back down and Moses start turns to go back down and God says oh Moses when you come back bring Aaron with you and when he came back he brought Aaron with him and they had no lamb and no blood and no offering and no garments but Aaron was with Moses and he walked him right into the presence of God and he didn't die you know why because in the mind of God Moses and Aaron had no sin you say did they make mistakes of course they made mistakes but numbers 21 proves remember when Balaam tried to curse Israel and Israel had a laundry list of things they were guilty of but the prophecy that came through Balaam says he does not behold iniquity and Jacob he doesn't see it the shout of the king is in the camp brother Branham said what they were not understanding is they had a Brazen Altar and they had a pillar of Fire Hallelujah it has conducted you today into the presence it has given you the Forgiveness of all your sins it has made you a part of the kingdom of the Living God this is what the pillar of fire has done for us see sure we make mistakes but there's now no therefore no condemnation I'm unindictable say you don't you got mistakes not in God's eyes I can't even be charged I can't even he won't even accept an accusation against me it doesn't even matter if Satan has DNA evidence it doesn't matter if he has instant replay God will not allow the evidence I mean now you know you know where you're at now now you're back in Zechariah 3. because that's where Joshua the high priest stood before the angel of the Lord and he was seated in judgment it's a trial Satan the scene is Satan has brought a a lawsuit into God's court now the charge is God you said Israel was your people and they would be your people forever however I happen to know that you can't tolerate sin and they're sinful and they're Hypocrites and they're hiding their sin and they got iniquity and that Satan wasn't wrong he had Israel dead to rights they were absolutely guilty of all of that stuff in Satan's charges that once if his case is if his case is is held and and stands then literally God's Got to Give up the kingdom give up the throne and give it to Satan because God's word has failed and I can't be God anymore all right all right and he's absolutely I mean Joshua is literally standing there and felt the garments this ain't I mean there's no way to hide it there's there's no there's there's nothing that Joshua can do he's straight up guilty and because he's the high priest see that's why it's the high priest because the high priest represents all Israel God the whole Israel would have to come stand only the high priest had to go in so he's standing there and God brother Jack the judge as as Daniel Simon in Daniel 7 Seated on the throne in judgment the judge literally disallows all the evidence of Satan dismisses all his evidence in the lawsuit based on one single criteria just one and he says is not this Jerusalem whom I have chosen how dare you bring an accusation against my family this is my elect Lady this is bone of my bone life of my life word of my word this is The Offspring of God and I will not hear an accusation Against The Offspring of God case dismissed get out of my courtroom he turned out of the courtroom say what what Josh would do about his filthy clothes he turned around he said bring clean garments and take these dirty garments off of him and put clean garments upon him oh Hallelujah and there's Zechariah watching his cry writing all the vision down and he gets so excited he gets so under the inspiration he says put a fair miter on his head who said that and the prophet's like I said it and now the Bible says the one seated now stood up and he stepped forward it's like brother Brown said in Book of Revelation he stepped from eternity to claim the book he was back in there interceding but now the same one John only saw one throne and the one that was Seated on the throne now steps forward and says to Joshua I have taken your filthiness away and I have put a fair miter upon your head because my authority is now going to be in you and that's why a prophet had the authority to say I no longer call you a church I call you the bride you've got the the minor of authority upon your head why do we let the devil push us around you have the authority of the word God has changed your garments he cannot behold iniquity why because I have no mistakes no you got loads of them but you're under the ministry of the son of man you're under the ministry of the pillar of fire oh Hallelujah friends that's what the devil doesn't want you to realize that's why brother random said when you realize who you are that's where your secret of power lies see so now watch him watch him go here he says in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins I still got a little time in whom we have the Redemption have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins now watch now this son that he spoke of remember we've been translated verse 13 into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood now we now now we know how we got his blood now we know how we got the effect of his blood the life came on us see God sent a son of man Ministry the pillar of fire came to to do what an office became a Ministry and that and that that means that God can actually take the prophet home but the ministry continues you understand when brother Brandon went home the pillar of fire didn't go back pillar fire still here it was a pillar of fire and that little in that little office in Beirut Lebanon when I'm literally hearing a man speaking in Arabic and I understand the words he's saying it's the same God who was opening the eyes of that Blind Lady 80 years old it's the same God casting out Devils of epilepsy from children it's the same God helping you to be an overcomer in this evil day this impossible day this that day of Blackness and darkness it's impossible and yet here we stand so this son the kingdom of this of this Dear Son verse 15 the son now who is the image of the invisible God they're first born of every creature watch now so now when when we when we begin to look at it this way for by him now watch the kingdom of the Sun he's the image of the invisible God for by him were all things created see now we're going to understand God's secret objective it's starting to come a little more clear now at this point now these next verses Paul is really going to start breaking down he he first talks about it here in the Kingdom of his dear son oh there's a kingdom so it's more than just going to be Jesus by himself yeah it's going to be a whole Kingdom it's going to be a whole family and they're all going to they're all going to come back to their original Nature by the new birth which they have access to because they believed the bleeding word you see this is why there's no Redemption outside of the bleeding word see the foolish virgin are saved from destruction but they're not born again and they can't be because they appeared the Judgment in Matthew 25 and Jesus made a faithful promise in Saint John 5 24 that when you've passed from Death To Life you'll never come to that judgment and there they stand being judged being separated so it's obvious that they weren't born again they were Saints men Sanctified ones they were righteous so don't go don't don't go out here and point to this Tommy rot of modern Christianity and say oh I I think that is probably foolish virgin they seem so sincere when they sing that Christian rock and I see real tears flowing down their face that's not sanctified that's not righteousness the foolish virgin are righteous people they're sanctified people only they're not ordained to to to this message because because only the predestinated are considered in Redemption see in Redemption not wrong we're not talking about just salvation Redemption salvation a further work of Salvation to bring you back Paul said we all at one time had our conversation in the lust of the flesh things of the world and we're by very nature the children of Wrath even as others now that's not your original nature that's the nature you were born with by a fallen birth but God rich in Mercy loved us while I was a sinner you understand he's restoring me back I've been redeemed back to that image that I had in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and he cannot behold iniquity in me see so he says so now he's going to build on it he's going to build on it more for he's already talked about the kingdom now we've got a kingdom in play here let's learn about it for by him were all things created that are in heaven and are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence see when you realize when you talk about election people struggle with it because they they don't look at election correctly they look at election like a like a like a biased prejudiced lottery pick like we you know back in the days of backyard football or pick up basketball and you had more players than you needed and who's going to get picked and who's not and the guys who don't have to go sit down that's not election election is based on one single thing origin it's based on Origin Jesus teaches us that in Saint John 13 Saint John 15 and 16. he says I came from God I go back to God see Saint John 13 says Jesus knowing that he came from God and went back to God he layeth aside his garments right see and so so we realized that election is based on Origin so I why am I a Believer because I can't not be I know you School teachers that's a double negative I'm sorry but I can't not be uh it's impossible for me not to be a believer because it's this word is part of me I'm like Peter Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God what do you say of this man what what do men say of this message well some say it's a cult and some say it's this some say but who do you say I say it's the word of the Living God I say it's the word of redemption to call a bride to get her ready for a rapture blessed art thou church because Flesh and Blood never taught you that you had your origin in God and you're recognizing your family [Music] glory amen and this is why the Bible shows us that you know when people argue with you about election because they they think of it as fairness and unfairness it has nothing to do with that there's only one elected son Isaiah 42 tells us that the only elected son is Christ say well how did you get elected I was in him as he has expressed what was God the expression he expressed himself in a pillar of fire then and and he wasn't the pillar of fire was in a second God it was the same God condescended into a form that you could see before he dwelled in you can no man could see him but now he's in a form that he can be seen he he was a pillar and that was same Pillar of Fire mode when Moses saw him he was a fire in a burning bush it was a cloud in the day and a fire by night that led him when Joshua met him he was a soldier he's the captain of the Lord's army you understand we can get in met him he's an angel when we find all of these different things happening friends this is why it's so important to always know where the I am is that's why when he said Moses said who will I say sent me say I am has sent me in other words Moses just say you're me because my word is inside you say I am is speaking to you I am you've got to know where the I am is where is he today he's not in denomination he's not in 33 000 versions he's in his bride he's in his church she's the Living Word of the hour [Music] who do we have the I am Hallelujah see now you're catching it see this is Paul's case Paul's building his case so and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself and by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and then he goes on down and you that were sometime alienated enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and I love this one an unreprovable in his sight oh jump jump to verse 26 with me now watch he's gonna he's gonna start breaking this down he's going to take the next step even the mystery which hath been hid from the ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God the Saints to whom God would make known to the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery just a secret Doctrine there's a glory there's a manifestation to it this thing becomes a Living Word a living life it becomes a living Kingdom it becomes a people who are literally I am the vine you are the branches my father is the farmer The Gardener the husbandman a man his life he planted it all Hallelujah I am the vine and you come off of me it went from him to me now to you and now it goes out into all the world it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed see the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed see that's right to whom God would make known what is the richness of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory so when we when we look at this this term now I want to bring a term to you brother Branham uses this term quite a lot incarnate or Incarnation and brother Brandon talks about it a lot now he's go I don't I'm out of time so I'm just going to go over these last Parts quickly but we find that that that this is God's way to Incarnate himself in a further expression you see this is exactly why this is my brother Branham when he stood between the trinitarians and the Oneness and he said frankly you're both wrong oh he must be too no brother Graham said in Paradox as soon as you think he's too you missed it see well then what help us to understand it it's all about expression see in in the formula of the trinitarians in their formula they chopped the one God into three individual persons and that was ancient Babylonian polytheism right belief in multiple gods and they it's uh they you know it's all jacked up in the way they say and they you know all this one God all in one purpose and all this no you got three persons explain it how you want but at the end of the day you got three persons you can't have a person without having a personality you can't have a personality without it being a person but the problem with the Oneness was the Oneness only saw Jesus only their formula didn't include his family their formula didn't include his bride his church his body the continuation of that same creation and that's why when brother Branham comes to preach the missed Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says now it's been a mystery and it's been hidden and no one has known anything about it but and then he comes right around he says but he has revealed it and all down through the Bible because God has had one goal just one goal and all the Bible now we know he worked it in stages of God above us God With Us God in us we understand that he the the first part was to to get to display himself in Christ the second part in the Ages was to gain preeminence in his family and the third part was to restore the kingdom back to its rightly position that fell by sin in the garden so I get the stages but it's all one objective one goal God's got one goal in all the Bible and brother Branham says every life you read and all the people and all the prophets priests and kings and Prophets and apostles and everything is all an expression of that one goal and where he says then we're going to see what it is here tonight in this sermon and when you listen on to the sermon the whole thing is about God expressing himself God expressing himself incarnating himself into people the word incarnate let me give you this Incarnation literally means embodied in flesh are taking on flesh it refers to the conception and the embodiment of a deity in some Earthly form Incarnation all right or the appearance of a God as a human if capitalized it is the union of divinity with Humanity in Jesus Christ in its religious context the word is used to mean a god deity or Divine being in Human or animal form now brother Branham draws a parallel in the Book of Revelation he says here in the second seal now Satan is going has incarnated himself from Antichrist to false prophet now so the false prophet which is the pope he's full of demons they're just placeholders he's not the Beast incarnate yet the Beast is a power it's represented as an animal all right and in the days of the Jews as Antichrist among the early Church in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet remember they crowned him in the fourth age as a false prophet brother Adam said what made him a false prophet is that he preached false Doctrine brother Brown says that here in a minute you're gonna you're gonna hear it you're going to hear the how Satan got his and its exact same way Satan copying God how he got you all right watch so he says he says he's uh in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet to the world see here see her there with her cup of iniquity nice in the Book of Revelation now that's to the church age now but in the age after the bride goes home remember the bride goes up Satan comes down he says when the bride goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate see the red dragon himself so he literally kicks the demons out takes moves into the false prophet and the false prophet becomes the Beast see now that's why it's a it's a it's God in a living in flesh of a human or an animal all right so you see that the symbology in the Book of Revelation why it calls him a beast see he become the devil incarnate the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he is Incarnate in his people then he's got his people Bound by his power the now here's how they here's how he pulled it off the false prophet has prophesied them right into it that's it you wonder why the world is going to believe a lie and be damned by it because the false prophet has preached them right into it see so he says the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and be damned by it denying the word with a form of godliness see not real godliness just to form and now he says here's what brother Brown in the second seal God works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not a gift or just an emotion it's God incarnating himself in a human being see so he says same thing the devil is just in type after Christ Satan incarnates himself when Jesus incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in the person you need to say that about yourself today the very life that's in this word is in you in the very person I have God living inside me I'm a believer of his word I'm marching to Zion I'm a continuation of his kingdom see so some people they where they struggle a lot of times people struggle with the you know because the scripture when it explains the the humanity of Christ and of course Jesus wasn't half human and half God he was 100 human and he was 100 God say well that's weird no it's a paradox and a paradox is something that can't be but it is though it can't be but it is though it can't be but it is but it can't be but it is said it was a paradox in his day on Earth when he as a man yet he was God he said it's still a paradox today and the best way for you to understand it is to see it in you because what happens when you look at the at the gospels and you see the parts where it deals with his Humanity you know he's standing in the water and a voice speaks out of the atmospheres and he's praying in the garden who's he praying to and he's crying at the time at the tomb of Lazarus and you know and brother Brown says that was a man weak is a man weak when he sit down on a rock with a headache and and and he was a man who said oh you're going to say physician heal thyself because he was actually sick in body and there he's holding a prayer line himself sick and he said oh you're you know you're going to mock me and say physician why don't you heal your own self see but the gift wasn't for him he came he said I come not to do my will but the will of him that sent me the son of man came not to be served but to serve came not to be ministered to but to minister see and so that's why the Bible says that you know when he when he was in in the locks of his torment on the cross the Bible said he will see his seed and be satisfied oh and all of his torment friends I like to believe he saw me and you and he said it's worth it this pain is worth it but when people read those passages in the gospels now hear me I'm closing this will make these final points to you so when they read these passages without an understanding the revelation of the godhead being expression they don't understand that it's expression that's why they miss it because they don't understand it's continuation it's just further expression of the same God in multiple forms you understand and so so we find that that when they read these parts in the scripture about his Humanity just remember this for me will you do this remember God doesn't put that in there to confuse his family that's just put in there to confuse the world that's put in there to Blind them that's not to Blind you the reason it's put in there for you is so that it's for you it's a blueprint or a road map when it's your turn to be the word made flesh because that's the mystery coming the kingdom was coming and no one understood it even the disciples caught him on the on the mount on Mount of Olives and he's about to ascend and they said now will you restore the kingdom to Israel they're still not catching it and he says that's not even for you to know that's in the father you're going to go and be and do you're going to go and tear and be endued with power because the program is carrying on now this life that was in Christ is going to come back into the church and it's not going to be a Mr Jesus it's going to be Mrs Jesus because Mr Jesus lives inside of her and she's now that's what Oneness is so it's not it's not it's not a human language to confuse you it's human language to give you a road map to give you a set of blueprints so you know how to live when it would become your turn today it's your turn it's your turn to be the word made flesh it's your turn to go out into the hedges and the highways and compel them to come it's my turn it's your turn Hallelujah hallelujah it's the same word made flesh in the people see it's incarnate it's Christ incarnate in his people see brother Branham says it like this unless it's my last quote he says the in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says look what kind of sign that Jesus himself the incarnated God standing there in human flesh you say this is when he was Melchizedek meeting with Abraham you say that was an angel the Bible says it was God and that's absolutely accurate you go back to the Hebrew and the word that Abraham referred to him as the Hebrew word he used what is never ever ever used in the Old Testament unless it means the almighty God there's no other usage of that word it's always the Almighty and he says that was an angel the Bible said it was God Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh showing that he would so anoint his church that's what it was showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days it be God working in human flesh again this is why the world that's that's why there's a question who is this Melchizedek that the world don't understand who Melchizedek was I heard we got a we got a mega church in our city and the doctor of divinity that's on the air monopolizes the airwaves won't even accept money to get airtime on there I tried to buy some air time and he wouldn't even sell it to me for money hell wow I thought you loved filthy looker but and you know he says he starts talking about Melchizedek and he says you know Melchizedek was just a man he was born he lived and he died I'm like you know do you not do you not read your actual Bible I mean my Bible says that he had no beginning of days and no ending of life and abideth continually I love I love how brother Brandon has put in his Same Old Kentucky simple English he said whoever he was he's still alive say what you want but whoever he was he's still alive today see and this was the mystery this is why the world doesn't understand who this Melchizedek was because they missed the point of the demonstration they're missing the whole imagery and brother Branham says what is the what is this imagery he says it's he says Lord God Elohim standing on human flesh showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days this is why brother Branham would constantly go back to that experience with Abraham and Melchizedek had his back to the Tenon discern Sarah's thoughts of her heart and brother Brandon would turn his back to the audience and do the same thing he's showing the Church of the last day this has repeated and you're it you're it you're in this has repeated it's God made flesh again and the world misses it it was in the Sodom days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the sun man same kind of a thing they see it right there in the scriptures oh we see it right here in our scriptures don't we friends we're not wondering about the meaning of life I'm not here today wondering what the meaning of life is I know my redeemer I know why I've been chosen I know why I've been called I know the purpose of my life today oh let's stand up all over the building and lift up hands and give him praise and say Lord God how worthy you are Lord for this revealed word in this hour we see more clearly who we are and what our commission is Lord oh Father we're part of that great mystery it's a mystery to the world but to us it's the living realities of the word of God oh we love you for this master we know our purpose for being here we have the opportunity you have the opportunity today friends let my musicians return you have the opportunity today with every head bowed now you have the opportunity today I've proven to you in the Bible and by the quotes of our Prophet you have the opportunity today to be the continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ will you accept that today yet listen listen if you're going to accept that then you're going to have to accept your your sinlessness you're going to have to accept your complete justification you're going to have to you'll never be able to serve God effectively if you let the devil beat you up over your past failures and I'm talking about failures you might have had yesterday or this morning put them under the blood stand back up and go forward Hallelujah don't accept defeat don't accept your own weaknesses that you've got to have it and it's just a weakness and you can't beat it I'm here to tell you this Living Word can come right now and command the light and command the darkness he can command the light to shine out of your Darkness today you don't have to be pushed around by the enemy God's family can be free I claim it I accept it I take it it's mine it's mine I'm not gonna give it or Surrender it Hallelujah oh I'm gonna tell you something friends once I once I met him brother Jack I didn't want to be me anymore once I met him I didn't want to be me anymore I wanted to be him I felt like Jacob you know Jacob he had went down such a road always trying to you know figure out how to live and how to survive and how to get what he had and half of what everybody else had and he was a shyster and he was always a con man and I'm going to tell you something Jacob finally when he got there with that Angel by the time the sun fell and the Darkness rolled in and that angel stepped out I'm going to tell you Jacob was so done with being Jacob [Music] maybe you're here today you bow your heads with me save him preacher I didn't know you'd call me out like that I'm too I'm tired of being Jacob I'm tired of being that person that was born with a fallen nature I'm tired of failing hands are going up that's Honest Hearts my you wanna you wanna have that life you want to say I'm going to wrestle it out with the angel right here today I'm determined to become the Living Word I'm determined to be the word made flesh I'm determined that my life is going to be in complete surrender oh that's Honest Hearts my goodness father you see these hands up all over the building Lord that's honest people hearing the word of God seeing themselves in it Lord they wouldn't know what they're even identifying with if it hadn't been made clear we thank you for this Lord we've said all we need to say now Master it sits your turn father you who have given the word now be the watering water that comes down and Waters the seed Lord we've done our part by the Jack's done his part the singer's done their part we've preached the gospel we've sung the songs
