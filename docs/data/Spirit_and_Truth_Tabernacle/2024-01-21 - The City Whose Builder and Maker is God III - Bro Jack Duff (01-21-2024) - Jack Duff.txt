Brandt and his family amen God bless you praise the Lord uh I won't keep you standing long I'm going to go right into the word um uh Chris good to see you God bless you Happy New Year to you amen um I have uh um um we we had a couple of things thank you musicians thank you'all wonderful special there from my daughter uh we um you can turn to book of Hebrews 11 we we had a um a pretty long day yesterday we went to uh brother Jeff's service uh there the homegoing service of brother Jeff in uh pompo and uh after we finished there we had an hour and a half drive to get to kiston because uh my um my wife's uncle uh my mother-in-law's brother-in-law um sister Tina's Uncle um they had a service for him he passed as well so we we we got there uh kind of at the end of everything but nonetheless I just want to show my face and um and I was just kind of debating on some directions to go for today and and uh but I knew that the Lord had had a sermon that I had prepared a while ago but I never preached it for you all and um and there was one more sermon left for the city whose building maker is God and uh it connects with uh when I preached the uh on restoration there the get back in Step uh it connects with that and then we'll make this connection and then we'll go forward uh with the restoration theme amen that we have for this year uh but we we got a lot in store I got brother Chris Kathy coming on the first Sunday of February uh brother um Dennis McBride is coming the third Sunday in February and then brother la fontain is coming the fourth uh Sunday in February and I was like you know it's going to be like a fiary for us CU brother brother you know brother brother Keith Brown uses that Faith where he Don't Preach in the month of February he just let somebody else come in and preach on faith I said well I'm I'm going to get pretty much that month off but I do have to make a trip to uh South Carolina and uh all the married couples that would like to join us going to South Carolina you are welcome they told us to tell you that that you're welcome to come along they're going to be doing a a seminar there and I'll be doing the teaching amen there uh and also preaching on that Sunday morning for uh brother brother uh Anderson so uh keep those things in mind we got a busy month ahead amen it's always good to be busy for the Lord amen uh I want to just read from uh Hebrews uh chapter 11 uh just a couple verses and we will hopefully finish this thought and on today uh I've usually preached it but today is going to be talk uh so we'll have a PowerPoint uh uh slide here that you'll just follow along with me on praise the Lord uh the Bible says here in Hebrews chapter 11 um verse 8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the the same promise uh for he look for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is god let's just have a word of prayer father we are grateful for the privilege and the opportunity that we have to come into the house of the Lord and we trust Lord that the spirit of God would just take control over this portion of the service as you have throughout the wor ship we ask God that you would uh allow us to hear from Heaven through the word may it bring strength may it bring correction May it bring Lord uh uh uh instruction God whatever it is that we need may it bring healing may it bring Deliverance father whatever the word uh that whatever vitamins we need from it may you bring it forth on today and we ask that you get the glory the honor out of the thought Lord that is being presented to the Saints in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen in the presence of the Lord amen praise the Lord so uh again our our uh title today is uh the city whose Builder maker is God and um this is part three of this of this series and you know I I have I I certainly as we started you know journeying through this I telling you all I've been teaching in the Book of Revelations on a little call that I was uh a part of uh for roughly 2 and A2 years or something like that I would get on the phone at 8:00 in the morning sometimes to listen and comment on the other brother's calls and then um every Wednesday I would teach and then sometimes I have to fill in for other others that would not be available to teach and uh but at the beginning of this year I just kind of felt we I come to the end of revelation 22 with this group and um and I felt that it was a perfect time time for me to just kind of take a step back uh from that uh because I'm I I brought you know these teachings on Revelation and and and uh and I'm like I'm not sure exactly where they're going to be going next but one brother said they wanted to go through the Book of Genesis and I said oh my that would be I mean it was three years just to get through Revelation can you imagine how many years it would take to get through the Book of Genesis and I say having a church and you know other responsibilities it's very difficult for me to commit to that a longterm Journey Journey you know like that so I just felt it would be best for me to kind of back up and I'll just fill in where where I can here and there but along the journey we we gathered you know some real good things that I thought would be beneficial for our church not just for what I do online but for for for for us so uh this is for us amen this morning and uh and I pray it would be a blessing so um we were um mentioning you know just next there uh the next that um this city amen that that this city who's building make is God is a city where the scripture tells us that Jesus is the light of the city uh we were able to um um determine you know a couple things and we'll we'll just quickly go go through this but John 8:12 tells us that then spake Jesus unto them saying I am the light of the world Amen and he that follow shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life now uh as we were mentioning yesterday you know you you can't even really start living to you have Jesus on the inside Jesus is the light and and and he we're going to show you that he was the light in Genesis he was the light in the beginning of the Bible he was the light in the middle of the Bible and he also is the light at the end of the Bible amen Jesus is the light amen and here in Genesis 1 the very next uh statement says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and it says there was light now now we know uh just by reading the Bible that when God said let there be light that was not sunlight that was not s u n light that was s o n light that came out of God at that moment so so the very first thing that God creates is this light this Loos that comes out of God and that's how we're able to identify God amen amen so we find this is Jesus and and Paul met that same light on the road to Damascus I could also tell you that that same light took a picture over the prophet's head amen and it and we get a chance to see that God was identifying himself with his Prophet we're not following amen a man we're following the Vindicated God Amen vindicating a Ministry and God always uses the vessels of human beings to deliver his word hallelujah it was God showing the same light that Paul spoke to and we we can we can identify with it when we read scripture we see that light identifying itself with the prophet in this day so we thank God for light we are walking in light amen amen here this next uh scripture in Psalms 23 we brought this out to you that yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me this scripture here alone shows us that Jesus is the light amen because in the Valley of Death there would not be a shadow if there was not an element of light in the valley amen amen so so so when you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death you have nothing to fear because Jesus is right there to bring you through he's the light he's the light this other scripture here in Revelation 2123 tells us in the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it the city whose Builder make is God the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof remember in Genesis the Sun and Moon did not come until the fourth day but the first day when God said let there be light that was the Lord Jesus that was expressed there Amen in light form and uh and now here the end in Revelation 21:23 we're right back to where we started the Lord Jesus is the light of this city amen hallelujah hallelujah amen I have this question that I keep presenting to all that would hear if one rejects the light of their day how can they expect to live in the city where the lamb is the light you can't reject the light in your day and then expect to make it to heaven now now now now don't get me wrong I there are some people that might not ever come in contact with what we have and I'm not saying that they can't make it amen the thief on the cross made it the thief on the cross made it and and I'm I'm I'm going tell you another thing too you know now now you can take this for uh uh for how you want to you want to take it but uh brother Brandon he had um made a statement he says that uh you know uh uh he was uh you know just thinking about heaven and things of that nature and and uh when God showed him uh something about heaven he said you know everything that you love and everything that ever loved you I have given to you now that's that's powerful right and and for me when brother brandom shared that I I took it personal and I say everything that I love and everything that that love me God will give me on the other side hallu that that's just my personal revelation amen and if you want it you can have it too but uh but that's my person that everything that I love God will give me on the other side brother random said in the message um Mother's Day he say he say heaven really wouldn't be Heaven if all Mama's children weren't there God God know how you love your your your loved ones God know I mean without them you wouldn't be here some I mean we got parents that probably never came into this truth grandparents that never came into this truth but God knows how you love them and God had to use them to bring you here so don't get discouraged about those things but but it's it's when you are presented light you as an individual have to walk in the light hallu and sometimes the only light they see is the light that's reflecting in you that's trth can I put it this way you are the [Applause] message amen amen yes sir Hallelujah we want to make sure that as light comes to us that we're not found rejecting the light that has been given to us here in this uh quote here this next quote uh brother brandom out of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride he says Jesus going to prepare with Divine hands a Divine City a Divine architect for a Divine bought people for predestinated people uh he's going to prepare Abraham was looking for it and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God Amen that Prophet knowing it was somewhere John saw it coming down but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then Abraham was so convinced with you know just getting a glimpse it's got to be on Earth right now so he went looking for it hallelujah look at this now uh uh and and I love this part where brother brand said God I mean John saw it coming down coming down we're going to get to that a little bit later says but Abraham thought it must be on earth right then says while he met MDC the king of it and gave him a tithe which had no father or or no mother he had no beginning of Life or no ending of Life Abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up can you imagine that where Abraham met MDC brother brandham tells us that Abraham met him in the very spot that this new city would be raised up amen amen we know exactly where it's going to be the prophet told us that right it says it even gave us dimensions of it amen the scriptures say the angel measured the city well an angel measured it think about that amen the seventh angel measured the city and then told you what it was going to be like put it in a sermon called future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and somebody going to tell you not to listen to it this is your city I I tried to tell you amen many people put certain cities on their bucket list and they check it off when they go to this city and they check it off when they go to that City come on but if you don't have this city that Abraham was talking about if you don't have that on your list you need to get rid of your list that's right this City's got to be at the top of your list I got to make it to the city whose Builder and maker is God yes sir yes sir amen hallelujah hallelujah amen typically we pack and we get ready to go to different cities on different trips to get those those cities checked off the bucket list but brother bandam said when you go to this city you got to unpack yes sir that's right get rid of the things of the world Hallelujah you got to unpack to go here Lord we look forward to this Abraham met him and they took communion right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up the Holy Mountain of the Lord where the redeemed will live oh my that time just don't stop he says uh we'll we'll go we'll go to Eternity so so I'm I'm I'm happy about that because um uh when he says he was preparing a place one of the the the the scriptures that we use even when we're comforting families uh in in losses is John 14 amen says let not your hearts be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so uh I have I I I would have told you I go to prepar place for you and brother brandom even had to give us understanding on that cuz how can a house have Mansions right it it's not a house to have Mansion but it's in my father's domain his his kingdom amen it's many palaces oh for me again it's my personal revelation if there's a palace that he has for me I'm going to enjoy it amen cuz Jesus said in in his father's house there was many mansions which means there's some something there for me oh come on somebody I ain't got to worry about paying the bills I ain't got to worry about keep I ain't got to worry about keeping the lights on because Jesus is the lightall in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas sayth unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know uh the way here's what Jesus response was Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me we don't want to reject the light sir of our day am here we go forward Jesus is the light if one Rejects the light of their day and that's very important I want to I I should have underlined that rejects the light of their day Lord a lot of people believe in Jesus lot of churches believe in Jesus they they they they preach about him dying on the cross and raising again and man that's like the climax of every sermon in chur and and most most denominational churches let me say this too while I'm here because I might forget it and most denominated church when when we're talking about denomination you got to understand denominations are not anything new they just start happening in our day no sir you know in Jesus day there was denominations yes sir where where from Brother Jack the Pharisees was a denomination the Sadducees was another denomination and the thing that they split on is that they didn't believe in the Sadducees didn't believe in resur Resurrection right and I remember a friend of mine say say say they they didn't believe in the resurrection so they're sad you see but they were split they were split you had Pharisees Sadducees you had other groups back then too denominations that Jesus had to preach against sir and so the Same Spirit trickled down to this day that's why we got all these different churches amen and nobody's walking in the pure truth anymore right brother amen but God had to send a prophet to bring us back to truth yes sir that's what this whole thing that that if I could just simplify the message that's that's as simple as as it can get God had to send a prophet to restore the truth and let me tell you when your heart has been turned uh as it's been promised in Malachi 4 then you can say I am the restoration sir Hallelujah yes sir brother my heart has been turned I'm convinced amen I know that this is what God had had in store but but denominations are not anything new it's a spirit that just keeps repeating itself over and over again but God always has to send somebody to bring them back to the word amen John was sent how to get them back to the word Jesus s trying to get them back to the word brother brandom sent try to get them back to the word that was the whole purpose very simple here if one rejects the light for their day that's that's the voice that God has given you to bring you back to the truth if you reject the light for your day how can you expect to live in the city where the lamb is light well brother Brandon gave us the answer to this question he said it in the massachus home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride it says this is for only the Overcomers says do you know do you know uh you know that he said it isn't for the denominations hey this isn't for the denominations now let me let me back up I I don't want you to get lost on this it's not not saying that one person from a denomination can't make it but the denominations as a whole and see brother Brandon constantly said this I don't know why people didn't get it he said it's not the people in the denominations it is the system he was only preaching against the system not the people once we get that dividing line there are good people yes sir there are saved people in denominations there are people that love God in denominations and we're not coming against the people but we are coming against the system yes sir amen oh hallelujah it's a spirit behind the system Satan is behind the system so when he says for only to Overcomers do not do you know that it that that it it isn't for the denominations says you say you mean that brother R says let's turn to Revelation 2 just a minute and find it Revelation 2:7 let's find out now whether it's really the truth or not Revelation 2:7 reads like this we have it there on the screen it says and he that hath an ear oh let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now even in that why would the spirit be talking to to churches what churches is he talking to he's talking to the true church church and the false church and the problem is they get into twine and when the true church and the false Church get into twine it's hard for you to decipher which one is right or not Hallelujah that's why God had to give you prophetic insight to be able to see which one is right and which one is not the one that's right going to always follow come on the word yes sir from Genesis to Revelation they going to follow the word amen let's go on a little further we got some teaching to do today he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the parag paradise of God and the overcoming I can tell you I I didn't put the rest of this quote up there but the overcoming is actually overcoming the denominational Spirits in your day amen amen amen you got to be able to overcome that yes sir okay keep that keep it uh but keep your line straight there on that it's not the people that's not what we're preaching against it's the people I believe there's people out there that love love God I had a grandmother that was in denomination she was she was a I mean she was a strict Pentecostal and even when the Pentecostal Church changed Grandma stayed the same yes I had another grandma that was a Baptist yes and and I mean she would come to church here and there but she never was able to really take all of this but you're not going to tell me come on you're not going to take my promise from me right I believe I'm going to see both of my grandmothers on the other side not just me amen amen and and I realized that they lived in the day when the prophet came and and all that but they just weren't able to cross over to that even brother brandom told that to one of one of the other brothers he says look brother he was so concerned about his family not accepting the message said look brother you can't put new wine and old bottles the brother's like what you just they they were they came up underneath another time and so you just got to let them come underneath that other age and remember now the ages overlap y'all amen but they came up underneath that overlap he say so don't worry about it you can't put new wine in Old bottles right see so you a new bottle so you can take this but don't worry about it just God God God got everything under control hall hallelujah amen amen here I want to bring in a scripture as we go forward revelation 22 and4 says blessed are they see I told you you're going to be able to tell the difference because they're intertwined but you're going to be able to tell the difference the ones that are going to inhabit this city they're not going to be denominational people the system of denomination that's not coming in but it might be individuals that come out that might make it praise God I believe that all right however um since you have come into light we just want to give you the full light yes and and and and and and you know I I I I always you know get this argument you know you think God just going to let these people just go and you know and and and and they trying to do this and they trying to do they they love God you think God just going to let them go because they ain't following the message well it's not about them I'm not really too worried about them if they don't know no better they walking in all the light they got right the one that I'm concerned about is is the one that's asking the question right you have been given more than what they have you have been shown more than what they have you are not even in their category exactly right that's exactly right you in a totally different category let's talk about you come on and look at this the scripture say blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and May enter in through the gates into the city so if you want to go you going to have to follow the word Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments hallelujah amen so you have a responsibility as a believer that has been shown more light than the others you have to walk in the light and not reject that God will judge you for what you know he'll judge them for what they know amen amen I was teaching on this and I just uh was blessed just to kind of do a little search through the message and brother brandom took like four different things um that I found and then you I'm sure there was others but for the time that I found just for the lesson that I Was preparing four things that brother brandom uh uh uh um kind of connected this scripture to that we sometimes do and sometimes don't do and I felt that it would be very important for us to go back and refresh some of this and uh and then on top of refreshing uh as I'm refreshing you might not realize it but there's a restoration taking place I'm still in the channel of I will restore saith the Lord It's not brother Jack restoring it's it's it's God restoring and sometimes the restoration is us just getting back in line with the scripture that's it getting our hearts realigned sir and it's a good time to do that at the beginning of the year I feel so I want to just take amen the the next part of this uh Sermon Just to kind of talk about these four things that brother brandom brought to us we'll we'll read it so he says blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life so this city and whose Builder maker God in order to enter the city people going to have to do the Commandments of God all right I want to just introduce this this this quote before we get started in the message the token brother brandom says but oh brother when the token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you something's happening there isn't nothing going to turn you you know where you belong and look at this full obedience to the whole word of God now I need to just I put that underline and I know you know sometimes people when they hear me say brother brandom said just please don't just hear the brother brandom said part hear the part after that hear what I'm trying to tell you after that don't get stuck on brother brandom said hear what he said hear what he said now dissect what he said come on cuz I mean now don't not not just to hear brother brother random said don't that that's a devil that's trying to put a a a stop there here if I say Paul said right don't just stop at Paul said hear what Paul said if I say Moses said that shouldn't be enough to get you shout you want well what did Moses say if I say Jesus said on Amen but brother Jack don't stop it just Jesus said what did Jesus say huh if I if I if I say if I say Spurgeon said all right all right what did he say if I say Billy Graham said what did he say if I say brother bradam said what did he say this is what he said right amen he said full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token listen and nothing else and look at how he ties the scripture in blessed is he that does all of his Commandments might have a right to the tree of life so the very thought if you've ever heard preachers preach on full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to to the token brother brandham got that thought from the scripture in Revelation 22:14 Hallelujah yes sir yes this is why the scripture follows the thought so when we when we talk about the city whose building Mak is God in order to enter into that City you going to have to follow the whole word of God and full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token can I go a little further for little being to the whole word of God entitles you to get into the city yes sir amen hallelujah he says this blessed is he that does all his Commandments might have a right to the tree of life then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers now don't fail to get that he says when you pray you must have the token to hold over your prayer if you're not keep praying till the token comes that's the Holy Ghost cuz you're not promised to receive it see you've got to have this token first that's the paying price your faith to believe it all right let's go forward because we got to get some things uh connected here for us to come into full obedience full obedience to the whole word of God titles you to the Token full obedience full obedience amen I wish y'all would bring notepads and pens to church when the preacher emphas EXC is a certain point you need to write it down the Holy Ghost trying to tell you something full obedience not partial not halfway full we're going to talk about some full obedience areas can we go further yes sir yes I told you there are four things I want to deal with today so here's the first one out of the message God being misunderstood it says can a Christian go to heaven if he or she does not pay tithe I told you fool obedience can a Christian a Christian go to heaven if he or she does not pay TI now that's one that I could not answer scripturally look at the prophet now that's one that I could not answer script he didn't say your tithing was based on you going to heaven or hell and why is your tithing why you put your tithing on a level like that whether I'm going to go to heaven or hell if I'm not going to hell I'mma keep my money in my [Music] pocket but you say heaven If Heaven depend on if it depend on me making it Heaven here go my 10% Lord that that's not what this based on this is based on whether you love God or not and do you trust God with your money on cuz he trusted you with the money now I'm going to tell you something the government don't trust you they take TI they take their TI or they tax before you even get it home and then they hold it on the interest fre loan and then maybe decide to give it back to you maybe at the beginning of the next [Music] year let's just read what the prophet said see what did he say brother brandom said what did he say here we go go now that's one that I could not answer scripture now I want you to understand when a prophet telling you that he can't answer that scripturally that is a that's that's a blessing that he just not giv his opinion he wants to base it yes sir that's it you got something you can trust now yes sir look at this now he says um I cannot answer scripturally now this Father Son and Holy Spirit if the minister is sincere Les uh just let us let us uh know you see and be glad brother Neville myself brother biller brother Collins and any of these ministers here uh who ordained to this ministry and so forth can do so but now uh does a Christian not get to heaven because do not pay TI I could not say yes or no to that but I do believe that every Christian is obligated to pay ties because it is a commandment of the Lord he's standing right with the word right it's a commandment of the Lord and blessed are they right back to revelation 22:14 your tithing is connected to Revelation 22:14 and blessed are they that do all his Commandments that they may have a right to enter into the life the tree of life now I believe that P I believe that tithe paying is essential to a Christian experience yes sir since he was based on the word I felt that we should just read the scripture on what it say the the the the it tells us in Malachi 3 this is where we actually get it now now let me let me also just mention this full obedience to the whole word of God is going to entitle to the token and and we have people nowadays that tell us that you pulling that tithing scripture out of the Old Testament and that was under law but we under grace and uh since we under grace uh you know we don't have to do that anymore we just give whatever is in our in our hearts well um I just like to say it like this when John was presented the book in The Book of Revelation it was told by the angel to eat the book now John could not just eat a paragraph out the book Sir John can just tear a page out the book and eat that right hello somebody John had to eat the entire book every chapter every verse every line and and so if John was told to eat the book you know what we do we eat Genesis we eat Exodus we eat Deuteronomy huh we eat Matthew we eat Luke we eat John huh we eat Revelations we eat Romans we eat first and second Corinthians we eat Thessalonians we eat nahm we eat Daniel we eat Habu we eat Amos we eat Malachi we eat the whole book amen hallelujah amen and in Malachi it said will a man rob God Pastor just taking the money it's God's money it's not the pastor's money and and no no I mean Malachi put it right all on God will a man rob God you robbing God not the pastor hello will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me oh Lord you done stole from God yet you have robbed me God say you stole my money you done took my money but his grace is still coming after you you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed you rob the in tithes I should have underlined that because tithes is different from offering TI is always 10% of your your your income offering is whatever you want to get from your heart right Amen in tith and offering ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me that's why you can't get ah hand right even this whole nation look at this bring ye all the ties into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith I can have people stand right now I can stop the sermon and let people give testimony after testimony how they prove God and how God Made A Way because they were faithful in their TI and offering yes [Music] sir prove me now here with sayith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of Heaven amen I'mma open up and I ain't going to stop there and pour you out of blessing and this ain't just no easy blessing this a big one that you that there should not be room enough to receive it and not only that it didn't stop there and I will I will not you now this is when you Faithful doing it when you when you're honoring God and you you're keeping his Commandments he says and I will rebuke the devour for your sakes hallu now I know it's getting real thin it's getting low it's getting low it's getting low it's getting low it's getting low the fund's getting low but his word say yes he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast a fruit before the time in the field sath the Lord of hosts Hallelujah that's a promise to Christians that want to abide by the word of God can I make it to Heaven whether I pay my ties or not it's not really about whether you're making to heaven or going to hell it's about do you want God's blessings to overtake you the blessings only come when you doing what he told you to do and blessed are those that keep his Commandments amen full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token brother brandom says this in the next uh slide he says now tonight I just got the very healer brother Neville's wonderful message to the church the Lord bless it at to it and as he left you hanging there on meditation that's good now you all are going to see that I told you it's going to be four things that I'm talking about today I've already talked about one y'all know the one blessing that's connected to keeping the Commandments you know what the first one is yeah y'all missing it tithing tithing is number one tithing is number one get your notebooks out I'm going help you put it put it on your phone if you want to make notes now if you if you're making notes on the phone that's okay if you're texting somebody put your phone down but here's the next one number two is coming up right here he says um and night I just got the very heal of brother Neville's wonderful message to the church the Lord bless it and add to it and as he left you hanging in there on a meditation that's good keep that in your heart all the time and now we're going to have the communion tonight and that's the time we all enjoy I'm sure I think it's the Delight of every Christian's heart is to know that he is coming to keep a Commandment that Jesus left us there's two Commandments that Jesus left us two material things one of them is the communion service and the other is water baptism otherwise there's no T there's no touch handle nothing else left in it see just no Penance and dragging on your knees all these other kind of things it's just water baptism and communion so we're always happy to come to this and I believe the Bible said blessed is he that does his Commandments you have a right to enter into the tree of life or into the city now brother brandham just tied water baptism and communion to this blessing think about that now yes water baptism and communion has been tied into uh uh uh Revelation 22:14 blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates of the city he says this blessed is those blessed is he that does his Commandments you have a right to enter into the tree of life or into that City the holy city for without are dogs whoremongers and so forth which is to be a cast away and then the communion service is always a real strict one because it brings us to a Showdown see as we'll read in a little while in the scripture now I I wanted to uh just uh bring out this he said there were two things one was water baptism and one was communion I would like to take a man uh this section on water baptism right now now if if you were listening closely I just gave you two more answers the first one was what the second one was the third one was hello I want to talk about water baptism first and then I'll come back and talk about communion we have a problem in church not this church but denominations there's two different ways that were taught in scripture to baptize and it's created a really really big problem in Matthew 28 we have uh what Jesus said and this is what Jesus said Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth I don't know if we caught it yet but if all power was given to Jesus who was standing on the earth what he was saying that the power that you think God got is now in me now the denominations of that day the Pharisees and Sadducees would have had a maor problem with that they actually wanted to kill Jesus because he said he was the son of God which me in their teachings that he was God yes sir and here Jesus is making all these claims and they was having big problems with this right now look he says he says and um uh uh say all power is given unto me in heaven go ye therefore teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and I'm with you always even until the end of the world Amen you go to the average church today to a baptism service they will be baptizing people according to Matthew 28 and9 sir and they will say we're doing this because Jesus said it Peter was standing right there yes sir and heard Jesus see this and then after Pentecost 10 days after Jesus died rose again I mean here here Peter comes along and comes up with this new doctrine in 10 [Music] days how did Peter get this Peter comes along and he says therefore let all the house of Israel know sure that God ha made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah for the remission of of of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call did Peter have it wrong 10 days Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost and did Peter have it right Peter had an understanding he knew who the son was how do we know Peter knew who the son was because a question was asked yes sir who do men say that I the son of man am some say you Elias some say Jeremiah one of the the prophets they don't know who you is he say I'm tired of even hearing what they got to say they don't even they they can't figure this out but who do who do you say that I the son of man am and nobody nobody had nothing to say nobody nobody you talking about a half hour silence cuz they was afraid to give the wrong answer but Peter there was something special about Peter man he was all over over the place but he was a special man yes sir y'all ain't going to say nothing I got something to say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God then Peter got a blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood have have not revealed this to thee but my Father in Heaven has brought this to you and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail that's right all right Peter knew who the son was and he knew if if I know who the son is he say baptize in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost I know who the son is I guess I can figure out the other two because he also said all power was given to him yes the son had all the power that God had it was in him right so I got to figured out I know what the name of the father I know what the name of the son and I I know the name of the Holy Ghost the name isus Jesus Christ so he didn't have it wrong he had it right and the church has missed it all these years thinking that they doing God a service sir baptizing people the wrong way yes sir you know in the book of Acts 19 there were some people baptized under John's baptism and they were told you got to be re-baptized and I want to tell you if you've been baptized this way you need to be re-baptized amen you want to go to heaven you want the Holy Ghost you want the token you want the blessings of God be full obedience entitles you to the Token brother random made a statement and I'll just share this quickly says it's like you if I hired you to do some work for me and uh or you got hired by a boss or whatever and he they had you do some work and he says uh now I'mma pay you at the end of the week and you looking forward to that paycheck and then he write a paycheck and sign it boss he just signs it boss he said now take it down there to the to the to the to the bank now his name is not boss he he he is the boss but his name is not boss but tell you to take it down there and cash it in the name of the boss now you already know before you get that check to the bank the bank going to turn you around and say uhuh ain't no way you going to get this signed or let's say if he signed it with his right name but he wrote it out to you Jane do or John do your name is not Jane do or John do ain't no way the bank uncast that check right hallelujah amen so it's not it's a useless check if it's written in the name of boss or if it's written to the wrong name that's the truth brother all right the baptism is useless if it is not done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brandom say this is what we need to do and see again another reason why God had to send a prophet to help us understand that even their baptism that they was teaching us was wrong God want to turn our hearts back to this and when you look in the book of Acts nobody nobody in scripture ever been baptized like this not one example everybody in the book of Acts was right here amen truth brother amen amen amen amen am and here's another one I I'm G come back to this one next week but I'mma say it now what yeah I'mma say it now John did not restore baptism that's right right right amen and I'm going to just leave it like that John didn't restore baptism because his baptism didn't even last until this came when this came they they told John they told John John's people that were baptized say you need to be re-baptized cuz a lot of people try to say John was the one that Jesus was talking about say there's Elijah coming to restore all things well John didn't even restore baptism true but I know a prophet oh Lord have mercy that happened to preach on this and when he preached it just by the mere fact that him preaching it and US receiving it it was restored AML let's go forward so we got tithing and we got baptism out the way so far I got two more to go and I'm running out of time but y'all just got let let me do over time y'all get excited when when your sports teams do over time get EX preach brother we in overtime [Music] Glory revelation 22 I'm sorry Revelation 211-2 says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were pass away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband John saw it coming down Abraham was standing in the spot when he when he had uh uh communion with Mount kzdc he was standing spot where the New Jerusalem was going to be and here brother Brandon told that John saw it coming down this is where he saw it coming down I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband been in the message future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride brother Brandon makes a statement says John said I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a bride Adorn for her husband and where did it sett along just exactly like it did on there upon the Earth Jesus was part of that Earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon is that right and remain AED upon him forever it never can leave him it's always there he and God are one always has to remain and so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending like a comet or a dove the same way a d that the spirit descended upon brother uh upon the Lord Jesus when he was baptized by John brother R said the New Jerusalem it descended oh my the holy New Jerusalem descending like a comet or like a dove the same way it descended on Jesus is descending on us look at this it says coming down out of heaven and setting Upon A redeemed entire Earth to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth for every man that was represented in the eternity and every woman is redeemed then look at it she's been scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his fiery Temptations in the wilderness for 40 days and that after that notice it was ready for his ministry then now I like the way brother brandham used the the the description of it descended like a comet or a dove and I I just looked at that word comment the Holy Spirit Drew my attention to it and I looked at that word and um comment uh the definition is a a noun for and it deals with astronomy it's a Celestial body moving about the sun usually in highly Ecentric orbit consisting of a Central Mass surrounded by an envelope of dust and gas that may form a tail that streams away from the Sun so this Comet forms a tail as it streams away away from the Sun now I went a little deeper and I said what's the origin of this word Comet and uh and what we got here it's uh a middle English from 1150 to 1200 Middle English ketee which uh angl French or old French uh Latin is KES or Keta uh Greek uh uh in the Greek is ketes which means wearing long long hair so it descends from God like a comet wearing long hair Hallelujah and and then it says the other definition it's a varant stem of coming to let one hairs grow now I thought that was pretty unique that this city descends from heaven like a comet and a comet the original definition is to wear long hair or to let one's hairs grow this next slide says this and God's only provided place of worship brother random says but every little jot everything you must be faithful in can can we can we can we can we go back and say en tithing you must be faithful in in baptism you must be faithful in hello in communion you must be faithful in in attending church you must be faithful in look at this he says it's always the little Vine the little foxes spoil the vine sometimes you leave it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave UND done amen amen remember chain is only its strongest at its weakest L blessed are they there's that scripture coming in again blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they may have a right to enter in he says do all God said if it said for a woman to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago says I Don't Preach a closed line religion I said then you're not preaching the gospel hello amen hello somebody God laid it out there and we going to read where God laid it out there amen God laid it out there he said what to do and you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing what little thing the little insignificant Jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little things do the little thing and a woman to let her hair grow why it's just something she can do and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us great things how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common thing because you see your motive and your objective is wrong amen amen amen you know um I'm going to what my job is is just to share the word and I know there's different things that come up and people ask a pastor now what if I got a a medical condition and I'm going tell you take it pray read the scripture and pray and see what God lead you to do amen but make sure your motive and your objective is right Hallelujah and sometimes we can tell what your what Your Mo objective is right we can look at what material is around your house that you're reading what magazines you looking at amen because sometimes we get our ideas from these magazines let's go through your scroll your your your your your your your your Facebook feeds and and I see all the stories that you watch because sometimes you get your inspiration from these other people that you watching hello you're not getting your inspiration from the scripture go back to the scripture Lord this is what you said for me to do and look at look at brother brand brother brand say you know if you know Again full obedience to the whole word of God and titles to the Token blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have a right ATT and do all God said if it's said for women to have long hair now the Bible say for me for women to have long hair but it tell men to cut their hair amen do all that God said brother bradam TI a woman cutting her hair or having long hair into Revelation 22:14 praise the Lord amen I want you to get I want you to get that and not only not not not not not not not only that uh I mean what what what what what we're going to read here in 1 Corinthians what it tells us there a man is tied to that too if you want to enter into this city you going to have to follow the word of God Amen remember I told you John John just didn't eat a page out the book he didn't just eat a chapter out the book he ate the whole book amen we gonna read it anyway I know it got quiet but it's it's it's okay 1 Corinthians 11 and and here's another thing I want to say because people think that when um they Le the message they think brother Brandon made all this stuff up hisself and came up like like like there was no Bible existing before brother brandom came no his job was to turn our hearts back to the Bible that means he had to read the Bible and do y'all realize God gave us a prophet that couldn't even read now that's that's a that's a miracle God give you a prophet that can't even read when the man first started preaching he had his girlfriend reading scripture for him he standing up there trying to preach and you know read look at what it say look at what it say read he couldn't even read it himself but somehow God got him some education that beyond the seventh grade because then the angel would come to him at certain times and tell them not and not only angel would tell them what to read but the angel would actually come and turn the pages of the Bible you read right here rain falling on the just and the unjust now you can understand that you can see why this in the Pentecostal realm the spirit will fallowing this one man and fall this other man and it's and it's it's right but one got an evil spirit one got a good spirit you see why yeah it's right here in the Bible exactly right oh glory to God let's go back and read what the scripture tells us be ye follows of me even as I also am of Christ now and let me just pref preface this by saying Paul said well what did he say hallelujah Paul said be ye followers of me even as I also am of of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you even Paul call this an ordinance look at but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ amen glory to God and the head of the woman is the man amen amen amen amen I know that one I mean I remember that brother coming here he passed away brother brother Sorano but but before he went on the glory god let him pass right through West Palm Beach and he shared something that night with us that I'll never forget he he say he say he say uh sister God call you to be a helpmate to your husband and what that means is that you could have a job that's paying you $1,000 a week and your husband could have a job that's paying him $100 a week you know what your, a week is to do help your husband sir he ain't get too many amens that night but what the man said was the truth yes sir and when we recognize these things it makes it very easy for the houses to flow the way God ordained it to flow amen amen just talk to a brother the other day and and and you know you got to be careful now with these things because he was he he say you know my wife made more than me all my life and and a lot of brothers get offended when their wife make more money they said it didn't bother me and I was kind of weighing that it should have it should have caused you to want to do a little bit more amen maybe you should have wanted to go back to school or maybe you should have want to do something so you can take care of your family but not all these years of her doing that right I mean it might be a season but you ought to pray that God give you an idea that you can be a blessing to your wife the way she blessing youly because there's a spirit that gets upon men nowadays that they looking for women that'll take care of them come on your mama took care of you that's right now you're a man and you need to take care of us I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head now I'm going just inject this uh they used to use this scripture all the time men come to church with hats s in church M take your hat off when you come into the church any building you take your hat off right nowadays we don't forgot about this but you take you're in the House of Prayer take your hat off sir amen amen every man praying and prophesy having his head covered dishonor his head and your head is Christ right but every woman that pray or prophesy with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even all uh uh that that that is even all one as if she were shaven now now here we're going to we're going to see this because uh Paul Paul is telling us the what is her her uh her covering we're going to see that later it's not the Hat of the doily that they put that's not your covering but the scripture actually tells you what your covering is let's keep reading the Bible for if the woman be not covered let her also be Shor but if it be a shame for a woman to be sh or shave and let her be covered now we need to we need to understand back in these times it was a shame for a woman to have cut hair oh Lord let me go a little f it was a shame for a woman to have hair but in society today it is very accepted but yet it's against the Bible we want to come back in line with what the Bible say yes sir amen look at this now it says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head uh for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man next it says this he says uh Paul says for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God judging yourselves amen is it commonly that a woman pray unto God uncovered do not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair that mean he's supposed to cut his hair if he have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to heren for her hair is given her for a covering brother brandham said in this New Jerusalem it was descending like a comet and the comet was like a streak going away from the sun which kind of showed long hair you remember that that that was in the definition and and and and in the original Greek is like it's it's to have long hair so so here God is even concerned about our looks sir even in in in Revelation he's concerned she comes down this New Jerusalem comes down from God and brother Bram says like a comet like like a woman with long hair let me just let me just this last verse but if if any man seems to be contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God but he said it comes down from God like a woman with long hair last week not last week not last week two weeks ago when I preached the last thing I did was I I I had us listen to a portion of the tape Masterpiece and and before I had y'all do that I I had this sermon already prepared with these quotes in it but I felt it would be a real good connection because if if New Jerusalem was coming down like a comet like a woman with long hair then the prophet actually goes on to show us that he saw the bride hello and when he saw the bride guess what she had let's just go let's go to the next slide here I'm just read I don't think I'll be able to read all this but let me just get get get as much as I can it says I fell into trance when I did there there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just a voice and I looked and as I looked this way he said the bride would come in view for preview and I looked coming to me and I seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them look like was dressed different they all had long hair now now I want to I want to I want to I want to just uh let me just finish reading this a little he says they all had long hair uh brother brother Donnie re made a statement he went to Africa one time to minister and um somebody was questioning him about you know some of the sisters over there in Africa had question him out you know you know um uh here the quote is saying you know they all had long hair and you know uh our hair is a little different our hair is a little different it's not like everybody else's hair and brother Donnie you know told the sisters something that I think every sister need to know he said un cut hair is long hair uncut hair see that's one you should have wrote down right there un uncut hair it's not about getting you know your your your what they call them your wigs your uh the the extensions braids I mean and I I'm not speaking against that sometimes we I I I'm not speaking sisters want to look pretty a't nothing wrong with you looking pretty but if you want to just be natural and you know that my hair ain't long as everybody else I want you to do I want you to remember this uncut hair is long [Music] hair what's the name of that store y'all go get y'all hair from I'm just saying I I don't know I don't know if that's going to be in heaven I don't know if that's going to be in heaven sometimes you got to realize that you are fearfully and wonderfully made and I again I'm not coming against you I'm not saying don't do that I don't don't get me wrong but I do want to build you up to help you realize that the way that you are God made you that way and and his eyes you got really long hair because it's uncut that's it that's it they had long hair longer sleeves and skirts and so forth the young women they look kind of I say about maybe 20 now I have a I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I've seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at clock who uh uh what are you looking for I'm looking for people looking at people what are you looking at I'm looking at the Bible I'm telling the truth that's what I see and I can only say what I I've seen I don't know all about it I just have to tell you now he goes on and and and you all know um this this quote he saw um yeah let me just keep reading I'll keep reading it says uh but when the bride she was looking right at the one was talking to me and I I stand in there her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more I don't know how many was a breasted but there was just a group of them and she passed by sweetly with a air and her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her as she passed by he said now we shall review that's the bride now we will review the churches and and they come I noticed them coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a noise and I said uh and and and it said next and here comes the American group The American group and he says uh uh now I'm an American but this just made me sick I am not eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the lead of the of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but just uh but the top just a strap they had something holding below them like this holding below them and all of this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short that was the church not the bride the bride John sing coming down it was like a comet she had long hair sir look at this amen they had they they uh each one had their hair cut up real short and Frizzy looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper was what was hold in hold in front of them but when they passed the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going in the foremost in the back part how they were acting I said is that the church it just made brother brandom upset he he's like H how could I preach and only produce this brother brother um ansy said it last week he says it says if you want to give a gift to your pastor live what he preaching if you want to give a gift to your Prophet live what he preaching right amen he goes on and say he says and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I looked and here they come again and they passed by sweet looking little ladies they was all looking right at me as they passed by I noticed each woman was dress different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched them and then as they started leaving two or three of them in the back started to get out of step and I was going to I was going to holler at them but before he could holler they got back they were trying they was trying to get back and step again that's where we started the year off get back and step and I believe there's some folk in here trying to get back and step again God just brought you a word of encouragement to help you in your trying [Applause] Hallelujah I only gave y'all three but how many did you ask for all right here's the last one remember brother brandom said there's two Commandments that's just left us two material things one of them is is the communion service and the others water baptism and I believe the Bible said blessed is he that does his Commandments you have a right to enter into tree your life or into that City and the holy and the holy city for without of dogs wh mongers and so forth which uh is to be a cast away and the communion service is always a real strict one I'm at the very bottom of that screen a real strict one because it brings us to Showdown see we'll read it in a little while in the scripture so let's read it in the scripture and uh the reason a showdown can Comm Union 1 Corinthians 11:23 says for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord First Corinthians uh 11 uh I'm going on verse 28 but let a man examine himself so communion is a very strict service because you're supposed to examine yourself where are you before you just you don't you you don't want to be living an ungodly life and taking communion you can lose your life that way you have to examine yourself make sure that you're living and you're following in the Commandments of the Lord in every area examine yourself because you don't want to drop dead in the church some people actually Avid Church on the communion service cuz I I know you know few things uh don't don't do just get them right if you need to go repent to somebody make it right with them and just come on take communion but make sure you're living the right type of life exactly right amen it says for he that eateth and if you know somebody ain't living right now don't go and yank them out the communion line they watch them go through but then after after communion service sit down sister brother you know you know and I know that post that you just put up Pastor probably didn't see that but I saw that and that ain't that's not becoming of a Christian if you're going to take communion you got to you got to be mindful of things like this amen let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself and not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many of weak and sickly among you and many sleep for I if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged and and notice that you get you give an opportunity to kind of do a self-examination but if you fail in your self-examination somebody be there to help you amen and I'm not saying pick on people for every little thing you ain't perfect either and when you're pointing one finger at one person if you do it like this if you do it like this for a pointing back at you so remember get the moat out your own eye before you try to get it out of somebody else's all right all right for this caus many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judged ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasing the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat ter one for another and if any man hunger let eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come just one more scripture I want to give you related to communion Jesus said this in Matthew 26 is so important for us to be able to do communion it it's it's it's it's keeping the Commandments of God it's keeping the ordinance of God and um and and and here you know the thing that reason it's so important Jesus tells us as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body right before he was getting ready to go to a cross they had the communion Supper The Last Supper uh and the Bible says he took the cup gave thanks and gave it to him saying drink ye all of it for this is my body I mean this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom that City whose Builder and make is God we going to actually join Jesus in communion so we got to have communion here if we're going to join him there and notice this and when they had sung in hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives when I was teaching this a few weeks ago and I and I I I brought this lesson out to the brothers in uh on the line uh I said my just a a conviction hit me because we haven't done communion in roughly three years it just hit me and and and I want to be blessed keeping the Commandments of the Lord so I just begin to pray about this and and I start talking in you know spiritual things uh God has uh given the church a deacon and not just Deacon but deacons is what we what we're looking for Spiritual things I always try to run spiritual things concerning the church by the deacons that's what I'm supposed to do not just take these decisions on myself we we sit and we talk you know and and and go through so I was uh I was talking you know with brother Troy about something and and before I made it to him I was just also from a financial perspective I'm looking like how can we do this communion how we I I feel compelled we need to do this and I don't know how to do this in this school this is our temporary location until God opens up our next door but while we here we might as well do everything God told us to do how how can we get this done Lord show us what can we do so the one thing we know about communion is that it was done in the evening time yes so if we rented the school on uh Sunday we have to have the janitor come back in the evening time to try to do communion said that's going to be very very difficult so what we looked at is a day that we already here in the evening Wednesday night and we decided that we're going to try our first communion on the first Wednesday night of [Applause] February and we're going to have communion feet washing and see how it goes but that'll be the service for that night it'll be a communion service first Wednesday in February and I come to find that there was so many other Saints in this same channel looking forward to trying to have a communion God is answered your prayer amen and we coming right here to this church and let me tell you something I Believe full obedience so the whole word of God entitles you to the Token you have time to do a self-examination right now so you going to be a part of that first communion service I think is going to be very special amen amen we'll be here on the first Wednesday of February communion spirit and Truth Tabernacle Hallelujah let me just read this last thing brother brand says this in a prayer testimony Los Angeles California says and you said I will drink more the fruit of the vine till I eat and drink a new with you in my father's Kingdom when we come there to that great wedding supper we look across the table at one another oh God just to slip a little handshake over while the tears of joy rolls down our cheeks the King come out in his Beauty and wipe all the tears from our eyes and said don't cry it's all over now now there'll never be no more healing campaigns up there no more tired restless nights no more wheelchairs Graves sickness oh for that great day and then you'll say enter into the joy of Lord oh I long to hear that at that day father and now while we're here together and all of us longing the same thing make us true stewards may we shape Our Lives by self-control that will know by the help of the Holy Spirit to have a full confidence that Jesus Jesus will say Well done my good and faithful servant at that day I learned when I was in school for my degree my teacher said when you're speaking before people tell them what you're going to tell them and then tell them and then at the end tell them what you told him blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and enter in through the graes into the city it's not the thing you do it's the little things you leave undone remember CH a chain is only strongest at its weakest length behold blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have a right to enter life we talked today about tithing we talked about sisters allowing your hair to grow and brothers cut your hair water baptism communion and feet washing blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city let's pray thank you Father for the word thank you for how you're just having to start this year off in such a way God that our hearts are aligned with the word of God that's what matters most Lord that our hearts are aligned with what you said in your word if we want to enter into the city whose building maker is God we're blessed by keeping the Commandments of the word Old Testament and New Testament so I pray God that you would help us not just to see or hear this as another sermon but let us begin to do a self evaluation areas Lord that you have spoke that the Holy Spirit might have brought conviction in and we go forth and and make those STS right repent and just keep moving on that's what we need to do God I just pray you would help us as a church Lord and I I even just want to ask for your forgiveness Lord this been three years that we haven't been able to do communion just couldn't figure it out and Lord I can't even say that we we we put all the effort in that we should have put in so Lord I ask that you forgive me Lord I I I I I want to make sure I'm leading the church the proper way so I thank you that you you've uh uh uh assembled the different Brothers
