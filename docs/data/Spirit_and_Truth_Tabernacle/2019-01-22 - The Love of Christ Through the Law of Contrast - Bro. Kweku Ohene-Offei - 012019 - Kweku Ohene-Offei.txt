Lourdes my time hey man so I'm thanking God every day a man for a man the new spirit of true Tabernacle in man it's it's a standalone building oh three acres of property it's got a couple of houses sent and it also has a man some apartments because when God does things he does things great [Music] so I'm thinking God for the new school in a new church because God will provide he's already provided and we're gonna walk right into it amen amen let's sing a course of this is our precious brother would come a man this morning to preach to our hearts this welcome brother quake [Music] because keepers love me whoa singing against a [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus whoa [Music] see hi Jesus helped because he first loved me amen praise God shall we free Heavenly Father we thank you for such a beautiful morning father whenever we come into a present Lord Jesus Christ you have the heavenly atmosphere for us you have a blessing for us Lord whenever the sins of God Lord come into the house of God the glory of the Lord is seen in our minds father this money will come in our hearts before you lord jesus price to control Lord father we are instrument to other one who blow in our hearts father speak your word Lord Jesus Christ bless our precious pastor but a jar bless the body of Christ father answer each and every desire of our hearts Lord meets the needs of your people father set a captive free father business anyone without father loosen them Lord Jesus Christ and each and every one of us you see daddy we thank you this morning we give you the glory that adapt reminisce Lord every Sparrow sort of a father may you not bind it and destroy it Lord Jesus Christ that you're blessed in our hearts and no dependent lorry of God in our lives we thank you we give you glory amen shall we give praise be to God shall we be seated the Lord is good amen and whenever the Lord bring us here he has something little for us amen so we just want to continue what we ministered at a time on the Good Samaritan and see what a lot of leaders amen before we came to this earth we were a China in God before we ever drop here as human beings to begin this life we were some way amen just like coming from your home to this place before you came here you came from your home to the church and so before we drop in time and on earth we assisted in the mind of God amen so the book of Sam Sam chapter 91 verse 1 and 2 if you can read it just a short Scripture some 91 chapter 91 verse 1 and 2 some 91 one and two he says he that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him Allah trust amen shall we be seated so he who dwell in the secret place of the almighty we dwell in the secret place of the Almighty amen that was the Silesia dimension before we ever drop here and we drop here in time to begin the attribute of God amen let's go back a little bit before even God became God we have we thank all of our prophet he said that before he became God he was called Elohim he was soft assistant amen he wasn't God because God is object of adoration and worship and before he created angels and human beings and the trees and the moon and the Sun to worship Him we were in him in another dimension amen as job said when it job went through trials you know sometime when you go to try us we kind of our eyes become a little bit blurry we don't see well so job was thinking that was the end of him he forgot about where he came from and who he was so the Lord asked him Joe where were you when the sons and daughters of God sang in adoration before even the foundation of the world so sometimes God remind us of who we are events so we went in him we were assistant in him not in his flesh not in this material but we exist in him in a celestial body amen as part of Christ amen the professor that the thought of God maybe we read it in the course of time is that God has his own thoughts the thought of God God is not like my thoughts amen it's not like your thought well maybe when you what think about building a house or buying a car you have to think about it which car do I want to buy how many bedrooms do I want to have but God thought it's not like that is atena amen and the best way we can describe God's thought is like the number zero the number zero has no brick just keep going and going and going and going so in God thought you existed you were part of him not just like a human thought by you existed in the Silesia or in the through phonic form amen you were part of God's life you were just as atena as crisis amen but God we had an attributes we had certain features characters it characteristics in us to manifest so God begin to unveil Ram said that the fred sanger created was angels and then they do begin to worship him then he became God because God is something that we worship amen and so that attribute begin to manifest as an object of worship but that was in the end there was more attribute in God attribute of a king of a judge of a mother of a father of a priests of a son of a child that's why God became a child like a baby amen to be born by Mary amen so those attributes were in God way in us but then something has to happen to be manifested so God among the Angels created we know Lucifer he wasn't sitting then amen the Bible said that he was perfect when he was created but there was a put in him there was a purpose in him many a time we cry or the devil the devil that was just plain his rule he's not a creator he cannot create one little bitty thing no you cannot even create an atom he's not a creator by you and I we are creators amen because we are part of Elohim but then God has to creat the devil or Lucifer to function in a certain way so that we can bring the attribute of redemption into manifestation so we know the Bible said that he was perfect until what sin Oh a new key to was found in him that is when you begin to manifest is true callus amen so he brought order we know what is going on in the world but it's all for purpose amen that was actually working for you and I because without that we cannot manifest what is in US without Satan God cannot be a redeemer amen without somebody sick at the hospital doctors nurses pharmacists who don't have what to do amen so there should be somebody sick for the doctor to go to work and work there should be a fallen man for God to come down and any time and and redeem the funny man amen so Satan is doing just exactly the lord puddi puddi nod to do he's not nothing bigger the professor and I think an invisible union that when you get to know us opposition in Christ that would be useless helpless don't nothin in our presence Amen because the creative power of God is in you by the Holy Ghost baptism by Christ in you by the pillow finding your heart you can create you don't have a beginning you only begin in this flesh but your life that you have watches the China is like a zero it's just on and on and on and on with no beginning amen so God had this or it can attribute in him they begin to create the first one we know he created Adam to be a little Redeemer a lot of God on earth amen and when you read the book of Genesis said Adam what name the things that God created what is the name did Anna did Adam use languages like a lion and a zebra and human beasts no Adam was a creator just like his maker so the Holy Ghost Adam was bringing the earthly things into manifestation glory hallelujah because God is full of love amen and as a father you don't want to have a baby bring forth a child who is going to maybe all his or her life you want a baby to walk when your baby begin to walk you are so happy oh she's taking some steps beautiful I mean oh she's walking now now she could eat babies begin to drink milk but in the course of time they look at their mother try to get some food from their mother oh now she's it is solid food oh praise God hallelujah and that attribute is in God - amen it doesn't want us to be at the hospital of redemption all the time but he want us to be sons and daughters of God walking and manifesting Jesus Christ amen glory hallelujah and so all these attributes were in our Father way in us I want us to read a little codes from the Prophet message from the church age book Smith's manage a checkbook if the brothers can help me just a second please god bless you praise God hallelujah God is good anyways amen so the Lord he has those attributes the professor that before the foundation of the world we were part of him we were part of his life we were creators just like God but then God hast would give us this a monisha instead of coming by the spoken word like Jesus we didn't come by the spoken word like we know amen we came by God by the civilization of the devil which is what sex birth and so that put a limitation and blindness in our eyes we didn't even know who we were or that we know is the earthly things everybody's struggling for money popularity power and things like that but in us we're attributes of redemption I don't know if you can get is a paragraph 140 49 as position of the syringe hig Church edges the Smiths manage a checkbook paragraph 149 but let's go ahead if the Academy will continue amen god is good lessen the cost let's read our main scripture in the course of that if you can read a Luke chapter 10 that is the main scripture when I use get it other way Luke chapter 10 the story of the Good Samaritan there's 32 let's say 36 Luke chapter 10 32 36 somebody want to read for us any other brothers brother Mike first now by chance a certain priest came down the road and when he saw him he passed by one on the other side likewise a Levite when he arrived at the place came and looked passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion so he went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring on oil wine and he set him on his own animal brought him to him and took care of him on the next day when he departed he took out two denarii gave them to to the innkeeper and said to him take care of him and whatever more you spend when I come again I will repay him to pay you so which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves amen praise God thank you brother god bless you amen so which of this is his neighbors as we know we we talk about the Good Samaritan we know we're in a part mind of God Jerusalem means God city of peace amen Jeremy's God in the Hebrew language Shalom or Salam means peace that's why we get peace Shalom peace be unto you so we went in the city of peace comfortable didn't we know what is law what is sin what is unbelief what is ungodliness it wasn't part of that civilization amen but then we had this attribute in us to manifest we begin our journey to from Jerusalem to Jericho what is from eternity to this earth in time to manifest the eternal attribute of Christ so Jericho is the earth which is in time which we begin our journey now in the coming from Jerusalem to Jericho originally the original plan of God was to come by the spoken word of God is to come by the mouth of brother Jack but it's cooking when when he pretty wet there's a creative power there's a creative force to create sons and daughters of God just like God speak his word into creation just like God speak Adam into creation but we know we didn't come by that route because we came by that route there will be nothing to redeem so the devil Lucifer was making a way for God or for us to bring our Redemption retentive attribute in us amen so the thief the man fell among thieves on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho which beat him took his money his virtues robbing from everything that he had and this one was half dead half alive amen why was he half dead because by his own virtues he was one a sinner should a sex bed there was nothing good about us amen but at the same time there was something living in us there was a seed of God what is the City of God it's not like a mango seed but is the thought of God concerning you and I amen before your body was dropped here you were that part of God as we are talking about this flesh was just people working on this flesh your flesh my flesh amen it was also elected but it wasn't in any form it was in the form of Solomon it wasn't in my phone it was just calcium potassium aluminium chlorine cosmic light on this earth amen but at a point a time God using your mom and your dad to bring their life if you if you can notice I don't know sometime pregnant women when they are pregnant they eat something strange food food that they are not used to let me give example maybe somebody might have married for some time their wives it or I don't like perhaps I don't like seafood but now she's pregnant she's calling for seafood why the sisters know what I'm talking about why is she calling for craps why is she calling for shrimps because the body the baby of the body needs calcium in this phosphorus and potassium to be born right so the mother who is a creator who is part of God is calling for that into creation amen so that your body that is lying down through the famine through grocery through Tomatoes through potatoes through corn your body that was elected before the foundation of the world will be coming to form that you are in amen so the mother who is part of God was building this body together with God God put the first in their mother the mother say oh I want to sweetheart I want this I want chips I want a potato I want fries I want this he's creating calling the body of the son or the daughter into a form into creation into a manifestation as it was redeemed before the foundation of the world so this baby is born healthy profit normal will sustain element from the professor that when a baby is in the womb the baby doesn't have their life is just living on the muscles of the of the mother amen very comfortable now when a baby draws on earth if he's a pretty steady baby of God goddess within a life form and this life goes right into the baby then the baby begin to yell life begins for the baby amen why do baby cry when they are born so the sisters can tell me what did they cry they were in the comfortable room of the mother now they drop on the earth sometimes they have to spank them to breathe oxygen suffering begins just like a man the story of the Good Samaritan so life has began for the baby now he has to breathe oxygen not through their mother he also uses nostrils he has to begin to crawl he also begin to nest from the mother's breast so now life has begun for the baby just the same way this Samaritan was this person on the route from Jerusalem to Jericho began his life now when he was that a Bible said as we ready said the Good Samaritan poured oil and wine into his wound we are where Bruce we were tortured you were useless we were worthless we were smelling in sin my god what what is the oil the holy goose what is the wine the stimulation of the revelation when you hear the word when you hear the ego message stimulate your heart no I'm not just a human being I am part of my father I'm a daughter of the great ego among eaglets I'm not bound under chicken I'm not a Dean for denomination this is no way I belong to you now this doctrine Trinity is smelling it there's no what I'm supposed to be and you dick you to death sitting you the wine and the oil begin to stimulate you and begin toward the attribute of God of redemption we do to move you from the denomination from sin from unbelief in toward into the real you amen the ray you is what the Word made flesh it is Jesus Christ in your flesh it is the pillar of fire in you so you hear but our dad preaching you hear a brother and sister giving testimony I've never had this before I've been in church for maybe thirty years I've been in Roman Catholic Baptist Pentecostal and Namur the denomination I've never heard anything like this before and it dawns on your heart it plays deep calling for the deep amen and that is who you are amen so now this man who this person put him in an inn then in a significant significant hospital and also signified Redemption amen so God has redeemed this man but that is not the end of the story you don't go to hospital have a surgery you get world and you stare at a hospital forever no you go back to your house go back to job and do things you're supposed to do amen so God didn't redeem us just to be redeemed and just sit down God has a word for you to do the Holy Ghost has a redemptive attribute that you are also going to redeem others amen it could be your family maybe you are not supposed to preach my brother Jack you are not going to be a pastor library Jack you are no good to be but Ibraham going around the world seven times but in your own home you've got to go around your home seven times remain in your family you got to go around your family seven times all that your children your parents your uncle's your loved ones their lives has been coded into your heart amen so anti you the Lord is using you to bring them also out from from sin and unbelief to into redemption into the in into the sill of the Holy Ghost amen so entire demon you understand you but you had a redeemer just like I did understand Jesus Christ you have toward keep believing keep trusting keep praying for them keep applying the token in your heart upon your family amen and as you keep applying the creative voice of God which is in you will bring them into creation amen so this man that the Bible said that he was put on a beast what is the Beast is the power of God if you look at we have time we can read a John chapter 1 verse 10 sorry John 1:12 the book of John chapter 1 verse 12 it says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name Amen so does that receive Jesus Christ he give them power what is the power the Holy Ghost amen what is holy goose is eloheem himself what is the Elohim is a tree of life it is the true you amen it is your celestial body it is that one that has no beginning has no end this guy just like you clooth he has a beginning that's why we have birthdays right we celebrate one day we're gonna celebrate the last birthday but that is not the end of us the true bara Mike the true brother Jack is right on the inside he has no beginning he has no end he's like a zero he's just wanted to manifest and manifest and manifest amen so we are still on to Redemption we are not afraid of death we are not afraid of Hell we are not afraid of sin because we are more than that Amen we are part of Christ himself we are manifestation of Jesus Christ on earth now amen if the Lord will do something on earth is not going to bypass you is going to do it through you amen you can find a code for me praise God hallelujah the Lord is good okay let's go on let me read this code in the in the stead of that until we get it let's read I don't know if this one it's coming from it's coming from I don't know the message title but I think it's coming from the year is 1950 August 14th 15 so 50 - 0 8 - 1 4e 15 it was a healing of a blind man in Camden a cancer but I can't read it from here if they if they if they get it now but Rama was talking about going through a cancer Camden and then he met came across this man who was blind he was a colored person in those time they had segregation which they called a Jim Crow law is that right so let's see what happened let's see what is behind you but the Bible said that all heaven and all eternity is behind and in you and before you amen so let's see let's read from a thank you brother that's from testimony let's read from and is that I had somebody Halloween messy messy messy okay we are right there right okay let me see the same things that may seem messy and I'm happy to turn and look standing off to himself in Arkansas they have what they call a Jim Crow law colored and white can't can be together I'm from the south but I don't think that is right so I look over and there's two that they're still an OBE for old a poor old colored man standing there a jet little rim of white hair and his hair he had his cup in his hand his wife was standing by him and he had his hands up blind as he could be saying massive mercy that she has streaming down his cheek that was the other contrast the contrast of suffering before the law before the Lord who bring Redemption is love he asked allow the devil to put us in the condition of suffering and in pain and in sin so that you can see the Magnificent love of God so this one was blind as blind could be he couldn't see the tears coming down his cheek I thought of old blind Bartimaeus standing at the gates of Jericho sometime what God is about to fulfill a scripture he put you back in the scriptures already fulfilled amen is that a blind but he was standing at the gates of Jericho looking around studying moving on the Holy Spirit said go over there where he sat I turn I turn aside they said don't go there bruh bruh I said but the Holy Spirit tells me go over there I went over there and that drawed and they draw a ring I never forget what his wife said she said they passed the person and them coming to you honey I walk over the edge where he was his old feeble hand said is that you pass on Brian I said yes a he thought my face he said you use a young man I said not to young said I'm 36 years old he fooled around over my face said parson brown you got you got it just a minutes to listen to me I said yes sir he said my old mummy had religion like you got religion said she never told me a lie in all her life said Pastor Brian she's been dead now many years said I've been blind and drawing a blind pension for about 10 years said I lived about 200 miles from here I never heard of you in my life but said this morning about 3 o clock I woke up in the room and of course I can see but to look right standing before me stood my old mummy this is a man who is tone blind how come you could see its own mummy what kind of ice this ice is not waking the liquid and and the light system whatever you call it i io din and all the chemicals in them is not waking but this one could see his mommy how could he see his mommy let's find out hallelujah is that my old mummys had religion like you standing before me it's a ravine let me see what did I get two stood before me and I said mommy is that you she said yes honey and she said go down to Camden Arkansas rice and put on your clothes and ask for somebody by the name of Braham that's praying for the sick you shall receive your sight the mummy wasn't even I don't think the mummy was living in the desert bruh hound how could a mummy new Barbra huh eternity speaks for you it doesn't matter what you've been through it doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't matter what you go through eternity speaks for you eternity has no limitation you might as in the flesh can have limitation in your body in your finances in your home in your family but eternity I can't go through this wall I'm stuck but eternity me Jesus Christ in me has no limitation he can be everywhere he want to be amen so let's go out let's go ahead he said that person Brown will pray for you so before the foundation of the world we are all part of God amen in eternity there's no limitation and instant is not far away it's not on the money's right here in another dimension amen so let's see second is a can you help me oh my I thought God you you witness it these stones will cry out something has to say it I just put my hands over his eyes and said father I don't understand but if you have sent this brother here I asked for his sight even a prophet he didn't understand he didn't have any vision the vision wasn't given to bowdabra ham but the vision was given to the man who had the condition amen the pastor may not know what you are going through but the Holy Ghost in you can let the pastor bring something out now be exactly what you need the pastor may not know what you are going through in your life but the Holy Ghost in Him who minister and to solve the problem in your life the RAM said are can we have confidence in one another is easy to say oh I believe in God but can you believe on a jack can you believe that his weight that is coming from him is not his way but is the word of the Almighty to you in man and he said brother I asked for your side I took my hand off he was smiling wiped his eyes look around and kind of smart said I see honey she said you see honey see that sure see them before they're in that red car sitting behind you Wow she fell on her knees and screamed to the top of her voice about that time the people begin to break in next and I knew I was in a car amen the job has already been done amen God has no limitation the loss of God is beyond a loss of man amen if God want you to be whatever he want you to be it doesn't matter the loss of man the Holy Ghost will breed a loss of man to me put you where you want you to be this man was blind he was a colored man he couldn't mix with but Abraham they would even leper Brown but I said the Holy Ghost in him working in this man the two funny of their mother spoke to their man the same Christ was working in but Abraham bring him but Abraham deep : for the deep he said the Holy Ghost said I should go it doesn't matter he's my brother and he went and pray for this man and his receiving side amen and whatever you need is in you what are the Holy Ghost is inform of you in this seed if you haven't got the Holy Ghost and you are crying for it is in you keep hearing their wait keep listening to brother Jack keep listening to the word keep rain it should be manifest in your heart amen jesus said in Luke chapter 10 sorry Luke chapter 17 verse 21 he said people were the Pharisees came to Jesus they were talking about where is the kingdom of God some said is in the north some said is in the south but he said believe he not the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation but the kingdom of God is within you amen the kingdom of God is in your brother and your sister the Holy Ghost baptism is a new that is the celestial body amen that's why I posted that when this body is broken down we have another body we have another spirit we have another ghost when this Tabernacle is destroyed this is not the end of us this lady the woman her body was maybe in a cemetery somewhere in Arkansas but the real hair was in another dimension speaking to a Sun that go and see a man called Ram to pray for you maybe somebody speaking to you go and see a pastor core pastor Jack to pray for you sometime not all the people who come here were invited maybe the Avena is that nobody was invited this person and this person walked right into the church nobody invited him how did doesn't mean leave around the area but a semi seal the holy goose the gridview funny the mother ego brought him or her to hear the word of God amen glory hallelujah the Lord is good so now this Samaritan now the Lord put him on a beast which is power the power of God and I want us to see how God works in two ways one is redeeming you and the next step is giving you his power to do what you want you to do so let's read from Numbers chapter 10 verse 1 and 2 numbers chapter 10 1 & 2 the Bible said and the Lord speak unto Moses saying make the two trumpets of silver and of a whole piece thou shalt make them and that may use them for the callin of the assembly and for the ginning of the camps so one piece of trumpet a sorry of sava make two trumpets one called assembly and one to Jenny in the camps what does serve a significant as signified sorry server means what Redemption it means glory means and attributes of : of blowing trumpets so silver was to call sons and daughters of God just like a man who felt on the route from Jerusalem to Jericho God through the Good Samaritan Jesus Christ call you with us of a trumpet that my son this is no way you have belong to you're not going to die in your sin you are not going to dine in your problems I am your Redeemer so he came with a word of the hour and brought you from the sick condition and cleanse him washing from sin and unbelief but then he put a power of God the Holy Ghost which is the Beast the Beast in the Bible means power horse in the Bible means power is the power of God in the church amen the power of God is not in the collapse the power of God is not in Vatican but the Pope got is a humble man and humble past about a jack is Mohammed sisters and hammer brothers that is how God manifest his power God in simplicity God is not a complicated God he's very simple he's got all the power on earth but it's very simple amen so the power of God that's what trumpet one is to redeem us bring us onto the seal of God for you to know that you are not just idly bound you are not another chicken you are 2:14 one of you is the flesh which you go back to the dust and what the body through you is that chana life in you is Jesus Christ in you and Jesus Christ in you has no limitation if you can read a little garden simplicity if you can put on up 6 508 22m sorry limbs correct yeah 6 508 22m got in simply cinema hallelujah it's talking about the creative power of God in our lives and then what we get to know who we are their mother their voice even we don't even think about the devil we don't think about demons we don't think about circumstances when there's a circumstance it means the Holy Ghost is about to do something so you don't look at your circumstance you look at Christ in you the expression of glory it's not as something we hope for but it says present that life of Jesus Christ in us so let's see let's look at that scripture it's a lot Jesus in the way of humility in a way of humbleness in the way I offer you this congregation that is on their feet I offer them to you because they have stood in response to the call how many have responded to the call of God glory hallelujah they are second deep Athens we all seek in the patterns of God they are second more life after hearing that the blood of Jesus Christ who thoroughly cleanses and there's no more nothing that a complete Word of God rests within them how many I've got the Holy Ghost baptism that is the Word of God and this Holy Ghost rest within them that a very command of the Evoque that that the very command of their own voice is creative power amen that the very common of their own voice is a creative power so your voice is no longer just your voice your voice is not a voice of vanity but is a creative voice it is Jesus Christ speaking it is data speaking it's eternity speaking glory hallelujah because in them is the holy smoly ghost and this Holy Ghost is a creator amen so Holy Ghost is what is a creator and when the Holy Ghost comes into you would you become a creator because what about you eat you become what you eat amen when the human life eat flesh tomatoes mangoes chips corn whatever bread you bought human flesh you bought cells and tissues but then when the Holy Ghost in you the cry see you the City of God the Pinot fine you feed on the Word of God you become what you become Christ according to Genesis chapter 1 if Ethan brings forth after its kind human beings bring for the human beans monkeys bring forth monkeys goods bring for goods ship will bring for sheep so one God have children or God has children God bring forward God's glory hallelujah glory hallelujah so he said and this Holy Ghost is a creator he makes things come to pass because he speak the word and the word spoken becomes God in action the well spoken becomes God in action that is where the Lord wants us to be one part of the sava trumpet is to what is to bring redemption is to call us to assembly is to bring you to come and hear the word of brother Jack but there's another part that you want to go back you go back home you are going to express that life what you received from the church what you see from the word you are going back to express that creative voice in you because you are created just like your makeup just like our Father amen just like the pillar of fire that was the pillar of fire now is it in heaven somewhere tied in some way over the moon over the Pluto no it's right in your heart it doesn't matter that treasure comes your way just look within you look at Jesus he was a humble man he wasn't a giant he wasn't anybody but the fullness of Christ the whole eternity was in him one time we went to preach with a disciples and he was prophet it was a human being under present human being and her passing God so he got I'd like you get tired maybe have some low headache tired after preaching sleeping on the boat and now the devil said oh there's a time for me to drown him and his disciples so there was a tempest there was a stone and this boat was capsizing I mean floating up and down and it is supposed by then they habla we see the Aven know who they are so they go up and down just like Old Testament Saints God give them the anointing to do things of God then the Holy Ghost comes out they became human being but our covenant is not that way so pretend disciples were wondering Lord don't you care we are perishing so they woke him up so he woke up there was the problem don't you see that the Strom don't disagree operation is a tea of little faith strong bestow an order storm begin to come down and they said with this man that even the strong or be seen amen it wasn't assistant element that he was wearing it wasn't a flesh and blood hours that Tom were obeying but it was the deity of Christ in him Amen it was a Holy Ghost in him it was Elohim Christ in him that's why it's most important to barometer that the most important thing in your life is not money and gold but is what revelation of Jesus Christ personally in your heart amen because when you live here you can t put a job to your house no he loves you by the gospel Jack I've got trials in my workplace in my school please can you go with me in case at the trash can you had a past that you visit for me no here's what is here's good enough you know he has got a church on his shoulder so you have the Holy Ghost and whatever you go back home wherever on the streets you the Holy Ghost in you is going to face a trial and overcome that triumph and bring her testimony back to the church amen you don't let a trial verkami you if the trial become it then we haven't known opposition yet but we have to know the opposition that you are a son a daughter of God you are not just a human being eating bread and corn and you die away no you are a China just like the woman that pray for the son who I mean visit the blind son your life doesn't end when they put this guy on the graveyard no his sistine element was lying somewhere in Arkansas but the woman herself was an eternity and Bram said in a message Christ is revealed in his own way that eternity is that when you go to heaven we're gonna find out heaven is not somewhere in the sky somewhere it's right here it's in you isn't a dimension which is faster than this dimension this eyes can see so far but as an eye of eternity that was can see beyond what you cannot see amen the blood now could not see with his physical eyes but there's an another eye there's a high of Revelation there's an IO vision there's an eye of Dreams there's an eye of a tournament a physician of cries and when it comes into existence no demon can do nothing to you you are as patina as Athena can be you are as Christ as Christ can be you are as God as God can be you have all the eternity in you and all eternity backing you what is our problem we are human miss of course we cry we mourn we fall and rise we go into problems and issues but don't look that it should be the Eurovision amen see that that issue is for God for the glory of God find the man of God concerning your issue find a man of God concerning your problem Lord why did you pay me this problem why did you permit me to get sick why did you permit my loved one to be sick God want to glorify himself in you amen so he want you to speak you want us to get to a point where we can just like the creative voice can come into manifestation just by the thought because about was that we're going to travel I thought amen let me give a testimony I want to give testimony Wow I'm just about to close this was in San Antonio one time I was I was in the military did well Jack and I had a dream I used to pray back from Africa I pray in the night a lot I pray sometime go and hide in the same tree so I've known demonic manifestation is nothing that ever was nothing so one time I was asleep and I saw a demon a spread coming with a top speed coming to attack me normally it happens to me when sometime when I pray I've gone to pray and I come out to bed and I speaking loudly I'm going to kill you just like I'm speaking to you and I hope you description as I see time this is the Word of God you have no power over me I've seen a time that the devil this was in Africa the Spirit was coming to attack me you know your trials the law to make you to know who you are I was asleep on my bed and I saw another beam coming out of me saying to the devil that I cannot die you cannot kill me fighting the devil this time in San Antonio it wasn't a somebody coming out of me I saw this demon coming out and I saw a ball of fire rolling out of me with a top speed moving to the spirit I didn't wake up to pray I didn't do nothing the pillow fire to do his job and that is what is in you and I and if you get to know who we are the devil is not even part of the question that the devil is creating the contrast for us to bring the other contrast amen and a lot of God's given us the balance you know jet plane jet Lena's got two balances two wings to balance it the Lord has given us two silver trumpets the Good Samaritan give two coins to the in two balances you know the Lord allowed their law laughs is is balanced by law and grease amen love is eternities or love but now a law comes in we are born in sin by law when suppose all of us we're dead incident trespasses then the grace of God came in that yes they are sinners but I've died for them my blood covers them I'm taking the place of the essen and so he was crucified for his book for Greece but now Greece bring us back - what - laughs where we were before the foundation of the world before the world began you had a very love of God before the world began you are the heart of Jesus Christ before the world began you had a very motive and objective of Jesus Christ you are the one who is speaking for eternity right now just like the mother who prayed for who who revealed himself to death to the son to the son that go and see a man Cobra ham to pray for you God can do something for you with Christ in you would IV you moving an inch amen one time in San Antonio a brother and his wife from from Congo they're very good friends of mine and I but I didn't have insurance so he said his wife was very sick and I got replaced we are getting worse and worse they don't have money they don't have insurance so they were just praying that the Lord would do something for them and the wife was getting worse and worse and worse so she said one night a wife woke up he said honey I woke up and I saw but I could pray for me and I do understand Sabra cook was praying for you then the Lord has healed you believe it and that was it the Lord healed them just like that and I didn't physically go to the house to prefer them sometime I go to the woods to pray for brothers and sisters but I don't remember physically praying for them but a lot can use that Christ in you is not limited to this meat and flesh the pricing you can go to whatever can go to our overseas can go to wherever to manifest Jesus Christ and the more we get to know who we are the magis ascribe become I mean so plain common in our life no come on in a disrespectful way but it's so common in our myths because we are the sons and manifestation of God god bless you brother shallow shall we have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you so much for your goodness and your kindness for our lives we thank you for the little pieces you begin to as father anoint our hearts Lord and let your wet bless us let me thank you for idea pastor brother Jack we thank you for the whole congregation let your wet Lord Jesus Christ to the preeminence and bring the eternal things of God father to manifest on in each and every brother and son and daughter of God let your words sweep our troubles and our issues and that the Holy Ghost have the preeminence Lord father your glory will be seen in our lives individually and as a body of Christ as a group we thank you we bless you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Applause] [Music] let's give the Lord and DePriest certainly appreciate brother quake who believed that's just a a continuation of the New Year's sermon we was talking about the love of God through the law of contrasts and you know sometimes we go through so many things in this life and we're just wondering why this why that but rather than action why why don't we just start thanking God for what he's getting ready to reveal through us it's the glory that shall be revealed in us right in order for that glory to be revealed in us then we got to go through something right amen not just go to something go through something see David didn't just go to the battle no he went through the battle come on somebody the the the three Hebrew boys and just go to the fire they went through the fire see and seeing as we go through things and God's glory is declared in us and when we thank God for that we thank God for that brother Quaker was just kind of sharing how you know different the testimonies there the lady being healed before you know they didn't have they didn't have the insurance that had that he never even showed up at the house but you know she says so on and I saw that he prayed for me and and the husband owe me this except that you know whether he come lay hands on you're not your heel and start walking in that right I take these three elements these three realms that God deals in we got to be able to try to we got to be able to catch him you know when he's moving you know a man of God had got what I what I've learned about God is that he has different strategies of doing things sometimes we won't go out to do it for us the same way he did it for somebody else you might want to do a different way for you alright some of y'all might get a check in the mail and that's how he gonna provide your needs other y'all he might give you a job huh he might give some extra hours but no matter how you'll need is still being provided is that right man some yah he might touch you and I mean lay hands on you in the thing going just like that others it might be a process of time but he's still the Hitler and some might sitting they chat not get touched at all and still get healed God got different strategies I just I just appreciate a man I appreciate that you know just thinking about you know he brought out the the mother that was a theophany that's boat back to the Sun and here this man was absolutely blind but he saw his mama in this in this vision he served mama mama came to me mama beginning to talk to me you know now let me let me inspect you can get this clear if your mama has already gone on to be with the Lord we not talk about you praying for mama to come to you that's not what he did the man was believing God that somehow he was gonna get his sight restored and and the way that God used it was to bring this man's mama to and no no they say you say mama got lygian so mama got legend like you got legend see that the man could have confidence he knew how his mama live before him right you say mama got legend the way that you got legend and because of that confidence and God doctor sent somebody to meant that he could have confidence and say if this person terminates and I'm gonna go do it I'm block design on no work I've lived 200 miles away from here but I heard to come to this city now hi he knew the Prophet was gonna be there and here she shows up and say look look I want you to go down that acts for the man Brannan he prays for the sicken and not just not just go get pray for but you will you will if you do this you will come on somebody you will receive your sight that fella got down then all you can said Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy i'ma tell you something now if you want to get God's attention sometime you got to do something a little different I just come just to be a part of the meeting I can't even see what's happening in the meeting but hard sick March it March it sound a little bit like blind bartimaeus if you go back and read his story blind Bartimaeus when he begin to cry out that I mean he got he cried out so hard that the people start threatening to shut him down you know he must have been interrupting some stuff but he see it was it was it was blind bartimaeus did not know but that was the last time Jesus was going to go that way and if he didn't get in touch with him on that day he would have stayed blind the rest of his life I believe the Lord this morning has brought mercy to somebody I believe the Lord has brought mercy to somebody I I wanted to when we know brother for the Solomon told us that he is going to be going into surgery a man on this week and what I like to do before anybody goes into surgery is we like to have prayer and men over them and oftentimes the way that I want to do that is this morning we're gonna pray for further Solomon but if there's anybody else in here that's praying for some type of surgery and now we know God can't heal we don't we don't doubt then we don't doubt that there's sometimes God will prevent you from going to surgery and there's other times God will allow you to go to surgery and I'm gonna tell you he's the same God no matter which way it goes he's the same God and so but what I like to do but you know there there's been many reports of doctors leaving little things inside people's bodies and that's creating problems for them that they they never even imagined right it you know it takes faith to submit yourself to the doctor it takes faith right so you know but but before we before anybody goes on a surgery I love to pray over them a man and just just acts God just direct the doctors and the nurses and everybody because those people have problems just like you have problems they do sometimes they deal with greater issues than what to deal with so we need they minds to be centered on the patient no mistakes here right so we like to pray and if there's anybody else here that I also might be going through Amen a little surgery you want some prayer a man before the surgery we want to invite you to come amen at this time and and if you if you're not going through surgery but you got something that you want through late lord I just I just want to touch from if you want healing in your body we want to invite you to come I believe God is offering mercy to somebody but a quick whoever as you've come from underneath your loin ting and man I want you just to anoint the people of God as they would come man for prayer brother Solomon we'll start with you and there's anybody that wants to get in a man to this today we want to invite you to come [Music] every head bowed every eye closed [Music] so [Music] ooh [Music] sir [Music] to Jesus [Music] to [Music] his presence day [Music] sir [Music] it's a [Music]

bad and hearts army [Music] hallelujah how many believe that is done come on give doc fries if you know that that thing that's done it is done it is done it is done [Music] there's some things the Lord does and they're very personal and certainly we keep that between him and us there's other things that the Lord does he wants you to testify before it even happens sometimes you learn to just give God praise before it happens you don't have to wait till things happen to give them praise but you praise only for happens I believe that of Abraham called things that be not as though they were the Bible says he was strong in praise giving glory to God and that's what we have to learn the B is just strong in our praise giving glory to God right through the midst of whatever it is that we're going through Amen but I believe today some things were settled in this place I think it's done in Jesus name we serve a god a man that has already showed us that before the doctor's hand touches a body the person can be made whole we know we serve a God like that and a man even just do that in brother branham's day but he did it in our day a man's sister sister Tonya was scheduled to have a procedure done just a couple years ago amen but before the doctors hand touched the body before the procedure was Amen time God had already showed up it all happened through a simple word of Prayer hello somebody it may seem simple but it's one of the greatest weapons we have is to pray the prayer faith will save the sick and the Lord will resume oh I believe with all my heart come on let's stand and sing this song say in the sucks of Jehovah [Music] [Applause] [Music] Prince of Peace rain me Oh nice [Music] and ha oh it's a the prayer Oh come on sing it one more time with all your hearts whoa it's not [Music] check for [Music] oh and ha there it's been [Music] come on give God other hand clap of praise the beautiful thing about our Lord is even if we don't know him through his attribute of salvation he still provides healing to our bodies the same blood that was shed for your salvation is the same blood that was shed for your healing and what you go back and you read John 5 and there's a man at the Pool of Bethesda that was made whole of a condition that he had for 38 years and he didn't even realize who it was that had touched him and as he was carrying his cot around a man through the city and the Jews begin to ask them you know what's going on here you've been in that condition for so many years and and now you've been touched and you carrying a cart well who did he say I don't even know who did it so as he went back into of the the the area where Jesus was Jesus walked up to him and it says do you know it says the Bible said Jesus found them and the temple and said unto Him behold thou art made whole so you're made whole you're not in that condition anymore you you've been healed right but at any same sin no more right left the worst thing come unto thee and and what we want to tell you is that you don't have to be a Christian to get a healing but if you want to keep your healing you're gonna need to become a Christian amen so whatever the Lord has done for you I want you to give them praise for that but if he's been that good to you through the shedding of his blood to bring healing to you then he wants to be better to you through the saving of your song the greatest healing that a man or woman could ever experience is the healing of the song I want to tell you go and sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee this pray father we thank you for what you have done in this place today thank you for your word there was an anointing that was here before the word was preached his anointing that was here while the word was preached and there was an anointing that was here after the word was preached your anointing breaks yokes your anointing sets captives free and God we go all the way back to the scripture that was read this morning in prayer brother Stephen talked about captors being set free father and we see that today Lord manifested before our very eyes would thank you Lord Jesus for what you've done and father there's someone here that does not know you in the pardon or see it but they have received your healing grace I pray God that they would also come to know you in the partners sin and may they not rest and today give their complete hearts to you God their lives to you God that they would they would realize that they want to serve a god a man that's able to give him healing they want to serve a God that's able to give them deliverance they want to serve a God that's able to set them free Oh God what the doctors can't do we know that you are able a many more than capable of a doing there's nothing too hard for you Jesus so thank you for the great work that was done in this place thank you for how you use brother quake who just a minister to our hearts Lord thank you Father Oh

go through the motions but we could leave here to die and go to hell god I don't want that to be my testimony well I want to I want to be free I want to live according to your word the Lord of Tears there's any in our midst that have heard the word God and and their lives are not in alignment with the word God made he come in on it Lord don't let them rest in two they come an alignment father
