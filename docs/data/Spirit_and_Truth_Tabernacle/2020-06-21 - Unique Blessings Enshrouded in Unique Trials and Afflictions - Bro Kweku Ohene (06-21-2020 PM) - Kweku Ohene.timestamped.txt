[14:08] the granddaughter ended up in the
[14:09] hospital together both of them ended up
[14:11] in a coma the grandmother did not make
[14:14] it she was called home earlier this week
[14:16] and I should say last week but the
[14:19] granddaughter actually they lost her

[31:02] become the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:04] we love our earthly fathers the lovers

[31:32] he fed you he protected you he healed
[31:35] your sickness he put you together when
[31:37] we were falling apart amen and that is

[31:51] amen

[32:50] amen amen where will we be without the
[32:53] law Jesus Christ where will I be I might

[33:04] for prizes and had a terrible accident
[33:06] three people died on this spot the
[33:09] engine of the vehicle that collided with
[33:11] my vehicle the engine was roaming in the
[33:13] atmosphere
[33:14] my father wasn't there my mother wasn't
[33:17] there but I had a father above who
[33:20] showed me amen that was the law Jesus
[33:23] Christ himself amen
[33:25] and you can testify something similar to
[33:27] that that without him you wouldn't be
[33:29] standing here glory to be to his name
[33:31] Amen let's say take another scripture we
[33:36] what shall we be seated sorry we want to
[33:39] talk about unique blessings and shrouded
[33:44] in unique afflictions amen
[33:48] last week the Lord blesses I was a
[33:51] brother smileys please and the Lord put
[33:54] that topic on my heart to preach unique
[33:57] blessings and unique unique trials and
[34:01] unique blessings amen
[34:03] but I want to modify the title a little
[34:05] bit here
[34:06] we go to make the title unique blessing
[34:10] and shrouded in unique trials and
[34:13] affliction unique blessings and shrouded
[34:17] in unique trials and affliction the
[34:20] Aster in afflictions the acident
[34:22] blessings that a lot give it to us but
[34:26] before the blessings come to us the
[34:28] blessings are heralded by trials and
[34:31] affliction and we're gonna see a lot of
[34:33] examples in the Bible in our own lives
[34:35] amen because you are the scripture made
[34:38] flesh today we can talk about Abraham
[34:41] Adam Jesus of Nazareth 2,000 years ago
[34:44] but if it's not reflected in my life and
[34:46] in your life then it's just a bunch of
[34:48] history amen but we don't serve God of
[34:51] history Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus right
[34:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[34:57] more amen what he did for our fathers
[35:00] and our mothers hundreds of years ago or
[35:03] thousands of years ago he's really same
[35:06] thing in our lives and we are blessed
[35:09] with scriptures and examples which is
[35:11] recorded for us that when we are going
[35:13] through those afflictions and trials we
[35:15] know that is just a hair out of a
[35:18] blessings on their way glory hallelujah
[35:20] so that will help us to take courage
[35:22] there regardless of what we see around
[35:25] there's a father in us who loves you
[35:28] amen
[35:29] which bringing something out of your
[35:30] life and all those that are the
[35:33] affliction that we are going through
[35:34] it's a blessing son daddy's guys glory
[35:37] hallelujah
[35:38] Konev arose as brother Jack always said
[35:40] there's a blessing of coronavirus which
[35:42] we see in our lives
[35:43] amen when Cana started the government
[35:46] had a plan that you know what the
[35:48] economies are shut down
[35:49] millions of people are losing their job
[35:51] so before we are given a financial bonus
[35:54] is free money I had 1200 I don't know
[35:57] what you had
[35:58] I was I was doing exam so I did even had
[36:01] a time to apply for it my friend hood we
[36:03] die hey quick we got you I mean make
[36:06] sure you get make sure you put your put
[36:08] things in order you know get set it up
[36:10] so that you can get your money and I was
[36:12] so busy doing exam so one day I went to
[36:13] my account and I saw 1200 deposit and I
[36:16] said where's this coming from
[36:17] I always make sure that I'm not spending
[36:19] some money that's not meant for me
[36:21] because banks can make mistakes so that
[36:24] I remember oh okay this could be day
[36:26] because last year I did my tax and if
[36:28] you use the same account they will send
[36:30] it to us a glory hallelujah to the Lord
[36:32] then after a copy wish I saw a letter
[36:35] from do not Trump
[36:36] they've given some money and they want
[36:38] to make sure you receive it I said the
[36:39] money's already gone it's melted into
[36:43] thin air so that is a blessing a made
[36:48] even in the midst of calamities we
[36:51] acknowledge that life have been lost
[36:53] people have lost jobs properties
[36:55] government cannot balance the economy's
[36:58] the whole world is shut down people have
[37:00] to stay home we couldn't come for
[37:01] service and different things but God in
[37:04] the mess of it has blessings for us amen
[37:07] glory hallelujah
[37:08] and I want us to look at a phenomenon
[37:11] that happened during a pandemic April
[37:14] 7th and 8th to 2020
[37:17] April just before Easter I think that
[37:19] was April 12 but on April 7th and 8th
[37:22] there was a supernatural phenomena or
[37:25] heavenly before God does something on
[37:27] earth God does it in a celestial
[37:29] dimension would you call heaven
[37:31] or six damnation or the six REM and God
[37:36] reveal it into the sky the atmosphere
[37:38] because in the olden days before before
[37:42] this we started reading Bible on purpose
[37:44] God had another Bible in the atmosphere
[37:48] which is the zodiac so God Bible is the
[37:50] one that man cannot other treats as for
[37:53] the Bible we have got so many people
[37:55] Bible King James Version name it New
[37:58] International Version what have you good
[38:01] news Bible and now which one message
[38:05] Bible and we've got so many Bibles you
[38:07] know so many probably thousands of them
[38:09] but there's something God did that man
[38:11] cannot alter that is the face Bible
[38:13] which is the zodiac which is gos own
[38:16] imprint it and that is what gasps oh God
[38:19] should a phenomenon called a super moon
[38:21] super moon is when the moon comes
[38:24] closest to the earth they call it also
[38:27] pink moon
[38:28] it doesn't describing pink but pink is
[38:31] the color of feminine amen is God doing
[38:35] something with his wife with his
[38:37] feminine feminine portion partner so on
[38:40] the seventh and the eighth moon
[38:42] there was the moon even the size of the
[38:44] moon was larger than its Israeli is the
[38:47] size was around true two hundred and
[38:50] twenty one thousand two hundred and
[38:52] twenty one seventeen seventy two
[38:54] thousand miles bigger than the normal
[38:56] size so the Saturday moon was larger and
[38:59] it was closer to the earth and then this
[39:02] phenomena took place on the seventh and
[39:04] the eighth of the amount April 7 is
[39:08] Animorph completion eight is a number of
[39:11] new beginning or the number of eternity
[39:13] God began a new cycle in life and
[39:16] apparently God is doing something new on
[39:18] this earth amen in my lifetime I've
[39:21] never seen a deal where the whole world
[39:23] is shut down
[39:23] everybody's stay home it's only this
[39:27] time amen
[39:29] and God is doing something upon the
[39:30] earth though people might not see
[39:33] everything do God a lot my nursery
[39:35] written all at once but is doing
[39:37] something upon the earth amen so he
[39:39] allowed this super moon phenomenon to
[39:42] occur on earth for us to know
[39:45] that the moon represent what the wife of
[39:46] christ the son is is that is their
[39:49] husband their stars represent gasps
[39:52] children every son and daughter of God
[39:54] was born under a sign under a certain a
[39:56] certain figure under a certain sign and
[39:59] a certain phenomenon a certain part and
[40:02] crocin of their son and under it god
[40:06] odin you that is where you have certain
[40:07] blessings in your life amen
[40:09] yes and a sign that you are born that
[40:12] when you know that son when God reveals
[40:14] it to you I'm not talking about
[40:16] astrological science I'm talking about
[40:19] God's own sign that my son was born and
[40:21] at his sign and when you stand at a sign
[40:24] nothing can defeat you amen
[40:27] when you'd see another sign of God which
[40:30] is the Holy Ghost sign there's nothing I
[40:32] can do future life amen
[40:34] like a Samson you know he was 100 assign
[40:38] his Cavanaugh was an asura covenant no
[40:41] research you touch his hair and as long
[40:44] as he was greener under the sign it
[40:46] doesn't matter and lion could not PA he
[40:49] can't Jess the Holy Ghost who just
[40:50] anoint him and who just grabbed a lion
[40:52] and Ted a lion into pieces and the same
[40:55] thing God has put you under a sign what
[40:58] is the spine the Lord Jesus Christ in
[41:00] you amen that is a greater sign God give
[41:03] it to you is that I'll be with you even
[41:05] in you on to the end of the world so on
[41:09] till you leave this world God who knows
[41:11] his being in you and being with you
[41:13] amen afflictions and trials who come
[41:15] tribulations who come but the law
[41:18] doesn't mean the Lord is not with you it
[41:20] means he's with you and it's been new
[41:22] things in your life
[41:23] he's breaking news psychos in your life
[41:25] is bringing new blessings in your life
[41:27] so he allowed looser affliction to open
[41:30] the door for those blessings in your
[41:31] life glory hallelujah to the Lord
[41:33] blessed be the name of the Lord amen so
[41:37] let's read a take our first example on
[41:40] the story of Joseph Joseph had a unique
[41:45] affliction he was born he had in his
[41:52] family Farah is just a Jacob as we know
[41:54] his mana was richer now he was
[41:58] the mother was barren so the mom went
[42:01] through affliction before he was born
[42:02] when his brother Benjamin was being born
[42:05] the mom passed away so he called him Ben
[42:08] Oni means bitterness offering pain
[42:10] disaster whatever but in his phallus
[42:12] which is named to Benjamin a blessing
[42:14] amen the monopoly was a prophetess the
[42:17] father was a prophet amen so the two of
[42:20] them were special to Jacob because their
[42:22] mom has gone to be with the Lord but
[42:25] then before I go unless read story fest
[42:27] maybe some of us are not acquainted with
[42:29] a story so let's go to Genesis chapter
[42:32] 39 and look at especially affliction the
[42:35] Lord allow in the life of Joseph to
[42:38] bring him to where he was he was
[42:39] supposed to be he was meant to go amen
[42:43] Genesis chapter 39 we're gonna read from
[42:45] the first verse probably about 20 verses
[42:49] Genesis 39 we must be skip some of them
[42:56] Genesis 13 I want to 1 to 20 and Joseph
[43:02] was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar
[43:05] an officer of Pharaoh captain of the
[43:08] guard and Egyptian bought bought him of
[43:10] the hands of the Ishmaelite which had
[43:12] brought him down
[43:13] thither and the Lord was with Joseph and
[43:16] he was a prosperous man and it was in
[43:18] the house of his master and the Egyptian
[43:20] and his master saw that the Lord was
[43:23] with him and that the Lord made all that
[43:25] he do all that he did to prosper in his
[43:27] hand and Joseph found grace in his sight
[43:30] and he served him and he made him an
[43:32] overseer over his house and all that he
[43:35] had he put it into his hand it came to
[43:38] pass from that time that he had made him
[43:40] overseer in his house and over all that
[43:43] he had that a Lord blessed the Egyptians
[43:45] house for Joseph's seek for your sake
[43:48] the Lord will bless somebody amen if you
[43:51] walk with the Lord for you see God will
[43:53] bless your children your family and your
[43:55] loved ones glory hallelujah
[43:57] so the Lord bless Potiphar for Joseph's
[43:59] sake and a blessing of the Lord was upon
[44:02] all that he had in the house and in the
[44:04] field verse 6 and he left all that he
[44:07] had in Joseph's hand and he knew not
[44:09] what he had safe
[44:12] the bread which he did eat and Joseph
[44:14] was a goodly person and wealth even so
[44:17] the bread was with what was the wife of
[44:19] Potiphar amen
[44:21] that was a Bible team Bible has got
[44:23] coots blessed be the name of the Lord so
[44:26] if you think about a man who trusts you
[44:28] and give you his business take care of
[44:30] his company his work has his servants
[44:33] what is bread what is a loaf of bread
[44:35] wheat and corn it's not that the bread
[44:38] is standing for his wife amen the wife
[44:41] is only ten does nobody his somebody
[44:42] cannot give it to you no that is just
[44:44] for the man alone and the man is for the
[44:47] wife alone amen
[44:48] so let's go on and see and it came to
[44:52] pass after this since that his master's
[44:54] wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she
[44:57] said lie with me and he refused and said
[45:00] unto his master's wife behold my master
[45:02] what not what is with me in the house he
[45:07] had committed all that he had to my hand
[45:09] there is none greater than in this house
[45:12] than I neither had he kept back anything
[45:15] from me but thee because thou art his
[45:18] wife how then can I do this great
[45:20] wickedness and sin against God and it
[45:23] came to pass as she speak she speak to
[45:25] Joseph D by D that he had came not unto
[45:28] her to lie by her or to be with her amen
[45:32] God has put something in you to become
[45:34] every trial the Holy Ghost amen
[45:37] and it came to pass about this time that
[45:39] Joseph went into the house to do his
[45:41] business and there was none of the men
[45:44] of the house there within and she caught
[45:47] him by his garment saying lie with me
[45:49] and he left his garment in her hand and
[45:52] fled and got him out and he came to pass
[45:55] when she saw that he had he had left his
[45:58] garment in a hand and was fled forth
[46:00] that she caught on to the men of the
[46:02] house of a house and spoken to them
[46:04] saying see he had brought in an Hebrew
[46:07] on Twista Maka's he came in on to me to
[46:10] lie with me and I cried with a loud
[46:12] voice and he came to pass when he had
[46:14] that I lifted up my voice and cried that
[46:17] he had left his garment with me and fled
[46:19] and got him out she laid and she laid
[46:22] upon his garment by her until his Lord
[46:25] came in
[46:25] and she's pick on to his on to him
[46:27] according to there were saying in the
[46:29] Hebrew servant which has brought on 2's
[46:31] came in on to me to mock me and it came
[46:34] to pass I lift up my voice or kill em
[46:36] skip to verse 20 and Joseph's master
[46:38] took him and put him into prison a place
[46:41] where the Kings prisoner were bound and
[46:43] he was there in prison amen if when you
[46:46] go home you can read the whole chapter
[46:47] now Joseph let me go back a little bit
[46:50] and give the buttress the story Joseph
[46:53] was we know the story he had a gift of
[46:55] God in his life he was spiritual amen
[46:58] he believed in a prophet is what I was a
[47:01] prophet so his father preached to him
[47:03] God ordained a gift of prophet in his
[47:05] life and used to see visions and dream
[47:07] dreams so he told his father and his
[47:10] brethren that is so a dream that the
[47:12] whole heaven and earth was bowing to him
[47:13] before and he's got another Premal ready
[47:16] that plants and different things were
[47:17] bowing to him and is what I say you you
[47:20] are the last but one are we going to bow
[47:23] to you no way it's not going to happen
[47:24] so now this begin to develop hatred for
[47:28] Joseph and then he had another dream
[47:30] that heavens and earth were bowing to
[47:31] him which is father even rebuked him
[47:34] said what do you mean me and your mama
[47:37] are good about to you what what kind of
[47:39] dream is this but it's what I've been a
[47:41] spiritual person kapnos dream and watch
[47:43] his son because he saw there's something
[47:45] special about his son so he made him a
[47:47] coat of many colors seven colours which
[47:49] is a table of the seven Church ages amen
[47:52] and now Joseph went about his business
[47:54] one day his father sent him that your
[47:56] brothers are keeping the Sheep so take
[47:59] this food and corn and differences and
[48:02] go give to them so he went and a brother
[48:04] said lo here comes a dreamer
[48:06] this is the time to do something about
[48:07] it this guy has been dreaming in telling
[48:10] us are we gonna bow to him why don't you
[48:12] just get rid of him you know kill him so
[48:16] his oldest brother Reuben made a plan
[48:18] that you know what he's my brother and
[48:20] sort of killing him lest he came with a
[48:22] plan that lets put him in a pit and his
[48:25] plan was like taking from the pit and
[48:27] taking back to the Father but the Lord
[48:29] had a purpose for everything I hop into
[48:31] your life whatever happens to you
[48:34] whatever trials
[48:36] the Lord has a purpose for it
[48:39] so before he could go and rescue his
[48:41] brother the sodium already to the
[48:43] Midianites he's gone and there was
[48:46] nothing he could do so they took him and
[48:49] that ended up in Potiphar's house a lot
[48:52] of the Egyptians and because he was a
[48:54] godly person even in the West time the
[48:58] Lord opens favors for him amen so behold
[49:01] lo and behold he was favored by Potiphar
[49:03] he put in charge of his business he saw
[49:05] that as God would with this men whatever
[49:07] he does his being blessed wherever his
[49:09] step is being blessed remember he was
[49:13] sold amen
[49:14] you might have been sold you might lose
[49:17] your job you might lose your family
[49:19] but the blessings of the Lord is with
[49:21] you amen and is all it will go into a
[49:23] psych cycle to bring you a blessing amen
[49:27] so Joseph is a began to prosper was
[49:32] elevated in charge of company Potiphar's
[49:34] business everything the only thing is
[49:37] his wife nobody give his wife - you know
[49:40] it's one-to-one ratio amen
[49:43] so his wife I don't know he was probably
[49:46] a young man and I don't know that I
[49:48] begin to I Jusuf the devil is always
[49:51] looking for something because there's
[49:52] something about you so the devil will
[49:54] always look for something to tempt you
[49:56] to bring reproach to bring trials to
[49:59] bring affliction but a lot would turn it
[50:01] around to be a blessing to you if you
[50:04] stay with the Lord amen so regardless of
[50:07] the trials Joseph could have given into
[50:09] that today - the lady but his first wife
[50:11] but instead oh how can I do such
[50:13] wickedness against God and against my
[50:15] master who is put everything in my KB's
[50:18] I do Joseph was innocent he kept in his
[50:21] business one day he went to his business
[50:23] and it got to the peak of the trial so
[50:27] this lady literally grabbed Yousef that
[50:29] there's nobody around here you are young
[50:31] and some man why don't you have a day
[50:33] have a nice day but he said no I cannot
[50:36] do this it even I give away the ages to
[50:39] trees flight took on his heels run for
[50:42] his life
[50:42] but in the olden days in the east in
[50:45] civilization they don't dress like the
[50:48] way we dress you way or your pantalone
[50:50] of pants and or you wear your
[50:52] skirts and
[50:52] blouson and shits know they have outer
[50:55] garment and inner garment
[50:57] just like maybe could they have the
[50:59] outer coat so they have a long group in
[51:01] a garment and a long group like maybe a
[51:04] mourning gown or something like that
[51:05] that we did dress so the lady grabbed he
[51:09] was running in the course of it because
[51:10] he grabbed him he left his outer garment
[51:13] and he ran for his life and now imagine
[51:17] in this day if I let it go to the police
[51:19] station that you rip hey he's got your
[51:21] garment who is going to be the witness
[51:24] what are you going to say to defend
[51:26] yourself
[51:27] there's no way about it but the almighty
[51:29] seat amen so he was locked in prison and
[51:33] all his dream was shattered again all
[51:35] his ambition and dreams and visions was
[51:38] gone and already that was morning his
[51:41] little brother Benjamin was mourning
[51:43] that I'm not going to see my son anymore
[51:45] and remember Joseph's life God had a
[51:48] covenant remember in the time of Adam he
[51:51] had a conditional covenant if you do
[51:53] this I'll do this if you tie the tree of
[51:55] knowledge of good and evil
[51:56] the data you touch it you're gonna die
[51:58] so there was condition attached to it
[52:00] but study from Abraham he began a
[52:03] condition of unconditional a covenant of
[52:05] unconditional love amen Abram was the
[52:09] father of faith God was showing feet his
[52:12] feet attribute of it through Abraham his
[52:14] son Isaac was an attribute of love he
[52:17] was a type of Christ he was a beloved
[52:20] son now Jacob was Greece amen
[52:23] so the Lord Greece was it his name Jacob
[52:25] means this meant deceiver but the grace
[52:28] of God was with him all the time and a
[52:31] lot has insurers profit everything the
[52:33] law shoe is providing his 7 things he
[52:35] want them to know and he wanted people
[52:36] to know so the Lord he showed you a
[52:39] Jacob that is son was still alive so
[52:41] Jacob was morning when they should be
[52:43] brought back the garment that they could
[52:46] have many colors and you know that he
[52:48] wasn't going to see son again but I was
[52:50] a Greece of God because God dealt with
[52:52] Joseph dealt with Jacob in a manner of
[52:55] Greece amen so Jacob certain times go to
[52:58] give you a blessing and that blessing is
[53:00] a transition a blessing Jacob sorry
[53:04] Joseph was an apostle Potiphar
[53:06] but I wasn't where the final destination
[53:08] God ordained for him the final
[53:09] destination was to be a prime minister
[53:11] of Egypt so God would give you a
[53:14] blessing let's say a job a business a
[53:16] position something and allowed himself
[53:19] will let something happen and scattered
[53:21] a blessing just like in the case of
[53:23] Joseph he was blessed at least he was
[53:27] consumed that if my vision doesn't come
[53:29] true I'm here got a company to be the
[53:31] CEO of the company or I'm the deputy CEO
[53:34] or I am the eius or whatever title they
[53:37] would give it to him he was assistant to
[53:39] Potiphar he was actually in charge he
[53:42] was running or the shoe but then the
[53:44] Lord allowed trial to destroy this
[53:47] blessing why because that was a
[53:52] transition a blessing
[53:53] it wasn't the ultimate blessing the
[53:57] ultimate blessing is not to be in the
[53:58] house of Potiphar God has got something
[54:01] higher for him glory hallelujah amen and
[54:05] in our lives you might live for I need a
[54:09] thousand dollars that is your plan e on
[54:11] this side but the Lord you from
[54:14] getting to plan a you may fight all your
[54:17] way out plan is blog you have done you

[54:29] of the salary I would take that to take

[54:33] you're doing everything they said no
[54:37] you're out we don't you want to net
[54:39] premises if you come to a premise call

[54:47] all my life to you I said with all my
[54:49] heart what did I do wrong why is this
[54:52] come upon me but so God has an answer
[54:55] plan is blocked but there's a little
[54:58] door opening Plan B and finally after
[55:01] fighting your way in plan a plan is
[55:03] blocked so you have no choice but to
[55:05] turn to plan B now when you tend to plan
[55:08] B begins to open wider for you
[55:09] it begins to open wider and open wider
[55:12] now the Lord loves you he knows that you
[55:15] want thousand dollars but a thousand
[55:18] dollars plus for you
[55:19] so when we moved to plan B here's your
[55:22] thousand dollars plus 1 million dollars
[55:25] you didn't ask for amen
[55:28] you lose your job whether you pay you
[55:30] pay to paycheck to paycheck now God give
[55:33] you a business gotta be a blessing that
[55:36] ran into millions of dollars which is
[55:39] not your strength but God ordained
[55:42] ordination now when you step into Plan B
[55:44] he's got a blessing right for you you
[55:47] are not going to struggle he allow you
[55:49] to struggle here
[55:50] I said transition to train you so that
[55:53] you can manage Plan B glory hallelujah
[55:56] to the Lord amen so in life certain
[55:59] things might not work for you you might
[56:01] blame yourself by God according or tinit
[56:03] its plan which is way higher than what
[56:06] you are thinking about glory hallelujah
[56:08] for you you might go to churches you

[59:34] store food for the first seven years to
[59:37] be kept for the last seven years where
[59:39] there's gonna be famine on the land dry
[59:41] no rain and no water and it's always the
[59:43] best person to be in Chad and you Joseph
[59:45] so right away
[59:47] what God has for Joseph before the
[59:49] foundation of the world the dream that
[59:51] he had which was being hit at for the
[59:53] dream you could say this day this
[59:55] scripture is for food in my life you can
[59:58] say this day this vision is manifesting
[1:00:01] in my life you can say this day this
[1:00:04] word of God for me personally for my
[1:00:06] family for my children for my husband
[1:00:09] for my wife from appearance for my uncle
[1:00:11] for my area for my church whatever this
[1:00:15] day this blessing is manifested in my
[1:00:17] own life amen
[1:00:18] and Joseph was a prime minister he was
[1:00:22] over warm Wow from being super my
[1:00:24] brethren my mom died and my brother
[1:00:27] showed me I was falsely accused by a
[1:00:30] professor's wife put in jail in prison
[1:00:32] for being innocent and here I'm a prime
[1:00:35] minister nobody could see Pharaoh would
[1:00:38] have seen Jesus sorry could have seen
[1:00:40] Joseph and nobody could see Jesus
[1:00:43] without seeing you because you are
[1:00:45] Joseph of more of the modern day amen
[1:00:48] your name physical may not be Joseph but
[1:00:51] aspect of Joseph is upon you amen
[1:00:54] if you know who you are people cannot
[1:00:57] see Jesus without seeing you
[1:00:59] amen your neighbors when they want to
[1:01:01] see Jesus they will go to you but I
[1:01:02] brother brother Troy
[1:01:03] mr. Troy there's something about you I
[1:01:05] have this problem I know you pre can you
[1:01:09] pray for me you haven't even told him
[1:01:11] you a Christian you have not Tony but he
[1:01:13] could see the Lord let him know that
[1:01:15] there's a man in the area there's a man
[1:01:18] on the job there's a man in the company
[1:01:20] whom I can listen to many priests amen
[1:01:24] and that's why we have to open your eyes
[1:01:26] wider God will make you a testimony unto
[1:01:28] others God will use your testimony does
[1:01:32] we use your humility your laugh your
[1:01:34] obedience to bring souls unto Him amen
[1:01:37] glory because the whole world is hungry
[1:01:39] and thirst for God you are the one who
[1:01:43] is closer to the Lord amen
[1:01:45] so Joseph the Lord use that transition a
[1:01:47] blessing to bring yourself in let's go
[1:01:49] to another story let's go to Hanna
[1:01:52] First Samuel First Samuel chapter 1
[1:01:57] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:02:01] trials or blessings wrapped in
[1:02:04] affliction as humans even Jesus when he
[1:02:08] was on the flesh our human flesh is not
[1:02:11] made to enjoy afflictions the human
[1:02:15] nature the human spirit is not made to
[1:02:18] rejoice in affliction but a Bible said I
[1:02:22] rejoice even in your affliction
[1:02:24] that's why Jesus on before the cross he
[1:02:27] cried to the Holy Ghost in him the
[1:02:30] father is in him the father was in him
[1:02:32] is that father if it's possible let this
[1:02:35] cup let his suffering this affliction
[1:02:37] because you saw a vision of the devil
[1:02:40] been anoint anointed and anointing
[1:02:42] people to come and kill him his
[1:02:45] suffering was huge you could see them in
[1:02:46] vision you could see a a was the name
[1:02:48] you could see a he already Lazarus has
[1:02:50] been Oh Lazarus and Judas has betrayed
[1:02:54] him already and you could see everything
[1:02:57] being played before him and I've been a
[1:02:59] human being
[1:03:00] remember Jesus Christ was a hundred
[1:03:02] percent human being he was a hundred
[1:03:04] percent God and hundred percent human
[1:03:06] being blessing in affliction blessing
[1:03:11] and shrouded in a frisson Sevilla in the
[1:03:13] body of a human being amen so he said
[1:03:16] God Father if it's possible let this cup
[1:03:18] pass over me
[1:03:19] but then the voice said on to this
[1:03:21] course was I born he was born to take
[1:03:24] care of your sins and my sin so we
[1:03:26] cannot let back up that's off renew pass
[1:03:28] him by the same thing that some part of
[1:03:30] the sovereign has has been left for you
[1:03:32] and I that was suffering through those
[1:03:35] afflictions and trials the lot of
[1:03:37] bringing others onto you
[1:03:39] what does the sovereign do it as bring
[1:03:41] the attribute of grace of laughs of
[1:03:45] righteousness of the holiness of God of
[1:03:47] date amen you were born with a date in
[1:03:50] you we are born with a quality of Christ
[1:03:53] in you you are part of omnipotent God
[1:03:56] you are omnipresent amen
[1:03:58] if God is in you but I will not try us
[1:04:01] an affliction those glory will not be
[1:04:03] manifested so the Lord has allowed those
[1:04:05] trials to form your character like
[1:04:09] Joseph when he had this vision God
[1:04:11] didn't give him that it wasn't the first
[1:04:13] time he saw the vision that's when
[1:04:14] became a premise of of Egypt it took
[1:04:17] years it was some time for the vision to
[1:04:21] be manifested so your visions are not
[1:04:23] defeated no your dream is not defeated
[1:04:26] but a lot is forming the character to
[1:04:29] help you reign when he put you at a
[1:04:31] level amen
[1:04:33] because Carter without power without
[1:04:35] critize what satanic we see them all
[1:04:39] around in politics in religion in
[1:04:41] families people are in positions they
[1:04:43] abuse their power because they don't
[1:04:45] have the cut off Christ to go with it so
[1:04:47] Jesus himself came on earth to learn
[1:04:49] affliction to learn experience through
[1:04:51] their suffering he was able toward
[1:04:53] intercede for you and I when we pray he
[1:04:56] hears your prayer when you're going
[1:04:58] through afflictions because he has been
[1:05:00] through before
[1:05:00] amen glory hallelujah so let's read the
[1:05:03] story of Hannah from Fez Samuel glory
[1:05:11] hallelujah
[1:05:12] let's read samuel chapter 1 verse 5
[1:05:18] glory hallelujah let's read from verse 5
[1:05:21] up to maybe 10 or 14 rather think that
[1:05:29] would you glory hallelujah
[1:05:30] First Samuel chapter 1 verse 5 to 14 but
[1:05:37] on to Hannah you know Hannah was a woman
[1:05:39] who had no children he had prayed all
[1:05:42] these years but let's go on but on to
[1:05:45] Hannah he gave away that was a husband
[1:05:46] on - Hannah he gave a worthy portion for
[1:05:52] he loved her for he loved Hannah but the
[1:05:55] Lord had shut up her womb I want you to
[1:05:57] notice this it wasn't a devil - at the
[1:05:59] womb the Lord has shut up a wound the
[1:06:04] Lord blocks plan E amen it wasn't
[1:06:10] somebody oh I would have been in this
[1:06:12] position I did this person he's that
[1:06:14] which is that witchcraft is there
[1:06:16] he's my obstacle is my enemy he blocked
[1:06:19] me from going to this place but the Lord
[1:06:22] shut the womb of Hannah amen so my
[1:06:27] presence I don't have an enemy No
[1:06:28] nobody's my enemy not even the one who
[1:06:30] cut my throat but rom said if I should
[1:06:33] have an enemy the Wesen means me myself
[1:06:34] cuckoo so don't look at anybody ask your
[1:06:37] enemy don't have any me if somebody has
[1:06:40] done something against you just let it
[1:06:41] go
[1:06:42] if you had I didn't take of you to this
[1:06:44] far as this send him a message
[1:06:46] forgive him Amen if your mother did for
[1:06:50] Sookie forgive her Amen if somebody did
[1:06:53] you evil regardless of the Evo don't
[1:06:56] look it up as and look at Jesus Christ
[1:06:57] you just let me go amen the Lord made
[1:07:01] him to do it
[1:07:03] amen now with the scripture I want to
[1:07:06] finish with this one so the Lord shut
[1:07:08] hey whoomp not the devil for the Lord
[1:07:10] did it and so is it then and as he did
[1:07:15] sooo yeah but yet they go to a they go
[1:07:17] to shallow for sacrifice when she went
[1:07:19] to the house of the Lord
[1:07:20] sue she provoked hey that was a rabid
[1:07:22] ass man's wife her husband's a husband's
[1:07:26] wife right that is the other wife to
[1:07:28] Penina know oh I have to
[1:07:33] Elkanah she was always cousin Hannah
[1:07:36] because Hannah didn't have a child so
[1:07:39] there was always provocation insult
[1:07:42] abuse bhajana wasn't looking at arrival
[1:07:45] was looking up the Lord amen so she kept
[1:07:48] her focus on the Lord through what
[1:07:49] prayer prayer is the key to all the
[1:07:53] questions we have amen so a cana her
[1:07:58] husband said unto her on to Hannah why
[1:07:59] we pass down why it has down note and
[1:08:02] why is thine heart grieved
[1:08:04] am I not better to thee than ten sons so
[1:08:08] Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
[1:08:10] Shiloh and after they are drunk now
[1:08:12] elide a priest sat upon a seat by the
[1:08:15] puss of the temple of the Lord and she
[1:08:17] was in bitterness of Ceuta was Hannah
[1:08:19] she prayed unto the Lord and Webb saw
[1:08:21] verse 11 and she vowed a vow and said O
[1:08:24] Lord of Hosts if thou indeed look on my
[1:08:26] affliction of on the affliction of the

[1:08:59] past menopause there was no hope for him

[1:09:03] because his path is easy for us to think
[1:09:06] I okay it was easy Jesse desperate but

[1:09:53] forth but there was something there was
[1:09:56] a fist that hasn't been fulfilled
[1:09:58] the Lord has suffer for that fist so
[1:10:01] Hannah cried and prayed unto the Lord so
[1:10:04] the Lord we think about the remembrance

[1:12:35] she didn't ask for a priest she asked
[1:12:38] when I Vangelis I'm gonna give her one
[1:12:41] of my greatest prophet of all time
[1:12:43] somewhat a prophet go to Hanna
[1:12:48] and after sheep read the Bible said at

[1:13:08] atmosphere and a Bible says she went to

[1:13:33] she was rejoicing and praising the Lord
[1:13:35] and a lot give a what give a profit so
[1:13:39] now millions of people name their
[1:13:41] children after Samuel because of the
[1:13:44] character of Samuel so when God gives
[1:13:47] you enough permit enough affliction in
[1:13:48] your life don't worry about Satan don't
[1:13:51] worry about the devil don't worry about
[1:13:53] your boss your boss your destiny is not
[1:13:55] in the hand of your boss or your
[1:13:57] landlord is chasing you don't worry
[1:14:00] about those things
[1:14:01] don't worry about about your children
[1:14:04] God has everything any control Amen
[1:14:07] praise be to God glory be to the Lord
[1:14:13] let's look at a lot of scriptures to
[1:14:15] buttress this less good as a chapter 45
[1:14:19] let's read from Isaiah 45 glory to the
[1:14:26] Lord so that in our trials we will keep
[1:14:31] our focus on the Lord as I chapter 45
[1:14:34] verse 5 to 7 there 45 5 to 7 whatever
[1:14:44] happens in your life the Lord has a
[1:14:47] purpose for it verse 5 said I am the
[1:14:51] Lord and there is none else there is no
[1:14:53] God beside me I get at thee though thou
[1:14:56] hast not know me the Lord guides your
[1:14:58] footstep in trials though you may know
[1:15:00] understand
[1:15:01] six that day may know from the rising of
[1:15:03] the Sun and from the West that there is
[1:15:05] none beside me I am the Lord and there
[1:15:08] is none else verse seven I want you to
[1:15:10] take note I formed the light and create
[1:15:13] darkness I make peace and create evil
[1:15:17] I the LORD do all these things
[1:15:21] amen so who from the light the Lord who
[1:15:24] creates a vow the Lord the Lord does all
[1:15:28] of them for the glory of his name Amen
[1:15:30] because the whole purpose of us here on
[1:15:32] earth is to live for the priests and his
[1:15:35] glory so yeah you allow a big light in
[1:15:38] your path you rejoice in the light but
[1:15:41] then all of a sudden darkness comes in
[1:15:42] because the darkness is leading you to a
[1:15:44] bigger light to your ultimate blessing
[1:15:47] so the Lord used that darkness to cover
[1:15:49] that little light here your plan a so
[1:15:52] that you push you to Plan B where he's
[1:15:54] got ultimate blessings for you
[1:15:56] amen and what we need to do is be
[1:15:58] sensitive to the Lord when we are
[1:16:01] sensitive to the Lord you want to have
[1:16:03] his perfect wall amen
[1:16:05] don't close your mind to the Lord
[1:16:07] sometimes you pray you can prove a
[1:16:08] certain things four million times it
[1:16:10] doesn't mean a lot as I'm headed but
[1:16:12] it's going to do it in a way that you
[1:16:14] don't envisage in a way that you don't
[1:16:16] anticipate because his arms are written
[1:16:19] on your arms his blessings are more than
[1:16:21] what you are asking for what you're
[1:16:23] asking for is a peanut before the Lord
[1:16:25] but he want to give you the ultimate
[1:16:26] blessing amen
[1:16:28] that you don't have to struggle no more
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] the acident blessing that God gives you
[1:16:33] to you that is not a struggling anymore
[1:16:35] the Lord will permit a struggling times
[1:16:37] you go through struggles to train you to
[1:16:39] transform you to show you his grace and
[1:16:41] his love then finally he bliss you to
[1:16:44] position of leadership and blessing and
[1:16:46] authority and reign Andrew amen and
[1:16:49] every one of us here has got position in
[1:16:51] a lot all of us have got leadership amen
[1:16:54] you might not be the pasta but it
[1:16:56] doesn't mean you don't have a leadership
[1:16:57] in your home a sister amen in your job
[1:17:00] please you might not be the boss you
[1:17:02] might be the list in their ranks but as
[1:17:04] a leadership of Christ in you I'm not
[1:17:06] talking about manmade leadership you can
[1:17:09] be a see you if you don't have a
[1:17:10] character is of no use
[1:17:12] you can't their president if you don't
[1:17:14] have the character to go
[1:17:15] with it is of no use but you can be
[1:17:17] their mop the one who mops the janitor
[1:17:19] the one who moves the ground but if got
[1:17:22] a cut off Jesus Christ your influence is
[1:17:24] greater than the president amen
[1:17:26] so because he that is in you is greater
[1:17:28] than he that is in the world blessed be
[1:17:31] the name of the Lord glory hallelujah
[1:17:33] let's look at Samson I'll give you the
[1:17:35] scriptures to you because of time
[1:17:36] let's read em I'll give you a scripture
[1:17:39] JJ's 14 1 to 9 judges let's see if I can
[1:17:44] read Samson went - what happened -
[1:17:49] Samson on his wedding day let's see
[1:17:53] judges 14 1 to 9 see how the Lord does
[1:17:58] in his room as 8:28 says all things work
[1:18:01] together for good to them that love the
[1:18:03] Lord cause one time they lost plan and
[1:18:05] his thinking is way beyond our planner
[1:18:06] our thinking Samson was born in us right
[1:18:09] just like Samuel Amen and no reason she
[1:18:13] touch his head no she didn't drink
[1:18:15] alcohol you can't even go near dead
[1:18:17] bodies who's not a close person so they
[1:18:19] have all kind of a covenant they have to
[1:18:21] do with vows and so but then Samson was
[1:18:24] a Jewish he was a Hebrew and a ghost
[1:18:25] covenant he was circumcised so he was
[1:18:28] supposed to stay within the confines of
[1:18:30] his word of his covenant and the Bible
[1:18:33] says in judges chapter 14 verse 1 said
[1:18:35] Samson went down to Timnath and saw a
[1:18:37] woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
[1:18:39] Philistine and he came up and told his
[1:18:41] father and his mother and said I have
[1:18:43] seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters
[1:18:45] of the Philistine now therefore go get
[1:18:47] her for me - wife Wow then his father
[1:18:51] his mother said unto unto him is there
[1:18:53] never a woman among the daughters of the
[1:18:54] of thy brethren or among all the all my
[1:18:57] people that thou goest to take a wife of
[1:18:59] the uncircumcised philistine AMSAT and
[1:19:02] Samson said unto his father get her for
[1:19:05] me for she pleased me well verse 4 but
[1:19:08] his father and his mother knew not that
[1:19:10] it was of the Lord that he sought an
[1:19:12] occasion against the Philistines for at
[1:19:15] that time the Philistines had dominion
[1:19:16] over Israel so sometimes the Lord does
[1:19:18] something out of your range out of your
[1:19:21] thinking verse 5 then when Samson Dow
[1:19:24] and his father and his mother - Timnath
[1:19:26] and came to the vania Sultanate and
[1:19:27] behold
[1:19:28] young lion rode against him that was on
[1:19:31] Sam since the lip let's put the modern
[1:19:33] time imagine today's your wedding day
[1:19:35] you come in for better job to pass your
[1:19:37] wedding you can't wait to have your wife
[1:19:39] now you are underway before you got up
[1:19:41] and come out of your room alignment in
[1:19:44] front of your door put yourself in a
[1:19:47] situation what I'm going to say probably
[1:19:51] might give up on the Lord why me why a
[1:19:56] lie on the day of my wedding when I'm
[1:20:00] dressed up in my in my in my brighter
[1:20:02] garment there's a lion in front of my
[1:20:05] door there's a bulldog who want to but I
[1:20:09] mean bite me where's this coming from
[1:20:11] this must be a witchcraft this must be
[1:20:14] the devil himself this might be sittin
[1:20:17] tried to destroy my wedding day
[1:20:19] but the Lord was up to something amen
[1:20:22] glory hallelujah the Bible said that the
[1:20:25] Lord came upon Samson glory hallelujah
[1:20:28] to the Lord let's see what did I get you
[1:20:32] verse 5 thank you verse 6 and the Lord
[1:20:36] came mightily upon upon him and he rent
[1:20:38] him as he rent have rent a kid and he
[1:20:41] had nothin in his hand but he told not
[1:20:43] his father and his or his mother what he
[1:20:45] had done
[1:20:46] verse 7 and he went down and talked with
[1:20:47] a woman and she pleased Sampson well
[1:20:49] then verse 8 and after a time he
[1:20:52] retained to take MC no let go to verse 7
[1:20:56] give me one second I want to occupy seat
[1:20:59] and after a time he returned to take her
[1:21:01] and he turned outside to see the carcass
[1:21:03] of the lion and behold there was a swarm
[1:21:05] of bees and honey in the carcass of the
[1:21:08] lion and he took them off in his hand
[1:21:10] and went on eating and came to his
[1:21:12] father and his mother and he gave them
[1:21:13] and they did it but he told them not
[1:21:16] that he had taken the honey out of the
[1:21:17] carcass of a lion God bring in
[1:21:20] affliction bringing blessings out of
[1:21:22] affliction the Lord brought blessing the
[1:21:25] trial data like Samson met meeting a
[1:21:28] lion he overcame the lion but a lot
[1:21:31] brought blessing of honey out of out of
[1:21:34] the lie on the carcass of the lion
[1:21:36] sometime your trials
[1:21:37] your affliction is a hair out of a
[1:21:42] lesson on their way and you did if you
[1:21:45] embrace those trials with a heart of
[1:21:48] Christ it will bring the manifestation
[1:21:51] of Christ if you run away from those
[1:21:53] challenges your blessing is going to be
[1:21:55] hindered amen
[1:21:57] Christians that hope like grasshoppers
[1:22:00] right when there's affliction here they
[1:22:03] jump here when oh there's something
[1:22:05] literally they jump here they always
[1:22:07] want the easy side when there's a lot of
[1:22:09] problem in the church oh no I'm going
[1:22:10] I'm going to leave when there's a little
[1:22:12] bit at home I'm leaving home I'm jumping
[1:22:14] here you are living the affliction you
[1:22:16] always jump in here you are not said to
[1:22:18] jump in here and jump in here and you
[1:22:21] never get bless but the one that will be
[1:22:24] stopped be still and know that I'm your
[1:22:25] Lord he's the one that is getting
[1:22:27] blessed amen there were fishes that call
[1:22:31] on the Lord fish in the river and big
[1:22:34] fishes are always trying to eat them up
[1:22:35] so those three fishes prayed on to the
[1:22:37] Lord one of them pray Lord give me give
[1:22:40] me the opportunity to be able to jump
[1:22:41] out of the water when the big fishes are
[1:22:43] coming the Lord give him his desire so
[1:22:46] when a big fishes are coming he pop up
[1:22:48] the water but of course fish cannot
[1:22:50] breathe in water they have to use their
[1:22:52] is what girls to take oxygen so when it
[1:22:55] comes out of the water there's no oxygen
[1:22:57] for that for the fish and it goes back
[1:22:59] to the water the big fishes are they so
[1:23:01] life was like jumping in the water
[1:23:03] coming out jumping in coming out no rest
[1:23:06] for this fish glory hallelujah
[1:23:09] the other fish pray that Lord give me
[1:23:11] eyes all over my body so I can see my
[1:23:13] enemies when a big fishes are coming I
[1:23:15] can just wear them move to another area
[1:23:17] so when a shark is coming he's running
[1:23:20] another bottom when you get to the
[1:23:22] bottom they say will he come to the top
[1:23:24] and it just running all around no peace
[1:23:28] the third free said or give me grace
[1:23:30] just protect me from this enemies praise
[1:23:32] be to God I don't qualify I don't have
[1:23:35] the strength to face this fish but just
[1:23:38] give me Greece and Allah gave him Greece
[1:23:40] he swim in the mouth of the will
[1:23:44] sometimes it's the the pieces of food in
[1:23:47] the mouth of the Wills and their shacks
[1:23:49] you don't eat it up it just remind them
[1:23:52] sit on top they will the grace of God
[1:23:55] was with him
[1:23:56] he passed two different afflictions the
[1:23:58] grace of God was there with him he was
[1:24:00] around with the big fishes they just
[1:24:02] look at him as a friend
[1:24:04] they don't eat him up sometime he sleep
[1:24:06] in their mouth
[1:24:07] the our mouth is open when they are
[1:24:08] taking a nap he sleep in their mouth and
[1:24:11] eat food the grace of God was with him
[1:24:13] and Greece is what we need amen
[1:24:17] when the grace of God is with you in the
[1:24:20] mess of the trouble you know I visit
[1:24:22] that trouble you wait and went through
[1:24:24] the trouble go your way and come back
[1:24:26] the Lord will protect you
[1:24:28] amen God's grace is way beyond way
[1:24:33] beyond because his grace is backed by
[1:24:36] his love amen
[1:24:38] when you seek Lord as for His grace amen
[1:24:42] that's why you should also be ready to
[1:24:43] give grease onto others the Bible's our
[1:24:46] forgive those who offend you so that
[1:24:48] your Father in Heaven can also forgive
[1:24:49] your trespasses
[1:24:50] so give grease onto others and the same
[1:24:53] grace in multiple form will come to you
[1:24:54] amen glory hallelujah to the Lord
[1:24:57] blessed be the name of the lord glory
[1:25:00] hallelujah let's look at Romans 8:14
[1:25:03] 18 we can read that later
[1:25:06] is that a trial so Paul was talking
[1:25:08] about the affection that we go through
[1:25:12] what's the time
[1:25:14] he's almost what the time can somebody
[1:25:18] tell me that I want to thank you so much
[1:25:20] god bless you so the a fish that we go
[1:25:22] through on this earth cannot be compared
[1:25:25] to the blessing that a lot has lead for
[1:25:28] us and affliction that you go through
[1:25:30] right now cannot be compared that glory
[1:25:32] that is being revealed in you right now
[1:25:34] not only at the other side but even now
[1:25:36] the Lord is blessing you he'll bless you
[1:25:40] and continue bless you amen
[1:25:42] so there's something in you that is why
[1:25:44] you are going through the affliction
[1:25:45] that we are going through look at Lisa
[1:25:47] card as Josh water prophet
[1:25:50] Joshua a warrior Jasha was fighting the
[1:25:53] lost battle and it gets night it gets

[1:30:28] that before a Goliath he didn't use his
[1:30:31] experience he also uses experience to
[1:30:34] convince so now we were to fight Goliath
[1:30:37] by one on the battlefront he transferred
[1:30:40] about her to his date even Goliath who
[1:30:43] is a giant giant ik when he came before

[1:40:09] closing in Paul was in prison he was

[1:40:15] movement was restricted but his feet
[1:40:17] wasn't restricted he took painting and
[1:40:20] parchment and wrote letters and that
[1:40:23] letters became New Testament bases of
[1:40:26] the New Testament I reread so even in
[1:40:28] the your lowest ebb God can still use
[1:40:31] you when we are broken down to pieces
[1:40:33] that there's nothing good about you do
[1:40:35] everything good about you welcome to the
[1:40:37] broken pieces together and magnify his
[1:40:40] name glory hallelujah to the Lord the
[1:40:42] Lord Jesus Christ he had all the
[1:40:45] attributes in him he came on earth we
[1:40:49] know he was an atom or a prophet and
[1:40:51] women of God he came on earth to take
[1:40:53] off your sin and my son but I wanted to
[1:40:56] do a little than he has ever done so he
[1:41:00] made a statement that the son of man has
[1:41:01] no place to lay his head fowls of heaven
[1:41:05] have got nest
[1:41:06] what foxes have got hooves but a son of
[1:41:09] man he wasn't talking about physical
[1:41:11] place he slept in Peter's house he slept
[1:41:13] in Mary and Martha and you it wasn't him
[1:41:16] Lazarus house they fed him and they give
[1:41:19] me a place to sleep but I was talking
[1:41:21] about a deity dwelling in many men bad
[1:41:23] bodies because since their fallen Adam
[1:41:26] there's not been a perfect person there
[1:41:29] has not been the redemption has not
[1:41:30] taken place he's been in types in law of
[1:41:32] Moses killing lambs and bulls
[1:41:35] but the ultimate redemption hasn't taken
[1:41:38] place Adam started a Redemption by
[1:41:40] covering his wife God killed a lamb to
[1:41:43] cover them up there were all types and
[1:41:45] shadows but the ultimate redemption was
[1:41:48] when he came on Kaveri but until he died
[1:41:52] and his spirit that was in him come back
[1:41:57] into the church the mission wasn't for
[1:42:00] for yet it was select France it's not
[1:42:01] blessing
[1:42:02] so Jesus on earth was a transition a
[1:42:05] blessing because God complete blessing
[1:42:07] was to dwell in
[1:42:08] all his children glory hallelujah and
[1:42:11] dwell in me so one time Peter said Lord
[1:42:14] he was so happy with the lost Lord when
[1:42:16] the law talked about his disease is
[1:42:17] death he said he's gonna die don't don't
[1:42:20] see that I'm gonna die we are happy here
[1:42:22] with you you walk on water because of
[1:42:24] you I can walk on water why you took you
[1:42:26] can I change what time to wine why you
[1:42:27] talking about iron and Jesus said that
[1:42:29] sit and get behind me because his
[1:42:32] ultimate blessing is not just to be in a
[1:42:35] bit Jesus of Nazareth but I want to be
[1:42:37] Jesus in back but i guarante they want

[1:42:54] he was he was disfigured so he couldn't
[1:42:58] be identified as a human being he was
[1:43:00] stripped naked there was nothing good
[1:43:02] but after that he became the lot of Lord
[1:43:06] and the king of kings and his dwelling
[1:43:09] in his church he came out to live in
[1:43:11] Peter to live in Paul to live in Braham
[1:43:14] to live in Mary to live in all the
[1:43:17] saints of God and now where is he living
