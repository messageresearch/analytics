[14:21] understanding everybody can just presume

[14:27] we have different
[14:29] eyes the prophet said you need the eyes
[14:33] of God yes sir amen you don't just look
[14:38] at anything and then you perceive you
[14:40] think that you have seen something you
[14:42] see
[14:43] nothing you need God's
[14:46] eyes that is why he said he will anoint
[14:50] your

[14:53] see amen
[14:57] amen I'm I'm very grateful for this
[15:00] opportunity granted me by my friend BR
[15:03] Jack to be with you
[15:05] tonight just take your Bible with and

[15:26] praise the Lord amen
[15:29] and we know that all
[15:32] things work together for good to them
[15:35] that love
[15:37] God to them which are the call according
[15:41] to his
[15:43] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[15:49] did
[15:50] predestinate to be conformed to the
[15:53] image of his son that he might be the
[15:57] firstborn among many
[16:00] Brethren moreover whom he did
[16:03] predestinate them he also called and
[16:07] whom he call them he also
[16:10] justify and whom he justify them he also
[16:15] glorified may the Lord add blessing to
[16:18] of his word you can have your seat for
[16:21] now I don't know what is happening maybe
[16:24] something is fing to
[16:26] happen amen so we we thank the Lord I
[16:30] believe that we are here for one
[16:33] purpose and uh the reason we have come
[16:35] together is to see Jesus
[16:38] Christ and that's why said if you come
[16:42] you have come to feed on the word and uh
[16:45] you are here for the believer's food
[16:47] amen and uh I love reading this most of
[16:51] the time that is hearing recognizing and
[16:53] acting on the word of God paragraph 133
[16:57] braam said
[17:00] now there is one thing that will not
[17:05] go that is the holy spirit amen
[17:10] because it is his
[17:13] word and the real predestinated believer
[17:17] would't go
[17:19] away because it is food for his soul he
[17:24] loves it nothing can keep him away from
[17:27] it he will do everything like
[17:31] Jacob but he wants the Beth right he
[17:36] will stand there I don't care if it cost
[17:40] every friend he has got if it cost his
[17:44] job if it cost his church members if it
[17:48] cost everything he will still hold to it
[17:52] because he can help it there is
[17:55] something in him moving him the Deep
[17:59] call into the
[18:01] deep there you are something in him
[18:06] Hallelujah yes
[18:08] sir there's someone that cannot run away
[18:11] from the presence of
[18:14] God everyone can choose to go one time
[18:18] the hold the multitude and all the
[18:20] people left and Jesus said Peter where
[18:23] are the
[18:24] multitude he said your seron has
[18:26] scattered them all
[18:29] Oh my he said then let us wait for the
[18:31] afternoon service I'll pre the same
[18:33] sermon again he pre the same
[18:36] sermon and the 70s left he said Peter
[18:40] what happened he said the multitud left

[18:45] left right Peter what what are you doing
[18:48] here
[18:49] then won't you join them W you go with
[18:53] them he said Lord to whom shall we go so
[18:58] I know this message let people depart
[19:01] from the message but you cannot go
[19:04] because it is personalized it is
[19:07] revealed to you amen hallelujah and
[19:10] nobody can pull Revelation from a child
[19:13] of
[19:14] God right it is for you and you only you
[19:19] cannot impart it for me I cannot impart
[19:21] it for you it is a personal
[19:25] revelation for you hallah yes
[19:30] amen the message this evening
[19:33] recognizing responding to the call for
[19:36] service right resp amen
[19:40] amen now we read in the in the Book of
[19:44] Romans all things not part not part all
[19:49] things work for
[19:52] good who are those people there are
[19:55] category of people that this thing
[19:57] pertain to them
[19:59] all things work for good to them that
[20:01] love the
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:04] Lord and these people are predestinated
[20:07] to see the day that they living in and
[20:10] the message of their day you have been
[20:13] called to see what you are seeing
[20:18] today if you're not here this message
[20:20] will not be
[20:22] here if you not here God will not send
[20:25] Abram right that's right brother because
[20:28] you here on Earth you supposed to
[20:31] receive your message of your day and the
[20:34] message is always carried by a
[20:37] prophet to bring the word of God to
[20:40] bring the people back to the way it is
[20:43] the work of a prophet not a bishop
[20:46] that's right amen that's
[20:51] right every man you are called for a
[20:57] responsibility in the munning from the
[21:00] presence of
[21:01] God that is 65 tap number 0 217 amen
[21:07] paragraph 9
[21:09] I Every Man Has To Face up to that all
[21:14] right that is God a responsibility
[21:17] before
[21:18] God you just take for instance look at
[21:22] Noah look at Moses look at
[21:26] Elijah every age
[21:28] they has to face up to a
[21:31] responsibility and they have to do it
[21:35] but that is the reason they were sent in
[21:39] the hour right that's right amen Noah in
[21:42] his scientific age how he has to face up
[21:47] to a thing that was
[21:50] unscientific you
[21:52] understand see it it was all scientific
[21:55] rather why they said said it is go it
[21:59] isn't going to rain out from the sky
[22:03] they never had rain to drop out of the
[22:08] heavens now he has to face up to it God
[22:13] said it was going to rain and then he
[22:17] then faith without W is dead listen to
[22:20] this the prophet said I believe it and
[22:23] don't make an act you believe you don't
[22:26] make any act right all right when you
[22:29] believe make an act and let it
[22:32] see you understand you say you believe
[22:35] you don't make any act just like the
[22:39] message you say oh I believe it and you
[22:41] don't make any act we want to see action
[22:45] you want to see some
[22:47] demonstration to prove what you are
[22:49] talking about not I believe I believe
[22:53] Don't Preach me brother a seron leave me
[22:57] a seron
[22:58] [Applause]
[23:00] hallelujah amen
[23:03] amen recognizing and responding to the
[23:06] call yes you must recognize what God is
[23:10] doing in your age amen if you cannot
[23:14] recognize what God is doing you can
[23:16] never be part of God
[23:19] right because it is alled to every
[23:22] generation a portion of the scripture
[23:25] for the scripture to fulfill your day
[23:28] and you must be part of your scripture
[23:30] not yesterday's scripture not tomorrow
[23:33] but
[23:34] today this is your day yes sir

[24:07] memory there was a book of record in

[26:44] them the Bible say if you can reconcile
[26:47] them let us reconcile them but if they

[27:01] Taste of this heavenly gift and come out
[27:03] to deny this

[31:14] believe it I believe that you are the
[31:16] Son of God that was to come into the
[31:19] world right when you get that Revelation
[31:24] and you are convinced that you have to
[31:27] pull something from God's
[31:30] representative nothing can stop
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:34] you said most of
[31:37] usra you are your son is sick and you
[31:40] call him you call him you call him he
[31:43] refuse
[31:44] coming and after that your son is dead

[31:57] in the time of need you refuse now my
[32:00] baby is
[32:02] dead what is your business in my home
[32:05] most of us will really treat this man in
[32:07] that
[32:09] manner but not
[32:11] matter he call for Jesus he call for
[32:14] Jesus he call for Jesus refused going he
[32:17] knew what he was
[32:19] doing if you are patient with God you

[32:35] do thank you
[32:38] Lord Master the
[32:43] Lord your friend is
[32:45] dead but I
[32:50] know you see he didn't say that you know

[32:54] know that whatever you
[32:58] ask it will be given to you Hallelujah
[33:02] whatever you ask it will be given to you
[33:06] because she has believed that in in in
[33:10] this past there was a shite woman that
[33:14] also got a baby and then this baby died
[33:18] and this sh woman he respected God's
[33:22] representative on Earth he s all the way
[33:26] people discourage her like you are being
[33:29] discouraged maybe that people are
[33:32] disappointing you but she took unto her
[33:37] faith and said regardless of all the
[33:40] opposition I will prosper the Lord will
[33:43] prosper my
[33:44] [Music]
[33:44] [Applause]
[33:46] way the husband even frustrated her it's
[33:50] not necessary you go you can never find
[33:53] a man of
[33:54] God he said I God will prosper
[33:58] me so M has read this in the scripture
[34:02] and he was convinced that if has happen
[34:05] to it happened to the sh my woman then
[34:09] God's representative can do something in
[34:12] her
[34:13] situation all
[34:16] right most of the time when you have
[34:20] comparism it brings faith that is why
[34:23] when we read this Bible we accommodate
[34:26] faith because we see characters that God
[34:29] dealt
[34:30] with and how they stay faithful to God
[34:34] and we see the results it Give Me Faith
[34:37] when I read this characters that is why
[34:39] it is good to read the Bible so that it
[34:41] will give you
[34:43] Faith

[1:18:51] amen as you are as you're leaving if you
[1:18:53] desire to amen and after brother uh
[1:18:57] Thomas preached tonight I guess we all
[1:18:59] want to give
[1:19:01] something amen we we we we thank the
[1:19:04] Lord sometime it just need to be shared
[1:19:06] like that you know and uh we have to be
[1:19:08] reminded cuz these are the things that
[1:19:11] that either block our blessings or
[1:19:13] release our
[1:19:15] blessings amen amen this is this is this
[1:19:18] is a commandment from almighty God and
[1:19:20] you know I know that there are people
[1:19:21] nowadays that say um Jesus never taught
[1:19:25] on tithes so they don't feel like uh
[1:19:28] tithing is is relevant because Jesus
[1:19:30] never taught on it and uh and I always
[1:19:33] say that um and I I was just telling the
[1:19:35] brother this I said well here's what I
[1:19:37] know and I I know about I know about the
[1:19:39] Lord I know about God that whatever he
[1:19:42] put in the
[1:19:44] scripture uh we should still be
[1:19:47] doing right and uh even though Jesus
[1:19:49] didn't teach about it he didn't have to
[1:19:51] because they was already doing it it
[1:19:53] right and the other thing is um even
[1:19:56] though you don't find and I there are
[1:19:58] there is a scripture where he does talk
[1:19:59] about ties but but but uh he talks about
[1:20:02] tith and anise and and coming which is
[1:20:04] the things that they grew right so in in
[1:20:07] the Old Testament that's also what they
[1:20:09] they gave what they grew they tied that
[1:20:11] to the Lord right so uh so Jesus did
[1:20:13] talk about that but the other thing is
[1:20:15] is that um um even though they say Jesus
[1:20:18] didn't didn't talk about it I know what
[1:20:20] God put it in the word but I can't see
[1:20:23] where he took it out the word amen amen
[1:20:27] so we still do that we still believe
[1:20:29] that we don't believe in chicken dinners
[1:20:31] and car washes and amen we pay ties and
[1:20:35] offering that's how God blesses the
[1:20:36] church right so amen God is good amen
