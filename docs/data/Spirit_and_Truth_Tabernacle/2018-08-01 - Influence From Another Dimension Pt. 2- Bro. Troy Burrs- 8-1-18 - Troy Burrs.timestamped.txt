[6:33] Amen let's give the Lord a hand a phrase
[6:37] [Music]
[6:41] amen praise the Lord as we just prepare
[6:46] amen to receive brother Troy on tonight
[6:51] last week he started on this subject
[6:56] a man of influences from a another
[7:02] dimension as I just listened to his his
[7:07] teachings I just really felt in my heart
[7:09] saying I knew that he didn't finish the
[7:11] reason that he didn't finish is because
[7:14] he was very cognizant of you know just
[7:17] the time and things of that nature you
[7:20] know and I'm so appreciative of just how
[7:22] he was conducting the service while
[7:24] while we were absent but I wanted him to
[7:28] come back around tonight because I knew
[7:29] there was more there was more than the
[7:31] Lord wanted us to hear and and I want
[7:34] him just to you know I'm still you know
[7:37] don't worry won't be here for three or
[7:39] four hours but but I want the Lord just
[7:41] to kind of share more with us and I pray
[7:44] tonight then you always just enter in
[7:46] that you receive a man what God is
[7:48] trying to say you know that as he was
[7:50] he's gonna pull the chart up again but
[7:52] as he was just showing how we were
[7:54] coming down from that heavenly dimension
[7:56] we come from God that Bible said we come
[7:58] from God and we're going back to God but
[8:00] if we're coming down that heavily
[8:01] dementia we end up you know within that
[8:03] fourth dimension the first four
[8:05] dimensions we live within that but the
[8:07] fifth dimension if you notice is on the
[8:09] bottom and brother Branham you know laid
[8:11] it out that way he called it the
[8:12] underworld so when you look at the chart
[8:14] there and and there are a number of
[8:17] things that happened in that fifth
[8:18] dimension and all Satanists trying to do
[8:21] is pull us further down everything that
[8:24] he uses is in order to pull us further
[8:27] down but what God is trying to do is
[8:29] actually pull us up right so so I trust
[8:32] that tonight as you're just kind of
[8:34] looking and you're listening and
[8:35] what the Spirit is saying to you let God
[8:38] you know just have his way in your heart
[8:41] in your life I believe he wants to speak
[8:42] to us so I mean as we just welcome
[8:44] brother Troy amen tonight let's sing a
[8:47] few course of this song amen
[8:50] I want to say I have decided to follow
[8:53] Jesus but Christ is enough for me all
[8:57] right that's it let's take a few courses
[8:59] that say cries he's enough for me whoa
[9:10] Christ he is yes enough for me Oh

[14:03] starting at the fourteenth verse a man
[14:15] say man when you got it
[14:18] I see like one brother say but here -
[14:20] Russell it'll leave a man over to God a
[14:29] man and the reeds on this rise his stand
[14:32] I'm sorry we're gonna start from the
[14:34] eleven the eleventh verse of Ephesians
[14:40] chapter six put on the whole armour of
[14:44] God that you may be able to stand
[14:46] against the wiles of the devil for we
[14:51] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[14:54] against principalities and against
[14:57] powers and against the rulers of
[14:58] darkness in this world against spiritual
[15:03] wickedness in high places
[15:07] wherefore take on take unto you the
[15:10] whole armour of God that ye may be able
[15:14] to withstand in the evil day and having
[15:17] done all to stand stand therefore having
[15:22] your lawns gird about with truth and
[15:24] having on the breastplate of
[15:27] righteousness and your feet shod with
[15:30] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[15:35] Bauval take the shield of faith
[15:37] wherewith ye be able to quench all the
[15:41] fiery darts
[15:43] of the wicked and take the helmet of
[15:47] salvation in this water the spirit which
[15:49] is the word of God praying always with
[15:55] all prayer and supplication in the
[16:00] spirit watching thereunto with all
[16:06] perseverance and supplication for All
[16:11] Saints and for me the utterance may be
[16:16] given unto me that I may open my mouth
[16:20] boldly to make known the mysteries of
[16:22] the gospel a man made all that the Lord
[16:25] had a blessing to the reading of his
[16:26] words you may be seated
[16:35] amen and just a quick recap if you put
[16:39] the Charter system
[16:52] hey man it would just briefly just kind
[16:56] of reach out what we were born over let
[16:59] me see her getting a pointer
[17:01] I got it brother huh Oh mom I gotta turn
[17:07] it on first
[17:13] I'm not very good I think
[17:18] okay alright alright a man so what we
[17:23] see here I'm a man we have this this
[17:26] chart a man that's just a real blessing
[17:29] and help us to be able to visualize what
[17:32] the Prophet was talking about and in
[17:33] looking at this we see you know that
[17:36] it's just so much here hey man you know
[17:41] the prophet of God was talking about
[17:42] that one day he said he went to an
[17:47] observatory and and and during that trip
[17:51] he said the Lord gave him a revelation
[17:55] because he began to understand that
[17:58] lights travel at so many thousands of
[18:02] miles per second and then he said if an
[18:06] angel started from the farthest star and
[18:09] coming here it would take him billions
[18:13] times billions a man of years to get
[18:17] here
[18:18] it started from if he started from Mars
[18:21] and come here flying at the speed of
[18:25] light and he said he began to just kind
[18:28] of meditate on that and and and and he
[18:31] said he said I can't believe that that
[18:35] there is a house way out yonder he said
[18:39] entry to see when the law said I go to
[18:41] prepare a place for you that where I am
[18:45] you may be also you may be also
[18:48] he was talking about a house he wasn't
[18:51] talking about a literal house he was
[18:53] talking about a body a man we live here
[18:57] thank you brother
[18:58] we here now understand that we are in
[19:02] this fleshly body amen but this body
[19:05] that we are in context this the region
[19:12] here of mortal beings now I want you to
[19:16] keep in mind
[19:18] notice here here now the the fourth
[19:21] dimension sort of just runs being the
[19:23] entire way here okay now
[19:30] the Prophet he was able to to to tap in
[19:36] I would say the Prophet but science
[19:40] education and those things are dwell
[19:44] here in this fourth dimension you see
[19:47] here radio television and the
[19:49] information super highway mine the
[19:55] information super highway
[19:58] okay the Prophet said that man amen took
[20:04] independent in the beginning of the Eden
[20:07] bit off from the nut tree of knowledge
[20:10] and good and evil and took off coal
[20:18] automobiles gunpowder things that cause
[20:25] death all in the name of education and
[20:30] progress amen
[20:34] realizing that I want to read this this
[20:40] quote here amen
[20:43] y'all pray for me that I can just get
[20:45] myself out of the way in God just have
[20:47] his way because I tell you what this is
[20:49] just so beautiful you can keep that up
[20:51] sister please keep that up just keep
[20:53] that up but we gonna be referring back
[20:55] back and forth to that throughout the
[20:58] night he says in the Garden of Eden
[21:06] there were two trees one of them was the
[21:08] knowledge was knowledge and the other
[21:11] was the Tree of Life and when man left
[21:15] the Tree of Life and took his first bite
[21:19] after tree of knowledge he separated
[21:23] himself from God and now he bit off this
[21:28] is her Gunpowder that destroys himself
[21:31] he bit off electricity pulling the coal
[21:36] from the earth and he says where
[21:39] underneath it is 8,000 miles of burning
[21:44] you know why do you think that it's
[21:48] going to cause we have the problems that
[21:50] we are having say over and California
[21:53] the fires and different things it's
[21:55] because man is tampering with the earth
[21:59] we have a situation now call they call
[22:03] global warming what is it man has has
[22:08] reached up and pulled off that tree of
[22:11] knowledge and good and evil and they
[22:14] have done things to destroy the very
[22:17] earth that we live on hey man that's
[22:21] going to cause the very destruction that
[22:23] that that we go through the Hurricanes
[22:28] are getting worse we see earthquakes all
[22:33] over the place ma'am and we have a
[22:37] testimonial or a prophecy from the
[22:40] Prophet that there will be a great
[22:42] earthquake
[22:43] what is it is all planted to the end of
[22:47] all things
[22:48] so planted to the coming of the Lord and
[22:51] then put you see man in his own wisdom
[22:56] it's trying to try to achieve things on
[23:02] his own where we will put in it for one
[23:04] reason to depend on our Heavenly Father
[23:07] we were here put here to do what they
[23:11] depend on him he said sir dear friends
[23:14] don't you know that worldly wisdom is
[23:17] the thing that destroys this world in
[23:19] the Garden of Eden there were two trees
[23:22] man eat from it from the tree and and
[23:26] and they live forever the other was the
[23:29] tree of knowledge now we look here this
[23:33] science and audience but I can only
[23:35] expect like that roots from that tree
[23:38] must have been over in this dimension we
[23:40] talk about trees but we're not talking
[23:44] about literal trees because the other
[23:48] ones the tree of life and man live
[23:51] forever
[23:52] I can only that had to be the
[23:55] the tree of life let me tell you
[23:59] something my brothers and sisters one of
[24:02] the things that the devil wanted to do
[24:03] is is is the title here that we're being
[24:07] influenced from another dimension we see
[24:13] can you can you take it up some system
[24:16] down here into this other dimension here
[24:19] the region of The Lofts we have here
[24:22] where all of the souls that that die
[24:26] without knowing Christ go to now we got
[24:31] some quotes on that it's a terrible
[24:33] place you don't want to go there he who
[24:37] came down to Calvary he came down from
[24:40] the top of Michener came all the way
[24:42] down dwelled in this dimension right
[24:45] here for a while with the Calvary he
[24:48] bore our sins in this dimension and then
[24:52] gave up the ghost to go down and
[24:55] sadistically in this dimension and
[24:58] Lanigan he what he did here he preached
[25:01] the bells oh that those those are
[25:04] patriots that that was hidden called
[25:07] paradise to deliver them from from
[25:12] because they had nowhere else to go but
[25:13] here because he he hadn't that the price
[25:18] hadn't been paid yet then he went down
[25:21] into this room amen in it and he went
[25:24] down into here and he took the keys from
[25:26] Satan and he came back up and he
[25:31] revealed themselves to the disciples and
[25:33] let them know that I'm going on that but
[25:36] I will leave you a comfortable but that
[25:41] comforter comes down he comes down here
[25:44] and what dwell in mortal bodies but that
[25:51] is here is where we are trying to get to
[25:55] where we tap into the blesses of God the
[25:59] region of the Blessed we're constantly
[26:01] being pulled up and motivated and full
[26:03] every time we go to church every time we
[26:06] word every time we read our Bible every
[26:08] time we pray we are being influenced
[26:12] from this dimension we used to sing a
[26:16] song haven't heard it in quite a while
[26:18] but it's not fear to pull a hair to call
[26:23] you are being pulled from one direction
[26:26] or another costly there's also a
[26:30] constant pull from this division a
[26:36] cosmic pool the perfect sail he said he
[26:42] would pray me said now be real Reverend
[26:45] no moving around no moving around be
[26:49] real revving and I just want to say my
[26:52] brothers and sisters even in our
[26:54] services when demons are being cast out
[27:03] the minister is praying for someone be
[27:07] real veteran because he said when when
[27:10] he spirits are cast out they immediately
[27:13] leave looking for somewhere else to live
[27:18] make no mistake about it this is not a
[27:24] game this is this is as real as it gets
[27:30] as real as it gets
[27:33] that when he says that that that spirit
[27:37] has nowhere to go and he is seeking for
[27:40] another home so he says be real Reverend
[27:45] not moving around no you get your kids
[27:48] under control
[27:50] no laughing giggling and playing and
[27:53] this that in the other
[27:54] they'll and cook you and you also can
[27:59] breed the Holy Spirit
[28:04] now your prophecy I want to go back to
[28:09] the testimony and I don't have that that
[28:11] that one give with him but I just want
[28:13] to talk about it he said that
[28:17] he was took his wife to JCPenney and he
[28:24] was sitting there while his wife was
[28:26] shopping and at that time I think he
[28:30] said he was around 55 years old and he
[28:34] said 40 years ago he had a vision hey
[28:39] man 40 years ago he had a vision and in
[28:42] that vision he she went to here he went
[28:48] here the Lord allowed him to see this
[28:50] place and he said that was the most
[28:55] hideous place though first thing he said
[28:57] he said it was full of beautiful women
[29:02] beautiful women he said they had them
[29:07] water head high haircuts they had that
[29:10] green eyeliner makeup on my eyes and
[29:16] windows blasted that made them look like
[29:19] cat eyes I see back then they had the
[29:24] glasses but my wife was just showing me
[29:28] on Instagram or one of them social media
[29:30] things as to the other day that there
[29:32] was some kind of transformation they can
[29:35] show how these young ladies are
[29:37] transforming themselves through the hair
[29:41] in the tracks and all of this kind of
[29:43] stuff you wouldn't even know if it's the
[29:46] same person the ability to transform
[29:50] themselves with the hair extensions and
[29:53] then the makeup and then it isn't in the
[29:55] eyelashes and then I've noticed that the
[29:59] way the women are doing the curling it
[30:02] often look like eyes where do you think
[30:07] that come from
[30:10] they're being influenced from another
[30:14] dimension
[30:15] why do you think that they're being
[30:17] influenced by because say they're just
[30:20] doing it for nothing he is trying to
[30:22] attract some Son of God my god he is
[30:33] trying to attract he is working hard

[31:22] not something that we just talked about
[31:24] we're in a real battle that is a
[31:26] constant constant pull from this
[31:30] dimension that seeping over into this
[31:33] dimension through electronics and
[31:36] mechanically and it imagine the people
[31:40] that don't have the Holy Ghost and you
[31:45] have to wrap shoulders go to work run
[31:49] into him at the store you have to be
[31:52] able the prophets in in this room he
[31:58] said as the he said that does gaiety now
[32:03] look that word of us again t he said it
[32:08] is an unpleasant game spirit it is
[32:13] actually gay of akhmad people that's
[32:17] just living for the moment
[32:21] like that it isn't even a God living for
[32:27] the moment doing whatever they feel
[32:31] inspired to do no resistance whatsoever
[32:37] and these people we have to deal with on
[32:42] a daily basis he said every now and then
[32:44] he said I see a streak of light he said
[32:47] what is that
[32:48] that's the Saints those that are being
[32:51] inspired from this heavenly dimension
[32:54] but he said it's in this darkness in
[32:57] this darkness of lady or seal every now
[33:02] and then there's a streak of life every
[33:05] now and he he said one way they care
[33:12] meat from spoiling places where they
[33:15] don't have air condition and they don't
[33:18] have the means they hang the meat they
[33:20] have to take salt and they care to me he
[33:25] said we are keeping this earth from
[33:27] spoiling we have a salt that's keeping
[33:33] it from spoiling rotten it's already
[33:36] rotten to the core but we are the salt
[33:40] of the earth that's just keep holding it
[33:43] together when we are gold and take it
[33:49] away from here just into that other
[33:53] dimension this thing is going to fall
[33:56] apart I'm a recent things to you amen
[34:06] lord help me
[34:26] hey man I'm sorry I wanna get this
[34:39] anyway
[34:47] bear with me
[34:52] a man he says here in the message
[34:56] it's questioning answers
[34:59] number two if you want to do this 54
[35:06] 0-1-0-3 e paragraph 45 54 zero one zero
[35:15] three paragraph 45
[35:31] Oh God go over to go
[35:42] there's now friend if you are a sinner
[35:47] and you ask this God be merciful to you
[35:51] yes sir
[35:53] you're not only under condemnation now
[35:57] not here no you'll prosper and go on and
[36:03] that's all through the mercies of God
[36:08] that's all through the mercies of God
[36:12] that you prosper and do what you do
[36:16] that's true but one of these days if
[36:22] you're a sinner and your soul slips out
[36:28] it'll go younger into judgment and will
[36:32] be condemned and then you'll be cast
[36:35] away and you'll be in torment until the
[36:40] day that you are brought back to this
[36:43] earth and you will receive an immortal
[36:48] body an immortal body that cannot die
[36:52] and will be cast away into outer
[36:56] darkness
[36:57] whether they'll be weeping wailing and
[37:00] gnashing of teeth
[37:01] you'll be cast into hell now what
[37:06] happens to meat when it rots worms he
[37:11] said well the worm never dies
[37:14] or fire is never quenched and you'll be
[37:18] tormented through all ages there is
[37:21] truth and there is to come jesus said
[37:24] that that's a black picture but it's
[37:27] what the Bible said if God so condemns
[37:32] sin that sin and he had he had it cost
[37:37] such a price that that it will be if
[37:41] those unjust spirits could ever be made
[37:45] loose again we'd have another thing like
[37:50] we have had the last six thousand years
[37:55] a man so into that out of darkness
[37:59] brothers and sisters we don't we don't
[38:01] we don't want if we don't want to go
[38:03] there we don't we don't want to go there
[38:07] by all means everything we have till I
[38:09] say he don't care how much you say that
[38:13] you from what you were being influenced
[38:16] by here he says that is where your
[38:23] representation up is he said you have a
[38:26] celestial body and this this area is his
[38:33] other thing in this air going to pass
[38:35] away he said heaven and earth will never
[38:37] pass away my word another pass away this
[38:39] area is more real than this area but you
[38:45] can't see it he gay he was talking about
[38:49] it he described it by the fish he said
[38:53] if you go down into the deepest deepest
[38:59] fathom of the sea down to where there's
[39:03] no light now here we have light so our
[39:07] eyes reflect light and we can see but
[39:12] down arrows fish those things that have
[39:15] no light so they have no eyes there's no
[39:18] need for eyes so they sort of go around
[39:22] with other senses but by him having eyes
[39:27] if he could lead that fish to food and
[39:32] to whatever they need because he can see
[39:36] how much greater if we're here in God
[39:44] with all of his Olympics and wisdom and
[39:47] the sight that he has been here is that
[39:52] is all we can do is surrender to Him and
[39:55] allow ourselves to be led by him his
[39:58] sight and revelation and understanding
[40:01] is far greater than ours because he let
[40:04] a greater lie
[40:07] and he's we're just like that
[40:10] he said multiply that example billions
[40:13] times billions he said if that fish ever
[40:17] came up to live to the surface have
[40:19] never got that light he'll never want to
[40:21] go back down to that darkness imagine
[40:26] how he sees us because he's so much
[40:30] higher he is that light and how his
[40:35] vision and how he see things here we
[40:38] think all we content just did it like
[40:41] matter in time here it is here from this
[40:45] earth these five senses only contact
[40:48] this area but in order for us to contact
[40:52] this area here it takes faith faith amen
[40:59] I want to show you something here
[41:07] a man if you will turn the light on
[41:15] brother but this is so I can see this
[41:19] thank you
[41:27] amen
[41:58] I want to read this article to you we're
[42:02] talking about being influenced from
[42:03] another dimension hey man this is an
[42:08] article called the undoing of families
[42:12] and I'd like to appreciate brother
[42:14] Matthew Barnes for this is it Matthew
[42:18] Barnes
[42:18] Matthew Watkins sorry Watkins a man of
[42:23] for this article a man
[42:26] it says here Naima cotta because it's a
[42:30] very lengthy reading but I think you'll
[42:32] find it very treating here there was a
[42:39] fifteen-year-old young girl who her
[42:44] parents noticed that her grades and
[42:48] things were dropping and she was having
[42:51] some problems so they decided to give us
[42:54] some limits on her cell phone okay they
[42:59] said something happened to got into a
[43:01] little shoving match and the girl ended
[43:04] up hitting her mom all because they took
[43:07] her phone says Kelly explained that uh
[43:10] he said that the police arrived that
[43:13] even and Kelly was so distraught he told
[43:16] the officer that she wanted to kill
[43:18] herself so an ambulance was called and
[43:21] the fifteen year old girl was strapped
[43:24] to a gurney taken to a psychiatric
[43:25] hospital and monitored for safety before
[43:29] being released days after days after
[43:33] being hospitalized
[43:34] Kelly was brought to my office with this
[43:38] is the psychologist by her parents who
[43:41] wanted great help for their trouble girl
[43:43] Kelly's parents spoke first and they
[43:46] said that their daughter's
[43:47] hospitalization was a a culmination of a
[43:50] year-long downward spiral spiral spurred
[43:53] by her phone obsession Kelly had been
[43:57] refusing to spend time with her family
[44:00] and focus on school instead she favored
[44:04] living her life through living her life
[44:06] on social media they previously had
[44:10] girl and a strong student Kelly had
[44:14] grown angry sullen and was now being in
[44:19] there and was now bringing home report
[44:21] cards with sinking grades Kelly's
[44:24] parents had tried many times and prior
[44:27] much to set limits on their daughter's
[44:30] phone use but she had become
[44:32] increasingly defiant and deceitful even
[44:36] sneaking on the phone at all hours of
[44:40] the night now who haven't had that
[44:41] problem you know I just want to start
[44:45] right there and I just want you to pay
[44:47] attention to what's going on here this
[44:49] is happening all over the world
[45:02] information superhighway see back in the
[45:06] day in the early times it was just radio
[45:11] then it became television and now
[45:15] information superhighway which does what
[45:18] goes down into this dimension and if you
[45:22] notice the gates from the bottomless pit
[45:25] and they come up and then they come into
[45:29] this this this dimension to influence
[45:33] you to influence mankind and I see they
[45:37] can't get up here but they here why
[45:44] because they can they have access to
[45:48] this flesh this flesh has to die now the
[45:54] the psychologist asked Kelly who was
[45:57] sitting in the core city in the corner
[45:59] Jason is to help me understand her
[46:02] perspective on that evening she didn't
[46:05] respond instead glared at her parents
[46:08] meanly but then surprising everyone in
[46:13] the room she cried she cried they took
[46:17] my phone attempting to engage Kelly in
[46:20] conversation I asked her that she liked
[46:23] of what was it that she liked about her
[46:25] phone and social media she said they
[46:28] made me happy
[46:30] intriguingly I'm sorry
[46:37] what none of these parents understand is
[46:40] that their children and teens
[46:44] destructive obsession with technology is
[46:47] a predictable consequence of a virtual
[46:51] unrecognized merger between the tech
[46:55] industry and psychology
[46:57] the alliance pairs the consumer tech
[47:00] industry immense wealth with the most
[47:04] sophisticated psychological research
[47:07] making it possible to develop social
[47:10] media video games phones with a drug
[47:14] like power to seduce young users I'm
[47:21] talking real stuff we're not just
[47:25] talking about now we have we have
[47:27] crossed from a spiritual deception into
[47:30] natural deceit see
[47:34] nestled in the unremarkable building on
[47:38] the stanford university campus in alto
[47:41] california is the stanford is the
[47:45] stanford persuasive technology lab
[47:47] notice the name persuasive technology
[47:51] founded in 1998 the labs created dr. BJ
[47:55] fall is a psychologist
[48:07] a psychologist and a neuroscience and a
[48:10] social science expert who used their
[48:13] knowledge of psychological
[48:16] vulnerabilities to device products that
[48:19] captures kids attention for the sake of
[48:21] Industry profit that these that these
[48:26] parents and most of the world has yet to
[48:30] grasp is this graph that psychology a
[48:34] discipline that we associate with
[48:36] healing is now being used as a weapon
[48:38] against children hey man I think I went
[48:46] back to something else okay
[48:47] let's see here persuasive technology a
[48:50] discipline in which digital machines and
[48:52] apps including smartphones social media
[48:55] video games are configured to alter
[48:58] human thoughts and behaviors as the labs
[49:01] website boldly proclaims machines
[49:04] designed to change humans fog speaks
[49:07] openly about the ability of to the use
[49:11] of smartphones and other digital media
[49:12] devices to change our ideas and actions
[49:15] we can now create machines that can
[49:18] change what people think and what people
[49:20] do and the machines can do it all so
[49:23] autonomously called the millionaire
[49:27] maker Fogg has groomed former students
[49:30] who have used his method to develop
[49:32] technologies that now consume kids lies
[49:36] as he recently taught in his on his
[49:39] personal website my students often do
[49:41] often through groundbreaking projects
[49:44] and they continue to have impact in the
[49:47] world after they leave Stanford for
[49:50] example Instagram has an influence the
[49:54] behavior of eight hundred million people
[49:58] and the co-founder was a student of mine
[50:06] while Fogg emphasizes persuasive design
[50:09] Sunday future is quite indifferent to
[50:12] the disturbing reality now the hidden
[50:15] influence techniques are being used by
[50:19] the tech industry to hook and exploit
[50:22] users for profit his enthusiastic vision
[50:26] also conveniently neglects to include
[50:29] how this generation of children and
[50:31] teens with their highly malleable minds
[50:36] are being manipulated and hurt by forces
[50:40] unseen if you haven't heard of
[50:47] persuasive technology that's no accident
[50:50] tech corporations would prefer that they
[50:52] remain in the shadows and most of us
[50:56] don't want to be don't want to be
[50:59] controlled or have special aversion to
[51:01] key is being manipulated for profit for
[51:03] profit persuasive technology also called
[51:07] called persuasive design works by
[51:09] deliberately creating digital
[51:12] environments that users feel fulfilled
[51:14] their basic human drives to be social or
[51:18] obtained goals better than real-world
[51:21] alternatives kids spend countless of
[51:23] hours in social media and video games
[51:26] environments in pursuit of likes and
[51:30] friends and gain points and levels
[51:38] because it's stimulating they believe
[51:41] that this makes them happy and
[51:43] successful and they find it easier than
[51:47] doing the difficult but developmentally
[51:49] important activities of childhood while
[51:53] persuasive techniques work well on
[51:56] adults they are particularly effective
[51:59] in influence to steel but showing mind
[52:01] of a teen brain video games better than
[52:04] anything else in our culture deliver
[52:06] rewards to people especially teenage
[52:09] boys teenage boys are wired to seek
[52:12] competency to master our world and get
[52:15] better at stuff video games and dishing
[52:18] out reward
[52:18] which can convey to people that their
[52:23] competency is grown you can get better
[52:26] at something second-by-second and it's
[52:28] persuasive design that helps convince
[52:31] this generation of boys that they're
[52:33] gaining competences and spending
[52:35] countless hours on game sites and the
[52:37] sad reality is that they're locked away
[52:39] in their room gaining ignoring school
[52:42] and developing the real world kind of
[52:45] competencies that colleges and employers
[52:47] demand a man
[52:52] so we seed my brothers and sisters
[52:54] there's further on in here it reads that
[52:59] lets me see this drug like powers so if
[53:05] we think about that and we see that
[53:09] there's people addicted to certain
[53:12] things a person that is a alcoholic what
[53:19] is an alcoholic a person that is
[53:23] possessed by a demon they need
[53:28] deliverance many times the Prophet pray
[53:31] for alcoholics he had to call the devil
[53:35] I a person that have a they would call
[53:41] it these days a addiction to some drug
[53:47] with methamphetamine or marijuana they
[53:51] have opened themselves up and they are
[53:55] possessed by a demon to the point to
[53:59] where they can't shake it
[54:01] they can't stop that demon has taken
[54:02] control what do you think
[54:09] drilled light tendencies is a demon
[54:19] coming up from this room taking a ride
[54:23] on the fourth dimension and influencing
[54:30] influencing mortal beings
[54:39] a man
[54:42] now disclaimer he said that they here
[54:48] and they took automobile van took from
[54:50] this tree of knowledge and good and evil
[54:52] and say automobiles they killed himself
[54:54] am i saying don't drive automobile no
[54:57] it's not what I'm saying
[54:59] so am i saying getting rid of your cell
[55:01] phones and things no what am I saying
[55:06] put on the whole armor of God that you
[55:12] may be able to stand a wise of these are
[55:17] the wiles of the devil take the shield
[55:21] of faith that you may be able to quench
[55:24] the fire it does a man my brothers and
[55:31] sisters we are he said which we can hear
[55:34] we like a palm tree which ever waved the
[55:37] tree lean and at that time when your
[55:41] time here on earth is up that's which
[55:44] way it's going to follow there's a
[55:47] constant pool there's a constant pool I
[55:53] want to read something here
[56:23] he says here now I'm just believing that
[56:28] you're going to pour out a blessing I'm
[56:31] in the expectation here and I don't have
[56:33] the paragraph number sister I'm gonna
[56:35] just hold it he says Lord I believe that
[56:37] you're going to pour out an expert
[56:40] expecting that things are moving right
[56:44] in and I'm expecting to see the
[56:47] exceeding abundantly now I'm expecting
[56:50] it and when you go you come down and say
[56:54] well let me let me let me read that
[56:59] again because I don't want to I don't
[57:01] want you to miss it
[57:02] Lord I'm just believing that you're
[57:05] going to pour out a blessing I'm
[57:08] expecting it now all things are moving
[57:13] right in and I'm expecting to see the
[57:17] exceeding and abundantly now I'm
[57:21] expecting them and when you go you come
[57:25] down and say well I don't know about
[57:28] that he says see you hurt the other
[57:33] person now you're setting by one of them
[57:38] and you say Oh Lord just tear him down I
[57:42] just turned the person down I'm just
[57:43] expecting great things see and that
[57:47] expectancy would get the unity among the
[57:51] people that's what happened on the day
[57:55] of Pentecost what brought the Holy Ghost
[57:59] in the first place they went up there
[58:02] and stayed ten days and ten nights and
[58:07] they were in they were until they were
[58:13] in one place and in one Accord blessing
[58:18] God from something that they did not
[58:21] have blessing God for something that
[58:25] they did not have now let me slow down
[58:29] and i'ma walk you through this man
[58:32] that's what happened on that day of
[58:34] Pentecost
[58:35] what brought the holy ghost in the first
[58:38] place they went up and stayed for ten
[58:44] days and ten nights not when they went
[58:46] up to the upper room they stayed for ten
[58:49] days and ten nights and I said until
[58:51] they were in one place what may already
[58:55] in one place when they went up to the
[58:58] upper room so what place was he talking
[59:05] about
[59:10] can you put the chart back over this
[59:14] place
[59:17] this place they had to get into the
[59:21] channel several times and I don't have
[59:24] all of the quotes right here with me but
[59:26] the Prophet is praying for people he
[59:28] said if you can just get into that
[59:30] dimension and accept your healing this
[59:34] is where it takes place
[59:35] this is where your faith thing this is
[59:38] where that $0.06 a so when you come here
[59:41] to worship you can God is a spirit you
[59:47] can't don't worship Him truly unless you
[59:51] worship Him in spirit you have to leave
[59:54] this and get into that channel to where
[1:00:01] you can be blessed by God why so many
[1:00:09] times we come to church and the devil
[1:00:12] fights our mind I mentioned this last
[1:00:14] week there's all kind of thoughts and
[1:00:16] think he's trying to keep you grounded
[1:00:18] here if you can ever let go and just let
[1:00:22] yourself get into this channel all in
[1:00:26] one place in one of court my god there's
[1:00:34] nothing that a stand cancel be healed
[1:00:39] every child of children be safe people
[1:00:42] will be filled with the baptism of the
[1:00:43] Holy Ghost
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:45] why because we're all in one place and
[1:00:50] God come down and fellowship his desire
[1:00:54] when he was fellowshipping in the Garden
[1:00:57] of Eden he came down any fellowship with
[1:00:59] Adam and Eve this is where he met them
[1:01:02] and in this place in the cool of the
[1:01:10] evening
[1:01:10] now here after everything had happened
[1:01:13] and then time started after the fall
[1:01:17] Adam walked out he had done don't run he
[1:01:19] slipped down Adam where you at he's lost
[1:01:24] fellowship lost fellowship
[1:01:29] cuz they didn't know how to get back up
[1:01:31] here but we know how to get my Amen so
[1:01:42] that we can have fellowship with our God
[1:01:45] again so that's why it's so important my
[1:01:49] brothers and sisters he said that we
[1:01:51] come people come we have expectancy have
[1:01:55] this expectation and you come and and
[1:01:58] all of a sudden doubt or suddenly you'll
[1:02:02] hardly say you pull the next person down
[1:02:05] that's why they all had to be in one
[1:02:10] place and in one Accord then the Holy
[1:02:15] Spirit can move freely there's no
[1:02:18] restrictions he can have his way

[1:04:04] channel if you can just let go of this
[1:04:09] world if you can just let this flesh die
[1:04:15] it has to die the more it dies the more
[1:04:19] it is fleshed out or more you rise up
[1:04:22] because this what's keeping your
[1:04:23] grounded this is this is your great you
[1:04:26] you are your greatest enemy your flesh
[1:04:29] this pest house
[1:04:31] I got quotes on it maybe once we can get
[1:04:34] out of this pass house this flashback we
[1:04:38] move up into this into this realm
[1:04:41] brother branham say
[1:04:47] let me read this last hole
[1:04:53] I see I went all over the place that my
[1:04:55] notes is kind of all that so I'm gonna
[1:04:58] find it I got it he said he lives in
[1:05:01] that dimension
[1:05:18] I wonder if I brought it
[1:05:29] I may not have brought it or I may not
[1:05:32] have highlighted it a man but anyway the
[1:05:35] prophets say your doctor you go to your
[1:05:38] doctor and your doctor knows about your
[1:05:47] body he knows about your Anatomy he says
[1:05:52] but he says but I prophets speaking he
[1:05:57] says see I live in a whole nother
[1:05:59] dimension
[1:06:00] I see things doctor can't see he says it
[1:06:06] ain't even no sense in me trying to
[1:06:08] explain it to you he says I live in that
[1:06:12] dimension if our prophet can live in
[1:06:18] that dimension can we
[1:06:24] angry another place he said what
[1:06:31] happened why we can't sometime into that
[1:06:35] dimension amen
[1:06:37] Thank You sister that is and that he say
[1:06:40] our heart is not in tune
[1:06:45] he said that Christ come down through
[1:06:49] those dimensions through the region of
[1:06:52] angels and into the region of a bless he
[1:06:55] say sometimes you can't say your heart
[1:06:57] has to be in tune your heart has to be
[1:07:01] tuned in tuned with his so it's not just
[1:07:06] a pressing law but God is love
[1:07:11] it is the purest form the purest form of
[1:07:14] love that there is everything else is a
[1:07:19] perversion or a lesser form he says
[1:07:24] nothing to enter that but perfect love
[1:07:26] and it's going to take that perfect love
[1:07:29] that's how you tune in that's the man
[1:07:33] makes there's a tuner that will tune in
[1:07:36] and pick up television and radio waves
[1:07:39] but how do we tune in and pick up it's
[1:07:43] the heart
[1:07:43] in tune with his heart it's how you get
[1:07:48] on his level
[1:07:51] perfect love love for one another love
[1:07:55] for him
[1:08:01] sine cry for the people fulfill for
[1:08:05] mankind who are lost and knowing what
[1:08:09] they're gonna go through having that
[1:08:12] perfect love because that's what he has
[1:08:15] that's what he has
[1:08:17] he doesn't desire to see those things
[1:08:19] happen that he came and he bought us he
[1:08:22] bought a sin upon himself and paid the
[1:08:24] price that man might be saved and we
[1:08:31] have to have that same love and concern
[1:08:33] as we take on the mind of Christ
[1:08:37] as we get closer as we move into that
[1:08:40] dimension we we have that love we have
[1:08:44] that concern we pray one for another if
[1:08:47] you don't notice that he said if you
[1:08:49] don't feel like coming to church come to

[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:47] appreciate the Lord for brother Troy
[1:11:50] tonight let's give the Lord a hand the
[1:11:53] breeze I you know I just just really I
[1:12:03] think there's a there's a lot in that
[1:12:06] subject and I know it's something that
[1:12:09] all of us could identify with it's just
[1:12:15] just knowing how statements uselessness
[1:12:17] as if I could draw things reading that
[1:12:21] article and how the young lady is so
[1:12:23] attached to her phone it's like a drug
[1:12:25] and if we were honest with ourselves
[1:12:29] probably have to be honest with mom so I
[1:12:31] got a little game that I love to play on
[1:12:33] my on my phone and man I'm a is an
[1:12:38] addiction right it's an addiction I
[1:12:41] remember being in Seattle going out for
[1:12:45] a we're going for our cruise and we had
[1:12:51] to get some paperwork and everything
[1:12:52] together
[1:12:53] we left our passports here and so we
[1:12:56] went run around rushing around Seattle
[1:12:58] trying to get things done before we get
[1:12:59] on the boat and I ended up in a FedEx
[1:13:05] place or something like that so I'm
[1:13:07] sitting there you know trying to get
[1:13:09] everything together and did this young
[1:13:11] lady I see she's playing the game that I
[1:13:12] like to play so I say well you you you
[1:13:15] you any good at death yeah I'm pretty
[1:13:17] good I'm pretty good okay you're pretty
[1:13:20] good with less my name is dis and your
[1:13:23] name is death and I want to test
[1:13:24] obviously how good she was and you start
[1:13:27] doing that with all people all over the
[1:13:29] world and there's an addiction that
[1:13:31] begins to develop right and you're just
[1:13:33] trying to beat anybody all over the
[1:13:34] world and you know now he's just kind of
[1:13:37] going through that I've realized a
[1:13:38] member a demon spirit reaching up from
[1:13:41] another dimension
[1:13:42] trying to pull me into something that I
[1:13:44] probably shouldn't be into
[1:13:45] and if that's uh if that would happen to
[1:13:48] me I wonder about the whole church and
[1:13:50] and some of the other areas that Satan
[1:13:53] is using to come against us right and
[1:13:56] you know so we don't have a quote on the
[1:13:58] Internet
[1:13:59] we look there's no quote that brother
[1:14:01] Branham didn't say anything about the
[1:14:02] Internet it wasn't here at his time but
[1:14:04] it's the same spirit right the same
[1:14:07] spirit way he was crying out against
[1:14:09] television and crying out against radio
[1:14:10] it's the same spirit that's coming now
[1:14:13] through the internet and it just
[1:14:15] reminded me of of those seven visions
[1:14:19] that the prophets had before the coming
[1:14:22] of the Lord and the fourth vision the
[1:14:26] fourth vision was the one that showed
[1:14:28] great advances in science that would
[1:14:32] come after the Second World War and you
[1:14:35] know notice it's the fourth vision
[1:14:37] science operates at the fourth dimension
[1:14:41] right and it's the great advances and
[1:14:43] you know when you just think about I
[1:14:45] think about my mom and and you know just
[1:14:48] just maybe some of the other saints that
[1:14:52] what they've seen in a lifetime I mean
[1:14:56] you know you all cut when they was
[1:15:00] coming up everyone no such thing as
[1:15:02] nobody having us having a cell phone in
[1:15:04] the pulpit that was unheard of right but
[1:15:07] I mean you you realized what a phone was
[1:15:11] this rotary dial thing you know even
[1:15:16] even a telephone numbers that the stuff
[1:15:19] that it's unbelievable what they went
[1:15:22] through and they had what we call what
[1:15:24] they call it a party line right y'all
[1:15:27] y'all call it we call it nowadays you
[1:15:29] know we want to get three or four people
[1:15:32] on the phone so we might call it a third
[1:15:34] party or whatever but but a party line
[1:15:36] back there is we are the neighborhood
[1:15:39] has shared the telephone
[1:15:41] line the whole neighborhood Sheraton
[1:15:43] right and you know so to see and this is
[1:15:46] this is as kids they can hours I was in
[1:15:49] a place left all the color televisions
[1:15:51] that were costing six seven hundred
[1:15:53] dollars a color television and it was so
[1:15:56] slow and one nothing like what we see
[1:16:00] nowadays nothing like that right but but
[1:16:02] the advances in technology of what
[1:16:04] people are seeing in their lifetime
[1:16:06] is it's just the vision that brother
[1:16:09] Branham talked about is being fulfilled
[1:16:10] and what we have to do is be extremely
[1:16:14] careful that we don't allow the enemy to
[1:16:16] pull us into some of these the rim we
[1:16:19] bet we are being influenced by another
[1:16:21] dimension Facebook it's influenced by
[1:16:26] another dimension Instagram influenced
[1:16:29] by another dimension what some another
[1:16:33] was snapchat and fluence by another
[1:16:37] dimension halo and Florence by another
[1:16:41] dimension right what was some of the
[1:16:45] other ones out there Twitter influenced
[1:16:48] by another dimension some of us we can't
[1:16:50] wait to get out this church the check
[1:16:54] some stuff here we can't wait to get out
[1:16:57] when you let when you like that you
[1:16:59] influenced by another dimension there's
[1:17:04] an addiction it's an addiction and when
[1:17:07] you talk about the lights everybody know
[1:17:10] they posts to get likes right I mean I I
[1:17:14] put a script right there and I'll be
[1:17:15] trying to see how many people gonna like
[1:17:17] the scripture that's that's that's right
[1:17:19] yeah right get get 10 12 likes but I put
[1:17:24] a picture myself I got a hundred and
[1:17:26] something like no I want you to like the
[1:17:28] words right but we keep doing this in
[1:17:32] instead it's an addiction and once you
[1:17:34] get one you know you get some good like
[1:17:36] there you got to come up with something
[1:17:37] else for the next it's an addiction it's
[1:17:40] an addiction and you know and this right
[1:17:42] here as well as television television
[1:17:46] used to be our babysitter
[1:17:49] I ain't lyin get too many mans but it
[1:17:52] was the babysitter
[1:17:54] we we we sent the kids right down in
[1:17:57] front of it because we just didn't want
[1:17:59] to hear nothing from us so he put
[1:18:00] something on for them to watch and it
[1:18:02] became the babysitter now we got a
[1:18:04] telephone we got my path we got a cell
[1:18:06] phone we got all that that we're giving
[1:18:08] the kids and that becoming a babysitter
[1:18:10] and they've been influenced by another
[1:18:13] dimension god help us here tonight don't
[1:18:17] take these things lightly Church I think
[1:18:20] God for that I pray to be something to
[1:18:22] cause us all just to do a
[1:18:23] self-evaluation and you know and and and
[1:18:27] really I used to think fasting from
[1:18:30] things like this was really come on man
[1:18:32] people used to get up big plate now you
[1:18:34] just talk about giving up your cell
[1:18:35] phone you know we probably do need to do
[1:18:38] that I mean just you need to just go on
[1:18:41] a fast
[1:18:42] I'm not getting on no no social media no
[1:18:46] nothing and don't announce the people
[1:18:48] that you pass I'm disconnected but
[1:18:52] that's fine that's funny they'll be able
[1:18:54] to figure it out when you stop liking
[1:18:55] everything right but but just just fast
[1:18:58] sometime just put yourself on a fast put
[1:19:02] yourself on a fast and just disconnect
[1:19:05] some time from this we've been
[1:19:07] influenced by another dimension thank
[1:19:11] you brother Troy we appreciate
[1:19:12] appreciate that tonight god bless you
[1:19:14] god bless you
[1:19:17] god bless you let's have the brothers
[1:19:19] come let's prepare for tonight's
[1:19:21] offering and so good to have sister
[1:19:26] Dixon with us a man on tonight and
[1:19:29] certainly appreciates it uses god bless
[1:19:31] you
[1:19:31] ale and a man named man praise the Lord
[1:19:37] brothers you all could come and that's
[1:19:39] just that word of Prayer
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:48] Father we we thank you Lord for your
[1:19:54] word that has that has come to us
[1:20:00] Lord ah we should all be challenged in
[1:20:03] this place tonight from what we've heard
[1:20:05] we should all be challenged and God my
[1:20:09] prayer is that we don't let this just go
[1:20:12] in one ear and out the other but Lord
[1:20:14] let it let it let it just continue to
[1:20:18] deal with our hearts let it just this
[1:20:23] continuous speak don't let us rest God
[1:20:26] as we just even leave this place going
[1:20:28] back into some of those places that we
[1:20:30] probably shouldn't be God Lord let let
[1:20:33] conviction settle in God that we really
[1:20:37] really think about these things
[1:20:40] you don't speak these things just
[1:20:43] because you have purpose of everything
[1:20:46] that you say you had you had a reason
[1:20:48] for allowing brother Troy just to see
[1:20:50] some of these things and and Lord just
[1:20:53] inspire him to want to bring it here to
[1:20:54] the church God is because you love us
[1:20:57] and Satan is doing everything he can to
[1:21:01] try to disrupt and pull us down we want
[1:21:03] to rise up that we can really be in one
[1:21:05] mind and one Accord in one place as it
[1:21:08] was brought out so beautifully tonight
[1:21:09] they were already sitting in the upper
[1:21:11] room they weren't in one place but Oh
[1:21:14] God you had you were talking about
[1:21:16] something a little higher and Lord when
[1:21:18] we're thinking some of the things that
[1:21:19] we think it's hard to get every heart
[1:21:21] every mind and one one Accord in one
[1:21:23] place so God we we got to come to a spot
[1:21:27] Lord where we're we're pushing these
[1:21:29] things to the side the Bible say we have
[1:21:31] to lay aside every sin and every weight
[1:21:34] that's so easily besets of some of these
[1:21:36] things are not sins but they are ways
[1:21:39] and they beset us god help us Lord Jesus
[1:21:42] to fly this father's we've just prepared
[1:21:45] a gift from our hearts tonight we pray
[1:21:46] to to it use this for the furthest of
[1:21:48] your kingdom may you receive all the
[1:21:50] glory all the honor and all the praise
[1:21:51] through our giving tonight in Jesus name
[1:21:54] we ask it
[1:21:56] man
[1:22:01] praise the Lord
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:05] brother fro is just kind of sharing
[1:22:07] about that gaiety and living for the
[1:22:10] moment and I know that there is a saying
[1:22:15] a lot of people have this Yolo you only
[1:22:18] live once mentality and and they've just
[1:22:22] wrapped up in games you know and that
[1:22:25] that persuasive technology many of you
[1:22:28] all can certainly identify with that you
[1:22:32] can be in your car having a conversation
[1:22:34] and you ask a question in the car just a
[1:22:39] little question your phone picks up on
[1:22:42] your question and and then will actually
[1:22:46] try to give you an answer as soon as you
[1:22:47] go to you know as soon as you go to your
[1:22:49] phone pull up google it it's already
[1:22:52] hurt what you're saying these are things
[1:22:54] that's persuasive technology at its best
[1:22:56] right and and if it can influence you in
[1:23:00] any way that's exactly what they're
[1:23:02] trying to do I remember when I was in
[1:23:03] college they were talking about this
[1:23:05] persuasive technology I say no way
[1:23:07] you're my buddy no you no do not like
[1:23:10] that you you click on something a man
[1:23:12] just to search something on in there all
[1:23:14] of a sudden all the products that's in
[1:23:17] that line start showing up on your page
[1:23:19] right and you wonder why they got up
[1:23:22] it's persuasive technology and they're
[1:23:24] trying to force you into areas that you
[1:23:26] probably never want to go into search be
[1:23:28] careful this is the devil the devil is
[1:23:30] all over the place and you can't you
[1:23:32] can't stop using it you've got a need
[1:23:34] you're gonna need all these things you
[1:23:35] know in order to get through life but
[1:23:37] just watch the death right be careful
[1:23:40] watch the devil man he's he's so tricky
[1:23:43] some tricky so slash so man
[1:23:48] Iza Devils it's all I can say he's a
[1:23:52] devil Church he'll use anything to give
[1:23:55] a son of God down so y'all y'all or
