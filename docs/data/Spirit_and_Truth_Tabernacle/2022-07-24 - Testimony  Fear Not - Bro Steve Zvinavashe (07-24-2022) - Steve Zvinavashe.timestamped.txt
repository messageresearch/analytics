[48:06] you say those who want to go so i stayed
[48:09] with the meeting even though i knew i
[48:11] didn't have a single penny for it

[48:15] month progressed
[48:17] i just said if the lord wants me to go
[48:19] i'm going to be there
[48:21] and

[1:15:19] i'll get the power to come out of a
[1:15:21] danger
[1:15:23] this is my destiny song all right
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:27] i'm going to ask you to take your seats
[1:15:35] i'm going to say to you my testimony
[1:15:40] what god ordained me to pass through
[1:15:45] on the 17th of june
[1:15:47] 2021
[1:15:59] this song
[1:16:00] that we are singing
[1:16:03] is a song that i love so much
[1:16:08] it's a song which when i sing it
[1:16:10] even if when i'm in my lowest air
[1:16:13] i would rise up
[1:16:16] i would feel the fibers of strength
[1:16:19] coming back to me
[1:16:23] let me start by saying
[1:16:30] i have
[1:16:33] four girls
[1:16:36] and one boy
[1:16:40] the boy
[1:16:42] is called isaac
[1:16:45] he came after a long time
[1:16:49] the girl before isaac
[1:16:52] was a restoration
[1:16:56] we had a child who are still born
[1:17:01] but
[1:17:03] god saw it fit to give us another girl
[1:17:07] not that i'm being judgmental to my
[1:17:09] children
[1:17:11] but when i look at these two that i've
[1:17:13] mentioned
[1:17:14] they mean a lot to me
[1:17:16] because of what i passed through
[1:17:21] getting into my testimony i believe it
[1:17:24] is going to
[1:17:25] esteem or provoke somebody
[1:17:28] who was just about to give up
[1:17:36] my last week in church during
[1:17:39] the month of june
[1:17:41] 2021
[1:17:43] was a sunday before the 17th of june
[1:17:51] it all started on the month of may
[1:17:56] i grew a desire
[1:18:00] of this song that we have just seen
[1:18:04] i'm running a small business of a
[1:18:06] franchise big
[1:18:07] in england
[1:18:12] every time i sing this song
[1:18:15] it has never happened in my life
[1:18:19] i'll start to cry
[1:18:23] not me opening of mouth crying but
[1:18:26] shedding tears
[1:18:28] and i was shaking
[1:18:34] i thought maybe there were emotions
[1:18:40] but this song i could hear it being sung
[1:18:42] somewhere
[1:18:44] and i could join in then the moment i
[1:18:47] joined in
[1:18:49] i would always cry
[1:18:52] i got to a point one time when i was
[1:18:54] driving
[1:18:56] i came to the traffic lights
[1:19:00] and i was singing this song
[1:19:03] and i started to cry
[1:19:06] hysterically and when i was checking
[1:19:09] with the corner of my eye on my next
[1:19:12] driver was on my right she was a white
[1:19:14] lady
[1:19:16] she was she had noticed that i was
[1:19:18] crying
[1:19:19] she was giving me a sign of saying lower
[1:19:22] down your window i want to talk to you
[1:19:24] and i want to help you
[1:19:27] but
[1:19:28] i knew she couldn't understand what i
[1:19:30] was passing through
[1:19:33] i got to a situation where i said lord
[1:19:37] what is this
[1:19:38] that is happening to my life
[1:19:44] to me i was in a state of confusion
[1:19:48] sometimes if i sing it i would check
[1:19:51] like you know i don't i couldn't
[1:19:52] understand
[1:19:56] then it came to my heart to say maybe
[1:19:58] god was just about to take me
[1:20:03] this is in the month of may
[1:20:05] so every i didn't tell my wife i didn't
[1:20:07] tell my children
[1:20:10] i've got two married
[1:20:12] girls back home in in england
[1:20:16] so one day when i came back from work
[1:20:21] they were upstairs in our in their rooms
[1:20:24] and i was in my bedroom
[1:20:26] together with their mom they just
[1:20:28] started to sing that song
[1:20:30] i said do these people understand and
[1:20:32] know how this song is affecting me
[1:20:37] so i'm a man who doesn't want to be seen
[1:20:39] crying in front of my children
[1:20:42] or my wife
[1:20:44] so i quickly dashed down the steps to
[1:20:46] the kitchen
[1:20:48] they were singing it so melodiously and
[1:20:51] so harmoniously
[1:20:55] it shook me very much
[1:20:57] and i was crying there
[1:21:00] then i went up
[1:21:01] after they had sung it
[1:21:05] this is the month of may
[1:21:07] then i said well
[1:21:09] let me text brother joseph our song
[1:21:11] leader
[1:21:13] i said brother joseph i'm kindly asking
[1:21:15] you to sing this song for me
[1:21:19] you said by all means brother steve
[1:21:26] that very sunday that he was supposed to
[1:21:28] sing he visited another message church
[1:21:31] and the song was not signed
[1:21:33] i said fairing fine
[1:21:36] the second week
[1:21:38] i reminded him
[1:21:40] then he said it will be done
[1:21:44] but the holy ghost on that day took us
[1:21:46] on a tangent and that song was never
[1:21:48] sung
[1:21:51] the third week
[1:21:54] the same thing happened but then the
[1:21:56] fourth week
[1:21:58] brother joseph said today we are going
[1:22:00] to sing your song
[1:22:03] he's saying it
[1:22:05] i was sitting on the corner on the side
[1:22:07] of the
[1:22:08] church
[1:22:10] something upon my heart
[1:22:13] said all is done
[1:22:15] i felt like a stone being removed from
[1:22:18] my heart
[1:22:21] then now
[1:22:22] i became a scared person
[1:22:27] i was now
[1:22:28] being meticulous in every way where i go
[1:22:31] or whatever i do
[1:22:34] unbeknown to my
[1:22:36] wife and children
[1:22:39] but on my own
[1:22:42] i was just
[1:22:44] a scared person
[1:22:47] there's one thing that i always
[1:22:51] do i always
[1:22:52] take my god to task
[1:22:55] if i want anything from him
[1:22:59] i always first start by reminding him
[1:23:03] that i did not volunteer to become a
[1:23:05] christian
[1:23:11] i always approached him with that kind
[1:23:13] of mentality
[1:23:15] then i said lord
[1:23:18] i know something is fixing to happen to
[1:23:20] my life
[1:23:23] can you reveal it to me
[1:23:27] the moment i said that
[1:23:30] fear came upon my heart
[1:23:32] because i knew
[1:23:34] he is a gentleman
[1:23:37] yield
[1:23:38] possibly
[1:23:40] reveal it to me but i was scared of the
[1:23:42] truth
[1:23:44] i said i would rather remain
[1:23:47] blinded and walk into the program of god
[1:23:51] without knowing it
[1:23:55] one time i thought of telling my pastor
[1:23:58] then i said let me hold fire
[1:24:07] i continued with my daily life
[1:24:10] but always being alert
[1:24:13] i thought maybe the enemy was going to
[1:24:15] come from this side
[1:24:17] i was just walking a scared person
[1:24:21] then came the 17th of june
[1:24:25] 2021
[1:24:27] i said to my wife
[1:24:30] goodbye i'm going to work is normal
[1:24:34] left for work
[1:24:38] when i went to work
[1:24:40] at work
[1:24:41] they normally
[1:24:46] they give me a name
[1:24:48] the name is pastor stevia scam
[1:24:51] so normally when they are sharing their
[1:24:53] daily talks they stop
[1:24:56] so
[1:24:58] either i sing or i whistle
[1:25:01] so i used to whistle this song
[1:25:04] on my waking area
[1:25:07] and that morning it was just a peculiar
[1:25:10] morning
[1:25:12] i was facing the east whistling sorting
[1:25:14] out whatever i was i wanted to do
[1:25:17] and i sang that song
[1:25:19] for a good five minutes
[1:25:22] and when i look back
[1:25:25] colleagues where colleagues were
[1:25:26] standing there listening
[1:25:29] some they said
[1:25:31] we know you are a christian
[1:25:33] but the way of sing that song
[1:25:36] makes us as well to be christian
[1:25:41] then i said to them so be it
[1:25:45] after that i felt a what spell of air
[1:25:48] coming upon myself
[1:25:50] i started to sweat
[1:25:52] then i walked out i thought what's
[1:25:55] what's happening in my life
[1:25:59] when i walked out i came back a
[1:26:01] refreshed person had taken off my fleece
[1:26:03] jacket
[1:26:04] and left it in the van
[1:26:07] i came back finished everything that i
[1:26:08] wanted to do
[1:26:11] then i said goodbye to my friends
[1:26:14] i drove off
[1:26:17] when i was working now out there
[1:26:23] that day was
[1:26:25] so peculiar
[1:26:28] let me just say this junction
[1:26:31] my brothers my sisters
[1:26:35] when your day comes
[1:26:37] you will know it
[1:26:41] there is no shade of doubt about it
[1:26:44] when your day comes
[1:26:47] you will know it
[1:26:52] i drove around
[1:26:56] 12 midday
[1:27:00] i started to feel dizzy
[1:27:03] my sight was a bit blurry
[1:27:06] and i had a sharp
[1:27:09] and excruciating headache
[1:27:12] the headache was
[1:27:14] starting from here
[1:27:16] going backwards
[1:27:17] i never felt any pain in front of me
[1:27:23] i normally have a problem of acid
[1:27:26] if i eat a lot of roasted meat and
[1:27:28] spices then i thought maybe let me just
[1:27:30] ask for a glass of water from any of the
[1:27:32] neighborhood
[1:27:34] so i stopped first
[1:27:37] at a certain house and knocked
[1:27:41] the white lady came out
[1:27:44] she was taking taken aback when she
[1:27:46] looked at me
[1:27:48] i said what is it that i have developed
[1:27:49] on my face
[1:27:51] then i said can i have a glass of meal
[1:27:55] she quickly said no i don't have a glass
[1:27:56] of milk again she closed the door
[1:28:00] i went back to my van i looked at myself
[1:28:02] to see if maybe there were some changes
[1:28:05] on my physical appearance
[1:28:09] then i said no
[1:28:11] i'll go to another
[1:28:13] house i knocked on the other house
[1:28:15] a man came out i said please can i have
[1:28:18] a glass of milk
[1:28:19] then he said okay all day he ran into
[1:28:21] his house
[1:28:22] opened the fridge
[1:28:24] poured a glass of milk for me he said
[1:28:26] there you are you can even take the
[1:28:28] glass with you
[1:28:30] i said fair and fine
[1:28:32] i took the milk
[1:28:34] went and sit down
[1:28:37] then i started to vomit
[1:28:40] and vomiting
[1:28:44] but the vomiting was not normal
[1:28:46] i said i've never
[1:28:48] i've never vomited like this
[1:28:53] i was i was halfway with my job
[1:28:57] but now the pain was getting worse
[1:29:04] let me say this at the same time
[1:29:07] me and my son isaac
[1:29:11] when we get into any problem
[1:29:15] if i pick up the phone
[1:29:18] and tell my pastor
[1:29:20] brother whisper
[1:29:22] to say this is the problem that i have
[1:29:25] if he prays
[1:29:27] it's a done deal
[1:29:30] brother and sister it is important
[1:29:34] to recognize
[1:29:36] your pastors
[1:29:39] these are ordained men of god
[1:29:45] i'm not saying this because my pastor is
[1:29:48] there
[1:29:49] i'll say it during his absence
[1:29:54] he is my shepherd
[1:29:57] who make me
[1:29:58] to see the kingdom of heaven
[1:30:04] the same applies with my son
[1:30:06] my son would say dad don't pray for me
[1:30:09] call
[1:30:10] brother whisper
[1:30:11] then would call brother whisper at times
[1:30:14] i'll feel does my son belittle me with
[1:30:17] my faith
[1:30:19] but i then learned to
[1:30:22] respect
[1:30:24] his feelings
[1:30:28] so when i got to a place where i thought
[1:30:32] i was now cornered during that day
[1:30:35] i sat down in my van
[1:30:38] i actually texted my pastor
[1:30:41] and said pastor
[1:30:44] i'm not feeling well
[1:30:46] i looked on my phone it ticked twice and
[1:30:49] i realized that he had read the message
[1:30:53] so when i sat down
[1:30:56] i took a little nap
[1:30:58] in the meantime he tried to phone me
[1:31:01] but i didn't hear the phone
[1:31:03] when i woke up
[1:31:06] i checked my phone
[1:31:08] and it was in bold letters
[1:31:12] the message that he sent me said
[1:31:14] i have dealt with the devil
[1:31:17] and his we are done with him
[1:31:20] i said praise god
[1:31:22] the moment i saw that strength came back
[1:31:26] to me
[1:31:29] there was one thing upon my heart
[1:31:34] i said to god
[1:31:37] lord i'm not a cheap person
[1:31:41] the message that i have believed is not
[1:31:43] cheap
[1:31:45] neither are you cheap as well
[1:31:47] i don't want to die
[1:31:49] a cheap person
[1:31:51] make me drive my van
[1:31:54] to the depot and park it
[1:31:56] and when my family comes to reclaim my
[1:31:59] goods
[1:32:00] they can
[1:32:02] find them at one place
[1:32:07] i then
[1:32:09] i think i phoned the pastor i texted
[1:32:11] again
[1:32:12] i said pastor
[1:32:15] i have not told my family the situation
[1:32:18] in which i am
[1:32:20] lest they panic
[1:32:22] this is a discussion between a man to
[1:32:25] man
[1:32:26] the pastor said i'll honor your word
[1:32:32] now
[1:32:33] it was now upon myself
[1:32:36] to drive my van from where i was to the
[1:32:40] depot
[1:32:41] it was just gonna take me 10 minutes
[1:32:44] but that journey took me
[1:32:46] about 40 minutes
[1:32:48] i could not see
[1:32:50] i could even hear
[1:32:52] wands behind me beeping at me because i
[1:32:56] was driving
[1:32:58] a radical
[1:33:01] but then i said lord i said i'm not a
[1:33:04] cheap person let me go and pack my stuff
[1:33:07] and after that
[1:33:09] do as you please
[1:33:13] when i was in that situation
[1:33:16] because the the pain was getting
[1:33:20] worse i said well
[1:33:23] i told the pastor that don't tell my
[1:33:25] family
[1:33:27] but then i said
[1:33:28] i think it's honorable
[1:33:30] for a man
[1:33:32] when you are living this earth
[1:33:35] to speak for the last time to your wife
[1:33:39] i texted her
[1:33:41] but it was during
[1:33:44] a school run
[1:33:46] she couldn't
[1:33:49] see the message
[1:33:52] so after that i was wondering why is did
[1:33:55] she not reply me
[1:33:57] then i phoned
[1:34:00] then i said did you
[1:34:04] my message
[1:34:06] so from the tone
[1:34:08] of my voice she could realize that there
[1:34:11] was something wrong
[1:34:13] she then said okay
[1:34:15] let me cut the phone
[1:34:17] and revisit your message
[1:34:19] my message to you was i'm not feeling
[1:34:22] well
[1:34:25] my pastor had prayed
[1:34:27] then i thought i needed reinforcement
[1:34:31] brother whispers
[1:34:33] spoke to you about brother mike mulotti
[1:34:36] he prays for the sick
[1:34:37] i said to my wife
[1:34:39] can you get in touch with brother mike
[1:34:41] mdot
[1:34:43] to pray for
[1:34:44] me from nowhere the phone to zimbabwe
[1:34:48] was not a problem it was just a one
[1:34:51] click of the button and brother mike
[1:34:53] picked up
[1:34:55] the phone
[1:34:56] and we went into a conference
[1:34:58] call and he said brother steve
[1:35:02] what's wrong
[1:35:03] i said brother i'm not feeling well
[1:35:06] then he said okay let me pray
[1:35:08] he prayed
[1:35:10] after he prayed he said it's done
[1:35:14] i said to myself
[1:35:16] i've heard two powerful prayers
[1:35:19] one from my pastor one from my
[1:35:22] fellow brother and brother mike
[1:35:26] if i'm to go let me go
[1:35:29] on those two prayers to heaven
[1:35:33] this time
[1:35:34] i was no longer fearful
[1:35:38] certain courage came from somewhere
[1:35:41] and i said i'm ready to face my fate
[1:35:46] when i told my wife that then they went
[1:35:49] home
[1:35:51] then they said we need to drive to where
[1:35:55] you are
[1:35:56] to drive to where i was i was 14 miles
[1:35:59] away from them right in central london
[1:36:06] they
[1:36:07] said let's call an ambulance
[1:36:10] they found an ambulance
[1:36:13] as you all know i don't know whether
[1:36:15] this that's the same behavior they have
[1:36:17] they say this is not an emergency yes
[1:36:23] then they said we are not coming
[1:36:26] then my daughter ruth
[1:36:31] righteous indignation came upon me
[1:36:35] then she said what is it that then you
[1:36:37] call emergency
[1:36:40] she grilled here
[1:36:42] them because my wife was
[1:36:45] controlling the car driving
[1:36:48] until then
[1:36:50] until when they said okay
[1:36:51] we'll reconcile that
[1:36:55] they're coming from home coming to my
[1:36:57] workplace
[1:36:58] in the meantime
[1:37:00] the pastor is checking with my wife what
[1:37:03] the situation is because i was no longer
[1:37:05] in a position to speak or answer the
[1:37:08] phone
[1:37:09] when i got to the depot
[1:37:13] when my general manager saw me
[1:37:16] he was taken aback
[1:37:18] when he looked at me he said there's
[1:37:20] something terrible going on what's wrong
[1:37:22] i said i don't know
[1:37:24] he said okay let's call for an ambulance
[1:37:27] they call the ambulance same story they
[1:37:29] were told that's not an emergency case
[1:37:34] then the general manager said
[1:37:38] i am going to take a risk
[1:37:41] if you are to die you're going to die in
[1:37:43] my car
[1:37:45] i'm going to put you into my car
[1:37:48] by then
[1:37:50] i had a stiff neck
[1:37:52] i could not turn i could not bend
[1:37:55] my back as well was stiff
[1:37:59] the only way they could put me in the in
[1:38:02] their car at the back seat
[1:38:04] was to lie me down first
[1:38:06] and they grabbed the head here the legs
[1:38:08] there and they put me through
[1:38:11] the back seat
[1:38:13] in the meantime my wife and my three
[1:38:16] children
[1:38:18] are driving to come to the hospital
[1:38:21] the hospital that
[1:38:23] i was going to go was very near
[1:38:27] it's one of the best hospitals and it's
[1:38:29] called king's college hospital
[1:38:35] i want you to mark my words as i'm
[1:38:37] saying this statement
[1:38:40] as we were driving
[1:38:44] the general manager
[1:38:47] is not asking me
[1:38:50] how are you feeling
[1:38:52] he's saying steve are you still alive
[1:38:56] i was just saying yes
[1:39:01] we drove it was during peak hour a lot
[1:39:04] of traffic was there
[1:39:06] we managed to get to the hospital
[1:39:08] and when we got to the hospital
[1:39:10] you know the state of hospital the
[1:39:13] parking
[1:39:14] you cannot find any parking and if you
[1:39:17] just park your car anyway
[1:39:19] the clumping people just come and clamp
[1:39:20] your car and they take it
[1:39:23] but that manager said
[1:39:25] called the security man and he said i've
[1:39:28] got an image of the case with me
[1:39:30] i'm going to leave my car here if you
[1:39:32] think of towing it up it's entirely up
[1:39:35] to you
[1:39:39] there was we went straight to the a and
[1:39:41] e
[1:39:43] when we got there
[1:39:45] there was a massive queue
[1:39:48] this time they are just holding me
[1:39:51] the other person on this one the
[1:39:53] security men on this one
[1:39:55] they are actually dragging me
[1:39:58] then when we got to the front of the
[1:40:00] queue
[1:40:01] they said we are not going to follow the
[1:40:03] queue we would rather jump the queue
[1:40:06] we asked for permission from a certain
[1:40:08] lady who was in front when she looked at
[1:40:10] me she said please by all means
[1:40:12] get yourself sorry
[1:40:18] that was the assessment
[1:40:19] room where i went first
[1:40:22] in there
[1:40:25] the nurse is communicating
[1:40:27] with the doctors where i'm going to go
[1:40:30] i could not sit
[1:40:32] the only thing i could do was to lie on
[1:40:34] the bench but with i'm lying i'm looking
[1:40:37] direct at a
[1:40:39] to read a bit of a body language
[1:40:42] and to try and understand what they are
[1:40:45] saying because i don't know what was
[1:40:46] upon me
[1:40:50] but
[1:40:51] from the talk that i gathered
[1:40:53] it was an emergency case
[1:40:56] she's looking at me so that
[1:40:59] i cannot hear what she's saying
[1:41:02] she took about four or five minutes
[1:41:05] then after that immediately i was put in
[1:41:07] a wheelchair
[1:41:08] wasted up
[1:41:10] into the first floor
[1:41:12] when i got to the first floor
[1:41:17] on the corner
[1:41:18] i saw a resuscitating machine
[1:41:21] there were about three four nurses there
[1:41:24] and about four or five doctors
[1:41:27] the moment i went in
[1:41:29] it was like they are receiving a parcel
[1:41:32] they thronged me
[1:41:34] put me on the bed
[1:41:36] each one working on this each one
[1:41:37] working on this i was standing right
[1:41:39] left right center
[1:41:41] within a few minutes my whole body had
[1:41:45] all causing
[1:41:46] wires attached and everything
[1:41:49] some are knocking me under my feet with
[1:41:51] a little mallet some are knocking my
[1:41:53] spinal cord so i'm attaining everything
[1:41:56] they were
[1:41:57] just doing the best they could do
[1:42:01] by then i was in such a pain
[1:42:05] i've always said if i was a woman
[1:42:08] i would say the pain that i was going
[1:42:10] through
[1:42:11] was more than the pain of being pregnant
[1:42:15] but i've never been a woman
[1:42:20] our sins i was in such excruciating
[1:42:26] pain my wife
[1:42:29] arrived at the hospital i'm in the
[1:42:31] assessment room there
[1:42:34] and the children as well they've arrived
[1:42:36] there's pandemonium down there
[1:42:39] the children are crying left right
[1:42:41] center they've been told my
[1:42:43] first bone sharon
[1:42:45] has come
[1:42:47] my other daughter sonia was still at a
[1:42:49] house
[1:42:50] they are there
[1:42:52] they are crying
[1:42:58] let me say
[1:43:00] my wife is a woman who normally breaks
[1:43:03] easily
[1:43:05] you could be seated in the
[1:43:07] sitting room maybe
[1:43:09] watching something or if
[1:43:11] say an advert appears on the telly of
[1:43:15] children who are suffering you'll see a
[1:43:17] cry
[1:43:20] sometimes i want to say don't embarrass
[1:43:22] us
[1:43:24] but i know she's a weaker vessel
[1:43:27] my wife she easily cries
[1:43:30] that sometimes even the children say
[1:43:32] mama you cry a lot
[1:43:35] but that day
[1:43:37] when the children were crying
[1:43:40] she had the audacity and power to say
[1:43:43] this is not the time to cry
[1:43:47] [Applause]
[1:43:50] if you want to cry you go out of the
[1:43:52] hospital and you stay there
[1:43:55] i don't want anyone who is going to cry
[1:43:57] here
[1:44:00] this is a hearsay because i'm in my own
[1:44:03] world
[1:44:08] my other name is miranda it means
[1:44:11] comfort
[1:44:14] in short she calls me munya
[1:44:20] so when i was
[1:44:21] there
[1:44:22] when she came
[1:44:24] she came she brought a big pillow fire
[1:44:28] and a small one
[1:44:33] then she said
[1:44:36] i might have run ahead but i want you to
[1:44:38] catch this
[1:44:41] then she said she pronounced
[1:44:45] because me
[1:44:47] i had purpose to say that this is the
[1:44:48] end of my journey
[1:44:51] but when she stood she's saying
[1:44:53] munya you are not going anywhere
[1:44:58] i refuse
[1:45:00] you are not going anywhere
[1:45:04] god will grant you the desires of your
[1:45:06] heart
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:12] in the
[1:45:13] observation room i don't know how she
[1:45:15] sneaked in
[1:45:17] during that time it was the time of
[1:45:19] covid
[1:45:20] but she sneaked in
[1:45:22] right she's on the corner
[1:45:24] time is gone maybe it's around 12
[1:45:26] midnight
[1:45:27] the doctors are still working on me
[1:45:31] then after a while
[1:45:33] then she said when are you going to
[1:45:35] finish
[1:45:36] and everybody turned to say we have
[1:45:39] a visitor in here say what are you doing
[1:45:41] here he says i am the husband of that
[1:45:43] man says you're not even supposed to be
[1:45:45] here then she said well i'm in already.
[1:45:53] my
[1:45:55] my brother my sister
[1:45:58] marriage comes from god
[1:46:00] it's a divine thing
[1:46:03] the wife that we have
[1:46:05] is your perfect rib
[1:46:07] she is the one that will stand with you
[1:46:09] through thick and thin
[1:46:13] when they've
[1:46:15] took me down
[1:46:17] me i was now in my own world
[1:46:20] from the first floor they are now taking
[1:46:22] me
[1:46:23] to the ward
[1:46:29] that way i met
[1:46:31] my children
[1:46:34] but in a strange way this is a reported
[1:46:37] speech
[1:46:38] this is what they told me
[1:46:40] i started to
[1:46:42] say to every child
[1:46:44] goodbye
[1:46:47] i'm going
[1:46:50] then instead of facing them i gave them
[1:46:52] my back
[1:46:53] maybe it was a sign that i didn't want
[1:46:55] them to realize the pain i was going
[1:46:57] through
[1:47:00] so we went into the
[1:47:02] into my
[1:47:04] ward room
[1:47:06] then when we got in there
[1:47:10] my wife took the pillow fire she said
[1:47:13] she said she whispered to me say i've
[1:47:16] brought
[1:47:17] the prayer cloth
[1:47:19] and the pillow fire big one and small
[1:47:21] one
[1:47:22] then when we were in there we have
[1:47:25] another big testimony of about oh for
[1:47:28] brother gerald gondora
[1:47:30] i think most of you might know it
[1:47:33] he was delivered out of corvid when he
[1:47:35] had went into intensive care
[1:47:38] where we thought it was a point of no
[1:47:41] return
[1:47:43] then my wife said
[1:47:45] the god who yielded brother gerald
[1:47:47] gondora
[1:47:49] is the same god that is going to heal
[1:47:52] you
[1:47:56] she is talking to somebody who is
[1:47:59] half the half away
[1:48:04] the doctors then came
[1:48:07] then they said
[1:48:10] we don't know how your husband has
[1:48:12] managed to survive
[1:48:16] your husband is acute meningitis
[1:48:23] the bacteria was already surrounding my
[1:48:26] brain membrane
[1:48:28] ready to pounce on the brain
[1:48:31] they said if i delayed
[1:48:34] by just five minutes
[1:48:36] that was the end of me
[1:48:40] they said they were also amazed
[1:48:43] to see
[1:48:45] how i was reciprocating
[1:48:47] to the medication that they had given me
[1:48:51] they put
[1:48:52] about three on this side three on this
[1:48:54] side antibiotics and everything they
[1:48:57] wanted to make sure
[1:48:59] that this was
[1:49:02] meningitis
[1:49:05] when they were satisfied
[1:49:09] they asked me
[1:49:10] have you been to africa i said no have
[1:49:14] you been to this place i said no
[1:49:16] how come then you contacted this i said
[1:49:18] i don't even know
[1:49:24] when we went into my
[1:49:26] room my wife took the small pillow fire
[1:49:31] she put it on my headboard
[1:49:33] the big one she was holding it
[1:49:39] and
[1:49:41] the dosage that i was being given to his
[1:49:44] pain was morphine
[1:49:47] they were giving me morphine
[1:49:50] but it was not helping
[1:49:54] i don't know how i can explain the pain
[1:49:56] that i went through
[1:50:00] but then something within me deep inside
[1:50:03] of me
[1:50:05] was telling me all is well
[1:50:11] i remember my wife
[1:50:13] when she came
[1:50:15] she started to sing
[1:50:17] a song
[1:50:19] what was the song
[1:50:23] the great physician is here
[1:50:26] out of my conscious
[1:50:30] she said i started to sing as well
[1:50:35] the great physician is here
[1:50:39] for sure the great physician was there
[1:50:44] i am in there
[1:50:46] they are coming the doctors are coming
[1:50:48] in and checking on me
[1:50:55] now
[1:50:56] where we i am going to go now
[1:50:59] is where
[1:51:01] possibly most of you are going to be
[1:51:02] helped
[1:51:07] i went into hospital on the 17th of june
[1:51:11] the morning
[1:51:13] of the 18th
[1:51:16] i went into deep sleep
[1:51:24] signs of god
[1:51:27] what i am telling you
[1:51:30] is sure as i'm holding my bible
[1:51:33] is what transpired in my life
[1:51:40] when i went into that deep sleep
[1:51:46] i saw a chariot
[1:52:06] a chariot with three angels
[1:52:19] always when i get to this part
[1:52:25] it's so direct to me
[1:52:32] i'll say it anyhow
[1:52:36] one was in front
[1:52:38] the other one
[1:52:40] on the right the other one on the left
[1:52:44] with a buggy
[1:52:50] they did not speak to me
[1:52:54] all they did was
[1:52:56] they came direct to me
[1:53:00] you don't even say if you come for me
[1:53:03] because i knew they had come for me
[1:53:10] they opened the door the doors were
[1:53:12] opening from outside
[1:53:15] the other one is in front the other one
[1:53:17] is on the left and the other one is on
[1:53:18] the right
[1:53:19] so the one on the right opened the doors
[1:53:22] of the chariot for me
[1:53:24] they gave me a robe
[1:53:26] pure white robe
[1:53:29] they dressed me
[1:53:31] they ushered me
[1:53:35] i don't think
[1:53:37] the respect of the politicians of this
[1:53:40] country
[1:53:43] to the president of this country
[1:53:46] i can't equate it with that
[1:53:48] because i was
[1:53:50] treated as a royal
[1:53:55] when they opened the doors for me
[1:53:58] there's no conversation
[1:54:01] they ushered me
[1:54:03] i went in
[1:54:05] i sat in the middle
[1:54:08] one angel on my left
[1:54:10] the other one on my right
[1:54:13] the one in front of me
[1:54:15] was now leading us
[1:54:18] and we started to take off
[1:54:21] it was a journey
[1:54:25] close to thee
[1:54:27] started to be sad
[1:54:30] it started to be sung
[1:54:33] and we were going
[1:54:36] and we were going
[1:54:38] the tunnel in which we were
[1:54:41] going
[1:54:42] was so bright
[1:54:45] it was like a galaxies of stars and
[1:54:48] together with the sun you could pick a
[1:54:51] needle from the end of that building
[1:54:54] from it was so crystal clear
[1:55:00] i could hear another tunnel which was so
[1:55:03] dark i could hear screams there
[1:55:09] when i looked on the sides
[1:55:12] of the tunnel
[1:55:15] saints listen to this the messages
[1:55:20] that my pastors preached
[1:55:23] were clearly written in bold
[1:55:26] red and their deaths were there
[1:55:29] the messages that i have listened of the
[1:55:31] prophets
[1:55:32] they were surrounding me
[1:55:35] the little messages
[1:55:36] that i have preached myself they were
[1:55:38] going there
[1:55:41] i was being encamped encompassed
[1:55:44] by the word
[1:55:49] i said my
[1:55:52] joy filled my heart
[1:55:56] and we were going
[1:55:58] close to thee was being signed
[1:56:01] close to b was being being sung
[1:56:05] i'm sure the majority of you have been
[1:56:07] in trains
[1:56:08] in a train
[1:56:10] you know when a train is about to stop
[1:56:13] there is this tweaking sound of breaks
[1:56:17] that's exactly what happened
[1:56:20] but i want to tell you it was a journey
[1:56:23] when we arrived
[1:56:27] the brakes started to squeak
[1:56:31] and when we arrived
[1:56:35] the angels
[1:56:36] came down
[1:56:38] all
[1:56:40] all three the one in front this one he
[1:56:43] opened this door and he stood there this
[1:56:45] one opened the door for me
[1:56:48] and i came out like a dignitary
[1:56:51] patterned up myself like you know when
[1:56:54] you're being
[1:56:56] ushered out
[1:56:57] and when i stepped out
[1:57:01] my brother my sister
[1:57:04] this message that we have believed
[1:57:07] is taking us to heaven
[1:57:10] when i got there
[1:57:14] i've never seen a beautiful place in my
[1:57:17] life
[1:57:19] right now
[1:57:20] maybe it's limited to my vocabulary i
[1:57:23] cannot even describe it
[1:57:26] it only takes you
[1:57:28] as an individual to go and see for
[1:57:31] yourself
[1:57:33] when i stepped out
[1:57:37] i i was welcomed like
[1:57:40] with about say a stadium four stadiums
[1:57:43] of people
[1:57:45] each stadium possibly a hundred thousand
[1:57:47] of people
[1:57:49] what they did is when i stepped out they
[1:57:51] started to utilize and they their hands
[1:57:54] were going up in air they were singing
[1:57:57] rejoicing saying welcome welcome welcome
[1:58:02] by then i had there was peace within me
[1:58:06] there was peace within me
[1:58:10] then i started to walk
[1:58:13] towards the big entrance
[1:58:16] when i walked
[1:58:18] there there was an age
[1:58:22] for me to look back
[1:58:27] i took two steps
[1:58:29] i was left with one step
[1:58:32] to enter into glory
[1:58:35] i looked back
[1:58:38] then i saw a vision of my wife
[1:58:42] my son isaac
[1:58:45] my daughter faith
[1:58:48] and my other daughter ruth
[1:58:50] they were looking at me
[1:58:55] they were not complaining
[1:58:57] but it was like
[1:58:59] are you sure you're going
[1:59:03] then i stopped
[1:59:07] get me clear
[1:59:09] i did not see god
[1:59:12] it was just a voice coming
[1:59:16] so
[1:59:19] brother when he says god design yours it
[1:59:21] is true
[1:59:24] there was an age in me that said it
[1:59:26] seems as if you've got something to say
[1:59:29] i said yes
[1:59:32] i said lord
[1:59:35] can you give me another chance
[1:59:41] i need
[1:59:43] to go back and see my children grow
[1:59:49] the reply was
[1:59:51] your word is honored
[1:59:57] i turned back
[2:00:00] into the same bag
[2:00:03] the angels opened the doors for me
[2:00:06] i stepped in
[2:00:09] close to the
[2:00:11] started to sing again
[2:00:13] it was a journey
[2:00:16] send messages
[2:00:19] in bold red
[2:00:21] and their dates
[2:00:24] sons of god
[2:00:26] these ministers
[2:00:29] when they stand to minister here
[2:00:32] when they stand to minister
[2:00:35] catch the revelation
[2:00:38] that's the word that has been ordained
[2:00:41] to take you into glory land
[2:00:45] we came back to earth
[2:00:50] then i woke up at 2 am
[2:00:55] 2 am was the same
[2:00:57] time when the nurses would come in and
[2:01:01] change the drips
[2:01:05] my whole body was wet
[2:01:08] where i was sleeping it was wet
[2:01:13] i sat on the edge of the bed
[2:01:16] and when the nurse came in
[2:01:18] said this is time to change your
[2:01:19] medication
[2:01:21] took the bp machine to take me
[2:01:24] the machine read zero
[2:01:28] she took the thermometer to check my
[2:01:31] temperature it read zero
[2:01:35] she started to panic
[2:01:37] she said i'm going to get two liters of
[2:01:39] water i want you to drink water right
[2:01:42] now
[2:01:42] i said why
[2:01:44] says
[2:01:45] there's something wrong with you
[2:01:47] there's nothing responding within you
[2:01:53] me i'm
[2:01:54] always
[2:01:56] wait and i'm sitting on the edge i said
[2:01:58] no don't worry i'm okay it says no way
[2:02:01] she almost hit the panic button so that
[2:02:03] other nurses will come in
[2:02:06] she's running she for the second time
[2:02:09] the machine were not working
[2:02:12] then
[2:02:13] i had gathered a little bit of
[2:02:15] myself
[2:02:17] then i said
[2:02:19] can you go and change that machine
[2:02:22] she said i cannot change it it's working
[2:02:24] i'm just coming out of the other patient
[2:02:27] that's the same machine i used in this
[2:02:29] way i said listen to me please just go
[2:02:32] and change the machine
[2:02:34] then out of nowhere she went and she
[2:02:36] changed the machine she came back she
[2:02:38] put it on me
[2:02:41] started to work
[2:02:44] she looked at me
[2:02:48] she said
[2:02:49] i don't know what i can say
[2:02:51] i said what's wrong
[2:02:53] she said you don't know
[2:02:54] if a patient dies during your
[2:02:57] duty
[2:02:58] you have no explanation
[2:03:01] you didn't have any temperature you
[2:03:03] didn't have any
[2:03:04] blood readings
[2:03:07] i said
[2:03:08] don't worry if i explain to you you
[2:03:10] won't understand
[2:03:13] that was that
[2:03:18] during that morning to a morning
[2:03:21] my room was had some kind of a glass
[2:03:24] mirror
[2:03:26] where
[2:03:27] the nurse would come and peep whether
[2:03:29] the person is
[2:03:30] okay that night that nurse never slept
[2:03:35] all she was doing was i could see it she
[2:03:37] would come on that small window and
[2:03:39] shoot with it he would look at me then i
[2:03:41] would wave back at you and say no no
[2:03:43] everything is all right
[2:03:53] in the
[2:03:54] morning
[2:03:56] the visiting time was 2 to 8 pm 2 pm to
[2:04:00] 8 pm
[2:04:01] but my wife would come even at 8 and 10
[2:04:04] and she would just walk in
[2:04:06] defy everybody and she would stand there
[2:04:09] she's there
[2:04:11] seated there
[2:04:13] and me possibly i'm unconscious and i'm
[2:04:15] sleeping like that
[2:04:17] the pill of fire is there
[2:04:21] i then started to gain myself back
[2:04:26] myself gradually
[2:04:29] and gradually
[2:04:32] one morning
[2:04:34] my wife had visited me
[2:04:37] a certainness came in
[2:04:41] she said
[2:04:43] wow
[2:04:45] what's wrong with this room
[2:04:48] we thought maybe we'd done something
[2:04:51] i said nothing
[2:04:52] said no way
[2:04:55] i've never felt peace
[2:05:00] peace and tranquility of all the words
[2:05:04] the atmosphere in this room
[2:05:08] is different i would rather resort
[2:05:11] myself to work in this room than any
[2:05:13] other world
[2:05:15] amen
[2:05:18] i said to myself
[2:05:21] praise god
[2:05:24] another lady came in
[2:05:26] she saw the pillow fire
[2:05:28] she asked my wife
[2:05:31] what is that they were asking about the
[2:05:33] prophet who is that
[2:05:34] we're saying that's our prophet
[2:05:37] what's that is the pillar of fire
[2:05:39] then the other lady said is it the same
[2:05:40] pill of fire that led the children of
[2:05:42] israel out of egypt my wife said yes
[2:05:45] says i'm not going to touch it i respect
[2:05:47] it very much
[2:05:50] when this first lady said there's peace
[2:05:52] in this room then i said lord
[2:05:55] i want a confirmation
[2:05:57] let somebody come in as well and say the
[2:05:59] same
[2:06:01] for sure
[2:06:03] another nurse came in the following day
[2:06:05] and she said there's something peculiar
[2:06:07] about this room
[2:06:09] this in this room there is peace
[2:06:12] there is such an atmosphere what is it
[2:06:15] i said we are children of god
[2:06:19] now every morning there was a
[2:06:21] pandemonium outside
[2:06:23] they would usually come the two of them
[2:06:26] one on this side of the bed the other
[2:06:28] one behind helping each other to spread
[2:06:31] but the one who comes in
[2:06:33] would tell the one who was going to help
[2:06:35] you say don't worry don't come
[2:06:37] i'll manage the bed on my own
[2:06:41] i just saw the hand of god
[2:06:43] i just saw the hand of god
[2:06:47] and after that
[2:06:50] then
[2:06:51] there was satan started to try to stand
[2:06:54] in our way
[2:06:56] there was
[2:06:57] a
[2:06:58] some blood
[2:06:59] samples that had been taken
[2:07:01] and the results were not even coming
[2:07:04] the rest were coming but that one only
[2:07:07] it took almost about maybe seven days
[2:07:10] then the it came
[2:07:13] but during my stay in there
[2:07:18] i'm just sitting with my wife where
[2:07:20] remember the doctors that said this was
[2:07:22] a contagious
[2:07:24] disease but it was only thursday
[2:07:29] and i'm sitting there i'm talking to my
[2:07:31] wife
[2:07:33] whom do i see
[2:07:35] i saw a tall man
[2:07:37] coming into my wood
[2:07:42] and the tall man was none other than
[2:07:43] brother whisper man
[2:07:46] i said brother why did you bother to
[2:07:48] come i'm now okay we could talk over the
[2:07:50] phone says no that's my responsibility
[2:07:54] i'm here for you my brother
[2:07:57] what he did is then he took his bible
[2:08:00] after
[2:08:01] some fellowship he opened isaiah 54
[2:08:05] in psalms 118
[2:08:07] for me
[2:08:08] and he already laid his end up on me
[2:08:11] and i could feel that it was insafians
[2:08:15] i'm not saying he does it only for me
[2:08:18] he does it for every
[2:08:20] ship but i'm just trying to emphasize
[2:08:23] the point remember he's a man who is
[2:08:25] used to driving
[2:08:27] but that time you took
[2:08:29] a train
[2:08:30] from where for me to drive to his place
[2:08:32] i need about one
[2:08:34] hour but it took a train to come down
[2:08:38] and when he was actually going he was
[2:08:40] actually asking my wife where do i
[2:08:42] connect this train this and that
[2:08:44] i said lord
[2:08:46] bless this man of god amen amen
[2:08:49] for the labors that he does for us
[2:08:55] i want to thank
[2:08:57] god for what
[2:08:58] he made me to pass through
[2:09:01] i want to thank my pastor
[2:09:04] for standing with me
[2:09:06] i want to thank him and his wife
[2:09:09] i want to thank my wife
[2:09:12] who declared
[2:09:14] that you steve you are not going
[2:09:16] anywhere
[2:09:19] i want to thank god for honoring
[2:09:22] my way to say lord
[2:09:25] yet another time
[2:09:27] i want to see my children grow up
[2:09:30] and he has granted me that
[2:09:34] the reason why i have shared you shared
[2:09:36] with you this testimony
[2:09:38] is maybe
[2:09:40] there was somebody
[2:09:43] who is fearing
[2:09:45] or somebody
[2:09:46] who is just about to let go
[2:09:49] don't let go
[2:09:51] god is still business with you
[2:09:54] with that
[2:09:55] little testimony
[2:09:58] i'll say god bless you so much
[2:10:01] amen

[2:41:23] thy god is with thee
[2:41:26] where's whether so ever thou goest
[2:41:29] with the comfort of this creature my
[2:41:31] brother my sister
[2:41:33] with the comfort of this scripture
[2:41:35] is telling you
[2:41:37] be strong and of good courage
[2:41:40] that's a simple requirement for me god
[2:41:42] is asking
[2:41:43] and he's saying my daughter my son
[2:41:46] be not afraid
[2:41:49] no be dismayed
[2:41:51] when a little thing happens in your life
[2:41:54] you grow along first

[2:42:20] lord i will join with you as i
[2:42:23] will go for yours hallelujah

[2:42:32] we that so ever thou goest
[2:42:36] if you are in a plane
[2:42:39] you know when we come i'm one person
[2:42:42] who is afraid when the airplane is just
[2:42:44] about to land
[2:42:46] and if ever there's one person who prays
[2:42:48] it's me
[2:42:49] during that time
[2:42:51] i i think i shared that with brother
[2:42:53] joseph as well
[2:42:56] because when it lets an aeroplane does
[2:42:58] not land on his
[2:43:00] two wheels straight away it goes through
[2:43:02] then it goes like that so in my mind i'm
[2:43:05] always thinking if it does that then
[2:43:06] it's going the other way
[2:43:08] so when it's landing
[2:43:10] i always look down and say lord
[2:43:13] you have been the pilot
[2:43:14] you have been the engineer you are
[2:43:16] saving us food here
[2:43:18] for the sake of the philistines
