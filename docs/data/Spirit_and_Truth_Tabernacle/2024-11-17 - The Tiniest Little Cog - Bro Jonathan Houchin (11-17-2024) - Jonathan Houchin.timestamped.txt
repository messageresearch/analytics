[1:09:48] that all right our victories are coming

[1:10:34] sermon I want to just say to brother
[1:10:37] Jack thank you for having me it's always
[1:10:41] such a privilege to stand in front of
[1:10:42] you people Glory GL the relationship
[1:10:45] that me and brother Jack have developed
[1:10:48] over the last few years it
[1:10:51] just it's just the Lord am that's all I
[1:10:54] can say it's just the Lord that
[1:10:56] relationship the relationship I've I've
[1:10:58] developed with with this
[1:11:00] church and um I tell you what if we
[1:11:03] could turn to
[1:11:05] Romans 8 we're going to read 26 to 30
[1:11:08] we're going to read a little bit of the
[1:11:10] scripture while you're
[1:11:13] turning brother brother Jack had
[1:11:16] mentioned that I'm from
[1:11:18] Jeffersonville which I think most of you
[1:11:21] know it's always
[1:11:23] interesting when you
[1:11:30] tell somebody if you're from
[1:11:31] Jeffersonville the different responses
[1:11:34] that you'll get from different people
[1:11:35] yes sir and
[1:11:38] uh some
[1:11:40] people you know they really want to come
[1:11:42] to Jeffersonville they want to they want
[1:11:43] to see see the sight see the see the
[1:11:45] different things and other people will
[1:11:47] almost turn their nose up to you like
[1:11:49] you think you're something just because
[1:11:50] you're from
[1:11:51] Jeffersonville and it's just it's it's
[1:11:53] interesting but we have we had a family
[1:11:56] um about a month or so ago that they
[1:11:59] were wanting to come to Jeffersonville
[1:12:00] they hadn't been there in more than 30
[1:12:02] years and I asked them I said uh you
[1:12:05] know do you want me to take take you
[1:12:06] around to just some of the sites and you
[1:12:08] know maybe see if I can get us into the
[1:12:09] Tabernacle to to to you know uh look
[1:12:13] around and uh so they were like yeah
[1:12:16] that would be
[1:12:17] great so one of the places that I took
[1:12:19] them was to um the candy store shimps
[1:12:23] yes sir I'm sure most of you are
[1:12:25] familiar with
[1:12:26] shimps and as I was walking around there
[1:12:29] and I was kind of letting them do their
[1:12:30] thing and I walked into the back and in
[1:12:33] the back they've got like this room set
[1:12:34] up and it's it's just um it's got a
[1:12:39] bunch of artifacts in it just from that
[1:12:41] area from the the years that have passed
[1:12:44] how long that candy store has been there
[1:12:46] and as I was looking around and I was
[1:12:47] thinking you know because it's it's it's
[1:12:49] a museum basically is what it is and I
[1:12:52] started thinking
[1:12:55] that that's what the message has become
[1:12:56] to so many people it's become a museum
[1:13:00] right just full of artifacts all right
[1:13:03] and I started thinking I was so thankful
[1:13:06] to the Lord that he gave me eyes to see
[1:13:10] that this message was more than just a
[1:13:12] candy store right it was more than just
[1:13:14] a building at aan Pin all right it was
[1:13:17] more than just a bubbling brook all
[1:13:19] right he gave me the eyes to see that
[1:13:21] this message was Jesus Christ revealed
[1:13:23] to us I was so thankful for that
[1:13:27] glory amen what a message we have that's
[1:13:30] right brother that's right amen Romans
[1:13:33] 8:26
[1:13:37] to30 likewise the spirit also help
[1:13:40] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[1:13:42] what we should pray for as we ought but
[1:13:46] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[1:13:48] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:13:50] uttered and he that searches the heart
[1:13:53] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:13:56] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:13:58] Saints according to the will of God and
[1:14:01] we know that all things work together
[1:14:04] for good to them that love God to them
[1:14:07] who are the called according to his
[1:14:09] purpose for whom he did Forno he also
[1:14:13] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:14:16] image of his son that he might be the
[1:14:19] first born among many Brethren moreover
[1:14:24] whom he did pre predestinate them he
[1:14:26] also called and whom he called them he
[1:14:30] also Justified and whom he justified
[1:14:34] them he also glorified I'd also like for
[1:14:37] you to turn to John 16 we're going to
[1:14:39] read 23 and 24
[1:14:57] John 16:23 and 24 and in that day we
[1:15:01] shall ask ye shall ask me nothing verily
[1:15:04] verily I say unto you whatsoever ye
[1:15:06] shall ask the father in my name he will
[1:15:09] give it you whether to have ye asked
[1:15:13] nothing in my name ask and ye shall
[1:15:16] receive that your joy may be
[1:15:19] full we're going to turn to one more
[1:15:21] place we're going to read Mark 9 20 to
[1:15:41] 27 Mark 9:20 to
[1:15:45] 27 Lord and they besought him and they
[1:15:48] besought him unto him and when he saw
[1:15:51] him straightway the spirit tear him and
[1:15:55] he fell on the ground and wallowed
[1:15:57] foaming and he asked his father how long
[1:16:00] is it ago since this Came Upon came unto
[1:16:04] him and he said of a child and often
[1:16:07] oftimes it hath cast him into the fire
[1:16:09] and into the waters to destroy him but
[1:16:13] if thou can't do anything have
[1:16:16] compassion on us and help us Jesus said
[1:16:19] unto him if thou cast believe all things
[1:16:24] are possible to him that believeth and
[1:16:27] straight way the father of the the
[1:16:29] father of the child cried out and said
[1:16:32] with tears Lord I believe help thou mine
[1:16:35] unbelief when Jesus saw the people came
[1:16:38] running together he rebuked the foul
[1:16:41] Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and
[1:16:43] deaf spirit I charge thee come out of
[1:16:46] him and enter no more into him and the
[1:16:49] spirit cried and rent him sore and came
[1:16:52] out of him and he was as one dead in so
[1:16:56] much that many said he is dead but Jesus
[1:16:59] took him by the hand and lifted him up
[1:17:02] and he
[1:17:04] arose let's pray dear heavenly father
[1:17:07] Lord as we're gathered into this this
[1:17:09] building once again
[1:17:11] father Lord as we're relying not upon a
[1:17:14] man but we're relying upon your promise
[1:17:17] that you would be here father Lord I
[1:17:19] just pray father that even now you would
[1:17:21] just take every spirit in this building
[1:17:23] under your control father Lord if there
[1:17:25] be any unbelief or or doubt father I
[1:17:28] pray that you would just move it out of
[1:17:30] the way Lord Lord as I heard your
[1:17:32] Prophet this morning saying how we can't
[1:17:34] help but those doubting spirits to to to
[1:17:38] enter into our mind but as the farmer
[1:17:40] said I've got a double double barrel
[1:17:43] shotgun that can keep him from roosting
[1:17:45] father father I pray that we bring out
[1:17:48] those double barrel shotguns those
[1:17:49] spiritual ones this morning Father Lord
[1:17:52] if there be any doubt father I pray that
[1:17:53] we empty both barrels into them right
[1:17:56] here now father may may there be nothing
[1:17:58] that hinders this service father Lord
[1:18:00] may your will be done father as my
[1:18:02] brother was praying may you help me
[1:18:04] Father get myself completely out of the
[1:18:06] way that you can take complete control
[1:18:08] father May everything that's said and
[1:18:10] done be pleasing to you father may it be
[1:18:12] in your perfect will Lord May our eyes
[1:18:15] stay fixed upon Calvary father Lord we
[1:18:18] thank you and we love you for all that
[1:18:19] you do in Jesus Christ I pray amen
[1:18:23] amen you can be seated thank
[1:18:36] you so my my sermon title this
[1:18:40] morning is the tiniest
[1:18:43] Cog and uh I know brother Bram talked
[1:18:47] about the cogs and how when they line up
[1:18:51] you know things have got to happen right
[1:18:54] and I want to take this thought about
[1:18:56] these cogs and I'm going to let's go a
[1:18:57] little little deeper with
[1:19:00] them and uh I'm going to start off by
[1:19:03] telling you the way a watch
[1:19:06] works so I was Sarah and I was walking
[1:19:09] around uh Downtown Disney this has
[1:19:12] actually been I don't know what six
[1:19:13] months ago or so and uh we were here
[1:19:18] um what way were you here for the night
[1:19:21] of worship and um yes and so so we were
[1:19:24] walking around and I walk into a a watch
[1:19:26] place there and uh I told the the the
[1:19:30] there was a lady standing there I told
[1:19:31] her I said I want somebody that can talk
[1:19:33] to me about how a watch works and I want
[1:19:35] to know every detail about it and just
[1:19:38] as I said that this man walks out and
[1:19:40] she looks and she said this is your man
[1:19:42] right here and and so she's explaining
[1:19:45] to him what I'm looking for and he was
[1:19:46] like oh you've come to the right place
[1:19:48] you know I love to talk about watches
[1:19:51] all right and so as he starts to tell me
[1:19:52] and you know and he starts talking and
[1:19:54] I'm just just W just taking in what he's
[1:19:56] saying you
[1:19:57] know but the way a watch works so
[1:20:01] there's different cogs or some call gear
[1:20:05] some some may call them gears gears cogs
[1:20:07] same thing brother Bram referred to them
[1:20:09] as cogs some people will call them gears
[1:20:11] so we're going to say cogs so the a
[1:20:14] watch is made up of different cogs some
[1:20:17] are small some are medium some are
[1:20:20] large they all have these little teeth
[1:20:22] on them and they they enter lock and the
[1:20:26] smallest Cog can make a medium Cog move
[1:20:30] which can make the larger Cog move a
[1:20:33] tiny little Cog can turn and make that
[1:20:37] larger Cog move that's how they're
[1:20:39] designed okay
[1:20:42] now the main Cog is always the biggest
[1:20:46] Cog in the watch that's the one that
[1:20:48] actually controls it keeps the time it
[1:20:51] it's what controls the watch okay it
[1:20:55] cannot do
[1:20:56] anything until that smaller Cog starts
[1:21:00] to move so nothing will happen in that
[1:21:04] watch unless that smaller Cog it can be
[1:21:07] the tiniest Cog but until that tiny Cog
[1:21:10] starts to move the main Cog can't do
[1:21:15] anything
[1:21:17] God now these time pieces this was very
[1:21:20] interesting these time pieces were
[1:21:23] originally made for ship
[1:21:26] okay now as a ship is traveling and it
[1:21:29] has a
[1:21:30] direction and they know how fast they're
[1:21:34] going they have to watch this time piece
[1:21:38] because once they hit a certain time
[1:21:41] they have to know to turn they've got to
[1:21:44] know which direction they're going and
[1:21:46] they've got to turn at that specific
[1:21:49] moment brother amen if they don't turn
[1:21:53] at that specific moment right they could
[1:21:56] be lost at sea forever this happened
[1:21:59] multiple times ships would miss the
[1:22:02] moment in which they were supposed to
[1:22:04] turn and because they would miss that
[1:22:06] moment the place that they were
[1:22:08] traveling to they would miss that just
[1:22:11] missed it by maybe a minute but by the
[1:22:13] time they were supposed to reach the
[1:22:15] destination they were so far off wow
[1:22:18] that they would never be found they
[1:22:20] couldn't find land wow wow come on now
[1:22:24] and one more
[1:22:27] thing a watch in order for the tiny Cog
[1:22:32] to start moving a watch has to be
[1:22:36] wound now in the old days watches that
[1:22:39] were wound you would pull out a little
[1:22:41] stem and turn it turn it turn it turn it
[1:22:42] turn it until it tightened up and push
[1:22:43] it back in now the watch is wound newer
[1:22:46] watches though is just the movement of
[1:22:49] your arm will wind the watch every time
[1:22:52] I move my hand it's winding my watch
[1:22:57] okay all right so we we we're we're good
[1:23:00] on how a watch works right okay on so
[1:23:02] I'm I'm GNA tell you one more thing I'm
[1:23:04] just kind of laying a foundation here
[1:23:06] for you so I'm a I'm a numbers guy I
[1:23:08] don't know if I've ever told you that I
[1:23:10] love messing with numbers and so we know
[1:23:13] that the scripture tells us one day is
[1:23:16] like a thousand years yes with the Lord
[1:23:19] right okay so I started taking that down
[1:23:22] that that that those those two those two
[1:23:25] days and the years and I wanted to break
[1:23:27] them
[1:23:28] down and so as I broke them down down
[1:23:31] down down down down down I came up
[1:23:33] with 90
[1:23:36] seconds is like one
[1:23:39] year right 33 seconds is a day
[1:23:45] wow so Noah's 120 years sermon that he
[1:23:49] preached was three hours all right
[1:23:53] Abraham 25 years he waited on a son that
[1:23:57] was only 42 minutes to god wow Daniel's
[1:24:01] 20 21 days when he cried out for the
[1:24:04] Lord and had to wait 21 days for the
[1:24:07] angel that was 7
[1:24:09] seconds so why am I telling you that
[1:24:13] because if a miracle happens if your
[1:24:17] Victory is today sir if it's right now
[1:24:21] he's got to start moving before you ever
[1:24:24] get out of your seat he's got to start
[1:24:27] doing something before you ever think
[1:24:30] about
[1:24:32] it Isaiah
[1:24:34] 65:24 and it shall come to pass that
[1:24:37] before they call I will answer and while
[1:24:42] they are yet speaking I will hear yes
[1:24:46] praise God amen
[1:24:48] glory
[1:24:50] okay so now let's get
[1:24:53] started Mark 9:22 I'm going to go back
[1:24:56] to that that story okay all right now
[1:24:58] this is Jesus has come up on this this
[1:25:00] scene here this child is is is possessed
[1:25:05] his father's standing there he's asking
[1:25:08] you know Jesus has asked how how often
[1:25:10] does this happen he's starting to talk
[1:25:12] to this man my God's starting to talk to
[1:25:15] him the man tells him it happens often
[1:25:18] he tries to throw this the spirit tries
[1:25:21] to throw him into the fire tries to
[1:25:22] throw him into the water it's trying to
[1:25:24] kill him wow and the man looks at Jesus
[1:25:28] and he says but if but if thou can't do
[1:25:34] anything right have compassion on us
[1:25:37] amen if see the Cog that tiny Cog was
[1:25:42] standing still wow if amen you can do
[1:25:46] this for me amen amen but Jesus looked
[1:25:50] back at him and I loved his response
[1:25:53] because he responded the same way
[1:25:57] if if thou can't
[1:26:00] believe all things are possible to him
[1:26:04] that believe what was he doing there he
[1:26:07] was starting to wind that watch he was
[1:26:10] starting to wind it up because the next
[1:26:13] thing out of that man's mouth with tears
[1:26:16] in his eyes it said he straight way said
[1:26:20] I believe amen help my unbelief
[1:26:24] now the tiny Cog started to move now it
[1:26:28] started to make that main Cog start
[1:26:32] turning and Christ was able to cast that
[1:26:35] Spirit out of that child because the
[1:26:37] tiny Cog had started to
[1:26:40] move praise
[1:26:42] God yes sir we find in Mark
[1:26:46] 9:24 there's a pool there called
[1:26:50] Bethesda right and there was a man that
[1:26:52] had been sitting there for 38 years I
[1:26:54] believe it was that was crippled and as
[1:26:57] Jesus walked up on this scene yes sir
[1:27:00] all these other people around he stepped
[1:27:04] over every one of them and came to that
[1:27:06] one
[1:27:07] man Victory Day was coming that
[1:27:10] day it was coming that day
[1:27:13] Hallelujah as he stepped over to that to
[1:27:15] that man and he asked him will thou be
[1:27:18] made whole God and the man starts to say
[1:27:21] I can't get to the pool he's telling him
[1:27:23] I can't get to the pool there's too many
[1:27:25] people my legs they don't work I can't
[1:27:28] get
[1:27:29] there but Jesus says
[1:27:32] arise now he said arise now this man had
[1:27:35] a choice right there Christ was winding
[1:27:39] right there he was starting to wind him
[1:27:41] up that man had a choice right there I
[1:27:43] can either say I can sit here because my
[1:27:46] legs don't work I can't get to the pool
[1:27:50] or he could accept at that moment that
[1:27:52] was his Victory Day
[1:27:54] and he could stand to his feet and so he
[1:27:57] arose and took up his bed and he walked
[1:28:00] away right
[1:28:09] amen I want to say
[1:28:12] though in that
[1:28:15] moment what if he doesn't arise yes sir
[1:28:18] what if he tells
[1:28:20] him my legs don't work and I can't get
[1:28:23] to the the pool I can't stand
[1:28:26] up he lost his
[1:28:31] moment would that healing ever come that
[1:28:34] was his moment that was his Victory Day
[1:28:36] right there but it was up to him to
[1:28:38] possess it if he doesn't stand up just
[1:28:42] like those men at Sea he's lost forever
[1:28:46] you know brother Brown tells a story
[1:28:47] about a young lady that was sitting in
[1:28:49] his meeting and brother Brandon made an
[1:28:51] altar call that's right and people were
[1:28:53] coming to the altar but some the Holy
[1:28:56] Spirit was fixed on that
[1:28:59] lady the Holy Spirit was doing
[1:29:01] everything he could for that lady to
[1:29:05] come to the altar so much is where
[1:29:07] brother brandham walked down off the
[1:29:09] pull pit walked over to her and said
[1:29:11] sister the holy spirit is speaking to me
[1:29:14] about you and she denied
[1:29:17] it and a few years later he saw that
[1:29:20] same woman that's exactly right and she
[1:29:23] told him at that moment after insulting
[1:29:25] him she told him you are
[1:29:28] right because from that moment right
[1:29:30] there I could see my mother's Soul
[1:29:33] frying in hell and I would laugh at it
[1:29:35] what was that Christ was doing
[1:29:38] everything he could he was winding as
[1:29:41] much as he could but that Cog was
[1:29:43] refusing to
[1:29:45] move she missed that moment in her life
[1:29:50] and she was lost
[1:29:52] forever prise God when those moments
[1:29:55] come we need to
[1:29:56] recognize that's my moment this is my
[1:29:59] moment today is my Victory
[1:30:05] Day
[1:30:11] Glory Mercy I'm all over my
[1:30:17] notse so there was another man one
[1:30:21] time and I
[1:30:24] can see this as he was getting ready for
[1:30:26] for church for temple that day was the
[1:30:29] Sabbath
[1:30:30] day the Bible doesn't tell us how old
[1:30:34] this man was I don't know if he was
[1:30:35] married I don't know if he still lived
[1:30:36] at home but I'm I wonder if at one point
[1:30:40] while he was getting ready and he went
[1:30:41] to put his robe or his jacket on if he
[1:30:42] had to have his mom or maybe his wife
[1:30:44] helping because his his arm was withered
[1:30:48] up yes sir but he was going to go to
[1:30:50] Temple that day yes sir and as he got
[1:30:53] there that day
[1:30:55] there's a different person standing in
[1:30:57] that Temple that day and this man was
[1:31:00] was speaking probably in a way that most
[1:31:03] of those people had never heard before
[1:31:06] and there was all these Pharisees and
[1:31:07] the the the priests and everything
[1:31:09] standing there and they were looking at
[1:31:12] this man with the withered arm J and
[1:31:14] they were looking at the at Jesus Christ
[1:31:16] standing there thinking I wonder if
[1:31:18] he'll heal that man on the Sabbath day
[1:31:21] because that's not that's not permitted
[1:31:23] you don't do that and as Jesus was
[1:31:26] perceiving their
[1:31:28] thoughts he looked at that man and he
[1:31:31] said come here and he actually brings
[1:31:34] him out into the middle of the
[1:31:38] temple and he tells him stretch forth
[1:31:43] your hand now here was a moment again
[1:31:46] for this man this man had a moment right
[1:31:49] here he could either stretch forth that
[1:31:52] hand or he could have said I can't do it
[1:31:54] because my hand is withered right but
[1:31:57] Jesus standing there had started winding
[1:31:59] that watch and that c the tiniest little
[1:32:03] Cog started to move and when that tiny
[1:32:06] Cog started to move the great big Cog
[1:32:09] started to move and that man stretched
[1:32:11] forth his hand in front of all those
[1:32:14] people in the middle of that Temple
[1:32:16] because he's a Healer amen Victory Day
[1:32:20] came for that man right
[1:32:22] then Glory we've all heard the story of
[1:32:25] the prodigal son right how he he he
[1:32:28] asked his father give me all that's mine
[1:32:31] I'm going to I'm going to leave I'm I'm
[1:32:32] going you know that story could go a lot
[1:32:35] of different ways but the so he takes
[1:32:37] all of his his earnings and he leaves he
[1:32:40] goes and he spends all of his
[1:32:42] earnings he finds himself in a pig pin
[1:32:44] yes
[1:32:46] sir but he
[1:32:48] remembered I'm the
[1:32:50] son of this man amen amen that's my
[1:32:54] father that's right amen and you know as
[1:32:57] we look at this story as he was sitting
[1:33:00] in that pig pin and he starts
[1:33:02] remembering who he was that watch
[1:33:05] started to get
[1:33:06] wound that tiny Cog started to think all
[1:33:10] I've got to do is go home
[1:33:13] Hallelujah even if even if he doesn't
[1:33:15] accept me back as a son his servants eat
[1:33:17] better than I do that tiny Cog started
[1:33:21] to move but we know the story he went
[1:33:23] home and the father ran and met him
[1:33:27] because he had started that tiny Cog
[1:33:28] started moving it forced the larger Cog
[1:33:31] to start turning and he met him with a
[1:33:34] robe he they had a feast for this man
[1:33:39] but you know I want to stop it on this
[1:33:40] point
[1:33:41] here you know it took a pig
[1:33:45] pin to get that prodical son to realize
[1:33:49] where he was
[1:33:50] at and I think most of you sitting here
[1:33:52] know my testimony my God that's not what
[1:33:56] my pig pin looked like
[1:33:59] God we were doing just
[1:34:02] fine we had money we had nice cars my
[1:34:06] pig pin did not look like his Pig pin
[1:34:09] wow wow I ask you to think about what
[1:34:13] does your pig pin look
[1:34:15] like you know brother Bron makes a
[1:34:17] statement that just because it's
[1:34:19] paraphrasing just because it's cloudy
[1:34:21] skies doesn't mean that's God's
[1:34:22] disapproval am and just because it's
[1:34:25] sunny skies doesn't mean it's his
[1:34:28] approval so what does our Pig pin look
[1:34:31] like this morning what is it what does
[1:34:33] it take for that Cog to start
[1:34:39] moving it's another time that Christ was
[1:34:43] out and he was called that his friend
[1:34:46] Lazarus was
[1:34:47] dying and as he dwelt in the where he
[1:34:51] was at for a couple more days
[1:34:54] because he knew what was going to happen
[1:34:55] when he went back yes sir he already
[1:34:58] knew what was going to happen sir so he
[1:35:01] dwelt where he was at for a couple more
[1:35:02] days because this was going to be for
[1:35:03] the glory of the
[1:35:05] Lord those Victory days are always for
[1:35:09] the glory of the
[1:35:10] Lord amen but as he makes his way back
[1:35:15] he walks into the city Martha comes
[1:35:17] running if you'd only been here if here
[1:35:20] we go again with the if if you'd only
[1:35:22] been here yes my brother would still be
[1:35:26] alive and as Jesus starts talking to her
[1:35:30] and he starts
[1:35:31] winding and he starts telling her your
[1:35:34] brother will live again and she says yes
[1:35:37] I know in the general Resurrection but I
[1:35:41] am I
[1:35:43] am the
[1:35:46] resurrection he starts winding that Cog
[1:35:48] up because the next thing she says is
[1:35:50] even now even now what whatever you ask
[1:35:55] I know that he'll give you I don't know
[1:35:57] that she fully understood what was
[1:35:59] getting ready to happen
[1:36:01] but even thou amen whatever you ask and
[1:36:05] as this man
[1:36:07] Jesus Walks over and he actually starts
[1:36:09] to
[1:36:11] weep and I want to think about this
[1:36:13] moment for just a minute as he starts to
[1:36:16] weep I'm sure that those people in that
[1:36:19] City looking all those people were
[1:36:21] looking at this man going this man's got
[1:36:24] a problem brother Solomon for the rest
[1:36:27] of his life he's going to have a problem
[1:36:29] knowing that if he would have been
[1:36:31] here he could have saved this man he
[1:36:34] could have healed this man this was his
[1:36:36] friend this was one he loved if he would
[1:36:39] have just been here he could have healed
[1:36:41] him but he's going to have to live with
[1:36:43] this for the rest of his life with this
[1:36:46] problem that he's
[1:36:50] got hold the thought on that right there
[1:36:53] all right so I'm going to tell you a
[1:36:54] story real
[1:36:57] quick so right before Sarah and I
[1:36:59] started coming back to church we took a
[1:37:00] trip to uh to
[1:37:03] Jamaica and while we were in Jamaica we
[1:37:06] were we were at a a resort and on the
[1:37:09] resort they they offered uh um we could
[1:37:12] take um excursions go out out of the the
[1:37:15] resort just you know see see Jamaica so
[1:37:18] we set one of these up and we get on
[1:37:20] they they just a bus would pull up we'd
[1:37:22] all get on the bus and so as we're on
[1:37:24] the bus and there's a there's a lady um
[1:37:28] uh at the front of the bus and she's
[1:37:29] going to kind of be the the guide and uh
[1:37:32] she kind of starts talking to us a
[1:37:33] little bit and the bus starts to move to
[1:37:36] pull away and a woman from the back of
[1:37:38] the bus she yells wait a minute wait a
[1:37:40] minute I got a problem and they're like
[1:37:42] what's going on and she's like I just I
[1:37:44] forgot my medicine I think it was her
[1:37:45] medicine I forgot my my medication in
[1:37:47] the room so the lady says well just stop
[1:37:50] the bus and and they let her off and she
[1:37:52] was like just you know hurry just go
[1:37:53] grab it and come back so the lady come
[1:37:55] goes and comes back and she gets back on
[1:37:57] the bus bus starts moving again this
[1:37:59] Jamaican lady she takes this moment to
[1:38:02] to to to give us a little lesson about
[1:38:05] how the island works and she says you
[1:38:08] know on the island here we don't have
[1:38:12] problems we only have
[1:38:16] situations now at that moment I was not
[1:38:19] serving the lord certainly didn't have
[1:38:22] any thoughts of being a minister
[1:38:24] but for some reason that stuck with
[1:38:26] me and I couldn't figure out
[1:38:29] why and so not too long ago I looked
[1:38:32] this up this just came back into my mind
[1:38:34] again it's not a problem it's only a
[1:38:35] situation so I actually Googled I looked
[1:38:38] I I looked up the definition of what a
[1:38:40] problem is I looked up the definition of
[1:38:43] what a situation is I even Googled
[1:38:46] what's the difference between a problem
[1:38:48] in a situation well see the the
[1:38:50] difference between them is is a problem
[1:38:52] May or may not have a solution the
[1:38:56] solution may
[1:38:57] be it might not be good if you do it
[1:39:00] this way it might not be good if you do
[1:39:01] it this way but that's the solution you
[1:39:04] got to one way or the other that's the
[1:39:06] answer to it but it may not even have an
[1:39:09] answer however a
[1:39:11] situation is something that can just be
[1:39:14] changed amen that's the difference
[1:39:17] between a problem and a
[1:39:20] situation so all those people that were
[1:39:22] standing there going this man's got a
[1:39:25] problem they didn't understand who they
[1:39:28] were dealing with that he had the power
[1:39:31] to take a situation to take any
[1:39:35] situation and change that situation so
[1:39:39] as brother Braham talks about that this
[1:39:40] man with the stoop shoulders that was
[1:39:43] nothing to look at when he was standing
[1:39:45] there and he was tears running out of
[1:39:47] his eyes but he said where have you laid
[1:39:49] him and when he stepped up in front of
[1:39:53] that tomb and he squared up those little
[1:39:56] shoulders he squared them up because now
[1:39:59] he's ready to fight there was more than
[1:40:01] a man standing there there was more than
[1:40:04] a man standing in front of that
[1:40:06] tomb the situation was about to be
[1:40:10] changed but why because the tiniest Cog
[1:40:13] just a few minutes ago had started to
[1:40:16] turn which was allowing the great Cog to
[1:40:19] start turning and when he stepped up to
[1:40:22] that grave with so much power so much
[1:40:25] Authority brother Bram said if he
[1:40:27] wouldn't have called his name that he
[1:40:29] would have the general Resurrection
[1:40:32] would have taken place right then that
[1:40:34] everything that had ever died everything
[1:40:37] would have come up out of the Grave
[1:40:39] because that's the power of Christ
[1:40:42] that's what happens when the tiniest Cog
[1:40:45] will start
[1:40:48] moving Hallelujah there was another man
[1:40:51] by the name of Joshua
[1:40:53] one time he was in a
[1:40:55] battle this wasn't just a little
[1:40:58] Skirmish there was five kingdoms that
[1:41:00] were coming against him and they had
[1:41:03] been fighting all day long and they were
[1:41:06] just about to win this Victory but the
[1:41:09] sun was going down his men were coming
[1:41:12] to him and saying Joshua it's getting
[1:41:14] dark if it gets dark we're going to lose
[1:41:17] them they're going to run they're going
[1:41:18] to regrip we're going to have to fight
[1:41:20] this fight again but Joshua knew the
[1:41:24] Creator hallu he knew the one that
[1:41:27] created the moon and the sun glory and
[1:41:31] so that little Cog that had already been
[1:41:33] wound up under Moses's Ministry sir that
[1:41:36] little Cog started to move and he said
[1:41:39] Son stand still moon stop moving I need
[1:41:44] some more time because it was not a
[1:41:47] problem to him that was just a little
[1:41:50] situation that could be changed by the
[1:41:53] the Creator that tiny Cog started
[1:41:56] putting the larger Cog into
[1:41:58] motion and time stopped the sun Stood
[1:42:02] Still the Bible said that God hearkened
[1:42:06] to the voice of a man he listened to
[1:42:08] what that man said because that tiny Cog
[1:42:12] started to move the bigger
[1:42:15] Cog glory to God
[1:42:19] hallelujah
[1:42:21] amen there was a man one time sitting
[1:42:24] listening to Paul preach
[1:42:27] amen and the man had been born
[1:42:30] because all these stories we're
[1:42:32] telling right now Christ was right
[1:42:35] there Lord Christ Jesus Christ was
[1:42:37] standing right there but this was
[1:42:40] Paul this was after the crucifixion this
[1:42:43] was
[1:42:45] Paul Paul preached and this man that had
[1:42:47] been crippled his entire life was
[1:42:49] sitting there and something started
[1:42:52] stirring in that man's heart and Paul
[1:42:55] perceived that this man has the faith to
[1:42:59] be healed so he just looked at him and
[1:43:03] said stand to your feet he said it with
[1:43:06] a loud voice what was that because the
[1:43:09] watch had been wound that tiny Cog had
[1:43:11] started to move and that Faith from him
[1:43:14] caught the the the the attention of
[1:43:17] God's servant standing there because he
[1:43:19] started to move he started moving there
[1:43:22] was nothing that could stop that point
[1:43:25] those teeth that were intertwined
[1:43:27] started to move Hallelujah
[1:43:29] huj and the man stood to his feet had
[1:43:32] never walked a day in his life but he
[1:43:34] stood up under the the voice of
[1:43:38] Paul amen sir
[1:43:41] amen
[1:43:44] God there's a story that brother
[1:43:46] brandham tells yes sir he was in
[1:43:49] Arkansas one
[1:43:51] time and as he had just got done
[1:43:53] preaching and they were the policemen
[1:43:55] were around him because in Arkansas
[1:43:58] there was segregation yes sir all the
[1:44:00] black people were on one side that's
[1:44:02] right all the white people were on the
[1:44:04] other side amen right but this one
[1:44:06] little old black man come on right
[1:44:09] standing over to the side Hallelujah he
[1:44:12] heard brother Bram God's servant heard
[1:44:15] that man crying Mercy Mercy and what had
[1:44:20] happened just a few days before that man
[1:44:22] had had a dream his mother came to him
[1:44:25] in a dream what was that that was God
[1:44:28] winding that watch and when that little
[1:44:31] old black man got to that service there
[1:44:33] wasn't enough demons in hell to stop
[1:44:36] what was going to happen it didn't
[1:44:38] matter how much segregation there was in
[1:44:41] Arkansas nothing was stopping that
[1:44:43] moment and when that man started to yell
[1:44:46] out mercy and God's servant heard him he
[1:44:48] said I have to go over there I have to
[1:44:51] go over there there why because that Cog
[1:44:55] started moving it made the master Cog
[1:44:59] start moving and the policemen were
[1:45:01] saying we can't take you over there
[1:45:04] we'll start a race riot if we go over
[1:45:06] there but it did not matter the master
[1:45:09] Cog was already moving he had no choice
[1:45:13] but to go over there and when he walked
[1:45:16] over there and that blind man told him
[1:45:19] what the problem was I can't see but he
[1:45:22] believed
[1:45:23] he knew that in that M moment that was
[1:45:27] going to be his victory day there was
[1:45:30] nothing that could stop
[1:45:32] that glory to God and that man received
[1:45:35] his sight right there in that
[1:45:38] moment praise God
[1:45:42] Amen our Victory
[1:45:45] Day it could be a long ways away all
[1:45:48] right or it could be this day amen amen
[1:45:52] amen could be right here right
[1:45:54] now because I don't care what you're
[1:45:56] sitting here with I don't care if if if
[1:46:00] if if if the doctors have told you you
[1:46:01] have no hope I just left the church in
[1:46:05] Sarasota the doctors had given up on
[1:46:07] that man that's right stage four
[1:46:10] cancer but when they went to run the
[1:46:12] test after they had they had laid hands
[1:46:15] on that man when they went to run the
[1:46:16] test they couldn't find
[1:46:19] anything they were running tests to see
[1:46:21] how they were going to stop stop the
[1:46:23] cancer but they couldn't find the cancer
[1:46:26] why was that because that man drove down
[1:46:29] a steak and said today is my victory day
[1:46:34] today is I'm winning this battle today
[1:46:37] not tomorrow not next week but
[1:46:43] today don't look now but Paul or brother
[1:46:47] brandham wasn't here but the same Lord
[1:46:50] Jesus that was there the same one that
[1:46:53] stood at the tomb of Lazarus the same
[1:46:56] one at the with the woman at the well
[1:46:59] he's here right
[1:47:00] now I'm not brother brandham there is no
[1:47:03] brother brandham but there is still the
[1:47:06] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:47:09] here right now whatever your need is
[1:47:13] whether it be sickness whether your
[1:47:15] family's falling apart marriage problems
[1:47:18] money problems I don't care what the
[1:47:21] problem can I get a tiny Cog to start
[1:47:25] moving today can I get somebody to say
[1:47:29] that today is my Victory
[1:47:31] [Applause]
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:37] Day we always say that we're waiting on
[1:47:40] him but I tell you today he's waiting on
[1:47:44] you he's waiting for that call to stand
[1:47:48] in faith not because I felt something
[1:47:51] but in faith because you you said that
[1:47:53] was my promise that's what your word
[1:47:56] says your word says it's my promise it's
[1:48:00] my possession and like Caleb I stand
[1:48:02] here today and I say that we're more
[1:48:04] than able that's my possession my
[1:48:07] healing is mine it's already been paid
[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:13] for my healing was paid for at
[1:48:18] Calvary my family was paid for at
[1:48:21] Calvary my sins were paid for at
[1:48:25] Calvary the sin question was answered at
[1:48:30] Calvary it's already done is there a
[1:48:33] tiny Cog in this building that will
[1:48:36] start moving and will reach out like the
[1:48:39] woman at with the blood issue she didn't
[1:48:41] we she didn't reach out like all the
[1:48:43] rest of them were reaching out they were
[1:48:45] touching Jesus they were all touching
[1:48:47] him with a physical hand she didn't need
[1:48:50] to touch him physically she reached out
[1:48:53] with something more that St that caused
[1:48:56] that man to stop in his tracks because
[1:48:59] that little Cog started to move and it
[1:49:02] forced that big Cog to start
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:11] moving do we have any little cogs in
[1:49:14] here I don't know what you have need of

[2:12:39] here
[2:12:41] and but we got to do what we need to do
[2:12:43] if we want God to do what he's going to
