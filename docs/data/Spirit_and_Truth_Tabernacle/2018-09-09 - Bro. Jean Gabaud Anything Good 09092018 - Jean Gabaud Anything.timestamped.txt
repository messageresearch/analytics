[54:52] descending upon the Son of Man Amana the
[54:55] Lord had his blessings in a reading of
[54:57] the word you may be seated
[54:58] [Music]
[54:59] amen just for a little while I like to
[55:02] minister without on it's anything good
[55:05] anything good so there we've had that
[55:08] kind of lay foundation you know just to
[55:12] kind of start it off here you know you
[55:16] find where Philip finds Nathaniel and
[55:19] citizens and we have found of them who
[55:22] we've been looking for and Moses spoke
[55:27] about them and the prophets spoke about
[55:29] them and surely this is Jesus of
[55:33] Nazareth so we know so they had to have
[55:35] had some sort of an understanding of
[55:38] what to look for and so by studying the
[55:42] scripture of the Old Testament you know
[55:45] Philip you know had an understanding of
[55:47] what to look for so when you know when
[55:49] Jesus came forth you could say you know
[55:51] this is what Moses spoke about this is
[55:53] what the prophets spoke about and so and
[55:56] so you go
[55:58] Sanatana and he tells him we have found
[56:00] him and you could just imagine the joy
[56:03] that overwhelmed philip when when he
[56:08] told the Matheny of this and the famous
[56:12] response was well let me ask you is
[56:14] there anything good that could come out
[56:17] of Nazareth so you know Nazareth carried
[56:22] a reputation but you know my declaration
[56:24] to you this morning is that we're not a
[56:26] product of our environment
[56:29] we're product of the word it's the word
[56:34] that has shaped us it's the word that
[56:37] has loaded us it's the word that has
[56:39] made you who you are and so and it's so
[56:44] interesting because even as the finger
[56:47] responded to Philips testimony Jesus was
[56:52] already seeing the interaction and he
[56:55] was already keeping an eye on things the
[56:57] other vision when he saw this and he
[57:00] until when you say Neal came to Jesus
[57:03] and here at that brief moment of
[57:04] interaction and he was impressed with
[57:06] the fact that you know Jesus had that
[57:08] vision that word he saw him under the
[57:10] fig tree says a few impressed with this
[57:12] painting on site there's a lot more that
[57:14] you can be impressed with because that's
[57:16] nothing I'm capable of more than just me
[57:18] seeing you in a vision and so it just
[57:22] you know it's just remarkable because it
[57:26] amplifies the value that you hold before
[57:30] God then we're in straits the story he
[57:33] says you know and I might have said this
[57:35] before he talks about this auction era
[57:37] where you know they were
[57:39] of these uh there was option enough
[57:42] these are these these things and and so
[57:45] they came in they saw this violin that
[57:47] was kind of there in this violin was
[57:49] really you know it was kind of you know
[57:52] I'm not really look it's best
[57:55] it just didn't had this appeal this a
[57:58] attraction to it wasn't appealing and so
[58:02] on
[58:03] the auctioneer looks at the the violin
[58:06] and he says you know what do you guys
[58:08] want for this and you know somebody
[58:10] cries out fifty cents and somebody else
[58:13] cries out one dollar you know it didn't
[58:16] appeal it didn't appear like it was much
[58:19] worth of anything and so someone in the
[58:23] back crowd just kind of even weighed his
[58:25] way through the crowd and kind of says
[58:28] excuse me pardon me and he gets there
[58:30] and the profit illustrates that he grabs
[58:32] his violin he blows the dust off of the
[58:35] violin he washes the ball roll quickly
[58:38] and he begins to play such a sweet
[58:40] melody there is not one dry in the midst
[58:45] of the audience and so the auctioneer
[58:48] after you probably write this series he
[58:50] took a step back he says you know what
[58:53] offer for it now and most of it when we
[58:55] could finish the first class this $1,000
[58:58] so this is $2,000 so there's $16,000 and
[59:03] the purposes will change it's still the
[59:04] same violin but in the hands of the
[59:07] master it revealed its true character
[59:11] and revealed its true nature
[59:13] let me tell you about somebody that was
[59:16] a nobody in the world but in the hands
[59:18] of Almighty God he's going to character
[59:23] you don't got to nature you're not just
[59:26] somebody but you're the body of the Lord
[59:29] Jesus Christ and so you find that it's
[59:36] it's it's it's the character it's your
[59:40] nature between right for God's pulled
[59:42] out of you you know you look at Abraham
[59:45] he his background was not conducive to
[59:48] being what you will call the father of
[59:50] faith you know the way brother
[59:53] illustrates it in Genesis and the
[59:55] message the unconditional covenant he
[59:59] says we find a man by the name of a
[1:00:02] this is his father's ring a believeth
[1:00:05] and became God probably from Babylon so
[1:00:10] his dad came from Babylon and I don't
[1:00:13] worship her that versus Texas test his
[1:00:18] genealogy that's his family's tree
[1:00:22] because Idol worshipers they pay they
[1:00:27] came to King down in the valleys of
[1:00:29] Shannara we're in the land of kadia in
[1:00:31] the city of Earth he was married his
[1:00:34] half-sister same as as they came down
[1:00:36] and destroyed of all the people there
[1:00:38] was Abraham now listen to this he says
[1:00:40] Abraham wasn't any better than anyone
[1:00:44] else
[1:00:47] Abraham was not better than anyone else
[1:00:50] but God by so they placed an election
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:24] my sister
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:56] because I'm still here I follow God's
[1:02:00] program I only point to the kingdom of
[1:02:03] God I am somebody before the eyes of God
[1:02:07] watching me but I am somebody before God
[1:02:13] this is well beyond your family tree you
[1:02:18] must approaching you need to know that
[1:02:21] you know about that about the promise
[1:02:27] that God has given to you and the
[1:02:29] direction that you're going you'll come
[1:02:37] in search to be more than just the same
[1:02:40] a religious obligation it's your
[1:02:45] paycheck declaration to the devil and a
[1:02:48] statement whose side you're on
[1:02:51] when you come to church it's on the
[1:02:53] better you are not victorious that week
[1:03:12] take much more just on these will come
[1:03:15] into the hostage God people may not know
[1:03:23] where you will cease this week they may
[1:03:27] not know what you faced this week then
[1:03:29] then I know your challenges but God
[1:03:33] knows Abram his background his family
[1:03:40] history when his dad was and he goes on
[1:03:46] know nothing said that April is any
[1:03:49] better
[1:03:51] though ever says he was a youth don't
[1:03:55] even say there's a little believer in
[1:03:58] the beginning God just called them
[1:04:05] didn't even say he was a believer in the
[1:04:07] beginning you may not know you just
[1:04:10] heard a message you may not know the
[1:04:14] background of the prophets but this
[1:04:16] message click to you and it was more
[1:04:20] than just a man preaching a sermon but
[1:04:23] you heard the voice of God and that
[1:04:26] gripped you that got ahold of you and
[1:04:31] then from there there was a seed that
[1:04:33] was there and you begin to mature you
[1:04:39] know I go back to the very beginning
[1:04:41] with the Bible talks about that in the
[1:04:43] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:04:45] the earth and I like this passage of
[1:04:49] scripture because it's there's so many
[1:04:50] got some meaning certainly became God
[1:04:53] created the heaven and the earth and the
[1:04:57] earth the Bible says was without sir
[1:05:03] avoid that is the condition of the earth
[1:05:10] something happened between when the
[1:05:15] three verse 1 in the beginning God
[1:05:17] created the heaven and earth and the
[1:05:18] prophecies between verse 1 and verse 2
[1:05:20] could be millions and millions and
[1:05:22] millions and millions of years we don't
[1:05:23] know but something happened in the
[1:05:27] between well this earth that God had
[1:05:31] created that God loved that God
[1:05:37] cherished it was this creation and so
[1:05:42] therefore as he oversaw this creation
[1:05:45] the Bible says that this earth now you
[1:05:48] got a picture yourself in this this is
[1:05:51] my thought wrong
[1:05:53] and Floyd is missing something
[1:05:58] it lacked life there's no smell of
[1:06:04] godliness about this earth his the earth
[1:06:08] of God and the Bible is also say in
[1:06:12] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:06:16] and so this earth this this destroys the
[1:06:20] wall that we that we reside in was
[1:06:23] shrouded in darkness it was without form
[1:06:27] it was Freud there's something about
[1:06:32] this earth and as the Prophet
[1:06:35] illustrates it it moved away from the
[1:06:38] president's from the wrong presence of
[1:06:40] lights and saw this earth as it would
[1:06:44] appear wasn't so cast but you know
[1:06:49] what's remarkable about verse 2 the
[1:06:51] Bible goes on to say in the spirit of
[1:06:54] in the midst of all this dead
[1:06:55] explanation the spoon of God moved upon
[1:07:00] the face of the waters
[1:07:03] so this earth I was in the dead State
[1:07:07] one could ask it anything good come out
[1:07:11] of it did anything good come out of that
[1:07:20] when you just in idolatry can anything
[1:07:24] good come out of hats we can land with
[1:07:27] the wrong crowd when you engage in the
[1:07:30] whole activity when you get all these
[1:07:32] things wrong people look at you and say
[1:07:34] can anything good come out of this horse
[1:07:37] it's telling me oh there's only
[1:07:39] salvation is there any opportunity for
[1:07:42] you but the Bible says there's a snare
[1:07:47] God was watching over his creation
[1:07:52] because God had invested in his creation
[1:07:56] so he cannot lose his investment
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] you're not control of your own destiny
[1:08:03] in their pigs away God is watching you
[1:08:06] steps and when God saw this earth that
[1:08:15] moved away from his presence God loved
[1:08:19] his creation and so as the world the
[1:08:24] natural man's thinking without we look a
[1:08:28] step press analysis there's no hope for
[1:08:31] that for that individual but then when
[1:08:34] God comes on the scene the Bible begins
[1:08:37] to say as God is creating this earth
[1:08:40] this is a God stood right and the rest
[1:08:51] right now I want you to understand the
[1:08:57] vocabulary of Scripture God said right
[1:09:07] he's not asking for permission he was
[1:09:13] not seeking Township he's not asking for
[1:09:18] advice let me tell you God was working
[1:09:22] at his creation and he looked at me
[1:09:26] of that creation these ravenous Devils
[1:09:31] that could stop God's Word
[1:09:34] keep coming the pass light and the
[1:09:41] palace is immediately within the same
[1:09:43] breath there was light that's God
[1:09:50] looking in your direction because
[1:09:53] notices we will burn and sin shapen in
[1:09:57] iniquity Lewis big cavities real
[1:10:01] speaking lies no no one taught us that
[1:10:04] we just knew that we have to cover our
[1:10:05] tracks when we get something wrong when
[1:10:09] we said something wrong we have to kind
[1:10:11] of find an explanation for it
[1:10:13] really did something wrong we post
[1:10:15] something I'm gonna shoot me things
[1:10:17] under the bed the wrong little shooting
[1:10:18] things under the rock
[1:10:19] I'm over stripping things just trying to
[1:10:21] hide things I would get in trouble I'm
[1:10:26] not lying you said it was my brother and
[1:10:32] the evidence is all around me but if God
[1:10:37] looks at your soul now the Bible says
[1:10:42] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:10:47] for us and I'll let you to understand
[1:10:51] what that means
[1:10:51] when he is on the cross and we cry out
[1:10:57] and
[1:10:58] this is this is it is finished let me
[1:11:04] tell you he did not just speak those
[1:11:05] words to that many the time he saw every
[1:11:16] single committed you saw every
[1:11:18] conversation that you saw everything
[1:11:20] that you've been wrong and it is
[1:11:24] finished when you weren't even thinking
[1:11:30] about God he was thinking about you
[1:11:35] that's why I could tell you Saints you
[1:11:38] be here this morning
[1:11:39] you're no accident of God God purposely
[1:11:45] called you he's a virgin I've had some
[1:11:49] battles what does get back up and fight
[1:11:52] there G not falling a couple of times
[1:11:54] get back up it doesn't change God's
[1:11:58] opinions about you your faults your
[1:12:02] failures your shortcomings just laid at
[1:12:05] the feet of the altar you come back in
[1:12:07] uniquely ricer Lord you know the
[1:12:08] integrity of my heart you know the
[1:12:10] honesty of my heart God has a ways of
[1:12:16] bringing everything back into order can
[1:12:21] anything good come out of this earth and
[1:12:24] God said let there be light and there
[1:12:27] was light
[1:12:29] you talked about the maniac of God
[1:12:31] around and I think we might have
[1:12:33] mentioned this before where this man who
[1:12:37] is possessed with devils and here you
[1:12:40] find where Jesus was preaching to a
[1:12:42] multitude and he heard the cry
[1:12:45] man rinsing the man that was possessed
[1:12:48] with demons and so he spun around and he
[1:12:52] says we need to go to the other side and
[1:12:54] as he made his journey to go to the
[1:12:56] earth to the other side there was an
[1:12:58] attempt by a legion of devils that were
[1:13:01] trying to drown the effects of the word
[1:13:02] that's the word trying to reach this
[1:13:04] destination but when God has purposed
[1:13:09] himself
[1:13:10] she reads to come to you nothing can
[1:13:12] stop that journey from happening it's
[1:13:15] just like the TV real quickly
[1:13:17] it's just like when Daniel begins to
[1:13:19] pray he says Lord you know what is this
[1:13:22] State of Israel and you can get to call
[1:13:24] upon the man of God and the Bible memory
[1:13:27] serves me where the purposes in Daniel
[1:13:29] were 25 27 days later 27 days later so
[1:13:34] you know the angel Gabriel go see Daniel
[1:13:38] and Saint Daniel from the very first day
[1:13:41] then you have started to pray God heard
[1:13:44] your prayers he's approaching I've been
[1:13:48] praying about such a sense I've been
[1:13:50] praying about such a sense it's been so
[1:13:52] many days
[1:13:54] but the Bible says the first thing is
[1:13:58] God heard your prayers sometimes the
[1:14:02] test takes a lot of patience sometimes
[1:14:05] it takes a little battle sometimes it
[1:14:08] takes a little beating so that way you
[1:14:10] can appreciate when they will not burn
[1:14:12] of Summits paralyzed because if God is
[1:14:18] gave me everything that you wanted how
[1:14:21] could you have appreciate the patience
[1:14:24] appreciate the troubles don't appreciate
[1:14:27] the tribulations the journey the
[1:14:30] challenge it's no different when you
[1:14:35] worked so hard for something you've
[1:14:38] labored you've saved you finally
[1:14:41] obtained it there's an appreciation
[1:14:42] because it came it's wet you leave hurt
[1:14:46] a little bit your back aches a little
[1:14:48] bit but you know when we receive the
[1:14:50] blessing it was well worth it so the
[1:14:57] Maineiacs of Gadara he was left alone in
[1:15:01] the tombs and jesus made his way to go
[1:15:05] preach to that one soul many people pass
[1:15:09] them by many people didn't have anything
[1:15:12] to say to him but you know I don't feel
[1:15:17] people out because you just never know
[1:15:22] who God has called you never know who
[1:15:31] God has chosen
[1:15:32] I can imagine back in the day God told
[1:15:38] Moses Moses go and strike the rock Moses
[1:15:44] did Adam struck the rock water came out
[1:15:47] people still won't satisfy Moses
[1:15:51] don't speak to the rock everyone
[1:15:54] watching Moses Moses gets up there and
[1:15:58] girl filled up he had a temper problem
[1:16:00] you know he strikes the rock he just
[1:16:05] imagine the reaction the Assembly must
[1:16:07] have to see the temper of Moses get the
[1:16:11] better for the better part of him some
[1:16:16] probably some of them probably said you
[1:16:18] know what
[1:16:18] I heard God told Moses go speak to the
[1:16:21] rock he said no example for us striking
[1:16:27] the rock having an attitude and not only
[1:16:32] that to make matters worse Moses didn't
[1:16:34] even make it to the promised land
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:39] can you just imagine the people
[1:16:41] gossiping to this DeBellis find some
[1:16:44] good gossip you have Moses back here and
[1:16:47] make it to the promised land he just
[1:16:50] imagine all the whispers but you know
[1:16:55] you don't know when the person's going
[1:17:00] through something how God is dealing
[1:17:02] with them behind the scenes you might
[1:17:08] see the Howard struggles but you don't
[1:17:10] know the English player you might see
[1:17:14] the I would fall
[1:17:16] rise up you might see this fallacies
[1:17:20] that God sees their integrity you don't
[1:17:22] know what's happening behind the scenes
[1:17:26] you may cast a judgment because of what
[1:17:29] you see on the outside but you go man a
[1:17:31] gun is dealing with on the inside let's
[1:17:39] fast forward to Matthew chapter 17 Jesus
[1:17:43] went to give an example of the type of
[1:17:45] people that's gonna be at his side
[1:17:49] so naturally who comes up Elijah comes
[1:17:55] walking up right next to Jesus and
[1:17:59] perhaps everyone's amazement the second
[1:18:03] person who comes up standing right
[1:18:07] thanks to Jesus so long that people
[1:18:10] stopped didn't make it to the promised
[1:18:11] land
[1:18:12] he would never position next to Jesus
[1:18:15] Moses come walking and standing right
[1:18:18] next to Jesus
[1:18:22] surprises the very first thing that you
[1:18:27] putting into heaven people that you
[1:18:30] don't know that might be Paxton in the
[1:18:32] art and the one that you wanted that's
[1:18:36] moved on is said there's a clown and
[1:18:38] I've shown that a way to you can
[1:18:46] anything good come out of this age this
[1:18:51] generation they love the Lord Jesus gets
[1:18:58] to the maniac of Gadara he preaches a
[1:19:01] sermon casts out those Devils someone
[1:19:05] looks at him no one want to be around
[1:19:08] him he was just a mess but God goes to
[1:19:14] people who is exactly in that condition
[1:19:18] that's a mess it's easy when we're
[1:19:22] talking to one another and saying god
[1:19:24] bless you well it's easy when we're in
[1:19:27] the comfort of our seats and say praise
[1:19:29] the Lord
[1:19:30] the had that same conversation with your
[1:19:33] neighbor have that same conversation
[1:19:35] with someone that work you got to be a
[1:19:39] beacon of light no matter where you go
[1:19:43] your actions your behavior your conduct
[1:19:47] you have a 1:30 choker you don't have to
[1:19:51] say anything just snap and just condone
[1:19:53] it you tell them you just told the devil
[1:19:56] it's okay they say we're living in an
[1:20:01] age where it's not easy to be popular
[1:20:03] you may not always be
[1:20:07] but as long as you like telling them
[1:20:09] they love God's Word we gotta take a
[1:20:11] position and you'd be forced to take a
[1:20:19] position
[1:20:22] it's creeping into the jobs and as an
[1:20:28] example of that I know in Orlando came
[1:20:30] close to us when that when the when the
[1:20:33] the pulse light Club got the the victims
[1:20:38] that died we don't condone violence and
[1:20:42] we actually had one co-worker that was
[1:20:47] actually impacted by that didn't lose
[1:20:49] their life but was injured in the
[1:20:51] process and so naturally corporate
[1:20:54] America wants to rally behind think
[1:20:58] about this is your job this is your
[1:21:00] income this is how you take care of your
[1:21:02] family whether whatever position you
[1:21:06] hold and so the devil comes and he says
[1:21:09] you know I want you to carry certain
[1:21:10] bracelet in your hand to show that
[1:21:17] you're unified oh you're quite only not
[1:21:21] saying I don't agree with violence what
[1:21:26] I'm not gonna condone that lifestyle god
[1:21:29] I gotta make
[1:21:36] population and then posted an
[1:21:38] opportunity to grow when Jesus Christ
[1:21:42] became famous man this for treating the
[1:21:48] Charles dance portrayed in the home of
[1:21:50] the answer training the society you've
[1:21:52] gotta take a position it's much more
[1:21:55] than you coming to church and say hey
[1:21:57] man you gotta go out there and make a
[1:21:59] statement and you know how hard it is
[1:22:05] especially especially your member of
[1:22:07] leadership they lookin to you as an
[1:22:12] example how you gonna explain it I what
[1:22:18] are you gonna say know what you believe
[1:22:23] they don't know what's happening but
[1:22:25] these are spiritual yes they're the
[1:22:28] devil that's testing me on this ground
[1:22:30] but as long as you're certified behind
[1:22:32] God's Word
[1:22:34] does unpopular decisions and the devil
[1:22:41] is really sleek but that's not the
[1:22:44] bracelets you make sure that you're the
[1:22:47] company if people see what you do hey GV
[1:22:54] do you appreciate you
[1:23:00] y'all reflecting you the devil knows
[1:23:05] what he's doing
[1:23:08] and we realize saying well thank you but
[1:23:11] I'm gonna keep them in prayer you're
[1:23:16] you're using language they're not used
[1:23:18] to I sister shame what happened to those
[1:23:23] folks but that doesn't change what I
[1:23:27] believe the devil is slowly creeping in
[1:23:37] and he's given us a position where we
[1:23:40] gotta compromise I don't agree with
[1:23:47] violence we're seeing more of it but I
[1:23:51] know in the God that I serve gotta take
[1:23:56] a position gotta take a stand and know
[1:23:58] whose side you're on
[1:24:00] you stand for God and they'll stand for
[1:24:04] you you love the mother
[1:24:12] Jesus said and why take ye thought for
[1:24:15] raiment consider the lilies of the field
[1:24:19] how they grow they tell him not neither
[1:24:24] do they spin and yet I said to you that
[1:24:28] even Solomon in all his glory was not
[1:24:31] arrayed like the like one of these and
[1:24:34] then brother one picks up the census
[1:24:37] just like a lily where's Lily I think is
[1:24:40] one of the most prettiest flowers there
[1:24:42] is I'm very fond of those great calla
[1:24:46] lilies and palm lilies I sing there's
[1:24:48] nothing hardly as pretty as a great big
[1:24:51] palm Lily call it water lily it hurts
[1:24:55] radiance and where does it come from
[1:24:58] it's a little seed down in the bottom of
[1:25:00] a muddy muddy pond so there was a seed
[1:25:05] that was laying down when you are out
[1:25:09] there living a vulgar life but remember
[1:25:15] God said Let there be lights the power
[1:25:20] of light is so effective that no matter
[1:25:24] where you it's amazing how you see
[1:25:26] a plant begins to collapse among these
[1:25:29] concrete's
[1:25:30] because there's a stasis the wishes the
[1:25:33] power of nature that's calling the very
[1:25:35] life
[1:25:36] set itself so even though you may be
[1:25:39] fighting against God like an illusion in
[1:25:42] the process he says that little seed
[1:25:47] down in the bottom of the money lucky
[1:25:50] pond and then Lucy yet with all the
[1:25:52] radiance doubt that that are ever shine
[1:25:56] in it isn't it is right then when it's
[1:25:59] in that mud but it has to strive daily
[1:26:03] knowing that there is something it's
[1:26:06] it's it's it's black it's dirty it's
[1:26:08] like it's slimy and that's lime that
[1:26:10] it's living and yet it presses its way
[1:26:13] through the mud the mud and the lawyers
[1:26:17] and the stagnant places until it sticks
[1:26:19] his head above the light and expresses
[1:26:22] what's been here and all of it all the
[1:26:24] time every day you get up it's a battle
[1:26:36] you gotta fight every time you get up
[1:26:40] every breath that you breathe there's
[1:26:46] the battle it was about it for you to
[1:26:50] come to church you know sometimes the
[1:26:53] devil you know he'll give you here give
[1:26:56] you dollars throughout the course of the
[1:26:57] week he'll make a challenging business
[1:27:00] I'd like every time before church
[1:27:03] service he seems to Ratchet it up a
[1:27:06] little bit you know I'll get up in the
[1:27:10] morning that struggle you know just try
[1:27:12] and get up to go to work but I find the
[1:27:14] extra hard that's Sunday morning that
[1:27:19] bad seems that much more comfortable the
[1:27:23] alarm clock is not as loud as it is then
[1:27:25] a week and you hit the snooze button a
[1:27:29] couple more times you might have gone
[1:27:34] along with your wife we'd rather go
[1:27:36] alone with the husband
[1:27:37] I've got alone with the kids throughout
[1:27:39] the course of the week but Sunday
[1:27:41] learning it's reversed there it seems
[1:27:47] like you're always racing me because
[1:27:50] it's a battle and you're also a late
[1:27:55] start perhaps and then you seem like you
[1:27:58] hit every red lights and you tap in the
[1:28:03] witness understand beyond you tapping
[1:28:05] the gas just hoping that the light goes
[1:28:07] faster and turns and you come across who
[1:28:12] cut you off on the way to church and I
[1:28:14] said this last time let's hope that
[1:28:16] they're not go to the same service
[1:28:17] you're going to cuz that happened to me
[1:28:19] before
[1:28:20] cut me off I'm so upset they'll go to
[1:28:24] the same church service I was going
[1:28:25] through didn't recognize the car hide
[1:28:27] that no one it was well that's a
[1:28:28] different story
[1:28:29] does it tend to behave differently you
[1:28:34] are thrown up in your spirit you come to
[1:28:37] church is frustrated you and chaos don't
[1:28:45] have the right frame of mind and then
[1:28:47] you expecting the son here to see you
[1:28:49] happy
[1:28:55] how do we change that it's like this one
[1:29:00] brother that sold this story maybe some
[1:29:02] of you heard it before but I thought it
[1:29:03] was a little humorous he says a husband
[1:29:05] and wife will get into an argument and
[1:29:08] they were arguing all over the church
[1:29:10] husband mixer they make it to church the
[1:29:13] husband gets up there and he's singing
[1:29:14] he's shouting he's playing
[1:29:19] this man is a hip arguing upon the name
[1:30:00] of the Lord sometimes I feel like I'm
[1:30:05] gonna sting anyhow you gotta include the
[1:30:12] Bible says David when he was low in
[1:30:15] spirit he encouraged himself he
[1:30:19] encouraged himself sometimes the deacon
[1:30:21] and I'll be there to encourage you the
[1:30:23] pastor will not be there to tell you but
[1:30:25] there's a Word of God
[1:30:26] there's a scripture that you define
[1:30:28] encourage
[1:30:29] from praise the Lord
[1:30:36] you might as a brother you get so
[1:30:38] excited about the word I mean that
[1:30:39] heaven consists of the word if you can
[1:30:43] get excited about God's words then
[1:30:45] you're gonna be in a world of trouble
[1:30:47] when we get to the other side he says I
[1:30:54] think that's an overcomer that one since
[1:30:58] in this things that was wrong don't
[1:31:02] worry about it now
[1:31:03] what's the things that was wrong now I
[1:31:06] look back into that pond again this is
[1:31:10] by his predestination you brought this
[1:31:12] sea to life and expressing itself coming
[1:31:16] to life and now on top of all that he
[1:31:19] has overcome see it doesn't express
[1:31:22] yourself down there it's getting up to
[1:31:26] expressing itself so I was in the
[1:31:29] mornings in the mud that is all in that
[1:31:32] darkness
[1:31:32] it couldn't express itself but that
[1:31:37] scene when you wanna proceed it holds
[1:31:39] all the potentials what it's going to be
[1:31:42] and the moment that you cast light upon
[1:31:46] that everything that's in that scene
[1:31:48] begins to present itself
[1:31:52] it's a stir so it doesn't express
[1:31:54] yourself down there it's giving out to
[1:31:57] express yourself neither did you and
[1:31:59] your sin and adulterine everything that
[1:32:02] you lived in you didn't express nothing
[1:32:05] seed in there and they got a chance to
[1:32:11] press it suffix in life and now you're
[1:32:14] in the presence of Jesus Christ with the
[1:32:17] sunlight abroad I will you really was in
[1:32:21] the beginning so if we go back to
[1:32:24] Genesis where the Bible says in the
[1:32:27] beginning God created heaven earth and
[1:32:29] earth was without form and void and
[1:32:30] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:32:32] the seeds were already in the earth God
[1:32:39] didn't just put the seed the seeds were
[1:32:41] already there and so because the seeds
[1:32:45] were already there there was darkness
[1:32:46] that covered the earth so when you were
[1:32:50] born there was a seed of God already
[1:32:53] implanted within you the potential to
[1:32:57] become sons and daughters of God was
[1:33:00] already in you but there was a dark veil
[1:33:05] of sin iniquity that shrouded it because
[1:33:10] you're a part of the human fall so
[1:33:14] therefore you you you behave the way you
[1:33:16] behave you acted the way you acted you
[1:33:19] conducted yourself the way you conducted
[1:33:20] yourself but the seed of God God had an
[1:33:23] obligation to watch over that seed and
[1:33:26] so when he says let there be light
[1:33:29] this sea was already here so the
[1:33:33] darkness is just telling the darkness to
[1:33:35] dissipate you move away so that we just
[1:33:37] see this on the inside could be seen
[1:33:40] by the light and so the prophecies it's
[1:33:44] the type of a human being it's the type
[1:33:47] of the believer so when God says let
[1:33:52] there be light
[1:33:53] he was looking at the seed that was
[1:33:56] already inside of you
[1:33:59] you can have drifts too far away well
[1:34:04] it's it's mind-blowing to me
[1:34:07] there are literally thousands of
[1:34:09] religion thousands of denominations
[1:34:13] thousands of faiths thousands of belief
[1:34:16] seven billion people of complain earth
[1:34:19] you will go to India pick up more
[1:34:21] religion per capita they got all these
[1:34:24] gods and yet the Lord Himself bypassed
[1:34:29] billions of people bypass institutions
[1:34:33] BiPAP denominations bypass palaces
[1:34:36] bypass kingdoms it came down to you and
[1:34:42] found favor with you your parents
[1:34:46] whether you met I bet you never had a
[1:34:48] rough upbringing but God stuff sucks
[1:34:52] favor with you the Bible says he came to
[1:35:00] the lost sheep of Israel see God is very
[1:35:05] purposeful in his actions came looking
[1:35:10] specifically for an individual when
[1:35:16] Adams fell he didn't say hey where are
[1:35:20] you
[1:35:21] he says Adam where art thou he called
[1:35:27] him by name when Lazarus died and Jesus
[1:35:34] keeps the scene you can say hey rise
[1:35:39] Lazarus rise when a thermos caught Abram
[1:35:44] Gus is an illusion Abraham you know you
[1:35:50] by name
[1:35:52] you're not just somebody that's lost in
[1:35:55] a sea of people but God has an
[1:35:58] obligation to look at that scene on the
[1:36:03] inside and you're responding to that
[1:36:07] word your actions your behavior your
[1:36:15] conduct your responding to that word
[1:36:20] that seed is materialized you said Billy
[1:36:23] gene I have thoughts I have failures I
[1:36:25] have opportunity that's okay because the
[1:36:28] Bible says he that has begun a good work
[1:36:30] in you will finish it
[1:36:38] couple more scriptures and I'm gonna let
[1:36:40] you go the Bible says this in Isaiah but
[1:36:45] now O Lord sorry
[1:36:49] our Father we are the clay and Stark the
[1:36:54] Potter and we are all the work of thy
[1:36:59] hand and in Jeremiah the virus is the
[1:37:02] word which gains you Jeremiah from the
[1:37:05] Lord saying arise and go down to the
[1:37:11] potter's house and there I will cause
[1:37:14] the
[1:37:14] to hear my words then I went down to the
[1:37:18] potter's house and behold here all day
[1:37:20] work on the wheels
[1:37:21] and the vessel that he made of clay that
[1:37:25] he made of Clare was marred in the hand
[1:37:27] of the Potter so he made it again he
[1:37:31] said he made it again another vessel as
[1:37:34] sea good to the Potter to make it now
[1:37:39] growing up I went to an art school and I
[1:37:43] did different different forms of art and
[1:37:45] one of the things that we did was
[1:37:46] actually make pottery and the way it
[1:37:49] works with any of you that may not have
[1:37:50] done this we take a lump of clay and
[1:37:53] that clay has no form
[1:37:56] it's not even attractive there's nothing
[1:38:00] appealing about it it's just a lump of
[1:38:03] clay so we have this this wheel this
[1:38:07] this turning wheels
[1:38:08] and at that time you can actually move
[1:38:10] it like this and it spins the wheel
[1:38:12] around now the technology you could just
[1:38:15] I wish I had that when I was growing up
[1:38:16] you could just press a pedal in the
[1:38:18] wheel spins but in any event you take
[1:38:21] this mop of clean add no form and so the
[1:38:26] key thing about it is is that you as the
[1:38:30] Potter will in control over the clay and
[1:38:36] God is using this same analogy so when
[1:38:40] you when I selected that clay that was
[1:38:43] grace because of all of the rest of them
[1:38:47] I said this is the chunk I want to work
[1:38:49] with this is this is the chunk that's
[1:38:53] gonna be doesn't become something of
[1:38:55] magnificent a masterpiece so I made a
[1:38:59] decision a conscious decision that I'm
[1:39:02] gonna work
[1:39:04] this piece of clean and but this clay
[1:39:08] they can't be hard it can't be solid it
[1:39:11] has to be a way where it can be soft and
[1:39:14] where you could move it and if it's not
[1:39:19] exactly where I needed to be I got a bit
[1:39:22] into it a little bit so I took this
[1:39:27] chunk of clay and I put it on the wheel
[1:39:29] but I just can't put it on any part of
[1:39:32] the wheel I have to put a dead in the
[1:39:35] center your position a Christ it's
[1:39:42] important you cannot take the Sun
[1:39:46] leaders position
[1:39:47] you cannot take the preachers position
[1:39:50] you cannot take the Deacons position
[1:39:52] that's all about closure to this you sit
[1:39:54] down and sustain man figure in your
[1:39:57] position you're more effective when
[1:40:02] you're in your position when Abram was
[1:40:06] outside of his position when Damon was
[1:40:09] in his position he he you didn't carry
[1:40:12] any King he was able to defeat five
[1:40:14] kings when he was in this position when
[1:40:18] Abram was outside of his position he was
[1:40:21] afraid of one king you're not effective
[1:40:26] when you're in your position I took this
[1:40:29] chunk of clay I put it dead in the
[1:40:31] sinner it had no appeal to it I examined
[1:40:37] this piece of clay and in my mind I know
[1:40:39] what it's going to be but for everyone
[1:40:43] else it didn't look like nothing but God
[1:40:46] knows we
[1:40:47] going to be he sees the end from the
[1:40:52] beginning familiar with drinking a beer
[1:40:58] drinking your alcohol smoking these
[1:41:00] cigarettes and smoking God knows God
[1:41:02] knows what else he saw your end from the
[1:41:05] beginning
[1:41:09] stay together
[1:41:10] I put the clay on here then I started to
[1:41:16] spin the wheel can you just imagine that
[1:41:20] they claim it's spinning about but it
[1:41:25] has to be centered and I can only
[1:41:28] imagine that how your life must have
[1:41:29] been delivering what you didn't know
[1:41:34] that you are coming or going
[1:41:36] you know that's the units of emissions
[1:41:39] you are happy or sad you know victorious
[1:41:43] or defeated you look lost all kinds of
[1:41:46] something but God got you right where he
[1:41:50] wants you he's holy to end his
[1:41:53] possession
[1:41:54] but the world is spinning all around you
[1:41:57] and you can make heads or tails about
[1:41:58] what's going on but you're in that
[1:42:02] potter's wheel and God begins to work
[1:42:08] with you so I have to go I have to get
[1:42:11] that that that that the clay work could
[1:42:13] be me or it could be molded so I had a
[1:42:17] bucket of water that I need to sprinkle
[1:42:19] I need to sprinkle some grace upon it I
[1:42:24] have to soften the hard knocks
[1:42:27] and one case I have to thought size it
[1:42:29] was water little
[1:42:31] am I gonna give up on this day I'm gonna
[1:42:33] work with this in God's gentle Hansel
[1:42:40] and then in winter when he joined the
[1:42:42] pottery he had to you had to really had
[1:42:45] a good grip cuz we always moving and I'm
[1:42:49] here's the thing I got my head on the
[1:42:52] face and then I also got my hand on the
[1:42:55] top I'm covering this business piece of
[1:42:58] clay to talk to bottom every inch of
[1:43:03] this clay
[1:43:04] my hand is possessing it and his ruler
[1:43:11] on the edges we know we love spending it
[1:43:14] was really rough and wanted to lose all
[1:43:17] similar to come out of his position but
[1:43:19] as the Potter I had to bring it back
[1:43:21] into position
[1:43:24] finally delivered back into position and
[1:43:31] saying a god in it was a serpent that
[1:43:37] whispered something into Eve that took
[1:43:39] her out of position and this same Xing
[1:43:44] it was a prophets message that whispers
[1:43:47] something into your ears that's moving
[1:43:48] you back into position then we are
[1:43:53] spinning even as their wheel spinning
[1:43:57] the powder has to continue to pour water
[1:44:00] so it's notable and little by little the
[1:44:06] powder begins to take form it starts to
[1:44:10] kind of shape up a little bit as its
[1:44:13] spinning and then I'm taking water and
[1:44:17] I'm taking a look at that water then
[1:44:18] there I began to work with the tool we
[1:44:21] could call it the Word of God and so I
[1:44:24] started to scrape the excess clean that
[1:44:27] just didn't belong there
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:31] I was filming this vessel and my whole
[1:44:37] focus my whole attitude was on this
[1:44:40] crane
[1:44:40] so I started to take her this this tool
[1:44:43] I forget what you call now but this this
[1:44:45] tool
[1:44:45] I'm just guys it's spinning the work
[1:44:47] it's spinning around trying to make
[1:44:49] sense of what's going on and I'm taking
[1:44:51] the shade Reutimann and I'm just shaving
[1:44:53] you outside as it's spinning and and
[1:44:56] it's beginning to take form a little bit
[1:44:58] and that's what God was doing all along
[1:45:01] your world is spinning around trying to
[1:45:05] make sense and God says I got you right
[1:45:08] where I want you taking out excess
[1:45:11] unbelief taking out doubt taking out
[1:45:15] this belief if God's just molding you
[1:45:18] into his image the powder in that clay
[1:45:23] is such an intimate exercise where that
[1:45:27] Potter's concentrating all this focus
[1:45:29] upon that clay and you just and it has
[1:45:32] to be and the more against to take form
[1:45:35] the Lord it begins to be censored the
[1:45:40] more you start taking form the more you
[1:45:44] take your position that's what we got to
[1:45:47] when God went looking for abuses Adam
[1:45:49] worked out here we were Adam was it was
[1:45:51] not it's not a question of geography he
[1:45:53] knew where he was but he was just not in
[1:45:55] his position it's like item were you
[1:45:59] yeah you supported you supposed to be in
[1:46:00] church he's supposed to be in fellowship
[1:46:02] where you act you're not in your
[1:46:05] position some people could be sitting in
[1:46:07] church right now and not in their
[1:46:10] position and yet God is looking at you
[1:46:13] and says where art thou I know it talks
[1:46:16] to somebody looking at you but they're
[1:46:17] not listening they're just not in a
[1:46:20] granular yeah yeah yeah but you know
[1:46:22] they ain't paying attention you should
[1:46:24] actually just say what I just say catch
[1:46:26] them off-guard what did you see their
[1:46:28] eyes get bigger like what you thought
[1:46:29] myself
[1:46:30] you'll pay attention there's a
[1:46:32] difference between just because this
[1:46:34] difference between watching hearing and
[1:46:37] listening but I versus blessed are you
[1:46:40] who have ears and can hear because
[1:46:43] there's a lot of people that got ears
[1:46:44] and are even listening they are they
[1:46:47] have eyes but they can't see so the
[1:46:51] Potter begins to work with it and then
[1:46:54] what happens is that as it begins to
[1:46:56] suspend you begin to create this form
[1:46:58] and then you kind of go inside and you
[1:47:00] take your fist and you kind of balled it
[1:47:03] a little bit and then you just slowly
[1:47:05] begin to work on the inside because
[1:47:07] you're making the inside of that vessel
[1:47:08] and so you got a poor little more water
[1:47:11] I use a shaving tune to kind of show you
[1:47:14] a little bit of the excess and then it
[1:47:16] begins to take form and then you keep
[1:47:19] spinning that that will keep spinning
[1:47:21] that will keep spinning and then it
[1:47:23] begins to form and because it's in the
[1:47:26] hands of the Potter it begins to yield
[1:47:29] itself to the Potter over time at first
[1:47:34] it was difficult but then as the Potter
[1:47:38] works with that clay and you know the
[1:47:40] beauty behind it is when I begins to
[1:47:43] work with the clay I'm making pottery if
[1:47:46] it if it didn't look like what I wanted
[1:47:49] it I destroy the whole thing cuz I'm not
[1:47:55] happy but I'm not giving up on this
[1:47:58] train I don't go get another clay I use
[1:48:02] the same line
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:29] takes that clip groups it dances man I
[1:48:33] messed up come sit down
[1:48:35] so we'll start again go through this go
[1:48:38] through the same process again for water
[1:48:41] try to Center it and begin to work with
[1:48:44] me taking your time little by little as
[1:48:49] its as Esther Esther wheels moving the
[1:48:52] clay begins to rise up a little bit so
[1:48:56] you're holding the outside so kind of
[1:48:58] keep its form and then on the inside
[1:49:00] you're working on the inside to take out
[1:49:03] the excess so that we could have the
[1:49:05] outer walls and you begin to work with
[1:49:07] it and then you know what happens as the
[1:49:12] clay has the pottery begins to take
[1:49:15] shape the wheel doesn't need to go as
[1:49:17] fast anymore it starts to slow down
[1:49:20] because you want to be careful it's
[1:49:23] mature now it's gone for the process it
[1:49:28] understands it yields itself to God it's
[1:49:32] so sensitive to the touch of God it's so
[1:49:36] sensitive to the touch of the Potters in
[1:49:39] so you're watching it you slow down the
[1:49:42] wheel and then I would do that just slow
[1:49:44] down a little bit making sure that it
[1:49:46] takes its form and it's looking exactly
[1:49:50] as I envisioned it I don't need to take
[1:49:54] out as many excess because it's grown
[1:49:57] like passes when I was a child I speak
[1:50:00] like a child I talk like a child I felt
[1:50:03] like a child but as I grew up I put
[1:50:06] childish things away and so that clay
[1:50:11] against to look exactly like the image I
[1:50:14] have
[1:50:16] but it's not done yet it now begins to
[1:50:21] look like that very image so we know
[1:50:26] what we to do we let the clay stick
[1:50:29] there a little bit
[1:50:32] that's what brother M says about that
[1:50:35] seed it needs to bask in the Sun ripen
[1:50:40] underneath the Sun a little bit so we
[1:50:45] let back that pot that pottery just sit
[1:50:49] there we'll let it dry a little bit and
[1:50:55] then we take that pottery we begin to
[1:50:59] put in we put in a fiery furnace because
[1:51:04] it could handle the heat it could handle
[1:51:08] the heat put it in that fiery furnace
[1:51:14] bring it out and this is the way we do
[1:51:16] it bring it out you decorate it color it
[1:51:21] paint it we put a certain gloss over it
[1:51:25] we put it back in the trial oh it's a
[1:51:32] trial Saints
[1:51:35] God God takes you out he looks at you
[1:51:38] like our eyes you go back out of that
[1:51:41] yeah and then when we get that in
[1:51:46] product this wasn't I believe in high
[1:51:49] school and we got that end product and
[1:51:51] for the first time we did this and we
[1:51:53] saw that pottery when it came out after
[1:51:57] it's gone through the trial afters and
[1:51:58] you look at it you're just so marveled
[1:52:01] at that artwork that you've done and how
[1:52:05] it looks I was just beside myself I'm
[1:52:09] like this guy this is me as a human
[1:52:12] thing I'm like I did this I could
[1:52:15] probably sell this to make good money
[1:52:17] and was gorgeous the colors just like
[1:52:21] radiant it was like it had a glassy look
[1:52:24] to illness phenomenal and as I as I
[1:52:28] mature to my minister I start thinking
[1:52:30] when God looks at you he said this is my
[1:52:34] creation
[1:52:36] Jesus is the apple of my eyes she
[1:52:40] reflects me I created this this is my
[1:52:42] doing that's the reason why the Bible
[1:52:46] says you're wonderfully and obviously
[1:52:49] made don't let no one take that away
[1:52:54] from you don't let the devil take that
[1:52:58] away from you every time you get up in
[1:53:02] the morning you look at yourself in the
[1:53:03] mirror you say I'm a child of God
[1:53:06] whether you feel like it or not you say
[1:53:10] I'm a child of God and before you go to
[1:53:13] bed no matter how rough the day was you
[1:53:15] say I'm a child of God in closing the
[1:53:24] devil knows who you are when we talk
[1:53:30] about is anything great that could come
[1:53:31] on we have was a harlot who had a
[1:53:35] history who and that the spice came in
[1:53:38] and she worked with the spice to hide
[1:53:41] them she told the spices the kingdom is
[1:53:45] fearful of you we have hardware God did
[1:53:50] when you cross the Red Sea we are hard
[1:53:54] what God did when we defeated the
[1:53:56] enemies we have hard
[1:53:58] did we keep this with you guys so the
[1:54:01] people in this kingdom the official the
[1:54:05] devil knows what God has done in your
[1:54:07] life so when the devil says boo you just
[1:54:14] say boo back let's all stand to our feet
[1:54:20] as we get ready to render service back
[1:54:22] to the brother can anything good come
[1:54:25] out in this generation I believe that
[1:54:32] there will be a bride in this generation
[1:54:36] I believe I am part of that bride do you
[1:54:42] believe that you're part of that bride I
[1:54:46] told the church not my church I was
[1:54:48] visiting the note returned another
[1:54:50] church I say I believe the rapture is
[1:54:52] gonna happen by the end of this week and
[1:54:56] they all looked at me with wide eyes
[1:55:00] they thought I was starting a new
[1:55:01] religion because they will confuse I'm
[1:55:06] like I believe the rapture is going to
[1:55:07] happen by the end of this week and if it
[1:55:10] doesn't I believe is gonna happen by the
[1:55:11] end of this month and if it doesn't I
[1:55:14] believe it's gonna happen by the end of
[1:55:15] the year and if it doesn't I believe
[1:55:17] it's gonna happen by the end of next
[1:55:19] year every day I have an expectation
[1:55:23] gonna happen okay
[1:55:29] I'm looking for the next day but I
[1:55:32] believe I'm going to be part of that
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:40] that's the pure attitude
[1:55:42] day every day in the floral body chain
[1:55:46] I'm trying to go to work I'm tired of
[1:55:50] paying bills I'm tired of getting
[1:55:53] notices in the mail I'm not the only one
[1:55:57] I'm just tired of this life it's so good
[1:56:02] for like April I'm looking for cities
[1:56:04] makeup builders God every day when I get
[1:56:10] up I look forward to second coming
[1:56:14] if all you look forward to is going to
[1:56:17] work and getting a paycheck you'll miss
[1:56:18] understand your purpose in life if all
[1:56:22] you're looking for is to get that car
[1:56:24] get that house get whatever you're
[1:56:25] missing with God has called you for so
[1:56:32] I'll tell you like I told the other
[1:56:33] church I believe before the end of this
[1:56:35] week the rapture is going to happen and
[1:56:39] when I'm back in the rapture has it
[1:56:41] happened I'm gonna say the same thing
[1:56:42] again I believe by the end of this week
[1:56:44] the RAF is gonna happen your faith has
[1:56:48] to be so strong the Bible says faith is
[1:56:50] that substance it's not some mythical
[1:56:55] some aspirational thing the Bible says
[1:56:58] faith is that substance they believe
[1:57:03] that this bow hearts as we turn it back
[1:57:05] to our brother Lord Jesus
[1:57:07] I gave him my heart this morning just
[1:57:12] taking the thoughts that you've put in
[1:57:15] me dear Lord my words may have failed to
[1:57:17] really Express what you've shared with
[1:57:20] me but I pray the inspiration of the
[1:57:23] Holy Spirit would have reached down into
[1:57:25] a heart of soul and that the word would
[1:57:28] have been meaningful to someone in this
[1:57:30] assembly I believe in the reality of
[1:57:34] this word
[1:57:35] and I know the world is falling apart as
[1:57:38] we see it daily to God we read it in the
[1:57:40] papers we hear it in the radio father
[1:57:43] their God but we believe that you're
[1:57:45] bringing a bride together in the midst
[1:57:47] of a world that's falling apart uniting
[1:57:50] us the Lord with that word of truth keep
[1:57:54] us committed to this word this word
[1:57:57] that's called us that's chosen us have
[1:58:00] created a path for us - lord help us to
[1:58:02] maintain that path
[1:58:04] we appreciate the love that you bestowed
[1:58:07] upon us your grace and your mercy - Lord
[1:58:10] we love you with all of our hearts keep
[1:58:15] us still Lord until the appointed time
[1:58:16] when we come back for another moment of
[1:58:19] fellowship but in between those times
[1:58:22] the Lord give us the strength and the
[1:58:24] ability by your grace to press on and
[1:58:27] Jesus Christ and I pray amen god bless
[1:58:31] you sings
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:37] praise the Lord let's give the Lord
[1:58:40] another hand clap of praise praise the
[1:58:50] Lord how many appreciates the message
[1:58:53] Amen my god praise the Lord there's so
[1:59:01] much that brother James said I mean you
[1:59:05] can expound on so much we really do
[1:59:08] appreciate you brother Jean god bless
[1:59:10] you amen we want to keep brother Jean
[1:59:13] brother Jack all of the ministers in
[1:59:15] prayer I mean to see brother Jean come
[1:59:19] up here and speak you look at them in
[1:59:22] amazement sometimes in different
[1:59:24] ministers because you don't see their
[1:59:26] weakness you see men standing anointed
[1:59:30] back here bringing the Word of God to
[1:59:32] you you don't know what they're going
[1:59:33] through when they they leave the doors
[1:59:35] Satan fights them probably a little more
[1:59:39] harder than he fights us so we have to
[1:59:42] lift them up in prayer and all
[1:59:44] all times because they carry great
[1:59:46] burdens I mean they stand up here and
[1:59:48] they don't show weakness because their
[1:59:50] leaders if weakness came across this
[1:59:54] pulpit then the congregation will get
[1:59:56] weak also so they don't ever show what
[2:00:00] they're struggling with and we really do
[2:00:02] appreciate your brother Jean we know you
[2:00:04] go through a lot we're praying for you
[2:00:07] we love you brother
