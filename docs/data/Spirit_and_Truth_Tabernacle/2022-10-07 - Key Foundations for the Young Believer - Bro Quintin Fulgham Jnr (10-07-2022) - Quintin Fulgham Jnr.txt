didn't do all that we went to church we enjoyed ourselves in the church and I'm gonna tell you what made it special is when you saw all your brothers and sisters coming and even when we were younger we didn't have a big youth group we didn't have a huge youth group like not like some of the other churches that we fellowship with man they had big groups but one thing about our group is we was tight we were close right and uh I mean it might have been just a few families but man we we was the young people when we was a young people glory to God and and I can tell you something else about that youth group the majority of that youth group is still holding on [Music] but I but our past or for us where we could we could we could just grow closer to the Lord through things like that so in an after service we go out and fellowship and all that and you know we just we just enjoyed ourselves I I still remember we we shut Perkins down shut Perkins down and remember my wife being a young young lady taking rolls home from Perkins and what you're taking them rolls home for biscuits and stuff but we we used to just enjoy ourselves we hey man it was just it was just wonderful Fellowship

I found was blind but now I as we welcome brother Quentin Jr to the pulpit I made [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen [Music] oh a lot of musicians are playing softball that's about our heads for a word of prayer talk to our God Lord Jesus we come before you bow down oh god um on this Friday O Lord God you see your people have sacrificed their time while we were God to hear from you O Lord Jesus Christ so we ask O Lord that you take control of the atmosphere oh Lord God you anoint all of us O Lord God to to say and to receive O Lord God something that they can take into their hearts O Lord Jesus Christ and and give them Victory O Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord we ask O Lord that you're beautiful so Lord God and bless us all in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen all right thank you musicians all right God bless every single one of y'all um I want to get right into the message because I know it is a little late um if we could pull up the first slide that I have there we go there it is there it is all right so the message that I have for today is called uh key foundations for the young believer I wish I would have had some of these things growing up um I realized I was in a a difficult situation where my parents weren't together and we were between my my mom and my dad and uh my uh dad is there something wrong the noise the sound um but I was in the uh interesting position where I had a believing father uh and my mom was not in the message so going in between two households uh you get mixed messages and that's never good for a young kid you got to have some kind of foundation to that that'll keep you uh and keep you from making uh mistakes there we go and but I am thankful I will say this I am thankful for my mother for some of the decisions she made in my life uh because um I feel I still feel god um can touch people uh uh whether they're in the message or not in the message if you have a heart of reception God can touch you and they can make decisions that can benefit your child amen all right all right so this I have a little uh little work little uh thought right there that I want the young ones to kind of meditate on as I'm going through the message uh it is possible to be young and a Believer uh it's very very important to uh to have that Foundation because you're going to be challenged you're going to be uh it's going to be influences while you're going through school uh and it's going to challenge your faith uh but I want to reassure you that it has to come in order for God to get Glory because uh God is a champion but he needs an opponent and he needs to use somebody in order to show his word amen so I will we can turn to uh Luke Chapter 2 uh we're going to read the verses 39 through 52 but we'll just read 39 through 40. and I'll let you be seated and you can also turn to the next slide um uh so we can look at these foundations so I want to I want I want us to take a look at these foundations as we're going through this journey of Luke 2 uh so you have resolve right you have a resolve you have attitude uh and then you have parents and this parents is going to be kind of wrapped into the attitude part um very very important alrighty so Luke 2. 39 through 40. so it says and when they had perform all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own uh City Nazareth uh this is where Jesus was from him and his his parents and it says and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him and you may take your seats um and it's it's it's really it's really good to look at this verse 40 where it says the child grew and whack strong in spirit right filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him so we had a change going on in the inside as a child right right uh and that's that that's very important so we're going to kind of go on this journey and read on and uh I was gonna uh I wanted to see little Joseph is he here he's coming okay yeah I wanted to have Joseph step up here because as we're reading through this this these uh Bible verses I kind of want to uh I won't have like I want to have a visual and brother Branham did the same kind of thing so we'll look at Josiah for now uh right as to see you know this was how this is around the age Jesus was during this time right um so it says now his parents went to Jerusalem every year the Feast of the Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast so 12 years old and he was considered a child and when they have fulfilled the days as they returned the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it so Jesus as a child stayed behind and his parents went on his parents ain't know anything about it they know what he was doing but later we're going to find out what he stayed behind for right but they supposing him to have been in the company on a Day's Journey instead of traveling uh back home and they sought him among their kin spoke and acquaintances so they thought that he had went to go back home to family he went back to his acquaintances hanging with his friends or or anything like that and in 45 it says and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him so a day journey in and now they're coming back and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple so he found his 12 year old boy in church right so that was a Day's Journey and a Day's Journey back three days almost a week and he's in church yeah as a 12 year old all right I used to think when I was a kid I was like you know how can are you mature enough to serve God is it is it cool to serve God isn't like and here is Jesus and and I could imagine how big Jerusalem was all right and this kid ain't go to the arcade he can go to the skate ring or nothing like that he went straight to church and stayed in church no parents no parents yeah so I want y'all to remember those uh remember those foundations uh what a resolve that you know what I'm going to church um so let's keep on reading and it and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors and I like that where it's sitting in the middle I remember we and uh my brother uh brother Troy who was setting up church and brother uh Troy was talking about going to the front of the church all right and here you have Jesus sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions right and all they heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers so Not only was he in church but he had a revelation about some things he wasn't just going there with his parents he wasn't going there because his parents convinced her nothing but he had a revelation of what it meant to be in church as a 12 year old right I feel ashamed like when I look back at my youth and like wasted time all right and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why has thou dealt with us Behold thy father and I sought these these Sovereign so you can imagine how his parents must have felt uh not seeing their kid for almost a week uh and having lost their kid and And the emotions going through and we're going to see later on uh how um Jesus handled those emotions uh when we read uh a section from the prophet but this is what Jesus said and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me um what a revelation uh we we don't go looking for Jesus Jesus comes looking for us all right uh what a revelation of knowing who he was amen right uh he said wish not that I must be about my father's business what a resolve that he knew why he was going to church not just to be there with his mother and father but he says I have a purpose he had a he was resolved to serve the Lord and the next statement we have here is um let's see and they understood not the saying what she spake unto them that's important right because it shows the reason for him being there ain't come from his parents they didn't come from his parents and I know a lot of us have grown up in church and when we come to church because we're coming with our parents and our parents we want us to you know get your clothes on I can't remember my dad having to force me to iron my pants and get up and get your breakfast it's time to go it's because there was a desire in him for me to go to church but not a Desiring me to want to go to church right and so here we have this this child our Lord and savior at 12 years old in church almost a week no one told him to do it there was a desire on the inside he was resolved to be in the house of the Lord not just to be there sitting but he wanted to be active in it amen and 51 it says and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and here's some more key statements here uh and was subject unto them right they were his parents uh so that we got a rap attitude in there right uh but and then the other key um the key Foundation I had up on there on the slide you don't have to turn to it was parents but look look at this part but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart she recognized there was something special man so she had a job to do and raising this kid all right so being a youth is not you can't do it on your own as a youth and God's depending on you as parents to be there for your kids amen all righty uh so we want to turn to the quote the identification of Christ in all ages um uh it is paragraph It's a 650409 paragraph 120 through 126. writing wait a minute for her to get to there I can start reading while she's yeah okay so 120 we're going to start we're going to start reading this so it says let's see what Jesus was when he come he was the word he was absolutely the word and the word is always corrective so I want you to I want to I want you to recognize that when Jesus told Mary this thing it was not a disrespect he wasn't trying to be mean to her he wasn't trying to embarrass in her but he was the word and the prophet says and the word is always corrective amen it corrects the error although the era don't believe it sometime but the word corrects the air so I can even imagine Jesus and just just for dramatization he sees his mother and he's like The Human Side is that's my mother but there was a word on the inside of him and said hey this is the word all right all right all right so it has to be something on the inside of you so let's let's continue reading so it says look at Jesus at just 12 years old a little boy about this about like this fellow sitting here asleep uh Josiah's not asleep so that's good with the braces on his legs Jesus was a little boy about 12 years old no record where he ever went to school but they went up to the Feast of the Passover and when they or the Feast of Pentecost rather and they went up to the feast Joseph and Mary and all the congregation from down in the city they went to Jerusalem in a three days journey uh presuming he was around with the people some of his kin folk as we read but they missed him they went looking and he wasn't there they went back to Jerusalem and found him in the Temple and so the prophet says that not only uh he was in the temple he was disputing with the priests he was disputing with those men those men so he was he was in the temple uh correcting right he was in the temple defending the faith right they don't mean that you know you have some more some more uh Minister say something Jesus like no no it doesn't mean that uh brother Branham has said he was breaking up their denominations so this child had a resolution on the inside of him that my purpose is to see the word of God fulfilled and what y'all are doing ain't right at 12 years old right amen all right notice here not to hurt you Catholic people but you who take who who take Mary for a goddess or intercessor looky here she gave a testimony right so right so um so Jesus was not doing this uh like he was not doing this to be uh disrespectful attitude with his mother nothing she gave a testimony watch her watch her condemn her own testimony she said your father and I have sought you with tears right feelings look what she did she condemned her own testimony she caught she was calling Joseph his father but watch just a kid just a little boy and and this is what I was saying before as I can imagine Jesus just looking up at his mother and him seeing his mother and you know as a kid you give respect to your parents there's always some there always be something inside you that is like this is my parents so you should be careful about what you say right he said just a kid just a little boy but the word always corrects the air there was something inside him that said hold on this isn't right and he valued that word over his mother's feelings as a child what resolve said know you not that I must be about my father's business the word spontaneously see corrected the error she said your father and I Joseph and we're reading to 126 okay your father and I Joseph right before those priests who she had already told that she was conceived by the Holy Ghost and here she had testified and identified Joseph being his father condemning her own testimony so Jesus was actually there to help her to say hold on a second that wasn't your testimony that wasn't the faith God gave you amen your child can help you but watch the word pick it up he was the word in the beginning he was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh into other Among Us the word picked it up and corrected the error right and so we're going to finish reading uh this last verse um and we see through all of these things we see Jesus having resolve going to church wanting to be around God's people and stand for the truth uh uh and then and the Bible says that he went back to Jerusalem as was subject into his parents right and it says and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man and I know you young ones you know you want to have a future you want to have a career you want to have money you want to have goals uh but there's a path to get there right there's a path to get there uh and it says here that Jesus increased because of those things that he did all right so we're going to go to my next slide which should be uh the next slide let's see here um it's gonna uh it's gonna say conviction but that's that's incorrect yeah so the next slide basically I have a resolve and we want to look at the definition for this thing and the Oxford language it says resolve set is uh means decide firmly on a course of action or firm determination to do something Jesus as a child as a 12 year old kid was so determined to do the work of the father that he left his parents for almost a week ain't worried about what he was going to eat ain't worried about it taking a shower you know as some kids you know you expect your kid your mom and dad to fix you something to eat to get you ready get your clothes ready and all this thing he wasn't worried about none of that he was so resolved to go into the house of the Lord to fulfill the word of God uh and uh that that resolve is something that each one of us have to have and as you young ones are starting out you are blessed to be in a position where uh you can increase in wisdom and actually not having not have to deal with many problems as the older ones have had to deal with you are in a very very blessed position amen all right so um our resolve as we're going to stay on this one right here and now it says conviction but resolve is the word uh the foundation that we're going to touch upon right now so our resolve uh should be the same as Jesus he was an example from us all from birth to death from predestination to Restoration and if we follow that path we'll have the same exact results you don't have to do you don't have to think of anything you don't have to think of a new way you don't have to do anything new you just got to follow Jesus right and the result in the resolve of a young believer if we want to follow Jesus the resolve of a young believer should be to be about your father's business not your physical father but your heavenly father right that means you should want to be in church and if you don't like to be in church you need to pray to God Lord give me a desire to want to be in church all right because that's how Jesus was as a child right um you should have a desire to talk about the things of God uh Jesus as a 12 year old as a 12 year old child was talking talking to doctors people of High esteem and wasn't afraid right and that's also a challenge for us older ones uh we should want to the youth to talk to us about things a lot of times we can uh for uh we can brush them off you hear them you hear them say something and like they don't know what they're talking about be careful because that may be God right speaking through a child amen so you know we shouldn't we shouldn't say uh uh talking about God and I experienced these experiencing things as I was a youth about you know talking about God as born and my dad would try to get us to wake up um and do like devotions and you're tired and you know it's all boring to you uh but don't allow Satan to put that into your mind it's never boring to talk about your creator right because you didn't get here on your own and you're going to need him when you leave right all right yes amen all right so this Foundation cannot be stressed enough having a resolve and the thing about having a resolve is it's got to come from God it can't come from your family it can't come from your mom it can't come from your dad it can't come from your friend it can't come from the pastor it's got to come from God right uh and this is one of the foundations that a lot of Youth in church fall from uh you know when you're raised in church uh and and your parents are earnestly wanting you to see this truth right and a lot of uh you for uh will fall from this thing uh in their teenage years or in their adult years I can say that um I was one that fell or was in and out because of my situations and I'm sure a lot of uh other older Saints can uh say that they may have not stayed the course um but if we want if we turn to the next slide here and it says reasons why people uh but young believers will fall from their resolve you got peer pressure you've got knowledge and the reason I put knowledge here and I said or the increase in knowledge is because when you're young your knowledge will increase and it's a great blessing but it can be a great curse if you don't know how to use it amen and then we got the third one which is worldly fun and the reason I put worldly on there is because there's nothing wrong with having fun but it's got to be sanctified amen amen Hallelujah all right so let's we're going to tackle this first point uh peer pressure uh and peer pressure is so big now with all the social media even I didn't have this much social media growing up as a kid where you're you're seeing lives and you're seeing a projection of lives and stuff and it's enticing to want to be the same even from the Christian worlds you know you have a lot of these artists uh singing um and brother Jack had preached about it one time you have a lot of these Christian artists singing with tattoos and brother Branham called it like sensationalism not even worshiping God that's a scary thing to be in because you can see they're doing it with all their heart it's not like they're not wanting to worship God because it takes some sort of resolve and conviction uh to stand for God but you want a full resolve D not partial right all righty all right so um now we're going to uh let's let's attack this peer pressure uh and to battle peer pressure uh one of your resolves is you have to you have to ask yourself who do you want to be associated with who do you want in your circle right if you cherish your friends in the world uh you're gonna fall right you can't serve two Gods at the same time uh and the reason being is because um God wants to help you with every single step of your of your Christian walk not just your Christian walk but your spiritual walk and God wants to help you and give you strength but if you hold it on to two Gods God can't give you his full strength so there's going to be a fight and because he can't give you his full strength you don't know if you're going to come out amen right so you have to have a resolve to figure out where you want who you want to be associated with in your circle and if our example is Jesus when he was 12 years old he wanted to be associated with the Saints in church that's where he went to when he was in the city when he got lost he didn't go hang out with friends his parents thought he was with family but he had a resolve that says no I want to be with the Saints in church as a 12 year old no peer pressure could come to him right right you have to have a firms you also have to have a Firm Stance on who you want to impress and look up to right so if you want to look up to people in the world if you want to look up to the worldly Idols uh you're going to have a hard time uh battling peer pressure trying to be a believer because God doesn't look up to those people all right amen amen and so uh uh and Jesus himself he looked up uh even though he went to church and he was uh battling those peoples uh people I believe he still had a respect uh because he was there right right and your resolve has to be about your father uh then you would want to be around his people it's a natural desire amen and that is one way to battle uh combat peer pressure because when you are resolved and you affirming your belief that I want to be about the father's business uh God will put the desire inside of you to want to be around his people until you wouldn't want to be around anybody else amen now all peer pressure isn't bad um it's just pressure but it depends on where that pressure is coming from uh Now esther uh we uh the pastor's been preaching about Esther and Esther is a good example of good peer pressure so she had just become Queen and here comes Mordecai pressuring her hey you got to take some action right and depending on how you look at that as a young believer you may you may receive pressure from your pastor you may receive pressure from you from your uh from your uh families in church your church family or your own family and you have to ask yourself why is the pressure coming so when Esther uh uh received that pressure from Mordecai the reason that Mordecai is pressuring her was to save God's people wow right so she was pressured accepted the pressure and in that she became a type of Christ yes so not all peer Pro all peer pressure is bad it just depends on what are they pressuring you to do and when you receive that pressure it's okay to question Bible says to try the spirit see if it be of God when you receiving pressure ask yourself what does the Bible say about this right if someone's pressuring you to drink what does the Bible say about drinking if someone's pressuring you to smoke what does the Bible say about these things and then your question is answered no more pressure you can ignore it amen oh yeah uh and even uh an example that I gave before with Jesus receiving pressure even from his mom when his mom his own mother uh was telling him uh hey me and your father we were worried about you uh the respect that he had from his mother but the word inside of him as the prophet said he was the word he had to say hold on a second that's not right right so you even press even the Press you received from your parents has got to be from God you got to make sure that it's from God and if it's not from God you can choose God and it's not no it's no longer an attitude or disrespect you're standing for God and God's Gonna Stand For You amen so let's uh let's turn to uh there's a um there's a quote in the message of uh respects 61 paragraph 65 to 68. let's pull this up all right I can just start reading it and then the prophet says strange after they had seen all those signs happen and then they come to the Red Sea and found out that the very God that it performed all those signs here at the Red Sea doubted God the very first thing that he was able to make a way of Escape he had showed them that he was able to make a wave Escape through this great Victory not only not only the victory at the Red Sea at the Red Sea but he also swallowed up uh the army of the Egyptians which was the most powerful Nation at that time as we can think of the United States or Russia that's how they viewed Egypt and they had seen this with their very own eyes now there's where we make our mistake I want a little sickness right they had seen this big thing but when a little sickness strikes us when a little disaster or a little trouble strikes somewhere in a way then we go Falling Away and here he says a young convert somebody will make fun of him say Well you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller no they don't say holy roller now today they don't say holy roller now today but it's not cool to be a Christian all right it's not cool to be a Christian and see the attitude of this other this of this believer well I hate to be called a Holy Roller you see you see there you are you get that doubt right so when you have a resolution that is giving you given to you by God when you believe that you can't make it you're doubting God you're doubting God that God can take you through the peer pressure you're doubting him that God Can Make A Way of Escape so that you can continue to stand Victorious and that's one thing that God doesn't like God doesn't like cowards because then it makes him look weak and he's not weak it's not in his character amen alrighty so let's um all right so and all right so now we have the next thing on here uh and that's peer pressure now we have the next thing which is knowledge or the increase in knowledge um and the prophet had described this as uh when you gain knowledge you're climbing up the tree of knowledge uh and all of us older ones know what the tree of knowledge is and who it is so you have to be careful when you're climbing up this tree you have to have spiritual guidance right when you're climbing up the tree because when you don't have spiritual guidance it's what we call a life gamble you're flipping a coin on the choices of your relationships of your job of your of the direction you want to take you're taking a life Gamble right all right so an example is um of a young one and only reason I say these things to y'all is because I did them too all right so I'm guilty of them too but an example we hear is uh that's how y'all got that's how y'all guys did it when you were young or it's different in our day right you're taking on knowledge and trying to uh uh um create a path uh now those statements are not they're not they're not all they're not all false right there's some truth to it all right but when you're climbing up the tree of knowledge and you're looking for truth as a Believer you don't want some truth some truth will still get you in trouble right you want all truth all Truth uh will have you have will leave you to a Victorious Life and even when you get in hard times like job you'll still come out on top better than you did before so you don't want some truth all right and that's why you need a spiritual guide to climb this tree uh and there's the Paradox in this thing uh when you're making decisions and using this knowledge that you're that you're gaining uh there's a paradox in that uh uh good and evil is so close the decision you're making is so close yet it's night and day uh you know if you would take for an example a coin let's say you uh you have a coin right uh and this coin had to say head represents good and Tails represents evil right and just one flip you can land on either side when it's you trying to use your knowledge and make decisions all right and uh the thing about the coin uh and it's amazing how God has designed things in our world is that in order to see one for one to fully see one side you gotta cover up the other one right so if you want God to make decisions for your life like a lot of Believers want to you have to cover up fully cover up the side uh God is not a god of in between amen he didn't design for a coin to be flipped in land on in between a decision no it's got to fall one way and if you want God to be your spiritual God as you're gaining knowledge and it increases it means you have to check back with him it what do you think about this Lord what do you think about this friend what do you think about this job what do you think about this church Lord I see that car what do you think about me getting that car a lot of times we make decisions from our head but God looks at the heart amen amen he ain't looking at just what you see and what your imaginations imaginations get you in trouble it's one of the reasons why the fall came amen but God is looking at your heart to see if you have this thing what's going to happen in the future right so to further illustrate this thing of this concept of uh you're flipping the coin you're making the decision and right or wrong are so close let's say God blesses a brother in the church uh what a mansion it gives them a Olympic pool big yard nice cars everything and God has blessed them and you usually can tell God has blessed someone when they give back right so now he's inviting all the people in church over to his house for a meetings or whatever and then as one brother comes up and he's just admiring right he's just admiring how God has blessed them and there's nothing wrong with admiring things right there's nothing wrong with admiring things uh then he comes over again and he's doing some more admiring and he's like you know I wish I wish I had that house comes back over again you know I wish I had that pool comes back over again I wish I had that long uh and now he's late home to his wife and this is just a story just to dramatize right now he's coming home late to his wife and his wife's like honey why why are you 10 minutes late from home you know she's going to know and he he's like you know just taking another route and what he's doing he's going by the brother's house so you see something's happening inside of his heart but he's in his head yeah and he's looking at this brother's house he's like you know what I could take out a loan and get a house just like that brother amen so now he's using knowledge but he ain't consult God because if he would have turned to God God said you don't need none of that you got some Envy you're jealous of your brother wow right but in his mind he thinks he's making a good decision because he can take out a loan he can go and get this house I can get these things I can obtain these things but he's not looking at the decision from his heart right Let's uh another another uh important one uh sacrifice and compromise uh so what we just talked about was at admiring which is on one side of the coin uh in Envy which is on the other side of the coin and now we're going to look at sacrifice and compromise and let's say you have a sister in church and she's interested in a brother and she comes to her pastor hey interested in this guy right and pastor's asking some questions and like yeah what is what is this church situation well he goes to church on Sunday but he don't go on Wednesday and in a good pastor will be like um what's going on here is it is it uh a job is he working it's like no he just don't like to go to church on Wednesday all right uh and a good pastor a good spiritual guy will be like I don't know about that one right but in her mind she's in love and she's read online that sometimes you gotta sacrifice for things right online read online you see that knowledge is increasing for her to be able to go and try to make a decision on her own you got to be careful about that knowledge it'll challenge your resolve amen and so because she's in love right she's in love she thinks she's in love She's going to sacrifice uh not knowing uh that yeah it's true you sacrifice in relationships but there's a difference between sacrifice and compromise you don't compromise your beliefs for anybody right and if he if he needs any kind of sacrifice uh there was one provided on the cross two thousand years ago tell them brother tell the brother there's a sacrifice there and then he'll know exactly what you're talking about then he'll be worthy to be a husband all right but you see you have to be careful about those decisions that you make right because you'll be flipping a coin if she had listened to her pastor her spiritual God and of course the pastor a true God called Pastor is looking out for your best interests so the first thing he's going to do he's going to think about it and then he's going to go on his knees and God's gonna say hey on tell her that's not the one I've been trying to tell her tell her that's not the one and then it's up to you to listen amen it's up to you to listen amen so the next thing that we have here uh is worldly fun right uh and just to give some definitions of fun uh you have enjoyment Amusement light-hearted pleasure amusing entertaining enjoyable uh and then uh you have the world's definitions of parties drinking drugs uh romantic Affairs which is sin it's not fun that's why it's important to get your uh your definitions right lined up with the word amen it's important to get your emotions lined up with the word and I don't and I say this as a way to to not to frighten you or nothing like that because I made a lot I made some decisions I made choices where you're going to know you're going to parties and it's like what's the point of it uh there's no point in it all right um all right so and then you then you have what I call the tree and knowledge fund uh which is like going to a basketball game playing Uno uh treating knowledge fun or it ain't bad depending on what's in your heart right and I know um brother Jack had been preaching about this thing uh he has said there ain't gonna be no golf in heaven and I thought about that thing and it's like oh yeah it's true we have to get back to the original definition no I'm not saying playing Uno or basketball is a sin I'm not saying none of that is a sin is fine to do those things but what I want to do or what I want to place in your heart is what God's original definition of fun is because that's what's going to last all right so let's go to some Bible verses here we have Genesis uh chapter 2 verse 8 through 15. all righty and I'll start reading while she pulls it up wait for everyone to get to there so we want to look for the definition of fun uh in God's word and it says here in the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he formed that's fun a garden [Laughter] God said it so it's fun amen it ain't say he planted a basketball court or anything like that a garden and there he put man who he formed let's keep on reading and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant in the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and a river went out of eat into the water to water the garden and from then so his party became the four heads the the name of the first one is pyson uh there which encompassed the land of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that land is good you ain't got to buy it you don't gotta save up for it you don't gotta put it in a chain or anything like that it was there for you uh there is uh the Liam and the Onyx Stone and the name of the second river is gihon the same as that Compass of the whole land of Ethiopia so this is a pretty big Garden pretty big garden and the name of the third river is hideko that is which goes toward the east of Assyria and the fourth river is Euphrates and the Lord God took the man put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it that's fun that's what God's definitions are fun and and I'm not saying don't play basketball I ain't trying to turn it into a doctor nothing like that but the purpose of God is for restoration that means I was always a gardener I ain't I ain't like to play basketball I ain't used to like to play basketball I liked being in the garden amen [Laughter] alrighty and so we have a quote here just to kind of reiterate that uh in Revelations chapter uh it's a it's in Revelation chapter five number two uh paragraph 243 alrighty now just start reading this watch she pulls it up um uh the prophet says but we have an Incorruptible inheritance meaning that it ain't going anywhere meaning that no one can take it away from us it's Everlasting and everlasting and everlasting and everlasting Everlasting all right that is salvation Redemption go back to the Garden of Eden go back that was our fun an Incorruptible fun think of it Lord think of it Lord who wouldn't want to go back to like Adam and Eve and live back there our food provided each day every single day a heavenly father and and think about this one a heavenly father always along the trail talking to us see that great light walking before us the lion and the Wolf feeding together Bullock eating his straw the lion eating with them and now they eat one another or the lions eat the Bullock and the wolves eat the eat the Bullock and just think about that and I know that you're that you're young and you're going to mature but as you begin to mature I want to place things in your heart so that you think about these things as you grow in your Christian walk so that they'll latch on uh you think about man these wolves out here and lions out here killing sheep and stuff like that while we playing basketball but in the beginning where there was no basketball uh they were having fun with each other right but them days it won't be that way the Beautiful the great beautiful birds flying there'll be no no sorrow there'll never be a marker that we passed over our hopes down along the trail there we see our children our loved ones oh God what a day what a day no matter what we receive here on Earth it's it's all going to fade away but that won't fade away so I just want to put it into your hearts uh uh the original definition of fun and there's nothing wrong with doing those things like playing you know and stuff like that but there is an original but those things uh uh it's almost insatiable or it's almost uh it's it's never it you got to come back and play you got to come back and play there's there's no uh um contentment or in it but man was in a garden planting trees and was content amen amen so the pressures uh so just to kind of go over these three uh points now the pressures you receive from your peers are going to challenge your resolve uh the knowledge you gain as you get older is going to challenge your result you can't trust yourself The Temptations of the world definition of fun are all going to challenge your resolve but thankfully we have an example in the Bible of Jesus Christ as a 12 year old overcoming that all so that we can have somewhere to point back to in our time of trouble when we're dealing with these things and say Lord here I'm standing you did it before now you have to do it again and uh there's one thing that God will always do he'll always come and back his word it's it's one of the things he always rushes to come do so you can trust trust God in that one all righty so we're gonna go to the next the next point uh in the next slide um so resolve uh is something that you have to get from God this has to be something you can't come from your parents can't come from your pastor this is all you that's all you you and your Revelation with God uh the next one here is your attitude right uh attitude is the one that needs a lot a lot of work even older folks I can I believe a lot of older people can say you know a lot of times we say oh kids man they just got all these attitudes man you get older you still have attitude it's still there learn to tackle it when you're young so when you're older you don't get yourself in trouble all right uh and so um I just want to get the definition of attitude and I like this definition of attitude that I found online um let me see uh right here it says a subtle way of thinking or feeling about someone or something typically one that is reflected in a person's Behavior so your attitude directly affects your actions right we can say attitude is a good indicator of where you're headed in life you can tell uh uh uh the path someone is on by their attitude about things uh one of the things about me is um and dad that'll tell you this my dad will tell you this when I was in church and didn't want to be in church you could see the attitude and you can see this Brothers ain't headed around a good direction but then when I gave my life to God now I'm singing and rejoicing in God you can see the attitude of the person and say oh wow I can see they headed in the right direction right so your attitude is a good indicator of where you're heading in life and and like I said when you follow these principles for God not only does it affect your spiritual life but it affects uh your physical life and you'll find yourself in positions where uh um you may be in a uh in a negative or in a down position but because of your attitude people are more willing to help you get ahead just because your attitude not because you're qualified not because of how smart you are uh but because of your attitude there's something on the inside of them that they reach out to and that's why I believe God your attitude in God I believe he he checks that thing that's one of the things he checks with his children all right so and what do I mean by attitude and there's two statements up here you have attitude towards instruction and guidance attitude towards instruction and guidance and in attitude and circumstances very very very important all right your attitude towards instruction and guidance uh the Bible says that we are Gods right and we've brother Jack has been preaching that thing uh it's important to make sure that you look at the the words though and it's a little G right there's a little G there for a reason right yes it's because that little G is a signification that we are in a position to receive instruction and guidance scripturally we were designed to receive instruction and guidance even though we are God hallelujah God now when you're Big G you don't need any instruction or guidance because you're above it before there was instruction and guidance God was amen amen amen amen so there's a hierarchy of order right there's a hierarchy of order uh and we have to go through that we have to go through this life uh um in it and that order is uh uh obedience and subjection all right uh it's not a bad thing I was talking with his brother today uh at the barbershop and he was saying uh uh in order to get the power of God you have to give up your will so obeying and following guidance and instruction is actually not weakness you actually receive strength you actually get strength uh to go through any situation that you're dealing with if you find yourself struggling with something ask what is my attitude what am I obeying am I obeying something am I not obeying something or I am not subject to something if you find yourself going from job to job losing job ask yourself if I'm not subjecting myself all right to my boss all right if you find yourself going from teacher to teacher to teacher you got to ask yourself am I not obeying something am I subjecting myself to something amen yeah uh and and and like I was saying God God doesn't want to rule over your life just for the fun of it just to pick on you just to show that he's God that's not the way God thinks that's how man tries to rule which is a false uh a false ruling false type of ruling right because it's for selfishness uh there's a purpose between behind God wanting you to subject yourself and um uh and to be and to be obedient and we can see it in the life of Jesus uh I believe a quote I think brother jackass said a quote uh where um or it was a message that I heard where uh brother Branham said that Jesus could have had a wife and he had a desire to have a wife and a family so he had this desire as a human being to want to have a wife to want to have someone to love to be in love and God wanted him to give that up and it was a hard thing for God to do because when it came to the time of the cross it said that when he prayed he he bled he wanted to live it was a sign that he wanted to live it's not always easy giving up your will but he gave up his will nonetheless not only did God get uh give him a bride he gave him a mini bride he gave him many the prophet said uh God God took him up in a vision and he went up into the heavens and he said is Paul here is Peter here he said yep he said I know I'll be here and uh there were Millions upon millions that said we're resting on that not only did God give my wife he gave him many a wife not only did God give him a family he gave him a big family because he laid his will down it's always a blessing to knowing your will down God wants to give you something better God Amen right and an any Godly parent will want to be the exact same and giving your uh on your child something better so I was wearing this shirt that says Rad a really awesome dad and a lot of people uh picking on me for that uh but I was telling them by faith I'm going to be a really awesome dad and I began to think about that thing because it's like you know what that's exactly how God was in in the beginning or before the foundation of the world before anything uh God had a desire to be a father not only did he have a desire to be a father he said I'm going to be a good father I'm going to be a great father to my kids I'm going to take care of them and uh and it's a type of us right because my kids are in me right now right my kid or if she's a daughter if she if she's my son his strength is inside of me if he's a smart kid or if she's a musician right if she's a musician she's already inside of me right uh not only that but her attitude is inside of me uh her downfalls inside of me and she's still my child [Music] it don't matter about the negative she's still my child so as a parent uh sometimes uh you don't you don't ever look and a lot of parents fail this and I know I'm out of place in saying this because I don't have a kid but a lot of parents do fail because I do watch videos about you got this thing called free-range parents or just let their kids do anything and it just don't sit well with me right uh because a lot of times you have to not want to be your friend be a friend to your kid because they're your child uh there's more love in being a child because the Bible says uh we were born in sin shaping iniquity come to the world speaking lies the prophet said we were an enemy of God not a friend but we were still a child still a child so sometimes you can't be a friend of your to your kid you got to be a father which means you got to love them through whatever they're dealing with to whether do the rough times the bad times the attitudes you gotta love them through it gotta love them through it to show uh God's love right all right so let's turn to Ephesians it's a lot of Bible verses but it's good go to Ephesians 6 1. I'll be closing in a little Fusion six all right we're going to read from verses one to four to kind of go over what we just what I just spoke about so children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise a commandment with promise we talked about paying tithes and how God would bless you and rebuke the Devourer this commandment over here of honoring thy father and mother comes with the promise as well that promise is that it may be well with the and thou mayest live long on the earth I was meditating about this thing and uh the prophet has said something so profound he said outside of Salvation the greatest thing that you could get uh is a wife or a husband and not to start a Doctrine or anything like that but I would say if there's anything greater outside of a wife it's to honor your father and mother because this promise that you have is directly tied to life and Earth and the natural types of spiritual so there's an eternal life and then there's a physical life and This Promise is Type To Life and it's one where it's very very important because what I feel what I believe is as children obey your parents it says parents in the Lord so parents you got to be in the Lord all right don't make it hard right don't make it hard all right but it's what it says children obey your parents in the Lord here God is typing your parents to God because if it's in the Lord It's of God and it was always of God so and there's a Bible verse that says uh how can you love your brother how can you God say how can you love me who you've not seen and not love your brother who you have seen so how can you say you love God and you respect God and you honor God and you don't honor your father and your mother it's a type right it's a type uh and you have to be careful uh uh about your attitudes towards types uh uh systemita um there was an issue of uh they were having with I think little Joseph where he had did something wrong and systemita brother Branham came home and she was like Bill tear him up tear him up and the prophet of being the kind of man that he was was like don't nah don't just leave him alone he done beat himself up he beat himself up he's crying right now he doesn't beat himself up he don't need nothing else and she got all upset at him and had an attitude so this is for old people too and God saw the attitude and said hold on a second there's a there's a type here and you gotta respect it you can't say you love God and disrespect his type you can't say you love God and disrespect his types uh in fact people receive eternal life by the respect of God's type the Bible said if you give one of these little ones a drink of water I save you uh and it's they didn't know who it was but because it was a type that type had a promise to it amen all right um you know so you got to be careful about uh uh your attitude towards types and your parents is a type your pastor is also a type A a type of God as the head of the church right so you have to be careful about your attitude towards your pastor all right uh uh there were two people that had a um and it looks like there's always family problems because uh the prophet uh Jesus said a prophet is not respected in his own uh town and then you had another Prophet who has some more family members and they were accusing them of who he married and stuff like that and God told them he said tell Marion Aaron to come to my tent and he said hey I talked to Moses from mouth to ear right any and he punished them because of their attitude towards Moses they thought they were looking at just their brother right they thought they were just looking at their brother amen and a lot of times even me even me now a lot of times we think we're just looking at our parents right but if it's in the Lord it's a god there's God hid in the vessel and you disrespect The Vessel you're disrespecting God you got to be careful you have to be careful um just to get kind of give another example of uh your attitude uh towards instruction guidance and like I said none of this is just to punish you or or to tell you it's to bring you down it's to bless you right um a parent in the Lord is going to ensure the success for your life they'll ensure the success for your life they're they were put there as a guide and God gave them that commission uh when he fills them with the spirit to be a good parent because that's who he is right so and I wanted to kind of give an example illustrate this thing um you know um I remember I had this girlfriend that I had when I was young and you know and I thought I was just so in love with her right and I was believing the message and everything and I told my dad about it and my dad just ain't have no reaction and I knew he didn't approve of it and that made me upset that made me upset uh but what I did not see was the god behind him and what God was looking at amen and so a lot of times you can be arguing with your parents your parents tells you say hey don't be some guy flirting with your uh flirting with one of the one of our young sisters your parents like hey don't hang around him don't hang around him and you have an argument uh and you think that you're uh arguing with your parents uh but the Bible says uh we don't wrestle with flesh and blood but with spiritual wickedness so you got to be careful about your attitude and your arguments at where they're being directed because it could be a spiritual battle that you're having on the inside and you got to redirect that attitude right amen I would and I want to give a a a testimony about my mom um even though she wasn't fully in the message uh she loves God and I can say um as uh growing up she was strict I mean she was strict we used to live in this uh neighborhood which was really really bad neighborhood and I was hanging out with a friend next door and my mom had no issue with it as soon as she found out that he was uh dealing with drugs she ain't let me hang out with him no more and you get upset you know you're a kid you get upset and it got to the point where she ain't let us go outside anymore and you just feel like you just stuck in this house and you're just doing the same things over and over and over again uh not knowing that it's protection not knowing that it's protection because you don't understand something so when you try to climb that tree of knowledge it'll fool you in thinking that you're okay and so my mom continued that she ain't really let us go outside she ain't let me go to parties uh and as all and I was so ready to get out of the house so ready to get out of the house uh but I can stand and say now and I tell her this all the time I'm like Mom thank you when I see people uh that I grew up with and the situations that they're in and the relationships that they're in uh uh not good relationships I can look back and say Mom thank you thank you for that thank you for that amen my mom my mom had had enough of God in her heart to project that kind of love right so we want to also continue reading uh this fourth verse I'll just go ahead and read this uh in Ephesians 1 6 1 4 and it's any fathers provoke not your children to Wrath but bring them up in a nurture an admonition of the Lord I just had to say that one I just had to say that one because [Laughter] I want the youth to know I'm not on any sides I feel like I'm in a good position I'm 31 years old I've been under subjection of parents and I don't have children yet because I feel like you know when you're a chill your child your team you tend to lean toward that direction and when you're a parent you tend to lean towards that direction but there's a balance in these things and that's why we have to read the word and let God come through and make the decisions right so you don't want to provoke your child to wrath uh uh it says but to bring them up and nurture and admonition of the Lord and we want to just look up those definitions of nurture real quick uh uh and nurture I just have it on here uh and nurture means uh care for and encourage the growth or development of um that one's very very important and it's and I'm glad I bought that shirt and I was just thinking in my head by faith I'm gonna have a kid uh and it's a challenge for me right uh because before and for some of you that are married and not have kids yet or you have baby kids this one will be really good for you when you think about God having his own kids he didn't just pop them out first he spoke light and then he had to wait and he had to wait and he had to wait and he had to wait but in his whole mind and his weight and he's like I got kids coming I got kids coming I got kids coming I don't know maybe I gotta develop some patience because I see them going through a red sea and they're going to be complaining I'm gonna need it so just all right cut him off hey man right and the next thing you know he created a earth he created animals he provided food the Bible says they ate the prophet said they ate daily right he had gold for his kids all right so he had things for them uh he prepared these things before they came before they came right so I feel as a parent uh in order for you to uh to care for or nurture someone you got to be prepared to do it or it's going to be a struggle right so for the ones that just have kids or you don't have kids and you're waiting be patient and prepare yourself for when they come right because uh it's and it's good to look at things from a scriptural standpoint and from God's eyes uh because as we see in the life of Jesus uh and I believe even Mary kind of took is that she took that to his heart when he said that thing to recognize that wasn't her property that child wasn't her property it was God's Property and so she had a role in raising it up the Bible said he was subject unto them and Jesus being the word you knew they had to be Godly Parents because the word can only be subject to the word not just any kind of parents they had to be Godly Parents and he was subject onto them and look at the success in his life amen all right and so the next point the last one before closing uh is your attitude and circumstances uh this one is very very uh very very important um I just give a little example of before I close um I know some people have been in this situation where uh and not everyone is blessed to have Godly Parents uh some youth on the internet uh you may be in a position where you're believing and your parents are not believing uh but I would encourage you to have a good attitude in those circumstances um I it's it it's good intentions you can't have a bad attitude and good intentions uh a good intention a bad attitude tends to spoil those good intentions and so I you know I would I would think you know about my mom growing up and you know you make mistakes and a lot of Youth out here uh older youth may may say this thing where you think you know you know what I'm gonna do that better than what my mom did it's not a good attitude to have uh the right attitude to have the correct attitude to have is you know she's trying her best you know I'm going to love her anyways I may not agree with this thing what that does is it builds character and character inside of you to be able to use it later but if you have an attitude and you don't build nothing and all sudden your kids come along you don't have nothing to give them and you'll be the same exact way and that's why you have these Cycles repeat repeat repeat repeat and then it's just a child I'm gonna be better than you bad attitude the child comes out I'm gonna be better than you bad attitude and it takes God to come in and say hold on a second let's check this attitude right love them regardless so that you're building something for yourself so that is that that is a very very very very important point alrighty and I want to um in closing I want to pull up uh yeah it's getting late um in closing I want to pull up a uh it's a a quote from water from the rock right um uh 55 uh and it's I think paragraph I think I wrote 143. 143 to 145. uh and this is for you this is really this is a youth meeting this is for the Youth I want you to be encouraged I want you to uh to realize uh that you don't have to do things by yourself uh uh God is more willing to help you than you want to be helped and and one of the things that I um I remember some a pastor's wife had said something to me and I believed it for a while until I kind of read this quote and kind of meditated on meditated about it in my heart about you know you got to be mature enough to receive the Holy Spirit at a certain age I don't think that's right right because that signifies you doing something that signifies you gaining knowledge to do something about it uh uh Salvation is a free gift from God he don't care how old you are you don't care how much you know or what you don't know you don't care how much you have or what you don't have but if you have a desire in your heart and you ask God what regardless of how old you are God will uh uh God will save you God will save you and will strengthen you in wisdom right and in stature uh uh and and you'll have favor of God and man from a young age is a blessing so let's uh read this quote in closing uh God bless you Sister back there to my right you now have received everlasting life and perishable life so this is the prophet you know God uh using discernment and he's seeing these things uh God come to your heart knocked at your door said if you let me in I'll give you life you raised your hand to him saying here you are Lord he can't cast you away this is important he'd have to repudiate his word he'd have to say something that wasn't right he can't he's God he has to keep his word all right and this is the key part oh I see two more God bless you there children Jesus sees your hand not your maturity not how much you know in the word uh uh uh not how much you understand or how much you know or what you don't know it just said I see two more God bless you children Jesus sees your hand God bless your little hearts little boys about 12 years old and you say well does he see that child yes and over to my left I see the little hand over in there I believe a little Mexican girls God bless you honey he gives you everlasting life right now foreign you have life as sure as I'm a minister behind the pulpit amen so uh going back to our original thought is it possible to be young and a believer it is possible not only is it possible you can flourish you can grow in wisdom you can grow in stature you can be filled with his spirit you can be anointed for service for work as a child amen so um as we kind of uh kind of close the service uh it's kind of a bow our heads and a word of prayer real quick Lord Jesus you've used these uh clay lips

Lord God oh Lord God you're the god that never changes O Lord God and Lord they need You O Lord God they may not be mature enough to to see the pitfalls in the way they may not be mature enough to understand all of life's mysteries oh Lord God but that does not stop you from coming in oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord we ask that you would establish them oh Lord Jesus Christ we ask that you would strengthen them oh Lord God so that when they get older oh Lord God it is well Lord God they can look back and say Lord just as in the life of Jesus you've been with me from the start yeah there will be mistakes made oh Lord Jesus Christ but if you're the same yesterday and forever oh Lord just as you came in the body as a Child O Lord and lived it as a youthful Lord God we ask O Lord that you
