[33:54] [Music]
[34:05] a couple of things that we just need to
[34:07] take care of here and just look at be
[34:10] back in the house of God just like going
[34:18] to church like worship but I like
[34:21] worshiping with wrong man it's good just
[34:24] to be here and you know there's there's
[34:27] places where they they can't even meet
[34:31] we're grateful that God has given us
[34:33] this just wonderful opportunity to meet
[34:36] and the other thing that you know I was
[34:42] mentioning that we just want to come and
[34:44] take take things slow as they've been
[34:45] opening up our County there's been more
[34:49] cases reported of people you know coming
[34:53] down with this virus and you know one of
[34:56] the things that I've realized is that as
[34:58] we go back into the workplace there's
[35:00] opportunity for us to be exposed even
[35:04] more to you know somebody else that may
[35:07] have been sick or getting sick we need
[35:10] God's protection we need God's
[35:12] protection so I thank God that I he has
[35:17] thus far protected all of us and you
[35:20] know every person that had to take a
[35:22] test has come back negative and we just
[35:25] were grateful for that
[35:27] and so God is God is real good and my
[35:33] prayer is that not one of us will you
[35:36] know have a problem I was approached
[35:40] this week by somebody a man relative of
[35:44] mine and they were saying are you all
[35:46] going to church I'm like yes we are how
[35:48] about going to church and this is we -
[35:50] just tell me what y'all doing with the
[35:53] mask and everything a yellow wearing
[35:55] masks are not wearing master say well
[35:56] yes we do wear masks we do wear masks
[35:59] and say now we don't make it mandatory
[36:02] that everybody have to wear masks but we
[36:05] we are wearing them a man for you know
[36:08] safety reasons and they say well praise
[36:11] the Lord because you know where where
[36:13] I'm going everybody looking at me funny
[36:15] because I wear a mask
[36:16] I say well no I don't look at you funny
[36:19] because you're wearing a mask I say the
[36:21] way I see a mask is I like to ask a
[36:24] question how many left home this morning
[36:25] they left they front door unlocked
[36:28] [Music]
[36:30] I mean it just you got that nice
[36:33] constant night there in the parking lot
[36:35] did you leave it unlocked with somebody
[36:38] just to drive away
[36:39] what about leaving a lock and leave a
[36:40] key in it we don't do that right it's
[36:45] just these are what we call just you
[36:47] know these are things that's just common
[36:49] sense right so I don't think it's a it's
[36:52] a lack of faith if you lock your front
[36:54] door there's not a lack of faith if you
[36:57] don't leave the key in the ignition for
[36:59] somebody to take don't right so so mask
[37:06] is just like that it's not it's not a
[37:08] thing of faith at all that's not it's
[37:10] not it's not faith at all I mean it's
[37:12] just something that they asked us to do
[37:14] so we're doing what they asked us to do
[37:16] and if Christians can't do what the
[37:20] government is actually doing something
[37:21] wrong with our Christian experience
[37:26] should not be the ones that's been
[37:28] rebellious question she would say yes
[37:31] we'll do that so I'm told say if you if
[37:36] they laugh at you but you had you got a
[37:38] place you can come alright I got some
[38:00] things I'm supposed to say you know let
[38:02] me get the announcements and and then I
[38:05] want to go I got to give you all a quick
[38:08] update on our building from the praise

[38:50] is it allows us to get more than the
[38:53] supposed to be maybe fifty with social
[38:55] distancing we kind of split down the
[38:59] center of that and try to get it about
[39:01] thirty with social distancing and and
[39:04] and thus far that's been successful but

[45:18] things and and I'm gonna just let y'all
[45:21] know y'all ain't seen nothing yet
[45:24] right so we just under expectation a man
[45:29] for for some really really great
[45:31] testimonies and men to come forth even
[45:34] more than what God has done but but that
[45:36] that song the struggle is over a man
[45:39] it's over and you got to declare that
[45:42] over yourself and a man and my finances
[45:45] the struggle is over in my body the
[45:49] struggle is over me and my family the
[45:52] struggle is over I am fighting with the
[45:55] devil no more it's it's over it's over
[45:58] you got to see yourself already walking
[46:01] in victory praise the Lord
[46:03] a man so we just we just think God for
[46:06] all things I want to read a scripture
[46:11] here out of the book of John this
[46:13] morning John 18 and God is so good it
[46:21] seems like we for those that have joined
[46:25] us online I do want to just mention this
[46:30] we for weeks we have not had our
[46:34] neighboring churches here and this week
[46:39] they have joined us and we thank God for
[46:41] them being able to open up their doors
[46:43] and worship again but sometimes their
[46:46] music amen will bleed over into our
[46:49] service of you if you hear that online
[46:51] just bear with us this is why we believe
[46:54] in God for a new church a new school and
[46:57] we're not trying to shut them down we
[46:58] need more churches we shut down boss we
[47:02] pray for laws to shut down but not
[47:04] churches so but we just want a little
[47:07] bit more space where we can kind of
[47:09] worship and freedom and not necessarily
[47:10] have to worry about you know of bleeding
[47:12] over like that so just be praying be
[47:15] praying with us a man if you desire to
[47:17] give towards that and amen we will
[47:19] accept any
[47:20] nations towards that as well so if you
[47:22] hear that they may hear some other music
[47:24] or something like that just bear with us
[47:26] a man you can get into a channel where
[47:30] all you can hear is the Word of God and
[47:31] we want to encourage you to do that on
[47:33] today
[47:33] John 18 and actually I want to start up
[47:39] a little earlier from that I start at
[47:42] verse 28 a man if we can praise the Lord
[47:47] so much is happening a man so much has
[47:51] happened and I have been getting so many
[47:55] phone calls with all the events that
[48:00] have transpired here through this week
[48:03] and I just felt it would be appropriate
[48:06] to just kind of give an appropriate
[48:10] response to to everything that is that
[48:13] has happened a Christians response
[48:16] that's if that's okay and let's just
[48:20] let's just read a man from Scripture
[48:24] John 18 verse 20 then led they Jesus
[48:29] from Caiaphas so the whole of judgment
[48:33] and it was early and they themselves
[48:34] went not into the judgment Hall lest
[48:38] they should be defiled but that they
[48:39] might eat the Passover Pilate then went
[48:43] out unto them and said what accusation
[48:45] bring ye against this man they answered
[48:50] and said unto him if he were not
[48:53] malefactor we would not have delivered
[48:57] him unto thee you can see they saying
[48:59] with an attitude right then said Pilate
[49:03] unto them taking him and judge him
[49:05] according to your law the Jews therefore
[49:09] said to him it is not lawful for us to
[49:11] put any man today
[49:14] right so their law would not even
[49:16] because they had thou shalt not kill
[49:18] right they they couldn't even with their
[49:20] love put into death but they had to
[49:21] deliver him over to the government if we
[49:25] can put it that way at this time
[49:27] amen in order to kill Jesus the Roman
[49:30] government had to kill him for them
[49:32] right that the saying of Jesus might be
[49:34] fulfilled which he spake signifying the
[49:36] death he should die then Pilate entered
[49:39] into the judgment Hall again and said
[49:42] and called Jesus and said unto Him art
[49:45] thou the King of the Jews
[49:50] jesus answered him says thou this thing
[49:55] of thyself or did others tell it thee of
[49:58] me Pilate answered mi-joo vynil nation
[50:06] and the chief priests have delivered
[50:08] thee unto me what has thou done and I
[50:13] love this response from Jesus jesus
[50:16] answered my kingdom is not of this world
[50:22] if my kingdom were of this world then
[50:28] would my servants fight can I read that
[50:35] again jesus answered my kingdom is not
[50:40] of this world if my kingdom were of this
[50:46] world then would my servants fight that
[50:53] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[50:54] but now is my kingdom not from hence a
[50:59] man Pilate therefore said unto Him art
[51:03] thou a king then what you're trying to
[51:06] say right Arthur king then jesus
[51:11] answered thou says that I am a king to
[51:15] this end was I born for this car
[51:18] came out into the world that I should
[51:21] bear witness unto the truth everyone
[51:26] that is of the truth heareth my voice
[51:31] right all right all right all right
[51:36] let's just have a quick word of Prayer a
[51:39] man over this Father we thank you for
[51:44] the word of the Lord that has been
[51:48] raining down our prayer today is that
[51:51] you would just help us to apply what we
[51:54] are what we are reading and what we're
[51:57] hearing lord help us to hear your voice
[52:00] that you got would just take control of
[52:02] our time here together

[52:13] online and God bless those ear to hear
[52:16] what the Spirit is trying to say is in
[52:19] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[52:23] you you can be seated so I I had another
[52:35] scripture I think i'ma save it to later
[52:37] out of first samuel for I thought it was
[52:40] very divine if I can use that word that
[52:48] the thought that I wanted to kind of
[52:50] present today reconnected with something
[52:54] that I shared last year and and the
[52:56] scripture reading during this week
[52:58] actually I think the scripture reading
[53:00] for yesterday I'm a daily Bible reading
[53:01] it connected with all of it and now we
[53:05] were reading from first Samuel 24 so
[53:08] I'll save that for later but I want to
[53:11] just title this sermon citizens of
[53:14] another Kingdom a man we are citizens of
[53:20] another Kingdom let's look at a man a
[53:24] quote from the
[53:26] questions and answers part to play man
[53:30] there there's a statement a couple
[53:32] statements that it makes here we want to
[53:34] just look at them this first quote here
[53:38] says here as I've often said I believe
[53:43] in the church here there's a role here
[53:46] like and here lives mortal beings and
[53:50] each one is in this great conglomeration
[53:55] of gaiety of blackness and darkness
[53:59] mortals live in here he says now they
[54:03] are influenced from this away or from
[54:09] that way hallelujah your influence comes
[54:13] from one or two directions either your
[54:16] influence is coming from heaven or your
[54:19] fluence is coming from Hell a man there
[54:22] is no in-between either either spirit
[54:26] from heavens actually a man determined
[54:34] where the influence is coming from come
[54:37] on somebody
[54:41] another Kingdom he says you can be here
[55:17] if you influence from here your from
[55:20] above I like this if your influence from
[55:24] from here
[55:25] Amen you from you are from above get
[55:29] that now if your influence from here
[55:31] that means you are fallible that means
[55:33] you came from God and you going back to
[55:36] God hallelujah you are citizen of
[55:39] another Kingdom your actions are
[55:41] different than everybody else

[57:18] feelings hey he just gives us the word
[57:20] and you know and and that's what I
[57:22] that's what I want to be I don't want to
[57:24] be moved by emotions my feelings I just
[57:26] want to be on the word praise the Lord
[57:28] that's what that's what that's what
[57:30] pleases God how we how we lay hold to
[57:32] the work I tell you I think this is a
[57:34] time if ever there was a time for
[57:36] Christians to actually shine the light
[57:38] this is the perfect time for Christians
[57:42] Christians to shine the light and let me
[57:44] take something already people know
[57:47] you're Christian by the way some of some
[57:49] of us dress they can tell you no man you
[57:51] do different I'm sister you different
[57:52] because of what you dress and if you're
[57:54] dressing a man helps people realize that
[57:58] there's something different about you
[58:00] your actions should also help people to
[58:02] realize that there's something different
[58:04] about you amen
[58:06] oh my god amen
[58:08] shoo jr. - true genuine Christians it
[58:10] goes to be on our dress now it's our
[58:13] actions praise the Lord
[58:15] alright I'm going on a little further
[58:17] and some some some other quotes here
[58:19] oh my see I got to do this because I'll
[58:23] be there I lose track of time so y'all
[58:26] that first one was free and and then I'm
[58:30] assessed imma set the timer right now so
[58:34] then you know praise the Lord alright
[58:36] let's go to oneness of unity hey man
[58:40] don't count that don't count that
[58:41] against my time alright the wonders of
[58:44] unity just recently I could feel the
[58:50] spirit in the meeting and you are who
[58:52] are sending your letters in as an
[58:54] apology of the first night or two to
[58:58] believe that it was some kind of mental
[59:01] setup and now you're convinced should I
[59:03] forgive you God does too and the Lord
[59:06] bless you certainly it says now when the
[59:09] meeting going on evil spirit in the
[59:13] meeting that spirit is almost harmless
[59:19] evil spirit is actually harmless until
[59:26] it can catch somebody that it can work
[59:31] through evil spirit is harmless
[59:35] somebody down the standard
[59:39] [Music]
[59:46] I lose somebody so we gotta watch it
[59:50] coming from this one it's coming from
[59:59] underneath now which world is just there
[1:00:02] Jesus died for we we just eat does he
[1:00:04] just even in that one quarter just kind
[1:00:06] of gave us three worlds she said
[1:00:07] underworld an above world and then we're
[1:00:10] in this great kendama conglomeration of
[1:00:12] blackness three different worlds right
[1:00:13] there in that one cool
[1:00:15] so which world of Jesus represented when
[1:00:19] he said when it says my if if if my if
[1:00:21] my when it says my kingdom is not of
[1:00:24] this world which one was he talking
[1:00:26] about I can guarantee you it wasn't
[1:00:31] underneath we got to you know let's go
[1:01:21] he says an evil spirit in the meeting
[1:01:23] that spirit is almost harmless until it
[1:01:26] can catch somebody that it can work
[1:01:29] through then when it can work through in
[1:01:31] a certainly do damage because it's an
[1:01:34] evil spirit and the Holy Spirit is here
[1:01:38] trying to find somebody and when it
[1:01:43] finds somebody to work it can't do good
[1:01:49] see the two spirits their motives
[1:01:52] objectives
[1:01:54] watch out is watch their works watch
[1:01:56] their fruits then you can see what
[1:01:58] spirit
[1:01:59] on you watch their fruits then you can
[1:02:05] see what spirit is on you you are
[1:02:10] motivated let's get motivated to spirit
[1:02:25] your debt and if you have a spirit it
[1:02:28] motivates your life and if your life
[1:02:31] bears the fruit of a Christian it's a
[1:02:33] Christian spirit amen now you maybe feel
[1:02:37] now watch this evil spirit when he goes
[1:02:39] out he walks him dry places hunting a
[1:02:42] place to find rest the Bible said he
[1:02:44] could not father sir says I will return
[1:02:46] back to where I come out of now God
[1:02:48] could have delivered you from something
[1:02:50] at some point in time of your life a man
[1:02:52] God can deliver you from some really
[1:02:55] really evil thoughts towards other races
[1:02:57] a man God could have set you free from
[1:03:00] that but the devil has a way of bringing
[1:03:03] that saying right back around and he
[1:03:05] will anoint you oh that evil spirit
[1:03:12] let's say I'm gonna go back and this
[1:03:13] time when he comes back he come back
[1:03:16] with seven other spirits and now you're
[1:03:18] worse than you ever was a man if God has
[1:03:22] set you free from sin that stuff you
[1:03:23] better stay free from it glory to God
[1:03:28] Church look at this he says I will
[1:03:33] return back to where I come from come
[1:03:34] out of he goes back to this person that
[1:03:37] he was once in and he founds the house
[1:03:38] all swept cleaned up sanctify all
[1:03:40] condemnation gone
[1:03:42] oh just a real happy believer but it's
[1:03:44] empty and he said come here seven other
[1:03:46] spirits worse than he was will you
[1:03:48] please try to get this the Bible said
[1:03:51] that's the truth Jesus said it's the
[1:03:52] truth and it comes back to this house a
[1:03:54] man who has confessed Christ to be his
[1:03:58] Savior has got rid of his wickedness has
[1:04:03] quit his drinking quit his smoke him his
[1:04:07] his feeling he has become sanctified
[1:04:10] cleaned out his house is all sweat he
[1:04:13] feels free so he comes back in he finds
[1:04:15] a house then he goes in and gets seven
[1:04:18] other spirits worse than he was and
[1:04:19] comes into this person and the Bible
[1:04:22] said the last estate of the man is seven
[1:04:24] times worse than it was at the beginning
[1:04:27] so we got to just be careful we don't
[1:04:29] know how the enemy is trying to move now
[1:04:33] I want to just inject a little something
[1:04:36] here I'm going back to that message
[1:04:38] questions and answers part two and I'm
[1:04:42] going to paragraph 145 let me just let
[1:04:47] me just before I bring that up I want I
[1:04:49] want to say something when you see
[1:04:53] something with your eyes you can't unsee
[1:04:57] it when you hear something with your
[1:05:05] ears
[1:05:06] you cannot unhear it you can't act like
[1:05:10] I never heard that before you heard it
[1:05:12] and when you see something with your
[1:05:14] eyes you cannot unsee it that thing is
[1:05:19] with you I mean for the rest of your
[1:05:22] life if a young man I'm going to some
[1:05:25] other areas here if a young man gets
[1:05:27] involved with pornography at a young age
[1:05:30] he can't unsee the stuff that he saw
[1:05:34] hallelujah that stuff would stay with
[1:05:36] him even though he's a Christian the
[1:05:38] devil will bring those thoughts right
[1:05:40] back to his mind if a young lady does it
[1:05:42] that stuff stays with you in your mind
[1:05:45] for the rest of your life even though
[1:05:47] you converted hallelujah
[1:05:49] now I'm saying that to say this because
[1:05:52] nowadays as these different videos are
[1:05:55] floating around the internet there's
[1:05:56] some stuff you don't need to see because
[1:05:59] once you see it you can't unsee it
[1:06:03] and once it gets into your spirit it
[1:06:06] begins to do things in you it awakens
[1:06:09] things in you that you thought was P
[1:06:26] I'm just passing through look at what
[1:06:31] the Prophet says here in this message
[1:06:32] questions and answers part 2 says I
[1:06:35] think a good little thing you ought to
[1:06:37] set around on your desk it's a little
[1:06:41] thing I seen down in Florida brother
[1:06:43] branham saw it in Florida a little thing
[1:06:46] I've seen down in Florida not long ago
[1:06:48] it was three little monkeys and one of
[1:06:51] them had his hands over his eyes and
[1:06:53] said see no evil the other one had his
[1:06:58] fingers in his ears and said hear no
[1:07:01] evil and the other one had his hand over
[1:07:03] his mouth and said sorry no I'm not
[1:07:14] going and I will not speak just keep
[1:07:24] your mind pure
[1:07:25] and on Christ you can't just say well
[1:07:28] now they see if you don't watch you'll
[1:07:30] get yourself over into a place if you
[1:07:33] keep oh they did that right and now and
[1:07:37] don't don't think you can't live so
[1:07:40] perfect till you don't make that mistake
[1:07:43] right now don't you think you'll ever
[1:07:45] get that way cuz you won't no sir you're
[1:07:48] not sinless and you'll certainly get up
[1:07:50] on their track on this side on that side
[1:07:55] I love the old song be careful who lives
[1:08:08] what you see be careful little eyes what
[1:08:12] to see for the father up above is
[1:08:15] looking down below be careful arrives
[1:08:17] what you see
[1:08:19] they had another verse be careful little
[1:08:22] feet where you go be careful little feet
[1:08:26] where you go for the father up above is
[1:08:29] looking down below be careful little
[1:08:32] feet where you go be careful near the
[1:08:37] mouth what you say be careful little
[1:08:42] mouth what you say for the father up
[1:08:45] above is looking down below
[1:08:47] be careful little mouth what you say
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:32] the Holy Ghost is what controls us a man
[1:09:36] now look at this the Prophet makes his
[1:09:39] statement and the message questions and
[1:09:40] answers says but a man this is paragraph
[1:09:44] 147 I don't know if I wrote this one
[1:09:46] down or not
[1:09:47] okay all right he said but a man that's
[1:09:50] once knocked down if he's a real soldier
[1:09:52] he'll rise up again Lord let me rise and
[1:09:56] try it again but a coward as soon as he
[1:09:59] makes his first little mistake he's like
[1:10:01] I said it's one in the bug and the water
[1:10:03] spider will crawl right back in the
[1:10:05] water again see he just king's standing
[1:10:07] so refused all the ol that that profane
[1:10:11] babbling and carrying on talking
[1:10:14] babbling means confusion so the Prophet
[1:10:17] said you got to refuse and the Bible say
[1:10:19] avoid profane tablets and brother
[1:10:21] branham say it babblings is confusion if
[1:10:25] we're not living in a time where people
[1:10:27] are so confused it's a shame you know I
[1:10:31] mean I somebody called I got so many
[1:10:34] calls this weekend you know I'm just
[1:10:36] trying to understand this trying to
[1:10:37] understand and I said I'm probably the
[1:10:39] wrong person to ask
[1:10:40] you know I say because a lot of things I
[1:10:43] don't understand and a lot of things I
[1:10:46] actually I actually feel different about
[1:10:48] it then then what other people feel
[1:10:50] about and I say really to me you know
[1:10:53] government is not the answer
[1:10:55] ain't no ain't no president gonna be
[1:10:58] able to get this song huh hey man I
[1:11:01] don't care how much people post that
[1:11:03] ain't gonna solve it what are all the
[1:11:06] things that they do that's not gonna
[1:11:07] solve the problem it brings awareness to
[1:11:09] it but it don't solve it
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:47] change your heart hallelujah that's my
[1:11:52] sauce you need Christ we all need Christ
[1:11:55] a man
[1:11:58] the murderer needs Christ Jesus I'm
[1:12:26] telling a real solution he says so
[1:12:33] refuse all that profane babbling and
[1:12:36] carrying on talking Babylon means
[1:12:37] confusion and the Bible said mark those
[1:12:39] who cause contentious among you if
[1:12:42] somebody said uh-huh uh-huh now just say
[1:12:45] how do you do I'm glad to see you again
[1:12:48] thank you
[1:12:52] just keep on going that's the best thing
[1:12:58] I said don't shun them but just mark
[1:13:02] them don't show them just mark them
[1:13:08] watch it because they influenced by
[1:13:09] another spirit the spirit coming from
[1:13:12] the underworld a man he said just marked
[1:13:16] him don't pay any attention because you
[1:13:18] see what it leads to
[1:13:20] hey man now I got a little quote here
[1:13:25] that I wanna read let's see how far we
[1:13:29] can go going as far as we can he says
[1:13:32] and before I read this is coming out of
[1:13:34] the voice of God in the last day I want
[1:13:36] to just say this your your political
[1:13:38] position can't bring you in direct
[1:13:42] opposition of the word revealed truth of
[1:13:47] a vindicated prophet imma say that again
[1:13:50] your political position can bring you in
[1:13:55] direct opposition of the word reveal
[1:14:00] truth of a vindicated prophet now I say
[1:14:05] this even his opinions were things we
[1:14:08] should take note of even if he just had
[1:14:11] an opinion about it
[1:14:12] it was things that we should take note
[1:14:13] of I've seen people actually say that
[1:14:17] the Prophet was wrong about certain
[1:14:18] things that he said from a political
[1:14:20] standpoint I'm gonna have to have y'all
[1:14:22] read between the lines
[1:14:23] there's some quotes at down some
[1:14:25] political things a man that kind of
[1:14:28] shakes some people but even even his
[1:14:31] opinion you better be watching his
[1:14:32] opinion because when a prophet is
[1:14:34] speaking he's not talking naturally he's
[1:14:37] always talking spiritually and if you
[1:14:39] can't catch things about a spiritual rim
[1:14:40] you're gonna always miss it
[1:14:41] hey man you're gonna always miss it
[1:14:44] praise the Lord Amen there we have have
[1:14:47] some really good leaders good
[1:14:48] inspirational people but we talk about a
[1:14:50] prophet vindicated by God hey man you
[1:14:55] can't you ain't got no you ain't got no
[1:14:56] no no no no mess on his life right you
[1:15:00] got
[1:15:01] you can pin on his life he ain't
[1:15:02] cheating on his wife and still
[1:15:04] prophesied hallelujah somebody run
[1:15:08] around the world and doing all kind of
[1:15:09] things amen
[1:15:10] this man came to bring God to the people
[1:15:13] so even his opinions meant something
[1:15:17] even if his opinion goes against your
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:30] brother this go beyond race this go way
[1:15:34] beyond race this message goes beyond man
[1:16:13] hallelujah I'm not a saint
[1:16:20] I talk different because of this word is
[1:16:23] the truth anyhow the word made me like
[1:16:26] this amen amen
[1:16:29] man Oh Lord let me just we we are a
[1:16:35] Christian Church now just that's that's
[1:16:39] what we are
[1:16:40] i'ma say that again we are a Christian
[1:16:44] Church
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:17:10] so anybody actually what kind of search
[1:17:13] hello Christian search all right
[1:17:24] even his opinions with things that we
[1:17:27] should take note of he's not looking
[1:17:28] from the same lenses as everyone else so
[1:17:31] you know your political position can
[1:17:32] bring you in direct opposition of the
[1:17:35] world revealed truth of a vindicated
[1:17:37] prophet so even his opinions were things
[1:17:41] we should take note of he is not looking
[1:17:45] from the same lenses as everybody else
[1:17:48] amen and if you want to understand the
[1:17:50] Prophet you're gonna need spiritual
[1:17:51] insight to understand what a prophet is
[1:17:55] saying the voice of God is last days the
[1:18:01] Prophet says this and the sermon he says
[1:18:03] in the forces of God they say how will
[1:18:05] we know it is how how will we notice the
[1:18:09] voice of God because because for the day
[1:18:11] then it was then then it was in a
[1:18:13] vindicated prophet down today how we
[1:18:15] know in support of God because it's the
[1:18:17] manifestation of the prophets word this
[1:18:20] is God's prophet and a true voice of God
[1:18:23] only brings back that real living
[1:18:25] supernatural God with his supernatural
[1:18:28] world with the supernatural
[1:18:30] manifestation of the true word then we
[1:18:32] know that it's just the voice of God
[1:18:34] because that and there's so much other
[1:18:38] in other realms that's just almost dead
[1:18:41] in that out but remember it will glisten
[1:18:43] it'll come forth it'll do it so now
[1:18:46] there is a voice today in the world of
[1:18:48] politics that's a great voice he says
[1:18:52] that people absolutely and
[1:18:56] great day of politics it's all mixed up
[1:18:59] in their churches see politics get into
[1:19:02] the church
[1:19:03] I don't heard some things I can say
[1:19:06] something is more than something I heard
[1:19:07] this week I just want to blast it to
[1:19:10] smithereens but I'm just keeping myself
[1:19:13] in check some of the stuff I heard but
[1:19:17] see what happened we get politics mixed
[1:19:19] up in the church I'm gonna tell you III
[1:19:21] just kind of went back in my mind a man
[1:19:24] just kind of going through Scripture I
[1:19:26] couldn't think of one prophet actually I
[1:19:29] only knew one that got got intertwined
[1:19:32] with politics and his prophetic position
[1:19:35] most prophets in scripture a men are
[1:19:38] always separated from that not only not
[1:19:41] only they separated it's the prophets
[1:19:42] that actually get in trouble with the
[1:19:44] government right your lives you got in
[1:19:48] trouble with the government Elijah got
[1:19:51] in trouble with the government John the
[1:19:52] Baptist got in trouble with the
[1:19:54] government brother Branham had a tax
[1:19:56] case got in trouble with the government
[1:19:59] hello somebody there's only one prophet
[1:20:02] I know in Scripture that was actually
[1:20:04] representative both a man government and
[1:20:08] and also I had a spirit I mean he was a
[1:20:11] prophet as well and that was King David
[1:20:14] only one now you see a king dave was a
[1:20:17] prophet he prophesied in the songs he
[1:20:19] was a prophet amen
[1:20:20] but he was not like any light he was not
[1:20:23] like any like shut he was not like a
[1:20:25] John the Baptist right so I mean and
[1:20:28] even God had a reason for allowing David
[1:20:31] where both rose crowns like that
[1:20:33] hallelujah where he prophesied also was
[1:20:35] a king of the I mean because we got a
[1:20:37] soon coming King his name is Jesus and
[1:20:40] they was a pure representation of the
[1:20:43] life of Jesus Christ
[1:20:44] Oh hallelujah I'm getting to David a
[1:20:46] little bit he was in our Bible reading
[1:20:49] yesterday even even with that he still
[1:20:53] handled himself certain ways David
[1:20:56] handled himself like he was from another
[1:21:00] kingdom
[1:21:03] let me just try to read some quotes and
[1:21:06] i'ma let me finish this one
[1:21:09] he says the voice the voice of politics
[1:21:15] is actually stronger but then the voice
[1:21:18] of God in the churches right amen
[1:21:22] all the American people would have never
[1:21:23] did what they've just done see they'd
[1:21:26] have never done it if the voice of God
[1:21:28] would be kept alive in the church they'd
[1:21:32] have never made that mistakes but the
[1:21:35] voice of politics is so much stronger in
[1:21:38] the earth today than the voice of God
[1:21:40] until people saw their Christian
[1:21:42] birthright from Nessa popularity how
[1:21:46] many likes can I get a man and an old
[1:21:54] please they hold a profits level
[1:22:00] education against them you tell me what
[1:22:03] man with all the education they got was
[1:22:05] able to preach the things that he
[1:22:06] preached no nobody could even touch it
[1:22:10] couldn't even look at it
[1:22:12] nobody could go in there right and and
[1:22:15] so we're not looking for some educated
[1:22:17] genius that came live right praise the
[1:22:21] Lord we don't need that no don't bring
[1:22:23] that I'm sorry church ah I mean that's
[1:22:26] not what we stand for here we a man and
[1:23:04] if you knew anything about the Word of
[1:23:06] God you know that God called john the
[1:23:08] baptists out to the wilderness to at a
[1:23:10] very early age a prophet of God and not
[1:23:14] only just a prophet but a prophet uh
[1:23:17] prophets because he introduced the
[1:23:18] Messiah a man jesus said there had been
[1:23:21] nobody born of woman that was greater
[1:23:24] than John he only had a six month
[1:23:26] ministry and uneducated praise the Lord
[1:23:30] I mean when he preached he had to preach
[1:23:32] in symbols later acts at the root of the
[1:23:36] trees go tell that that that's neat you
[1:23:39] know I mean he used an old kind of
[1:23:41] language like he using wilderness
[1:23:42] language to get his message across
[1:23:45] God gave us a prophet with the same
[1:23:47] types and shadows and everything like
[1:23:49] you got to be spiritual to catch what
[1:23:51] this prophet is saying is out there in
[1:23:57] the land today and that's the force of
[1:24:01] God's alright the voice of politics so
[1:24:04] much stronger nerve to date in the voice
[1:24:06] of God until people saw their Christian
[1:24:09] birthright for a message popularity
[1:24:10] education and political power it's such
[1:24:13] a shame to see the very thing that our
[1:24:16] nation was made with what it's made on
[1:24:18] the people turn right back around and
[1:24:20] vote anything that we left the other
[1:24:22] country it says in the Plymouth Rock and
[1:24:25] Mayflower them come over here and
[1:24:27] establish this great economy that we
[1:24:29] have is the very thing we felt so hard
[1:24:31] to come out of we put ourselves right
[1:24:33] back in its clutches because the Bible
[1:24:35] speaks that it would be that way
[1:24:38] you know our purpose for even leaving
[1:24:41] some of the other countries reason this
[1:24:42] country was established with is because
[1:24:44] there was a freedom of religion and if
[1:24:48] you're not careful the spirit that's
[1:24:49] coming from the underworld is actually
[1:24:51] going to take your freedom of speech
[1:24:53] let's get ready to take it from you
[1:24:55] because if somebody does not agree so
[1:24:59] I'm going to put something out then you
[1:25:00] say something that you don't agree
[1:25:02] everybody will come for you
[1:25:04] and when they're coming for you what
[1:25:06] they've done and then make you apologize
[1:25:08] I gotta apologize because I don't agree
[1:25:11] I refuse to let you take my freedom of
[1:25:14] speech from me hey man I don't agree
[1:25:17] what you're seeing but I am apologizing
[1:25:19] for it you ain't apologizing I apologize
[1:25:24] praise the Lord any high man I mean you
[1:25:28] got a freedom to do what you want to do
[1:25:29] I got a freedom to say what I want to
[1:25:31] say I believe the Word of God I'm a
[1:25:32] citizen of another Kingdom yes but while
[1:25:36] I'm here I respect those that in
[1:25:38] authority all right you gotta worry
[1:25:41] about nothing for me now just serves we
[1:25:48] will see Jesus I'm coming in and I'm
[1:25:51] trying he says we're citizens not of
[1:25:54] Canada neither are we citizens of the
[1:25:58] United States our citizenship is above
[1:26:02] if we are citizens of the kingdom of God
[1:26:05] when I go into Germany I watch the way
[1:26:08] they do they have their own ideas I come
[1:26:11] down from one of the greatest meetings
[1:26:14] where we was having a a verge of 10,000
[1:26:17] souls save each night 50,000 saved in
[1:26:20] five nights and then coming down the
[1:26:22] street here was the Saints with the
[1:26:26] great big schooners of beer drinking
[1:26:31] just as fast as they could drink the
[1:26:33] Saints praising the Lord as hard as they
[1:26:38] could you see well that's their custom
[1:26:42] in Germany see they don't pay any
[1:26:45] attention to it and so forth he says you
[1:26:48] find different traits in different
[1:26:50] nations Oh y'all got to catch that one
[1:26:52] because certain people respond based on
[1:26:54] their environment you understand if
[1:26:57] certain traits go with certain nations
[1:26:59] certain people identify with things a
[1:27:02] little faster than you do because they
[1:27:03] have seen this spirit before but
[1:27:05] was a spirit remember that different
[1:27:13] rates and different nations we find it
[1:27:15] in Canada find it in the United States
[1:27:17] but then when a Christian becomes a
[1:27:19] Christian he is no more a citizen of
[1:27:23] this world but we plainly know that
[1:27:25] we're Abraham's seed and Kiko confessed
[1:27:28] that he was a pilgrim and a stranger he
[1:27:30] was a citizen of another world
[1:27:33] hallelujah
[1:27:34] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:27:36] maker serves this just lost my place to
[1:27:41] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:27:43] maker was God so meet us see so we our
[1:27:46] citizenship is of above and above this
[1:27:49] holiness see we got an influence either
[1:27:51] coming from above coming from beneath
[1:27:54] and therefore we are citizens of the
[1:28:07] kingdom of God and as citizens of the
[1:28:09] kingdom let's look for our king first
[1:28:20] every 24 let's read this tell you what
[1:28:24] bring David right right back in this was
[1:28:26] a part of our Bible reading and
[1:28:27] yesterday you know sometimes you sit
[1:28:29] around you just just just Lord just give
[1:28:30] me something I just want to hear your
[1:28:32] voice and I hear so many voices around
[1:28:35] and this one that and they have this
[1:28:36] Lord I just need to hear your voice what
[1:28:38] is it that you are trying to say at a
[1:28:41] time like this
[1:28:42] what is it god I need to hear you and
[1:28:45] sometimes you can hear it it's still
[1:28:47] small voice just in the reading of his
[1:28:49] word and as I was reading on yesterday
[1:28:52] and it just blessed my heart I said lord
[1:28:55] I read this before and I remember you
[1:28:57] gave me some sermons on Christ and life
[1:28:59] of David and and and and we went right
[1:29:02] back and picked it up again I believe
[1:29:05] last year and we preached war strategies
[1:29:08] what's your war strategy you're gonna be
[1:29:11] facing some stuff you're gonna need a
[1:29:13] strategy yeah and you know y'all when I
[1:29:17] went through that whole series of water
[1:29:19] does that mean that I made a statement
[1:29:20] in there that there are times where your
[1:29:24] strategy got to be just shut your mouth
[1:29:25] and y'all know brother Diggs picked that
[1:29:29] up and came right back and prints it to
[1:29:31] y'all he said he got a new ministry he
[1:29:37] heard it here he was listening to the
[1:29:39] tape from here the YouTube video and he
[1:29:41] picked it up and carried around the
[1:29:43] world he say I got this new ministry
[1:29:45] that God gave me it's like it like a
[1:29:47] third Pole in my ministry it was such
[1:29:49] your mouth and you know what we need to
[1:29:52] exercise that ministry just don't say
[1:29:55] nothing ma'am just don't say nothing go
[1:30:02] silent and silent don't mean consent all
[1:30:05] right that's what the world is telling
[1:30:07] you the silent consent then Jesus was
[1:30:11] concerned what was was consenting when
[1:30:14] they were taking him to the cross
[1:30:15] because he remained silent
[1:30:18] praise the Lord and you want to talk
[1:30:22] about something that you really should
[1:30:24] be upset about why how did they know my
[1:30:26] Jesus to the cross he did nothing who
[1:30:30] took them outside and nailed him up
[1:30:32] there to across somebody needs to get
[1:30:33] upset and posted get mad make a t-shirt
[1:30:44] they kill Jesus praise the Lord Lord
[1:30:55] help me I'm not trying to diminish
[1:30:57] nothing but I'm trying to get the focus
[1:30:58] back on cry
[1:31:00] hey man lay man we're citizens of
[1:31:04] another Kingdom we act different we talk
[1:31:06] different we walk different David
[1:31:08] without the Holy Ghost look at how he
[1:31:11] acts here in 1st Samuel 24 verse 1 came
[1:31:14] to pass when Saul was returned from
[1:31:16] following the Philistines now understand
[1:31:18] before David got into situation
[1:31:20] David had he was already on the run from
[1:31:24] Saul Saul is just determined to kill him
[1:31:28] he tried to kill him while he was
[1:31:29] sleeping and his wife had to trick him
[1:31:31] and put a rock in the bed and all kind
[1:31:33] of stuff - you know that to get David
[1:31:35] out of the house and and then start
[1:31:37] lying but sorrow still determined to
[1:31:39] kill this man right and and here David
[1:31:42] refused to to have the same type of
[1:31:45] anger or the same type of feeling
[1:31:48] towards all
[1:31:49] he just kept dodging him he just kept
[1:31:51] running whatever he could do got to a
[1:31:53] little spot where God told him to go
[1:31:54] down into a certain City he said go down
[1:31:57] there and and and deliver those people
[1:31:58] the Philistines have come against him go
[1:32:00] down there and deliver those people and
[1:32:01] they went down there they fought for the
[1:32:03] people and and they celebrating this
[1:32:04] great victory from the Philistines and
[1:32:06] and Saul here you down here that David
[1:32:08] is down there and this in the city and
[1:32:09] and Saul wants to go down and get David
[1:32:12] after David just killed her Phyllis
[1:32:13] times again for right and here you know
[1:32:16] here David Davis down there so I was on
[1:32:17] the way down to get David and David
[1:32:19] praise the Lord will these people
[1:32:21] deliver me back into salt and he said
[1:32:23] yeah you better get out of here so the
[1:32:24] same people that he was celebrating with
[1:32:27] he's the same people that was getting
[1:32:29] ready to deliver him the song you gotta
[1:32:32] watch who you celebrate with right so
[1:32:36] here here here you celebrating with him
[1:32:38] and and a man and now now they're gonna
[1:32:40] deliver him a mentor saw that he say so
[1:32:42] you better get on out of there so David
[1:32:43] just going from mountain range to
[1:32:46] mountain range and around the mountain
[1:32:48] and through the through the fat go do
[1:32:49] everything he can to get away from stuff
[1:32:50] got so closer I think Salton was about
[1:32:53] compassing him but at the time that Saul
[1:32:56] finally got got got a hold of David God
[1:32:59] allowed to feel it's time to start
[1:33:00] raiding the area where Saul live and he
[1:33:02] had to leave
[1:33:03] his battle with David to go back down
[1:33:05] and try to protect the people from the
[1:33:06] Philistines God know how to do things if
[1:33:10] we just let God do it right so here he
[1:33:15] goes down he delivers the people but in
[1:33:18] his spirit he still wants to kill David
[1:33:21] and this is what we pick up here and
[1:33:24] first-ever twenty four and it came to
[1:33:27] pass see it seems people are known it
[1:33:29] from with spirits from underworld and
[1:33:33] you cannot fight spirits naturally Amen
[1:33:40] hallelujah we wrestle not against flesh
[1:33:43] and blood but against principalities and
[1:33:45] powers right so you know we got it we
[1:33:47] got to use spiritual weapons prayer is
[1:33:49] the greatest weapon that we can use
[1:33:51] prayer changes things
[1:33:53] amen listen and it came to pass when
[1:33:57] Stoll was a turn I need to try to read
[1:33:59] fast on this when it solves returned
[1:34:01] from following the Philistines that it
[1:34:02] was told him saying behold David is in
[1:34:05] the wilderness of India D then saw two
[1:34:07] three thousand chosen men out of all
[1:34:09] Israel went to seek David and his men
[1:34:11] and upon the rocks of the wild goats and
[1:34:13] it came to the Sheep coached by the way
[1:34:15] there was a cave and salt went in to
[1:34:19] cover his feet and David and his men
[1:34:20] remain in the size of the cave now they
[1:34:23] saw him come in may be had they had they
[1:34:26] had an opportunity to do some damage
[1:34:28] right here this and look at what
[1:34:29] happened and the men of David said unto
[1:34:31] Him boy they got excited their home the
[1:34:35] day with the Lord said look how they put
[1:34:39] the car all in this you know which the
[1:34:43] Lord said yea I say unto thee with the
[1:34:50] Lord fan to thee down hand that thou
[1:34:55] mayst do to him as it shall seem good
[1:34:58] unto thee then David arose and cut off
[1:35:00] the skirt of Saul's rule privily and it
[1:35:05] came to pass afterward that David's
[1:35:07] heart smote him because he had cut off
[1:35:09] saw skirt not ain't that something the
[1:35:11] man heck
[1:35:12] fiction from just cutting skirt he
[1:35:18] didn't kill him just cut it and he got
[1:35:21] conviction
[1:35:21] I wonder what convicts us and his men
[1:35:30] the Lord forbid that I should do this
[1:35:33] thing unto my master the Lord's anointed
[1:35:35] to stretch what my hand against him
[1:35:38] seeing he is the anointed of the Lord
[1:35:42] so David stayed his servants with these
[1:35:45] words and some of them not to rise
[1:35:47] against Saul but saw rose up out of the
[1:35:51] cave and went on his way
[1:35:53] David also arose afterward and went on
[1:35:56] went out of the cave and cried after
[1:35:58] Saul said my lord the King and when Saul
[1:36:01] looked behind him David stooped with his
[1:36:03] face to the earth and bowed himself I
[1:36:05] had to look at this and I was so glad
[1:36:07] that this came up in my Bible reading
[1:36:09] this ties into all those sermons that I
[1:36:12] preached and it goes right into the
[1:36:14] script over in second Peter 3
[1:36:15] I mean second Peter 1 we can start
[1:36:18] reading everything maybe verse 6 or 7 we
[1:36:20] picked that up in a second but but David
[1:36:24] exercised temperance David exercised
[1:36:30] temperance I was so blessed a man you
[1:36:34] know because I know that some of the
[1:36:36] Saints are exercising temperance I know
[1:36:39] that you see we're Christians we're from
[1:36:42] a we're citizens of another Kingdom and
[1:36:45] and the Holy Ghost that we got is not
[1:36:46] our Holy Ghost that just make us feel

[1:36:50] to act like Christ it's the Holy Ghost

[1:43:29] these things at temperance to it Oh

[1:43:51] and roll up your sleeves now see that
[1:43:57] see not that but talk with godly love
[1:43:59] temperance kindness is the way you want
[1:44:03] to be congregation says when you ride
[1:44:09] upon round not back round not back let
[1:44:14] him be your example when they said if
[1:44:16] thou be the Son of God turn these stones
[1:44:19] into bread he could have done it and
[1:44:21] show he was God but he had temperance
[1:44:25] when they called him
[1:44:27] Beelzebub he said I'll forgive you for
[1:44:30] it that's right they pull handfuls of a
[1:44:34] beard out of his face and spit in his
[1:44:36] face and said come down off the cross he
[1:44:38] said Father forgive them they don't even
[1:44:40] know what they're doing what an example
[1:44:43] of temperance and as believers if there
[1:44:46] was ever time to demonstrate that our
[1:44:48] lives are different than everybody
[1:44:50] else's it's right now let temperance be
[1:44:53] just oozing out of you 1st Peter 2:20
[1:45:05] first Peter 2 and 24 what glory is it if
[1:45:18] when you be buffeted of your folks now
[1:45:21] Buffett means to be struck repeatedly or
[1:45:24] violently to be battered now you're
[1:45:26] buffeted for your faults that mean you
[1:45:29] did something wrong you struck
[1:45:30] repeatedly they strike repeatedly at you
[1:45:33] violently bad I mean your batter because
[1:45:35] of something you did wrong
[1:45:37] he says for what glory is it when you be
[1:45:40] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[1:45:42] it patiently you ain't done nothing you
[1:45:44] was wrong a man but if when you do well
[1:45:48] and suffer for it you take it patiently
[1:45:51] this is acceptable with God but even
[1:45:56] here up to where you called because
[1:45:59] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[1:46:01] an example that we that you should
[1:46:03] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[1:46:07] was guile found in his mouth I'm going
[1:46:12] on who when he was reviled reviled not
[1:46:15] again so if you want to know what what
[1:46:17] Jesus do when he was reviled he reviled
[1:46:21] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:46:24] not but committed himself to him that
[1:46:26] judgeth righteously our sins in his own
[1:46:33] body on the tree that we being dead to
[1:46:35] sins should live unto righteousness by
[1:46:38] whose stripes you were healed revived
[1:46:40] reviled means to be criticized in an
[1:46:42] abusive and angrily insulting manner so
[1:46:48] you've been criticized and an abusive
[1:46:51] angrily insulting manner you're supposed
[1:46:54] to not revile again as a citizen of
[1:46:59] another Kingdom
[1:47:04] Lord the wind is almost gone Jesus the
[1:47:07] wind is almost gone but i'ma finish up
[1:47:09] God I want y'all to catch this quote
[1:47:15] here blasphemous names brother Branham
[1:47:19] preached a message statue of a perfect
[1:47:22] man and after statue perform a he
[1:47:23] preaches blasphemous names and he's
[1:47:26] making comments about you know the
[1:47:28] different virtues faith virtue knowledge
[1:47:31] temperance patience godless you know
[1:47:33] brotherly kindness and charity is making
[1:47:36] comments about then he makes a comment
[1:47:37] here and blasterz themes and this
[1:47:39] package says to my knowledge I add
[1:47:41] temperance self-control says I like that
[1:47:46] because tempers are self-control I like
[1:47:47] that look at this to my knowledge I add
[1:47:52] temperance self-control I like that my
[1:47:54] country tis of the crown my soul with
[1:47:56] self-control from sea to shining sea
[1:47:58] I just couldn't what is this why would
[1:48:06] the Prophet say something like this look
[1:48:10] at what he say to my knowledge I add
[1:48:12] temperance self-control I like that my
[1:48:17] country tis of thee ground my soul with
[1:48:21] self-control from sea to shining sea
[1:48:25] well he actually just integrated two
[1:48:29] songs two songs about our nation one of
[1:48:37] those songs a man is called America
[1:48:43] right and and I was I was just looking
[1:48:46] at this - the song says my country tis
[1:48:49] of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I
[1:48:56] sing he says land where my fathers died
[1:49:01] hallelujah land of the pilgrims pride
[1:49:04] from every mountainside let freedom ring
[1:49:10] even Martin Luther King got inspiration
[1:49:13] from this
[1:49:14] mmm when they talk about let freedom
[1:49:16] ring he got inspiration from this I Lou
[1:49:19] you glory to God the properties say it's
[1:49:21] a crown of my soul with self-control and
[1:49:24] then it goes into these Amen songs about
[1:49:27] the land of America because here we have
[1:49:30] a problem singing those songs there's a
[1:49:34] big stand has been taken that we're not
[1:49:36] gonna sing those songs but the
[1:49:38] properties say crown my soul with
[1:49:40] self-control my country tis of thee from
[1:49:45] seed to sign and see it's gonna take
[1:49:50] some self-control to be able to do what
[1:49:51] the prophets said let me give other song
[1:49:54] it's called America the Beautiful it
[1:49:57] says oh Beautiful for spacious skies for
[1:50:01] amber waves of grain for purple mountain
[1:50:06] Majesties above the fruited plain
[1:50:09] AMERICA AMERICA God shed His grace on
[1:50:13] thee and Crown thy good with Brotherhood
[1:50:19] from sea to shining sea I thought that
[1:50:28] was very very unique that a prophet
[1:50:30] would just kind of inject that and I
[1:50:32] think the Holy Spirit allowed him to say
[1:50:34] that because he knew the times in which
[1:50:36] we'd be living and how we gonna need
[1:50:38] some Holy Ghost temperance to make it
[1:50:40] through these out and make it through
[1:50:41] this hour all right let me just bring a
[1:50:46] closing quote here actually I'll finish
[1:50:49] reading that quote out of blasphemous
[1:50:52] names it says to my knowledge at I had
[1:50:56] temperance self-control I like that my
[1:50:57] country tissa t crown my soul of
[1:50:59] self-control from sea to shining sea see
[1:51:01] patience o my test it don't worry don't
[1:51:04] you worry Satan will count them for you
[1:51:06] Amen I'm climbing up the ladder now see
[1:51:08] I've added virtue knowledge temperance
[1:51:10] now I've got to add patience I still
[1:51:12] ain't got the Holy Ghost then after I
[1:51:14] had patience are godless you know what
[1:51:16] it what it is like god I
[1:51:18] don't misbehave myself go like a
[1:51:21] Christian gentleman let that not be a
[1:51:24] put-on hallelujah
[1:51:26] something in me the love of God just
[1:51:28] boiling see see not say I could I could
[1:51:32] do it but maybe I better not don't be
[1:51:34] like that
[1:51:35] he says see uh-huh is there any how so
[1:51:41] you said if you got to fight to keep it
[1:51:43] down in this day anyhow you got to pray
[1:51:45] that God deliver you from it he say it's
[1:51:46] a birth
[1:51:47] I've been birthed into this into this
[1:51:49] into this into this into this into this
[1:51:51] into this and then the love of God
[1:51:53] Christ comes down and seals all that
[1:51:56] upon me for service see praise the Lord
[1:52:00] all right all right all right
[1:52:06] all right let me just see I think I want
[1:52:09] to just bring one last quote this was as
[1:52:11] I was with Moses oh yeah as I was with
[1:52:17] Moses and just make sure that's what I
[1:52:20] want to do oh no no gods provided wait
[1:52:23] gospel by the way this is a quote that
[1:52:24] brother Branham makes here in West Palm
[1:52:27] Beach and I just want to bring this to
[1:52:28] you hallelujah Church were citizens of
[1:52:31] another Kingdom and hey I want to act
[1:52:35] like where I come from they man and see
[1:52:39] my actions now actually prove where I
[1:52:40] came from
[1:52:41] you understand it proves where I came
[1:52:43] from there's spirits all in the land and
[1:52:46] they pull in from every direction you
[1:52:48] got to watch what you see you got to
[1:52:49] watch what you hear because that
[1:52:51] influences you Amen look at this down
[1:52:54] brother brother and I made a statement
[1:52:55] here and I just want to leave you with
[1:52:57] this because it seemed like the add just
[1:52:59] came out the room it was a lot of a
[1:53:01] man's at first and everything it just I
[1:53:04] knew I was I knew I knew something
[1:53:06] that's been right when the amens get
[1:53:09] like that you can barely you got to pay
[1:53:11] for any man would you just give me an
[1:53:12] amen please do you know you don't say
[1:53:15] something right then you know that you
[1:53:17] don't hit the target and see I'm gonna
[1:53:20] tell you we're not we're not up here
[1:53:22] preaching for amen
[1:53:23] we're up here preaching so people can be
[1:53:25] set free hallelujah look at this
[1:53:30] now righteous man is not a sinless man
[1:53:34] for you notice he said Elijah was a man
[1:53:38] subject to like passions as we are he
[1:53:40] had his ups and downs and his
[1:53:43] differences and the scripture of his
[1:53:46] life proves that he had his ups and
[1:53:48] downs like we do and he had his times of
[1:53:51] wandering amen
[1:53:54] and it's times that his temple got away
[1:53:57] from him and he had a lot of things that
[1:54:00] went wrong but he was still a righteous
[1:54:03] man because he confessed his
[1:54:05] unworthiness and believed in God so
[1:54:08] that's what made him righteous
[1:54:10] we're not righteous within ourselves
[1:54:12] we're righteous through Jesus Christ I
[1:54:14] cannot be sanctified within myself I'm
[1:54:16] sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[1:54:18] stands in the presence of God in my
[1:54:20] place it isn't my holiness it's his
[1:54:23] holiness my holiness won't work at all
[1:54:25] but his does because God done accepted
[1:54:28] him and in accepting him he had to
[1:54:30] accept me because I'm in him amen that's
[1:54:33] what makes it real isn't it then we
[1:54:35] don't have to depend on ourselves now
[1:54:37] that doesn't make us say we can see in
[1:54:40] brother if you seen you just away from
[1:54:42] God that's all there's only one thing to
[1:54:45] do is confess and get right with God as
[1:54:47] long as your desire to sin the desire of
[1:54:50] sins still in your heart then it's time
[1:54:52] to stay down at the altar till that
[1:54:55] thing is taken out now you will see him
[1:54:57] you're about to sin you just can't help
[1:55:00] it but not willfully sin he that says
[1:55:03] willfully after he received the
[1:55:05] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:55:06] no more sacrifice for sin but everyday
[1:55:09] you're bound to sin look at what he says
[1:55:13] and you're bound to be backsliding
[1:55:15] constantly so it takes a constant prayer
[1:55:20] to God Paul said I die daily and if Paul
[1:55:25] had to die daily how much more am I
[1:55:28] going to have to stay there dead all the
[1:55:32] time if Paul had to die daily to stay
[1:55:34] right with God and so we have to do that
[1:55:37] just die out
[1:55:38] self and that's getting God's wait now
[1:55:41] there's only two ways of anything that's
[1:55:44] the right way and the wrong way and then
[1:55:48] ways are your ways and God's ways and
[1:55:52] you can't be in your way and God's Way
[1:55:57] at the same time you've got to forget
[1:56:00] your own way to get in God's Way and you
[1:56:04] got to get out of your own way to get in
[1:56:07] God's Way for as long as you're in your
[1:56:09] way you're out of his way so forsake
[1:56:14] your way forsake your thoughts forsake
[1:56:19] everything and just rely on one thing on
[1:56:23] thus saith the Lord that's all then you
[1:56:26] know you're right
[1:56:29] citizens of another Kingdom god bless
[1:56:35] you
[1:56:36] [Applause]
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:43] let's pray father we are grateful to
[1:56:49] know that we are citizens of another
