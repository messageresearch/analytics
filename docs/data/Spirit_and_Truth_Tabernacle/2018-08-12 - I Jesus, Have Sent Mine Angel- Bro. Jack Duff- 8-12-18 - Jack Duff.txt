one I'm listening they're in my office and brother Solomon got everybody going on that Psalms 115 see my where you gonna stop the service out but you get get going like that and he went old-school on us that was nice I like that it was real real good but we just we just think the Lord I did want to a man certainly thank God for brother Maurice and man being with us on today in that surgeon didn't happen and man and I know this is a steam in here they man Billy been all right god bless you good to have you Sarah silver and brother Thailand amen also from Sarasota a man so so good to have them in fellowship with us all today man you all it's a tradition here that right before the kids go back in school we like to have prayer over them so after the preaching of the word good thing we want to do that for all of our students that will be a man going back to school teachers as well we want to just anoint you and pray over you before a man and you go back and on Friday we have a actually guest minister is going to be here speaking for so just wanna we're gonna have service it's a brother I've been trying to connect with for quite some time and we finally got it sorted out for this fraud and I know that typically third Friday we don't have service but amen we also didn't have it this Friday and we also didn't have the Friday before that so we're gonna have Church this Friday a man so I've just trust that you all be flexible amen than that and I know there's a number of things coming up a man in the next few weeks where I know there's a wedding coming up we won't have a service on that night because of the wedding you know but I know that up but you know we'll continue to do all we can for the Lord amen so I am wanna just thank the Lord for everybody that was involved with the Okeechobee back-to-school outreach we it was it was it was very successful and so I had some brothers that went out and you know just handing out flyers and things like that some went to the Walmart some went to the neighborhood but you know that that turned out nice assistant dean and everyone that helped her just kind of get the bags together I think we took roughly a hundred and something bags or something like that from what they were telling me and I think we gave my baby a man of them on yesterday praise our Lord a man Lolita God so the people responded you know we had some signs also that we're holding up you know they're on the street and and they responded that came and there were some that we we said look we what we want to do is tonight at six o'clock we want you to bring your students back because we want to have prayer over them before they go in school and you know and I said what all these school shootings and everything we need to cover our children in prayer so something like that's right that's right we appreciate y'all doing that and I'm gonna say roughly 15 kids came back last night a prayer and you know and you know some of the Saints was running a little late we wanted him to get into the service you know but some of the sames was running a little late so brother smiles say look I don't want to kind of hold them here and you know keep them hostage so they say what I want to do is just go ahead and pray over them and then we'll start the service we'll invite them to it you don't invite them to search they want to stay they can but we want at least at least pray for them so we did that before service we read a script over and prayed over them knowing them with oil and you know and and and just trying to be a light in that community all right so I think that this gonna be something that we will you know we will continue to do and and serving this appreciate sister Tina for our efforts now amen praise the Lord a man you know and here's my thing I think sometimes we different ones I can you know you all have different annoying things each one of you have a have something that God has called you to do for the kingdom right and so when you find what your anointing is other people need to kind of get behind you to help help you amen to get things done so here's what I'm gonna ask cuz we're gonna do this again but this is the way you do it I'm gonna give you a secret okay back to school they got all kind of stuff selling they selling right now but at the school start a lot of stuff gonna go on sale I mean half price three quarters of price 90% right so here's my thing I know y'all sisters and I know y'all be in them shops right so when you out there and you see one of them 90% pick it up bring it cuz we're gonna use that for the next time we go out right you can get a book bag minor percent off buy it please buy it right don't just call and say I saw something on it no no no I ain't asking you to do that I'm asking you to pick it up right Amen you you might have to sacrifice what you was going by huh brothers too if y'all like there I don't know I'll be out there I don't be out there so if the brothers out there y'all get it too right but but but trust me you know I can I know how sisters is you know they'll override that thing in no time you don't get your 90 percent you're gonna flash your override car but but uh but but I'm just asking everybody just please just get it and you know we'll we'll store it because what we saw yesterday we really feel like this is something that the Lord has blessed and we'll be able to go forward with this just to be a blessing there in the community and we're concentrating there in Okeechobee you know we're concentrated in there we you know the church there is going through a lot but last night we thank God my precious sister was in service last night a man and we're very happy to see her very happy to see her so you know sometime it just you know just do little things just little things you know and you just never know how God a blessing while we were there we found that there were some people from West Palm Beach that happen to be in Okeechobee you know why we was giving things out so you know if they live here if we got a little car guess what we tell them where I took Jesus right so God know how to do things right so so I just want to appreciate everybody for all their efforts and and just you know it was just really really a blessing a manner or yesterday brother Steven and sister Rachel and and my wife and my daughter Rebecca my mother-in-law a man's just a cop they were all there and it was hot but they right there giving giving it all out and given the best it can and my daughter was out there with a sign and she was oh y'all shoulda saw I thank my wife probably got a video of her she might need a new job you know the way she was out there turn that side maybe that's a lot of people was coming uh but uh but but it was it was it was a blessing hey man we just we just want to say thank you to everybody that just made them and all those that prayed just thank you thank you I really believe it was a tremendous success and I could see some of the saints in Okeechobee they when they saw these young people come into the church you know like this room y'all efforts yeah yeah you know you don't know what gotta do right all we got to do it just get started all right but they so about 15 and the parents bringing them to the church right we don't know what'll happen here so so since that worked and we're gonna take the same date throw it out there till we look something all right hail and church so and I know it's something I well but let's do it for here no no no don't go against what we're trying to do we doing we focusing on Okeechobee that's what we focusing on amen praise the Lord well God is good god is good so thank you all so much hey man so now I heard one birthday that's just a down okay happy birthday to her and then my Reese just had a birthday who Nick just had a birthday it oh yeah birthday Tuesday my all right Nick well my brother got a special birthday on Tuesday this is business this is a big one it's a big one but he was singing this morning and you got there BNC you got to be spiritual hey I got my mind made up and I won't turn back I'm going to see my Jesus someday you know and then then thing I think is goodbye world I stayed a longer with you goodbye pleasures I've seen I stay no longer with you and this is a personal thing I made up my mind to go God's Way Oh y'all don't get again the rest of my life I made up my mind the go God's Way the rest of my life this is born born born again thank God I'm born again see that's not all everything that y'all look at it as a medley but to him that was a testimony brother Troy wants you to sing especially I got one for ya what the devil he is the Lord the Lord has done a mighty work and you know and ever since God's done the work the devil just been attacking left and right with this and with that but I'm here today to announce so that they'll you still alive see what he's celebrating the big one-five-zero happy birthday to brother Troy hey man 5:01 of the devil thought he was going like a mop until you got here but the devil failed and we're so happy a man just just to be a part of the journey a man aware where the Lord has brought him and you know as brothers we talking and we realized you know man we used to be the young people we used to be and can't mercy God sometimes we try to act like we still there but you know our responsibilities change and we have a we have a focus now a man to to pour into the next generation amen you know because you know the Lord promises threescore and ten and if God if God was not gracious to us and he you know when we get past you know threescore and ten that's God's grace that's giving you that right but if you if you know God kept his word at threescore and ten like he did without dad he'd let him get one year past that pretty much sin Demi you know we called him home that gives us about twenty years about twenty years and we got to give God all we got in these twenty years and and and one of the things that's been in my heart and you know what we've been praying for and the brothers prayer meet and we're asking God you know I some of us in school or college and things that made some we try to get to this sermon here shortly but we're in school or college and you know we got our next generation of doctors next generation of nurses our next generation of IT professionals and then our next generation of carpenters our next generation of electricians a man but where's the next generation of Deacons where is the next generation of preachers where's the next generation of song leaders where is the next generation and and that's that's what we're that's what we want to see not just people tap it into their earthly vision right and it's okay to have an earthly vision because without a vision you'll perish so I'm not speaking against that but but you got to you got to realize that you are here for much greater than you profession God got you here for something much greater than that and sometimes the devil will anoint you and put you in certain areas where you can't get to what God got you here for amen right so so this is why you know our prayers been Lauri's this up right raise this up I mean you know who I'm gonna get this mic to if I only got 20 years if if who do I give it to who who can the church have confidence in so yeah I mean this is you know we're not when I come up you know we were faithful in the early ages right we were faithful people people knew that we were committed to God right and when they saw that commitment was very easy right for them to you know just kind of hear you know what I've seen the hand of God just on this on this brother for years so you know I can I can flow with that right but but when you got up and down in and out shifting sands right what what the next generation gonna look like huh Oh glory all right so so that this is this is why we praying for it I'm not just going to talk about I'm gonna start praying about it and we want to see that next generation rise you know David had a chance to see the next king before he gave the kingship over Moses had a had a chance to work with the next leader before he actually gave the the leadership baton over Joshua raised up in the church right so so so so you know we're looking for this and and and you know you got to get yourself in position where you can be qualified to do some things for the Lord never mess your life up and you can't do nothing y'all y'all me you know just just just stick around we got ours while I was in Washington DC I was riding with this brother he was telling this thing that they do he the pastor gave him this responsibility and he's one of the ministers in the church a young minister but he said the pastor gave me responsibility where he has to work with some of the young young people to help them get jobs so like if they if they ain't doing nothing with their life he meets with them one on one to find out what they next step is so you're not working right now okay that's fine that's right but you're gonna get a job right where you want to work at well I what do you want to do with your life and that brother works with them and today actually get to where they need to go I say that's good idea so you know I came back and I shared with brother Quentin and brother Troy and they say okay we'll take that burden no and they're gonna be working with the young brothers that might need a little guidance they gonna spend time with you the first thing they want is your resume all right but they're gonna be spending time with the brothers now I got I got my brothers but I'm gonna need somebody to kind of step up and want to do that with the sisters a man cuz I don't want young sisters going to these brothers y'all got it right y'all understand me I want the sisters to go to the sisters and their brothers are go to the brothers how are you but we don't we don't invest and pour into our young people amen so they can be ready for the next to carry the next wave hallelujah glory you get to a certain age you all might not realize it but it's sort of at a certain age you get to your early thirties late 20s early 30s before you go in the 40 that that's the backbone of the church that group right there is the backbone amen so you want as many people in that that they should be settled in they mind they should be settled in their jobs right that's that that group should be help able to help carry to work on the Lord because the older generation out there they're getting to retirement age fixed income things of that nature I'm just talking fixed income and they might not be able to do all the things that you can do God call you because you strong alright and they called all because of the wisdom and when you got to church with the old and the young working together you got something good if you got a church is just full of young people now y'all hear me hear me well if you get into a church and it's just full of young people that's a rebellious Church and if you read your Bible every time you saw a rebellious King rise his kingdom did not last rebellion is as the sin of all right so when you're looking for a church you want to see the you want to see that the older generation middle aged young people and some babies coming up in it you want to see the whole package alright praise the Lord that lets you know that thing okay this is probably a good good you know a good place to be but uh but so you know we're going to be working a man with the the younger Amen brothers just trying to help you know steer them in the right direction sometimes this is a very critical phase in life because you can make some terrible decisions that will that will mess up your life right so so the GAR gets put some people around you to help you in same thing with the sisters you got you got some sisters in here but I'm just mentioned this and then I see who the Lord deals with a man and if the Lord deal with you then we'll talk praise the Lord because I want to know what you're doing oh oh I just feel lead to talks not you hey man somebody I got you know I'm sorry I'm sorry the old I get the mo pastor against a man but I got I got a small window in front of me and and I remember the brand I'm said he said when he got around the same age he said I wish I would have served God a little bit more when I was younger I wish I would have got started a little a little bit a little bit a little bit earlier right you get to this age you start thinking about things a little different and now and I know for myself I got a I got a small window and I'm gonna try to do all I can in that window for the Lord everything I can for God I'm trying to do it I'm just so dedicated committed to Christ hey man so what so I just want to encourage us and again so we got we start with the brothers and sisters if you all aim and just pray and you know maybe the Lord just putting us in my heart and and and and I just feel like it you know it needs to be older sisters a man older sisters doing that praise the Lord Oh dirt I ain't call you over I said Oh dirt amen you need to be somebody don't went through something because you can't tell nobody nothing if you ain't been through nothing ain't number the truth amen you got to go through some things you got to experience life a man praise the Lord all right all right all right so let me read a scripture a man and I'm I'm kind of going back into my archives this morning a man I wanted to just just just just Minister a man something that I administered in the past some have heard it some have not but I know to be different today Amen even though we've we've heard it I'm going to read a couple scriptures let's start with Isaiah 54 and verse 13 this is really for our youth a man as they're going back into schools as well as even our teachers I want to just Minister something that would just kind of help you a man praise the Lord as you go back school is change and man thinking things have changed it used to be we could sit our kids at school and feel okay bye synonym but now we have to man we got to pray everyday right but here in Isaiah 54 13 says and all that children shall be of the Lord and great shall be the piece of that children all that children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the piece of that children I'm gonna leave that there I want to go over here to Deuteronomy 31 and 6-man Deuteronomy 31 and 6 praise the Lord and then I have one more after that that will read Deuteronomy 31 and 6 it says this be strong and of a good courage I fear not nor be afraid of them for the LORD thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake me and then he will not fail thee nor forsake me he goes with thee he would not fail thee nor forsake me a man can we read one more revelation 22 a man and 16 praise the Lord and says this I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray before we see the Father we thank you for the reading of the word but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarity to what it is that we have read and we trust God that you would just get the glory the honor out of out of the sermon here today bless and encourage and strengthen every heart in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated so we're gonna take our title right from revelation 22 and 16 it says I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things and the churches I am the root and offspring of David the bright morning star will title I Jesus have sent mine angel amen I Jesus have sent mine angel you know we were just this week we were we my daughter Rebecca was graduating from college receiving her bachelor's degree which we certainly thank God man for her accomplishing that and while we were there preparing for the graduation or they were rushing us all into the auditorium and you know we get into the auditorium we're sitting down and saying graduation is gonna start in five minutes two graduations gonna start in three minutes we need everybody see the graduations I'm starting in one minute we need everybody seated so we you know we're sitting down and you know got all kind of things that were that we got into a certain area that we're sitting and and you know my family wanted to move to another area and we went to move follow this one family over to that same area to the middle you know we were sitting on the less that what they said never we want to sit in the middle you know jump up the gusset the middle and it's lady uh she looks at me she says sir sir sir the reason that I moved was because of you right and she said I'm allergic to flowers like oh you can't tell me that ma'am I want to just see the graduation you know and she landed on the flowers I'm allergic to that's why I moved because okay okay nope I might go back to over here and you can you can have that area and you know so as we were sitting there and then we get an announcement everybody exit the auditorium immediately and they didn't tell us why right so you know we're leaving the auditorium and we're going out you know outside and you know since they didn't tell us anything we just kind of hanging out you know we will wait here until we can go back in they gave us these little tickets say you got to show this ticket to get back in I said hold on to the ticket I go back in so you know we found a little air conditioner spot we sat there and everybody else is moving but we stayed in the AC so us I say I say we tell us nothing I'm just stay right here till it's time to go in there I saw people coming get out get out what are they doing you know so you know we finally get to the point where we finally start being obedient right and we're leaving and as we're leaving I said not hold on before we leave this property where are the graduates those are where the graduates they say they they write in here I said okay I said I'm not going anywhere until I get my daughter and one fella coming pretty much say you're gonna tell me what you're not gonna do sir I'm not going anywhere until I get my daughter right we need to graduate because I don't y'all even explained nothing to nobody I said we need to I just need my doing and we'll we'll gladly leave so you don't let the graduates out and I got you know we got Rebecca we moved on and we come to find out as we were outside that there had been a threat that somebody's going to shoot in the graduation all right and someone's going to shoot now here's the sad parts that we live in a society where we can't even attend graduations when we live in a society where anytime we go out in public we need to be prayed up right amen we live in a society where I mean they would almost want you just living in a in a state of fear all the time right but but but here here's my encouragement to the body of Christ God has not given us the spirit of fear right so so so so even when we go to school we got to be prayed up right I mean you don't I mean right you know we thought Columbine was out a man and way out in Colorado somewhere things like that don't happen in Florida - last year parkland right so so so it doesn't matter where we send our kids we need to make sure that my children are clever all the Meuse something that can keep him holy they made that our children need to be covered underneath the blood of the Lord Jesus glory to God hey that's so so so so you know when I realized it enough that I just kind of feel the reason they can do anything cuz the proud of Jesus Christ was in that place not that simple - right amen hallelujah I'm crazy enough to believe God's promises now let's go put myself in harm's way amen but I know if I found myself in some weights amen and I got a right to be there then I'm expecting the bond devil Satan I'd punch you in the name of Jesus a Mingo shoot nothing round here a thousand may fall of us well it crazy to believe dog hallelujah somebody I'm crazy to believe it about this to my child I love to disputed God will protect my job if I gotta walk out here God gonna protect me [Music] you [Music] like this I'm not gonna live like this you know when I watched even how they handled us and pushed us out now okay you say there's a shooter but you know you you just pushed us out in the open and all of us just became targets you could have contained them if you just put a perimeter around the auditorium whistle police and it's the police oh you want a containment but you need all of us sign and put us in harm's way it goes to show that that mankind is not smart enough to fight these demons if they're not smart enough they can't come up with a plan that's good enough to actually overcome these demons you're gonna need something else to overcome these Devils and I want to tell y'all something amen you're gonna need the Holy Ghost amen you're gonna need the Holy Ghost young people they especially you that are age that know the difference from right and wrong now your parents prayers don't go so far but it can only go so far you gonna have to carry the rest of the way now you put yourself in harm's way hanging with the wrong people doing the wrong thing that's your thought and if you ain't got no scripture say no that's why God keep you in a holy cow the Holy Ghost appeal no I want to read something to you hey man because the Bible say something and psalm 34:7 the Bible says that angel of the lord encamps them that fear him and delivered them and psalm 34:7 the angel of the Lord and camped with a round about them that fear him and delivers them I love this I love this the angel of Lord and campus round about them that fear him and delivers them now now now now if we just look at that now read the quote for you a little bit just just look at the word the angel or only in camps around certain people [Music] and brother branham said an angel Lord does not a camp around sinners the age of the Lord and carefully round about them that fear him those that are serving him that angel protects them thereby better do not serving God you can't apply the scripture they made you become a target for the enemy I want just be honest with you the devil I ain't trying to get those that are already on his side they Palmas looking for you and if he can destroy you the promise they come this deal kill and destroy and if he can destroy you people I get help or something huh see so look at this and questions and answers amen part for the Prophet makes this statement he says explain about each person's angel who advised with them from birth now if you notice now this is pretty deep just what the problem say this is pretty deep Sigma I just picked it up he says now part of us wrote in tight and the other one is with the pizza up in so now there is an angel but this angel the Lord that are careful about those that fear him that fears him see now it isn't promised that sinners has angels it's only the redeemed has angels so did you know that the angels of the Lord that kept about those that fear him now angels are messengers I want you to notice it's so perfect it'll prove predestination to you see and notice not a title our Jesus have sent mine angel right this is what we're talking about before you actually go into these a man situations that could turn very my it could be a nightmare before you know it right before you go to the I want to encourage it I Jesus have already sent mine angel hallelujah but that angels only go with those that are routine and then if you are seven you cannot apply this so my advice to you is get saved don't leave Church not knowing that your heart is not right with God hallelujah amen let's go a little further Oh hallelujah let's go to the Queen of Sheba a man a man look at this look at this I got a couple things I need to read it says notice this generation wicked adulterous will seek after son and they will get it he says what God has found the sign of the resurrection he is not dead but he's alive how our religion is not a history it's a living fact it's a living God it's a living experience as it was in the days of Jonah now as he went along he give another expression he said and as it was in the days of Solomon back in the days of Solomon when God sends a gift to the earth if the people receive it it becomes a golden age to them if they reject it it becomes a chaos to them and then look what happened when Jesus was God's message to the people and they rejected it look what happened to the people that rejected it in the days of Solomon sermons rain any Minister knows that was a golden age for Israel the greatest age they built the temple they had no worlds to mount anything and they had a power of God among them I've that gift was so great to all the nations around about fear there now it makes this statement here says listen brother what we need today we don't need atomic shelters he says what we need is the baptism of the holy spirit see ain't no place to run the only place to run is in Christ the Bible say the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and safe Alleluia I told y'all that testimonial last week I believe was how you know this plane is going it actually wasn't even lifting they was going down the runway there in Mexico and and as their blameless was headed down I guess they didn't announce to the people that there was a problem but as that thing was kind of coming to give her at his crash you heard a man I don't know who he was I don't know if he was the pilot I don't know who he was hallelujah but the man knew he could call on Jesus and then man say in the name of Jesus and I mean it's only about five seconds oh my god if your life was coming to an idea what would be the last he was becoming in your mouth Peter's plane as pastor in the name of Jesus and it's a since I'm in Mexico I might as well stay away can he understand me and then this language - it ain't no big thing soups and all I heard is that everybody on the plane was speared huh I don't know if there were other believers on the plane he might have been the only believer but because he was there huh because he was there everybody else was protected and that's the way you know when I'm gonna screw because I'm here oh this is this is and then that don't happen to me and like God unless God allow it I live it in no fear I'm not living in no fear no no not here not here not here just a bizarre thing real quick I'm not living in no fear and you can tell it that because I'm covered and now when the devil know you weren't covered you go you might have to wake up in the morning with a little fear mama pray for me Texas security mama proof of it when you're gonna pray for yourself all right if these things don't run you to Christ I don't know what will all right let me go on it says listen brother what we do today we don't need atomic shelters we don't need atomic shells what we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit you know as I was going through the whole exercise on Tuesday I realized there was a lot of ways that people could have just did whatever they want to do to us first of all you got us out here as what week when I call sitting ducks you got us out here like that and then we get in our cars and traffic is at a halt where you going if I got you now I can be in a tree just pick it everybody off right amen Oh God and is not my thought I mean more to make sure I say that the right way because it's going the Internet somebody think that I'm some type of that ain't me and what I'm trying to tell you is that you know all our planning all our human reasoning a man is not enough to fight Devils we need to get back to the Holy Ghost let me tell you if the if the if the the shooter had the hole they go see would have a gun a man right so we need to get people in church let them get the Holy Ghost praise God that'll change that's God's nature dwelling inside of a man that changes everything changes his desires changed everything about him oh my god I got something else to read here let me he says they listen brother what we need that we don't need atomic shelters what we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit nations will fear if the whole United States that claims to be a Christian will fall under the power of God there will be so many things happen to here so every nation will be afraid to turn an atomic bomb loose right he is our refuge he is our strip I still got buckler how are all in all I mean I got another one here that I want to read amen this is out of the message God commissioning a man Moses Oh blessed be the name of the Lord we got to know who we are praise God a man a man a man it shall not come nigh thy dwelling it shall not a man listen he says yes brother hallelujah you can go and I know a lot of them guys that's absolutely received Holy Ghost backyard the number number of men on the field of day but it's a shame to confess it hallelujah but I'm one Baptist that received the baptism Holy Ghost and belen and believe it with all my heart and teach it hallelujah I will stay true to the old word yes sir and God's confirmed it through the entire world when standing there in Durban Africa I said to these great bunch of Baptist ministers were standing there having a supper Jewish Hospital they had a staff of the doctors down there talkin divine healing some great miracles happened around Louisville and said what about this now look at this look at this and one of the doctor said well I tell you I found this that the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with this makeup that's what the doctor said the greatest power is not an atomic bomb the greatest power is not so merit of a cake but the greatest power is a believer in contact with his makeup Oh hallelujah you got to know that you can call on the name of Jesus you got to know that when you call something gonna happen the greatest power in the world not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature everything see this when a person comes in contact with God things change and this is why is important for us to kind of stress the importance of having the Holy Ghost there was one statement brother Graham says absolutely essential necessary compulsory that we receive the Holy Ghost now right don't play games with this your only protection it's found underneath the blood of the Lord Jesus back in the days of Moses when the Death Angel is passing through the land what Moses gave them instructure's say look you have to put blood on the top of your door and on the stock clothes on the top of the door and on the side post you say every house that has that blood apply then the death angel will pass over and not strike that firstborn son dead right but if you did not have the blood apply you were a open target for the death death angel brother branham told us that that that blood applied a man in the evening time it was representative of the Holy Ghost being applied to our lives I think we receiving the back to the Holy Ghost without it we are an open target to the devil I want to stress I want to stress it you'll see you know we can preach these things but if you ain't really where you need to be a man you might be walking into some trouble but but but but but but if you serving God the way that you're supposed to serve them right not not the not you know hallelujah amen you know you you're not a Christian because your mama's a Christian your dad is a Christian right you're Christian because you actually you but you decided to walk the same walk that they did right the angel Lord only encamps around those that fear him and deliver them all right let's go on a little further here I Jesus have sent my angel one more quote here I want to read a man out of expectation they don't want to pick up a couple scriptures what man calls great God calls foolish God calls great and what man calls foolish God calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings right there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer where we'll change the mind of God okay and we're gonna go into that little further if prayer can changed the mind of God prayer can show stop the devil in his tracks hallelujah but if you live in a life where you don't know God go hear your prayer right then it's hard to pray but when you know that he's pleased with the life that you live it it's easier to say oh my god them two words a color on the scene just like Oh hallelujah Church I'm say and I don't take much I'm telling stings like this i'ma just share this testimony I heard and I won't call it a brother's name but I shared a testimony and one of the brothers was it was just I the Lord had a dream and in the dream he saw himself in the casket and it saw his son looking over at his body and and when they woke up he just kind of felt this fear said now you need to pray over that I pray against them but I rebuked that in the name of Jesus so all I said I rebuked that in the name of Jesus not know long to our prayer just I rebuke it in the name of Jesus well later on that day he was there working on this vehicle it's underneath the car and I was sitting that car dropped and start moving why he was underneath it and it was get Marie to roll right over the top nobody was there he got from underneath it and he saw the cars roll right on down to the street now what it was God was showing him ahead of time and had he not repented had he not repented then he would have fulfilled but his prayer this prayer changed it right and see we got to get to a spot hallelujah well we have so left spirit of god that we can fix this thing before a cop maybe is popular I wait a minute wait wait wait before you go out the day I need to pray over you again wait hold on something ain't right I play a kid and levels Gus puppy Follies right Halloween you start repeating them government and go to school to come to find out you know in my class oh that's why God had me rebuked that thing one time brother branham was you know the Lord woke him up or something like then he was praying and in a vision he saw chip going down and he prayed and he didn't know where the ship was he just prayed he just prayed and and when he prayed he got news later on that this ship was on his way overseas somewhere and it was going down but somehow the sister ship was rescued and all of the passengers were safe one person's prayer changed the outcome let's see wait you know i'ma just be honest I don't think we spiritual enough I don't think we spiritual enough where God can even speak to us and if there was ever a time where people needed to hear from God that time is right now that time is right now we need them know that we don't heard from God hallelujah your prayer changes things in this Court I won't read the rest of it but I just tell you is that the Prophet I mean the King Hezekiah was the prophet Isaiah went to him and told him I says look you're gonna die just get your house in order you don't die and the Prophet turned I mean the King turned his face to the wall and they say he said Lord I'm not ready to die and he and the good thing about the king is that he was able to tell God what he'd already done oh don't you don't don't get this twisted not what he was gonna do and that's the way it slaughter us pray Lord if you spare me then I do this know why don't you tell god what you already done deal see here he is a lord I did this and Lord I did that I did this God told the Prophet turn around and go right back mm see I heard your prayer and I'm giving you 15 more years prayer changed the mind of God if prayer could change the mind of God prayer would show stop the devil in his tracks you better know the weapon that you got hallelujah the God that you serve is a big God hallelujah all right so as we I just wanted to kind of bring this there are different situations that have come up in scripture oftentimes it might have been Amen in the hour of distress a man a very critical point where we saw the angel the Lord will show up a man an angel or so the Bible say I Jesus have sent mine angel so before before we even go into these situations we have another angel Lord is already there already there waiting to protect us waiting to shield us waiting to you know do whatever it takes the angel Lord is already there amen before you go in glory so so a lot so I'm going to go through some scriptures here because we see a man in Scripture that there are a number times in the our distress that God showed up and if God showed up in the Bible and he's the same yesterday today and forever then we ought to expect that same God to show up today hallelujah hallelujah amen this time it wasn't an hour of distress in this particular situation it was just a critical decision had to be made and and this was a story of Eliezer with with Abraham and when and when Eliezer got the instruction for Abraham go back to my people and find my my son a wife from amongst my people I don't want him to get married to these ladies down here I won't go back home and finally find them away well he gave him and said look now and he's being an accident I what if I can't find her what a word of this and what if that and then Abraham told them something in in Genesis 24 and 7 he made a statement here to him glory to God and I'm gonna read this quote on this one he says Eliezer a man the Bible say Elian concerned that the woman would not come back with him Abraham said the Lord shall send His angel before thee so before Eliezer showed up to where Rebecca was the angel God was already there hallelujah say the Lord shall send this angel before thee and thou shalt take a light unto my son from this now there's a statement Amen let me see if I got it here I hope I still you know I might I might have misplaced it oh my god I might have to just quote it off off of my off memory if y'all don't mind but what brother Branham says that's what God does is that he sends his angel hallelujah with His Messenger so when ELISA did this he said that god dammit because the Lord don't send this angel before you get there and he's got a little bit of worthless thing out and we know the end of the story because when he got there he played the way say let the woman that come and just and not just give me water but give my camera's water let her be the one Rebekah walk laughter and did exactly what he prayed about because God has sent his angel before ELISA captor the angel is there hallelujah and not only was the angel there but God sent the angel with the messenger and we've seen that God has sent his angel with his messenger when you see that pillar of fire on top of brother branham's head God sent the angel with the messenger Oh hallelujah now can I read a scripture for you can I read a scripture for you this is a let me just find it real quick because uh hallelujah you want protection you want covering Exodus 23 God sends the angel with the messenger Exodus 23 hallelujah now though some of y'all might be afraid to do this but we did it when we was in school Amen you might be afraid to carry your Bible I got it on my phone sometimes people need to see you with your just water in your hand and make them they make them approach you look differently don't don't be afraid to be called church boy a church girl ain't nothing wrong with that actually get protection you get protection huh when you get that name there and people people watching over you to protect you well what is God does in an angel the cavalry influence you know area oh my god hallelujah thinking about another testimony I heard I think of this week or something like that brother Troy shared with how he went to school with his Bible in his hand and and and this word got real real real tough guy he start playing games with him stop them and doing all counting things and trying to embarrass him in front of everybody so uh pressing out hey man you can't do that like when what you're gonna do about it well let's let's step outside it stepped outside and everybody everybody starts sweating up Oh Troy and Troy probably in trouble brother Troy get out of my side he grabbed him by the hand said man what's the matter what are you doing this man you don't have to do this I mean I'm not here to fight you I'm just trying to understand cuz me and you we've been real good friends why why you do me like this why are you doing me start talking to him start talking to the next day you know cuz see the Bible said soft answer does way turn the way around right and any brother he brought it all the way back down and and and the guy just looked at brother trust that you're just too nice you wait too nice and so he say he said man you know man anybody mess with you I'm I'm gonna take him so the teacher saw my side she said y'all get back in his class he went back in the class was so sis this guy had done brother Troy that way not arrested fasting Oh since he did it I can do it now they stopped and that's what brother Troy so the guy said hey hey leave him alone God will make your enemies your Christian so this word but don't offend the angel chemical can I go here look at this in Exodus Exodus Exodus 23 verse 20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary to us to Dynamis err when I wrote that I said if God is for me who can be against me but this cash if you obey the voice of the angel hallelujah now that can go into many different places remember that aim that goes with the messenger the angel did apply some shop with the messenger and the angel goes with it so don't don't don't don't don't don't don't think you can be out there a man in now and criticizing god's prophet and expect some protection you're gonna get no protection criticizing god's prophet watch a conversation somebody get talking like that you need to excuse yourself alright God sent his angel but now you don't want you to offend the angel all right all right let me go on y'all y'all can keep reading the rest of it cuz there's a lot more in that because there's another little part you get down to it like verse verse 30 in there you talk about how he not gonna drive your enemies away all of a sudden but they say he'll do it little by little I got a move on but little by little he'll drop them away here's your hip oh my god my gosh you get one trouble making the class and stir it up trouble for everybody else all they see one leave another leave another only what God doing little by little bow drawn your enemies away Oh glory glory glory glory glory all right let me move on I'm telling you Jesus done already sent the angel the protection is already there you ain't got to be afraid a man no fear for the for the for the Bride of Christ now any time like I say the hour of distress God does this if you go back and look at scripture a man with the Hebrew boys when they were cast into the fiery furnace when they were throwing in the King was you know so it so offended that they would not bow down and worship this God that he created and brother Branham said was a God about it was a holy man that Nebuchadnezzar had created and and he wanted them to bow down and the holy man was an image of Daniel and he wanted the Hebrew boys to bow down and worship there's any say they say if y'all don't we gonna heat the fire up seven times hotter than it ever was and we're gonna throw you in it's a king they said King look this is our our testimony we know that I God can deliver us but if he chooses not to let it be written in your books that we did not bow to your image hallelujah it's a royalty y'all fellas thank y'all something County strongest men in the kingdom threw him into the fire after heated up seven times honor and why are they in the fire that the strongmen were burned going into the fire the strongmen were burned going in but then he the King got up and he looked inside the fire saying I wait a minute I know I threw three men in but why is it that I see four and not only that say this fourth will look like the Son of God now I want y'all to read that because we all stop at that part that that was a summer guy and I believe it was the son of God but let's read the rest of that amen and Daniel Amen Chapter three hallelujah let's read the rest of that amen and dire distress school situations God likes to send his angel oh yes he does yes he does a man and if he did it here in the Bible days and I'm expecting him to do it a man today I would stop let's start here day three I want to read real quick here a man start at verse 20 a man here in Daniel three and it commanded the most mighty men that were in his moment and his arm and upon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast him into the fire burning fiery furnace then these men were bound in their coats their hoses and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the of the fire furnace of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto him to the king true o king he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt hallelujah and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and speakers as Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you servants of the Most High God come forth and come hither then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego King full of the midst of the fire look at it and the princes governors and captains and the Kings counsellors being gathered together saudis man upon whose bodies the fire had no power the fire had no power over them a man out of gun control laws may not have any control today but with a protection of the holy spirit we ain't got to worry about none of this listen he says the fire had no power nor was a hair of the head of their head since neither was their coach change nor the Seraphim I passed on them and verse 28 is Keith then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego why who have sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him God sent his angel at the time of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and I can go a little further God also sent an angel at the time of Daniel in the lion's den huh when Peter was in jail God sent an angel and deliverer Peter from jail God has always in the business of sending his angel to protect his people so we ain't got nothing to fear I Jesus have already sent mine angel I know we go into some trouble in times trouble trouble trouble trouble times we don't and you're you you I know if I had kids going I'd be just as concerned as any other parent in here but I want to tell you that you're covered under the blood of Jesus Christ and that blood that covers you protects you keeps you and it don't keep you up at night worrying hallelujah because the Bible say he gives his beloved sleep God don't want you up up at night worrying God wants to just trust him put him in God's care yeah set his angel can we go a little further oh yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord I told you how prayer is the most powerful weapon let me finish description I want to get over the ax 12 it says blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who have sent his angel delivered his service that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve no worship any God except their own God all right all right all right if you pick up Daniel 6 you'll see it right there and Daniel 6 as well but we're not going to read that for the sake of time I want to go to acts 12 the most powerful weapon you got is prayer hallelujah believer come in contact with his maker that's more powerful than anything hallelujah look at this in acts 12 thank you Jesus says now about that time Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church and it killed James the brother of John with the sward and because he saw it pleased to Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison by his his his his purpose for putting him in prison is that I'm gonna kill Peter but see if it ain't time for you to go God don't make a way for you to get out of it watch this watch this right he said he say and now he says and when he had to put a prohibited him he put him in prison and delivered him to fourth quarter nians of soldiers to keep him intending after eat after Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison Oh glory that prayer I love that when I will you see me you see that prayer that means something about the things but prayer the prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him and then when Herod would have brought him forth that same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers and then bound with two chains and the kuipers before the dark kept the prison and in their hole the angel of the Lord came up him hallelujah bypassed the people that he was connected to by chains by our past the people I was watching over the door the angel the Lord is not the sinners but they those troubles if you have to come and pick pocket the chains to get you out he'll do just that oh my god I've seen God protect me at times where that something big went off it in the school but the day that that something big went off in the school God had it where I was late that day God know how to protect you from the stuff can we go on listen it says and the Holy age of the Lord came upon him and a light shine in the prison and they spoke Peter on the side and raise them up saying arise up quickly in his chain spill off from his hands my god and the angel said unto Him gird thyself and bind on that sandals and so he did they said I am cast that garment about thee and follow me and they went out and followed him and whisked not that it was true what was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision when they were passing this is what happened in the book of Acts we ought to expect these same things because the church is a continuation of the book of Acts when they were past the first in the second war that came unto the iron gate that leadeth them to the city which opened to them on his own accord see this is why I always say when you walk into the grocery store somebody's department stores and they got the doors that just open up by themselves oh they got that from Scripture because the angel did that first but he want to open them so he can go shopping he opening this to set his this prisoner free just I don't care I close to this but in the nick of time God has a way of sparing you look at it look at it let's keep going say which open to them on others on court and they went out and passed on through one Street and forth with the angel departed from them I got you out and now you need to go ahead and take care the rest is now look at where Peter go Oh help me somebody God does set you free full of stuff what you doing going back into them situations again look at where Peter call he says and then and when Peter was come to himself well Jesus come and he said now I know of a surety that the Lord had sent his angel and then have to limit me out of the hand of hell and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews and when he had considered a thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was mark where many would gather and plant dominoes where many were gathered and playing uno huh no no no he knew where to go he went where many would gather and they were praying when Peter got free he went to the prayer meeting when you get free where you going hallelujah you know God never spared your life you ought to be the first one in church that on a Friday night I got a testimony brother Jack I have a testimony God been too good to me for me to sit down and I say now are you mama wants you to tell him it's his mom it didn't happen to mama God didn't do that for mama God did it for you we want to hear your testimony let me read a few scriptures to you okay I just want to encourage you a man as you prepare to go back I want to read the scriptures then we'll have a word of Prayer over-over each and every one let's look at this song on proverbs 18 and 10 let's pull that up hallelujah hallelujah proverbs 18 and 10 just want to read this over over you God's Word and man is your protection the Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the right just runneth into it and it's safe anybody know his name I say does anybody know his name his name is Jesus if you don't know his name the name of the Lord the name is Jesus Jesus is a strong tower the righteous run into it and it's safe Psalm 61 and in verse 2 and 3 look at this from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been a shelter from me they may end a strong tower from the enemy now earlier I read a man Isaiah 54 and we read verse 13 but if any of you all know Isaiah 54 we shouldn't just stop at verse 13 really the keep reading can we read and all of our children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the piece of that children somebody say read and righteousness shut I'll be established thou shalt be far from question but thou shalt not fear and from terror for should not come near thee somebody say reading the whole they shall surely gather together but not got me whoever shall gather together and kiss me shall fall for that seat somebody say keep me there all I have created a Smith that both occurs in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for as well but I have created the waste of the district suppose they don't stop there though there is more I give peace shall Tasha blows a kiss p.m. judgment - up until this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord I'm here to tell you I don't care what they come up with I don't care what they got go pump your gas ain't nobody gonna shoot you you go on this cloud you go on the class tell me what not don't get into no situations but you go in the class and get your studies done and you don't fear and momma's and daddies you got to sit on my pray over them before they come every morning set your family altar I don't I mean at our house we we get up in the morning before but we try to do this every morning in memory so I've been letting them off the hook a little bit but a man but but we it's best it's best to do it sometime my daughter be getting up having to be the work five something that was a lot but we get up and we pray we read a scripture and we pray together hallelujah and as you're doing that you're covering your family for the day you just covered them for the day we need God daily don't ever take it for granted Church hallelujah we need it daily but but cover yourself in prayer just look just just some prayer before you before you leave that house that they just cover and just watch what God does for we have to live in a world like this amen I got one more scripture that I want to read for you all I want to read Psalm 91 I want to read Psalm 91 I'm telling you this morning Jesus has already sent the angel for the believers sinners don't get angels but believers do and he's already sent his angel for your protection you don't have a thing to worry about God's got everything under control the Bible says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge not the parking garage not trying to hide behind a tree right he is my refuge and my fortress you see when when armies back in those days when they fought an Old Testament they try to build fortresses but they're trying to protect themselves from any advancing enemy right and they tried to make it strong glory to God but-but-but-but see we gotta understand that God is our fortress he and and say he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with our eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made which is my refuge even the most high high habitation I'm reading this over this church there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling you want to know why for he shall give his angels charge over thee and you know why they there to keep you in all that ways that's it not part of all your way is gonna be kept they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shall tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him because you love God therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me see when you when the name of the Lord is a strong tire so when you call where you called Jesus just that fact Jesus and if this is this as fast this is fast I was i'ma read this a second but I had a quote up here i'ma just give testimony brother branham's was he was driving with his family and they say they were going through the bluffs of Indiana what the bluffs of Indiana it's like heels it's just rollin heels just rolling hills nonsense we live in flat land in Florida if you ever rode through somebody's rolling hills you say man these mountains are big but the people in the answer these ain't mountains EJ's heels and say he's right and and and if you ever driven in mountains or even in heels no guardrails on the side of the road and it's a two-lane highway this thing this I mean it's just too late so you go off they'll come find you they'll be making a phone call to your family and coming to find you right so so brother Brandon was driving through here and and as he's driving through his wife just you know enjoying he I'm telling turns and corners heels and while you're driving he's in a vision and his wife didn't even know he was in a vision it got to a certain point where he it come to a search bar say something white just kind of fell on the cop and his wife say bill and and we she said that he say yes absolutely you've been private underneath this vision all this time got me in his bluff like this say he say what was going on that God has showed him a vision brother Bosworth was in trouble and said he had the pre and they say to see honey I'm sorry we got to stop and pray for brother Bosworth and right now he's in trouble he was over in Africa and he's in trouble we got a preform so they stopped Dupree and a day later at his house come a telegram saying pray for brother Bosworth he needs your prayer right now so he actually they brought the telegraph agency when was this in he said 24 hours she say 24 hours ago he said he say the angel the Lord beat the Telegraph the angel Lord is present even right now so when we call on the name of Jesus he's dead answer look at this verse 14 because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him see when you got God's promise that's better than the security after school I will deliver him and honor him i'ma tasty when they took the Bible out they took prayer out we got guns in but when they had all this already in the school we didn't have these type of problems right say I will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation I'm here to tell you Jesus has already sent his angel before we approach this new school year the angel of goes before us and he's gonna bring us through he brought us through last year gonna bring us through again this year don't fear God's got everything under control the seven word of Prayer afterwards I want to have all of my students on my
