for it i'm still declaring to the devil i believe what god said i believe what god said oh jesus yesterday i was asked to come and pray for someone and i got there they were just going through some things in their body and then their mind and they were telling me that they they could feel when the enemy was attacking them they could just feel it you know it was coming up you know so if you can feel when the devil is actually attacking you then you can speak to that devil [Music] i'll say because the bible tells us that if we resist the devil and that that mean that that don't mean fight with him you understand just resist a little push the bible say he'll flee and and i said you know if you just resist the devil he'll flee you know and um and i say now how have you been resisting the devil and they really didn't have an answer i said okay i'm gonna give you a a a solution of how to resist the devil when he's attacking your body just say this say by his stripes i am healed so just keep saying that over and over again says like the doctor giving you 30 pills for 30 days and you take the same pill every day and watch it produce the result by his stripes i am healed so when you start feeling the devil coming upon you just by his stripes iron hill by his stripes i'm healed by his stripes i'm here saying i'm gonna add a little bit more tell the devil i ain't gonna accept this i'm not accepting this by his stripes i'm healed add a little bit more i'm not accepting this by his stripes i'm healed hallelujah and just a little resistance will actually bring victory in your situation i don't care what you're facing this morning you can resist the devil and he'll flee hallelujah to the lamb of god but i just thank the lord it's been a a blessed amen service thus far and i'm looking forward to all that god has in store for us from today uh god is god is god is moving church god is god is moving in our midst sometimes we don't get a chance to hear all that god is doing and and uh you know a few weeks ago i was invited to join 8 o'clock discussion in the book of revelation [Music] there's some brothers that they get up eight o'clock every morning from the west coast to the east coast and they gather on the telephone and just and they talk about the book of revelation and you know just things like that and i was asked to to join and i said okay let me let me see what this is all about and i said i don't know if i can do this seven days a week this might be a little tough but i'll do what i can as i just begin to um join in and just listen and hear you know the different different ones just sharing uh i said well i'll tell you what this song said let me let me get a little bit more information about this group you know that that i'm asked to maybe even speak in some time they want me to speak so i said well let me just see about this and i call one of the brothers a pastor there that i knew that was involved i said just give me some background on this group please i'm trying to understand some things and they say well there was a brother brother ernie villanueva who came here and preached right before the pandemic struck so brother ernie had been witnessing to a man for for 10 years 10 years he witnessed to him and it just seemed like this man was not going to accept the word he was a pentecostal preacher but just seemed like he would not accept the word he just kept witnessing for 10 years with him and said one day the man finally said you know what i accept it this has got to be the truth you know and uh and he was a pentecostal pastor he took the message and uh and and you know god had blessed him in his business and everything and you know just doing very well but after he accepted the message about a year later he found himself uh kind of mixed up in some uh investment that went wrong right and uh and when it went wrong since he was since his name and his money was tied up in there they caused him to take the fall so here he is in prison you know because of a bad investment but he goes with the message in hand to prison and while he's in prison um you know he has all of his books and things there and he puts them in the library for anybody that might want to get a hold of a book they can get it and read it and and all of that so there was a a situation come up in the jail that somebody got killed a fight broke out and somebody got killed so they put the entire jail on lockdown and uh so this other gentleman said you know what we're going on lockdown that means three days we can't come out these cells he said i gotta go to the library and get myself a book uh to read while i'm in this lockdown so when he went to the library he went and got himself the church age book i'm talking about in jail [Music] and for three days he read the church book church age book all the way through he said he said oh my goodness so after after the lockdown he said who brought this book to the library and he went and met this brother that brother ernie had been witnessing to for 10 years so they began to go through the church ace book and just have little studies there in jail and uh evangelist this man that was on lockdown that got the church but he actually got transferred out of that particular jail took a church his book with him met somebody else in the next jail that he was in and uh and start talking with that person about the church ages and uh so both of them end up getting out of jail so they started this little group where they get together on the phone every morning and just go through the book of revelations they just read a chapter share what they what they get out of it and then they turn it over to a couple brothers uh they ask brother tim calhoun and brother jason watkins just to share their thoughts on different things out of the church ages so brother tim said we're looking for a third brother to join us brother jack i see we'll see you know but uh but the lord just so had it yesterday morning uh none of the other brothers could do it so i jumped in and just you know gave him a lesson you know on the church ages and and the same thing that we've been doing here i time you know luther and wesley and amen pentecost back over to the life of samson you know and and as i was just looking at it it just kind of moved me because uh there's some different quotes there where brother branham said uh uh the the false church got their revival first it says this in in the uh in the seals see the first false church got their revival first and when you really studied amen uh revelation chapter two that was the seeds of the false church that was that was going there and it came to full maturity in the dark ages volunteering praise the lord say but but he says uh they got their their their first three ages you know ephesus and and and smyrna and pergamos that was the false church coming to full maturity inside here say but then in sardis things was about to change the true church was about to get its revival hallelujah and that's where we are now we are and we are in revival whether you feel it or not we are still in revival because we are revived by the word of god amen the truth of the word of god hallelujah so you know we just i said and when you look at scripture the revival to the true church actually happened in revelation 3. so the false church in revelation 2 but the true church revelation 3 hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we had a little fellowship amen around these things yesterday morning and and this morning i come here to prayer and i get up from prayer and i got to text me brother jack would you share this morning i said my god i had time to get nothing so i but by god's grace amen somebody else stepped up and uh and took it but y'all just pray for me my the primary reason they got me involved in this is because there was a brother that is in fort lauderdale that's been a part of this group for a number of months and uh they want him to know that there's a church that he can come fellowship at amen so i said well yes i will certainly be a part of this and we'll do what we can just to win some souls you know just to get people in fellowship so the lord is good he's moving all the time amen he's moving all the time uh i think i got a prayer request here that i want to just make mention of brother garen sent this to me um this morning he's asking prayer for his mother um she's been dealing with a situation uh that they say the doctors are really they don't know what it is they say they contributed to stress and water pills um and uh and something uh something that's starting to get into her eyes it's like blood that's getting into her eyes and uh so they he just asked for prayer for his mom he sent me a picture and everything and and she certainly just needs our prayers that god would just touch her in her body amen and we want to we want to offer prayer for for her so just bow your heads with me father we come in the precious name of the lord jesus on behalf of brother garren's mom and lord this blood condition whatever it is that the doctors really can't figure out they're saying stress and we all have stress we we have that whether it's positive or negative but lord water pills they're not sure what it is but father you know what it is it's a devil that is attacking her and father we come as the sons and daughters of god making our request known that you would bring healing to her body that lord she would see a miracle on her behalf and god through this miracle may uh her heart be drawn closer to you father may she realize that it's not man that did it but it's god almighty that did it so in between her condition and she as a patient we place the blood of jesus christ for you were wounded for her transgressions you would bruise for her iniquities the chastisement of her peace is upon you and with your stripes we are declaring healing we send the word of healing to her right now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen praise the lord um a couple announcements that we will just make mention of to you on today uh we've got birthday praise the lord

save wretched like us to take us from brokenness lord on to being masterpieces in the kingdom of heaven father taking us from the wrong breath onto the new breath to make us peales in the kingdom of heaven lord jesus christ [Music] father we didn't have to choose ourselves but we were part of you before the foundation of the world and so your love compelled you lord jesus christ to come down from the corridors of heaven to die the death on calvary to save wretched beings like us but father we are no longer wretched we are sons and daughters of god positioned in the kingdom of heaven father that's why we are here this morning gathered for the kingdom of heaven conference with you that you'll give us your mind the man of christ for us today father many people have got different requests upon their heart different reasons for being here lord jesus christ different petitions for themselves and loved ones lord there are many that are sick across the earth due to different conditions lord father you are the great hillary rapha you are the same yesterday today and forevermore set the captive free heal their sick lord jesus christ and use it as an ensign to bring them to the kingdom of god for those who have not known you in the way that they should know you you are the one lord jesus christ that you save and you give peace in perfection and you give rewards unto your people and one of the rewards for your sons and others is healing is prosperity blessing redemption and fullness of joy father where there's no joy give joy where there's no peace in the family give them peace in their family where they need unity to give them unity of heart and mind and soul where they don't know where they come from where somebody doesn't know their purpose in earth and they don't know where they live when they are going lord jesus christ greedy turner descend further into their own life situation and reveal yourself in your own special way o thou father above the one who lives in our heart take control over the four corners of this building father every spirit that is not of you we send the word the consuming fire to consume it lord jesus christ liberate each and every one of us lord our hearts that our hearts will become a fountain of living waters father those of our brothers and sisters streaming on the internet father give them the same portion of word and blessing lord jesus christ do something for them that they know that you are with them lord jesus regardless of geographical grounds that they are bless them lord jesus christ reveal yourself more and more lord jesus father fix every problem in their lives be the solution of every issue lord jesus we've got an entitled to every situation father we bless you this morning we thank you for the atmosphere the songs the testimony the open doors recommend each and every heart into your hands take preeminence lord jesus that is your attribute to take prominence in the body of christ the kingdom of god being established and the garden of eden restored into the heart of your people lord jesus and we can say this day this word is fulfilling our heart for the word the zoyo of christ is restored back into our hearts lord by your name in the name of the lord jesus christ we wage war over the enemy claiming our loved ones our families father we bring them in as joshua and the two spies brought rahab from jericho to help kenya to be part of the kingdom of heaven to become part of jerusalem father jerusalem the city of peace lord if there is no one who don't have peace father we speak peace into their hearts in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you amen glory to the lord amen amen the lord is good amen whenever we come before the lord wherever we are it's not only this in this in the in the house in your room your play school the lord has something for you god bless you musicians for what you do for us they are our seraphims they bring the inspiration and the joy and the atmosphere that the caribbean the word can come forth amen and i think but a jack preacher some time ago that one of the prophet went to a situation and he asked them to sing a song because their song created an atmosphere even the song itself cast away demons so when you are sick even the song alone when you move into the spirit of the song it brings healing and it brings redemption onto your heart amen the loss may be glorified as we are reading less we want to continue round up the three series that i had for a transformation from brokenness into masterpiece we want to run it off today and so today will be the third part transformed from brokenness into masterpiece amen we want to read a kind of a scripture that we don't read more often matthew chapter one let's probably do one two five to say the background matthew chapter 1 verse 1 to 5 to give a background of how jesus christ came to earth coming from brokenness taking lives of brokenness and he came through it those lives to be the redeemer amen so matthew chapter one verse one to five or let's say six will be enough the book of generation of jesus christ the son of david and i want you to take note the son of david of course we know that jesus wasn't born by flesh of man jesus was the spoken word son of god he was god himself who battled himself in the womb of mary it wasn't the blood of mary it wasn't the genetics of mary or joseph but it was god's own genetic the genetics of elohim but he borrowed the womb of mary because he wanted to be a human being he has to come through a man sorry he has to come through a womb to be a redemption he has to come through the blast system he has to come through a tribe a family so we want to trace the genealogy of jesus christ where he came from so matthew 1 and verse 1 go in the book of generation of jesus christ the son of david son of abraham abraham begat isaac and isaac because begot jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren verse three and judas begat faris and zara of tamar and faris begat esram sram begat iran iran begat amin adap aminada begat nassen nassim begat someone and someone begat both or boys of richard richard or is the same as rehab of jericho and boaz or both begat obed of ruth and albert begat jesse and jesse because david the king and david begat salomon of her that had been the wife of urias and on and on and on you can go through and trace how the lord jesus christ the sun the root and the offspring of david we may take our seat god bless you glory to god jesus christ was the root and the offspring of david amen praise be to god so jesus christ when he came through this earth he didn't come through the tribe of the pursuit we know the priesthood tribe that is the tribe of levy or levi moses came through that tribe then when jesus was coming he swept that tribe and came to the tribe of judah and we know jew that we can talk about one brokenness of judah judah was a man her daughter his daughter-in-law was sama and in the old testament when a son or a man maurice and doesn't give birth to children and the husband dies the brother of the person has to marry the woman and bring forth children to kind of keep the family line going however there wasn't any adult to give it to this uh tamar so there was a young man coming up so he was supposed to grow and get married to tamar however when he grew up they didn't give it to her but there's a lot of uh a lot of uh procreation the law of uh redemption or redemption the law of keeping the family line so there was something in tamar so he decided to do something and sometimes the things that are that seems way off the lord uses those things to bring his word to pass so tamar dressed up as a prostitute in a note on the olden days in the bible this holding bible days the addresses were different the women like the muslims they cover almost all their face they put on ropes they have the inner garment outer garment and so forth and so on so tamar was on this on on the road like a prostitute and judah went to take care of his ship coming with his staff and rod and so forth and he saw this prostitute in the old interest in the old testament they could have wives and have concubines that is the old testament but not a new testament so uh judah talked to this prostitute and he said what will you give me say well i don't have anything here but i can give you my stuff and my inside and son is like maybe wallet right so i'll give it to you and i'll send somebody to bring you sheep and goats and whatever so he did what he did and then he went his way it wasn't long they realized that hey they came to uh judah say hey your daughter-in-law is pregnant say really she's pregnant she got to be killed because she didn't wait for the for the young man now they put the blame on her all right and so they want to find out who got her pregnant well they don't know okay let's go find out so they went to find out hey who got you pregnant so well i don't know who got me pregnant but the man who got me pregnant pregnant gave me his staff and his wallet and his name id callum used it like an id card so this is the man's id card or social security number his name is this so they went back to jude i said judah she doesn't even know the man who got her pregnant but she has got some something instrument uh staff and id card right so this is the id card and the name of the id card was judas saying really so judas looked at and said look she's more righteous than i am she did this to preserve life amen she didn't do it for the doing sick but she did it to preserve life and so now through that tribe that is where the lord jesus christ came through therma as we read here we look at a woman called a rehab you're going to center mostly on rehab but ruth we know her life she came from a country of idol worshiping she wasn't part of the kingdom of heaven but before the foundation of the world her name was in the lamb's book of life so she has to come through the same lineage of jesus christ or jehovah in that time but hers was through marriage and we know the the story of ruth now on rehab she's the one we're going to center on she was a prostitute in jericho and uh this woman came through we want to there's so many uh so many things that we can look at the story of rehab five thousand or four thousand years ago and we see ourselves in rehab amen because rehab is our mother amen our gospel mother rehab was a prostitute but then she heard a story of men two spies who are spying the land and being a prostitute they went to a house to kind of keep those men you know if you want to find out about issues entire go to those prostitutes they know everything in town because they know all the men they know the politicians they are their customers they know that senators the governors the mayors and even the ministers and so on and so forth so if you want to find information about selling place go to the prostitute because they will tell you the people that come to them and the things that they talk they tell they tell them so they can give you all the info all the secrets that even their wives don't know this prostitute hold those information praise be to god so they went to the prostitute house to say hey you know we are here for a business but you know if you want to keep our business sacred uh uh secret we will take care of you we will keep you alive so they realize that these men are not just ordinary man they are not just coming for business her business but they want to find out things about the town because the almighty has sent them to take over the town amen and this morning we are not talking about towns like taking over boca raton or taking over miami or taking over uh west palm beach but we've got an earth a town a city people human beings insisting element your loved ones and my loved ones sons and daughters of god that we need to go back and take it from the king of jericho amen those are the towns and cities we are talking about so for in four thousand years ago five thousand years ago it was a typica uh physical town physical city but now that is a type the city is human beings amen so rehab kept their business uh secret they got all the information that they they wanted and the bible said that the people of jericho feared one translation said their hardware melting for the fear of the people because they could see that it's not human beings it is jehovah himself in human flesh working upon the land of jericho he's coming to take back his inheritance amen as a brother jack preached was it last week the more you know the less you fear the more you know that this is for you you go with boldness and claim it for yourself because this is your inheritance it's your position and you've got that celestial dimensions behind you all heaven is behind you to claim your inheritance so you go with boldness and ask him hey this is my pen give it to me brother joseph i'm just kidding it's not my thing so if something is for you that's how you go with you just claim it you don't go trembling you go with what with strength with courage and claim it you don't go begging for it but you go receiving it claim it from from the thief amen so whatever the enemy has stolen from you whatever the devil conditions of life has stolen from you jesus christ is here to restore to you amen blessed be the name of the lord so rehab let's read joshua to to to give some background joshua chapter one the verse joshua chapter one rather chapter two joshua chapter two let's read from one going and joshua the son of nan sent out sent out to him two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an hallowed house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came man in heather tonight of the children of israel to search out the land and the king of jericho sent out rehab saying bring them bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into that house for they be come to search out our country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said there came men unto me but i was not once they were and it came to pass about the time of shouting of the gates let me skip two verse verse 10 for we have heard verse 10 says for we have heard how the lord dried up the waters the water of the red sea for you when you came out to egypt and when you did unto the king of kings of amorites that way on the other side of jordan sinha and og whom he utterly destroyed as soon as we heard of these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god of heaven above and in earth below amen if you have this god what do you have to fear tell me if you have this person in your life what do you have to fear what do you have to worry about what do you have to dread because the lord fights your battle for you amen is just using your instrumentalities it's using your your your body to surrender your body or spread your soul to him so that he can take care of things you need to take care of amen so now jericho was the name rehab we have a little background of her that she was a woman of jericho and she was a prostitute her life was full of brokenness there was nothing good to write home about but there was a seed of presentation in rehab amen and the lord looked at the seed in a person the lord doesn't look at your physical body how beautiful or how ugly you are that is not what the lord is looking up to he's looking out to your heart amen that you have a little bit of love for him regardless of your brokenness do you love him do you want to connect to him do you want to surrender your life to him that is what the lord is looking up to amen when a man is going to marry a woman the man is looking at number one love amen the man is not if he's a true man who wants a true wife he's not looking up to beauty first if you look up to beauty without love it's gonna be a failure amen however if you look up to love first that you know that this woman for sure loves you and you love her then it's going to be a good marriage so the lord is a type the natural type of spiritual when the lord is proposing to you he's looking after you do you love him not how broken you are not how rich you are but do you love him will you surrender your life to him that the lord jesus christ will be your husband to come and live in you to rule you to order your footsteps or you want to live your own life you want to be a isaiah 4 verse 4. isaiah 4 4 said there were seven women who wanted a man but they wanted to have their own name and wear their own apparel they don't want to be called this is jesus christ they just want to be a church member they want to belong to a society they want to belong to a group but they don't want the lord to be their husband they just want to have a name to be just we call a christian but the life the nature the deity of jesus christ the abort and dislike in their lives i don't i don't i don't think we want to be that kind of church but we want a church we want to be the call that one uh revelation 18 4 if i'm right that kami among them from among them my people and be not be the participants of jericho for their sins of what mounted high and i the lord has come down with a consuming fire to consume them amen if you think the world is so glorious and you're gonna enjoy this for thousands of years in the cosmos form look at coronavirus does it say that if you don't know death go to the cemetery look at the grave but if you think this word is so glorious in itself in a cosmos form then look at coronavirus shot countries big people with big name putin trump trump whoever queen of england everybody's hiding out all the kings and the queens and all the big people all the big names billionaires and puppets are like poor and they're rich everyone is running for their life because there's a spirit of death on the land on earth so where is the place of refuge there's only one place of refuge that is in jesus christ amen so he said come out from among them and be not be partakers of the cosmos evil but rather come to the uh to the lugas come to the word life come to eternity come and be identify yourself who you you were before the foundation of the world and that is what rehab did rehab put her faith into action the name the meaning of rehab means white and broad a land wide land and broadland now rehab didn't have any good implanted on the land she planted prostitution and adultery and spread that is not of the lord but one day she received visitors she received the lord himself in the form of the two spies and she had a choice to make to stay in the old church to be a part of the king of er what's the name the kingdom of king of jericho that kingdom doesn't hold water that kingdom was about to break down that kingdom has been melted when chronovirus came their sister gave her testimony she belonged to a church and she was expecting things to happen in the church this is a time that church has to put their faith in action but everybody is running away and he said where's the faith i thought this church is going to do something the church everybody's ever the pastor they don't find him because he's running for his life he doesn't want to show up he cares for his life he doesn't want to die and the sister was disappointed he said i thought it's a church where it is a time that we have to rise up and pray and you know the lord coming down no they had a name but they didn't have the word the life amen you may have a name christian you may have a name tabernacle but if the life of christ is not in you it's just a name amen blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ so rahab had to make a decision that her earth that is her body has to be redirected to a new man jehovah they have to be a new crop being planted on that land and the lord was so messy for if you want to read uh we don't have the time but you can read uh joshua chapter two he's going to tell you about his her story how she was rescued but i want to take some few highlights you want to take james chapter 2 verse 25 james 2 25 about this woman that was a prostitute and how the lord liberated her and put her in the family of christ james 225 likewise also was not rehabbed the harlot justified by wax when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way so her works that is when he put her faith into action her works her feet produce uh rewards it produced an action which brought rewards onto her that is redemption of her and a household the same thing the greater faith is in you amen if your faith could redeem it from being consumed by the destruction of jericho then your faith in jesus christ can redeem you and your loved one from all the cases of the world amen you want to read hebrews chapter 11 30 and 31 hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 30 and 31 he said by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compass about seven days right 31 by faith the harlot rehab perished not with them that believe not when she had received their spies with peace amen when she received them with peace now rahab went after she was redeemed she was adopted into the family of jehovah into the tribe of israel she became part of gas economy now she married to a man called salmon and someone the name remember the name the meaning of rehab means el vas land an empty land that nothing had been planted on now salomon means peaceable perfection and he that rewards amen peaceable perfection and he that rewards amen now rehab didn't have peace to begin with that wasn't the life of peace men coming after the other there was noop it doesn't matter how much you get it was a lot of life of destruction and brokenness but then when she received the word from the from the spice of uh spice of joshua now she had what she had peace and when she had peace she became perfect and through that perfection she received rewards of being redeemed and her loved ones being redeemed not only redemption but the lord gave a husband called salmon salmon is a type of christ a man and when she married to someone she brought about a son uh i think that was a boss now boaz means the lord of the harvest amen who is also a type of christ and was married to another broken woman rehab by redemption the whole life is about redemption and she redeemed ruth into the family of christ and out of ruth came forth who jesse obered first right obed then from obed jesse from jesse david from david jesus christ amen so regardless of how broken you are jesus christ can come through your bowels amen regardless of how unworthy you are jesus christ if you surrender your life to jesus christ you can take your brokenness and bring masterpieces out of your life amen because he's looking at the seed he planted in you when you plant a crop the crops sometimes will rot fast certain crops it has to die it has to rot and then the life in it everything everything has to roll the seed completely then there's a life the life is a six-dimensional life and it's the spoken word of god when the lord created the earth he spoke let the earth bring forth what fruits trees yielding fruits flowers and so forth not only the physical earth but you are fruit of the earth if you read some uh one he said blessed is the man uh who put not the trust in in wickedness and do wickedness but a man who what who put his trust in the lord he shall be like a tree planted by the waters of rivers of water he will yield his fruits in its season so when you give your life to christ regardless of what you go through yes you have to go through rottiness and being dead and then by the way that's a seed the life the six dimensional life the mind of christ will come out of you by the holy ghost baptism amen two weeks ago i think not this last saturday but previous saturday i was invited to speak to the youth in mexico and some part of south america in a virtual preaching so we did it by brother josue's house and the lord laid on my heart finding your purpose in earth not your purpose on earth we have so many purposes on earth on earth your job yes whatever you do school raising children family but you've got one purpose in earth in your earth in your sistine element and that purpose is what the mind of jesus christ for you and what is the man of jesus christ the holy ghost baptism the new breath the being born again being receiving christ into your heart so that christ will restore the garden of eden in your life not some kind of eating in in egypt or in uh somewhere in israel by the garden of eden in your earth because your body is 16 element the the lord one person is more valuable than all the earth or the planet because this is an earth that can move that can talk that has got a soul the natural earth yes the lord rules over the natural earth but it's not as important to the lord as your earth amen because in your earth he can establish his kingdom on it the natural earth is doing what he's supposed to do he's bringing forth fruit rivers and what a view but are you and me are we bringing forth the fruits are we bringing manifesting the purpose of god or not on in earth so the lord has a purpose for you in your earth and when you receive just like rahab when you receive the word christ into your earth then you can bring forth peace perfection and all the rewards in christ amen jesus told his disciples seek he first the kingdom of god and his righteousness the kingdom of god is a person that's what i said his righteousness so seek he the person of jesus christ into your heart and the holiness that goes with it everything else will be added on to you amen prosperity whatever job business marriage children grandchildren whatever you desire as long as you have a desire the lord has already given it to you glory be to the lord amen so whatever you desire in christ is there for you so you have to allow the lord to plant his seed upon your earth many probably haven't allowed the lord to plant the the seed of the of the word of god upon their earth and the lord has got opportunity for you today because today when you hear the word don't reject the word of god let the word be conceived like mary in your heart to bring for the lord jesus christ because today might be your last day amen why do you want to go back to where the lord redeem you from when the lord has spent economy look at let me look at it in a business form look at businessmen when businessmen invest money what do they expect they expect money and profit back they call it roi return on investment when they plant let's say one million in a business whatever i t business construction business uh transportation business they expect they already put down certain things they just don't throw their money one billion in a business just for the sake of having business but they put out certain calculations okay i'm putting this money into this business i'm going to do this invest in people this amount to go into human resources this will go into material resources this will go into i.t this will go into this this will go into uh insurance and protection of the business and after maybe 10 years or five years maybe they have a short term and a long time in a year or two i have to break even in other words i'm not making profit but i'm not losing but in the third year i need to begin to retrieve my money back we're going to get more money get more profit and reinvest now the lord invests in us amen the lord is the greatest businessman more than other businessman more than the guilt and trump and so forth the lord brought your life on earth right begin to feed you with breast milk has had your mother spend sleep sleep last night watching over you when you are sick your mother doesn't sleep maybe your dad can sleep maybe go to work can't sleep and snore but mama doesn't sleep mama will spend sleepless night watching over you so that everything will be well with you when you've got headache and fever and so forth and begin to give you food uh cereals just name it whatever food you were eating in the in when you were a child all the formulas right all the lactogen and water view cereals you begin to eat them then you begin to get of age when you begin to start chewing right chewing fish fries uh tamales and whatever just burger king and whatever whatever but i will say give me some of them broccoli there you go broccoli plant food yes amanda there you go so we get to eat all this good food it's all this food where did he come from it came from the lord your daddy mom had to work now the lord planted you in a church in the house of the lord as a businessman to bring forth fruits so that a certain age you are in an age of that you don't know good and bad so we call it the age of you are not giving a you are not accountable for whatever happened to you when you are maybe three years god doesn't hold you for any sin because two-year-old when you you're maybe three years four years some people get to age of accountability but based on individual some could be seven eight ten some probably excuse me to say maybe some children might be and they have to grow a little longer to be accountable yeah because of maybe sickness so it's different for each and every one now when you get to age of accountability maybe 12 teenager let's say 15. now god can put you to work you can take the excuse me let me use this time marine for example you can use the tambourine glorify the name of the lord amen you can sweep the house of the lord you can pray your prayers have taught you how to pray now that's what the lord is yielding his investment is breakeven the day he gives you the uh you get to age of accountability there's a break even time so now god is going to swap you to the other side where you'll be accountable maybe from the age of like i'm just making an assumption let's say from the age of zero up to 15 you are not accountable i'm just making an assumption but now 15 you are fully accountable or even 12. you are accountable you know what is good and bad you know it's good for you to save the lord you know it's good for you not to smoke you know it's wrong for you to go after men and women who are not your husbands and your wives you know it's not good for you to have to go and form a gang and wrap people and shoot people in their homes you know it's not good for you to gossip to smoke to drink to go to parties there's a lot in you on your conscience that tells you but when you get to that break-even age that's when there's something on the other side telling you don't you see you i mean you're kind of old-fashioned why do you follow your parents to church why do you go listen to brother jack tell you pray to you i mean he's old-fashioned you know he's not a young man he's in the 40s 50s you know come on get some life you know go get some fun look at the young people look at the girls in jess and clubbing you know you can go to club you can have your own boyfriend you know go shin digging and have fun have life and so that voice begins to preach to you and begin to say okay i don't have to listen to brad jack i don't have to listen to brad troy i mean i don't have to do this real quick i don't have to listen to my my my parents you know they are kind of old-fashioned they don't know what's going on in town i need to start going to club i need to have a boyfriend who picked me up and then take me to the restaurant that i want and then take me to i mean go for go to places you know do things you know i mean i don't have to listen to my my boyfriend can buy me cell phone you know i don't have to i can give my dad a cell phone that you can take yourself and i don't need it you can't control my life with your cell phone i can buy my own cell phone i can't even get my own job you know i'm moving out with my boyfriend and then you begin to take that decision now the kingdom of god is in deficit [Applause] the lord is losing money he's losing anointing the anointing that he put on you now you are licking it to the world [Music] amen [Applause] the lord is losing there's nobody to play the tambourine what god has put in you to do yes maybe this brother can play the tambourine but not like the way you do it this person can sing but not the way you do it this person can work on the i.t but not the way you do it this person can testify to people but not the way you do it this sister can live their life but not the way you do it so god does make you so uniquely unique that what you do the next sister the next brother cannot do the same amen so when does somebody leave they need an i.t i know brad jack has it and you go and tell kwaku cannot do the i.t brad jack has to be there to do the iit work i can use the instrument but i don't know how to do it if there's somebody to fix their face their itis at their back their sisters can do it maybe brother brother steven cannot do it yeah he's not an i.t he's just like me right so the lord has put something in you but uh starting for you to do something that the other person cannot do it so when you don't show up when you are not there in the kingdom the kingdom is in deficit it's beyond zero amen the lord has lost losing money [Applause] the lord is losing money and you go into the negatives and the devil begin to bluff you see he call him your son you call this person your daughter look i have him i have him on my side he's clubbing he's dancing he's doing things that i want him to do and we put the kingdom of god into shame but the lord is not mocked amen whatever a man shows he reaps i want to i want to be on i'm i'm preaching on a uh i'm going to use rehab as our center but i want to give a certain a and tell you i said something that happened that if the lord graces you to be planted in a family of christians parents that have got the holy ghost baptism that is one of your greatest blessing if the lord plant you in your church that you're blessed to have a pastor that preached that word of god to you is one of the greatest blessing it's a greater blessing you ever have but if you push yourself away from the lord and go to the other side you receive cases and i'll tell you a story of a man this young man was a christian from the pentecostal background and he had about the message this is in ghana and he moved to the message and i knew he was not somebody who was trained to me we prayed together he brought his family when i started the church into the church he loved the message with his wife i don't know something that voice began to speak to him he didn't like the message no more okay he went back to the old church which was good and his wife was still there he stopped his wife from coming to the church and he even stopped his wife from going to pentecost church it wasn't too long he left the peninsula church he started selling alcohol a christian selling alcohol making money he didn't need that money but he just whatever happened to him that he didn't end up there he wanted power so begin to look for idols went to togo where they could get idols they can give you idol for whatever i do for money i don't for like i know haitians i've got a voodoo when you go to certain places they have idols you can buy an idol if you want a woman you can have an idol that will give you for girls if you want a certain girl or a man what do you call it a uh i forgotten that's a term for it somebody who has got money that's a term i don't remember but if you want somebody a rich person uh but go digger right if you want a gold digger if maybe this person has god is loaded with money and you can go and get an idol to kind of bring wash him so that he can give you his money so this young man went for idols for whatever and they begin to go way off and off and off i remember i went to visit him one time he didn't have time he was selling his alcohol he asked customers around he just came came and said hello and one brother he was addicted he was very closest to this young man and he was speaking to him advising him even the brother's wife was telling this brother to advise his the husband but shouldn't pay heed after a year a couple years now there's a time for sowing and a time for reaping the lord jesus christ is no mock the lord is so real amen if you think this is real you can see the pulpit that oh yes this is real this building is real i can see but the soul is a human being the lord jesus christ is more real than earthly things that you see so the time came when the demons the tormenting demons jump on him this one was running around cemeteries claiming policeman is arresting him there was no policeman people he said what's going on is screaming yelling there's a police after me there was no police around he couldn't sleep in his own house he was going to bush running in bush demons because what he separated himself from the lord the brother told me sir one day his wife came to me and said my husband is just running around he's screaming demons straight from the underworld from the fifth dimension terrible demons possess him you'll be screaming police is arresting me there's no police running arrest you don't see no police but the demons he said brother he died in my arms i went to see him one day and he was screaming he was d suffering is not a word there's not a way to describe what he was going through i grabbed him tried to pray for him he said i'm suffering i'm an attack demon policeman is arresting me i'm being arrested they are tormenting me like you have no no rest no peace in his soul and he said he died i tried to pray for him he died when you mess with the lord jesus christ you're messing with your own life if you think the life that is in you is your own life like we saw this my own life it's my life you're gonna find out if it's your life somebody put that life in that flesh for a purpose and if you won't sell that purpose the day of reckoning will come it will catch up with you and it will be horrible amen let me give another example just to let us know that we don't mock jesus christ and when the lord bless you to put you in a church where you hear the word of the lord take it as an advantage take it as a blessing and do receive it with all your heart i do a missionary in mexico and there was a young lady his grandfather is a pastor you know mexico they don't have that money that we have here so some of them have the church is part of the house converted to a church so the house is here and part of them is kind of you know transforming to a church and this poor old man is very godly man but her granddaughter will not step foot in the church sunday she will run around with men she's pretty beautiful young lady and she gave a heart to men i go there to preach i see her she doesn't come to church the church is just in the house she wouldn't i mean step foot in the church room though she'll be running around with boys it wasn't long one time they called me said brother she's dying and i went she was on the bed with the parents took me to the bedroom if i don't know if you have encountered death before you've come face to face to death demons tormenting demons she wasn't sick of maybe hypertension diabetes no she wasn't sick of blood that kind of sickness but demons demon of death tormenting demons were taking her life sapping the life out of her fear and you could see spirit of death written in her face she couldn't talk or where are the boys they were not they were not there to be found but thank god for the godly parents and the grandfather sometimes when you ascend maybe somebody's praying for you your pastor your parents your uncles your brothers grandparents they are standing the god for you and the lord will give you so much time there could be a barrier when you cross it might be the last time that you hear this good news like the young man he had the pentecostal church he had a message church but he went for idols and he died screaming policemen were chasing him he left his wife and his children behind if you don't serve the lord you won't do god's purpose god will take you from the earth he hosts your life and my life amen never say that my life it's me i can do what i want you gonna find out if you created yourself if you give birth to yourself you will find out pretty soon in the right time and if the lord has blessed you with where you hear the gospel coming for the intruder in life what does you want why do you want to separate yourself from jesus christ why don't you why do you want tormenting demons they torment people people cannot sleep demons every person that you sleep with who is not your husband or your wife you plant a spirit in you you plant a demon in you because human beings have got spirits spirits don't live in a walls no you don't see if they're spreading this water that's not going to have an action jesus christ was not living in trees no satan doesn't live in trees if you live in tree he cannot function his stagger is not a tree he's tagged his own human being working on earth remember what's the name um the man that got mad into the cemetery she was cut himself with stone legion yeah legion had maybe he was in church but legion began to do otherwise left his wife and children maybe money maybe something and he became a prodigal son and legion was now living in the cemetery and demons in him who in his normal sense would take a stone and cut himself he's tormenting demons but he was lucky jesus christ remembered him and he went there to save his life and brought legion from his condition if we're living in a legion condition remember the prodigal son progress and go to certain age when he has to be profitable to the kingdom he said no i've worked in this kind of my dad you're rich i need to i need to get my portion took his portion went to the street right travel somewhere went with women when you have money you can get million girls to follow you when you think you are pretty you can get million men to follow you but there's a time will come that when you are in trouble you look around nobody will be found maybe you can cover the jack he's the one who come and pray for you you can cover the solomon you can call your parents you can call some brother some sister and they'll be there for you because why christ is in them is jesus christ on earth in the same ministry amen why do you want to separate yourself from people that will be a blessing to you so this young man took his money went to the cities went with women flirting with women and sooner than later all their money was quenched now she was zeroed the women were nowhere to be found all their friends were nowhere to be found and he was eating with pigs now not only physically eating with pigs pig is a type p in the bible pig is one of the animals they are the worst you can talk about you know pig you know photius so he was living in filthiness demons he found himself this is not where i am this is sunday i should be in church here i am i work and they don't even pay me they don't even recognize me as a human being i'm sleeping with pigs why where did i get to the how and there's something in him a seed a voice of the father calling out to him son where are thou daughter where are thou and she came he came to himself he said you know what i've messed up but i'll go to my father for adventure he'll forgive me and i can be one of his libraries and he went but the father is full of love amen we have a father above who is full of love who take your broken your broken pieces and create brand new things out of it so the father received him with love he didn't make him a libra he adopted him as a son once he was sent out forever his son and the father brought him back home put jewels on his neck killed fat cows for him and they had a party bring him back home because his son has now learned his experience so he's come back home now he's not going to go back to the world anymore amen if the lord jesus christ has privileged you to be born in a family where they read bible in a family where you hear the voice of god you hear the voice of a prophet are you not blessed why would you forsake that prophet and go to do something else i met her sister and she said she was coming from the french line he said when i was growing up my dad was a message pastor my uncle was a pastor whatever you do he said my dad would say he said fred ramadi he said whatever you do you wear escape that is short my dad who said abraham said if you try to do something abraham said and my life was always by ramsay and i said sister you should be thankful to your dad and your uncle and your aunties for always saying that bubram said all right elijah said jeremiah said but the jack said but a troy said but a jerry said why not happy that to have a parent a family where they chop off the excess king the cut off things that are evil out of your life that says the lord is the lord speaking to you i said had not been your dad your mom and your aunties and uncle sin fred brahmadi maybe you might have heard about three children without without a husband amen the lord will forgive you all your sins but certain things is going to be with you and that's why the lord has given you grace that stay under the grace stay under the canopy of god don't go beyond those barriers stay right here the lord will bless you stay with your pastor stay with your parents stay with godly men and women that the lord has put in your life to guide you amen onto eternal life onto blessing and prosperity don't go away that i'm going to teach the world it will destroy you tormenting demons will take over your soul they will kill your life what else you want you don't want the atmosphere when there's something in you lives for joy remember when the coroner started and they had to we have to all uh be in our own little corner by the law it wasn't the same no matter how you fellowship in your house or your family fellowship you feel like you're missing your brothers you want to hear but you're speaking you want to see your brother you want to there's something about being here sometimes i've been together that you all come together as a family because why christ is in him crisis in him crisis in you crisis that's connecting together so the little pill of fire in you when you bring it together it's like a fire it's a bonfire that everybody gets a warm and heat amen but when you insulate yourself then the devil begin to put noise into your ears we're going to sidetrack you you're going to sidetrack you'll put you here and there and destroy your life i think brother billy paul gave a testimony of his life to young people he said i don't want to in belgium or somewhere and he said when he was going with his father he didn't have an experience he was a young boy his mother died when he was young and his father was his father and his mother but abraham took him travel all over the world to preach and the lord called him to be part of his father's ministry there was a time that the angel of the lord came to visit his father to give him a message and after the angel speaking to about abraham they were bram was a he chose that life for his ministry he chose to be a poor man the lord blessed him later with with money he wasn't pro-begging for bread but he chose to be the way he was for the ministry the lord gave it to him somebody gave him a gift of a thousand dollars sorry one million dollars he said that one five he said this will kill me i can't take it i'm not like the lord has blessed but i believe uh billy graham and ura robert they have university the employee people that they have to pay for me 300 is not for me i ran my little office mind the people that i deal with is people with cancer with tumors so if you buy me a private jet and i'm way up here when i come here i cannot connect to the people so for me the lord has chosen me to be who i am so that i can reach people with cancer women who have got breast cancer they are the one i have to connect with so i have to be like them and he said if i have my own ways that i don't see this to be humble i would rather prefer to walk on my feet but of course i can't walk from uh in indiana to arizona he can't walk from america to south africa to preach he has to go on jet flight so he chose that life so one day the angel of the lord came to visit him and said he asked the angel can my son he was with his brother they were in the same line of the same bed one bed they didn't have the fanciful bathroom they had the bathroom where you have to go and take shower i think he said what do you call it come help me i can't hear yes just like separate old-fashioned bathroom where they have a shower go and shower so braham said that can i can my son and my brother see you said no your your brother cannot see but your son can see me because he was i called him to work with you so he put a pillow on by the billipe's face and said billy you remember the angel of the lord that i talked to you about say yes he said would you like to see him say yes he said it's not going to harm you don't be afraid i'm going to i'm going to take the pillar off and inside the corner you see him the engine stand at the corner and then the angel was standing at the corner somewhere like this and billy paul looked at him and you could see the glory he was a person he was a human being right with her he was about 250 pounds or somewhere and he was barefooted wear a white garment and he was watching him and you could see the glory of the lord watching you could see the dimension the celestial dimension watching him and the kindness he said he could speak and the whole earth could even evacuate it could be scooped but the love of christ was in this angel watching billy paul and he said you could see that music after he left he went into like a a like a pill of fire he went back and there was a rainbow in the room for the whole day something like that and that is what billy paul had all this experience all this experience encounters let me call it an encounter but he didn't have one-on-one experience with the lord jesus christ so there was a time the enemy sidetracked he said you follow your dad i mean of course your mom is dead if your dad you become your daddy's puppets you know you go to him to africa to germany to europe to to preach you don't have fun you don't even get time to bounce your basketball come on do something you got to do something you know and they didn't begin to sidetrack him right you don't have no life just fooling your dad shame prayer cards come on you're a young person you got to get some life your father is an old folk so there was a time he said you know what daddy i want to go and stay with my grandma when folks want to do something you come up with some excuse i want to go and stay with grandma say when did you stay with grandma if you stayed together since your mom died but the prophet saw in vision already and he gave him advice i said billy there's a way before you there's a cross on the left and there's a way on the live that's right you can go all this way you have a choice i cannot bound you you are my son i love you but i cannot put a hedge around you that i want to hey my son don't go out no you are a human being you've got your choice but when you get all the way the cross will still be where you are still be where it is if you go all the way left the cross will be remain where it is so you've got your choice so he said well i want to be so he went to stay with his grandmom because now he wanted to gamble because in brahms house you can gamble so he went to his grandma now he has his own life you could go and play basketball whenever you want another basketball isn't a problem but he wants to go and gamble and do things that he wanted to do that string voice side tracking from his calling this man the angel of the lord reveal himself to him personally and he got attracted to the voice his strange voice and began to do what he did there was a time abraham was preaching as someone he came into church that the kids were trying to push him to go and i mean confess or whatever i go to the altar and abraham was a gentleman after church he talked to him asking how he's doing he said billy there's someone that there's someone was exactly what his god was going through so he said billy i didn't preach someone again the lord gave it to me two weeks ago it's not for you because i'm preaching this on him i didn't mean to preach against you no you know i'll never do that but you just fell in the same one so it might assume that because you're my son i'm preaching against you no i will never do that the lord gave me this sermon two weeks ago to preach it and i have to preach it and say daddy i know you will never do that you'll preach against me and the ram even told the dickens that you know what i know you have a good intention the lord has to do it wow so you can't push him to confess just leave him pray for him i know you love him pray for him and let the lord do the job so all too soon he fell sick at the hospital and began to call for his father and the eldest of the church he was on the verge of dying and now he remembered that his father was a prophet his mama i'm using example your mama he's a christian your mama is a believer your uncle priest your pastor prays for the sick so now when he got sick you didn't invite the people that you gamble with no what why did he invite you people that you drink with why did you invite your boyfriend why did you invite your girlfriend by invited the man that you despise the gospel that you despise that can't pray for me if you know there's a salvation in that man the lord is in him preaching to you the lord is in your dad your uncle your mom your brothers and your sisters preaching to you why don't you even get so closest to them that brother i need to i know that someone have got something i don't have it how can i get it say brother let's go we can pray let's go on our knees it's not hard and so he covered abraham and they went that the kids went to the hospital and he said well you did your sin so you confess first i'm not going to pray for you you confess you whatever you did let it between you and the lord you confess everything to the lord jesus christ i'm not interested in hearing when you confess to the lord then we can pray for you so he confess his sins whatever he did and the lord forgiven they pray for him amen but there's consequences you know but paul had i think three daughters and he buried them all so you have to have the lord is not mocked never think the life that is in you is your life is not your life it's the lord jesus christ it's given to you amen let them come back to my son and i won't keep you long that was just by the way but it was impressive on my heart to say and if i if i hold it's going to hunt to me so i have to point out amen if the lord the lord said is it jeremiah he said jeremiah i sent you you said i'm a child so don't say i'm a child go tell the people they are not the people of strange language if you don't tell them i'm going to hold their blood on you if they are blood if they die in their sin their blood will be on your hands but if you tell them and they are they repent then i will save them if they don't repent their blood will be upon their own head amen so preachers have got responsibility to tell you the truth whatever the lord put upon our heart to speak to you is he in amen if you take it as a life it will transform your life if it despises that is between you and the lord amen libra jack said that i can i can't do nothing but i have to pray the word amen so you have to preach whatever the lord put upon your heart now there's a story back to rehab we all like rehab we're broken in pieces because we are born wrong no because you're drunk not because you fornicated not because you smoke no because you committed adultery but because you were born wrong that breath is the one that put all of us in brokenness beside jesus christ adam and mrs saddam they didn't come the way we came but the rest of creation the rest of humankind we came by sex and that put us in the form of brokenness and so regardless of even if you haven't done any sign of commission you still have to be born again jesus christ to the young rich ruler that he must be born again receive the word that will give you the new breath because the new bed that will help you to be who you are so rehab in the old testament a form of new birth by the rest call it the rest color is the type of jesus christ then on calvary for you and i you have to have the arrest call it on your door post as the enemy can so destroy your life what is the rescalet it's christ in your life the pill of fire in you amen receiving the word into your heart that you and the word become one now when he's walking is jesus christ working people see you as message jesus christ because they see him in you i think invisible union the prophet said that she is him right when the seas were open we became christ we are no longer alienated from god we are him amen we are the lord jesus christ working on earth and when we see our position in the lord when we see who we are then we can step in a vision amen oh glory hallelujah it's like i want to go back glory hallelujah but abram wanted when this were open but abram was in the house of aerys the lord jesus christ is the aries the son of god now iran was in pisces pisces was a cross fish the seven church churches were the gas remember i think jack was talking about this morning about the jews that in if between the old testament we the gentiles will not even have the privilege to come into the house of god but we have been blessed because there was a time god crossed his hands the blessing of the of the firstborn was given to the second born amen the blessing of the jews were given to us because they rejected the gospel and the lord said that now i go to the gentiles he sent paul irenaeus luther wesley abraham and other seven messengers to come to the gentiles to give us the word so now the lord and the prophet were on another dimension but the bride those time the bride haven't received when the seats were open but asked people to ask him question and they said abraham can a woman color her hair when he's preached about the seven thunders revealed seven seas review they were talking about their hair abram was disappointed they said oh lord say i know it's not the time yet for them to see it hey we've read this one as fundamental since he started his ministry in 33. what does he coloring or hair got to do it with the serving seals but it wasn't time for them receive it so he said whatever you have you keep on being good person serving the lord just be who you are but there will be a generation those who come after the eighth come after the seventh church is the eighth day they are the one the wife of christ that the lord will reveal this to them the lord will hide in them and manifest the seven seals on earth amen so there was a time when the lord began to deal with the body of christ god to know that the seven sisters are not strained the seventh thunders are christ in you it's not something coming in the future it's not really abraham resurrecting him brings something again no but it's jesus christ here on earth william ram paved the way for christ and christ has taken over his wife involved marriage after the seven church ages the seven churches were messengers but after the seven church ages christ and his wife are united that's revelation chapter 10 verse 8 to 11 amen and the wife has a ministry before you leave the earth as a body of christ and as an individual you've got a ministry and you have to manifest your ministry and just like rehab we have a ministry to go to become to become adopted he was incarcerated into that family and he has to bring forth children that the lord jesus christ will come through amen and your earth that the lord jesus christ wants to come to your earth is put you here on in west palm beach or wherever you are for a divine purpose the purpose in your earth amen that jesus christ himself will be born out of your flesh glory there are people around you that you should redeem them how do i redeem them rehab was a redeemer when she got to know her please she got to know that oh really i'm not a prostitute no that's life garbage trash just took all the pursuit government trash step one i'm not going to do this again group me wash me and the man gave me a new rope amen a new character the nature the new breath change of nature and when nature changed she became a hebrew the one who was originally a from jericho she was no longer a gentile but she was a supernatural hebrew amen and she married to salomon salmon who gave a peace perfected her and gave her rewards of children amen the spoken word children of god amen our when our earthly life is over give me a minute to get some water when you serve the lord yes but i quick what am i going to get if i forsake all the fun that i have if i forsake my friends maybe my job maybe you're a bad attender or you you've got you whatever you do that you know it's not godly and you forsake it and i receive the lord what will i get the lord will give you eternal life number one because you don't have eternal life you don't know even who you are you think you are something i have my own life no you don't have no life that life can perish it's perishable life it's like a meat when you buy a meat it doesn't last you put it for a while it's beginning to perish so this life is a meat if that's what you have your faith in it's perish but it's an unperishable life the theophany the eternal part of you that is a tenor and that is one that lives eternally amen that is the one that is in you is christ in your form amen christ wants to be part of you and how could be part of you he also had a body that doesn't perish there's only one form of eternal life there's no two billion eternal life it's only one eternal life what's that eternal life jesus christ i think recently abby but abi was asking a question now how can i how can god live in many people if he's only one person said that's a good question but god is infinite he's not finite like my body is finite here to be able to be there i have to move here and when i'm here i'm no longer there but the spirit is infinite a spirit can live in more vessels more so omnipotent god elohim can live in every one of us or the body of christ and there was a sister i'll share a testimony i'm about to close there was a sister a christian who said the lord who had christ in earth now this sister had a cancer she was dying on a hospital in a hospital and a stranger knocked at a hospital at the room that she was and he said can i come in they say sure when she came said can i take a picture of you say sure she took a picture polaroid picture i think one of those disposable old-fashioned camera she left it there and she went he went away he and they took their picture this is that past the way they developed the picture and they saw the sister of course lying at the on the hospital bed and then her children he's got a little kids around they visited at the hospital and had few funny on the right side of the hospital and they had they look went into an old album of this sister and they realized that the picture her theophany was exactly the same as a picture of her when she was younger i want to read the scripture before i continue let's let's read the hebrews chapter hebrews sorry if second corinthians chapter 5 verse one that's my closing scripture second corinthians one to see the reward of eternal life blessed be the name of the lord amen two corinthians five one can somebody help me with the reading okay but yeah but just come and help for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of building of god and house not made with hands in eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is god who also has given up unto us the earnest of the spirit god bless you god bless you brother joseph anders of the spirit amen and i want to share something with you can you help me i don't have maybe i don't know it might not be probably that i don't have family each one can have one probably maybe not if not our princeton later and i want to see the reward of eternal life that went early in the picture that brother brother stephen is sharing you see the sister lying on lino hospital bed and their true hair you know this gospel that the prophets are not people who excuse me to say they don't drink they don't smoke weed or drink a sniff cocaine or take tobacco and come and say that says the lord no it's almighty god speaking through them and that word that they speak is ye and amen it's not a word of falsehood amen we are not believing in fables we are not believing in some of these fables we are not believing in we are not believing in a fable we are not believing in some fables from a man but we are living in reality that when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we haven't won which is in you amen all the experience that you learned on this earth in this 16 element when you finish your life the holy ghost will transport it to the theophany in you to transport it to the other side now heaven is real is not a place that we wonder about is right here just that we are of the human flesh is of another dimension and the heavily celestial dimension is of also another dimension so they of that dimension see you by real of this dimension unless through visions through inspiration through revelation through trans that is when we see the other dimension there was a time i don't know your experience but the more i pray god give us more supernatural greater dynamics and that's what the lord is doing there was a time that when if you are by yourself when you a place where there's nobody with you sometimes i don't know if it's like somebody's following you but there's nobody following you and it's scary is that select the being in you wanted you to unveil himself to you and if you can take it that is a celestial body want to have is in you but when there's no there's no people around you want to have that sweet communion with you there's a time when you pray you move into the spirit you go over beyond this mind you could see the celestial dimension around you i see somebody standing by you it is the being it is your true self that is making himself known to you there was a time i was praying for a brother he was sick i went to his house to pray for me and his family and as i was praying i see the being in me moving out of me going to the brother and i didn't know that brother had that experience so after we finished the brother the lord said that i said brother when you pray for me i saw the holy ghost coming from you and touching my body god has got eternal purpose for you in earth your life is to influence people your life is to bring in a benefit dividend return on investment the lord has invested eternal life he gave us food clothing houses shelter family school job cities peace security for you just for you amen what are you giving back to god he heals your sickness he takes care of your family he put food on your table when you sick people blackjack will pray for you your brothers and sisters will pray for you the lord heals you you just are you in earth just to eat drink and go back that when you go the lord gave a gift to people if i think the four or whatever people that you give give to you give one i'm just making up numbers one a talent right they're probably the talents one hundred one fifty thirty and five and two and one something like that and one person chose that you know what this person is a mean person i'm not going to spend my time you know working for him i'm going to put one talent there when he come back i'll give it back give me one one dollar that's your one dollar take it back so the man came back in the day of reckoning that hey i want to see what you did with the talent say well the one who got hundred well i make hundred okay good good seven stand here um you gave me fifty i made fifty i made thirty the one that had one said well i know you're a wicked person you want to reap what you did so so i've got your one dollar here for you take it back really you could have put an investment somewhere if you think i'm wiki i want to reap when i don't sue is there a lot of wicked persons that a lot cassimo to the outer darkness if the gift the lord put in your life you don't use it for god's glory your life you don't want to live the christian life you don't want christ to marry to you but you want to have your own life on quotes you'll find out pretty soon whether that belongs to you or not so this day if you've heard the voice of god let's commit all our heart to the lord and this is an evidence of a sister this i think somewhere 2008 a minister posted it the lord is real the gospel is real but abram didn't come to deceive us no he didn't come to tell us fables no the lord didn't send prophet to come and tell a story don't pay he to lose a voice no don't let somebody deceive you out of the message that the word of the lord is not true but give all your soul all your heart and the day that even you leave this flesh you'll be walking the celestial dimension when your children are crying say oh for them they don't know where i am i'm here in this celestial dimension i'm shaking out with my sin with the sins i'm here before the lord and that is the gospel the lord has given to us god bless you we have another tamaraco in us that is non-perishable it's antenna it passes through walls it passes through every condition and when this earth can hold himself the lord has put something new that hold you less than our feet and shoulder prayer our heavenly father we thank you for this day thank you for the peace you've given to us we give all the glory and honor to your name father your word has been sown water poor water and light and oxygen and everything lord jesus faith revelation that the word becomes life in our being manifesting you bringing dividends return on investment for what you planted in us before the foundation of the world put us in our in heavenly places the position of the believer in christ that each and every one of us those online streaming those who are even walking on the street not knowing who they are let the gospel reach each and every one of them and bring them to who you've made them to be we thank you this day bless our dear pastor by the jack bless the body of christ here lord jesus christ let this week be so prosperous let the supernatural the dynamics take a hold of every heart and bring glory and honor to your name we love you we bless you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you man god bless you praise the lord i mean appreciate brother kwaku um all i can say is um the holy spirit is real um he's perfect he's precise and uh he just knows just how to speak to you he knows uh he knows where you are and where you're standing and there was so many things that were spoken this morning that i knew were direct i want to say multiple conversations that i had this week um the lord came in here and and dealt with and and i know i know it's god i know it's god so i i really appreciate how the lord used our precious brethren and i encourage you let the let the lord get dividends from your life don't don't don't let it be a deficit right but let the lord get dividends from your life amen uh nobody here um is responsible for how you got here nobody god's responsible right and uh you know and no matter how we come and you know and how we go and i mean even this picture you look at this that it gave us this it is sisters leaving and some some stranger walks into the room and you can see that you know what uh this is what they see in the room but this is the picture shows us what god see you know a family that's that's united and fellowship and smiling and you know just just you know this is what it's gonna be like on the other side so you know what we what we have to go through here don't mean nothing it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us keep pressing church whatever you do keep pressing and amen and just uh be determined to overcome um you know brother billy paul as he was talking about brother billy paul because of his decisions he ended up losing his ministry his his decisions caused him to lose his ministry right and it was just you know the the when you look at it though uh god still allows brother billy paul the opportunity just to share some of those testimonies and they encourage people all over the world but he could have been a preacher but his decisions as a young man caused him to lose his ministry we need to take note of these things we need to learn you know from from from other people you know and and i tell you this is just this to me was tremendous it was it was full of vitamins spiritual vitamins it was just full of vitamins today situation that i was you know in and you know just praying for someone and i'm just you know when you're going and you're praying was telling y'all about yesterday when i went out but this wasn't the first time i went out to pray a few few few weeks ago i got a call at 1 30 in the morning to pray for this person and i prayed and um and then i took brother quaker with me and said we're gonna go visit these people at their house and you know and i went we visited before i pray i like to try to find out what's really going on you know what's happening you just don't walk in and just pray you know no what's happening what's going on you know and as i'm talking i'm trying to discern certain things trying to discern trying to discern you know and uh and uh you know so i just began to just kind of give some things and and um and and after we left uh um you know we invited him to get on our prayer prayer group brothers didn't know this i invited him to get on the prayer line and these this this group of men came on the prayer line one night brothers didn't know what what was i just i just introduced him didn't tell him what was going on but as we were on the prayer line i know brother solomon he started praying certain things that was coming out of his prayer he didn't even realize what he was saying and i said oh my look at god moving in the midst of this so you know after that prayer this young man just began to do a lot better a lot better a lot better next thing you know he started going back down again so wait a minute what's going on so because the the god that i know when he cast out devils i want to show y'all how he did it [Music] amen that's the god that i know the the bible say by the finger of god by the thing of god devils were were cast out right did jesus just walk up and just leave i mean even even when legion jesus didn't even say nothing legion they actually knew their time was up they come begging would you please not send us you know to the abyss but let us go into the swine they knew they time was up it's time for people to know and we would talk about dynamics and mechanics and and i'm seeing dynamics i'm seeing it i'm seeing it sometimes we don't see it you know we think it's because we don't see certain things here but god is moving church and i'm just sitting there just trying to pick up on things pick up on things and yesterday the lord just kind of had me ask a question and i just asked a question i just let it be i just let it be but i know god don't just have you say things just to say things because there's certain reasons why devil will feel comfortable staying in certain situations [Music] you need man we need we talked about it you know and and bible study i want to say a few few months ago about the spirit of wisdom coming into the church and and sometimes that's what we need for you just jump up and in the name of jesus just wait wait and get the spirit of wisdom let them come down and speak something to you right because you get so alert alarmed and alerted and you just i mean you know i'ma tell you a person that know they got power don't yell and scream [Music] the person that really know where they position they don't get on the screen i remember my uncle you know he was in the military and he walked into a room and he started seeing guys they having a conversation they stop i say well my lord what in the world is going on here he knew there's certain bars that he wearing oh come on church certain balls that he wearing and and he all everybody understand they they they position because of those bars hallelujah to the lamb of god it's time for the devil to recognize the sons of god's position because of what christ has done for us but first we need to know what he's done for us church we got to be running from devils and all this other kind of stuff we need to know who we are and take take your place with authority with authority god knows i heard from heaven i heard from heaven today before i get caught up and forget to say this uh last week we were left just an announcement as we walked out the pastor next door came and greeted me and said pastor when y'all come out to church and start talking y'all just the noise just flows right into our service if y'all could just please just try to keep it down we greatly appreciate it i say sure sure we'll do that so as you all are going out today just please be mindful that there's somebody else is still having church and we just want to move away from the church amen in order to accommodate them and and one day we're going to have our own building but we won't have to worry about things like that you can go out and really just fellas i mean just really just just let it all fly but uh and i know after you get a service like this you

place today we know the spirit of god has spoken father in our prayers that we won't just hear these words and go out of here like we didn't hear them father let the word make a difference let the word begin to change and transform us and renew us form us into your image of god and lord as uh brother kwaku just began to go through and many of us sometimes we think that this life that we have that we gave it to ourselves we don't realize it's you that breathe the breath of life into our bodies no matter what our circumstances and situations are you breathe the breath of life and and god uh sometimes we get to the point where we think that we can just do whatever we want to do but lord i thank you that your grace would speak to us amen and the way that you spoke to us this morning that we would just if we would hear it we would humble ourselves in your very presence and realize god that we can't live the way that we want to live even in the midst of our sin you have been watching over us your grace has still been covering us lord even in the midst of us doing things that we should not be doing you have still been covering us and god lord we want to pause this morning and say thank you jesus [Music] god you've been so real you've been so true you've been so kind and god i just pray that we would come to a place that as we at you told us any word as many as believed on him to them gave he power to become the sons and daughters of god lord i pray somebody would just believe right now believe that you spoke to him believe god that it wasn't just brother quaker but it was the voice of god speaking through a man if we receive it lord we'll be changed by the transformation of the power of the word of god i pray lord that you just bless hearts thank you for your servant getting himself out of the way and just allowing your father just to share through his lips the various testimonies and lord things that he's experienced and god just uh it's it's what we call a spirit of pride that rises up inside of people causes them to do these things that little bitty spirit of pride leads to destruction god i pray that you would help us oh god help us jesus that you continue to bless them and continue to use them for your glory lord this uh family god that i went to uh just be with on yesterday god do mighty work in the life of the people and lord may you get glory and honor amen to your name through the situation and circumstance we know that you are in control all of our loved ones you are in control no matter what is going on father as we got this just uh looking at billy paul's life and some of the things that he went through but yet lord you've used them for your glory with the many testimonies that he's given and and father how he has blessed us over the years we're grateful for it but i pray lord that others will be able to just kind of look to that and see the grace of god that's been given to a man and have such a supernatural experience but if it's not something happened on the inside then lord is it's just it's not meeting the mark so i pray god you help us all to rise up and meet the mark we need more of you jesus bless us as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence may the spirit of god go with us may we meditate on the things that we heard may we talk about the things that we heard here today and may the glory of god just draw near if there's anything in our lives that we need to fix and straighten out god i pray the spirit of god would not give us rest [Music] don't let us have rest god until we make things right with you you can't just keep coming in the house of god or leaving the house of god the same way things must be right you want us to be ready lord you you're coming for a bride without spot or a wrinkle we're determined to be that right keep us until we're able to come back together in this place on wednesday night jesus we love you jesus we praise you it's in jesus christ's name that we pray amen amen the lord richard bless your church you can be seated the brothers will come and dismiss you if you desire just to sit in the presence of the lord and just let the lord keep ministering to you you are welcome to do that you don't have to rush out we're not putting you out or anything those that need to leave we certainly want to give you the opportunity to do so but if there's someone that just wants to stay in the presence of god then you do that the bible say today that you hear his voice heart not your heart god bless you god bless you those that have joined us
