[1:02:48] bring it bring it to you so you can
[1:02:50] catch the thought today a man and I want
[1:02:54] to appreciate the specials that that
[1:02:55] went forth on today and you know sister
[1:02:59] Tina kind of stepped right into I
[1:03:02] thought I was sitting there trying to
[1:03:04] like what am I gonna title this you know
[1:03:06] and and and the Lord had given me a
[1:03:09] title earlier this morning it just gave
[1:03:12] me no need to worry no need to worry
[1:03:14] and she came right and start singing on
[1:03:17] that song there so I said well that's a
[1:03:19] confirmation a man from God here first
[1:03:23] grin first King 17 starting at verse 8
[1:03:27] it says in the word of the Lord came
[1:03:30] unto him saying arise get thee to
[1:03:32] Zarephath which belongeth to Zion and
[1:03:35] dwell there behold I have commanded a
[1:03:38] widow woman there to sustain thee a man
[1:03:44] so he arose and went to Zarephath and
[1:03:47] when it came to the gate of the city
[1:03:49] behold the widow woman was there
[1:03:51] gathering of sticks and he called to her
[1:03:53] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[1:03:55] water and a vessel that I may drink and
[1:03:57] as she was going to fetch it
[1:04:00] they called her and said bring me I pray
[1:04:03] the immortal
[1:04:03] Rayland I'm ham and he said as the Lord
[1:04:06] thy God liveth I have not a cake but a
[1:04:08] handful of meal and a barrel and a
[1:04:11] little oil and a cruse and behold I am
[1:04:13] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:04:15] and dress it for me and my son that we
[1:04:18] may eat eat it and die and Elijah said
[1:04:23] unto her fear not go and do as thou has
[1:04:26] said but make me there of a little cake
[1:04:28] first and bring it unto me after and
[1:04:31] after make for thee and for thy son for
[1:04:34] thus saith the Lord God of Israel the
[1:04:36] barrel mill shall not waste neither
[1:04:38] shall the cruse of oil fail until the
[1:04:41] day that the Lord sent his reign upon
[1:04:44] the earth and she went and did according
[1:04:46] to the sing of Elijah and she and and he
[1:04:50] in her house did eat many days in the
[1:04:54] barreled mill wasted not neither did the
[1:04:57] cruse of oil fail according to the word
[1:05:00] of the Lord which he speak by Elijah
[1:05:03] amen I just want to also just take a
[1:05:06] scripture from second Corinthians
[1:05:07] chapter 5 a man trusts that the Lord
[1:05:13] will help us with this amen on today
[1:05:17] glory to God
[1:05:20] here it says for we know that if our
[1:05:24] earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:05:26] dissolved we have a building of God a
[1:05:28] house not made with hands eternal in the
[1:05:32] heavens
[1:05:33] amen the Lord and a blessing to the
[1:05:34] reading of his word shall we just have a
[1:05:36] word of Prayer and we'll let you have
[1:05:38] your seats father we thank you for this
[1:05:41] opportunity to reach Scripture but we
[1:05:43] know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring
[1:05:45] clarity and understanding to us we trust
[1:05:48] that you would take control father by
[1:05:51] thought here today Lord me every mother
[1:05:53] here leave strengthened and encouraged
[1:05:55] by your spirit and we trust o God that
[1:06:00] you would just bless them we thank you
[1:06:02] for them we realize there's an the the
[1:06:05] there's the love of a mother is next to
[1:06:09] the love of God and father how we just
[1:06:12] appreciate them and their patience their
[1:06:14] love their everything that they've done
[1:06:16] the guy
[1:06:16] their wisdom that they've given two or
[1:06:18] three years thank you for these godly
[1:06:20] mothers that have raised children here
[1:06:22] and and lord I just pray each one would
[1:06:24] receive their reward not just in heaven
[1:06:26] but even here on earth may they receive
[1:06:27] the reward for the great things that
[1:06:29] they do bless this service today in
[1:06:32] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[1:06:35] you praise the Lord we just want to use
[1:06:38] for our subject no need to worry
[1:06:50] certainly if that's just something we
[1:06:52] can encourage the mothers with no need
[1:06:55] to worry
[1:06:56] oftentimes we go through things in life
[1:06:59] we go through different challenges
[1:07:00] different trials especially when you're
[1:07:02] raising a man a family and things that
[1:07:06] nature things come up they men and
[1:07:07] families things happen and you know
[1:07:10] oftentimes the devil is just throwing
[1:07:12] curveballs and all kind of things like
[1:07:14] that but I won't encourage your mothers
[1:07:16] just just don't worry God got everything
[1:07:18] under control
[1:07:19] and I mean last Sunday there was a I
[1:07:24] think with brother J Breathitt sermon
[1:07:26] our faith was elevated to believe God
[1:07:29] for our families so many people stand in
[1:07:31] the gap for their loved ones and and I'm
[1:07:33] just under expectation that a man you
[1:07:36] will receive what you asked for
[1:07:38] amen hallelujah God is the one that made
[1:07:45] the promise God said the promise is unto
[1:07:47] you and to your children those that are
[1:07:49] far off as many as the Lord our God
[1:07:50] shall call and if God spoke it then it's
[1:07:53] got to come to pass there's not one word
[1:07:55] that he has said that will fail Amen not
[1:07:58] one word will fail so let me just kind
[1:08:01] of start off here reading a little a
[1:08:03] little thought from the sermon the
[1:08:05] invasion of the United States a man the
[1:08:08] Prophet makes this comment here says to
[1:08:10] you little mothers this morning that's
[1:08:13] been real mother's a man just because
[1:08:17] you can have a child don't make you a
[1:08:19] mama
[1:08:20] praise the Lord Amen you got some
[1:08:22] responsibilities amen and raising that
[1:08:24] child in the ways of God that's what
[1:08:26] makes you a mother so says to your
[1:08:28] little mothers here this morning that's
[1:08:29] been real mother's and I know there's
[1:08:31] many of you I think every one of you let
[1:08:33] me tell you something god bless you
[1:08:34] you're the fifth gospel and when he's
[1:08:38] talking about the fifth gospel Matthew
[1:08:39] Mark Luke and John those are the four
[1:08:41] Gospels but it's saying you're as mama
[1:08:43] you are the fifth gospel says let me
[1:08:46] tell you what's in there for your
[1:08:48] children just a little thing says
[1:08:50] because brother Neville will probably
[1:08:51] preach on about mother tomato
[1:08:53] whoever one of us that preaches all
[1:08:55] right about mothers but listen let me
[1:08:57] ask you something you can see the
[1:08:58] Prophet did preach about mothers
[1:09:00] praise the Lord somebody there are all
[1:09:03] the deep things that he talked about one
[1:09:06] of the deep things was to talk about
[1:09:07] Mama's praise the Lord right a man says
[1:09:13] but listen let me ask you something
[1:09:15] remember when Moses was a little boy it
[1:09:17] was a mother who gave him his
[1:09:20] instruction
[1:09:21] it was a godly mother who took a little
[1:09:24] Moses on her knees and said Moses taught
[1:09:27] him Octomom he was she was his teacher
[1:09:32] rather under Pharaoh and and said now
[1:09:35] these things that Moses some day you're
[1:09:37] going to deliver the children of Israel
[1:09:39] you were the boy
[1:09:41] that's called keep yourself pure and
[1:09:44] unspotted from the world for you're the
[1:09:46] one you're the one no other place do we
[1:09:49] know where he ever went just in a
[1:09:51] seminary any teaching at all he ever got
[1:09:55] he stayed right in Pharaoh's Palace
[1:09:57] which was a heathen but his mother
[1:09:59] taught him that's a real mother she
[1:10:02] taught him the precepts of the Lord she
[1:10:04] told him how he must be holy she told
[1:10:07] him how he what he must live and and
[1:10:11] what God must do would do for him and it
[1:10:13] stuck with Moses all the days of his
[1:10:15] life so I want to tell you mothers make
[1:10:17] sure you saw these type of things into
[1:10:19] your children talk to them about living
[1:10:21] holy
[1:10:22] talk to them about living right talking
[1:10:24] about keeping their selves until God
[1:10:26] give them a husband to give them a wife
[1:10:28] there's nothing wrong with sharing those
[1:10:30] things with your children a man the
[1:10:33] wildly gonna give it to them so you
[1:10:34] might as well give it to them right come
[1:10:36] on somebody amen mothers don't be don't
[1:10:40] be ashamed to have some type of
[1:10:41] conversations with your children glory
[1:10:43] to God Amen it's important that a mama
[1:10:45] tell the child set expectations a man
[1:10:49] for the children listen says in any good
[1:10:51] true lawyer mother that'll take her
[1:10:53] little babies instead of sending them to
[1:10:55] picture shows and dances and so forth
[1:10:58] like that she'll put them on her lap and
[1:11:00] teach them about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:03] amen that's it that's that's very very
[1:11:06] important for mothers to do that that is
[1:11:08] that is a role that we play I want to
[1:11:10] just make a few comments here I was like
[1:11:15] I said I was blessed to have a man a
[1:11:17] godly mother and and and one of the
[1:11:21] things that mama did for me even as I
[1:11:23] you know got into becoming a teenage she
[1:11:26] was a real example a real example a man
[1:11:28] of what what a Christian is and there's
[1:11:30] many little thoughts that go through my
[1:11:32] head of mama and just how she conducted
[1:11:35] herself and handled herself through
[1:11:36] different situations and you know when
[1:11:38] we didn't really want to serve the Lord
[1:11:39] she was still a godly mother a man and
[1:11:42] and and I just saw I remember you know
[1:11:46] going to a friend's house and we had
[1:11:48] service on Sunday Sunday evenings and
[1:11:50] you know going to church once this one
[1:11:52] sunny was good enough for me at that
[1:11:54] time we really didn't want to go right
[1:11:57] me and my brother I can't remember what
[1:11:59] time we really want to go in and Mama
[1:12:01] and Daddy decided they wanted to walk to
[1:12:03] church one morning and we were we were
[1:12:05] we were too cool a man to be seen
[1:12:08] walking with our family to church walk
[1:12:10] to church but hide us in the car and
[1:12:13] take us right and and and they said no
[1:12:17] we gonna walk good it's a good day we're
[1:12:18] gonna walk the church and lord have
[1:12:20] mercy we say y'all go ahead would catch
[1:12:22] up with y'all Amen we want to be seen
[1:12:24] walking with the family and so so mom
[1:12:27] and daddy went on ahead with our sisters
[1:12:28] and my little brother and and me
[1:12:31] older brother we stay we stay back will
[1:12:33] come will forget their look at their and
[1:12:35] before we knew it somehow
[1:12:38] the daddy had made it back to the house
[1:12:40] before we could get out of the house and
[1:12:43] daddy staff thought y'all was coming to
[1:12:45] church yeah we coming and daddy had a
[1:12:47] belt in his hand and we got at that
[1:12:49] house real fast right and we walked to
[1:12:52] church with my dad but you know I
[1:12:55] remember things like that growing up as
[1:12:58] a little boy and I remember this one
[1:12:59] little friend that I go to his house in
[1:13:01] between services and we always went
[1:13:03] outside on Sunday a man and we try to
[1:13:06] hide because we knew that Sunday evening
[1:13:07] service service would come so we try to
[1:13:09] hide in a back yard so that when mama
[1:13:11] came by that house she wouldn't see us
[1:13:13] in the front yard and it's amazing how
[1:13:15] we we could tell time at a very early
[1:13:18] age we knew exactly what time it was and
[1:13:20] we said now we got that we can we go
[1:13:22] around the back and man can we hang out
[1:13:24] in the back now they didn't know why we
[1:13:26] was hanging on the back but I knew why I
[1:13:28] want to go to the backyard amen
[1:13:30] mama was on her way and if mama saw me
[1:13:33] in the front yard what did you think
[1:13:34] mama would have did the car would have
[1:13:36] stopped it would have hurt she might
[1:13:39] wanna just blow her horn first and I
[1:13:42] would have to act like I knew what that
[1:13:43] meant
[1:13:44] cause if I wouldn't acted like I knew
[1:13:46] what that meant the mama would have got
[1:13:47] out hallelujah and all she said church
[1:13:51] time now I would have been so
[1:13:54] embarrassed to have to go to church but
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:56] mama mama was just mainstay in our life
[1:13:59] and you know and even when when I was
[1:14:01] when I was trying to run from God seeing
[1:14:03] those type of things in her hallelujah
[1:14:05] when I got old amen I became the parent
[1:14:08] that she was Amy
[1:14:12] she's so certain seeds way back Dean and
[1:14:16] not its president we're like when I got
[1:14:18] on some mom I want to tell you and all
[1:14:19] you other mothers don't worry you keep
[1:14:21] training up your children right the way
[1:14:24] that they're supposed to go and when
[1:14:26] they get all the Bible says they will
[1:14:29] not depart I don't care what you're
[1:14:32] looking at right now mama don't worry no
[1:14:35] need to worry no need to worry let me go
[1:14:38] to the Prophet this makes a few comments
[1:14:40] and I'm not going to take take read all
[1:14:43] these uh quotes but I'll just I'll tell
[1:14:46] you what the sermon that they're coming
[1:14:47] from I'm just reading sentences out of
[1:14:49] it so don't worry about pulling this up
[1:14:50] in the message mother's day he makes a
[1:14:53] comment says Abraham Lincoln never owned
[1:14:56] a book in his life until he was after 21
[1:14:59] years old but the Bible and the Fox Book
[1:15:02] of Martyrs those are only two books he
[1:15:03] owned up until he was 21 years old
[1:15:05] because brother brother brother branham
[1:15:07] said see what you read most of character
[1:15:09] that you are alright what you read will
[1:15:13] mold the character of what you are
[1:15:15] hallelujah and and and and I just I have
[1:15:19] to take time to read a little something
[1:15:21] because mama put this in me proverbs 1
[1:15:24] verse 8 a man proverbs 1 when I was a
[1:15:28] young man after you know coming up
[1:15:30] through school and before I got married
[1:15:33] I was still at home a man and mama used
[1:15:36] to just tell me son just reap Roberts
[1:15:38] just reap reverbs and I'm like I don't
[1:15:41] want to read proverbs just reap reverbs
[1:15:43] just read proverbs but you know we grew
[1:15:45] up with this thing that we were supposed
[1:15:47] to be obedient our parents anybody else
[1:15:51] still grown over that and even though we
[1:15:53] didn't want to do it we did it anyway
[1:15:54] because we understood that there was a
[1:15:56] long life associated with being obedient
[1:15:59] to your parents oh my god ha ha times
[1:16:03] have changed
[1:16:06] I see children that actually thank they
[1:16:10] parents let me ask a question then I'd
[1:16:12] give birth to you or did you give birth
[1:16:15] to me huh
[1:16:18] well if I'm a parent it's gonna be like
[1:16:20] what I say raisin Lord but things have
[1:16:23] changed and we don't give some of us
[1:16:25] parents that gave our kids a little bit
[1:16:27] too much leeway we gotta keep them in
[1:16:30] check with Amen God got an order to this
[1:16:32] thing there are always be your child all
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] hallelujah amen but mama mom used to
[1:16:44] tell us read proverbs if read proverbs
[1:16:47] and and I and and now that same advice I
[1:16:50] give to other young men I got that from
[1:16:52] my mama right when I'm talking other
[1:16:54] young me and what they want to know
[1:16:55] where where I start out reading Bible
[1:16:56] read proverbs read Psalms
[1:16:59] these are easy things to read read that
[1:17:01] and just let it just soak into your
[1:17:02] spirit but this is one that mama gave me
[1:17:05] and and just read proverbs and I just
[1:17:07] wanted to read a little bit of this and
[1:17:08] proverbs are one chapter of the first
[1:17:10] chapters starting at verse actually
[1:17:12] let's start at verse 7 says the fear of
[1:17:16] the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
[1:17:18] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:17:22] my son and I took that person in my son
[1:17:26] here the instruction of their father and
[1:17:29] forsake not the law of thy mother now
[1:17:34] what would the scriptures say that hear
[1:17:36] destruction of their father a mistake
[1:17:39] not the law of thy mother you realize in
[1:17:43] the house so typically his mom
[1:17:44] establishing the law hallelujah
[1:17:47] now she used data Tim forces come on
[1:17:50] somebody
[1:17:51] hallelujah she's using daddy to actually
[1:17:54] make it make it coming to law when it
[1:17:57] comes out of
[1:17:58] nice mouth right everybody fall in place
[1:18:01] but it's mama encouraged of daddy behind
[1:18:04] the scenes we need to put this in place
[1:18:06] for them
[1:18:07] oh come on somebody hallelujah
[1:18:10] I thank God for my wife a man mothered
[1:18:13] my children and as you know I say I'm a

[1:20:32] foot from their path for their feet run
[1:20:35] to evil and make haste to shed blood
[1:20:37] surely in vain the net is spread in the
[1:20:41] sight of any bird and they may wait for
[1:20:44] their own blood they lurk privily for
[1:20:46] their own lives so are they so are the
[1:20:48] ways of everyone that is greedy of gain
[1:20:50] which taketh away the life of the owners
[1:20:54] thereof now you know I was I would
[1:20:57] sometimes just sit in my own quiet time
[1:20:59] and I'd just be reading proverbs and and
[1:21:02] I didn't realize that you know while I
[1:21:04] was reading a man proverbs that this
[1:21:06] this wisdom was being imparted in me I
[1:21:09] wasn't I well I couldn't say that I was
[1:21:11] meditating on proverbs I mean all I was
[1:21:14] doing was just obeying my mother who
[1:21:15] said read proverbs and I would go read
[1:21:18] it because if she asked did you read it
[1:21:20] then I could say yeah I read it already
[1:21:22] but I didn't realize as I was reading it
[1:21:25] it was actually depositing something
[1:21:27] inside of me and this thing was actually
[1:21:30] done control who I was oh my goodness
[1:21:34] and I thank God mother that would
[1:21:36] actually instill that in me because it
[1:21:38] allowed me to make the right decisions
[1:21:40] through life mama didn't have to come
[1:21:42] get me out of jail right I'm grateful
[1:21:46] for that she never had to come get me
[1:21:48] out of jail
[1:21:49] hallelujah right so so so so I will
[1:21:52] encourage a men are not tested that the
[1:21:54] sons but even the daughters read propers
[1:21:56] read proverbs Leonard says God your
[1:21:59] heart catch of my I mean when you read
[1:22:01] scripture you don't realize power
[1:22:03] shaping your character
[1:22:04] Rihan Lincoln was shaped by reading
[1:22:07] scripture yes hallelujah the Prophet
[1:22:11] makes another statement here and I
[1:22:13] thought this was real good in the
[1:22:16] Philadelphia Church age no no actually
[1:22:18] let me go a little further this is our
[1:22:19] Mother's Day he says it says in the face
[1:22:23] of all that let me go on this court he
[1:22:26] says what you read most of character
[1:22:29] that you I listen the message Mother's
[1:22:30] Day says no wonder we got a bunch of new
[1:22:33] rocks today little old fiction magazines
[1:22:35] and vulgar nonsense is placed upon on
[1:22:37] newsstands here on the Bible the Fox
[1:22:39] Book of Martyrs look what it made him
[1:22:41] but in the face of all that one day he
[1:22:43] made a statement like this he said if
[1:22:45] there could be any good thing found in
[1:22:48] me it's because of a godly mother that
[1:22:52] reared him to serve the Lord and he goes
[1:22:54] on the process you see a child listens
[1:22:56] to his mother something little some
[1:23:00] little touch about that mother that a
[1:23:02] child will listen to listen when it's
[1:23:05] hurt when a child is hurt when it's hurt
[1:23:08] it'll go to the mother for consolation
[1:23:11] before it'll go to the Father the
[1:23:15] Prophet says when a child is hurt it'll
[1:23:17] go to the mother for consolation before
[1:23:21] it'll go to the Father now I think you
[1:23:25] know we all do that if something's going
[1:23:27] on the first person we go crying to is
[1:23:29] his mama
[1:23:30] and when you got mama dare to listen to
[1:23:33] you and the bear with you and all of
[1:23:34] that you ought to thank God for it
[1:23:36] Amen you ought to thank God for it and
[1:23:38] and and I know as a as a husband I can
[1:23:42] appreciate that
[1:23:43] a man my wife is there for her kids and
[1:23:46] I see them that you know they talk and
[1:23:47] they communicate and and and I can
[1:23:49] appreciate that that knowing that they
[1:23:50] got that type of relationship right I
[1:23:53] mean that is a what we call a fix-it man
[1:23:56] a man he simply wants to take a
[1:23:58] screwdriver or a hammer
[1:24:01] praise the Lord whatever is necessary
[1:24:03] and he want it fixed now glory to God
[1:24:07] that's how daddy but momma gonna sit
[1:24:09] there and cry with you little bit
[1:24:11] huh mama gonna sit there and talk with
[1:24:13] you a little bit I don't care how old
[1:24:15] you get they met you enjoy hearing your
[1:24:18] mama's voice especially when you going
[1:24:21] through something you enjoy hearing see
[1:24:23] a child when it's hurt it's gonna go to
[1:24:25] mother for consolation before it'll go
[1:24:28] to father this something about a man
[1:24:30] being held by mama all right he says
[1:24:34] because she was the first with it you
[1:24:35] know and there's some gift that God
[1:24:37] gives a mother to be that way I mean a
[1:24:39] real mother and I believe that mothers
[1:24:41] are honorable and godly now here's a
[1:24:44] statement that was made here in the
[1:24:46] Philadelphia Church age John Wesley was
[1:24:49] the messenger to this age and and the
[1:24:51] Prophet pulls up something a man out of
[1:24:54] John Wesley's family his daddy was a
[1:24:56] chaplain which would have made him a
[1:24:58] preacher a man but brother Rams say his
[1:25:01] father was a chaplain in the Church of
[1:25:02] England but it's more than likely that
[1:25:05] the religious turn of John's mind wasn't
[1:25:09] based on what his daddy did the
[1:25:11] religious turn of John's mind was based
[1:25:14] more upon his mother's exemplary life
[1:25:18] than upon his father's theology I want
[1:25:22] you to get that scroll back go go back
[1:25:24] up yeah there you go
[1:25:25] he says it was it was more than likely
[1:25:28] that the religious turn of judgments or
[1:25:31] the religious turn of of a child's mind
[1:25:34] a man is based more upon the mother's
[1:25:38] exemplary life amen then upon the
[1:25:41] father's theology we ought to think
[1:25:45] gospel mom for mamas we ought to really
[1:25:47] appreciate promised if John amen a
[1:25:50] message of messenger to the aged was
[1:25:52] more influenced by how his mama handle
[1:25:55] things and hi his mama did things amen
[1:25:58] what what type of mother should we be
[1:26:00] today amen she raised a not I mean a
[1:26:04] messenger through her exemplary life
[1:26:07] that's what caused him to want to turn
[1:26:09] to God
[1:26:11] all Halloween a man I'll tell you what
[1:26:15] when you got a godly mother like that it
[1:26:17] kind of makes it easy for you to say you
[1:26:19] know what I remember God did this from
[1:26:21] my mom and God did that for my mama and
[1:26:22] I want to serve the same God that mama
[1:26:24] surf hey man momma's y'all y'all don't
[1:26:28] worry you keep showing you just keep
[1:26:29] shining like you keep doing what you're
[1:26:31] doing
[1:26:31] amen the kids run to mama because it's
[1:26:34] just natural for them to do that
[1:26:36] Amen that's natural for them to do that
[1:26:39] and mama has mama responds differently
[1:26:41] than daddy does amen
[1:26:43] right so it's very natural for that
[1:26:45] nothing wrong with that I want to read
[1:26:46] this out of the message Amen the
[1:26:48] influence of another a man will read
[1:26:52] this one let's just pull this or enough
[1:26:54] for me the influence of another go right
[1:26:56] to paragraph 38 on that influence of
[1:26:58] another the Prophet says this oh your
[1:27:01] family your family is what you are say
[1:27:05] you raised your child in a certain
[1:27:09] environment it's got I like this
[1:27:11] statement if you raise your child in a
[1:27:13] certain environment I'm a paragraph 38
[1:27:15] says if you Ranger up your child in a
[1:27:19] certain environment it's got a 98%
[1:27:22] better chance to go right then then it
[1:27:25] is then it has if you bring it up the
[1:27:28] wrong way so your child if your child is
[1:27:31] raised in the right environment it has a
[1:27:34] 98% chance to go right then it has if
[1:27:40] you're bringing up the wrong way now
[1:27:41] i'ma tell you I'd like to take my
[1:27:43] chances if I got a 98% chance that my
[1:27:49] child gonna go right because I raised
[1:27:52] them right I'm gonna take my chances now
[1:27:56] you have to expect every child is gonna
[1:27:58] run to a spot where there's gonna be
[1:28:00] maybe thinking about not doing it the
[1:28:02] way that you did
[1:28:04] man they got kind of go against what you
[1:28:06] did but if you did what God told you to
[1:28:08] do once they get to that spot ain't no
[1:28:11] need to worry it's gonna work out just
[1:28:13] right chance that this child gonna serve
[1:28:22] God when they get over because I did
[1:28:25] what I was supposed to do I like that I
[1:28:29] like that it says it's a it's got a 98%
[1:28:33] better chance to go right then it has if
[1:28:37] you bring it up in the wrong way bring
[1:28:39] up a child in the way that it should go
[1:28:41] and when it's oh well not it will not
[1:28:44] depart from it be brought up right teach
[1:28:47] the children to do right to be honest

[1:38:56] you never pray for the man what you did
[1:38:58] was come in the office you stayed here
[1:39:01] for a little over our and do you come
[1:39:03] I'm just saying praise the Lord
[1:39:04] the man said I was Louie and he left
[1:39:05] daddy I don't know what happened so he
[1:39:08] told Billy something let me just give
[1:39:11] you all the scripture on this this is
[1:39:12] why I read 2nd Corinthians 5:1 all right
[1:39:17] this way I read this for we know that if
[1:39:20] our earthly House of this Tabernacle
[1:39:22] were dissolved we have a building of God
[1:39:24] a house not made with hands eternal in
[1:39:27] the heavens
[1:39:27] now I read that scripture because you
[1:39:30] know what brother Branham said is and I
[1:39:33] want I would just want to come and drop
[1:39:34] this you don't just for a little bit
[1:39:36] I'll finish off the store in a second
[1:39:38] but I want to drop a little something in
[1:39:40] here when you're born you know it's mama
[1:39:45] that make preparation for you when
[1:39:48] you're born you realize that you know
[1:39:50] they have the the baby showers and they
[1:39:52] have all these other things the child
[1:39:54] does not even have a chance to select
[1:39:56] the clothes that it wants the child does
[1:40:00] not have a chance to select the gifts
[1:40:02] that it wants the child can't even
[1:40:05] express appreciation for the things that
[1:40:08] is going to get a man child never even
[1:40:11] says thank you right but the people are
[1:40:14] so excited and it's mama a man and other
[1:40:17] mothers that are like her that want to
[1:40:19] try to make sure when that child comes
[1:40:21] into the world that it's got everything
[1:40:23] is supposed to have hallelujah I got a
[1:40:25] quota pair won't have time to read it
[1:40:27] but brother Branham say if your earthly
[1:40:29] parents will go through great extremes
[1:40:31] to make sure that you have everything
[1:40:33] you need when you come to earth your
[1:40:36] heavenly parents a man goes through
[1:40:39] greater extremes
[1:40:41] hallelujah somebody this is why he goes
[1:40:43] to prepare place for us
[1:40:45] amen we don't even get a chance to pick
[1:40:47] out
[1:40:48] cuz we don't we don't get a chance to
[1:40:53] say hi it's gonna be design right but
[1:40:55] but but here it is because he knows what
[1:40:58] we like na he's already made it that way
[1:41:01] he's already made preparation pour us a
[1:41:07] man and not only has he made preparation
[1:41:09] a man in the end for natural things but
[1:41:12] even in your body because he knows that
[1:41:16] he knows to buy things for you before
[1:41:57] you come before you can even appreciate
[1:42:00] them if your mama can think like that
[1:42:02] your heavenly parent thinks greener so
[1:42:08] the bible tells us that he's already
[1:42:10] desired this body for us it's already
[1:42:13] designed this body and you know I read
[1:42:16] that scripture and I'm gonna just call
[1:42:18] it another one here for you real quick
[1:42:19] this is just bless your heart when you
[1:42:21] you can get a chance to go back and read
[1:42:23] it a man I this is out of Matthew 18 and
[1:42:27] and 10 it says take heed that you
[1:42:32] despise take he that you despise not one
[1:42:36] of these little ones I said to you that
[1:42:38] in heaven their angels do always behold
[1:42:43] the face of my father which is in heaven
[1:42:45] and I like verse 11 as well for the Son
[1:42:48] of man has come to save that which was
[1:42:49] lost so here you know when we look at
[1:42:53] Matthew 18 10 when it's talking about
[1:42:55] their angels this is talking about their
[1:42:57] theophanies hallelujah so mama mama
[1:43:02] I'm gonna just put it like this the
[1:43:03] reason that you don't need to worry and
[1:43:06] you know mine your child got a theophany
[1:43:08] that came from God can I tell you the
[1:43:14] reason you need to work because it's
[1:43:15] going back to God I don't care whether
[1:43:18] yet I don't care what they've done if
[1:43:20] they got a theophany that came from God
[1:43:22] it's going back to God my brother Billy
[1:43:25] Paul was saying daddy I don't understand
[1:43:27] what just happened
[1:43:28] you never pray for this man all you did
[1:43:31] is come out and say praise the Lord and
[1:43:33] the man said hallelujah and he smiled
[1:43:35] and walked away
[1:43:36] and it was just waving his hand to
[1:43:39] dinner I don't understand what just
[1:43:40] happened here so so brother and say
[1:43:42] Billy you want to know the reason that I
[1:43:44] couldn't come to you he said you know
[1:43:46] when I saw the man that we're not there
[1:43:48] to shake his hand everything he would
[1:43:50] shake my hand I realized that I could
[1:43:52] not help that man there was nothing that
[1:43:55] I could do hallelujah to help that man
[1:43:59] he was that bad off there was nothing I
[1:44:01] could do so what I had to do was come in
[1:44:03] here and start praying and when I start
[1:44:06] praying I went before the throne of God
[1:44:09] and I went looking for his theophany
[1:44:16] when I went to heaven and I was
[1:44:20] searching around heaven looking for the
[1:44:22] master Diop aney Amen and when I run
[1:44:26] into this when I ran to that one and it
[1:44:27] was of him he said and I couldn't I
[1:44:30] couldn't find him st often it just took
[1:44:32] me I realized if he did not have a
[1:44:35] theophany then there would be no hope
[1:44:37] for him here
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:40] no hopeful how do we he say bad after
[1:44:45] now so found his dear Fanny and when I
[1:44:48] found a theophany I went up and I said
[1:44:51] praise the Lord and his fearfully said
[1:44:54] hallelujah he said so I took his
[1:45:03] theophany
[1:45:05] Oh
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:12] it's just like a cell phone that got
[1:46:15] depleted and all they need to do is get
[1:46:18] plugged in that's why the man was sad
[1:46:22] he'd miss be to be plugged in he got a
[1:46:26] charge from his theophany that other
[1:46:30] body that was waiting for him and when
[1:46:33] he got his charge what happened with you
[1:46:35] when you get your charger yourself huh
[1:46:37] take it off the child just keep going
[1:46:39] you never pray for it you just you
[1:46:48] charged it and kept going
[1:46:50] so mama today maybe you need a charge
[1:46:53] maybe your children need a charge and we
[1:46:56] prayed it they're here from a theophany
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:09] that could take us into those rooms and
[1:47:13] by taking somebody into that room now he
[1:47:15] never explained it to those other people
[1:47:16] what happened he never explained to the
[1:47:19] man what happened
[1:47:20] he never explained to the the wife or
[1:47:22] the pastor they might not have been able
[1:47:24] to receive it right
[1:47:26] Coop's say that to me just say praise
[1:47:28] the Lord hallelujah all right god bless
[1:47:30] you but Billy power can understand these
[1:47:34] things and then that's why I read these
[1:47:38] scriptures to put it back in there so
[1:47:41] that you understand what's going on
[1:47:43] according to the word there are angels
[1:47:45] brother Branham actually explains
[1:47:47] Matthew 18 10 I don't have time to read
[1:47:50] all this but I'm gonna tell you where to
[1:47:51] find him and your co D book or questions
[1:47:55] and answers book you find a
[1:47:56] questionnaire where brother Branham is
[1:47:58] explained in Matthew 18 10 now and when
[1:48:00] he goes explained he says now there's
[1:48:02] there's kind of two ways that you any
[1:48:03] ties Matthew 1810 to 2nd Corinthians 5
[1:48:06] and one a man if this earthly earthly
[1:48:09] tavern that could be dissolved
[1:48:10] I'll read a little bit of that alright
[1:48:12] let's just read a little bit of that I
[1:48:14] think it'll help y'all a date a man I
[1:48:16] won't read the rest of everything
[1:48:18] but I read this at least he says that
[1:48:23] you despise not one of these little ones
[1:48:27] while standing you that in heaven their
[1:48:28] angels do always behold the face of the
[1:48:31] Father which is in heaven this is all
[1:48:34] right now but brother whoever who you
[1:48:36] are of course there's no names just
[1:48:38] little tickets you see who said I'm sure
[1:48:40] they were after him actually proper to
[1:48:42] explain Matthew 18 10 says now you could
[1:48:44] take two ways of it two ways of it he
[1:48:49] says you see but I think the
[1:48:51] interpretation if you just asked me
[1:48:52] explain this the way I interpret this is
[1:48:54] this look at this the way I interpret
[1:48:58] this the Prophet is telling you I told
[1:49:01] you can go with the prophetic definition
[1:49:04] or you can go with a man of theologians
[1:49:06] definition I choose to take profit you
[1:49:13] can take two ways of you see but I think
[1:49:15] the interpretation if you just ask me
[1:49:17] explain this the way I interpret this is
[1:49:19] this now you turn to 2nd 2nd corinthians
[1:49:21] somebody 5-6 in this earthly tavern I
[1:49:24] could be dissolved you know what it is
[1:49:26] if this herbal attack our earthly tab
[1:49:28] and I could be dissolved we have one
[1:49:29] already you know waiting alright now if
[1:49:32] you notice in Matthew 18 10 he was
[1:49:35] speaking about taking little children
[1:49:37] they was little children little tops 3
[1:49:39] or 4 years old
[1:49:41] picked them up so when we talk about
[1:49:42] Matthew 18 10 a man we might we might be
[1:49:45] looking at it well you know there
[1:49:46] because brother branham people talked
[1:49:47] about how no Billy Paul talked about how
[1:49:50] one time he they were answering letters
[1:49:52] from from his dad other mail and they
[1:49:54] were answering the letters and answer
[1:49:56] the letters and and and and his little
[1:49:58] son just kept interrupting him and his
[1:50:00] daddy answered no less and any say now
[1:50:02] he's saying I'm certain you gonna have
[1:50:03] to leave us alone we're doing this now
[1:50:05] you got to leave us alone so he go away
[1:50:07] and come back and he start bothering me
[1:50:08] and he say something I told you you
[1:50:10] gonna have to leave us alone right so I
[1:50:12] think the third time is little boy
[1:50:13] coming there again and interrupt them
[1:50:15] from answering them letters and and I he
[1:50:17] said ev'ry so and he smacked him real
[1:50:19] good and then he say he's sitting on
[1:50:21] that from sitting out the room so
[1:50:23] brother branham told Billy Paul you say
[1:50:26] son I know you're trying to correct you
[1:50:29] a little winning and you have
[1:50:30] right to do that he say but when you hit
[1:50:33] him that time you actually hit his angel
[1:50:40] you hit his angel a man when you spanked
[1:50:44] him that time because he hit him out of
[1:50:46] anger it's one thing to correct your
[1:50:50] child but it's another thing to do it
[1:50:51] out of anger hallelujah amen so so he
[1:50:56] say you you actually hit the angel that
[1:50:58] time things you didn't like that
[1:51:01] hallelujah could it be that we're in
[1:51:04] some of the situation's we in because we
[1:51:06] actually hit the angel could it be so
[1:51:13] maybe rather than just apologizing to
[1:51:15] the child go back to that angel that
[1:51:18] theophany body I'm sorry I hit you -
[1:51:27] Amen church you hit the angel because
[1:51:34] you did it out of anger any man right so
[1:51:40] so so brother Brad we have to tell them
[1:51:41] that is like okay you know that humble
[1:51:43] himself down and and Lord I'm sorry I
[1:51:45] should've did it like that and even as a
[1:51:48] parent you learn how to chest out just
[1:51:51] as you're a man praise God
[1:51:55] a man you just don't pick up everything
[1:51:57] and anything and go after angel with
[1:52:01] them you just can't say anything to it
[1:52:06] there's an angel with them
[1:52:09] hallelujah you don't want just to angel
[1:52:12] watching over them when they when they
[1:52:13] out in the trouble you know that angel
[1:52:15] ordered capital round about them that
[1:52:17] fear let me go home it says now if you
[1:52:54] notice in Matthew 18 he was speaking
[1:52:56] about taking little children they was
[1:52:57] little children little tots three or
[1:52:58] four years old picked them up
[1:53:00] they brought them brought unto Him
[1:53:02] children children comes from the name of
[1:53:05] child a child is just a little fella not
[1:53:07] an infant but just between that and a
[1:53:09] teenager it's not responsible yet for
[1:53:12] itself hey man now he said take heed
[1:53:15] that you don't despise if you really
[1:53:17] take the interpretation of that word is
[1:53:19] miss treat don't mistreat God help us
[1:53:30] all
[1:53:31] don't miss treat sometimes that's hard
[1:53:37] thing not to do but the Bible tells you
[1:53:40] not to do it
[1:53:41] don't miss treat listen to miss treat
[1:53:44] one of those mistreat a child you should
[1:53:46] never do that they're children they
[1:53:48] don't know see and and now notice
[1:53:51] because they're angels always behold my
[1:53:55] father's face face which is in heaven
[1:53:57] you see in other words they're angels
[1:54:00] their messengers their bodies angelic
[1:54:05] bodies that they'll go to if they die
[1:54:09] are always before my father's face in
[1:54:13] heaven see he says now if this earthly
[1:54:17] Tabernacle be dissolved we have when
[1:54:20] ready waiting is that right that's a
[1:54:21] body look here if I just had time to go
[1:54:24] through these course I know I'm not
[1:54:26] going to have it but here let me just
[1:54:29] give it up to you so it's on tape and
[1:54:31] you give it anyhow look now this is the
[1:54:33] other angle he said now cuz we just
[1:54:34] can't look at it as just a child
[1:54:37] a man I just told you this brother was
[1:54:39] sad and he got a charge of his
[1:54:41] Theophilus so that angel starts with you
[1:54:43] as a child but it stays with you all
[1:54:45] through your life because now he's gonna
[1:54:48] pick up Peter now watch this he says
[1:54:51] look one night Peter was in prison they
[1:54:54] had a prayer meeting down at John marks
[1:54:56] house see and so the angel of the Lord
[1:54:58] come in that pillow that that pillow
[1:55:00] pillow fire a light come down and Peter
[1:55:03] thought he was dreaming when he seen
[1:55:05] this light come to him the Bible said it
[1:55:07] was it was a lion see and I believe it's
[1:55:10] the same one with us see he come down
[1:55:12] and we get in the same trouble maybe the
[1:55:15] same thing with happen see and coming
[1:55:17] here and so he said come go with me
[1:55:20] so Peter thought I'm dreaming now so
[1:55:23] I'll just see what this dream means so
[1:55:25] he walked right on by the guards and
[1:55:26] thought huh now we going by the door
[1:55:29] just open by itself went out the next
[1:55:31] door open by itself went through the
[1:55:33] city gates it opened myself and he still
[1:55:35] thought he was dreaming so then so when
[1:55:38] he stood up there said well I'm free so
[1:55:40] I'll just go down to John Mark's house
[1:55:41] and have some fellowship they way they
[1:55:46] was back there Oh Lord send your angel
[1:55:49] deliver Peter now this is their praying
[1:55:51] deliverer Peter and about that time
[1:55:53] something with the little dancer went to
[1:55:58] the door and said who's there raised up
[1:56:01] the little lattice said why is Peter so
[1:56:04] he went back I mean she went back say
[1:56:06] hey you can stop praying my penis here
[1:56:09] oh my god I like that ain't man I can't
[1:56:13] I can't wait we can start praying in
[1:56:15] here
[1:56:18] [Applause]
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:29] listen he says that opener
[1:56:33] no no says a penis here they said oh my
[1:56:36] go ahead say your your your see said
[1:56:38] said open up I'm coming in so it said
[1:56:40] sorry went back said no it's Peter at
[1:56:42] the door oh they said now this is what
[1:56:45] they said they cut his head off already
[1:56:48] and that's his angel so as angel must
[1:56:51] look like you
[1:56:53] that's his angel at the door see yes oh
[1:56:57] my god you ought to be able to catch by
[1:57:01] vision your child's angel is in the
[1:57:05] presence of the Lord worshiping yes and
[1:57:07] if their angel is there that's the
[1:57:10] positive the positive has to connect
[1:57:12] with the negative one time they've got
[1:57:18] to come together and if I see it in a
[1:57:20] positive a man I'm gonna see it also
[1:57:22] here in the negative
[1:57:23] oh my god he says that's his angel adore
[1:57:29] see his heavenly tabernacle he done
[1:57:32] received it if this earthly one was
[1:57:34] dissolved because it was waiting in
[1:57:36] heaven for him to come to Lord this is
[1:57:39] alright for me what I've seen the other
[1:57:42] day in that vision you know crossed over
[1:57:43] if earth if this earthly time and I
[1:57:45] could be dissolved we have one and these
[1:57:48] little fellows felt our fellows whose
[1:57:50] done done no sin as yet you see you see
[1:57:53] okay just let me read this last
[1:57:55] paragraph from that when a baby is being
[1:57:58] formed in a womb of a mother soon as
[1:58:00] it's put there see but first it's a
[1:58:03] spirit as that spirit begins to take on
[1:58:06] flesh that's a powerful statement I wish
[1:58:08] I could just reach that right there
[1:58:09] before the mama conceives it's a spirit
[1:58:14] and do you realize that spirit have to
[1:58:17] find a womb that it could come through
[1:58:20] and God elected God predestiny
[1:58:25] that you would come through the womb of
[1:58:27] your mama but first you are spirit see
[1:58:31] you came from
[1:58:33] God and if you came from God then you
[1:58:37] have to go back to God you cannot be
[1:58:41] loss see Judas didn't come from God
[1:58:45] that's why he was lost but if you came
[1:58:48] from God even though you might be in a
[1:58:50] simple state right now if you came from
[1:58:53] God you're gonna get a charge one of
[1:58:55] these days yes from your feel funny you
[1:58:59] know sometimes you come to church and
[1:59:01] you don't even want to say Amen but it's
[1:59:03] something come maybe jump on your
[1:59:05] shoulder you don't feel like Santa man
[1:59:08] you don't fit you don't feel like even
[1:59:10] being here amen meet him wherever they
[1:59:41] are I think it was the prodigal son that
[1:59:45] got a charge to misty - right
[1:59:47] something told him say you don't need to
[1:59:48] be living like this go back to your
[1:59:51] daddy's house hallelujah and when they
[1:59:54] got there they celebrated a man a man a
[1:59:57] man a man a man all right let me go and
[2:00:00] let me try to finish this says it's
[2:00:04] first it's a spirit as that spirit began
[2:00:06] to take begins to take on flesh a little
[2:00:09] German life begins to take on flesh and
[2:00:11] as soon as it drops now in the womb it's
[2:00:15] a little quivering jerking muscles we
[2:00:17] know that that sales just like that like
[2:00:20] just just like you take a horsehair and
[2:00:22] put it in the water in a cap over in a
[2:00:25] move and you'll touch it and it'll jump
[2:00:27] that's the way a baby is but as soon as
[2:00:30] it's born in this world and breathes its
[2:00:33] first breath it becomes a living soul
[2:00:35] see because as soon
[2:00:38] the earthly body is born into the world
[2:00:40] there's a celestial body or a spiritual
[2:00:42] body to take ahold of it and as soon as
[2:00:45] this natural body drop there's a heavily
[2:00:48] Tabernacle waiting for it
[2:00:49] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[2:00:52] there's a heavenly tabernacle wait and
[2:00:55] forth just as soon as the baby is
[2:00:56] dropped into the earth and flesh there's
[2:00:58] a spiritual body waiting to receive it
[2:01:01] and as soon as that spiritual part of
[2:01:03] natural bodies dissolve there's a
[2:01:04] spiritual body waiting yonder a
[2:01:06] theophany we call it a theophany I like
[2:01:09] that brother branham said he had to go
[2:01:11] find the man Stephanie right I mean all
[2:01:15] the way to shake this sadness this man
[2:01:17] was so down he said I couldn't even
[2:01:21] shake his hand and nothing that I can do
[2:01:23] with this man but the only way to shake
[2:01:24] his sadness that I had to go get his
[2:01:27] feet off in it now let me tell you
[2:01:28] something his theophany was not sad see
[2:01:36] Anthony was saying his theophany when he
[2:01:40] was greeted when the theophany was
[2:01:42] greeted praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:01:45] that's the theophanies response so he
[2:01:49] had the bring the man's theophany bring
[2:01:53] it back from heaven and put it right
[2:01:54] here next to say now praise the Lord
[2:01:56] hallelujah he don't even realize what
[2:01:59] happened he got a charge to misty - II
[2:02:02] never even got grateful all your
[2:02:05] children needs the charge of me
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:11] yeah God has given him a head that angel
[2:02:14] was there at birth and it goes all the
[2:02:15] way through life with it and when they
[2:02:17] get that charge mama you ain't got
[2:02:19] nothin to worry about daddy ain't got
[2:02:21] none to worry about they gonna get that
[2:02:23] charge glory to God see any what I just
[2:02:33] picked up the scripture you know just
[2:02:35] trying to tie these thoughts together
[2:02:36] but this woman that was that was about
[2:02:38] food they were it was a famine in the
[2:02:40] land she the Prophet was sent to her
[2:02:43] house and here come you know the Prophet
[2:02:46] to this woman's house and brother Graham
[2:02:48] said what a strange place for the man of
[2:02:50] God to go to a widow woman and he was
[2:02:53] already told to go to a certain lake or
[2:02:56] river and that he'd be sustained there
[2:02:58] but that river dried up that situation
[2:03:01] dried up and he had to move on to the
[2:03:03] next place and and he said go to the
[2:03:04] woman this widow at Zarephath and say
[2:03:07] say I've already ordained that she will
[2:03:09] sustain thee now this is what God says
[2:03:11] about her and when the Prophet goes into
[2:03:13] the city and he sees this woman and
[2:03:15] she's there picking up sticks and get
[2:03:17] feel the Spirit of God say that that's
[2:03:18] her just just just go to and just just
[2:03:20] you know just just talk to it it said
[2:03:22] ma'am would you please just get me some
[2:03:24] water
[2:03:24] now now now the prophet I mean God say
[2:03:28] that the woman was already prepared to
[2:03:29] sustain him but notice her response she
[2:03:32] say they say say would you give him some
[2:03:33] work she went running to go get the
[2:03:35] water but as she's on awake so she's
[2:03:37] already responding properly to what the
[2:03:39] Prophet acts and as she's on her way to
[2:03:41] get water he makes another request
[2:03:43] it's the if you don't mind also bring me
[2:03:46] a morsel of bread and this is where she
[2:03:49] says now wait a minute
[2:03:50] all I got is just enough a meant for me
[2:03:53] and my son
[2:03:54] that's all I got is just enough for me
[2:03:56] myself he said she said now I'm gonna
[2:03:58] get this glue I'm gonna make this little
[2:04:00] thing here and say me and him we gonna
[2:04:02] die after we eat this hallelujah but see
[2:04:06] here's what God knew that that woman
[2:04:08] amen was gonna be obedient after she got
[2:04:12] a little charge from the Word of God
[2:04:14] hallelujah so he said
[2:04:34] Oh someday children but you gotta I know
[2:05:11] they got needs but they need to come to
[2:05:26] this church
[2:05:28] [Applause]
[2:05:31] my children I have to tell my kids a
[2:05:36] long time ago I love God more than I
[2:05:38] love you I love you if you ever put me
[2:05:44] in a position I want you to know the
[2:06:03] woman said me and my son is about to die
[2:06:05] I'm gonna do this for him I mean he's
[2:06:08] gonna die so I would do this for him
[2:06:10] first he said no no make me a cake first
[2:06:12] and I guarantee if you do it the way God
[2:06:16] told you to do it your cruse of oil will
[2:06:22] not run empty and your barrel of meal
[2:06:28] will not go dry she went in and just
[2:06:32] scooped up the last bit and baked a cake
[2:06:34] for the profit in ticket talk and he
[2:06:37] said now bake me one first and then bake
[2:06:39] one for your son so when she come out
[2:06:41] head and I see no she don't
[2:06:43] Richard ain't got the last but she was
[2:06:45] obedient and she got her last and gave
[2:06:48] it to God i'ma just see your kids might
[2:06:58] have needs but you don't take your tithe
[2:07:01] money to supply they need God understand
[2:07:08] God understand that you just put your
[2:07:10] child in front of him hey man you don't
[2:07:15] take your tithes and offering and give
[2:07:17] that to your kids and say God understand
[2:07:19] all that belong to God
[2:07:21] babe got his cake first hear hear hear
[2:07:26] hear say Knight wasn't right when you
[2:07:27] bake my cake then you go back and you
[2:07:30] gonna see it's gonna be some some meal
[2:07:31] there for you it's gonna be some order
[2:07:33] for you sir now that lady know she just
[2:07:35] used her last but by faith she did
[2:07:37] exactly what the prop said and when she
[2:07:39] went back that barrel had some not
[2:07:41] knowing God he didn't fill it all the
[2:07:44] way up
[2:07:45] it was just enough to keep up coming
[2:07:48] back it just enough just to keep up
[2:07:55] coming back just so you have to continue
[2:07:58] to depend on him you know she just kid
[2:07:59] enough for this meal go back the next
[2:08:01] day so enough for the next meal go back
[2:08:03] the next day it's enough for the next
[2:08:04] meal hallelujah but she did what God
[2:08:08] acts her to do first hallelujah
[2:08:14] that woman received a promise and that
[2:08:17] and I believe one other things that this
[2:08:19] woman in the midst of this great drought
[2:08:21] that she was in one of the things that
[2:08:24] really set her apart from everybody else
[2:08:27] they probably gave her an assurance that
[2:08:30] gave her a peace is when she heard thus
[2:08:34] saith the Lord and I want to tell you
[2:08:38] when you got a bus say that the Lord it
[2:08:39] changes everything in your life as I was
[2:08:43] reading I say Lord I just wish we had
[2:08:45] people that we could depend on that
[2:08:48] could say thus saith the Lord to our
[2:08:50] situations not circumstances amen we
[2:08:53] might not have nobody directly like like
[2:08:55] God's prophet but we got the word right
[2:08:58] and just some of the testimonies that we
[2:09:00] share ought to be of thus saith the Lord
[2:09:01] enough for you to know you ain't got to
[2:09:04] worry no need to worry no need to worry
[2:09:08] I don't care what they conditions like

[2:15:54] paragraph 87 just if y'all ever come to
[2:15:58] church on Mother's Day and I'm preaching

[2:16:00] every time I just love it I love it then
[2:16:06] as we see him we would not be as we are
[2:16:10] now well know how to love him more will
[2:16:14] not stand back with a little fear
[2:16:15] because we'll be like him well he will
[2:16:18] be more of a relative relative to us
[2:16:21] than he is now
[2:16:23] we'll understand him better because
[2:16:24] we're so far away in the mortal bodies
[2:16:26] and we'll have a body like his glorious
[2:16:29] bodies we know how to worship Him and
[2:16:31] when we see what the presence of his
[2:16:34] being has done to us changed us the old
[2:16:36] back young all the deform Street now
[2:16:39] Oh we'll understand then why his power
[2:16:41] healed us the questions that's been in
[2:16:45] our mind how can he do it what with this
[2:16:47] somehow mysteriously they'll they'll all
[2:16:50] fade away the knots that's been tied in
[2:16:53] the back of our minds will it be this
[2:16:55] could it be somehow another majestic
[2:16:58] fingers
[2:16:58] we're just untangle unravel those knots
[2:17:02] and it all fade into the one big crown
[2:17:06] of love and you know I'm under I'm under
[2:17:09] expectation for that I know some of
[2:17:10] y'all mothers y'all want to see our
[2:17:11] children right now serving God but one
[2:17:14] day those those those those majestic
[2:17:16] things
[2:17:17] not they'll get a charge from the
[2:17:19] theophany hallelujah
[2:17:22] I want to skip down the paragraph 93
[2:17:24] says if you're a little weak link that
[2:17:27] has separated this great family reunion
[2:17:30] at that date now now before it before I
[2:17:34] give you that quote just leave it there
[2:17:36] is talk about how mama loves loved it
[2:17:42] when all the kids grow up and they leave
[2:17:44] home mama looks forward to moments where
[2:17:47] she can have family dinner and bring all
[2:17:50] the kids back around the table and it's
[2:17:54] just something about having the kids
[2:17:55] home again but a lot of times when they
[2:17:57] come home they're not coming home body
[2:17:59] itself they're coming home with some
[2:18:00] with some old people they got their own
[2:18:02] little families they got mates they got
[2:18:04] all of this then they bring them back
[2:18:05] but nonetheless mama liked to have a
[2:18:07] chair for everybody and a plate for
[2:18:09] everybody praise the Lord
[2:18:11] amen sososo and when mama gets to
[2:18:15] feeling that way what you want to have
[2:18:16] the kids home make sure get daddy on the
[2:18:18] phone call and make sure that they
[2:18:19] coming make sure they come make sure
[2:18:21] they're gonna be because dinner will not
[2:18:23] be the same if one child is missing
[2:18:28] hallelujah now if you feel that way
[2:18:30] about earthly dinner how do you think
[2:18:34] God feel about a heavenly dinner right
[2:18:38] hallelujah
[2:18:39] heaven won't be the same if one child is
[2:18:44] missing somehow someway they're gonna
[2:18:48] get a charge from a theophany if you are
[2:18:52] that little weak link that has separated
[2:18:54] this great family reunion at that pain
[2:18:57] may the God of heaven this morning
[2:18:59] somehow in a mysterious way unravel
[2:19:01] those little knots that's tired of your
[2:19:03] mind and reveal to you the love that he
[2:19:06] has for you may you come sweetly to
[2:19:09] serve Him while we think on these things
[2:19:11] let's pray just before we pray and you
[2:19:14] have your heads bowed I'm gonna ask you
[2:19:15] on this Mother's Day to rededicate your
[2:19:19] lives anew to him looking forward for
[2:19:21] that resurrection and the Prophet acts
[2:19:24] would you raise your hand to him while
[2:19:27] everyone says God bless you and he says
[2:19:29] you know just raise your hand
[2:19:31] on this Mother's Day it's one thing amen
[2:19:34] the Lord I'm coming to church and I want
[2:19:36] to be there for mama but let's do
