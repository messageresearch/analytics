hallelujah glory to god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you can be seated in the presence of the lord amen man i was just thinking on that a little early and just blessed my heart when i heard brother fuhrman said i want to do that again tonight and god bless you all praise the lord uh i think we may have a couple announcements that i probably want to make mention of amen and um i did want to especially welcome um the saints in a husky uh north carolina my brother larry called me a little earlier to today and said brother we are going to the church and we're going to ask some young people to come and we're going to stream the service from a husky and uh we want to welcome them amen tonight amen and fellowship here with us praise the lord and um i know that there are other saints that are streaming amen from the various places and and i mentioned typically we do this youth service is something that um we combine with a number of churches here in the area and man i tell you this covet has changed so much um uh our you know our desire is just to try to keep the young people encouraged and and uh you know but we were not able to just bring everybody together we just didn't want to um fall out of line with the social distancing so we trust that some of the young people have been able to join us either on facebook or on periscope and um uh we we certainly pray that the lord will bless you amen right where you are amen certainly trusting god just to meet us all in a very special way on tonight amen i have any uh quick announcements i need to make okay so um just uh want to make mention a man um uh for uh tomorrow i i i first of all i want to say thank you for our guests that are here remember the nathan and many of the precious brothers that have come from churchill uh of the open door there in new albany uh indiana remember nathan is coming with stephen and then he'll be speaking for us in the morning amen thank god for brother luke and then brother jonathan brother fuhrman and also the speaker of tonight brother aaron amen will be here speaking for us on tonight and um you know just just good to have them and fellowship and so we had this service that we wanted to put together then we've been streaming uh i mean during our nine o'clock and 12 o'clock service since the covet thing and it just worked out really really nice for us to to get all the ministers the way that we kind of talked about it but tomorrow at 12 that service will be dedicated to praying for the sick amen it'll be praying for the sick many times the lord has allowed brother nathan to pass through this way and there's been many supernatural things that have taken place uh here in our church we are witnesses of god uh doing the supernatural here so we uh when we were planning things i just didn't know how we'd be able to do it but we have a few saints a man that'll be here present those that will want to go through the prayer line and here in the service we're going to have a prayer line for you but we'll also be doing a hybrid um where we have a virtual prayer line we have received a number of requests and those that have not submitted requests if you desire to do so reach out to us we'll give you the link of how you can submit your request but we believe in god that he'll touch you right where you are we're standing on the scripture where the centurion told the lord jesus say i'm not worthy that you should come underneath my roof and then he told jesus say if he says i'm a man of authority and and uh and and you know i realized that i speak and i i tell this one to come he comes i tell that but ago he goes and whatever i actually do they do because i'm a man of authority says and i realize you have that same type of power it says if you just speak the word only i know my servant will be made whole so jesus never went to the man's house jesus never laid hands on his servant but he did speak the word and the man was made whole i believe that same power exists today so as the word of god is being preached your faith is being elevated amen the word of the prayer of faith will be prayed for you and we're believing god for your healing wherever you are whatever your need we're believing god that he will touch you so we're looking forward to that on tomorrow amen so keep that uh keep that in mind keep those services in prayer amen praise the lord all right uh so praise the lord uh as far as giving we do have the ability for people to give online and man we have uh both cash app and we have paypal

offering in that wooden box as you're leaving amen on on tonight praise the lord and um so i want to just pray over it before we just mention paypal if you're giving through paypal make sure you

thank you for how you've blessed us lord and uh we just trust you dear god that you would just use it for the furthest of your kingdom uh meet every need god that your people would have to meet the needs that the church would have even during this pandemic you have proven that you are still jehovah jireh that doesn't limit you so we thank you father for manifesting yourself over and over again to us we appreciate all that you do oh god we love you and we praise you and just pray lord you bless this portion of the service as well it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen uh thank god for all those that were able to come out tonight amen see uh shanice amen good to see you tonight god bless you god bless you amen one of the daughters of the house we thank god for her um we um we're really really blessed amen tonight i was telling um brother nathan a man um years ago he used to come alone a man here and we would just set up services and we'd go from church to church and he would preach and we did the same thing with brother trevor uh different times and they just go from church to church and we were preaching and um you know then the lord uh kind of changed his ministry and moved him from being an evangelist to a pastor a man and and uh and now i think we were he was going back over the numbers and he said it's been 19 years uh that we have been fellowshipping one with the other and and uh you know and just just over those years god has just done so much and with the church that he has there now and and i was just blessed that uh he he came this time not just by himself but he brought other ministry help with and uh that just blesses my heart to just see how the lord has just brought fruit out of the ministry there and uh and we're just we're just grateful that uh he came and and we're we're under expectation for all the brothers that'll be speaking amen this weekend uh but tonight amen uh for this youth service we asked uh one of the brothers there in his church brother aaron mugo amen if he would come and just minister to our hearts and and i believe god's going to use them in a very special way and uh and i'm i'm on the expectation i also forgot to mention brother ariel and good to have you with us a man uh from minnesota amen good to have you with us brother ariel god bless you amen i'd like to see you get in amen where you'd fit in so god bless you my brother um so we want to uh just stand to our feet this this mic is clipping on me if i can just maybe lower it a little bit um we want to just sing a little bit of this song and we will welcome my brother amen aaron uh to the pulpit tonight and trust in the lord that he will use them in a very special way when i think of the lord and how he saved me how he raised me it makes me want to shout amen let's sing a little bit of this when i think about the lord and how he saved me and how he raised me how he filled me with the holy ghost how he heals me to the uttermost when i think about the lord how he picked me up turned me around placed my feet yes he did on solid ground oh it makes me wanna shout hallelujah thank you jesus lord you're worthy of all the glory all the honor all the praise well it makes me want to shout [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus lord you're worthy of all the glory all the honor all the praise well it makes me want to shout oh [Music] thank you jesus lord you're worthy yes you are [Music] oh [Music] it makes me wanna shout [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus lord you're worthy of all the glory all the honor in all the praises amen [Applause] i thank you musicians um may return to your seats if you don't mind let's go straight into a word of prayer lord we're very grateful to come here for this wonderful opportunity to come before you lord and hear the words from your lips lord it's nothing that we could do that could bring it here lord we it's just something at your well that we come to drink from something that will minister to our hearts lord we thank you for that thirsty put inside of us in order to want to come back time and time again lord we ask that you please anoint these services lord lord it would be worthless without you and we recognize that we ask that you be with us now and help us to pull as best as we can here or far lord wherever we are we need you in jesus name i ask and pray amen all right it's great to be here it's been a long trip coming down here and i've just really been excited the entire to cut the entire time to come and minister uh such a wonderful blessing i'm not sure how many people are out there in radio land or wherever but i'm just happy to be here um you know that song that you were just singing brother jack i just loved that song i i heard it for the first time when we were brother danny's this week it was just a blessing i took a picture of the lyrics and i didn't know how to sing it but i'll be able to go back and hear it this time i just love it it's amazing we ask that god gets all the glory and all the honor amen all right if you turn with me to genesis 3 6. that's genesis 3 verse 6. it reads and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes in a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat he exceeded thank you actually you know i'm hoping that everybody here is coming expecting not because it's me but i find that when we have a lot of meetings in a row like this that uh that god tends to bless more and more as each meeting goes on so if you set the bar high with your expectation and you get a lot out of the first service not because it's me or anything if you set the bar high it'll just keep building time and time again by the end of this i bet it's going to be a blessing for everybody amen so in genesis you can see everybody's familiar with this story uh eve goes and picks of the bad fruit you know and i want you to notice in this scripture it says when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes now you you want to notice here that it catches her senses first you know because the devil knows he can't attack you and go straight for your soul your soul is where you make that decision faith or doubt correct now but she but the devil actually has to use the outward appearance of a person anything that god uses in our mortal bodies to contact this realm he the devil's going to use those senses of ours to get to the inside you know and you can anticipate that he's going to always attack that way now she takes these uh yeah what did you say and a tree to be desired to make one wise so there was some desire in her heart to become wiser you know and uh there's always a motive the devil will always always try to use something to convince you whenever he's giving you something wrong it'll sound mostly right but then it'll actually have one tiny little bit of something that's just wrong amen yeah it will attract you it won't be ugly it won't taste bad it won't look bad it won't smell bad there's nothing wrong with it to the mortal body right but if you have to actually look beyond that because the devil's got it's got some little bit of poison in there all right now i want i want to mention something also there's a difference because after she after she takes of this fruit she decides to share it right most people who partake of something whether it's good or bad they're going to go out there and they're going to share it one way or another with the people that they love you know of the people that they think will accept or who actually need what they have to give them right but there's also another thing you want to notice there's two things there's two different ways that they could share something if it's a good thing such as these meetings the number of people here doesn't match the number of people actually watching because somebody here had to have shared it they knew there was a good thing happening this weekend and they went out there and they shared it online i don't know if it was social media or something word of mouth but there is something here that's good and you went out and shared it you made it public made it known to everybody else and that's a good thing you know but there's also there's also that version of sharing things which is just not so good right whenever it's something that you know is wrong you're going to seek out find a way to share it in private you're going to pull the person to the side you notice eve he she loved um both god and adam her relationship with was with god and adam it was a triangle right but in this case she knew god had given the given the word he had given the commandment and he had the judgment you know and she loved both of them but she was only going to share this with adam she didn't wait till god was coming down in the cool of the evening to actually show it to everybody that means she knew there was something wrong with this fruit whether she took something or not i'm not here to preach on that fruit but but she knew it so she pulled and pulled adam to the side maybe behind the bushes and said here you know okay so there's a difference and it's all in the spirit in which it's given you know and you can usually recognize that brother brandon prince preached a message called convinced and concerned and he talks about the christian whenever they first get and is this going in and out it's good okay all right okay when a christian first gets born again they found something good and they know that they want there's some desire in their heart to want to share it with other people now that sharing it doesn't mean they're going to go out there and preach it to everybody they're not going to get on the street corners and start blasting their message or something like that but god will find some way to use that christian in one way or another to share it to share his gospel to to further the kingdom of god and that's that's what i see in convinced and concerned that's the way of sharing things now 1957 1950 in 1957 brother branham preaches a message called why is it so why is it that so many christians find it so hard to live the christian life and he says if we are used to eating small portions our stomach shrinks to that portion and if we eat much our stomach stretches to that and i think that we need some spiritual stretching and get much of the word can't be satisfied with just reading a little verse once in a while or something of that manner but stretching our spiritual gastronomics right you know in in that in that i can see christians they they're god puts that thirst in you but the difference with a christian is they know what fills it they know where to go the god will find a way to get them that that that to find a will find a way for them to fill that desire in their heart he's going to fill it he has it for you you know and that's that's an example of coming over here to these meetings here near afar finding a way you will find a way to listen to what god has for you you know and it takes a special kind of person to come back and i i it just amazes me how many times that people just come back for the word time and time again and it's like they could never get full there's just no way you could fill up on it you could get tired in your body but your soul and your spirit always desires that if you have the proper spirit inside of you yes so this word i want to latch onto that phrase spiritual gastronomics and that's actually my title um that's actually my title but uh i wanted to i actually looked online for a definition of gastronomics and i've never actually heard that word outside of the message and i couldn't find a note a place online to actually say hey um gastronomics was used anywhere so i would i would attribute it to the way brother branham spoke however i found a definition for the word gastronomy and that is from dictionary.com it says the art or science of good eating it also that's the first definition also it says a style of cooking or eating and you know he uses this phrase 17 or 18 times in the message depending on how you search but uh you know you probably overlook it he usually uses it in the context of if it don't make you sick it won't do you no good you know and something going down your stomach but i tend to believe that people feed spiritually and naturally the exact same way or they can they tend to also depending on their culture you know and uh i i i started looking at it that way and it actually made a lot of sense however i know that i'm african for some background and i'm not trying to make anybody uncomfortable in here if you are not from a foreign country and you came and you're american and everything that's fine i'm not touching and talking about the natural here i'm talking about the spiritual i'm going to use a lot of natural parallels but there's nothing to do with the like just try to be spiritual about it this is a this is a lesson where you can be as spiritually as you want to be and you won't go too far you're fine okay i'm not going to preach on the f word the fact okay i'm not going to preach on that um okay so all right i hope she has the pictures ready okay so inspiration 1956 he says as science can only go far then it goes so far then it falls back we got unpacked resources by a divine promise from none other than the son of god saying whatsoever you ask the father in my name i'll do it he said i feel religious right now to think of that all things are possible to them that believe he says god i've got enough faith for for the sick now god give me enough faith for something else i'm hungry my gastronomics is swelling out i want more of god now in this it just sounds greedy right if you substitute any word in there for the word god it sounds like he's being greedy if i said um money i've got enough money for the sick now got money give me enough faith for something else i'm hungry my gastronomics is i want more money that just sounds wrong right but i can tend to say that it's not greedy to want more of god you just want more you just seek more time and time again and that's totally he put that thirst in you in the first place he's there to fulfill it it's like you know if i'm gonna be on is god was like apple pie and you're at the dinner table with your family and everything what would you do if somebody if there were 16 slices of apple pie and there were 16 people there at the dinner table what would you do if somebody said they didn't want their slice you say you take it hallelujah right now god if god was that apple pie you said you take it look i invite people to these meetings all the time and guess what they don't show up or they just sit there they don't say man they don't do a single thing i'll take what they're not taking because i'm gonna pull for myself that's for me i don't care what they do all right god give it to me i'm gonna be greedy about it all of his gifts amen all right um isaiah 28 verse nine it says whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall we make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line here a little and there a little now if you look at this verse 10 precept must be upon precept i i i tend to look at that as having a balance in the scriptures you know it can't be leaning one way or another it has to be as accurate as the way god wanted to reveal it to you correct now he says for with standard stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear and that means if you want more rest you can only find that in the scriptures it can only be found there you have to open yourself up to the word and let him fill you with what you actually have to go and seek out the word you know you can't look for other things to fill that void that he put inside of you that's the only way all right now um if you if you want to think of it in terms of the diet uh d sister could you put up the second picture please the second picture second if you want to think of it in terms of a diet then this is a picture that we've all seen in school and uh it's in elementary school and they teach you that in order to have a proper diet you need to have all of these things in a day correct in all these servings and all these portion sizes that you see on the right now spiritually speaking you know there are so many things in the word that you need to have but if you are missing something here in the or you have it in the wrong proportion in the wrong place then there's something wrong something if you if you come over here and you try to cut this um cut this in the natural and you get all of this out of here what is that called it's uh if you cut this out and cut that up there it's called a keto diet right basically and if you go with only natural versions of these things and skip all the processed stuff at the top it's a paleo diet at least that's my understanding but you can cut things and get different kind of diets out of this but it wouldn't be that it would be different you can also come over here and change the serving sizes and if you take all the sweets down here and you make it big then it's going to be the fat diet you're just going to get fat right that's exactly what's going to happen if you take all the meat out of there i don't really know what happens if you do that if you don't eat protein i don't know if you get kwashiorkor you will get a disease there is something wrong if you upset the balance there right correct now spiritually speaking you want to get everything in that diet inside of you right if you could give me the third picture please sister you want to get everything row by throw going up from the bottom to the top now you can't jump over here and skip this can you hello brother can anybody do that if anyone's read that scripture right it says add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge you're adding one to the other going to the very top right and that's your end goal up here you want to get that perfect love but you can't do that unless you actually feed on the scripture unless you feed and it's it's not just about diet it's not just about eating it's about exercise too you have to actually exercise your faith in whatever he gives you if you don't exercise your faith then it's just intellectual there's nothing there's nothing coming of it and it's just gonna sit there inside of you guess what you'll be spiritually fat because you're not exercising you're not burning it you're not using it for anything there's constant buildup of carbs so you're trying to get each one of these things in in order to get to the top i hope you're trying because every christian has that true desire in his heart there's a purpose to it there's you know character is a victory if you read the church age book you have to actually work for it it won't be given to you even whenever you're feeding on the word it actually has to you have to open yourself up to it and act on it too you can't just sit on it and there are whenever i looked up could you show the second picture please sister tina whenever i looked it up you know i was expecting you know i googled i was looking for a picture of this food pyramid and i googled it and i was just like oh this is easy you know type food pyramid and google images easy right i came up with so many different kinds of pyramid just by googling it just like that and it's totally different from what i was looking for in elementary school totally different there was the keto pillow pyramid there was like the paleo pyramid there was a mediterranean food pyramid and i was like where did these come from you know i want the actual true pyramid i want to know that i want that actual true word that's actually balanced i don't want someone to come over here and mix it for me some of them didn't even look like pyramids they were cut down this way instead of the other way you can't cut it out of there you have to leave it exactly the way it is that's the way i want it and that's the way god gave it to us you know okay amen that's great all right uh you can take wait actually i thought of another thing if you think of it in the other pyramid you gotta you can you can you can take in anything in your life and it might look like a good thing or a bad thing it might actually be a good thing you can put things ahead of god that you should not put ahead of god and you just start feeding on them it could be something as easy as sports or you know pg-13 movies who cares right there's just pg-13 movies um it could be something it could be your people you love it could be your wife your kids it could be false doctrines it could be real doctrines if you keep feeding on the wrong thing and not the wrong thing they they look good it appeals to your senses in one way or another it looks good but too much of a bad of a good thing like i said this is good there is nothing wrong with that but it's all about serving size and moderation you got to put god first i say you can you can put anything on here uh whatever your pyramid is whatever is important to you you can build a pyramid of your life of what's important to you but you as long as you have god down here as your little cornerstone and build it on there it's fine you know if you can do it in god's name whatever you do in god's name it's like look i wanna i wanna listen to sports but i know i have to have god first that's the first stone and then i'm gonna i'm gonna watch sports but that's fine god's first and then i get to the sports it's fine have a solid foundation i don't know put the important things here and build up to have your family here but then have sports up there it doesn't matter what it is if it's sports or if it's it's whatever it is just make sure god is down there at the bottom and he's your foundation otherwise it's not going to go anywhere your pyramid's going to topple all right hebrews chapter 5 11-14 of whom we have many things to say and heart to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when that for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat you know paul he has this theme that he's going over and it's sort of a reference to isaiah 28 where he's talking about who he shall teach doctrine and everything it's those that are weaned from the breasts you know you have to be off of milk and move on to this to be able to move on to the stronger things paul's using that theme he also uses it in first corinthians chapter 3 i think and he's talking he was telling the corinthians that you know i wish i could teach you deep things but i cannot teach you deep things because i have to go over these basic things first you're not going to grow anywhere unless you actually cover the basics you know you have to actually want to be fed by this word you can't just ditch it and leave it it doesn't matter what walk of life you're at as a christian if if your experience was five years ago your first christian experience where you were born again and you didn't grow between there and there there's something wrong there's honestly something wrong and it can't be with god because god wants to give it to you one way or another there's something wrong you have to actually want it back to hebrews 5 13 he says for every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belong it to them that are of full age wait i'm looking for an example person could i borrow your son brother jose okay you know awesome nice to meet you come over here please stand right beside me right so in the natural at one point i was this size right and i didn't stay this size how old are you um 10 10 okay yeah i'm 25. so 15 years ago it would be acceptable to be this size right there's nothing unnatural about that at all there's nothing unnatural about that but somehow do you know how tall you are no not at all all right but somehow i think i've got about two feet on them right somehow two feet happened did it happen overnight did i stay this way 15 years ago something changed right i had to do something what on earth did i do what do you do in the morning i wake up brush my teeth all right what do you do after that eat breakfast eat breakfast there you go he had to do something right i hazard to guess that i did the same thing right because between here and there something had to happen if i stopped eating at his age and said i was fine i wouldn't be here right now there's no way thank you joseph you're awesome i wouldn't be here right now something had to happen over this year yeah you can take your bible thank you make sure you eat it um something had to happen over the years i had to continuously eat now you see these meetings that we're at right now if we took the same mentality we do with our spiritual lives the way we are in these meetings you might pray for some special meetings and just say hey i'll go to those and lord please change my life i'm going to be really hungry when i get to those meetings and lord i'm expecting something great out of this whole thing but um what about the other meetings what about day to day between meetings what are you doing then what do you what are you doing on those days between the meetings i mean if i did that in the natural the same way and i had a special meeting this week and i wasn't having another one for two months i would probably eat three slices of pizza today and be like fine there's gonna be three slices of pizza in three months i'll be fine i won't be fine i'm gonna die right in fact i wish everybody just i wish we all just had the the spiritual sense to sense whenever we're starving just go for that word you know whenever you're constantly pulling your phone in front of your face there's something you're seeking whenever you're going out there and you're watching i don't know if you're watching something if you're just participating just watch your serving sizes i'm not telling you what's good and what's bad there's no way i could do that right there's no way i can tell for you because everybody's diet is going to be the difference not going to be the same way i don't expect that whatever works for me is not going to work for brother jack it's not going to work but i don't think we even eat the same thing in a week ever i don't think so but he's fine and i'm alive and he's alive you know and none of us died i mean so far it's just maybe eventually but it won't be because of what we ate because we're eating properly right now right second part of verse 14 even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil that's back to those senses just like eve in the garden of eden you know you know the holy ghost it doesn't it doesn't make you a perfect person if you have it if you don't it doesn't make you a perfect person but it will sharpen your senses you know it'll help you understand what's right for you and what's wrong for you and i hope that i hope you realize that's its purpose you know down inside you still have to make a choice every minute of every day what you're gonna take in what you're gonna follow what you're gonna listen to um i have an example i got it from a book but if i had a chocolate chip cookie and i was gonna give it to you guys or to one of you and uh does anybody here not like chocolate chip not a good example all right you don't count right okay most people like them and if somebody doesn't like chocolate chip cookies there's not something wrong with you i don't know what to say all right but if i was gonna give you a chocolate chip cookie and i told you one of those chocolate chips was not a chocolate chip would you take it and it's just like what what if i told you it was something gross like a dead bug would you take it still would you eat it because it's one thing inside that chocolate chip inside that cookie that's wrong but it's still coated in all those good things right it's still sugar right it's still chocolatey goodness still warm it's still soft it's amazing right no you're not going to eat it it doesn't matter right now think of it if you're watching something in a movie it's like pg-13 fine but there's only one swear word you know it's fine let's just eat it let's just watch it anyway it's fine but that's just an example in movies there are so many things that the devil will slip into things that seem good that you you begin to i'm not gonna flat out say it's worship actually it is if you put it before god it's worship if you put something before god then it becomes worship you need to remember this is stuff that's attacking your soul the devil's going to find some way to code it up in something else amen now in the old testament uh israel coming out of exodus it types the church i mean coming out of egypt in the book of exodus it types the church and uh i'll hazard el hazard to say that we act the same way whether we judge them or not the israelites were people just like us and we tend to act the same way but a lot of the things that they did there are can be found although happening to them in the physical it happens to us in the in the spiritual one way or another and when they come out of uh egypt they come out and they're very hungry and they're in a barren land you know it's a it's a deserted land and it's and you know they cry out to the lord who led them there and they fully expect him to feed them because you know he led them there and that's that's perfectly fine he he had to have known that they would be hungry and he had a way to fill them you know before they cried out before they understood that he had a way to fill them up he already knew what he would do in the end to fill them up he had a way of escape for them in psalm 78 it kind of sums up what happens in the book of exodus and how they treated the food that god gave them fresh out of heaven psalm 78 21 therefore the lord heard this and was wrath so a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given to them of the corn of heaven man did eat angels food god gave them the best he had man did eat angel's food he sent them meat to the full he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fouls like as the sand of sea and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire you know i want you to note those words into verse 29 their own desire he he knew they had that desire because he put it there in the first place it's that thirst that brother brennan talks about he knew that they they they had a desire and they didn't know how to fill it they didn't know what would fill it but god knew in the same way you thirst after things in this world time and time again and there's only one thing that can fill it there's only one and you know god knows exactly how to fill it and god will send it to you and it's up to you to take it or not it's up to you and what they failed to do is they failed to take it because you read in verse 30 they said it says they were not estranged from their lusts but while their meat was yet in their mouths while their meat was yet in their mouths they were still yet in their mouths they didn't even digest it they didn't even give god the time to fill up to to give them that fulfilling that they needed it was still in their mouths it didn't even get swallowed that's how ungrateful that we can be with god's word you know and it puts me in mind of a of a wine tasting if anybody knows how wine tasting goes they they have a whole bunch of wines in a room and they give you a bucket because you're just going to take a sip of each one and then spit it right back out you're just going to take a sip oh that tastes me you know make your judgment spit it right back out time and time again but you're not actually letting it affect you because they don't want you to get drunk they don't want you to get filled with that stimulation of revelation you know they don't want you to actually feel what god has for you oh man yes you know it church isn't a wine tasting for you and we treat it like one time and time again you know you just make your judgment oh i don't like the way that guy's been stuttering this whole time who invited him to this church you know i don't like the way he looks he keeps sweating you know i don't like the way the pews are i don't like the people in the church i don't like this and that and then walk right back out and forget that god was there he showed up but you didn't show up ready to receive it that's just so horrible while the meat was yet in their minds you know i love the way true christians digest the word i was uh i was uh when i when i lived in kenya i lived with my grandma for about two months you know and she had us uh she had us hurt her cows and i hated it so much we didn't ride horses you ever see the pictures of the little african kid hitting a kid hitting a cow with a rod you know just following it to the watering hole that's what i did and i hated it every morning you just walk the cows out early in the morning they eat you watch them you take them to the river you come back and then you do it again halfway through the day it was so boring i hated it so much every single day but i didn't understand you know i had there were cows and then there were sheep there i want you to think of this spiritually because we are god sheep you know and they were they were sheep there and i would take them out there and they'd they'd just eat all day they'd just chew all day and i couldn't understand where they put it and then we brought them home back to my grandma's house we tied them up under the trees and in the shade of the trees they just sit down or lie down or whatever and then i'd see them chewing again and i didn't understand it because where they were lying down they had laying down there so often that every blade of grass in that area was picked out every blade there was nothing to eat they couldn't reach the trees but they were still chewing and i was like what are you chewing right now you know i didn't even know i didn't understand what rumination was i didn't know what cud was or anything like that but it re it made me realize you know they would regurgitate it from one of their stomachs and just start chewing it all over again something they were given they'd come back and go over it all over again you know so they could digest it real good and i want you to think of it that way you know you might you might end up in a really bad place where you don't understand you you might have to live off of a past experience and a past tense testimony because you'll be out there in the world and you won't have anything you won't have anything but the word of god that's been given to you to survive you won't see another christian in sight you may not see a minister you may not see anybody at your back you know and you just have to go off of what you've been given over time amen verse 31. remember verse 30 while the meat was yet in their mouths 31 the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works it's how much does god have to do to get his word to us it's just so much that he's done it it's never been this successful in any church age just just how much word you have at the you just pick up your phone and it's there the bible's right there message books everywhere you have brothers and sisters at least we do who will help hold you up and you know ministers you can go to there's just so much that god's done to get his word to you and often enough we just drop it and walk away and do something else put something before god and have an idol that's the worst he makes it so easy to have a relationship with as you just invest your time it doesn't even cost money it doesn't cost that much money that reminds me okay i don't want to get ahead of myself by the brand of 1956 at cadis barnea they went out as soon as they got over there they began to complain they only been out in the desert three months they began to say oh if i had some garlic if i had some leeks they were out there and had substituted angels food for garlic and were complaining why their gastronomics wasn't able to digest angel's food that's what's the matter today we haven't had an old time holy ghost reviver and our spiritual gastronomics is not able to digest real good old-fashioned holy ghost hold on revival he says counter we need a doctor's prescription that's dr jesus prescription that'll get us right you know this this is gospel it's not it's not some low fat you know lean whatever gluten-free non-gmo blah blah blah it's actually organic true gospel and it's just so perfect and he's given it to us he's done everything he can to get it to us and we just pass it up i hate to see that time and time again and i know it attacks young people any young people listening to this it's attacked me it's attacked anyone it attacks anybody at any age you just relax and you know just let slip by whatever whatever god's done for you and just settle for whatever level you're at and just don't even accept anything more don't even try to exercise or do anything for it the supernatural 1956 that's what's the matter with people today they got the campground cramps they go to revival and have a great time the first thing you know a little after that before another revival could come along they're back in the world again you know brother brother branham tells a story in the invasion of the united states 1954 and it's about this horse that i think he used to be a rancher it's about this horse they had tied up and uh no i think it was out in a in a field and he they tied him in a field full of alfalfa it's a type of grass and it would be penned up all day and it would be fine you know he has plenty of grass to eat and it's right there but there was this fence surrounding the place and on the other side of the fence there was a sinkhole and inside the sinkhole there was orchard grass and the horse just loved orchard grass so much he would jump over that fence and guess what inside the sinkhole there was actually broken glass and wires and it's a sinkhole of course you're going to sink inside of it so this horse would jump the fence all the time no matter how many times they left it in the field full of perfectly good grass he would jump the fence into the sinkhole and get cut up just to get a couple bites of orchard grass and it was just the worst now he in conclusion on that story he says i've often thought of that picture the way of a transgressor is hard he would he just wouldn't stay still where he was eating and having a wonderful time but he had to jump the fence and go get all bruised and cut up like that just to get a mouthful of grass of some other different kind now that's just about the way people does that jumps the fence of god's pastor don't you believe it gets out go go out today come in is in church having a wonderful time then tomorrow sell out for something like that it makes it very hard you know he also says an inspiration if the devil wants to tell you you go join the church just stand over on the side some glorious day in the millennium there will be a healing for the sick and there'll be experiences again you know he wants to keep you at that one level and not really think about the future not really think about growing into something new if you want the devil to stick that down your throat and wait for something else you're backing passing by pie and ice cream fried chicken and the good things there's just so many things god has for us you know he also says we shut ourselves off and they do it automatically because he's talking about people who aren't christians they do it automatically we do it because we want to do it we shut ourselves off from god because we want to do it what could you want that would be more than more than what god has to offer you we do it because we want to do it god is good he provides it for us but too many today don't want to get into that healthy place with god a healthy christian have a healthy spirit you certainly would rally for a healthy body anybody would well that body no matter how much health you put in that body it's going back to the dust i want you to think of it spiritually you know we're not headed back to the dust we're predestinated seed god has something something he wants to bring us to some something he wants to build you to we just have to accept it you know i did say that i was typing the spiritual to the natural and i just wanted to say you know when we're born as children the first the first source of food that we have is from our mother right and you're just totally reliant on her providing for you it's it's from her milk that's where you get all your nutrients and every god's naturally provided something in your mother there's something genetically in your mother that can provide what you need everything you need at that point and you know a true mother will act that way she will continue to take care of her child um spiritually speaking you know your mother is your first gospel you're yeah the first people is your mother there's five of them and the first one is your mother you're gonna hear what's right and what's wrong and you're gonna she's gonna punish you in little ways here and there and you just have to accept it and learn because she knows what's best for you because god put that inside her to guide you through the early stages of life but as you get older both of your parents they they help you eat they help you make sure you eat your vegetables they watch what goes on your plate with how much you eat what portion sizes what you finish they watch so many things about that and uh in the same way they make sure you go to church they take you to sunday school if especially if you're a message kid or a church kid they'll take you to sunday school and they they just want you to grow up to be better than they were and that's a perfectly fine ambition but take you to church make sure you go to sunday school they'll sometimes help you with a bible study you know help you with devotions in the house they want to make sure you get exactly what you need but as you grow older and that's until about 12 years old but then you turn into an adolescent and everything changes you get your first job and you suddenly have a life outside of what your parents are dealing with that they don't really have to watch you know they don't get to see what you're doing out there and uh you have you finally you might be able to afford a car but you can buy some food that she's not that they're not providing for you for once you can buy whatever you want they're not watching what you're doing what you're eating and you have the secret life away from them um in the same way spiritually speaking you could you get to this place where you're you're growing and you're in a different generation and you know you're dealing with stuff that they've never dealt with before and you just start um you start to you might end up picking up a habit it might be something on the internet it might be some sort of movie it might be something but since you're older and wiser you're able to hide it from them you make sure you're able to to partake of this thing that's not right and you're fine with that but there they wouldn't be fine with it you just keep it a secret from them just the way eve would and then you get older and you can become a freshman in college you know and there's something called the freshman 15 because it's presumed when you get to college you're going to gain some weight your whole schedule gets completely changed you're not living at home anymore especially if you live on campus you're not a home anymore it's totally different it's up to you because you are a budding adult it's just totally different and uh in the same way spiritually college can shove anything down your throat one way or another and it has nothing to do with what you've heard in church what you hear in church is not what you're going to hear in college at all nothing nothing over there is going to match up with whatever's over here and it's going to be political stuff scientific stuff religious stuff there's going to be all sorts of things that are thrown at you in college and the only way you can get through that is if you've been maintaining your diet through the whole the whole shebang right but it doesn't stop there because i imagine as you get older then you know if you if you didn't correct the way you're eating by the time you get older then you will get to be middle-aged or older and you'll just start to put on weight put on this gut and you know you just have a pot belly you know your career gets in the way your time gets taken up and then you have kids and guess what you turn into your parents and you didn't even see that happen it's like 20 years just went by and you don't know what just happened and you're telling your kids to eat your vegetables what are they going to say to look like you do they want to look like you spiritually speaking if you are doing stuff that you know is not acceptable it doesn't line up with what's being said by your pastor in church and then you're over there at home trying to judge what your parents what what your children are doing and trying to tell them what's right and what's wrong what are they going to take out of that to look like you do they want to do you are you an actual example that god can use to affect the life of your children that's the question you know whenever i was growing up i went through different phases where there were things that i would partake of that i knew was wrong and i hid from my parents of course that i just went over that and one of them was music and it would just completely take me over and i would just i would just need to collect a whole bunch of really really bad songs i knew i couldn't play them when my dad was around or anything and i would hide them from my parents both of them i would hide them from some of my siblings and there was something in me that knew it was wrong so i would hide it and i would do something that i call right now that is spiritual diet because i didn't have anything to fill well i didn't know how to fill the void that the music was filling but since i knew it was wrong and my heart was condemning me i would just quit listening to that music you know and just delete all the files and be like okay i'm quitting cold turkey but that was me that i was i was deciding to do that it was something i thought i could do by myself so i'd just be sitting in the room by myself and just you know it's quiet and i try to play a christian song and it's not working you know it's just not the same it doesn't have that move that i really really thought that i needed and eventually a song would occur to me that's very close to a christian song i can't actually necessarily say that it's bad but that song would occur to me and i just say let me download just that one it's fine just that one no just listen to that one it'll be fine there's nothing wrong with that and then suddenly there'd be another and then another i did it multiple times before i got the holy ghost but when i did when i finally did get the holy ghost god just completely filled that and it was just weird because i would sit in the room and i'd be bored and i just didn't care you know that's weird for a young person to just sit there and not care about you know just sit there and i know people want young people think about this and you wonder it's like what am i going to do i'm going to be so bored after i get the holy ghost because i'm going to do a whole bunch of holy things and how many tapes can you listen to in a day you know like honestly how many can you listen to in a day but i want to tell you about matthew 7 31 he says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall be we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles sink for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take there nor therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof you know after he after he sanctifies you and he calls you and he fills you with the holy ghost he's actually going to find a way to use you your time is going to disappear and you will know what happened he'll be completely different he's actually going to put you into service and time and time again i don't know what that service is gonna be but i just advise you just seek ye first the kingdom of god you know he's got something that he wants you to do he's got so much of his word that he wants to use to bring you higher brother branham in 1955 the water of separation he says i just learned from some medical research the other day that leprosy's caused from the wrong diet that's what causes sin is the wrong spiritual diet it causes an eating leprosy that only god alone can cure and you know he i know he's not a doctor he's a prophet but he knew more about where diseases came from than anybody that i know you know i've learned more about where diseases came from than anyone i know and he says that the number one disease that's affecting the world isn't isn't heart disease even though that's what scientists believe he says it's sin disease you know if you want to get rid of those secret sins and those things that you do that are not right you actually have to change your diet you have to stand on the word and make sure you try to live it and actually go according to it you just have to keep feeding that white dog not the black dog because the decision will always be there it doesn't matter how fit you get you can't stay that fit unless you actually continue to practice and continue to develop and to continue to build and actually exercise it gets harder and harder as you get older that's fine but it wasn't supposed to be easy nobody ever said it was going to be isaiah 55 ho everyone that thirsteth come you to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfyeth not hearken diligently unto me and ee that which is good and let your soul delight yourself and fatness incline your ear okay i know you might ask let your soul delight itself in fatness why would i you were just talking about not being fat this whole time why would you talk about being fat i mean your soul can get fat if you don't i'm trying to say if you don't actually exercise the word then you will get fat you'll just sit there and that's what i was talking about that intellectual faith incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david you know he's saying it's it's without money and without price there's so many things that you end up spending in your quest to fill that void that are just not you don't want to spend them it'll take you so far you'll spend your time you'll spend your youth you know the devil will continue lying to you throughout all those stages of your life that you're too young you should just be able to do what you want to do just live life a little bit you're you're too old that you're past that age where you can do such stuff or you're too busy or something he will always throw something in the way to lie to you to keep you away from getting that thing brother branham says in life 1958 now that blessed thirst what made it come god made you that way and the devil turns around and says this is life this is life but you're receiving death all the time now the word death means a separation and uh that's a separation i not sure exactly the etymology of it but i see it as you know there's so many things that can separate you from god and that's all these things i've been talking about these idols that you put in front of you and uh it's just something especially my phone it separates me from everything around me it for example you know if i'm in a social setting and i pull up my phone that means i've just said that everybody around me is not good enough and there's something else important unless it's someone across the table who texted me you know what i mean but everyone around me is not good enough and i'm just going to take what's on my phone because you guys just don't matter that much that's exactly what that message means i'm not judging anybody though i do the same thing and i just i just want god to grow us all and so we don't just sit here you know especially after meetings like this i'm fully expecting god's gonna come through and give us all something different after these meetings i want something to be lasting something for you to remember i want you to look back on this day and be like god did something there and i can build on it because because he gave me something to work on might not be my sermon it might be somebody else's it might be some something brother stephen brother nathan says it might be some sort of sort of healing it might any sort of experience god can build on it if you continue to feed on that word amen musicians can come back let's have a word of prayer lord i thank you for coming down and blessing us with your word this evening lord lord to some people this may seem silly that we dedicate our time and energy to come back time and again but there's just something for us lord we know that you can fill us up you alone have that thing that can satisfy that desire in our hearts lord we just ask that you do that we open ourselves to receive we ask that you please be a blessing in the next few services lord we thank you for the blessing you've given us tonight lord but lord we want more we ask for more and we know that you will provide it we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord certainly appreciate uh for the airing on tonight and uh spiritual gastronomics so many um uh examples and types that they're about just having the right diet and spiritually but i think one thing i'm going to take with me um tonight is just this example of him uh his 10 year old self and his 25 year old self and uh had he stopped eating at 10 years old then he wouldn't be the person that he is today and i think spiritually some of us have stopped eating right and um because we stopped eating on the word of god it has produced the situations that we're in even as we sit and listen to the word tonight and i just pray that the holy spirit had uh the opportunity tonight just to challenge us amen and cause us to maybe look at what we're eating and i never even looked at how uh eve she has something that she wanted to share but she shared it privately not publicly see if it was something good that she wanted to share then she would have waited till god came down in the cool of the evening but she pulled adam to the side privately and she began to share this this this new thing that she had and and often times um the devil's done the same thing to us to share something privately with us and it's gotten us off our diet we're not eating right we're not acting right we're not responding right but i believe tonight the holy spirit just kind of came to to challenge us challenges challenges it was just um talking to the brothers and they coming here from um visiting in sarasota my brother nathan preached there at brother danny stevens church um brother danny had to leave and um take a trip to texas he would think he went out to preach a funeral i think it was yesterday they were telling me and what had happened it was a young sister a family had left the church a man and you know doing what they want to do and this young girl 19 years old got herself a boyfriend she got herself a boyfriend thought she had somebody that loved her and so on and so forth but something happened in their relationship that that young man took a gun and shot that girl and when he shot her she was strong enough to get to the telephone just to call 9-1-1 and to tell him that she had been shot and and 9-1-1 came but by the time they got there she was gone now you think about things like that see the devil doesn't show us the whole picture he just kind of pulls us out and pulls us into certain situations and and i tell you if you were to if you were to die in a situation like that you have to ask yourself a question would you be ready to meet god would you be ready to meet god right the fun that the devil presents to us a man is temporary fun amen satan wants to use that because his his whole desire is to steal kill and destroy i pray tonight you've heard the voice of the lord jesus speaking to you there's anything that you need to make right with god you're in the right place to make it right if you're in your living room you're in the right place to make it right if you're a man in your bedroom you're in the right place to make it right if you're in your car you're in the right place to make it right if you're in the house of god tonight you're in the right place to make it right the bible says the day that you hear his voice harden not your heart god we thank you for your word that has been spoken in this place we know lord that you had your minister to bring this thought for a very specific purpose you know everybody that would be here listening to it you knew the conditions of our hearts you knew the conditions of our lives sometimes we think we're just walking a man into the house of god and just kind of doing what we normally do but god you have a way of challenging us i thank you lord for your voice that has spoke here tonight and i pray lord that uh it would just make the difference in every heart and every life god somebody's gotten off their diet the lord i pray tonight that the holy spirit will bring them back into amen the right atmosphere that they'll get back on that spiritual diet father tonight they would feed from the word of god father i pray that you just do a mighty work lord as we just worship you lord in this this moment i just pray that the holy spirit would have his way god even those that are home that have heard the word bring them to a place of true repentance god we're not this not a spiritual wine tasting event where we take a little bit and we sip it and then we spit it out god we we need to digest what your word is it's giving us oh god it brings the nutrients it brings the strength it brings it brings everything we need god we need amen another touch of the spirit we need the baptism of the holy ghost it will satisfy our souls thank you for this word i know

before the virus even struck we had this plan then when the virus came we were just so unsure and as i just began to seek the lord and pray it gave me a peace amen to go forward with these services and as i was thinking about you know just the youth began to just think about our church and you know just i just knew that our young people just needed something just needed something and tonight i just believe the lord jesus has kind of come and just kind of set this this set the weekend just right you know with this message and and if nobody else amen heard from god i know i heard from god tonight i know i heard from god tonight and i know god was speaking in this place tonight just just too too perfect some of the things that brother aaron was saying and amen and you know one of the other things he said is that you know you just can't go and feed in one meeting and then think you're going to stay strong amen you've got to go back if you if you stop if you you might have had a good meal today but if you don't eat tomorrow you're going to start having some problems soon right so you got to keep feeding on the word of god keep feeding on the word of god hallelujah i want to encourage you to do that so brother aaron thank you so much for just yielding yourself and getting out of the way and allowing the lord jesus just to use your lips amen just to speak his word amen i know it hit the target tonight i'm not sure what you were going to do with that first picture you didn't tell us what you're going to do at the first picture but okay all right praise the lord but we we thank god for you i mean god is god is good god is good god is good let's just have a word of prayer and i want to just also just offer this if there's anybody here tonight says pastor jack i heard the voice of god and i just want to yield to the lord tonight i want to give you the opportunity to do that amen the altar is open and we will pray with you and pray for you tonight um but we we just don't want to let this moment pass because i know god was know here i know that for sure and i just believe god has proven themselves in that so if you if you have that desire and man while we're here and when you come on up and we'll pray for you even if even if everybody's dismissed and you see i just i don't want to leave this building tonight without just being prayed for you just come and amen let us pray with you tonight that i i know god has spoken and and i'm gonna tell you this all that all god god will use a sermon like this just to reach one just one and he does that because he loves just that one amen so i want to encourage you if you've heard the voice of the lord tonight and you want to change your diet you have that opportunity tonight i want to pray i want to pray father we've heard your voice we've heard your word we know that you've spoken father the only way that you can speak you would have our precious brother lord in indiana kentucky area lord and just deal with his heart to bring a sermon he didn't know who would be here tonight he didn't know but you knew every person that would be present you know everyone that would be online you knew all of that as he was just sharing in the sermon there's some good things to share and there's some bad things to share god's one of the good things we share is we told everybody we told people about the services that were coming and god people responded to the invitation god now you've spoken from heaven to hearts lord it wasn't just amen us just gathering here just to be gathered but lord you want to make a difference in somebody's life and god as we just uh lord we just yield to your spirit and just allow you god to deal with your people we we know that you're doing something we know you're doing something good and father just pray lord that hearts would just yield to uh your spirit is you you you don't have to uh you're not obligated to speak to us the lord when you do we realize it's your love that has been been poured out father from heaven direct to our hearts so i pray lord that hearts with yield not just hear god but those that are online let their hearts yield even at this moment god let their hearts heal let us hear testimonies of lives that have been changed by the word of god and by the power of god that's what ministry is all about lord i pray that you would just move and lord as we just kind of wait on you god and amen if there's any here that desires they just want to want to surrender lord they've heard your voice and they just want to surrender maybe a rededication a recommitment whatever it is lord we just wait on you jesus we wait on you god father we just pray that you just continue to encourage brother aaron and god in the ministry that you would just continue to speak to him lord that you could use him for your glory uh wherever he might speak wherever he might minister lord use them for your glory thank you for all that has happened in this place tonight father lord we're careful to give you all the glory all the honor all the praise it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen i want to go back to amen that i surrender all as you all were playing that amen let's just sing a little bit of that i surrendered [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] surrender i surrendered [Music] surrender all to jesus i surrender oh to jesus i

service will start at 9 a.m we will be hearing in the morning from brother stephen he'll be ministering to us we certainly thank god for him yielding to the call amen in his life and looking forward to what the lord amen wants to speak to us through him and um that service will be at nine and then twelve o'clock tomorrow brother nathan will be speaking and after he speaks we'll be having a prayer line so we invite everyone amen to tune in and and just expect god to work a miracle in your life and in your body we're under expectation so i believe first he starts to deal with the soul because the greatest healing that could ever take place is the healing of the soul amen and i believe tonight the lord has started that work of bringing healing to our souls we thank god for this so at this time amen we will prepare to dismiss and those that have joined us online we say god bless you we thank you so much for being with us and we trust that you'll be able to join us on tomorrow god bless you the brothers will come amen to dismiss you and if there's anyone that needs prayer amen we will be here to pray for you if you need prayer god bless you [Music] so [Music] you
