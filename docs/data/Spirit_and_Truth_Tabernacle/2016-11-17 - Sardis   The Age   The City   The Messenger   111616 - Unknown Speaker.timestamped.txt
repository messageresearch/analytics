[0:09] below turn in our Bibles to Revelation
[0:13] chapter 3 tonight we'll begin new a new
[0:29] church age here thus our degen church
[0:33] age and here in Revelation chapter 3
[0:38] verse 1 through 6 it deals with this
[0:42] particular church age and one thing that
[0:45] we want to again reiterate is these were
[0:50] seven churches that did exist in Asia
[0:53] Minor but they had characteristics and
[0:56] the churches that represented things
[0:58] that would happen in future ages so
[1:02] we're just kind of picking up some of
[1:03] the characteristics and even even when
[1:05] you look at the church ages with some of
[1:08] the characteristics that would be
[1:10] displayed in few changes we could also
[1:12] look at different people in Scripture
[1:14] when we pulled out suffering that woman
[1:16] jezebel she had a certain spirit that
[1:19] was going to be reflected in future ages
[1:21] her daughter a failure certain spirit
[1:24] that was upon her that would be
[1:25] reflected in future ages especially in
[1:27] this time in which we live so as we as
[1:31] we just kind of go through this
[1:32] hopefully God is help us to see the
[1:34] spiritual types that are here and we'll
[1:38] just beast around that here in verse 1
[1:40] says and unto the Angel of the church I
[1:44] mean onto the Angel of the church in
[1:46] Sardis write these things that he that
[1:51] have the seven spirits of God and the
[1:54] seven stars I know that works that thou
[1:56] have some name that thou Libous and are
[1:58] Dan be watchful and strengthen the
[2:01] things which remain that are ready to
[2:04] die for I have not found that works
[2:06] perfect before God remember therefore
[2:09] how thou has received and heard
[2:11] and old fast and repent if if therefore
[2:15] thou shalt not watch I will come on thee
[2:17] as a thief and thou shalt not know what
[2:20] hour I will come upon thee thou has a
[2:23] few names even in starters which have
[2:25] not defiled their garments and they
[2:28] shall walk with me and white for they
[2:31] are worthy he that overcometh the same
[2:35] shall be clothed in white raiment and I
[2:37] will not blot out his name out of the
[2:39] book of life but I will confess his name
[2:42] before my father and before his angels
[2:45] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:47] the spirit saith unto the churches all
[2:51] right okay again just kind of going back
[3:00] and looking at our little map here we
[3:04] can see the seven churches that were
[3:06] represented here according to Revelation
[3:08] 120 says the mystery of the seven stars
[3:11] which thou sawest in my right hand and
[3:13] the seven golden candlesticks the seven
[3:16] stars are the angels of the seven
[3:18] churches and the Seven candlesticks
[3:20] which doubt saws are the seven churches
[3:23] and we've gone through Ephesus which is
[3:26] identified as number one there and that
[3:28] map Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira and now we
[3:33] are at the fifth age which is Sardis and
[3:36] you can see what as where where that's
[3:39] relative to the map there the number
[3:41] five on the map and what happened here
[3:46] and brother Branham tells us that this
[3:52] the Tsar degen or the fifth church age
[3:55] lasted from 1520 to 1750 and this is
[4:00] usually called the age of reformation
[4:03] and our history books it was this Aegis
[4:07] spoken of that they call it the age of
[4:09] reformation but something tremendous
[4:11] happened there and I remember just being
[4:13] young and in school and hearing about
[4:16] some of the people that were that lived
[4:18] in his time and when I first heard the
[4:20] story of Martin Luther and what
[4:22] did with his 95 theses by melting to the
[4:25] Catholic Church door that was something
[4:26] in history that just kind of struck a
[4:28] vein with me I really enjoyed hearing
[4:32] about him and you know I didn't I didn't
[4:35] understand why I like hearing so much
[4:37] about him until later on when I began to
[4:40] read the church ages and see how brother
[4:42] branham pulled him out and said that he
[4:43] was a messenger or a star the angel to
[4:47] the age of started so i will get will
[4:50] get further in that little bit later on
[4:51] but but I've always you know this is
[4:54] something we can just go back in history
[4:56] and actually bring the comparison do you
[4:59] know to when we talk about these when we
[5:01] talking about the churches we're not
[5:02] talking something completely outside of
[5:05] you know of things that never happen but
[5:08] these are historic events that were
[5:10] actually timed right into scripture a
[5:12] lot of people when they look at the book
[5:14] of Revelation have no idea that that I
[5:16] mean these first few chapters of
[5:17] Revelation is just talking about the
[5:20] history of the church you know just it's
[5:21] really completely talking about history
[5:23] church where we were where we started
[5:25] from the days of Paul all the way to
[5:27] where we are today you know with with
[5:30] the legacy and churches but this gives
[5:32] us all of our history so that we you
[5:34] know I think it's very important that if
[5:36] you don't learn from history then it's
[5:39] your bound to actually make the same
[5:40] mistakes over and over again so I think
[5:43] it's very important that you know your
[5:45] history not just I mean I mean church
[5:46] history is very important that you know
[5:48] your church history alright let's go a
[5:50] little further here tonight some of the
[5:53] key statements and scriptures that were
[5:55] found in our reading as we open up this
[5:59] section you know I'm talking about the
[6:01] age the messenger the city some of the
[6:05] key statements that were found was
[6:07] brother branham said the fact that this
[6:09] is the age of the first real break with
[6:13] papal rome that actually flourish no
[6:17] doubt khalsa Jezebel profit is to
[6:19] consolidate and emphasize our doctrine
[6:21] of Mary Allah tree now I put an
[6:23] underlined there because this is a very
[6:26] very special age the age of Luther you
[6:30] know this was H because you know before
[6:32] this especially in the dark ages and
[6:34] some of the things that we've talked
[6:35] about and the ages before there was one
[6:38] age where you know they just they put
[6:42] anybody to death that did not agree with
[6:45] their teachings you know they just they
[6:47] just absolutely putting to death and
[6:48] here we find in this age and even the
[6:51] scripture told them that you know just
[6:53] to see if I can just find that scripture
[6:56] here really quick I want to go back to
[6:58] it in revelation to 10 it says fear none
[7:02] of those things which thou shalt suffer
[7:04] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[7:06] into prison that you may be tried and
[7:07] you should have tribulation 10 days
[7:09] without faithful unto death and i would
[7:11] give thee a crown of life so way back
[7:13] then and that in that time period
[7:14] underneath the smyrna church age people
[7:17] were dying for their faith they were
[7:19] dying because they believed you know
[7:22] because they were holding on to the
[7:23] truth you know of that day all the way
[7:27] up to this time where we're getting into
[7:29] Sardis church age now we finally see it
[7:31] feel a little reprieve people can
[7:33] actually differ with the Catholic Church
[7:35] and live right so this is um when
[7:38] brother Brandon touch this is the first
[7:40] break with papal rome that's the
[7:42] Catholic Church the first real break
[7:44] with papal rome that actually flourish
[7:46] they didn't die for what they believed
[7:49] had Luther not done what he did and
[7:52] standing against the Catholic Church it
[7:54] would not have opened the door for all
[7:56] the other denominations to come forth it
[7:59] started there with Lutheran and I mean
[8:02] you can just go on down you know the the
[8:04] Baptist episcopalian I mean you just
[8:08] name it all those Protestant you know
[8:10] denominations that came forth from it
[8:13] problem is with all the different
[8:15] denominations but certainly we thank God
[8:17] that there was a freedom people broke
[8:20] free from the Catholic teachings in
[8:22] Catholic hierarchy we thank God for that
[8:24] but when the scripture told us that they
[8:27] had a name that they lived and aren't
[8:29] dead the reason that the scripture says
[8:31] that is because they went right back
[8:32] into the same denominational system
[8:35] might have been different men running it
[8:37] but they had the same system and like I
[8:39] told you off y'all if we can't see that
[8:42] plainly from when you know
[8:44] anyone my age or older you remember when
[8:48] the Baptist and the and the Pentecostals
[8:51] and whoever else that would get together
[8:54] they got a whole bunch of preachers
[8:55] together you always could identify the
[8:58] Catholic priests always right now you
[9:01] can't do that I mean like mother like
[9:04] daughter right the daughters looking
[9:07] just like the mama now because that's
[9:08] what it came from amen it's going to be
[9:11] very few in this hour that's not going
[9:13] to be in a system like that and I can
[9:17] tell you is going to get down to being
[9:18] the Bride of Christ when you think about
[9:21] the persecution that came you know even
[9:24] in the days of it tell you I tell you I
[9:26] was just thinking on this failure went
[9:28] after the king's sons she was not trying
[9:31] to kill anybody else there she just went
[9:33] after the king's sons anybody that was a
[9:36] threat to her position she went after
[9:39] them right and when I think about going
[9:42] up to the king's sons I think about you
[9:44] know it's only don't worry that the
[9:46] brighter price would be the only ones
[9:47] that's persecuted those ones they really
[9:49] come after the excuse me you know as
[9:54] different laws may change whatever
[9:56] that's to come against people that
[9:58] standing for the word of God amen that's
[10:00] what it's really all about and i'ma tell
[10:02] you most churches are going to give in
[10:04] to the pressure but it's going to be a
[10:06] small group that's not going to give you
[10:07] in right and and ask we're going to be
[10:10] found in that little group but thank God
[10:12] the same got that provided for others
[10:13] that didn't give in it's the same God
[10:15] just gonna provide for us in this hour
[10:16] when we don't give in amen brother
[10:20] branham also said this he says as Luther
[10:22] crystallize the doctrine of
[10:25] justification by faith they held two
[10:28] works penance prayers and other
[10:31] unscriptural means so as Luther began to
[10:35] solidify his position with what he was
[10:38] believing challenging them to come back
[10:40] to the word then the Catholic Church
[10:42] began to get deeper and their their
[10:44] works get deeper in their penance their
[10:46] prayers and any other unscriptural means
[10:49] you know and and some of the penance was
[10:51] on I was looking this up people would go
[10:54] to the priest named would confess and
[10:56] then the priests would actually
[10:57] tell them what they would need to do in
[10:59] order to in order for God to forgive
[11:02] them other thing that they've done
[11:04] sometimes there were some really bad
[11:06] things that people do you know only
[11:07] knees crawling and doing all kind of
[11:09] stuff I I was reading something it's not
[11:13] as bad as that as bad as it used to be
[11:16] today I mean there's other maybe it
[11:18] might have to say I follow out in heaven
[11:19] a hundred times or whatever but you know
[11:22] you get different things that the priest
[11:23] would tell you you have to do in order
[11:25] to in order for God to forgive you
[11:27] there's nothing scripture about that at
[11:29] all you know the only thing that the
[11:31] free should be able to say is just
[11:33] repent be baptized the name of Lord
[11:34] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[11:35] sins and you will see the gifted old ago
[11:37] so just guide you according to the word
[11:39] but making up things for you to do in
[11:42] order for God to receive you that's not
[11:43] even scriptural not scriptural anyway
[11:45] right so but here's Luther crystallize
[11:48] the doctrine of justification by faith
[11:51] they hell two works penance prayers and
[11:54] other unscriptural means one of the
[11:57] scriptures that was brought out here in
[11:59] this section was revelation 2014 brother
[12:02] Branham was quoting it and and what it
[12:05] was really this scripture says death and
[12:07] hell were cast into the lake of fire
[12:08] this is the second death and any time
[12:10] where we're looking at this you know
[12:13] even even back in the previous age that
[12:16] was the penalty that it made it made a
[12:20] statement here let me just go back and
[12:22] get it I will kill her children with
[12:25] death that was back in Revelation 223
[12:28] and that was in five tier our kill her
[12:30] children so her children is talking
[12:33] about the denominational churches that
[12:35] came from the Catholic Church I'll kill
[12:37] her children that the end result for
[12:40] denominational teaching is a lake of
[12:42] fire amen the am result for
[12:46] denominational teaching is a lake of
[12:49] fire amen now no matter what they make
[12:53] you feel like right now the end result
[12:55] of all of that is that is the lake of
[12:57] fire that's what's going to happen to it
[12:59] right God does not accept it amen so i
[13:04] would i would advise anybody that's why
[13:06] you heard the prophet just screaming out
[13:08] many times he
[13:09] was the angel revelation 18 that was
[13:11] screaming I come out of her my people
[13:12] right not go into her but come out of
[13:15] her he kept screaming that out and
[13:17] that's why it's so important that you
[13:21] know if we don't get anything else we
[13:22] can't we cannot be going back to the
[13:24] nomination now I'm not saying go visit
[13:26] you know you can't go visit yeah we all
[13:28] might do that but make that your church
[13:30] home I just don't see how you can do it
[13:33] especially with this type of teaching no
[13:35] one with the image though I don't care
[13:37] how to make you feel right I mean you
[13:40] know they say they're the way that you
[13:42] boil a frog is you have to put them in
[13:45] water that is comfortable with first and
[13:48] then you slowly turn up the heat and
[13:50] that's how you kill them and that's
[13:52] exactly what the devil is doing the
[13:53] people make them feel so comfortable oh
[13:55] they just love me they love me more than
[13:58] the people in the message well actually
[14:01] do they love you more than God right I
[14:04] mean you're gonna run into some people
[14:06] they're gonna think I'm they going to
[14:08] people will always disappoint you let me
[14:11] just get that get that to you real quick
[14:13] people will always disappoint you I
[14:16] don't care who they are I don't care
[14:17] what church they go to somebody gonna
[14:20] disappoint you that's why the Bible
[14:22] declares don't put your trust in the
[14:25] armor flesh it'll fail you every time
[14:27] and it's not like people willingly want
[14:29] to disappoint you but it's just human
[14:31] nature they can't help it nobody's
[14:34] perfect like that right so the main
[14:38] thing is that don't put your don't put
[14:39] your confidence and trust in people put
[14:41] your trust and confidence in Christ amen
[14:45] so this that when he's bringing out this
[14:47] death in the hell were cast into the
[14:49] lake of fire this is the second death
[14:51] he's clearly telling us in this age that
[14:55] that's going to be the end result of the
[14:57] this teaching you know denominational
[15:00] teacher is going to lead people right
[15:02] into the tribulation alright this other
[15:08] thing that he said and we're going to
[15:09] get into this little more seibel was the
[15:13] Astarte that Jezebel was priestess to
[15:15] and calls israel istanbul by the
[15:19] licentia strikes that she conducted
[15:22] just turning your Bibles real quickly to
[15:24] first Kings 18 and I won't read all this
[15:27] but I'll give you a little summary and
[15:33] 1st Kings 18 this this particular
[15:45] chapter is where Elijah is challenging
[15:49] the profits of bail but now what what
[15:54] most people tend to miss in this we
[15:59] talked about the 450 prophets of bail
[16:01] but they were also 400 other prophets
[16:03] right and here in chapter 19 where he's
[16:07] telling the God that answered by fire
[16:08] let him be God in first Kings 18 verse
[16:11] 19 he's challenging them but these are
[16:14] the prophets that he's talking about
[16:15] verse 19 says now therefore sending
[16:17] gathered me all Israel into Mount Carmel
[16:19] and the prophets of bail 450 right so
[16:24] these prophecies that were dedicated to
[16:26] serving bail and then it says and the
[16:29] prophets of the groves now those are the
[16:32] prophets those are the prophets that
[16:37] served a star d alright these are the
[16:39] prophets that serve a star T and an
[16:42] Astarte what we're going to find out and
[16:45] this in this star degen age Astarte is
[16:48] also known as seibel all right side belt
[16:51] i should say Cybele side by was the
[16:54] authority that Jezebel was priestess to
[16:56] and cause israel istanbul by the
[16:59] licentious writes that she conducted so
[17:01] when we talk about the 400 prophets of
[17:03] the groves which ate at Jezebel's table
[17:05] and I'm just my gun you know eating at
[17:08] Jezebel's table that means she was
[17:09] taking care of them she was paying them
[17:12] right she she you know whatever they
[17:16] need it they can get it from Jezebel and
[17:18] and and how many preachers today are
[17:22] stuck in denominational churches because
[17:25] desperately getting a paycheck from will
[17:28] not come out want to retire there right
[17:31] knowing that is wrong but when a retired
[17:34] will stay for a year
[17:35] in something that's wrong because that's
[17:38] where they get their paycheck from man
[17:40] it takes faith to leave a system like
[17:44] that and stand on the Word of God
[17:46] allowed God to supply your needs it take
[17:48] faith a man but I tell you what I've
[17:52] never seen the righteous forsaken nor
[17:54] his seed begging bread a man God would
[18:00] take care of those that stand for his
[18:02] word god will do it amen but here you
[18:06] know we look at those 400 prophets of
[18:08] the Groves that's who we're talking
[18:09] about here cyber was the Astarte that
[18:12] Jezebel was priestess to and causes
[18:15] Israel verse number by the licentious
[18:16] writes that she conducted all right okay
[18:26] just kind of talking about Sardis the
[18:29] city this was the capital city of
[18:32] ancient Libya the capital city of
[18:35] ancient Lydia the other thing about this
[18:39] is this city was that one time very
[18:44] important commercially it was very
[18:46] important commercially at one time
[18:48] another thing about the city it was said
[18:51] that gold coins were first minted here
[18:54] in the city of Sardis that gold coins
[18:57] came from this and I just find this
[18:59] quite amazing that goal would be found
[19:01] first in the city of Sardis right if
[19:06] that's where their first been too and
[19:07] there's something in this city specially
[19:10] when we're looking at Siple that's a
[19:11] picture of cyber that you're seeing on
[19:13] the screen ciples represented Marianna
[19:16] Catholic Church and guess where gold is
[19:17] found a day in the Catholic Church
[19:20] brother Branham said that we would go to
[19:23] the gold standard and when we go to the
[19:25] gold standard that mean the Catholic
[19:26] Church going to have complete ownership
[19:28] of the way that money flows I you know
[19:35] I'm i'm not i'm not a prophet but i do
[19:39] wonder with a president that has already
[19:45] filed for bankruptcy multiple times
[19:51] what his thinking in any way shape or
[19:54] form be to get connected to the Catholic
[19:57] Church somehow I don't I I just wonder I
[20:02] just wonder so we got a lot to look
[20:05] forward to and and the greatest thing we
[20:08] got to look forward to is a wrap alright
[20:11] man even so come Lord Jesus but look at
[20:14] these types here right here in this city
[20:17] of Sardis gold coins were first minted
[20:21] there in Sardis and and in Sardis let's
[20:26] find a couple other things here there
[20:29] was desolated by earthquakes and plagues
[20:32] and thus it's an uninhabited it's an
[20:36] uninhabited heap of ruins today brother
[20:38] branham tells us and the last thing that
[20:40] he told us the religion of the city was
[20:43] the Emperor worship of the goddess
[20:45] Cybele and again that seibel there in
[20:48] the picture I want to we just want to
[20:52] try to all right I thinkoh the next
[20:54] slide here we're getting to some other
[20:56] things here we want to bring in just
[20:59] some of the spiritual characteristics of
[21:00] of this what what are we trying to get
[21:05] to hear why would the Holy Spirit to
[21:08] Sardis you know as as one of the
[21:11] churches there was something happening
[21:12] in that church that was going to be
[21:14] representative of something that was
[21:16] happening in a future age and I'm just
[21:19] pulling some notes we did him a Sunday
[21:22] School lesson around this a few months
[21:25] ago and brother Trevor in Jeffersonville
[21:28] he's kind of he actually arranged just
[21:31] curriculum and he he had some notes
[21:34] there when he went you know when we were
[21:35] going through he'd had some notes that I
[21:37] just kind of pulled and put inside on
[21:38] this slide but I wanted he just kind of
[21:40] summarized some things from my reading
[21:42] which I thought were very very key
[21:44] statements first the city of Sardis was
[21:47] known for the worship of the female
[21:50] deity by the name of seibel known for
[21:54] the worship of the female deity by the
[21:56] name of seibel at one point seibel and
[21:58] do eous were worshipped together and if
[22:02] I recall correctly delius was her her
[22:05] son all right so here seibel and do is
[22:09] worship together but by and by and the
[22:12] city of Sardis it came to worship seibel
[22:15] alone leaving the worship of do deus out
[22:18] completely so the son was taken out of
[22:21] the picture and now is complete emphasis
[22:23] on the mother well that ought to tell
[22:25] you something right there the minute
[22:27] because Mary is more admired than Jesus
[22:32] this is the spirit that was in that day
[22:35] that's actually not coming out all the
[22:38] way out to today we can see a man
[22:41] another thing here it is brother brother
[22:46] trevor sent why is it important to this
[22:48] age why do we want to know this about
[22:49] Cyrus it's because as time went on the
[22:52] Catholic Church began to focus on the
[22:54] worship of Mary and getting further from
[22:57] worship of Jesus it's more about the
[23:02] worship of Mary than it is about the
[23:04] worship of the Lord Jesus so that's
[23:07] that's what we're seeing ok let's go on
[23:11] brother branham brought out to us and
[23:14] we're going to go back and hit some of
[23:16] these quotes I want to go back because
[23:17] he he called our attention to the
[23:21] program ian age and what happened in the
[23:25] program Ian age now actually I tell you
[23:31] what let's let's pull that up for now i
[23:33] want to i'm going to go to the quotes
[23:41] from this slide slide 7 and not the
[23:47] first quote but the second one I want to
[23:49] start reading and in your church age
[23:50] book page 184 we're going back to the
[23:54] program ian age and we just want to read
[23:58] a couple things from there 184 and I'll
[24:03] start at paragraph 2 hero 184
[24:14] alright brother branham says here now
[24:17] how was this Trinity express it was
[24:21] expressed by an equilateral triangle
[24:23] even as it expressed in Rome today
[24:26] strange the Hebrews did not have a such
[24:28] a concept now who is right is it is it
[24:32] the Hebrews or the Babylonians in age of
[24:35] the polytheistic idea of three gods and
[24:37] one came out of an image with three
[24:39] heads on one body he is expressed as
[24:42] three intelligence three intelligences
[24:44] and India they found it in their hearts
[24:47] to express him as one God in three forms
[24:50] now that really is good modern-day
[24:52] theology in Japan there is a great
[24:55] buddha with three heads like the one we
[24:57] previously described but the most
[24:59] revealing of all is that which sets
[25:01] forth the Trinitarian concept of God in
[25:04] a triumph form one they have an old man
[25:07] symbolizing God the Father to a circle
[25:10] which in the mystery signified seed
[25:13] which in turn means the Sun and three
[25:16] the wings and tell of a bird of here was
[25:19] the doctrine of Father Son and Holy
[25:21] Ghost three persons in the Godhead a
[25:23] veritable Trinity you can see the same
[25:26] thing in Rome now let me ask once again
[25:29] is it not strange that the devil and his
[25:32] worshippers actually have more truth
[25:34] revealed than the father of faith
[25:35] Abraham and his descendants is it not
[25:39] strange that the worshipers the
[25:43] worshippers of Satan knew more about God
[25:44] and the children of God now that is what
[25:47] modern theologians try to tell us when
[25:50] they talk about a Trinity I like that
[25:51] statement if as a son of God has a
[25:57] daughter of God you know your father
[25:59] right no matter what Trinitarians might
[26:02] try to teach you you know your father's
[26:04] not three he's warrant right and and no
[26:08] matter how many schools people go to and
[26:10] I'll only go to school if they coming
[26:11] out with that revelation something is
[26:13] wrong with it right but we know our God
[26:16] is one and you can't tell me my goddess
[26:18] three because he's my father not yours
[26:21] amen praise the Lord amen came nobody no
[26:27] matter if you if you know your father
[26:28] you know your father nobody can tell you
[26:30] that that he's not right nobody can tell
[26:33] you that hey he man glory to God listen
[26:36] he said is it not strange that the
[26:38] worship of Satan knew more about God and
[26:40] children got now isn't that what modern
[26:42] theologians try to tell us when they
[26:43] talk about a tree just remember this one
[26:45] thing from their own these records are
[26:47] faxed and this is a fact Satan is a liar
[26:49] and the father of lies and whenever he
[26:53] comes with any light it is still a lie
[26:55] he's a murderer and his doctrine of the
[26:58] Trinity has destroyed the multitudes
[26:59] that were destroyed until Jesus comes
[27:02] according to history it did not take
[27:05] long for a change to be made in this
[27:06] concept of a father and the Son and the
[27:08] Holy Ghost Satan took them a step at a
[27:11] time away from the truth the Evolve
[27:13] concept of deity was now one the Eternal
[27:17] Father to the Spirit of God incarnate
[27:19] and a human mother does that make you
[27:22] think three a Divine Son the fruit of
[27:26] that incarnation a woman's seed but the
[27:29] devil is not content he hasn't achieved
[27:35] the seer but yeah yeah okay let me just
[27:42] keep going all right yeah so the devil's
[27:45] not content he hasn't achieved worship
[27:48] of himself yet except in an indirect way
[27:51] so he takes the people away from the
[27:54] true still further through his mysteries
[27:57] he reveals to the people that since the
[27:59] great invisible father God does not
[28:01] concern himself in affairs of men but
[28:03] remain silent relative to them then it
[28:06] follows that he may well be worshiped in
[28:08] silence actually it means to ignore him
[28:11] as much as possible if not altogether
[28:13] this doctrine spread around the world
[28:16] also and right today and India you can
[28:18] see that temples to the Great Creator
[28:20] the silent gar are strikingly few in
[28:22] number it says since it was not
[28:26] necessary to worship the creative father
[28:28] it was only natural that worships one to
[28:33] the mother and child
[28:35] as the objects of adoration in Egypt
[28:38] there was the same combination of mother
[28:40] and son called Isis and Osiris and
[28:43] Indian it was easy and hist whare note
[28:47] the similarity of the names even and
[28:48] Asia it was seibel Cybele and do es in
[28:53] Rome and in Greece at follow suit and in
[28:56] China well imagine the surprise of the
[28:59] Roman Catholic missionaries as they
[29:00] enter china and found there a Madonna
[29:02] and Child with rays of light emanating
[29:04] from the head of the babe the image
[29:06] could well have been exchanged for one
[29:08] in the Vatican except for the difference
[29:10] of certain facial features all right so
[29:13] brother branham is just kind of bringing
[29:15] this out so we'll go back to the slide
[29:18] there he's bringing this out and
[29:21] remember now this kind of started this
[29:23] whole thing of polytheism started at and
[29:29] Babylon right when when they were trying
[29:32] to build the Nimrod was trying to build
[29:36] a tower and everything what his father
[29:38] start teaching was polytheism between
[29:41] many gods not monotheism would be only
[29:44] one God but he began to teach polytheism
[29:46] which was mini gods and and what
[29:48] happened there is when their languages
[29:50] got confounded you know at the Tower of
[29:53] Babel what happened the reason that we
[29:55] get this is ian is flora and you know
[29:58] and or Isis and Osiris the reason that
[30:01] we got all of that is because the people
[30:04] that left the Tower of Babel because of
[30:06] their language is being confounded they
[30:08] went to other areas but as they went to
[30:10] other areas with their new languages
[30:12] they still carry the same teaching and
[30:15] that's how we ended up with all this
[30:18] stuff that looks exactly like the same
[30:19] all right they just got different names
[30:21] but that's what you see is a very
[30:25] similar thing so here in Egypt it was
[30:28] mother the mother and son was Isis and
[30:30] Osiris and India it was it see in its
[30:32] whare in Asia it was Cybele and do es
[30:36] and then brother branham said also you
[30:38] find the same thing in Rome Greece and
[30:40] China you see the same thing so let's go
[30:43] a little further here when we look at
[30:46] delius and and
[30:47] I Bell some of the comparisons that the
[30:50] Prophet brought out to us in our reading
[30:53] do it was the OS was the son dawg and
[30:58] when you look at SG when God again he's
[31:01] trying to take the place of the s om of
[31:04] God right so he was the son got but
[31:06] Cybele she was the moon goddess he was
[31:11] the OS was the lord of heaven but she
[31:14] was the queen of heaven do it was the
[31:17] revealer of goodness and truth and she
[31:20] was the revealer of gentleness and mercy
[31:23] I do it was the mediator and she would
[31:27] be considered the media tricks do is
[31:31] what do is he had the key that opens and
[31:35] shuts the gates of the invisible world
[31:37] and Cybele had an identical keep doing
[31:43] likewise and I'm putting underlining
[31:45] that for a reason we'll go on do it was
[31:50] the judge of the Dead and Cybele was
[31:53] standing at his side the audience have
[31:55] been killed he was killed raised and
[31:58] ascended into heaven and Cybele was
[32:01] carried their bodily by the Sun I
[32:03] brother branham also told us that Rome
[32:06] and Rome this same God has given the
[32:08] title our Lord he is called the Son of
[32:09] God which she is called the mother of
[32:12] god right now I want to just let see I
[32:15] think I want to bring something yeah a
[32:18] couple of quotes here page 244 and your
[32:21] church age book 244 paragraph to in
[32:24] paragraph three let me just let's just
[32:27] get those lined up it's brother branham
[32:32] went through this and bringing that
[32:35] little a comparison to us it made a
[32:37] statement here says now that is what we
[32:42] found back there in the other two ages
[32:44] where the mother son concept took on
[32:46] such tremendous proportions but now
[32:48] notice that even as it was back in
[32:51] Babylon that the worship of the Sun
[32:52] began to lose out in favor of the
[32:55] worship of the mother so she literally
[32:58] began to take the place of the Sun
[33:02] says we see in this age that the pagan
[33:06] worship of Stardust was the worship of
[33:08] the woman it is Cybele alone not 5l and
[33:13] do eous the mother has literally taken
[33:16] the place of the Sun endowed with the
[33:20] merits of Godhead all one needs to do is
[33:23] go go over her various titles in column
[33:25] the lovely attributes accorded Mary by
[33:29] the Roman Church to understand where the
[33:31] religion of this age came from he says
[33:34] two things really struck me with force
[33:36] as I looked into the worship of Cybele
[33:39] what was the fact that she wore key like
[33:42] Jana's which gave her the same authority
[33:45] as Jana's key to heaven and earth and
[33:49] the mysteries now let me just also drop
[33:52] that you know let's bring in the
[33:54] Catholic Church with this you know they
[33:57] were they were known for selling
[34:00] indulgences and I'm going to bring out
[34:02] something that Martin Luther said a
[34:03] little bit later on but suddenly
[34:05] indulgences date that if a person died
[34:11] and the Catholic Church didn't essence
[34:13] it in with the heaven they use a thing
[34:15] purgatory and say the person with the
[34:17] purgatory and say now if you want to get
[34:20] them out of purgatory what you're going
[34:22] to need to come with some money and then
[34:24] we'll pray and we'll get them out of
[34:26] purgatory and didn't they'll get to
[34:27] heaven now there is no scripture in the
[34:30] Bible that says purgatory none
[34:32] whatsoever but people have been given to
[34:34] the catholic church for years over this
[34:37] false revelation right and they had
[34:39] these type of things are in place they
[34:41] kept telling that a lot of people people
[34:43] bought into the lie won't challenge it
[34:46] in any way with scripture right but but
[34:49] they've but this is how to count the
[34:50] church has gotten so rich because it's
[34:52] because of things like this it shows
[34:55] that they had the key right seibel right
[34:58] as a woman the church catholic church as
[35:01] a woman had the key to what happened to
[35:03] people after they left this earth my god
[35:06] at least they think they had a key
[35:09] they've tricked people to feel like they
[35:11] had a key only person got that key is
[35:12] the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:14] a man again he says two things really
[35:19] struck me with force as I looked into
[35:20] this worship of saibo one was the fact
[35:24] that she wore key like jamis which gave
[35:26] her the same authority as Janice key to
[35:28] heaven and earth and the mysteries and
[35:30] the fact that the worshippers whip
[35:32] themselves until blood spurts from their
[35:34] bodies which thing is done right today
[35:37] by the Catholics who feel they're
[35:39] suffering like the Lord now brother
[35:48] branham just told us that these people
[35:49] whip themselves until blood spurted from
[35:51] a body's Cybele was a star d of Ahab's
[35:59] day that's who Jezebel was worshiping
[36:02] Astarte are psycho guess what her priest
[36:05] did when when when when Elijah
[36:10] challenged him and said let the God that
[36:12] answer by fire be god guess what her
[36:14] priest in they cut themselves that was
[36:18] idol worship way back then and I don't
[36:22] care if it's in the name of Christianity
[36:24] it's still idol worship today hey man
[36:27] and you find that same spirit right then
[36:30] the Catholic Church and it's coming
[36:34] right on down into some of the other
[36:36] churches to that same spirit coming
[36:38] right on down and this you know thank
[36:40] God for a profit y'all thank God for
[36:42] profit you know if we didn't know these
[36:45] things we just be going right along with
[36:47] all kind of stuff man we're gonna stay
[36:49] with this work praise God alright let's
[36:53] go back to our slides
[37:10] ok so again why Sardis there's similar
[37:14] spiritual characteristics that we see in
[37:16] Sardis that also exists that we see with
[37:20] the Catholic Church and here the Prophet
[37:23] tell well actually this is a note from
[37:25] brother Trevor game says what we're
[37:27] learning about what we are learning
[37:29] about the worship of silence artist is
[37:32] that this particular characteristic of
[37:34] this city is defining the false Church
[37:35] of the age of Sardis as the men of God
[37:39] began to pull away from the Catholic
[37:40] Church and focus on justification by
[37:42] faith in Jesus Christ the Catholic
[37:44] Church began to focus more on
[37:46] worshipping Mary why because seibel is
[37:54] the same as a starting the Roman
[37:57] Catholic Church is the new Jezebel so
[38:00] we're talking about that in Revelation
[38:02] to suffering that woman jezebel the
[38:04] Roman Catholic Church is the new Jezebel
[38:06] system and who was and who was it who
[38:09] was a digestive and worship seibel but
[38:12] by the name of a starting very important
[38:15] that same spirit that was way back there
[38:18] and Elijah's Dane has made itself I mean
[38:22] as found myself all the way down to this
[38:24] day and guess what they live Joe called
[38:27] out against that spirit in his day the
[38:30] spirit of Elijah called out against that
[38:32] spirit again and this thing my the types
[38:37] are all over it types are all over it
[38:40] the types are all over and thank God I
[38:43] ain't worried about no bridge y'all I'm
[38:45] sorry did I mean it's just just too much
[38:48] be worried by a bridge you know one
[38:52] brother was telling me you know Moses
[38:59] Moses went to the mountain and the bush
[39:04] was on fire and and it didn't burn it
[39:06] wasn't consumed and Moses heard a voice
[39:09] that take off
[39:11] your shoes your own holy ground and
[39:14] Moses took off his shoes and he heard
[39:16] from gardening went back to take
[39:18] deliverance to the children of Israel
[39:20] but the problem is is you can't find
[39:22] that story on google nowhere can't find
[39:26] it yeah you can't find where Moses is
[39:30] that a burning bush and took off his
[39:34] shoes there was the only person with
[39:36] dare was Moses how do we know Moses it's
[39:38] telling the truth how do we know that we
[39:42] can't find it on google you're gonna
[39:45] have to take Moses by faith you're going
[39:47] to take this message by faith I'm gonna
[39:51] tell you if there's if there's a seat of
[39:53] God in your gonna be identified with
[39:54] this word I believe what happened with
[39:56] Moses just like I believe what the
[39:58] prophets in I can't gotta find it on
[40:01] google i still believe a man praise God
[40:06] alright I think I got something here yes
[40:13] there's a couple quotes here that I want
[40:15] to read 244 paragraph four and five I'm
[40:23] start to 45 so here it's the Prophet
[40:28] tells us the fact that this age is the
[40:31] first real break with papal rome that
[40:34] actually flourished no doubt calls a
[40:36] Jezebel prophetess to consolidate
[40:37] consolidate and emphasize of doctrine
[40:40] Mary Allah tree which is the worship of
[40:42] Mary and decided opposition to the
[40:45] Protestants who denied her any part
[40:46] whatsoever in the plan of salvation
[40:48] apart from her fame with God as the
[40:50] Virgin chosen to bear the babe as Luther
[40:53] crystallized the doctrine of
[40:55] justification by faith they held two
[40:56] works penance prayers and other
[40:59] unscriptural means and as the free
[41:01] Christians glorified the Sun the Roman
[41:04] Catholics increased their deification of
[41:05] Mary until the 20th century saw and
[41:08] opposition to the most high rankin Roman
[41:11] theologians pope pius literally exalt
[41:14] married to glorification in a
[41:15] resurrected body that doctrine is
[41:18] absolutely the babylon babylonia sh1
[41:21] the Sun carrying the mother bodily and
[41:22] to heaven no wonder this fifth age goes
[41:26] right along with the other ages and will
[41:28] do so until it ends in the lake of fire
[41:30] with a and her children are killed
[41:32] in the second death and that's what I
[41:34] was bringing out with a revelation 20
[41:37] this is the end they did whether it's
[41:41] the Catholic Church and every
[41:43] denomination that came from underneath
[41:45] it the end result of that will be the
[41:47] second death they'll go through
[41:49] tribulation and they'll end up in the
[41:51] second death all right there it is Mary
[41:54] Allah tree the worship of Cybele by the
[41:56] way did you know that psycho was the
[41:58] started at Jezebel was priestess to and
[42:00] calls Israel stumbled by licentious
[42:03] writes that she conducted yes that is
[42:05] who she was in the Bible alright that's
[42:09] going a little further here we'll talk
[42:14] about the messenger here in our Martin
[42:19] Luther was the messenger
[42:28] okay Martin Luther born November 10th
[42:31] 814 83 and died februari 18 1546 this
[42:37] age started in 15-20 and if I recall
[42:39] correctly I think he was about 62 years
[42:41] old when he died about 62 years old so
[42:46] brother Brandon brought up some points
[42:48] about Martin Luther said he was the best
[42:49] known of all the messengers another
[42:53] thing about him is that he he became a
[42:56] priest and was not even saved I found
[43:00] that kind of amazing Martin Luther was
[43:02] preaching the gospel and one even safe
[43:04] guess what job we got the same thing
[43:08] today it's a lot of preachers in the
[43:11] pulpit day not even Christians I was
[43:13] just telling somebody the other day I
[43:14] see you know I don't seem too much I
[43:17] said I can't can't stomach the fact that
[43:23] a man can be called pastor of a church
[43:26] and he's still cursing everybody out and
[43:32] I'm listening to this man cursing
[43:34] everybody out but he's he just got
[43:36] promoted to pastor I'm thinking did
[43:38] y'all even stopped to see if the man was
[43:40] seen first I know you go to church but
[43:43] is he saved is the man of Christian and
[43:46] if he is safe safe from what what did he
[43:49] repent up I mean if dark can cleanse
[43:52] your mouth my we got a week God right
[43:57] mommy weren't the first thing should
[43:59] happen your language to start changing
[44:00] right when God come in your language to
[44:03] start to ain't no way you can keep
[44:04] saying the same stuff you used to say uh
[44:06] no no no no no no right but I'm
[44:09] listening to this band he just boy I
[44:11] mean every word in the book that I'm
[44:14] thinking I should hear that in corporate
[44:17] America not in a church not not inside
[44:20] of a church not somebody that worked for
[44:22] the Lord that's what I can't see but I
[44:25] told people s you know but but you know
[44:27] here martin luthe was doing the same
[44:29] thing he was it was working for the Lord
[44:31] but also I mean not even saved yet not
[44:35] even say we need people to become
[44:37] Christians first before they start
[44:39] trying to do anything
[44:40] God in man Martin Luther preach to just
[44:46] shall live by faith I love this he wrote
[44:50] the 95 thesis and the other thing about
[44:54] Martin Luther he was a reformer not a
[44:58] prophet that's very important for us to
[45:00] understand he was a reformer and not a
[45:04] prophet I do have some quotes that I
[45:06] want to read but a bit but rather than
[45:08] read that right now I'm going to go on
[45:10] to the next slide and then I come back
[45:13] and read will read something about
[45:14] Martin Luther I went and looked at the
[45:20] 95 theses and just try to pull out a few
[45:22] things that he was uh you know that he
[45:25] was he was standing against this man
[45:28] just blessed my heart you know the way
[45:32] that he just he whipped stood you know
[45:35] the Catholic Church just just the way he
[45:37] did it and actually when he Nellie's 95
[45:41] theses he did in a way he was inviting
[45:43] them to to come and debate with him he
[45:47] want debate over these scriptures he
[45:48] wanted to bait over these over these
[45:49] things and you know all he did wants to
[45:55] just want to talk about it but often I
[45:57] mean many of them just didn't really
[45:59] want to talk about it and ultimately
[46:01] what happens that he got he got kicked
[46:03] out of the church because of his
[46:05] differences I one of the things that
[46:07] first thing that he started I would say
[46:09] when I Lord and Master Jesus Christ said
[46:11] repent he will the entire life of
[46:14] believers to be one of repentance you
[46:17] know it's Jesus that's calling us to
[46:19] repentance right and that's just
[46:21] something we should all constantly be
[46:23] doing we always find ourselves in a
[46:25] mistake where we need to repent but
[46:27] thatthat's Christ that calls us to that
[46:29] not the Catholic Church calling us to it
[46:31] but it's Christ that does that right
[46:34] another thing that he said it says hell
[46:38] purgatory and heaven seem to differ as
[46:42] do despair almost despair and the
[46:45] assurance of safety so he just come to
[46:49] the hell purgatory of having seen the
[46:51] difference asked as to despair almost
[46:54] and the assurance of state do so there
[46:56] is no such thing as purgatory right but
[46:59] the church came up with this stuff and
[47:01] was teaching it to the people he's
[47:02] calling that out right he's calling out
[47:05] thank God for this man he says they they
[47:10] preach only human doctrines who say that
[47:14] as soon as the money clinks into the
[47:16] money chests the soul flies out of
[47:19] purgatory as soon as y'all get that
[47:22] money all of a sudden the person got
[47:25] released in purgatory he calling it like
[47:28] it is it says Christians ought to be
[47:35] taught that the post partners are useful
[47:37] if they do not put their trust in there
[47:40] but altogether harmful if through them
[47:43] they lose their fear of God you put in
[47:47] the church before you put god that's
[47:49] harmful right so he's just he just kind
[47:52] of making it very very clear here as to
[47:55] where he stands and this lat has last
[47:57] last thesis the 95th one was and thus be
[48:01] confident of entering into heaven rather
[48:03] through many tribulations then through
[48:05] the assurance piece right in ax 1422
[48:09] tells you that you'll go through much
[48:11] tribulation in order to enter into
[48:13] heaven but that's tribulation that God
[48:16] allows to come into your life right it's
[48:18] not but the church forces upon you
[48:20] that's not that's not what this is all
[48:23] about so I mean he just he just never
[48:25] ninety-five theses to the Catholic
[48:27] Church door and because they did that it
[48:29] it started a reformation it open up some
[48:32] doors for other churches to come out you
[48:36] know and thank God for at least that
[48:37] part happening but the reason that
[48:40] they're still des because they went
[48:41] right back in the same organizational
[48:43] system that they came out of let's not
[48:46] finished off we'll read some quotes here
[48:48] regarding Martin Luther from the
[48:51] previous slide this is on page 245 in
[49:00] your church age book
[49:05] alright and the Prophet says the
[49:08] messenger to this age is the best known
[49:10] message of all the ages he was Martin
[49:12] Luther Martin Luther was a brilliant
[49:13] scholar of gentle disposition he was
[49:16] studying to be a lawyer when the
[49:18] lingering illness and death of a dear
[49:20] friend calls him to become serious
[49:21] concerns the spiritual condition of his
[49:23] life he entered the Augustinian convent
[49:26] at the effort in 1505 there he studied
[49:30] philosophy and also the Word of God he
[49:33] lived the life of the severe penance but
[49:35] all the outward acts could not banish
[49:38] his sense of sin instead I've tormented
[49:41] myself to death to make peace with God
[49:43] but I was in darkness and found it not
[49:46] the vikas General of his order stop it's
[49:50] helped him to gain the insight that his
[49:53] salvation would have to be be the
[49:54] experience of an inner work rather than
[49:56] a ritual with this encouragement he
[49:59] further sought God later he became a
[50:01] print priest as yet he was not saved it
[50:05] became an avid and deep student of the
[50:07] wording of the great theological works
[50:08] extent extent he was sought out as a
[50:12] teacher and preacher is depth of
[50:14] knowledge and great sincerity to fulfill
[50:17] a vow he made to himself he went to Rome
[50:19] there he saw the futility of the
[50:21] church's imposed works that were to
[50:23] bring salvation and the Word of God
[50:25] struck home to his heart that just shall
[50:27] live by faith on his return home the
[50:30] evangelical truth of the scripture
[50:33] flooded his mind he was set free from
[50:36] sin and born into the kingdom of God
[50:38] soon after this he was elevated to dr.
[50:41] divinity and commissioned to devote his
[50:43] whole life to the study and faithfully
[50:45] expound and defend the Holy Scripture
[50:46] this he did it with such effect that his
[50:49] heart him and the hearts of those around
[50:51] him were deeply fixed upon the truth of
[50:53] the word the word soon came into open
[50:56] conflict with the abuses of church
[50:57] creeds and doctrines thus when Leo the
[51:01] tenth became become Pope and John Tetzel
[51:04] came to sell indulgences for sin Luther
[51:07] had no choice where the rasa forgives
[51:09] his anti scriptural teaching first he
[51:11] thundered from the pulpit against it and
[51:13] then wrote his famous 90
[51:15] thesis which on October thirty-first 15
[51:17] 17 18 out to the door of castle church
[51:21] in a short time okay in a short time
[51:29] Germany was ablaze and the Reformation
[51:31] was on now let it be remembered that
[51:33] Martin Luther was not the only one who
[51:35] had protested the Roman Catholic Church
[51:37] he was one he was but one of many others
[51:40] that denied the Pope's their self
[51:42] granite temporal and spiritual power and
[51:44] even amongst the Pope's there were minor
[51:47] temporary reforms yes there were many
[51:50] others who raised issues but in the case
[51:52] of Lutha God's time was right for a
[51:54] definite move that would be the
[51:56] beginning of the restoration of the
[51:58] church to an outpouring of the Holy
[52:00] Ghost at a much later date ray goes on
[52:04] up now Martin Luther himself with a
[52:06] sense of spirit feel Christian he was
[52:09] definitely a man of the word for he not
[52:11] only had a profound passion to study it
[52:13] but to make develop make it available to
[52:16] all an order that all might live by he
[52:18] translated the New Testament and gave it
[52:20] to the people this laborious work he did
[52:23] himself correcting the passage as many
[52:25] as much as 20 times they gathered around
[52:28] him a group of Hebrew scholars amongst
[52:31] whom were Jews and translated the Old
[52:33] Testament let me just see something here
[52:39] yeah let's just keep going this
[52:42] monumental work work of louth is still
[52:44] the work upon which all successful words
[52:46] of Scripture and Germany arrested he was
[52:48] a mighty preaching teacher of the word
[52:50] and insisted especially in his first
[52:53] years of public eminence that the word
[52:55] was the sole criterion thus he was
[52:58] against the works as a means of
[53:00] salvation and baptism as a means of
[53:02] regeneration he taught the mediation he
[53:05] talked the mediation of Christ apart
[53:07] from man as was the original and
[53:09] Pentecostal concept he was a man given
[53:11] too much prayer and had learned that the
[53:12] more work he had to do the more solely
[53:14] he was pressed for time the more of his
[53:17] time he gave to God in prayer in order
[53:19] to ensure satisfactory results he knew
[53:21] what it was to battle with the devil and
[53:23] it is said
[53:25] Satan one day visibly appeared to him
[53:27] and he flung the inkwell at him bidding
[53:28] him go another time to Fernandez came to
[53:31] him to induce him to join with him and
[53:33] banishing all priests and Bibles he
[53:35] deserved the spirit within them and sent
[53:38] them off it is recorded of dr. Martin
[53:41] Luther and sorrows history volume 3 page
[53:43] 406 that he was a prophet evangelist
[53:46] speaker in tongues interpreter and one
[53:49] person and doubt with all nine gifts of
[53:52] the Spirit I mean just just a really
[53:56] really special man here I want to get
[53:58] over here I'm going to skip down to two
[54:03] paragraphs here it says now as the time
[54:09] ok says now is the time went on we find
[54:13] a great change in the way he conducted
[54:15] affairs in which he was involved at
[54:17] first he had been so gentle so fearless
[54:19] so patient and constantly waiting on God
[54:22] to work out the problems but then the
[54:24] VAT that then vast numbers began to come
[54:26] to his banner their purpose was not a
[54:28] truly spiritual and rather they had
[54:31] political motivations they wanted to
[54:33] break the yoke of the Pope they disliked
[54:35] sending money to Rome fanatics rose up
[54:38] soon he was dragged into political
[54:40] affairs and decisions that actually lay
[54:42] outside of the realm of the church
[54:44] except that the church through prayer
[54:46] preaching and conduct might set up a
[54:49] standard to be heated I want to just I
[54:52] want to just interject something here
[54:54] evenin brother bamas ministry fanatics
[54:56] rose up and and there was some fanatics
[55:00] that were actually baptizing brother
[55:04] branham's name they were doing a lot of
[55:07] things you know and brother branham's
[55:09] name and when brother branham actually
[55:11] heard of it he actually went came to the
[55:14] church and announce that i'm coming out
[55:16] to feel because if my ministers
[55:18] producing something like this that makes
[55:19] me Antichrist i'm coming off the field
[55:22] he gave up his ministry and he told her
[55:24] brothers that started this doctrine they
[55:27] say every soul that I'm not able to get
[55:30] to because i'm off to feel God gonna
[55:33] hold it to your account they said God
[55:35] gonna hold you responsible because you
[55:37] started this false doctrine
[55:39] it sent to y'all can repent this I will
[55:41] not be on the field the next date and
[55:43] brothers only needs repenting right but
[55:46] it shows fanaticism follows everything
[55:48] my god what most people india's they
[55:52] don't got their eyes on the fanatics but
[55:55] not on the real believers a man you keep
[55:58] your eyes on the rear believe and if you
[56:00] ain't seen the real believers be a real
[56:02] believer amen saic not you p 1 you'd be
[56:10] the first one and let us all follow you
[56:12] a man stop complaining about everybody
[56:15] else you be the example and man right
[56:19] but but fanaticism follows everything no
[56:22] matter what number you know the sports
[56:25] fanatics they're gonna follow and some
[56:30] peeping going sit down and just enjoy
[56:32] this little sport event but others gonna
[56:33] come out with painted face and all kind
[56:35] of stuff they fanatics cold weather then
[56:38] got no clothes on I mean it these people
[56:41] are lost a mind fanatics follow
[56:43] everything amen some people just don't
[56:46] know how to keep it in the in the middle
[56:48] of the road all right let's go on that's
[56:53] that's what everything church that's
[56:54] even with us even with the word people
[56:56] don't know how to keep it in the middle
[56:57] of the road and and and they're going to
[56:59] lean too far one way or the other and
[57:00] that's what's going to create the
[57:01] problem amen listen fanatics rose up
[57:05] soon he was dragged political affairs
[57:06] and decisions that actually lay outside
[57:08] the room the church except the church
[57:10] through prayer preaching and combat
[57:11] myself a standard to be be heeded these
[57:14] problems the politics mounted until he
[57:16] was forced into an untenable position of
[57:19] mediating between lords and peasants his
[57:21] decisions were so wrong that an uprising
[57:24] took place and thousands were killed he
[57:26] meant well but once he it left let
[57:28] himself be entangled again in the church
[57:30] state gospel he had to reap the
[57:32] whirlwind but for all that god used
[57:34] martin luther let it not be said that
[57:37] his intentions are wrong let it only be
[57:39] said that his judgment film truly if the
[57:41] Lutheran's could get back to his
[57:43] teaching and serve God as his gracious
[57:45] brother served him then the people would
[57:47] surely be a credit and praise to the
[57:49] great god and savior jesus christ
[57:52] and I actually skipped the actuals
[57:59] paragraph for brother Brandon brought
[58:00] out very clearly that because of Martin
[58:03] Luther getting involved in all the
[58:05] political things that's why he would be
[58:07] considered a reformer and not a prophet
[58:09] right my profit knows to stay with the
[58:12] word and stay out outside of all of that
[58:14] you know all the political stuff it's
[58:17] not going anywhere epley I mean even
[58:19] when Jesus was on earth the Jews wanted
[58:22] him to rescue them from their political
[58:24] leader of that David geez like not my
[58:26] kingdom is not of this world yeah I'll
[58:28] miss what I'm here for it wasn't about
[58:30] politics it wasn't about that it was you
[58:34] know it's about spiritual things in them
[58:36] so a prophet will stay away from him to
[58:39] stay with the staff the Lord not stay
[58:41] you know in a political arena there was
[58:44] a quote that was circling around the
[58:45] internet here just recently where
[58:47] brother Brandon made a comment about if
[58:50] he knew who the next president was and
[58:53] could tell people with who that who the
[58:55] next president was going to be before
[58:56] the president before it was even
[58:58] announced they said that would actually
[59:00] not do anything to glorify God if
[59:03] they're all that's gonna do is bring
[59:04] glory to me and God don't do things like
[59:06] that to bring glory to us right he's
[59:10] trying to bring glory to himself so it's
[59:12] no need to even get involved in any of
[59:14] that whatever gonna happen gonna happen
[59:16] right but it's not going to change what
[59:19] God has planned for his bride all right
[59:22] let's go on so next week we will be
[59:28] reading and pages to 48 to 252 and we'll
[59:35] be talking about the salutation and the
[59:37] age of Sardis the salutation during this
[59:40] age praise the Lord all right let's have
[59:42] a word of Prayer or close out for
[59:45] tonight father we are grateful for this
[59:51] time of studying word and God my my
[59:55] sincere desire is that we God would
[59:59] really get a true understanding as to
[1:00:02] what it is that you've called us to and
[1:00:05] God and once we understand then we can
[1:00:08] help others we know Lord Jesus that
[1:00:12] Satan is just doing so much to try to
[1:00:15] trick people in sour and it's all
[1:00:18] because he was he wants to try to get
[1:00:20] worship he wants it he's trying to bring
[1:00:22] it to himself and if you can get the
[1:00:23] people attempted off of you then they
[1:00:27] can eventually get their attention on
[1:00:29] him so god help us to keep our eyes
[1:00:31] solely on you and to see you Father and
[1:00:35] in the beauty of your revelation except
[1:00:40] you God would just continue to take us
[1:00:41] deeper in our study of this ardesia
[1:00:43] interchange Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:00:46] amen amen praise well let's prepare for
[1:00:51] tonight
