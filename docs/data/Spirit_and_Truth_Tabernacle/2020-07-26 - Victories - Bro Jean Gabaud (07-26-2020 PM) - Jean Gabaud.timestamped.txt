[3:29] war should rise against me in this will
[3:32] i be confident
[3:33] one thing have i desired o the lord that

[28:08] god is moving in the midst of all of
[28:10] this right
[28:11] god is touching people god is healing
[28:12] people in the midst of all of this
[28:14] hallelujah amen amen
[28:18] amen i heard this week about a
[28:20] particular sister that you know
[28:22] that had contracted the virus and she's
[28:25] kind of taking care of herself
[28:26] uh you know and being a nurse and
[28:29] everything and i think she probably
[28:30] knows some things that maybe others
[28:32] don't know
[28:32] but she uh she she's taking care of
[28:34] herself and but that lady
[28:36] when i heard about the case i remembered
[28:39] some of the things that that sister did
[28:43] for this church even though she don't
[28:45] come here
[28:46] i remember the things that she did and i
[28:48] said the best thing that i could do
[28:49] right now
[28:50] is lord stand in the gap for her
[28:54] because you know it's some things that
[28:56] she did at a certain season
[28:59] the reason that we are even in here is
[29:02] some of the things that she did
[29:04] god remember things like that so if we
[29:06] have an opportunity to stand in the gap
[29:08] god remember
[29:09] what she did remember the seed that she
[29:12] planted god
[29:13] we rebuked this thing in the name of
[29:15] jesus right
[29:16] hallelujah right so we you know you you
[29:19] can you can stand and pray and
[29:21] you know and just kind of feel what
[29:23] they're feeling and and expect to see
[29:25] results
[29:26] hallelujah we expect that so so i'm just
[29:29] you know i'm just i'm just thanking god
[29:30] for for all things
[29:32] uh uh we so we'll continue to do what we
[29:34] have been doing
[29:35] a man uh now we won't have um
[29:39] um we won't have friday night service
[29:41] but i i
[29:42] am there is something that i want to do
[29:45] and i will get word out i don't want to
[29:47] necessarily announce it but i will get
[29:49] word out
[29:50] uh something that's specifically for our
[29:53] youth that i want to do so
[29:54] uh i will let you all know about that
[29:56] coming up in the month of august

[41:56] softly let's just by our hearts
[41:59] heavenly father we counted a privilege
[42:02] that
[42:03] we could gather together and assemble
[42:06] around your word
[42:08] i'm reminded in your scripture where the
[42:09] bible says where the carcass is
[42:11] there the eagles will be gathered
[42:13] together
[42:14] father we come under expectation this
[42:16] afternoon that you would come and
[42:18] minister to
[42:19] each and every need father you know the
[42:22] desires of the hearts of your people
[42:25] and the lord i pray father that you
[42:27] would just honor their request
[42:30] may you meet those needs exceed
[42:32] expectation
[42:34] may you continue to put a a protection
[42:37] round about them
[42:39] may you be with them the lord and father
[42:41] i pray that you just remove any
[42:43] distractions from their lives
[42:45] that would prevent them from giving you
[42:48] their best
[42:49] from worshiping you and glorifying you
[42:52] and father as we turn our attention to
[42:54] the preaching of the word
[42:56] father even i myself am under
[42:58] expectation
[43:00] i yield myself as a servant unto you
[43:02] deliver the tool that you can use that
[43:04] you can be a blessing to your people to
[43:06] god
[43:07] speak to us now for we'll be careful to
[43:10] give you the praise and glory that you
[43:12] alone are worthy of
[43:14] and the bride says amen god bless you
[43:17] saints
[43:18] amen certainly good to be in the house
[43:19] of the lord if you wouldn't mind
[43:21] grabbing your bibles turn with me to
[43:22] exodus chapter 17
[43:25] bring you greetings from from my family
[43:28] children doing very well by god's grace
[43:30] it's amazing
[43:32] how fast eight months go it's it's
[43:35] really amazing and um
[43:37] i was telling jack earlier that um one
[43:39] of the benefits of being able to work
[43:41] from home
[43:42] as in in my case um is just seeing kind
[43:45] of that growth and that development
[43:47] and um you know from them being an
[43:49] infant to where they're really
[43:51] you know you could keep them in one spot
[43:53] and they stay in one spot
[43:56] now you look away in just a split moment
[43:58] and they're not in that same spot
[44:00] so and they're just kind of moving
[44:02] around and their personalities are
[44:04] beginning to come
[44:04] through and it's just it's just uh
[44:08] remarkable and as i was saying
[44:10] previously you know there's you know
[44:11] there's that scripture in isaiah where
[44:13] the bible says they that wait upon the
[44:14] lord
[44:15] shall renew their strength and um my
[44:17] wife and i we've patiently waited for
[44:20] these little blessings and to know that
[44:21] they've now come into our lives
[44:23] there's that renewed strength that we we
[44:25] we're experiencing
[44:27] and um it's just uh joy unspeakable
[44:31] and um like i was just i previously
[44:34] mentioned that um
[44:35] you know it's one thing when you pray
[44:37] about something and the next day you get
[44:38] it
[44:39] you know but when you've waited for a
[44:41] while right you know that appreciation
[44:44] you know um just you know you're you're
[44:46] much you're you're delicate in how you
[44:48] handle the blessings of god
[44:51] because you know it was through a lot of
[44:52] you know alone nights of prayer a lot of
[44:54] toils a lot of tears and
[44:57] and so we're just we're just
[44:59] appreciative of
[45:01] the blessings of god and we appreciate
[45:02] your prayers because many of you
[45:05] have been on the journey with us and um
[45:07] and just to be here
[45:09] it's just really awesome so we um given
[45:11] the circumstance we couldn't bring them
[45:13] i couldn't come down with them but i
[45:15] trust there'll be other
[45:16] opportunities for me to come down with
[45:18] them so but then nonetheless they send
[45:20] their greetings
[45:21] and um i do have some pictures after
[45:23] church so in case
[45:24] anybody's interested it's funny because
[45:26] i never thought i'd be kind of that
[45:28] father
[45:30] i never thought i'd be that father it it
[45:33] bothered my mind when
[45:34] like you got a lot of pictures of your
[45:36] kids you know the first couple of hours
[45:38] my kids was just like you know
[45:40] constantly just take so i i got tons of
[45:43] pictures
[45:45] you know it's it's it's it changes you
[45:47] you know and it's a
[45:49] it's a good feeling so we just we just
[45:51] thank god for that amen
[45:53] all right well praise the lord turn with
[45:54] me you're there already so exodus
[45:57] uh chapter 17. we'll have one we'll read
[45:59] one verse and then we'll go from there
[46:01] and then um and we'll just kind of trust
[46:04] the lord in all of this so
[46:05] exodus 17 verse 8 and it reads
[46:10] then came amalek and fought with israel
[46:14] in rephadel we read it again then came
[46:17] amalek and fought with israel
[46:20] in referendum amen may the lord have his
[46:22] blessings to the reading of the word you
[46:23] may be seated
[46:26] um i'll also try to draw i also read
[46:29] this last
[46:30] um the last two verses of the same
[46:32] chapter in exodus 17 the last two verses
[46:35] and moses built an altar and called the
[46:38] name of it
[46:39] jehovah nisi which for he said because
[46:43] the lord has sworn that the lord will
[46:45] have war with
[46:46] amalek from generation to generation
[46:50] so so we're by god's grace going to try
[46:53] to link
[46:54] these together but i wanted to kind of
[46:57] set the stage because it just seems
[46:59] um just out of nowhere where the
[47:02] scripture
[47:03] is is being called out then came amalek
[47:07] um and fought israel so that that word
[47:09] then
[47:10] is a transitional word right so
[47:12] something occurred
[47:13] then this happened right so then emalek
[47:16] came so we'll come back to that thought
[47:19] um we'll come back to that thought as we
[47:21] kind of build on this
[47:22] but i want to set the stage of where
[47:24] israel is at in their journey
[47:27] so israel had been in egypt for quite
[47:30] some time
[47:31] and god had heard the cry
[47:35] of israel and um had seen
[47:38] like i was saying before their
[47:40] affliction and has
[47:41] heard their cry and know of their
[47:45] sorrows
[47:46] and so god was acquainted with the
[47:49] suffrage of his people
[47:51] and um and and and so he
[47:54] looked to moses um to uh
[47:57] to utilize him as a vessel to go down
[48:00] towards
[48:01] egypt and bring his people out
[48:04] and so um as the story would go
[48:07] um you know moses uh uh
[48:10] uh you know yielded himself as a vessel
[48:14] to go and invade egypt
[48:18] as the prophet would uh explain it it
[48:20] was a one-man
[48:22] invasion now let me kind of help
[48:25] kind of set the stage for you this is a
[48:27] one-man
[48:28] invasion with his wife and kid and
[48:31] they're
[48:32] they're invading one of the most
[48:34] powerful nation
[48:36] on the earth at that time
[48:40] but prior to that moses had just come
[48:43] into contact
[48:44] with god so nothing
[48:48] could stand in god's way so if you
[48:51] happen to be a bystander as you were
[48:53] watching
[48:54] moses you know and his wife and his
[48:56] child on a donkey
[48:57] and they're going back to egypt where he
[48:59] left he left egypt
[49:00] he just came from egypt and now he's
[49:02] going back to egypt
[49:04] moses where are you going i'm going to
[49:06] invade egypt
[49:08] all right what else can you really say
[49:14] so moses was going down to egypt
[49:17] following god's strict order
[49:21] because he knew that god was in control
[49:24] of this
[49:26] because you know let me just kind of
[49:27] drop this i remember jesus said ah you
[49:30] know he says
[49:31] he says i'll see you on the other side
[49:34] so no matter what the storm did or what
[49:37] no matter what came through
[49:39] no matter how bad the storm was jesus
[49:42] said i'll see you
[49:44] on the other side so i don't care about
[49:47] the storms of life
[49:49] he made a promise to me and i'm holding
[49:52] on to
[49:52] that promise if he says i see you on the
[49:55] other side
[49:56] then that tells me i made it to the
[49:58] other side
[50:00] amen so
[50:03] here was moses going down to egypt
[50:08] and god was already working on the scene
[50:12] because moses uh pharaoh's heart
[50:15] hardened against what moses was trying
[50:17] to do
[50:18] and god was trying to prove his people
[50:20] because the prophet says that
[50:22] pharaoh was actually a tenderhearted man
[50:26] and so he was probably in a position
[50:28] where he was willing to
[50:29] let the children of israel just go but
[50:32] you know
[50:33] situation occurred in which god hardened
[50:35] his heart and so he held the children of
[50:37] israel back
[50:38] and there were many plagues that you
[50:40] know that played
[50:41] the nation and you know it's interesting
[50:44] because
[50:46] you know sometimes you just kind of you
[50:48] don't know where people's minds are at
[50:50] because you know when moses went down
[50:52] there he you know he
[50:54] he had to stick in his hand and you know
[50:56] he he says you know
[50:57] uh he threw his stick down and and the
[51:00] and
[51:00] and the people won't impress because
[51:03] when the stick turned into serpents
[51:04] they weren't impressed and so when and
[51:07] when when
[51:08] janice and jabras they came they they
[51:10] threw their stick down too
[51:12] and their stick turns into serpents as
[51:13] well so moses said
[51:15] swallowed them up so they're saying look
[51:17] the same power you have we have
[51:20] like all right and so
[51:25] god would bring a plague in egypt
[51:30] bring a plague in egypt would turn
[51:33] the water there into blood right
[51:36] would bring frogs in the nation
[51:41] genus and genbrans did the same thing
[51:44] they turn water into blood it's in the
[51:47] scripture
[51:48] to show that they could do that too
[51:51] their people's already suffering
[51:54] and yet they want to do the same thing
[51:56] to show
[51:58] you're not any better at the expense of
[52:00] their own people
[52:05] so you have plague after plague god's
[52:08] punishing the nation
[52:11] and the the the folks on the opposite
[52:14] side saying look that that's that's
[52:16] that's just
[52:16] that's just a fancy magic trick we could
[52:18] do the same thing you could bring frogs
[52:19] we bring frogs too right yeah
[52:21] it doesn't make sense to me you turn
[52:24] water into blood we could do the same
[52:25] thing too we'll do it
[52:27] yeah rather than gleaning what the
[52:29] lessons is from god they want to show
[52:31] that
[52:31] hey we could we can make bad happen too
[52:35] so things kind of build up a little bit
[52:39] and finally it gets to the point where
[52:42] um
[52:43] the deaf angel was getting ready to make
[52:45] its round
[52:46] and i'm kind of setting the stage to how
[52:48] we got here so bear with me
[52:50] and as the death angel was making this
[52:53] round moses
[52:54] told the children of israel put a blood
[52:58] on the post and lentil
[52:59] yes and when the death angels see that
[53:02] blood
[53:02] he says i will pass over you amen
[53:08] so it didn't matter how good of a
[53:09] preacher you were
[53:11] it didn't matter how good of a singer
[53:13] you were it didn't matter
[53:15] all all that she knew it didn't matter
[53:17] if you knew moses or not know moses
[53:19] it didn't matter if you knew aaron or
[53:20] didn't know aaron all you knew
[53:22] was that i had to put the blood on the
[53:24] pulse and lentil
[53:27] because the death angel is going to make
[53:29] its way around the country
[53:31] and it's not going to discriminate
[53:35] when i see the blood i will pass over
[53:37] you
[53:40] so i know back then believers i don't
[53:43] know if i was back then i would have
[53:44] taken that really seriously
[53:47] i would have made sure that the blood
[53:49] was visible in my door
[53:52] i wouldn't have left any room for
[53:54] guessing
[53:56] i don't want a bunch of death angels
[53:57] congregating some of some i wonder if
[53:59] that's a mistake
[54:02] i want it so that way a mile away you
[54:05] can see that the blood's been applied
[54:07] i'll be painting my door so red son go
[54:10] back can you see it
[54:11] i can see it go back a little bit
[54:13] further can you see it
[54:15] i can see it go back some more i want to
[54:18] make sure
[54:19] that there's no doubt that you know
[54:23] that there's a son of god there's a
[54:25] family of god
[54:26] in which the token is applied
[54:30] amen
[54:36] then the nation was brought to its knees
[54:41] when the death angel made its way
[54:43] throughout the country
[54:45] can you just imagine what an experience
[54:47] it must have been like
[54:48] for the children of israel cradling
[54:51] their kids
[54:52] behind closed doors and then the blood
[54:55] the token being applied and to hear the
[54:58] cries
[54:59] of those around you the agony and the
[55:02] pain
[55:04] they woke up the next day and pharaoh
[55:07] had enough
[55:09] because even his own son was taken he
[55:11] said y'all gotta go
[55:16] so israel was coming out of egypt
[55:20] but here's the thing even though you
[55:23] come out of the world it doesn't mean
[55:25] that the world will not try to influence
[55:27] you
[55:31] and so as egypt as israel left egypt
[55:35] pharaoh probably thought about it
[55:36] contemplated and he started to choose
[55:39] some
[55:40] chariots to go after
[55:43] israel and
[55:46] as they went after israel
[55:50] can you just imagine this i want you to
[55:52] i want to paint this picture
[55:53] you had the the world's most powerful
[55:57] military with the with their
[56:00] elite soldiers chasing after a group of
[56:05] believers
[56:08] what were they afraid of
[56:11] they have witnessed the power of god
[56:15] come on
[56:16] and they gather not
[56:19] not just uh foot soldiers but chariots i
[56:22] mean that's kind of like
[56:23] that's uh that's like that's your top
[56:26] military
[56:27] you know uh uh uh equipment that you use
[56:31] to go to battle to go to war and they
[56:33] were gonna do serious damage
[56:36] and so they were in hot pursuit after
[56:40] the children of israel
[56:42] and um as they were pursuing after them
[56:46] the children of israel realized that
[56:49] they were in hot pursuit
[56:52] so they left egypt they left the world
[56:56] but the influence of the world is not
[56:58] following them
[56:59] to bring them back into egypt
[57:04] that's the reason why a lot of young
[57:05] christians when they first come in
[57:06] they're so excited
[57:07] but they're still struggling with the
[57:09] influence of the world
[57:11] because saints says no i've invested too
[57:13] much to make you what you are
[57:15] and now you're leaving me i'm not going
[57:17] to make it that easy on you
[57:20] but if you're an elect of god if you're
[57:23] chosen of god and god's called you to
[57:26] where you are now
[57:28] there's not a thing the devil can do
[57:30] that god can't undo
[57:38] so israel is now
[57:41] being chased two million people
[57:44] is now being chased by the egyptians
[57:49] and they're in hot pursuit after them
[57:51] chariots of horses
[57:54] it was the bible says and he took 600
[57:57] chosen chariots in chapter 14
[58:00] in exodus and he took 600 chosen
[58:03] chariots and all the chariots of egypt
[58:06] and captains over every one of them
[58:10] chosen chariots
[58:14] he chose like one brother says you know
[58:17] satan chooses certain demons
[58:21] to go after you
[58:27] your your fight is different than my
[58:29] fight
[58:30] your devil is different than my devil
[58:33] that's the reason why i could never be
[58:35] in a position to criticize anyone
[58:39] because what you may have trouble
[58:41] overcoming might be different than what
[58:43] i'm having trouble overcoming
[58:46] because the devil knows exactly how to
[58:49] kind of your weak spots
[58:52] so he chooses 600 chosen chariots in
[58:56] all the chariots of egypt and captains
[58:59] over every one of them and the lord
[59:02] hardened the heart of pharaoh the king
[59:04] of egypt and he pursued after the
[59:06] children of israel and the children of
[59:08] israel
[59:08] went out with a high hand
[59:13] and when pharaoh drew nigh the children
[59:15] of israel lifted up their eyes and
[59:17] behold the egyptians
[59:18] marched after them and they were so
[59:21] afraid and the children of israel cried
[59:23] unto the lord
[59:24] now think about the situation that
[59:26] they're in
[59:27] the children of israel had just left
[59:29] egypt and now before them
[59:31] is the red sea
[59:35] how are you going to cross 2 million
[59:37] people over the red sea
[59:39] behind them is the egyptian
[59:44] so god's saying you can't go back
[59:49] you have no choice but to go forward but
[59:52] there's a dilemma
[59:53] in front of you so now what are you
[59:55] going to do
[59:56] and you can't stand still
[1:00:02] the egyptians behind them the red seas
[1:00:04] before them they can't go back and they
[1:00:07] they don't know how they're going to
[1:00:08] handle what's in front of them
[1:00:12] what a predicament when i
[1:00:15] when when i first got converted i was in
[1:00:18] i was in a pickle i know i couldn't go
[1:00:22] back
[1:00:23] i didn't know what i didn't know what
[1:00:25] later laid ahead of me there was a lot
[1:00:28] of uncertainty
[1:00:30] but the one thing i knew i trusted god
[1:00:34] because the same god that brought me out
[1:00:36] is the same god that could bring me in
[1:00:40] god doesn't go through all the trouble
[1:00:42] to bring you out
[1:00:43] and just to leave you by yourself
[1:00:52] and so the bible goes on and says and
[1:00:55] moses
[1:00:56] said unto the people fear ye
[1:01:00] not stand still
[1:01:04] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:01:08] sometimes it's not for you to come up
[1:01:10] with a solution
[1:01:12] don't try to figure it out sometimes you
[1:01:15] just gotta reach a point in your life
[1:01:17] and say lord
[1:01:18] i'm gonna stand still and wait for you
[1:01:20] to give me an
[1:01:21] answer to my prayers
[1:01:26] what am i supposed to do i'm in a
[1:01:28] perplexed situation
[1:01:30] i'm in a stage of confusion and the
[1:01:33] thing about our god
[1:01:34] he is not the author of confusion
[1:01:39] god is a god of order and no matter how
[1:01:43] complicated the situation is there's
[1:01:45] definitely a way out of it
[1:01:51] and god told moses we're gonna press
[1:01:54] forward there's a body of water
[1:01:59] in front of us he says we're gonna
[1:02:03] move forward right
[1:02:08] no matter what lays before you the
[1:02:10] circumstances of life no matter what
[1:02:12] you're coming across whether it's
[1:02:13] family situation job situation whatever
[1:02:16] you're
[1:02:17] mentally going through spiritually going
[1:02:19] through economically going through
[1:02:21] you're going to press forward
[1:02:27] i rather deal with the uncertainty that
[1:02:29] lays ahead of me
[1:02:30] than the devil that's behind me because
[1:02:33] the bible says be
[1:02:34] ye certain of god every step that i take
[1:02:38] i'm taking it in
[1:02:39] faith
[1:02:45] i left egypt there's nothing for me
[1:02:48] there
[1:02:51] now the bible says in the lord to them
[1:02:53] to moses
[1:02:54] why cry unto me speak unto the children
[1:02:56] of israel that
[1:02:58] they go forward
[1:03:01] now they came across the red sea
[1:03:06] and the bible says this and the angel of
[1:03:09] god which went before the camp of israel
[1:03:11] because it was an angel that was before
[1:03:12] the camp of israel
[1:03:14] removed and went behind them
[1:03:18] and the pillar of the cloud went from
[1:03:20] before their face
[1:03:22] and stood behind them
[1:03:28] i've been in situations before brother
[1:03:31] well i thought my boys had my back
[1:03:35] and i found out i was the only one
[1:03:37] standing by myself
[1:03:41] yeah i see that two o'clock i showed up
[1:03:43] i was the only one there
[1:03:46] i figured they were late they never
[1:03:47] showed up
[1:03:49] but let me tell you something this
[1:03:51] scripture is the epitome
[1:03:54] that you never stand by yourself
[1:03:57] and that god has your back
[1:04:03] that's the reason why i'm not worried
[1:04:04] about my past i'm only
[1:04:06] only focused on what lays ahead of me
[1:04:11] he said brother gene you did this you
[1:04:13] said this and you acted this way
[1:04:15] that was all in the past it's underneath
[1:04:17] the blood if god can't see it then i
[1:04:19] can't
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:23] so i press forward amen because he has
[1:04:26] my back
[1:04:27] and that's the only thing that that's
[1:04:28] the only thing that guy's required that
[1:04:30] you press
[1:04:32] forward no matter the adversity you
[1:04:35] press
[1:04:35] forward no matter the uncertainty you
[1:04:38] press forward
[1:04:39] no matter if you have the answers or not
[1:04:41] you press forward
[1:04:42] no matter what the challenge is you
[1:04:44] press forward
[1:04:47] you keep pressing forward keep pressing
[1:04:52] forward
[1:04:54] and god says there was a strong east
[1:04:56] wind
[1:04:58] that came overnight and that parted
[1:05:02] the the red sea and created a wall
[1:05:06] can you just i just sometimes i
[1:05:08] visualize myself there
[1:05:10] to really have meaning to what i'm
[1:05:11] reading this
[1:05:13] massive sea this wall
[1:05:17] that's built between like a wall of
[1:05:20] water that's built and a
[1:05:22] clear passage to cut through
[1:05:26] for two million people
[1:05:33] and because the cloud
[1:05:36] and the pillow fire was behind them
[1:05:39] the egyptian couldn't make out what was
[1:05:41] going on
[1:05:43] and god is and moses is standing there
[1:05:46] leading the people
[1:05:48] in every elect every two
[1:05:51] million every one was accounted for
[1:05:58] and those walls of judgment
[1:06:01] held back until
[1:06:04] every elect made it through
[1:06:10] you can't get there until i get there
[1:06:15] you can shout the victory once you get
[1:06:16] to the other side but you got to wait
[1:06:17] for me
[1:06:20] because i'm still part of the family
[1:06:25] we're all in this together like i was
[1:06:28] telling the church previously i said
[1:06:29] look when god took a family portrait i
[1:06:31] was right there
[1:06:35] i could show you look at my face right
[1:06:37] there you know how you when you tell
[1:06:38] when you try to take a family portrait
[1:06:39] there's a lot of people you want to make
[1:06:40] sure that your face is sewn
[1:06:44] so you can say yeah that's me right
[1:06:46] there i'm part of that family
[1:06:48] i'm part of the great family of god
[1:06:50] you're part of that family
[1:06:52] so god is taking inventory that's what
[1:06:54] the book of numbers are
[1:06:55] god is taking inventory and i've been
[1:06:57] accounted for you've been accounted for
[1:07:01] before you were born god says i've
[1:07:02] already accounted for you
[1:07:09] and the way that the way that that's
[1:07:12] been paved
[1:07:14] for the elect seat of god is
[1:07:17] only for the elect
[1:07:21] so the so the egyptians thought they
[1:07:23] were just you know they're like yeah we
[1:07:25] could cut through this too
[1:07:27] all all of the israelites they made it
[1:07:29] through
[1:07:31] and um the egyptians try to cut through
[1:07:34] they miss swimming practice and so you
[1:07:37] know they thought they'd be okay
[1:07:39] here they are walking through this in
[1:07:42] the water
[1:07:44] come crashing in
[1:07:48] with such force how dare they
[1:07:54] go down the path that's been ordained
[1:07:56] for god's elect
[1:07:59] right amen that path is for you
[1:08:04] brother brahm says if the he says the
[1:08:07] only way the devil could actually get to
[1:08:08] you he has to go he has to be baptized
[1:08:12] sealed go through the whole process and
[1:08:14] at which point he says you could call
[1:08:16] him brother
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:19] but until then that path is only
[1:08:21] reserved for god's elect
[1:08:26] so the children of israel they made it
[1:08:28] to the other side
[1:08:31] and in chapter 15 verse 1 they sang
[1:08:33] moses then saying moses the children of
[1:08:36] israel
[1:08:36] this song unto the lord and they spake
[1:08:39] saying i will sing unto the lord for he
[1:08:41] had triumphed
[1:08:42] gloriously the horse in the right and
[1:08:45] his riders
[1:08:45] he has thrown into the sea the lord is
[1:08:48] my strength and song
[1:08:50] and he's become my salvation they
[1:08:52] started having a jubilee
[1:08:54] let me tell you when you've gone through
[1:08:55] a trial and you come through a sunday
[1:08:58] service
[1:08:59] and what a week it's been and no one
[1:09:01] knows what you're going through
[1:09:02] and you're singing and you're shouting
[1:09:04] you're not impressing the people around
[1:09:06] you
[1:09:06] you're giving god the glory because only
[1:09:08] you know
[1:09:10] the week that you've gone through you
[1:09:13] wouldn't be sitting here
[1:09:14] if it wasn't for god who carried you
[1:09:16] through
[1:09:17] so when i go to church i have no one to
[1:09:20] impress
[1:09:21] no one to show but to say lord i'm only
[1:09:24] here because of your grace
[1:09:30] when i lift up my hands and i close my
[1:09:32] eyes i'm not looking to impress people
[1:09:34] i may not look the best when i'm
[1:09:36] worshiping but i'm giving god the best
[1:09:38] of my worship
[1:09:42] because i know what my week has been
[1:09:44] like i know the conversations i've been
[1:09:46] a part of
[1:09:47] i know the trials i know the strife i
[1:09:50] know the challenges
[1:09:51] and for me to have made it through that
[1:09:52] week it's only by god's grace alone
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:01] moses understood that
[1:10:04] his sister miriam in verse 20 miriam the
[1:10:08] prophetess
[1:10:09] the sister of aaron took a timbrel in
[1:10:12] her hand
[1:10:13] and all the women went out after her
[1:10:15] with timbers and with dances
[1:10:17] and miriam answered them sing ye to the
[1:10:20] lord for
[1:10:21] he had triumphed gloriously gloriously
[1:10:24] his the horse and his writers hath he
[1:10:26] triumphed
[1:10:27] uh has he thrown into the sea
[1:10:30] yes they're just man what what church
[1:10:34] services it must have been
[1:10:37] they took out the tambourine they
[1:10:40] started beating the tambourine
[1:10:42] they started singing they started
[1:10:44] shouting they could care less who saw
[1:10:46] who didn't see who
[1:10:47] who was talking because the people that
[1:10:49] talk and they're the ones that should be
[1:10:50] singing and worshiping too
[1:10:56] and here's the thing while all this
[1:10:58] jubilee was happening
[1:11:00] the devil was stewing up he was
[1:11:03] mad what a victory
[1:11:08] the church of god just came out of
[1:11:14] and in the middle of the worship
[1:11:16] literally in the same verse
[1:11:18] down in the same chapter in the same
[1:11:20] chapter moses brought israel from
[1:11:22] the red sea and they went out into the
[1:11:24] wilderness of sure and they
[1:11:26] went there three days in the wilderness
[1:11:28] and found no water
[1:11:31] so they just come out of their eyes god
[1:11:34] is good
[1:11:35] god is great praise the lord the devil
[1:11:38] comes around
[1:11:39] smack you in your face
[1:11:44] you gotta you you always gotta be on
[1:11:46] guard
[1:11:49] i say lord thank you for such a
[1:11:50] wonderful church service
[1:11:52] i need you on monday morning
[1:11:56] the devil don't like sunday services he
[1:11:59] doesn't like it when you beat him over
[1:12:00] the head
[1:12:01] he doesn't like when you slap him around
[1:12:03] he's waiting for that opportunity
[1:12:08] and those sooner when they came out of
[1:12:09] this high point this edification they're
[1:12:11] so excited they're so victorious
[1:12:14] the bible says in verse 23 and when they
[1:12:16] came tomorrow
[1:12:17] they could not drink of the waters of
[1:12:19] mary for they were bitter
[1:12:20] therefore the name of it was called was
[1:12:22] mara and the people murmured against
[1:12:24] moses saying
[1:12:25] what shall we drink talk about it
[1:12:30] now i can i have questions so
[1:12:33] i the lord doesn't have to bear with me
[1:12:34] because when i get over that i got tons
[1:12:36] of questions
[1:12:37] but the people saw all these things
[1:12:39] happen
[1:12:41] and you talk about a little drink of
[1:12:42] water and now you want to have an uproar
[1:12:46] god just crushed your enemy with a sea
[1:12:48] of water
[1:12:50] and you just want a little thirst and
[1:12:51] now you want to put it out on the
[1:12:52] prophet
[1:12:54] all right
[1:12:57] so this is important and so god
[1:13:01] tells moses there's a tree cut it down
[1:13:04] cast it into the water and it becomes
[1:13:06] sweet
[1:13:07] and that happens
[1:13:11] in the interest of time
[1:13:14] the people gets hungry god provides
[1:13:17] quail for them
[1:13:18] right the people
[1:13:21] gets hungry gods provide a manner for
[1:13:25] them
[1:13:26] he's taking care of his people
[1:13:31] and now in chapter 17
[1:13:34] and all the congregation of the children
[1:13:36] of israel journeyed from the wilderness
[1:13:38] of sin
[1:13:39] after their journeys according to the
[1:13:40] commandments of the lord and pitch
[1:13:42] and referendum and there were no water
[1:13:46] and there were no there was no water for
[1:13:48] the people to drink
[1:13:50] word for the people did shied with moses
[1:13:52] and say give us water that we may drink
[1:13:54] and moses said unto them why child ye
[1:13:57] with me
[1:13:58] why do you tempt the lord
[1:14:02] so they just came out of
[1:14:05] egypt they felt
[1:14:08] the sense of victory then they
[1:14:11] get into a position where they become
[1:14:13] thirsty god
[1:14:14] blesses them and gives them water they
[1:14:17] get hungry god
[1:14:18] feeds them and so you find this internal
[1:14:22] battle that's occurring within the
[1:14:24] church
[1:14:27] so things are beginning to kind of stew
[1:14:29] a little bit
[1:14:30] the devil is a strategist he don't get
[1:14:34] you today he'll get you tomorrow
[1:14:36] don't get you this week he'll look out
[1:14:37] for you next week but he's always
[1:14:39] studying
[1:14:40] that's the reason why we got to find
[1:14:42] ourselves protected by god's words
[1:14:45] shielded it gotta be much more than just
[1:14:47] words saint
[1:14:48] you got to live and breathe by this word
[1:14:54] when you get up in the morning you don't
[1:14:55] know what your day's going to look like
[1:14:56] but you got to start your day with jesus
[1:14:58] christ
[1:15:00] every waking morning i start my my day
[1:15:02] with the prayer
[1:15:03] i start my day with the verse that's
[1:15:06] what brother gene does
[1:15:07] all right i know some people for my
[1:15:09] health reasons they start their day with
[1:15:11] the daily vitamins that's fine that's
[1:15:12] what you're supposed to do that's
[1:15:13] healthy for you
[1:15:14] but i need my spiritual vitamin
[1:15:18] because i don't know what the devil is
[1:15:20] gonna throw at me but whatever he throws
[1:15:21] at me
[1:15:22] i gotta know that greater is he that is
[1:15:24] in me than he that is in the world
[1:15:30] it's no joke out there saints the devil
[1:15:33] is badly
[1:15:33] for your soul
[1:15:38] so i'm taking god seriously i'm taking
[1:15:41] services seriously
[1:15:42] when i come to church i say lord i need
[1:15:44] something from you
[1:15:45] i want to receive something from you i
[1:15:47] want you to talk to me
[1:15:49] i want you to speak directly to my heart
[1:15:51] because i know this is a serious affair
[1:16:00] and so you have this battle that's
[1:16:01] brewing
[1:16:03] word for the people did child with moses
[1:16:06] and they went back he says what are you
[1:16:07] tempting the lord
[1:16:08] and the people thirsted there for water
[1:16:10] and the people murmured against moses
[1:16:12] and said wherefore is this that joshua
[1:16:16] that wherefore is this that has that
[1:16:18] thou has brought us up out of
[1:16:20] egypt the audacity
[1:16:24] to compare egypt and the taskmasters and
[1:16:27] what they came from
[1:16:28] to this is this what the message is
[1:16:32] about
[1:16:36] don't blame the message for some earthly
[1:16:39] demons that you're still working through
[1:16:42] all right
[1:16:43] don't blame god's words for little
[1:16:46] weaknesses in your life that you got to
[1:16:48] come overcome
[1:16:51] you can't compare this message to the
[1:16:53] things of the world
[1:16:56] amen to kill us in our children in our
[1:16:59] cattle with thirst
[1:17:01] and moses cried unto the lord and say
[1:17:03] what shall i do with these people
[1:17:05] for they be almost ready to stone me
[1:17:08] things got pretty serious
[1:17:10] i mean there was internal conflict
[1:17:13] people were thirsty
[1:17:14] so the church was in a weak state
[1:17:20] and the lord said unto moses go on
[1:17:22] before the people
[1:17:24] and take with thee of the elders and thy
[1:17:26] rod words
[1:17:27] that's modest the river take in thy hand
[1:17:29] and go
[1:17:31] behold i will stand before thee there
[1:17:33] upon the rocking orb
[1:17:34] and thou shalt smite the rock and there
[1:17:36] shall come out of it water
[1:17:38] water out of it that the people may
[1:17:40] drink and moses did so in the sight of
[1:17:42] the elders of israel
[1:17:43] and he called the name of the place masa
[1:17:45] and maraba because of the triding of the
[1:17:47] children of israel and because they
[1:17:49] tempted the lord saying
[1:17:51] is the lord among us or not
[1:17:59] eyewitnesses to all the miracles of god
[1:18:05] and god says sorry moses is what i want
[1:18:06] you to do we're going to give the people
[1:18:08] water
[1:18:10] and while all this is happening this in
[1:18:13] turn of conflict in the weakness
[1:18:15] of where the people's at we finally come
[1:18:18] to verse 8.
[1:18:20] then came amalek and fought israel
[1:18:29] why the church was now in a
[1:18:32] weak and vulnerable state
[1:18:38] so amalek says this is an opportunity
[1:18:40] for us to take advantage
[1:18:42] of this situation
[1:18:46] it's in that weak moment brother man
[1:18:49] puts it this way in the church ages
[1:18:50] he says and he says in that unguarded
[1:18:55] moment satan planted his seed of
[1:18:58] complete
[1:18:59] ruination in that unguarded moment
[1:19:05] because as long as we're fighting
[1:19:07] ourselves
[1:19:08] then the devil could sneak in
[1:19:12] not only just amongst the church amongst
[1:19:14] families
[1:19:17] it's so important that we build a
[1:19:20] standard
[1:19:21] that we fortify ourselves behind god's
[1:19:23] words
[1:19:27] so amalek comes in
[1:19:30] and here's the thing this was an
[1:19:32] unprovoked attack
[1:19:36] just because of who they were
[1:19:41] just because of who you are the devil
[1:19:43] already don't like you
[1:19:49] people look at you it's like i don't
[1:19:50] like the way she smiles
[1:19:53] i don't like the way she's always in a
[1:19:54] good mood he seems to be always positive
[1:19:58] well how else do you expect me to be
[1:20:01] all right i know what god has done in my
[1:20:04] life
[1:20:06] i know what he's brought me through i
[1:20:08] know what i had to overcome
[1:20:10] i know what i went through
[1:20:13] and so i'm not your my happiness
[1:20:16] is not depending upon your judgment or
[1:20:19] opinion
[1:20:20] it's what god says about me
[1:20:27] unprovoked
[1:20:31] and so you find that in verse 9 and
[1:20:34] moses said unto joshua
[1:20:37] choose us out men and go fight
[1:20:40] with amalek the prophet
[1:20:43] couldn't choose men but joshua being the
[1:20:46] type of the holy spirit
[1:20:47] chose those men to go to battle
[1:20:53] so he chooses a group of people to go to
[1:20:57] battle
[1:20:58] let me say when you go to war you're
[1:21:00] going forward
[1:21:02] god tells you i have not given you the
[1:21:04] spirit of fear so that way you could
[1:21:05] fear again
[1:21:09] so you find he says i will stand on the
[1:21:11] top of the hill with the rod
[1:21:13] of god in my hand
[1:21:18] so the battle set the devil thought you
[1:21:21] know what
[1:21:22] in this week's state i'll take advantage
[1:21:23] of him
[1:21:26] only you know when your moments of
[1:21:28] weakness occurs
[1:21:32] and if you don't have an altar not in
[1:21:36] this building but i'm talking about in
[1:21:37] your house
[1:21:39] i'm somebody in your job yes i'm
[1:21:41] somebody in your car
[1:21:43] when you're by yourself how can you
[1:21:46] actually stand
[1:21:47] if you don't have an altar
[1:21:55] we're living in a time where it's going
[1:21:58] to become more and more
[1:21:59] apparent who you are
[1:22:03] what you believe what you stand for
[1:22:06] there's no hiding under a tree
[1:22:08] there's no hiding in the masses
[1:22:12] and i for if i'm with you if i if i were
[1:22:14] you i i got to be prepared to make a
[1:22:16] declaration
[1:22:17] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:22:22] lord
[1:22:29] so amalek came and fought with israel
[1:22:34] with the intent to kill them
[1:22:37] to destroy them
[1:22:41] the battle is different for you and i
[1:22:42] because we're not talking about
[1:22:43] something physical
[1:22:45] as much as it is spiritual
[1:22:48] people could go to church just to get
[1:22:50] their religious fix on
[1:22:52] what did you do this weekend i went to
[1:22:53] church
[1:22:55] and that's not a badge of honor
[1:22:58] living that life and going to church is
[1:23:00] two different things
[1:23:08] and moses said unto joshua choose us out
[1:23:11] man
[1:23:12] and go out fight with mla tomorrow i
[1:23:16] will stand
[1:23:17] on the top of the hill with the rod of
[1:23:19] god in my hand
[1:23:21] so joshua did as moses said to him and
[1:23:25] fought with
[1:23:26] amalek and moses aaron
[1:23:29] and er went up to the top of the hill
[1:23:34] and it came to pass when moses held up
[1:23:38] his hand
[1:23:39] that israel prevailed
[1:23:42] and when he let down his hand amalek
[1:23:46] prevailed
[1:23:52] in every situation i am looking to enter
[1:23:55] that situation with uplifting hands
[1:24:02] i look silly in the car by myself doing
[1:24:04] this
[1:24:06] without but i don't care
[1:24:09] i got demons i gotta fight and i'm not
[1:24:12] waiting just to get the church
[1:24:14] for the preacher to preach a good
[1:24:15] message for me to have a winning victory
[1:24:17] when i have 66 books in the bible that i
[1:24:20] could read myself
[1:24:21] as well and receive the same victory
[1:24:27] i could be in my office with my hands up
[1:24:33] i'm in my house walking around
[1:24:37] giving the lord the victory it might be
[1:24:40] foolishness to the world
[1:24:42] but to me it's everything
[1:24:46] hallelujah it's very symbolic
[1:24:51] i'm learning this more and more when my
[1:24:53] baby wants me to pick him up they throw
[1:24:54] their hands up you want daddy pick you
[1:24:58] up
[1:24:59] you have to stay much
[1:25:03] that gesture i as a father know exactly
[1:25:05] what i need to do
[1:25:07] when you throw your hands up they say
[1:25:09] lord
[1:25:10] i don't have the words he already knows
[1:25:12] what to do he knows how to lift you up
[1:25:14] out of the situation that you're in
[1:25:18] lord here's my hands lift me up to god
[1:25:22] raise me out of the situation that i'm
[1:25:24] in
[1:25:30] he can lift you up he has the strength
[1:25:34] he has the means he has the will and not
[1:25:37] only that but he wants to lift you up
[1:25:43] praise god and as long as moses had his
[1:25:47] hands up
[1:25:49] there was victory in the camp
[1:25:56] sometimes it doesn't feel like it
[1:26:00] but god is still victorious
[1:26:04] there's a scripture and you probably
[1:26:05] know better than i do soldier but where
[1:26:07] there was a battle
[1:26:08] and it happened at the mountaintop at
[1:26:10] the top of the mountain
[1:26:12] and the children of israel was
[1:26:13] victorious and people was like oh it's
[1:26:15] because
[1:26:15] they were at the top of the mountain and
[1:26:18] that's the reason why
[1:26:19] and god says let's bring the battle to
[1:26:20] the valley
[1:26:23] that's right the same god that's on the
[1:26:26] mountaintop
[1:26:27] is the same god that can meet you in the
[1:26:30] valley
[1:26:31] yay though i walk to the valley of the
[1:26:33] shadow of death
[1:26:35] i will fear no evil for thyroid and thy
[1:26:38] stuff to comfort me
[1:26:44] he's just as much god in the mountaintop
[1:26:47] as his god in the valley
[1:26:51] when i'm in my lowest point in my life i
[1:26:54] still declare him to be
[1:26:56] god
[1:27:00] the hebrew children understood that the
[1:27:02] king says i'm going to sow you into
[1:27:04] the fiery furnace and they says you know
[1:27:06] what king you could throw us into the
[1:27:08] fiery furnace
[1:27:08] and we're going to believe god but even
[1:27:11] if he doesn't come on the scene
[1:27:14] they said we still will not bow down to
[1:27:16] the image
[1:27:20] the other man says i could i could
[1:27:22] preach chilling today and a thousand
[1:27:24] people die tomorrow he says i still
[1:27:26] preach healing tomorrow
[1:27:31] and it came to pass when moses held up
[1:27:33] his hand
[1:27:35] that israel prevailed and when he let
[1:27:37] down his hand
[1:27:39] amalek prevailed he was observing that
[1:27:44] and moses hands were heavy
[1:27:49] now you try to keep your hands up like
[1:27:52] this for a while
[1:27:56] that's exactly right
[1:28:01] i remember when i was uh in college
[1:28:04] uh there was this speaker that was
[1:28:06] talking to us this
[1:28:07] motivational speaker this was part of
[1:28:08] our graduation
[1:28:10] and uh if i remember correctly
[1:28:14] he was trying to see who could stay like
[1:28:15] this the longest
[1:28:19] and uh so we all kind of stood in that
[1:28:22] position
[1:28:23] and uh next thing you know
[1:28:27] you start start doing exercise
[1:28:30] because you're trying to ease it up and
[1:28:33] i'm right here
[1:28:34] and it was really most of the guys were
[1:28:36] kind of sitting here because we could
[1:28:37] shoulder this by ourselves
[1:28:39] saw a couple of the ladies they started
[1:28:41] locking arms
[1:28:43] and i'm right here my arms halfway down
[1:28:45] ah
[1:28:46] and i'm watching this and i'm like are
[1:28:48] they allowed to do this and he's like
[1:28:52] so next thing you know i'm like hey come
[1:28:54] on over here so i locked arms
[1:28:57] with this guy locked on with this person
[1:29:00] next thing you know you like you felt so
[1:29:03] relieved
[1:29:06] and then a little circle started to form
[1:29:10] we started supporting one another that's
[1:29:12] all right
[1:29:13] that's all right yeah this uh this
[1:29:15] football player
[1:29:17] he was kind of by himself he wanted to
[1:29:19] prove a point
[1:29:21] meanwhile i'm all relaxed i like man
[1:29:23] come on man you can join us man you
[1:29:25] don't need to be like staying like that
[1:29:26] yeah
[1:29:26] you could just you could join us
[1:29:30] he was adamant the circle was almost
[1:29:32] done it was just it was just him
[1:29:34] i like you really want to do this he
[1:29:37] persisted he persisted
[1:29:39] but like you said gravity
[1:29:44] gravity is no joke
[1:29:47] he was turning he was just turning red
[1:29:49] and he was just kind of he was shaking
[1:29:50] i like bro you i mean your girl's right
[1:29:53] here too man you could just
[1:29:54] you could join us i mean it's okay and
[1:29:57] he reluctantly
[1:30:00] when he locked arms he was so relieved
[1:30:07] the lesson that we learned is like we're
[1:30:09] all in this together
[1:30:12] as stubborn as that person wanted to be
[1:30:14] be patient
[1:30:17] because they're still part of the group
[1:30:20] wait on them pray for them encourage
[1:30:22] them
[1:30:22] be there with them because you didn't
[1:30:25] know how one time you stood by yourself
[1:30:28] but then when you started to learn that
[1:30:30] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:30:32] from all the righteousness that i need
[1:30:34] my brother as much as he needs me
[1:30:36] then it changes the game
[1:30:42] and moses hands were heavy and they took
[1:30:44] a stone and put it under him
[1:30:46] and he sat on an aaron and earth stayed
[1:30:48] up his hands
[1:30:50] the one on one side and the other on the
[1:30:53] other side
[1:30:55] and the hands were steady until the
[1:30:57] going down of the sun
[1:31:01] that is very symbolic because you just
[1:31:03] think for that moment's a dual meaning
[1:31:05] they kept his hands up until
[1:31:09] the setting of the sun
[1:31:13] so this bride will continue to have
[1:31:15] victory
[1:31:17] throughout the ages until the setting
[1:31:20] of the sun
[1:31:23] your victory is not you it's god's
[1:31:26] victory
[1:31:28] it's god's leadership it's god's ability
[1:31:31] to work a miracle in your life
[1:31:35] and when joshua saw that they rallied
[1:31:38] behind
[1:31:40] and the bible says in joshua discomfited
[1:31:44] amalek and in his people
[1:31:47] with the edge of the sword and the lord
[1:31:50] said unto moses
[1:31:52] write this for a memorial in a book
[1:31:57] we're reading it that's right and
[1:32:00] rehearse it
[1:32:01] in the years of joshua because when
[1:32:04] moses goes
[1:32:04] joshua's going to pick this up for our
[1:32:08] utterly put out the remembrance of
[1:32:10] amalek from under heaven
[1:32:18] let me go off a quick side note the
[1:32:21] reason why it's so important to read
[1:32:23] this book
[1:32:23] write it for memorial the bible says
[1:32:27] there are rose of pharaoh who knew not
[1:32:30] joseph
[1:32:35] there arose a pharaoh who knew not
[1:32:38] joseph
[1:32:40] the reason why is because
[1:32:43] before joseph uh had died he was the
[1:32:46] right hand
[1:32:47] of pharaoh and he was a blessing to his
[1:32:51] brothers because
[1:32:52] they now are under his kind of domain if
[1:32:55] you will
[1:32:55] and they're reaping the benefits and the
[1:32:58] egyptian
[1:32:59] had a ton of respect for joseph
[1:33:02] and so as they kind of as they
[1:33:04] interacted
[1:33:05] they kept on talking about joseph so
[1:33:09] when joseph died
[1:33:11] they kept on talking about him a wave of
[1:33:14] generation rose up
[1:33:15] and perhaps the name of joseph was
[1:33:17] discussed less
[1:33:19] but they still knew enough to keep their
[1:33:21] respect
[1:33:22] so another group of generation rules are
[1:33:25] both egyptians
[1:33:26] in the jews and the conversation about
[1:33:28] joseph
[1:33:29] becomes less and so
[1:33:33] apparently after generation after
[1:33:35] generation
[1:33:37] they stopped talking about joseph and
[1:33:40] the pharaoh
[1:33:41] rose up amongst them who knew not
[1:33:45] joseph
[1:33:48] they kept from keeping the name of
[1:33:50] joseph alive
[1:33:53] so that's the reason why it's important
[1:33:55] to teach your kids
[1:33:57] about jesus christ to teach your kids
[1:34:01] about the stories in the scripture to
[1:34:03] teach your kids
[1:34:04] about these experiences so that way they
[1:34:06] can teach their kids
[1:34:08] and their kids and their kids so as long
[1:34:10] as the lord tarries
[1:34:11] the name of jehovah always remains in
[1:34:14] the lips of your children
[1:34:19] keeping the name of jesus alive
[1:34:22] they may not know nothing about this
[1:34:24] bible they have no idea
[1:34:26] that there's an empty tomb but the only
[1:34:29] recollection that they have of god jesus
[1:34:31] is the way you and i live our lives
[1:34:36] and what testimony you bring forward
[1:34:41] so the bible says rehearse it
[1:34:44] and moses built an altar and called
[1:34:47] the name of it jehovah nisi
[1:34:52] the lord is my banner
[1:34:57] the lord is my banner
[1:35:03] i'm going to rally behind the name of
[1:35:05] jehovah
[1:35:07] because he goes into battle for me i'm
[1:35:10] going to stand with god
[1:35:12] i'm not ashamed of this gospel i am
[1:35:15] called by god
[1:35:16] i'm chosen i'm elected you're chosen
[1:35:20] you're called you're elected you're
[1:35:21] predestinated
[1:35:23] these are things that the scriptures
[1:35:25] talks about you in your family
[1:35:30] and then closing the bible says for he
[1:35:32] said because the lord has sworn
[1:35:35] that the lord will have war with amalek
[1:35:39] from generation to generation
[1:35:46] your enemies become god's enemies
[1:35:51] generations after generation you pass on
[1:35:54] the name of jesus christ
[1:35:55] and god's going to continue to watch
[1:35:56] over your generation
[1:35:58] and continue to make war with the devil

[1:36:06] no place with your family amen no place
[1:36:09] in this church
[1:36:10] no place in your job no place in your
[1:36:13] car
