foreign [Music] promise keeper light in the dark my God one more time we make good promise keeper light in the my God my God that is who you are praise the Lord Hallelujah amen that song becomes more real all the time praise the Lord I had a Psalm I wanted to read with you but let's let's turn to Psalms 91. this was a little portion this was a little portion of our devotion earlier in the week and I remember when covet first came out this this Psalm was everywhere everybody was reading this song and I got to thinking me and my wife were talking I think it was last week talking about the children of Israel how they had to fight all these amorites and amalekites and perizzites and all these different things but now we fight hepatitis bursitis tendinitis all these irises amen diseases everywhere so that threw my mind to a quote [Music] [Music] praise the lord well that threw my mind to a quote it's a very short one so I want to read that before we read this Psalm because it made this song become more real to me says you think cancer is something the Bible said there is coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh and buzzers will eat off their carcasses before they even die cancer is a toothache to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the Seal of God that's our promise right there that's what we're striving for now to get in in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike oh how good the dispensation of time fullness of time the inheritance and that right there it just made Psalms 91 more real to me when we see what we're facing the different things coming upon the Earth and and we think that these these are not natural diseases these are man-made diseases and God will destroy those who destroys the Earth amen so Psalms 91. he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty now we can thank God for the Seal of God I will serve the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in whom I will trust surely he shall deliver thee from the spirit of the fowl and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou Trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at that right hand but it not it shall not come neither we think about that during the time of covert thousands die but it shall not come neither we have to believe God whatever comes our way his word cannot fail we must believe God that's about his we won't go any further almighty God this is a great hour Lord God that you have called us into and we come humbly and reverently before you Lord God knowing father we have an opportunity to

I believe we are the children of God I believe that all of us can say how have we found Grace in the sight of God and so I said thou thou shalters take knowledge of me seeing I'm a stranger you know we're all strangers we're all born shaped and iniquity and sin but but God's called us out Amen in verse 11 it says and Boaz answered and said unto her it has fully been shown me all thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since since thy death of thy husbands and that hell the house left thy father and thy mother and land and Nativity and their art common to the people which thou knowest not they're uh here there uh therefore verse 12 it says the Lord recompense thy work on that full reward be given unto thee of thy Lord God of Israel unto thy Wings Thou Art cometh of the of to trust you

for me when he reached out his hands for you this morning I want to bring you back to a place where the devil wants to tell you you know you've done this and you've done that but I want to remind you who you are this morning I remind you more you're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus you're not just coming through this world passing through but you've gotten purpose and a place to be here you're not just filling up air this morning you're not just taking up oxygen this morning it's not just for the minister this morning the Evangelist this morning it's for every one of us this morning we're not just riding down the road just to be another day it's another god-given day to make it count oh every time you wake up it's a time to make it count for the Lord not just on Sunday not just on Wednesdays but every single day you get up when you're at the gas pump or you're in the the you're eating lunch with your fellow workers this morning wherever you're at you are shining the light from this Darkness oh they know something's different they know something's in your life has become reality you know not just to say I believe a message the devil knows the message is he knows the quotes he trembles at it but I tell you what it's the life behind the name it's the life behind the name that makes the devil tremble he knows where you stand in your life he knows behind closed doors today oh but it's the life behind the name but think about it brother Brown said he said that the weakest Christian gets on their knees and the devil trembles think about a light that surrendered to God think about a wife that's in the word of God daily it's a daily dying out it's a daily walk I tell you it's a rugged it's a tough life but I tell you greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world oh we're fighting every devil every spirit in the world but he's called you out he's put you in Heavenly places today in Christ Jesus oh and you have a purpose this morning young kids you have a purpose when the devil says you can't have the Holy Ghost you say it's for me all the promise is like the ocean through a pipe he said he wants to give it to you more than that oh think about the ocean through a two inch pipe all right oh he wants to give you more than that he wants to refill you this morning if your Joy's gone ask God to restore it this morning oh I'll tell you we ain't even got any descriptions brother Jack we're going to go through here oh praise God but like what she said verse 10 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said she said unto him why have I found Grace in thy eyes have you ever asked that you ever rode down the road maybe it's only me this morning I'll be like yeah why do I find Grace I came from a broke up home that didn't believe God think about it I come from the the worst of the worst sinners but I tell you I'm like Paul I'm the least of these disciples this morning but I tell you your father in Heaven chose you from the foundation of the world and his grace he went to the junkyard have you ever been to a junkyard or a trash can before and you drop off his smelly you know they come back and they they you just look at all the trash and you you look at the trash in some reason he picked that piece of trash up me and you today and he put He just picked you up and said hey brother Jack that shoe right here that shoe he didn't pick up all the trash he didn't pick up all the trash he picked up you and me this morning he didn't pick up the church over here he picked you up this morning he gave you the spirit and the truth all these same people free this morning he said family's free I'll tell you what I'm so thankful I'm so thankful to come from the Myra clay where a family didn't believe the truth but when that eagle heard the voice it was caged up one day oh I tell you I think the devil cages us up sometimes in our life yes sir he wants to cage you up this morning he wants to cage you up and find a new job or about paying your next bill but do you know who your daddy is do you know he owns a thousand a catalog A Thousand Hills oh so we were in we read brother Dandy's the other day and this guy was saying this brother owns this and this guy owns this and man he's so rich I said do you know who my daddy is you don't want my father owns oh he created this world he said I'm going to prepare a place oh think about it we were on the water the other day eating with my wife the other night and I was sitting there eating and I said honey I just catch me at the River of Life on that day all right I'm out of water I'll tell you it's tempting to move here brother John brother I love Floridians have arrived he said that's the Northerners I said brother don't call us the northerner because we're from the south brother Solomon we're from the south praise the Lord y'all know how to Worship the Lord praise the Lord but I thought about Ruth's life and I'm just going to bring us home today try to see if we can get through this about how how comparing us to Ruth and comparing us that we had to have a kinsman redeemer in our day and we we had to have a uh the nearest Kinsmen redeem us and that's why he had to send the son the most innocent Oneness the sister was talking about the blood right and I started to think about the blood and I started to weep and I thought about if it wasn't for them if it weren't for the blind brother Abraham even said in one place that the blood went before him one time and he started talking about a situation and he wanted to rebuke this uh this lady that was drinking and she was ate up and all of a sudden he said okay said I don't know how my family can live in this situation you ever been in that situation I've been in my heart where I say oh Lord I don't know how my kids can live in this mess but then he said God started bringing back his sins and all of a sudden he said a blood of a Mist a bumper of blood started coming around his life and he said he just made them think about the purchase price they didn't think about what Jesus Christ did for us it's nothing young kids it's nothing we're going to do on that day when we enter in it's going to be paid and Authority paid it's by the blood of Jesus Christ think about it when we get on that day he said that people would say I've done this in your name I've done that brother Jack there ain't enough that we've ever done in his name I tell you I just want to narrow at his feet and say Lord I love you Lord oh there ain't nothing I could say I drove this smile or I flew here or I've done that I just want to lay at his feet and say Lord ain't nothing that I've done but I do love you Lord as the prophet said if you send my soul to hell I'll still serve your gods or when that becomes a revelation in your life oh no devils in Hell could keep you bound oh we got to realize that today he said well I have a Grace in nine eyes that's us today that they'll show us take knowledge of me seeing I'm a stranger and Boaz answered and said unto her it has fully been shown me all that have done it today mother-in-law think about it she came from Moab think about it apart of Psalm 68 talks about Moab was a pot wash it was just a just think about you're seeing like a a dirty sink with a bunch of dishes and what's left over it's just dirt and crime she came from the dirtiest of lots era she grew up in in she was around sin she was shaped in iniquity but the near kiss me she lost her husband if you go to verse chapter one she lost her father she lost she lost her father her father-in-law she lost third into her children and here she is she's just wondering both of her and her daughter Oprah was just wondering think about it yeah she was just wondering they she came up the roof think about think about where she was in her life but verse 2 she said in verse 12 I meant verse 2 it says the Lord right represents thy Work and a full reward be given to the Lord God of Israel under those wings Thou Art come to trust then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for thou has comforted me and for thou that has spoken friendly unto my handmaid and though I've been that I'd be not likened to thine handmaids verse 14 is where I want to go to this morning all right and Boaz said unto her at Meal Time think about this no way these Servants of his are thinking like what are you doing inviting this lady to the mill all right all right what are you doing have you ever looked around people and you're you're you're running around and you're like Hey Brother Jack why is he praying for that sister that's what the devil wants to tell you why is he why is he why is he talking to that brother he's far out in sin but you know what he reached on his hand for you all right he stopped by your house one day always stop by your place one day but he says in Boaz said unto her at Meal Time come you there eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers think about the Reapers oh and he reached her Parts coin and suddenly he said and she did eat and was suffice so where I got this from when he reached his hand down to you all right oh think about it but Boaz reached his hand in feather all right he reached over the table and said hey take Heat this will suffice you oh but this message in the word of God it will suffice you every clothed every word in the scripture will suffice you it will carry you through every dark hell every enemy into fate Satan the word of God we'll defeat Satan anywhere or any place anyhow oh we don't fight them I tell you do we use it enough all right do we use the word of God are we in the word of God are we on Facebook what's our average time on Facebook I don't know why I'm going here but what's our average time you know you can look up the average time two hours seven hours ten hours but what if we looked at the average time on the word of God when we looked at the average time of the word of God five minutes two minutes oh on the way out the door is to grab my biscuits think about this morning but how long have we you know what you wanted to fake Satan I tell you I believe it it says faith come by hearing the word of God I tell you our faith is low because we don't fill it up enough we don't say in the word enough and I'm preaching to me today I'm not just preaching to you I'll tell you what I said Lord I don't want to say that Lord help us all verse 15 and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying oh listen to this let her glean even among the cheese that approach her not think about it he was a protector as well always like hey Reapers let her clean think about it and he goes he says and he risen up in verse 16 and he let fall he said let fall also some handfuls of purpose for and leave them not she may glean them and rebuke her not oh I believe God is dropping off a handful of purpose this morning every time you come in the house of God he's given you a handful of purpose oh not just on Sunday or Wednesday but every day of your life he's dropping handfuls of purpose he's giving you quotes and scriptures and saying hey keep pressing on amen oh keep pressing on oh I'll tell you we're like boy we're like Ruth today think about it we're thinking about Boaz the Kinsmen but the near Kinsmen have to come we had a near Kinsman in our day amen Jesus Christ think about it I thought wrote these notes down I was writing these down I put she starts the story as worthless and ends the story as well [Music] oh she starts as a pulper but she ends as a princess oh think about it today she starts the story as bitterness but is the story is being blessed oh think about it oh she starts the story as a widow but she ends it with a wedding oh think about it today oh you came worthless the devil wants to tell you you're worthless but I tell you you are in Heavenly places today oh your name is Miss Jesus Christ oh if we can realize our Authority today oh we're more than conquerors we puke every head brother brother uh brother Brown said another quote he said you need to tell the devil to give it back stop giving thanks to the devil oh I tell you I was telling Rachel it's like Amazon think about it you order Amazon did they ask you to sign for the package they just drop it off think about it oh it ain't certified he just drop it off in the front door and we just gladly take it but where are you checking the name think about it you grab the package you set it down and you start to open it you don't even look at the name oh that's the same thing the devil does in our life he drops things off in our life and you don't even check your name oh you should put Miss Jesus Christ on top of it every saint of hell would tremble every every depression every whatever you have this morning would fall even he said even brother Solomon said it's a drop nothing will be a drop in the book of the Cancer all right he said if you would only believe all things are possible oh if we could just get to a place where we could Channel our minds and our soul to only believe oh but we just accept the devil's packages we just say hey devil drop them off we'll take it but you know what good the prophet said in one place he said he won't do anything with it until you get done with it he said he'll take it and let you take it right back how many times do we in our lives we want to figure out the situation how many times do we want to take the situation brother Jack when brother Solomon we take this situation and we say Lord let us figure it out and God will give it back to you well hold on hold on let me fix that no he says give it all to me oh he will take care of the situation oh but we want to fix this or we want to make this right or we want to do this but no brother Brown says hey just give it all to him and he will fix it I'm thankful for that I'm paraphrasing today but what a picture of Amazing Grace this picture Bud Brown says in the king's a redeemer he said now what we what what did we did they do he said they got married and through they got this great thing then Ruth was rewarded but by by getting Christ he says getting Boaz for her husband he said which the church is rewarded by the coming of the Lord when the lord of the Lord shall come he said that bright and cloudless morning were resting we're waiting the prophet said we're resting we're waiting oh I believe that every morning we should be looking for is coming he said that between that six to nine hours and I'll tell you why every day we should be looking for his coming you know what we're always going to fail young kids were always going to fall but I tell you to get up don't stay in the mug in the Comerica when you make up when you make a failure just repentance say God I move on those people in brother Brown's lines out here they were coming through the lines and they were repent and they would say well you didn't call him out for that sin he'd go well I didn't never saw that sin it must have been under the blood oh think about it oh we just need to go let the devil start beating you up sometimes and say Lord I'm sorry I've done this I've done this Lord but God's grace is sufficient oh he's called us out this morning Barb says and God has provided a way he said no there's coming back he said have heard to come over and sit under the shade and eat some of the food with us oh if we had to put some emphasis on that notice Boaz looks upon her he says he sings She's singing it was a victorious woman big virtuous woman he says that she surely must been a Holiness oh so he walked around and said to all the Reapers he said now you brother says this when this young lady is coming behind you not letting her know it said but now when she's getting behind you every once in a while drop an extra handful so she can get it oh think about it that very service you missed could be the very handful purpose that you need that your kids need that your grandkids need oh I tell you he changed Moses in five minutes what could he do to you what can he do to your kids oh there's not a service we should try to miss if we can make it oh I'll tell you I understand if you're sick and you got to stream God bless you but if you can get out of the house of God there's been days brother Jack I ain't feel good Rachel's like I'm going to church and I'll sit there I'll just be honest and I'll say well and I'll say hold on honey let's go there's been time we go out of town we were somewhere and I we were doing some we were traveling night for service and she said what do you want to do tonight I said well let's go home I did I she'll tell you we're driving home all of a sudden I said oh let's go to church we had we had Sunday morning but we found the Sunday night service I'm not saying you had to do that but I tell you if it's inside of you you want to be around Believers you want to be around the cream of the crop you want to be where the devil can get off your life oh I tell you what that's where you find victory we don't get our Phillips at work we don't get our Phillips at the gas station but we get our Phillips in the house of God I tell you what we need more Phillips than Jesus Christ oh we got too many people in the message that drive by and say well I'll listen to this tape that's all I'll do I don't know why I'm going here but we just listen to a tape if that's good enough you know the devil uses that I have family or even their own family and things they get there and say well we'll just listen to this so we'll listen to that tape it's fine to listen to the tapes I'm not saying it's wrong with the tapes but but just to do that only and before you know it they're they're the devil's got them caught up at home or at their house on the couch in their pajamas think about it and before you know it they're they're sipping on coffee they're eating a piece of cake from last week and before you know it they're just sitting there not even a handful of purpose because there's something about when we get together oh when the spirit moves and brother Solomon brings the presence of God I tell you what there's something about our skin together oh and it says more so as the days approaching about it I tell you what we were we're losing uh we're losing a generation that's losing the auction to go to church I've traveled to church to church the church and every week we traveling and I say Lord it just breaks my heart to see the unction gone daddy we could stay at home and stream wow oh what coven has tried to do to us virus what the Delta virus what the American Airlines virus has done to us oh every week it's a new virus it's the Southwest virus think about it oh every week is going to be a new virus but you know what we serve regardless greater than all them viruses every sickness you've got because we are more than conquerors isn't it funny you go to the airport brother Jack and you stand in line and I told Rachel this that when we first covered hit we were traveled the most we've ever traveled all right I thought well Chris is the craziest one he'll preach he'll go wherever there's Coleman in the land call Chris ask Rachel I got the I got the first one I tell you they said there was covered I was like hey I'll be the test I was in Florida I should tell you I was coming through Florida she said honey why you got your jacket on I said I don't know it's cold she says 80 degrees out and my temperature was up but I tell you what we still made it and I'm not saying it's not a real virus I'm not saying that you know I'm not putting a b little in the virus but I'll tell you we need to put God higher than that virus higher than every sickness your job everything you've got today greater is he oh I tell you we're not just passing through you need to claim your Authority today you are more than Sons and Daughters you're the child of the king you're a child of the king this morning rebuke every situation but I'll tell you how the devil can just take a situation and turn it so bad I'm way off my notes but he can take a situation and go to the airport and we look like dummies we walk up think about it and all of a sudden you got to stand five the lady would stop me and go son you need to step back there we got the stickers played every five feet or seven feet six feet but we're going into a sardine can man do you realize we're going into a sardine can and we're going to be two inches apart that's what the devil wants to sell you this morning he wants to say a bunch of lies that you need to be eight foot apart I say hey give me give me sign my brother he said lay hands on the sick in the shower covers oh we be sitting in the plane and you breathe the same air and it's reconcinct people coughing and it goes right to your eye oh but that's when God comes on the scene and I'll tell you never walked on a plane and you ever looked I always do this brother Jack always look who's flying the plane Rachel walks on she just keeps on walking she gets to her seat I'm like honey uh we love we gotta experience pilot we're good all right but you know what we gotta experience pilate today we got the King of Kings flying every plane we are in every job you got every sickness you're over he's in control so many times we forget who's flying the plane we get on the plane and we're just going well well we're going to make it if we go down we go down that's how my wife is she'll we'll go through turbulous brother Jack we'll flip in the air three times she'll still be sleeping and before you know it I'm going down every single aisle praying for everybody they say so you need to put your belt on I said no we're gonna have service up in here she'll tell you should tell you I don't know where I'm going this morning but Lord knows it's so so ridiculous what the devil wants to sell you he wants to sell us but but when he reached his hand down for us he's gave you every Divine gift yes he's gave you everything you have need of to get over there he's made you more than conquerors it says the bride has made herself ready oh and it takes preparation to get ready oh the bride you think about what she has to go through to get married it's I mean you brother Solomon your wife they do the weddings and take photos it's a lot of work it's endless hours of work what work are you putting in to get in what work are you doing to I'm not saying it's a work react but what are you doing to get in the word of God what are you preparing are you preparing to go home are you building your Treasures down here oh I thank God for it I thank God for the truth amen but I thought about you know we go through the airport sometimes and you get in there and the devil wants to say you hey will you stand this far apart and you do this and I'm telling you Rachel will tell you we were flying somewhere right in covert and this guy was laying literally on my Shore snoring but she wouldn't let me stand seven feet apart or six feet apart and boy I started praying for him for a sudden I said like this moved them out of my way but so many times the devil wants to lay on your shoulder yeah he wants to lay in your life and say you know what you need the Holy Ghost you know what he's not for you he wants to tell you your sickness today you can hold on to it oh but I tell you this morning to rebuke Satan and all his tricks from Satan of hell because he's called you out you are more than conquerors he's called you out but the problem is we carry our baggage too much we get to the airport and we carry the baggage a lot of y'all I'll tell you I love when I check it in and throw it at the belt and I was like you know what but we got to get actually we get to the Belt how we're leaving then when you get that 50 pounds off of you but some of us want to check our bag and you keep it with us think about it we want to keep our our anxiety and all our depression and everything we got today and we want to hold on to it when the devil says rebuke their spirits oh Lay Your Hands on the sick I'll tell you you got to realize who you are today I'm just here this morning to remind you who you are you're a child of God no matter what color it wasn't going to shape whatever you come from who your mother is our father is the king all of our father is the king this morning I'm thankful for that the prophet of God says in the redeeming Redemption he said look Don't Run Away stay in Christ he said don't go after gifts and everything stay with the giver he said God will take care of the gifts stay there yes he said stay in the field he said pick up a few of the gleaning behind he said don't you leave this field he says stay right here I believe that's the day we're living in I see people leaving here and leaving there saying well this message was true you know what it's always true I'm like sister how do you write this is nothing but saith the Lord I tell you what he sent a Vindicated Prophet show me where you send another one there ain't another one there ain't going to be another one he is your messenger for the hour he says you can draw in conclusions of what I was fixing to say he said in so stay here until night he said Till The Sun Goes Down Sun's gone he says and when Christ baptizes you with the Holy Spirit stay put right in Christ he said that first love is in your heart never let get never let it get cold oh my I'll think about that just keep it keep loving him move on brother Brett says know this then he said now I have commanded that these young men don't bother you oh what a spiritual background that's got he said you know some of these uh stiff knickers he says little old um half um brother boarded uh churches he said you know the Holy Roller he said I've commanded them that they leave you alone it's my hair amen it's my Heritage the prophet said he had it in his mind what he was going to do said I command them to leave you alone he said but you follow fast behind the Reapers he said when it comes to Mid to midday and you get tired go over he's talking about Ruth come over and sit down under the tree and take the morsel of bread and dip it right in the rest of him I like that that's Fellowship you see get right behind around under the shade tree don't you don't you love to get under the under there just he said just dip right in the rest of them amen I'm thankful for that this morning he says I'm going to read this he says in the kings of Redeemer he said know this we might say we can close and we might say this in closing he said then he took Ruth and he married her and she brought for the son Obed he said Obi was the father of Jesse Jesse was the father of David think about the lineage that came forth who was the father of Christ amen father of Jesus Christ don't you see through that righteousness through that clear-cut decision he became our Kinsmen Redeemer God became kin folks to us to come down think about this brother I said to come down and be made like us a human being suffered hunger suffered thirst I thirst give me a drink he said and you put vinegar in his mouth go he said he he thirsted like we did he said he known how do you how to do without he was sick like we are aren't you thankful that he said he said won't they say to me to the old Parable physician heal yourself oh he said by his great power wasn't for himself he said he had the power to do it but he couldn't use it on himself oh think about it this morning it was for me and you this morning it wasn't for him it was for me and you aren't you thankful but when he reached on his hand I love that in the scripture verse 16 says he he left he he let fall on some of the handfuls of purpose and he and leave them and she made glean and rebuke her not and verse 18 and she took it up and went into the City and her mother and law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her and she had reserved after she was sufficed think about it I'll tell you this morning you get suffice first then you share it with others you know what she got sufficed and then she shared it with her mother-in-law oh don't share something that you don't have when you get filled with the Holy Ghost and he becomes Your Life share it with others share with someone you think hey they might not look the parts they might not have the dress and the hair and all this but guess what we're still looking for that wine I'll tell you I was once in that world shaped in iniquity speaking lies but God I tell you God grace rich in Mercy is calling people out he's calling I'll tell you we're living in a gleanful time today oh we need to glean on everything we can with the Holy ghost-filled pastor with a church that's got a backbone today that's standing strong for the word of God that stand is strong for the message of the hour oh I thank you Lord but think about it just to bring it back a little bit in verse 1 chapter 1 of Ruth just to lay a little Foundation think about it she came from a for it came from famine was in the land verse one he said she was in famine in the land in this verse 1 and it says a certain man in Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab and it also means wash pots and his wife two sons think about it and then verse two it says the name of the man was amalek in the name of his wife Naomi and think about it they had two sons think about this verse 3 and amalek Naomi's husband died and she left her two sons and he took the wives verse four he took his wives of the woman of Moab and the name one was orpa and then the other one was Ruth and then you got the two sons macalon and Chilean died think about that they both died and I'm going to tell you when you get to a place of famine in your life when you get the place to of a spiritual deadness in your life I'll tell you it's a time to start praying it's a time to get back to the Altar and say Lord fill me up I'll tell you don't make decisions in a time of famine don't make decisions when your family's going through hard times oh trust God it's a time to to hunker down and believe God with all your heart you're going to go through times of valleys times of mountaintops but when you're going through the valleys in a time of famine just keep trusting God just keep trusting God think about it they died and they returned by the verse 8 and they only said unto her sons of two daughters-in-law go return to their mother's house and the Lord dealt kindly with thee with you as you have dwelt with the dead and with me but verse go verse 11. and Naomi said turn again my daughters he says why will you go with me she said hey why would you go with me I can't have any more signs I can't have any what are you what do I have I can give you it's what she's saying verse 14 and she lifted up her voice and went beginning Arbor kissed her mother-in-law by Ruth clavon to her verse and that's us today it says and and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and into her gods think about it one of them went with her and one of them went back out to the world think about it she going back into the people into her gods and returned now to their sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from the following entity for whether thou goest I will go because she knew who her God was think about it she said we're the largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God be my God that's where we gotta get in our life if you're the only one standing he's still your God a matter for the last message Church standing here in West Palm Beach he still are God that's where we got to get no matter how many people I believe that's how it is today we got message people turn into the left going to the world it's because it never became a revelation to him it was just a head knowledge it's got to be more than a head knowledge there's got to be something on the inside that gives you Revelation and brother bear says pray for Revelation more than anything I say Lord give us more revelation reveal it to us Lord verse 17 it says where thou dieest I will die and there where I'll be buried the Lord do so with me and more so and if ought be death be part part thee of me he says oh when Verse 18 when she saw that she was steadfastly minded whole church we got to get steadfastly minded oh when she saw she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her man oh well what does God do with our lives we say we believe this truth we say we believe this but we got to be steadfastly minded oh no matter if our kids leave our family leaves our wife leaves we still believe in his church oh it's nothing but the truth amen but we got to stay steadfastly minded you're going to go through roller coasters in life you're going to go through valleys you're going to go through mountaintops but I'll tell you do the mountain think about it sometimes through the valley it's a lot better of you because you can look up and see everything that you're going through but then when you get up to the top all you see is just clear skies but sometimes I love when he brings us to the mountain Through The Valleys in our lives and you send you when you get up to the mountain you look back down and see what he's brought you through oh I'm thankful for that today I'm thankful because he's he I was really listening a message this morning he's shaping our Victory this morning our character is our Victory this morning and he said that's the only thing you're going to take with you is your character I say Lord help me Lord to have a character like you so think about it she came from Moab she came from a place uh she came from Bethlehem a house of praise is what it means she was in a a place just like us a MOAB a place of sin a place where lot was a place of bad sudden condition within God but but then God sent a kinsman redeemer he's done the same thing with you this morning he sent you a kinsman redeemer to pull you from from the worlds of sin oh we're still of the worlds tell a boy the other day I said Son we're still of this world I said but we're not of the world I said aren't you thankful son that he called us out aren't you thankful I said Son you love the word of God in this message more than you love me I said when you get a revelation of that us his son no Gates of Hell will prevail but I thought about I like what the Bible says it says in verse 1 it said verse chapter one it said Ruth was deciding in the topic number two Ruth had to serve think about it she had to serve she had to go in the fields and glean and they dropped a handful of purpose verse chapter three for time it said Ruth rested she rested at his feet oh sometimes that would do us some good to go through all these four chapters it ain't long but to rest in Jesus Christ oh when you're going through a trial don't get all upset and get out of been out of shape but just say Lord I'm rested in your wings [Music] I'll tell you we were driving here brother Jack and we were driving down the road probably shouldn't say this but I'm going to say it so we're driving down the road and there's these buzzers in the road I didn't know how slow they moved but I started driving towards them this Eagle started driving towards buzzards and I was driving towards them and I didn't let off the gas I didn't speed up but I didn't let off and I was like you don't move and literally one just said it was like five of them it felt like a bowling ball hit the hit the car Rachel said Chris them things are like hidden deer I said well you know what that's okay didn't move out of the way but a lot of times that's like the devil in their lives that's like the devil is our lives we let these buzzers get around us but I tell you we're more than a buzzard this morning you're an eagle this morning he's called you to live higher and you know how slow they move I didn't realize how slow they move they literally when I got into it Brother Jay that thing said like this thing like that but you're an eagle this morning you're so higher than any sin any disease any cancer whatever you have this morning you fly higher than these buzzers [Applause] but I thought about it this morning when I was driving I said Lord thank you Jesus I hit that thing and the one went flying where it would fly these cars were looking at me like Lord he just hit the big old buzzer I said y'all don't understand we're Eagles today get the buzzers out of the way get them out of the road I said get the trash out of the road when the Eagles are coming to church oh but that's what our life is you're more than a buzzard this morning you're an eagle and he's called you to live higher amen oh but it was easy eating carcasses and eating no dead stuff but I tell you you got Heavenly manner today you got heavily married every message everybody from Jesus to Revelation has been revealed to you oh but so far so far higher than these buzzers I don't know the Lord was going to use that this morning I don't know how but I said Lord you're going to use it you spoke to me Rachel thought well my is that rental car okay I said that's why you take insurance out praise God but I tell you what we're flying higher than these buzzers but I just thought about it for a minute I just said man they got to be faster than that Rachel said they're not fast they're real slow they're sluggish but that's how the devil's Spirit wants to get on you he wants to just get on you real slow he wants to put a TV in your house he wants to put Facebook all over your life oh think about it he wants to slowly work little sins in your life think about it how the devil just wants to slowly say it's okay Mommy it's okay to play these games all the time before you know it you're not even reading your Bible you're not even listening to the messages because he's slow he's slow at putting things in your life one by one but I tell you we got to rebuke everything that's in our house I'll tell you everyone was some good to go home and do a house cleaning get the spirit out of our house get things off our wall and put things that that only Rejoice but I'm saying you could go by a person's house or read his Bible and tell you where he stood Paul where do you stand this morning oh but the Bible says in John 15 12-20 12-13 he said that this Commandment that you love one another as I Loved You greater love that no man than this to lay down his life for his friends think about it he laid his life down for me and you how thankful we should be but like I said I read in verse 2 it's suffice she was suffice after she she gleaned all day and they dropped a handful of purpose it met every need she had think about it this morning uh Matthew 5 6. I was writing these down and said blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled Psalms 42 1 as the heart painteth after the water books so pain of my soul after thee oh that's going to be our life this morning but number two when she reached on her hand she was filled up I wrote that down this morning when she reached on her hand she was filled up oh he's filling you up more than you think this morning oh it might be simple this morning but he's filling your life up he's filling you up he's getting you filled up to share it with someone else oh think about it the prophet that God says he says do you see that young lady that's right behind you oh let the gleaning be heavy every once in a while drop a handful of purpose Prophet says I love those handfuls don't you he said gleaning behind the Reapers he said drop a handful of purpose that she could get it he said oh how Ruth felt when she grabbed the whole handful amen he said the reaper turned around and said it's all right he said it's all right oh when God gives you an old-fashioned pouring out of the Holy Spirit a handful he said do it on purpose oh he said no this he said then when after that the day was over she beat out all of her wheat and put it he said she'd put it in her little apron and brother Brown says until he took it to her mother-in-law and her mother-in-law advised her he says if you want to find out advice on how to how to do it Paul said after giving in Hebrews chapter 10 the great chapter of Faith the whole thing about Birmingham said now seeing that we're compassed about with such a great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight every sin and run for the race with patience that set before us think about that he says lay aside every way in sin rather that so easy besets us and run with patience oh I tell you we get so bogged down sometimes that things of this world but uh even myself it bogs us down it gives us it puts us down we come in the house of God sometimes and we barely were making it in but you made it in there's days that I get out there say Lord I don't know how I'm gonna make it but Rachel just pushed me to the door just push me to the door and then by the time you get to church you ever been in church and just like Lord your's been good to me you ever sing that song Lord Lord and I'll be Lord Lord and before you know it halfway through the service you shouting you praising God the spirit of left you you've been healed whatever it is I'll tell you not every day you feel like you're just oh I'm on cloud nine but I'll tell you what keep pushing through in this day push through every Spirit of hell every demon of power and coming to the house of God I tell you what there's no better place than I want to be and then number three I wrote down when he reached down his hand for her he changed her future think about it he changed their future he changed your future this morning he gave you something to live about oh no matter what you're going through today he's gave you something to live for think about I'm going to prepare a place oh no matter how big a house she got here he's building imagine the place that he's got the streets are gold Ivory palaces oh I tell you what one day brother Jack we gonna be rejoicing all right do you all know how to Rejoice brother Solomon but one day I'm gonna be where you're at I'm fine Brother Solomon because we know we're going to be shouting we're going to be dancing we're going to be having a good time I'll tell you I know you're saying it's all emotions but I tell you it should give you some emotion oh if you're not you're dead the prophet says you're dead I tell you why he'll robbing you up he'll give you something to be happy about but he reached down let's go to the last chapter verse 4 chapter 4 verse 13. so Boaz took Ruth think about this think about Ruth didn't take Boaz Boaz took Ruth the same thing Jesus done with you today he chose you from the foundation of the world he took you as your bride oh so Boaz took roof that she was with his wife and when she went up with her and the lord gave her conception that she bear a son and the woman said unto Noah blessed be the Lord which have not left thee this day without a Kinsmen oh and his name what may be famous in Israel and she shall be unto thee restorer of thy life think about it has He restored your life has He restored your life and the nursery on thy old age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee which better that better to thee than the seven sons hath borne him and Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and be became nurse into it there's something I want to say on studying this I don't know if you thought about this brother Jack but Boaz knew what mercy and Grace was you know his mother was Rahab the Harlot so he knew what Grace was think about it think about it all the Jericho burned up but her in her home you know what she did she hung out that Scarlet roll she laid it out the window she listened to what Moses and then said just like we have a prophet in our day she listened to her prophet and her day lay it out and your whole family will be saved the devil wants to tell you well my son's here and my daughter's here I don't know why I'm going here this morning my daughter said but you know what just lay it out the window the same lay out the window and say you know what if he could save her family it'll save my family it'll save my grandbabies it'll save my children if it's good enough for her it's good enough for you this morning stop letting the devil say you can't have your children always says you can have your inheritance oh think about it today so lay it out lay the message cord out today and say Lord I accept it today think about it today [Music] think about it I want to read this quote it really stood out to me what they said about brother Brown says in this message about Rahab in the token he says believe for safety then apply he says believe for here is what you want to believe for you want you want your own safety you believe for your safety the problem says and then apply the token for your whole family he says you say you can't do that claim it he said if it worked on you then you and your word becomes one amen amen amen he said see it works for both of you he says you and the word are one then apply it to your children I don't know who needs that this morning but the Lord told me to read it then apply it to your children think about this he says apply it to your loved ones like Rahab did oh that'll do you some good this morning I'll tell you next time the devil wants to remind you put that up in the car or on the dash apply it to your loved ones like Rahab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and they and got them all in aren't you thankful that is Amazing Grace today oh you might be the only reason all your family gets in today oh your mother your grandchildren I'll tell you to stay strong today or the devil wants to tell you oh he might be in drugs or he's there or he's there but you know why he'll still be there apply it to your family today stop worrying about where they're at just worry about where they're going think about it oh don't give her this song going up yonder they're going they're beyond it oh I tell you I'll tell you how about the Undertaker today the Undertaker will put you in the ground but we have the uplifter going to take us out think about it oh but just apply it to your loved ones I don't know who needs that quote but I just felt that to share it she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and got them all in you apply it he said say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her he says I apply my token your token no one else's token your token this morning it's your token this morning oh climate this morning claim it for your loved ones oh if you can realize it's your token no one else's token think about it I apply my token I need to underline that three times hold the Holy Spirit oh the holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going to her oh now with your anointing upon me he will do it amen oh we need to be living in a higher age he's called you in that age to be called out I'll tell you you think about how many pounds I don't know how many churches are in here but they would do anything to have the key that unlocks the door I thought about it brother the church's name is perfect spirit and Truth I'm so thankful for it when you grow up with a family that doesn't believe God and never believed God they drop you off on Sunday or Easter and whatever they call it Easter in uh Thanksgiving or whatever it was Christmas they drop you off just a special service and Dad will drop you off and he'd come back and say hey call me when you're ready I looked at the boys last night we're at the banquet we're at the youth banquet brother Jack and I started weeping and I said Lord I Thank you for letting me have the truth thank you for saving my soul because my son wouldn't be in the atmosphere today I said if it wasn't for the grace of God he would be out in the world it wouldn't be the grace of God I wouldn't have him in this atmosphere and I told Rachel I'll drive every single mall that I have to to keep them in the presence of God that keep them around Believers as long as I can live hey I tell you young kids you stay around godly people amen I don't know where your skills schools you're in or where you're at but you know what you're living a higher age you're Eagles this morning you don't have to listen to that trash in the schools they do I don't know why I'm going here but I tell you I tell you this you live a higher life than that don't live around them kids that talk bad and talk trash that want to de-ground the Bible and I tell you they don't have no godliness at all anymore imagine what our school looks like today we picked up a god brother of the other day and he got the car hey God bless you if you got to take them or wherever you got to take them each to your own but we picked up this brother the other day he looked at me he was doing homeschool he got in the back seat I said how's school going he said Chris it's terrible he was probably what 12 years old 12 years old he said Chris is terrible the things I hear the things I see he said it's law they lost everything a 12 year old and I looked at them and I said brother and he said brother I need the Holy Ghost more than ever he said brother Chris pray that I get the Holy Ghost he said because I won't make it a 12 year old look at me in my eyes and said in this ate up World in these ate up school systems he said Chris they're training us in a way to do to worship Satan and it really just tore my heart out so I'll tell you protect your kids protect them today surround them by godly people and you know what we're all going to make mistakes I'm going to make a steak brother Jack's going to make mistake brother Solomon all of us are going to make mistakes but you know what you get back up and you know what there's no perfect Church you're gonna come in some days you're gonna get upset and you're gonna leave and you're gonna think well I ain't going back there but you know what you go back to Walmart every time someone makes you upset [Applause] think about it you go to Publix when someone makes you upset you go through there they make you mad you're back there shopping next week I don't know why I'm going here but I'm here to tell you I tell you we're all unperfect people but I tell you when we're in his presence he's made us Perfect by the blood he's made you perfect this morning by the block oh I tell you you can find the steaks find excuses in everyone's life but I tell you the closer you get to God the more you look to the cross when I see you I see Perfect People I see children of God oh I see the boy When I Look to You I see children of God that's going to make it oh I tell you the closer you get to God your eyes to become like that right oh you don't look at your brother and sister and Bash them in the ground when they're going through a hard time you pick a phone up and say hey can I do anything for you then call sister and say hey you know what she did last week or what they did last week you know why don't you call them up and say hey hey I'm sorry you're going through this but hey what can I do for you that's where we are should be in our life oh we're called to a higher living but when he reached down he changed their future think about it she came from Moab and then she marries she marries Ruth and it saves her whole family think about it Caesar Caesar mother-in-law and everybody and I'm thankful for that we'll read this we're about to close I'm gonna read this she goes I wrote this down she goes from a nobody in Moab to a name to a true name think about it she had she had the son of a Obed and then the son of Jesse and then the son of David think about the lineage she started Think About by surrendering her life to Jesus and letting Boaz become her uh her Kinsmen and he only he took a Kinsman and I brought this this morning and it was in my Bible I just felt like it was timely this is Brother branham's notes on the woman at the well and the Pharisees and it shows brother Brown when he wrote it out he shows the Pharisees how they got to Jesus but they didn't go no farther but think about the woman that the whale all sinned ate up she got through the she got through Jesus but she went through the Bible and the word she went all the way and that's the difference of brother Brown's notes this is actually brother Brown's notes that I got it says it shows the woman of the well she got all the way to the word she didn't just stop at his Works she didn't just stop she believed on him she believed for her salvation and that's where you got to get this morning you got to get to that spot in your life brother Branham where he brought up the Pharisees all they could see was works but she went all the way all the way in Jesus Christ oh she was ate up but I'm thankful that this morning that we go all the way in Christ and that's what God's doing today he's calling you out he's called every one of us out and no matter what you go through I'm not if I'm not back for a year or whenever I tell you to keep pressing on keep pressing on it's a tough time every devil in hell is pointed at you but I tell you greater is he that's in me as the musicians come greater is he that's in me the he that's in the world aren't you thankful for that the prophet that God says like he says this he said he said it's not of the world system even as we are not of this world he said that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king he said that is why our women and our men women do not dress in men's clothing or cut the hair cosmetics and then he goes on say every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain aren't you thankful for that as they play something Softly I pray there was something that was said this morning maybe just with our eyes closed for a minute how thankful we should be this morning how thankful we should be for a Kinsmen Redeemer how he's called us out how he's called us help maybe there's someone that is telling my voice young old middle age we just lift their hands and say Lord fill me with the Holy Spirit oh God my hands are up Lord oh Father may you fill us afresh this morning father how we need it more than ever father may you come through every aisle father may you bless your bride bless your church this morning bless your people bless these young kids father fighting every everything that can be thrown at this morning the father may you put a shield of protection like you did job may you put a hedge of protection around them oh Father

and mercy give us a good day in you in Jesus name amen oh thank you Lord [Applause] oh we certainly thank the Lord for the word of God today um when he reached down his hand and I had no idea that brother Chris was going to use the uh the story of Ruth as his you know just his background you know and anytime God sent us just a a guest Minister that wasn't specifically planned amen I always look at it as God just you know dropping something on purpose for us and he went right to the scripture where we get that thought from uh there in the Book of Ruth and I just I just love that she started the story as worthless but ended the story as wealthy she started as a widow but ended with a wedding my she started as a pauper but ended as a princess uh God knew how to turn things around amen amen God God know how to turn things around and and I'm just I'm just grateful I mean it's even as you just shared no matter what our loved ones are doing unless the planet token let's just believe God uh God Amen the power of God is greater than any spirit that might have them bound the power of God is greater and sometimes what happens God just allows people to go through different seasons of life because they learn things as they go through and uh and then they story gonna be a help to somebody else coming along the road so man we don't have to fuss we don't have to fight we don't have to argue we don't have to do anything just just commit it to the Lord amen just apply the token my God God bless you brother brother Kathy we certainly certainly appreciate you on today oh man okay let's

encouraging to those that might be going through a little something in your body brother Chris read a quote there this morning brother Branham made a statement he said the Lord Jesus was sick like we are and you imagine you know just Jesus he's the one that's going around healing everybody and you can never see him as being sick but the prophet a man goes into a deeper Channel and says he was sick just like we are and um in in the scripture that he applied to it is where Jesus says people say physician heal thyself don't let the devil tell you you ain't got faith [Music] don't ever let the devil tell got faith it's just simply that we have to go through certain things but we still apply to blood we still believe God for our healing amen we're going to praise him while we're waiting on our healing praise God Amen but don't let the devil uh uh uh try to rob you of your faith eat our Lord and savior had to go through things just like we did and this is why the Bible says he's able to secure he's able to help those because he understands exactly what you've got what you're going through my God my God that was that was that was life-giving amen just just seeing that little statement there from the prophet that was very life-giving amen and I know it was for me I I I've been criticized for a man taking medicine amen like what you get credit I said well I say all I can say is anything [Music] the health the human race is Godly brother random say burn that burn up the hospitals if it ain't Godly if it's not helping a human race just burn them up right let's say anything we got the approach thing so sensibly amen you just keep pressing on keep claiming your healing keep claiming it by faith God will manifest he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities amen the chastise gonna get pieces upon him and with his stripes you are healed keep confessing it until it manifests in your body but don't let the devil amen try to weaken your faith until you ain't got no faith the devil is a liar even my Lord went through some of the things I'm going through amen and he was king of kings and Lord of lords oh Almighty all powerful he was all that and more and he lives inside of us so we thank God for that I was I was blessed today I was absolutely blessed praise the Lord amen amen let's have a word of prayer amen father we are truly a man
