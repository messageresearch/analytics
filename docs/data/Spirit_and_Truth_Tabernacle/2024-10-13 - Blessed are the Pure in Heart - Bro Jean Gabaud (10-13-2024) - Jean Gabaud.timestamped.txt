[21:44] trust everybody managed well through the
[21:48] storm and we know that there's a great
[21:49] God that we
[21:50] serve and um you know I anticipate that
[21:54] we're going to see more of these things
[21:57] amen just a week ago we had one storm
[22:00] that came through and a week later
[22:01] another storm came through you know the
[22:03] Bible talks about wars and pestilence
[22:06] and you know earthquakes in diverse
[22:08] places and these are just the be these
[22:11] are the the the signs of the
[22:14] end and then even as the Bible is saying
[22:16] that the Bible also says look up your
[22:18] Redemption draweth nigh right when
[22:21] people looking all around them trying to
[22:22] figure out what's going on we know the
[22:24] Bible says look
[22:26] upu going home time
[22:29] God's trying to make you feel
[22:30] uncomfortable here right trying to make
[22:33] you feel uncomfortable in your job make
[22:36] you feel uncomfortable at home
[22:39] uncomfortable with your bank accounts
[22:42] come on somebody because as long as we
[22:44] got something to fall back on we feel
[22:46] comfortable I don't know about y'all but
[22:48] I'm falling back on God I'm leaning on
[22:50] the Everlasting
[22:53] name amen praise the Lord I tell you you
[22:57] know one of the things I'm still really
[22:59] just kind of enjoying in my spirit is uh
[23:02] the night of
[23:04] Praise And um my wife's like you going
[23:06] to make a comment or two about that I'm
[23:08] like how could I not make a comment or
[23:09] two about that right it's just I'm going
[23:11] to bring it up cuz it was funny because
[23:14] she it was my first time attending a uh
[23:16] an event like this and I really didn't
[23:18] know what to expect and I don't know
[23:20] where my mind went so I'm thinking just
[23:22] a few of us going to gather in this
[23:24] place maybe expend it out there a little
[23:27] bit and my wife looked at me she's like
[23:29] it's in an auditorium I'm like all right
[23:31] well it I still didn't process that so
[23:34] I'm like well I guess it's not at the
[23:36] the location they're they're normally at
[23:38] so we pulled up and there was like a
[23:40] bunch of cars out there and my wife's
[23:43] like it's at an auditorium like like I
[23:46] still couldn't process it and we got in
[23:49] and I don't know I could be off of my
[23:51] numbers y'all could correct me but it
[23:52] seems like it was a couple of
[23:54] thousand my mind was I don't know where
[23:56] I got a couple hundred from
[23:59] but I tell you what I just you know you
[24:02] know how you just kind of you're you're
[24:04] kind of debating whether or not you
[24:05] should make a an event or not and you
[24:07] know I'm you know I'm coming up with I
[24:08] can't you know we got this going on and
[24:10] I got that going on and the devil start
[24:12] telling me you got everything going on
[24:14] but if there was not if there was if the
[24:16] event was not taking place I wouldn't
[24:17] have had anything going
[24:18] on then I'm like you know what I you
[24:21] know my wife's encouraged me like I
[24:22] don't know if we want to miss this I'm
[24:23] like you know we're going to gather the
[24:24] family we're going to go praise the Lord
[24:27] that's the best decision I could made
[24:29] the devil was mad
[24:32] too oh man that opening and from the
[24:34] moment the service was open it was just
[24:36] like I was just praise worship just want
[24:39] to give God praise and glory that was
[24:41] just
[24:43] fantastic absolutely wonderful and just
[24:46] really you know just really appreciate
[24:48] you all cuz I know there's a lot of work
[24:49] that goes into you know uh coordinating
[24:52] such an event as large at as large as um
[24:55] what we uh what we attended and I just I
[24:57] was just so beside myself went back to
[24:59] our home church and was talking about it
[25:01] I know some of the Saints came up came
[25:03] down and you know we we were just
[25:04] talking about it was just such a
[25:06] glorious and wonderful time of worship
[25:08] and praise I tell you what I mean if you
[25:11] ever want to confuse the devil stop
[25:12] start giving God praise and
[25:14] worship amen so it's just that was just
[25:17] a really awesome time amen Lord bless
[25:20] yall chapter five um just a couple of
[25:22] opening scripture um I appreciate the
[25:25] specials there's one that really caught
[25:26] my heart was um turn your high Turn Your
[25:29] Eyes Upon
[25:30] Jesus I know it takes courage to come up
[25:32] for a for for a young believer just to
[25:34] kind of be before the the group and just
[25:36] to kind of sing a song but I I will tell
[25:39] you if it wasn't for anybody else that
[25:41] song was for me amen amen cuz often
[25:44] times when I visit a church I'm always
[25:46] looking for something Lord that kind of
[25:48] gives me some comfort that I mean your
[25:52] channel and when the sister got up to
[25:54] sing that song I said Lord that's it
[25:56] right there just moved me in a special
[25:58] way
[25:59] the reason why that song was so
[26:00] meaningful to me and has been is because
[26:03] I don't know if y'all remember brother
[26:05] Lonnie
[26:06] Jenkins he passed away and gone to be
[26:08] with the Lord but before I had accepted
[26:11] the Lord um he was a a fastic uh uh
[26:15] teacher in the word and um he visited my
[26:19] dad's church at that time and um and you
[26:23] know like a young kid I went to church
[26:25] and just thought it' be another service
[26:27] and the way he Minister just grabbed a
[26:30] hold of me and brother talk you know
[26:32] preaches that message from that time
[26:33] well from that time and every time he
[26:37] would get up to minister one of his
[26:39] songs that he would always sing one of
[26:41] his go-to songs his favorite songs was
[26:43] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and then
[26:46] sitting back there in my in the study
[26:48] and just kind of collecting my thoughts
[26:49] and the young uh the young individual
[26:51] came up and sung the song I said Lord
[26:53] that was just for me amen you never know
[26:56] because I mean young people you have a
[26:58] purpose in God's
[26:59] kingdom you have a purpose in God's
[27:03] kingdom when Jesus had a need no one
[27:06] else had the ability to give Jesus what
[27:08] he needed except for a young little boy
[27:10] that had a had a fish a basket of
[27:13] fish that fed 5,000 people so you can't

[30:27] yourself amen may the Lord add his
[30:29] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[30:31] may be
[30:34] seated so I I took us to a few
[30:36] scriptures and y'all just bear with me
[30:38] there's just a couple of uh examples
[30:42] within the Bible that I'll just like to
[30:43] just uh draw your attention to so um
[30:47] just bear with me as we kind of build a
[30:50] foundation the Bible talks about blessed
[30:53] are the pure in heart for they shall see
[30:57] God I believe it's everyone's desire
[30:59] sitting here this morning to see God can
[31:02] we say praise the Lord that's my desire
[31:05] I want to see God in order to have
[31:09] access to God requires that you have a
[31:12] clean and a pure
[31:14] heart of which brother bam also says
[31:17] that you need to have a clean hand mind
[31:21] that we might come into the
[31:24] sanctuary night after night rejoicing
[31:28] Ing and filled with your
[31:31] spirit so in order for you to receive
[31:34] God in order for you to see God you have
[31:38] to have a clean heart a pure heart Clean
[31:41] Hands and a pure
[31:43] mind and that was the uh
[31:46] case um in the Old Testament in the
[31:50] Tabernacle layout where the priest had a
[31:54] responsibility to go before the presence
[31:58] of God on behalf of the people and as
[32:01] the priest entered in prior to the
[32:03] priest going into the uh the outer Court
[32:07] the priests had to Adorn themselves in a
[32:10] way that is
[32:11] Meaningful in a way that's
[32:13] presentable as they approach God because
[32:18] to not be right in the presence of God
[32:21] meant death for the priest and so there
[32:24] was a lot of stock that went into making
[32:27] sure
[32:28] that you know I had the right dress
[32:30] attire that I was appropriately
[32:33] presenting myself and that you know I
[32:36] didn't come to present myself to God any
[32:39] old fashion or any old way there was
[32:42] some seriousness to how you presented
[32:44] yourself to God you had to be dressed
[32:46] right and then you went they went into
[32:49] the outer court and there were uh uh
[32:52] items within the outer Court such as
[32:55] there was a sacrifice where the priest
[32:58] would offer a sacrifice on behalf of the
[33:00] people and then before going into the
[33:03] holy or the holies of holies the priest
[33:07] uh there was a Labor uh to wash away
[33:12] himself so he had to wash himself he
[33:15] offered the sacrifice and then he had to
[33:18] wash himself and this was a process and
[33:21] once a year the the the priest would
[33:24] have an audience with God and go where
[33:27] the Shak the glory was at and that's in
[33:29] the holies of holies and so the priest
[33:32] would be dressed in a certain way in
[33:35] order for him to see God and it was such
[33:37] a serious ordeal such a serious uh event
[33:42] and so the priest uh made sure they had
[33:45] adorned themselves in the right way and
[33:47] at the bottom of His Garment there were
[33:50] pomegranates and the pomegranates made
[33:53] noise so that way when the priest had uh
[33:57] disappeared appeared out of the sight of
[33:59] the people cuz they watched the the
[34:01] people the multitudes of people watching
[34:04] the priests go into the outer Court uh
[34:07] go into the outer court and they could
[34:09] hear the the the the the the crackling
[34:12] of the of the the pomegranates and it
[34:15] meant that the priest was still alive
[34:18] and all was still
[34:20] well and the priests were going to the
[34:23] holy place and that was where you had
[34:25] the seven candles and all these
[34:27] different things and the people could
[34:29] still hear the noise on the inside which
[34:32] meant also that the priest was still
[34:37] alive and the biggest thing of all was
[34:39] that the priest had to go into the
[34:42] holies of holies and that's where God
[34:46] dwelt and the priest had to present the
[34:50] sacrifice to God and and represent the
[34:55] people and in that moment moment if God
[34:59] didn't receive the
[35:01] sacrifice because there was an art about
[35:04] the priest there was a uh a blemish
[35:07] within the priest presenting himself the
[35:10] priest was struck
[35:12] dead and when the people didn't hear any
[35:17] sound that meant that God didn't accept
[35:20] the
[35:21] sacrifice it also meant that God didn't
[35:24] accept the
[35:26] people and so in the absence of the
[35:30] priest being present in front of them
[35:32] the only thing that they had to rely was
[35:34] on the noise that heard on the other
[35:36] side
[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] amen that's the Book of Revelation there
[35:41] we just don't have time to get into it
[35:43] but when the priest came back out when
[35:47] he
[35:48] returned and the people saw the priest
[35:51] there was Jubilee in the camp there was
[35:54] Worship in the camp there was uh singing
[35:58] and shouting and praising God not only
[36:01] because the priest was alive but it also
[36:04] meant that God had accepted the
[36:07] sacrifice which also meant that God had
[36:10] accepted them am
[36:13] amen and so it was an important thing
[36:16] when the priests was to go behind the
[36:20] Tabernacle to meet God that he was
[36:23] dressed the right
[36:24] way now the Bible tells us this that God
[36:28] is a
[36:30] spirit and can only be seen with a pure
[36:34] heart you with me yes sir God is a
[36:38] spirit and can only be seen with a pure
[36:41] heart now in the flesh everyone saw
[36:46] Jesus but only the elect saw
[36:49] God right the Pharisees saw Jesus the
[36:53] Sadducees saw Jesus the herodians the
[36:56] zealots all the denominations the
[36:58] believer and un unbeliever they all saw
[37:01] Jesus no different than today everybody
[37:04] can look at this Bible and read if you
[37:06] have any common sense to read you could
[37:08] read the Bible you could read Genesis
[37:12] you could read Proverbs you could read
[37:14] Revelation but only a few that's called
[37:17] the elect can see God in the
[37:20] Bible only a few can see God in this
[37:24] ministry
[37:25] hallelujah amen even after his death
[37:30] only elected few contined to receive to
[37:32] continue to see God because they had a
[37:36] pure
[37:36] heart the Bible talks about a blind man
[37:40] named
[37:41] bmus and if you would turn with me to
[37:43] Mark chapter 10 there's a few things
[37:45] that I'd like to read so Mark chapter 10
[37:48] the Bible talks about blind barus and
[37:50] brother man talks about it quite
[37:52] frequently but we're going to talk about
[37:53] that just a little bit Mark chapter
[38:04] 10 you know what's funny cuz I got this
[38:06] old Bible with Pages falling off and
[38:08] everything else and I don't want to make
[38:09] a big deal about it because people would
[38:10] want to get you a new Bible but I have
[38:12] all my notes in the Bible you know I
[38:16] just know where things are at because I
[38:17] just know where the notes are at you get
[38:19] a new Bible you got to reacquaint
[38:22] yourself like this missing page I mean
[38:24] this page right here it's all meaningful
[38:26] to me
[38:31] I try not to make a big deal about it I
[38:33] like praise the Lord I love my
[38:36] Bible Mark
[38:40] 10
[38:41] verse uh 46 and there and they came to
[38:46] Jericho and as he went out of Jericho
[38:49] with his disciples and a great number of
[38:53] people blind Bas the son of Tas Sat by
[38:56] the highway Wayside
[38:59] begging no telling how long he's been
[39:02] there not telling how many times people
[39:04] have seen him and when he heard that it
[39:07] was Jesus of
[39:09] Nazareth he began to cry let me tell you
[39:13] something he didn't know how Jesus
[39:15] looked
[39:18] right he had no visual depiction of who
[39:22] Jesus was but he has heard of his
[39:26] ministry and now there are people that
[39:28] was with Jesus that take advantage of
[39:30] how he
[39:32] looked but they still couldn't recognize
[39:35] who Jesus
[39:36] was and blind barus heard him and he
[39:41] began to cry out because this was his
[39:43] moment his opportunity and say Jesus the
[39:46] son of David have mercy on me and many
[39:51] charge him that he should hold his peace
[39:54] ain't that the way of the devil
[39:57] when there is an opportunity for you to
[40:00] seize your blessing the devil's telling
[40:02] you be
[40:04] quiet when the when God has done good
[40:07] for you the devil saying you don't
[40:09] testify about
[40:11] that I don't care how big that I don't
[40:14] care how big the issue was or even how
[40:16] small the matter was if it's worth
[40:18] giving God praise then give God praise
[40:22] yes sir
[40:24] amen let me tell you something the other
[40:26] day I went out for a walk and I found $5
[40:28] I thank God for
[40:30] it y'all y'all understand where I'm
[40:32] coming from cuz y'all had that happened
[40:34] to y'all before that man let me tell you
[40:36] when you come across some money on the
[40:38] floor and you're looking around and see
[40:39] who else notic it and it's as if God's
[40:41] talking directly to
[40:43] you you tell me you're not going to have
[40:45] a smile on your face you tell me you're
[40:47] not going to say hallelujah if God is
[40:50] able to do these little things how much
[40:52] more is he able to do big
[40:54] things you may have health problems
[40:57] God is able to take care of their health
[41:03] problem I put that $5 in my my pocket I
[41:06] I walk
[41:08] different my head was going through what
[41:10] can I buy with
[41:11] it praise the
[41:14] Lord and they try to hold his peace but
[41:17] he cried the more a great
[41:20] deal when the devil tries to hold you
[41:23] back when he tries to refrain you from
[41:26] giving God the glory
[41:27] that's even more of a reason
[41:31] why for you to give God the praise you
[41:34] may not see your blessing yet but
[41:36] believe in your
[41:38] blessing
[41:40] amen and Jesus listen to this the Bible
[41:44] says he called on to him he says Thou
[41:46] son of David have mercy upon me and
[41:50] there's no greater scripture than the
[41:51] scripture after this the Bible says
[41:54] Jesus Stood Still
[41:58] my
[42:00] goodness are your prayers that
[42:03] effective that you can cause God to stop
[42:07] dead in his
[42:10] track is your prayer is that committed
[42:13] that you say Lord I need you right here
[42:16] that it cause God to silence all
[42:20] [Applause]
[42:23] Heaven everybody was hollering and
[42:25] screaming everybody was making all this
[42:28] noise and Jesus was walking and blind
[42:31] bom says Jesus have mercy upon me and I
[42:34] can imagine the creator of Heaven and
[42:36] Earth
[42:38] stop
[42:40] amen and looked around because Mar m was
[42:44] looking for the sound of
[42:47] [Music]
[42:48] Jesus and the Bible says Jesus commanded
[42:51] him to come into
[42:54] him long story short
[42:57] his faith was so pure that while all
[43:01] others saw Jesus the flesh he saw God in
[43:05] Jesus hallelujah amen when I was
[43:09] studying upon
[43:11] that I came across this one quote and I
[43:13] think y'all know it but I'mma read it
[43:15] anyhow it's a little bit lengthy so bear
[43:17] with me y'all don't got any place to go
[43:20] right praise the Lord whenever you say
[43:22] something like that you put the church
[43:23] on the on the spot right because they're
[43:25] like well you know I don't want to miss
[43:26] a lunch special and stuff like but God
[43:28] be the
[43:29] glory God be the
[43:32] glory brother Ram talks about John
[43:37] Ryan I love that he says remember here
[43:40] at Fort Wayne oh John Ryan not the man
[43:43] with the whiskers the the other blind
[43:45] John Ryan I was having a meeting up
[43:47] there in a big Tabernacle and I'm fixing
[43:48] the clothes he says I'm going to pray
[43:50] for the sake the man was sitting in the
[43:52] balcony he was Catholic they brought him
[43:54] along the altar brought him up at the
[43:57] platform by his card when he come up
[44:00] where I was at said your name is John
[44:02] Ryan he says that's right you're in your
[44:04] a Catholic and he said that's right you

[44:10] circus my ridicule he was part of a
[44:13] circus he he was put this way he
[44:16] shouldn't be taken seriously the devil
[44:18] didn't even take him
[44:19] seriously he said that's right said
[44:22] you've been blind now for 20 years or
[44:24] better probably seen every doctor every
[44:27] sight person every expert and not one
[44:30] person could heal
[44:33] him he said that's right some kind of
[44:35] leukemia or some brother saying this
[44:37] another got in the eye another got into
[44:39] his eyes and run him blind I said you're

[45:05] and looked and I seen him go walking
[45:07] away with his
[45:09] sight amen I said thus say the Lord
[45:14] hallelujah you received your sight amen
[45:17] amen why he said I can't see
[45:22] anything a prophet just prayed over him
[45:25] it says Lord bless you you receive your
[45:28] sight thus sayth the Lord that's not
[45:29] even the prophet speaking Saints when
[45:31] you hear thus sayth the lord it's God
[45:34] speaking that's why we believe in a
[45:36] prophet that's why we don't believe in
[45:37] no man Ministry we believe in thus
[45:39] sayith the Lord because when God says it
[45:42] it has to be
[45:46] it hallu he says well I can't see and
[45:49] brother R says that has nothing to do
[45:51] with it go on your road
[45:53] rejoicing so he went down now there was
[45:56] a woman in in a few minutes had a great
[45:58] goer hanging on her throat and while she
[46:01] while we was praying for her it went
[46:04] away can you just imagine that he's
[46:06] sitting up there just as blind as he
[46:07] could be and all a sudden he hear shots
[46:09] and Praises somebody just got healed

[46:17] Lord and while we was praying for her it
[46:20] went away here John come Ryan back
[46:22] pushing through all the
[46:24] ushers and coming back again and so the
[46:26] man was helping me in the prayer line he
[46:28] started to put him off the platform he
[46:30] said I want to see that preacher and so
[46:32] they brought him up here again he said
[46:34] to him he said you told me I was

[53:03] bad but just praising God and say God
[53:05] has healed me you would think that
[53:06] they're crazy in their minds but he

[53:11] people look at you and you're worshiping
[53:13] God and no matter how difficult of the
[53:15] situation is you might be going through

[54:48] unbeliever I heard that you got healed
[54:53] he said yes I did pray praise the Lord
[54:57] for healing me he kept on to his
[54:59] testimony and when he did that his eyes
[55:03] came open in the barber chair and out of
[55:06] the chair he jumped with the towel
[55:08] around his neck the barber run to the
[55:11] door with the rais in his hand and down
[55:13] the street the old man rying just as
[55:15] hard as he could screaming and shouting
[55:17] praise the Lord he has healed
[55:22] me he held on to that he believed did he
[55:26] never was shaken off of it in his
[55:29] testimony followed that
[55:34] Miracle you might have just went and saw
[55:36] a doctor last week and the doctor might
[55:38] have given you some evil report you know
[55:39] you you consult a second
[55:41] physician and see what God says about it
[55:45] is that when you run it through the
[55:46] scripture I don't have any of these
[55:47] diseases that this man talk about I
[55:50] don't care what his charts tells me I
[55:52] don't care what school he went to I
[55:54] don't care what degrees are PL in this W
[55:57] I believe this spoken
[56:00] word you can run all the test you want
[56:03] you can strap me up with all the
[56:05] machines you want but as long as I
[56:07] believe this word I have none of the
[56:09] diseases that you're telling me I
[56:12] have high blood pressure you're God
[56:15] diabetes you're
[56:20] God arthritis you're
[56:24] gone whatever the sickness this doctors
[56:27] gave them fancy name it's still a
[56:31] devil you may have gone to school to
[56:33] give a devil a fancy name but in God's
[56:36] words it's still a
[56:39] demon and your education cannot take
[56:42] away a demon but I believe in the power
[56:44] of
[56:46] prayer I believe in a God that's more
[56:48] than
[56:51] capable
[56:53] amen thank you Lord I mean sometimes you
[56:55] go pay you go see a doctor and they'll
[56:58] say all these fancy words and elaborate
[57:00] terms and you know I'm right here
[57:02] looking at the doctor I'm like you know
[57:04] doctor tell give it to me straight how
[57:05] many days are we talking about two three
[57:08] days and then there kind of dumb it down
[57:10] for you it's like no you just got a cold
[57:11] it's like what why didn't you just say
[57:14] that but they work you up they work your
[57:16] spirit up and if you didn't get clarity
[57:19] you go back and I you know having a
[57:20] conversation with my wife like you know
[57:21] I only got two or three days I'm let me
[57:24] hug you guys
[57:27] and all you have is just just a common
[57:30] cold but they scare you with all these
[57:34] things those are goliaths in our day
[57:38] Giants men of
[57:40] renown they speak certain way and so now
[57:44] kind of that's why you you don't need to
[57:45] get shaken up that's why the Bible says
[57:47] fear not let a
[57:49] flock trust
[57:52] God he's brought you this far he's not
[57:56] going to leave you amen he received his
[58:00] sight his heart was
[58:03] pure every day he says I believe it for
[58:07] a month he held on to it I don't know
[58:10] what you're holding on to but you hold
[58:11] on to it and say Lord Jesus I receive it
[58:16] I lay claims on it if it's for your
[58:18] family lay claims on it if it's for your
[58:20] children you lay claims on it if it's
[58:22] for your job you lay claims on it
[58:29] let me take you to another example go
[58:31] with me to Genesis chapter
[58:35] 14 Genesis
[58:38] 14 we're going to take a look at Abraham
[58:40] for a quick
[58:43] moment going to look at a few characters
[58:45] that that saw God because they were pure
[58:47] in
[58:49] heart as you make your way to Genesis
[58:52] 14 let me offer a quick background
[58:57] Abraham separated himself from his
[59:01] family grabbed his wife and left and the
[59:05] Bible says lot
[59:07] also went with Abram Abram lot also went
[59:11] with him which evidently Abram did have
[59:14] a lot of
[59:19] trouble it started with there was Strife
[59:21] between Abraham's herdsman and lot's
[59:24] herdsman they outgrew the area that they
[59:28] were
[59:28] in and so the Bible talks about how
[59:31] Abraham said unto lot let there be no
[59:33] Strife I pray three between me and your
[59:36] herdsman and thy herdsman and he goes on
[59:39] to say because we're
[59:41] brothers we're brothers and the Bible
[59:44] also says that the whole that there were
[59:47] that there were um that there were
[59:50] unbelievers in the land so they they
[59:54] they were watching the The Strife
[59:58] between lot's herdsman and Abraham
[1:00:02] herdsman and so lot and so Abraham in
[1:00:06] his wisdom says look we don't want Let's
[1:00:08] Be Peace let's we're Brethren there's
[1:00:10] this land here you could go there and I
[1:00:12] go here or I could go there and you
[1:00:15] could go here and lot chose where he
[1:00:17] wanted to go and Abraham left it like
[1:00:21] that and peace
[1:00:23] continued and then chapter
[1:00:27] 14 the Bible talks about how it came to
[1:00:30] pass in verse one it came to pass in the
[1:00:33] days of amrel king of shanar ARA king of
[1:00:37] elisar shamer king of Elam and tile king
[1:00:41] of Nations that these were with barah
[1:00:44] Bersa shanab Adama shim right so there
[1:00:49] was war that occurred within the land
[1:00:53] that lot was
[1:00:54] in and as a result of that lot was
[1:00:57] caught up in this conflict meanwhile
[1:01:01] Abraham is just enjoying just a
[1:01:05] peace and the Bible says in verse
[1:01:09] 12 lot gets carried away into this
[1:01:12] battle and in verse 12 and they took lot
[1:01:15] a verse 12 and they took lot Abram's
[1:01:18] brother's son who dwelt in Sodom in his
[1:01:21] goods and
[1:01:23] departed and there came one
[1:01:26] that had escaped and told Abraham the
[1:01:28] Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of
[1:01:31] memor the Amorite brother of escol and
[1:01:35] brother of Anar and these were
[1:01:37] Confederate with Abram and when Abram
[1:01:41] heard that his
[1:01:43] brother was taken
[1:01:49] captive all he had to do is here I don't
[1:01:52] know where Abram was he could have been
[1:01:54] eating that he could have been eating
[1:01:55] dinner eating lunch just enjoying the
[1:01:57] tranquility and the peace that he was in
[1:01:59] and somebody comes running Abram Abram
[1:02:02] Abram we got problems Abram's like calm
[1:02:06] down what happened it's like lot got
[1:02:09] caught up there's a war that ensued over
[1:02:12] in the land over there and they took
[1:02:15] lot Abraham heard that his brother not
[1:02:19] his
[1:02:21] enemy his
[1:02:23] brother was taken captive
[1:02:26] he
[1:02:27] armed his trained
[1:02:31] servants the reason why this is
[1:02:33] important because the Bible does say he
[1:02:35] armed
[1:02:36] servants he wanted to get the best of
[1:02:39] the best
[1:02:42] right he wanted to get those that had
[1:02:45] experience in
[1:02:47] battle he wanted to get those that he
[1:02:51] knew would not Retreat when the enemy
[1:02:53] coming up coming at them that's right
[1:02:56] why because his brother was too
[1:02:58] important to
[1:03:00] him Abraham did not disuss himself or
[1:03:04] with others that you know what lot made
[1:03:07] the wrong decision right that didn't
[1:03:11] matter to
[1:03:13] Abram he could have just said you know
[1:03:15] what lot is a hot-headed person he just
[1:03:18] doesn't think right and he always makes
[1:03:20] the wrong decision that wasn't Abram all
[1:03:23] right he acted in the way that we would
[1:03:25] expect a servant of God to act and he
[1:03:29] says I want to rescue my
[1:03:33] brother sometimes you may find yourself
[1:03:36] in
[1:03:38] trouble and I thank God for the trained
[1:03:41] prayer
[1:03:43] warriors who knows how to call upon
[1:03:46] God's
[1:03:47] attention not your once in a while
[1:03:49] prayer I'm talking about the ones that's
[1:03:51] constantly in the prayer closet
[1:03:54] sir brother talks about that black woman
[1:03:56] whose son was dying when she when he
[1:03:58] when he met with them you know you know
[1:04:00] y'all know the story and he went in the
[1:04:02] in the little house where she was at
[1:04:03] brother Ram gave way for her to pre to
[1:04:06] to pray and she began to pray and the
[1:04:08] prophec say you know she had been with
[1:04:10] God right amen you can just tell when
[1:04:14] someone begins to pray that they know
[1:04:16] how to talk with
[1:04:18] God
[1:04:20] Amen and so whenever you in trouble you
[1:04:22] say Lord I need help
[1:04:27] Abram gathered his trained
[1:04:31] servants not a whole
[1:04:33] lot but the trained
[1:04:36] ones and he went after and pursued after
[1:04:42] lot he didn't care about what the kings
[1:04:45] were doing that was not his
[1:04:47] business in the middle of the fight in
[1:04:49] the middle of the
[1:04:51] confusion he was looking for his elect
[1:04:57] after
[1:04:59] Abraham rescued
[1:05:02] lot the Bible
[1:05:05] says in verse 18 and
[1:05:10] MDC king of
[1:05:12] Salem brought forth Bread and
[1:05:16] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[1:05:19] high
[1:05:21] God Abram had an opportunity to see God
[1:05:25] but the only way he saw God was after he
[1:05:28] rescued his brother right amen amen

[1:07:31] things the Bible says I can do all
[1:07:33] things to Christ who strengthens me
[1:07:36] hallelujah hallelujah check the time oh
[1:07:40] we're doing good on time by the time we
[1:07:42] done we still might make the
[1:07:43] special turn with me to Exodus
[1:07:47] 32 let me give you a background around
[1:07:50] uh
[1:07:52] Moses these are Servants of God that
[1:07:54] have seen God yes
[1:07:57] sir y'all know the background of Moses
[1:07:59] just raised up under the household of
[1:08:03] pharaoh and then he realized what his
[1:08:06] true calling
[1:08:07] was killed an
[1:08:09] Egyptian trying to do the work before he
[1:08:13] was properly
[1:08:15] called so he had to make a run for it
[1:08:18] because his life was not in danger but
[1:08:20] his heart was always right with
[1:08:23] God and then he saw a burning bush in
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:26] distance science might try to explain
[1:08:28] why that Burning Bush couldn't was
[1:08:29] burning like that but we know that was
[1:08:31] that was just a supernatural act of God
[1:08:34] and God knows how I get your attention
[1:08:35] cuz Moses was on the run and then as he
[1:08:37] was running he saw like this little
[1:08:39] flicker of light over here and he stop
[1:08:41] God knows how to get your attention
[1:08:44] we're like fireflies sometimes you know
[1:08:45] like little little little fireflies that
[1:08:47] night that just comes they just go to
[1:08:48] the light and they get stung God knows
[1:08:51] how to get your attention and so here
[1:08:54] you go and he goes to the
[1:08:56] he goes to that burning bush and it's
[1:08:57] just burning up in flames and it's not
[1:08:58] being consumed and they hear a voice
[1:09:00] that says remove your shoes for the
[1:09:02] ground that you stand is
[1:09:05] Holy Mo Moses didn't debate that I'm
[1:09:07] sure that's the first time he heard the
[1:09:08] voice of God so he just took off his
[1:09:09] shoes
[1:09:11] immediately God was calling
[1:09:15] Moses and then Moses you know how the
[1:09:18] story goes Moses goes back and he leads
[1:09:20] the people out of uh out of
[1:09:24] Egypt and so God calls for Moses to
[1:09:28] have an audience with Moses and Moses
[1:09:32] grabbed Joshua he says he come with me
[1:09:35] um I want you at the foot of the
[1:09:36] mountain but I'm going to go talk to God
[1:09:39] now in verse
[1:09:41] 32 and when the people saw that Moses
[1:09:44] delayed to come down out of the
[1:09:49] mount now
[1:09:52] again these were the people that saw the
[1:09:56] miracles of
[1:09:58] god how he parted the Red
[1:10:01] Sea how he defeated Pharaoh's armies how
[1:10:06] he brought all these uh uh judgments
[1:10:10] upon the land of Egypt so they knew what
[1:10:13] God was
[1:10:14] about and they saw Moses bringing them
[1:10:18] out and Moses disappears off into a
[1:10:23] mountain and the people
[1:10:25] saw that Moses like Christ delayed his
[1:10:33] coming are we staying
[1:10:36] together the Bible says some say you
[1:10:39] know some question the promise of his
[1:10:41] coming but the Bible says the Lord is
[1:10:43] not slack concerning his promises as
[1:10:46] some men count
[1:10:48] slackness and so when they saw that
[1:10:50] Christ hasn't returned yet they've been
[1:10:52] preaching this message for years y'all
[1:10:55] getting
[1:10:57] quiet when they when they they believe
[1:10:59] this message since they babies now they
[1:11:01] got
[1:11:05] kids all we know is that God is coming
[1:11:08] back God is coming back I'm telling you
[1:11:10] whether I reach 70 years old or not I'm
[1:11:13] still going to preach Jesus is coming
[1:11:18] back amen I'm far too invested in this I
[1:11:23] have too many battle wounds for me to go
[1:11:25] back now true and when the people saw
[1:11:29] that Moses delayed his coming the people
[1:11:32] gathered themselves together unto Aaron
[1:11:34] the ministry of that time and said unto
[1:11:37] him make us Gods which shall go before
[1:11:40] us for as for this Moses the man that
[1:11:43] brought us up out of the land of Egypt
[1:11:45] we don't know what became of the second
[1:11:48] coming of
[1:11:51] Christ that's the reason why in the
[1:11:53] building of the pyramid the stature of
[1:11:56] the perfect man the foundation was what
[1:12:00] patience amen you got to believe this
[1:12:03] word with all of your heart it's a total
[1:12:06] commitment yes sir amen you got to be
[1:12:09] totally committed to it not just
[1:12:11] contributing you got to be totally
[1:12:12] committed to it yes
[1:12:14] sir think I might have shared this it
[1:12:16] was a it was a funny thing where a
[1:12:19] chicken and a pig wanted to start a
[1:12:22] restaurant and they said well what are
[1:12:23] we going to serve the chicken thought
[1:12:26] about it and it's like I got it we're
[1:12:28] going to serve eggs and
[1:12:30] bacon and the pig's like I don't know if
[1:12:32] I like that
[1:12:33] idea the chicken says why the pig says
[1:12:37] well you would be contributing but I'm
[1:12:38] fully
[1:12:44] committed let me tell you Saints we're
[1:12:46] not here to just participate we're fully
[1:12:48] committed to this
[1:12:51] sir if the Rapture doesn't happen
[1:12:53] tomorrow you see me in church on
[1:12:56] Sunday you see me in prayer service on
[1:12:59] Wednesday night as long as God is not
[1:13:01] here yet I'm still going to praise him
[1:13:04] and the reason why I know he hasn't come
[1:13:06] is because I'm still
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] here you got to believe that the reason
[1:13:13] why the Rapture hasn't happened is
[1:13:15] because you're still here yes sir amen
[1:13:18] amen you got to believe you're that
[1:13:20] important to God amen amen
[1:13:25] when I was weak in my faith I had to
[1:13:27] rely on other people yeah before the
[1:13:29] days of cell phones I had to manually
[1:13:31] call people when they didn't enter the
[1:13:32] phone my heart
[1:13:35] dropped especially the ones that I I
[1:13:38] viewed as the most sainted
[1:13:40] individual brother so and so when I call
[1:13:42] him up he didn't pick up the phone rung
[1:13:44] and rung and wrong I called brother so
[1:13:46] and so the phone rung and Rong and wrong
[1:13:48] no one picked up you thought the Rapture
[1:13:50] happened right didn't have cell phones
[1:13:53] back then yeah
[1:13:55] so then you thought the Rapture happen
[1:13:57] finally someone picks up and you like
[1:13:59] praise the
[1:14:01] Lord I'm so happy to hear your voice God
[1:14:04] bless you you going to be in church
[1:14:05] Sunday I'm going to be in church Sunday
[1:14:07] too you want that reassurance and you
[1:14:10] relied on other people but you've
[1:14:13] reached a maturity in your Christian
[1:14:14] walk whether you're walking straight or
[1:14:17] not I'm going to work out my
[1:14:19] salvation I believe that God is coming
[1:14:22] back specifically for me
[1:14:30] there was a minister that there he said
[1:14:33] brother B says if if God if God comes
[1:14:35] back for one person in each state he
[1:14:37] says I'm going to send my wife to
[1:14:39] Georgia one of my children to um New
[1:14:42] York the other one to
[1:14:45] Michigan cuz if he's coming back from
[1:14:46] one person for each state I want one of
[1:14:48] my family members you got to believe
[1:14:51] it I know it's a bit of exaggeration but
[1:14:53] you got to believe that that the only
[1:14:55] reason why you're still here is because
[1:14:57] God is still waking working with
[1:15:03] you and the Bible says
[1:15:06] this and so they blame it where say
[1:15:08] where's Moses where's the second coming
[1:15:11] and Aaron said unto the unto them break
[1:15:13] off the Golden Aries the ministry
[1:15:16] started to
[1:15:18] crack it started to break the people
[1:15:23] started to put pressure on the ministry
[1:15:26] Aaron should have known
[1:15:30] better but the pressure of the
[1:15:34] people they start to question
[1:15:37] things is this true or
[1:15:40] not did this really happen or not do you
[1:15:43] believe it this way or
[1:15:45] not yeah these are testing
[1:15:49] times when we talking about the pressure
[1:15:51] The Squeeze we always thought it would
[1:15:53] be from the outside no Saints this is
[1:15:55] from the
[1:15:57] inside this is directly with those that
[1:15:59] are sitting with
[1:16:01] you the Bible says there will be weeping
[1:16:03] and whing and nashing of teeth
[1:16:06] unbelievers know where they're going
[1:16:08] there's no weeping and whing and nashing
[1:16:10] of teeth they know where they're going
[1:16:13] but those that have come to church day
[1:16:14] in and day out Sunday in and Sunday out
[1:16:17] and thought they were serving God that's
[1:16:19] the Weeping that's the Wailing that's
[1:16:21] the nashing of teeth because they
[1:16:22] believed in the way that they thought
[1:16:24] was the correct
[1:16:27] way the pressure is here Saints and
[1:16:30] Aaron said unto them break off the
[1:16:32] Golden Earrings which are in the ears of
[1:16:34] your wives your sons your daughters and
[1:16:36] bring them unto me and all the people
[1:16:38] break off the Golden Earrings which were
[1:16:40] in their ears and they brought them unto
[1:16:42] Aaron and he received them at their hand
[1:16:44] and listen to this and fashioned it with
[1:16:47] graving
[1:16:49] tool he fashioned it he took the
[1:16:52] earrings and he molded
[1:16:55] this Graven
[1:16:57] image and fashioned it with a Graven too
[1:17:00] after he had made it a molten calf and
[1:17:02] said these be thy
[1:17:05] Gods now they could look at something
[1:17:08] and say this is your
[1:17:11] god and the people were pleased with
[1:17:15] that and when Aaron saw he built and
[1:17:18] when Aron saw it he built an altar for
[1:17:21] it he got caught up in all of
[1:17:23] this and and Aaron made Proclamation
[1:17:26] said tomorrow is the Feast of the Lord
[1:17:28] and they rose up early in the morning
[1:17:30] and offered burnt sacrifice and brought
[1:17:32] peace offering and the people sat to eat
[1:17:34] and drink and Rose up to
[1:17:38] play that's the times we're living in
[1:17:40] today Saints people don't care
[1:17:43] anymore everything's just playing around
[1:17:45] having a good time don't worry about the
[1:17:48] consequences what God what Jesus we
[1:17:51] don't believe in that let me tell you
[1:17:52] something just because you don't believe
[1:17:53] in it doesn't mean it doesn't exist
[1:17:58] praise the
[1:18:00] Lord people like well I don't believe in
[1:18:02] Black Magic it doesn't mean that it
[1:18:04] doesn't exist it
[1:18:05] exists right I don't believe in the
[1:18:08] devil well exist that I could tell by
[1:18:10] the way you're acting that he
[1:18:14] exists well that's the truth I could
[1:18:16] tell by your acting by your action that
[1:18:18] God
[1:18:19] exists just because you don't believe it
[1:18:22] and I can't scientifically prove it and
[1:18:24] I don't have the MTH to supported
[1:18:26] doesn't mean that God doesn't exist he's
[1:18:28] alive and well living in me to tell the
[1:18:30] whole world that he's the same yes today
[1:18:33] today and
[1:18:37] forever that was the that was just like
[1:18:39] it was in the days of Noah they couldn't
[1:18:42] believe I mean Noah was saying hey it's
[1:18:44] going to rain is going to water is going
[1:18:46] to fall from the sky if we need to make
[1:18:48] shelter we need to get ready their
[1:18:49] scientific equipment could not really
[1:18:52] explain how that could happen right
[1:18:55] so you know what the people did they
[1:18:56] Shrugged him off we don't believe this
[1:18:58] nonsense there's no place to preach
[1:19:00] something like that in this
[1:19:03] place and they carried on the merry way
[1:19:06] they were shouting and screaming and
[1:19:07] playing like they were there they
[1:19:09] created their own Gods and one day a
[1:19:11] drop of rain
[1:19:13] hit can you just imagine by that time
[1:19:16] Noah was already in the ark they were
[1:19:22] just maybe might have felt on a few just
[1:19:25] a handful but everybody else was
[1:19:26] shotting screaming
[1:19:28] then hey
[1:19:30] Bob did you feel
[1:19:36] that maybe it was
[1:19:40] nothing I felt this one this time I felt
[1:19:43] it they were confused they couldn't
[1:19:45] explain it cuz it didn't meet their
[1:19:49] expectation God doesn't follow the ways
[1:19:52] of the world his ways is different
[1:19:55] it he'll cause every the Bible says
[1:19:58] every knee shall bow every tongue shall
[1:20:01] confess they start feeling a little
[1:20:03] drops of rain and in the distance to see
[1:20:06] these dark clouds
[1:20:08] forming they hear loud Thunders like
[1:20:11] I've never seen this before can you just
[1:20:13] imagine their heart just sinking into
[1:20:17] their and all of a sudden they feel a
[1:20:19] little gust of wind and little rain
[1:20:22] they're like hey maybe it's not that bad
[1:20:23] where this is very un usual well let's
[1:20:26] just play this out let's see what and
[1:20:28] they were intrigued I can only just
[1:20:30] imagine because they've never seen rain
[1:20:33] before they never seen rain before cuz
[1:20:36] the Bible says there was a dud that came
[1:20:37] from the there was a dud that came from
[1:20:39] the ground that watered the Earth that's
[1:20:40] where that's how life that's how life
[1:20:41] was produced that because of the water
[1:20:43] from the Earth but water from the sky
[1:20:45] they never saw
[1:20:47] that and so when the water start to fill
[1:20:49] up the Earth and didn't
[1:20:51] recede that didn't look too good
[1:20:54] like that that that the category three
[1:20:56] category four that we went through that
[1:20:58] that's a dropping a bucket to what
[1:20:59] happened back in the day of
[1:21:02] Noah multiply that by a
[1:21:04] million around the whole
[1:21:07] earth and so much that when when Noah
[1:21:11] you know let the the the dove out to go
[1:21:13] find a place to rest its feet the Dove
[1:21:15] came back like I don't got no place to
[1:21:16] rest my feet I need to come back
[1:21:18] here there's no
[1:21:21] place that's what they were doing here
[1:21:24] this our singing and shouting and roles
[1:21:26] to play they were just ignoring
[1:21:30] God they want to believe their
[1:21:33] God the world has made a proclamation
[1:21:36] I'm going to worship my god well you
[1:21:38] have added I'm going to worship
[1:21:42] mine I believe that in this day there's
[1:21:45] an Elijah that's withstanding 400
[1:21:48] prophets of Baal
[1:21:50] sir let them call upon their God and we
[1:21:54] will call upon Jehovah and we'll see the
[1:21:57] god that answers by
[1:22:00] fire now here's the
[1:22:03] thing God's having a conversation with
[1:22:06] Moses just I don't know what the
[1:22:08] conversation is about but I'm going to
[1:22:10] ask when I get there on the other side
[1:22:11] but God was having conversation with
[1:22:13] Moses cuz I'm I'm just I'm nosy like I
[1:22:16] want to know what they were talking
[1:22:17] about I got some questions when I get to
[1:22:20] I y'all tell y'all can't tell me you
[1:22:21] don't have questions I got questions
[1:22:23] when I get over there so I was like
[1:22:25] Moses what you guys talk about while you
[1:22:26] guys up there and so while God was
[1:22:28] talking with
[1:22:29] Moses God was observing what was
[1:22:33] happening down in the
[1:22:36] valley and the Bible says and the Lord
[1:22:39] said unto Moses get thee down for thy
[1:22:42] people which thou broughtest out of the
[1:22:45] land of Egypt have corrupted
[1:22:49] themselves go down there
[1:22:51] Moses your people
[1:22:57] now follow the language of the Bible
[1:23:00] because it was God's action bringing the
[1:23:02] people out these were God's people and
[1:23:05] God turns around says Moses your people
[1:23:08] cuz God was
[1:23:09] hot that's what the Bible says he was
[1:23:13] hot your people have corrupted
[1:23:16] themselves meanwhile the hollering
[1:23:18] screaming pray you know doing praising
[1:23:19] the Lord God and stuff like that not
[1:23:21] thinking that God can see this he's
[1:23:23] seeing everything develop
[1:23:25] they have turned
[1:23:27] aside quickly that's what the Bible says
[1:23:31] out of the way which I commanded them
[1:23:33] they have turned aside quickly let me
[1:23:36] tell you you could be sitting in church
[1:23:38] right now all inspired of God no sooner
[1:23:41] when you walk through those double doors
[1:23:43] you're challenged by the devil don't be
[1:23:45] turned aside quickly amen you carry that
[1:23:49] same anointing that you receive here in
[1:23:51] service to your work tomorrow
[1:23:53] morning amen amen you anoint your office

[1:25:07] calf they have worshiped it they have
[1:25:09] sacrificed unto it these be thy gods of
[1:25:11] Israel God is repeating everything to
[1:25:14] Moses that was said down in the valley
[1:25:18] God was with Moses and in the valley
[1:25:20] listening to
[1:25:22] them and the Lord said un to Moses I
[1:25:24] have seen this people and they behold it
[1:25:27] is a stiff neck people and therefore let
[1:25:30] me alone that my wrath May Wax Hot
[1:25:34] against them and that I may consume them
[1:25:37] and I will make of thee a great nation

[1:25:43] people that was your
[1:25:47] fate when you were born you were subject
[1:25:50] to
[1:25:51] judgment there was a Death Wish over you

[1:25:57] Jesus Christ that when he died on
[1:26:00] Calvary 2,000 years ago and he wor he
[1:26:03] said the word it is finished that word

[1:26:30] Hot against your
[1:26:37] people that was that was a good
[1:26:40] move when I when I see Moses I like
[1:26:42] Moses that was a good one that was a
[1:26:44] good
[1:26:45] one why are you hot against your
[1:26:48] people which you brought out of the land
[1:26:53] of Egypt with great power and with a
[1:26:56] mighty hand God this is all

[1:28:20] timid Esther was the only one out the
[1:28:23] entire Kingdom them she approached her

[1:29:34] Ministry is important it's a needed but
[1:29:36] when you're standing by yourself the
[1:29:38] Bible says having done all to stand
[1:29:42] stand
[1:29:48] Hallelujah and in verse 14 after Moses
[1:29:51] did his tactics the Lord Lord repented
[1:29:55] of the
[1:29:56] evil God just kind Cal he's like all
[1:29:58] right all right all right you're right
[1:29:59] you're right I see where he coming from
[1:30:00] with that and the Lord repented of the
[1:30:03] evil which he thought to do unto his
[1:30:04] people and Moses probably like that was
[1:30:06] a close one
[1:30:08] that I had to stay
[1:30:10] quick but here's the thing God s now
[1:30:14] remember now catch this now God's anger
[1:30:17] was waack hot he was he was getting
[1:30:20] ready to tear the people just consume
[1:30:22] them all because he saw what was
[1:30:26] happening Moses was with God he
[1:30:29] like can't be that bad but let me just
[1:30:31] reminder some things and he calm he calm
[1:30:34] got go got down and Moses turned and
[1:30:37] went down from the mount and the two
[1:30:40] tables and feeling really good about
[1:30:41] what he just did he like well I just
[1:30:42] spare the
[1:30:45] people and on the one side read on both
[1:30:47] sides and and the tables were the were
[1:30:49] the work of God and when J then he came
[1:30:52] down and said hey Joshua how you doing
[1:30:53] Joshua like man sounds like there's war
[1:30:55] down there that's what Joshua said
[1:30:56] sounds like there's war and mo was like
[1:30:58] nah no it's just people acting up you
[1:31:00] know I had to stand on their behalf you
[1:31:01] know God was getting ready he killed him
[1:31:02] and so I had to say something about that
[1:31:06] so but praise be to God like that's what
[1:31:08] he did he's like he had to rehearse the
[1:31:09] whole thing back to Joshua he's like
[1:31:10] yeah God was going to kill them but you
[1:31:12] know you and not we would have been
[1:31:13] spared but I talked to God so we're good
[1:31:15] now so then he goes
[1:31:17] down and it came to pass as
[1:31:20] soon and it came to pass yeah
[1:31:24] as soon as he came into the
[1:31:28] camp follow this he saw the calf which
[1:31:32] God has
[1:31:34] saw and the dancing which God has seen
[1:31:38] yeah and Moses anger waack
[1:31:43] hot he's like this is why God wanted to
[1:31:46] kill
[1:31:49] y'all he saw for himself he's like oh it
[1:31:53] made sense now
[1:31:56] but so he t god down and then he
[1:31:57] realized what just happened he's like
[1:32:02] unbelievable his anger whacks hot and he
[1:32:05] cast the tables out out of his hands and
[1:32:07] break them beneath the mount and look at
[1:32:09] the look to the took the calf which they
[1:32:11] had made and burnt it with fire and
[1:32:13] grounded into
[1:32:16] powder ground it into
[1:32:19] powder I don't know what technology he
[1:32:21] had but he had the ability to take that
[1:32:23] Cal that was it must have been a massive
[1:32:25] Cal but he took that Cal and he grounded
[1:32:27] until it was just nothing but powder you
[1:32:30] got to take when the devil got you on
[1:32:32] the throat you got to wrestle with the
[1:32:33] devil put the devil back on your feet

[1:33:07] street there was a man down the street
[1:33:09] from us he saw a black
[1:33:13] snake so he killed the snake but as if
[1:33:17] that wasn't bad enough to kill the snake
[1:33:19] he took the snake like he I guess he
[1:33:21] grabbed something he took the snake put
[1:33:23] it on the street just as calm as you
[1:33:24] want to be went back into the garage

[1:34:04] wanted the other snakes to see what
[1:34:08] happened he could have done this very
[1:34:10] quietly but he wanted other snakes to
[1:34:12] see what happened you got to let the
[1:34:14] devil know if you got others that's

[1:34:39] drink of it my goodness there's
[1:34:41] something to be said about that but we
[1:34:42] keep going and Moses said unto Aaron
[1:34:45] what did this people unto thee that thou
[1:34:48] brought so great a sin upon them what
[1:34:52] did they do to you

[1:35:07] the be the most beautiful thing that
[1:35:09] anybody ever seen I got y'all praise the
[1:35:11] Lord we're going to do this and now he's
[1:35:14] called
[1:35:15] out and Aaron softly
[1:35:18] said let not the the anger of my Lord
[1:35:21] Wax Hot
[1:35:24] he's trying to act like
[1:35:29] Moses you know the
[1:35:32] people they always into
[1:35:35] Mischief you know how the people
[1:35:38] are most just sitting there just
[1:35:40] listening to him for they said unto me
[1:35:43] make us Gods like I have anything to do
[1:35:45] with this which shall go be first for as
[1:35:48] for as for this Moses you know I I was I
[1:35:51] I was tired of having you back the man
[1:35:52] that brought us out of the the land of
[1:35:54] Egypt we don't know what became of him
[1:35:56] even though they know that he was in the
[1:35:58] mountain and I said unto them
[1:36:01] whosoever I said unto him whosoever has
[1:36:03] gold not as if he didn't say give me
[1:36:05] your gold but if anybody got anything
[1:36:07] y'all want to give up y'all could give
[1:36:09] it to
[1:36:10] me let them break it off and so they
[1:36:12] gave it to me then I cast it now listen
[1:36:15] to the language of this then I cast it
[1:36:16] into the fire and there came out this
[1:36:19] Cal just miraculously out of nowhere I
[1:36:22] don't know where it just came from
[1:36:26] I just gathered their all their earrings
[1:36:28] and all their jewelry and I put it in
[1:36:30] the fire and this Cal just came out of
[1:36:31] nowhere Moses like I you know fashioning
[1:36:34] it and anything like that I had that was
[1:36:35] just I mean I'm just as surprised as you

[1:36:40] too your
[1:36:42] words you you may try to say things a
[1:36:45] different way but God knows your

[1:37:22] sin
[1:37:25] come now or let's reveal it on the
[1:37:27] screen half of you if not all of you
[1:37:29] will be up
[1:37:31] here
[1:37:33] Am Lord I want to make it right right
[1:37:39] now God is light you cannot hide
[1:37:43] anything from
[1:37:45] light no sir nothing from light let me
[1:37:48] tell you when that hurricane came
[1:37:50] through we were in Gross Darkness for a
[1:37:52] while
[1:37:53] thank God for a flashlight
[1:37:55] amen because there were toys everywhere
[1:37:58] and if I hadn't seen them it would have
[1:37:59] cost me my
[1:38:02] life but nothing hides from like God is
[1:38:05] light you might say little things you
[1:38:07] might act certain way and you might
[1:38:09] disguise yourself a certain way where
[1:38:10] people can't see it but God sees it you
[1:38:13] might come to church and clap your hands
[1:38:14] sing the songs throw your hands up and
[1:38:16] do everything but God knows you you
[1:38:19] might fool me you might fool your
[1:38:20] brother your sister your Deacon the
[1:38:22] pastor but you can't fool God and you
[1:38:24] can't fool the
[1:38:27] devil come on Saints you got to be
[1:38:29] serious with God don't let the devil
[1:38:32] wake at you after he dropped you off at
[1:38:33] church and says I see in a little bit
[1:38:35] come on somebody we're in a battle with
[1:38:38] the
[1:38:39] Devil he's not here to play with you
[1:38:41] he's here to tear you up bring you down
[1:38:44] but you got to take the word of God
[1:38:46] seriously cuz your life depends on it
[1:38:48] your family's life depends on it
[1:38:53] amen I've taken up too much time I'm
[1:38:55] wrapping it
[1:38:58] up and when
[1:39:00] Moses saw that the people were naked for
[1:39:04] Aaron had made them naked unto their
[1:39:07] shame among their
[1:39:10] enemies then Moses stood in the gate of
[1:39:13] the camp and said who is on the Lord's
[1:39:16] Side let him come unto me and all the
[1:39:19] sons of Levi gathered themselves
[1:39:21] together unto him
[1:39:24] they wanted to see God so they made a
[1:39:28] calf and they worshiped it that became
[1:39:31] to
[1:39:32] God that's what we're seeing today
[1:39:35] that's exactly what we're seeing uh
[1:39:37] being replayed today people want
[1:39:39] something to worship they want something
[1:39:41] to kind of uh to kind of gloat
[1:39:44] over and so they're they're this is just
[1:39:48] we're becoming a handful a few a
[1:39:51] minority that's believing
[1:39:54] God because the
[1:39:57] world they're going a different
[1:40:01] course we're living in Gross
[1:40:05] darkness and if there's ever a time for
[1:40:07] your light to shine it is
[1:40:11] now there is a clear line of different
[1:40:15] of
[1:40:16] differentiation between what we stand
[1:40:19] and what we believe and what we say Amen
[1:40:22] to versus what the world
[1:40:25] believes you're G to be tested in every
[1:40:28] way but that's just because God has
[1:40:30] confidence in you you're going to be
[1:40:33] tried in every way that's just because
[1:40:35] God believ you're going to overcome
[1:40:38] you're going to have trials and
[1:40:40] tribulation but the Bible says to him
[1:40:42] that
[1:40:44] overcometh to him that overcometh not to
[1:40:49] them but to him it's an individual
[1:40:54] Affair it's an individual Affair if you
[1:40:58] want to see
[1:41:00] God created me a clean
[1:41:04] heart and renew a right Spirit within
[1:41:08] me create in me my Lord a clean
[1:41:13] heart blessed are the pure in heart for
[1:41:17] they shall see
[1:41:20] God God bless you Saints I know I've
[1:41:22] taken some extra time but appreciate you
[1:41:25] this
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:29] morning let's stand to our
[1:41:33] feet God dealt with the situation with
[1:41:36] Moses and the people
[1:41:39] there so much to be said but there's
[1:41:42] countless examples throughout the Bible
[1:41:45] of how God
[1:41:47] servants how they saw God whether it was
[1:41:51] Abraham we didn't get even didn't even
[1:41:53] get into Jacob that wrestled with God
[1:41:56] Jacob was getting ready to face his
[1:41:59] past he was getting ready to face Esau
[1:42:02] they didn't leave in good terms so he
[1:42:05] was afraid to meet
[1:42:08] Esau and he needed to see God he
[1:42:12] wrestled with him all night wrestled
[1:42:19] wrestled sometimes you're so Disturbed
[1:42:21] in your spirit that you can't sleep
[1:42:24] that you just need to find yourself
[1:42:25] committed to prayer wrestling with God
[1:42:28] say Lord I need something from you and
[1:42:31] when Jacob was done he never walked
[1:42:35] straight
[1:42:36] again he never walked straight again but
[1:42:40] his name changed from Shyer and all
[1:42:42] these things to Prince of
[1:42:47] God we're an elect group
[1:42:51] Saints the days are winding
[1:42:53] down I'm sure I'm not the first to make
[1:42:56] comments on this but we see how the
[1:42:57] political uh landscape is playing out we
[1:43:01] see what's happening Wars around with
[1:43:04] Russia and Ukraine we see the
[1:43:06] disturbance with Israel and the
[1:43:09] surrounding areas with Hamas Hezbollah
[1:43:12] these are all signs of the
[1:43:15] time it was the angel that says watch
[1:43:18] Russia watch Russia the King of the
[1:43:21] North
[1:43:23] it's been laying dormant for a while and
[1:43:26] now Russia flexed its muscle and says
[1:43:28] I'm going to go after Ukraine and it's
[1:43:30] caused the NAT Nations to say what are
[1:43:32] we going to do about this situation
[1:43:33] because it's a delicate situation
[1:43:34] Ukraine's not part of NATO so they can't
[1:43:36] react and that's one of the reasons why
[1:43:38] Russia is going after Ukraine to prevent
[1:43:41] them to be part of NATO because now if
[1:43:43] they are part of NATO then that allows
[1:43:45] the NATO countries to have access to
[1:43:47] Russia and Russia's like I ain't going
[1:43:48] to have
[1:43:49] that so the bear has been awakened and
[1:43:53] he's flexing his
[1:43:57] muscles in Israel from the attack with
[1:44:00] Hamas back in October 7th of last year
[1:44:03] to Iran Hezbollah
[1:44:07] Lebanon these are not just coincidental
[1:44:09] things
[1:44:11] Saints we just came out of a great
[1:44:13] pestilence
[1:44:16] Co and we're seeing history potentially
[1:44:18] on the verge of occurring with a new
[1:44:21] presidential candidate
[1:44:24] these are all
[1:44:27] signs don't be so grounded in what
[1:44:30] you're work this be studying in the
[1:44:34] scripture the Bible says look
[1:44:37] up your Redemption draweth
[1:44:40] nigh and even Catholicism they're not
[1:44:43] silent they're operating behind the
[1:44:46] scenes Saints because remember the
[1:44:48] prophet says don't worry about the
[1:44:49] bamboo curtain that was of China
[1:44:53] don't worry about the purple
[1:44:55] curtain the Iron Curtain but he says
[1:44:58] worry about the purple
[1:45:03] curtain denominations are forming a
[1:45:06] coalition around Catholicism they're
[1:45:09] saying we're not so bad we're not so
[1:45:10] different let's just give arms and arms
[1:45:13] that's the mark of the
[1:45:15] beast so much to get into but these are
[1:45:18] signs of the
[1:45:20] time the Bible says man's heart
[1:45:23] are filling them for fear that's what
[1:45:26] the Bible says men's hearts are filling
[1:45:28] them for fear I remember right before
[1:45:30] the invasion of Ukraine they were
[1:45:32] interviewing the people there they're
[1:45:33] saying we're not worried about
[1:45:34] anything and all of a sudden this
[1:45:37] happened the Bible says when they say
[1:45:39] the Bible says when they shall they say
[1:45:40] peace and
[1:45:42] safety then sudden
[1:45:44] destruction when they shall say peace
[1:45:46] and safety then sudden destruction God's
[1:45:49] waking us up I go back to how I first
[1:45:52] intr
[1:45:53] I first started to say in the beginning
[1:45:55] don't trust on your bank account don't
[1:45:56] trust on your job don't trust on your
[1:45:58] position your roles don't trust on your
[1:45:59] house your cars you got to be vigilant
[1:46:02] and make sure that your family is in
[1:46:03] order your life is in
[1:46:06] order because this is the great taken
[1:46:08] away of the church the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ that day is going to happen
[1:46:13] Saints let me tell you when a when Noah
[1:46:15] went into the ark the Bible says it was
[1:46:17] nice and sunny for 7even days not a drop
[1:46:20] of rain fell so people sat there and
[1:46:23] ridiculed like what was he talking about
[1:46:25] there is nothing what was like there was
[1:46:27] nothing to worry about 7 days nothing
[1:46:29] change when the bride gets out of here
[1:46:31] Saints everything's going to go as they
[1:46:33] have been people are going to go to work
[1:46:35] politics is still going to play business
[1:46:36] is still going to play they're going to
[1:46:37] go to the ball games life is going to
[1:46:39] continue as it is and then
[1:46:42] boom a sudden
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:46] awaken I I don't know how you phrase it
[1:46:48] but I was talking to a friend of mine
[1:46:49] and he was talking we were talking about
[1:46:50] nuclear power and they were talking
[1:46:52] about
[1:46:54] Mutual destruction there's a there's a
[1:46:56] term for it it's called it's mutual
[1:46:58] destruction that means I have the
[1:47:00] ability to annihilate you and you have
[1:47:03] the ability to annihilate me so we
[1:47:06] mutually agree not to get beside
[1:47:08] ourselves because it could be total
[1:47:12] Annihilation and now we're and now we're
[1:47:15] seeing where we're just tempting fate in
[1:47:20] these powerful Nations whether it's
[1:47:21] Russia China North Korea those places
[1:47:26] that hold that have nuclear Powers
[1:47:29] there's just one finger away from
[1:47:31] pressing that
[1:47:33] button but before that button is pressed
[1:47:36] every one of us is going to be out of
[1:47:39] here I have a home somewhere beyond
[1:47:42] Glory there's a land beyond the river
[1:47:46] that is called the sweet
[1:47:49] forever I don't know about you Saints
[1:47:51] this is not fantasy this is
[1:47:54] reality I'm longing for a
[1:47:57] place where certain profession doesn't
[1:48:00] exist there won't be a need for doctors
[1:48:03] over there I appreciate them for what
[1:48:06] they do here but there won't be a need
[1:48:08] for them over there there won't be a
[1:48:10] sound there will be a certain sound that
[1:48:12] don't exist over there there won't be
[1:48:14] the sounds of sirens anymore
[1:48:20] yes on my way to go grab something some
[1:48:23] lunch I have my kids with me in the way
[1:48:27] that I would normally
[1:48:29] take the route that I would normally
[1:48:31] take was
[1:48:33] blocked so I had to go
[1:48:37] around and then I saw that it was also
[1:48:41] blocked there was a Florida state
[1:48:44] troopers on one
[1:48:45] end Florida state troopers on the other
[1:48:49] end and as I got to the light I looked
[1:48:53] in the distance it was a horrific
[1:48:55] accident that just had
[1:48:59] happened I looked back to my children I
[1:49:01] say to myself
[1:49:04] Lord haste the day of your
[1:49:09] coming cuz I believe in you but there's
[1:49:13] a certain degree of fear that you have
[1:49:15] that you're constantly Waring
[1:49:19] against Lord watch over my family
[1:49:23] watch over my loved
[1:49:27] ones I believe in
[1:49:32] God you don't know what family is bound
[1:49:35] is now going to get that
[1:49:39] news you treat every moment with just
[1:49:42] such
[1:49:44] preciousness I remember and I'm closing
[1:49:47] I I don't mean to take you I
[1:49:49] remember when we lived in North Carolina
[1:49:53] I had a coworker of mine her and her
[1:49:56] husband went for a bike ride she took
[1:49:59] the day off they wanted to do something
[1:50:02] as a couple she had just bought him a
[1:50:06] motorcycle and that day they went for a
[1:50:09] bike
[1:50:10] ride that evening there were services
[1:50:13] that were happening at their Church she
[1:50:15] was telling me about it they were all
[1:50:17] excited about going to services that
[1:50:19] evening so they came back
[1:50:23] after what was a really beautiful day
[1:50:24] was a
[1:50:26] Friday and then she gets off the
[1:50:30] bike he looks at her and says those
[1:50:33] words and I remember how she says it
[1:50:35] because it really impacts you he says
[1:50:37] I'm going to go for One Last
[1:50:40] Ride those were his exact
[1:50:43] words those were also his last
[1:50:48] words he never made it to church that
[1:50:51] night
[1:50:55] he never got a chance to make it to an
[1:50:57] altar
[1:51:00] call and just stuck with me ever since
[1:51:02] that was years
[1:51:04] ago I said Lord every time there's an
[1:51:06] opportunity let me not miss it if you're
[1:51:09] tugging at my heart let me respond to it
[1:51:13] cuz the Bible says in Hebrew while did
[1:51:15] is yet called today Harden not your
[1:51:18] heart as in the day of
[1:51:20] provocation if God's speaking to to you
[1:51:23] listen to that still Small
[1:51:25] Voice you could be sitting here going
[1:51:27] through the motions of church service
[1:51:29] but never really invited him
[1:51:31] in invite him
[1:51:33] now these days are going to get
[1:51:36] darker the times are going to get more
[1:51:40] difficult but I believe that the Bible
[1:51:42] says greater is he that is in me than he
[1:51:46] that is in the
[1:51:47] world with every heads bowed and every
[1:51:49] hearts and every eyes closed

[1:58:39] for either
[1:58:41] party but when we look at the time that
[1:58:44] we're living in we see a party that's
[1:58:46] pushing abortion like it
[1:58:49] is that disturbs me
[1:58:53] for one it is you know back in the day
[1:58:56] they offered their children to mulak
[1:58:59] that was their God the sacrificing of
[1:59:02] children and that's what we see

[1:59:31] and see how the how Satan is
[1:59:34] moving remember he showed Jesus when he
[1:59:37] took him to the top of the mountain all
[1:59:38] the kingdoms of the world he said it was
