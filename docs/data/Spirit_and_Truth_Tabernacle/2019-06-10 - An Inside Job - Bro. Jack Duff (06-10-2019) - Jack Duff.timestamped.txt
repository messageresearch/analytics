[56:24] Justin they said he says he said you
[56:28] know we want to make room for the
[56:30] preacher to come we thank God for the
[56:32] singing but we want to make room for the
[56:34] preacher to company say the reason we
[56:35] make room for the preachers now is
[56:37] because when we get to the other side we
[56:39] won't need preachers it says so we want
[56:42] to make room for the preachers now
[56:43] because they'll do all the worship over
[56:45] they say so what we got to do is make
[56:48] room for the preacher so we can make
[56:49] preparation for the singers to get to
[56:53] the other side to sing yeah amen so I
[57:00] said yeah I agree with that you know and

[1:02:24] amen so we want to just take for a topic
[1:02:28] today it's an inside job
[1:02:31] it's an inside job and as I was just
[1:02:35] referring to this little quote that was
[1:02:37] shared earlier this week I want to start
[1:02:39] off by reading this out of the message
[1:02:42] the identification of Christ and all
[1:02:44] ages amen identification of Christ and
[1:02:47] all ages says the Prophet says I just
[1:02:51] passed my birthday last Monday and I was
[1:02:53] 55 years old you know the Brandon family
[1:02:55] never did asked me to join the family I
[1:02:58] was born a Branham a man and that's how
[1:03:03] that's how we are Christians
[1:03:06] we're just born a Christian by the power
[1:03:10] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:03:12] and we are Christians by birth
[1:03:16] hallelujah you're not a Christian by
[1:03:19] association hey man you're Christian by
[1:03:22] birth we were talking a little bit about
[1:03:24] that in Sunday school you know the Jews
[1:03:26] a man because of their religious order
[1:03:29] they felt like they were somebody a man
[1:03:32] the Philadelphia Church age because they
[1:03:34] joined church they thought that they
[1:03:36] were somebody a man but we learned out
[1:03:41] it's not about just joining church but
[1:03:43] it's about coming into Christ's
[1:03:45] hallelujah a man in the Philadelphia age
[1:03:48] their problems that they felt just
[1:03:49] joining church was enough and we have
[1:03:51] the same spirit that has settled in this
[1:03:55] day because people feel like just
[1:03:57] because they go to a message Church
[1:04:00] hallelujah Amen that that's enough it's
[1:04:03] not about coming into the church but
[1:04:06] it's about coming into Christ hallelujah
[1:04:09] amen we want to we want to make sure
[1:04:12] we're taking the people deeper we're
[1:04:14] happy to have you in church amen but if
[1:04:16] you never come into Christ you'll always
[1:04:18] have problems hallelujah you'll never
[1:04:21] have an overcoming life unless you come
[1:04:24] fully into Christ hallelujah amen and
[1:04:28] let me tell you something we'll be
[1:04:29] really coming to Christ
[1:04:31] amen all of us should act to sing all of
[1:04:34] us should be looking the same when we're
[1:04:36] really coming to Christ when we're all
[1:04:37] governing amen our life according to his
[1:04:40] word amen it should produce the same
[1:04:43] behaviors in all of us brother an and
[1:04:46] say the Holy Ghost will not behave
[1:04:48] itself in me and then misbehave itself
[1:04:51] in you that's not the same Holy Ghost it
[1:04:54] might be a ghost but not the Holy Ghost
[1:04:57] closer to God somebody a man you've got
[1:05:00] to be born into this thing all right
[1:05:04] come on now we're just born a Christian
[1:05:06] by the power of the resurrection of
[1:05:09] Jesus Christ and we are Christians by
[1:05:11] birth that that makes us new creatures
[1:05:15] and I like this in our old nature we can
[1:05:19] never be Christians now let's not just
[1:05:21] kind of skip over these things in our
[1:05:23] own nature let me just put it this way
[1:05:25] if you consider yourself a Christian a
[1:05:29] man you ought to be able to identify
[1:05:31] that there was an old nature you had to
[1:05:37] be converted from something and actually
[1:05:44] everybody was a liar because you were
[1:05:46] born into a speaking lives a man you had
[1:05:50] all kind of attributes of sin that were
[1:05:52] manifested itself inside of your flesh
[1:05:55] honey but will you become a Christian we
[1:05:58] should see the attributes of God and his
[1:06:01] characteristics being manifested inside
[1:06:04] some flesh all right somebody you had to
[1:06:08] come from something your nature should
[1:06:10] have changed if your nature didn't
[1:06:12] change we have a problem
[1:06:14] hallelujah oh yeah all that happens is
[1:06:17] you just become a pig a man with a
[1:06:20] tuxedo on you know what happened with a
[1:06:23] pig with a tuxedo on hallelujah it made

[1:06:33] and you put this tuxedo on them and and
[1:06:35] you put some cologne or some perfume on
[1:06:37] that pig and man's nice smelling Pig but
[1:06:41] as soon as you let the pee
[1:06:42] go hallelujah the pig will find its way
[1:06:46] right back to that same old Pigpen again
[1:06:49] Oh hallelujah
[1:06:51] you just can't change the pig on the
[1:06:53] outside this is the inside char come on
[1:06:58] somebody soon as the trial comes that
[1:07:03] nature will kick in and what God wants
[1:07:07] to do is kill that nature change that
[1:07:11] nature oh yeah
[1:07:13] amen rather than going back to what you
[1:07:16] used to do to the old nature you do
[1:07:18] something new and God makes you a new
[1:07:21] creature howl you know you know if God
[1:07:25] delivers you from smoking and drinking
[1:07:27] if if your nature doesn't change it soon

[1:08:17] inside job the devil trying to destroy
[1:08:21] your inside and God trying to build you
[1:08:22] up all right let me finish reading this
[1:08:25] quote here I want to want to just kind
[1:08:26] of share a little bit more hey Manny
[1:08:28] says this hallelujah that makes us new
[1:08:31] creatures in our own nature we could
[1:08:33] never be Christians that's the reason
[1:08:35] they we have so many calling themselves
[1:08:36] Christians and live in any kind of life
[1:08:39] I told you this quote was given to me I
[1:08:41] ain't even find this when they just gave
[1:08:43] it to me amen
[1:08:45] you so many calling themselves
[1:08:47] Christians and living any kind
[1:08:50] life they never experienced that
[1:08:54] born-again that's something that changes
[1:08:58] you a man that takes the life out like
[1:09:02] pulling the blood out of a man that's
[1:09:04] got a certain type of blood and putting
[1:09:06] another type in him it's pulling the old
[1:09:09] life out of the man and inject him the
[1:09:13] life of Christ in the believer and then
[1:09:16] he becomes a new creation he's a new
[1:09:18] creature now you'll never be a new
[1:09:20] creature unless your manifest in the
[1:09:22] life of Christ Oh hallelujah see your
[1:09:26] old nature survive I should have died
[1:09:28] amen if you call yourself a Christian
[1:09:30] your own nature should've died the
[1:09:32] things that you used to do you shouldn't
[1:09:34] want to do anymore I know that sound
[1:09:36] good preaching amen the things you used
[1:09:39] to do you shouldn't want to do anymore
[1:09:41] if you still have a desire to do those
[1:09:43] things something went wrong somewhere
[1:09:46] hallelujah oh I feel good hey man yeah
[1:09:50] you know this week we'll went to the
[1:09:52] meet and the brother preached the
[1:09:53] message on salvation came to a
[1:09:55] convention and preach salvation I say
[1:09:57] wow what a sermon right because you know
[1:10:00] he was making some comments about you
[1:10:02] know when you really look at church we
[1:10:04] got a lot of head knowledge amen but our
[1:10:07] lives are not measuring up with the
[1:10:09] words glory to God hallelujah we want
[1:10:14] real Christians amen true Christianity
[1:10:16] something that changed on the inside
[1:10:18] because if it changes on the inside then
[1:10:21] it will truly reflect itself on the
[1:10:23] outside hallelujah glory to God let me
[1:10:27] go on a little further Paul a man was
[1:10:30] changed from the inside
[1:10:32] and Paul he once was a persecutor of the
[1:10:35] Christians but he became the messenger
[1:10:37] to the first Gentile Church age he was
[1:10:40] made a new creature by what happened to
[1:10:42] him on the inside he made a statement
[1:10:44] here in Galatians 2:20 he says I am
[1:10:47] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:10:49] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[1:10:54] now look at look at this he says yet not
[1:10:56] i but Christ liveth in me and I like
[1:11:00] this
[1:11:00] and the life which I now live can you
[1:11:05] statement the life which I now live what
[1:11:09] it says is that I used to live something
[1:11:11] else Amen I used to be a different
[1:11:13] person
[1:11:14] until I came in contact with Christ and
[1:11:19] if you can't share the same testimony
[1:11:22] that Paul is sharing then you need to
[1:11:25] make contact with Jesus Christ the life
[1:11:30] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:11:32] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:11:35] and gave himself for me the life I now
[1:11:38] live which means now he lives something
[1:11:39] different than what he used to live
[1:11:42] hallelujah amen let me go on to another
[1:11:44] quote here out of you must be born again

[1:27:56] me just read a little something here
[1:27:57] from you
[1:27:58] for you a man this is either the message
[1:28:00] the supernatural the Prophet makes a
[1:28:01] statement says I was preaching not long
[1:28:03] ago the tape recorders here the boys was
[1:28:06] with me they took a sermon on the hidden
[1:28:09] life of Christ how to get into Christ
[1:28:12] and how that some people has ups and
[1:28:14] downs some people has ups and downs a
[1:28:17] man it's a place you have to find that
[1:28:21] out of course produced manna sure many
[1:28:24] people are living right in that manner
[1:28:27] they eat in the manna but they don't
[1:28:30] live the right kind of a life a man it
[1:28:35] says there there up and down
[1:28:36] they have ins and outs and bad days and
[1:28:40] good days but you meet people that
[1:28:42] absolutely no matter what the weather
[1:28:44] was or what the condition was there on
[1:28:47] the housetop all the time he's found
[1:28:50] that secret he's found an atmosphere to
[1:28:53] live in I like this because we're trying
[1:28:55] to get everybody in this place right I
[1:28:57] mean you know you can live in a place
[1:28:59] where you ain't got to be in and out up
[1:29:00] and down all the time you ain't got to
[1:29:02] have the testimony oh my god the
[1:29:05] testimony Amen everybody you don't want

[1:29:20] time how long it's gonna last
[1:29:23] you're gonna have a life like that right
[1:29:27] amen and the reason that you have a life
[1:29:29] like that's because you have not allowed
[1:29:31] Christ to come inside some of us are
[1:29:36] satisfied being on the outside some of
[1:29:39] us Sam stop being associated with this
[1:29:42] thing but God wants to have a real
[1:29:45] genuine fellowship with you he wants to

[1:30:50] could have the Holy Ghost but you need
[1:30:52] refill it's you you need to always stay
[1:30:54] in the presence of God it was telling
[1:30:57] about our brother one time and God fit
[1:30:59] God God forgive me I don't want to talk
[1:31:00] about people but you know he got away
[1:31:02] went out to preach the gospel but when
[1:31:04] he got out there he got caught in some
[1:31:05] sin they got caught him saying he did
[1:31:09] something that just got he just
[1:31:11] completely got exposed and see the devil
[1:31:13] always set you up like that

[1:31:27] negative testimony with him can I say
[1:31:31] something
[1:31:31] i pastor one people in its church that
[1:31:35] when they leave town they're not coming
[1:31:37] back with a negative testimony we want
[1:31:42] to church that's clean a man I mean no

[1:31:53] where know everybody gotta have a hidden
[1:31:55] life in Christ hallelujah not just the
[1:31:58] one on the outside but the one on the
[1:32:00] inside hidden life wit Christ listen he
[1:32:04] goes on to say this in the Old Testament
[1:32:05] how that the congregation was fed from
[1:32:08] bread out of heaven they lived in three
[1:32:11] different atmospheres in the courts and
[1:32:13] they're the manna fell and the
[1:32:15] Israelites eat manna he eat the same
[1:32:18] manner they did at every other place
[1:32:20] same manner but remember that inside the
[1:32:23] courts in the art was a place fixed
[1:32:25] where the manna never did get Old Glory
[1:32:28] otherwise it got oh it wouldn't last to
[1:32:31] nine o'clock in the morning they grind
[1:32:34] it up into inter meal and make some
[1:32:36] cakes out of it and eat it and they find
[1:32:39] out before the Sun went down they were
[1:32:41] hungry if they didn't gather enough
[1:32:43] listen and that's what's the matter with
[1:32:46] people today they got campground cramps
[1:32:52] campground cramps they go to a revival
[1:32:57] and have a great time oh I'm preaching
[1:32:59] real good we get ready to have some
[1:33:01] meetings glory and everybody get excited
[1:33:05] about the meetings and I think you
[1:33:08] should go to the meetings with an
[1:33:09] expectation we're looking for God to
[1:33:10] meet you at the meeting but after the
[1:33:12] meeting over we still looking for God to
[1:33:15] meet you you got Campground cramps
[1:33:20] listen he says they go to revival they
[1:33:23] have a great time the first thing you
[1:33:25] know a little after that before another
[1:33:27] revival could come along they're back in
[1:33:30] the world again god help us we don't
[1:33:33] want that type of testimony let God do
[1:33:36] something on the inside and we won't
[1:33:38] have that kind of testimony hallelujah
[1:33:42] the same way that you are willing to
[1:33:45] allow God to do things on the outside
[1:33:47] you willing to dress the part
[1:33:49] once you go a little further and now let
[1:33:51] him open up your heart and like Lord
[1:33:53] come on in and work on this I reminded
[1:33:55] of the story of the the man that you
[1:33:57] know he invited the Lord Jesus into this
[1:33:59] house and they said now you can come in
[1:34:01] and say but this room right here this is
[1:34:02] your room don't come out this room at
[1:34:04] all this is it that's all he that's what
[1:34:05] he said this is your bedroom don't come
[1:34:07] out and it says okay and so you know
[1:34:11] that later on that night the man got a
[1:34:13] visit from the devil and man there was a
[1:34:15] big struggle going on the house
[1:34:17] furniture flying all over the place and
[1:34:19] you know and this man just getting beat
[1:34:21] to a pulp by the devil and the next
[1:34:24] morning he get up and he just he all
[1:34:26] bandaged and wounded and and Jesus comes
[1:34:28] out in his day he say how come you
[1:34:30] didn't come down and help me stay

[1:45:07] 50 years ago all right I said this is
[1:45:13] this is an out of court if you know this
[1:45:14] we read the scripture I read it out of
[1:45:16] Exodus 40 when I read that amen if you
[1:45:20] would just notice let's read it again
[1:45:23] hey man I want you to look at that
[1:45:26] notice when God gives him the
[1:45:28] instructions to bill
[1:45:31] man the tabernacle what God does is
[1:45:34] start with the insight and works outside
[1:45:39] hallelujah Amen and here's the problem
[1:45:42] many of us want to work the outside and
[1:45:45] come inside but when God establishes
[1:45:48] things he starts from the inside and
[1:45:50] then works outside hallelujah this is an
[1:45:54] inside job look at it hallelujah amen
[1:45:58] the scripture says the Lord speaking to
[1:46:01] Moses saying on the first day of the
[1:46:03] first month shall I set up the
[1:46:05] tabernacle of the tent of the
[1:46:06] congregation and thou shalt put there in
[1:46:09] the Ark of the testimony and cover art
[1:46:12] with the veil what is this this is the
[1:46:15] most holy place a man this is where the
[1:46:19] Ark of the I mean actually where they
[1:46:22] had the cherubim sitting over amen the
[1:46:24] mercy seat and they're in this aren't
[1:46:26] ahead of the law you know of Moses that
[1:46:28] the Ten Commandments have said this is
[1:46:30] the most holy place that had to be set
[1:46:32] up first oh my goodness the most holy
[1:46:36] place look at a night it goes on to say
[1:46:38] this and thou shalt bring in the table
[1:46:40] and settle order things that are to be
[1:46:43] set up set in order Punnett and thou
[1:46:46] shalt bring in the candlestick and light
[1:46:48] the lamps thereof and thou shalt set the
[1:46:51] altar go for the incense before the Ark
[1:46:53] of the testimony and put the hanging of
[1:46:55] the door to the tabernacle this is you
[1:46:57] know what we're looking at here is the
[1:46:59] inner court hallelujah amen he started
[1:47:02] first with the most holy place then he
[1:47:05] start working on the inner court oh my
[1:47:08] god wants to work from the inside out
[1:47:11] Amen not the outside in God is moving
[1:47:15] from the inside out because what is on
[1:47:18] the inside will reflect itself on the
[1:47:21] outside hallelujah Amen just don't be
[1:47:25] satisfied being a Christian hanging
[1:47:27] around the outside of the church Amen
[1:47:30] God wants to do something on the inside
[1:47:32] of your life look at he goes on a little
[1:47:35] further here in verse verse six he says
[1:47:37] and thou shall set the altar of the
[1:47:39] burnt offering before the door of the
[1:47:41] tabernacle the tent of the congregation
[1:47:43] and thou
[1:47:44] just set the lever amen between the ten
[1:47:47] of the congregation and the altar shall
[1:47:49] put water there and what they did with
[1:47:51] the lavra and everything and this is
[1:47:52] where they brought their sacrifices to
[1:47:54] be washed
[1:47:55] amen they were bringing them a mint to
[1:47:57] this brass flower and their sacrifice to
[1:47:59] be washed out here but this was what we
[1:48:01] considered the outer courts Oh
[1:48:03] hallelujah
[1:48:04] you know when God set this up he also
[1:48:07] set up to a place where a man only the
[1:48:10] high priest could go into that inner
[1:48:14] court amen the most holy place let me
[1:48:16] put that the high priest once a year
[1:48:19] could go into that most holy place going
[1:48:22] to God but when Jesus died on the cross
[1:48:25] amen the temple veil was ripped on the
[1:48:28] inside exposing what was only inside
[1:48:32] which brother Brennan said it was death
[1:48:35] if a person went in there and they were
[1:48:38] not the high priest in Old Testament
[1:48:39] time but today hallelujah amen it's back
[1:48:44] to you if you never go all the way into
[1:48:47] that place with Christ don't be
[1:48:50] satisfied just being a church member God
[1:48:53] wants to do something on the inside
[1:48:56] don't hang in the outer courts don't
[1:48:58] hang in the intercourse but go requites
[1:49:03] [Applause]
[1:49:05] we establish when you read that script
[1:49:10] he established that the most holy place
[1:49:12] first that's where God want a fellowship
[1:49:14] what I said the holiest of holies
[1:49:17] established first to enter court was
[1:49:18] established secondly the outer Court was
[1:49:20] established thirdly and unlike this when
[1:49:23] Jesus rose again the process started in
[1:49:27] the grief in the grief right there was
[1:49:31] something happening on the inside Amen
[1:49:34] the tomb might have been Amen they feel
[1:49:37] the tomb but but but but after they
[1:49:39] settle to him inside what was happening
[1:49:41] he descended into hell he lose those
[1:49:44] that were wrongfully imprisoned and if
[1:49:48] the devil got you in prison this morning
[1:49:51] hallelujah Christ has come
[1:49:53] set you free from the inside you know
[1:49:56] you know some folk some folk can be in
[1:49:59] church but inside they still battling
[1:50:03] all kind of stuff your your body is here

[1:50:09] you hadn't really reached the spot where
[1:50:12] you free okay can I just be let me let
[1:50:14] me also go a little further so much
[1:50:16] happy to be identified with just coming
[1:50:19] to church and when you come you think we
[1:50:24] all suppose like do something special
[1:50:26] because you here let out a rant copied

[1:50:45] I'm gonna be happier when I when I see
[1:50:47] you go living the way you supposed to be
[1:50:49] living huh Oh glory and I don't want you
[1:50:55] to just get can I put it this way a
[1:50:57] Sunday morning dress you dress for the
[1:51:03] occasion on Sunday morning but soon that
[1:51:05] service is over you don't went right
[1:51:09] back to that old lifestyle when that's
[1:51:11] gonna change you know if this was the
[1:51:18] last sermon you heard because you died
[1:51:22] on the morrow you know what you would
[1:51:25] not be able to stand before God and say
[1:51:28] you ain't hurtin it the Holy Ghost
[1:51:33] warned you today this thing got to
[1:51:36] change on the inside hallelujah the
[1:51:41] outer court was established thoroughly
[1:51:42] alright when Jesus Jesus rose again the
[1:51:45] process starting to grade they sealed a
[1:51:47] tomb he descended hell loose those that
[1:51:49] were wrongfully wrongfully in prison and
[1:51:50] then after that he appeared to the
[1:51:52] disciples so many others externally
[1:51:54] could see a man that that was proof of
[1:51:58] the resurrection so things started
[1:51:59] inside the grave before they manifested
[1:52:02] outside
[1:52:04] God need to do some things inside your
[1:52:06] heart and let me tell you once he's done
[1:52:09] it inside it will manifest itself
[1:52:11] outside let me go on a little further
[1:52:15] I got a this just really blessed my
[1:52:19] heart as I was reading this particular
[1:52:20] scripture out of Exodus 40 when God
[1:52:24] established a man when they established
[1:52:28] the tabernacle he had Moses build from
[1:52:31] the inside out and here's the thing we
[1:52:34] always approached it from the out of
[1:52:36] course that's justification that's just
[1:52:38] water baptism right folk get baptized in
[1:52:40] water and and I can almost if I was to
[1:52:43] raise my if I was actually people how
[1:52:44] many y'all been baptized in water I'm
[1:52:46] almost a whole church to raise ahem I've
[1:52:47] been baptized the name of Lord Jesus
[1:52:49] Christ but that's all you did was got
[1:52:51] baptized the Bible say it repent be
[1:52:55] baptized name Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:52:57] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:00] and I'm gonna tell you when you get the
[1:53:02] Holy Ghost it changes things we're not
[1:53:05] just on the outside inside many of us we
[1:53:11] got we got in a court religion which is
[1:53:14] sanctification we don't change the way
[1:53:16] we dress that's about all we got
[1:53:19] hallelujah but we want to get to the
[1:53:22] most holy place Amen where you have
[1:53:24] received a baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:26] this just don't change the way you dress
[1:53:28] this changes your nature
[1:53:31] I was talking to a brother this week and
[1:53:35] we talked about receiving Holy Ghost
[1:53:36] well yeah why y'all want the Holy Ghost
[1:53:38] so much because you just want to lay
[1:53:39] hands on people you want to pray for
[1:53:40] people no no no no we're trying to get
[1:53:42] rid of that nature that nature you got
[1:53:45] that's fussing and arguing with us right
[1:53:47] now the Holy Ghost come to take out that
[1:53:50] nature the Holy Ghost to stop you from
[1:53:52] cursing huh the only goes to stop you
[1:53:58] from smoking stopped you from drinking
[1:54:00] the Holy Ghost that changed everything
[1:54:02] about you you understand the Holy Ghost
[1:54:06] is his nature it's not your nature
[1:54:09] anymore it's his nature so what you saw
[1:54:11] Christ Erwin should be reflected in and
[1:54:13] through you now oh my god
[1:54:17] we're not just trying to lay hands on
[1:54:19] folk we try to get their nature changed

[1:54:40] there was what they called the out of
[1:54:42] course we watch what was in the out of
[1:54:44] course then there was a holy place or
[1:54:46] the first valve that inside of the
[1:54:48] Holies of Holies and what furniture was
[1:54:50] in the outer court what was at the veil
[1:54:52] of the holy place of what was in the
[1:54:54] holiest of Holies now we're going to
[1:54:55] speak tonight on the holiest of Holies
[1:54:57] the dwelling place where God Himself -
[1:54:58] well then days he dwelt in his
[1:55:01] tabernacle and today he dwells in you as
[1:55:04] his tabernacle but we must make this
[1:55:07] place a dwelling not an outer court
[1:55:11] place or the first holy place but we
[1:55:13] must live with God in the holiest of
[1:55:16] Holies consecrated hidden life alone

[2:02:33] other times that you know we'll come up
[2:02:35] here like it was in the book of
[2:02:36] Corinthians where this man wasn't living
[2:02:39] in sin with his I believe it's a
[2:02:40] stepmother right he's living in sin and
[2:02:43] and and this sin that this man's living
[2:02:45] in Paul addresses it hallelujah and I

[2:08:15] the prophecy let's bow our heads just a
[2:08:17] moment and and we're gonna do that in a
[2:08:19] second but I want to encourage you get
[2:08:21] into Christ don't don't just hang around
[2:08:23] Church don't don't do that don't do that
[2:08:26] that's not gonna be enough right I mean
[2:08:29] if you you still feasting off the things
[2:08:31] of the world something wrong your
[2:08:32] appetite and change something
[2:08:34] something's not happening somewhere and
[2:08:36] and and and you know some of us we've
[2:08:39] been man we've been baptized that's
[2:08:40] great but that was years ago
[2:08:42] that was years ago you got baptized how
[2:08:44] are you progressing now in God trial
[2:08:52] come up we don't see you when you got
[2:08:55] when you got this thing really on the
[2:08:56] inside of you no matter what comes up in
[2:08:59] your life a man you remain a Christian
[2:09:01] you remain faithful to God hallelujah
[2:09:05] church right you remain faithful this
[2:09:08] thing has got to happen on the inside
[2:09:10] this is not something that a man that
[2:09:13] that you just hear about glory to God I
[2:09:16] was talking to a man the other day and
[2:09:18] and he was saying how they were he was
[2:09:20] restoring a home you know and if you buy
[2:09:23] a house and you're gonna restore it the
[2:09:26] first thing that he said I said what'd
[2:09:28] you do to restore you start working with
[2:09:29] me outside first say no no no no no I
[2:09:31] don't work on the outside I work inside
[2:09:34] you got wiring that need to be upgraded
[2:09:38] he left Kauai no I'm worried about the
[2:09:40] outside this place will burn down if you
[2:09:43] don't get the wiring change hallelujah
[2:09:46] so there's things that have to be done
[2:09:48] on the inside in order to manifest on
[2:09:52] the outside church if III can't make it
[2:09:55] no plainer than that I can't make it no
[2:09:58] simpler than that this thing has got to
[2:10:00] be done your life hallelujah in Christ
[2:10:04] what happens on the inside is more
[2:10:06] important than anything else I I thank
[2:10:09] God when we get people coming to church
[2:10:12] a lord knows I appreciate that but if
[2:10:15] you leave this church and you go right
[2:10:16] back out there doing the same old stuff
[2:10:18] he was doing before you came to church
[2:10:19] can I ask a question what good the
[2:10:23] church do what good
[2:10:35] I believe God has already started to
[2:10:37] work inside of you but I believe it's up
[2:10:40] to you to open up and allow him to do
[2:10:42] more and I'm gonna tell you something
[2:10:45] God wants to take you further and deeper
[2:10:47] than you ever imagined in his love but
[2:10:52] it's up to you to open up the door there
[2:10:54] was a painting this man built the he had
[2:11:00] the scripture behold I stemmed the
[2:11:02] doorknob and he got inspired me he
[2:11:05] designed the painting around that script
[2:11:07] I stand at the door and knock and they
[2:11:10] looked at the painting and and everybody
[2:11:12] start criticizing it and like well you
[2:11:14] know this nice this door and everything
[2:11:16] that you got this real nice is saying
[2:11:18] you know real pretty and everything say
[2:11:19] but the only thing problem with your
[2:11:21] door is it don't have a doorknob to let
[2:11:24] people in he said oh oh no no no no it
[2:11:27] was designed that way I did it that way
[2:11:30] intentionally so what you mean he says
[2:11:32] because the doorknob is on the inside
[2:11:34] and Jesus stands at the door not if you
[2:11:37] got to be the one to open up on the
[2:11:39] inside and allow him to come in today
[2:11:43] he's knocking at your door
[2:11:57] father the word has been preached you
[2:12:03] know every person that would be here
[2:12:05] today you know the conditions of our
[2:12:06] hearts and Father you have told us by
[2:12:14] inspiration that this has got to be an
[2:12:16] inside job something has to happen on
[2:12:19] the inside of each and every person here
[2:12:24] God it can't be it can't be father just
[2:12:32] outward manifestations just things that
[2:12:36] we do to try to please other people God
[2:12:40] something has to happen a change must
[2:12:42] take place from the inside help us to
[2:12:47] realize God that going to church won't
[2:12:50] be enough not when we stand before you
[2:12:53] on that on that great day Lord it won't
[2:12:55] be enough just to say that we went to
[2:12:56] church it won't be enough just to say
[2:12:59] that we were baptized in water God that
[2:13:03] the whole purpose the whole purpose of
[2:13:05] being baptized in water amen and going
[2:13:09] to churches that we would go on to
[2:13:10] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:15] Lord don't let our hearts be settled
[2:13:21] until we Lord have come to a place where
[2:13:26] we God have gone all the way with you
[2:13:28] Lord that that's my prayer that's that's
[2:13:31] what I desire Lord that every heart will
[2:13:34] come to a place they realized God it's
[2:13:36] got to be all you they got to give up
[2:13:37] everything
[2:13:39] Jesus
[2:13:40] [Music]
[2:13:42] we can play games with this the rapture
[2:13:47] is upon us the time is at hand we don't
[2:13:52] know God if if ever we would come Lord
[2:13:55] and that'll be the last service that we
[2:13:56] ever attended
[2:13:57] we don't know God we assume that we'll
[2:14:01] be back next week we assume that we'll
[2:14:04] be back next month we assume these
[2:14:06] things but we don't know God when it's
[2:14:08] gonna be the last time we walk into this
