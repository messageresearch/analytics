her another year as well don't forgive that we will continue our scheduled services the way that we have been doing things we know things are starting to change and we are tuning our eyes on that and whether started left some of the businesses that were not extension to reopen as well as we know church was always identified as essential but we've been doing things just to keep the social distancing we've been doing multiple services just trying to serve everybody we continue to do that until we just kind of get a little bit more information then we'll start opening up and trying to get everybody back together a fellowship but we try to do the best we can just to kind of follow the guidelines it's been given us that's still satisfying you know some of these are the same so so for this week a man will do it and next week we do plan to do the same thing for right now that past the information that's given to us will certainly get the information out to not just think so frog waves back we'll still be doing our mayor's go on Facebook there's a virtual service so you have the ability to follow us on periscope or on Facebook and I'm sure to be a blessing they meant to you know Friday services from right down till further notice we'll let you know what those things will start back again on Friday services and our Saturday services will continue to be at nine o'clock and twelve o'clock amen service types that you asked for and we'll just kind of continue to go forward I also just wanted to make a quick announcement as we we give a man to the Lord I tell you what I am so grateful to the Lord that he continues to meet the needs even in the midst of this virus God has blessed the Saints to be able to penniless a Penni but still work for or god bless you in another job a man if your job goes down god bless you another job so God's finger needs and that's what he promised to do so we are just wanting to announce a man if you want to give and you're online you're streaming you want to give do that either through PayPal or now the church has cash at the Albany then the church got cash app so if you wanted to give through cash after the church I don't know what all this new cash spirit II guess that's what it is right but uh it cashed out it would be spirit and truth Tifa spirit of tabernacle we have that at the bottom and also when you're giving if you if you're giving through a paypal ever ask that you would just about donating to me free and always that PayPal you send to a friend option and the email address that you use for sent to a friend is giving at John four to three north three over that way we eliminate any fees that they power try to assess us so just give to a friend and descend into giving them one two three nice to email address

the Lord you have supplied the proven and you have Jehovah Jireh and God we just appreciate that so as we give cheerfully back to you printed to a user for the furtherance of the kingdom here on earth and Jesus thing we pray those that are inside the sanctuary if you desire to give we have a box on the table when you're leaving today just put your if you're offering it in the box that's actually what they did in the scripture they used to have a box in the back of the church that people would put their offer again if you remember of Jesus saw the woman come in and gave him two pence and said she'd give more than even everybody they weren't necessarily pass in the basket they just gave to put it inside this box so we have the box there a man that you can give and put in another thing I want to just make mention of is that we are still collecting funds for the new piano that we desire to purchase we're hoping to get it next month and and now you know if you desire they help us with that we're still collecting the funds there's some envelopes there on the table you can just get into this just right on a piano and make sure it mentions the private place bar holds and desires that

and sit down just to chat with a little bit listen to just how they got to the point I want to be baptizing justice I felt like the Lord of doing work in their hearts and and just trusting that he would carry them forward me man but I tell you God is still moving in the midst of all this that's going on and he's calling his people a man one by one he's calling them so we're very grateful they meant just to be able to be a part of their story and then let's just prepare our hearts to receive the word of the Lord on today a man let's stand and a man will welcome our precious brother quick

preeminence Lord take control and break your way the bread Lord in a simplified way that we can eat and be satisfied we thank you we glorify your name in Jesus Christ and we pray amen god bless you shall we pick up Bible and just have a just have a little scripture praise be to God god bless you musicians for all that you do for estella richly bless you the Laurie let's go to second Corinthians chapter 5 let's read from verse 1 to 7 2nd Corinthians 5:1 to 7 it reads for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle when dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan and earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we will be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that has he that has Roth as for the same soft in his God who also has given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we at home in the body we are absent from the Lord 7 for we walk by faith not by sight amen Lord may add redeemed blessing to the reading of your word shall be seated glory hallelujah let's take our second Bible reading if we can officiant chapter 3 verse 14 to 7 officiants 3:14 to 7 the book of poor to the Christians in Ephesus amen and the same scriptures for 2,000 or more years it's still valid amen science can bring out something medicine at the cost of time they'll say this treatment doesn't work but the Word of God is Satana amen it doesn't matter the might get older the more get richer so we can so get vitamins from the word of the Lord Ephesians 3:14 2:17 for this course I bow my knees on to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named and I want to know what does it signal of that verse 15 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may be the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God oh sorry I'm reading another scripture who God bless you so that is it does end of description amen so best to set the whole family sorry verse 15 the whole family in heaven and earth is named Jesus Christ amen but the office condoms are no Jesus Christ but a jack is brother Jack what a polychaete then how are we named Jesus Christ we will find out name in a human form name is just a word but name in spiritual meaning is a nature it's an attribute is a spirit there's a street behind every name that's a life form we had every name so we are named the family in heaven and the family in Earth is named after the Lord Jesus Christ because that's the only name that is a name all other billions and trillions of names are known names the only name before God is the name Jesus Christ amen that is why he named his sons and daughters Jesus Christ so my name is not Jesus crab my name is Kru quick please go hallelujah my name is Fisk and even spoken you afraid but that's not name that's not a name literally the name is the nature of Jesus Christ so for him to identify you as a son or daughter he has to put his name up on you he also put his nature in you he has to put his real life in you he also put his gene in you he also put his blood in you he has to be you be put himself in you amen so that you become him so the family in heaven and earth is named even the Angels so how can Angels be named after Jesus Christ their life in the Angels is the life of Jesus Christ that's why they do his walk Satan was in him after Jesus Lucifer had power he was created giving glory but it wasn't named after Jesus Christ so it's a tempura bean and all that came comes out of Lucifer is tempura amen but then if you are son of God you are a daughter of Elohim you are named after the Lord Jesus Christ and you live eternally amen so let me read one scripture John 6:29 John 6:29 certain people came to Jesus Christ they wanted to work for God and Jesus gave them as very simple answer jesus answered and said to them John 6:29 jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that he believed on him whom he has sent he believed on whom he on him whom he has sent amen so if Jesus said but I guarantee you it better Jackson but I get a gariand - but a symbol that okay but a garyun good trouble a symbol to meet me as his o'clock and but as much I want to offer a jack I want to maybe go and clean his house but then he's less in a restaurant or he's somewhere he's in Miami and it's em but i guarante to tell you to go meet him in Miami and so no I want to really work for buddy Jack I want to do something good for a jack I'm going to result so clean and mob the hopeless our let's Sarah Connor awake I'm just suggesting I'll stay put I'm going to do all everything want me to do you I want to do for you but anybody just said that come and meet me in Miami Airport so if you want to wait for by the Jack you don't have to go and wake in his home go and take over his job go and clean his house you just go to Miami that is where he went that is a wake he want you to do but that is not a wake I don't really spend any energy by driving to Miami I want to really wafer to Jack on to clean his house and please mortgage and do everything I can do for Jack but he said that meet me in Miami that is the work he want you to do amen so this what that word for the Lord they were maybe young energetic young men and women they wanted to do something for God the water to maybe build a temple for the Lord they wanted to do something great which is good but what of God said believe on Him whom I sent out to you amen believe believe is like this Bible is black in color I believe it that is mentor that is not belief believe if you bring the word belief be life become the life of Jesus Christ because the one that he sent he's put his life in him and when you believe you received believe means receive and eat and become that amen so when the Lord sent his word through his prophet through seventh through his hand made unto you and receive the word and either way you become him that is when you come work for the Lord amen so just like we get out a lot you can go to a Jack's house and work all day long and you be sit in Miami with him for you you didn't work for him that work is work done is zero amen so to work for the Lord you have to believe a set with who heartedly with all your heart that what a lot has sent on to you amen what gasps oh no - is his weight how does it send into depth through the Prophet through the Apostles through the passes through the bishops from evangelists through teaches through we men through men amen it could be a little sister who give you a testimony she is the one the Lord has sent to you if you believe that word believe the Lord Jesus Christ amen in the times of the Old Testament there was a captain code name and he was full of he had leprosy was a big man he had all the money everything but he had leprosy and there was this lot of handmade called a was the name company the name wasn't mmm our come again oh I think it's a okay I think it will come you get it right so this little girl is running through my mind start thinking it will come love stop thinking it will come so the wife of me man that or we have a prophet who can I mean rid you of your leprosy so if you don't mind your husband I can take you to my prophet my pastor you can pray for you and your leprosy will leave you so for also eventually accepted and when it kept became before I think the girl is called Rhoda is that right no no no that okay she has no name let's pray that way right let's go sister so this is Science Institute and the key the captain's wife and they went to the prophet and the Prophet was said go and kick shower or bath swim in the river Jordan seven times and all your liberals will leave you and this one was so upset I wanted to come in I mean you meet me and tell me something maybe do some miracle she do something out full sensation and you are telling me to go and I mean swim in a river bath in a river he was mad he was like really mad and the little girl said I've told you to do something big maybe to do to go and kill a lion or bring a lifeline on probably you fight and do it but it is so simple the Word of God is so simple so finally came back himself he listened to the feel funny and went to swim or we went to bath in the river seven times and the leprosy left him amen the same thing the Word of God is life it could be so simple that if you don't have something here to cook in that word it will pass through one here go through the next year and you not know that means the Word of God amen but thank God he puts something in us the control tower that is able to detect the way that when you hear the word something you begin to stay up that this is who I am this is where I belong to this is what I want to hear this was I was made up for God blesses the Kylene good to see you this is what I was made up for and then you receive that one who heartedly amen and I begin to have effect in your life so we want to title our Semin feel funny the absolute love of God to you amen glory hallelujah whew funny the absolute love of God to you now what is it feel funny when I talk about few funny tea fan is not in the inner scriptures it's a theologian way to describe the Spirit of the Lord the weight body the celestial body the true you the love of God to you amen what do you think about love you might think love is like if somebody gives you 1 million that person really really loves you that is not love that is perish that money can perish when I is in the form of credit card in form of paper American dollar dead presidents inaudible candle all right it's the president if you see Lincoln Washington Welles name them Adams Quincy Adams they are dead president so when it is the money's already dead it goes into your pocket and it just vanishes it's a dead president that's what we labor for right so if you give you billions of debt president is gonna just melt out you know you just give a let let's have a little economic downtown down 10 all the money will melt out the investment vanishes it sizzles off so you can put your trust in that money that is no laugh that can help you to do something earthly as we need it as human beings but that is not absolute that do not take you know way just within a month companies have lost yeah whatever just name them they are capital small businesses have shut down since our lines are going bankrupt they need government to build them the government is already bankrupt so where are we going can you put your trust in those systems absolutely no that is not the love of God that is good as long as we live here we're gonna need them but that is not in China by God give you something that will stay with you the rest of your life that is a wet body that is the Holy Spirit that is the end s of your life on this earth that is all that you are aiming for if you miss that target just like per day but the analogy if you don't go to Miami to meet brother but a jack and you go and clean all his house you submit a target you didn't work for the Lord the Lord said I depart from me I didn't know you amen so before you came here they'll not already know that you're going to go here he ordained you for this life he owed ended to go into this sinful world world full of sin unbelief in the quiddity confusion depression anxiety just name them medicines all over cancer HIV full of death the Lord ordained you to be here and for you to be able to live here manifest him he put a little a lot of spot something little but a button a light in you called a solution being called a representation called a wet body called a few funny and that was with you even when you didn't know amen sometimes if you are by yourself all alone it's like someone is following you it's not someone follow you is the true you that one toward that want you to let you know that you have a pain in you you are not just by yourself amen and that is the real you amen that is the true you amen that is a celestial body so the few funnest few means invisible God funny means made visible I think it's a Greek word so God wanted to be visible in this dimension the a lot of Street here but you can see them with his eyes so God has to wrap you around sixteen element of flesh and blood of calcium potassium ion iodine cosmic light and then put the seed in it glory hallelujah let's just read the little codes here praise be to God glory to God let's read from the message our prophet preach God and the entombment tomb when you hear about tomb we think about cascade burial but there's another entombed in 1988 5 7 - 0 4 - 0 5 7 - 0 4 - 0 the end human okay let's read paragraph mm paragraph $50 is even that and then no doubt in my mind but that is what Jesus had in his mind when he was here on earth was the infallibility of gas it ran away for we know that in him - all the fullness of Godhead body the entire Godhead was in him he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost but world enough in a human form the few funny of God the great image of God that he made man in then pleased him in the eighth amen so before you were pleased here you had a few funny way before the foundation of the world glory hallelujah he had a body God isn't without a bodyguard has got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it and they saw it any loose like a man 51 it's just an impression that is this is of what that is this earth is an impression it's a shadow of the feel funny and everything on earth the beauty the sweetness the ability of the earth is nothing else in the world but an answer to a far better than that that wins when we leave this world for everything in earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven everything is that is good everything that is righteous everything that is beautiful trees birds everything is just a pattern of what is in heaven 52 our life our own life is just a pattern it's just a shadow not a real thing is the negative side so why is the positive if this life we adore we cherish we work for we put on the best clothes the best houses the best shoes the best price the best tuxedos the best wedding garments name them the best vehicles is a negative then where's the positive we need to write a look for the positive amen it takes death to develop the picture to put you back in that feel funny we come from so you come from the few funny the few funny didn't just drop here it's not going to be when you die but you come from the few funny you know the Word of God is like a nugget it's like a good when you get the good it does something to you amen the law review this to me when I was in England one time I was reading and I could read the message and fall asleep would laptop on my on my chest and I look at as a week back from the few funny we come from so we already come from the few funny we are not trying to get a few funny but we keep from the few five amen it's known now God is trying to get you a to funny because you have done something good because you have given your life to him but you came from the few funny that's your origin before I came here you came from your heart before you came to the church you were some way you are in your home amen let me give an analogy let's say you go to town go shopping and if you can shot let's say Walmart or Publix wherever there's gunshot what I gonna do you quickly jump in your vehicle if you have your family around run I will go back away to restaurant no to your house because you don't know what's gonna happen at the restaurant around so you go back to your house so your house is where you come from that is your origin amen so before you get this negative that we are struggling for trying to bet I trying to give educated trying to give it health trying to do all that it is so that negative a decorated donkey slide is a donkey you can decorate an ass and put all the velvet clothes on it or the best clothes embroidery on them that donkey is lana's it's like donkey it's not going to make become a human being so no matter how we better this guy no matter how cream it up give it a best hairdo give it a beautiful hair cut like butter butter butter a Simha has got his hair cut if fighting for the negative why don't you fight for the positive if you are putting so much emphasis on the negative which you filled out with no matter how we try to polish it up it is still going to dissolve anyways no matter how long he lives here you can leave us old as Adam I think it was 9:30 Methuselah was adding nicest the nicest nicest night is that when I go back to wake him from is when I dissolve so why don't we put emphasis on their positive which is the feel funny which is your origin what is the house who came up who came from amen glory hallelujah who is going to spend his money so the Walmart is that is Columbus in a Walmart do you do that do you buy pendants or the Walmart I love this format is where I shop it's it's the Pens are filled out hey let me get some plates and Graham pitched in the Walmart you never do that the money the corporate dekenia billions don't put in my pocket it's not my job it's not what I just go and shop over there you read up put your money in your home we're innovate your home so if you put so much emphasis on this negative which is like a Walmart you're just going shopping it and live out how much more your home [Applause] this is just a Walmart it will show up in it 400 years 50 years two years five years five minutes some people don't even last more than 20 minutes so we wouldn't just get born and just go back to the other side 200 years with a Walmart you're not gonna live there forever you just shop and get few things over there and then go back home so if you've got money because then you renovate your home you paint your house amen if you want to put something emphasize something that is glory glorified it feel funny amen let it build a wet body amen but the Canopus infidel he's the one who and Jos forever amen Walmart is just Walmart is a corporate amen this one belong to the earth no matter how much you paint it no matter how much you polish it out the beautiful clothes the best food you eat is so going back to be negative go back to the earth glory hallelujah praise be to God oh man let's finish up set put put us back in the few funny we come from it is death to develop the picture now death has got to portion we look at death as somebody who dies naturally which is good is great but death is the new birth is killing the old nature the old man or the old woman the negative side that gives the contrast because we are all born in sin besides Adam his wife incest Adam and Jesus Christ all the rest of mankind were born through man and woman no Paul I think a Jew said that a man born of humanness is full of trouble but few days so the one that came through a woman and a man is full of trouble you can get sick when a child is born it doesn't take long the first and the charr does is cry do you cry when you are happy why does a baby cry when it's born because it's full of trouble it breathes its own oxygen it doesn't take long I begin to remain teeth and then fever so the trouble begins even worse in a childhood so you can put your trust on that you can put your trust in the eternal body amen so death is when you are born again when you are born by the Holy Ghost baptism the old person dies out by the consuming fire of God by the pillar of fire the local fire consumed that tempura body and then Jesus Christ himself the one who ordained you and encouraged you to be on this earth he takes over this flesh and renews renovated transformed it to the image of the Father amen and when we are born again he has this body will dissolve but because there's light in the body it's not the same like the old person I used to be your desires changes you don't go to place I used to go you don't drink no more you don't faster the world you don't there's a niche in you that is of heavenly that is eternal that is holy that's why we call it holy ghost goose is a spirit but as what aspect of sin is not a sort of sittin at love things that are holy so we call it Holy Ghost amen Christ in you the hope of glory so it takes resurrection is that then in the resurrection sorry it's the negative side it takes death to develop the picture to pit us to put us back in the feel funny we come from then in the resurrection we come in his likeness a resurrected body what a beautiful not only beautiful but is the real solemn truth of God's eternal word that we will be like him amen when we are born again then we come like Jesus Christ because without a new birth yes you are not you are not him yet you have an attributes but on so price is born in your heart onto Jesus Christ is forming you and then we get to do the eternal work of God that is when you are born again glory hallelujah now let me read a little quote from a lemma Cobb can bid from who is this make acidic blessed be the name of the Lord let's do this make it as murky Sadiq 6 5 or 2 2 and E so now we are getting we're making Sadek remember I said I was a man one time Abraham was promised to have a child with his wife and Sarah for 25 years one day he was sitting there thinking about himself and three men just appeared three ordinary men they were not angels with wings to know the way he mam among human beings but then Abraham had something in him that was able to detect so he saw that this is not just ordinary people who live in another village and came to visit me he saw that this is Christ himself this is the Almighty God Elohim Jehovah so Abraham began to talk to Jehovah give up beginning to talk to Abraham and Sarah ham can I hide anything from you guess what he was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah but because Abraham receive believed he became him so God could not do nothing but to declare to Abraham to the Prophet amen Karuna virus is going on the whole world is shut down a lockdown but you God won't do nothing until he declares it to you because you have accepted his word you become part of him you I 10 I had feel funny you receive their way to be born by the word of the Lord Amen so you don't get distress about death because they developed if it makes you more real amen glory hallelujah so may kiss a deck appear to Abraham in a human body and talked to Abraham and he sent two messengers to Sodom and Gomorrah and then we begin to for for their promise by talking to Abraham Abraham didn't know he was conversing with Ibrahim telling him what he's gonna do BrahMos pleading for the people of Montgomery because his nephew lot was there just like this time everybody's crying for their loved ones because we don't know what's going to happen is the whole population going to be wiped from the earth with coronavirus when we have our loved ones who are not saved so that's why God is calling you before that this is a time you don't have time God is just giving us just a minor what we are seeing now is just a minor when you look at things that I go to unfold on this earth because this earth has got an owner God is going to harvest the earth he planted months since Adam up to the last time he's going to is going to have a sit some day but are we ready to be harvested that is a question if I in your heart you are not ready to be harvested then you have to make it right today amen if you have a be afraid of death that if I die today I don't know where I'm going that is a time harden order your heart receive the word with all your heart and what else what a power to transform amen so God appeared to Abraham in a physical body how did he do it the celestial body just by thoughts God doesn't have to have Mason to create a house by thoughts he creative an earth and the few funny move into into the earthly body and appear just like brother Simba like a human be just about a Garen and I appear to Abraham communing with Abraham toward him what he's about to do on earth and then when I had to do his commission but then Abram was changed just by meeting my cathodic the next Abram was real he woke up as a young man of eighteen twenty years his wife woke up was 90 years Abram was hundred years already and he realized his change is like what's going on here I look like a 20 year old young man he's right up the same thing I'm also looking like I'm 18 or 16 years old how make Hasidic has changer body that was a type of the rapture amen they were rapture from the old age to a young age that was in the flesh and the same God has put something in you that before the atomic bombs before anything would drop you can break this body amen when I was in Pentecostal preachers that one day Jesus is going to come yes and when it comes gonna hang in the skies and one be able to say Jesus you're gonna be caught up to him you'll be raised away caught up to him so it doesn't matter what you do just do whatever I want to do when you see Jesus in the sky just say Jesus and you'll be fly like like a robot you just got caught up with him but as a lie that is what the truth amen there's no need if that the kids and has no need everybody can see Jesus even Satan can see Jesus but it's coming like a thief the sky the weight is what is coming amen if you receive the word he's coming maybe or to D the coming of the Lord maybe my today today might be the coming of the Lord to me when I hear his word it could be the only time I hear the truth it could be today be the last time I will not hear nothin no more and I've got a choice got us giving us a choice as a human to receive the weight or to reject it if I receive with all my heart then what would transform me but if I reject it I'm done amen praise be to God so the coming of the Lord might not be the way we think like Jesus is coming the sky and coming hang in the sky but it might be coming me brother Jack preaching that went to you amen and if you received a weight that is a come not a lot is going to transform your life praise be to God amen glory hallelujah to the Lord many time people afraid of death I saw a story a temple job today in the brothers what's up there was a ship traveling into somebody's to travel by ship and this Irishman was coming from Ireland to New York and I think about 30 minutes before the rich show there was a typhoon so this she begin to move I mean higgledy-piggledy and the captain said hey we've got a problem here we might not make it up if I'm not able to I mean I mean we didn't able to move out from this typhoon probably gonna be I'm gonna go under the under the ocean and this Irishman said praise God so the captain said this money didn't get it so she went close by I said ma'am what I'm trying to say is that we didn't 30 minutes if able to you know fight our way through we can land in New York the shores of New York if not within 30 minutes we are gonna be under the ocean there lady said praise God is that why you praising God when you're gonna be under the ocean I said I didn't understand you understood everything you said is that a yes I'm going to visit my daughter in New York if we're able to make it obvious my daughter if you go under the ocean I've got another daughter in glory so if I'm not able to make it I'll go under the ocean I'll be with my daughter in glory line I'll be the solution dimension so I don't lose in any way if Corona Corona took my flesh I mean with my loved ones at the other side if I make it kuna for the law so the Christian doesn't die amen you don't lose when you give your life to the Lord whichever you you a winner amen because we've got a few funny buddy within you you've got a celestial willing to see you amen that has got that pop transformation so we have to be like the Irish women that we should be once a time up and prayed up already she prayed up in Ireland before she bought the ship and you have to be freed up don't wait for chaos and confusion before you pray up in other words not just even prayer don't wait for when coronaviruses come before you think about receiving the holy goose you have a purpose on this earth you came from somewhere you're gonna go back to somewhere make sure you've got the wind make sure you are you and your few funny I in alignment amen make sure we come you a few funny because that is who you are glory hallelujah so make it which make easily paragraph four it's a now God in this teach in the stage of his creation later formed into flesh Jesus from what from the grid beginning spirit the Spirit then came down to the word bringing itself out the way doesn't yet make itself the word doesn't yet make itself it's just booked out and Murphy later he became the flesh Jesus motto to teach death for all of us honest when Abraham met him he was murky sonic he enforced here what are the attributes who do in a finer end every son of Abraham every son of the faith who absolutely do the same thing but I want you is that I want I want you to watch what we have to come to also we see him revealed in Ruth and in borås as a kinsman redeemer how he had to come to be flesh now we see the attributes sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form but but they feel funny this body is subject to the world and ernest waiting for the NS change of their body now they're different with the difference between him and you s-s-san see he was at a beginning the word and an unmarked he came in and leaving that in the person of Maquis Aleta we never heard of no more make history because he became Jesus Christ make his luck was a priest but he became Jesus Christ now bypass that now you bypass that because in that form he knows all things and you've never been able to know know that he had amen what is the prophet talking about makers that came to meet Abraham now Jesus came through his teeefani didn't bypasses to you funny that's why I was able to become all his trials Jesus didn't have any defect he overcome every temptation of the devil you are not entered more than Jesus Christ he was tempted by the devil through his mind through human beings through different means but if I came all of them because the thief he came through a few funny by you and I didn't come through at you funny face we bypass it we had a few funny but we had to BiPAP bypass it to be tented of sin not always to be born in sin and because we were born in sin we couldn't overcome like Jesus so he has to come and die and what we bypass restored that bypass onto us amen that feel funny was there your eternal body was there before the foundation of the world you were a daughter of God before you were brought forth by your great-great grand grandparents but then you didn't come through the line you came through the flesh form so that you be born in sin listen this death this sickness take persecutions and different things in the earth then when that a lot of time you hear the word of God the wedge transform your heart consume the old person destroy the old man do away with the devil who was leading you in the wilson then christ became the centerpiece of your life restore a few funny that you lost amen you hear from you too funny how do you hear from you with you funny is it from the skies no the kingdom of god doesn't come without the vision the kingdom of God is within you the city's in you the Tiffany's in you we are not using we see using the flesh just like you have you have to come by yourself to go out it doesn't mean you are not in your clothes amen we have to cover Soph in the liquefier is the same liquefier and liquefier is what what can consume satan can any natural fire consume the devil the devil says spirit demons are spirit demon of death HIV sickness confusion robbery the aspirin your demons their life form and natural fire cannot consume them so what can consume them it is the Holy Spirit but when the holy sprit is concerned it consuming them in the form of judgment we call it the lake of fire not a physical fire lake that you put people in to be consumed but is the holy similarly goes that give you the new birth that consume Ison the simile goes because Satan cannot repent you continue to do more evil and evil and his weapons onto the finally got a lotta for them to consume them completely out of the earth amen recently I was stood in a cancer medication and one of my professors said that she's a cancer specialist and she said I did some research on lymphoma type of cancer and the cells when you observe assess on a micro microscope you see eyes two eyes like the eyes of a beam under the microscope staring at you how can it be it's a life form can size a crab is a demon and live from that take your life and destroy your natural life forces your body to multiply and produce abnormal cells and the a demonic life-form and now this surely I'm under the microscope like eyes watching you who can can you so what does medicine do medicine try to treat a symptom try to correct the breaking of the cells but medicine cannot cut that demons that are staring from the microscope but the pillar of fire the holy goose Jesus Christ alternate II can consume them and destroy the cancer out of a person and set up a sin free amen and that is the power that you have God has given to you amen you may not have all the money on the planet but God has put something in you is greater than their every power on this planet amen greater than a politcal powers greater than sickness that you can speak and notice demonic life-form will be destroyed amen praise God hallelujah when Jesus was here he cast demons from people but now we are even going beyond casting demons he casts demons into the sea if you cut him into a sea we drink we take we use fish from the sea is that right if you cast them out they look for another vessel to enter them in but consume them let the Holy Ghost in you consume those demon because the judgment of God has began in the house of God so if you see the devil in your loved ones in somebody that you love smoking their life's out this trendy alliance with cigarette and cancer you have got a power and authority to speed a life amen to destroy that cancer from them to destroy that demon from them to bring them on to Christ so that the Holy Ghost in them will be activated amen the few funny be activated because you have got Holy Ghost in action they don't have the Holy Ghost in action they have in a seed form and the seed need water and sunlight and oxygen and add to or germinate and what it needs the salad is in your heart the oxygen is in your heart and when you speak you listen origin into your life one into your loved ones you release the sunlight into your life ones don't worry if it doesn't jam it right away amen when planted see when you plant a seed on the ground you don't plant a seed and go and come just a nest in see where's my seat no don't do that way the seed us is a law of nature you just keep importing the water point the organic fertilizer whatever sunlight water sunlight and then it's going to take his time there's a law in nature the law of the earth caused it to rot and then the life is will come out of it amen if you prefer somebody to eat the person doesn't get world don't give up if you prefer your loved one I don't see them in church don't give up if you prefer your family and you know they don't just continue in their ways don't give up it is working anyways amen because when we read the Bible that we walk by faith not by sight not your sight not your time but it's gastón time so you keep praying keep pouring the sunlight keep shining that touch slide the flashlight on them and as you start a flashlight the life in them everywhere that you breathe every spring every day that you praise everyone that you speak is bring is bringing a quickening power it's an internal way that you don't see with your eyes because the kingdom of God comes not with observation but it's within you amen praise be to God glory hallelujah the Lord is his wonderful amen so this is where the Lord has brought you an eye this is what the Lord is doing in your life he's got his spirit in you before the foundation of the world and he ordained you on two good ways amen Jesus came here to suffer why didn't Jesus just speak a word and the whole the whole earth who received you could have done that there was no need for him to go to Calvary he had the power to be able to just speak just like his book and he created everybody to dwell in it I visited Abraham could have done the same thing and every man will be born again but I wanted to become part of it he wanted to see the suffering because he wanted to see of filling the Bible salad is a high priests are the Hebrews who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he wanted to be human as well he was each and I was feel funny but he became a human form so that he can feel infinity when he cry he can see what he s he comforted here's the agony you go through the pain and the suffering so that it can work from that end because you want to see your feeling just like a doctor if a doctor doesn't feel for you can just if he feels for you you'll be movin on yet to wake them basically to to help your life but anyway just want to okay this or aspirin god of my office what's wrong with you I have a headache okay this aspirin for you we'll get it from the dispensary it doesn't have any feeling for you but when it takes it thermometer take your temperature oh you've got a fever okay let's see what's going on here try this one try this one take all the vital signs it is this has a feeling for you he want you to leave you want to help you to stop you want to stop your suffering and that is what Jesus Christ did for us you wanted swap-out suffering so you came to die for us become a human being had blood like you and I but his blood was what it wasn't by born by six his blood was the speaking word of God so that you become the spoken word of the Lord amen so if you were looking for Jesus who are they go to find Jesus I didn't find me the skies know Jesus is in you amen if I have been born again you are the Jesus of the hour remember in the Bible when Paul saw was persecuting the Christians and he appeared to him on the road to Emmaus it's a saw so why do you persecute me route to Jerusalem is a lord who are now said I'm Jesus whom you persecute so with Jesus the Christians that Saul of Tarsus was persecuting he was in them and he appeared in a sky in the plot of fire to speak to Saul amen there's something in you there's somebody new now when this earthly bodies dissolve he takes over now he's using his flesh to accomplish his purpose amen but when is finishing using this flesh he takes over and then on the other side of eternity it's right here is not in the skies his only memory is not in Jupiter it's right here on this earth heaven is right here but it's a much accelerated dimension so fast pace that this ice cannot detect is beyond this ice amen it is the love of Christ to go there what is the love of God is that feel funny one time a prophet of God went to Eternity be seen by Brahm he sent countless visions there was a time when brother said he said we went to visit by the Brougham with his wife and they said oh he's asleep not on his bed he was sitting down sleeping I mean today our mind and then it just jumps oh god bless you brother it wasn't sleeping what's on the other side so his body was just sitting down like somebody who's wrestling sleeping but he's the real him is in the other dimension doing something with the Lord and when he came back to his body he saw that brother in his wife oh god bless you brother welcome he didn't know they were sitting there for long because was somewhere else the same thing there's something in you a son of God a daughter of God before you became flesh before you hit your feci on this earth where before you hit your daddy's loins where before you hit your mom's a humble you were somewhere you in the womb of a low amen Canelo him loose you Canelo him about you so what is our fear Conover doesn't shake us Amen because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world the Lord is Christ in you he put ordained you here for good ways and this person it cannot be missing you and then what you yield yourself the Morton have been tipped preeminence the more you tighten down in pray the more that we begin to our manifest the more you see him all around you the more he shows you the supernatural but because we get so fast peace in our mind the way the work is this world is set up job scoo this this so you wake up you don't have time to pray we do the lazy man's pray O Lord thank you for this morning before you even say thank you you're ready in your car to to trouble you waken when you come back although thank you for the day before you say thank you you already sleeping and so when is the Holy Ghost going to manifest in you he doesn't have our attention but if you come free ourself the Lord take me over take on through thick preeminence of my life do with me the supernatural you want to do in my life you see that you are not just an ordinary being Amen is not going to come from heaven it's not going to come from the skies it's in you that you know of God is within you it's not on the outside amen you might be a little group it might not be the biggest person in West Palm Beach nobody might know you in West Palm Beach beside your brothers and sisters you are not popular you don't have following you are not a basketball star you are not a politician if a position is going to have a lot of following but you are not ordained for that purpose you are ordained for greater than Solomon is here amen you are greater than even Elizabeth and Esther amen you are under a much higher covenant than even the Old Testament in the New Testament because they are which known you once returned Hebrews I think 13 12 someway said there's a cloud of witness the cloud of witness I can a claw be a witness does a cloud does it have a nice it's not a cloud is a symbolic weight somewhat symbolic word it's too funny all this sin that I've gone before the gospel that the Lord has given to you it's a much higher gospel than what to give it to them so our gospel that we preach here is bringing them to that level amen just like the Old Testament Saints the Lord used a mighty great prophet of God but then without the blood of Jesus credited in experience the death of Jesus Christ they didn't experience Kaveri they had the same few funny the same Holy Ghost in their form but they didn't experience the death of Jesus Christ so they were not born again like you and I were born again so David a prophet King and priest can go take shower or look at somebody's wife taking shower and go to commit adultery with with with with her and marry Hey because why he wasn't born again are you a born again but when you are born again posted that their life that I live is no longer mine his friend couldn't live the life when he was so he was killing Christians but when Jesus cried took over he wasn't Saul of Tarsus no more he became a simple pole and they're full of the fire of God amen sins of the world was not part of his mind things of Christ was always mine there was a woman who was a prostitute Mary Magdalene he had seven demons also Jesus cast him in the most out of Fame when she was transformed when that demons of fornication adultery and avoid disrespect alway cast from her and then the Holy Goose Jesus Christ live in heaven he he resurrected she was a first person Jesus Christ reveal himself to you because before the foundation of the world she wasn't a prostitute she was a daughter of God she went through that line just to have an SP I have a contrast amen and a lot brought it to the other side the negatively body to the positive to manifest amen the bubbles are no adultery no fornicator no Lyle good economic good enter the kingdom of God yes desperate cannot enter but the person that the devil use w's wasn't desperate of adultery amen Mary Magdalene was a child of God a daughter of God so this as Christ came to cleanse say to transform it to redeem redeem means to bring back to where she was because she had at you funny before the foundation of the world and so God forgive and transform your life and MIT is sent out of it amen but then God after the death he give us a higher covenant he started a church two thousand years seven Church ages run through seven Church ages and then brought you an eye after the seven Church ages Amen we didn't live to see the Prophet the Prophet was the one about the children said that God send the messengers and the end of the age to close the age but we came at a node at the end of the age we were the sons and daughters of God we were born but from the mouth of Elohim amen we are the wife of Jesus Christ himself we are beyond the church edges or the teachers are bleep they have already been accomplished we are in the 80 crisis in us amen and a gospel that we are receive that's the gospel that is bringing eternity into manifestation and when the more God we get to know who we are our responsibilities on earth and the more we lead our soft winds like I said you are not gonna be popular in West Palm Beach you are not going to be afraid of Trump if Trump comes to a moral equation I will call you to go n to grand party or something like that no that is not your calling but when Jesus Christ drops in West Palm Beach you visit you sister Colleen amen UV sister Ruth if this is you my sister's to visit you all because you are ordained for eternal purpose and all we need to do is your ourself give us up to that column it goes with a lot of sacrifice a lot of suffering but their joy in being redeemed look at people the whole world people don't know where to go but you don't have any fear if they take your job God will feed you some people have lost your difficult job as but but a jack was saying if the Lord has to rain delays in your room you do that there's nothing too difficult for the Lord there's nothing that is impossible to the Lord he can do that for you amen it was a time a man that I met not too long gave me thousand dollars I wasn't broke I had money he said a lot put up on my hat then you give you another thousand dollars what's going on here so don't worry I'm a blessed person the lot put up all my had to give it to you he gave me $2,000 when I was in Brooke so if a Brooke I don't have a job and absolutely my room can go send me what if I put it up on somebody's had that I didn't know to give me $2,000 who gives $2,000 as a gift to people he wasn't my relativity I wasn't his his brother if you I need can't a lot provide for you if they call our job you take whatever they take everything our changes they take everything and you're gonna see the more of him amen because he that is in you is better than the world it's any team so VCU Amen in your heart is bubbling the fountain of living waters and the more you love the Lord the more you love is weight the more he gives you more amen the money money feeds this revelation to you the more you begin to know that you a daughter of God when you speak things has to happen because you are not just an odd 19 yes you are flesh and you've got a flesh and blood but can step out the flesh and speak as an authority of Jesus Christ amen blessed be the Lord glory hallelujah I mean a lot has blessed you and I we blessed before we were born on this earth he gave you things that we didn't deserve as we read in Ephesians 3:14 17 verse is that of the whole family in heaven and earth is named Jesus Christ that's Bible but a just children his life is in them amen they have different attributes of they are female they're all sisters policies God's got a grandson he's also part of him that is another attribute so their heavenly heavenly family the few funnies the angels the another glory they are sons of God dear part of God but they are not part of godless if you take the Angels they are part of God back creation the same life in you is in them that's why they sing holy holy holy unto the Lord he who was and is and is to come holy holy holy unto the Lord that's all they do and when the Lord sent him to you they'll come to you God can send an angel to you doesn't matter what is just our brother goes on an angel to the mother of a Samson she wasn't a pasta she wasn't a high priest but God had filled before he got the Lord fevered head and a lot sent an angel to her amen and the Lord can do whatever I want to do for you he said the whole family is named then it said that he will grant you according to the riches of his glory it is a riches of American dollars it is the riches of dead presidents by riches of glory you give you how much you need for the dead president if you need to give you ten million dollars he'll give it to you amen God is not a poor God amen a father Abraham was rich Joe was rich there were women who were rich in a time of poor they supported the Minister Paul so God is it doesn't God is not angry or God doesn't get weak if I he blesses his children sons and daughters with money do you give it to you but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness loser will be addition since that you don't even qualify for it go to open the fever for you Amen God can put you where you don't qualify what qualifies and qualifies him to do so I don't ask who said that we want you I'm not I'm not I said we want you you know what you've seen you come and do this job we're gonna train you you might know if you've comfortable said now I'm not good with computers I don't worry when I train don't worry because if see something in you it's not them it's the Holy Ghost that is putting you before that fever you can do all things for you and all that we need to do is surrender all our hats and pray for your prayer journals this is a time life comes in the quietness that's when God conceives lives in the dead of that night that's when life is conceived when Karuna has saw the whole world that's when the Lord is doing things for your fragile house with people that you love you want to prefer write their names and keep trained because the Lord is doing something when life comes back when the Sun comes back you're gonna see that the Lord has done so much for you so you are not an ordinary being you are a son of God you a daughter of God before the foundation of the world you a part of him and the Lord has you here for a purpose since faith hope and charity the greatest is what charity what is charity laughs no laughs charge won't talk about charity people I've done I've got so much I want to give back to my community that is not charity that is a charity everybody said oh I become a basketball staff got some money I want to go back to Chicago and give to my community dancer that's goki I mean me I want to give back to our community let's say but I get so much money you want to donate something to West Bambi that is good but the charity is not I tried to be talking about the charity is still funny it's the love of God and the love that God give it to you is not the earthly materials he'll give you what you need for the earthly materials but the love is himself is that the whole family in heaven in Earth and earth is named after all make it Jesus Christ he's put his life in you and that is more than the good of this world amen the life of Christ in you the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire I knew my sister you don't even know how much God has given to you you don't know how much you you don't see it we just have a speck a speck of it they profess that I want to go to the other side we still gonna learn more when we leave this earth and even a time of you dying let's see if today's when I'm going to die that is nothing I don't preach up an adoption the Hebrew series or adoption it's not just like it's just like within a microsecond you will see like an ocean and it will change and before you realize you are the other side your body might be dead probably crying by you yourself you be standing there with Jesus Christ with beautiful bass with green grass I've not seen green grass before oh sorry - grass is before but our prophet went to the other side and it was walking on blue glasses is it what you want to spend your life why do you cry why do we I mean a mama when we have to serve the Lord here when you go through a little persecution and trials when you are working on blue grasses for eternity eternity has no beginning has no end and here on earth because you are his son and daughter beautify and verify you amen you never like you good like a know you know make you rich like Bill Gates if you need to be Bill Gates it can put it can make it happen if you out then you to be that one to maybe do other stuff I mean help the whole world you can make it happen but for whatever you need it's new already and when you speak believe it it will come to pass don't look at what you see what you see will limit your mind for you to UM be to disbelieve the Lord but if that you do even see the Lord has ordained you to use your faith that's why allow challenges in your life big hardships in your life so that the attribute will become manifested who had challenges that Jesus Christ he had prescriptions all around him the our limitation reporte he came to receive they spat upon him they call invisible but it didn't admit attribute to shine there's something even Jesus in his human form he cries a lot he cried to the holy go see him if the over lettuce cup pass over me because I the human from your crying on a human form we are limited but he that was in him came out and strengthened him send a few funnies Moses was there was supposed to be dead Elijah was there he was was with dead he was ready for resurrection no Direction is in you amen the recession is you when you have the Holy Ghost you are resurrected already everything that God is going to do is coming from you amen your resurrections not going to come from Jesus will come hang in as can you see Jesus and jump you come from you that's a foolish virgins a revelation remember when Jesus was before he died he told the people of Israel that Titus was going to persecute them so today Christian when they see those signs they should leave back hit Jerusalem but on the foolish virgins when they saw Jerusalem being surrounded the truth their candles and the high priests and the alarms and they went to the temple to pray and shout and speak in different things but then those who were wise the wise virgin who had oil India India condor say hey by Jack remember the Lord is this you have a quick remember this hmm take your family let's leave Jerusalem they left and the general titles was Coe back to room to go and get more ammunition he came back and no entered with more demons and then they winter did Sunnah the city for a forgotten how many for some time so there was no food coming into the city nothing is going out or for ran out he memories begin to eat the our children and they blood they had to the kill people to that they are blood they had to use no matter what the Bible said I'd hold no shoes it's like shoes that they put nails on me to be able to walk because it was slippery friction blood was like a river in the city so they have to put metals on the a shoe to be able to kill those who are not dead yet because they didn't what believe the Word of God they didn't receive whom they lost send it to them and they perish but the Lord has blessed you that you can receive that the Lord has sent to you so that you don't perish with the world amen so the fullest

quote that he just kind of share it there to begin I don't think I've ever heard that message but never pulled that out of you know everything no matter how good we got it on this side it's still a negative it's still a negative and and and and when you look at a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere else and and and our life that we live in here we're pressing into that positive right and I can't wait to get to the other side and and you know a day that they'll come we don't have to worry about washing our hands everywhere we go and you know and being concerned but no masks and all that we gotta worry about that where we getting ready to go to write that won't be an issue so all seem to be going amen all sickness or disease and man no more hospital visits all of that it'll be over with no more funerals to go to so we've just we just think the Lord they man for for what we're looking for and looking I mean looking forward to we thank God for it we want to just offer word of Prayer some of you all are aware of sister Ellie she's coming to visit us multiple times from brother Anderson's Church a father past early this week and we just want to remember that family in prayer and believe he was a minister a pastor and and they are in the Michigan area and just just want to remember them in prayer that God would just be with them throughout this time a man so let's just let's prepare to dismiss now say a closing prayer and we'll also remember these requests some other things that you pray for sister brother Nathan's mom she came out of the hospital by the grace of God and she's back home but we want to continue to keep her in prayer to doctors diagnosed her with actually stage 4 cancer and so we want to pray that God would just make a man touch her in her body and give her a miracle we've seen God do it before and we believe God can do it again cancer is not too hard for God brother Tim Pruett he's a pastor there in Louisiana just he sent out a requests his wife had to go to the hospital had some bleeding on the brain and and I guess she experienced this a number of years ago and and they said it was pretty strange because it came back in the same spot that uh that it wasn't say that typically never happens so they know us a devil and brother brother uh Quaker tolas hear science can look at cancer and see two eyes and brother and toes it's just another life that's actually coming attack and take your life from you but we bind it a man at the root a man glory to God just like Jesus bound that you know the fig tree we bind cancer fig tree
