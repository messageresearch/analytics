[55:46] know I believe it was my wife that kind
[55:48] of gave me the idea may be doing the
[55:50] factor still outreach and then if I'm
[55:52] just kind of talking about Troy he gave
[55:53] me the idea you know let's also connect
[55:57] with that prayer for the kids as they
[56:00] going back into school you know and
[56:02] people need prayer our schools are
[56:05] dangerous right and so you know just be
[56:08] able to connect that and try to reach

[56:12] gonna go out next week or do that so 10
[56:14] o'clock in the morning we'll do the
[56:15] outreach and then 6 o'clock in the
[56:17] evening we will be doing a man
[56:20] the service where the Remi will be
[56:22] preaching there we're looking forward to
[56:24] having a wonderful time they met in love
[56:26] or so just keep that in mind and keep it
[56:29] in prayer and then we trust it you'll be
[56:31] able to make over to the service I know
[56:33] to be a real blessing the brothers
[56:35] smiling just to see they meant our faces
[56:37] same and I know it'll be a blessing to
[56:39] him so I'll keep that in mind I wanted
[56:43] to also just take a moment here a man
[56:46] this is first Sunday so I always tried
[56:49] to give you all an update a man of our
[56:52] Building Fund and and I'll do that at
[56:56] this time thank you I'm using same and
[56:57] I'll let y'all be seated
[56:59] appreciate y'all certainly certainly
[57:01] appreciate y'all a man glory to God just
[57:07] this grateful for all that the Lord
[57:10] a man is doing in our myths and and in
[57:15] church I wanna I just I want to say
[57:17] thank you for everybody that is getting
[57:21] behind Amen the building fund to you
[57:24] know to just help us get to where we
[57:26] want to go as a church and and all I can
[57:30] access that we just do the best that we
[57:32] can right just do the best that we can
[57:35] we look and you know this is this is a
[57:37] recently we're at brother West Coast
[57:39] services and brother Daryl made a
[57:42] comment a man in that service and he was
[57:45] talking about Gideon's army and and and
[57:48] what happened with Gideon's army God had
[57:50] to actually stripped the army of their
[57:53] size they were about 30,000 men and even
[57:58] with 30,000 they were getting ready to
[57:59] go up against like hundreds of thousands
[58:02] and even with 30,000 they wouldn't have
[58:04] been big enough to defeat the other army
[58:07] and you know so God say but but just so
[58:11] that y'all don't think that y'all DD I'm
[58:15] actually strip the army down and and I
[58:18] think he got it from 30,000 to about
[58:20] 3,000 or something like that and and
[58:24] then they say not getting and I got one
[58:25] mold test thing they say I want you to
[58:28] have them go to the water
[58:31] and the ones that that kind of do it a
[58:34] certain way right the ones that get
[58:37] water a certain way I want you to put
[58:40] them to one side and then the the others
[58:42] that get it in another way the ones
[58:44] everything lay down on their face and
[58:46] drink the water you say that they
[58:48] prostrating before an idol God you say
[58:50] so put them to the side and then the
[58:52] ones that kind of they cut it you know
[58:56] like this you know they pick it up like
[58:58] that they just kind of get down on me
[59:00] and I don't need knees but just you know
[59:02] kind of like this and the reason they do
[59:07] it like that because they got their eye
[59:09] on the devil put them to the other side
[59:20] right and when you put them put them the
[59:23] ones that that was doing it like that
[59:25] you know like
[59:33] 300 of them he said that's the army that
[59:37] I won't pass them the ones that I want
[59:40] and and and God took the 30,000 member
[59:45] army down to 300 and and so when they
[59:49] went to battle they would have to know
[59:51] that they were not strong enough to
[59:54] defeat hundreds of thousands they would
[59:56] have to know that God did it they had to
[59:59] give glory to God so we're not when I
[1:00:01] apply that to our pledge and we gonna do
[1:00:03] what we can do it but but but you know
[1:00:06] when we kind of done all that we can we
[1:00:10] know who can do right but but we gotta
[1:00:14] at least do what we can and notice not
[1:00:18] in Gideon's battle they did have to show
[1:00:20] up right they at least had to be there
[1:00:23] right so there are things that we have
[1:00:26] to do we have to show up right but but
[1:00:29] you know we've set budgets we set all
[1:00:32] these things but we got a god that blows
[1:00:34] budgets a man and and our faith is gonna
[1:00:37] be on the line the greater than this so
[1:00:39] don't so I'm not I'm I mean I with
[1:00:42] all this to me is good news right oh
[1:00:44] this is good news but up but and on the
[1:00:47] other side of that I'm still expecting
[1:00:48] God to do some great things
[1:00:50] amen and I miss praise God but uh but I
[1:00:53] just you know and and I do want to thank
[1:00:55] everyone I have to say this because last
[1:00:59] month was our largest month and giving
[1:01:03] towards the building fund since we do
[1:01:07] [Applause]
[1:01:10] and that was a real blessing
[1:01:14] just last month along there was eight
[1:01:16] thousand five hundred and forty dollars
[1:01:18] given to us for building a man a man I'm
[1:01:26] grateful that that's that's a positive
[1:01:29] amen if y'all wanna beat last month be
[1:01:33] Mike but you know but we you know we
[1:01:39] don't do this with that cook you know
[1:01:40] Dennis washing the car right there's
[1:01:45] gonna be a god thing we just did what we
[1:01:47] could right but God did the rest
[1:01:50] amen but but uh you know we set a goal
[1:01:54] just based on our Amen voting and things
[1:01:57] that nature our goal was to raise a
[1:01:59] hundred and five thousand Amen this year
[1:02:02] and you know the the pledge is do I have
[1:02:08] that right
[1:02:09] yeah so and the pledges that were given
[1:02:13] we had little forms that people pledged
[1:02:14] on the sign on say that this is what
[1:02:16] I'll give the pledge forms came back at
[1:02:18] fifty thousand three hundred twenty five
[1:02:20] the goal was 105 but we got pledged half
[1:02:24] of that was pledged and and and so far
[1:02:27] to date we have received twenty three
[1:02:29] thousand six hundred and fifty six
[1:02:31] dollars a man enforced sin of what was
[1:02:35] pledge Amen so let's give God praise for
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:41] and we are here at August 1st I mean the
[1:02:46] first of all because I should say August
[1:02:48] 5th is a date but uh we're here the
[1:02:50] first at August and I mentioned to y'all
[1:02:52] early in a year we have one transfer a
[1:02:54] four hundred dollars that went from our
[1:02:57] building fund to our normal offering as
[1:03:03] an offering is what's used to handle all
[1:03:06] the expenses here in the church and one
[1:03:08] month we fell short so we had to
[1:03:10] transfer money from the building fund to
[1:03:12] that and that's something that is not
[1:03:14] good if we're trying to save the money
[1:03:17] for a greater project we can't be using
[1:03:19] the money while we're trying to save
[1:03:21] right so so that was just not good and
[1:03:23] and I have to thank the church once
[1:03:27] again because we have not had to do that
[1:03:31] again this year and even in the summer
[1:03:34] months when things get slower the church
[1:03:37] is still responding in a given and what
[1:03:39] we ask is that at 37 people would
[1:03:42] undertake $100 a month and giving
[1:03:46] towards the offering that's not tithing
[1:03:48] that's your offering offering the Bible
[1:03:50] says we give tithe again offering and
[1:03:52] tithing you get 10% of your income to
[1:03:55] the Lord and God said you can keep 90
[1:03:58] percent and what a deal right give tips
[1:04:01] if the government take more in God all
[1:04:04] right but but 10% is what God actually
[1:04:07] for your time and then he says we give
[1:04:09] our tithes and offerings so offering is
[1:04:11] whatever a man you want to do from your
[1:04:13] heart there is no limit on that if you
[1:04:15] want to give the other night of a sip a
[1:04:17] man to God and offering he would have no
[1:04:20] problem he wouldn't know your your bills
[1:04:23] might have a problem we have but uh but
[1:04:27] uh but I tell you we just we just asked
[1:04:29] this sometimes people well how much do I
[1:04:32] give you know $1 $2 $3 whatever you want
[1:04:35] to give is from the from your heart
[1:04:37] that's what your give an offer but based
[1:04:39] on the expenses of the church you know
[1:04:42] just what we pay in rent this this this
[1:04:43] space cost us thirty seven hundred
[1:04:45] dollars a month
[1:04:47] so if 37 people gave $100 guess what
[1:04:50] it's paid for every month praise the
[1:04:52] Lord it's just that simple
[1:04:54] rather than having you know one person
[1:04:56] trying to do it all why don't we all try
[1:04:57] to pitch in a man so if you can give
[1:04:59] $100 towards offering that with that
[1:05:02] would be very very helpful so our net a
[1:05:05] man since we had that one transfer and
[1:05:08] even though we received twenty three
[1:05:10] thousand six hundred and fifty six
[1:05:12] dollars we have to take the four hundred
[1:05:13] dollars away because we used it so our
[1:05:16] net is twenty three thousand two hundred
[1:05:17] and fifty six dollars and four cent and
[1:05:19] and we've been we started giving in
[1:05:23] February so February March April May
[1:05:28] June July not even a year and we almost
[1:05:32] halfway there a mess so I want to say
[1:05:35] praise the Lord for that praise the Lord
[1:05:37] I was halfway there for the pledges for
[1:05:40] the pledges for the pledges so a man
[1:05:43] we're gonna do what we can and we'll let
[1:05:44] God do the rest so thank you all so much
[1:05:47] a man I'm so grateful a man for that so
[1:05:51] my God my God a man I think there was
[1:05:58] something else that I was supposed
[1:05:59] announce and when you don't write things
[1:06:02] down they have to come back later a man
[1:06:08] but but God is good oh oh yeah two other

[1:07:31] amen so I want to read a couple
[1:07:33] scriptures I got a subject here a man
[1:07:36] that I feel I feel like I can't
[1:07:40] necessarily get it all out in one day
[1:07:42] but a man we're gonna do the very best
[1:07:44] we could and the way I'm built is like I
[1:07:47] like to try to build up to where we're
[1:07:51] going but today I might just drop a bomb
[1:07:55] and then we'll clean it up later if
[1:08:03] that'd be okay right just just just drop
[1:08:06] the bomb mess up everything and then
[1:08:11] they would go back and clean it up all
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:17] yeah I just I just I just love the Lord
[1:08:20] you know while we were there one of the
[1:08:23] brothers picked up we are at a ministers
[1:08:25] meeting on yesterday his brother picked
[1:08:26] up the scriptures they turn your Bible
[1:08:28] here and when it turned his Bible there
[1:08:30] I didn't catch it at first he start
[1:08:32] reading like oh that was a scripture and
[1:08:34] I want to refer to old Sunday so I'm
[1:08:36] like that's that's got to be a
[1:08:37] confirmation but I've tried to work work
[1:08:40] my way up to it but I'm like no I just
[1:08:42] drop the bomb and then I click there
[1:08:44] come back clean it all up a man but I
[1:08:47] just love the Lord so you all stand with
[1:08:49] me we're gonna read and we're I'm still
[1:08:53] kind of in this channel of talking about
[1:08:56] adoption
[1:08:57] a man so just bear with me here I've
[1:09:00] just been noticing that there's a lot of
[1:09:03] preachers out there that are preaching
[1:09:04] on this subject now brother Remy when he
[1:09:08] had his meetings the bet back in June
[1:09:10] before we went to Israel he wanted the
[1:09:14] subject of adoption preached in his
[1:09:15] church and then brother Wescoe when he
[1:09:18] had the theme manifestation of the sons
[1:09:20] of God that's also adoption and and I
[1:09:24] know that you know some other preachers
[1:09:25] that I know they're kind of talking on
[1:09:26] these on these lines so I said you know
[1:09:28] Lord maybe you're trying to say
[1:09:30] something to us and I want to just kind
[1:09:32] of get in that vein and and I've trusted
[1:09:34] you all I bear with me but the the one
[1:09:37] thing that I remember the Prophet
[1:09:38] telling us is that the reason a man that
[1:09:42] this you know this ain't really just
[1:09:45] kept I mean we really settled in this
[1:09:47] it's because we don't feed on it enough
[1:09:49] right so so we need that we need to feed
[1:09:51] on it we need to feed on it so y'all
[1:09:54] just bear with me as we as we go along I
[1:09:56] want to want to read from Romans 8 amen
[1:10:00] 14 through 19 and also Galatians 4 and
[1:10:04] then I have some other scriptures that
[1:10:06] I'd like to try to get to in the sermon
[1:10:08] if I can but we will we'll let the Lord
[1:10:12] have his wing a man Romans chapter 8 and
[1:10:15] this this this subject I know is not for
[1:10:18] babes in Christ it's not it's really for
[1:10:22] those that that are established in
[1:10:24] Christ and however a man we are
[1:10:30] believing that you will be established a
[1:10:32] man in Christ and you know we'll just do
[1:10:35] all we can to help you get there Romans
[1:10:37] 8 and I'm starting here at verse 14 it
[1:10:40] says for as many as are led by the
[1:10:43] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:10:47] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:10:50] bondage again to fear and and and the
[1:10:56] emphatic
[1:10:57] it says a slavish spirit you have not
[1:11:03] received a slavish spirit that mean
[1:11:08] you're not supposed to be a slave to sin
[1:11:10] you're supposed to have dominion over
[1:11:12] sin right this is this is what God wants
[1:11:16] to do we got to get rid of our excuses
[1:11:18] right it's no longer God understands God
[1:11:22] understands that you supposed to be
[1:11:23] above that right you have not received
[1:11:26] that didn't come from God you don't you
[1:11:28] don't have a slavish spirit to see him
[1:11:30] right so here so you have not received
[1:11:32] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:11:35] you have received the spirit of adoption
[1:11:36] or also it says in lymphatic GOG like
[1:11:40] the spirit of sonship right the spirit
[1:11:42] of sonship whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:11:46] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:11:48] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:11:50] God and if children then heirs than
[1:11:55] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[1:11:59] Christ okay if so be that we suffer with
[1:12:03] him that we may be also glorified
[1:12:05] together a man for I reckon that the
[1:12:10] sufferings so so this this adoption
[1:12:12] certainly a part a part of his Gumby
[1:12:15] character-building right and so so what
[1:12:19] happens in your suffering is that your
[1:12:21] character is being formed so don't run
[1:12:23] from your your suffering don't run from
[1:12:25] the trials you have to welcome that Amen
[1:12:28] because that's what's forming and
[1:12:29] shaping your character hallelujah a man
[1:12:33] a man a man now you know as a pastor I
[1:12:37] know that I got things that people are
[1:12:40] struggling with a man here that you
[1:12:43] probably should be struggling with you
[1:12:45] you should be so much further up the
[1:12:47] road that you that shouldn't be a
[1:12:48] problem
[1:12:49] amen it shouldn't be a problem as a
[1:12:53] pastor a man people that go to this
[1:12:56] church people that are members if I can
[1:13:01] put it that way members my expectation
[1:13:05] for the sisters that they not wearing
[1:13:07] pants
[1:13:09] your member spirit of true tabernacle
[1:13:12] and pants you mean I ain't them I ain't
[1:13:15] preached nuttin all these years right
[1:13:18] see so I mean you know the expectation
[1:13:20] and see I wouldn't have to preach that
[1:13:22] if we want to live in that right right I
[1:13:27] mean the church should be so much
[1:13:28] further the room right there are certain
[1:13:31] areas that you know I shouldn't even
[1:13:33] have to go into because I know that you
[1:13:34] two already overcome that a man Church
[1:13:37] right so the sufferings I recommend the
[1:13:41] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:13:42] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:13:44] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:13:46] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:13:48] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:13:51] sons of God all right turn with me to
[1:13:54] galatians 4 a man i want to read from
[1:13:57] there as well on today and will say
[1:14:01] we're to pray and i'll let you be seated
[1:14:02] lord help us God a man a man yes there
[1:14:10] this is this type of these types of
[1:14:12] sermons are for those that established
[1:14:14] in the faith and you know and and and
[1:14:17] I'm gonna preach us up there right to
[1:14:20] get us established in the faith but I
[1:14:22] know I know that we go through things I
[1:14:24] know that and that we read the something
[1:14:25] and Sunday school this morning now you
[1:14:29] know we sometimes dark have just
[1:14:31] attacked certain things right he cool it
[1:14:33] but some time he does wait he just sit
[1:14:36] back he wait and he just don't go after
[1:14:38] it right away he know it's there but it
[1:14:40] don't attack it brother branham told us
[1:14:42] that if we if we learn the fly those
[1:14:43] principles it would it would make our
[1:14:46] home life better and our church life
[1:14:49] better so sometimes we can attack but
[1:14:51] sometimes you got a week
[1:14:53] Amen just wait and and so you finally
[1:14:56] sometimes just waiting in a sermon like
[1:14:58] this I'm just waiting heavily no don't
[1:15:01] get me wrong now
[1:15:01] amen don't get me wrong amen but but I'm
[1:15:06] trying to bring the church to this level
[1:15:08] if I can get you there and you're
[1:15:09] thinking then all that other stuff a
[1:15:11] fall off
[1:15:12] amen amen I'm a yo-yo
[1:15:19] you know sisters brother branham had a
[1:15:25] vision and there was a lady that come to
[1:15:28] him with high-heeled shoes on and she
[1:15:31] was walking and he told her later his
[1:15:33] sister you not gonna make it to heaven
[1:15:35] like that he told her say you're not
[1:15:37] gonna make it to heaven and she just
[1:15:38] kept walking he said you're not gonna
[1:15:41] make it like that sis you're not gonna
[1:15:43] make it and she got so far down the road
[1:15:45] till she felt off right she fell off she
[1:15:49] didn't go up she fell off and so you
[1:15:52] know even in that y'all my wife I know
[1:15:55] my sister my wife has done teaching she
[1:15:57] might have to do it again on modesty but
[1:16:00] sisters we got the street those things
[1:16:02] up a man you know you know what's too
[1:16:06] high you're walking funny a man and the
[1:16:09] Bible say that they would do that now
[1:16:10] you know you can feel the word one way
[1:16:12] or the other but but you know I don't
[1:16:14] don't don't don't get me wrong I see all
[1:16:16] kind of stuff sometime I don't say
[1:16:17] nothing but don't think I don't see a
[1:16:19] man I be
[1:16:21] I'm trying to follow a certain vein and
[1:16:23] then I get pulled back down from another
[1:16:25] dimension
[1:16:26] alright Galatians 4 I'm done Simon I'm
[1:16:35] gonna keep elevating but imma just drop
[1:16:37] a little things off don't think I don't
[1:16:38] see it a man I see it unless I see
[1:16:42] makeup I see fingernail polish til I see
[1:16:45] all that praise God don't think I'm an
[1:16:49] agreement with that no I'm not no I'm
[1:16:52] not a man y'all know what holiness is if
[1:16:56] I have to see they used to preach it so
[1:16:59] hard we knew a holiness was a man but we
[1:17:03] we got we overcame some things right we
[1:17:06] overcame some things but y'all just bear
[1:17:09] with me
[1:17:09] y'all bear with me all right now I say
[1:17:12] that the air as long as he is a child
[1:17:15] differeth nothing from a servant though
[1:17:18] he be Lord of all but is under tutors
[1:17:21] and governors until the time appointed
[1:17:22] of the Father even so we when we were
[1:17:26] children were in bondage under the
[1:17:28] of the world when we were children where
[1:17:35] we were under bondage under the elements
[1:17:38] of the world but see when we mature
[1:17:42] we're no longer under bondage to the
[1:17:47] elements of the world right this is this
[1:17:53] is this is maturity but this is why this
[1:17:57] is two people that's already overcome
[1:17:59] right if you want to keep struggling
[1:18:02] that's that's to you all right
[1:18:04] hey man but but but but but but we don't
[1:18:07] have to struggle anymore we don't have
[1:18:08] to be bound anymore amen be satisfied
[1:18:11] who God made you a man so he says but
[1:18:14] when the fullness of the time was come
[1:18:16] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:18:19] made under the law to redeem them that
[1:18:21] were under the law that we might receive
[1:18:23] the adoption of sons and because ye are
[1:18:29] sons that's a critical statement there's
[1:18:31] a quote that I've been trying to get to
[1:18:33] the read and I won't get to it today
[1:18:35] I'll get to it eventually because you
[1:18:37] are sons God has sent forth the spirit
[1:18:40] of his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:18:41] Father now that's that's critical
[1:18:43] because the because you are sons we can
[1:18:47] have these conversations hallelujah
[1:18:50] right some churches you can't go and
[1:18:52] preach this subject but because you are
[1:18:54] sons and daughters of God we can talk
[1:18:56] about adoption Amen hallelujah wherefore
[1:19:01] thou art no more a servant but a son and
[1:19:05] if a son then an heir of God through
[1:19:07] Christ let's pray father we thank you
[1:19:09] for the reading of the word we pray that
[1:19:11] the Holy Spirit would now take these
[1:19:13] things that we've read and bring clarity
[1:19:16] and understanding to us God touches that
[1:19:19] we might receive a from heaven today and
[1:19:22] Lord elevate us elevators and I thinking
[1:19:24] elevators and our living elevators God
[1:19:27] and our approach to you father we pray
[1:19:30] that you would do that today we take
[1:19:31] control under the control of the Holy
[1:19:34] Spirit every spirit that's against the
[1:19:35] Spirit of God we take it underneath the
[1:19:37] control all the spirit even right now in
[1:19:39] Jesus name we pray a
[1:19:41] man amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] I was struggling with my title here
[1:19:48] because I can say I try to deal things
[1:19:51] up to a certain point but amen we're not
[1:19:54] going to build up we're just gonna drop
[1:19:56] the bomb amen our title today is
[1:19:58] co-equal with Jesus a man co-equal with
[1:20:03] Jesus let's just kind of start here in
[1:20:07] this sermon what was the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] given for a man what was the Holy Ghost
[1:20:13] given for now you know we're not when I
[1:20:16] use that title and I'll have a quote
[1:20:19] that kind of support where it where I'm
[1:20:21] coming from but we just read some
[1:20:22] scriptures one of the things a man you
[1:20:26] know that the Prophet just kind of
[1:20:27] shared and and and I'm not going to read
[1:20:30] all of it right now I'm just gonna set
[1:20:32] you up with this a man but he made up he
[1:20:36] made a statement he says it says they
[1:20:46] said the Pentecost has received the
[1:20:48] bachelors old egos and that makes them
[1:20:50] apart fellowship and relationship with
[1:20:52] God that's born again he says and a son
[1:20:55] and daughter of God tailed them out of
[1:20:59] the Bible and they'll believe it all
[1:21:02] right tell them out of the Bible and
[1:21:04] they'll believe it right so so when I
[1:21:07] talk about being co-equal with God
[1:21:10] once I tell you out of the Bible then
[1:21:13] you have to believe it if you're a son
[1:21:15] or daughter of God you got to come to
[1:21:17] this especially once it's shown to you
[1:21:20] your identification is found in the Word
[1:21:23] of God right so so once it's shown to
[1:21:25] you in the word what God has called you
[1:21:27] to then you have to believe it and not
[1:21:29] only do you have to believe it I believe
[1:21:30] you have to start expressing it Amen I I
[1:21:33] just I just believe that I was listening
[1:21:36] to her brother speak I believe it might
[1:21:38] have been this weekend he talked about
[1:21:39] how first it started out as a thought in
[1:21:42] God's mind amen and then that thought a
[1:21:45] man came down to become a word out of
[1:21:47] his mouth right but that but not only
[1:21:50] did it stop there amen it kept unfolding
[1:21:53] so we had a
[1:21:54] that became a word that became written
[1:21:57] and then we had the written word so we
[1:22:01] had a thought that we had the word now
[1:22:03] we got the written word but it don't
[1:22:04] stop there because the Bible said it was
[1:22:07] supposed to be living in Pistols read by
[1:22:09] all men so the thought got to come down
[1:22:11] from god it's got to become a word then
[1:22:14] it's recorded if it comes the written
[1:22:16] word but then when you hear it then you
[1:22:20] become the living words hallelujah and
[1:22:23] this is what God is trying to bring
[1:22:25] those two and then we're real leaving
[1:22:28] this thing every day
[1:22:30] Oh hallelujah glory to God under
[1:22:36] expectation for this you know your
[1:22:38] trials and in which we we hid that this
[1:22:41] morning persecution and trials are
[1:22:43] natural normal part of the Christian
[1:22:47] life a man perfect don't run from
[1:22:50] persecute don't get discouraged cuz
[1:22:52] you're going through right and then you
[1:22:54] oughta your honor you ought to begin to
[1:22:56] come if you're not going through like
[1:22:57] brother Quinton say you gotta get to
[1:22:59] begin the question what's wrong with me
[1:23:01] I ain't got no chops what I'm told is
[1:23:06] son Billy Paul you ought to be glad that
[1:23:09] there was chasing you because that means
[1:23:11] that you not in the devil's back pocket
[1:23:14] if he stop chasing you you know there's
[1:23:17] a problem right so one of the chasing
[1:23:20] you ought to be giving God glory for
[1:23:22] every trial for every temptation very
[1:23:24] distressed because persecution and
[1:23:26] trials are natural normal part of the
[1:23:30] Christian life Oh glory to God Amen I
[1:23:35] like that I like that let me go back to
[1:23:37] what was the Holy Ghost given forth
[1:23:39] notice the title what was the Holy Ghost
[1:23:41] given from that because most people
[1:23:44] think the Holy Ghost was given just to
[1:23:45] make them you know speak in tongues but
[1:23:47] no no it's more to it than that we going
[1:23:51] we're going well beyond just a tongue
[1:23:52] speaking and and and and I I even been
[1:23:55] praying I was praying this morning say
[1:23:57] Lord released every gift that you put in
[1:24:01] the Bible released that in the church
[1:24:03] releasing knowledge I called for
[1:24:06] knowledge
[1:24:07] I called for wisdom I called for tongues
[1:24:10] I called for interpretation of tongues
[1:24:13] amen
[1:24:14] I called for the gift of faith I called
[1:24:18] for the gift of working miracles amen
[1:24:22] hallelujah every gift that was written
[1:24:24] in first Corinthians 12 we call for
[1:24:27] those gifts to come forth in this church
[1:24:30] hallelujah amen but but but the good
[1:24:33] thing the other thing about about it is
[1:24:35] that we also want the life that goes
[1:24:37] with the gifts oh yeah
[1:24:41] not just people doing things with no
[1:24:42] life what we are because gifts come
[1:24:44] without repentance but we won't
[1:24:46] repentant people live in a life
[1:24:49] manifesting the gifts of God oh my god
[1:24:53] man I'm trying to try to get here this
[1:24:57] brother shared a testimony during
[1:24:58] yesterday that blessed me it was saying
[1:25:00] how the Lord used to deal with him and
[1:25:03] visions all the time and and why he was
[1:25:07] dealing with him in visions he said at
[1:25:09] one time was a young lady that come to
[1:25:11] church and she she came up for prayer
[1:25:14] because she wanted to receive the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost
[1:25:16] well while she's coming up for prayer a
[1:25:18] vision goes forward and the man can see
[1:25:21] in the vision that this this this girl
[1:25:24] is having a conversation with a father
[1:25:26] and the father telling her I don't want
[1:25:27] you to wear a particular thing I don't
[1:25:30] want you to dress that way I don't want
[1:25:31] you to do this and so they had a nice
[1:25:33] argument about it and after the argument
[1:25:36] was done the girl snuck it into her
[1:25:38] suitcase and she came to the meeting and
[1:25:41] while she coming down to the altar she
[1:25:44] got the thing going that her daddy told
[1:25:46] her not to wear so the God God showed it
[1:25:49] to the preacher and the preacher say
[1:25:51] sister I would like to pray for you to
[1:25:54] get the Holy Ghost but I can't pray for
[1:25:55] you to get the Holy Ghost because you
[1:25:57] wearing what your daddy told you not to
[1:26:00] wear and he said she said nobody knew
[1:26:04] that but God said yeah you said well she
[1:26:05] said what do I need to do see say you
[1:26:07] need to go make it right
[1:26:09] hallelujah before you get in here to
[1:26:11] receive the Holy Ghost you need to go
[1:26:12] make it right and that just bless me
[1:26:14] because there's a lot of folk that need
[1:26:16] to go make some things right hallelujah
[1:26:19] amen there's a lot of stuff that we do
[1:26:21] and we never make the thing right and we
[1:26:23] and we want to just overlook it and
[1:26:25] expect God just the blessings that's
[1:26:27] gonna actually clog things hallelujah
[1:26:31] there's some there's some husbands that
[1:26:33] got apologized to their wives there's
[1:26:35] some wives they got apologized to their
[1:26:37] husbands there's some children it got
[1:26:39] apologized to their parents there's some
[1:26:41] parents that might have to apologize to
[1:26:43] their children right we got to make some
[1:26:45] things right get this thing clear so God
[1:26:49] can get glory in this place when he said
[1:26:54] that that gif don't work as much as it
[1:26:56] used to work that's you know and I know
[1:26:57] why he was saying it but but the Bible
[1:27:00] said that he these gifts God gives them
[1:27:02] to the church and and if it's in the
[1:27:05] Bible we're supposed to believe it all
[1:27:08] right let me go on let me go on so what
[1:27:10] was the Holy Ghost giving fun all right
[1:27:12] he says then when this boy got to a
[1:27:15] certain age say he was matured all right
[1:27:19] so he's going back to Galatians 4 were
[1:27:21] that's what he's really picking up here
[1:27:22] you know he the boys raised under tutors
[1:27:25] a man and they're constantly reporting
[1:27:28] to the Father there they were constantly
[1:27:31] reporting to the father had a ball was
[1:27:33] progressing how he was getting along you
[1:27:35] know they give the boy certain tests and
[1:27:37] he have to pass those tests and they
[1:27:39] could see whether it's boys really
[1:27:40] coming into his own and it's the same
[1:27:42] thing say the Holy Ghost is our tutor
[1:27:44] the Holy Ghost is who reports to the
[1:27:46] Father the things that we're doing right
[1:27:48] so so when the Holy Ghost is report and
[1:27:50] what type of things that he have to say
[1:27:52] about you a man does they have positive
[1:27:54] things to say about you it doesn't have
[1:27:55] negative things to say about you so so
[1:27:57] as becoming a man as we're going through
[1:27:59] our trials we'll go through our tests
[1:28:01] it's an opportunity for the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] to see how we're going to respond amen
[1:28:04] we got to mature as brothers and sisters
[1:28:07] Amen in Christ listen says when this boy
[1:28:10] got to a certain age say he was matured
[1:28:12] if that boy was just a renegade no good
[1:28:16] didn't care for the father's business
[1:28:18] all he thought about was flirting and
[1:28:21] running with women a man if that's all
[1:28:24] the boy thought about was flirting and
[1:28:26] running with women drinking or gambling
[1:28:29] horse racing amen that boy would all
[1:28:34] days be a son but he was never placed in
[1:28:38] position to have other to have heir to
[1:28:42] all his father had hallelujah so if
[1:28:45] you're struggling in areas like that you
[1:28:47] already know that you're not gonna get
[1:28:49] this adoption that we're talking about
[1:28:51] right you've got to overcome something
[1:28:54] amen hallelujah amen and some of us we
[1:28:59] create our tribes the decisions that we
[1:29:02] make are the trials that we create come
[1:29:06] on somebody the dissent you got the live
[1:29:09] with your decision right Adam had to
[1:29:12] live with his decision glory to God and
[1:29:15] you don't have to live with your
[1:29:17] decision there I mean you created that
[1:29:20] based on the situation and then you tell
[1:29:22] God it's too hard no no no no I want too
[1:29:25] hard earlier and then when you were
[1:29:27] doing what you were doing it once you
[1:29:29] are there so you got to you got you
[1:29:31] gotta live with what you create and
[1:29:33] gotta give you grace to endure it ain't
[1:29:37] no shortcuts to God whatwhat is going on
[1:29:39] is that your your your characters being
[1:29:41] formed through the midst today I mean
[1:29:44] man I know I know I wouldn't have been
[1:29:46] able to handle what you're going through
[1:29:47] that's why I didn't make the decisions
[1:29:49] Oh hallelujah I didn't make those kind
[1:29:53] of decisions cuz I can't handle that but
[1:29:56] since you can God allow you to do that
[1:30:00] and now you got you got paid by the
[1:30:02] grace of God you'll make it you'll make
[1:30:04] it through all right amen don't give up
[1:30:06] on God cuz he he won't give up on you
[1:30:09] he's able all right come on
[1:30:14] so so look look he says I if he was a
[1:30:18] good boy and he was about to father's
[1:30:21] business and he proved to be the right
[1:30:23] child then they had a ceremony they took
[1:30:26] the boy out into the street put a white
[1:30:29] robe on him and they set him up
[1:30:32] Oh see I feel like singing again I'm
[1:30:34] gonna put on my robe tell the story
[1:30:39] how I made it old why say they put a
[1:30:43] white rope a man on him they set him up
[1:30:47] on a scaffold so all the city could see
[1:30:51] they made a feast and a jubilee and the
[1:30:54] father then had a ceremony of adoption
[1:30:57] he adopted his own son into his own
[1:31:02] business
[1:31:03] oh not answer that's another statement
[1:31:06] right there now does the son was born
[1:31:09] into the family nothing could stop that
[1:31:12] right I mean he was predestinated and he
[1:31:15] was born into that family nothing
[1:31:17] stopped that birth there but now through
[1:31:19] his maturity he's not just adopted a man
[1:31:23] into the family but he's adopted into
[1:31:25] the business oh yes amen are we about
[1:31:31] our father's business
[1:31:33] [Music]
[1:31:35] now sometimes we're certainly about our
[1:31:38] business that's why I was saying that
[1:31:41] last week see it's okay to have vision
[1:31:44] because without a vision that people
[1:31:46] will perish
[1:31:48] that's one thing they have a vision
[1:31:50] that's great I'm not speaking against
[1:31:52] that however there's a higher vision
[1:31:54] than your personal vision and that's why
[1:31:58] Paul said I was not disobedient to the
[1:32:02] heavenly vision so doxygen puts you in
[1:32:08] the father's business all right and make
[1:32:11] sure about the father's business look at
[1:32:13] this he goes on to say this he says and
[1:32:16] then the Sun was co-equal with his
[1:32:21] father in other words if it than the day
[1:32:24] the sons name on the chick was just as
[1:32:27] good as the daddy's I like that now
[1:32:30] watch what God did when his son was born
[1:32:32] he let him go for 30 years tested him
[1:32:35] tried him then he give him three years
[1:32:37] of heart trial and maybe that's where we
[1:32:39] are right now three years of hard trial
[1:32:41] right three years of hard trial and then
[1:32:44] the end of the heart trial when he's
[1:32:46] seen that his son was about the father's
[1:32:48] business not Transfiguration
[1:32:51] Luke he took Peter James and John three
[1:32:54] witnesses and went up on top of the
[1:32:55] mountain and their God performed the
[1:32:57] laws of adoption they looked up they
[1:33:00] seen Jesus and his clothes shine as
[1:33:02] white as the light lightning and and as
[1:33:05] a cloud overshadowed him and a voice
[1:33:07] come out of the cloud and said this is
[1:33:10] my beloved son hear ye him I'll sit down
[1:33:13] now and have no more to say
[1:33:15] what he says is law in truth you know
[1:33:21] this is a pretty important statement
[1:33:23] because so here the Satan I mean God the
[1:33:27] God has actually shown them through
[1:33:29] Mount Transfiguration that he's adopted
[1:33:30] a son now don't don't get me wrong
[1:33:33] adoption and placing is not just casting
[1:33:36] out Devils we're doing that right a man
[1:33:40] is not just the healing of the see we're
[1:33:42] already doing those things that that's
[1:33:44] part of it yes but it just don't stop
[1:33:46] there I mean the character is involved
[1:33:49] here right
[1:33:50] are you really displaying the character
[1:33:52] of Christ you know when I was um you
[1:33:55] know after you go to Matthew 17 follow
[1:33:58] Jesus life at the Transfiguration he was
[1:34:01] actually prepared for crops but he had
[1:34:04] the humble himself to death has an
[1:34:07] adopted son you might have to humble
[1:34:09] yourself to some serious situations
[1:34:12] things that you can't change with your
[1:34:15] power things you can't change and you
[1:34:20] got to understand that you got to get to
[1:34:22] a place where you know what is the will
[1:34:24] of God and what you know maybe it may be
[1:34:26] Satan might be trying to tempt you to do
[1:34:28] something you should be doing hallelujah
[1:34:30] he did the same thing to Jesus when it
[1:34:32] came to him amen and Matthew for look
[1:34:35] for when he came to the Mount of
[1:34:37] temptation experienced Satan was trying
[1:34:39] to get him to do things that he was
[1:34:41] supposed to do and the devil is right
[1:34:43] now trying to get many of us to do
[1:34:46] things that were not supposed to do we
[1:34:49] got to yield ourselves to the process
[1:34:52] what does God trying to take us to
[1:34:54] remember you know we talked about them
[1:34:56] that the diamond the diamond is cut and
[1:35:00] see that when the Dharma's cut that is
[1:35:02] descent you know you got these four sea
[1:35:05] - diamond to cut the color the clarity
[1:35:07] the carats
[1:35:08] these are things you look for in a
[1:35:10] diamond but the most important thing in
[1:35:12] the diamond is to cut right and when the
[1:35:15] diamond is cut it goes through a man the
[1:35:19] cut happens with three things
[1:35:21] it's the brightness the fire and the
[1:35:24] scintillation right these screens are
[1:35:26] these three things I need it for the cut
[1:35:29] the brightness is the internal external
[1:35:32] reflection of white light from the
[1:35:33] diamond the fire is the scattering of
[1:35:36] white light into all the colors of the
[1:35:39] rainbow
[1:35:39] I like that then so when you're looking
[1:35:41] at the fire in the diamond and then
[1:35:44] you're looking to see if there are seven
[1:35:46] colors reflected because there are seven
[1:35:48] colors in the rainbow
[1:35:49] oh my god of the scintillation is the
[1:35:52] amount of sparkle of diamond produces
[1:35:55] and the pattern of light and dark areas
[1:35:57] caused by reflections within the diamond
[1:36:00] now now notice this now so these three
[1:36:02] factors in cutting the diamond the
[1:36:05] brightness the fire the scintillation
[1:36:07] those three factors of spread to the
[1:36:09] fire is supposed to produce seven colors
[1:36:13] hallelujah and this is what this is what
[1:36:15] I want you to get because your trial
[1:36:18] it's forming you and shaping you and
[1:36:21] molding you and making you reflect seven
[1:36:25] colors let me put it this way your
[1:36:27] tribes are forming and making you not
[1:36:30] just reflect seven colors but it's
[1:36:32] causing you to reflect seven virtues
[1:36:37] hallelujah so if you've been cut rights
[1:36:39] we ought to see faith we oughta see
[1:36:43] virtue we are see knowledge temperance
[1:36:46] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:36:48] and steam it together by love that's
[1:36:52] what we're looking for
[1:36:54] amen we're talking about adopted sons
[1:36:56] this light thing
[1:36:57] twice hat has got to live and chop the
[1:37:00] body those seven colors these seven
[1:37:05] colors are actually b7 purchase that's
[1:37:07] reflected through the people hallelujah
[1:37:11] see I've talked to you this not just for
[1:37:12] you know babes God trying to bring us
[1:37:15] somewhere God trying to elevate us we're
[1:37:18] here to take take over the father's
[1:37:20] business what is his business what is
[1:37:22] his heavenly vision we gotta tap into
[1:37:26] that as sons and daughters of God can I
[1:37:29] go a little further
[1:37:30] all right now we were so you know this
[1:37:35] this statement oh yeah the statement
[1:37:40] that I just read here
[1:37:42] they're the Mount transfigurations
[1:37:44] experienced this is my beloved son hear
[1:37:47] ye him and it said brother Branham said
[1:37:52] God pretty much said I'll sit down now
[1:37:54] and have no more to say but what he says
[1:37:56] is law and truth now you know that
[1:37:59] happened with Moses you know that happen
[1:38:02] with Moses where God pretty much said
[1:38:03] Moses you bring the people to the
[1:38:05] mountain and and and and and as he put
[1:38:08] Moses on the journey he expected Moses
[1:38:11] to handle anything that came up anything
[1:38:13] and brother branham even tells us that
[1:38:15] God was going to sit down until he heard
[1:38:18] moses cry oh my god
[1:38:21] when God heard Moses cry Lord what shall
[1:38:25] I do right that's when God responds like
[1:38:27] what shall I do
[1:38:28] Moses speak to the people and move
[1:38:30] forward now if Moses was in a place at
[1:38:33] that time with God where God wanted to
[1:38:35] go sit down because he thought he had a
[1:38:36] I'm a to a son on the earth to handle
[1:38:39] things what do you think about us all
[1:38:41] the word that we have received right
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:45] we should be coming to a place where God
[1:38:47] and I don't worry about certain things
[1:38:48] no more from us he can just give us the
[1:38:51] business and know that it's gonna be
[1:38:53] taken care of
[1:38:55] hallelujah
[1:38:57] a man church right so let me let me just
[1:39:00] count it let me let me take this a
[1:39:02] little further with you here a man own
[1:39:04] today
[1:39:04] oh my god my god I want
[1:39:07] dropped some things amen yeah let me let
[1:39:10] me just start with a little quote here
[1:39:13] out of it is the rising of the Sun now
[1:39:16] now stay with me
[1:39:17] amen as I as I read this stay with me
[1:39:22] it says I said let me straighten a
[1:39:26] little scripture here for you I think
[1:39:28] we're off of the phone and it says but
[1:39:32] but it says but we but we are still here
[1:39:35] st. John 5:24 jesus said he that hears
[1:39:39] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:39:41] me has everlasting life
[1:39:45] now look I'd go down the street and just
[1:39:49] take that literally what what it is
[1:39:52] without the spiritual understanding not
[1:39:55] making it say nothing else but just
[1:39:58] saying what it says see the right word
[1:40:00] here in the Greek it says in the
[1:40:02] original sense he that understandeth my
[1:40:05] words hallelujah
[1:40:07] go hurry up it says now to prove that's
[1:40:10] right I go down here and here's a drunk
[1:40:13] coming along the street and with some
[1:40:16] other man's wife on his arms and cussing
[1:40:18] and taking God's name in vain and
[1:40:20] everything else like that say did you
[1:40:22] hear what the preacher said did you yeah
[1:40:25] I heard it that don't mean he's got
[1:40:26] eternal life
[1:40:27] just because he heard what the preacher
[1:40:29] said don't mean he got eternal life see
[1:40:31] it's not just he that hears my words but
[1:40:33] is he that understands so brother Brad
[1:40:35] was bringing some clarity around this
[1:40:36] right I'm in paragraph 161 he says I
[1:40:40] said did you yeah I heard it that don't
[1:40:43] mean it's got eternal are see he that
[1:40:45] understand with my word and look at this
[1:40:46] he that is an eagle he that
[1:40:54] understandeth my words but it's not just
[1:40:58] a ma'am I just he that heareth but he
[1:41:01] didn't understand of my word he that is
[1:41:04] an eagle I like that right now brother
[1:41:09] branham I want more scripture than that
[1:41:12] alright my sheep hear my voice a
[1:41:17] stranger they won't follow
[1:41:20] since now this is the key statement as
[1:41:22] in the marriage and divorce case since
[1:41:27] the other day when the holy spirit had
[1:41:29] told me that I come said just the way he
[1:41:33] told me and when he talked about you
[1:41:35] know there was some some real critical
[1:41:37] things that he was giving to go through
[1:41:38] before he preached marriage and divorce
[1:41:40] he actually he had to wait on the Lord
[1:41:42] wait on the Lord brother Branham went up
[1:41:45] into the mountain and as he was up in
[1:41:48] the mountain praying you know over the
[1:41:50] over over the southern marriage and
[1:41:52] divorce people from all over the city
[1:41:55] saw the pillow fire going up and down
[1:41:57] the mountain up and down in the area
[1:42:00] where he was praying the area still
[1:42:03] there called finger Rock and they think
[1:42:05] if they saw the pillow fire going up and
[1:42:07] down the mountain up and down and one
[1:42:09] brother sitting there pumping gas he say
[1:42:11] brother Branham is over in that mountain
[1:42:13] right there so the brother branham comes
[1:42:16] out the mountain went down to the gas
[1:42:17] station get gas and and they say he
[1:42:20] looked at brother MC now brother Branham
[1:42:22] used over that mountain when you
[1:42:23] represent no no no no no when they say
[1:42:26] brother Branham I know you were you were
[1:42:29] over in that mountain because we saw the
[1:42:31] pillar of fire going up and down in the
[1:42:33] mountain so brother yeah I was there now
[1:42:39] there is a reason I want you to I want
[1:42:41] you to get this I want you to get this
[1:42:43] lord help us to bring this out I want
[1:42:46] you to get this this they say I've
[1:42:49] imagined before so before I preached
[1:42:51] there are certain things that he's
[1:42:52] standing at the end of the marriage of
[1:42:54] divorce he may have made some come and
[1:42:56] say the reason that many people are in
[1:42:57] the condition at the end right now is
[1:42:59] because they were not taught
[1:43:01] they weren't taught he said that's why
[1:43:03] they they end up in the conditions that
[1:43:05] they end now and because marriage and
[1:43:07] divorce thing nothing to play with
[1:43:08] right they say you say many of them are
[1:43:11] in the conditioning and because they
[1:43:12] were not taught and as he said he said
[1:43:15] you say you know he comes down out of
[1:43:18] that and he says now this is what the
[1:43:19] Lord told me he say this is for my group
[1:43:21] only right if you disagree with this
[1:43:24] that's fine but this is for my church
[1:43:25] this from my group and say he say you
[1:43:27] say he say go long stay as you are but
[1:43:32] teach
[1:43:33] children never to do anything like this
[1:43:37] so he gave that word and that gave him
[1:43:40] the authority has a son of God as an
[1:43:44] adopted place son of God to speak a word
[1:43:47] like that oh my god he say the same way
[1:43:50] Paul was given the authority and the
[1:43:52] same way Moses was given the authority
[1:43:54] God gave him the authority now there's
[1:43:59] something after he said these words
[1:44:02] there's something that was spoken and I
[1:44:06] want to read that
[1:44:07] this isn't this quote it's in some other
[1:44:09] areas too but look at this it says as in
[1:44:12] the marriage and divorce case the other
[1:44:14] day when the holy spirit had told me
[1:44:15] that I come said it just the way he told
[1:44:18] me says some Minister lady gave me a
[1:44:24] right sharp little bawling out can you
[1:44:29] imagine this a woman preacher coming to
[1:44:30] the Prophet to straighten him up she
[1:44:33] wrong in the first place wrong double
[1:44:36] wrong says she said I guess look at her
[1:44:43] words
[1:44:44] I guess you take the place of God my
[1:44:52] brother ever said no ma'am I'm not
[1:44:55] trying to take the place of God and see
[1:44:58] when I give it a title like co-equal
[1:45:00] with Jesus
[1:45:01] I guess you're trying to take the place
[1:45:06] of God and I see we got to get this
[1:45:07] thing right in the middle of the road I
[1:45:09] told you just drop a bomb and then we'll
[1:45:10] fix it up later on right you say you say
[1:45:13] say up he said she said
[1:45:14] I guess you try to take the pledge guy I
[1:45:17] said no ma'am she said well you told
[1:45:20] them their sin is forgiven
[1:45:22] Oh God you told them you brother branham
[1:45:28] told the people that their sin was
[1:45:30] forgiven says you told them their sin is
[1:45:33] forgiven say it well said only God has
[1:45:36] power and wishes giver says only God has
[1:45:40] power to forgive sins right says see
[1:45:42] another brother brems I see another
[1:45:43] Pharisee see I say you
[1:45:45] see that you might know that Jesus told
[1:45:48] Peter and apostle's after he told him
[1:45:50] thou art Christ the Son of God he said
[1:45:53] bless top down see the son of Jonas
[1:45:55] flesh-and-blood never revealed this to
[1:45:57] you but my father which is in heaven
[1:45:59] hath revealed it upon this rock I'll
[1:46:01] build my church the gates of Hell can't
[1:46:03] prevail against it and I give unto thee
[1:46:05] the keys wherever you burn oh my god
[1:46:10] whatever you bind on earth
[1:46:12] I'll bonded in heaven whatever you loose
[1:46:14] on earth so you trying to get the latest
[1:46:16] II God gave that authority to the church
[1:46:20] and with that type of authority it makes
[1:46:24] you co-equal this is why you need
[1:46:27] character right because with the power
[1:46:30] without character is satanic that's why
[1:46:35] we need the character of God this why we
[1:46:37] need to be cut this far beneath the
[1:46:39] reflection of those seven virtues in our
[1:46:41] life this is what we need this because
[1:46:43] this is elevating us to another place
[1:46:46] the the the power that's in your words
[1:46:49] your words can crush your words can bind
[1:46:54] your words can loose your words can
[1:46:57] deliver your words can do great things
[1:46:59] that's why you got to control your words
[1:47:03] hallelujah you know I find myself doing
[1:47:06] that sometime there's certain things you
[1:47:09] go through and you're like man nah I
[1:47:10] could say this and if I do say it I have
[1:47:14] to sit there and think if I see it
[1:47:16] what's the impact that has gotta have on
[1:47:18] the person will it crush you or will it
[1:47:22] help them so sometimes I just gotta
[1:47:24] fight my tongue can it go a little
[1:47:28] further look at this
[1:47:30] that's that divine revelation of the
[1:47:34] Word made flesh listen if it was blessed
[1:47:38] in the end that day by the Sun the groom
[1:47:41] is flesh today by the bride notice he
[1:47:47] didn't even put himself there it was if
[1:47:50] it was flesh that day by the Sun the
[1:47:52] groom is flesh today by the bride see
[1:47:57] whosoever says you were in it
[1:47:59] so then they are admitted who services
[1:48:01] you retain to them they are retained now
[1:48:04] the Catholic Church picked that up and
[1:48:06] takes it to their priest but that's
[1:48:08] carnal watch it was a spiritual reveal
[1:48:10] word that did it that's the reason he
[1:48:13] told them to be baptized in the name of
[1:48:15] the Father Son the Holy Ghost he knows
[1:48:17] they knew who he was
[1:48:20] can we just pick up a couple of
[1:48:21] scriptures here because this lady you
[1:48:23] know uses this statement you know you've
[1:48:26] taken the place of God only oh my god
[1:48:30] got a man the ability to forgive sins
[1:48:33] let's go to Luke five and five
[1:48:38] Oh Luke 5 starting at verse 17 here
[1:48:49] that's why brother Branham says see
[1:48:51] another Pharisee this woman preacher
[1:48:53] coming to him and making that statement
[1:48:55] this is another fare seat Oh God verse
[1:49:02] five actually starting at verse yeah
[1:49:06] verse 17 notice this and it came to pass
[1:49:09] on a certain day as he was teaching that
[1:49:13] they were Pharisees and doctors of the
[1:49:17] law sitting by which were come out of
[1:49:20] every town of Galilee and Judea and
[1:49:22] Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was
[1:49:24] present to heal them and the whole men
[1:49:28] brought in a bed a man which was taken
[1:49:30] with a posse so he's paralyzed right and
[1:49:35] they sought means to bring him in and to
[1:49:37] lay him before him now you know the
[1:49:40] reason they bringing this manatee is
[1:49:42] because they know if they could just get
[1:49:43] him into the presence of Jesus things
[1:49:44] was gonna change hallelujah right it
[1:49:47] says and when they could not find by
[1:49:50] what way they might bring him in because
[1:49:53] of the munch - they went up on the
[1:49:57] housetop now
[1:49:58] now now I'm here in Luke 5 we're picking
[1:50:01] this stuff that they went up there but
[1:50:03] really brother Branham said what
[1:50:04] happened is that the paralyzed man
[1:50:06] suggested to his friends to take him up
[1:50:10] to the roof right take them up
[1:50:12] it says they went upon the housetop and
[1:50:14] let him down through the tilling with
[1:50:17] his couch into the myths before Jesus I
[1:50:20] did not skip I'm on first verse 19 is
[1:50:24] that right yeah verse 19 it says so they
[1:50:27] let him down on the couch into the mist
[1:50:29] before Jesus verse 26 and when he saw
[1:50:33] their faith he said unto Him man thy
[1:50:36] sins are forgiven thee notice this now
[1:50:39] notice it they've dropped this man he's
[1:50:41] paralyzed and and what they do is take
[1:50:44] the man up to the roof pull all the you
[1:50:48] know the the pilings off and everything
[1:50:50] and say just they just interrupted the
[1:50:52] service drop the man right down into
[1:50:55] Jesus presence and now they brought the
[1:50:58] man there for healing but Jesus says
[1:51:03] that stands not forgiven Oh hallelujah
[1:51:06] you know this is the thing we got to
[1:51:09] understand the dual atonement that came
[1:51:11] with Calvary right we get healing for
[1:51:15] our bodies we also get forgiveness for
[1:51:18] our sins and you realize the power and
[1:51:22] the forgiveness of sins is so great that
[1:51:24] it makes you a son and a daughter of God
[1:51:28] that there's nothing to get you when
[1:51:30] you've been washed in the blood
[1:51:32] hallelujah Church glory to God let me go
[1:51:35] on he says man my sins are forgiven thee
[1:51:38] now he was surrounded by Pharisees
[1:51:40] Sadducees I'm looking at what happened
[1:51:42] in verse 21 and the scribes and the
[1:51:44] Pharisees began to reason saying who is
[1:51:46] this which speaketh blasphemies who can
[1:51:51] forgive sins but God alone then look at
[1:51:55] a question who can forgive sins but God
[1:51:59] alone now Jesus understood his position
[1:52:04] Jesus understood his purpose Jesus
[1:52:08] understood who he was right so that's
[1:52:11] why he said rather than rather say man
[1:52:13] you're healed he say your sins are
[1:52:15] forgiven oh my god and see one day two
[1:52:19] churches don't recognize we have that
[1:52:21] same power oh yes we do as adopted son
[1:52:25] we who's ever since we remit they our
[1:52:27] men who substance we retain they are
[1:52:30] retained hallelujah hallelujah look at
[1:52:35] this
[1:52:36] let's go on first winter says but when
[1:52:39] Jesus perceived their thoughts he
[1:52:40] answered saying unto them what reason ye
[1:52:42] in yourself and your hearts it says
[1:52:45] whether it's easy to say that sins be
[1:52:48] forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk
[1:52:54] but that you may know they're not not
[1:52:59] Jesus but I don't already know who I am
[1:53:00] but that ye may know that ye may know
[1:53:05] that the Son of man have power upon
[1:53:08] earth to forgive sins he said unto the
[1:53:12] sick of palsy I say unto thee arise and
[1:53:15] take up that couch and go into that
[1:53:19] house look at this verse 25 and
[1:53:21] immediately he rose up before them and
[1:53:23] took up that whereon he lay and departed
[1:53:26] to his own house glorifying God you know
[1:53:30] this this power that brother Brett that
[1:53:32] Jesus just demonstrated it was also
[1:53:34] shown in brother branham's ministry see
[1:53:37] the the village to who service stands
[1:53:40] you permit there a minute who's ever
[1:53:45] sins you retain their retain and see the
[1:53:48] whole the Spirit gave brother Bradley
[1:53:50] said I got a big test for you big trial
[1:53:53] what what is it and didn't tell him -
[1:53:55] that just got to test for you I got a
[1:53:57] test and it says you going around
[1:54:00] looking just couldn't find what the test
[1:54:01] was one day he had their preacher while
[1:54:03] he preaching this young couple on the
[1:54:05] front row just start making out on the
[1:54:07] front row
[1:54:08] no that wasn't appropriate for church
[1:54:09] but he said he say oh he said please
[1:54:13] stop deacons come back no please stop
[1:54:16] and the more they talk to him the worse
[1:54:19] they got they said please
[1:54:22] he's just preaching and and then you
[1:54:24] have to stop as preachers say please
[1:54:25] stop please you know sorry I'm listening
[1:54:29] to you they just got worse so then the
[1:54:30] Holy Spirit told them you see I I give
[1:54:34] them to you and whatever you say it'll
[1:54:37] be that way
[1:54:38] they're in your hands now and he looked
[1:54:41] and he knew that he could have said
[1:54:43] right there you filthy spirit from hell
[1:54:48] both y'all drop dead right now they
[1:54:51] would have dropped dead but instead of
[1:54:54] killing the people this is where
[1:54:57] character because he had the character
[1:55:00] of God he could actually say uh I
[1:55:02] forgive you and the Holy Spirit say
[1:55:06] those are the words that I was looking
[1:55:08] for notice God put him in a spot to see
[1:55:11] what he would do about it now he had the
[1:55:13] authority of the Son of God the white
[1:55:15] the people out but he said no I forgive
[1:55:17] you let me tell you something when you
[1:55:20] can practice forgiveness you set a
[1:55:24] prisoner free only to realize you were
[1:55:28] the prisoner when you practice
[1:55:34] forgiveness you set prisoners free only
[1:55:38] to realize that you are the one that's
[1:55:40] in the prison I'll either here let me go
[1:55:46] a little further see these Pharisees
[1:55:50] when they saw Jesus forgive this man
[1:55:53] sinned they knew that no this man only
[1:55:55] God could do this what Jesus said I am
[1:55:57] God in the flesh
[1:55:59] I am God in the flesh now I gotta bring
[1:56:02] this forward because you got to see that
[1:56:04] you're co-equal with Jesus amen when
[1:56:08] brother Branham took it upon himself to
[1:56:12] pronounce that and I'll even I'll even
[1:56:15] I'll even show I'll give you a quote on
[1:56:17] that when he pronounced in marriage and
[1:56:20] divorce you know tell them to go and sin
[1:56:22] no more
[1:56:22] let me just read two quotes on that if
[1:56:25] y'all don't mind first what I want to
[1:56:27] read is is actually out of marriage and
[1:56:29] divorce it's going to be paragraph three
[1:56:31] eleven and then I'm gonna read for who
[1:56:33] is this Melchizedek because that's the
[1:56:35] sermon that he preached right after
[1:56:36] marriage and divorce okay so let me just
[1:56:39] give you two to quote side of that
[1:56:41] denial I'll go a little further and
[1:56:42] we'll bring it to a close today a man
[1:56:45] your co-equal hallelujah so here in
[1:56:48] marriage and divorce he says and in
[1:56:50] first Corinthians
[1:56:51] the seventh chapter the 12th and 15th
[1:56:54] verse in the New Testament of the new
[1:56:57] testament prophet
[1:56:58] Paul who meant the same thing in the
[1:56:59] church and spoke this this is I not the
[1:57:03] Lord that's right says because of the
[1:57:05] divorce condition he says it wasn't so
[1:57:09] from the beginning but Moses was
[1:57:13] permitted it and God recognized that
[1:57:15] righteousness and Paul also had a right
[1:57:18] when he found his church in that
[1:57:20] condition now you believe this to be
[1:57:22] true and believe it to come from God and
[1:57:24] by the vindication of his clout and his
[1:57:28] message that's brought me this far
[1:57:30] should not God upon the mountain permit
[1:57:34] me to do the same thing to suffer you to
[1:57:37] go on the way you are and do it no more
[1:57:40] right go with your wives and live in
[1:57:44] peace for the hour is late the coming of
[1:57:47] the Lord is at hand we haven't got time
[1:57:49] to break these things up don't you dare
[1:57:54] try to do it again I'm speaking only to
[1:57:57] my congregation but if you're married
[1:57:59] and God brought me witness of that on
[1:58:00] the mountain that I could say this a
[1:58:02] supernatural relation of the opening of
[1:58:05] the seven seals and this is a question
[1:58:07] of God's Word let them go on in as they
[1:58:11] are and sin no more now you have to go
[1:58:15] listen to the whole sermon of marriage
[1:58:17] and divorce to understand the context of
[1:58:19] what he just said there but he made a
[1:58:22] comment after that statement was made in
[1:58:24] the following sermon and who is this
[1:58:27] Melchizedek it makes a comment about
[1:58:30] that statement that I just read he makes
[1:58:32] a comment so let's pull up who is monkey
[1:58:34] who is this Melchizedek and I want to
[1:58:36] read to you what he says there
[1:58:38] hallelujah it says this now I just want
[1:58:43] to comment just a moment on the mornings
[1:58:47] message there's no doubt I didn't get
[1:58:51] completely through with it
[1:58:53] but I think you understand and I'm sure
[1:58:55] I'm sure you didn't you'll never know
[1:58:58] what that was for me to do it says now
[1:59:02] it seems very simple to you
[1:59:04] so we said we've just got a quote quotes
[1:59:06] it seems very simple to you right here
[1:59:09] it says says says that's the first tip
[1:59:11] of you that you see what you're doing
[1:59:14] he says you are taking the place of God
[1:59:18] to pronounce something it's only brother
[1:59:22] Branham standing there to pronounce this
[1:59:24] what God gave him in the mountain he
[1:59:26] says I'm taking the place of God to
[1:59:27] pronounce it that's a powerful statement
[1:59:31] I'm taking the place of God this is this
[1:59:35] right you just you know with this type
[1:59:37] of power this type of authority you got
[1:59:38] to know what you're doing that's why you
[1:59:41] don't give a loaded gun to the little
[1:59:44] kids they would kill up everything and
[1:59:47] not even realize what they were doing
[1:59:48] right so so so you got it you got to
[1:59:51] understand this type of power has to
[1:59:52] come - sir - Matt or a man hallelujah I
[1:59:56] can tell you right now every trial that
[1:59:58] brother Brandon went through brought him
[2:00:00] to this place where he could do
[2:00:01] something like this and every child that
[2:00:03] you're going through is bringing you to
[2:00:04] the same place look at it now watch this
[2:00:08] he says you are taking the place of God
[2:00:11] to pronounce something and before I
[2:00:13] would do that it had to come an answer
[2:00:17] from God hallelujah
[2:00:19] don't just start speaking just to speak
[2:00:21] you got that you got that be in control
[2:00:23] these things that actually controlled by
[2:00:26] motive and objective it's got to be
[2:00:29] right all they got to be right when you
[2:00:32] talk about adoption
[2:00:33] listen oh boy - God he says and he says
[2:00:36] you're taking the place of God do
[2:00:38] something before I would do that it had
[2:00:40] to come an answer from God and he had to
[2:00:42] come down and he visibly showed himself
[2:00:45] and gave the revelation therefore see
[2:00:48] this is to the church and remember I
[2:00:51] said this what I said was to the church
[2:00:54] only and so that you might have
[2:00:56] confidence and know that was the same
[2:00:58] God that said to me up there where there
[2:01:00] was no squirrel speaking and stay there
[2:01:02] will be and three straight times that
[2:01:04] happened now if he can buy the same word
[2:01:06] create something that isn't there how
[2:01:08] much more will this hold fast at the day
[2:01:11] of judgment see people were there to see
[2:01:13] things and now as Paul said in days gone
[2:01:15] by there's man with him who felt the
[2:01:18] earth
[2:01:18] and didn't hear the voice but they seen
[2:01:21] the pillar of fire brother branham said
[2:01:24] when he was a dare announcing or
[2:01:25] pronouncing what God gave him permitting
[2:01:28] him to say of regarding marriage and
[2:01:29] divorce he said I was taking the place
[2:01:32] of God
[2:01:33] that's a powerful statement I was taking
[2:01:37] the place of God that lady coming
[2:01:45] accused him after he made this a you
[2:01:46] know so you must be taking the place of
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:48] you know this co-equal thing goes all
[2:01:51] the way back to the Garden of Eden
[2:01:53] because before sin came in Eve was
[2:01:58] co-equal with Adam they both had the
[2:02:03] same Authority they both had the same
[2:02:05] power in spirit form
[2:02:07] they were co-equal the fall did not
[2:02:09] happen until she came in the flesh but
[2:02:12] as spirit because Adam was both feminine
[2:02:14] and masculine spirit and in that form
[2:02:18] they were co-equal hallelujah and the
[2:02:23] Spirit of God is actually trying to
[2:02:24] bring us all back to this place where we
[2:02:26] realized brothers and sisters you are
[2:02:28] co-equal with Jesus your spirit is
[2:02:33] co-equal now your flesh still got to be
[2:02:36] subject to the laws of God you
[2:02:40] understand that right this don't mean
[2:02:42] that the lies now a man can take
[2:02:45] authority over the husband she still got
[2:02:47] to follow the Word of God but when it
[2:02:49] comes to sickness when it comes to
[2:02:52] disease when it comes to the devil that
[2:02:56] white is co-equal and has the same
[2:03:00] authority whatever she buys will be
[2:03:03] bound
[2:03:04] and whatever she loses would be loose
[2:03:06] man I'll tell you I'm thinking about I'm
[2:03:08] thinking about this brother I can't
[2:03:11] think of his name right now but I
[2:03:12] remember brother branham told him say
[2:03:14] your brother got these fits epileptic
[2:03:16] fits and and and and this man you know
[2:03:20] when he was pretty big guy by six foot
[2:03:22] four 277 pounds and every time you have
[2:03:25] a fit
[2:03:26] say everybody get out of its way
[2:03:28] everybody get out the house well one day
[2:03:30] you know brother branham say say your
[2:03:32] brother next time we have a fit like
[2:03:33] that
[2:03:34] he said jump on your brother take his
[2:03:36] shirt off throw it in the fire and say
[2:03:39] this I do in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:41] Christ
[2:03:41] well the brother you know he got that he
[2:03:44] went home and told his wife I got the
[2:03:46] staff the Lord the Prophet told me that
[2:03:48] the next time my brother had a epilim
[2:03:50] epileptic fit take his shirt off throw
[2:03:53] it in the fire say this I do in the name
[2:03:55] of Lord Jesus Christ said he'll have no
[2:03:56] more fits after I do that she said she
[2:03:58] said okay all right
[2:04:00] well you know that brother brought
[2:04:02] winning got his brother say I want you
[2:04:03] to live with me they were waiting on him
[2:04:05] to have a fit
[2:04:06] well this brother got his brother living
[2:04:09] there but brother Brandon comes and him
[2:04:12] and the brother want to go hunting when
[2:04:14] he leaves the epileptic boy back with
[2:04:16] the wife and the kids huh
[2:04:19] and while they are huntin we got cell
[2:04:22] phones back then ain't no call and I
[2:04:24] said hey I need your home right now she
[2:04:26] heard what her husband tohe right and
[2:04:30] when she heard the testimony of what her
[2:04:32] husband told her soon as her
[2:04:34] brother-in-law had that epileptic fit
[2:04:36] rather than rising up and running she
[2:04:40] had thus saith the Lord she was a little
[2:04:43] lady about a hundred and twenty 130
[2:04:45] pounds
[2:04:45] she saw him act up she went in jumped on
[2:04:49] top level took his shirt off this time
[2:04:52] to in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:54] and her brother mo was he ever
[2:04:59] see see see did this brings us all
[2:05:04] everybody back to a place mama and
[2:05:07] sister is brought back to a place of
[2:05:09] Christ where we can put that devil on
[2:05:12] the run and stop running from the devil
[2:05:16] see there they're still there still you
[2:05:18] know don't get it twisted cuz after the
[2:05:21] fall God made the husband the head of
[2:05:24] the wife and anytime you see a man the
[2:05:27] wife leading the husband you see a
[2:05:28] problem because God never established
[2:05:32] that God can establish then when you see
[2:05:35] a wife leading a husband you see a
[2:05:38] problem amen
[2:05:40] a man tonight let me say it this way -
[2:05:43] if you ain't if you can't leave yourself
[2:05:46] as a man you don't need to be trying to
[2:05:49] leave no woman then let's just lay it
[2:05:55] out there right hey man you can't you
[2:05:59] can't leave yourself don't be tryin to
[2:06:00] leave no woman crazy
[2:06:02] God you can't expect her to subject us
[2:06:03] up to you all right
[2:06:06] Amen it's a number to truly try to do we
[2:06:09] try to use the word just for our
[2:06:11] googling the Bible say yeah the Bible
[2:06:14] also obscene all right
[2:06:17] amen you know if the wife supposed to be
[2:06:20] subject to the husband but also the
[2:06:21] husband who love his wife the way Christ
[2:06:22] loved the church all right the key to
[2:06:25] unlocking submission is love okay I'm
[2:06:29] going on but I'm trying to show that
[2:06:31] that that co-equal that co-equal place
[2:06:37] was there at beginning when they were
[2:06:39] both spirits they would they had that
[2:06:41] they had that co-equal so when Jesus
[2:06:44] went to the cross he's bringing this
[2:06:45] back to the church livvie co-equal but
[2:06:49] we have to go through the tutor and we
[2:06:50] got to go through the training we got to
[2:06:51] go through all of that before we could
[2:06:53] actually get to this place so don't run
[2:06:55] from the trial count it all joy God try
[2:06:57] to shape some things out of you and
[2:06:58] notice I say diamonds cut other garments
[2:07:01] can I put it this way I cut you you cut
[2:07:06] me
[2:07:10] because we have to cut each other
[2:07:12] alright but we were gonna be reflecting
[2:07:15] setting comes seven virtues through the
[2:07:20] cutting process alright thank you Jesus
[2:07:25] now god effect in his church the
[2:07:31] prophecy if I tell you out of the Bible
[2:07:33] you got to believe it so I'm gonna get
[2:07:36] it at least one scripture in here so you
[2:07:38] can believe it
[2:07:39] let me read this quote God perfectness
[2:07:42] Church they could look at what he says
[2:07:43] here oh my god since the Pentecostals
[2:07:52] has received the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:55] Ghost and that makes them a part of part
[2:07:58] that make them apart fellowship and
[2:07:59] relationship with God that's born again
[2:08:02] and a son and daughter of God tell them
[2:08:05] out of the Bible and they'll believe it
[2:08:09] now I'm going to stop that quote right
[2:08:11] there I'm coming back to it I'm going to
[2:08:13] tell you how to the Bible so you can
[2:08:14] believe it
[2:08:14] turn with me to Philippians chapter 2
[2:08:35] Philippians chapter 2
[2:08:45] okay now let's look at verse five in
[2:08:52] Philippians chapter 2 now I'm not
[2:08:55] reading all of this I'm just reading a
[2:08:58] couple statements because I think we
[2:09:00] need to levitate on that look at verse 5
[2:09:05] let this mind be in you remember I said
[2:09:13] how Jesus went there amongst him them
[2:09:16] Pharisees and he said to the man that
[2:09:18] says be forgiving me and they criticized
[2:09:21] him and said wait a minute only God can
[2:09:24] forgive sins jesus knew who he was so
[2:09:28] there evidently his thinking was at a
[2:09:33] different level and our thinking as to
[2:09:36] get to this level because if they let
[2:09:38] this mind be in you which was also in
[2:09:43] Christ Jesus so the same mind that Jesus
[2:09:47] had we gonna have to have notice verse 6
[2:09:52] who being in the form of God thought it
[2:09:58] not robbery to be equal with God
[2:10:10] being in the form of God thought it not
[2:10:13] robbery to be equal with God now you
[2:10:18] were made in His image - you were made
[2:10:23] in God's image right see what brother
[2:10:26] branham told say she wasn't gonna come
[2:10:27] down here and wouldn't got all clogged
[2:10:29] up with a bunch of stuff we don't
[2:10:31] realize who we are we were made in the
[2:10:35] image of God hallelujah and in Jesus
[2:10:42] recognizing who he was being in the form
[2:10:46] of God he would say he wasn't just a
[2:10:47] form of God he was God in the flesh
[2:10:49] but by understanding who he was that's
[2:10:52] why he could stand there say your sins

[2:16:02] you realize who you are them the rights
[2:16:04] that you have the god-given privileges
[2:16:05] Satan don't have one right of nothing

[2:16:10] everything
[2:16:10] he had at Calvary when Jesus Christ
[2:16:12] taking the sinners place and died at
[2:16:14] Calvary Satan has no legal right over
[2:16:16] over rights over nothing no more

[2:16:21] church and the believer that's it
[2:16:23] that's it Satan lost and then he's
[2:16:28] nothing but a bluff even death itself
[2:16:31] which we was taught last night the bee

[2:16:36] bee but it ain't got no sting he's still

[2:17:24] with this last quote out of the word
[2:17:26] became flesh a man don't think it
[2:17:31] robbery don't think it robbery God is
[2:17:34] trying to elevate our thinking you know
[2:17:37] and and you know how how hard it is to
[2:17:40] kind of preach something like this when
[2:17:42] you have to preach over the top of a lot
[2:17:44] of other stuff but but the reason I have
[2:17:46] to preach over top because I'm trying to
[2:17:47] elevate you this is this is something
[2:17:49] coming down from another dimension to
[2:17:52] pull you up
[2:17:54] because when you leave here is Gumby
[2:17:56] stuff coming from the underworld your

[2:18:56] my eyes that I would not look upon a
[2:19:01] mate that's the Bible
[2:19:04] don't say I refuse to look at a woman
[2:19:06] right that's what he said right
[2:19:09] so so you know you thought not now if I

[2:20:45] you can't watch nothing the Bible said
[2:20:47] tales tell us why anybody no description
[2:20:51] all the tables that's what I'm saying
[2:20:56] every table you sit at no matter what
[2:20:59] table you go to all the tables are full
[2:21:01] of vomit I don't know how many people
[2:21:06] will want to sit at the table that's
[2:21:08] somebody that's just vomited at oh let's
[2:21:11] just see right let's get a meal none of
[2:21:14] y'all like that you run out the
[2:21:16] restaurant but you let the devil keep
[2:21:19] shoving this stuff from the underworld
[2:21:21] all when you leave here is something in
[2:21:27] the underworld pulling you down but I'm
[2:21:30] coming here trying to pull you up cuz
[2:21:32] God don't want to living like that hey
[2:21:36] man all right I hope you can see that I
[2:21:41] gave you something to pull you up I got
[2:21:44] to talk about where you're at because
[2:21:45] you got out like brother Troy shoulders
[2:21:47] you got gates that need to be closed off
[2:21:50] amen so let me read this and I'm trying
[2:21:54] to get out leave leave leave this today
[2:21:57] when word became flesh look at this when
[2:22:00] Jesus no wonder when he came off to heal
[2:22:02] that night looked around that tree for
[2:22:04] food there was no food on the tree and
[2:22:08] he said no man Edythe from thee and he
[2:22:10] went on away in the next day coming back
[2:22:12] the tree up with her God's mind
[2:22:14] and that see this if we talk about let
[2:22:17] this mind be in you that was also in
[2:22:19] Christ okay God's mind the mind that in
[2:22:21] the beginning that was a thought before
[2:22:23] it was a word that expressed Jesus
[2:22:26] Christ the same one was expressing that
[2:22:28] word back again see as every word in the
[2:22:31] Bible is God's thoughts later see form
[2:22:33] that if received into the human being
[2:22:36] and spoke by the same up that
[2:22:38] materialized the Bible brings the thing
[2:22:41] to pass amen
[2:22:43] see what I mean how powerful could that
[2:22:46] church could the church be the Bible
[2:22:48] says let this mind that was in Christ be
[2:22:52] in you as a man thinketh in his heart so
[2:22:55] is he now your thoughts if they become
[2:22:57] expression like God said let there be a
[2:23:00] world before it could be a word it had
[2:23:02] to be a thought so God and the creation
[2:23:04] created the world by his first then
[2:23:07] spoken and the thought expressed became
[2:23:11] material see what I mean says now if
[2:23:13] that same spirit I said let there be
[2:23:14] light and there was light and said let
[2:23:18] there be trees and there was trees if
[2:23:20] that same mind that was in Christ being
[2:23:22] you how much could have stayed let there
[2:23:24] be no cancer and it would be gone now
[2:23:29] who would be speaking that it would be
[2:23:31] God and you speaking it let there be no
[2:23:34] no more cancer all right let there be no
[2:23:37] cancer and it would be gone let the
[2:23:38] blind eyes be open and it would be so
[2:23:41] see it's your thought jesus said verily
[2:23:44] he said that was Jesus but wait a minute
[2:23:46] he said have faith in God for verily
[2:23:49] verily i said if you shall say to this
[2:23:50] mountain be luke plucked up and cast
[2:23:52] into the sea and don't doubt in your
[2:23:54] heart but believe that what you say will
[2:23:56] come to pass you'll have whatever things
[2:23:58] down say us is that right you shall have
[2:24:01] it
[2:24:01] not me you shall have it what power has
[2:24:05] been given to the church I'm going on
[2:24:08] says now you can express it by mental
[2:24:10] conception but if it becomes a real
[2:24:13] revelation of God that you see it before
[2:24:16] it happened and express it in Word form
[2:24:19] that word takes our whole and becomes
[2:24:22] material and church this what I'm
[2:24:25] looking for
[2:24:25] the word
[2:24:26] whole and become material that means God
[2:24:30] knocking up what you sing amen
[2:24:32] the word takes hope becomes material I
[2:24:34] thought expressed oh how God could see
[2:24:38] if your heart and your mind is so and in
[2:24:40] filled with God's Spirit until your
[2:24:41] thoughts become its thoughts amen there
[2:24:43] you are when your mind and your leading
[2:24:45] and your guiding becomes a direct place
[2:24:47] for a direct inspiration of the Holy
[2:24:49] Spirit that's moving your mortal being
[2:24:50] no matter what kind of people should we
[2:24:53] be if the very Holy Spirit has you so
[2:24:56] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[2:24:59] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[2:25:01] mind you don't use your own opinion but
[2:25:03] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[2:25:06] your thoughts and your being is God's
[2:25:07] Spirit expressing itself through you
[2:25:09] what kind of a church would we be what
[2:25:14] kind of people would it be this morning
[2:25:17] if this brand of tabernacle Emme say if
[2:25:19] this spirit and truth tabernacle this
[2:25:21] morning was so filled with the presence
[2:25:23] of God why why when you didn't even use
[2:25:25] your own mind didn't even use your own
[2:25:28] thoughts didn't it didn't even have no
[2:25:30] alternative of your own but just to be
[2:25:33] led by the spirit and they that are the
[2:25:36] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[2:25:39] then when the human element goes out the
[2:25:42] Spirit of God feels that vacancy oh
[2:25:44] that's what we need the human element
[2:25:47] goes out the Spirit of God fills that
[2:25:49] vacancy when you enter yourself a man
[2:25:51] then will be when the church is in its
[2:25:54] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[2:25:56] Jesus will walk in his steps now how are
[2:25:58] we gonna get there we gotta empty
[2:26:00] ourselves say brother brother Troy made
[2:26:02] a statement it says you know when they
[2:26:05] were all when they were in the upper
[2:26:06] room the Bible said when they were in
[2:26:07] upper room they were all in one mind in
[2:26:09] one Accord in one place one mind one
[2:26:13] Accord say now being in the upper room
[2:26:16] actually they were in one place but why
[2:26:20] would the scriptures say that they were
[2:26:22] in one place if they were in the upper
[2:26:24] room is it because the it wasn't just
[2:26:26] where they were sitting
[2:26:27] see right now we're in one place we're
[2:26:30] in spirit and truth tabernacle but some
[2:26:32] of us our minds are all over the place
[2:26:34] but when we get into that heavenly
[2:26:37] atmosphere that room every
[2:26:39] about to get their church we don't see
[2:26:41] some great things in this place praying
[2:26:44] will be different fasting will be
[2:26:46] different living will be different if we
[2:26:49] can get everybody to that place I mean
[2:26:51] if we just if we just some somehow just
[2:26:55] everybody just took a Saturday and just
[2:26:58] ain't doing nothing but getting in the
[2:26:59] word I'm not I'm not I'm not if I got to
[2:27:04] do it if you got to go to work with
[2:27:06] understand that but if you can get to a
[2:27:07] place like you know I ain't gonna do
[2:27:08] nothing they for just stay in the word
[2:27:10] i'ma listen to tapes
[2:27:12] i'ma read my Bible right I'm gonna just
[2:27:15] stand the word and I'm gonna just get my
[2:27:16] mind in a place where I can get ready to
[2:27:18] receive from God the service would be
[2:27:21] different the service would be if people
[2:27:25] came to church with that type of
[2:27:27] approach I guarantee the service would
[2:27:30] go different hey man
[2:27:34] hallelujah Church it's hard to get him
[2:27:37] one of mine it's hard to get him one of
[2:27:39] court one place that's what it took them
[2:27:41] 10 days to empty themselves out ten
[2:27:45] whole days to get empty for us it might
[2:27:49] take a lot longer but if we get sincere
[2:27:52] about this thing church I talked about
[2:27:56] we going to another level God is trying
[2:27:58] to raise us up overcome the things of
[2:28:01] the world right we don't that we don't
[2:28:03] need to no longer be subject to the
[2:28:05] things of this world we we I mean that
[2:28:07] damn number the devil trying to pull us
[2:28:10] down we already we don't come down to
[2:28:12] fun I come from God down through them
[2:28:16] channels to get down to this earth this
[2:28:19] realm right to be tempted and tested
[2:28:21] that's what I'm here for right but what
[2:28:24] the devil trying to do is pull me down
[2:28:26] further and I'm telling the devil no I
[2:28:29] ain't going there I'm going back where I
[2:28:32] come from I come from God I'm going back
[2:28:35] to God amen and if I'm gonna go down I
[2:28:37] gotta fight to get there let me finish
[2:28:39] this it tells us this when you empty
[2:28:43] yourself then we'll we then will be when
[2:28:48] the church is in its power of the
[2:28:51] resurrection of the Lord Jesus well
[2:28:52] the steps in his power and his thoughts
[2:28:54] and his being and is moving you see what
[2:28:56] I mean then your thoughts will become
[2:28:57] worse and words will become material
[2:29:00] that's when the church in its power I
[2:29:04] believe it's on it's on it's on its Road
[2:29:06] and when the church would be so wrapped
[2:29:08] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind's soul
[2:29:10] away from themselves that they don't see
[2:29:13] themselves they don't have a man no
[2:29:15] thoughts but to serve God I love that
[2:29:18] you don't have any other thoughts but to
[2:29:20] serve God and their thoughts move on
[2:29:22] they refuse the things of the world they
[2:29:27] refuse it not not the pastor just tell
[2:29:30] them he's got to stop this you guys when
[2:29:32] you get to the spot where you are
[2:29:33] refusing it you know you have made some
[2:29:36] progress they refuse you turn off your
[2:29:42] TV right you you you you you shut down
[2:29:46] that Facebook page you shut down that
[2:29:48] you know Instagram what you do it on
[2:29:50] your own they refuse you know Moses had
[2:29:54] to come to that Moses refused to be
[2:29:56] called one of the children of Israel
[2:29:59] Egypt he refused to be identified with
[2:30:01] them he want to be he want to be
[2:30:03] identified with the mud daubers he came
[2:30:08] to that on his own and God used them
[2:30:10] they refused the things of the world
[2:30:12] they just move in the spirit living the
[2:30:14] spirit moving the spirit walking the
[2:30:16] spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then
[2:30:19] the love of Christ in the human heart
[2:30:22] moving in the Holy Ghost that great
[2:30:25] wonderful church would go forth with
[2:30:27] power and dignity because deity will be
[2:30:33] revealed in human beings and I'm so glad
[2:30:42] that I can sing I'm one of them deity
[2:30:47] will be revealed to human beings by the
[2:30:49] Holy Spirit
[2:30:50] bringing to pass the thought of their
[2:30:55] mind co-equal
[2:31:01] with Jesus that's who you are I believe
[2:31:12] it I believe it
[2:31:15] let's pray Lord Jesus your word is true
[2:31:28] your word is real your word is all that
[2:31:34] we have God stains that the Prophet
[2:31:44] preached back in the 50s and 60s and
[2:31:46] Lord it was maybe it was so rich that
[2:31:51] people had no idea what he was saying
[2:31:53] and it's taken us roughly 50 60 years to
[2:31:57] even catch up with what he was saying
[2:32:00] our minds trying to grasp this trying to
[2:32:06] understand this trying to wrap itself
[2:32:09] around this it's taking us quite some
[2:32:12] time he told us that a eagle can go a
[2:32:15] long time in the chicken coop
[2:32:17] not recognizing that it's an eagle but
[2:32:21] this revelation god that's being brought
[2:32:24] this this the subject of adoption is
[2:32:27] coming from so many different angles
[2:32:28] Lord it's you you said today that it's
[2:32:31] it's to the Eagles the sheep will hear
[2:32:34] the voice is this is to the Eagles they
[2:32:36] would catch this and Lord as they catch
[2:32:39] it they begin to manifest it help us
[2:32:41] Lord to to have our conversation around
[2:32:44] these things around these topics Lord
[2:32:47] that that as we talk about it you would
[2:32:49] draw nigh let's draw closer to us father
[2:32:53] we need you we need you now more than
[2:32:56] ever before we're living amen at a time
[2:32:58] and we're gonna need the power of God
[2:33:00] and in a way that we've never have seen
[2:33:02] it before
[2:33:03] and these things that we're reading here
[2:33:05] these seas that we're storing in this
[2:33:06] church this is what we're expecting God
[2:33:08] give the people power to overcome the
[2:33:11] devil all of us are fighting
[2:33:13] something but give us power to overcome
[2:33:15] the enemy in our lives that we might not
[2:33:18] continue to make the same mistakes over
[2:33:21] and over and over again but give us
[2:33:23] revelation father we can do things
[2:33:27] because pastors that do it or because
[2:33:30] daddy said do it or mama said do it but
[2:33:33] God if that thing is not a revelation on
[2:33:34] the inside of us then as soon as we get
[2:33:36] out of their presence we're gonna go
[2:33:38] right back to doing what we wanted to do
[2:33:40] but God I pray to do it strip us of
[2:33:42] ourselves that you O God would help us
[2:33:45] to realize how much we need you and that
[2:33:48] we would find life so satisfying because
[2:33:51] we're serving you God let that be our
[2:33:55] testimony you do the things in our heart
[2:33:59] that only you can do we we lay ourselves
[2:34:04] before you our hearts are open before

[2:39:41] you know there there are many things
[2:39:44] that brother Jack says it seems to come
[2:39:47] back to you at the right time you know
[2:39:51] he he made a statement I guess a few
[2:39:53] weeks ago maybe even last week yes she
[2:39:55] was that when people bump into us he
[2:39:59] bump into the attorney and that's true
[2:40:04] there were two different things that
[2:40:06] that happened the day my uncle my uncle
[2:40:12] passed on my way there I contacted
[2:40:19] brother Jack I actually text him he
[2:40:21] called me back in then I sent a message
[2:40:23] to the brother's name they began to pray
[2:40:25] and as I was going over there you know
[2:40:28] after the the meetings that were going
[2:40:31] through and after that a different
[2:40:33] preaching that brother Jack has been
[2:40:34] doing about the manifestation of the
[2:40:36] sons of God I went over to I was ready
[2:40:38] to see some things changed I went over
[2:40:41] there to see my uncle either raised up
[2:40:43] while I was gonna stand there - I saw
[2:40:45] the Lord take him away
[2:40:46] so when I walked into the house you know
[2:40:50] they had to solve gospel music playing
[2:40:51] and my family they were sitting out out
[2:40:55] front
[2:40:56] and in the room was my my uncle and his
[2:40:58] wife
[2:41:00] so I went over to him she gave me a hug
[2:41:03] I went on I tore my hands on his
[2:41:05] shoulder and he's lying and I'm looking
[2:41:08] at him in his eyes rolled back in the
[2:41:11] back of his head and he's trying to
[2:41:12] catch his breath that's what he's doing
[2:41:16] so I put my hands on his shoulder and I
[2:41:19] begin to pray for them and I knew as a
[2:41:23] son God God heard my prayers I said Lord
[2:41:27] my main thing in my main concern for
[2:41:29] being here I said my uncle comes goes to
[2:41:33] meet you with one Centon I want nothing
[2:41:37] between you and him but the blood of
[2:41:38] Jesus Christ so I'm asking that you
[2:41:40] forgive them of the sins I began to pray
[2:41:42] for man I didn't think about what
[2:41:44] happened to I told my wife so I was
[2:41:47] praying for the salvation everything
[2:41:49] he's a Christian everything so I just
[2:41:51] wanted everything clean while he crossed
[2:41:54] that River
[2:41:55] so after that I began to pray for us
[2:41:59] here
[2:41:59] and I had my hands on his shoulder I
[2:42:02] said Lord now I want you to touch his
[2:42:04] body he did like that so in my mind I
[2:42:09] was like man why did he do that and I
[2:42:11] just kept on praying so I told my wife
[2:42:13] about it and she said do you think he
[2:42:16] recognized you as a son God knew if you
[2:42:18] ask God that God would heal me he didn't
[2:42:21] want to come back
[2:42:24] I never thought about that then another
[2:42:28] instance came to my mind a little later
[2:42:30] and the day when my aunt and her husband
[2:42:35] came in the room and their daughter and
[2:42:38] they was standing by the bed I backed up
[2:42:40] so that they could say goodbye and his
[2:42:43] wife was standing by them then my aunt
[2:42:45] she's a woman preacher then my uncle and
[2:42:48] then so my aunt she began to pray for
[2:42:50] him and everything and she prayed the
[2:42:54] Spirit of God is encamped about those
[2:42:56] that fear so when she finished his wife
[2:43:00] said Jessie if you see a angel this room
[2:43:03] because the angels of God are care about
[2:43:05] those that fear you let us know will you
[2:43:09] let us know and as he was standing with
[2:43:12] eyes laying like this rolled back in the
[2:43:15] back
[2:43:19] [Music]
[2:43:22] he fixed his eyes on me and I said Lord
[2:43:34] he did recognize something he knew that
[2:43:38] you learned this room and brother
[2:43:41] branham said when they get ready to
[2:43:42] cross over they break into the other
[2:43:43] dimension they see those things and he
[2:43:45] could recognize the Son of God for
[2:43:47] standing there so we we have come to a
[2:43:51] place but we all must recognize that we
[2:43:54] are sons and daughters of God and when
[2:43:56] we ask things change things changed they
[2:44:01] have to because God called us to that
[2:44:04] position he wants to step back and see
[2:44:07] his children go for it me being that
[2:44:09] every every father wants to see his son
[2:44:12] grow up and be a strong man you want to
[2:44:15] step back that's my son that's my
[2:44:18] daughter that's what God wants to see go
[2:44:29] ahead and pray
[2:44:31] well dismiss Heavenly Father How Great
[2:44:35] Thou art father we thank you so much
[2:44:40] Lord God for what we've been hearing
[2:44:43] Lord father and we know that it's timely
[2:44:47] because the coming of the Lord is at
[2:44:49] hand
[2:44:50] father we see the world in the position
[2:44:53] as it was in the days of sorrow but
[2:44:56] before that time comes Lord that you
[2:44:58] ought to destroy this world your sons
[2:45:00] and daughters must all be manifested
[2:45:03] here upon the earth my father you have
[2:45:05] bring in messages over and over and over
[2:45:08] again to wake us up to get us out of
