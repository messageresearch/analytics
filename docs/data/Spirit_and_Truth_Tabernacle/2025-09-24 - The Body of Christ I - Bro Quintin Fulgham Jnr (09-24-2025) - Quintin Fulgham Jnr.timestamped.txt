[7:26] not a god in need of
[7:31] anything we can give and by your plan.

[12:51] musicians could play real real softly as
[12:53] we um we go before the Lord in a word of
[12:55] prayer uh before we start the evening.
[12:59] Oh precious Lord God, we come before you
[13:01] oh Lord God and we want to thank you oh
[13:04] Lord God for this opportunity oh Lord
[13:06] Jesus Christ to come before your feet to
[13:08] worship you oh Lord God. Lord we know
[13:11] that you are indeed worthy oh Lord God
[13:14] and you are the lamb oh Lord Jesus
[13:16] Christ. You are the one, oh Lord God,
[13:18] who was fore orained before the world,
[13:20] the foundation of the world, oh Lord
[13:22] God, to be our savior, to be our
[13:24] deliverer, to be our healers, to be our
[13:28] provider, oh Lord God, to be our
[13:29] protector, oh Lord God. And Lord,
[13:32] because of this, oh Lord God, you've
[13:34] sent to us in this hour, oh Lord, a
[13:36] message, oh Lord God, that caught on to
[13:38] our heart, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[13:41] there are millions upon, maybe billions
[13:43] in the world, oh Lord, that call
[13:44] themselves Christians, oh Lord God, and
[13:47] they pray to you and they cry out to
[13:49] you, oh Lord God. But Lord, I I like to
[13:52] think, oh Lord God, not to be uh just to
[13:54] kind of stay humble about it. When we
[13:57] say something, oh Lord God, it does
[13:59] something a little bit different for
[14:00] you, oh Lord God, when you hear our
[14:02] voice, oh Lord God, when you hear our
[14:05] prayers, oh Lord Jesus Christ, oh Lord,
[14:07] Lord, when you see us crying out in
[14:09] distress and worry, oh Lord God, when
[14:12] you hear that sound of our voice, our
[14:14] personal voice, oh Lord God, I believe,
[14:17] oh Lord God, it does something greater,
[14:19] oh Lord God, than all of the other cries
[14:21] in the world, oh Lord God. Oh Lord, and
[14:24] this is because you fashioned us like
[14:26] yourself, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Oh Lord,
[14:29] we're crying out with your voice, oh
[14:31] Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord, your word
[14:34] is the only thing that you respect, oh
[14:36] Lord Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, we thank
[14:38] you, oh Lord God. Lord, you've answered
[14:41] our prayer. You've you you've answered
[14:43] our needs, oh Lord God, before the
[14:45] battle even started, oh Lord Jesus
[14:47] Christ. Lord, a lot of us, oh Lord, can
[14:49] look back in our lives, oh Lord God, and
[14:51] we can see how far you've brought us, oh
[14:54] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, some of us were
[14:56] in the muck. Oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[14:59] some of us were rebellious. Oh Lord
[15:01] Jesus Christ, some of us didn't even
[15:03] want nothing to do with church. Oh Lord
[15:06] Jesus Christ, but because of your love,
[15:08] oh Lord Jesus Christ, because of your
[15:11] mercy, oh Lord God, because of your
[15:13] favor, oh Lord God, Lord, you picked us
[15:16] up, oh Lord God, and not only did you
[15:18] pick us up, oh Lord God, you forgave all
[15:20] of our sins and you cleansed us, oh Lord
[15:23] God. And not only did you just forgive
[15:25] our sins and clean us, cleanse us, oh
[15:26] Lord God, but Lord, you said that we
[15:29] would be the apple of your eye, oh Lord
[15:30] God, we would deserve a spot, oh Lord,
[15:33] in heaven right next to you, oh Lord
[15:35] God. So Lord, we just thank you for this
[15:37] favor that you've given us, oh Lord God.
[15:39] Touch the people, oh Lord God. Lord, you
[15:41] see the needs on their heart, oh Lord
[15:43] God. But Lord, we know you already have
[15:45] the answer, oh Lord God. Oh Lord, the
[15:47] salvation question, oh Lord, it was
[15:49] answered before uh uh Adam took one step
[15:52] on the on the earth. Oh Lord Jesus
[15:55] Christ. So now Lord, we can stand with
[15:57] confidence knowing that before we get
[15:59] into something, oh Lord, the answer has
[16:01] already been there. It's already there.
[16:03] Oh Lord God, Lord, help us just to
[16:05] praise you. Oh Lord God, no matter how
[16:07] tough it gets, oh Lord God, you are a
[16:10] worthy God, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, let
[16:13] nothing but praise and worship come
[16:14] through our lips, oh Lord God, for you
[16:16] truly and deeply deserve all, oh Lord
[16:18] God, and we ask it in the precious name
[16:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So we will get right into
[16:27] the word. Thank you, magicians. Um so
[16:30] before you take your seats, we're going
[16:32] to do our um our scripture reading out
[16:34] of Revelation
[16:36] uh 19 uh7. And just say amen once you
[16:39] get there. All
[16:53] right. And it reads, "Let us be glad and
[16:57] rejoice." Uh, and I like that because
[16:59] it's God telling us that, yeah, no
[17:02] matter how we're feeling, no matter what
[17:03] we're going through, we might be sad, we
[17:05] might be uh have a low countenance, but
[17:09] uh God here can give us the words for us
[17:11] to be glad and to rejoice. Right? And it
[17:14] says, "And give honor to him for the
[17:16] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[17:18] wife hath made herself ready." And may
[17:21] the Lord add a blessing to his word as
[17:23] you may be seated.
[17:25] Uh so the title of my message if uh if
[17:28] you could pull up the slides uh created
[17:31] some slides for us to go through. The
[17:33] title of the message the Lord gave me
[17:34] was the body of Christ with a subtitle
[17:37] of positioned for a rapture.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; All right. And so we're going to go back
[17:42] uh to the vision that we uh the quote
[17:46] that we did before in the previous
[17:48] message. We talked I talked about the
[17:50] true church of God and we went through
[17:52] the uh the prophecy that was fulfilled.
[17:53] We're going to go through back. We're
[17:55] going to go back onto that. It's uh
[17:56] preach. It's the acts of the Holy Spirit
[17:58] preached in 54, paragraph uh 87. We're
[18:01] just going to read a little bit of it.
[18:03] We won't read the whole entire thing. Um
[18:08] and I'll just start reading it. And it
[18:10] says go, you can go and we're going to
[18:12] go all the way down to the uh sentence
[18:14] that starts with and and I tell you. And
[18:16] I'll just start reading it. And it says,
[18:17] "And I tell you that the true church of
[18:19] God will be drove together, the real
[18:22] true believers." Right? So God God knows
[18:25] that these people are are are real
[18:27] believers. They believe the word of God.
[18:29] They believe every word. And notice
[18:31] where they're coming from. Out of
[18:33] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[18:35] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[18:37] Holiness, whatever they'll be, will be
[18:39] together and cemented by the love of
[18:42] God. And this is the statement we want
[18:44] to focus on. that'll make the body of
[18:46] the Lord Jesus Christ. All the
[18:49] believers, right? All the believers will
[18:52] make up the body of God. And so I
[18:55] remember before we talked about we had a
[18:57] lesson on the spiritual gifts in the
[18:59] church. If you remember me uh teaching
[19:01] about that uh emphasizing how the the
[19:04] gifts uh the gifts in the church do make
[19:06] up the body. But now we want to place an
[19:08] emphasis on a rapturing body. All right?
[19:11] not just a body doing a service on a
[19:13] work uh on the on the earth. So, you
[19:15] know, we have there's many singers,
[19:17] great singers out there. You have great
[19:19] ministers out there. You have saints
[19:20] with gifts of healing and great gifts of
[19:22] faith. Uh all of these great gifts. But
[19:25] if they don't have the light of their
[19:27] day, right? If they don't have the word
[19:30] that has been revealed in this end time,
[19:33] uh it means that they are a sleeping
[19:35] virgin, right? Meaning that they will
[19:38] miss a rapture. They won't make a
[19:39] rapture, right? So we have to go beyond
[19:42] just the gifts. Amen. Uh Paul said, "If
[19:45] I have if I if I don't have love, right,
[19:48] but all the gifts, it profit profitth me
[19:50] nothing." Right? Uh Paul taught us that
[19:53] thing, which is why the um the rapture
[19:56] couldn't come in the Pentecostal age,
[19:58] right? Even though it was a great age,
[20:00] uh the Pentecostal age, if you if you
[20:02] read what happened there, it brought
[20:04] people from all races together that
[20:06] normally hated each other, right? So it
[20:08] was a big movement. and the gifts were
[20:09] pouring out, but it still didn't bring a
[20:12] rapture. Right? With all of that
[20:14] togetherness, with all of that love and
[20:16] that uh they had together in that uh in
[20:18] that gathering, it still did not produce
[20:20] a rapture,
[20:22] &gt;&gt; right? Um so we can say that they were
[20:26] still living in shadows, right? And you
[20:29] can't make a rapture living in the
[20:31] shadows. Uh and I like how the uh the
[20:34] prophet talked about or the Bible talks
[20:36] about the foolish virgins and the
[20:39] 144,000. How when at during the
[20:42] tribulation when they're being killed
[20:44] off for their faith, they'll call out to
[20:46] God, right, to avenge their blood.
[20:48] They'll call out to God to judge for
[20:50] what the people have done for them. And
[20:52] if you and the prophet said that that
[20:54] showed that they were not bribe
[20:56] material, they were very, very good
[20:58] people, right? They had gifts flowing
[21:01] and everything, but when it came time to
[21:03] forgive their enemy, there something
[21:05] they could not do,
[21:07] &gt;&gt; right? But the bride when we look to
[21:09] contrast to the bride when the bride is
[21:11] persecuted right she says Lord forgive
[21:14] them for they know not what they do
[21:16] right showing that she is a spitting
[21:18] image of Christ himself right so the
[21:22] body has to be positioned a certain way
[21:24] in order to make a rapture it won't just
[21:26] be anybody and I like to think about it
[21:29] this way how you know if you were if
[21:30] let's say we had a football game and
[21:33] someone had wrote up a play right and
[21:35] they wanted you to be at a certain point
[21:37] at at a certain time in order for the
[21:38] ball to get to your hand. And if you
[21:41] follow through with a play and you make
[21:43] the catch and you score, you know, you
[21:45] get all the glory. And that's kind of
[21:47] like how the rapture is. God is looking
[21:49] for a particular person to be at a
[21:51] particular position at a particular time
[21:53] so that they'll be caught away, right?
[21:55] And if you don't, if let's say if you
[21:57] were going onto this route and you
[21:59] missed it, right? Well, then you don't
[22:01] get the glory, right? And you're going
[22:04] to have opposition, right? You'll always
[22:06] have opposition, but that's why God said
[22:08] to he that overcomemeth will he grant.
[22:11] So you have to fight your way into your
[22:14] position, right? Getting to the rapture
[22:16] will not be a easy thing. When Christ
[22:18] was getting to his rapture, he had to go
[22:21] through a cross which meant he had to
[22:23] fight. But instead of using his words in
[22:25] his hands, he was fighting with love.
[22:28] Right? So that's how we have to be too.
[22:30] Now, man has their own ideas how, you
[22:33] know, the rapture should be. You know,
[22:36] we've had this big thing that came up
[22:37] where everybody thought the rapture was
[22:39] happening yesterday. It was all over Tik
[22:41] Tok and stuff. So, everybody got their
[22:44] idea about what when the rapture is
[22:46] going to happen and what time is it
[22:48] going to be and everybody's looking for
[22:49] it and you know, we're still here right
[22:51] now. So, you're right. So, man has their
[22:54] own ideas about these things, but we
[22:56] want God's ideas, right? So, if you
[22:58] could pull up, I believe it's the third
[23:00] slide with the um the slide with the
[23:02] umbrellas right there. All right. So,
[23:06] you've probably seen these images shared
[23:08] on social media, and I really do like
[23:11] them. I like Well, I like this one here.
[23:12] The first one by Bill Gother. Uh this is
[23:15] a de denominational preacher, and he
[23:18] has, you know, the biblical order of the
[23:21] family where we see Christ, husband,
[23:23] wife, and children. And I like that
[23:25] because that is uh that does uh we find
[23:27] that in the Bible as um you know Paul uh
[23:31] talked about how these things should be
[23:32] ordered. But then there were this there
[23:34] was there's this group of people that
[23:36] didn't appreciate that structure and
[23:38] they said that it uh with the husband on
[23:40] top it it it it uh it um gave into the
[23:44] patriarchy and stuff like that. So they
[23:47] decided to come up with their own image
[23:48] right here on the um on the right of
[23:51] this thing, right? And so has Christ.
[23:53] And so you see the pastor, the daughter,
[23:55] the husband, the wife, the son, the
[23:57] neighbor, and they're all on the same
[23:59] level and they threw a little scripture
[24:01] under there. And you know, you have to
[24:03] be careful about when people throw give
[24:05] you try to give you interpret try to
[24:07] give you interpretations and then throw
[24:09] a scripture at you.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was tempted by Satan, he gave
[24:14] him the scripture.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; So you have to be able to pierce through
[24:18] these things to see, okay, what is your
[24:21] intention behind these things? And a lot
[24:23] of these people were attacking how the
[24:25] husband was in a certain position,
[24:28] right? And so we're going to kind of go
[24:29] through this thing because I do like
[24:31] this one left by Bill Gother, but like I
[24:34] said, he was a denominational preacher.
[24:36] So if you take this structure to the
[24:37] Catholic church, you'll get a Catholic
[24:39] revelation with it. If you take it to a
[24:42] Baptist church, you'll get a Baptist
[24:43] revelation with it. But I believe that
[24:45] I'm sitting here with the pleasure to
[24:47] talk to some eagles that don't have a
[24:49] denominational stand, but they have been
[24:51] revealed the message. So we want to take
[24:53] this thing and kind of maybe elevate it,
[24:56] right, to uh show the revelation that we
[24:59] have uh today. Um and so if you could
[25:03] turn to the next slide
[25:06] uh in the next one, not this one. Right.
[25:08] So here we go. This is the slide I was
[25:10] inspired to come up with that is and
[25:12] it's probably a little bit hard for you
[25:13] to read, but I'll go through and read
[25:14] it. Uh uh here's a here's something
[25:16] called I I call it the body of Christ.
[25:19] And at the top you'll see it's Jesus
[25:20] Christ. And the next uh next diagram
[25:24] down you'll see it's trust. We'll get to
[25:26] what that means. And then below that we
[25:28] have major prophets, right? And then
[25:31] below the major prophets we have the
[25:32] five-fold ministry. And then below the
[25:34] five-fold ministry we have men. And then
[25:36] below below the men we have women. And
[25:38] below the women, we have children.
[25:40] Right? So, this is a little bit more
[25:42] different because I wanted to
[25:43] incorporate well, yes, we want a family
[25:46] structure under Christ, but we want
[25:47] something tailored that can help us see
[25:49] the light for our day. And you cannot
[25:52] have a light for your day without a
[25:53] major prophet being over all of these
[25:55] things in a closest position to Christ.
[25:58] Right? So, this diagram is actually a
[26:01] spiritual diagram. Uh because Paul said,
[26:05] "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[26:07] So that's why you have Christ and then
[26:09] you have the major prophets. And then
[26:11] Paul said the five-fold ministry was
[26:13] given for the perfecting of the saints.
[26:16] So saints, you can't perfect yourself. A
[26:19] saint cannot perfect himself. Right? The
[26:22] scripture says so. And if a saint cannot
[26:24] perfect themselves, how can you make a
[26:26] rapture?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; All right?
[26:28] &gt;&gt; God is looking for a perfect body. And
[26:30] we're going to get to that a little bit
[26:32] uh a little bit later. how important
[26:34] perfection uh perfection is. And then
[26:37] Paul of course said you know husbands
[26:39] love your wives and wife wives submit to
[26:41] your husbands. And then uh we also have
[26:44] here where the children are under the
[26:46] men and women as you know children obey
[26:48] your parents right. So um and I just
[26:51] kind of want to take a pause here
[26:52] because um you know uh when we talk
[26:56] about the rapture a lot it tends I feel
[26:58] like it tends to be aimed at a lot of
[27:00] older people right um but you know you
[27:03] kids and children you guys can make a
[27:05] rapture too
[27:07] &gt;&gt; right? So a lot of times we know we talk
[27:09] about you know when the rapture happens
[27:11] you'll get a body change from old to
[27:13] young but you know you kids that are
[27:16] outside of that 18 to 21 year old range
[27:18] you'll get a body change from young
[27:21] younger to young right so when brother
[27:24] Brandham his baby daughter her name was
[27:27] Sharon Rose when she died he saw her as
[27:29] a baby but when God granted him a vision
[27:31] to go up in heaven and this this young
[27:34] lady came up to him it's like who is
[27:36] this right?
[27:37] &gt;&gt; 18-year-old, 20-year-old looking woman
[27:39] and it was his little baby girl, right?
[27:42] So, she got a body change going up.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; So, you you young young people don't
[27:48] think that you you can't receive
[27:50] revelation. The rapture is for a
[27:52] predestinated seed. It has nothing to do
[27:55] with age. It has to has all to do with
[27:57] who God's name put in the lamb's book of
[27:59] life. So that means that, you know, if
[28:02] all the adults in the world catch
[28:04] revelation that they're the bride, but
[28:06] there's this 15-year-old girl in South
[28:08] America that has not caught revelation,
[28:10] but her name is on the book. Until she
[28:13] knows who she is, the rapture will not
[28:15] happen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; She may think she's 15 and
[28:18] insignificant, but until she catches
[28:20] revelation because her name is there,
[28:22] the rapture will not uh uh will take
[28:24] off. So, we need children to know they
[28:26] have position two. Don't think that just
[28:28] because, you know, people are talking
[28:29] down to me or I gotta obey my parents.
[28:32] No, we want to prepare you for a rapture
[28:34] as well, right? God won't rapture a
[28:37] disobedient child. You can't when if if
[28:41] the rapture comes and God comes on earth
[28:43] and he sees that a child has a
[28:44] disobedient spirit, I can't see God
[28:46] rapturing somebody like that, right?
[28:48] He's calling us out of all of these all
[28:51] of these things, right?
[28:53] So, I like this diagram, you know,
[28:54] because it's uh it's it's it's helping
[28:56] to prepare the uh the church for a
[28:58] rapture and and I like it too because
[29:01] did you know that families can also be
[29:05] raptured, right? Even though it's an
[29:07] individual walk, it is true families can
[29:09] be raptured. So, if you could turn to
[29:11] the message uh thy house preached in 61,
[29:14] we're going to read paragraphs uh 13 113
[29:17] and then 113 through 118.
[29:22] All
[29:26] right. So, paragraph 113. This is uh
[29:28] brother talking to brother Brandham.
[29:30] Brother Brandham's like, "All right,
[29:31] Jimmy, have you got them, my boy?"
[29:34] Brother Jimmy Evans reads the question
[29:36] for brother Brandham. And this is the
[29:37] question. When the rapture takes place,
[29:40] will all believers, families, wives, and
[29:42] children go? They are in faith and trust
[29:45] in Jesus Christ as Lord. and one
[29:48] paragraph 114 brother Brandham says yes
[29:51] yes will all the family go in the
[29:53] rapture see yes see uh now if you notice
[29:57] the rapture is going to be a universal
[30:00] thing so wouldn't that be a lovely thing
[30:04] that you know you are you have prepared
[30:06] yourself for a rapture and as and then
[30:09] when when the rapture begins to take
[30:11] place it's not only you just going but
[30:13] all your family that is with you was
[30:15] going uh to the marriage supper as well,
[30:18] right? Can you imagine brother Maris
[30:20] just being raptured up and then when he
[30:22] as he's going up and being translated,
[30:24] he sees his wife and every single one of
[30:26] his kids going with him to the marriage
[30:29] supper. Wouldn't that be a lovely thing?
[30:31] A lot of times we tend to think about
[30:33] the rapture, it is an individual walk,
[30:35] but that would be such a blessing that
[30:37] if you were to be raptured and every
[30:39] single one of your loved ones was going
[30:41] up in the sky with you as well.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; We have these kind of faith, right? We
[30:46] have this kind of word that the prophet
[30:48] has given us. Now reading in uh verses
[30:50] 116 through 117 he says now we was
[30:53] talking talking today the brethren you
[30:55] say well brother Brandham if you believe
[30:56] the rapture is that close and why why do
[30:58] you go fishing if I put my mind to it
[31:00] constantly it would almost run you wild
[31:02] when you think of the tens of thousands
[31:04] of people out here in sin that don't
[31:05] know Christ and think that here I am
[31:07] what can I do but here's what here's
[31:09] what I think I cannot save one unless
[31:11] God has called them. See, I can't do it
[31:13] &gt;&gt; and I couldn't say them anyhow. But all
[31:16] the father has given me will come to me.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; So he don't tell me where to go. Then
[31:21] what can I do? You see, and I want to
[31:23] give you encouragement because you may
[31:25] have loved ones that are out there, but
[31:27] if God wrote their name on the book, you
[31:30] don't have to be worrying. A lot of
[31:31] times people that you might be praying
[31:33] every single day and you're stressed out
[31:35] and you're Lord, when are they coming
[31:37] in? Lord, when are they coming in? Don't
[31:39] do that, right? Just get up, eat you a
[31:42] nice big breakfast, go on your day
[31:44] smiling. If God wrote their name on the
[31:46] book, when you rise up, they will rise
[31:49] up too with you wherever they are.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; When we thank God uh uh for these pre
[31:56] these precious promises uh that he has
[31:58] given us, right? So that's why so that's
[32:00] why I like this diagram because it
[32:02] places emphasis on, you know, I want to
[32:05] we want to get people we want to get the
[32:08] family ready for a rapture. We want to
[32:09] that if if God could give us the faith,
[32:11] we want all of our loved ones to make
[32:13] it. So, we have to have something
[32:14] different than what the world has,
[32:16] &gt;&gt; right? So, in order to truly understand
[32:20] uh this positioning and to gain uh more
[32:23] of appreciation uh for it, we have to go
[32:26] way back into the beginning to pick up
[32:28] on some of the things that God showed us
[32:29] in scripture. And it's good to see how
[32:32] God has how God did things through
[32:35] history because it allows us to have
[32:36] more appreciation and to thank him, you
[32:39] know, for what he's done because when
[32:41] you think about the um the first age
[32:44] saints and it was a time of life, a time
[32:47] of so much light, but they all had to
[32:49] give up their life for Christ. They had
[32:51] to go through some gruesome deaths. But
[32:53] here we are in an age where we have a
[32:55] life where we can just bypass death. So
[32:58] we don't have to die for Christ. So it's
[33:00] it's it's it's good to see how God done
[33:03] done things uh in the past and how he's
[33:05] doing things now just to give us more of
[33:07] a appreciation. And we also want to est
[33:10] want to see how he established and why
[33:11] he established these things before we
[33:13] elaborate on each of the roles. So we're
[33:16] going to go to the next slide right and
[33:20] this is going to be a slide where we
[33:22] have just um Jesus and Adam and this was
[33:25] the original position right. So when God
[33:28] created the garden, it was just Jesus
[33:30] and Adam, right? There was no real
[33:32] positioning because Adam was the direct
[33:35] spoken word of God, right? He had every
[33:37] single authority that God had, right? So
[33:40] then after the creation of Adam's wife,
[33:43] if we go to the next slide, uh we're
[33:45] going to see, and you don't ignore those
[33:47] little arrows. It's supposed to be like
[33:49] a little circle going around, but now we
[33:51] see Jesus Christ, Adam, and Adam's wife.
[33:54] And you'll notice how we have those
[33:55] words uh trust and faith uh on the side.
[33:59] Uh they were living in a perfect faith.
[34:02] They were living in a perfect trust. It
[34:04] was implicit meaning they didn't have to
[34:06] um they didn't have to put any effort in
[34:08] order to build their faith. So when we
[34:10] come to church, you know, we'll have the
[34:11] song leader will come up. And what he's
[34:13] trying to do is he's trying to he's
[34:14] trying to encourage your faith. He's
[34:16] trying to lift up your faith. He's
[34:17] trying to build your faith in Christ.
[34:18] He's trying to build your trust in
[34:20] Christ so when the word comes forth, you
[34:22] can have faith. But they didn't have any
[34:24] of that in the garden. It was just so
[34:26] implicit, right? It was so natural,
[34:29] right? Um but then we have the fall. So
[34:32] if we can turn to the next slide here.
[34:35] Um and this is after the fall, right? So
[34:39] here we still have Jesus uh trust. Here
[34:42] we have Jesus uh protecting his family.
[34:45] But now notice trust is in his own
[34:47] circle, right? So that shows that now
[34:50] the trust has been broken. Right? Now
[34:52] man has broke the trust and God can't
[34:55] trust him like he did before. Right? So
[34:58] now we have this circle of trust that's
[35:00] been placed around them. Right? And uh
[35:03] um and it's going to help us to
[35:04] illustrate and give give more clarity to
[35:06] how we look at these different positions
[35:08] that uh that we'll see. Uh and trust uh
[35:12] if you know trust is a two-way street.
[35:15] So God isn't only wanting us to trust in
[35:17] him but God wants to have trust in you.
[35:20] God wants to be able to give a word to
[35:22] you or God wants to be able you for you
[35:24] to go out into a certain situation
[35:26] without praying and he wants to see how
[35:28] you're just going to naturally handle it
[35:30] because he wants to trust that the seed
[35:32] he placed on inside of you would just
[35:34] take fruition right so now we see this
[35:38] this uh the structure that we have here
[35:40] and we see that Eve she fell right she
[35:43] fell fell fell right but Adam fell a
[35:47] little bit right So even though both of
[35:51] them fell, God had more trust in Adam
[35:54] than he did with Eve, right? And we'll
[35:56] get to that a little bit uh later on
[35:58] because it's important to understand uh
[36:00] these uh these positioning roles. And so
[36:04] one of the things is I don't know who
[36:06] the first prophet in the Bible was. Um I
[36:09] looked I was looking I was reading an
[36:10] interesting verse that talked about Abel
[36:12] and stuff, but I couldn't see anything
[36:14] the uh that the prophet said about it.
[36:16] Um but we what I do know from looking in
[36:19] the messages is that Enoch was a
[36:21] prophet, right? Enoch was a prophet in
[36:24] the lineage of uh of Adam. So now we
[36:27] have this structure. If you could turn
[36:28] to the to the next slide, right? So now
[36:32] we have the Enoch age. We have Jesus
[36:34] Christ. We have trust and we have this
[36:36] thing called a major prophet. So it's
[36:39] important for us to understand that not
[36:41] only was Enoch a prophet, but he was a
[36:43] major prophet, right? Major prophet. I
[36:46] know it's kind of hard to see. It's the
[36:47] yellow uh uh circle right there. But
[36:49] Enoch was a major prophet. So, we're
[36:52] going to read a little bit from the
[36:53] Leodysian church age. Um
[36:57] uh it doesn't give a year that it was
[36:59] preached, but I just put some words up
[37:01] there for you to search search it by.
[37:04] We're going to come through here and see
[37:05] what the prophet had to say uh about
[37:08] this.
[37:11] Um
[37:13] and I can start reading. All right. So
[37:15] he says here before we close this
[37:18] section on the messenger of the
[37:20] Leodysian age, we must seriously
[37:23] consider these two thoughts. So this is
[37:25] something that the prophet really wants
[37:27] us to uh dig dig deep down into our
[37:30] souls. Right? First, this age, which is
[37:34] our age, will have one prophet
[37:36] messenger. Revelation 10:7 says, "When
[37:39] he singular shall begin to sound, there
[37:42] has never been an age where God gave his
[37:44] people two major prophets at one time.
[37:47] He gave Enoch alone. He gave Noah alone.
[37:51] He gave Moses. He alone had the word
[37:54] though through though others
[37:56] prophesies." And that's where we see the
[37:57] five-fold ministry kind of come in. John
[37:59] the Baptist came alone. Now in his last
[38:01] day, there is to be a prophet. And
[38:03] notice he says, "Not a prophetist,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; though in this age there are more women
[38:09] purporting to give God's revelation than
[38:11] man." And we want to stop there just a
[38:13] little bit because it's so true. Uh I've
[38:17] noticed that how, you know, on social
[38:21] media, it's a lot more women that are
[38:23] pushing the gospel than guys are pushing
[38:26] the gospel, right? Uh, and it's uh it's
[38:29] it's it's it shows how different, you
[38:32] know, the message church is because one
[38:35] of the things as long as I've been in
[38:37] the message, I've never seen a female,
[38:40] you know, give the word, right? So, I
[38:42] feel I I believe that the message is one
[38:44] of the few belief systems out there
[38:47] where they don't have uh females, you
[38:49] know, giving the word. Even the Catholic
[38:51] Church, though, they're dirty dogs,
[38:54] right? They don't ordain female priest.
[38:58] I went online and I said if a if a if a
[39:00] Catholic uh female priest were tried to
[39:04] uh you know say that she's a a cardinal
[39:07] or whatever the the Catholic church they
[39:09] excommunicated. They're like nope we not
[39:11] associated with this thing. Right? So,
[39:13] and I thought that was pretty
[39:14] interesting because brother Brandham
[39:16] said that if you go if you go and talk
[39:18] to these people, you'll see that these
[39:20] denominations, they have all these
[39:21] debates, you know, Catholicism versus
[39:23] Protestant, and they're trying to
[39:25] convert each other. They're trying to
[39:26] prove each other. Uh uh they're trying
[39:27] to show which one is right. And you
[39:30] know, a lot of that, you know, the uh
[39:32] females in the pulpit, you see that in a
[39:34] lot of the Protestant religion,
[39:36] especially the Pentecostals. And it's
[39:38] like, you can't convince a Catholic that
[39:41] your religion is right with a female
[39:44] taking charge, they will not believe
[39:46] that. They'll not believe something like
[39:48] that. And God has children in
[39:50] Catholicism, right? It's kind of like,
[39:53] you know, if you tell if you if you go
[39:55] to a homeless person on the street and
[39:57] they're eating out of a trash can,
[39:58] you're like, you tell them, you know, I
[40:00] I know a better trash can than that,
[40:02] right? Like, no homeless person, that's
[40:04] not going to make a homeless person
[40:06] excited. Right? Now, if you go to a
[40:08] homeless person, you say, "Hey, man, I
[40:09] got a house for you. You got hot water,
[40:11] got cold water, you got AC, you got a
[40:14] bed and stuff, then that's something
[40:16] that could get them excited." And so,
[40:17] when we go to these denominations, we
[40:19] got to bring them something that's pure,
[40:21] right? And the message that we've been
[40:23] given today is something that is
[40:25] familiar to any seat of God. And when
[40:27] they hear that, they'll know, hold on a
[40:29] second, this is different from what I've
[40:31] heard from these churches, or this is
[40:33] different from what I heard from in my
[40:34] church. Right? So we have to bring them
[40:37] something that is pure, something that
[40:39] is different, something that is
[40:40] original, right? To catch their
[40:42] attention.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And so continuing on with this um
[40:47] continuing on with this quote that he
[40:49] said here uh and and the and it says
[40:52] here, "And the infallible word says that
[40:54] he the prophet will this is these are
[40:56] important things. He will reveal the
[40:59] mysteries to the end time people and
[41:01] turn the hearts of the children back to
[41:04] the fathers." Right. Those are um those
[41:07] are uh those are important things we
[41:08] want to keep in our our minds because we
[41:10] want to make sure that we know there are
[41:12] no mysteries with us. You want to make
[41:14] sure that there is no there is no
[41:16] mysteries not revealed to you. And you
[41:17] also want to make sure that your heart
[41:19] has been turned back to God so that you
[41:21] can now claim to be under this certain
[41:24] ministry. Right? So we're going to focus
[41:28] on right now the prophet saying well he
[41:30] will reveal the mysteries. Like I said,
[41:32] we want to see how God is the same
[41:34] yesterday, today, and forever. So, going
[41:36] back to uh brother Enoch, right, who we
[41:39] know was a major prophet uh prophet. Uh
[41:42] now, according to Adam's generational
[41:44] lineage, we know that Enoch was the
[41:47] seventh generation from Adam,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; right? Uh Enoch was the seventh
[41:52] generation from Adam. And we also know
[41:53] that Enoch was the first person ever in
[41:56] history to be raptured and translated.
[41:58] That's what the prophet said. the
[41:59] prophets, the Bible says he walked with
[42:01] God until he was translated. So, we want
[42:04] to kind of get uh um we kind of want to
[42:06] get in depth for this thing to kind of
[42:07] see exactly what's going on here. So,
[42:09] we're going to go read Genesis uh
[42:11] chapter 5:es 1 through3.
[42:15] Uh and just say amen once you get there
[42:18] so we can kind of go through this thing.
[42:24] So, I'll start reading. It says here,
[42:25] "This is the book of the generations of
[42:27] Adam. In the day that God created man in
[42:31] the likeness of God made he, male and
[42:33] female created he them and blessed them
[42:35] and called their name Adam in the day
[42:38] when they were created. And Adam lived
[42:40] 130 years and begott a son in his own
[42:42] likeness. and after his and after his
[42:44] image and called his name Seth. And and
[42:47] the days of Adam
[42:50] after he had begotten Seth were 870 800
[42:53] 800 years and he begot uh sons and uh
[42:58] daughters, right? So we see here, right,
[43:00] the Bible establishes how this is the
[43:03] righteous lineage of God, right? Because
[43:05] we know Cain had his own lineage, but
[43:07] this is the righteous lineage coming
[43:09] directly uh uh from God, right? And so
[43:12] after Seth because we know that Abel was
[43:15] of course of course killed. So after
[43:17] Seth you know there were other sons of
[43:20] God. There was Enos, Canaan, Mahalel,
[43:23] Jared and then there was Enoch. So we
[43:25] see here that there were righteous sons
[43:27] of God before Enoch, right? And and a
[43:31] righteous generation a righteous
[43:33] generations and sons of God after Enoch
[43:35] too. But Enoch did something different
[43:38] in from them in order to get a rapture.
[43:41] Even though all of these sons of God
[43:43] were righteous and they were sons of
[43:44] God, right? So I I I come to say this is
[43:49] that, you know, you don't want to just
[43:51] be a good person, right? We don't want
[43:53] to just be good people in church. We
[43:55] don't want to be just uh uh tithe payers
[43:58] and, you know, we we we pay our offering
[44:00] and we show up to church every single
[44:02] Sunday and we we sing and we we're good
[44:04] people and stuff like that. No, we want
[44:06] to we want to we want to know is there
[44:09] more to God than this? We want to make
[44:11] sure that we can get whatever God has
[44:13] the most that God has to offer. We want
[44:15] to make sure that we have every single
[44:17] bit of this thing, right? To make us
[44:19] different, right? And so, you know, in
[44:23] Luther's age, in Wesley's age, in the
[44:25] Pentecostal age, you know, these were
[44:26] all very good people and sons and
[44:28] daughters of God, but the rapture didn't
[44:30] happen during their time because they
[44:32] were missing something, right? So, if I
[44:35] had if I had a a if I had a phone where
[44:37] I could just call heaven and I could
[44:40] talk to Enoch, I would ask him, "Enoch,
[44:42] what did you do different? What made you
[44:44] different than Seth? What made you
[44:46] different than Enos? What made you
[44:48] different than all of these other
[44:50] righteous sons of God? What what was it
[44:52] about your walk that got you
[44:53] translated?" You know, well, we thank we
[44:56] thank the prophet that he had these
[44:57] answers for us. So, in the message, the
[45:00] great the great coming revival and the
[45:02] outpouring of the Holy Ghost preached in
[45:04] 54 uh and it's going to be paragraph uh
[45:08] 14.
[45:11] And we're just going to read just uh
[45:13] just one sentence from that. I'll just
[45:15] go ahead and read that real quick. It
[45:16] says here, Enoch had preached and many
[45:19] others. So, Enoch had a message, right?
[45:23] Enoch had a message during this time.
[45:26] And if you remember, Enoch had a father.
[45:28] He had a mother. He had a grandfather.
[45:30] He had a grandmother. He had uncles. He
[45:32] had aunts. He had cousins. He had a
[45:34] wife. The Bible says he even had a
[45:36] child. He had friends. But only Enoch
[45:39] was the person that was translated out
[45:41] of all of these people, right? So, you
[45:44] know, you can't you you know, especially
[45:46] like you children, you can't depend upon
[45:48] the relationship of your father and the
[45:51] relationship of your mother, right? In
[45:53] order for God to give you a rapture,
[45:55] right? And if you're uh if you're a
[45:56] father or mother, if your child has a
[45:58] revelation, you can't depend upon the
[46:00] revelation of your child, you know, you
[46:02] can't depend upon the revelation of your
[46:03] son or the daughter. You got to have
[46:05] something. God has to give you something
[46:07] uh for yourself, right? So when it comes
[46:10] to predestination, uh uh uh it is not
[46:13] family affiliation is t in a in a sense
[46:16] is taken out of the equation. And that's
[46:18] why uh if you notice on the slide, I
[46:21] like how I put here Enoch, the Enoch
[46:23] age, I put hidden ministry, right? This
[46:26] was something that only Enoch knew
[46:28] during that time. All right? So, you
[46:31] have to have revelation uh for yourself.
[46:34] So, the Bible says Enoch walked the W
[46:35] walk. So, that means people saw him and
[46:38] they must have saw that there was
[46:39] something different about Enoch than
[46:41] everybody else, right? They must have
[46:43] saw that you know Enoch he's just
[46:45] different from he just the the things he
[46:47] talk about like I just don't understand
[46:49] what he's saying is his son probably
[46:51] like dad I just don't know what you're
[46:53] talking about he would talk to his wife
[46:54] and his wife's like honey I don't know
[46:56] what you are talking about right and um
[46:59] I and that's just to let you know like
[47:02] when you go into the workplace when you
[47:04] go into your school you know
[47:06] denominational Christians should see
[47:08] something different about you right you
[47:10] guys should not be on the same level you
[47:12] know, a denominational Christian should
[47:14] be able to shouldn't be able to talk to
[47:16] you and say, "Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a
[47:17] Christian just like me." No, no, no.
[47:18] They got to see there's something
[47:20] peculiar about you, right? The way the
[47:23] things that you believe, the the the
[47:25] things that you say, the way you walk,
[47:27] right? They got to say, "Nah, you're
[47:29] different. Like, I've been in church,
[47:30] but nah, this person right here, they're
[47:32] a little bit more different." Right?
[47:35] Because we're looking, we're also
[47:36] looking at patterns and how, you know,
[47:37] how God has done things, right? So,
[47:40] let's see why Enoch was uh uh uh
[47:42] different. You know, I can imagine some
[47:44] of his family members, you know, they
[47:46] saw Enoch out here and they was like,
[47:48] "Man, Enoch, you're always out there
[47:49] building on this pyramid, right? You're
[47:51] always out there working on this
[47:53] pyramid." Because uh the history books
[47:55] would tell you that the Egyptians built
[47:57] the pyramids, but the prophet said that
[47:59] Enoch was the first person to build a
[48:01] pyramid, right? And this is why we can
[48:04] see this why this man was so special.
[48:06] So, we're going to go read the message,
[48:08] the future home of the heavenly
[48:09] bridegroom and the earthly bride,
[48:11] preached in 64. And it's going to be a
[48:13] lot of reading here. We're going to be
[48:14] reading paragraph 411 through 419.
[48:20] And I I'll start reading since it's it's
[48:22] it's so much here to read. Uh it says
[48:25] here, Brother Brandham illustrates to
[48:26] the blackboard, there is the great seal.
[48:29] Here it is. See the city? It's not just
[48:31] a flat cube like this, but it leans up
[48:33] so it can't be seen. And upon this holy
[48:37] mountain, the Lord shall descend upon uh
[48:41] top of the of his mountain. Here he is.
[48:43] That's the reason the capstone wasn't
[48:45] put on by Enoch. See, that's the reason
[48:48] the capstone has to come now in our age.
[48:51] And the mountain will be pushed up and
[48:53] it'll be the mount of the Lord. And in
[48:55] here will dwell the redeemed. These
[48:57] avenues, big freeways as it was, parks
[49:00] and the river life will draw, run
[49:02] through it. And every house will be made
[49:03] of transparent gold. and the streets
[49:05] will be made of gold and the trees. And
[49:07] he's talking about your future home,
[49:09] right? This is
[49:11] &gt;&gt; right. You got to have revelation that
[49:12] that's your address, right? You you got
[49:15] some property. You got some real estate
[49:17] on this mountain, right? And I love
[49:19] mountain property. Every time I go
[49:21] through Tennessee and I see the uh
[49:22] houses sticking out of the mountains, I
[49:24] love me some mountain property, right?
[49:27] It says, "And every house will be made
[49:28] of transparent gold, and the streets
[49:30] will be made of gold, and the trees of
[49:32] life will be there, and will bear 12
[49:34] manners of fruit, and the kings and the
[49:35] honored man of the earth shall bring
[49:37] their honor and glory into the gates,
[49:38] and the gates shall not shut by night,
[49:40] because there is no night." And he says
[49:42] here, "In the city where the Lamb is the
[49:44] light." And we're going to go down to uh
[49:48] um uh paragraph 4:13. He says, "Don't
[49:51] you see the the the towns, the cities,
[49:53] the house, the dwellings are speaking of
[49:56] that right now? All these natural things
[49:58] are a shadow. Take a shadow at a
[50:01] distance like my hand. Before there
[50:03] could be a positive or a negative, there
[50:04] has to be a a positive." And you see
[50:07] that shadow. Look, I've got a dozen
[50:09] fingers. But then when you go to it to
[50:12] getting it closer, it focuses down to
[50:15] one and then the shadow fades into the
[50:17] hand. Right? So shadows, the purpose of
[50:20] a shadow is to be done away with once it
[50:22] gets to the original real thing, right?
[50:26] And that and that's a lot of time people
[50:28] think there's three or four gods. You're
[50:30] looking too far back in the early
[50:31] reformation. See, come on down now and
[50:34] you'll find focus in till there's one.
[50:36] That's exactly. There is one bride, not
[50:39] a dozen denom, not not a dozen
[50:40] denominations, but one bride that's the
[50:42] elected out of every out of out of the
[50:45] earth that's been predestinated to this.
[50:47] The ones who can recognize their place
[50:50] in the kingdom on this throne. Look so
[50:53] high, the new city with the foundations,
[50:55] 12 gates, Jesus the headstone, the
[50:57] apostles judging the 12 tribes. And I
[50:59] want to focus in on this uh paragraph
[51:02] 4:18. He says, "The pyramid of Enoch,"
[51:06] the the pyramid that Enoch built cast no
[51:09] shadow, no time of the day. I've been in
[51:12] Egypt at the pyramids. It's so
[51:14] geographically fixed in the dimensions
[51:16] of this uh great geometrical figure that
[51:19] no matter where the sun is, there is
[51:20] never a shadow around the pyramid. See
[51:23] how it is, right? So, this kind of gives
[51:26] us an insight on the kind of revelation
[51:29] that Enoch had during this time. So the
[51:31] prophet taught us that there were three
[51:33] Bibles. God made three Bibles. The first
[51:36] Bible was the zodiac, right? That's what
[51:39] Job used to do to sacrifice to God. And
[51:43] also to re recognize if he made a
[51:45] sacrifice for his kids, God would
[51:47] receive it too. He read that in the
[51:49] stars. The third Bible is the one that
[51:51] every single one of us have right now.
[51:53] It's on paper. But the second Bible was
[51:56] the pyramid that Enoch built. Right? So
[51:59] when Enoch built a pyramid, the prophet
[52:01] said he built a pyramid which was a
[52:03] representation of the word where there
[52:06] were no shadows. When the light shined
[52:08] onto this thing, there were no shadows.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; So he had a revelation and type, right,
[52:13] of a word where there was no mysteries.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; No wonder the man was raptured,
[52:19] right? No wonder he was taken away. No
[52:21] wonder he walked the walk, right? He
[52:24] walked this walk that pleased God that
[52:26] nobody else could understand what this
[52:28] thing what was going on. And it's a type
[52:30] for us today that we too need a message
[52:32] today that has no shadows, right? No
[52:35] shadows. No mysteries, right? We can't
[52:38] be guessing. We have to know exactly
[52:40] where we stand. We have to be able and I
[52:42] like it because the prophet when when
[52:45] the prophet said that he unveiled the
[52:47] mysteries, right? What it did was it
[52:49] gave me and you the ability to go
[52:51] through the Bible and see Jesus Christ
[52:53] in every single verse.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Right? And when you're able to identify
[52:58] Christ in all things, when the rapture
[53:00] come, you'll be able to identify him.
[53:03] Right? So that's why a lot of people are
[53:06] uh you know, you you tell these things
[53:08] to these people and they don't
[53:09] understand. They don't see they don't
[53:11] see Christ. You know, you have some of
[53:13] the uh the black Israelites, I guess
[53:15] what they call the religion that they
[53:17] got where they believe they're the true
[53:18] Israelites. You don't want to be no Jew,
[53:21] right? These people are walking around,
[53:23] they don't even know what they're
[53:24] saying,
[53:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:26] &gt;&gt; The Jews says, uh, the Bible says that
[53:28] only 144,000 Jews would be saved.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But when the prophet went into heaven
[53:33] and he said, "Is Paul and Peter here?"
[53:36] The angel told him, "Yes, he's here." He
[53:37] said, "Well, I know I'll make it
[53:38] because, you know, I preach what they
[53:40] preach." And the Bible said the millions
[53:43] said we are resting on that. So why put
[53:46] your odds on 144,000 when there's
[53:48] millions.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet had millions behind him that
[53:54] was in heaven that was able to make a
[53:56] rapture.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Right? We need a message today that has
[54:00] no shadows, no mysteries. Right? We want
[54:03] everything that God has for us.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; That's why, you know, and we'll get a
[54:07] little bit later on into this thing. I
[54:09] can kind you can kind of tell somebody's
[54:12] spirit by the way they treat a prophet.
[54:15] You can kind of tell what group they
[54:16] belong to just by how they treat the
[54:19] prophet's ministry. Right? So going
[54:22] going on with this, we see how Enoch, we
[54:26] can't say he had the spirit of Elijah,
[54:28] right? Because Elijah wasn't born yet,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; right? And because he didn't, the
[54:32] prophet said that he did not cap uh the
[54:35] pyramid uh uh on there, right? because
[54:38] it was a type. But he had a he had a
[54:40] ministry similar to it though because he
[54:43] was raptured, right? And the next person
[54:45] raptured after him was Elijah,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; right? And so I I I I say this to say
[54:50] that, you know, you have to be a pyramid
[54:53] builder, too,
[54:54] &gt;&gt; right? In this day and age, you all have
[54:56] to be we all have to be pyramid
[54:58] builders, right? Just like Enoch. And
[55:00] you might say, you know, well, I don't
[55:01] have an engineering degree, you know? I
[55:04] don't have I don't know. I don't know
[55:05] what it is. what would I use concrete?
[55:08] Do I use clay? Do I You might be asking
[55:10] these things and I'm not talking about
[55:11] that kind of uh pyramid. If you could
[55:13] turn to the next slide.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Right. The prophet gave us the building
[55:19] plan for a spiritual pyramid. Right.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Starting with faith, virtue, knowledge,
[55:26] temperance, patience, uh godliness,
[55:29] brotherly kindness. And notice the
[55:31] capstone that Enoch couldn't put on his
[55:33] pyramid, right? which is the Holy Ghost
[55:36] for us today, right? And a lot of times
[55:38] it trips up. A lot of people get it
[55:41] tripped up, you know, especially a lot
[55:42] of young people, they get it mixed up
[55:44] about, you know, how do I know if I have
[55:45] the Holy Ghost, right? The prophet put
[55:47] it this way. If you say, if you
[55:49] recognize the message for your day and
[55:51] you're able to say amen and live the
[55:53] life because only God can live his word,
[55:56] right? Only God can live his word. So,
[55:59] we have to be pyramid builders in this
[56:01] time. And we also have to have a pyramid
[56:03] that has no shadows. That means, you
[56:06] know, if God shines a light on your
[56:07] life, you know, you can't be hiding
[56:10] anything. You know, some people want to
[56:11] drink. Some people want to drink in the
[56:13] message and if the light shines on there
[56:15] and it cast a shadow,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; you ain't ready yet.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Some people say, you know, well, God
[56:20] created all the plants and for us to be
[56:22] able to use and stuff and God shines a
[56:26] shadow shines a light on that and cast a
[56:28] shadow. Nope. this thing ain't God won't
[56:31] cap the pyramid until it's perfect,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; right? God will not cap the pyramid
[56:35] until it's a perfect pyramid.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You know, children, if you don't if
[56:38] you're not obeying your kids and God
[56:40] comes down and shines a light on that
[56:41] your uh your pyramid and there's a
[56:43] shadow, he won't cap the thing. You
[56:45] know, if you don't go to church, right?
[56:48] Oh, well, I listen to tapes, bro. If God
[56:51] shines a light of the five-fold
[56:53] ministry, then you cast in a shadow. God
[56:55] can't cap a pyramid like that.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Right? You have to be perfect,
[57:01] &gt;&gt; right? You got to be perfect,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; right? So, so the difference with uh
[57:07] Enoch's ministry was that uh he revealed
[57:11] he he in type he revealed he had a
[57:13] pyramid with no shadows because he
[57:15] revealed mysteries. It was a type. But
[57:17] the problem was he didn't turn anybody's
[57:20] heart, right? He was the only person
[57:22] raptured, right? So, we have to keep
[57:24] this in mind as we're going through our
[57:26] journey and uh we um start to talk about
[57:29] these different things. So, uh you know,
[57:31] we talked about how the brother Brandham
[57:33] said that the uh there will only be four
[57:36] raptures, right? Enoch was the first,
[57:38] Elijah was the second, Jesus Christ was
[57:41] the third, and then the bride will
[57:43] receive a rapture of course in this day
[57:45] and age. So, and we can kind of see
[57:47] though in each of these raptures that
[57:49] there is an emphasis of Elijah's spirit
[57:52] on uh these people that have been
[57:54] raptured, right? So, uh if if if if
[57:57] we're living if you're living in any
[57:59] age, you want to have the spirit that
[58:01] can recognize where is Elijah's spirit
[58:04] so that I can attach on to this thing,
[58:06] right? It's important for us to
[58:07] recognize this thing. And so we're going
[58:10] to contrast this thing over with another
[58:13] major prophet that was sent after Enoch.
[58:15] Uh and this major prophet, of course,
[58:17] was Noah. Noah had his own uh separate
[58:20] age. So you can turn to the next slide
[58:22] and we'll see. Uh this is Noah's age,
[58:25] which looks uh pretty similar uh to
[58:28] Enoch's. And a lot of times people
[58:30] confuse ministries and get things uh
[58:32] mixed up. Uh but it's important to
[58:35] recognize the ministries that are going
[58:36] on during your time in earth so that you
[58:38] can know uh what time it is. So now we
[58:41] see God uh has raptured Enoch away, but
[58:45] now God is sending Noah onto the scene,
[58:47] right? And this is during a time uh
[58:50] where God's people have gotten away from
[58:52] the word, right? So this is another
[58:55] thing we want to see with this major
[58:56] prophet position. Um when God sends a
[59:00] major prophet, it's either two things.
[59:02] it's either a really really really good
[59:04] thing or it's either a really really
[59:07] really bad thing. Right? And you want to
[59:10] have the spirit where it's a good thing.
[59:12] Right? Because uh one of the the the one
[59:14] of the purposes like I like I said for a
[59:17] major prophet coming on the scene is
[59:19] when God's people have gotten away from
[59:20] the word, he's got to send this guy onto
[59:23] this not the five-fold ministry. Notice
[59:25] we haven't gotten to the five-fold
[59:27] ministry yet, right? And the fiful
[59:28] ministry is important, but the word of
[59:30] the Lord comes to the prophets first. So
[59:33] God has to send a major prophet onto the
[59:36] scene to get his people back uh into
[59:39] step. Right? So we're at a time right
[59:42] now where the world has gotten into a a
[59:46] horrible horrible condition. And uh
[59:49] we're going to we're going to go to
[59:50] Genesis 5:28
[59:52] uh 32 just to kind of see just to kind
[59:55] of see um
[59:58] what just to kind of get a buildup of of
[1:00:02] of uh how this thing happened. Uh so uh
[1:00:07] 528-32
[1:00:09] and it says here and Lamech lived 182
[1:00:13] years and begat a son and he called his
[1:00:16] he called his name Noah saying this same
[1:00:18] shall comfort us concerning our work and
[1:00:20] toil of our hands because of the ground
[1:00:22] which the Lord hath cursed and lamech
[1:00:24] lived after he begat Noah 595
[1:00:29] years and begat sons and daughters. So
[1:00:31] Noah was born and now Noah has uh
[1:00:34] brothers and sisters, right? And verse
[1:00:37] 31 says, "And all the days Lamech were
[1:00:40] 777
[1:00:41] years and he died. And Noah was 500
[1:00:44] years old and Noah begat Shim, Ham, and
[1:00:48] Japath, right? So we see some key things
[1:00:52] here. First, there's something special
[1:00:54] about Noah because his birth, you know,
[1:00:56] the Bible says something about him. we
[1:00:59] know there's something uh special with
[1:01:01] what he has to do. And the next thing is
[1:01:03] that we see Lamech was his father. And
[1:01:06] it's funny how the Bible said he lived
[1:01:08] to be 777
[1:01:11] years old, which is uh 777
[1:01:15] is uh seven of is of course God's number
[1:01:18] of completion and three is God's number
[1:01:20] of perfection. So we see perfect uh
[1:01:23] completion, right? And so we can see and
[1:01:26] we and and of course a lot of us Bible
[1:01:29] uh readers already know that Noah was
[1:01:31] the last person right that would be
[1:01:34] saved after uh Lamech uh had given birth
[1:01:38] uh to him right so you might want to say
[1:01:41] why is this thing important well when
[1:01:44] you read Genesis chapter 5 five means
[1:01:46] grace and this is where we see Enoch's
[1:01:50] ministry right and uh brother Brandham
[1:01:52] even said that God will send Elijah's
[1:01:54] spirit five times which was grace gr a
[1:01:58] ce faith and in Jesus right and so and
[1:02:02] and then um lame met giving birth to
[1:02:06] Noah at the end of this chapter uh it
[1:02:08] signifies the ending of this particular
[1:02:11] kind of grace right and then Noah's
[1:02:14] ministry we see begins in chapter six
[1:02:16] six being the number of man right but it
[1:02:19] says that Noah found grace in the sight
[1:02:22] of God but it was a different kind of
[1:02:24] grace,
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; right? So, not all grace is the same.
[1:02:27] And you'll notice a lot of people will
[1:02:28] be praying for God's grace, God's grace,
[1:02:30] but you want God's best grace,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; right? You want to be able to identify
[1:02:35] with God's top grace. God gives grace to
[1:02:38] a lot of people, but you want to be the
[1:02:39] one that's uh uh on top, right? So, we
[1:02:43] see in uh Noah's uh in Noah's ministry,
[1:02:48] the reason why that reason why God's
[1:02:50] people got away from the word is because
[1:02:52] they did the same exact thing Eve did,
[1:02:55] right? They married the men of they
[1:02:57] married the uh the daughters of men of
[1:03:00] the world, right? The Bible said the
[1:03:01] sons of God saw the daughters of God and
[1:03:03] they went and married them. And God
[1:03:05] said, "What are you guys doing?" Right?
[1:03:08] He had just tried to separate. He kept
[1:03:11] the generation separate. Adam's
[1:03:13] generation was a lineage in his own. And
[1:03:14] Cain's generation was out there doing
[1:03:16] that. He was trying to keep the group
[1:03:18] separate. God is always in the
[1:03:19] separating business. You can't bring
[1:03:22] stuff into your life.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't have a pyramid with
[1:03:26] shadows. You can't bring these things of
[1:03:28] the world in there. You can't bring
[1:03:29] these isms in the world. God is always
[1:03:31] trying to separate his people uh from
[1:03:34] the things of the world, right?
[1:03:37] So, he sends the major prophet and um
[1:03:42] uh and God decides that he's going to
[1:03:45] destroy uh the world. And we'll be
[1:03:46] closing soon because this is just a
[1:03:48] little bit a little bit much. Uh God
[1:03:50] decided he's going to be destroying he's
[1:03:51] going to destroy the world. But of
[1:03:53] course, he found uh he found grace in
[1:03:55] the sight of Noah. And we want to read
[1:03:58] uh well, no, we won't get to that. So we
[1:04:00] what we'll say what we want to notice is
[1:04:02] that Noah had brothers and sisters
[1:04:04] during this time right and the thing
[1:04:07] about it was Enoch's message was a
[1:04:10] message that wasn't preached to
[1:04:12] everybody right only uh well he may have
[1:04:14] preached it I'm not sure but we know
[1:04:16] that it was a hidden ministry hidden
[1:04:18] revelation because he was the only one
[1:04:20] that caught the revelation on contrast
[1:04:23] to Noah Noah preached to everybody right
[1:04:26] the uh prophet said Noah preached for
[1:04:28] 120 years The ark was open. It was
[1:04:30] available for everyone to come. Right?
[1:04:33] Showing the significance of how the
[1:04:35] rapture is only for a particular group.
[1:04:38] It's not just a everybody thing, right?
[1:04:41] It's a particular group that gets there.
[1:04:43] But salvation represented by the ark.
[1:04:46] Anyone can come. God wants everyone to
[1:04:48] come. God opened the doors for everyone.
[1:04:50] It was for everyone to come and be
[1:04:52] saved. Uh showing that uh uh God's
[1:04:56] election is for his. But you can reject
[1:04:58] salvation. Right?
[1:05:01] So the bi the prophet told us that only
[1:05:04] Noah and his immediate family were
[1:05:06] saved. So it was eight souls out of the
[1:05:08] whole entire entire world. Right? Um and
[1:05:12] we want to uh take a minute uh uh in
[1:05:16] closing, we'll just kind of talk about
[1:05:18] this little statement right here. We
[1:05:20] want to take a minute to see why, you
[1:05:22] know, why it was such a big deal. why
[1:05:25] God was so upset with his people for
[1:05:27] doing these things. Uh if you remember
[1:05:29] the prophet said that Abel's lineage
[1:05:32] were simple people, right? They were
[1:05:34] farmers, right? They was just trusting
[1:05:36] in God, right? But Cain's people were
[1:05:39] inventors. They, you know, they made big
[1:05:41] cities. They had instruments. They had
[1:05:43] education and all these things. And and
[1:05:46] the message perfect strength by perfect
[1:05:48] weakness. Uh the prophet said
[1:05:52] um
[1:05:54] and it's uh paragraph 121 I'll just go
[1:05:56] ahead and read it. The prophet said he
[1:05:59] brings us here on earth for then we are
[1:06:01] educated we're smart. Did you ever
[1:06:03] notice the lines of lineages when we
[1:06:05] take for instance like in Abel from Abel
[1:06:08] come Seth Seth lineages come right on
[1:06:10] down on down onto Noah's time all of
[1:06:13] them were humble farmers but Cain's
[1:06:15] children become smart shrewd educated
[1:06:18] great men builders professional men
[1:06:22] right and we see that you know because
[1:06:25] the people came from Abel Abel coming
[1:06:27] from God that they were a righteous
[1:06:29] people meaning that they totally
[1:06:31] depended on God for everything, right?
[1:06:33] Because they were righteous. So God
[1:06:35] blessed their harvest. He gave them a
[1:06:37] bountiful harvest, right? There were no
[1:06:39] food shortages on this side. So we could
[1:06:41] think of it like north side and south
[1:06:43] side, right? You know, you got Abel's
[1:06:45] people on the north side and Cain's
[1:06:47] people on the south side. And so, you
[1:06:49] know, on Abel's side, no food shortages.
[1:06:52] They were not, they were, I mean,
[1:06:54] healthy people, healthy, strong people.
[1:06:56] God blessed their families. So we should
[1:06:59] be seeing that thing, seeing that in us
[1:07:01] today because God is now doing the
[1:07:04] separating, right? And God said he
[1:07:06] wanted to give us a overflow, right? And
[1:07:08] what overflow does is it makes you look
[1:07:10] different than other people. So people
[1:07:13] should be able to tell uh uh just where
[1:07:16] you belong just by what God has done in
[1:07:19] your life.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So let's let's contrast this with Kane's
[1:07:24] people. You know, they had big cities
[1:07:26] and they had the best medicine, right?
[1:07:28] They had the best security police and
[1:07:30] they had trade routes and all that
[1:07:32] stuff. But the problem is they were an
[1:07:35] unrighteous people, right? There was an
[1:07:37] unrighteous lineage. No wonder they
[1:07:39] needed the best medicine, right? They
[1:07:41] didn't have faith enough to ask God for
[1:07:44] healing. Brother Brandham said that
[1:07:46] sometimes people don't have enough faith
[1:07:47] to heal a toothache, right? But God's
[1:07:50] people, when you get the Holy Spirit,
[1:07:52] you should be able to have faith, right,
[1:07:54] for God to heal your body, right?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, HIV, it used to be a
[1:07:59] deadly disease because it was associated
[1:08:01] with a particular group, right? But
[1:08:04] nowadays, they got medications to try to
[1:08:06] cure it. So these people will do
[1:08:09] everything they can to stay healthy, but
[1:08:11] be righteous,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; If you live righteous, God will take the
[1:08:16] sickness away from you.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So Cain's people were very shrewd
[1:08:20] and smart because they didn't want to be
[1:08:22] righteous, but they wanted to keep
[1:08:24] living on the earth, right? Um, and no
[1:08:28] wonder Cain's people, you know, they had
[1:08:30] uh the uh they had military police. They
[1:08:32] had police. They were murderers, right?
[1:08:35] But on Abel's side, people wasn't doing
[1:08:37] stuff over there. There was no need for
[1:08:39] police. You didn't have to have police
[1:08:40] officers, right? They were a peaceful
[1:08:42] people, right? And you know they needed
[1:08:45] uh Kane's people needed you know uh
[1:08:47] smart smart shrewd people right they
[1:08:49] needed divorce lawyers and divorce court
[1:08:52] right because people was marrying in and
[1:08:54] not marrying in but when you look at
[1:08:56] Abel's people you ain't see none of
[1:08:58] those things over there with Abel's
[1:08:59] people right uh Cain's people they
[1:09:02] needed the government right to develop
[1:09:04] uh programs for orphanages right and uh
[1:09:08] because parents would abandon their kids
[1:09:10] but you didn't see none of that stuff
[1:09:12] with Abble's people Right? So it was a
[1:09:15] huge contrast. So when God saw these
[1:09:18] people, God saw God's people take all of
[1:09:21] them blessings and then put them over
[1:09:23] here with these wicked people. He got
[1:09:25] upset and said, "No, I have to destroy
[1:09:27] this whole place."
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And you remember that, you know, it was
[1:09:30] only God only po repopulated the earth
[1:09:34] with righteous people.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Right. So in closing um you know we want
[1:09:39] to make sure that you know we are in a
[1:09:42] position right we want to make sure that
[1:09:44] we've gone through the steps of
[1:09:46] justification sanctification God has
[1:09:48] cleansed us you've been born again being
[1:09:50] born again means that you're now a a son
[1:09:53] or daughter of God right but it doesn't
[1:09:56] stop there we want to go on and uh uh uh
[1:09:58] building this pyramid as Enoch had
[1:10:00] because when the prophet says something
[1:10:02] we want to make sure that we don't have
[1:10:04] any shadows around us that if the if the
[1:10:06] word were to come on us, if the word
[1:10:07] were to say something to us, right? It
[1:10:09] wouldn't be no shadows. We wouldn't have
[1:10:11] anything hidden. Shadows, when you have
[1:10:13] shadows, you can hide stuff, right? But
[1:10:15] God's looking for a people that is fully
[1:10:17] open to his word, right? So, we're
[1:10:20] trying to go on to the step of being uh
[1:10:22] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:24] because God will not God will not
[1:10:27] populate a vessel that has shadows and
[1:10:29] things hidden. You know, God wants to be
[1:10:31] in a vessel where it's a direct image of
[1:10:34] himself, right? So that he can live with
[1:10:36] his people and they'll be positioned uh
[1:10:39] for a rapture.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Um we're going to uh
[1:10:42] say a word of prayer just to uh close
[1:10:44] this out.
[1:10:47] Lord Jesus, we thank you, oh Lord God,
[1:10:49] for your word, oh Lord God. Lord Jesus,
[1:10:53] it's it's only by your grace that we can
[1:10:55] hear these things, oh Lord God. Lord, as
[1:10:58] I said before, there's millions of
[1:11:00] Christians and billions of Christians in
[1:11:02] the world, oh Lord God, and they're
[1:11:04] living life however they want to, oh
[1:11:05] Lord God. Whatever doctrine, however
[1:11:07] they feel about a particular Bible
[1:11:09] verse, they'll interpret it in their own
[1:11:10] way, oh Lord God, and they'll still be
[1:11:13] trying to worship you, oh Lord Jesus.
[1:11:15] But Lord, you loved us so much that in
[1:11:17] this last day, you've given us a
[1:11:19] message, oh Lord God. You've given us a
[1:11:21] guide, oh Lord God. Lord, we can see
[1:11:24] that what we believe as people try to
[1:11:26] challenge our beliefs and say it's just
[1:11:29] a man's message and stuff, but Lord, we
[1:11:31] can clearly see, oh Lord God, that our
[1:11:33] lives are tell are dovetailing with the
[1:11:37] scriptures, Lord, from Genesis, oh Lord
[1:11:40] God, until now, oh Lord God. So we thank
[1:11:42] you, oh Lord God, for this revelation,
[1:11:44] oh Lord, that you've given us, oh Lord
[1:11:46] God. Lord, continue to bless the people.
[1:11:48] Oh Lord Jesus Christ, because you've
[1:11:50] given us your word, oh Lord God, we're
[1:11:52] expecting to see a separation. Oh Lord
[1:11:54] God, we're expecting to see a separation
[1:11:56] in our workplace. Oh Lord God, Lord,
[1:11:58] we're expecting to see a separation in
[1:12:00] the schools. Oh Lord God, Lord, wherever
[1:12:02] our feet touch, oh Lord God, Lord, we're
[1:12:05] expecting to see a separation in our
[1:12:07] health. Oh Lord God, Lord, we should be
[1:12:09] the healthiest people on earth. Oh Lord
[1:12:11] Jesus Christ, Lord, we should we
[1:12:13] shouldn't have to go to doctors and pay
[1:12:15] for drugs and all these things, oh Lord
[1:12:17] God. Lord, you cleansed us, oh Lord, and
[1:12:19] made us righteous, oh Lord, and
[1:12:20] separated us from the world, oh Lord
[1:12:22] God. So now we're expecting, oh Lord
[1:12:24] God, to see these things in our life, oh
[1:12:26] Lord God. We're expecting to see our
[1:12:28] families restored, Lord God. It was
[1:12:30] Cain's lineage, oh Lord, that had uh
[1:12:32] broken up families, oh Lord. But Lord,
[1:12:34] we're standing here, oh Lord God, in
[1:12:36] your word and we're expecting to see our
[1:12:37] families, our loved ones restored, oh
[1:12:39] Lord God. Lord, oh God, we're coming
[1:12:41] with your word, oh Lord God, knowing
[1:12:43] that full well confidence that you will
[1:12:45] accomplish these things in our life,
[1:12:46] Lord. And we ask it in the precious name
[1:12:48] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] [Applause]
[1:13:04] We thank the Lord for the word of God uh
[1:13:08] on tonight from brother Quinton. A lot
[1:13:11] of uh nuggets in there and uh I was just
[1:13:17] um I was just thinking about him um
[1:13:22] speaking. it just kind of uh came to my
[1:13:25] mind that he might have a series
[1:13:29] uh and uh just the way that that all
[1:13:31] kind of came together. I I can see he
[1:13:33] got more to give us and we'll have to
[1:13:34] make room for that. But I I enjoyed
[1:13:37] that, Brother Quinton. God God bless
[1:13:39] you. Amen. God bless you.
[1:13:44] Praise the Lord. and the separation that
[1:13:46] he was ending up there with Cain's group
[1:13:49] and and Abel's group and how uh when you
[1:13:52] really think about it as as believers,
[1:13:54] God has given us promises uh in his
[1:13:57] word. Others may not have those same
[1:13:59] promises. If you know um a believer uh
[1:14:03] get diagnosed with cancer or any you
[1:14:05] know other uh disease, a believer has
[1:14:08] the ability to go to the word of God and
[1:14:12] and um and apply the word of God. And
[1:14:14] one of those promises that uh if they
[1:14:17] lay hands on the sick then they shall
[1:14:20] recover. And uh where a unbeliever has
[1:14:23] never even heard anything like that
[1:14:25] before. Right. But but we as believers
[1:14:27] we can take God at his word and expect
[1:14:30] God to do exactly what he said he would
[1:14:33] do. Amen. No matter what the situation
[1:14:36] is. Even if you had a financial issue
[1:14:39] that you were uh battling. Unbelievers
[1:14:42] go through financial problems. Believers
[1:14:44] go through financial problems. But a
[1:14:46] believer, a man could stand there, look
[1:14:49] the devil in the eye and say, "Lord, you
[1:14:53] told me that if I were to bring my
[1:14:56] tithes and my offering into the house of
[1:14:58] the Lord, the Bible promised that you
[1:15:01] would rebuke the devour for my sake."
[1:15:04] And not only that, you said you would
[1:15:05] open up the windows of heaven and you
[1:15:08] pour me out blessings where I had room,
[1:15:10] not enough to receive. Father, this is
[1:15:13] your word. This is not my word. This is
[1:15:15] what you told me. So, amen. You can
[1:15:17] stand there with those that type of
[1:15:19] confidence and know that God is going to
[1:15:21] come through on your behalf no matter
[1:15:23] what it is that you're facing. I thank
[1:15:26] God for these promises. Blessed be the
[1:15:29] name of the Lord.
[1:15:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And and
[1:15:35] I I I liked just how the Lord led him.
[1:15:38] Sometimes I I'll tell you this that God
[1:15:40] don't show us everything. Um he he lets
[1:15:44] us grow into uh some things and and I
[1:15:47] just like that. I I mean I I've had the
[1:15:49] experience that in my own ministry.
[1:15:50] Brother Quinton uh was saying I I didn't
[1:15:53] know who the first uh prophet was. And
[1:15:57] he says, "But I knew Enoch was a
[1:15:59] prophet." and he went to Genesis 5 and
[1:16:01] he got he got that and he just you know
[1:16:03] and I'm glad God didn't show him who the
[1:16:05] first prophet was cuz we wouldn't have
[1:16:07] got all of that tonight. Right? So, but
[1:16:10] I I I'll I'll give you the the the the
[1:16:12] answer to who the first prophet was in
[1:16:14] the scripture. The first prophet was God
[1:16:17] himself.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God himself. And his first
[1:16:22] prophecy was in Genesis 3:15,
[1:16:26] right? And what he told Adam and Eve and
[1:16:29] uh and he told he said he said that um
[1:16:32] her seed uh um I can't even remember the
[1:16:36] the the yeah place put immity um between
[1:16:40] your seed and the woman's seed and just
[1:16:43] give me Genesis 3:15 cuz I I I I can't
[1:16:47] uh um uh I can't get it right now but I
[1:16:50] I can I can I can read it out of the
[1:16:52] Bible. That's the first God himself was
[1:16:55] the first prophet and brother Brandham
[1:16:57] uh actually brought that point out. So
[1:16:59] uh but like I said I'm so glad that he
[1:17:02] didn't show that all to brother Quinton
[1:17:04] because we would have got all that
[1:17:05] tonight. I will put immity between thee
[1:17:07] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:17:09] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[1:17:11] and thou shalt bruise his heels. So when
[1:17:12] he's prophesying about the woman's seed
[1:17:15] right here in the scripture and this is
[1:17:17] the uh this was fulfi was fulfilled when
[1:17:21] Mary came on the earth. So uh God was
[1:17:25] speaking of Mary right here in this
[1:17:28] scripture. He was speaking of Christ in
[1:17:31] this scripture right here that Christ
[1:17:32] would be coming. This was a prophecy.
[1:17:34] Amen. Fulfilled uh in the days of Mary
[1:17:37] on the earth. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:39] Hallelujah. I just love the way God do
[1:17:42] things. Amen. I love the way God do

[1:19:58] a testimony? All right, praise the Lord.
[1:20:09] God bless you, saints. Um, it was just
[1:20:12] fitting. I heard uh brother Quinton
[1:20:14] speaking on u just how uh Kane's uh
[1:20:18] leash had to have all all the in
[1:20:21] medicine and advancements and um it's
[1:20:24] actually a part of my testimony of just
[1:20:27] thanking God. Um so my oldest son Xavier
[1:20:31] um he had a real back stigmatism in his
[1:20:34] eye. Um we took him to a doctor right
[1:20:37] here off of Okachobee. Um and he had
[1:20:41] been a few times and doctor like, "Yeah,
[1:20:43] you gonna need surgery this and that."
[1:20:44] And I'm like, "Okay." You know, I was I
[1:20:46] didn't go the first couple times, but I
[1:20:48] heard my like in my mind, I'm like,
[1:20:51] "Nah, he ain't going to need no
[1:20:52] surgery." But so he just kept going. He
[1:20:55] kept saying, "Yeah, we'll see him back
[1:20:56] in this many months. We going to check
[1:20:57] it again. Check it again." No changes.
[1:21:00] No changes. And I one day I went
[1:21:03] actually I took off from work and I went
[1:21:05] up there. We all went and I seen the
[1:21:07] gentle, we waited in this room. It was
[1:21:09] real crowded. Seen a gentleman and we
[1:21:11] went in the room. He's like, "Yeah, he's
[1:21:13] going to need surgery." And I was like,
[1:21:15] "Well, is the surgery going to actually
[1:21:17] fix it or is it like cosmetic?" Um, he
[1:21:20] was just explaining, "Yeah, it's only
[1:21:22] going to fix part of it, but I said,
[1:21:23] "So, it's not going to actually fix the
[1:21:25] issue." He's like, "No." I was like,
[1:21:27] "Well, that's cosmetic. He don't need
[1:21:29] it." Um, he's like, "No, he need it. He
[1:21:31] need it. He need it." And he's like,
[1:21:33] he's like, he told my he told my wife
[1:21:35] just like this, "Mom, don't listen to
[1:21:36] him. He need it. He need it." And I'm
[1:21:38] like, "He's just telling my wife not to
[1:21:39] listen to me." um that that was the
[1:21:42] first thing in my mind. But you know, I
[1:21:44] just and usually in those situations,
[1:21:46] you know, that it it it catches by
[1:21:49] surprise. So, I had to kind of all
[1:21:51] right, God, what what did he just say?
[1:21:53] Like I had to run it again just to make
[1:21:55] sure, you know, I you know, sometimes we
[1:21:57] we get in our feelings. So, I just
[1:21:59] wanted to make sure I was like And he
[1:22:00] said it again. I was like, "Okay." After
[1:22:03] that, I didn't even say anything to him
[1:22:05] and we left. Right after we left, I told
[1:22:07] Mar, "Yeah, he need we need to find him
[1:22:08] a new doctor quick." Um, so, uh, so we
[1:22:14] and then a whole thing going well. She
[1:22:16] was supposed to take him back for a
[1:22:18] checkup and something happened with his
[1:22:19] insurance where we couldn't even go back
[1:22:21] to him anything. Um, we just had a hard
[1:22:23] time trying to find a certain doctor and
[1:22:25] and Lord actually um put it on my my
[1:22:29] sister-in-law's heart to talk to my wife
[1:22:30] about a certain doctor and we had to
[1:22:32] drive down to Hollywood in Miami to go
[1:22:34] to a specialist. Um, so he'd been going
[1:22:37] there for a little bit. We just went,
[1:22:38] what was that about a month ago, maybe
[1:22:40] less, a couple weeks ago. Um, so we went
[1:22:44] down there. She checked them first time.
[1:22:45] First time we went, something happened
[1:22:47] where the insurance didn't carry over or
[1:22:50] something. So we had to leave. We d I
[1:22:52] drove all the way down to Miami on my
[1:22:53] off day. Drove all the way down there,
[1:22:56] came all the way back. I'm like, "It's
[1:22:57] okay." So, we actually went um just
[1:22:59] previously um to where she seen him
[1:23:02] again. She was like, and she she sat in
[1:23:04] the chair. She's like, "Dad, this is
[1:23:06] this is really good. He doesn't need
[1:23:08] surgery."
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; She said, she was like, "It's really
[1:23:12] good." Like, she was like, "No, just
[1:23:13] keep doing it." And I went, "Thank you,
[1:23:15] Lord, one for for for me not being upset
[1:23:18] and going off on the man. you know, I
[1:23:20] won't gonna cuss at him, but you know,
[1:23:22] it's it's, you know, it come to my wife,
[1:23:24] Lord, you know, um, but just just just
[1:23:27] thanking God because just just me not
[1:23:30] accepting what that man told me. It was
[1:23:32] never a doubt in my mind that he was
[1:23:34] going to need surgery and and for for
[1:23:36] just for that to happen, just say, "God,
[1:23:38] thank you." Because it's it's you all
[1:23:39] the way in every area. So, thank you,
[1:23:41] Jesus. Even if I have to drive to
[1:23:42] Alaska, Lord, just for your blessing,
[1:23:45] I'll go get it.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; So, God bless y'all.
[1:23:50] Praise the Lord. Thank God for his
[1:23:54] provision. Amen. And that. All right.
[1:23:57] God bless you, brother.
[1:24:07] God bless you tonight. Um, just speaking
[1:24:09] about the grace of God. I should have
[1:24:10] gave this testimony like a month and a
[1:24:12] half ago. It was the week of the
[1:24:14] meetings and um I was driving um I think
[1:24:16] it was down Simon Pratt I believe and I
[1:24:20] was in a hurry to get home. I was
[1:24:22] probably going like 15 over and this cop
[1:24:25] was undercover and I saw him and I was
[1:24:28] like uh oh I'm in trouble. So hit the
[1:24:32] lights on, stop me. He's like you know
[1:24:34] what you're being pulled over for. I
[1:24:36] knew but I was like no what am I being
[1:24:37] pulled over for? know I'm being pulled
[1:24:40] over for. He's like, you know, he's
[1:24:42] going 15 and you're going 15 over. I was
[1:24:44] like, I was I just told him like, you
[1:24:46] know, I was just ready to get home. I'm
[1:24:47] tired. And I'm thinking in my mind, I'm
[1:24:49] like, Lord, you you know, I deserve this
[1:24:51] ticket. You know, I was going 15 over. I
[1:24:54] can't dispute it. So, he comes back, I'm
[1:24:56] going to give you a warning. Not going
[1:24:58] to give you a ticket. And I just was
[1:25:00] like, wow. You know, just the grace of
[1:25:02] God just, you know, talking about it
[1:25:04] tonight cuz I literally I was ready to
[1:25:06] get like a $200 ticket or however it was
[1:25:08] going to be. And I was ready, you know,
[1:25:09] Lord, I'm going to pay it cuz I deserve
[1:25:11] it. But, you know, the grace of God
[1:25:12] allowed the officer cuz I I just handled
[1:25:15] it cool. I didn't I didn't I wasn't rude
[1:25:16] to the officer. I was just like, you
[1:25:19] know, you know, just just acted, you
[1:25:21] know, real nice to him. And he came back
[1:25:23] and just gave me a warning. I I still
[1:25:25] got the ticket in my car, like the the
[1:25:27] warning part of it. I for a reminder so
[1:25:30] I don't go
[1:25:32] so I don't go 15 over again. So, but uh
[1:25:34] just just, you know, testify on the
[1:25:36] grace of God. I should have gave this
[1:25:37] testimony weeks a month month and a half
[1:25:39] ago, but just to just testify how God
[1:25:41] how good God to is to us even when we do
[1:25:45] something like that, you know, his his
[1:25:46] grace protects us. So, but definitely
[1:25:48] don't do it again cuz
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:57] Certainly thank God for that grace,
[1:25:58] brother.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I uh I've been down that road
[1:26:03] myself before, so I know what that's
[1:26:06] like. God God is good. Amen. Anybody
[1:26:10] else want to share uh tonight um before
[1:26:13] we Okay, come on, brother.
[1:26:22] God bless you saints. Uh it's a
[1:26:26] testimony that occurred today. Um, so
[1:26:30] started last night. I was on my way home
[1:26:32] and my wife reached out to me and asked
[1:26:34] me to stop by and get a few things um
[1:26:37] before I before I got home. I was
[1:26:39] looking for my wallet and I couldn't
[1:26:41] locate it anywhere. Um, first thing that
[1:26:43] came to mind is I forgot it at work. Uh,
[1:26:47] so I told myself the next day I just go
[1:26:50] in and and just pick it up. So, I went
[1:26:53] to work and when I got there, I couldn't
[1:26:55] find it. And I was pretty certain that
[1:26:58] it was there and I looked everywhere and
[1:27:01] and I just said a short quick prayer and
[1:27:04] I just said, "Lord, um I know it's not
[1:27:07] at the house, uh but I know that faith
[1:27:10] can put it there." And I just prayed. I
[1:27:13] said, "Lord, just help me find it
[1:27:15] wherever it is." And I just started to
[1:27:17] make a few phone calls, retrace my
[1:27:20] steps, and within that same hour, uh,
[1:27:23] brother called me that I was with and
[1:27:25] told me he had found my wallet.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So, I want to thank God for that.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:35] Uh, that's a that's a a real blessing. I
[1:27:38] I I was thinking on uh Brother Billy
[1:27:42] Paul, him and his wife were here and and
[1:27:45] I believe it was down in Miami somewhere
[1:27:47] one time visiting and they were just
[1:27:49] walking along the beach and she she lost
[1:27:51] her ring and uh he prayed a very similar
[1:27:55] prayer like Lord all all this sand on
[1:27:57] the beach.
[1:27:58] God, I I need I need to find her ring
[1:28:01] and I don't know where it is on this
[1:28:03] beach, but I'm just trusting that you'll
[1:28:05] bring it to us. And all he did was just
[1:28:07] dig down his hands in the sand. And when
[1:28:10] he come up, that ring come up uh with
[1:28:13] him. See, these are the things that
[1:28:15] brother uh Quinton was just talking
[1:28:18] about. As believers, things should be
[1:28:20] different for us.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; We got God on our side, right? So, we we
[1:28:25] have to we have to expect these type of
[1:28:27] things from our God. So, uh thank God,
[1:28:30] uh brother, that he he helped you find
[1:28:33] that wallet. Amen. Anybody else before
[1:28:35] we uh leave tonight? All right. Okay.
[1:28:40] All right. So, um
[1:28:45] yeah.
