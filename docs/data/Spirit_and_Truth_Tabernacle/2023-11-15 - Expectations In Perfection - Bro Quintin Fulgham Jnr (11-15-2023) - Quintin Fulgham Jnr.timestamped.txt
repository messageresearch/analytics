[8:06] [Applause]
[8:09] [Music]
[8:25] [Music]
[8:26] [Applause]
[8:28] I
[8:32] [Music]
[8:37] amen amen amen amen it's a it's it's
[8:43] it's this song is the is the Christians
[8:46] Anthem and I'm pretty sure that as all
[8:49] of us can look back in our lives we can
[8:51] see that it was nothing but Grace uh not
[8:54] how good you were not how much you knew
[8:57] uh there's a lot of people in the world
[8:59] that that know a lot about the Bible
[9:00] they know a lot about the message uh
[9:02] they know a lot about the things of God
[9:04] but it's uh it's Grace to know God to
[9:08] have a relationship with him right and
[9:11] the only reason that God can come down
[9:13] and have a relationship with you see I
[9:15] like to look as God not as a god he's a
[9:18] prideful not pride in the in the sense
[9:20] of being like a negative Pride but he
[9:23] only respects himself so the only way he
[9:26] could have a relationship with me and
[9:27] you is if we were in him before the
[9:29] foundation of the world so we're not
[9:33] just walking on this Earth as human
[9:35] beings right God has his eyes on us all
[9:38] right so I kind of glad we sang that
[9:40] song because it kind of fits into the
[9:43] message of today um I previously
[9:45] preached on the um uh this expectation
[9:48] series that I've been uh we've been
[9:50] having and this is a closing message to
[9:52] that so we've gone through the valley uh
[9:55] we've got our expectations in the battle
[9:57] and uh the title that the Lord lord gave
[9:59] me today was uh expectations in
[10:01] Perfection and so you always have to end
[10:04] things with perfection because that is
[10:07] the plan in the mind of God Amen so
[10:09] we're going to go right to the scripture
[10:11] readings for this uh our first scripture
[10:14] reading is going to come out of Matthew
[10:16] 5 verse
[10:18] 48 and just say Amen when you get
[10:25] there
[10:28] amen and it reads be ye therefore
[10:31] perfect even as your father which in
[10:34] heaven is perfect and I love this Bible
[10:38] verse it's very very very uh uh uh I
[10:41] like how it's it's instructing someone
[10:44] right because uh uh Perfection is an
[10:47] expectation of God and God loves to be
[10:50] around things that are perfect nothing
[10:52] else will suffice so here God is giving
[10:55] instructions of course this Jesus Christ
[10:56] giving instructions he said be therefore
[10:58] perfect even as your father so there we
[11:01] find that our Perfection we have
[11:04] identity in the father and he saidh he
[11:07] wasn't just a father from any place he
[11:09] said he was from Heaven all right amen
[11:11] so we have identity through this Father
[11:13] which is in heaven who is perfect and
[11:16] that's where our Perfection lies on
[11:18] we're not just living down on Earth
[11:20] trying to be good people or be good
[11:22] Christians or say that we've uh uh we've
[11:24] done all these things for the Lord no we
[11:27] are perfect and if our if we are to be
[11:30] perfect as our heavenly father as
[11:31] perfect it means that we've already been
[11:34] perfect amen no matter what we're going
[11:36] through all right we're going to read
[11:37] our second Bible verse in uh The Book of
[11:40] Proverbs it's going to be uh chapter 24
[11:43] verse
[11:51] 16 and we're just going to read the uh
[11:55] this uh statement until about the middle
[11:57] of it it says for just man falleth seven
[12:00] times and riseth up again and we know
[12:04] that the prophet also had said uh uh
[12:07] that a righteous man falls seven times
[12:10] uh but Rises up again and we know that
[12:12] the righteousness is not based off of us
[12:15] but of God you may take your seats it's
[12:18] based off of God's righteousness right
[12:21] amen so it's kind of it's kind of funny
[12:23] to see this statement uh because we know
[12:26] that the word of God was God's word and
[12:28] it was his word before the foundation of
[12:30] the world where he was telling us to be
[12:32] perfect but here he's saying that a just
[12:35] man falls seven times so how can you be
[12:38] perfect and fall all right how can you
[12:41] be perfect and fall all right right uh
[12:43] uh and there lies a mystery of what
[12:46] Perfection is so Perfection is the
[12:49] ultimate goal in a Christian's life uh
[12:52] it's the state that we're trying to get
[12:54] back to we've gone through the
[12:56] expectations in the battle we've gone
[12:58] through the expectations in the valley
[13:00] uh and and that's all just for us to see
[13:03] to understand and to appreciate what
[13:05] Perfection is right so our first
[13:08] expectation of perfection is just that
[13:12] to understand what it is and it's not
[13:14] through a conceptual thought or some
[13:16] theology or some fancy words but your
[13:20] Perfection will come through your life
[13:22] and what you've lived and that will
[13:24] allow you to appreciate it right because
[13:27] people get perfection stumbled up as if
[13:30] it's something that you have to do right
[13:32] so you have a lot of people that join
[13:34] church because oh well I want to get to
[13:36] heaven oh I have to be a good person I
[13:38] can't lie I can't steal I can't cheat I
[13:40] got to wear a long skirt I got to do all
[13:42] these things and though those things are
[13:44] signs of perfection it's not Perfection
[13:47] itself amen it is not Perfection itself
[13:50] you see Perfection isn't something that
[13:52] you're necessarily trying to get really
[13:55] Perfection is something to be
[13:57] appreciated because you haven't gained
[13:59] Perfection you've already had it but now
[14:02] God wants you to appreciate what it is
[14:05] that's why I love the song uh growing up
[14:07] with my um when I was growing up with me
[14:09] and my little sister and we would go
[14:10] over our dad's he would play the CD by
[14:13] uh sister Brenda Lewis and there was a
[14:15] song on there that said you've already
[14:17] made it that's something that kind of uh
[14:19] I I still have remember the lyrics to it
[14:22] amen and and and I like how she was able
[14:25] to catch the anointing of God to know
[14:28] that Perfection is is is is happening
[14:31] now it's and it's always been and it's
[14:33] and it's not something that you've
[14:35] you've uh uh you've gained through being
[14:37] good or or or a service for God but
[14:40] because God loved you before the
[14:41] foundation of the world which is why we
[14:42] sing Amazing Grace amen so now we're
[14:45] going to read from the message
[14:47] Perfection um and you have to go when
[14:49] you talk about perfection Perfection you
[14:51] have to go back to see what the prophet
[14:53] said about it so we're going to see his
[14:55] message in
[14:56] 5661 0 and it's going to be paragraphs
[14:59] 25 through 27 is what we're going to
[15:05] read all right I just start reading it
[15:08] now so it says here the prophet says now
[15:11] beginning again now with the first verse
[15:12] let's go back last Saturday we thought
[15:15] we'd get to the subject of perfection so
[15:19] here is the prophet in his mind in his
[15:20] plan he's he's he's okay we're going to
[15:22] talk about
[15:24] perfection let's see what he says but
[15:26] then God moved us back and got for
[15:28] knowledge
[15:29] showing us where that before the world
[15:31] was ever formed how many was here last
[15:33] Sunday let's see your hand did you get
[15:34] it before the world was ever form we
[15:37] were placed in Christ think of it so you
[15:40] can't talk about perfection without forn
[15:43] knowledge for knowledge means that God
[15:46] knew you amen amen God knew your
[15:48] characteristics God knew your strengths
[15:51] God knew your weaknesses the prophet
[15:53] said he said I still love you amen right
[15:57] that is real Perfection it's not you
[15:58] trying to obtain anything so as we
[16:01] continue reading it says God being
[16:03] infinite who cannot lie cannot speak
[16:05] anything contrary knows everything just
[16:08] as perfect at the beginning as he is at
[16:10] as he is at the ending and just as
[16:12] perfect at the end as he was the
[16:14] beginning God is endless like eternity
[16:17] you can never find the corner of a
[16:19] perfect circle you could run and run
[16:21] through ages in eternity and there never
[16:23] never be an end to it and there there's
[16:26] and that's the way God is so I love the
[16:29] way he describes this circle of Eternity
[16:32] because it shows that uh you can run
[16:35] through all the ages and you can run
[16:37] your life from situation and from day to
[16:40] day but you can never outrun God if you
[16:42] came from God right it means that every
[16:45] single decision that you make you think
[16:48] you're making it in yourself but God
[16:50] before the foundation of the world had a
[16:53] had a path laid out for you and
[16:55] predestinated you to walk in this path
[16:57] whether you like like it or not which is
[17:00] a beautiful thing right because it also
[17:02] shows love right so we're going to
[17:03] continue reading and there never never
[17:05] an end to it he's talking about eternity
[17:07] and that's the way God is and when he be
[17:09] first was God which always was he was
[17:11] infinite perfect to begin with and he'll
[17:13] always be the same he never can change
[17:16] he is perfectly the same and that gives
[17:18] us faith that no matter what we deal
[17:21] with in life God will always love us and
[17:24] that is the that is the foundation of
[17:27] Christianity
[17:29] not that I'm trying to be good but
[17:31] because God fornew me and called me uh
[17:34] uh and saved me that no matter what I'm
[17:36] going through what no matter what I've
[17:39] gone through no matter what I'm
[17:40] currently going through and no matter
[17:42] what I'll go through God is God's
[17:44] opinion of me or my or or his thought of
[17:47] me will never change so that's why he
[17:49] had to say in the Bible that he's not a
[17:51] god of the past or God of the future he
[17:53] said I I am the god I am right now
[17:56] meaning currently in your situation what
[17:58] what you're going through he's still the
[18:00] same and his thoughts for you have not
[18:03] changed amen so and we read in uh this
[18:06] 27th paragraph it says now this great
[18:08] chain of perfection was broken by time
[18:11] space time came because of sin let's
[18:14] draw a picture of time let's see A
[18:16] Perfect Circle forever forever forever
[18:19] and then all at once sin dropped in and
[18:21] put a little as my wife calls it a
[18:23] little hickey or a little drop in the
[18:25] chain so it comes down eternity comes
[18:27] Contin on but it's not in its perfect
[18:30] condition here's a little Gap comes down
[18:32] breaks over this way goes out this way
[18:34] God had to do that because Satan caused
[18:37] it and it dropped down to the space of
[18:39] time for the trying and perfecting and
[18:42] for the purging uh of the lost that God
[18:45] by a Sovereign Grace might someday lift
[18:47] that little hickey or Gap back into the
[18:49] perfect circle then she rolls on just
[18:52] the same you see it amen so I like this
[18:56] because
[18:57] um I'm going to have I'm going to say a
[18:59] statement here that's going to have uh
[19:01] going we're going to focus on that word
[19:03] appreciation for a moment uh and so
[19:06] before the foundation of the world we
[19:09] couldn't appreciate what Perfection was
[19:11] all right and when God created the
[19:13] garden it it we also we didn't also
[19:16] appreciate what Perfection was still
[19:18] even in the garden so we have this
[19:21] appreciation and uh I've said twice and
[19:23] there's a context context behind both of
[19:26] the meetings that will help us to
[19:27] understand so before the foundation of
[19:30] the world we couldn't appreciate
[19:32] Perfection because there wasn't a
[19:34] contrast all right there was nothing to
[19:37] show us really what Perfection was right
[19:39] so before the foundation of the world
[19:41] God said I'm a Healer and we jumped up
[19:44] and said we believe you God said I'm a
[19:46] deliverer I'm a mighty conqueror I'm the
[19:48] Prince of Peace and we jumped up with
[19:50] joy God had a smile on his face we all
[19:52] had a smile on our face we said God we
[19:54] believe you God we believe you God said
[19:57] I am perfect and you are my children and
[19:59] you are perfect too no matter what I
[20:02] always love you we jumped up and shouted
[20:04] for joy we said we believe you God it's
[20:06] why uh uh in the Bible when job was
[20:09] going through his trials God told job
[20:11] where were you before the foundation of
[20:12] the world was the sons of God jump for
[20:15] joy see we were already worshiping God
[20:18] for who he was before this thing started
[20:22] right but it's a um but that there was
[20:25] something in the back of the mind of God
[20:27] and also in the back of of our minds
[20:29] where there was there was an
[20:31] anticipation there was an anticipation
[20:33] because we were already in a perfect
[20:35] State as the prophet said the circle was
[20:37] just uh uh going round and round and
[20:39] round and there were no Hicks inside of
[20:41] it so we there was an anticipation in
[20:43] the backside of the mind of God and also
[20:46] our in our mind to see the manifestation
[20:49] of what was said right in order and and
[20:52] what that means is just to um to
[20:55] appreciate the words uh of what was
[20:57] being said said because since there was
[20:59] no contrast the opposite of Love is hate
[21:02] and so we didn't know what hate was
[21:05] because you have to understand that when
[21:06] we talk about where God was perfect so
[21:09] before he became God he was just the
[21:12] self-existing one right and we were
[21:14] already inside of him there was no such
[21:17] thing as hate there was no such thing as
[21:19] sickness so there was no contrast to
[21:22] show uh uh the love of God right there
[21:25] was no contrast to show the love of God
[21:27] and God wanted us to appreciate who he
[21:30] was uh in these things so um I went
[21:33] online and I looked at the um looked
[21:35] into this uh dictionary called the
[21:36] Oxford language to look at what the
[21:39] definition of appreciate means and
[21:41] appreciate we have three meanings here
[21:43] that they gave us it says to recognize
[21:45] the full worth of to understand a
[21:48] situation fully and I like how it says
[21:51] full yes so it's not part right we're
[21:54] not we're not trying to uh uh un
[21:57] understand God and part cuz a lot of
[21:58] times we walk on our Christian like and
[22:00] we don't ever want to get sick right we
[22:02] want to believe he's a Healer but we
[22:04] don't never want to get sick but that's
[22:06] not recognizing the full worth of God
[22:10] amen amen no God wants you to appreciate
[22:14] every aspect of him and that's why you
[22:17] have to go through what you go through
[22:19] that's right amen praise God so we have
[22:22] the next we have the next definition
[22:24] which is to be grateful for something
[22:26] all right all right and we couldn't be
[22:28] grateful for the love of God while we
[22:30] were sitting up there in Perfection
[22:32] because there was no challenge in that
[22:35] domain there was nothing to challenge
[22:37] the love all right and God and and Not
[22:40] only was God A Healer but God was a
[22:42] conqueror which means that it was in him
[22:44] to uh uh confront a challenge but we
[22:47] were there and he couldn't challenge us
[22:49] because we were the same as him right so
[22:53] uh God had written the Bible a Bible
[22:55] verse because we have to understand that
[22:57] everything God wrote in the Bible was
[22:58] written before the foundation of the
[23:00] world and there was a Bible verse that
[23:02] God WR that said that God wrote that
[23:04] said faith without works is
[23:07] dead right faith without works is dead
[23:10] so when God spoke those words before the
[23:12] foundation of the world that he was a
[23:14] Healer and that he loved us and we
[23:16] believed him he now had to prove it
[23:19] because it was Faith what is faith faith
[23:21] is just God's word it's not something
[23:24] that's uh uh so so hard for people
[23:28] understand faith is God's word and when
[23:29] he says his word that's it you just
[23:32] believe it because it's going to happen
[23:34] right you don't have to do anything but
[23:36] just get yourself out the way right so
[23:39] you see the valleys and the battles that
[23:42] we go through in life it's something
[23:44] that we already agreed to it's something
[23:47] that we already agreed to in the
[23:49] beginning and my dad my dad told me that
[23:51] one time he was saying you accepted this
[23:54] fight you accepted these things and I
[23:57] can so I can see if we could put a
[23:59] dramatization on on brother Moses as he
[24:01] went to the Red Sea and it was closed up
[24:05] and the children of Israel were on his
[24:07] back and they was Moses we should we
[24:09] would have been better off in Egypt and
[24:11] Moses was just frustrated and crying out
[24:13] to God you see God had made a covenant
[24:16] before the foundation of the world
[24:17] before Moses went through what he went
[24:19] through and if you notice anybody if we
[24:21] could take some drama uh add some drama
[24:23] to that situation I can see while Moses
[24:26] is down there crying I can see uh God
[24:28] open up a file cabinet and pull out
[24:30] Moses's file right and maybe put some
[24:33] glasses on and go down and and it
[24:37] said I will believe you for the opening
[24:39] of a red sea and right next to it was
[24:42] Moses name signed and God and so that's
[24:45] why a lot of times when you're going
[24:47] through your battles God can't look at
[24:49] what your flesh is
[24:51] saying God can't look at what your flesh
[24:54] is saying because before the foundation
[24:56] of the world you signed a contract and
[24:58] agreed with God that you would go
[25:01] through what you're going through so a
[25:03] lot of time so when you're on that when
[25:04] you're on that that bed of Affliction
[25:07] right and you're facing something that
[25:09] seems impossible remember there was a
[25:12] contract that was written not just for
[25:15] your sake to remember that you have a
[25:17] part to play but also remember that God
[25:19] is constantly checking those files to
[25:22] make sure that he can fulfill what he
[25:24] said because it wasn't just your
[25:26] signature on it it was God signature
[25:28] there uh too as well hallelujah amen so
[25:32] our second appreciation as I said before
[25:35] is that when we even got into the when
[25:37] we got into the garden it showed that we
[25:39] didn't appreciate it so God created the
[25:42] uh Garden of Eden in the beginning and
[25:43] it was also perfect it was also perfect
[25:47] right uh uh but man wanted something
[25:51] else man wanted something else and God
[25:55] allowed it to be that way it wasn't like
[25:58] you know when brother brandom talks
[25:59] about the circle being broke with that
[26:01] hickey coming down and breaking the
[26:03] circle you know you could see it as if
[26:04] you're driving on the road and your uh
[26:06] uh and your car hits a hits a rock and
[26:08] Pops the tire and all of a sudden you're
[26:10] like oh wow you're surprised that these
[26:13] Hicks that happened didn't surprise God
[26:16] God knew it would happen and needed it
[26:18] to happen in order for us to appreciate
[26:20] the Perfection that we had in the
[26:22] beginning right so he had to make us in
[26:26] a in a weaker formed than what we were
[26:29] right in order for him to prove himself
[26:31] to us because when we were in that
[26:34] domain where it was a self-existing one
[26:36] we were looking at God eye to
[26:39] eye because God wasn't a god of worship
[26:42] during that time right and so we were
[26:45] God with God right and when we came down
[26:49] into the uh into the garden then you see
[26:51] that then you see that Adam began to
[26:53] worship God uh uh and Adam and Eve began
[26:56] to worship God on the cool of evening
[26:57] but I could even still see you know Adam
[27:00] just looking God right in the face
[27:02] saying Hey Dad how how' your day go
[27:04] how's everything going right but God
[27:07] needed to be a a a champion for Davis I
[27:11] mean for for Adam so he had to make Adam
[27:14] look up so he had to make him in a way
[27:16] where he could come down and be weaker
[27:19] to look up to God because he was looking
[27:21] at God face to face but God couldn't
[27:23] show he was a conqueror or he was uh
[27:27] someone that uh could be Dependable
[27:29] while God while Adam who was perfect was
[27:31] the same as God so we still couldn't
[27:35] appreciate uh uh uh the attributes of
[27:37] God uh um in the garden so God gave us a
[27:41] weakness and the weakness that God gave
[27:43] us was the ability to make
[27:45] choices and so you see it today when you
[27:48] watch the news you go on Instagram on
[27:50] social media man makes choices and the
[27:53] world is just in chaos choice is a
[27:58] weakness to a man choice is a weakness
[28:01] to a man but when a man puts his choice
[28:04] in God it then becomes a strength it
[28:07] then becomes something that's perfect
[28:09] which is why even though we have
[28:11] medicine the way that we do and we think
[28:13] our doctors for the sacrifice that they
[28:16] make and the knowledge and wisdom that
[28:17] God has given them but even in uh uh
[28:21] that decision um it's still not perfect
[28:25] it's still not a a a perfection because
[28:28] now they've created uh antibiotics for
[28:30] bacteria but now with the uh with those
[28:34] antibiotics it's it's created super bugs
[28:37] now right so you see even though man is
[28:40] striving to uh uh to overcome and to win
[28:43] it's still shows that we're not looking
[28:45] at all the variables but when you place
[28:47] your faith in God God has everything
[28:50] lined up and imp plan for you and you
[28:52] don't have to worry about a thing right
[28:54] so he gave us this weakness and that
[28:57] weakness was the ability to make choices
[28:59] wow so God allowed sin uh to have a
[29:03] purpose in Breaking the Chain of
[29:05] perfection because when sin broke that
[29:07] chain all it did was open up a door for
[29:10] God to step into and put on a roll put
[29:13] on a hat right to prove that we were
[29:16] perfect and we could appreciate it you
[29:18] see when Eve sinned it opened up doors
[29:21] of opportunity yes we know that it was
[29:23] sin yes we know that she shouldn't have
[29:25] done it but it opened up doors of
[29:27] opportunity and the first uh door of
[29:29] opportunity was Adam because Adam got to
[29:32] Eve first before God and Adam saw Eve in
[29:35] that state and he could have just put
[29:37] her away right but you remember Adam was
[29:40] perfect in himself right and he chose to
[29:43] eat the fruit of course we know the ACT
[29:45] he did with Eve and he did that because
[29:48] he loved her and he knew that if he
[29:51] wouldn't have done that God would have
[29:52] came and put her away and so we can
[29:55] already see now in that m mistake and
[29:58] that situation where other people would
[30:00] have kind of looked down on it we can
[30:02] already see God turn their mistake into
[30:05] a foreshadow of what was to come right
[30:09] right it wasn't them being perfect as a
[30:12] a standing necessarily uh standing up to
[30:14] the word of God but it was God being
[30:17] able to come down and turn their
[30:19] situation around amen so there's
[30:22] situation uh uh even though we know it
[30:25] was sin uh uh the act the what they did
[30:28] after the fact it prophesied of the
[30:30] coming Christ all right and I'm here to
[30:32] tell you today that the situations that
[30:34] you go through and the mistakes that you
[30:35] go through a lot of times we feel like
[30:38] uh uh God is not with us God is not here
[30:41] but God has a way of turning your
[30:44] choices to glorify him and we see that
[30:47] throughout the whole entire Bible so
[30:50] that's why Paul could Paul could Paul
[30:53] could say these things neither height
[30:55] neither depth nothing can say separated
[30:57] from the love of God because even in our
[31:00] weakness our weaknesses Still Point to
[31:02] God and give him glory right it still
[31:05] gives him glory so the next opportunity
[31:08] that we see is uh after God had passed
[31:11] judgment to the serpent into the eve and
[31:14] God couldn't pass judgment to Adam
[31:16] because he was perfect so he cursed the
[31:18] ground right the Bible says he killed a
[31:20] lamb and he wrapped it around them and
[31:24] you see uh actions your actions can uh
[31:27] uh have a language in their own self
[31:30] right and so my dad I remember when I
[31:32] was younger and my dad uh I thought I
[31:35] could get a little bit smart and so I
[31:37] wouldn't say nothing back to my dad when
[31:39] he would say something but so then when
[31:41] he would say something IID just throw
[31:42] some body language and I still get hit
[31:46] and I'll be
[31:47] like Dad why' you hit me I didn't say
[31:50] nothing he said you're right your body
[31:52] say something your body language say
[31:56] something amen so your actions uh uh uh
[32:00] not only do your actions speak to your
[32:02] parents but your actions also are
[32:04] speaking to Christ amen just as Christ's
[32:07] actions are speaking to you he may not
[32:09] say much but he's going to do something
[32:12] he'll do something in your life right so
[32:15] when God sacrificed this lamb and then
[32:19] he told uh he told Adam and Eve to come
[32:22] and he wrapped this lamb around him I
[32:24] could see the language being passed uh
[32:27] to Adam and Eve uh God speaking to his
[32:29] children I told you I love you no matter
[32:32] what now God wasn't smiling this time
[32:34] because it was a serious situation but
[32:37] the Covenant still stayed the same and
[32:40] as Adam and Eve were leading leaving the
[32:42] garden they were now in a in a in a
[32:44] state of fearfulness because they didn't
[32:47] know what was going to happen because
[32:49] theyd never seen sin before they never
[32:51] seen sickness before they never seen uh
[32:53] uh family troubles before they never had
[32:56] these things so there was an uncertainty
[32:57] on them a dark cloud that was on them
[32:59] but I could see through the depths of
[33:01] their soul when God wrapped that lamb
[33:03] around them to give them some confidence
[33:06] to show that I always love you I could
[33:08] see them saying we believe you Daddy
[33:11] even though this even though they
[33:13] weren't smiling and jumping for joy like
[33:15] they were in the beginning of the word
[33:17] uh uh beginning before the foundation of
[33:19] the world but now they could appreciate
[33:22] this side of love because before in
[33:24] Perfection it was all jumping in joy and
[33:27] shouting but this side of love was God
[33:30] wasn't smiling anymore but still loved
[33:33] him am he still love them because of the
[33:35] Covenant that he made for them you can
[33:38] only be you have to be perfect in order
[33:40] for God to look at you and your mistakes
[33:43] and say that he loves
[33:44] you right it's not you keeping yourself
[33:47] but it's God keeping
[33:49] us right their circum their their
[33:52] circumstances didn't change God's mind
[33:55] right it only f further proved his love
[33:58] for them right that should give us
[34:00] confident when we fall and make mistakes
[34:03] that even though I know I did wrong I
[34:05] know Daddy's going to turn it around
[34:07] somehow God Amen so we want to look at
[34:10] our second expectation uh imperfection
[34:14] and that is the way God designed you has
[34:16] a role in your path to appreciate your
[34:19] Perfection and we're going to prove it
[34:21] by the scriptures we're going to turn to
[34:22] Psalm 37 and we're going to read verses
[34:25] 23- 24
[34:28] four and just tell say Amen once you get
[34:37] there all right so it reads it reads the
[34:40] good steps or the right steps or the
[34:43] correct steps of a good man are ordered
[34:45] by the Lord it does not say that it says
[34:49] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[34:53] the Lord a lot of times we think that
[34:56] it's only God is only with us when we're
[34:58] doing good or when we're uh uh uh living
[35:02] according to his word and to his
[35:03] standards but the Bible says the steps
[35:05] of a good man and that good man and the
[35:08] righteous man is God's righteousness on
[35:10] you which is how he's how he's viewing
[35:12] you which was before the foundation of
[35:14] the L of the of the world so it says the
[35:16] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[35:18] Lord and he delighteth in his way though
[35:22] he fall he shall not be utterly cast
[35:25] down for the Lord upholdeth him with his
[35:28] hand amenallah you going to
[35:31] fall you're going to fall God prophesied
[35:35] it and you can't go against his
[35:38] word God prophesied that you would fall
[35:41] but the thing that he want you to do is
[35:43] to come back that's the key step is to
[35:47] come back you see when that woman um
[35:50] when that woman came to Jesus and they
[35:51] were all accusing her of being a
[35:53] prostitute and Christ had come down uh
[35:56] uh in perfect love uh uh and we know
[35:59] that the Bible verses before that is
[36:02] when when Whenever there was someone
[36:03] caught in adultery or something like
[36:04] that they were to Stone her and Jesus
[36:07] just ignored everything that was being
[36:09] said and he wrote in the ground and he
[36:12] said he who was without sin cast the
[36:14] first stone and of course everyone had
[36:16] to everyone had to go away and it said
[36:18] from the old to the young meaning that
[36:19] you're going to make mistakes whether
[36:21] you're young whether you're old a lot of
[36:22] times we try to look at people and say
[36:25] oh well they've been in church for a s
[36:26] so and so long they're still making
[36:28] mistakes everybody is making mistakes
[36:31] and so when they left her Jesus told her
[36:34] where are thy
[36:37] accusers but the key thing that he said
[36:39] next was neither do I judge you go and
[36:42] sin no more right there was an
[36:46] expectation that yeah I see that you
[36:47] fell but don't get back up and do the
[36:50] same thing again amen right and that's
[36:52] how you know the
[36:54] steps of a righteous man are order by
[36:56] the Lord we no longer have the desire to
[36:58] sin anymore right so we're going to dig
[37:01] a little deep into this
[37:03] expectation uh because the Bible says
[37:05] that God designed and made you the way
[37:07] that you are and we're going to go back
[37:09] into the garden because what a lot of
[37:12] people don't realize and and why it it
[37:15] and it's and it's the reason why the
[37:16] prophet had to um God had to take the
[37:19] mind of a prophet in order to show us
[37:22] what the truth was because Eve the a lot
[37:25] of times the prophet he said when he saw
[37:27] people uh paint pictures of Eve Eve and
[37:30] stuff like that they showed her as this
[37:31] ugly cavewoman or something like that
[37:34] the prophet described that as the
[37:36] ignorance or the carnal mind of man the
[37:39] Bible says Eve was beautiful Prophet
[37:42] said that Eve was beautiful and God made
[37:44] her that way and she knew she was
[37:47] beautiful so when when God makes you a
[37:49] certain way you have to use the way that
[37:52] God Made You to glorify God because if
[37:55] you don't that's good brother if you
[37:58] don't it'll cause you to make a choice
[38:02] right that'll cause a fall in your life
[38:04] wow that'll cause a fall in your life so
[38:06] it's not that people are um it's not
[38:10] that people are bad in themselves God
[38:12] Made You and in fact we're going to
[38:14] continue on reading this right because
[38:16] um you know a lot of times parents uh um
[38:21] they have an idea of what they want for
[38:22] their kids you know they want to they
[38:24] want them to be smart or they want them
[38:25] to be preaching or they want them to be
[38:27] presidents or scientists and all that
[38:30] they want to be upstanding citizens they
[38:31] want them to be in church all their
[38:33] lives and those are good things because
[38:35] it shows that you're trying to reflect
[38:37] God's characters but God has a mind
[38:39] outside of us right and so we're going
[38:42] to read uh uh in Jeremiah uh 1
[38:45] 14-5 uh just to kind of
[38:48] see uh what God's uh plan was when uh he
[38:52] designed us so just say Amen once you
[38:54] get
[38:55] there we're going to see that uh it's
[38:58] God that does the designing even though
[39:01] you're a parent and you bring the child
[39:03] into the world God designs that
[39:06] child uh uh uh uh specifically for his
[39:10] purpose amen all right so it reads here
[39:12] it says then the word of the Lord came
[39:14] unto me saying before I formed thee in
[39:17] the belly I like that because it it it
[39:20] proves that God is the one that created
[39:23] our personalities our characteristics
[39:26] amen uh uh anything any any any type of
[39:29] thing we look at as a weakness or a
[39:30] strength God did all of it that's right
[39:33] right and next he says before I formed
[39:35] thee in the belly I knew thee and I love
[39:38] it when he he he he ends it with I knew
[39:40] thee because it was before you were
[39:42] formed yes before the foundation of the
[39:44] world there was some for knowledge or
[39:47] knowing or some Perfection so he wanted
[39:50] him to rest just on that just you got a
[39:53] little semic there just to take a little
[39:55] pause right it's important to do that
[39:57] because that should settle you right
[39:59] that should settle you that hold on a
[40:01] second God Made Me The Way I Am A lot of
[40:04] times people look at their
[40:06] characteristics and they Wonder like man
[40:09] why am I this way you ain't make
[40:11] yourself that way God Made You yourself
[40:13] that way I noticed there's something
[40:15] there's some things in my life where
[40:17] it's uh uh for for example it can be
[40:19] hard for me to forgive people because I
[40:21] feel embarrassed about it and I always
[40:23] look at that as a weakness like man why
[40:25] am I always why am I always making
[40:26] mistakes I just don't want to forget but
[40:28] I love the opportunity because it's an
[40:30] opportunity for God to step down in the
[40:33] flesh overcome the weakness and through
[40:36] me forgive so then I can say ah okay now
[40:39] I see Lord you don't want me just to be
[40:42] forgiven just to say I'm forgiven you
[40:43] want to come in me and do it so then it
[40:46] is a perfect forgiveness because a lot
[40:48] of times people forgive but they not
[40:50] forgiven they're not really forgiving
[40:52] you right and it says and before thou
[40:55] camest forth out the womb I Sanctified
[40:58] thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto
[41:01] the Nations so God uh um God makes you
[41:05] uh uh the way that you are we're also
[41:06] going to read uh 1 Samuel uh because
[41:09] this is the attitude that we should have
[41:12] uh and this is just kind of a Sidetrack
[41:13] just off of this expectation right here
[41:15] this is the kind of attitude that have
[41:16] we should have you know when you're
[41:18] raising kids and stuff like that and
[41:20] also when you're um working with youth
[41:22] and things like that or you're working
[41:24] with someone that may be younger than
[41:25] you uh so we're going to read from 1st
[41:27] Samuel uh 1:
[41:31] 10-1 and this is just a uh this is just
[41:34] a story of Hannah where uh the Bible
[41:37] says that God has shut up her womb for
[41:38] her not to have a kid um and we'll see
[41:42] that that was a blessing right that was
[41:44] a blessing in disguise and it says here
[41:47] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[41:49] prayed unto the Lord and wept sore so
[41:52] sometimes your weaknesses right your
[41:55] weaknesses will calls you to look to God
[41:58] and that's the greatest thing that you
[42:00] could do because what it what what it's
[42:02] doing is it's showing the grace and for
[42:05] knowledge of God right it's shown his
[42:07] forn knowledge of you where he's now
[42:09] forfeiting your decision and your choice
[42:12] because it's a weakness in itself and if
[42:14] he would allowed you to choose something
[42:16] it wouldn't have been perfect right and
[42:18] so it says and she vowed a vow and said
[42:21] oh lord of hosts if thou Wilt indeed
[42:23] look on the afflictions of thy handmade
[42:25] and remember me and not forget thy
[42:27] handmate but will give unto thine
[42:29] handmade a Manchild right she was
[42:31] specific in this prayer then I'll give
[42:33] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[42:34] life and there shall no razor uh come
[42:37] upon his head so I love I love this
[42:39] Bible verse because it's important for
[42:41] us as Elders as people that are are that
[42:44] are older when we're looking at the
[42:46] youth Lord what did you make this child
[42:48] to be amen what do you have what do you
[42:51] have for this child not what I want for
[42:54] him a lot of times parents Parents try
[42:56] to make choices for their kids and ends
[42:58] up scarring them in the future right and
[43:01] the kids don't understand why they're
[43:03] going through what they're going through
[43:04] but I loved Hannah Hannah got desperate
[43:06] into a situation and said Lord if you
[43:08] give me a child I'm giving him right
[43:10] back to you and that was a perfect
[43:13] choice right because it produced Samuel
[43:16] a prophet that we know did a perfect
[43:18] work for the Lord amen um so God makes
[43:23] us all different and some of us have one
[43:26] Talent some of us have two talents many
[43:28] talents right and we all have different
[43:30] personalities and characteristics and
[43:32] Perfection is also tied to your work on
[43:36] Earth which is based off the way God
[43:38] designed you that's why it says when
[43:40] you're in the will of God you are
[43:42] perfectly safe when you're in the will
[43:45] of God you are perfectly safe and you
[43:47] are walking perfect when you're outside
[43:49] the will of God hallelujah you don't
[43:51] know what can happen amen so Perfection
[43:54] is tied to your work on on Earth because
[43:57] it keeps you safe on God's word right so
[44:01] we want to take a look at uh um brother
[44:03] Jonah when we look about personalities
[44:05] and stuff so Jonah had the personality
[44:09] of I want to do things my way right
[44:12] Jonah had that personality where he he
[44:14] wanted his idea and ways of doing things
[44:17] and we've all been in the workplace
[44:18] before I was talking to pastor about uh
[44:21] as you begin to work with people you'll
[44:23] begin to see people's characteristics
[44:26] and then some people you know you have a
[44:27] group of people at your job where you
[44:29] can just tell them what to do they go
[44:31] and get it done no problem but then you
[44:34] got another group over here of people
[44:36] where you tell them what to do you come
[44:38] back 10 minutes later and they're doing
[44:39] their own thing right and so you can't
[44:42] get you you really can't get mad at them
[44:46] right you can get mad at the ACT but
[44:47] don't get mad at the way that they were
[44:49] designed and how their mind works
[44:52] because you have to understand that
[44:54] those two types of group have pros and
[44:56] cons to them yes brother have pros and
[44:59] cons to them this group over here that
[45:01] you can tell them to do whatever they
[45:02] want you tell them anything and they'll
[45:04] just do whatever do whatever you got to
[45:06] be careful with that because you got to
[45:08] make sure that you're doing the right
[45:09] thing right you got to make sure that
[45:11] you're doing the right thing and this
[45:12] group over here uh they just kind of
[45:14] want to do whatever they want to do it
[45:15] can you can look at that as a negative
[45:17] but there's a thing in the world called
[45:19] group think and group think is when
[45:21] you're with a group you're working with
[45:23] a group and all of the people are
[45:26] agreeing with the same agreeing with the
[45:28] same idea and if you go against that
[45:31] that that'll make them upset but if
[45:33] you're doing the wrong thing within that
[45:35] group you need someone to come and
[45:38] challenge you need someone to come in
[45:40] there and say hold on a second now y'all
[45:42] not thinking right so these are just
[45:44] personalities it's how Christ was when
[45:46] he came with the pH Pharisees and
[45:48] Sadducees they all had group thinking
[45:50] we're agreeing with the same thing but
[45:52] Christ came in there and said well hold
[45:53] on a
[45:54] second this isn't right right so we see
[45:57] Jonah here he had the uh he had a
[46:00] personality of he wanted to do what he
[46:01] wanted to do and of course we know how
[46:02] the story goes God told Jonah to do
[46:05] something and he went the opposite way
[46:07] right and you would think that his
[46:09] decision was a bad one and yes it was
[46:12] badow but the thing is God needed Jonah
[46:16] in the belly of a fish and God knew that
[46:19] see God knows that if he tells you to do
[46:22] something how many people would agree to
[46:25] go inside of a fish's belly for three
[46:27] days and three nights how many people
[46:30] will willingly say oh Lord send me right
[46:34] not many people would want to brother
[46:36] right so God had to design Jonah in a
[46:40] way that even though this was a
[46:42] characteristics where he liked to do
[46:43] things his way which can be used as a
[46:45] positive there had to be a con to it in
[46:49] Jonah's own choice right so when Jonah
[46:52] chose to go against what God Said and
[46:55] was on the board and when they were on
[46:56] the boat we know the story he was on the
[46:58] ship and the winds were going crazy and
[47:00] people were like what is going on and
[47:02] Jonah said it's me it's me I made the
[47:05] wrong choice throw me over the ship amen
[47:08] and all this thing will stop and they
[47:10] threw him over the ship and the Bible
[47:12] says the storm stopped that's right and
[47:14] God sent a fish right a a a fish that
[47:18] was created before the foundation of the
[47:20] world to come and pick Jonah up that's
[47:23] right and his troubles didn't stop there
[47:25] because Jonah was in the fish begging
[47:28] for the mercy of God and I can see that
[47:31] maybe Jonah at one point thought it was
[47:34] over or thought it was too late but the
[47:36] Perfection that was inside of Jonah that
[47:39] God had placed in him said if I just
[47:41] look up to the temple and ask God for
[47:44] Mercy he'll give it to me right and when
[47:47] he said that the Bible says the uh God
[47:50] told the fish to throw Jonah up out of
[47:52] his mouth that's right and when they
[47:54] threw him out of his mouth we know that
[47:56] the people that uh he was sent to go and
[47:58] deliver this message to were fish
[48:01] worshippers so when they seen a man come
[48:03] out of the belly of a fish God knew they
[48:06] would have to listen God always sends
[48:09] you a sign to catch your attention amen
[48:12] right so even though Jonah had made a
[48:15] wrong choice Jonah's wrong choice still
[48:18] pointed to Christ right because now
[48:21] Jonah had a message and not just a
[48:23] message over hey come repent just come
[48:26] and repent and God and go and God will
[48:28] take away your sins no Jonah came in
[48:30] there with a testimony behind this
[48:32] message which I believe a testimony in a
[48:35] message is more powerful because it
[48:37] shows you that I overcame this thing and
[48:40] so it gave it also gave Christ the
[48:43] courage because he said as Jonah was in
[48:46] the belly of a fish for three days and
[48:47] three nights so must I have go down
[48:50] right and it was God showing that hey
[48:53] I've got to go through and show that
[48:55] this antidote works because the prophet
[48:57] said that modern day scientists love to
[49:00] test their antidotes and the vaccines on
[49:03] animals but not themselves so Jonah had
[49:07] to go through this experience in order
[49:09] to test it on himself that even though
[49:11] he was in a situation and we're not
[49:13] talking about some Pinocchio where you
[49:16] got a A Memory Foam couch and a big
[49:19] belly of a whale with Netflix going on
[49:22] and some fire going on no the Bible said
[49:26] that Jonah described his situation as
[49:28] hell wow he described his situation as
[49:31] hell which meant no hope no God but yet
[49:34] that Perfection on the inside of him had
[49:36] to cry out to God and so God and so
[49:39] Jonah came with a message to the people
[49:41] that says I know some of you guys are
[49:44] hopeless but I'm here to tell you even
[49:47] in Hell God sees you which is which uhuh
[49:51] God had to then prophesy and put that
[49:54] word over David
[49:56] and say oh even though I laid my bed in
[49:58] hell thou with me and that gave Christ I
[50:02] believe that go gave Christ he looked to
[50:04] that word as he was on the cross and he
[50:06] and and and as death began to uh uh to
[50:09] to crawl on him because he was a man he
[50:11] was God but he also was a man and the
[50:14] prophet described that situation as the
[50:16] enemy uh was whispering into Christ's
[50:18] ears you know you're about to die and
[50:21] you know you have sin on your lives
[50:23] right and and that's why we can look
[50:24] back to the situ ation that Adam and Eve
[50:26] their situation was now a mirror of what
[50:29] Christ was doing because Christ now had
[50:32] put on the sins of his bride right and
[50:35] the Judgment was death and I can see God
[50:37] hear those things in his ear as a man
[50:39] but then he remembered Jonah and said
[50:41] hold on a second no no
[50:43] no God delivered Jonah out of his
[50:46] situation I'll be the same right so even
[50:49] though Jonah had made this great mistake
[50:52] it still gave God glory amen that is
[50:56] that is that is that is that is some
[50:58] beautiful Perfection because now when
[51:00] we're going through our situations right
[51:02] and think about it a man that was that
[51:05] man that did opposite of God we can look
[51:08] to him in our situations today and say
[51:10] hold on a second I have confidence in
[51:13] God that if God Did It for Jonah he'll
[51:15] do it for my
[51:17] situation glory and that was a situation
[51:20] where he went against God and you can
[51:23] still quote that verse now today and
[51:25] what you're going through and God will
[51:27] deliver you am amenallah oh my gosh talk
[51:32] about perfection it's not nothing that
[51:33] you do it's God's T it's the tender hand
[51:36] of je Jehovah over your head guiding you
[51:39] through your life making everything just
[51:42] perfect as it needs to be right we can
[51:45] look at Peter uh as uh begin to uh begin
[51:47] to close up a little bit we can look at
[51:49] Peter and Peter was a guy that was a
[51:52] very very interesting guy he was the
[51:53] best friend of Jesus Christ and and
[51:55] Peter is what I I guess you could call
[51:57] an extremist he was all over the place
[52:00] in one in one sense in one and one time
[52:03] you see Peter cutting the ear off saying
[52:06] God ain't gonna let him take you but
[52:08] then you fast forward and he's denying
[52:10] Christ three times he's just all over
[52:13] the place and you know those kind of
[52:14] people you know if uh you know let's say
[52:16] you're going to the restaurant you're
[52:18] going to Z uh Applebees or something you
[52:20] get up to the parking lot and then that
[52:22] that person you know what I want to go
[52:23] to this place you're like huh
[52:26] huh just all over the
[52:28] place it's it's the way God made Peter
[52:31] though all right because after after
[52:34] Peter had after Jesus had uh was washing
[52:37] their feet uh uh and uh uh Jesus was
[52:40] washing Peter's feet uh he said uh Peter
[52:43] had said a second he said Lord Lord
[52:44] don't don't don't wash my feet and God
[52:45] Jesus was telling him hey if I don't do
[52:47] this you have no life with you have no
[52:49] no no you have no life no part in life
[52:51] with me then he said well not only my
[52:52] feet all of me and Jesus said no I just
[52:56] need to do this so we see uh uh even
[53:00] through God's personalities and
[53:03] characteristics of God of Peter standing
[53:05] for God and then denying God before the
[53:08] foundational World God said I love you
[53:10] Peter God saw his personality God saw
[53:14] his characteristics and still loved him
[53:17] and had to show Peter that so that's why
[53:20] Peter had to make the decisions that he
[53:22] did now Peter represented faith and
[53:25] you'll notice with extreme people
[53:27] they're very extreme but I believe that
[53:30] Peter was the type of guy that when he
[53:32] made a decision he was committed to it
[53:35] which is why he cut the ear off of that
[53:37] person he wasn't there to play he wasn't
[53:40] there to play he literally cut his ear
[53:42] off right and the Bible said that uh the
[53:46] three of them Peter James and John they
[53:48] were God Peter was uh um John was go U
[53:51] God's agency of Love James was God's
[53:54] agent agency of Hope and Peter was God's
[53:57] agency of Faith right once Peter got
[54:00] committed to something there was no
[54:03] backing out there was no backing out and
[54:05] God needed that characteristics in Peter
[54:08] to the point that a man could stand in
[54:10] the shadow of Peter and be healed by his
[54:13] faith because of the way God made him
[54:17] right because of the way that God had
[54:18] made him God and the prophet has said
[54:21] that Peter didn't have the love that
[54:23] James uh that John had and we see that
[54:27] in uh uh in in the way that Peter
[54:29] handled that situation with Simon when
[54:31] Simon thought that he could buy the gift
[54:32] of God and Peter said look go talk to
[54:35] God just to see even if he would forgive
[54:38] you right the bluntness and that's how
[54:41] Peter was because a lot of us would have
[54:44] said you know hey brother this is not
[54:46] how the gospel works you know God loves
[54:48] you and made you the way you are and you
[54:51] know we should learn to appreciate God
[54:52] but Peter wasn't built that way amen
[54:56] amen Peter wasn't built that way God
[54:59] designed him to be a certain way uh uh
[55:01] to fulfill a certain role amen and in
[55:04] closing our last expectation that we
[55:06] want to talk about is you can't choose
[55:09] your path to
[55:11] Perfection you cannot choose your path
[55:13] to Perfection a lot of us want to live
[55:16] good lives but nowhere in Jonah's mind
[55:19] would did he ever think he'd be in belly
[55:21] of a fish nowhere in Peter's mind did he
[55:23] ever think that he would deny Christ so
[55:26] when bad things happen it's not that you
[55:29] would it's not that nowh in your mind
[55:30] you're not planning to do those things
[55:32] right right so it's our Perfection our
[55:35] path to Perfection God has even ordained
[55:37] those steps and I like to look at these
[55:39] um these two sisters in the Bible which
[55:42] is a beautiful uh uh uh typing together
[55:45] of Mary and Mary right so Mary um was
[55:49] set aside uh uh for a service for God
[55:53] and of course she was a virgin and she
[55:55] had a work to do with God so God had to
[55:57] make sure that her life she couldn't
[56:00] look at no boys she couldn't look at no
[56:03] guys the Holy Spirit would come down and
[56:05] say Mary turn your
[56:07] head Mary turn your head she she she
[56:10] thought that she was going to go and
[56:11] talk to some guy God said uhuh no that's
[56:13] not happening maybe sent a chicken in
[56:16] there cause a disruptance in order to
[56:19] get that thing separated because God had
[56:22] a specific path for uh uh for Mary and
[56:26] that was to be the incubator for our
[56:28] Lord Jesus Christ and her work was
[56:31] perfect but then you see another Mary
[56:33] and her life wasn't as virtuous right
[56:36] her life was not as virtuous she made a
[56:38] lot of bad decisions uh uh uh and I can
[56:42] see that maybe one point one uh uh in
[56:44] her life uh uh she begun to look in the
[56:47] mirror or self-examine herself and not
[56:49] feel worthy right and not feel like uh
[56:52] uh she was you she was useful for
[56:54] anything anything and then she heard
[56:56] about Christ and of course we know the
[56:58] story as Christ went to the party with
[57:00] the Pharisees he wasn't invited I mean
[57:02] he was invited but they didn't they
[57:04] didn't treat him any way they didn't
[57:05] greet him or nothing and he kind of sat
[57:07] down um sat down on the seat and I could
[57:10] see Mary as she began to uh approach
[57:13] Christ and go and go see Christ I can
[57:15] see the emotions uh uh in her life swell
[57:18] up as she realizes that this man is a
[57:20] perfect man and she didn't have any and
[57:23] she didn't have anything to give she had
[57:25] wasted away her life and her virtues and
[57:27] all of those things and felt like she
[57:29] didn't have much to give but as she got
[57:32] to him all she could do was cry on his
[57:35] feet and then begin to wipe her hair W
[57:37] wipe her feet with her hair and I love
[57:39] it because a a sacrifice had to be
[57:42] anointed and clean before work and so
[57:45] Mary had to be in a position where she
[57:48] felt cuz you think about it who's going
[57:50] to who's going to go and cry on
[57:52] someone's feet and then wash their hair
[57:54] with with it who's going to do that Mary
[57:56] had to be put into a position her
[57:59] choices the way God designed her and
[58:01] made her to make her choices she had to
[58:03] be put into a position where she could
[58:05] be broken down to recognize this perfect
[58:09] sacrifice clean it up before it was put
[58:12] to
[58:15] service it may have not been she may
[58:17] have not lived a virtuous life as Mary
[58:20] the other Mary had but she still had a
[58:23] path to perfection am
[58:26] amen amen and I would like and and I and
[58:29] and I would like to end it end it with
[58:31] this thing is that you know we are also
[58:34] uh uh the bride we all share the name of
[58:36] the bride of Christ amen but our path to
[58:39] Perfection we will not determin it we
[58:41] can hope for good things in our life and
[58:44] that's always good but God has a plan
[58:48] God has a plan and the song says some
[58:50] through the waters some through the
[58:51] floods some through great trials but all
[58:54] through the blood so our Perfection is
[58:58] not what we try to do in this life our
[59:01] Perfection is not the choice is not
[59:03] necessarily the choices choices that we
[59:04] try to make or the uh the goodness that
[59:06] we try to live within ourselves right
[59:09] because God will allow us to be in a
[59:11] position where we make the wrong choice
[59:14] and and it causes us to fall down but
[59:18] God said that a just man will fall God
[59:21] prophesied that you will fall brother
[59:23] brandom explained this he said man was
[59:26] born into a world a sinner you didn't
[59:28] have a choice in it but the most
[59:31] important thing is what you do next all
[59:33] right and the most important thing that
[59:35] this Mary could do though she had send
[59:38] though she had given away her virtue and
[59:39] stuff like that the next choice she made
[59:42] was to recognize the righteousness of
[59:44] Christ and realize that her life needed
[59:47] cleaning up and in that God could use
[59:50] her circumstances uh uh to glorify him
[59:54] amen there's your Perfection you've
[59:57] already been perfected you've already
[59:58] been perfected before the foundation of
[1:00:00] the world and you're already walking
[1:00:02] into this Perfection the most important
[1:00:05] thing is just to yield to God to uh to
[1:00:07] thank God as Perfection because it's
[1:00:09] it's it's nothing that you could do on
[1:00:11] yourself and that's why uh uh you know
[1:00:13] the Pharisees and sadut live good
[1:00:15] lives spotless spotless lives but it but
[1:00:20] but but but there was no uh but
[1:00:23] sometimes God needs you to be broken
[1:00:24] Bren down sometimes God needs you to go
[1:00:27] through a bed of Affliction sometimes
[1:00:28] God needs you to be sick right so that
[1:00:30] in those circumstances you can still
[1:00:33] call on him and he can then he can prove
[1:00:36] that he is a Healer if you were never
[1:00:38] sick how would God how could God Be A
[1:00:41] Healer if you were never sick and that's
[1:00:43] why God doesn't like it when we go
[1:00:45] through our trials and we're going
[1:00:46] through our situations and We complain
[1:00:49] right God just pulls that contract back
[1:00:51] out with your name on it saying you
[1:00:53] signed up for this
[1:00:56] you signed up for this right and it's to
[1:00:59] show that uh uh uh um the Perfection
[1:01:02] that God ha has given us before the
[1:01:04] foundation of the world it's just an
[1:01:07] appreciation God wants to show
[1:01:10] us uh that he loves us and this is the
[1:01:13] reason why and what we Face through in
[1:01:15] our lives Amen Let Us bow our
[1:01:20] heads Lord Jesus Christ we thank you oh
[1:01:23] Lord God for for your uhh forn knowledge
[1:01:26] oh Lord God and predestination oh Lord
[1:01:29] Jesus Christ we know Lord God that it's
[1:01:32] no works of ourselves oh Lord God you've
[1:01:36] given us the secrets of your word oh
[1:01:38] Lord God and the way that you work oh
[1:01:39] Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord you did it oh
[1:01:42] Lord God so that we would know your will
[1:01:44] oh Lord God and that when we are going
[1:01:46] through our trials oh Lord God that we
[1:01:48] wouldn't blame you oh Lord God because a
[1:01:50] lot of times people go through this
[1:01:51] world and bad things happen and they
[1:01:53] want to blame God why does God allow bad
[1:01:56] things to happen well sometimes he just
[1:01:59] wants to show you that he loves you
[1:02:01] sometimes he wants to show you that he's
[1:02:02] a Healer that he that he brings peace so
[1:02:05] he'll put you in a situation where
[1:02:06] there's no peace but you are the peace
[1:02:09] in that situation and all you have to do
[1:02:11] is just appreciate it there nothing that
[1:02:13] we put on on it's nothing that we're
[1:02:15] putting on that we're trying to obtain
[1:02:17] them but it's just something we're
[1:02:18] trying to appreciate while we're in the
[1:02:20] midst of our trial oh Lord God you
[1:02:23] designed us you formed us you knew us
[1:02:25] you knew every characteristic you know
[1:02:27] all the personalities we would have you
[1:02:30] know all the mistakes we would make you
[1:02:32] know our strengths oh Lord God you saw
[1:02:35] all of our weaknesses oh Lord you saw
[1:02:37] that we would fall short of the word
[1:02:39] Lord Jesus Christ but the Bible says
[1:02:41] that there was a lamb that was slain
[1:02:44] before the foundation of the world that
[1:02:46] was the Covenant oh Lord that you gave
[1:02:48] us oh Lord God that we could have
[1:02:51] confidence in oh Lord Jesus Christ I can
[1:02:53] see Jonah in the belly of that well Lord
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ look at that Temple that
[1:02:58] Temple reflected the Lamb's sacrifice
[1:03:01] before the foundation of the world to
[1:03:03] find Grace in his situation oh Lord God
[1:03:06] we just want to say we love you oh Lord
[1:03:08] God we thank you oh Lord God continue
[1:03:11] perfecting us oh Lord God lord we know
[1:03:14] we're going to fail you tomorrow we're
[1:03:15] going to know we know we're going to
[1:03:17] fail you the next day the prophet said
[1:03:19] that we sin daily and if we say we have
[1:03:21] no sin we make God a liar oh Lord we
[1:03:25] don't want to make you a liar oh Lord
[1:03:26] God lord we are unworthy oh Lord God
[1:03:29] lord we fail you all the time oh Lord
[1:03:31] Jesus Christ but Lord we know that you
[1:03:34] have made Provisions for us to come back
[1:03:37] oh Lord Jesus Christ and we'll stand
[1:03:39] like Jonah and just focus on the
[1:03:42] sacrifice in the midst of what we're
[1:03:44] going through oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] because we know Lord God that you will
[1:03:48] come and you will uh fulfill your word
[1:03:51] which was the love that you promised us
[1:03:53] before the foundation of the world in
[1:03:56] the precious name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] amen bless
[1:04:07] youate praise the
[1:04:10] Lord ah food for your
[1:04:14] soul uh certainly appreciate brother
[1:04:16] Quinton uh on tonight and just um many
[1:04:20] many nutrients there that he was um just
[1:04:23] bringing now uh the the the the story of
[1:04:27] Mary I think that's something I'm going
[1:04:29] to have to start using myself uh but her
[1:04:32] her characteristics were in such a way
[1:04:35] that it um and God designed her that way
[1:04:39] uh it allowed um just God's grace just
[1:04:42] to be expressed in such a way and not
[1:04:44] only that um for the sacrifice to be
[1:04:47] washed uh before it was offered she had
[1:04:50] to be in such a condition that she knew
[1:04:52] that this was her only hope and I don't
[1:04:55] think she planned it that way but she
[1:04:57] just realized how much she needed him
[1:05:00] and and she had a chance to be at his
[1:05:01] feet so just just a really really
[1:05:04] wonderful wonderful uh thought and and
[1:05:06] and um the one point that he made the
[1:05:09] way God designed you has a role in your
[1:05:14] path to
[1:05:15] Perfection
[1:05:17] um that statement is um is is is
[1:05:22] lifegiving um it's one that will set you
[1:05:25] free if you really understand it uh
[1:05:28] because you know and when we talk about
[1:05:30] perfection brother Brandon makes a
[1:05:31] statement he says you know it's not
[1:05:34] Perfection um the way that you think I
[1:05:38] should be made perfect and you need to
[1:05:42] stop this and you still doing that and
[1:05:45] you well I'm measuring up to your
[1:05:48] standard of perfection right but it's
[1:05:51] not based on what you you think think
[1:05:54] it's based on what God thinks and and
[1:05:57] the other thing is God design me with
[1:05:59] certain characteristics brother Brandon
[1:06:01] made a statement he says uh there are um
[1:06:05] there were things in him that his
[1:06:09] conversion did not take
[1:06:11] out now if that was in the prophet and
[1:06:14] his conversion didn't take it out guess
[1:06:16] what there are certain things in all of
[1:06:18] us that even your conversion will not
[1:06:21] take out God actually designed you to be
[1:06:25] that
[1:06:26] way so we can't strive for other
[1:06:29] people's
[1:06:30] Perfection but this is all about God and
[1:06:32] what he's doing in and through us and we
[1:06:35] yield to that wonderful word from the
[1:06:39] Lord tonight amen
[1:06:44] wonderful amen I I I I I appreciate it

[1:10:46] was a blessing to me um brother qu who
[1:10:50] had shared with me and also with the
[1:10:52] brothers on last night
[1:10:54] uh he felt led to send one of the
[1:11:00] sermons um recent sermons over to Sister
[1:11:03] Tatiana and uh sister brother brother
[1:11:06] Leo and sister Tatiana they were coming
[1:11:08] during covid with their three kids we're
[1:11:11] in the other uh building they were they
[1:11:13] were coming uh quite frequently you know
[1:11:15] to our services and um and I also had an
[1:11:19] opportunity to sit down and just have a
[1:11:21] a real good conversation about some
[1:11:24] things that you know U they had
[1:11:26] questions about so we had dinner and and
[1:11:28] I was able to you know just just kind of
[1:11:30] break break some things down and um so
[1:11:34] they
[1:11:35] um um they were you know brother brother
[1:11:39] quu felt led to share Sunday service
[1:11:42] with her and then said you know what I
[1:11:44] had send the previous Sunday to her so
[1:11:46] let me let me send that to her and uh so
[1:11:49] she was there listening to the uh
[1:11:52] sermons in her house and and when she
[1:11:54] heard the sermon I don't look like what
[1:11:56] I've been through she responded to
[1:12:00] brother quu she say this is a now
[1:12:05] word and she capitalized now you know
[1:12:08] she this is a now word you know and and
[1:12:12] and I I needed this you know and on that
[1:12:16] um on while she was watching you know
[1:12:19] the service you can tell people watch
[1:12:21] the whole service not just part she
[1:12:23] listened to the
[1:12:25] announcements and in the announcements
[1:12:27] she heard there sister's prayer meeting
[1:12:30] and she said brother qu who can I be a
[1:12:32] part of that prayer
[1:12:33] meeting because uh you know and and the
[1:12:36] reason that she was drawn to the prayer
[1:12:39] meeting is and this is the thing that
[1:12:41] really blessed me she say one day she
[1:12:43] came to the
[1:12:44] pantry um she was going through
[1:12:46] something in her life she came to the
[1:12:48] pantry she ran into sister Michelle and
[1:12:52] um and somehow Michelle talked to her a
[1:12:55] little bit and made sure that she was
[1:12:56] all situated with the food from the
[1:12:58] pantry and uh and and through that
[1:13:01] process she say sister Michelle prayed
[1:13:03] for her and her husband uh who was in
[1:13:06] the hospital at the time and she she
[1:13:08] prayed for her and she say um if sisters
[1:13:13] going to be on the prayer line praying
[1:13:15] the way sister Michelle prayed for me I
[1:13:18] need to learn how to pray like that and
[1:13:21] I want to be on the prayer line with
[1:13:22] them
[1:13:24] amen so little things go a long
[1:13:29] way and and and for me that that that
[1:13:32] means a lot because you know we when
[1:13:34] with the with the pantry it's um uh it's
[1:13:38] not just giving out the food right that
[1:13:41] that sometimes you typically uh you
[1:13:44] never know when a person has a real need
[1:13:46] but when they have a real need the
[1:13:48] greatest thing they could ever receive
[1:13:50] amen is is is a word of prayer or just
[1:13:53] introduction to Jesus Christ so we look
[1:13:56] for
[1:13:57] opportunities I mean it's a Ministry the
[1:13:59] pantry is a Ministry uh when we were
[1:14:02] when we were uh praying about um uh we
[1:14:06] had lost our opportunity to go to um
[1:14:09] Pinnacle Palms they closed up because of
[1:14:12] um uh because of covid but when they
[1:14:14] when they close that door we start
[1:14:16] praying Lord where do you want us to go
[1:14:17] next where do you want us what do you
[1:14:18] want us to do God put the Pantry in our
[1:14:21] lap and there people passing through all
[1:14:23] the time so we look for those
[1:14:25] opportunities where we can say a word of
[1:14:26] prayer for them right it means so much
[1:14:30] so when I heard that and and how the
[1:14:32] sister was just blessed by that now she
[1:14:34] wants to be a part of the prayer so
[1:14:36] y'all going to see a new face you know
[1:14:37] your sister's a new face so and just
[1:14:40] through this who knows we'll start
[1:14:41] winning our sister am we'll start
[1:14:44] winning her and her family right on into
[1:14:47] right on into the faith not only that
[1:14:49] she um uh she had some neighbors that
[1:14:53] that lived next to her and they they
[1:14:55] happened to move they relocated I think
[1:14:57] somewhere in this area and she told her
[1:14:59] neighbors they're from
[1:15:01] Uruguay and uh she told him said well I
[1:15:04] know a couple churches that you could
[1:15:06] probably try out and uh they said Okay
[1:15:08] and she said this church St
[1:15:10] predominately you know English but this
[1:15:12] one over here is predominantly Spanish
[1:15:13] and being from Uruguay you know they
[1:15:15] probably prer a Spanish speaking Church
[1:15:18] well the wife and this and this couple
[1:15:22] she heard the name of our
[1:15:24] church she said all she heard it was the
[1:15:27] name of the church and when she heard
[1:15:29] the name ofur said I know they other
[1:15:31] Spanish speaking but spirit and Truth
[1:15:35] Tabernacle I want to go
[1:15:39] there so we're looking for these Saints
[1:15:42] to show up any day now right uh but
[1:15:45] sister Tatiana recommended our church to
[1:15:48] them and so you know if she's
[1:15:50] recommending then you know she got to be
[1:15:52] part of of it too right so so y'all be
[1:15:56] praying for her and praying with her and
[1:15:58] you know I just believe God's going to
[1:16:00] use this amen for his glory and for his
[1:16:02] honor and you know another little quick
[1:16:04] testimony I'll share my wife shared it
[1:16:06] with me and I want I I say this because
[1:16:09] I think we all need to be sensitive to
[1:16:11] this but she was telling me how uh one
[1:16:13] of her um she volunteers and one of the
[1:16:15] other ladies that worked there was going
[1:16:17] through something with her husband and
[1:16:19] uh she knew my wife's life so she she
[1:16:21] said you know Erica would you just
[1:16:24] please just pray for me just pray for my
[1:16:27] husband just pray for me so you know
[1:16:29] commment responses sure I'll pray for
[1:16:31] you later on right and uh so my wife uh
[1:16:36] was just listening to her and she says
[1:16:37] you know what let's stop right now and
[1:16:40] let's pray right now and uh she stopped
[1:16:44] right where she was and had a word of
[1:16:46] prayer with that lady and she would just
[1:16:48] just
[1:16:49] Overjoyed uh that sister Erica would
[1:16:52] have prayer you know with her and and uh
[1:16:55] we never know when we going to have
[1:16:57] opportunities to be Jesus for somebody
[1:17:01] am amen amen so I mean we we we we ought
[1:17:05] to look for these these opportunities
[1:17:07] and and when God put simple for us let's
[1:17:09] let's let's take advantage that happened
[1:17:10] to me just the other day I went to visit
[1:17:13] one of the clients and and um the the
[1:17:16] the client's daughter they they are um
[1:17:19] I'm not sure if they're practicing uh
[1:17:21] Jews but I know that they
[1:17:23] of Jewish descent and uh but the

[1:17:40] Elders of the church so we prayed right
[1:17:42] there right there in the nursing home or
