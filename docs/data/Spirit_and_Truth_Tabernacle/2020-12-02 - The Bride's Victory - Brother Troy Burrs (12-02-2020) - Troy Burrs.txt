devil and we ain't scared remember because uh we know a man that uh we're in a battle and we know that sometimes when you're uh in a battle a man you can't go in a battle without expecting to get hit hey man if you one that don't like to get hit or you're not prepared properly and then so then the uh minute um you get hit you're gonna just uh quit hey man you're gonna just run and uh say well i

me did i have a title and i said well i forgot i'm supposed to have one of those so uh we will we don't really have a title right now but i'm sure god will give us give me one um as we go on amen but right now i just would like to uh if you at your homes or your car or wherever if you could just grab your bible or your phone or whatever you have we just like to start out reading a few scriptures amen uh i would like to uh if we could just go to first chronicles amen the 17th chapter we'll be reading from the first verse amen and then we'll be going over to acts the seventh chapter amen and we'll be reading there amen from the 41st verse and some of you bible readers kind of know where i'm going with this and uh uh and then we'll be going over to hebrews the 10th chapter starting at the fifth verse but starting at first chronicles is 17 amen um we'll be reading from there the first the first verse there uh just trying to to to to uh give a little insight as the lord has just sort of laid it on my heart as what the enemy is doing in this hour even what we see that's going on now here amen preaching to an empty building but that's all right that's all right you know because the prophet uh kind of explained to us in the bible uh teaches us uh uh uh this is not the temple amen this is our gathering place for this local assembly amen but the temple is in you amen so uh we're gonna just try to hit some things and just kind of expose the devil a little bit this evening amen so first chronicles the 17th chapter the first verse it reads on this wise now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to uh nathan the prophet lo i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains nathan said unto david do all this do all that in my in that's in thine heart for god is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not bill me and house to dwell in for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from 10 to 10 and from one tabernacle to another amen wherever i have walked with all israel spake i word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying we have saying why have ye not built me a house of cedars amen if we'll go over to acts the seventh amen acts the seventh chapter we'll begin reading there from the 44th verse amen our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make make it according to the fashion that he has seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles who god drove out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favor before god and desire to find a tabernacle for the house of jacob but solomon built him in house howbeit the most high dwellers not in temples made with hands as says the prophet heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool what house will ye bill mean and the lord of in the lord or what is the place of my rest amen what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest hebrews the 10th chapter hebrews 10 amen 10th chapter the fifth verse amen wherefore when now cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body has thou prepared for me amen a body there hot that thou has prepared for me and i'd like us to go on there and and read on down to the uh the 21st if we could just pick up there from the 21st verse it says on this while it says and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water us hold fast to our profession of our faith without wavering and he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaking as not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as ye see the day approaching amen and and my brothers and sisters uh i we certainly see the day approaching let us go over here to the 11th chapter and i like to pick up a little something here from the 11th chapter of hebrews and the 9th verse it says by faith he surgeoned in the land of promise talking about abraham here he saw john in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had the foundation who builder and maker is god so my brothers and sisters that we we we certainly see that we're living the the current times and the situations that we're living in from from what i've seen in the scripture everything is is is is is is is drawing us together the bible says that where the caucuses the eagles are be gathered together but if you see what's going on in this in this present condition this present time we see that there's an attack of the enemy but you know something this is not surprising by no means is he catching anybody off guard we understood by the revelation of the word that these are the tactics that the enemy does amen these are the schemes that the enemy uses but we're just beginning to see that these these schemes and these tactics are at a greater level what is that telling us my brothers and sisters that's telling us that he's getting desperate that's telling us that it's coming close to the time of the end because we see that the battle is intensifying amen we see that the the the tests are getting greater we see that that that we we are getting to a point amen where everything that we've been taught everything that we've been told over the years and everything that we have have have been been explained in the seals opening and it's coming a time but we are at that junction right now my brothers and sisters we are at a time so many times i can remember been in the message some 30 years and many times that one day the doors of the church will be closed i never thought in a million years that we would see a time like this that we would actually see where we couldn't gather together for one reason or another amen but this is where we're at this is the time that we're living in this is the conditions of this present hour that is forcing these things to happen we see that the devil amen is is causing a great division everything like i said everything in the bible is is telling the saints of god it's telling the bride to gather together so many examples and saying they're saying that we are that this time and at this juncture should be coming together why amen because we're we're like that that that that those ducks are deep on the pawn amen we've heard from the lead duncan they all gather together to get ready to fly south for the winter amen but see what the devil wants to do is he wants to separate amen he wants to divide he wants to isolate amen this is the tactics of the enemy amen we'll show you that a little bit more i just like to take a little reading here from a message here that the uh prophet the arrow of god's deliverance shot from a bow preached in 1956 0801 amen the prophet said this he says he says as i think of moses how that moses standing up there on the mount by the side of the burning bush now the prophet said this he said he lost all hope of freedom did it seem like that freedom that the people he so gallantly stood for at one time was ever going it was ever going to happen but in the light of god standing by that burning bush everything in him changed amen the prophet said it seemed like moses had lost freedom he had he had he had lost hope my brothers and sisters he says i think it's the same today that many of us lose sight of our freedom lose sight of what god gave us amen that listen the children of israel amen god at one time led them down into egypt to be sustained amen there was a great famine in the land and god led them there led them there amen to be fed amen to sustain life so it was a it was a great time but over time things began to change things began to get get get a little bit oh but this isn't the same like it used to be but what was going on he had to he had to cause trouble he had to cause turmoil he had to cause bondage why because he needed to get the people to pray as long as things was good and cush amen and they had need of nothing and everything was good amen the people won't pray amen but when the minute amen demanded that the taskmasters amen their attitudes begin to change the bible says that dale rosa pharaoh who didn't know joseph amen and he began to he began to persecute the people and i believe that's what's going on in this hour let me tell you something brothers and sisters we see things happening on a worldwide scale amen we're seeing things happening on a national scale but don't you get it twisted the devil is after one person and that's you amen he is not after everybody else he is after the bride of jesus christ and i'll prove it to you by the bible amen this whole thing amen the everything that they did amen against god's people against the children of israel amen was to get them and enslave them amen to work amen for egypt amen to get them to build on their backs and let me tell you something right now my brothers and sisters there is a battle going on right now there is a battle going on for the throne of your heart amen satan wants you to make it make you a worker in his vineyard amen but you don't belong to him amen you belong to god amen you are a temple amen his temple but satan desires to assist you with weak amen he desires to be worshiped amen he don't want to be worshipped from everybody he wants to be worshipped from god's wife amen that's who he really wants he is not satisfied with just being worshiped from anybody amen he'll take that amen but he wants the wife of god because if he could get a man could get a man's wife he then he's defeated amen this battle is not about you and i we're just in the middle of it amen but this is god's battle this battle started long before us amen so we but we know how it's going to end amen stay with me my brothers and sisters now we see amen here what the prophet said here same message here in the uh arrows of god's deliverance the prophet said god has asked us to believe his word he sends the holy ghost the spirit to energize the word when he fails falls into it when the word is being preached by the holy spirit brings the word he energizes that and flashes the same light of god blessed promise god said i have remembered my promise to abraham isaac and jacob and i'm sending you moses amen sending you down there to do it see then when god's word his promise becomes enlightened by the presence of the angel of the lord amen stop moses now he is on his road and the and god always keeps his promise always keeps his promise amen now i want you to notice something here i want to bring out a few things we're going to go on down here he says but i begin to notice there is something different let me let me let me lay a little platform here brother branham is preaching this message you know in shreveport louisiana a place by the name of life tabernacle but i want you to pay attention to some of the words that he's saying because some of them are very important there he says i begin to notice there's something different it ain't the same life tabernacle it used to come here are you that i used to come to and i want you to remember tonight amen i want you to remember amen to keep that old-fashioned prayer meeting keep the old-fashioned holy spirit falling among you keep the world out seal christ in and you'll let him down in prayer some way just remember as you sow you'll reap remember that as you sow you'll reap amen you've got one of the best churches i've ever walked into that's a lot coming from the prophet cause he went all over the world he says and any contentment he says i've been to he walked into in in life of anywhere on any continent i'm sorry life tabernacle one of my favorites it breaks my heart to see the world reaching in into you the way you're doing so don't let uh so don't do that no more snap out of it pray out of it amen let god come back and take over submit yourselves to god and get the old-fashioned blessings back again he says here and i tell you don't let the world creep into you don't let the world get in to your churches brethren pray it out fast it out until god comes down and take a hold that's right now i want you to listen keep the joy of the lord amongst the saints keep them prayed up and guard every little place if noah seen the leak in the ark why he put some pitch in it and so uh about the time uh one thing i know to keep the leak out the world out is to stop up the leak is the best thing i know to do the only way to do it that's prayer prayer stops the leak prayer changes things i want you to notice that my brothers and sisters that uh he he said keep the joy of the lord amongst the saints don't start bickering with one another i want you to notice in this current time we've seen the attack of the enemy we've seen division the satanist is trying to cause division we've seen churches split down the middle with this whole republican democrat we've seen the nation is split down the middle in some instances we've seen homes split down the middle what is it it is a demonic spirit amen that's going to the land amen to try and cause amen division try to cause a separation to do what to to to to to cause the people not to be able to come together as i said before when everything i seen in scripture is calling for the bride to come together it's a body amen the body of christ amen amen in those spiritual gifts amen that we have amen love joy peace long suffering amen he's the very thing that joins us together the very thing amen when things get tough the prophet said amen if you can't bitterly agree with your brother and sister and turn around and hug his neck and mean it something is wrong with your spirit but we got people all upset with one another over politics over stuff that don't matter it's gonna happen anyway prophecy is on its head i don't care who's in office this is not the time for the blood of jesus christ to be bickering and hollowing up arguing and going on one another he says right there he says keep the joy of the lord amongst the saints keep the love amongst you amen earlier we were reading amen to talking about how the dedication of the temple and how solomon amen was building amen this temple and and and the story there's and i think it's in first kings the fifth chapter amen he he he went and he got uh uh of materials from all over the place amen he didn't just get materials amen from right there where he was a temple hey man he got uh uh uh uh one from from from lebanon amen cedar from lebanon amen he was the the redwood the prophet says in california amen in africa he he went and got another another certain type of wood amen he called it a stink wood amen but it was it was knee full amen and it came floating in on barges and ships amen for one purpose amen to build the house of the lord amen and we see amen in this hour amen god building a temple building a bride of jesus christ he didn't just choose black people he didn't just choose white people he didn't just choose oriental people he went all over the world amen to choose a man a specific body amen to come together in this hour amen amen the body of the lord amen a body amen amen that a house amen the lord jesus christ the heart of god amen amen his very bride that's what the devil is against that's what the fight is for amen he wants the bride of jesus christ he wants god's most prized possession amen the very thing that he died for if he can conquer that amen then he then he wins that's what he's after that's the prize amen you are the prize hey man so amen we don't fall for the devil schemes that has uh the prophet here in the message uh uh uh uh the message uh dedication he says here now we find that the great cedars were honed down amen by the amen and that they had amen blueprints and they brought them together from different parts of the world he says now if you notice solomon never varied one big from the pattern amen he stayed right with that pattern that moses saw on mount sinai hey many many man moses say man saw the pattern solomon stayed right with that pattern amen but he used a man amen the materials amen from all over the world amen the vision he pitched the tent and he made it just exactly the way he saw it and when solomon built the temple he made it exactly the way he seen it on the pattern the tight moses pistol perpetual type because it was moved from place to place but solomon he made the tabernacle it meant just exactly in the fashion that moses did it was all put together and set in order exactly amen he said what a spiritual application but i never leave the scripture stay exactly with the pattern my brothers and sisters that's the reason i believe that the way the first church was patterned that's the way the next one should be patterned that's the way everyone should be patterned that's the way it was in the beginning i believe god has it that way i believe the real church amen i believe the real church all right the material was cut out of their native land and brought into one place but they were brought together he says i'm reading here from the 16th chapter of quoting when they were brought together they were so perfectly fit that in that space over 40 years it taken to put the to put the construction up and wasn't one stone to be saw one wasn't to be buzzed or solved or the sound of a hammer for 40 years talk about masonry and architect you know the prophet talked about uh it takes a real craftsman amen to turn a corner amen i believe god has a fivefold ministry amen that is that that he that is specifically designed amen to lead a group of people the one thing my brothers and sisters we can't we we we can't we we can't each church is not cookie cutter just because one thing works with your group doesn't mean it might work here at this tabernacle or one thing that might work here it's a it's a it's a different group of people it's a it's a different uh uh uh a a a different location maybe maybe maybe it gets a little cold where you at so you might have to do things a little bit different you have to allow amen for the leadership of that local assembly amen to be led by god amen for the group of people that he's placed a shepherd over amen and let me tell you something each and every one is important amen if you notice that an arrow he says recommend yourself submit yourselves i notice you know sometimes we get a little discouraging the devil is going to shoot those adopts well i don't know i wonder if he led you better rebuke that devil rebuke that devil because all he's trying to do is shoot a little doubt in you the next thing you know you'll be sitting at the back of the church and then out the door that's just the truth of the matter you can't allow these locusts amen to eat away at the joy love peace long suffering you see a brother struggling you praying through you see the pastor struggling with a dif with a decision you pray for him but god placed you there for a reason amen for nothing else to be a prayer warrior amen he placed man in charge he demanded to do certain things but that's nothing without a field to receive seed amen what is a man what is a man amen a man a man grows and he desires to get married and what he needs his wife i i i have yet to see a man produce a child by himself what does he wants to do he needs a bedding grind for his seed to reproduce himself amen and god is is his word amen he he's looking for a betting ground amen to plant his seed amen to reproduce himself his bride amen to reproduce himself amen amen but we see satan desires to stop all of that he desires to put all kind of roadblocks and different things in the way cause turmoils in the home caused you to just get a little unhappy cause you to get just a little bit uncertain now i'm looking at this whole thing with this the pandemic and and all of these things and just looking at how how this thing is playing out first thing no no no no no i'm not arguing with the science i'm not arguing with the science but you have to also look at the spiritual application the first thing we have to do is put math on one of my greatest things i i probably told the story before i had a person that tell me on and asked me a question on the interview once they say when are you at your happiest and i as i say when the other people around me are happy i walk through the stores and through the streets and i smile at people and they don't even know i'm smiling at them i can't tell anymore they could be smiling at me or frowning at me i don't know we covered this section of our faces now don't get me i'm not saying don't wear your mask i'm saying recognize what the devil is doing you cover your faces one of the warmest things you may see somebody walking down the street and just give them a nice smile and say good morning everybody got a mask on now you don't know whether they smiling or not then on the other hand you got this political thing going on they sizing you up politically i know this person got to be a democrat i can look it doesn't tell you a democrat or i can look at this prison until he a republican dividing lines on our jobs in our churches in our communities even in our homes politics causing divisions these are seeds of discrepancy these are seeds that were planted by the devil to do what for such a time as this because the word is telling us to gather together the word is telling us everything to to to to love one another buying that much more closer together in love amen let the let the the the gifts the the spiritual gifts amen let your your fruit hang low amen we're looking at this this message he's talking about the dedication amen that the the the restoration amen of this building we see we see that uh over time amen where he he preached in the in in the message of uh uh uh the the bride tree restoration of the bride tree and he and he taught us amen that that there that that four stage insect amen was to eat away at the at the tree amen but joelle there in chapter two said i will restore what was it amen there's a restoration that's going on now just as sure as there's a healthy tree or restoration here comes the devil to eat that eat it down again that's exactly what's going on i was speaking with some people not long ago and uh uh just talking about how one of the things that the prophet said is that um we have that locus the kinker worm the palmer worm the caterpillar and the locust and the first the first thing they eat off of that bride tree amen is the fruit he take away your love for one another he take away your joy of the gospel the peace the long suffering the brotherly kindness begins to eat at these fruit we look at this thing here with the mask some believe in wearing the mask some don't want to wear the mask but where's our brotherly kindness where's our brother kind if if my if if my brother or my sister has a condition in the mask i'm not going to fall out with you because you don't want to wear a mask and neither should well other if if this person well mad well i don't i don't i don't what happened to our brotherly kindness and brotherly love we can't allow these type of things to eat away at the fruit of the spirit because it's the very thing that's going to join us together it's the very thing that's going to fit the joint the the hair stone we're talking about the dedication of this building each stone each part was fitly joined together not by man we didn't pick people god chose he chose their character he chose their attitudes their makeup and everything amen fitly joined together to make up the body of christ the bride of jesus christ amen and how can i uh uh uh uh uh hate one part of the body no love that brother love that sister i read him because you keep an old-fashioned prayer meeting going on amen keep an old-fashioned prayer meeting going on i was having a conversation with a guy at work and then and and and i was telling me we was there and it was seven o'clock i said you had a church in prayer right now he said he said in prayer i said yes sir we have seven o'clock eight o'clock pray every sunday morning and he said that kind of early i say yeah bro but we that's what that's what's been keeping our church strong he said there's no doubt in my mind that's what's been keeping our church strong he said man that's really something he said that takes a lot of dedication i said yes sir it does and i shared with him i said i even tried to go sometime after work but i felt realized i that was a mistake i got there and got down on my knees after the whole night's work and and the devil won that day took a nice nap right down there on the front row but yeah the prayer keep a good prayer meeting going love one another don't let the pastor and i think it was the last bible study talk don't let schisms and isms enter in among you when you see that kind of stuff happening when you see yourself feeling like that you got to resist that devil that's your brother that's your sister and if i had to wear a mask so that another person would feel comfortable coming to church well i don't feel comfortable coming because everybody don't wear math you mean to tell me all i got to do is wear a mask and you'll come to church i'll gladly wear a mask for you even though i don't want to i'll gladly wear a mask for you but that's the brotherly love that's the brotherly kindness don't fall out with one another over these kind of issues this is what the devil is after you're playing right into his hand leave the politics out of it don't let them kind of things come amongst us start drawing that dividing line this is the body of jesus christ we the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name should be a wonderful counselor a mighty god a prince of peace that's who we follow i'll read something a little bit later we are getting out of here we're not conforming we're not conforming to this world but we're being transformed by the renewing of our minds amen i wanted to get into something here we look at how uh uh i take a a a an example of a great boxer amen been training all his life been training for 30 years for the big fight been doing all of his calisthenics and sit-ups and lifting and and everything for this great fight he got one one fight so the the the trainer uh uh knows where he's weak at and knows where his strengths at so he puts him in the ring now and and for a while he's he's shadow boxing he's just sitting the ring by himself and he's looking good he's floating like a butterfly you know and he's a light on his feet and he guarding he doing how he oh he look beautiful but now i put him in there against an opponent so that trainer says okay i i want to put him in there so i'm going to put him in there or get somebody that that's bigger than him and see how see what he do so this guy he he hires this guy and this guy's probably outweigh him by a hundred pounds got muscles everywhere and he puts him in the ring what's he doing he's seeing if he if he if he gets scared get scared and say man he's too big i i i can't do nothing with him he's too big look at how big he is training though he ain't ready you're not confident enough in the skills that you have you're not confident and confident enough in the training that you've been going through amen so he goes back and he got to continue training he put him in there with this guy and he has to get in there and have the confidence that he can he can take this guy so he goes in and they they going and this guy hit him with a wallop like you never seen before wow knock him out in the ring i believe the prophet went through something like that and he said man he hit me so hard but what the trainer is doing to see if the minute he's hit amen does he just lose all of his form he's shadow boxing and he's looking good he's he he bobbing and weaving and everything like that and he get hit one time and then he goes to swarming man wait a minute you lost all of your form you don't went you lost all of your training and everything we know he's not ready so he bring back the same guy put him in there again and he going against him and the guy wall up him this time he take a good lick hey man and he come right back he come right back and the guy hit him again hey man and next time he come right back and the guy hit him again he hit him with everything he got hit him as hard as he can he done through the kitchen sink the bathtub and everything else and just hit him and the guy just get right up and come right back you can you imagine how that must make that man feel like he's kind of saying this guy here i can't i can't ain't nothing i can do to him but what happened he's been trained he's been tooted now the trainer knows amen that he's ready for the fight he's ready for the big game he's ready for the big show amen he can take a punch he's no longer got a glass jaw amen i can put him in there now he's not gonna get scared and that's what's going on my brothers and sisters we just got we just got we we got the big giant in front of us now and he hitting us with his best shot amen but when he see you don't get discouraged amen you still right there in the fight hey man you still got the joy in your heart amen you still love your brothers and sisters amen you're still going right home hey man his punch it might have hurt you it might have staggered you a little bit hey man but you come right back amen now he don't know what to do with you amen because you hitting them back and then and your hits are starting to take an effect he's i don't know what to do with it i don't hit him with everything i had and he just keep coming back why he said he got a revelation that he's a winner he's got a revelation now and that's what happened my brothers and sisters amen jesus asked peter who do men say i am amen some say you're one of the prophets amen some say you you say but peter who do you say i am say your son living god he said and upon that church i upon the revelation i'll build my church in the gates of hell should not prevail against it amen and that's what we have in this hour my brothers and sisters we've had a revelation amen of who we are and where we're at in this hour have a revelation amen of exactly what's going on we're not wondering we're not guessing we're not wavering we know who we are amen we know what time it is amen let me look at some read something here amen reading here the end of the sabbath from matthew 28th chapter the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other married to see the subculture and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was as lightning and his raiment was as snow and for fear of him that for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men the angel of the lord answered and said unto the woman fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified amen and he is not here he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell the disciples he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth forth into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you i want you to notice something here the angel is not telling jesus the 11 disciples directly he is telling this woman amen he's telling the the the woman there to uh uh go tell amen the disciples they didn't believe him amen they didn't believe they didn't believe this woman they didn't believe it they they had doubt amen nobody telling you uh uh make you truly believe if you believe then that is because the lord himself has given it to you to be able to believe amen so we notice in the bible there that a woman represents the church so we see that this angel amen came and revealed amen uh this angel to the woman that he's risen that he's not and and this woman was charged amen to go tell the disciples but right away everybody did they didn't believe him now this is just like the message amen we had an angel in this day amen that told us that that that that he's returned that that christ came and and we went telling neighbors and everybody but everybody don't believe everybody don't believe us but there's going to come a time amen that you'll see for yourself and we go on the story goes on where we see that uh uh uh he had to gather amongst them and prove himself amen amen that that that there was a resurrection amen that took place he had to go in and meet them in a specific place amen to prove to them that's what's been going on god has been proving to us amen that he is a resurrected savior a resurrected king amen and we have nothing to fear in this hour he's not dead the tomb is empty amen whether it be coronavirus or whatever come after coronavirus amen our king our savior is risen amen so we look to the resurrection i'm getting ready to close but i want to read something here the easter seal the prophet said he says have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened i want to i want you tell me about it every time has it been perfectly at the platform every time has it happened just like he said congregation says amen i stood there and looked over that time i seen tens of thousand times thousands coming young men and women run throwing their arms around me screaming i look right back and see myself laying on the bed oh lord look oh lord let me look it past the curtain of time what is it he says it's the quickening power that will catch us away that great quickening power the quickening power will come in the last days that's what i'm in that's what i'm in arizona for right now there's many people sitting right here stood right here at phoenix and heard me tell you from that very platform thus saith the lord how many remembered it now go uh something is fixing to happen i saw seven angels come didn't life magazine packet as the fog it floated across here uh across here 27 miles high 30 miles across it's not fred scotchman these others gene norman them setting back there stood right there when the seven angels appeared right there on the hill it shook the hills for miles like that there stood seven angels and thrown a sword into your hand said go home and open these seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent's seed and all these things that's been fussed about it's thus saith the lord what is it he says it's the quickening power coming to the church to make her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh god help us to receive it let us to be help us to believe it see just depend on what your attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not though see you have to believe that you don't believe it you won't do one it won't do you one bit of good how old samuel stood there before the people and said have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord that wouldn't happen did i ever beg for money to live on now but it says no but what uh but we want the king anyhow that's the way the church is today they want their own ideas they won't pay a bit of attention to you they walk right around well it just goes on to show the quickening power is not there oh you say i spoke in tongues i jumped and i shouted that's all fine but if that quickening power is there you'll recognize like that little eagle that his mama that's the word that's thus saith the lord that's what god promised that's what he foretold that's exactly what happened we're beyond any shadow of doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air he said we're potentially in the resurrection right now and we're going to allow coronavirus and all of these things to shake us to divide us to separate us these are the tricks of the enemy this is just a big sparring partner that's come to hit us with a really big blow to see how you're going to react how you're going to handle the attack because let me tell you if you can't handle this attack you sure wouldn't be able to handle the next one because they come in heavy but we have a promise in this hour amen we have a promise amen that before amen he won't let us he won't he he won't let us get he won't be here through the tribulation but we have to be tested we have to be tried we have to be tried in the fire we have to know amen that for god we're living for god with that amen amen you lord jesus amen i guess that's uh amen my my time i just want to encourage you my brothers and sisters amen i i i had a lot more i wanted to say and try to condense it down amen and and and to this time amen the prophet of god preached a message and and it and and and it was an easter message he preached that message the uh restoration of the bride tree amen and all throughout we see amen the tactics of the enemy where he used amen the locusts and different things amen to uh uh uh uh to to attack amen the body of christ amen to eat away at the fruit amen i was sharing them you know how to say the the uh the the the the leaves of the tree amen out of fellowship to take away our fellowship now we know that we have to be wise in this hour and things like that uh and and just like i said show brotherly kindness and brother love towards one another there's a lot of things they mean that i i i i i might do or i might not do just for someone else just for someone else i may feel one way about it amen but if if if if it helped my brother be comfortable then i'll do it it don't hurt me to do it or not to do it amen so let us let us uh keep these kind of things in mind as we move forward keep our pastor in prayer amen and just go on in the name of the lord amen because these things do we did we ain't shocked we ain't shocked by these things we surprised these things have been for years have been said that that this time was coming this is what we've been preparing for
